    , Accepted 4th November 2015First published on 6th November 2015AbstractIn conjugated polymers and small molecules of organic solar cells, aggregation induced by intermolecular interactions governs the performance of photovoltaics. However, little attention has been paid to the connection between molecular structure and aggregation within solar cells based on soluble small molecules. Here we demonstrate modulation of intermolecular aggregation of two synthesized molecules through heteroatom substitution to develop an understanding of the role of aggregation in conjugated molecules. Molecule 1 (M1) based on 2-ethylhexyloxy-benzene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTP) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) displays strong aggregation in commonly used organic solvents, which is reduced in molecule 2 (M2) by facile oxygen atom substitution on the BDTP unit confirmed by absorption spectroscopy and optical microscopy, while it successfully maintains molecular planarity and favorable charge transport characteristics. Solar cells based on M2 exhibit more than double the photocurrent of devices based on M1 and yield a power conversion efficiency of 5.5%. A systematic investigation of molecular conformation, optoelectronic properties, molecular packing and crystallinity as well as film morphology reveals structure dependent aggregation responsible for the performance difference between the two conjugated molecules.
Introduction
Recently, significant progress has been made in the field of solution processed small molecule solar cells (SMSCs) with the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 8–10%.1–3 By this metric, photovoltaics based on conjugated molecules have caught up with their conjugated polymer counterparts.4 In particular, similar to conjugated polymers, the approach of alternating electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) moieties has also been employed in the design of conjugated small molecules to broaden absorption bands as well as to modulate energy levels.5–7 Despite the high efficiencies that have been attained, however, research on the structure–property relationships of small molecules lags behind that on polymers.
Conjugated small molecules enjoy the inherent advantages of well-defined molecular structure and smaller batch to batch variation, but possess short conjugation lengths, leading to limited charge transport along the molecules.8 In early studies, poor active layer morphology and device fill factor (FF) were usually obtained due to the inferior intermolecular connectivity of small molecules.9 In order to improve film forming characteristics and enhance intermolecular charge transport, rigid backbones were introduced into molecules to strengthen π–π stacking and thus to drive molecules to self-assemble into ordered aggregates.5,10 Additionally, the introduction of π-stacking moieties as end groups has also been utilized as an effective strategy to promote intermolecular connectivity so as to optimize the active layer morphology and achieve a high FF.9a,11,12
It is well established that intermolecular interactions play a crucial role in molecular packing, giving rise to π orbital overlap between adjacent molecules. There are several types of non-covalent forces that can be utilized to affect intermolecular interactions, for instance, π–π stacking,13 hydrogen-bonding,14 and dipole–dipole interactions.15 The manipulation of these forces through supramolecular chemistry is an increasingly popular strategy to tune interactions between molecules and generate supramolecular structures.16 However, if the strength of intermolecular interactions is stronger than that of molecule–solvent interactions, the molecules would prefer to aggregate and this results in strong aggregation.17 Although the self-assembly of small molecules into aggregates can enhance mobility, the nanoscale morphology (ca. 10–100 nm) of bulk heterojunction solar cells is of great importance and must also be accounted for. Since typical exciton diffusion lengths in organic semiconductors are of ca. 10 nm, large aggregates may reduce the probability of excitons reaching an interface where charge separation occurs, and thus reduced exciton dissociation efficiencies would limit the photocurrent.18 Therefore, conjugated molecules which display moderate aggregation are desirable. However, few works have studied modulation of molecular aggregation through chemical structure design to achieve better SMSC performance.
In this work, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives were synthesized in order to study the effect of heteroatom substitution on molecular aggregation and the resulting photovoltaic device performance.19 First, we used a 2-ethylhexyloxy-benzene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTP) moiety as the molecular core to synthesize M1 (Scheme 1), and observed strong aggregation behavior in chloroform, chlorobenzene and toluene. Subsequently, we designed a 2-ethylhexyloxy-benzene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDFP) moiety via oxygen atom substitution on the BDTP moiety and thus synthesized M2 (Scheme 1). Compared with M1, the tendency of M2 to aggregate was well reduced in organic solvents. While large domains form in M1:PC61BM blends, the reduced tendency of M2 to aggregate results in the formation of more appropriately sized domains in blend films of M2:PC61BM, facilitating charge generation. Devices based on M2 show much higher photocurrents than M1, resulting in a high PCE of 5.5%. In addition, molecular conformation, optoelectronic properties, molecular packing and crystallinity, and film morphology were systematically investigated to reveal the structure–property relationships of M1 and M2.

Results and discussions
Molecular design and synthesis
The molecular structures of M1 and M2 are shown in Scheme 1. It is worth noting that both of the molecules employed identical alkyl side-chains, which is 2-ethylhexyl. Thus, the differences between M1 and M2 are completely induced by heteroatom substitution. The synthesis pathways of the monomers and the targeted molecules are displayed in the ESI.†
Backbone conformation of conjugated molecules
The effects of different heteroatom substitution on backbone conformation are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G*level in vacuo. Although the DFT calculations model the molecules in vacuo without considering the effect of sidechain and intermolecular interactions, they nonetheless provide a useful approach to evaluate the molecular planarity. The planarity of the conjugated backbone can be described by dihedral angles of σ bonds between conjugated moieties. The calculated values of φ0, φ1, φ2 and φ3 of each molecule are displayed in Table 1. For φ1, φ2 and φ3, the values are similar (φ1, φ2, φ3 < 3°) for both M1 and M2, indicating that both molecules have a planar conformation along the main backbone which would be beneficial for intermolecular stacking. However, for φ0, M1 shows a much higher value than M2, which can be attributed to the increased steric hindrance of sulfur compared to oxygen.20

Intermolecular packing study by absorption spectroscopy and optical microscopy
The optical absorption spectra of solutions and solid films were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy to investigate the optical properties and packing motifs of M1 and M2. The two molecules were studied under identical conditions to enable a direct comparison of structural information and photophysics. Solution absorption spectra in toluene and chloroform are shown in Fig. 1 and S1,† respectively. Each molecule shows a broad absorption band with two transition peaks (0–1 transition at ca. 595 nm for M1 and M2, 0–0 transition at ca. 627 nm for M1 and ca. 637 nm for M2) in the wavelength range between 550 and 650 nm. The major absorption of this band should be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor moieties in the ground state.21,22 As reported previously, donor–acceptor (D–A structure) molecules with planar conformations are able to self-assemble into nanoaggregates in solution.21 Moreover, aggregates formed in solution can be dispersed by increasing solution temperature.21,23,24 Therefore, temperature dependent absorption was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, the 0–0/0–1 oscillator strength ratio of the two transition peaks is >1 at room temperature (RT) for both M1 and M2. After increasing the solution temperature to 100 °C, the ratio for M1 decreased to ca. 1, while for M2, the absorption profile remained similar to that at RT. We ascribe this variance to different aggregate motifs of M1 and M2. For M1, the strong repulsion between sulfur atoms in adjacent molecules hampers a face-to-face packing, leading to a slipped packing of the molecules (inset in Fig. 1a).20,21 Therefore, intermolecular charge transfer was eliminated due to the dispersal of aggregates with increased solution temperature. For M2, a face-to-face packing of the molecules was formed (inset in Fig. 1b).21 In this type of aggregate, intramolecular charge transfer accounts for almost all of the absorption, explaining why the absorption spectra change relatively little upon aggregate dissociation. In addition, the absorption features in chloroform (Fig. S1†) are the same as those in toluene, indicating that the packing motifs of M1 and M2 are the same in both solvents.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis spectra of M1 and M2 in toluene (a, b) and in solid states (c, d) with temperature dependence; the insets are the different packing motifs of M1 and M2. 

Fig. 1c and d show the absorption spectra of solid films. Thermal annealing was applied to both thin films (from RT to 140 °C). At RT, both neat films exhibited three distinct vibronic absorption peaks with maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) at 620 nm for M1 and 615 nm for M2. In particular, the presence of vibronic structures at ca. 675 nm indicates that both molecules have ordered structures in the solid state.25 After thermal annealing, the two films exhibited completely different absorption features. For the M1 film, the absorption intensity at 420 nm and 620 nm decreased slightly upon annealing at 110 and 120 °C, while it markedly increased upon annealing at 130 °C and the peaks blue shifted simultaneously. It seems that the optical states altered during the thermal annealing. We ascribed this phenomenon to the variation of the intermolecular packing motif, varying from slipped packing to face-to-face packing. This interesting optical transformation has also been observed by another group.26 Whereas, for M2, no apparent variation can be observed after thermal annealing of the film, indicating that no optical transformation happened during the thermal annealing of the M2 film. Both absorption spectra of solutions and solid films revealed that M1 and M2 exhibited different packing motifs.
In order to further investigate the different packing motifs of M1 and M2 and to give a direct impression of the different aggregation behaviors of the two molecules, solutions in toluene with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 were prepared, with the materials dissolved completely at 80 °C. Subsequently, after cooling down to room temperature slowly, the solutions were spin coated onto glass substrates. Optical microscope images of the resulting films are shown in Fig. 2. The aggregates, coupled with the strong aggregation tendency of M1, lead to the formation of large rods with lengths of 10–30 μm which are observed in films of M1 (Fig. 2a). In contrast, no aggregates can be observed optically in M2 (Fig. 2b). The same phenomenon can also be found in films prepared from chloroform (Fig. S2†). The increased aggregation of M1 is likely due to the intermolecular donor–acceptor interactions between the electron-rich (donor) part of one molecule and the electron-deficient (acceptor) part of neighbor molecules.22 Additionally, the different aggregation behavior of M1 and M2 suggests that the solubilities of the two molecules are also different. Therefore, the solubility in chloroform at room temperature was determined according to a reported method27 and is displayed in Table 2. As expected, M2 exhibits higher solubility than M1 (>15 mg mL−1vs. 8 mg mL−1). Thus, precipitation of aggregates occurs in M1 at an earlier time during spin-coating, leading to the larger aggregates in the finished films.

Frontier orbital levels, crystallinity and field-effect hole mobility
The energy of the frontier molecular orbitals was characterized by electrochemical spectroscopy and is presented in Fig. S3.† The estimated HOMO and LUMO levels of M1 and M2 are −5.80, −5.79, −3.83 and −3.77 eV, respectively (Table 2). It indicates that the heteroatom substitution has no obvious effect on the HOMO levels while the LUMO levels changed slightly. The difference of LUMO levels between donor (M1 or M2) and acceptor (PC61BM with a LUMO of −4.1 eV) is larger than 0.3 eV, which is expected to yield a sufficient driving force for charge separation.29
To gain insight into the molecular ordering and quantitatively compare the differences between the two molecules, Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) of pure films was performed (Fig. S4†) and the detailed data are displayed in Table 3. GIWAXS patterns of the two molecules revealed distinct diffractions at q100ca. 0.34 Å−1 and q010ca. 1.7 Å−1 (we assume an orthorhombic unit cell and use d = 2π/q),30 which we interpret as alkyl stacking and π-stacking with d100ca. 19 Å and d010ca. 3.7 Å, respectively. The molecules exhibit very similar intermolecular spacing, although M2 has a slightly shorter π-stacking distance than M1. We observed that molecules are largely isotropic with a slight “edge on” orientation relative to the substrate (alkyl chains perpendicular to the substrate). The coherence lengths of π-stacking (D010) are similar for both molecules (ca. 16 Å), implying that the molecules are able to maintain crystalline coherence in the π-stacking direction for ca. 5 stacked chains. In the alkyl stacking direction, M1 (66.8 Å) exhibited a modestly longer coherence length than M2 (53.7 Å), likely due to the stronger aggregation of M1. From the GIWAXS results, we can conclude that, although M2 exhibits a lower tendency to aggregate than M1, the π-stacking distance of the molecule has not increased. In contrast, it is slightly smaller than that of M1. Moreover, while resulting in larger aggregates, strong aggregation of M1 has not increased the ordering in the π-stacking direction, which is probably due to the limited rotational freedom of the molecular backbone in M1.31

Great efforts have been devoted to the study of the influence of the solid-state packing on the transport for small molecules. It has been demonstrated that molecules with different packing motifs can exhibit different charge carrier mobilities.32–34 Herein, top-gate/bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated to study the effects of the packing motifs as well as aggregation behaviors on the charge transport properties of the two materials.35 Details of the device fabrication are described in the ESI.† All of the OFETs exhibited p-type transport with hole mobilities calculated in the saturation regime (VD = −80 V). As a result, M1 exhibited an average hole mobility (μh) of (3.5 ± 1.4) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of ca. 103 (Fig. 4a and b). In M2, although the molecules exhibited smaller intermolecular distance than M1 that was observed in GIWAXS, which would be beneficial for intermolecular charge transport due to the greater overlap of π orbitals among close-packed molecules, the hole mobility of M2 is more than one order of magnitude lower than M1, exhibiting an average μh of (2.1 ± 0.4) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a much lower on/off ratio of <102 (Fig. 3c and d). The different OFET performance of M1 and M2 indicates that, in this case, molecules with slipped packing and strong aggregation are more favorable for charge transport.

Characterization of photovoltaic performance
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices based on blends of each molecule with PC61BM were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performance.

 Fig. 4  (a) J–V characteristics of as-cast devices and optimized devices by thermal annealing under 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar illumination; (b) FTPS-EQE spectrum for deducing ECT; the energy of the excitonic states (ED*) was determined from the optical absorption onset of the molecule. 
The optimal donor–acceptor weight ratio is 1:1 for both molecules, and two different batches of devices based on as-cast and annealed (120 °C for 10 min) blend films were fabricated for each molecule. It should be mentioned that we prepared solutions with different concentrations (15 mg mL−1 for M1:PC61BM, 20 mg mL−1 for M2:PC61BM) since the two molecules exhibited different solubilities. As-cast devices based on M1 exhibited short-circuit current (JSC) of 5.30 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, and fill factor (FF) of 60%, resulting in a PCE of 2.7%. After thermal annealing, the performance of the devices did not improve significantly. In particular, both of the devices exhibited low photocurrents, likely due to the coarse morphology (discussed below) induced by the strong aggregation of M1. For M2, as discussed above, due to the reduced tendency to aggregate, a molecularly mixed blend film can be formed. As shown in Table 4, as-cast devices based on M2 exhibited increased JSC, but reduced VOC and FF compared with the solar cells based on M1. After thermal annealing, the photocurrent and FF increased significantly, resulting in a much higher PCE of 5.5%. The improved JSC and FF indicate that a superior morphology with nanoscale phase separation has been formed, leading to improved charge transport and reduced recombination of photogenerated charges in the active layer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S5.† The EQE spectra of the devices based on M1 exhibited only 30%, while for M2 based devices, the highest EQE approached 65% at ca. 600 nm.
It should be noted that the devices based on M1 gave higher VOC than that of M2, especially for thermally annealed devices, although the HOMO levels of M1 and M2 are similar. The VOC is mainly related to the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT), which not only depends on the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor but is also affected by D–A material interactions.36 To investigate the reason for this difference in VOC, we measured the EQEs of the CT state absorption using highly sensitive Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) (Fig. 4b).37 EQE at low energies (<1.65 eV) can be attributed to CT state absorption. ECT is then obtained by fitting the low energy portion of the EQE spectrum.6,37ECT of the M1:PC61BM device (1.50 eV) is indeed higher than that of the M2:PC61BM device (1.37 eV). We ascribe this CT energy difference to the morphology variation between the two materials.
The transport properties of the different blends could also affect the photovoltaic performance and depend on the different aggregation of the two molecules. Hole and electron mobilities of the blend films based on M1 and M2 were investigated by using hole and electron only diodes with a space charge limited current (SCLC) model,38 respectively, as shown in Fig. S6.† The data are summarized in Table 4. For M1, the hole and electron mobilities of as cast and annealed devices are 2.0 × 10−4, 2.7 × 10−4, 3.1 × 10−4 and 6.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while for M2 based devices, the hole and electron mobilities of as-cast and annealed devices are 1.2 × 10−4, 3.7 × 10−4, 2.1 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thermal annealing of the blend films is indeed helpful for mobility enhancement for both M1 and M2. Particularly, electron mobilities of both devices are more than doubled after thermal annealing due to the aggregate of PC61BM. Both dramatically enhanced hole and electron mobilities in annealed devices based on M2 indicate that a superior nanoscale bicontinuous phase-separated network has been formed and is consistent with the higher photocurrent found in these devices.
Morphology study
The quenching efficiency of photoluminescence (PL) upon the addition of PCBM is usually considered to reflect the possibility of exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface within its lifetime.39–41 As discussed above, a nanoscale network of small molecules and fullerene is needed due to the limited diffusion length of excitons (ca. 10 nm). Although PL can only measure radiative exciton recombination which is just a small fraction of the total recombination, it still provides a good approach to analyze the quality of the film morphology.30 For the material system comprising M1 and PC61BM, PL is quenched by 80% (as-cast) and 77% (annealed) relative to the initial PL of neat M1 films (Fig. 5a). Since the energetic offset in this material system can provide sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation, the low PL quenching efficiencies are attributed to the coarse morphology caused by the strong aggregation of M1. The inferior exciton dissociation efficiencies can properly explain the low photogenerated currents obtained in solar cells. In the case of M2:PC61BM blends, in contrast to M1, the PL is quenched efficiently by 94% (as cast) and 92% (annealed) relative to neat films (Fig. 5b). The high quenching efficiencies mean that the composite of M2 and PC61BM is blended well due to the reduced aggregation of M2. This facilitates exciton dissociation, and is in agreement with the high photocurrents obtained in the solar cell measurements.

Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been carried out to further identify the differences in nanostructures of the BHJ active layers (Fig. 6). For as-cast and annealed M1:PC61BM films, obvious large aggregates, on the order of 100–200 nm in diameter, can be observed (Fig. 6a and b), indicating that large phase separation occurs in both active layers. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values obtained from topographic scans are 1.88 and 1.79 nm, respectively. In contrast, the AFM topographic images of M2:PC61BM as cast and annealed films show much finer structures with RMS values of 0.52 and 0.63 nm, respectively. More uniform and smoother morphology obtained for M2:PC61BM indicates that appropriate nanoscale morphology was formed in the blends. The results from AFM fully agree with the results from PL quenching, with a finer nanostructure observed in the M2 based blends.

In conclusion, we demonstrate the connection between molecular aggregations and structures in novel synthesized molecules M1 and M2 with heteroatom substitution. Temperature dependent absorption indicates M1 with slipped aggregation, but M2 with face-to-face aggregation. The slipped packing of M1 induces intermolecular donor–acceptor interactions between the donor part of one molecule and the acceptor part of neighbor molecules, leading to strong aggregation. Despite a reduced aggregation, M2 displays a slightly shorter π-stacking distance than M1, and both molecules show a similar level of ordering in π-stacking direction. However, M2 was more soluble in common solvents than M1. Devices based on M2 exhibit much higher photocurrents than those based on M1 due to the favorable nanoscale morphology formed in M2:PC61BM films, which facilitates exciton dissociation and charge extraction. The correlation between molecular structures and aggregations discovered in this work provides insight for designing better conjugated small molecules for highly efficient SMSCs in the future.
Experimental
Materials

n-BuLi, Pd(PPh3)4, 4-bromo-2-fluorophenol and Sn(CH3)3Cl were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co, and they were used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenoneketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially with analytical-grade quality and used without further purification. Compound 4 was synthesized according to the reported literature.42 All the other compounds were synthesized following the procedures described herein (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of monomers and small molecules. 
Synthesis of compound 1
4-Bromo-2-fluorophenol (4.8 g, 25 mmol) and K2CO3 (4.2 g, 30 mmol) were put into a two-neck round-bottom flask, and then 120 mL DMF was added. 1-Bromo-2-ethylhexane (5.1 g, 27 mmol) was added dropwise via a syringe. Under an argon atmosphere, the mixture was heated to 150 °C overnight. It was then cooled to room temperature, poured into 300 mL water and extracted two times with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The organic extract was washed successively with saturated potassium hydroxide and water twice, respectively. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvents were evaporated under a vacuum and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column eluting with petroleum ether. A brown oil was obtained (4.9 g, 65% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ: 7.38 (d, 1H), 7.35 (d, 1H), 6.82 (d, 1H), 3.94 (d, 1H), 1.77 (m, 2H), 164–1.33 (m, 8H), 0.88 (s, 6H). MS: m/z = 304 (M+).
Synthesis of compound 2
Under vigorous stirring, 4-bromo-1-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2-fluorophenol (4.6 g, 15 mmol) was added dropwise to magnesium turnings (0.4 g, 17 mmol) in anhydrous THF (25 mL) which was protected by argon. During the process, I2 (0.3 g) was added as a catalyst to the reaction. The solution was refluxed for 5 h until the magnesium was consumed. The mixture was refluxed for one more hour and then was cooled down. The solution system was added slowly to benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (1.1 g, 5 mmol) dispersed in 20 mL THF. SnCl2·2H2O (7.3 g) was dissolved in 10% aqueous HCl (11 mL) and then added dropwise into the reaction mixture. The solution was stirred for another 1 h at 50 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane; the organic extract was washed successively with water and sodium bicarbonate solution twice and the combined organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to afford the crude product. The crude product was purified on a silica gel column, eluting with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 = 10/1. A yellow solid was obtained (1.3 g, 42% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ: 7.68 (d, 2H), 7.60 (m, 2H), 7.38 (m, 2H), 7.09 (d, 2H), 6.89 (d, 2H), 3.95 (d, 4H), 1.80 (m, 2H), 1.66–1.38 (m, 16H), 0.90 (m, 12H).

Synthesis of monomer D1
A solution of compound 2 (1.27 g, 2 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL) was deoxygenated with argon for 20 min, and then 2.4 M n-butyllithium solution in n-hexane (5.2 mL, 5.8 mmol) was added dropwise at −78 °C. Then the solution was allowed to warm up to 30 °C for 1 h, 1.0 M trimethyltin chloride solution in THF (10 mL, 10 mmol) was added at −78 °C, and the solution was stirred for another 5 h at 30 °C. Then the mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane.
