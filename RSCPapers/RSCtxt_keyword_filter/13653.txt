    , Accepted 3rd September 2021First published on 3rd September 2021AbstractLead-free metal halide perovskites have attracted great attention as light harvesters due to their promising optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties. In this investigation, we have successfully synthesized thermally stable cubic phase cesium tin chloride (CsSnCl3) perovskite nanocrystals with improved surface morphology by adopting a rapid hot-injection technique. The excellent crystalline quality of these cubic shaped nanocrystals was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. The binding of organic ligands on the surface of the sample was identified and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed that the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals have a direct band gap of ∼2.98 eV, which was further confirmed using steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. The band edge positions calculated using the Mulliken electronegativity approach predicted the potential photocatalytic capability of the as-prepared nanocrystals, which was then experimentally corroborated through the photodegradation of rhodamine-B dye under both visible and UV-visible irradiation. Our theoretical calculations employing experimentally obtained structural parameters within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U methods demonstrated a 90% accurate estimation of the experimentally observed optical band gap when Ueff = 6 eV was considered. The ratio of the effective mass of the hole and electron expressed as  was also calculated for Ueff = 6 eV. Based on this theoretical calculation and experimental observation of the photocatalytic performance of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, we have proposed a rational interpretation of the “D” value. We think that a “D” value of either much smaller or much larger than 1 is an indication of the low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the high photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst. We believe that this comprehensive investigation might be helpful for the large-scale synthesis of thermally stable cubic CsSnCl3 nanocrystals and also for a greater understanding of their potential in photocatalytic, photovoltaic and other prominent optoelectronic applications.
1 Introduction
Halide perovskites of ABX3 stoichiometry, where A is a monovalent organic (e.g., CH3NH3+) or inorganic cation (e.g., Cs+ or Rb+), B is a divalent metal ion (e.g., Sn2+, Pb2+, Mn2+ or Ge2+) and X is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br or I), have attracted a significant research focus over the past few years due to their promising optoelectronic applications in, for example, semiconducting thin-film transistors,1,2 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),3–6 solar cells,7–10 photodetectors11,12 and photovoltaics.13–15 Recently, a good number of all-inorganic metal halide perovskites (MHPs), especially cesium (Cs)-based perovskites CsBX3, have attracted particular attraction due to their fascinating thermal stability16 as well as their intriguing optoelectronic properties.17–20 So far, various divalent metal ions, such as Pb2+, Sn2+, and Mn2+ as the B-site cation in CsBX3 perovskites, have been studied comprehensively and, in particular, lead (Pb2+)-based halide perovskites have shown a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% after years of research.21 However, from an environmental standpoint, the toxicity of Pb is still a frustrating issue for the large-scale production and industry-level applications of lead-based halide perovskites. Hence, from a commercial prospect, a significant amount of research has recently been conducted by substituting Pb with non-toxic Sn to fabricate lead-free CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 MHPs and thereby to investigate their potential applications in photodetectors,22 LEDs,23 LASERs,24 X-ray detectors,25 memristors26 and synaptic devices.27 Compared with Br- and I-based MHPs, the experimental and theoretical investigations on the optical properties and electronic band structures of CsSnCl3 perovskite have been less explored. In particular, the photocatalytic properties of CsSnCl3 perovskite are yet to be investigated to the best of our knowledge.
Notably, the fabrication of thermally stable CsSnCl3 nanocrystals with the desired morphology is quite challenging. A previous investigation reported the fabrication process of cubic CsSnCl3 nanocrystals that required temperature-controlled mechanical milling and subsequent 12 hour-long high-temperature heat treatment.28 In a separate investigation,29 CsSnCl3 perovskites of phases I and II were also synthesised successfully; however, the synthesis technique required high-temperature processing steps. Apart from these, in a number of other investigations,30,31 CsSnCl3 nanocrystals were synthesised by employing organic solvent-assisted treatment along with energy-consuming high-temperature annealing, which are not suitable for the time- and cost-effective synthesis of halide perovskites. Therefore, a simple and fast alternative synthesis approach such as the hot-injection technique32 is essential to fabricate CsSnCl3 nanocrystals with the desired structure, phase purity and surface morphology. Notably, the hot-injection technique has been widely employed to synthesize lead-free CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 perovskite nanocrystals.33,34
Furthermore, the experimental investigation of the material properties of halide perovskites at the molecular level is very complicated and sometimes unattainable due to the unavailability of the required experimental facilities. These complexities can be circumvented to a greater extent by implementing density functional theory (DFT) based on first-principles calculations. By using the conventional DFT method, theoretical investigations of the optical and electronic properties of the CsSnCl3 perovskite have been carried out.35,36 In the aforementioned investigations, the theoretically calculated optical band gap of the CsSnCl3 perovskite was underestimated significantly when compared with the experimentally obtained band gap.35,36 In a previous investigation,36 the computationally more costly hybrid exchange–correlation functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06)37 was used in the DFT calculations. However, the theoretically calculated band gap of CsSnCl3 deviated by 45.9% from the experimentally observed value.38 The accuracy of the optical properties and the electronic band structure calculation of CsSnCl3 must be improved for precise calculation of the optical and electronic band structure of CsSnCl3 perovskite. In this regard, the effect of the on-site Coulomb and the exchange interaction may be considered within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) by implementing the GGA+U method.39–41 In the GGA+U method, the Hubbard Ueff correction is implemented in the form of Ueff = U − J, where the effects of the on-site Coulomb and the exchange interaction are denoted by U and J, respectively.42,43
Therefore, in this investigation, the CsSnCl3 perovskite was synthesised using the hot-injection technique at a temperature of 200 °C without performing any subsequent mechanical milling or any other energy-consuming high-temperature pre/post-processing. We observed that the results obtained for the chemical composition and optical band gap were in good agreement with other published results,26,31,38 which further confirmed the successful synthesis of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals via the hot-injection method. Moreover, the synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals exhibited excellent absorption in the visible spectrum, which indicated their usability as a solar absorber and photocatalyst. Therefore, as a case study of its practical application, the photocatalytic dye degradation test of a well-known organic dye, rhodamine-B (RhB), was performed under both visible and UV-visible light irradiation. A photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency of up to 58% was observed by irradiating with solar light for 180 minutes using a solar simulator. Moreover, using both the GGA and GGA+U methods, the effects of the on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction on the absorption coefficient, band gap, band structure, the effective masses of charge carriers, charge density, etc., were investigated. The outcome of our theoretical calculations demonstrates that the GGA+U method incorporated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional provides reasonably accurate results that are close to the experimentally obtained values when considering Ueff = 6 eV. Through our theoretical investigation, the ratio of the effective masses of electrons and holes was also evaluated to gain a deeper insight into the charge carrier recombination rate within the photocatalyst.
2 Experimental details
2.1 Sample preparation
In the present investigation, we have synthesized the CsSnCl3 perovskite by adopting a facile, low-temperature hot-injection technique.44,45Fig. 1 depicts schematically the synthesis steps of the CsSnCl3 perovskite. Initially, to prepare Cs-oleate, 0.40 mmol of Cs2CO3 was added to a mixture of 15 mL of 1-octadecene and 1.25 mL of oleic acid. Then the mixture was vigorously stirred for 15 minutes and dried at 120 °C for 1 hour in a vacuum. Afterwards, the resultant mixture was heated for 1 hour at 180 °C under an argon (Ar) atmosphere, which led to the precipitation of the desired Cs-oleate. The obtained Cs-oleate precipitate was heated at 80 °C for 30 minutes before using it for the synthesis of CsSnCl3.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the synthesis steps of the CsSnCl3 perovskite using the hot-injection technique. 
Next, for the synthesis of the CsSnCl3 perovskite, 225 mmol of SnCl2·2H2O, 30 mL of 1-octadecene, 3 mL of oleic acid and 3 mL of oleylamine were mixed together in a beaker by magnetic stirring and then dried at 120 °C for 1 hour under vacuum. Afterwards, 2.5 mL of the Cs-oleate solution was injected rapidly into the beaker, and then the beaker was quickly transferred to a furnace working under an inert atmosphere. Thereafter, the solution was heated at 200 °C for 1.5 hours under an Ar atmosphere. The mixture was then rapidly cooled using an ice bath. Finally, the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals were separated from the solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and were washed three times with n-hexane. Prior to further characterization, the obtained powder sample was dried at 80 °C for 4 hours in avacuum.
2.2 Material characterization
The crystal structure of the as-prepared sample was investigated by analysing its powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using a diffractometer (Rigaku SmartLab) with a Cu X-ray source (wavelength, λ: Kα1 = 1.54059 Å  and Kα2 = 1.54180 Å). Further, Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD data was carried out uing the FullProf computer program46 to determine the crystallographic parameters. Thermal analysis of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 perovskite was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (NETZSCH, STA 449 F3 Jupiter) under a N2 atmosphere (heating rate 10 °C min−1). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the sample was recorded in the wavenumber range of 650 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1 using a Spectrum Two FT-IR Spectrometer (PerkinElmer). Furthermore, the surface morphology of the sample was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (XL30SFEG; Philips, Netherlands and S4300; HITACHI, Japan). In addition, elemental analysis was carried out using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Furthermore, a transmission electron microscope (TOPCOM EM-002B) was used at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV to obtain the bright-field images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 perovskite. To determine the chemical binding energies and valence states of different compositional elements at the surface of the CsSnCl3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a PHI5600 ESCA 120 (ULVAC PHI) system. The XPS spectrum was extracted using monochromatized Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV) and a 121 hemispherical mirror analyzer (total energy resolution ≈ 0.13 eV). The Shirley 123 procedure was applied to subtract the background of the XPS spectra and the Gaussian–Lorentzian function was used for peak fitting. For assessing the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, a Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer was used with the 1H frequency of 400.17 MHz at a temperature of 297.6 K. The spectral width was set to be 14 ppm and 64k data points were sampled with a relaxation delay of 4 seconds. The absorbance spectrum of the material was obtained using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the sample was obtained using an RF 6000 luminescence spectrometer made by Shimadzu, Japan. The photoluminescence lifetime of the sample was measured using a PicoQuant Fluotime 300 instrument equipped with a PMA 175 detector and an LDH-P-C-440 diode laser with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. The photocatalytic efficiency of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals was evaluated via the photodegradation of RhB dye under solar irradiation. The details of the photocatalytic experiments are provided in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Experimental analysis

3.1.1 Crystal structure analysis. 
The crystallographic structure and phase composition of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 perovskite were investigated by analyzing its Rietveld refined powder XRD spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the Bragg reflected peaks exhibited by the sample can be indexed at (110), (200), (211), (220), (301), (222), (401), (411) and (420) planes (JCPDS card file no. 22-0200), which conform to the cubic crystal phase (Pm3m space group) of the CsSnCl3 perovskite.28 Notably, the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 did not exhibit any undesirable peaks, which indicates its high-phase purity. By Rietveld refinement analysis, the lattice parameters of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 perovskite were determined as a = b = c = 5.583 Å, and α = β = γ = 90° with a unit cell volume of 174.02 Å3. For further understanding, the atomic positions and bond lengths of CsSnCl3 as well as the reliability (R) factors of Rietveld refinement are shown in Table 1.

The thermal stability of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 sample was investigated by conducting TGA and DSC measurements. The outcomes of these measurements are presented in Fig. 2(b). As can be observed from the TGA curve, the weight loss of the CsSnCl3 perovskite due to the increase in temperature from 30 °C to 280 °C was only 2.15%, which is an indication of its excellent thermal stability. Such a small percentage weight loss indicates the presence of a nominal amount of binding surface ligands, i.e., oleylamine and oleic acid on the as-synthesized nanocrystals.17,47,48
Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b), no endothermic or exothermic peak was observed in the DSC curve of the synthesized CsSnCl3 perovskite, indicating that any crystallographic phase transition did not occur in our fabricated sample within the temperature range of 30 °C to 280 °C. The observed initial decrease in the DSC curve can be attributed to the removal of moisture from the sample. Here, it is intriguing to note that according to a recent investigation,28 CsSnCl3 crystals synthesized via the mechanical milling technique undergoe a monoclinic to cubic phase transition at around 120 °C and, hence, heat treatment at 120 °C is required to obtain the stable cubic phase using this technique. By contrast, the as-synthesized cubic-phase CsSnCl3 perovskite demonstrates a high structural stability over a wide temperature range, which eliminates the need for post-processing heat treatment and justifies the significance of employing the rapid hot-injection technique to synthesize CsSnCl3 with a stable crystallographic phase.


3.1.2 FTIR analysis. 
Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy was conducted to identify the presence of different functional groups within the CsSnCl3 perovskite. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the FTIR spectrum of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals exhibited a broad band at 590 cm−1 which can be attributed to the in-plane O–H group bending vibration.49,50 The two weak absorbance peaks observed at 1406 and 1462 cm−1 are ascribed to the CH2 bending.51 The absorption band at 1637 cm−1 might have arisen due to the Sn–Cl bond formation.50 The discerned peak around 2360 cm−1 can be associated with the CO vibrations.52 The vibrational bands at 2856 and 2925 cm−1 have emerged due to the C–H stretching vibrations at the methylene groups of the precursors, i.e., oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA), respectively.53,54 In addition, the broad absorption band at 3417 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the O–H functional group. Thus, the outcomes of FTIR analysis conspicuously justify the successful formation of phase-pure CsSnCl3 perovskite, as was also evident from the XRD analysis.


3.1.3 Morphological and elemental analysis. 
The FESEM image of the CsSnCl3 perovskite shown in Fig. 2(d) revealed that the surface of our as-prepared sample was satisfactorily homogeneous and non-porous. Noticeably, in a previous investigation, agglomeration in the CsSnCl3 perovskite was observed, although the material was synthesized via mechanical milling under an inert atmosphere and subsequent heat treatment for 12 hours.28 By contrast, the hot-injection technique used in this investigation successfully yielded non-agglomerated CsSnCl3 perovskite crystals, as shown in Fig. 2(d). For a better insight, we present a magnified view of the as-synthesized sample in the inset of Fig. 2(d). Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the particle size distribution. From these two figures, it can be estimated that the average particle size lies in the sub-micrometer region. which confirms the successful synthesis of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals. Furthermore, the elemental composition of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals was assessed via EDX analysis at room temperature. The mass and atomic percentages of each element in CsSnCl3 as obtained by EDX are provided in the ESI† (Table S1). For comparison, we have also tabulated the theoretically calculated values in the ESI† (Table S1). Clearly, the mass and atomic percentages of the desired elements, i.e., Cs, Sn and Cl, in the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals are in good agreement with the theoretical values, which provides further evidence for the successful synthesis of the CsSnCl3 perovskite.

Fig. 3(a) shows the bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystal, which is of a cubic shape. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Fig. 3(b) shows the crystallinity of this nanocrystal with a 3.70 Å interplanar spacing. The inset of Fig. 3(b) reveals the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystal. The SAED pattern demonstrates the presence of the (202), (022), and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic phase, which further confirms the formation of the cubic structure of this nanocrystal.55,56

3.1.4 Chemical state analysis. 
The chemical composition of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals was investigated by performing XPS analysis, and the obtained full survey XPS spectrum is demonstrated in Fig. 4(a). In this survey spectrum, strong peaks for the Cs, Sn and Cl core levels were identified, which confirm the successful synthesis of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals with the desired surface chemical states. Notably, two additional peaks corresponding to the C 1s and O 1s orbitals were also noticed in the XPS spectrum of CsSnCl3 (Fig. 4(a)). The emergence of these peaks may be due to the molecular adsorption of oxygen and carbon on the surface of the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals during exposure to the atmosphere, which is common in the XPS investigationd of related perovskites.55,57 For further insight, we present the high-resolution XPS core spectra of Cs 3d, Sn 3d and Cl 2p orbitals in Fig. 4(b)–(d), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(b), two distinct peaks can be observed at the binding energies of 723.9 eV and 737.8 eV in the Cs 3d XPS spectrum, which can be ascribed to the presence of the Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 states, respectively.58 As shown in Fig. 4(c), the core level spectrum of Sn was distinguished by the two pronounced peaks at 485.6 eV and 494 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 states, respectively.59 As shown in Fig. 4(d), the Cl 2p core level spectrum of CsSnCl3 exhibits an asymmetric peak, which has been de-convoluted into two symmetric Gaussian peaks at 197.1 eV and 198.5 eV. Notably, the peak at the lower binding energy, i.e., 197.1 eV, is associated with the Cl 2p3/2 state, while the higher binding energy peak can be attributed to the existence of the Cl 2p1/2 state in the as-prepared CsSnCl3 nanocrystals.60,61

Core level XPS spectra for (b) Cs 3d, (c) Sn 3d and (d) Cl 2p, demonstrating the purity of the sample and the valence states of the constituent elements, respectively. 
Furthermore, to identify the binding of surface ligands of the CsSnCl3 perovskite nanocrystals, we performed one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectroscopy. Prior to the characterization, the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals were dissolved in deuterated CDCl3 solvent. The 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the nanocrystals obtained under the aforementioned conditions are demonstrated in the ESI† (Fig. S2). Interestingly, the peak formation is comparable to that formed for analogous perovskite nanocrystals. However, an up-field chemical shift in the peaks can be detected, which might be attributed to the electronegativity of the Cl atoms.17 For deeper insight, we compared the obtained NMR spectrum with previously reported NMR spectra of oleic acid, oleylamine, and octadecene.17,62 It can be clearly seen that the peaks below 2.2 ppm appear because of the presence of oleic acid, octadecene, and oleylamine ligands, but as their peaks are overlapping owing to their chemical shifts it is difficult to separate their individual peaks in this regime. Around 2.44 ppm, we found a relatively weak peak which is ascribed to be the characteristic peak of oleic acid. Evidently, at around 3.25 ppm, a very wide peak is obtained, which can be attributed to CH2–N and, similarly, around 6.87 ppm, another broad peak is obtained which corresponds to the NH3+ originating from oleyammonium. These two peaks are unambiguously correlated to oleylamine, which is also in good agreement with previous reports.17 Notably, the peak at 5.35 ppm is associated with the alkane proton, which might have originated from either the oleylamine or oleic acid or from both of them. Such an observation eventually conforms to the presence of protonated oleylamine.17 Interestingly, we did not observe the characteristic resonances of a terminal alkene, presumably octadecene, which provides evidence for the surface purity of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, unlike CsPbBr3 nanocrystals reported in a previous investigation.17


3.1.5 Experimentally obtained optical properties. 
The optical properties of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals were studied by conducting UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. From Fig. 5(a), it can be seen that the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals show significantly higher absorption in the visible region compared with the infrared region. Moreover, a strong absorption peak is noticeable in the ultraviolet region of the absorption spectrum of CsSnCl3, which suggests its applicability for solar energy harvesting. Furthermore, we analysed the absorbance data to determine the optical band gap of our as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals using the Tauc relationship.63 Since a number of previous investigations have reported that the band gap of CsSnCl3 is direct,38,64 hence we used the Tauc relationship for direct band gap materials as shown in Fig. 5(b). From the Tauc plot, the direct optical band gap of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 can be estimated as ∼2.98 eV, which is consistent with the literature.26,31,38 We also measured the PL spectra of CsSnCl3 to gain insight into the charge carrier recombination phenomenon. The PL peak shown in Fig. 5(c) is an indication of the radiative recombination of photoexcited electron–hole (e−–h+) pairs. The direct band gap value can also be estimated from the PL peak as ∼2.96 eV, which agrees well with the outcome of the Tauc plot (Fig. 5(b)).

(d) Time-resolved PL decay curve under pulsed 440 nm excitation at room temperature for CsSnCl3 nanocrystals. 
Furthermore, in order to measure the excited-state lifetime of the charge carriers in the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, we used the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique and present the time-resolved PL decay curve in Fig. 5(d). The average lifetime (τav) of the charge carriers was calculated as 4.27 ns by fitting the decay curve with the single-exponential function. Notably, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of the sample was determined to be 91%. The radiative lifetime was also calculated from the τav and PLQY data using eqn (1). The non-radiative lifetime (τnr) and the radiative (kr)/non-radiative (knr) recombination rate constants were subsequently obtained using eqn (2) and (3). Notably, the calculated values of kr and knr of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals were 0.213 ns−1 and 0.021 ns−1, respectively, which are comparable with similar investigations performed previously.55,65,66 (1) (2) (3)In order to assess the potential of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals for photocatalytic applications, we determined their band edge positions by adopting the Mulliken electronegativity approach. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) potential (vs. the normal hydrogen electrode potential, NHE) of CsSnCl3 were calculated to be −0.44 and 2.54 eV, respectively. An energy band diagram is provided in the ESI† (Fig. S3) consolidating the obtained values of the CBM and VBM along with the redox potentials of the different redox half-reactions of our interest. According to thermodynamics, to act as an effective catalyst for photocatalytic dye degradation, a material must possess a VBM of >2.38 eV and a CBM of <−0.16 V for carrying out the reduction and oxidation half-reactions, respectively.67 Clearly, both the CBM and VBM potentials of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals meet the aforementioned requirements, which indicate their promising potential for the photocatalytic degradation of different organic dyes. Moreover, the calculated band edge positions of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals shown in ESI† Fig. S3 are also favorable for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting. Hence, we further assessed the photocatalytic efficiency of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, which will be discussed in the next section.


3.1.6 Photocatalytic degradation activity. 
The photocatalytic performance of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals was investigated as a case study for the degradation of RhB under both visible and UV-visible illumination. Initially, for both experimental conditions, a typical RhB blank test and a dark-absorption test were carried out. The outcome of these tests confirmed the negligible self-photolysis and chemi-adsorption potential of the RhB dye molecules, implying that the decomposition of RhB is solely attributed to photocatalysis. Fig. 6(a) and (b) demonstrate the change in the absorbance spectra of RhB photodegraded over as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals under the irradiation of visible and UV-visible light, respectively. Clearly, under visible-light illumination (Fig. 6(a)), the intensity of the characteristic absorption peak at 553 nm decreased gradually up to 240 minutes, indicating the successful decomposition of RhB. On the other hand, for UV-visible irradiation (Fig. 6(b)), the peak decreased more rapidly up to 180 minutes and no significant degradation could be observed after that. Fig. 6(c) shows the degradation efficiency vs. irradiation time curves where C0 and C denote the initial and residual concentrations measured at 30 minute intervals, respectively. It can be seen that CsSnCl3 degraded ∼35% of the RhB dye after 240 minutes of visible-light irradiation. Interestingly, the degradation percentage of RhB increased to ∼58% within only 180 minutes under UV-visible irradiation. Such an enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals can be attributed to their reasonably wide-band gap value, ∼2.98 eV (Fig. 5(d)), along with their good crystallinity and excellent surface morphology. It can be anticipated that the photoexcitation of charge carriers was enhanced significantly under the illumination of high-energy UV photons, which eventually resulted in a higher RhB dye degradation rate.

(d) Wavelength shifts of the absorption spectra of the RhB dye solution under identical conditions of figure (c). 
It is worth noting that the RhB dye typically degrades via two competitive and co-existing pathways, i.e., the cleavage of its whole conjugated chromophore structure and the N-deethylation process.68,69 In the first pathway, the absorption peak intensity decreases while the peak position remains constant. By contrast, during N-deethylation, the characteristic peak gradually shifts to shorter wavelengths with constant intensity. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the decrement in the RhB absorption peak intensity can be attributed to the cleavage of the aromatic ring of the RhB dye during photocatalysis. Another intriguing feature to be noticed from these figures is the shift of the absorption peak to a shorter wavelength during photocatalysis in the presence of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals. Such hypsochromic shifts can beattributed to the formation of a series of N-deethylated intermediates of RhB during photocatalysis. The trend of this blue-shift under visible and UV-visible irradiation is demonstrated in Fig. 6(d). As shown in this figure, the maximum absorption band of the RhB solution shifted significantly from 553 nm to 498 nm under 240 minutes of UV-visible irradiation, whereas the peak wavelength shift was relatively insignificant under visible irradiation. Hence, it can be inferred that the effect of the N-deethylation process on photocatalysis was more prominent under UV-visible light as compared with visible-light illumination.

3.2 Theoretical analysis
To explain the underlying mechanism behind the photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, a comprehensive investigation is further required on their optical and electronic properties. However, the complexity of the experimental conditions and, to some extent, the unavailability of the required experimental set-up pose a difficulty in carrying out such measurements precisely. Therefore, we analyzed both the optical and electronic properties, i.e., band structure, effective mass, density of states, atomic bond formation and electron charge density, of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals via density functional theory (DFT)-based first-principles calculations using the experimentally obtained crystallographic parameters.39

3.2.1 Computational details. 
The DFT-based first-principles calculations were carried out within the plane wave pseudopotential (PWPP) framework as implemented in the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP).70 We adopted both the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U methods based on the PBE gradient corrected exchange–correlation functional.71 The crystallographic structural parameters obtained from the Rietveld refined powder XRD spectrum of the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 were used for the DFT calculations. The Cs 5s25p66s1, Sn 5s25p2 and Cl 3s23p5 electrons were treated as the valence electrons. To relax the configuration in terms of atomic locations and lattice parameters, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon (BFGS) algorithm was implemented.72 The atomic structures were completely relaxed before the residual forces fell below 0.01 eV Å−1  with a self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance of 5.0 × 10−7 eV per atom.
Prior to calculation, a convergence study and geometry optimization were carried out to select the optimum plane-wave cutoff energy and k-points. Fig. S4(a) in the ESI† shows the plane-wave cut-off energy convergence result for structural optimization, where the dashed line indicates the default cut-off energy. Noticeably, a 600 eV cut-off energy was found to be sufficient to converge the ground-state energy. Therefore, for the subsequent calculations, we applied the Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotential to the plane wave basis sets with the optimized cut-off energy of 600 eV. Moreover, from Fig. S4(b) (ESI†), it can be observed that a 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh is sufficient to obtain the ground-state energy of the CsSnCl3 perovskite and, hence, a 15 × 15 × 15 k-point grid was employed for Brillouin-zone integration.73 The convergence thresholds for the geometry optimization were: (a) total energy 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom, (b) maximum force 0.01 eV Å−1, (c) maximum stress 0.02 GPa and (d) maximum displacement 5.0 × 10−4 Å.
Finally, to investigate the effect of on-site Coulomb and exchange interactions on the structural, optical and electronic properties of the CsSnCl3 perovskite, GGA+U calculations were conducted using different Ueff values. To be specific, the Ueff value was varied from 1 to 7 eV for the s and p orbitals of all the atoms of CsSnCl3.


3.2.2 First-principles calculations of the crystal structure. 
The structural parameters of the CsSnCl3 perovskite were determined via first-principles calculations using the GGA (Ueff = 0 eV) and GGA+U (Ueff = 1–7 eV) approaches. The calculated lattice constant a = b = c along with the unit cell volume for Ueff = 1–7 eV are presented in Table 2. For comparison, the lattice parameters and unit cell volume obtained from the Rietveld refined powder XRD spectrum of CsSnCl3 are also included in Table 2. As can be observed, the calculated structural parameters were found to be slightly larger than the experimentally obtained ones at all values of Ueff except for Ueff = 7 eV for which the lattice parameter and unit cell volume deviated largely from the experimental values. Moreover, within the GGA+U approximation, the calculated lattice parameters and the unit cell volume increased with the increment of Ueff from 1 to 7 eV. Notably, such a variation of the structural parameters is consistent with previous investigations of analogous materials.39,74

3.2.3 Theoretical analysis of optical properties. 
We have calculated the optical absorption coefficient of the CsSnCl3 perovskite using first-principles calculations via the GGA (Ueff = 0 eV) and GGA+U (Ueff = 1–7 eV) methods using the following equation: (4)where α(ω) is the absorption coefficient, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the frequency-dependent real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, and ω is the photon frequency.75,76 The real part of the dielectric function, ε1(ω), was evaluated from the imaginary part ε2(ω) via the Kramers–Kronig relationship.77

Fig. 7(a) demonstrates the calculated absorption coefficient of CsSnCl3 as a function of the wavelength for different values of the Hubbard Ueff parameter. It can be noticed that for all values of Ueff, the absorption peak of CsSnCl3 lies in the UV region, which is consistent with the absorbance spectrum obtained using UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 5(a)). Clearly, with the increase of Ueff, the theoretically calculated absorption coefficient spectra of CsSnCl3 undergoes a blue shift. Moreover, it is worth noticing that the trend of the coefficient spectrum calculated using Ueff = 7 eV is reasonably different from the other spectra for Ueff = 0–6 eV. Such an observation suggests that the Ueff value should be kept below 7 eV for the GGA+U approximation when determining the optical properties and electronic band structure of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals.
 Fig. 7  (a) Variation of the theoretical absorption coefficient as a function of the wavelength for different Ueff values. (b) Direct optical band gap as a function Ueff. For Ueff = 6 eV the theoretically calculated direct optical band gap matches well with the experimentally obtained direct band gap of ∼2.98 eV (marked with a square). 
Furthermore, we theoretically calculated the optical band gap of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals for different values of Ueff using the calculated absorption coefficient spectra in the Tauc relationship. The calculated direct band gap values are presented in Fig. 7(b) as a function of Ueff. It is worth noting that upon varying the Ueff values from 0 to 4 eV, we observed a nominal change in the calculated band gap. Moreover, for this range of Ueff values, i.e., for Ueff = 0–4 eV, the calculated direct band gap remained within 1.1 eV, which is significantly smaller as compared with the band gap obtained experimentally. Interestingly, the calculated band gap value increased significantly when we applied Ueff > 4 eV. As can be seen in Fig. 7(b), the direct optical band gap value of CsSnCl3 was calculated to be ∼2.69 eV for Ueff = 6 eV, which matches well with the experimental determined value of ∼2.98 eV (marked by the square in the figure). This confirms the high, i.e., 90%, accuracy of the band gap estimation using the GGA+U method in first-principles calculations. For a further increase of Ueff to 7 eV, the optical band gap increased abruptly to ∼4.4 eV, which is much higher than the experimental value. This observation implies that, among all the Ueff values used for the GGA+U approximation, Ueff = 6 eV most accurately localized the orbitals of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals.


3.2.4 Electronic band structure. 
Initially, with a view to bench-marking, we determined the electronic band structure of the CsSnCl3 perovskite using the hybrid exchange–correlation, i.e., HSE06 functional, which is illustrated in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† As shown in this figure, using this functional, the electronic band structure of CsSnCl3 was determined to be direct with a band gap value of 1.534 eV. Notably, this outcome agrees quite well with the previously reported HSE06 functional-based electronic band structure of CsSnCl3,36 and thus validates the simulation framework of the present investigation. However, this band gap value (1.534 eV) is almost 48.5% smaller than the experimentally obtained optical band gap (∼2.98 eV) of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals. Notably, according to a previous investigation,78 the electronic band gap of any material should be comparable with its optical band gap. Such an underestimation of the band gap of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals reveals the severe limitation of the HSE06 functional-based first-principles calculation for accurately analyzing the electronic band structure of related all-inorganic halide perovskites.
Therefore, furthermore, we analyzed the band structure of the CsSnCl3 perovskite using the GGA (Ueff = 0 eV) method incorporating the PBE functional as demonstrated in the ESI† (Fig. S6(a)). The dashed line between the valence and conduction bands indicates the Fermi level. As can be seen, we obtained a direct electronic band gap of 0.95 eV, which is much smaller than the direct optical band gap ∼2.98 eV of our fabricated CsSnCl3 nanocrystals as obtained via UV-visible and PL spectroscopic analyses. Hence, we may infer that the band structure formation of CsSnCl3 was erroneous for Ueff = 0 eV. Therefore, we calculated the electronic band structure via the GGA+U method with Ueff = 1–7 eV and present the results in ESI† (Fig. S6(b)–(h)). It can be clearly seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†) that for all values of Ueff, both the VBM and CBM lie at the same symmetry point R confirming the direct band structure of CsSnCl3. However, the band gap enlarged with increasing Ueff, which can be associated with the enhanced localization of the Cl 3p and Sn 5p orbitals owing to the increased Ueff. It is also worth mentioning that the calculated electronic band structure was semiconducting while the Ueff value remained within 6 eV. However, for Ueff = 7 eV, the band structure became insulating, which is contradictory with the experimental result. Therefore, we may recommend a Ueff value of 6 eV for the first-principles calculation of CsSnCl3 nanocrystals.


3.2.5 Effective mass. 
It is well known that along with the optical characteristics and the electronic band structure, the photocatalytic performance of a typical semiconductor photocatalyst is also significantly influenced by the mobility of its photogenerated electrons and holes. Hence, to gain insight into the carrier transport properties of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals, we calculated its charge carrier effective mass (m*) values using the following equation:76,79 (5)Here, E is the band-edge energy as a function of the wave-vector k and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The effective mass values of electrons  and holes  were evaluated via parabolic fitting of the E–k curve within the small region of the wave-vector near the CBM and VBM, respectively. Fig. 8 illustrates the variation of  and  of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystal as a function of Ueff. It can be observed that  did not change significantly with the increase in Ueff up to 6 eV. However, a steeper increase can be noticed in  from 2.39 m0 to 4.89 m0 between Ueff = 6 eV and Ueff = 7 eV, which suggests a decrease in curvature at the VBM. Similarly, in Fig. 8, we can observe that the change in  was not notable for an increase of Ueff up to 6 eV. However, the calculated  value significantly increased from 9.77 m0 to 12.64 m0 when we applied Ueff = 7 eV, which can be attributed to the decrease in the curvature of the CBM. Such a variation trend again justifies that it would be rational to consider Ueff below 7 eV for the CsSnCl3 perovskite.
 Fig. 8  Variation of the absolute effective masses of holes and electrons in terms of the electron rest mass, m0, with an increase in Ueff value. 
Typically, a lower effective mass of a semiconductor results in a higher transportability of photogenerated charge carriers from its bulk to the surface, which can mitigate the recombination of e−–h+ pairs and, thus, enhance the photocatalytic activity. In order to gain a deep insight into the recombination rate within photocatalysts, a number of previous investigations80,81 have defined the ratio of the effective mass of the electron to the hole using the following formula: (6)Notably, the aforementioned investigations have reported that materials with “D” values much greater than 1 demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activities.80 Interestingly, in this present investigation, the “D” value of the CsSnCl3 perovskite can be calculated as 0.25 for Ueff = 6 eV, which is much smaller than 1. However, despite possessing such a small “D” value, our as-synthesized CsSnCl3 nanocrystals exhibited a notable photocatalytic performance without the assistance of any co-catalyst or reagents under both visible and UV-visible irradiation (Fig. 6(c)). Based on these outcomes, it can be inferred that as the  value is larger than  in CsSnCl3, a “D” value much smaller than 1 indicates a large difference in its electron and hole mobility, which facilitated the separation of photoexcited e−–h+ pairs, inhibited recombination and consequently enhanced the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to propose a modification for the interpretation of eqn (6) as follows. A “D” value either much smaller or much larger than 1 is an indication of a low recombination rate and a high photocatalytic efficiency. For clarification, it should be mentioned here that for CsSnCl3, since a Ueff value of 6 eV most accurately determined the optical band gap and electronic band structure, hence, we used the effective masses obtained for Ueff = 6 eV to evaluate the “D” value.


3.2.6 Density of states. 
The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) for the Cs 6s, Sn 5p, and Cl 3p orbitals of the CsSnCl3 perovskite were determined using the GGA (Ueff = 0 eV) and GGA+U (Ueff = 1–7 eV) methods to resolve each individual orbital's contribution to its electronic bands. The TDOS and PDOS obtained for Ueff = 0–7 eV are illustrated in Fig. 9(a)–(h), respectively. As can be seen in these figures, for all values of Ueff, the valence band (E – EF < 0 eV) of CsSnCl3 is made up of the hybridization of Cl 3p and Sn 5p orbitals with the major contribution from Cl 3p states. On the other hand, the conduction band (E – EF > 0 eV) had primarily the characteristics of the Sn 5p orbital with a minor contribution from Cs 6s. It should be mentioned that for Ueff = 0–4 eV, the other orbital states of CsSnCl3 also contributed to form the TDOSs lying at the high-energy region, i.e., from 4 eV to 6 eV, along with the Cs 6s, Sn 5p, and Cl 3p orbitals. However, to keep the figures simple and understandable, we did not demonstrate the contribution from the other orbitals. Furthermore, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 9(a) to (h), with the increase of Ueff from 1 to 7 eV, the conduction band shifted to a higher energy resulting in an enlargement of the band gap. Interestingly, at Ueff = 7 eV (Fig. 9(h)), we observed that the computed PDOS for the Cl 3p orbital was significantly different from the PDOSs calculated for other Ueff values, which is another indication for the limitation of Ueff > 6 eV for explaining the electronic band structure of the CsSnCl3 perovskite accurately.

3.2.7 Electron charge density. 
The electron charge density distribution of the CsSnCl3 perovskite may provide valuable information about its chemical bonding characteristics. Hence, we determined the charge density map of CsSnCl3 along the (110) plane using the GGA (Ueff = 0 eV) and GGA+U (Ueff = 3, 6 and 7 eV) methods and illustrated the result in Fig. 10. It is well known that when the electron clouds from two atoms overlap with each other and the electrons concentrate in the overlapping region, a covalent bond is formed between them.82 In Fig. 10(a) to (d), a significant overlapping of electron clouds can be noticed between Sn and Cl atoms, which confirms the formation of the sigma-type Sn–Cl covalent bond in the CsSnCl3 perovskite.83 As illustrated by the DOS plots in Fig. 9, the charge sharing between Sn and Cl can be associated with the hybridization of the Sn 5p and Cl 3p orbitals.
 Fig. 10  Electronic charge density along (110) plane of CsSnCl3 for (a) Ueff = 0 eV, (b) Ueff = 3 eV, (c) Ueff = 6 eV, and (d) Ueff = 7 eV. 
For a deeper insight into the chemical bonding nature, we performed Mulliken population analysis and calculated the effective atomic charge, bond population and bond length in the as-synthesized CsSnCl3 crystal structure. The results are explained in detail in the ESI.† Notably, our analysis demonstrated that the degree of bond covalency in CsSnCl3 reduces with increasing Ueff due to the enhanced effect of the on-site Coulomb interaction.

4 Conclusions
We have demonstrated a rapid, facile hot-injection technique for the synthesis of lead-free non-toxic CsSnCl3 perovskite nanocrystals that have a high structural stability over a wide temperature range and excellent crystallinity. The as-synthesized CsSnCl3 perovskite exhibited a photocatalytic performance without using any reagent under both visible and UV-visible irradiation owing to its direct band structure and favorable band edge positions. Furthermore, density functional theory-based analysis provided a deeper insight at the atomic level regarding the optical absorption properties, electronic band structure, charge carrier effective masses and electron charge density of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals. The outcome of our theoretical analysis revealed the significance of considering the effect of the on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction energy in the GGA+U approximation. Notably, when a Hubbard Ueff correction parameter of 6 eV was employed, the GGA+U method incorporated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof gradient functional provided results with almost 90% accuracy in the band gap estimation considering the experimentally obtained band gap. This is much higher compared with the conventional Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid exchange–correlation functional that showed 51.5% accuracy to estimate the optical band gap. Moreover, the ratio of the theoretically calculated effective masses of the hole and electron (“D”) of the CsSnCl3 nanocrystals shed light into the rationale behind their satisfactory photocatalytic performance, which led us to propose a new interpretation of the “D” value. We have suggested that a low photogenerated charge-carrier recombination rate, and hence a high photocatalytic activity, can be predicted for materials with a “D” value either much larger or smaller than 1. The outcome of this investigation might be useful for the theoretical analysis of related halide perovskites in which the on-site Coulomb interaction energy is expected to play a vital role. Moreover, the demonstrated rapid hot-injection technique might be effectively employed to synthesize analogous all-inorganic halide perovskites with excellent structural stability and crystallinity.
