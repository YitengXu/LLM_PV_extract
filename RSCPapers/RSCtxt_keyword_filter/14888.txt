    , Accepted 15th April 2011First published on 31st May 2011AbstractLow-dimensional nanomaterials have brilliant potential applications in a lot of fields. The surface of nanomaterials plays an important role in their applications. Under many circumstances, surface modification of nanomaterials is needed to endow them with novel or improved properties. Although the surface modification of inorganic one-dimensional nanomaterials by organic molecules can be easily achieved, decoration on the surface of organic semiconductor one-dimensional nanomaterials by organic molecules has not been reported yet. The harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature, acid or alkaline catalysis for the surface modification of inorganic materials will do harm to organic semiconductors and are not suitable. So the surface modification of organic semiconductor one-dimensional nanomaterials is still a big challenge. We report here the surface treatment of polymer semiconductor nanowires by alkylsilanes with different end groups. By selection of the appropriate alkylsilane, we can either modify the surface of polymer semiconductor nanowires with a self-assembled monolayer or adjust the shape of the nanowires to nanoparticles. The surface-modified polymer semiconductor nanowires show improved device performance when used in organic optoelectronic devices. Consequently, our results will open a way for the surface modification and shape adjustment of organic semiconductor one-dimensional nanomaterials, which is highly desired for their future applications in catalysis or nanodevices.
Introduction
Low-dimensional (including zero- and one-dimensional) nanomaterials have attracted much attention during recent years for their potential applications in highly efficient catalysis,1–3 bio-labeling,4,5 nonlinear optics,6,7 chemical sensors,8,9 information storage,10 and nanoscale electronic devices.11,12 Zero-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanoparticles have large surface-to-volume ratios which are highly desirable for catalysis and chemical/gas sensing.13 In addition, they can exhibit size-dependent optoelectronic properties.14,15 One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanorods (NRs), nanotubes and nanowires (NWs), can form arrays or networks which are essential for building integrated nanodevices.16,17 Up to now, most of the reported applications of low-dimensional nanomaterials are based on inorganic materials. In comparison with inorganic ones, organic nanomaterials provide more advantages in price, multiformity, flexibility and processibility. So many efforts have been made to explore the usage of organic low-dimensional nanomaterials in biological labels,18,19 chemical sensors,20–22 catalysis materials,23 and especially in optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes,24–26 organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).27–34
As far as optoelectronic devices are concerned, one-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials are expected to play an important role in improving the device performance. They can act as building blocks for efficient charge carrier transportation in devices. When the one-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials are employed either in optoelectronic devices or in catalysis, the interface between the nanomaterial and the surroundings is crucial for charge injection, transfer and separation. Due to the importance of such an interface, many efforts have been made to modify the surface of nanomaterials either to improve its contact properties or to endow it with a new function.35–39
Currently, most of the surface modifications were achieved only for inorganic nanomaterials since they can endure harsh reaction conditions such as acidic or alkaline conditions, organic solvent, and high temperature. However, in the case of organic semiconductor nanomaterials, acidic, alkaline and high temperature conditions will do harm to the optical or electrical properties of the conjugated compounds and an improper choice of organic solvent may dissolve the nanomaterials. Consequently, surface modification of one-dimensional organic nanomaterials has rarely been reported. Recently, inorganic nanocrystals have been utilized to modify the surface of polymer semiconductor NWs, thus providing an organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructure.40,41 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, surface modification of one-dimensional polymer semiconductor nanomaterials by organic molecules has never been reported yet. If the surface can be modified by organic molecules, its properties can be effectively altered and controlled thanks to the different functional groups in organic molecules. As a result, surface modification of one-dimensional organic semiconductor nanomaterials by organic molecules is urgently desired.
Nanomaterials with different shapes can exhibit various optical and electronic properties,14,15,42 which is of both fundamental and technological interest. In optoelectronic nanodevices, one-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials can show good carrier-transporting ability and light polarization properties while zero-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials can show high sensing and catalytic ability, size-dependent luminescence, and unique electronic properties such as Coulomb blockade. Therefore, the device performance can be tuned and novel multifunctional optoelectronic nanodevices can be fabricated provided that the shape transformation between zero- and one-dimensional nanomaterials is achieved. Currently, transformation of nanoparticles to NWs or NRs has been widely reported for both inorganic and organic materials.43–46 In the reverse case, shape transformations from NWs/NRs to nanoparticles are only available for inorganic materials by methods such as laser photothermal melting,47,48 hydrothermal treatment,49,50 and catalyst-assisted redox etching.51,52 However, high-energy laser pulses, high temperature, or strong acid are employed in these methods which are unsuitable for the shape adjustment of organic semiconductor NWs/NRs since these conditions may cause the conjugated π-bonds to be broken or the functional groups to be oxidized in their molecules. Up to now, no effective way has been reported yet to adjust the shape of organic semiconductor NWs/NRs.
In this paper, we achieved the surface modification of polymer semiconductor NWs with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) composed of alkylsilane molecules. By proper selection of the alkylsilane molecules, the shape of polymer semiconductor NWs can remain unchanged or be adjusted to nanoparticles depending on the functional end groups of the alkylsilane molecules. Organic optoelectronic devices including OSCs and OFETs based on the SAM-modified polymer semiconductor NWs are fabricated, which show improved open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and carrier mobility compared with the unmodified ones. Our results provide a simple method for the surface modification and the shape adjustment of organic semiconductor NWs/NRs, which will be advantageous for the potential application of organic low-dimensional nanomaterials in optoelectronic nanodevices.
Experimental
Materials and instruments
The polymer semiconductor used in our experiments is poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with 98% regioregularity purchased from Beijing Synwit Technology Co., Ltd. (3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APS), trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FTS), octyltrimethoxysilane (OTMOS), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) solution, and titanium(IV) isopropoxide (99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich company. Heptane, p-xylene, and isopropanol of analytical pure grade were used as solvents in the experiments. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (99%, purchased from Beijing Synwit Technology Co., Ltd) served as the electron acceptor to fabricate the OSC devices.
The photoluminescence (PL) and ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectra were collected with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer and a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer, respectively. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained from a Veeco DI Dimension V atomic force microscope operating in the tapping mode. The infrared (IR) transmission measurements were conducted on a Bruker IFS 66v/S Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. The film thickness was measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope.

          Growth of P3HT nanowires and treatment by alkylsilanes

          P3HT (12.5 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml p-xylene after heating at 90 °C for 30 min. Then this solution was naturally cooled down to room temperature. After that, this solution was stored in a refrigerator below 7 °C for 30 min. When taken out, the solution became very glutinous and exhibited a reddish-brown color. After ultrasonication at 25 °C for 10 min, P3HT NWs were well dispersed in the solution.
For the treatment of P3HT NWs, alkylsilanes diluted in heptane were added into the P3HT NW solution. In the resultant solution, the volume ratio of heptane to p-xylene was kept as 1:10 and the concentration of alkylsilanes (APS, FTS, OTMOS) was 1 mM. The corresponding solution was denoted as P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS, and P3HT-OTMOS, respectively. For FTS treated P3HT NW solution, another concentration of FTS (0.2 mM) was prepared (denoted as P3HT-FTS(0.2)). To exclude the influence of heptane on P3HT NWs, we also prepared a control solution with pure heptane added into the P3HT NW solution (denoted as P3HT-hep) and the volume ratio of heptane to p-xylene was also kept as 1:10. After thorough mixing, the solutions were allowed to stand for two days at room temperature to finish the surface treatment of P3HT NWs. It should be noted that higher temperature will speed up the surface-treating process but will also be disadvantageous to the shape preserving of P3HT NWs since high temperature will cause dissolution of NWs.
For the PL and UV spectra measurement, the P3HT solution was spin-coated on a quartz substrate to form a thin film with the same thickness. For IR spectra and AFM measurement, the P3HT solutions were spin-coated on CaF2 and silicon substrates, respectively. Before TEM measurement, the P3HT solutions were drop-cast on the surface of copper grids, and then the samples were stained with phosphotungstic acid.
Device fabrication and characterization

          OFET devices were fabricated on n+-doped silicon (serving as a gate electrode) substrates with a 303 nm SiO2 insulating layer. The P3HT NW films were deposited by spin-coating and the source (S)-drain (D) top electrodes were formed by vacuum deposition of gold. The OFET device has a channel length of 80 μm and channel width of 8.8 mm. The characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS Semiconductor Characterization System. All of the measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
PCBM acting as the electron acceptor was introduced into the P3HT-hep and P3HT-APS solution with a weight ratio of 0.8:1 to P3HT NWs. OSC devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω/sq. The ITO glass was cleaned by detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, respectively. The PEDOT:PSS and isopropanol mixture (2:1, v/v) filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was spin-coated on ITO surface to form a 30 nm-thick film. Thereafter, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 15 min to remove the residual solvents. Subsequently, the photoactive layer was deposited under ambient atmosphere from the P3HT-hep:PCBM or P3HT-APS:PCBM solution by spin-coating. On this layer, a TiOx covering layer was formed by spin-coating the titanium(IV) isopropoxide solution (1 vol.% in isopropanol). Finally, aluminum (Al) was deposited as the cathode by vacuum thermal evaporation under a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the OSC devices is 4 mm2. Before photovoltaic measurements, the OSC devices were annealed at 80 °C for 15 min on a hotplate. This value is below the glass transition temperature of P3HT,53 so the shape of P3HT NWs can remain. The current density−voltage (J − V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. Device characterization was done in a glove box under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport Co., LTD.).
Results and discussion

Spectroscopy and morphology analysis of P3HT NWs treated by alkylsilanes

Fig. 1 shows the PL and absorption spectra of films with the same thickness spin-coated from the P3HT-hep, P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS, and P3HT-OTMOS solution, respectively. All these films show the same emission peak at 640 nm with a shoulder at about 690 nm, which can be ascribed to the emission of aggregates and well-organized structures in P3HT domains, respectively.54 Films deposited from the P3HT-APS and P3HT-OTMOS solutions exhibit a similar emission intensity as the one from the control solution. However, the film obtained from the P3HT-FTS solution shows a much lower PL intensity. Since the fluoro group in the FTS molecule has a strong electron-withdrawing ability, an intermolecular charge-transfer state can be formed when FTS comes into contact with the electron-donating P3HT molecule. Such a charge-transfer state will lead to a decreased fluorescent emission.55 As for APS and OTMOS, they have little influence on the PL emission of P3HT due to the absence of electron-withdrawing groups in their molecules. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1b, all of the four films exhibit similar absorption curves with three peaks in the visible light region, which are located at 529, 560, and 610 nm, respectively, corresponding to the π − π* transition of the conjugated P3HT structure. Only the absorbance is influenced by the alkylsilanes. It can be seen that FTS can enhance the absorbance of P3HT; on the contrary, APS and OTMOS can decrease the absorbance of P3HT.

It should be noted that the absorption peak at 610 nm is a characteristic absorption band for P3HT nanostructures which indicates a higher degree of ordering in the polymer chains.56,57 Nevertheless, both nanoparticles and NWs/NRs of P3HT may cause the occurrence of this characteristic absorption peak.30,58–60 To elucidate which kind of nanostructure has been formed in the film, the surface morphology of these films is analyzed by AFM measurement. Fig. 2 shows the height and phase images of the films deposited from P3HT-hep, P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS(0.2), P3HT-FTS, and P3HT-OTMOS solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2a, dense P3HT NWs with the average length about 320 nm and the diameter about 30 nm were obtained in the absence of alkylsilanes. When APS is employed to treat P3HT NWs, as illustrated in Fig. 2b, the shape of NWs can remain little changed. Whereas, when P3HT NWs are treated by FTS and OTMOS, they undergo a shape transformation from nanorods to nanoparticles (see Fig. 2c–2e). The concentration of FTS in the P3HT NW solution plays an important role in the adjustment of the NW shape. When the amount of FTS is little, which is the case in P3HT-FTS(0.2) solution, the P3HT NWs have been fragmented into smaller NRs with an average length of ∼110 nm and thickened diameter of ∼40 nm. As the amount of FTS increases, the shape of P3HT NWs can be eventually transformed into nanoparticles with various sizes (see Fig. 2d). OTMOS shows a similar phenomenon as FTS for treating P3HT NWs, which will also transform P3HT NWs to nanoparticles (shown in Fig. 2e).

Combined with the optical property and morphology analysis, it is clear that the alkylsilanes do have interactions with P3HT NWs. There are two possible ways for alkylsilanes to interact with P3HT NWs: either by physical adsorption through intermolecular forces or by chemical bond formation. It was reported that alkylsilanes such as FTS, octyltrichlorosilane, and (aminopropyl)triethoxysilane can form SAMs on the film surface of organic materials including single crystal organic semiconductors, conjugated polymers, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) by means of chemical bonds.61–64 To validate the existence of alkylsilanes in the P3HT nano-structured films, IR transmission spectra of these films were measured. Unfortunately, we didn't observe any difference in the spectra between the pure P3HT NWs and the alkylsilane treated ones. The reason may be that most of the excess alkylsilane molecules which didn't bind to the surface of P3HT NWs or nanoparticles have gone with the solvent during the spin-coating process for film deposition. Moreover, the amount of alkylsilane molecules existing on the surface of P3HT NWs or nanoparticles in the thin film does not reach the lowest limit of detection with IR measurement. If the alkylsilane molecules can come into contact with more P3HT molecules, the probability for their interaction may increase and more alkylsilane molecules should remain in the film. Consequently, the P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS, P3HT-OTMOS, and the control solution (P3HT-hep) have been heated up to 70 °C for 30 min to dissolve the P3HT nanostructure into a molecular dispersed state, thus ensuring an adequate contact between alkylsilane and P3HT molecules.

Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of films deposited from the heat-treated P3HT-hep, P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS, and P3HT-OTMOS solutions. As far as the pure P3HT film (obtained from the P3HT-hep solution) is concerned, the peaks at 1377, 1452, and 1510 cm−1 can be assigned to the CH3 symmetrical bending, CH2 bending (scissoring mode), and out-/in-phase CC stretching vibration in P3HT molecules, respectively.65 In addition, the peaks at 2855, 2924, 2954, and 3055 cm−1 correspond to the CH2 symmetrical stretching, CH2 asymmetrical stretching, CH3 asymmetrical stretching, and C–H stretching bands of P3HT, respectively.65 The APS-containing P3HT film shows additional vibration bands with peaks at 1030 and 1120 cm−1 originating from Si–O stretching, 1194 cm−1 from C–N stretching, 1330 cm−1 from C–N stretching, 1560 cm−1 from N–H deformation, and 1615–1660 cm−1 from NH2 scissoring.66–69 However, films obtained from heat-treated P3HT-FTS and P3HT-OTMOS solutions do not exhibit any distinct difference compared with the pure P3HT film. As a result, we can deduce that APS reacts with P3HT molecules and binds to them through chemical bonds, giving detectable IR vibration bands of APS in the film. But FTS and OTMOS do not react with P3HT molecules, so most of their molecules are gone with the solvent during the film deposition process. There are two possible ways for APS to bind to P3HT: hydrogen bonding through the amino group and chemical bonding viasilyloxy linkage. We do not think the former way is dominant in the P3HT-APS system since the P3HT molecule lacks good hydrogen bond acceptors such as fluorine, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. The most possible binding group in APS is the trimethoxysilyl group, which can form the Si–O–C linkage between APS and P3HT after hydrolysis. This binding process is similar to the way FTS molecules bind to the surface of rubrene single crystal and P3HT film reported by others.61,63 Since APS has a hydrophilic –NH2group at the chain end, water molecules from the air can thus be introduced into the hydrophobic P3HT p-xylene solution and immobilized by the amino group. In addition, the catalytic activity of basic amino groups will be beneficial to the hydrolysis of the trimethoxysilyl group in APS as the hydrolysis process usually needs a basic/acidic catalyst. Consequently, the reaction between APS and P3HT is facilitated. In contrast, because the alkyl group in OTMOS and fluoro group in FTS are strongly hydrophobic, water molecules in air have little chance to be immobilized on FTS or OTMOS molecules in the p-xylene solution. Consequently, the hydrolysis of the trichlorosilyl group in FTS and the trimethoxysilyl group in OTMOS cannot happen. As a result, no chemical bond is formed between FTS, OTMOS and P3HT molecules.

IR spectra of films spin-coated from the heat-treated P3HT-hep, P3HT-APS, P3HT-FTS and P3HT-OTMOS solution. These solutions were heated at 70 °C for half an hour and then cooled down to room temperature before spin-coating. 

Fig. 4 shows the possible mechanism for the shape transformation process when P3HT NWs are treated by alkylsilanes. As far as FTS and OTMOS are concerned, due to their strong hydrophobic nature, water molecules from the air can hardly be kept in the hydrophobic solution. Since FTS has a strong electron-withdrawing ability and OTMOS has a long alkyl chain similar to the side chain of P3HT, weak intermolecular forces including charge-transfer interaction for FTS and van der Waals forces for OTMOS drive them to be adsorbed on the surface of P3HT NWs. The FTS and OTMOS molecules must lie flat on the surface of P3HT NWs from a consideration of energy. However, such a coverage is not firm and desorption of alkylsilanes may also happen. Because P3HT is slightly soluble in p-xylene at room temperature, p-xylene molecules can create cleavage sites on P3HT NWs at the region without alkylsilane coverage. The cleavage then can be filled by adsorption of alkylsilanes. By repeating this desorption-cleavage-resorption process, a P3HT NW can be fragmented into several smaller ones. If the concentration of alkylsilanes is increased, the fragments of P3HT NWs can be further divided. Finally, P3HT nanoparticles with different sizes are obtained (see Fig. 4a). In the case of APS, water molecules from the air can be bound to the amino end group of APS molecules through hydrogen bonds in the hydrophobic solution. These water molecules and the basic amino groups do favors to the hydrolysis of the trimethoxysilyl group in APS. The hydrolyzed APS molecules can react with P3HT. As a result, a compact SAM can be formed, which binds to the surface of P3HT NWs through chemical bonds. In the SAM, APS links to P3HT molecules by the silyloxy group and with the hydrophilic amino group towards the solvent. Such a firm SAM will prohibit the cleavage of P3HT NWs by the solvent. As a result, the shape of NWs still remains after the modification by APS (see Fig. 4b).

Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of P3HT films deposited from the P3HT-hep and P3HT-APS solution, respectively. It can be seen that dense one-dimensional NWs exist in the pure P3HT films (Fig. 5a). After APS treatment, P3HT still exhibits dense NW structures which means its shape remains little changed (Fig. 5b).

Application of SAM-modified P3HT NWs in organic optoelectronic devices

Fig. 6 shows the output and transfer characteristics of OFETs based on pure P3HT NWs and APS-modified P3HT NWs. These devices exhibit a typical p-type FET behavior, which means the transporting carriers in the channel are holes. Clear linear and saturated regimes can be seen from the output curves. From the transfer curves we can calculate the field-effect mobility (μ) by using the following equation in the saturation regime: (1) where IDS is the drain current, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator, VGS is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold voltage. OFETs based on APS-modified P3HT NWs show a hole mobility of 6.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1, an on/off ratio of 102, and a VT of 6 V. Those values for pure P3HT NWs based OFETs are 5.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1, 48, and 10 V, respectively. Higher carrier mobility, larger on/off ratio and lower threshold voltage are desired for high-performance OFETs. So the APS modification of P3HT NWs is beneficial to the improvement of OFET performances. It is well known that P3HT can readily be oxygen-doped in the air, leading to an increased conduction but reduced carrier mobility.70,71 However, as discussed above, the modification of P3HT NWs by APS can form a compact SAM on the surface, which can act as a protection layer against the air and weaken the oxygen-doping of P3HT NWs. As a result, the device performance is improved by using APS-modified P3HT NWs.

Fig. 7 shows the J – V curves of OSC devices with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT NWs:PCBM (∼70 nm)/TiOx (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/APS-modified P3HT NWs:PCBM (∼70 nm)/TiOx (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) under AM 1.5 G irradiation. In the devices, ITO acts as the anode and Al serves as the cathode. The PEDOT:PSS and TiOx layers were employed to enhance the hole and electron extraction from the photoactive layer, respectively.72,73 It can be seen that the modification of P3HT NWs by APS has an advantageous impact on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. The short circuit current, open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiency of OSCs based on APS-modified P3HT NWs are 7.6 mA cm−2, 0.53 V and 1.25%, respectively, which are higher than those of the unmodified ones (the corresponding values are 5.2 mA cm−2, 0.46 V and 1.22%).

Such improvements can be attributed to the following three reasons. The first is that the APS SAM on the surface of P3HT NWs can protect the separated charges from recombination. Once the photoinduced excitons in P3HT are dissociated to holes and electrons at the donor/acceptor interface, electrons can easily go through the SAM by means of tunneling under the help of internal electric fields in devices.74 Moreover, the inverse carrier recombination process between the charge-separated electrons and holes can be effectively prohibited by the SAM.75,76 As a result, the efficiency for charge separation has been improved, leading to the increase in Jsc and Voc. The second is that the amino end group of APS located at the outside of the SAM may react with fullerenes to form a compact contact interface. It has been reported that the amino group in APS and in other compounds such as aminopolymers can couple to fullerene by addition to its double bonds at room temperature or under mild reaction conditions.77–79 So the coupling of the amino group of APS to PCBM may also occur in our SAM-modified devices, providing a sufficient contact interface between P3HT NWs and PCBM molecules. Consequently, more carriers should be generated under illumination, causing the improvement of Jsc. The last reason is that APS-modified P3HT NWs have a higher hole mobility than the unmodified ones as mentioned above. Therefore, more mobile carriers can be collected within their life time, giving an increase in Jsc. We notice that the power conversion efficiencies of our devices are not very high, as can be attributed to the film thickness of the photoactive layer being too thin (only ∼70 nm). As a result, the absorption of light is not sufficient. The thin thickness of the photoactive layer in the spin-coated film is related to the low concentration of P3HT NWs in p-xylene solution. The concentration can hardly be further increased in our experiment; otherwise, P3HT NWs will flocculate in the solution. If some new methods for depositing thick and uniform NW films from the dilute solution are explored, light absorption in these NWs based OSC will be enhanced and the power conversion efficiency will be largely improved. Such a study is currently underway.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have used alkylsilanes with different end groups to treat the NWs of a polymer semiconductor. Surface modification of polymer semiconductor NWs by organic materials has been achieved for the first time. The alkylsilane with a hydrophilic amino group (APS) can modify the surface of P3HT NWs via chemical bonds and the shape of NWs can remain. The surface-modified P3HT NWs by APS were employed to fabricate organic optoelectronic devices including OFETs and OSCs. Improved device performances have been realized by using surface-modified P3HT NWs. Moreover, by exposing to alkylsilanes with hydrophobic end groups (FTS and OTMOS), P3HT NWs can be transformed to smaller fragments, then to nanoparticles. So both surface modification and shape adjustment of P3HT NWs are achieved depending on the end groups of alkylsilanes. Our results will be beneficial to the potential application of organic low-dimensional nanomaterials in areas such as optoelectronic nanodevices and catalysis.
