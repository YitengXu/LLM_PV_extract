    , Accepted 7th November 2017First published on 7th November 2017AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, phosphorene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphitic zinc oxide (g-ZnO) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, e.g., MoS2), have already attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding properties and wide range of applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In particular, 2D van der Waals heterojunctions combining the electronic structures of such 2D materials have also been predicted theoretically and synthesized experimentally to expect more new properties (e.g., bandgap opening in graphene, semiconductor band alignment, charge transfer and new optical absorption) and potential applications (e.g., solar cells, field-effect transistors (FFTs), PN junctions, PN diodes and photodetectors) far beyond corresponding 2D materials. This review focuses on recent theoretical works about 2D van der Waals heterojunctions especially for functional materials and devices such as photovoltaic solar cells (phosphorene/MoS2 and edge-modified phosphorene nanoflake based heterojunctions), Schottky and Ohmic contacts (graphene/MoS2 based heterojunctions), PN junctions (graphene/g-ZnO based heterojunctions) and supercapacitors (graphene/h-BN based heterojunctions). These theoretical simulations and designs of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions provide a promising direction for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices in experiments.
1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials1–3 have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding properties and wide range of applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices, including graphene,4–6 silicene,7–9 phosphorene,10–13 hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),14–16 graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4),17–19 graphitic zinc oxide (g-ZnO)20–22 and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).23–25
Looking beyond this field, many types of 2D van der Waals heterojunction26–30 combining the electronic structures of such 2D materials have also been predicted theoretically and synthesized experimentally to explore more new properties and potential applications far beyond corresponding single components. The van der Waals interlayer coupling in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions is weak at the interface, and not only induces new properties, such as bandgap opening in graphene,31 semiconductor band alignment,32 charge transfer33 and new optical absorption,34 but also preserves the intrinsic properties of corresponding 2D materials. 2D van der Waals heterojunctions with these new properties can be used to fabricate novel electronic and optoelectronic applications of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions in experiment, such as solar cells,35–40 field-effect transistors (FFTs),41–45 PN junctions,46,47 PN diodes48,49 and photodetectors,50–52 as summarized in Table 1.

Heterojunction solar cells are the most important optoelectronic devices of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions in both theory and experiment. From a theoretical perspective, many more types of 2D van der Waals heterojunction than those used in experiment have been designed theoretically as highly-efficient heterojunction solar cells, such as graphene/BN,53 graphene/MoS2,54 MoS2/MoSe2,55 MoS2/g-C3N4,56 and phosphorene/MoS2.57 Such theoretical simulations and designs can be used to not only figure out the intrinsic physical mechanism of the heterojunction solar cells fabricated in experiment, but also to predict new types of 2D van der Waals heterojunction with high power conversion efficiencies. One important feature of 2D materials used in heterojunction solar cells is their large photoreactive contact area for absorbing sunlight. Furthermore, 2D van der Waals heterojunctions with interlayer interaction34 and charge transfer33 at the heterojunction interface can further enhance sunlight capture.58 Such 2D van der Waals heterojunctions have unique atomic structures, showing high stability due to strong covalent bonds inside each 2D monolayer, but relatively weak van der Waals interactions to keep them stacked together with their intrinsic optoelectronic properties preserved. Notice that 2D materials also show the same tunable optoelectronic properties, such as ideal band gap, high carrier mobility and strong visible light absorption, as donor and acceptor semiconductors used in heterojunction solar cells.
In the present review, we focus on recent theoretical studies on 2D van der Waals heterojunctions for functional materials and devices using first-principles density functional theory calculations. 2D van der Waals heterojunctions show many more new properties far beyond their single components, which can be used to design potential applications of photovoltaic solar cells, Schottky and Ohmic contacts, PN junctions and supercapacitors. Here we also discuss structural models for constructing the atomic structures of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions and computational methods for computing the electronic structures of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, to help study the structural and optoelectronic properties of new types of 2D van der Waals heterojunction in theory and in experiment in the future.
2 Structural models
Constructing atomic structures of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions made layer by layer is the first challenge to studying their electronic structures, because a special supercell heterostructure is required for at least two types of 2D monolayer with different lattice constants, stacking one 2D monolayer on top of another one. This special supercell is chosen to make the lattice mismatch between the two different 2D monolayers as small as possible. Hu et al.30 have recently developed a method and written a small program named LatticeMatch to construct theoretical models of atomic structures for 2D van der Waals heterojunctions with a small lattice mismatch for different 2D monolayers. LatticeMatch is based on the rotation matrix of extended supercells in orthogonal lattices for different 2D monolayers to compute the optimal minimum lattice-match supercell models for 2D van der Waals heterojunctions. This LatticeMatch method has been successfully applied to study several 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, such as graphene/phosphorene59 and phosphorene/MoS2.60
3 Computational methods
First-principles density functional theory (DFT)61,62 is a powerful tool to study the structural, electronic and optical properties of 2D materials and 2D van der Waals heterojunctions. The accuracy of DFT calculations depends strongly on the choice of the exchange and correlation functionals. Semi-local exchange–correlation functionals in the DFT calculations, such as the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE),63 are widely used to predict the geometric structures of 2D materials and can obtain reliable lattice constants compared to experimental measurements. However, such semi-local GGA-PBE calculations fail to adequately describe the long-range weak van der Waals interactions in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions. Fortunately, several weak van der Waals correction methods have been developed to calculate the equilibrium interfacial distance and binding energy between two 2D monolayers in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, such as the semi-empirical long-range dispersion correction (DFT-D) proposed by Grimme et al.64 and the non-empirical van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) scheme proposed by Dion et al.65 On the other hand, semi-local GGA-PBE calculations are less reliable in predicting electronic structures of 2D materials and 2D van der Waals heterojunctions due to the lack of the long-range non-local Hartree–Fock exchange interaction in the DFT calculations. Hybrid density functionals, such as B3LYP,66 PBE067 and HSE,68 have already been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of DFT calculations by incorporating a fraction of the Hartree–Fock exchange interaction in hybrid DFT calculations. In particular, hybrid DFT calculations with the HSE06 functional69 have been widely used to predict accurate electronic structures of 2D materials and 2D van der Waals heterojunctions.
To study the electron and hole doping in graphene, the charge carrier (electron or hole) concentration of doping graphene in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions can be estimated by the linear dispersion around the Dirac point of graphene6 (1)where ΔED is the energy shift of the Dirac point of graphene (ED) relative to the Fermi level (EF) in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, that is ΔED = ED − EF. It can be seen that the intrinsic charge carrier concentration of graphene at room temperature70 is about n = πkB2T2/6ħνF2 = 6 × 1010 cm−2.
To study the optical properties of 2D materials and 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, the frequency-dependent dielectric matrix is computed using the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory.71 The imaginary part of the dielectric matrix is determined by a summation over states as (2)where Ω is the volume of the primitive cell, wk is the k point weight, c and v are the conduction and valence band states, respectively, εck and μck are the eigenvalues and wavefunctions at the k point, respectively, and eα and eβ are the unit vectors for the Cartesian directions. The absorption coefficient is evaluated according to the frequency-dependent dielectric function. In order to accurately calculate the optical properties of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions, finer regular grids for the surface Brillouin zone and a larger number of conduction band states (three times larger than the number of valence band) and frequency grid points are adopted compared to conventional electronic structure calculations.
To study potential applications in photovoltaic solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is used to characterize the quality of heterojunction solar cells defined as53 (3)where 0.65 is the band-fill factor, P(ħϖ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ħϖ, Eg is the bandgap of the donor, ΔEc is the conduction band offset, and the (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is an estimation of the maximum open circuit voltage.
4 Functional materials and devices
In this section, we review recent works about 2D van der Waals heterojunctions for functional materials and devices using first principles DFT calculations. We focus on the applications of these areas, including in photovoltaic solar cells, Schottky and Ohmic contacts, PN junctions and supercapacitors.
4.1 Photovoltaic solar cells
Heterojunctions consisting of two types of donor and acceptor semiconductor have been demonstrated as promising mechanisms for designing photovoltaic solar cells.72–74 Choosing two different types of semiconductor for the donor and acceptor respectively makes it possible to effectively separate charge carriers at the heterojunction interface. The behavior of heterojunction solar cells depends crucially on the alignment of the energy bands of the donor and acceptor semiconductors at the interface. These types of semiconductor heterojunction solar cells are different from those based on Schottky contacts and PN junctions consisting of semiconductor and metal heterojunctions. There are at least three types of band alignment for heterojunction solar cells, as shown in Fig. 1, including straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) and broken gap (type III). In particular, the type-II donor–acceptor interface band heterojunctions can easily promote electron and hole carrier transfer and separation at the interface, which can significantly enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells.

For donor and acceptor semiconductors used in heterojunction solar cells, there are several crucial factors for absorbing sunlight, such as a small direct band gap of roughly 1.2–1.6 eV to absorb wide range sunlight72 and a high carrier mobility to facilitate efficient transport. Furthermore, the performance of heterojunction solar cells depends critically on the choice of donor and acceptor semiconductors with different VBM and CBM band positions (eqn (3)).73 Recently, several 2D monolayer semiconductors have been proposed as potential candidates to be used in photovoltaic solar cells and photocatalytic water splitting, such as g-C3N4,17–19 MoS276–78 and phosphorene.10–13 Such 2D semiconductors have large photoreactive contact areas for light absorption and photocatalytic reactions. The small distance between the photogenerated electrons and holes allows them to reach the interface more rapidly for photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, g-C3N434, MoS2,79 and phosphorene80 display superior optical properties for strong optical absorption near the infrared region of sunlight. Therefore, heterojunction solar cells consisting of such 2D monolayer semiconductors should exhibit high performance compared to 3D bulk semiconductors, such as TiO2.81–83
Hybrid phosphorene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterojunctions (phosphorene/MoS2 and phosphorene/WS2) have been designed theoretically by Guo et al.84 as highly efficient heterojunction solar cells, as shown in Fig. 2. The electronic band structures of the phosphorene/MoS2 and phosphorene/WS2 heterobilayers as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively, show that both of them exhibit type II band alignment with the advantage of the separation of electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, hybrid heterojunctions consisting of a MoS2 monolayer and multilayer phosphorene (monolayer, bilayer, trilayer and quadlayer) all exhibit similar type II band alignments, as shown in Fig. 2(d). In particular, the maximum energy conversion efficiency of heterojunction solar cells increases from 11.5% to 17.5% as the number layer of phosphorene increases.

However, conventional 2D van del Waals heterojunctions still require at least two different types of such desirable donor and acceptor 2D semiconductor, which limits their potential applications in heterojunction solar cells. Recently, Hu et al.85 have proposed a new way to construct heterojunction solar cells from a single type of material derived from phosphorene only. Such heterojunction solar cells consisting of edge-modified phosphorene nanoflakes (PNFs) can directly separate the electron and hole by introducing different types of atoms to passivate the PNFs, as shown in Fig. 3. The DFT calculations show that the electronic structures of PNFs strongly depend on the type of edge passivation atoms. For example, hydrogenated and fluorinated PNFs (HPNFs and FPNFs) can be used as donor and acceptor semiconductors for constructing heterojunction solar cells. Such proposed 2D van der Waals heterojunctions consisting of edge-modified PNFs can be easily fabricated and show ideal band gaps,86 high carrier mobility and strong visible light absorption for photovoltaic solar cells.87 Furthermore, the estimated maximum power conversion efficiency of such heterojunction solar cells can be as high as 20%, making them extremely competitive with existing heterojunction solar cells theoretically and experimentally.

The physical mechanism of such proposed 2D van der Waals heterojunctions consisting of edge-modified PNFs at the nanoscale can be understood as follows. When hydrogen and fluorine atoms are used to passivate the edges of PNFs, polar covalent bonds of the forms P−–H+ and P+–F− are formed around the edges of the PNFs. Interestingly, P−–H+ and P+–F− bonds introduce edge dipole layers, resulting in electric potential jumps ϕ() in the form of  inside the PNFs as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), where  represents the distance close to the edges and p represents the electric dipole moment at the armchair and zigzag edges of the PNFs. Such a jump in the potential shifts the HOMO and LUMO energy positions. Notice that the HOMO and LUMO energy positions of the HPNFs are shifted upwards upon edge passivation, whereas that of the FPNFs are shifted downwards. This strong effect of edge dipole layers on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PNFs makes it possible to design tunable and effective heterojunction solar cells. 2D van der Waals heterojunctions consisting of HPNFs and FPNFs exhibit similar type II band alignment as illustrated in Fig. 3(d). Therefore, such 2D van der Waals heterojunctions would promote electron and hole carrier transfer and separation at the HPNF/FPNF interface due to the built-in potential induced by the edge dipole layers inside the monolayers. Such an induced potential is likely to localize the HOMO and LUMO states within distinctive donor and acceptor monolayers, which can effectively separate electrons and holes at the interface.
For large-scale PNFs, the difference in HPNFs and FPNFs shows similar HOMO/LUMO gaps of PNFs, which are close to that (0.96 eV) of a phosphorene as shown in Fig. 4(a), that is because there is no edge state in edge-modified PNFs.88 However, they show different HOMO and LUMO energy positions as plotted in Fig. 4(b). Therefore, edge decoration has a strong effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy positions of PNFs, which is consistent with the heterojunction model based on the edge dipole layers. Notice that different types of passivated edges in PNFs can shift the orbital energy in different ways. Hydrogen edge passivation shifts the HOMO and LUMO energies up respectively by 0.04 and 0.05 eV from those of a phosphorene, whereas fluorine edge passivation shifts the HOMO and LUMO energies down respectively by 0.08 and 0.16 eV from those of a phosphorene. The difference in the amount of energy shift is due to the fact that the polar covalent bond P+–F− in FPNFs has a stronger dipole moment than that of P−–H+ in HPNFs. Hence, the HOMO and LUMO energy shifts (−0.08/−0.10 eV) of FPNFs are larger than those (0.04/0.05 eV) of HPNFs.

The energy gap and HOMO and LUMO energies of 2D phosphorene are marked by green dotted lines. (c) Geometric structures (top and side views), (d) energy levels and TDOS, and (e) absorption coefficients of PNF monolayers and heterobilayers of P580H68, P580F68 and P1160H68F68 (P580H68/P580F68). The violet, white, and blue balls denote phosphorus, hydrogen, and fluorine atoms, respectively. The LDOS of the HOMO and LUMO of the PNF heterobilayers is shown in the figure. All the energy levels are referenced to the vacuum level, which is set to zero. The wider absorption range and stronger optical absorption of PNF heterobilayers are marked by pink arrows.

For hybrid HPNF/FPNF heterobilayers, taking the large scale P580H68/P580F68 as an example, as shown in Fig. 4(c), the band edge positions of the VBM and CBM in P580H68 and P580F68 are now located inside the intrinsic energy gap of phosphorene (Fig. 4(d)). The reduced bandgap in such heterobilayers of edge-modified PNFs increases the absorption energy range and makes it easier for them to absorb visible light. Furthermore, interlayer interactions34 and charge transfer33 in 2D van der Waals heterojunctions can induce new optical transitions that result from the overlap of electronic states and enhance the absorption efficiency for hybrid HPNF and FPNF heterobilayers. These enhancements can be measured by examining the optical absorption coefficients of PNF heterobilayers. Fig. 4(e) shows that PNF heterobilayers exhibit a wider absorption range and stronger optical absorption compared to FPNF and HPNF monolayers.
4.2 Schottky and Ohmic contacts
Schottky and Ohmic contacts can be formed between metallic graphene and its semiconducting substrates. Based on the Schottky–Mott model89 at the metal/semiconductor interface, an n-type Schottky barrier ΦBn is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level EF and the conduction band minimum CBM Ec (ΦBn = Ec − EF). Similarly, a p-type Schottky barrier ΦBp is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level EF and valence band maximum VBM Ev (ΦBp = EF − Ev). Notice that the sum of the two types of Schottky barriers (n-type and p-type) should be approximately equal to the band gap value Eg of the semiconductor (ΦBn + ΦBp ≈ Eg). Understanding the manner of the contacts (Schottky and Ohmic contacts) between graphene and its semiconducting substrates is important for graphene-based nanoelectronic devices.
The MoS2 monolayer has an appropriate direct band gap (about 2 eV)23 to achieve a high current on/off ratio of 104 in graphene/MoS2 based field effect transistors. Fig. 5 shows the effects of interlayer coupling and an electric field on electronic structures of a graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer. An n-type Schottky contact is formed at the graphene/MoS2 interface with a small Schottky barrier of 0.23 eV, because the work function of graphene is close to the electron affinity of the MoS2 monolayer.
 Fig. 5  (a) Geometric structures and (b) differential charge density of a graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer. The gray, yellow and blue balls denote carbon, sulfur and molybdenum atoms, respectively. The red and blue regions indicate an electron increase and decrease, respectively. (c) Electronic band structures (black and colored lines respectively for the PBE and HSE06 functionals) of graphene, MoS2 and graphene/MoS2 heterobilayers. The Fermi level is set to zero and marked by green dotted lines. (d) Schottky barriers ΦBn, ΦBp and ΦBn + ΦBp in the graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer as a function of interfacial distance, and (e) corresponding electronic band structures (GGA-PBE) of the graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer at different interfacial distances of D = 2.7, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 Å. (f) Schottky barriers ΦBn, ΦBp and ΦBn + ΦBp in the graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer as a function of electric field, and (g) corresponding electronic band structures (GGA-PBE) of the graphene/MoS2 heterobilayer under different electric fields of E = −1.0, −0.5, 0.5 and 1.0 V Å−1. Reproduced with permission from ref. 60. Copyright 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Furthermore, increasing the interfacial distances between graphene and MoS2 can efficiently reduce the n-type Schottky barriers at the graphene/MoS2 interface. In detail, as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (e), the n-type Schottky barriers at the graphene/MoS2 interface are ΦBn = 0.49, 0.25, 0.06 and 0.04 eV, respectively, for the interfacial distances D = 2.7, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 Å. That is because when the interfacial distance increases, the interactions at the graphene/MoS2 interface are weakened, resulting in fewer electrons transferring from MoS2 to graphene.
The electric field, however, can be used to control the Schottky barriers as well as the Schottky contacts (n-type and p-type) and Ohmic contacts (n-type) at the graphene/MoS2 interface. In detail, as shown in Fig. 5(f) and (g), positive electric fields more than 0.6 V Å−1 can induce a transition from the n-type to p-type Schottky contacts at the graphene/MoS2 interface. But, under negative electric fields less than −0.6 V Å−1, the graphene/MoS2 interface retains an n-type Schottky contact with negligible Schottky barriers (less than 0.1 eV). When negative electric fields increase more than −0.6 V Å−1, conversion from the n-type Schottky contact to the Ohmic contact occurs at the graphene/MoS2 interface.
4.3 PN junctions
Graphene PN junctions have been realized in experiments as electron transports and devices using charge doping,90 impurity doping,91 gate voltage92 and magnetic field.93 But such experimental techniques can easily alter the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene, such as destroying its Dirac point and lowering its carrier mobility. Hu et al.31 have proposed a new way for doping graphene by interfacing with an ideal 2D semiconducting substrate (g-ZnO) doped with different impurities (Al and Li) as shown in Fig. 6, but with the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene preserved in 2D van del Waals heterojunctions. Such proposed p-type or n-type doping of graphene on doped substrates can be used to design a new type of graphene PN junction without altering the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene. Notice that the electronic and optical properties of the graphene PN junctions are different from traditional semiconductor PN junctions, which are formed at the lateral interface between the n-doped and p-doped semiconductors.

(b) Electronic band structures of hybrid graphene/g-ZnO, graphene/Al doped g-ZnO, and graphene/Li doped g-ZnO heterobilayers. The Fermi level is set to zero and marked by red dotted lines.

Fig. 6 shows the structural, electronic and optical properties of graphene/undoped g-ZnO, graphene/Al doped g-ZnO, and graphene/Li doped g-ZnO heterobilayers. The monolayer g-ZnO is a wide-gap semiconductor but graphene is metallic. When graphene interfaces with the undoped g-ZnO monolayer, its Fermi level remains in the band gap of g-ZnO and there is no charge transfer between graphene and the undoped g-ZnO monolayer. However, an inhomogeneous g-ZnO substrate induces charge redistribution in graphene, forming intralayer electron–hole puddles, with potential photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.
Interestingly, due to different work functions of Al (3.1 eV) and Li (5.5 eV) doped g-ZnO monolayers compared to that of graphene (4.3 eV), different charge transfer phenomena occur when Al and Li doped g-ZnO monolayers interface with graphene, which makes the Dirac point of graphene in graphene/Al doped g-ZnO and graphene/Li doped g-ZnO heterobilayers be moved below and above the Fermi level, forming electron and hole doping in graphene, respectively. The electron–hole pairs are well separated at the interface of the graphene/doped g-ZnO heterobilayers. The charge carrier density is estimated to be Ne(graphene/n-type g-ZnO) = 3.5 × 1013 cm−2 and Nh(graphene/p-type g-ZnO) = 1.1 × 1013 cm−2 in graphene/Al doped g-ZnO, and graphene/Li doped g-ZnO heterobilayers, respectively. Notice that such values of charge carrier density are remarkably high and more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic charge carrier density of graphene at room temperature (n = πkB2T2/6ħνF2 = 6 × 1010 cm−2).70 Therefore, the charge transfer at graphene/doped g-ZnO interfaces can induce effective electron and hole doping in graphene for graphene based Schottky diodes94,95 and PN junctions.96,97
4.4 Supercapacitors
Graphene based supercapacitors have been fabricated in experiment98–100 with high capacitance per unit area values of 394 μF cm−2 due to a high carrier mobility of graphene. By using first-principles DFT calculations, Özçelik et al.101 have proposed a new type of nanoscale dielectric capacitor consisting of graphene and h-BN van der Waals heterojunctions. Notice that there is a small lattice mismatch (1.8%) between graphene and h-BN, and they can grow easily on each other. Therefore, such proposed models can be easily fabricated in experiments as supercapacitors.

Fig. 7(a) shows the theoretical model of supercapacitors with bilayer h-BN serving as dielectrics and two parallel graphene layers serving as metallic plates. A uniform electric field is applied along the z-axis and then two graphene layers are charged by surface charge densities of −σ and +σ, respectively. Fig. 7(b) shows the schematic description of the calculated (x,y)-plane averaged electronic potential (z). The difference in the potential energy between graphene layers A and B is ez. Corresponding difference charge densities of the negatively charged ΔρA and positively charged ΔρB graphene layers are plotted in Fig. 7(c). Fig. 7(d) shows electronic band structures calculated for the (2 × 2) supercell, including isolated, single-layer graphene, which is negatively charged by Q = −0.06 e per primitive unit cell, positively charged single-layer graphene with Q = +0.06 e per primitive unit cell and the capacitor consisting of two h-BN layers capped by single-layer graphene, which is subjected to an electric field of  = 1.0 V Å−1. The Dirac point D− dips below the Fermi level when the graphene layer is negatively charged by σ = −0.18 C m−2. In contrast, the Dirac point D+ is elevated above the Fermi level when the isolated graphene layer is positively charged or hole doped by σ = +0.18 C m−2. The upward and downward energy shifts are equal and ED− = ED+ = 0.9 eV. Owing to the weak coupling between graphene layers and BN layers, the band structure of the capacitor is practically the combination of two graphene layers and that of an h-BN bilayer, except that the insulating bands of each h-BN layer shift relative to each other. Fig. 7(e) compares capacitance values calculated for supercapacitors under  = 1.0 V Å−1 using the DFT calculations and the classical Helmholtz model.102 The DFT computational results are small for a single h-BN layer, but the results show that the energy passes through a maximum and then decreases with increasing numbers of h-BN layers. This behavior for a large number of h-BN layers is similar to that of classical capacitance, namely C ∝ 1/d, because the distance d between two charged capacitor plates also increases as n increases.

5 Conclusion and outlook
In summary, we have reviewed recent theoretical studies on 2D van der Waals heterojunctions for functional materials and devices using first-principles density functional theory calculations. 2D van der Waals heterojunctions show more new properties far beyond their single components, which can be used to design potential applications of photovoltaic solar cells, Schottky and Ohmic contacts, PN junctions and supercapacitors for high-performance optoelectronic devices in experiments. Furthermore, we discuss structural models for constructing the atomic structures of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions and computational methods for computing the electronic structures of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions to help study and deign more new types of 2D van der Waals heterojunction in theory and experiment in the future.
Although great theoretical efforts have been devoted to this emerging field of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions over the past several years, there are still several significant issues that are required to be addressed and explored for functional materials and devices using theoretical simulations and designs. The first challenge is that theoretically proposed 2D van der Waals heterojunctions always consist of ideal 2D materials, which are difficult to be fabricated in experiments. This is because there are grain boundaries, dislocations and folds in 2D materials synthesized in experiments, resulting in new properties but complex structural properties, which are difficult to be studied using theoretical simulation. More experimental characterization and theoretical simulation on accurate structural properties of 2D van der Waals heterojunctions are expected in future research. Another issue is that multilayer heterostructures consist of multilayer 2D materials or more types of 2D material. Multilayer heterostructures have more complex properties and structures compared to heterobilayers and heterotrilayers, which are difficult to be simulated in theory as well. Further methods and tools should be developed to study such multilayer heterostructures.
