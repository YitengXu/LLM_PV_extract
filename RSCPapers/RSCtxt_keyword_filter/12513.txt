    AbstractRedox couples based on cobalt complexes were found to be effective in regenerating both inorganic CdSe quantum dot- and organic dye-sensitizers. The hybrid sensitizer composed of CdSe QD and ruthenium sensitizer (Z907Na) dye showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.76% on using cobalt(o-phen)32+/3+ as a common redox mediator.
Over the last few years, there have been notable advances in overall power conversion efficiency of nanoscale semiconductors (also called quantum dot, QD)-sensitized solar cells.1–3 This progress is mainly attributed to three features of QDs: (1) tunable light absorption properties; (2) various available synthetic protocols; and (3) versatile and effective incorporation of QDs into various types of solar cells such as dye-sensitized (DSSCs), bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer, and thin film solar cells. Along with recent astonishing achievements in DSSCs,4 QD-sensitized solar cells based on metal oxide mesoporous films have attracted much attention with a high expectation of combining the merits of both the QD and the DSSC system. However, it has been very difficult for a long time to find an appropriate (both efficient and non-corrosive) hole carrier for QD sensitizers.5 Only very recently, two redox couples (cobalt complex-based ones1b,6 and polysulfide electrolytes1a,7) were found to be suitable for testing QD-sensitized photoanodes in a regenerative liquid-type cell, but many parameters still need to be improved further.
It looks attractive to evaluate a possibility of assembling hybrid sensitizers made of inorganic QDs and organic chromophores in one cell and test their performances. Although this type of hybrid sensitizer appears promising in enhancing the incident light-absorbing power by the two sensitizers assembled in a parallel or serial way, only few examples have thus far been reported showing clear synergistic effects in a regenerative-type solar cell.8 The first obstacle encountered in realizing an efficient hybrid-sensitizer working in a regenerative mode was the lack of an appropriate redox couple for both sensitizers. When we examined four different redox couples (see detailed compositions in ESI), which had been known to be effective for each QD or dye, only cobalt complex-based couples showed a capability of regenerating oxidized forms of both QDs and dyes while others worked well only for one sensitizer, not for the other: (1) the most typical I−/I3−-based electrolyte was very efficient only for dyes but corrosive to QDs as reported;4,5,9 (2) the polysulfide electrolyte (S2−, Sx2−) was very effective for CdS and/or CdSe QDs1a,7 but did not work at all with dyes. The most typical dye, (Bu4N)2[Ru(Hdcbpy)2(NCS)2] (dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate, Bu4N = tetrabutylammonium) N719, was detached immediately from the TiO2 surface upon immersing the electrode in the polysulfide electrolyte due to its high pH value (>10) while the Z907 dye was neither detached nor in an intimate contact with the aqueous-based electrolyte due to its hydrophobicity, thus yielding an extremely low efficiency of less than 0.02%; (3) the recently reported new redox couple, which is composed of disulfide/thiolate (T2/T− where T− represents the 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole ion and T2 stands for its dimer), showed a promising overall efficiency (6.4%) under full sunlight for iodide-free DSSCs with a lower light absorption in the range of 400–450 nm in contrast to I−/I3−.10 However, the T2/T− redox couple was unexpectedly found to be corrosive to QDs although it has a chemical composition similar to the polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolyte toward a redox reaction. Therefore, the T2/T− was suitable only for dyes; and (4) cobalt(III/II) complex-based electrolytes were unique in regenerating both QD and dye efficiently and transporting holes without any corrosion problems, but with a diffusion problem when needed to carry a large flux of charges.1b,6,11
While it is still not easy to find another redox couple appropriate for both QDs and dyes, here we evaluate the cobalt complex-based electrolyte as the first successful model hole-carrier for promising hybrid sensitizers composed of QDs and molecular dyes shown in Table 1. Thus, in this study, we report efficient hybrid sensitizing systems obtained by combining CdSe QDs with a molecular dye on the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 film, in which the two sensitizers work together with one common hole carrier. In a typical procedure, CdSe QD was first deposited onto the TiO2 surface employing the typical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process recently introduced by our laboratory1b (see the details in ESI). The CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode thus prepared was then immersed in a dye solution for 4 h for its adsorption onto the QD-modified TiO2 electrode. The resulting electrode became darker after the dye attachment, which was then used to assemble a photoelectrochemical cell along with a platinized counter electrode as in a typical DSSC. Finally, the cobalt(o-phen)32+/3+-based electrolyte was injected into the space between two electrodes through a predrilled hole onto the counter electrode to make a regenerative circuit complete.

When considering the arrangement of the two sensitizers on the TiO2 surface, a few nanometre-sized CdSe QDs were deposited firstly onto the TiO2 surface by repeated SILAR cycles (see TEM images in ESI) with some bare TiO2 surfaces left over for dye adsorption as shown in Fig. 1. Then, dye molecules were anchored directly onto either the bare TiO2 surfaces not occupied by QDs or the CdSe QDs pre-deposited. In terms of energy levels for charge transfers, CdSe QD and dyes are taking a favorable alignment by making a type-II (cascade) structure12 relative to those of electron (TiO2) and hole (cobalt redox couple) acceptors (see the middle in Fig. 1), which could allow an efficient charge-flow when the two sensitizers are assembled in a parallel or serial fashion at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Two different types (visible- and near IR-absorbing) of dyes were chosen to demonstrate the generality in making up QD/dye hybrid sensitizing systems: (1) a typical ruthenium dye, Z907Na (cis-[NaRuII(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine)](NCS)2) and (2) a near-IR absorbing organic dye, SQ1 (5-carboxy-2-[[3-[(1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-ethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)methyl]-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-2-cyclobuten-1-ylidene]methyl]-3,3-trimethyl-1-octyl-3H-indolium).13 The photovoltaic performances of these TiO2 photoanodes obtained with a redox mediator, cobalt(o-phen)32+/3+, are summarized in Table 1. All the cells with the hybrid-sensitizer showed a significant improvement in overall efficiencies compared to the single QD-sensitized one.

After the dye attachment as a second sensitizer, the short-circuit current was boosted significantly by 29–76% with a slight increase in the open-circuit voltage but with a decrease in the fill factor. The best improvement was obtained with the Z907Na dye due to the good compatibility of Ru-based dyes with cobalt-complex redox couples as previously reported.11 As can be seen in the J–V and IPCE curves presented in Fig. 2 and 3, addition of the Z907Na dye to the CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode was truly beneficial in enhancing photocurrents, improving the conversion efficiency from 2.72 to 4.76% (+75%) under about 0.1 sun conditions where no serious diffusion-limited distortion was observed in photocurrents by cobalt complex-based electrolytes, therefore close to a true value which we can expect from the photoanode used here.1b,11 From these observations, we conclude that both sensitizers, CdSe QD and molecular dyes, contribute together in generating photocurrents with a common hole-carrier, cobalt(o-phen)32+/3+. In particular, the near IR-absorbing dye (SQ1) proves its role as a second sensitizer by showing a clear shoulder centered at 665 nm, where SQ1 converts light to current effectively, in the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 3b). Although many parameters between QDs and dyes were not optimized and rather thin TiO2 films (2.1 + 6.2 μm) were used in this study, the results obtained (Table 1) are unprecedentedly high in overall performance of QD/dye hybrid sensitizing systems working with a regenerative redox couple. It should also be noted that this successful demonstration was only possible by virtue of the unique characteristics of the cobalt complex-based redox couple, which functions well with both QD and dye chromophores. Therefore, it is very timely and essential to pay more attention to developing new and better-performing redox couples for the dye- and QD-sensitized or their hybrid cells. In addition to their high efficiencies, hybrid sensitizers made of inorganic and organic light-harvesters can also serve as an instructive platform for understanding and investigating many fundamental aspects in the charge transfer between them as well as to electron or hole acceptors.8b,c,14

In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated that inorganic/organic-hybrid sensitizers, prepared by combining SILAR-processed CdSe QDs and self-assembled molecular dyes (Z907Na or SQ1), do indeed generate photocurrents together in a regenerative mode on using a redox mediator of cobalt(o-phen)32+/3+. As a result, the best hybrid sensitizer from CdSe QD and Z907Na exhibited an overall efficiency of as high as 4.76% with over 50% IPCE at its maximum. Our study reports the first few examples of the synergistic effects of QD/dye hybrid sensitizers for regenerative photoelectrochemical cells, in which cobalt complex-based electrolytes are used.
