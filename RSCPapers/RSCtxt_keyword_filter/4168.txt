    , Accepted 27th June 2016First published on 28th June 2016AbstractWe developed a unique nano- and microwire hybrid structure by selectively modifying only the tops of microwires using metal-assisted chemical etching. The proposed nano/micro hybrid structure not only minimizes surface recombination but also absorbs 97% of incident light under AM 1.5G illumination, demonstrating outstanding light absorption compared to that of planar (59%) and microwire arrays (85%). The proposed hybrid solar cells with an area of 1 cm2 exhibit power conversion efficiencies (Eff) of up to 17.6% under AM 1.5G illumination. In particular, the solar cells show a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.5 mA cm−2 because of the high light-absorbing characteristics of the nanostructures. This corresponds to an approximately 61.5% and 16.5% increase in efficiency compared to that of a planar silicon solar cell (Eff = 10.9%) and a microwire solar cell (Eff = 15.1%), respectively. Therefore, we expect the proposed hybrid structure to become a foundational technology for the development of highly efficient radial junction solar cells.
Introduction
Surface texturing of crystalline silicon using vertical nano- and microwire arrays has been extensively investigated because it enables design of radial junction solar and photoelectrochemical cells.1–6 Radial p–n junctions formed by core–shell structures exhibit efficient charge collection because minority carriers can be collected along the relatively short radial direction that is orthogonal to the long light absorption direction along the wire axis. This indicates that highly efficient devices can be developed from more economical, lower-purity silicon compared to the silicon used in the manufacture of commercial solar cells.7,8 In addition, nano- and microwire arrays are expected to result in improved short-circuit current densities (Jsc) owing to the increased light absorption from the efficient light trapping effect caused by multiple scattering.9–11 However, further research is required to realize highly efficient solar cells based on radial junctions because of certain limitations of each structure.
Nanowire arrays exhibit outstanding light absorption performance, but are limited by severe surface recombination and difficulties in producing the top electrodes. These arrays have a high aspect ratio, indicating a very high surface-to-volume ratio that increases the probability of surface recombination.12–14 Therefore, the Jsc and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device decrease owing to the occurrence of recombination before minority carriers are collected; thus, the fabrication of highly efficient solar cells is difficult. Furthermore, the emitter layer in a radial p–n junction has a junction depth of many tens of nanometers, and its sheet resistance is hundreds of ohms per square, which is much higher than that of a conventional Si solar cell emitter (<100 Ω sq−1), inhibiting effective carrier collection with metal electrodes. Therefore, without additional transparent conducting electrodes like indium tin oxide (ITO) in the emitter layer, the device size is limited.15,16
In contrast, microwire arrays permit the formation of a stable emitter, enabling effective carrier collection using general grid-type metal electrodes without transparent conducting electrodes.17–19 However, the light absorption of microwire arrays is poor compared to that of nanowire arrays because of their higher surface reflection. Several studies were conducted to address this problem. One representative study reported application of a few μm-long nanowires between microwire arrays for an outstanding light-trapping capability through the nanowire.20 However, it is difficult to make highly efficient devices using nanowire arrays because they exhibit a low Voc and fill factor (FF) because of the previously mentioned increase in surface recombination. Therefore, a new structure type is necessary to develop highly efficient radial junction solar cells.
In this study, we investigated the reasons that limit the absorption of light in microwire arrays and developed a nano/micro hybrid structure by selectively applying nanostructures to the top areas of microwires, corresponding to 25% of the total area. The nanostructures with outstanding optical properties were fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE). The proposed hybrid structure combines the advantages of microwires and nanostructures. Using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer, we confirmed that the existing microwire reflectance of more than 15% dropped to an average of less than 2% in the 400 to 900 nm range. The efficiency (Eff) of the proposed solar cell with an area of 1 cm2 was 17.6%, with a maximum Jsc of 39.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 584 mV, and a FF of 76.1%. This efficiency was an approximately 16.5% improvement compared to the solar cells fabricated with general microwire arrays (Jsc = 34.1 mA cm−2; Voc = 578 mV; FF = 76.8%; Eff = 15.1%). Therefore, this study has proven that highly efficient radial junction solar cells are possible because the Jsc of the proposed nano/micro hybrid structure approaches 40 mA cm−2.
Results and discussion
We fabricated high aspect ratio Si microwire arrays with a hexagonal arrangement using a photolithography process and deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE). The diameter of each microwire was 2 μm, and the center-to-center distance between the microwires was 4 μm. The DRIE conditions were set to a uniform etching rate of approximately 1.5 μm min−1. Microwires of 10 to 30 μm in length were fabricated by adjusting the process time, as shown in Fig. 1a–c. The reflectance and absorption of the microwires were measured by using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer to analyze the light absorption characteristics of the various microwires. We measured the total reflection, including the specular and diffuse reflections occurring at the microwire arrays, within a wavelength range of 400 to 1100 nm. We ensured that no light was transmitted through the sample by depositing a 200 nm-thick layer of aluminum on the rear surface of the Si wafer, which functioned as a rear reflector. The absorption A(λ) of the sample was measured using the equation A(λ) = 1 − R(λ), where R(λ) is the reflectance. As can be seen in Fig. 1d, absorption was enhanced with increased lengths of the microwire. This is because the amount of incident light entering the Si wafer increases with the increasing length of the microwire, enabling the Si to absorb more light.21 However, absorption became saturated and did not increase for microwire lengths greater than 20 μm.

(d) Total absorption spectra of planar Si (black solid line) and microwire arrays of different lengths: 10 μm (blue solid line), 20 μm (red solid line), and 30 μm (green solid line). (e) Bird's-eye view SEM image of microwire arrays. The inset shows the top-view SEM image of microwire arrays. (f) Total reflectance spectra of planar Si (red solid line) and microwire arrays of a length of 20 μm (blue solid line). The red dashed line indicates the reflectance spectra equivalent to 25% of the reflectance for planar Si. 
The reason for this limitation in light absorption is suspected to be the reflection of light at the flat surface of the top of the microwire, which is not affected by the length of the microwire, as shown in Fig. 1e. The area of the top flat surface of the microwire array used in this study was 0.247 cm2, approximately 25% of the total area (1 cm2). Based on this, comparing the reflectance of the microwire arrays of 20 μm length with that of the planar Si of 25%, the reflectance almost coincides at wavelengths ranging between 500 nm and 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 1f. However, the reflection at long wavelengths greater than 800 nm did not coincide, and this is because of the low light absorption of c-Si that has an indirect band gap characteristic. The absorption depth of c-Si for wavelengths that range from 800 to 1100 nm is 10 to 2000 μm.22 In this wavelength range, there is a high possibility of light being transmitted through the sample instead of being absorbed and reflected from the rear reflector.23,24 Therefore, as can be seen in Fig. 1f, the difference between the calculated reflectance and the actual reflectance increases at long wavelengths greater than 800 nm. However, because the planar reflectance of 25% and that of the 20 μm microwire arrays at wavelengths less than 800 nm almost coincide, we can see that the main reason for the microwire arrays’ limited light absorption is the surface reflection from the top of the microwire.
To reduce the reflection of the microwire arrays with limited light absorption, we selectively fabricated nanostructures that demonstrate outstanding light absorption only on the flat surface area on the top of the microwire. To selectively form nanostructures on the top of microwires, we employed the modified Bosch process and MACE, a wet etching method, as shown in the schematic in Fig. 2a. The Bosch process is commonly used for etching silicon, and microwires with a length of 20 μm were produced through repeated cycles of etching gas (SF6) and passivation gas (C4F8) flows. After fabricating the microwires, an additional C4F8 gas flow formed a non-conductive fluorocarbon polymer film as a passivation layer over the entire surface of the microwire arrays.25,26 Next, photoresist masks on top of the microwires that are used in the etching process were lifted off to expose Si on the top of the microwires. The Ag film was deposited by thermal evaporation to act as a catalyst during the MACE reaction. As can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the Ag film (20 nm) used in this study has a porous structure. Because of the surface morphology of the Ag film, nanowires were formed after selective etching. The mechanism of the MACE reaction is as follows:27–29 H2O2 + 2H+ → 2H2O + 2H+(1) Si + 2H2O → SiO2 + 4H+ + 4e−(2) SiO2 + 6HF → H2SiF6 + 2H2O(3)

(c) Low-magnification SEM image of the nano/micro hybrid structure. The high-magnification SEM images of (d) the bottom region and (e) the top region of the nano/micro hybrid structure. 
As can be seen from the above equations, a MACE reaction occurs because of a redox reaction. However, because the Si surface is passivated by coating with a non-conductive fluorocarbon polymer layer (except on the top part of the microwire), electron movement is prevented, preventing any redox reaction that would etch the Si (Fig. 2b). The fabricated nano/micro hybrid structure was examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2c–e). As shown in Fig. 2c, nanostructures were evenly formed on the top of the microwire of high aspect ratio. In addition, the high-resolution SEM images shown in Fig. 2d and e confirm that nanostructures were formed only at the top and not at the bottom of the microwire arrays. Thus, because the nanostructures were selectively formed at the top of the microwire, only 25% of the entire area is covered with nanostructures, thereby minimizing the impact of surface recombination occurring in the nanostructures and maximizing light absorption.
The nano/micro hybrid structure realized in this study exhibited outstanding optical properties. Fig. 3a shows the optical images of planar, microwire, and nano/micro hybrid array structures. As can be seen by the diffracted colors in the image of the microwire arrays, a considerable amount of light is reflected. In contrast, the nano/micro hybrid structure is almost black because of strong broad band optical absorption.9 This can be confirmed by the reflectance, shown in Fig. 3b. The planar structure showed a high reflection of 40%, whereas the microwire arrays (20 μm) demonstrated a low reflection of 10–20%, and that of the nano/micro hybrid structure was less than 2%. This significant reduction in the surface reflection is due to the outstanding light trapping effect of the nanostructures fabricated on the tops of the microwires.30,31 The reduction in the reflection can also be explained by the mitigation of the refractive index mismatch. The nanostructures are homogeneous mixtures of Si and air; they act much like an anti-reflection coating (ARC), effectively reducing the mismatch of the refractive index of a Si substrate (refractive index = 3.5–5) and air (refractive index = 1).32–34 Therefore, the reflection effectively decreases because of the nanostructures on the top of the microwires in the proposed structure. Fig. 3c shows the integrated absorption of each structure under AM 1.5G illumination. In the case of planar Si, only 59% of light was absorbed, whereas in the case of microwire arrays, 85% of incident light was absorbed. This improvement in light absorption results from the light trapping caused by multiple scattering. Moreover, the nano/micro hybrid structure absorbed 97%, confirming that this structure absorbs the highest amount of incident light.

We fabricated solar cell devices as shown in Fig. 4a to investigate the enhanced photovoltaic characteristics of the nano/micro hybrid structure. To form a radial p–n junction, a p-type emitter layer with a junction depth of 220 nm was formed using spin-on-doping, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). To minimize recombination on the rear side, an n-type back surface field (BSF) layer with a junction depth of 600 nm was formed. The micro-grid electrode reported in a previous study was applied to the top electrode.35 Because the micro-grid top electrode covers only 1% of the entire area, it can reduce optical loss, and a high FF can be expected because the short carrier collection distance enables effective charge collection. In addition, a thin Al2O3 film (10 nm) was deposited using atomic layer deposition to minimize the surface recombination due to the large surface area. The Al2O3 film has been reported as an outstanding passivation layer that increases the lifetime of minority carriers by effectively blocking them from approaching interfacial defects with a negative fixed charge.36,37

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the fabricated microwire arrays and nano/microwire hybrid solar cells were measured under AM 1.5G illumination to investigate the photovoltaic characteristics of the cells (Fig. 4b). As shown in Table 1, microwire arrays (Jsc = 33.8 mA cm−2) demonstrated an average efficiency of 14.7% due to an improvement of 9.4 mA cm−2 in Jsc compared to the planar structure (Jsc = 24.4 mA cm−2). The solar cell fabricated with the nano/micro hybrid structure demonstrated an average Jsc of 39.1 mA cm−2 due to the effect of the nanostructures on the top of the microwires, corresponding to an increase of 15.7% compared to the Jsc of the solar cell fabricated with the microwire arrays. As shown in Fig. 4c, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the nano/micro hybrid solar cell in the short wavelength range (400 nm) increased to more than 95% because of the increased absorption resulting from the nanostructures. Compared to a microwire solar cell, the hybrid cell's EQE value increased by approximately 12% at wavelengths between 400 nm and 900 nm. Furthermore, the hybrid cell's EQE was higher than nanowire solar cells over the full wavelength range (Fig. S3, ESI†). In particular, as verified in Fig. S3c (ESI†), the generated Jsc of the hybrid solar cell (14.3 mA cm−2) was 17.7% higher than that of the nanowire solar cell (12.2 mA cm−2) in the wavelength range of 400 to 600 nm. This is because, although the nanowire solar cell has excellent light absorption characteristics, it is difficult for the generated charges to be collected owing to severe surface recombination. In contrast, in the nano/micro hybrid solar cell, generated charges can be effectively collected before recombination because of the effect of the radial junction at the microwire area. In addition, the hybrid cell's EQE was higher than that of the nanowire solar cell at wavelengths over 600 nm. The reflectance of 400 nm-long Si nanowire arrays was higher than that of the nano/micro hybrid structure at wavelengths over 600 nm because of the small extinction coefficient of c-Si. For this reason, the hybrid cell's EQE was 6% higher than that of the nanowire solar cell at wavelengths over 600 nm.

In the case of the nanowire solar cell, Voc was 561 mV, 17 mV less than the 578 mV of the planar solar cell, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). This reduced Voc is due to the severe surface recombination associated with the increased surface area of the nanowires. For the same reason, a low Voc was expected in the nano/micro hybrid solar cell; however, the average Voc was 581 mV, 3 mV higher than that of the planar solar cell. This can be understood from eqn (4), used to obtain Voc: (4)
In this equation, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, q is the electron charge, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, and J0 is the saturation current density. In our study, the Jsc of the hybrid cell increased by an average of 14.7 mA cm−2 compared to that of the planar solar cell because of the former's outstanding light absorption capability. Eqn (4) confirms that Voc has increased owing to the increase in Jsc. Furthermore, the effective minority carrier lifetime was measured using microwave photoconductive decay (μ-PCD) to determine the effect of surface recombination on the nano/micro hybrid structure (Fig. S4, ESI†). The average effective minority carrier lifetime for the planar Si wafer was 53.4 μs, and that of the nano/micro hybrid structure was 41.3 μs. This reduction of 12.1 μs is due to the increase in the surface area compared to the planar solar cell. These results confirmed that the hybrid cell's Voc increased more than that of the planar solar cell because the increase in Jsc resulting from the former's outstanding light absorption had a greater impact than the degradation in Voc due to surface recombination.
Although a BSF layer was formed on the rear side to minimize recombination, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) results shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) indicate that the IQE decreased at wavelengths greater than 900 nm. Further improvement in efficiency would be possible if we apply additional treatments to reduce recombination, such as rear surface local contacts. Finally, the solar cell with the nano/micro hybrid structure demonstrated a maximum efficiency of 17.6% with Jsc = 39.5 mA cm−2; Voc = 584 mV; and FF = 76.1% (Table 1). These results correspond to a 16.5% increase compared to the efficiency of the microwire solar cell (Jsc = 34.1 mA cm−2; Voc = 578 mV; FF = 76.8%; Eff = 15.1%). Moreover, the proposed hybrid devices exhibit an efficiency 6.6% higher than that of the devices using conventional SiNx (refractive index = 2.02) ARC on microwire arrays (Eff = 16.5%).35
Conclusions
A novel nano/micro hybrid solar cell structure was fabricated by selectively applying nanostructures on the top of existing microwire arrays. This hybrid structure showed a light absorption of 97%, significantly higher than that of planar or microwire array structures. The efficiency of this hybrid cell increased by approximately 61.5% and 16.5% compared to those of the planar Si solar cell (Eff = 10.9%) and the microwire solar cell (Eff = 15.1%), respectively. The proposed hybrid cell demonstrated a high efficiency of 17.6% with Jsc = 39.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 584 mV, and FF = 76.1%. This shows that highly efficient radial junction solar cells, which exhibit outstanding light absorption, can be fabricated without additional ARC when this nano/micro hybrid structure is used. Through μ-PCD measurements, we confirmed that the average effective minority carrier lifetime of the hybrid structure was 41.3 μs, not considerably different from that of the planar Si wafer (53.4 μs). Therefore, we expect this nano/macro hybrid structure to play a significant role in the development of highly efficient radial junction solar cells.
Experimental
Fabrication of Si microwire arrays
Silicon microwire arrays were fabricated using Czochralski (CZ) Si wafers (n-type, resistivity of 1–3 Ω cm, 200 μm-thick). Circular-shaped photoresist dot arrays (2 μm in diameter, 2 μm spacing) were periodically patterned in AZ nLOF 2035 photoresist (AZ Electronic Materials) via photolithography. The deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process (Tegal 200), including etching and passivation steps, was adopted with a 1500 W source power, 45 mTorr gas pressure, and 100 W stage power under source gases of SF6 (250 sccm) and C4F8 (150 sccm). To remove photoresist residues, the O2 plasma treatment was conducted using a plasma asher (V15-G, KAMI) at 300 W for 20 min. Subsequently, the surface damaged by the DRIE on the Si microwire sidewalls was removed using a slow Si etchant (HNO3:HF:CH3COOH = 400:1:20) for 60 s.
Fabrication of the Si nano/micro hybrid structure
To selectively form Si nanowires only on the top surfaces of the microwires, a passivation step (C4F8) was added to the DRIE process to deposit a fluorocarbon polymer coating layer on the surface of the as-fabricated Si microwires before removing the photoresist residues. Subsequently, the photoresist masks on the tops of the microwires that were used in the DRIE process were lifted off to expose Si on the tops of the microwires. By applying thermal evaporation to the structure, the 20 nm-thick Ag film, that acts as the catalyst during the metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) reaction, was deposited. The Si nanowires were selectively formed on the top surfaces of the Si microwires via MACE in a mixed solution of HF (4.8 M), and H2O2 (0.44 M) for 60 s. The residual Ag film was then removed using diluted nitric acid (at a volume ratio of HNO3:H2O = 1:1). After the DRIE and MACE processes, the organic residue and the damaged Si surface were removed using a piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 2:1), followed by slow Si etching for 60 s.
Fabrication of nano/micro hybrid structure solar cells
The emitter and back surface field (BSF) layers were formed by the spin-on-dopant (SOD) method. First, the phosphorus dopant source (P509, Filmtronics, Inc.) for the BSF layer was spin-coated on a dummy Si wafer, and then baked on a hotplate at 200 °C for 20 min. The diffusion process was conducted in a tube furnace under a mixed ambient atmosphere of O2 (125 sccm) and N2 (500 sccm) at 900 °C. To form a uniform BSF layer on the rear side of the Si substrate, we positioned the Si substrate so that it faced the phosphorus-coated dummy wafer. The phosphorus silicate glass, which remained even after the SOD diffusion, was removed by dipping in a diluted HF solution. Subsequently, the emitter layer was formed using a Boron dopant source (B155, Filmtronics, Inc.) on the front side. The boron dopant source was spin-coated on a dummy Si wafer, and then baked on a hotplate at 200 °C for 20 min. For conformal doping on the nano/micro hybrid structure, we positioned the Si structures so that they faced the boron-coated dummy wafer. The boron doping was conducted in the tube furnace under a N2 atmosphere at 850 °C. After removing the boron silicate glass and native silicon oxide, a 10 nm-thick Al2O3 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition (Lucida D100, NCD) on the emitter as a surface passivation layer. To form the front metal electrode, the Si structures were covered with a photoresist (AZ4330, AZ electronic materials) before the Al deposition. The micro-grid (a micro-scale mesh structure) was patterned using the lithography process. For the top and bottom contacts, 500 nm-thick Al films were deposited onto the top and bottom of the substrate via a thermal evaporator. Finally, the photoresist was removed by dipping in acetone solution.
Characterization of nano/micro hybrid structure solar cells
The surface morphologies of the Si structures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The dopant profiles were measured using a magnetic-sector secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS, CAMECA IMS 7f). The photovoltaic performances of the solar cells were examined using an Oriel Sol3A Class AAA solar simulator (Newport) under AM 1.5G illumination. The incident flux was confirmed using a calibrated power meter, and double-checked using a NREL-calibrated solar cell (PV Measurements, Inc.). The EQE spectra were recorded using a Xe light source and a monochromator with a wavelength range of 400–1100 nm. Optical reflection measurements were performed via a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent) equipped with a 110 mm integrating sphere to account for total light (diffuse and specular) reflected from the samples. The effective minority carrier lifetimes were analyzed by the microwave photoconductivity decay (μ-PCD) method using minority carrier lifetime measurement (Semilab, WT-2000PVN). In this measurement, the samples were illuminated by using a laser pulse (905 ± 10 nm pulsed laser operating at 200 nm cycles) and the decay of minority carriers was measured by monitoring the reflected microwave signal.
