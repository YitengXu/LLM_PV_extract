    , Accepted 7th November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractAn active absorption layer with a narrow band gap has been achieved through adjusting the halide ratio in a halide perovskite, and it had better energy alignment with the Zn2SnO4 electron transport layer. An efficiency of 19.37% can be obtained, and this has also been improved to 20.26% through the incorporation of cesium, giving a new triple cation perovskite.
Lead halide perovskites have attracted broad attention due to the development of simple thin-film deposition technology, their low cost and their outstanding photovoltaic performance.1 The wide light harvesting spectra, high absorption coefficients, low exciton binding energies, and long balanced electron–hole diffusion lengths have made this type of material a huge success for photovoltaic applications,2–4 as well as for other optoelectronic applications, such as light emitting diodes.5,6 To date, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been boosted to a new world record of 25.2%,7 up from an initial report of 3.8% in 2009.8 Indeed, great effort has been devoted in past decades to promoting the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, such as developing electron transport layers (ETLs) with different compositions and nanostructures,9–11 modifying the perovskite active layers with mixed cations and mixed halides,12–15 designing hole transport layers (HTLs) with different functional groups and molecular structures,16–18 and scrutinizing the metal electrodes.19 Among the four major overall device components, the perovskite layer is one of the most critical factors and has a determining effect on the photovoltaic performance of a PSC.
An example of an organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite material is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). It has an optical band gap of 1.59 eV,20 and this can be tuned via the incorporation of the large organic cation formamidinium (FA+), which in turn helps to improve the phase stability of FAPbI3 (with an optical band gap of 1.47 eV21,22) at room temperature.23 Successful demonstrations of FA-MA double cation perovskites include (FA0.85MA0.15)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)313 and (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3,14,24 which were prepared from mixtures of the two perovskites FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 (with an optical band gap of 2.31 eV24) at the same concentration and at volume ratios of 85 to 15 and 83 to 17, respectively. The resultant perovskites have optical band gaps of 1.55 eV13 and 1.63 eV.24 The success of these two compositions lies in the fact that no phase segregation was observed in these two compounds under constant light illumination. In other words, these two iodide–bromide alloyed perovskites exhibited robust crystal structure stability under light illumination.
In this work, we tuned the halide ratio in a halide perovskite to obtain an active (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite absorption layer with an optical band gap of 1.589 eV, which resulted in a decent increase in the PSC photocurrent. Moreover, the (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite shows better energy alignment with the electron transport material Zn2SnO4, which has a large band gap of 3.6 eV and high electron mobility (10–15 cm2 V−1 s−1).25 High efficiencies of 19.37% and 20.26% were achieved from (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 and Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 based solar cells, respectively.
The (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite was prepared using a method reported in the literature,26 and was used as the control. The (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite was prepared with MABr being replaced by MAI. In the following discussion, the (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite is referred to as FAMA-1 while the finely tuned (FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite is referred to as FAMA-2. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that FAMA-1 and the finely tuned FAMA-2 share almost the same powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. It can be seen that the intensities of the FAMA-2 diffraction peaks are stronger than those of the FAMA-1 perovskite film, indicating that the crystallinity of the perovskite layer has been enhanced after the replacement of MABr in the perovskite precursor solution with MAI. Both FAMA-1 and FAMA-2 displayed a typical tetragonal phase with a characteristic peak at 2θ = 14°, which can be indexed to the (110) facet of the photoactive black phase of the perovskite material. Similar to what has been reported in the literature, an additional peak at 2θ = 12.6° is found in our perovskites, which originates from the diffraction peak of PbI2.
Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows that FAMA-1 and the finely tuned FAMA-2 show very similar film morphologies with similar grain sizes. Fig. S2c and d (ESI†) display cross-sectional images of the complete device, where Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles are used as an electron transport layer, spiro-OMeTAD acts as a hole transport layer and metal Au acts as an electrode, with thicknesses of approximately 60, 130 and 80 nm, respectively. It is worth noting that the thickness of the FAMA-2 perovskite layer is about 670 nm, which is 90 nm thicker than the FAMA-1 perovskite film. To some extent, this is due to the faster crystallization rate of FAMA-2 in contrast to FAMA-1.

Fig. 1a shows the absorbance spectra of these two perovskites, showing that FAMA-2 film has higher absorbance at wavelengths ranging from 620 nm to 800 nm. Fig. 1b shows that the band gap of FAMA-2 is around 1.589 eV, narrower than that of FAMA-1 (1.635 eV).

The photovoltaic performances of FAMA-1 and FAMA-2 are examined in a FTO/Zn2SnO4/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au device configuration (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices, with the photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. The FAMA-2 based solar cell shows a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 24.48 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (η) of 19.37%. In contrast, the FAMA-1 based solar cell has a highest efficiency of 18.00%. The most significant increase in the FAMA-2 based solar cell performance comes from the higher Jsc value, although a small drop is observed in the Voc value. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of FAMA-2 and FAMA-1 based devices. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE data are 21.86 and 23.31 mA cm−2 for devices based on FAMA-1 and FAMA-2, respectively, which match well with the Jsc values extracted from J–V measurements. Meanwhile, Fig. 2b also shows that in the wavelength range from 600 nm to 800 nm, higher EQE values are obtained with FAMA-2, which matches well with the absorbance spectra given in Fig. 1a.

Fig. S3 (ESI†) gives the J–V characteristics of the devices incorporating FAMA-1 and FAMA-2, respectively, under both reverse and forward scan conditions. Compared with the device composed of a FAMA-1 perovskite layer, the device based on a FAMA-2 perovskite layer displayed lower hysteresis. In addition, maximum power point (MPP) tracking indicates that the stabilized efficiencies of the devices are close to the results obtained from J–V scans. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Jsc values of PSCs based on FAMA-1 and FAMA-2 perovskite layers, respectively, stabilized within seconds at approximately 22.3 and 23.3 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized PCE values of around 17.3% and 18.2%, respectively.
To systematically analyze the photovoltaic properties of the cells, a series of PSCs based on different perovskite layers has been assembled. Photovoltaic performance box charts extracted from J–V measurements of the devices are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The average Jsc value for a PSC fabricated with a FAMA-2 perovskite layer improved from 22.85 to 23.70 mA cm−2 in contrast to a cell assembled with FAMA-1 perovskite film. Meanwhile, the average FF value rises from 0.73 to 0.75. Moreover, the Voc value did not decrease obviously. Overall, the efficiency was enhanced by 7.6%, from 17.20% to 18.51%, when MABr in the perovskite precursor solution was replaced with MAI. As is well known, the quality of the adjacent layers, including the ETL, perovskite layer and HTL, decides the photovoltaic performance.27 Among these, the grain size, thickness, and crystallinity of the perovskite layer have a significant influence on the photovoltaic properties. According to the results mentioned above, we speculated that the improvement in the efficiency might be ascribed to the thicker perovskite layer in the PSC due to the changed composition of the perovskite layer.
To investigate the energy alignment properties, ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry and UV-vis spectrophotometry were used to estimate the valence band energy (Evb) and Eg values; the detailed parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The Evb values for FAMA-2 and FAMA-1 were respectively determined to be −5.24 eV and −5.75 eV against the vacuum level (Fig. S5, ESI†). The value of Eg became smaller, adjusting from 1.64 to 1.59 eV, after MABr in the perovskite precursor solution was replaced with MAI, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The valence band (Evb) value can be calculated directly through the following equation: Eg = Ecb − Evb. Therefore, the Ecb values for FAMA-2 and FAMA-1 could be estimated at −3.65 and −4.11 eV, respectively. On the basis of semiconductor theory, the driving force of electronic injection increased due to the increase in the energy difference between the Ecb values of the perovskite layer and Zn2SnO4. Compared to FAMA-1, the FAMA-2 perovskite film might be more suitable for Zn2SnO4 based PSCs due to the robust band structure alignment, as illustrated in Fig. S5d (ESI†).
To understand the carrier extraction and charge recombination processes in the perovskite active layer, the steady-state PL and TRPL data from FTO/Zn2SnO4/FAMA-1 and FTO/Zn2SnO4/FAMA-2 were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The emission peak from the PL measurements was in the UV-vis absorption region (Fig. 1), and the FAMA-2 perovskite film displayed an obviously red-shifted PL peak (773 nm) in contrast with the FAMA-1 perovskite film (752 nm); this resulted in enhanced absorption in the visible spectral range, which implied that the energy of the perovskite layer changed due to the shift in the conduction band-edge state.28,29 Also, the PL intensity was reduced on account of a quenching effect caused by efficient carrier extraction. The PL intensity of the latter is much lower than that of the former, suggesting that the electrons in the FAMA-2 perovskite layer were extracted more easily from the perovskite active layer to the ETL.

Nyquist plots from PSCs fabricated with FAMA-1 (black) and FAMA-2 (red) perovskites under (c) one sun illumination and (d) dark conditions (equivalent circuits are given in the insets). 
The TRPL spectra (Fig. 3b) were fitted an exponential time function, as per the following equation: F(t) = Aieτ/τi; i = 1, 2; where Ai is a prefactor and ti is a time constant. The average lifetime (τave) was calculated to be about 28.9 ns for the FAMA-2 perovskite and 36.9 ns for the other perovskite (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, the cell composed of FAMA-2 perovskite film has more efficient electron transportation from the perovskite layer to the Zn2SnO4 ETL due to high carrier extraction and the suppression of charge recombination.
To further explore the reactions undergone by photoexcited electrons at the interfaces, EIS was carried out under 1 sun illumination and dark conditions (−1.0 V). The semicircle in the high frequency range relates to the electron transport resistance (Ret) under 1 sun illumination. The semicircle in the low frequency region is associated with the recombination resistance (Rrec) across the ETL/perovskite interfaces under dark conditions (−1.0 V). The high frequency features are attributed to the series resistance (Rs). As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the Ret values obtained from the different perovskite layers are in the following order: FAMA-1 > FAMA-2. A smaller Ret value suggests that electron transport from the perovskite layer to the ETL occurs more quickly. Compared to the PSC composed of FAMA-1 perovskite film, a larger Rrec value is observed from the cell based on FAMA-2 perovskite film, resulting in less charge recombination and indicating that photoinduced electron–hole recombination can be suppressed effectively. For PSCs, the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) can be directly influenced by the Ret and Rrec values. Ultimately, the ηcc values of the cells have been improved after MABr in the perovskite precursor solution was replaced with MAI, bringing about a higher Jsc value.
In order to improve further the PSC efficiency, the PSC perovskite layer has been optimized via the addition of inorganic cesium to the perovskite precursor solution during the spin-coating process. As shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), a diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.6° in the XRD pattern and white grains in the SEM image can be more obviously observed; both of these factors imply that a PbI2 phase was present. According to the previous literature,14 impurities in FA-based perovskites have usually resulted in cations with a larger radius being beneficial to the formation of photoinactive wide-bandgap ‘‘yellow’’ phase polymorphs (2θ = 11.6° in the XRD pattern). It has also been confirmed that the formation of a yellow phase was suppressed efficiently and the crystallization of the active black phase was promoted after inorganic cesium was added to the perovskite precursor solution during the spin-coating process. This has also been detected in this study, as displayed in Fig. S1 and S6a (ESI†). Fig. S6c (ESI†) shows a cross-sectional image of the cell (a schematic illustration of the device is depicted in Fig. S6d, ESI†), and the thickness of the perovskite layer can be evaluated to be about 790 nm, which is much thicker than the sample without inorganic cesium.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, a PSC based on Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.89Br0.11)3 (FAMA-Cs) film exhibited a Jsc value of 25.04 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 1.03 V and a FF of 0.79. An optimum efficiency of 20.26% can be achieved, and an IPCE value of 95% can be reached. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Jsc value of the PSC based on a FAMA-Cs perovskite layer stabilized within seconds at approximately 23.8 mA cm−2, yielding a stabilized PCE of around 19.2%. The optimized device demonstrated good stability in a drying oven, retaining 85% of its initial PCE after 15 days. The humidity of this box should be less than 10%, and the temperature was about 30 °C. Furthermore, 28 devices have been fabricated and an average efficiency of 19.48% has been obtained, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), exhibiting outstanding photovoltaic performance. The FAMA-Cs perovskite layer was also suitable for Zn2SnO4-based PSCs.

In summary, a FAMA-2 perovskite layer has been synthesized for the first time and then used as an active layer in PSCs, exhibiting an efficiency of 19.37%. Such a satisfactory photovoltaic performance might be ascribed to the following details. Firstly, the FAMA-2 perovskite layer has an appropriate energy band structure, which is beneficial for effective carrier extraction from the perovskite layer; secondly, the FAMA-2 perovskite layer with a wide light absorption region could obtain high light harvesting efficiency; and thirdly, the thicker FAMA-2 perovskite layer might provide more electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, this active layer has been modified with inorganic cesium and a FAMA-Cs perovskite layer with a new phase has been formed. As a result, a cell composed of the new perovskite phase achieved a high efficiency of 20.26%. Therefore, the present work might give rise to a novel strategy for synthesizing new perovskite phases in PSCs.
