Due to their remarkable potential for low-cost solar energy conversion and optical radiation detection, organic photovoltaic (PV) devices have attracted much attention,1–6 since Tang reported a two-layer organic PV cell in 1986.1 In the formation of the PV effect, the dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free charges in organic materials is often a critical process limiting the overall efficiency of PV devices.7 It has been recognized that the most efficient exciton dissociation in organic materials occurs by charge transfer at an electron donor–acceptor (DA) interface.2,3 At such an interface, the donor layer having a low ionization potential (IP) forms a heterojunction with the acceptor layer having a relatively high electron affinity (EA). Since the exciton dissociation or the charge-transfer (CT) process at the DA interface typically occurs on a time scale, τCT, of a few hundred femtoseconds or less, and is much shorter than any other competing processes, the efficiency of energetically favorable CT process approaches ηCT
				= 100%.8,9 This exciton dissociation efficiency is far higher than that (<10%) in single-layer organic PV cells. In double-layer organic PV cells, an appropriate energy level alignment at the heterojunction is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation. CT exciton dissociation only happens on the premise that the energy of the photogenerated exciton is higher than or at least equal to the energy of the CT state.10,11 Accordingly, organic materials with a low ionization potential such as CuPc1,4,6 and m-MTDATA12,13 are usually used as the donor layer in PV devices since their strong electron donating nature is expected to lead to a highly efficient CT reaction at the DA interface. The visible light sensitive CuPc has been used as a donor layer to fabricate various PV devices with a power efficiency reaching 1% to 3.6%
				(which is the highest efficiency reported thus far for the small-molecular system PV cells).4,6 While there are various reports on visible light sensitive organic PV cells, reports on ultraviolet (UV) light sensitive PV devices are relatively few, probably because UV light only accounts for a small fraction of the terrestrial solar power compared to visible light. Nevertheless, to capture or detect UV light, it is of great interest to develop UV-sensitive organic materials especially those amorphous molecular materials instead of crystalline ones and to fabricate efficient photovoltaic devices. In this respect, our group and Shirota et al. have reported PV devices using UV-sensitive m-MTDATA and its derivatives as the donor layer.12–14
In this communication, we report the application of a novel starburst triphenylamine derivative, 4,4′,4″-tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-(9-ethylcarbazyl-3)amino)triphenylamine (PCATA), as an electron donor to fabricate efficient organic PV devices. PCATA has a low ionization potential and good sensitivity to UV light. Under illumination with 365 nm light at 1.02 mW cm−2, double-layer organic PV devices using PCATA as the electron donor layer, and tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3) or 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl)tris[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole]
				(TPBI) as the acceptor layer delivered short-circuit current densities (JSC) of 0.048 or 0.066 mA cm−2, corresponding to quantum efficiencies of 16% or 21.7% respectively. These represent the highest values ever reported for UV-sensitive organic PV cells.12,14,15
The chemical structure of PCATA is shown in Fig. 1. PCATA, a novel starburst derivative of triphenylamine with carbazole as an important substituent, was synthesized and reported previously.16,17 It has a low ionization potential (IP) of 4.73 eV, implying a strong electron donating nature and hole injecting properties. We have used it as an excellent hole injecting and transporting material in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).16 When PCATA was used alone as the hole transporting layer in PCATA/Alq3 double-layer OLEDs, yellow electroluminescence was found at low driving voltages as shown in Fig. 1
				(lower panel). It is attributed to exciplex emission due to a high hole injecting barrier (1.07 eV, using 5.8 eV IP of Alq3) at the PCATA/Alq3 interface, deduced from the intrinsic blue photoluminescence (PL) of PCATA at 460 nm and green PL of Alq3 at 530 nm. With increasing voltage, the hole barrier was overcome by the bias and consequently the emitting region shifted into the Alq3 layer. The same phenomena have been reported previously12,15,18 and it is well established that exciplex formation in OLEDs is a good indicator of efficient charge transfer at organic interfaces and thus good PV performance.7,12,15,18 In the present study an organic PV device was fabricated using PCATA as the electron donor, Alq3 as the electron acceptor layer, ITO-coated glass substrate as the anode, and Mg : Ag alloy as the cathode, and its PV properties were investigated.

The ITO/PCATA/Alq3/Mg : Ag device was fabricated by thermal evaporation in vacuum. Onto a clean and UV-ozone treated ITO substrate with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω
				□−1, the organic layers (36 nm for each layer) were vapor-deposited sequentially at a rate of 0.1–0.3 nm s−1 at a pressure of 5 × 10−6 mbar. Without breaking vacuum, a 200 nm Mg : Ag alloy film was deposited at a rate of 1 nm s−1 by coevaporation onto the Alq3 layer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PV devices in the light state were measured under an irradiance of 1.02 mW cm−2 from a 365 nm UV light source in ambient conditions at room temperature.

Fig. 2 shows the J–V curve of the PCATA/Alq3 device under monochromic UV illumination at 365 nm. The open-circuit voltage (VOC), the short-circuit current density (JSC), and the fill factor (FF) of the device reached 1.2 V, 0.048 mA cm−2, and 0.26, respectively. The quantum efficiency at JSC is calculated as 16%, which is several times that reported for the previous UV-sensitive organic PV cells.12,14,15 From the above parameters, the maximum monochromic power conversion efficiency of the present device reaches 1.42%, which is again the highest among all UV-sensitive organic PV devices reported.12,14,15 The J–V characteristics of the PCATA/Alq3 device in the dark state were measured as a curve crossing the origin of the J–V coordinates, confirming the photogeneration mechanism of the current and voltage in the light state.

To elucidate the generation mechanism of the photocurrent and photovoltage for the PV device, the spectral response of the PCATA/Alq3 device and the optical absorption of the individual films on quartz substrates with the same thickness as in the device were measured and are shown in Fig. 3. The calculated absorption curve of PCATA/Alq3 double-layer film based on the measured absorption spectra of the individual PCATA and Alq3 films is also given. Obviously the absorption spectrum of the PCATA/Alq3 double-layer film is practically the summation of the absorptions of the PCATA film and the Alq3 film. The absence of any new peak suggests little or no interaction between the ground states of PCATA and Alq3. The spectral response curve of the PCATA/Alq3 device shows the dependence of photovoltage on irradiation wavelength, as measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS50 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The spectral response curve with peaks at 325 and 365 nm is similar to the absorption spectrum of the PCATA/Alq3 film, indicating that the photocurrent generation of the device is induced by the optical absorption of both PCATA and Alq3. It should be noted that the response curve shifted slightly to red by a few nanometers compared to the absorption spectrum of the PCATA/Alq3 film. The intensity ratio of the peak at 325 nm to that at 365 nm in the response curve of the double-layer device is smaller than that in the absorption spectrum of the double-layer film. This difference may be caused by the lower transparency of the glass substrate to light with shorter wavelength, and is supported by the observation that the absorption of the present glass substrates (without ITO layer) is strong below 330 nm and increases with decreasing wavelength. If an ITO-coated quartz substrate was used to fabricate the PV devices instead of ITO-coated glass, the difference between the spectral response curve and the absorption spectrum of the PCATA/Alq3 film would be suppressed.

					(short dashes), and PCATA/Alq3
					(solid line) films on quartz substrates. The consistency of the calculated (dots) and the measured absorption spectra of the PCATA/Alq3 film indicates that the absorption of both PCATA and Alq3 contributed to the PV effect. 
Analyzing the energy level of the PCATA/Alq3 device further confirms the photoelectrical conversion mechanism of the device. The energy level diagram of the device and the photoelectrical conversion procedure are illustrated in Fig. 4. The CT state (PCATA+Alq3−) formed at the DA interface has an energy of ECT
				= IPD
				− EAA
				= 1.53 eV.7 While the donor or acceptor exciton has an energy Eex which equals the HOMO–LUMO gap Egap minus the exciton binding energy EB (typically 0.1–0.2 eV), i.e., Eex(D)

				= 2.6 − EBAlq3. The charge transfer dissociation at the DA interface can take place as long as the donor and/or the acceptor exciton energy is high enough to overcome the energy necessary for the CT state formation. In the present study, the spectral response curve indicates that the photovoltage generation is induced by the optical absorption of both PCATA and Alq3, suggesting that the exciton energy of both PCATA and Alq3 is high enough to participate in the charge transfer reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 4, after the exciton of PCATA or Alq3, i.e.
				(PCATA)* or (Alq3)*, is formed upon the irradiance, it diffuses through the organic layer to the DA interface. The charge-transfer reaction then occurs efficiently at the DA interface along two paths, as shown in Fig. 4, forming the free positive and negative charges, (PCATA)+ and (Alq3)−. Finally, the free charges migrate through the organic layers under the bias and are collected at the opposite electrodes.

To check the versatility of PCATA as a donor material also in other organic PV devices, TPBI was chosen as the electron acceptor layer to fabricate a PV device with the structure of ITO/PCATA(35 nm)/TPBI(35 nm)/Mg : Ag under deposition conditions. The J–V curve of the PCATA/TPBI device is also shown in Fig. 2. Upon irradiation with monochromic 365 nm UV light at 1.02 mW cm−2, the PCATA/TPBI device produced a short-circuit current density, JSC, of 0.066 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage, VOC, of 1.1 V, and a fill factor, FF, of 0.29. The PCATA/TPBI device has an open-circuit voltage slightly smaller than that of the PCTATA/Alq3 device. This might be due to different interface dipoles at the acceptor/metal interfaces of the two devices. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that the quantum efficiency at JSC and the maximum monochromic power conversion efficiency of the PCATA/TPBI device are 21.7% and 2.03%, respectively, which are higher than those of the PCATA/Alq3 device. The better performance of the PCATA/TPBI device may be attributed to the more efficient charge-transfer dissociation of excitons at the interface due to better energy level matching between PCATA and TPBI. The favorably high exciton energy Eex(A)

				= 4.73 − 2.8 = 1.93 eV of the CT state (PCATA+TPBI−) compared to (PCATA+Alq3−).
The operation stability of the un-encapsulated PCATA/Alq3 device was measured at a constant current density of 2 mA cm−2 under short-circuit conditions and constant 365 nm irradiation at 1.7 mW cm−2. After 50 hours' illumination, JSC decayed to 0.044 mA cm−2 from the original 0.065 mA cm−2, and the VOC decreased to 0.5 V from 1.1 V. Better stability is expected for encapsulated PCATA-containing devices, since oxygen and moisture in air are known to have deleterious effects on OLED and PV devices.
In summary, a novel starburst amine derivative, PCATA, was used as the donor layer in organic PV devices for the first time. PCATA is characterized by high sensitivity to UV light and low ionization potential, and thus strong electron donating properties. Under monochromic UV light irradiation at 365 nm, all the PV parameters including short-circuit current density JSC and quantum efficiency at JSC of the present PCATA-containing double-layer PV devices with either Alq3 or TPBI as electron acceptor layer are better than the corresponding values of all previously reported UV-sensitive organic PV devices. The superior performance of the PCATA-based PV devices is attributed to optimum energy level alignment and thus efficient exciton dissociation at the DA interface. The use of PCATA as electron donor material in organic PV fields can be extended to other devices with different electron acceptor layers. The present PV results demonstrate PCATA as an excellent electron-donating material for devices for ultraviolet light signal recording and detection. In addition, the present PCATA/Alq3 PV device is of interest in that it works as a bi-functional device, a UV-light sensitive PV device and an OLED.
