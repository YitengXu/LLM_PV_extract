    , Accepted 7th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractHalide perovskite single crystal of cubic HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) having excellent optoelectronic properties, such as narrow bandgap, large absorption coefficient and superior thermal stability has caught a surge of attention as a promising material for production of high-performance optoelectronic devices. However, at room temperature, the self-transformation of cubic FAPbI3 perovskite phase to non-perovskite phase leaves a critical roadblock to its practical viability. Herein, a simple alloying strategy by mixing methylammonium with formamidinium is developed to stabilize the FAPbI3 perovskite phase, hence achieving a highly stable mixed cation MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 perovskite single crystal over a span of 14 months. The MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal exhibits exceptional optoelectronic properties like high carrier mobility of 271 ± 60 cm2 s−1 V−1 and long diffusion length up to 254 μm, which are twice the values for sole MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 crystals. In addition, the photodetector based on MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal exhibits low detection limit of about 1 nW cm−2, high ON–OFF ratio of ∼1000, short response time of less than 200 μs, and impressive stability under aging in dark for 4 months or continuous photo-switching test for 1000 s.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have been recognized as one of the most promising and stunning semiconductor materials by virtue of their remarkable optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficient,1,2 tunable direct bandgap3 and long carrier diffusion length,4–7 which consequently thrust their extensive applications in solar cells,8–10 photocatalysis,11 photodetectors,12–15 lasers,16 light-emitting diodes,17 as well as field-effect transistors.18 Thus far, the overwhelming majority of perovskite devices are based upon polycrystalline films. However, they suffer immensely from a high density of traps and grain boundaries, implying an underlying roadblock to their further applications.4 In contrast, single crystals have been acknowledged to outperform polycrystalline films in yielding high-performance optoelectronic devices, attributing to their higher crystallinity, fewer defects, absence of grain boundaries and superior stability.13,19–21 Thus, fabricating perovskite single crystal is highly anticipated to realise the full potential of perovskite materials in building up high-performance optoelectronic devices.
Although CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) single crystal, possessing an exceptionally long carrier diffusion length over 175 μm,4 has been the widely studied perovskite material, HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3) is regarded as a more promising optoelectronic material for extended absorption spectrum and better thermal stability.22,23 The critical issue for FAPbI3 is that the perovskite structure of FAPbI3 (cubic phase, α-FAPbI3) is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature (RT), and thus spontaneously converts to a non-perovskite structure (hexagonal phase, δ-FAPbI3) with low mobility and conductivity, particularly in the presence of polar solvent vapour such as water or γ-butyrolactone.23,24 Hence, stabilizing the perovskite phase of FAPbI3 at RT leaves a burning question for contemporary studies. Recently, compositional engineering by incorporating smaller ions (such as CH3NH3+, Cs+, Rb+, Br−)25–31 into FAPbI3 structure has been verified to stabilize the cubic structure, which is attributed to the fine adjustment of Goldschmidt tolerance factor26 or the entropy increase induced by cation mixing.28 Accordingly, the mixed organic cation perovskite single crystals are highly expected to attain advanced optoelectronic performance since their polycrystalline thin films have outperformed pure MA or FA compounds in solar cells.31–35
Herein, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal was fabricated via a simple inverse temperature crystallization approach, presenting not only impressive long-term stability over a span of 14 months but also superior optoelectronic properties. Comparing with pure MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, higher mobility (271 ± 60 cm2 s−1 V−1), longer carrier lifetime (93 μs) and ultra-long carrier diffusion length (254 μm) were observed for the perovskite alloy single crystal, which are of critical importance with regard to highly efficient photodetectors. A desirable photodetector based on MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal was achieved, exhibiting short response time of less than 200 μs, wide linear dynamic range of 136.3 dB, and exceptional stability after storage in an opaque desiccator for 4 months. In addition, the response spectrum of the single crystal photodetector at zero bias displayed a narrow single peak near the absorption edge while intriguingly changing to a broadband from visible to near-infrared at high bias, indicating a dual-functional photodetector.
Experimental
Synthesis of perovskite single crystals
The perovskite single crystals were grown via a modified inverse temperature crystallization method.36 In brief, 1.0 M MAPbI3/FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving equimolar PbI2 and MAI/FAI in γ-butyrolactone at 60 °C overnight, whereas the mixed cation perovskite precursor solution was blended with MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 precursor solutions in a ratio of 1:1. The solutions were filtered using PTFE filter with 0.2 μm pore size. Seed crystals of 0.5–1 mm in size were first obtained by placing 2 mL precursor solutions at 160 °C for 30 min in an oil bath under ambient conditions. For MAPbI3 or mixed cation perovskite alloy single crystals, a corresponding seed crystal was placed into the fresh precursor solution that was heated at 120 °C for 3 hours to obtain crystal growth. To further increase the crystal size, the temperature was set to 125 °C for another hour. For FAPbI3 single crystals, similar procedure was implemented except the growth temperature, which was initially kept at 110 °C for 3 hours and then at 115 °C for another hour. The as-obtained large size single crystals were taken out from the hot precursor solutions, and then the residual solution was removed from their surfaces by clean room papers. Single crystals of ∼8 mm in size were mechanically polished along the (100) direction to a thickness of ∼1 mm and were further analysed for carrier transport and lifetime measurements, and used for the fabrication of photodetectors. All procedures were conducted under ambient conditions with humidity of 45–55%.
Characterization of perovskite single crystals
The powder XRD measurement was performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer operated at room temperature. The temperature-dependent XRD data was collected using Rigaku SmartLab, comprising a high-temperature oven chamber (Anton Paar HTK 1200N), with a step size of 0.01° and a speed of 0.2 s per step. Data collection at each temperature was carried out 5 minutes after stabilizing at the corresponding temperature. The 1H NMR spectra were collected at 298 K using Bruker 600 AVANAC III spectrometer equipped with Bruker BBO multinuclear probe (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany), and the spectra were analyzed using MNova software. 5 mg of the perovskite single crystals were dissolved in d6-DMSO, and the MA/FA ratio within each was calculated by comparison of the integrals of the CH3 group peak of MA+ (2.34, d) with the CH group peaks of FA+ (7.83, tt). Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TGA 209 (NETZSCH) system in an interval from 30 °C to 700 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 gas with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-5600 UV-vis spectrometer with an integrated sphere in diffuse-reflectance mode. The steady and transient state photoluminescence was recorded using the Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 Spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 472.0 nm.
The carrier transport properties of single crystals were estimated by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. Hole-only devices were fabricated by sputtering deposition of 80 nm gold electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces of ∼1 mm-thick crystal plates. The SCLC measurement was performed on the hole-only device in the dark under vacuum using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. For transient photovoltaic analysis, a semi-transparent 25 nm-thick Au layer was deposited on ∼1 mm-thick crystal plates, followed by attachment of the other side onto glass substrates using molten metallic Ga.
Relative dielectric constant measurement for mixed cation perovskite single crystals was carried out using an impedance analyzer (Agilent E4990A) over a wide frequency range from 500 Hz to 8 MHz. The relative dielectric constant ε of the as-prepared sample was calculated using the following formula: (1)where C is the measured value of capacitance, d is the thickness of the sample, A is the surface area, and ε0 is vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−14 F cm−1).
Single crystal photodetector fabrication and characterization
A semitransparent Au layer of 25 nm was deposited by sputtering on one (100) surface of the single crystal plates as the top electrode, and 60 nm Ti/80 nm Au was deposited successively on the opposite surface. The photocurrent response characteristics for the single crystal photodetectors were observed using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in a shield box. The external quantum efficiency spectra were measured on a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter, as a function of wavelength from 400 nm to 1000 nm using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The temporal response of the devices was measured under pulsed light from a function-generator-modulated 870 nm LED (∼1 mW cm−2) at different frequencies, and the transient photocurrent signal under −4 V bias was recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 2014C).
Results and discussion
Three species of perovskite single crystals (MAPbI3, α-FAPbI3 as well as mixed cation alloy) were grown in air via a modified inverse temperature crystallization method (see details in the Experimental section). To determine the precise MA+/FA+ ratio of the mixed cation perovskite crystals, 1H NMR spectra (seen in Fig. S1†) were observed by comparing the integrals of the CH3 group peak of MA+ (2.34, d) with the CH peaks of FA+ (7.83, tt), yielding a MA+/FA+ ratio of 0.45:0.55, which was slightly deviated from the feed ratio, possibly attributed to the lower solubility of FAPbI3.37 Thus, the formula MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 is used hereafter to refer to the mixed-cation perovskite crystals. As shown in Fig. 1a, the as-prepared three single crystals of ∼8 mm in size exhibited rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron or rhombic dodecahedron shapes with similar metallic black colour. After exposure in air with 45–55% relative humidity (RH) for a span of 14 months, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal still maintained the original black colour. However, the α-FAPbI3 crystal turned yellow and MAPbI3 single crystal exhibited pale yellow spots on the surface (Fig. 1b), implying a superior long-term stability for mixed cation MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal compared to FAPbI3 and MAPbI3. Such a result was further validated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns described in Fig. 1c and d. Primarily, the MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 crystals displayed a satisfying match with tetragonal and cubic phase, without any impurity, respectively.38,39 Moreover, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 presented PXRD patterns similar to those of α-FAPbI3 with slightly enlarged diffraction angles caused by MA+ incorporation, indicating a desired cubic perovskite phase as that of α-FAPbI3. After being stored in air (RH 45–55%) for 14 months, the FAPbI3 single crystal had almost entirely converted from pristine α-phase to δ-phase (yellow color) due to the thermodynamically unstable structure of α-FAPbI3. For MAPbI3, the detectable PbI2 impurity in PXRD pattern was derived from significant degradation on crystal surface, resulting from the hygroscopic nature of methylammonium. It is noteworthy that the structure of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 had remained unchanged (Fig. 1d), proving the advanced long-term stability by alloying FA+ with MA+.

Furthermore, the phase behaviour of three perovskite crystals was investigated by temperature-dependent XRD (Fig. S2†). On one hand, FAPbI3 showed a δ-to-α phase transition point at 140–170 °C (Fig. S2a†), whereas the β-to-α phase transition point for MAPbI3 occurred at 50–60 °C (Fig. S2b†), corresponding to the previous reports.25,38 On the other hand, the as-prepared MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal retained its cubic structure over the total measured range (Fig. S2c†), which should be attributed to its phase transition below room temperature,30 demonstrating a thermodynamically stable cubic structure of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 in the range of RT to 200 °C. In addition, the thermal stability of various perovskite single crystals was further studied by thermogravimetric analysis, and the results are described in Fig. S3.† It is clear that the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 perovskite crystal shows similar decomposition temperature (∼300 °C) to that of FAPbI3 and higher than that of MAPbI3 (∼240 °C), which should be ascribed to its more stable structure. Overall, by incorporating MA+ into FAPbI3, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal attains superior stability at ambient air as well as at high temperature, indicating an excellent environmental tolerance resulting from a thermodynamically stable structure and high crystallinity.
Apart from structure stability, optical properties of the as-prepared MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystals were also investigated. In the absorption spectra (Fig. S4a†), clear band edges without absorption tails were observed, manifesting high-quality crystals with low defect concentration.5,40 Comparing with the absorption edges of pure FAPbI3 single crystal (888 nm) and MAPbI3 single crystal (832 nm), the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal had an absorption edge located at 862 nm and a bandgap of 1.46 eV (extracted from the Tauc plots in Fig. S4b†). The photoluminescence (PL) peak (seen in Fig. S5†) of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal (808 nm) was also located between that of MAPbI3 (785 nm) and FAPbI3 (832 nm). The PL peak values of all these three crystals were smaller than their absorption onsets, implying an extinguished PL, which consequently improved the utilization of photon.4,41 In addition, the PL lifetimes of various MAxFA1−xPbI3 (x = 0, 0.14, 0.45, 0.77, and 1.0) single crystals (the corresponding XRD spectra seen in Fig. S6†) were investigated to screen the possible optimum composition. The PL decay curves (Fig. S7†) exhibited a fast (τ1) and a slow (τ2) dynamics, whose bi-exponential fitted parameters are tabulated in Table S1.† The MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal displayed the longest lifetime (2122 ns), indicating a low defect level, which was linked to better structural stability,42 and it could be speculated that x = 0.45 may be the optimum composition. Thus, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal proved to possess a satisfactory absorption range and narrow bandgap, which favours its extended application in optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors.
Moreover, carrier transport parameters, such as carrier mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length are profound factors that contribute to high-performance optoelectronic devices. Dark current–voltage (I–V) measurements (Fig. 2) of MAPbI3, α-FAPbI3 and MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystals were performed to estimate the charge transport properties, utilizing a device structure of Au/single crystal plates/Au. All the I–V traces appeared to have linear tendency at low voltage range (ohmic region) and transformed to superlinearity beyond trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which was determined by the defect density using the following equation: (2)where e is the elementary charge, nt is defect density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and L is the thickness of single crystals.4,5 The relative dielectric constants ε of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are 32,4,43 and 62 (ref. 22) respectively, while the ε for MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 measured from the capacitance–frequency measurement (Fig. S8†) is 80. The trap density was calculated as 1.1 × 1010 cm−3 and 8.2 × 109 cm−3 for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 respectively, corresponding to previous reports.4,5,22,24 In contrast, the mixed-cation MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 perovskite single crystal possesses a lower trap density of 2.6 × 109 cm−3, resulting from its more stable cubic structure that could efficiently avoid the disorders and defects caused by phase transition. At a sufficiently high bias, the dark currents show a quadratic dependence (n = 2), known as the Child's region according to the Mott–Gurney's law: (3)where JD is the current density and Vb is the applied voltage.4,5 To examine the Child's region marked in Fig. 2, the I/V2versus voltage curves were plotted, as displayed in Fig. S9† and showed constant values, which indicated that the plots fitted well to the Mott–Gurney's law. From the curves fitting in the Child's region, the carrier mobility μ of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 single crystal was estimated as 65 ± 6 cm2 s−1 V−1 and 150 ± 15 cm2 s−1 V−1, respectively. However, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal showed enhanced carrier mobility (271 ± 60 cm2 s−1 V−1), indicating improved carrier transport properties for alloyed perovskite, which would be attributed to its reduced defects. According to the ohmic region of I–V curves, the conductivity σ of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal was estimated as 1.7 × 10−7 Ω−1 cm−1, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of both MAPbI3 (1.1 × 10−8 Ω−1 cm−1) and FAPbI3 (2.2 × 10−8 Ω−1 cm−1) single crystals due to the higher carrier mobility. The free carrier densities (nc) of the crystals listed in Table S1† were estimated by relating the conductivity and mobility using the following expression:5 (4)

All these single crystals exhibited similar low dark carrier densities of about 109 cm−3 as the lowest value of perovskite single crystals reported previously.24 Such resultant low dark carrier concentration is in favor of high-performance photodetectors.
Carrier lifetime is further characterized by transient photovoltaic (TPV) method. Representative TPV curves at 0.1 sun illumination (white LED, 10 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3a. The carrier lifetime τ under various light intensities was evaluated by fitting the transient decay to the single exponential function (Fig. 3b). The carrier lifetime (80 μs) of MAPbI3 single crystal measured via TPV method was consistent with the value (82 μs) reported by Huang et al.,4 whereas the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal had a slightly longer lifetime. Combining the measured mobility and lifetime, the diffusion length LD was estimated by the following relation: (5)where kB is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.24 The carrier diffusion length for MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal was calculated as 254 μm, twice the value for MAPbI3 (115 μm) and FAPbI3 (118 μm) single crystals, which have substantially outperformed the existent best-performing data reported in previous literature.4 The detailed comparison of properties reported in the current study and those reported in previous literature is shown in Table S2 (ESI).† The outstanding charge transport property of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal further favors its potential application in high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors.

To explore the optoelectronic performance of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal, a photodetector with simple sandwich architecture was fabricated, as schemed in Fig. 4a. The low work function metal Ti (4.3 eV) was selected to extract electrons, and a thin Au film with high work function of 5.1 eV served as semi-transparent anode to allow light to penetrate. Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector measured as a function of a series of bias voltages (0 to −4 V). Clearly, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector exhibited a narrow spectral response at 867 nm around the absorption edge at zero bias due to severe surface-charge recombination,12,20 whereas it transformed to a broadband response at higher applied bias. Therefore, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector could work in two modes: at zero bias, narrowband detection in specific near-infrared region (840–890 nm); and at bias ≥1 V, broadband detection extending from visible to near-infrared region. In other words, the dual-functional photodetectors could switch between the response bands more easily by changing the applied bias, which could help to extend the photodetection applications.44Fig. 4c shows the typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristics under dark conditions and 870 nm LED illumination. The non-linear dark current curve exhibited a strong rectifying behaviour, indicating a built-in field as a Schottky junction cell,45 that helped in obtaining a low dark current at reverse bias voltage. Under a weak illumination of about 20 μW cm−2, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector showed an open circuit voltage of ∼250 mV and an enhanced short-circuit current of 6 × 10−4 mA cm−2, indicating its potential as self-powered near-infrared detector.

(c) Dark current and photocurrent of the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector under illumination of 20 μW cm−2 from 870 nm LED. (d) Linear dynamic range of the photodetector at 0 V or −1 V bias under 870 nm LED illumination. 
To evaluate the optical detection ability of the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector at both narrowband and broadband mode, linear dynamic range (LDR) was measured at zero and −1 V bias under 870 nm LED illumination of various intensities. The LDR is commonly expressed in a logarithmic scale using the following equation: (6)where J and L are the current density and input light irradiance, respectively.14 The upper and lower limit of the LDR is provided by the value that deviates from linearity region. Fig. 4d shows a broader LDR (136.3 dB) at −1 V bias than that (87.7 dB) at zero bias, attributed to the improved response at −1 V bias, which is comparable to the best performing perovskite photodetectors.13,14 Owing to the low dark current, MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector exhibited a low detection limit, demonstrating a value of ∼3 nW cm−2 at zero bias and even below 1 nW cm−2 at −1 V bias.
The response speed is closely related to the charge transport property of the material. The time required for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% in the alternating dark and light conditions is generally defined as the rise time (trise) of photodetectors, whereas the time required to decrease is defined as the decay time (tfall).45 The response time of the photodetector was tested at −1 V bias under the illumination of 1 mW cm−2 from 870 nm LED, modulated at 250 Hz. As shown in Fig. 5a, the device based on MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal showed a short rise and fall time of 34 μs and 164 μs. The response speed of the present device is determined from the charge transit time t across the single crystal, which can be calculated with the measured mobility by the formula: (7)where d is the crystal thickness and V is the applied voltage.46 For the photodetector of ∼1 mm-thickness, the transit time was calculated as 37 μs, which agreed well with the measured response time. By recording the response current as a function of pulse frequency, the 3 dB cutoff frequency was calculated to be over 23 kHz, which could be be further increased by using thinner crystal plates, implying its potential in the optical-communication or remote control applications.

Since the long-term stability is a major concern facing organic–inorganic halide perovskite optoelectronic devices, the I–V characteristics of MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector were recorded after an aging time of 4 months at RT, with control groups of pure MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 single crystal photodetectors in the same batch (Fig. S10†). Although the devices were stored in an opaque desiccator (RH ∼ 10%), the FAPbI3 single crystal photodetector lost almost all the photoresponse performance caused by its spontaneous conversion to δ phase with passage of time. Moreover, the MAPbI3 single crystal photodetector also showed a severe drop in photocurrent possibly attributed to the surface degradation. Herein, owing to more stable structure and improved environmental tolerance, the photodetector based on MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal endows its long-term application. In addition, the long-term photo-switching characteristics of the photocurrent were also measured at zero bias and −1 V bias for the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector under alternating dark and light conditions. The curves in Fig. 6 show that photocurrents at both zero and −1 V bias remained stable for a long period, though prominent spikes existed in the light and dark current measurements that resulted from slow movement of charged defect ions.47,48 It should be noted that the dark currents in the chop I–T plots are lower compared to the values in I–V curves (Fig. 4) at the same bias. This mismatch might originate from the capacitance effect in the I–V scan caused by ion migration.48,49 Hence, the more reliable ON–OFF ratios should be calculated from the chop I–T plots, which were ∼60 at −1 V bias and ∼1000 at zero bias. The ultra-low dark current measurements at zero bias highly improved the ON–OFF ratio.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the fabrication of alloyed MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal and its utilization as a satisfying photodetector, achieving long-term stability and prominent carrier transport properties. Compared with pure MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 single crystals, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal maintained impressive stability over a span of 14 months in ambient air owing to its thermodynamically stable structure and reduced defect density. In addition, the mixed cation MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 perovskite single crystal has also been found to possess twice the carrier diffusion length (254 μm) than pure MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 single crystal. Thus, by virtue of higher carrier mobility and lower trap density, the MA0.45FA0.55PbI3 single crystal photodetector achieved a short response time less than 200 μs, a high ON–OFF ratio of ∼1000 and a low detection limit of 1 nW cm−2. Overall, given that fabricating mixed cation perovskite single crystal can evade the respective drawbacks of each pure one as well as improve the optoelectronic properties simultaneously, it is worthy to anticipate breakthroughs that are more significant and explore wider applications in future optoelectronic devices with alloyed perovskite single crystals.
