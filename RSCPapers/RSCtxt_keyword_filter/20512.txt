    , Accepted 25th June 2015First published on 25th June 2015AbstractTypical rod-like viruses (the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and the Bacteriophage M13) are biological nanostructures that couple a 1D mono-dispersed morphology with a precisely defined topology of surface spaced and orthogonal reactive domains. These biogenic scaffolds offer a unique alternative to synthetic nano-platforms for the assembly of functional molecules and materials. Spatially resolved 1D arrays of inorganic–organic hybrid domains can thus be obtained on viral nano-templates resulting in the functional arrangement of photo-triggers and catalytic sites with applications in light energy conversion and storage. Different synthetic strategies are herein highlighted depending on the building blocks and with a particular emphasis on the molecular design of viral-templated nano-interfaces holding great potential for the dream-goal of artificial photosynthesis.
Bio-inspired architectures on viral templates
The perfect machinery of Natural Photosynthesis, powering our daily life with solar energy, is shaped by a modular network of photocomplexes, where molecular/nano-range order and distances are precisely tuned on membrane-bound compartments.1,2 Along these guidelines, the current frontier of Artificial Photosynthesis looks at a multi-component, an interconnected system, where an engineered cross-talk of photoactive and catalytic building blocks can boost efficiency and implement optimization/repair strategies. Indeed, electron transfer rates, junctions and potential gradients can be tuned within a nano-structured environment to address both kinetic and thermodynamic bottlenecks of solar fuel productions, reducing losses and preventing deactivation.2–4 With this aim, a plethora of synthetic nano-scaffolds has been proposed as templates for the modular assembly of the key photosynthetic components, including (i) light-harvesting antennae, (ii) charge separation centers, (iii) redox mediators and multi-redox catalysts.5 In this scenario, the use of biogenic nano-templates has a major appeal, considering their renewable origin, the high density of surface reactive sites, and site-specific synthetic protocols available for their derivatization.6,7 In particular, owing to their mono-dispersed and fibrillar morphology, rod-like viruses are attracting growing interest for the design of innovative nano-composites featuring higher dimensionality (from 1D to 2D and 3D) and emerging properties.8–14 These viral nanostructures can evolve to hierarchical architectures by multiple non-covalent functionalization of symmetrical reactive groups on the capsid surface, ultimately yielding hybrid bio-metal or bio-polymer conjugates, higher order supramolecular virus assemblies (thanks to head-to-tail or lateral sheet growth), or virus-surface constructs. In addition, the coat protein residues can be modified by covalent strategies thus providing robust and spatially defined linkers for grafting functional molecules with sub-nanoscale resolution. Furthermore, virion particles can be produced on a large scale, via environmentally benign procedures, by using suitable/abundant infected hosts, and genetically modified to meet the synthetic modification requirements. In this perspective, rod-like viruses can stand as alternatives to classical 1D nano-scaffolds as carbon nanotubes, while providing suitable constructs serving as (i) heterogeneous supports of transition metal catalysts and nanoparticles (NPs), (ii) a high surface area template for the co-anchoring of photo-activated molecular donors/acceptors, (iii) a spacer element to funnel and direct the sequential electron-transfers, (iv) modular scaffolds to shape material interfaces and (v) nano-conjugates with advanced properties in the field of renewable energy.15 Selected examples on the use of filamentous Tobacco Mosaic Virus and Bacteriophage M13 will be described herein, by addressing their valuable potential in the assembly of photosynthetic nano-wires and hierarchical nano-materials.

Tobacco Mosaic Virus has a tubular and rigid structure, 300 nm in length, with an inner diameter of 4 nm and an outer diameter of 18 nm (Fig. 1).16 This structure stems from the self-assembly of 2130 identical coat proteins (TMVCPs) of 17.5 kDa molecular weight, which form a right-handed helix (with a pitch of 2.3 nm) around a single strand of genomic RNA.17 Each TMVCP subunit is composed of a chain of 158 amino acids that are folded into four main alpha-helices, connected by inner and outer loops, while both the N and C termini of the amino acid chain are exposed towards the outer surface of the virion. Due to the excess of terminal oxygen-groups (aspartic acid, Asp, glutamic acid, Glu, and tyrosine, Tyr), it has an isoelectric point (Ip) of 3.5–3.9.18,19
 Fig. 1  Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) of TMV (from left to right: disordered bundle, single unit and top view of a disassembled disk), and its schematic representation. 
Being structurally robust and biologically stable in the pH range 2.5–8.5, until 90 °C and in a variety of organic solvents, TMV is one of the most widely studied viral nano-templates.20 Thanks to the identical morphology of each turn of the virus helix, TMV can form long fibers and beams through head-to-tail interactions.21 On the other hand, side interactions can be exploited to form supported films with variable thickness, orientation, and surface coverage, by means of convective assembly techniques.22,23
TMV is characterized by a self-healing behavior as well as by a defined disassembly mechanism that initiates with the removal of coat protein subunits from the 5′-end of the viral RNA. This process, which naturally occurs upon entry of TMV into the host cells, can also be induced by an alkaline treatment and exploited to anchor TMV units onto solid substrates bearing complementary probe DNA chains. Recently, it has been demonstrated that biotechnologically engineered RNA chains, containing the TMV origin of the assembly (OAs) domain, can be attached onto surfaces decorated with DNA oligomers. Then, RNA acts as a guide for stacking TMVCP monomers, yielding TMV-like assemblies.24–26
The remarkable self-assembly capability of TMVCPs is also evident under RNA-free conditions.27 While TMVCPs remain isolated under alkaline conditions (pH 8), they stack into double-layered disk-like structures under neutral conditions (pH 7) or multi-layered TMV-like structures under acidic conditions (pH 5.5).28
TMV can be chemically/genetically modified to enhance its affinity/reactivity towards specific target materials. Potential sites for desired modifications include N and C termini, as well as surface loops between alpha-helices. Chemical modification can be obtained upon covalent derivatization of wild-type TMV,29 whereas genetic engineering allows the replacement of one or more aminoacidic residues with more reactive ones.30 Engineering of TMV can be achieved by complementary DNA (cDNA) mutagenesis, in order to produce infectious RNA transcripts. Then, the last ones infect the host tobacco plant, which acts as the factory for the production of the modified virus.31 Alternatively, mutant TMVCP monomers can be expressed into Escherichia coli (E. coli).32,33
The Bacteriophage M13 is an infecting agent for E. coli, and consists of a single-stranded DNA core surrounded by a semi-flexible protein coat.34 It has an even higher aspect ratio, with a 6.6 nm diameter and an 880 nm length. This structure results from 2700 copies of the major-coat protein (P8) arranged in a helical array, with a 5-fold symmetry axis, around a single-stranded DNA molecule.35 Four minor coat proteins (P3, P6, P7, P9) are present as about 5 copies per unit and are located at the ends of the filamentous viral particle (Fig. 2). The P8 protein is composed of three distinct domains: (i) a negatively charged region, at the amino terminal end, forming the outer, hydrophilic surface; (ii) a positively charged region at the carboxyl terminal end, which lines the internal part; (iii) a hydrophobic region, which is responsible for the interactions between P8 subunits and allows the stabilization of the phage structure.36

As TMV, M13 can be genetically modified. In most cases, non-natural binding motifs have been identified through biopanning, so as to allow the conjugation with inorganic particles, carbon nanotubes and other functional units.37
Thanks to their structural and surface properties, rod-like viruses have been considered for the assembly of composite energy materials. The current methods to fabricate virus-based nano-ensembles, including their integration within conductive/semiconductive layers and surface immobilization strategies will be described in the next paragraphs. Building on this knowledge, the design of innovative viral architectures with application for solar energy conversion will be finally discussed.
Supramolecular assembly of viral bio-hybrids for energy applications
Surface properties of the native capsid lie at the basis of diverse decoration protocols involving either multiple, non-covalent interactions with molecular and polymeric systems, or metal coatings. Indeed, the Ip of native TMV particles is consistent with a resident negative charge of the nano-material, in neutral aqueous media, which is conveniently counter-balanced by electrostatic interactions with multi-cationic species. On the other hand, the viral surface contains a significant number of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues, which evolve to protonated ammonium residues at acidic pH (<3.5), thus switching the favorable interaction with polyanions. In general, neutralization of the surface charges can foster a mutual organization of TMV units into parallel beams, giving rise to hierarchical, extended structures.38
In this paragraph, the use of polyelectrolyte and/or transition metal coatings is described to provide insights into the fabrication of virus-based nanowires (NWs) for electrodic devices.
TMV self-assembly driven by polymeric interfaces
The interaction of cationic polymers with the outer TMV surface is attracting broad interest, as a way to obtain composite materials characterized by great processability.39–43 In particular, aniline or pyrrole precursors have been polymerized in situ, in the presence of TMV as a template, leading to conducting polyaniline (PANI) or polypyrrole (PPy)45 nanofibers, whose morphology (20–22 nm diameter, up to 10 μm length) is controlled by head-to-tail interactions of the native virion units as well as by the solution pH.40–42,44 Interestingly, the addition of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) as a dopant makes the fibers more water-soluble and conductive, while preventing their aggregation.45
Owing to the smaller diameter and higher aspect ratio, M13 enables the preparation of elastic composite fibers featuring even better processability. In this case, however, the introduction of carboxylic groups (upon derivatization of the Lys groups with glutaric anhydride) is required to improve the interaction with PANI.46
These properties are instrumental to impart high surface area and electronic conductivity (up to 0.1 S cm−1) to a virus-based electrode interface, which can be prepared, for example, by spin-coating.
Metal-based co-factors and advanced deposition techniques for TMV processing
Divalent metals like Ba2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ can be used to obtain ordered TMV aggregates, whose structure strictly depends on the ion type.18,47–49 Indeed, by controlling concentration, pH and ionic strength, the addition of metal ions with high binding constant towards carboxylic acids (such as Cd2+) has been reported to promote the cross-linking of native TMV units with a high level of organization.47
The nucleation and growth of metal clusters (Ag, Au, Pt) on TMV surfaces are instead obtained under reducing conditions.50–53 According to tailored reduction protocols, specifically designed for the different metal ions, TMV metallization is selectively achieved on the outer cylindrical surface in the form of coalesced NPs with <10 nm diameter. In addition, since only a rather flexible loop of the TMVCP is present near RNA, metal ions can diffuse within the 4 nm-wide central channel to yield nucleation and constrained growth of aligned metal NPs, in the form of 100–600 nm long metal/alloys NWs with 3–4 nm diameter (e.g. NWs of Ag, Ni, Co).54,55,69
A controlled deposition of metal NPs is also obtained by electroless deposition (ELD) following a two-step process.56,57 In the first step, the surface of the TMV particle is activated with noble metal NPs produced by the reduction of Pt2+ or Pd2+ complexes; then the TMV suspension is immersed in a plating solution containing hetero-metal ions (Co2+ or Ni2+ salts) and reductants (such as dimethylamine-borane, (CH3)2NHBH3).55 The nucleation process is catalyzed by the noble metal NPs and then it proceeds autocatalytically, so as to obtain a continuous metal deposition. This approach is even more efficient when using genetically modified virions (TMV1-cys) in which one extra cysteine residue is present at the N-terminus of each TMVCP. Indeed, the resulting thiol-rich surface provides optimal metal (Ag, Au, Pd, Pt) binding sites for the electroless deposition of metallic clusters.56,57 In this way, metal coatings are denser (up to 40 nm thickness) and more stable than those obtained on wild type TMV, resulting in conductive metal nanotube-like structures.
The TMVCP functional groups play a key role in the surface-controlled deposition of many other inorganic materials, such as metal sulfides and oxides. Indeed, composite nanotubes or protein-confined NWs can be generated by applying bio-mineralization or sol–gel procedures (Fig. 3).58,59 For example, Shenton et al. reported: (i) mineralization with iron oxide (2 nm film), resulting from the addition of NaOH to a dispersion of TMV in acidic Fe2+/Fe3+ solution; (ii) a sol–gel procedure involving the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in acidified ethanol, with the formation of a 3 nm layer of silica; (iii) nucleation of CdS (16 nm thickness) or (iv) PbS crystallites (30 nm thickness) upon exposure to H2S gas of buffered suspension of TMV in CdCl2 or Pb(NO3)2 solutions, respectively.60

Other strategies for metal coating include advanced deposition techniques such as electrodeposition,61,62 physical vapor deposition (PVD)63 and atomic layer deposition (ALD). The latter procedure, consisting in pulsed and sequential dosing of suitable inorganic precursors at temperature lower than 100 °C, is fully compatible with biological scaffolds and it has been used to produce uniform coatings of Al2O3 or TiO2.64,65
Sol–gel coating of TMV, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment to remove the biogenic template, has been reported by Fujikawa and Kunitake to yield hollow titania nanotubes.66 However, the synergistic value of composite bio-hybrids is highlighted by low-temperature electron mobility of the system, which turns out to be higher with respect to TMV-free semiconductor nanotubes.67,68
Integration of biomineralized viral composites into electrodes and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
Controlled surface deposition/anchoring of rod-like viruses is crucial vis-à-vis the engineering of electrodic interfaces. TMV displays a spontaneous adsorption affinity with respect to different materials, like gold, silica, mica and glass.69 In addition, the use of metal cations as co-factors may be instrumental to control the orientation of TMV particles onto a patterned solid.49 More interestingly, advanced strategies have shown the possibility of designing vertically aligned arrays of rod-like bio-composites. Metallization of the resulting TMV nano-forests, following the strategies described above, has allowed the preparation of mechanically and thermally stable 3D conductive interfaces with definite potential for energy devices, including batteries, DSSC, fuel cells.
In detail, modified TMV1-cys can be grafted on gold surfaces, exploiting gold–thiol bonds with the most exposed cysteine at the 3′-end. Due to the preferential vertical orientation of TMV particles, carpet-like morphologies can be obtained, exhibiting almost one order of magnitude increase of surface area.70,71
The unique characteristic of this approach is the direct assembly of TMV nano-forests onto electrodes obtained in a buffered aqueous environment with no need of other binder additives. Furthermore, the TMV forest provides a vertically aligned template for Ni2+ ELD (Fig. 4), to obtain a high surface area current collector. Contrary to wild-type virus, TMV1-cys bonding with Au is retained during mineralization. When used in Ni–Zn batteries, Ni/TMV1-cys assembled on a gold substrate exhibits appropriate charge–discharge behavior for several operation cycles, producing a 6-fold increase of average discharge capacity in comparison with planar Ni cathodes.70,72

Vertically aligned Ni/TMV1-cys templates are amenable to versatile core–shell structures, upon further decoration of their outer surface.73 While the electronically conductive metal-core provides an intimate electronic connection between the shell material, distributed along the entire nanorod, and the main current collector, additional coating layers can be used to minimize mechanical stresses and improve functionality.74
TMV1-cys has been used to template the preparation of silicon-based anodes, as a promising alternative to commercial graphite anodes within lithium-ion batteries. The nanostructured morphology, imparted by the aligned virion particles, is instrumental to assist the high volume change (300–400%) during Li+ insertion and extraction on Si, thus avoiding particle pulverization and capacity fading.63,75 An anodic system has been obtained through vertical alignment of Si/Ni/TMV1-cys, with 300 nm diameter, on a gold-coated stainless steel current collector, as a result of the Pd/Ni plating procedure, followed by silicon Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). Si/Ni/TMV1-cys coated disks have been assembled into coin cells, and used with Li foil as a counter electrode and a LiPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as an electrolyte. The excellent cyclic stability and high capacity of the electrode have been demonstrated after more than 340 cycles between 0.0 and 1.5 V at 2000 mA g−1, with more than 1100 mA h g−1 capacity retention. Moreover, silicon expansion, created after repeated Li+ insertions and extractions cycles, results in an advantageous sponge-like silicon structure, which enhances both efficiency and anode stability.63 As a further development, the deposition of an amorphous layer of n-type doped Si featuring higher electronic conductivity has significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance, thus increasing the capacity of 630 mA h g−1 with respect to undoped Si, with 2150 mA h g−1 capacity retention after 90 cycles between 0.02 and 1.5 V at 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5).62

As an additional example of sophisticated multilayer energy storage, TMV1-cys was used to construct high capacity anodes in sodium-ion batteries, an appealing, low cost alternative to lithium batteries. 3D C/Sn/Ni/TMV1cys multi-layer nanostructures were assembled on a Au-coated stainless steel current collector.76 On a 50 nm Ni conductive sublayer, Sn NPs (20 nm) followed by carbon (5 nm) were sequentially layered, respectively, through PVD and Radio Frequency (RF) magneton sputtering deposition.
The electrochemical performance of this system was studied in coin cells using metallic Na as a counter electrode, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate as an electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, between 0.05 and 1.5 V at a current density of 50 mA g−1, has highlighted the superior electrochemical performance toward Na-ion storage and release in comparison to Sn thin films, providing around 730 mA h g−1 capacity in the initial cycles and 55% retention after 150 cycles (vs. only 9% for 2D Sn). Due to the huge Sn volume change (500%) during sodiation/desodiation cycles, the carbon coating is pivotal to minimize NP aggregation and pulverization.
Among metal oxides, TiO2 is considered a stable material, with a major appeal for lithium-ion batteries. A 20 nm thick anatase layer has thus been deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) onto Ni/TMV1-cys structures, followed by annealing in air at 450 °C.65 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) has been used to examine the Li+ intercalation/deintercalation processes in the range 2.6 V to 1 V (vs. Li+/Li, at a rate of 0.5 mV s−1), showing a pair of cathodic/anodic peaks at 1.68 V and 2.17 V respectively, whose current intensity is two orders of magnitude higher compared to biotemplate-free electrodes. As a result of the lower impedance, the rate performance, investigated in the range 50–600 mA g−1, is 2–3 times higher than that of the 2D films. In addition, an excellent stability has been observed at a low current rate (147 mA g−1) with an average fading of only 0.026% per cycle within the first 650 cycles of operation (185 mA h g−1 residual capacity).
In another example, crystalline V2O5 has been deposited (30 nm thickness) on Ni/TMV1-cys structures by means of ALD, involving alternate pulses of vanadium triisopropoxide and ozone at 170 °C (Fig. 6a). The resulting assembly was used for Li+-ion batteries resulting in the fabrication of a cathode, with specific capacity 7–8 times higher than that of planar V2O5 electrodes (Fig. 6b) and without significant fading even after 50 cycles.77 As an interesting example of hierarchical micro/nanoelectrode fabrication, the V2O5/Ni/TMV1-cys assembly was grown on gold micropillars (60 μm tall and 20 μm in diameter), with a further 3-fold capacity increase (Fig. 6c and d).78

Polycrystalline RuO2 has been successfully deposited by ALD on TiN/Ni/TMV1-cys heterostructures. The formation of a layered system with increased complexity has been monitored by TEM/EDX analysis, which confirms a 20 nm TMV core, a 30 nm Ni coating, a TiN layer of 10–20 nm and a RuO2 layer of 20–30 nm. The resulting material has been used along with a Nafion® ionomer acting as a solid proton-conducting electrolyte. At ambient humidity levels, the resulting supercapacitor displays 80% of charge/discharge capability after 25000 cycles.79
A similar concept lies at the basis of a unique example of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell for solar energy conversion. In this case, TMV1-cys provides the nano-template for the engineering of a nanocrystalline CuO-based photocathode. TMV1-cys, initially plated with Ni, followed by sputter deposition with ITO (thickness of ∼60 nm), is then coated with a CuO film with variable thickness (Fig. 7). The 3D electrode morphology and the precise control on the surface nano-structure are pivotal to optimize photon capture and conversion. Indeed, the spatial distribution of the TMV-coated nanorods, with distances approaching the wavelength of the incident photons (500 nm), leads to significant suppression of the light reflection (from 13% down to 3%) and hence an improved photon utilization, thus reaching 3.15 mA cm−2 photocurrent density under 1 sun irradiation, at a bias voltage of −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl.80

The M13 bacteriophage was extensively used by Belcher's group as a sacrificial biotemplate, for the synthesis of nano-tubular metal oxides (IrO2 or MnxCo3−xO4 where x = 0, 1, 2), phosphates (a-FePO4), sulfides (Zn, CdS) and noble metals (Co, Pt, Ag, Au), engineered for electrodic applications.37,81–88 In this case, to enhance the NP interaction with the viral surface, two major modifications have been considered: (i) a modified M13 virus with a Au-binding peptide motif on the P8 major coat protein, (ii) M13 viruses bearing 3 or 4 glutamate residues (M13:AE3 or M13:E4 with E = glutamic acid, A = alanine) fused to the N-terminus of each P8 copy.
For example, crystalline Co3O4 nanowires have been obtained after incubation of M13:E4 in aqueous cobalt chloride solution to promote cobalt ion binding, followed by reduction with NaBH4 and spontaneous reoxidation in water. Positive electrodes were thus prepared by mixing the virus-based nanowires, Super P (MMMCarbon) carbon black, and poly(vinylidenefluoride)-hexafluoropropylene as binders. A Li metal foil was used as a negative electrode and LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate was used as an electrolyte, to yield 600 mA h g−1 over 20 cycles. Au nanoparticles were also interspersed among Co3O4, to get a 30% increase of specific capacity, owing to the enhanced reduction kinetics.82
The system has been further implemented by a multilayer assembly coupled with soft lithography methods. Before cobalt oxide nucleation, the M13:E4 was deposited onto patterned multilayers of cationic linear-polyethylenimine (LPEI) and anionic polyacrylic acid (PAA), acting as a solid electrolyte and separator for Li ion transport. The surface mobility of electrostatically bound M13 viruses leads to the formation of a 2D liquid crystalline assembly of ordered viruses.82 Microcontact printing has been proposed as a general strategy for the design and positioning of the microbattery electrodes onto rigid or flexible substrates, as demonstrated with platinum microband current collectors.89
As an interesting example of nano-template cross-fertilization strategies, M13:E4 virion particles have been associated with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).90 In particular, the M13 bacteriophage has been successfully exploited to prepare TiO2-NWs networks for the engineering of advanced photoanodes for DSSC technology. With respect to conventional TiO2 NPs-based materials, the linear morphology dictated by the viral templates is instrumental to increase the electron diffusion length, ultimately improving electron transport from a photoexcited dye to the current collector.91 In addition, the high surface area of the resulting photoanode enhances the contact with the electrolyte, thereby increasing the charge mobility and minimizing back-recombinations. In particular, a core–shell structure (Fig. 8) is obtained by the use of a M13:E4 virus, bearing a tailored peptide sequence for SWCNT binding (enriched with aromatic residues, such as histidine and tyrosine), upon low temperature hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides. The resulting assembly was finally annealed at 600 °C to remove the viral scaffolds and to ensure a better contact between the SWCNTs and TiO2. Once integrated in a photoanode, in the presence of the dye N719, the material affords a better electron diffusion, with respect to M13-free procedures, and leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.6%.92 Interestingly, the sacrificial viral templates can be further shaped by taking advantage of polymeric coatings (see previous discussion), to favour the formation of a porous sub-structure with improved interconnection between TiO2 crystallites, thus promoting electron funneling and preventing charge recombinations.93

Following a different assembly procedure, a M13-based hydrogel network has been cross-linked onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), using glutaraldehyde as an additive. This 3D viral network can efficiently nucleate Au NPs (1.03 wt%, 20 nm thick layer), to enhance light harvesting via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), in combination with the TiO2 coating (10 nm of densely packed anatase crystallites). The resulting nano-composite (used as 15 μm film thickness) leads to a 40% PCE increase (total PCE = 8.46%), compared to the Au-free assembly, with an excellent electron collection efficiency (ηCOL > 99%).94
The semi-flexible nature of the M13 phage hampers the ultimate control on the nano-structure ordering. Nevertheless, the growth of magnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4 on M13 phage has been pursued to induce the horizontal and/or vertical alignment of the viral fibrils into single-and multi-orientation assemblies, by means of an external magnetic field.95
Covalent modification of viral platforms to engineer nano-conjugates for solar energy conversion
The potential to organize multiple chromophore nano-arrays, tuning distances and controlling geometry, is by far the unmatched advantage offered by viral scaffolds, through tailored bio-conjugation strategies.96 An overview of the synthetic protocols used to modify the native virus template is described in the following section, together with some representative examples of bio-inspired light-harvesting systems obtained by covalent decoration of the viral surfaces.
Chemical modification of virions by covalent strategies
To overcome the limited reaction scope of the exposed amino acidic residues (Tyr, Asp, Glu), functional groups on the TMV surface can be converted into more reactive ones, suitable for post-functionalization. Indeed, many reaction protocols, which do not disrupt the integrity and morphology of the native capsid, are available.97–101 Small molecules (biotin, porphyrins, crown ethers) or polymers (polyethylene glycol, PEG) turn out to be readily grafted on the exterior surface of the TMV, by targeting the surface Tyr 139 or exploiting the internal Glu 97 and 106 (Scheme 1).97
 Scheme 1  Reaction scheme for the interior modification of TMV via amide formation (1) and for the exterior modification of TMV: modification of Tyr 139 using diazonium salts to introduce a carbonyl group to be converted into an oxime (2), or an alkyne group, to access 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with organic azides (3). 
The modification of the inner surface can be obtained via EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) coupling between the Glu residues and different amines, in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Scheme 1, reaction 1).
The outer surface modification is accomplished through a diazonium coupling reaction: this allows, for example, the introduction of a carbonyl group, which can be subsequently converted into an oxime (Scheme 1, reaction 2).
Following this protocol, Francis and Holder have synthesized a pyrene-PEG–TMV (PEG = polyethylene glycol) conjugate enabling a favorable π–π bonding interaction with SWCNTs. The resulting composite can therefore provide a suitable material for integrating photoactive units and polymeric blends for photovoltaic applications.98
Wang and co-workers exploited the diazonium coupling to introduce alkyne moieties on the viral outer surface (Scheme 1, reaction 3). Then, the alkyne was reacted via “click chemistry” with different azido derivatives, including fluorescent labels and oligo-aniline motifs.99–101
A combination of genetic/chemical derivatization techniques seems to be a powerful strategy to achieve high yield and selectivity of modified viruses. In particular, cysteine-enriched mutant TMV or TMVCP monomers can be efficiently reacted with maleimido-derivatives. Thanks to this procedure, pyrene derivatives were incorporated into the inner cavity of the TMV rod, contributing to the elongation of the TMV rod structures (up to more than 2 μm), without affecting the intrinsic properties of TMV assembly. In this case, the interaction between the aromatic moieties was revealed by their broad excimer emission.102
The chemical modification of the M13 coat proteins can be easily achieved on the exposed N-terminus and Lys residues, which are located within 1 to 2.4 nm distance. The total number of the primary amines available for conjugation is approximately 5400 per virus particle.103 Aromatic amines were also conjugated with the Tyr groups of a Tyr-enriched surface of an engineered M13, via diazotization, with the aim of preparing photo-responsive azo-M13 phage nanowires.104
Virus-based light harvesting antenna systems
Thanks to the covalent modification of rod-like viral scaffolds, hundreds of spatially resolved chromophores can be anchored and aligned on positions that are dictated by the repetitive sub-units.6 This is very convenient for the design of a light harvesting antenna for photon collection.105,106
Endo et al. have designed a spatially controlled energy-transfer system, based on porphyrin–maleimido acceptor–donor derivatives (Zn-porphyrins, ZnP, as donors and freebase porphyrins, FbP, as acceptors) reacted with a recombinant TMVCP containing Cys at the 127 positions, i.e. close to RNA binding site (the intrinsic Cys27 of the TMVCP monomer was instead converted to alanine to maximize the site-selectivity). Porphyrin–TMV conjugates self-assemble into RNA-free disks (pH 7) and rod structures (pH 5.5), similar to native TMV assemblies, where neighboring porphyrins are arranged into helical arrays. Fluorescence spectra of the TMV assemblies containing 15–50% FbP show a decrease in ZnP emission and an increase in FbP emission. Energy transfer rates, measured by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, correlate with the variable distance between the porphyrins, resulting from the assembly at different pH, and with the FbP/ZnP ratio. At pH 7, in particular, the fast energy transfer rate (6.4 × 109 s−1) is enabled by the relatively flexible structure of the double-layered disks, where porphyrins can easily approach each other.107
The same TMVCP mutant has been modified by conjugation via thiol–maleimide coupling with acceptor and donor chromophores, namely: Oregon Green 488 (OG) as a primary donor and Alexa Fluor 594 (AF) as an acceptor. Under appropriate buffered conditions, TMVCPs self-assemble into micrometric rods (Fig. 9) containing a variable donors to acceptors ratio (up to 16:1), confined within the interior of the TMV scaffold.

Fluorimetric investigations have suggested the occurrence of donor-to-donor energy transfer pathways, up to the acceptor chromophores, with 30–50% transfer efficiency.108 Owing to the favorable orientation of the main transition dipoles of the chromophores, the cylindrical array favors the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between donors and acceptors.
Further modifications and genetic engineering are pivotal to tune the assembly geometry and chromophore distances with the final aim of mimicking the natural photosystem, where multiple donors ultimately feed a central acceptor. Indeed, the re-positioning of both C- and N-termini toward the interior of the capsid disks has led to an optimal spatial overlap of the conjugate dyes (a ring of the Texas Red donor with a central Alexa Fluor 647 acceptor), increasing the transfer efficiency up to 74%.109,110 On the other hand, the introduction of an intermediate donor (tetramethyl rhodamine, TAMRA) turned out to increase the transfer efficiency (up to 90%) of a TMVCP-based assembly containing OG, TAMRA, and AF594 chromophores.111
Interestingly, vertically aligned TMV1-cys, decorated with fluorescent markers (Texas Red, rhodamine, fluorescein maleimides), have been successfully grafted onto different solid substrates derivatized with complementary DNA fragments, via partial disassembly of the TMV capsid (Fig. 10).112–115 This approach allows to maintain the full integrity of the individual components and ensures their controlled spatial resolution, thus resulting very promising for the preparation of photoelectrodes.

The bacteriophage M13 has also been used to arrange light harvesting units.116 Indeed, Nam et al. have exploited EDC chemistry to link Zn(II) deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4-bis(ethylene glycol) (ZnDPEG, see Fig. 10) to the large number of resident amino groups. Despite the use of a single type of chromophore, FRET was demonstrated by multiple evidence.103
Viral scaffolds for artificial photosynthesis
Artificial photosynthesis is receiving increasing attention as a means of storing solar energy into chemical bonds. In particular, photocatalytic water splitting has a major appeal vis-à-vis the ultimate target of hydrogen generation using light and water, i.e. readily accessible and totally renewable sources. The efficiency of the photosynthetic light-to-fuel pathway is strongly dependent on the photosynthetic components and on their functional interplay in terms of donor–acceptor cascade, electron transfer rates and catalytic turnover. This level of complexity can be addressed within a multi-domain architecture, following bio-inspired guidelines, eventually mimicking the photosynthetic membrane organization. To this aim, biogenic viral capsids have been proposed as a nano-platform to host and promote photo-induced water splitting events under solar light irradiation.
Hydrogen evolution, upon photo-catalytic water reduction, has been observed by Nuraje et al., growing a wide-bandgap perovskite material on M13:AE3.117 The genetically engineered phage displays additional carboxylate groups as nucleating sites for the formation of photoactive strontium titanate (STO) NPs, (5 nm in diameter and with cubic crystalline structure), which can be obtained starting from the strontium titanium ethylene glycolate precursor, treated at pH 10 and T = 80 °C. Then, a photodeposition method is applied to co-deposit Pt NPs, as co-catalysts, on the surface of STO. Proton reduction is achieved under UV irradiation, with methanol as a hole scavenger. This photosynthetic bio-hybrid evolves H2 with a productivity of 370 μmol g−1 h−1, thus overarching the virus-free STO. The viral scaffold is therefore instrumental to dictate a higher surface to volume ratio and crystallinity of the hybrid nanowires, preventing excited charge recombinations. Interestingly, a dye-sensitized version was also implemented. Eosin Y was indeed used to sensitize STO/Pt NWs, in the presence of diethanol amine. Although a decreased H2 evolution efficiency was observed (about 25% of the initial value), visible light was noteworthily used instead of UV.
The major hurdle of photosynthetic water splitting relies on the oxidation semi-reaction and this mainly depends on the development of stable water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) capable of multi-hole accumulation in a narrow potential range through fast photo-induced electron transfers.118 Virion nano-platforms may play a key role in the controlled assembly and positioning of light-harvesting complexes, electron-transfer mediators, and catalytic units, in order to direct the photo-induced electron transfer cascade with minimal losses.
Engineered M13 viruses have been adopted by Belcher and coworkers for the co-assembly of porphyrin-based light harvesting antennas with totally inorganic, colloidal, water oxidation catalysts.119
In particular, a sensitizer nano-array results from the covalent grafting of the Zn(II) deuteroporphyrin IX 2,4 bis-ethylene glycol, (ZnDPEG), on the M13-capsid containing also a peptide binding domain to host iridium oxide (IrO2) as a hydrosol cluster (Fig. 11).

Bottom, left: TEM image of a photosynthetic M13 nano-ensemble (scale bar 200 nm). Bottom, right: oxygen evolution kinetics by IrO2–ZnDPEG hybrid nanowires (red curve) and related control experiments with: (i) virus-free IrO2 clusters mixed with unconjugated ZnDPEG (black curve); (ii) IrO2 clusters mixed with ZnDPEG-conjugated viral nanostructures (green curve); (iii) virus-templated IrO2 nanowires mixed with soluble ZnDPEG (blue curve). The concentrations of IrO2 and ZnDPEG were set at 32.7 mM and 0.8 mM, respectively. The numbers above the curves indicate TON values. Adapted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Y. S. Nam et al., Nat. Nanothecnol., 2010, 5, 340 (ref. 119), copyright 2010. 
In detail, ZnDPEG was grafted to the M13 major coat proteins via a carbodiimide reaction with the exposed amino groups (one terminal N and one Lys per coat protein). Such a conjugation results in the broadening of the Soret band, red shift of the Q-bands and fluorescence quenching, suggesting excitonic migration between the photosensitizer units. Then, colloidal IrO2 was grown on ZnDPEG-M13 upon hydrolysis of hexachloroiridate, followed by oxidation with H2O2. The resulting bio-conjugates show improved photocatalytic performances with respect to the virus-free or isolated systems (Fig. 11). In this modular ensemble, the sensitizer versus catalyst loading and film thickness can be optimized to enhance both the quantum yields and the oxygen evolution rate. With a 15:1 IrO2/ZnDPEG molar ratio, oxygen evolution performance is such to yield a turnover number (TON) of 1100, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.68 s−1 and a quantum yield of 0.86 (at pH 11, borate buffer), using sodium persulphate as a sacrificial electron acceptor. M13 was also encapsulated in an acrylic-based microgel phase before assembling IrO2 and the photosensitizer, so as to avoid aggregation and precipitation phenomena. The weak point is the irreversible degradation of the porphyrin moieties occurring under the water oxidation regime, which hampers the recyclability of the system. Nonetheless, the assembly of the photosynthetic modules on a biogenic nano-surface stems as a powerful approach towards the concept of a functional artificial device.
Conclusions and perspectives
Rod-like virus-based constructs offer a promising strategy for the design of bio-inspired energy materials. This is due to their unique multi-site/regular protein architecture which is readily amenable to tailored functionalization via both covalent and non-covalent chemistry. This opportunity is being explored to fabricate photo-active nano-ensembles featuring a precise molecular control of geometries, distances and orientation between functional components anchored on the rigid viral fibrils, while offering a mono-disperse 1D morphology and a dramatic increase of surface area. Simplicity of self-assembly and patterning processes (neutral pH, room temperature), together with the possibilities for chemical/genetic tuning and scalable preparation, represent additional key advantages of such biogenic scaffolds in the field of solar energy conversion and storage.
A very interesting perspective is the modification of virus-based nano-templates to mimic the natural photosynthetic membrane. In this endeavour, the integration of multi-redox molecular catalysts can result in a definite step forward.120 Indeed, the protein environment is expected to leverage the activity of the catalytic core by a tunable stereo-electronic control, while offering precise compartmentalization constraints to prevent leaching and deactivation pathways.
Among molecular WOCs, the emerging class of polyoxometalates (POMs) has been found to replicate the natural oxygen evolving mechanism, giving rise to a cyclic evolution along multiple oxidation states.121,122 Integration of oxygenic POMs with carbon nanotubes (Fig. 12) and nano-graphene has been instrumental to lower the water oxidation overpotential on anodic surfaces.123–125 On the other hand, oxygenic POMs have been immobilized into polymeric membranes and polymeric multilayered capsules, to yield functional materials on a micro-scale arrangement.126,127
 Fig. 12  Assembly scheme, and corresponding TEM images, of 1D catalytic nanostructures where the oxygenic polyoxometalate {Ru4(μ-OH)2(μ-O)4(H2O)4[γ-SiW10O36]}10− (ball and stick structure shown) is anchored by electrostatic interactions on (left side) MWCNT scaffolds decorated with trimethyl ammonium acetyl pyrene124 or on (right side) TMV ribbons coated with the tetracationic porphyrin HTMPyP (and PAH, not shown in the scheme).38 
Building on these results, we have very recently reported the assembly of the POM {Ru4(μ-OH)2(μ-O)4(H2O)4[γ-SiW10O36]}10− on TMV, previously coated with polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinium) porphyrin (HTMPyP). The supramolecular conjugate is formed by the electrostatic capture of the polyanionic catalyst on the cationized viral surface (Fig. 12). The stability of the fibril and ribbon-like morphology has been confirmed by TEM analysis after catalytic oxygen evolution,38 which is consistent with the expected mechanical and hydrolytic robustness of the nano-assembly,126,127 thus opening up a new perspective of engineered bio-hybrid anodes for electrocatalytic water oxidation.
In conclusion, the naturally available, abundant and bio-compatible virion particles are nanofiber-like materials which may offer a cost effective alternative to more widely used 1D nanostructures like carbon nanotubes and nano-fibrillated polymers or dendrimers.128,129 The versatile chemistry of the virion capsid and its inner structure may offer a wide range of synthetic strategies for the organization of molecular units and materials, to achieve complexity and nanofabrication with molecular control. In this perspective, the combined use of different techniques, ranging from covalent organic protocols to surface chemistry (i.e. gold-thiolate linkers, layer-by-layer coatings, complementary DNA hybridization) can open up the way to new materials and modular interfaces. This review is expected to inspire future work on the use of biogenic materials as the starting point to master artificial complexity and up-grade our comprehension of the Natural wonders.
