    , Accepted 11th March 2011First published on 18th April 2011AbstractWe found that the insertion of the poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) layer into the pristine device results in great improvement of the efficiency, from 2.0% to 3.3% at 1 sun illumination. The improvement was mainly attributed to the improved fill factor, which for the Sb2S3 sensitized solar cell was seriously degraded from 56.0% (at 0.1 sun) to 31.5% (at 1 sun), whereas the fill factor of the Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cell was only moderately degraded, from 59.3% (at 0.1 sun) to 40.4%. The role of P3HT as a hole buffer layer was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Broader context
Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells (Sb2S3-SSCs) have poor long-term stability with conventional electrolytes such as iodide/triiodide and polysulfide. Therefore, the use of alternative electrolytes is a prerequisite to ensure the long-term performance of Sb2S3-based solar cells. We fabricated stable Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells using Co-complex as electrolytes. However, the cobalt redox couples suffer from critical mass transport problems because they cannot effectively regenerate the oxidized sensitizer owing to their diffusion limit. To improve the efficiency of an Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell under full sun illumination, we introduce a p-type P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophene) layer between Sb2S3 and the Co-complex electrolyte. It is demonstrated that the P3HT layer serves as a passivation layer that can buffer the instant depletion of the cobalt(II) complex in the vicinity of the Sb2S3 sensitizer, thereby improving fill factor through the reduction of charge recombination between the photogenerated electrons and holes.

Recently, inorganic semiconductor- and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDs-SSCs) have been investigated as potential alternatives to conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (D-SSCs) owing to their advantageous properties such as high extinction coefficient, large dipole moment, easy spectral tunability, good stability, and multiple exciton generation.1 Among the metal chalcogenide sensitizers, the Sb2S3 sensitizer is an excellent choice owing to its high absorption coefficient (α = 105 cm−1) and energy bandgap (1.7–1.9 eV).2 These properties have been previously demonstrated in solid-state Sb2S3 based solar cells;3 however, Sb2S3 has not been applied to liquid-state solar cells thus far because it is immediately corroded by conventional liquid electrolytes such as iodides and polysulfides. The Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell only exhibits stable performance in a cobalt electrolyte even while current is flowing. However, in the case of highly efficient sensitized solar cells, bulkier cobalt redox couples suffer from critical mass transport problems because they cannot effectively regenerate the oxidized sensitizer owing to their diffusion limit. As a result, the performance of Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells is highly dependent on the intensity of solar illumination. In particular, the efficiency under 1 sun illumination is much worse than that under 0.1 sun illumination. Hence, improving the efficiency of an Sb2S3 sensitized solar cell under 1 sun illumination is a challenging task. In this communication, we describe a novel method for improving the efficiency of Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells under 1 sun illumination by introducing a poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) hole buffer layer.
The schematic illustration of the device structure and the energy band diagram are shown in Fig. 1. In Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells, electrons generated in the Sb2S3 are injected into the conduction band of mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2), and the generated holes are simultaneously reduced by diffusion into the cobalt(II) complex [(Co(o-phen)3](TFSI)2, where o-phen stands for 1,10-phenanthroline, and TFSI stands for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide. The oxidized cobalt(III) complex is then regenerated into a cobalt(II) complex at the Pt/FTO electrode, thereby ensuring stable operation. However, under 1 sun illumination, a single Sb2S3 sensitizing particle can generate more excessive charge carriers than a conventional dye occupying the same area on the mp-TiO2 surface because Sb2S3 has a higher absorption coefficient and is bulkier than a mono-layered dye. Therefore, in the vicinity of the Sb2S3 sensitizer, the cobalt(II) complex quickly oxidizes into a cobalt(III) complex, and then depletes until the cobalt(III) complex has diffused out, and fresh cobalt(II) complex diffuses in.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of device structure and (b) energy band diagram. 
Consequently, the hole transport rate generated in Sb2S3 under 1 sun illumination is hindered by this effect, and recombination inevitably occurs unless preventative treatments are taken. In order to avoid the instant depletion of the cobalt(II) complex in the vicinity of the Sb2S3 sensitizer, we intentionally added a p-type P3HT hole buffer layer. This layer can effectively extract holes from the Sb2S3 due to excellent band matching and hole mobility, which inhibits recombination between the Sb2S3 and the cobalt electrolyte.3b,4 Furthermore, the effective surface area of the P3HT hole buffer layer coated on the Sb2S3/mp-TiO2 film will be greater than the original surface area of the Sb2S3 sensitizer. This reduces the number of holes per unit surface area that are regenerated by the cobalt(II) redox couple, since these holes are quickly transported to the P3HT layer, as shown in Fig. 1(a). As a result, the instant mass transport problem of the cobalt redox couple is resolved in the vicinity of the Sb2S3 sensitizer, and the device efficiency is subsequently improved, particularly under 1 sun illumination.
The basic characteristics of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1.† The TEM image in Fig. S1(a,b)† indicates that the size of the deposited Sb2S3 nanoparticlesviachemical bath deposition (CBD) on the mp-TiO2 surface is less than 10 nm, and is widely dispersed (please refer to the experimental data for details of the preparation method). The distribution in size of the Sb2S3 nanoparticles enables a broad solar spectrum to be used for generating electricity. The XRD pattern shown in Fig. S1(c)† confirms that the phase of the Sb2S3 nanoparticles matches that of a crystalline stibnite. The UV-visible transmission spectra of Sb2S3 and P3HT are shown in Fig. 2(a). The transmission offset of the deposited Sb2S3 nanoparticles at a wavelength of approximately 750 nm implies a broad distribution in size as well as bulk-like properties. This indicates that a back scattering layer is required to reutilize the transmitted light for wavelengths over 500 nm which are not fully absorbed by the Sb2S3. Therefore, we added a back scattering layer (thickness, 1.7 μm; TiO2 particle size, ∼200 nm) to fully convert the whole spectrum of visible light into electricity (see Fig. S2†). The transmission spectrum of P3HT shows that the maximum absorption occurs at about 530 nm in wavelength, and that the absorption continues up to 650 nm in wavelength. At this point, it is unclear whether or not the absorption by the P3HT is advantageous to the device's performance. Therefore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of P3HT, Sb2S3, and Sb2S3/P3HT were also measured by excitation of light at 530 nm wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2(b). These measurements indicate that the excited charge carriers in P3HT are partially, but not completely, transported to the Sb2S3, and most of the light should be absorbed by the Sb2S3 in order to minimize the absorption loss. Note that a thicker P3HT layer will reduce the device efficiency due to absorption loss.

Based on the characteristics of these materials, we compared the performance of Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cells using cobalt complex as electrolyte. For the fabrication of Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cell, the Sb2S3 was deposited onto a mp-TiO2 film and then dipped into 0.15 wt% of chlorobenzene solution for 1 h. Here we used 10 fold diluted P3HT solution compared to the solution used in Fig. 2 experiment to reduce the absorption loss by P3HT. It was then dried by nitrogen blowing and baked in a 60 °C oven for 30 min. As expected, the efficiency of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell (Fig. 3(a)) was drastically reduced from 4.1% (at 0.1 sun) to 2.0% (at 1 sun) as the intensity of the illuminated light increased. This was due to the mass transport problem of the cobalt redox couple. In particular, the fill factor (FF) was seriously deteriorated by the light intensity due to significant recombination of generated charge carriers, which occurred because excess generated holes could not be effectively reduced by the cobalt(II) complex in the vicinity of the Sb2S3, due to slow diffusion.

This implies that the high degree of recombination could be overcome by either reducing the number of holes per unit area at the interface between Sb2S3 and the electrolyte, or by the passivation of back electron transfer from Sb2S3 and mp-TiO2 to the electrolyte. As a result, the device efficiency at 1 sun illumination was greatly improved, from 2.0% to 3.3%, through the insertion of a P3HT layer between the Sb2S3 and the cobalt electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Interestingly, the improvement in the device's efficiency was mainly attributed to the improved fill factor, which for the Sb2S3 sensitized solar cell was seriously degraded from 56.0% (at 0.1 sun) to 31.5% (at 1 sun), whereas the fill factor of the Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cell was only moderately degraded, from 59.3% (at 0.1 sun) to 40.4% (at 1 sun). This indicates that recombination under 1 sun illumination was greatly reduced by the insertion of a p-type P3HT layer, and that the P3HT itself could act as a hole buffer layer that relieves the instant depletion of cobalt(II) complex at the interface, through the redistribution of holes into the covered P3HT layer.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig. 3(d) confirms that the Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cell has slightly higher EQE values, which are correlated with a slight increase in Jsc. The EQE graph of the Sb2S3/P3HT sensitized solar cell also shows a slight depression between 450 nm and 650 nm in wavelength. The slight efficiency loss in this region could be attributed to the absorption loss of P3HT, as shown in the PL spectra of Fig. 2(b). To check the contribution of P3HT to the power conversion, the J–V curves and EQE spectrum of the P3HT-sensitized solar cell (mp-TiO2/P3HT/cobalt electrolyte system) were obtained (see Fig. S3†). These results indicate that the Sb2S3 mainly generates the charge carriers by the absorption of an external light, whereas the P3HT acts as passivation and hole-buffer layer.
To further confirm the role of P3HT as a hole buffer layer, we investigated the device performance of an Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell with N3 dye as surface passivation layer, as shown in Fig. S4.† The surface passivation of the N3 dye slightly improved the device's performance due to less recombination at either the mp-TiO2/electrolyte or the Sb2S3/electrolyte interface. Therefore the P3HT layer in the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell behaved as both a passivation layer and a hole buffer layer because the passivation layer itself could not achieve such a high efficiency.
In addition, we measured its impedance under 1 sun illumination and in open circuit conditions using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to further understand the role of P3HT, as shown in Fig. 4. The Nyquist plot of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell in Fig. 4(a) clearly shows the severe diffusion problem of the cobalt redox couple under 1 sun illumination, as indicated by the dominant portion of the third arc in the real impedance graph. In the Nyquist plot, a number of key features can be distinguished, such as charge transfer at the mp-TiO2 electrode, charge recombination at the TiO2/cobalt redox couple interface, charge transfer at the Sb2S3(/P3HT)/cobalt redox couple interface, diffusion of the cobalt redox couple, and charge transfer at the Pt electrode.1c,5 The first arc, in the high frequency region (105–106 Hz), can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance between the cobalt electrolyte and the Pt or Sb2S3(/P3HT) interface, as the charge transfer rate of the cobalt redox couple is on the order of μs.5,6 The second arc, in the intermediate frequency region (102–103 Hz), is associated with charge transfer to the mp-TiO2 electrode, backward charge transfer from the mp-TiO2 electrode to the cobalt electrolyte, and the overall chemical capacitance.5 The third arc, in the low frequency region (approximately 1 Hz), is related to the finite Warburg impedance of the cobalt complex.5 As expected, the total real impedance of the Sb2S3/P3HT-sensitized solar cell was less than the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell, and the magnitude of the third arc was also lower. This indicates that the mass transport problem of the cobalt redox couple has been improved by the insertion of a P3HT hole buffer layer. The Bode phase plot in Fig. 4(b) shows that the maxima for the low and intermediate frequency regions are constant, but the maximum for the high frequency region moves down by the addition of a P3HT layer. This is due to the reduced backward recombination at the (Sb2S3/P3HT)/cobalt electrolyte interface.

In summary, we have improved the efficiency of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell based on the cobalt redox couple, under 1 sun illumination, through the insertion of a P3HT hole buffer layer. The P3HT layer has been shown to effectively extract holes from the Sb2S3 sensitizer and to redistribute the holes across the extended surface. The P3HT layer has reduced the number of holes per unit surface area that are regenerated by the cobalt(II) complex, and has consequently relieved the mass transport problem of the cobalt redox couple. As such, the device efficiency of the Sb2S3 sensitized solar cell in the cobalt redox couple has been improved from 2.0% to 3.3% under 1 sun illumination.
Methods
Preparation of the cobalt electrolyte

          Cobalt electrolytes were prepared by dissolving the Co(II) complex [Co(o-phen)3](TFSI)2—where o-phen stands for 1,10-phenanthroline and TFSI stands for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide—at a concentration of 0.5 M, the Co(III) complex [Co(o-phen)3](TFSI)3 at a concentration of 0.05 M, and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) at a concentration of 0.2 M in acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate (4/6), as described in the literature.1d
Preparation of the mp-TiO2 film
The TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing 6 g of TiO2 nanopowder, with an average particle size of 50 nm, with 100 mL of ethanol, 30 g of a 10 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose in ethanol, and 30 g of terpineol homogenized by ultrasonic irradiation. The TiO2 nanopowder was prepared by drying in an oven at 100 °C after synthesizing through hydrothermal treatment of an aqueous peroxotitanium complex (PTC) solution in an autoclave at a temperature of 250 °C for 12 h (see Fig. S2(c)†). An approximately 100 nm thick dense TiO2 layer was deposited on an F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC15) glass substrate using the spray pyrolysis deposition method, in order to prevent recombination between the FTO substrate and the liquid electrolyte. In addition to the homogenized TiO2 paste, which was screen-printed on the dense TiO2 blocking layer, a light-scattering layer containing TiO2 nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm, was also screen-printed (see Fig. S2(d)†) and heat-treated at a temperature of 500 °C for 60 min in air. It is important to note that initially, the transparent FTO glass substrate had been ultrasonically cleaned by successive bathing in acetone and ethanol; then, it was dried under airflow before use. The thickness of the TiO2 electrodes deposited on the FTO glass substrate, including the light-scattering layer, was approximately 3–4 μm, and the active area of the TiO2 photoanode was approximately 0.18 cm2.
Deposition of the Sb2S3-sensitizer on the mp-TiO2 film
A mixture of 0.65 g of SbCl3 dissolved in 2.5 mL of acetone, 25 mL of a 1 M Na2S2O3 solution, and a sufficient amount of deionized water, was prepared in order to make 100 mL of the final solution. This solution was used to deposit the Sb2S3 sensitizer onto the nanoporous TiO2 electrodes by means of chemical bath deposition (CBD).2b More specifically, an amorphous Sb2S3 thin film of orange colour was deposited onto the np-TiO2 electrodes for 3 h, and then washed with deionized water to remove any sulfate or chloride residues. Samples of amorphous Sb2S3 were dried at room temperature for several hours and then heat-treated at a temperature of 330 °C in an argon (Ar) atmosphere for 30 min. Additional samples of the dark brown crystalline Sb2S3 formed during the heat-treatment were taken from the hot plate immediately after the annealing process was completed, and cooled in air.2
Fabrication of Sb2S3-sensitized SSCs
The Pt-coated counter electrodes were prepared by applying a 5 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in i-propanol to an FTO glass substrate, and then heating them to a temperature of 400 °C for 10 min. The solar cells were then assembled by sandwiching the Sb2S3 sensitizer deposited onto the mp-TiO2 film with Pt-coated counter electrodes, using a thermal adhesive film (Surlyn®, DuPont; thickness, 25 μm). The electrolyte was injected before the hole was sealed by a Surlyn® film, and a cover glass was applied by means of a vacuum back-filling system. In order to improve the electrical connection, lead contact pads were formed on both sides of the electrodes using an ultrasonic soldering iron.
Device characterization
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the cell were measured using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) and a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL) under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G illumination provided by a solar simulator (Class A, 91195A; Newport). The intensity of light incident on the solar cell was controlled using neutral density (ND) filters. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a fully computerized system comprising a light source (300 W Xenon lamp, 66902; Newport) aligned with a monochromator (Cornerstone™ 260; Newport) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). All measurements were carried out at least five times and the results were averaged. The EIS of the solar cells was measured using an impedance analyzer (Zahner IM6e).
