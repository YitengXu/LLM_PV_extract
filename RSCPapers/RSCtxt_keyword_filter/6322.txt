    , Accepted 11th November 2022First published on 11th November 2022AbstractScaling up high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) while avoiding losses in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is a challenging task. Deposition of high quality large-area hole transporting layers (HTLs) which are indispensable for efficient operation of PSCs, is often hard to achieve by scalable techniques. To address this, we demonstrate herein the fabrication of large-area (up to 30 cm2) organic-semiconductor-based HTL films using slot-die coating – an established and highly scalable printing technology that enables deposition of uniform thin films on various substrates. To achieve the highest performance, we developed a solvent engineering method to control the film formation process. Specifically, the combination of rapidly evaporating ethyl acetate and slowly evaporating chlorobenzene solvents allows for fine tuning the spreading and evaporation rate of the precursor solution over the substrate. Slot-die coating of solutions with optimal solvent composition, determined through detailed optimization studies, produces highly uniform and pinhole-free films, which proved effective hole extraction and suppress interfacial recombination. As a result, an average efficiency of 17.7 ± 1.5% is demonstrated for perovskite solar modules of 5 cm × 5 cm in size using a 10.0 cm2 aperture area under AM 1.5G irradiation. Moreover, the modules retain 85% of their initial performance after being aged under dark ambient conditions for 1000 h.
Introduction
Over the past decade, photovoltaic power generation technologies have attracted massive research interests around the world. Among them, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the front runners because of the superior photoelectronic characteristics of hybrid perovskite absorbers, such as high light absorption coefficients,1 long charge diffusion lengths,2,3 and adjustable bandgaps.4,5 Building upon the knowledge generated through the immense body of research on materials synthesis, interface engineering and morphological modulation methods, a PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% has been recently reported.6
However, the overwhelming majority of studies including the most recent breakthrough reports use lab-scale devices with a size of not more than 1 cm2, most commonly of the 0.1 cm2 scale, fabricated by spin-coating. Practical scale-up of such methods is not considered feasible, while technologies for the large-scale fabrication of PSCs are clearly required for their long-expected commercialization either as individual photovoltaic devices or components of tandems. Among the scalable technologies developed in the field of thin-film solar cells, slot-die coating is one of the simplest and flexible methods that can be easily implemented in a roll-to-roll mode.7–10,52 Slot-die coating has great advantages over spin-coating in terms of controlling and stripe pattern processing and has been widely used in fabrication of large-scale thin film electronics.11–13,53
For a typical slot-die coating process, the solution is pumped into a coating head using a suitable pump, filling the gap between the head and the substrate and forming the “liquid bridge”. In order to obtain uniform thin films, this bridge between the coating head and the substrate must be continuous while the coating head moves across the substrate.14,15 For a given coating width, the dry film thickness is controlled by the amount of supplied ink and the coating speed.16 In 2015, the slot-die coating for the fabrication of PSCs was reported for the first time.9 By adjusting the processing-temperature system to control the nucleation dynamics of the MAPbI3 (MA+ = methylammonium) perovskite film, it was successfully deposited by sequential slot-die coating of PbI2 and then MAI. Recently, Xu et al. explored varying annealing conditions of wide bandgap triple-halide perovskite and optimized the processes of slot-die coating by developing a suitable solvent system and using a stream of nitrogen (N2). With a series of optimizations, they obtained a 2-terminal monolithic tandem solar cell with a champion PCE of 25.2% (active area 1 cm2), which shows the high potential for slot-die coating as a fabrication route for industrially relevant perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.17
Most of the PSC efficiency records were supported by the use of organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs), such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and polytriarylamine (PTAA). However, only a few studies demonstrated the compatibility of these materials with the large-scale solution fabrication process.9,18,19 Di and co-workers demonstrated slot-die coating of both perovskite and hole transporting layers (HTLs) and fabricated a large-area module with the dimensions of 12.5 cm × 13.5 cm that operated with a PCE of more than 10%.18 A fully slot-die printed PSC has been reported by Hwang et al. They demonstrated photovoltaic performance (0.1 cm2 active area and PCE = 11.6%) that was very close to that of spin-coated devices by optimizing the thickness of the P3HT layer.9 This work provides an important demonstration of the possibility of printing all layers of PSCs in a roll-to-roll compatible process. Nevertheless, the quality of HTLs coated using a slot-die, including homogeneity and pin-holes, needs to be improved with increasing the printing area. Deeper understanding and optimization of the film formation mechanism are required to advance the HTL printing technology.
The film formation process is mainly determined by the physical properties of the ink solution, including precursor concentrations, viscosity, density, boiling point and surface tension.20 The time taken to form a homogeneous and compact film when the ink dries naturally during slot-die coating is notably longer than that in the spin-coating process.19 Therefore, direct application of the commonly used HTL solutions in slot-die printing does not produce high quality HTL films. To address this, the solution should be optimized to have a suitable viscosity and a good wettability on the substrate. In general, inks with lower viscosity and small contact angles often enable improved solution wettability, and are therefore preferable for printing uniform and pinhole-free films.20,21 In addition, a higher precursor concentration (i.e. higher surface tension) leads to faster film drying.20 Imperfections such as “coffee rings” can strongly depend on the surface tension when films are close to the gas–liquid–solid three-phase line.22 Apart from the physical properties of the solution itself, the solution temperature achieved by adjusting the temperatures of the coating head and the substrate also affects the evaporation rate of the solvent, the film drying process and thereby the quality of the resulting films.23–26
A number of organic solvents have been used to deposit HTL films, though mainly using the spin-coating deposition method.27–30 Luis and colleagues found that the use of chloroform enabled a more smooth, homogeneous and pinhole-free HTL films than the one based on chlorobenzene (CB) solvent due to a lower boiling point and fast evaporation rate of chloroform.27 Imperfections in the HTLs prepared with CB can be explained by its high boiling point, which decelerates the evaporation rate during the film drying process and generates microbubbles within the film. Bu et al. obtained a small-area device (0.16 cm2) with a PCE of 19.4% by substituting CB with ethyl acetate (EA), which is considered to be an environmentally friendly solvent.28,31 Tran et al. reported that the use of tetrahydrofuran (THF) instead of CB or toluene leads to a high degree of crystallinity and improved conductivity of the P3HT film due to a strong degree of P3HT agglomeration in polar solvents.32 Hu et al. replaced CB and the oxidation additives, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) with pentachloroethane (PC) – a solvent capable of releasing free chlorine radicals, which enabled cleaner and more stable spiro-OMeTAD films.29 With the use of PC, a stabilized PCE of 16.1% was achieved for centimeter-scale PSCs. It was also reported that adding a small amount of acetonitrile (ACN) to the spiro-OMeTAD solution facilitates partial dissolution of the surface perovskite layer, which results in the formation of an inter-diffusion structure between the active and HTM layers and enhanced hole collection.30 However, most of these studies are based on spin-coating methods for small-area solar cells. Application of these and other strategies to solar modules is rare due to the lack of a deep understanding of HTL morphology control in a scalable coating process.9,18,19
In the present work, we report a facile strategy for large-area HTL deposition by slot-die coating, aiming to achieve highly efficient perovskite solar cell modules (PSMs). By adjusting the evaporation rate of the HTL inks, we successfully modulate the film formation process, which enables a smooth and uniform HTL. Through systematic analysis with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we found that the wet-film drying process has a strong impact on the surface roughness of the slot-die deposited film, thus affecting the photovoltaic performance of the device. Therefore, interrelations between the solvent evaporation, film morphology and device performance were established.
Results and discussion
Mixing different solvents can imbue the precursor solutions with desirable physicochemical properties, including the evaporation time,33 all of which strongly affect the quality of the slot-die coated films. Guided by this understanding, we used mixed systems based on two solvents – slowly evaporating chlorobenzene (CB, bp 132 °C, saturated vapor pressure 1.17 kPa at 20 °C) and rapidly evaporating ethyl acetate (EA, bp 78 °C, saturated vapor pressure 10.1 kPa at 20 °C), to modulate the drying process of the wet film. By fine adjusting the CB:EA volumetric ratios (10:0, 8:2, 6:4, 4:6, 2:8 and 0:10) and thereby the evaporation rate, we expected to achieve optimal film-forming conditions during the slot-die coating process.
According to previous studies, the morphology of the film is mainly related to the solvent evaporation rate, so we divided the film evolution process into three stages (Fig. 1a).26,33 The first stage corresponds to the primitive precursor solution, which remains in a wet film state until the solvent begins to evaporate. Then, in the second stage, the solute spiro-OMeTAD with LiTFSI and/or tBP precipitates on the film surface as the solvent evaporates.34,35 Therefore, the evaporation rate of solvent affects the distribution uniformity of solutes.27,35–37 If the evaporation rate is too fast, additives will aggregate in the HTL film before they can disperse;36 contrarily, if the evaporation rate is too slow, the solidification of spiro-OMeTAD will slow down and many microbubbles will inevitably be generated in the film,27 both of which lead to a rough morphology (Fig. 1c). After the wet film completely dries, the film reaches a stable status in the third stage as the final HTL.26 The evaporation rate of the solvent follows a linear trend with the CB:EA volumetric ratio (Fig. 1b and S1†). By analyzing the film characterization and the device performance behind this, we found that an evaporation rate of 4.47 mg min−1 (CB:EA = 6:4) gives the best film quality by slot-die coating.

First, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra of the 5 cm × 5 cm FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 (FA+ = formamidinium) perovskite layer supported on FTO|SnO2 (FTO – F-doped tin(IV) oxide) and slot-die coated HTLs based on different solvent combinations show negligible differences (Fig. S2†). These results demonstrate that the examined solvents induce no negative effects on the perovskite active layer. Then, we verified the uniformity of the slot-die coated HTLs using different solvent compositions by visible light microscopy (Fig. S3†). However, analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed clear effects of the CB:EA ratio on the HTL morphology (Fig. 2a–h). Specifically, the films coated with the CB:EA = 6:4 (vol.) mixture solvent (HTL-target) are more uniform and exhibit lower root-mean-square roughness (RMS = 4.8 nm) than those produced with pure CB (HTL-CB; RMS = 6.3 nm) or EA (HTL-EA; RMS = 6.9 nm). The cross-section SEM images (Fig. 2i) further confirmed the uniformity of the coated HTLs. Besides, pinholes are observed in the HTL-CB and HTL-EA films, which increase the probability of charge recombination and decrease the overall device performance, especially when using evaporated metal electrodes.38

(a–d) Top-view SEM and (e–h) AFM images; (i) cross-section SEM images; (j) UPS data; and (k) energy band schematic diagram. All HTL samples with a size of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were derived from the 5 cm × 5 cm HTL films slot-die coated onto FTO|SnO2|FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 substrates. 
Further differences in the properties of HTLs produced using different solvents were detected by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Specifically, the Fermi energy levels measured for the HTL-CB, HTL-target, HTL-EA films were −3.02, −3.79 and −3.36 eV (hereinafter vs. vacuum), respectively (Fig. 2j and S4†). The valence band (EVB) levels for the same materials were determined to be −5.03, −5.24 and −5.13 eV, respectively.39,40 Thus, the EVB of the HTL-target is downshifted closer to that of the perovskite41 compared with the layers obtained using pure solvents (Fig. 2k), which is expected to reduce the interface barrier and promote charge extraction.39
Solvents used for the HTL deposition can impact the characteristics of the perovskite|HTL interface, which define the efficiency of charge extraction and the degree of recombination and therefore strongly affect the photovoltaic performance and stability.42,43 To probe these effects, we applied the steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL (TRPL), and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements to investigate the charge transfer kinetics between the 5 cm × 5 cm FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 perovskite layer and HTLs coated with pure and CB:EA = 6:4 (vol.) mixture solvents (Fig. 3a). Unmodified perovskite and perovskite|HTL samples all show an emission maximum at around 788 nm, but the emission intensity is significantly quenched after coating HTLs, as expected (Fig. 3b). Importantly, the HTL-target is most effective in quenching, i.e., more efficient charge transfer occurs at the interface of the perovskite and HTL. The TRPL spectra were fitted using a bi-exponential function, where the fast process is attributed to the quenching of charge carriers at the interface, and the slow decay process is attributed mainly to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk (Fig. 3c and Table S1†).44,45 The calculated average decay time (τavg) of the perovskite layer is 2.03 μs, which was decreased to 44.6 ns for the HTL-target sample. At the same time, notably higher τavg values of 68.8 and 76.6 ns were recorded for HTL-CB and HTL-EA, respectively, further confirming the faster charge transfer provided by the films coated with the CB:EA = 6:4 (vol.) mixture solvent. The FLIM images demonstrated that the charge transfer dynamics is more uniform in the samples with the HTL-target in comparison with the other two (Fig. 3d–f), which is consistent with the results demonstrated in Fig. 1.

(a) Schematic diagram of the PL characterization; (b) steady-state PL; (c) TRPL spectra; and (d–f) FLIM images. All HTL samples with a size of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were derived from the 5 cm × 5 cm HTL films slot-die coated onto FTO|FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 substrates. 
To investigate the effect of solvent in slot-die coating on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we fabricated devices with a structure of FTO|SnO2|perovskite|HTL|Au (cross section SEM images are shown in Fig. 1i) based on different HTLs. Large-area HTL films (5 cm × 5 cm) were slot-die coated on FTO|SnO2|perovskite substrates and then divided into 4 pieces with the dimensions of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm to investigate the homogeneity of the photovoltaic performance. With the slot-die coating technique, the average PCE was found to follow a bell-shaped dependence on the CB:EA volumetric ratios in the HTM precursor solution, with the best performance achieved at 6:4 (Fig. 4a and Table S2†). The variation in the efficiency was associated with changes in the open-circuit potential (VOC; Fig. S5†), which is in turn defined by the HTL film morphology and interface recombination processes. Based on the optimal solvent component, we achieved a champion PCE of 21.5%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.7 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.82 (Fig. 4b). The HTL-target device shows a quasi-steady-state power output (qSPO) of 20.1% at the maximum power point, while they are 18.8% and 15.2% for the HTL-CB and HTL-EA devices, respectively (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the qSPO of the HTL-target device is robust during the 120 s tracking, while the devices based on HTL-CB and HTL-EA show slightly decreased power outputs. The integrated JSC values calculated from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are 23.0, 23.5 and 22.8 mA cm−2 for HTL-CB, HTL-target, HTL-EA devices, respectively (Fig. 4d). As can be seen from the EQE spectra, these three devices have similar spectra except for the slightly higher EQE of the HTL-target device in the range of 350–400 nm. It is possible that the HTL-target device achieves better interfacial carrier transport, especially at the perovskite|HTL interface, where short wavelength photons can still be retained and absorbed to generate excitons. Importantly, the devices based on the HTL-target show excellent reproducibility in photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 19.2 ± 1.1% (Table 1).

To study recombination within solar cells, we measured dark J–V curves for the HTL-CB, HTL-target and HTL-EA devices (Fig. 5a). The series resistance (RS) and ideality factor (m) of the cell can be calculated with the aid of eqn (1) and (2). (1) (2)where J0, q, kB, and T are the reverse saturation current, elementary charge, Boltzmann constant and cell temperature, respectively.46 The inset in Fig. 5a shows a linear fitting relationship between dV/dJ and J−1. The device based on the HTL-target exhibits a slightly lower m value of 1.43 than the devices based on HTL-CB (1.47) and HTL-EA (1.53), indicating less trap-assisted recombination in the former.47

The distribution of (d) PCE, (e) VOC, and (f) FF for 12 cells derived from a 5 cm × 6 cm substrate; arrows show the direction of coating. All solar cells have an architecture of FTO|SnO2|FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15|HTL|Au. All photovoltaic parameters are recorded under AM 1.5G illumination with a 0.16 cm2 metal mask. 
To obtain deeper insights into the carrier recombination behaviors of devices with different HTLs, the dependencies of JSC and VOC characteristics on the light intensity (I) were investigated. The JSC depends on I according to the power JSC ∝ Iα law, as reported previously (Fig. 5b).48,49 When α is equal to 1, the device is not affected by the space charge effect, and almost all charge can be collected prior to carrier recombination. The α value of the device based on the HTL-target (ca. 0.95) is closer to 1 and therefore is less affected by bimolecular recombination as compared to devices with HTL-CB (ca. 0.88) and HTL-EA (ca. 0.87).50 This conclusion is further confirmed by the dependence of VOC on I (Fig. 5c). Indeed, the slope of VOC ∝ ln I dependencies measured for the devices with the HTL-target was 1.2 kBT/q, which is smaller than 1.5 kBT/q for HTL-CB and HTL-EA. The smaller slope indicates that the trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall recombination process is affecting the performance of the HTL-target device to a lower extent.49,51
To further investigate the compatibility of the presented strategy for scale-up, we examined the uniformity and quality of the larger (5 cm × 6 cm) slot-die coated HTL film by dividing it into 12 pieces with a size of 1.25 cm × 2 cm. The average PCE for these smaller samples was 19.6 ± 1.2% with an average VOC of 1.08 ± 0.02 V, FF of 0.78 ± 0.04 (Fig. 5d–f and S6†). This high homogeneity of the PSC characteristics within the 30 cm2 device emphasizes the scalability of the slot-die coating HTL method with optimized solvents.
By virtue of the success in small-area, we further apply these slot-die coated HTLs to the fabrication of series-interconnected modules with 6 sub-cells on a substrate size of 5 cm × 5 cm (Fig. 6a). The modules based on the HTL-target show the highest PCE of 20.4%, with a VOC of 6.87 V, an ISC of 39.7 mA, and a FF of 0.75, which is much better than the module based on HTL-CB, with a champion PCE of 18.0%, a VOC of 6.26 V, an ISC of 39.7 mA, and a FF of 0.75 (Fig. 6b). The qSPO is in good agreement with the I–V values, showing a stabilized PCE of 18.3% for the module based on the HTL-target (Fig. 6c). The modules also display superior reproducibility in comparison with the HTL-target based modules (Fig. 6d and Table 2). The average PCE of HTL-target modules based on 18 independent devices is 17.7 ± 1.5%, while it is 15.4 ± 1.4% for the HTL-CB modules.

We test the device stability to evaluate the practical application of the strategy herein (Fig. 6e and S7†). After 1000 h of aging under ambient conditions (30 ± 5% RH, 27 ± 3 °C in the dark), modules based on the HTL-target and HTL-CB retained 85% and 72% of their original PCEs, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the XRD of the FA0.95MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15 films with different HTLs that were aged under ambient conditions (Fig. S8†). After 1000 h, the perovskite covered by the HTL-target film shows no degradation, while the one with the HTL-CB film shows the formation of PbI2. These findings suggest that the optimal solvent is promising for achieving large PSMs with improved stability.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a solvent engineering strategy to fabricate large-area organic HTL films by slot-die coating. We found that the solvent evaporation rate of the ink is a key parameter that determines the morphology of the HTL film. By optimizing the ratio of the rapidly and slowly evaporating solvent components, viz. ethyl acetate and chlorobenzene, we obtained large-area HTL films with highly uniform morphology. These layers sustain homogeneous and effective charge extraction from the underlying perovskite film and suppress recombination at the interface between active and hole-transporting layers. By adopting the HTL slot-die coating strategy with optimized solvent composition, average PCE of 19.2 ± 1.1% for small-area (0.16 cm2) devices and 17.7 ± 1.5% for large-area (10.0 cm2) modules are demonstrated with the slot-die coated HTL. These results suggest that the optimized slot-die process has great potential to further support the development of PSC technology toward commercialization.
