    , Accepted 24th July 2022First published on 2nd August 2022AbstractLead halide perovskites (LHPs) have demonstrated their expertise in the field of optoelectronics. However, the commercialization of these materials is not easy because they have poor stability in humidity, light, and heat. This review provides a brief discussion regarding the decomposition of perovskite NCs through intrinsic and extrinsic environmental factors, including explaining their degradation mechanism. Various strategies have been adopted, focusing on improving the stability of perovskites. It also calls attention to the literature about stability-enhancing approaches. In this recent field, researchers have tried to a great extent to overcome the obstacle of environmental instability and materialistic applications of perovskite by engaging the perovskite NCs inside the matrix of porous-MOFs. The purpose of this review is to provide an up-to-date literature survey about the blooming new properties and stability improvement in perovskites by loading the porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), including the different synthesis approaches that have been developed. Moreover, the chemistry of different MOFs' capability to control the shape, size, and optical properties of resulting perovskite NCs has also been discussed in this perspective. Finally, we concluded the encapsulation strategy of perovskite NCs inside the MOFs had given revolutionary results to improve the stability of perovskite NCs and their new potential application.

1. Introduction
In the past few years, all lead halide perovskite nanomaterials have attracted great attention for the potential applications of photovoltaics and optoelectronics.1 The general formula of LHPs is represented in the APbX3 crystal structure shown in Fig. 1, where A is a monovalent inorganic or organic cation (e.g., Cs+ and alkyl ammonium) and X is a halide anion (Cl−, Br− and I−).2
 Fig. 1  Schematic depiction of cubic phase lead halide perovskite. 
Their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), narrow emission bands, and tunability of band gaps by size, shape, dimensionality, and composition make them ideal aspirants for optoelectronic devices, e.g., solar cells, LEDs, lasers, specific photodetectors, and visible-light communication.3–11 Nonetheless, the main weakness of lead halide perovskite is the poor chemical stability under ambient conditions. These are very sensitive in the presence of moisture, air, light, and temperature due to their low formation energy.12–16 Besides, the highly ionic internal bonding results in the ease of ion-exchange reactions and decomposition. These drawbacks limit their commercial applications, which are urgently needed to be solved. For the last few years, various approaches have been adopted and utilized to increase the stability of lead halide perovskite NCs. For instance, the synthesis of PNCs with low dimensionality of the inorganic part, surface treatment with hydrophobic molecules, and capping the perovskites with polymers or inorganic oxides have been effectively used to improve the environmental stability of PNCs.17–21
Loading of NCs inside the cavities of porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been of topical interest to improve the durability and potential applications of NCs. This is because the MOFs have the merit of tunable porosity, high specific surface area, and environmental stability.22–25 Zlotea et al. have encapsulated the Pd nanoparticles inside MIL-100(Al) pores for hydrogen sorption purposes.26 Xu and co-workers have stabilized the Pt nanoparticles for catalytic activity in all the phases’ liquid-solid and gas, incorporating the Pt nanoparticles within the MIL-101 MOF.27 Recently, porous-MOFs have proved to be a panacea for stability enhancement and application advancement of perovskite NCs. The porous MOFs act as a host for perovskite guests, protecting the NCs phase without any aggregation from external stimulations.28,29 The resulting stable nanocomposites of perovskite@MOFs have been applied for solar cells, W-LEDs, photocatalysis, information security, fluorescence tunability, and sensor as a fluorescent probe.
In all the studies of LHPs, environmental instability is a common issue, which remains an obstacle for their commercial applications. In this review, we summarized the causes of the instability with the degradation mechanism of lead halide perovskite NCs, such as structural instability, environmental instability (produced by oxygen and moisture), and thermal instability. We also summarized the discussion about the efforts to enhance the stability of lead halides perovskite NCs such as cation and anion engineering (A-site cation, B-site cation, and X-site anion engineering), surface engineering, and encapsulation engineering (encapsulation in oxide matrix, polymer matrix, and metal–organic framework). For now, the main motive of this review is to provide up-to-date studies of lead halide perovskites/metal–organic frameworks (LHPs/MOFs) composites formation for the purpose of stability enhancement and improving applications of LHPs.
2. Instability connection of LHPs
2.1 Structural instability
The crystal structure of LHPs is resolved by calculating the tolerance factor and the octahedral factors.30,31 (1) (2)where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radii of the A, B, and X, respectively. The values of these factors are the structure deciding parameters that are helpful to predict the stable or unstable crystal structure evolution of LHPs.32 If the 3D structure of perovskite upholds the range of 0.9 ≤ tf ≤ 1 and 0.442 ≤ oc ≤ 0.895 leads to the formation of an ideal cubic structure.31–33 When the tolerance factor ranges between 0.71–0.9, presume the construction of orthorhombic or rhombohedral form. If these are t ≥ 1 and t ≤ 0.71 lead to the formation of 1D hexagonal and 1D orthorhombic structure (non-perovskite structure), respectively.34,35 Mostly, the lead halide perovskites have a cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal structure. The cubic form is more stable because it is more symmetric and has low formation energy. Therefore, the cubic form is thermodynamically more durable than the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal structure.36 For example, MAPbCl3 and MAPbBr3 have cubic structures, but MAPbI3 has a tetragonal structure at RT due to larger ionic radii of I− than Cl− and Br−.37,38 Evidently, the tetragonal structure of MAPbI3 shows measurable degradation than cubic MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 in perovskite solar cell at RT.39 The stability concept in bulk and nanoscale perovskite is a little bit controversial.40 On one side, the high surface area of the nanoscale promotes the degradation of perovskites. On another side, the nanoscale has more considerable surface energy cooperates to preserve the cubic phase.41
2.2 Environmental instability

2.2.1 Instability produced by oxygen. 
Among the lead halide perovskites, organic cation-based perovskites lose their structural identity quickly at ambient conditions than inorganic cation-based perovskites.42 In CH3NH3PbX3, the photogenerated electron interacts with oxygen and generates superoxide (O2−), which promotes the deprotonation of organic cation form methylamine gas, as shown in Fig. 2.43a The degradation mechanism of CsPbX3 in the presence of oxygen is still unclear. Li and co-workers44a have observed some extent of PbO on photo-oxidation of CsPbBr3 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.
 Fig. 2  Stepwise illustration of the oxygen-induced degradation mechanism of perovskites. 
Aristidou et al.43b have exposed light and oxygen on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. They showed the practical evidence of device instability in a time span of 72 h by the color change from dark brown to yellow and it was turned light pink in toluene solution which suggests the formation of iodine. In another report, Bryant et al.44b have demonstrated the degradation of MeNH3PbI3 solar cells in the presence of light and oxygen. They observed blue shift from 780 nm to 520 nm in absorption spectra after 48 h with a color change from dark brown to yellow which indicates the film degradation with the formation of PbI2.


2.2.2 Instability produced by moisture. 
LHPs become decompose in a short time on exposure to a moist environment due to their ionic nature. The oxygen-induced degradation of LHPs would occur in the presence of light, but water-induced degradation happens even in the absence of light.45 Water molecules penetrate the ionic lattice structure of MAPbI3 perovskites, which forms a dihydrated phase through hydrogen bonding with the organic part of perovskites. Water abstracts the proton from methylammonium cation (MA),
Whereby the bond between organic part and lead halide octahedra breaks, as a result of this the CH3NH2, PbI2 and HI are produced as shown in Fig. 3.46a
 Fig. 3  Representation of moisture-induced decomposition mechanism of perovskites. 
Zhou et al.46b have investigated that CH3NH3PbI3−xClx retain 80% performance of solar cell device after 24 h and 20% after 6 days under dry condition while in ambient condition it become less than 20% after 24 h and 5% after 6 days. Further, Cheng and their co-workers46c have discovered that in the presence of small amount of water at 85 °C, CH3NH3PbI3 decompose significantly.

2.3 Thermal instability
Lead halide perovskites are decomposed in their precursors at high temperatures. TGA studies provide the two-step degradation of CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3. In the first step, mass loss of HX and CH3NH2 at 220 °C for CH3NH3PbBr3 and at 250 °C for CH3NH3PbI3.47,48 In the second step, mass loss at >500 °C represents the liberation of lead halide. All inorganic LHPs CsPbX3 are degraded >500 °C.47 But the presence of oxygen and moisture with heat enhances the thermal degradation rate of LHPs.49
3. Strategies to improve stability of LHPs
3.1 A-Site cation engineering
In LHPs, MA+ cations-based perovskites are decomposed more rapidly in the ambient environment than Cs+ and FA+ cations-based perovskites. The larger size cation such as FA+ can improve the stability of perovskites than smaller size cation MA+ because FA+ has a little bit more lattice constant (5.99 Å) than MA (5.92 Å).50,51 Zhu and co-workers have improved the stability of FAPbI3 by the partial replacement of FA+ with Cs+.52 The PLQYs over 70% with high stability was observed in mixed cations FA+ and Cs+ based FA0.1Cs0.9 PbI3 PQDs than CsPbI3.53 The improvement in PLQYs from 65% to 85% stability was investigated by doping of K+ in CsPbBr3 PQDs.54
3.2 B-Site cation engineering
B-Site cation has high formation energy than that of A and X-site in ABX3 perovskites, which inhibits the substitution of B-site cation from ABX3 lattice. Despite this, to overcome the toxicity effect of lead in APbX3 perovskites, bivalent cations like Mn2+/Sn2+ were used to partial substitution of Pb2+. These cations have a smaller ionic radius with Pb2+, due to which the formation energy is increased; as a result, the thermal stability of CsPbX3 is improved.55–57 The small-sized cations can decrease the B–X bond length by partial substitution of Pb2+, which leads to controlling the distortion of octahedra and enhancing their thermal stability.56–59 Moreover, the stability of halide perovskite has been improved by the complete replacement of Pb2+ with Cu2+, developing Cs2CuX4 type halide perovskites.60 Other than this, the one monovalent and one trivalent or one quadrivalent ion are equivalent to two divalent cations (M+ + M3+ = 2M2+ or M4+) have incorporated by replacing Pb2+ which results to develop a class of double perovskite in the form of A2B′B′′X6 (e.g., Cs2AgBiX6 and Cs2AgInX6).61–63 Zhou et al.61 have synthesized Cs2AgBiX6 NCs and reported their stability over three weeks in 55% relative humidity.
3.3 X-Site anion engineering
The tuning of emission band-gap in LHPs NCs is well known on halide composition exchange from Cl− to I− including Br−. For example, the band-gap in MAPbX3 has been tuned from 3.11, 2.22, to 1.51 eV by changing Cl−, Br−, to I−, respectively.64 The halide exchange strategy is very simple and brisk. It can proceed through precursor or adding directly by post-synthesis.65 Xu et al.66 have investigated the partial exchange of I− with Br− in MAPbI3, which improves their stability due to the smaller size of Br− than I−. The concentration of Br− leads to the transformation of MAPbI3 tetragonal phase to MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 cubic phase.67 The small size Cl− doping enhances the stability of MAPbBr3−xClx for one month in the ambient environment.68 Apart from the halide interchange, researchers have made many efforts to substitute the halides with other similar-sized anions.69 Chen et al. have incorporated the BF4− in MAPbI3 by partial substitution of I− due to similar ionic radius of BF4− and I−. They achieved the improvement in electrical and optical properties with 13.24% PCE in MAPbI(3−x)(BF4)x.70
3.4 Surface engineering
Perovskite NCs have a high surface area, which is directly related to their physical and chemical properties. The suitable organic surfactants have been used to control the size, shape, surface area, surface defects, band-gap trap states, stability, and luminescent properties of perovskite NCs. Usually, in the organic surfactants, the carboxylic and amino groups have more affinity to cap the NCs. The imperfect passivation has become the cause of surface defects and moisture instability in LHP nanocrystals, which leads to its fluorescence quenching.71 Hence, it is essential to select the convenient capping ligands that can improve the stability and PL of NCs. For the synthesis of nano range LHPs, oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) are very prominent capping ligands to control the size and shape.72,73 Some factors like the chain length, steric hindrance, and the number of binding sites of capping ligands affect the optical properties and stability of PNCs.74,75 Branched capping ligands have also played an essential role in increasing the strength of perovskite NCs.76–78 To achieve water and heat-resistant CsPbBr3 QDs, 1-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) has been used as a ligand to coat the surface of QDs.79 Prieto and co-workers80 have observed the impressive PLQY and high stability in MAPbBr3 NCs by using 2-adamantylammonium bromide (ADBr) as a capping ligand.
3.5 Encapsulation engineering
It is necessary to maintain the optical properties for long-term applications of perovskite NCs. An appropriate matrix is required for the encapsulation of PNCs to protect their environmental degradation. The matrix should be durable and chemically inert under ambient environmental conditions. In this part, we will discuss the encapsulation of perovskite NCs inside the oxide matrix, polymer matrix and detail review the encapsulation of perovskite NCs within the metal–organic framework.

3.5.1 Encapsulation in the oxide matrix. 
Water stable oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 have enhanced the environmental stability of lead halide PNCs by encapsulation. Wang et al.81 have used mesoporous SiO2 for the encapsulation to improve the stability of inorganic PNCs. In this sequence, Li and co-workers82 have improved the stability of inorganic lead halide perovskite QDs by encapsulating perovskite into SiO2. Yamauchi and their co-workers83 have reported emission tunability and moisture stability of MAPbBr3 perovskites QDs by the coating of SiO2. Our group84 has reported emission tunability and improved stability of organolead bromide perovskite QDs by SiO2. The transparent oxide Al2O3 can change the optical properties and improve the stability of PNCs by encapsulation. Snaith and co-workers85 have fabricated a buffer layer of perovskite/Al2O3 to enhance perovskite solar cells' long-term stability. Park and co-workers86 have achieved high stability in organic, inorganic lead halide perovskites encapsulated by Al2O3. Balakrishna and co-workers87 have investigated that the encapsulation of CsPbBr3 by TiO2 provides stable perovskite NCs with high PLQY.


3.5.2 Encapsulation in the polymer matrix. 
Inorganic polymers, such as polycarbosilanes (PCS) and polysiloxanes (PSZ) and organic polymers like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polybutyl methacrylate (PBMA), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene oxide (PEO), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) have specific mechanical and structural properties like hardness, thermal stability, moisture stability, and oxidation stability. Therefore, this uniqueness promotes the utilization of these polymer materials to improve the stability of PNCs by encapsulation.88 Yoon et al. have synthesized thermally and environmentally stable CsPbBr3@PSZ composites.89 Zhang and their co-workers90 have developed water-resistant lead halide perovskite composites using PMMA, PBMA, and PS polymers. They observed highly stable perovskites composites film. Pelaz and co-workers91a have stabilized CsPbBr3 NCs in water by encapsulating amphiphilic polymer poly-(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride)-graft-dodecyl (PMA). Yang and their co-workers have improved water/thermal stability of CsPbBr3 NCs with the encapsulation of PS fibers.91b In another work, Cha et al. have stabilized all inorganic perovskite QDs encapsulating in PS fibers by electrospinning strategy for optical imagining.91c Chen and co-workers have reported core/shell strategy based stable MAPbBr3 nanofibers by using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a shell.91d


3.5.3. Advantage and disadvantage of MOFs encapsulation over alternative encapsulation techniques. 
In order to improve the stability of PNCs, numerous polymers, organic materials, and inorganic porous matrix including TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3 have been typically adopted.81,85,87–90 The majority of polymers have high oxygen diffusion coefficients, which negatively affect the durability and performance of PNCs.92 However, organic materials don't appear to be the greatest choice for preserving PNCs because of their poor temperature resistance. In general, inorganic matrixes outperform organic ones in terms of strength and thermal sensitivity. By incorporating PNCs into the inorganic matrix, the stability of the PNCs significantly improved.82 Nonetheless, it is challenging to maintain the remarkable optical performance of PNCs. Key characteristics of MOFs are their huge porosity, high specific surface area, and vast structural diversity. MOFs are composed of organic ligands and inorganic metal ions and have a unique architecture. MOFs serve as exemplary porous materials, are frequently used in a variety of fields, including biomedicine, display, gas storage, catalysis, adsorption, chemical sensors, and illumination.22–29 MOF materials are the reasonable alternative to enhance the extrinsic and intrinsic stability of the integrated PNCs, low photoluminescence quenching, and reduced agglomeration. The catalytic activity of PNCs is enhanced by the large specific surface area of MOFs and uniformly distributed active sites on metal ions and linkers.28,29 Zhang et al. have produced PNCs inside the MOF pores using a direct conversion technique, although this type of encapsulation is not possible with traditional encapsulating materials.93 The innovative composite materials with several advantages are encouraged by this combination. By modifying organic linkers and metal nodes, multifunctional MOFs can be designed as host matrices more effectively than conventional encapsulation materials. With the use of the PNCs@MOF combo, numerous brand-new applications that were previously unrecognized in the field of PNCs have been feasible, such as encryption decryption, metal ion detection from water, and multiphoton excited upconversion luminescence.93–95
Despite all this, there is still a problem; the encapsulation of large sized PQDs is incompatible with the microporous MOFs, which are only appropriate for the encapsulation of small sized PQDs because their pores are mostly restricted to the microporous range.


3.5.4. Selection of MOFs for stability improvement of PNCs. 
The current techniques for using MOF to increase the stability of lead halide PNCs can manifest in different ways. (1) In the process of creating MOFs, nitrogen-containing organic linkers and high-valent metal ions with greater charge gradients and coordination numbers can be utilized, which results the construction of robust structures and tight coordination connections (applying SHAB theory).96,97a (2) Producing superhydophobic MOFs containing Pb nodes for the encapsulation of PNCs using the direct conversion approach can also boost the stability of PNCs. (3) High stability and favorable optical properties can be archived by building large pore size MOFs with high surface areas that facilitate the loading of PNCs into mesoporous MOFs.98


3.5.5. The role of MOFs in improving PNC stability. 
The creation of ultra-small crystals is a result of the porous structure of MOFs acting as a well defined matrix to restrain crystal growth. The stable MOF matrix maintains the PNCs apart, considerably decreasing the probability of crystal fusion.99 In order to further deter water from perovskite nanocrystals, a hydrophobic MOF matrix can be applied, which enables the materials to operate in a humid condition. Ghosh and co-workers have protected the MAPbBr3 NCs by the ZIF-8 against polar solvents, water, heat, and light. The structural integrity of PNCs is facilitated by their encapsulation within MOFs.94 Xia and co-workers have developed water resistance CH3NH3PbBr3 PQDs with the encapsulation of MOF-5.100 PCN-221(Fex) have protected the MAPbI3 NCs which lead to perform the CO2 reduction in water medium.101 In order to shield the individual PNCs from oxygen or moisture, the MOF matrix can encapsulate them in nano-sized heterostructure. Substantial evidence of this uniqueness originates from the in situ growth of PNCs within the MOF pores.99 The pore size of the MOF can also be modified from micro to mesoporous ranges. The increase in pore size facilitates the fabrication and maximize the encapsulation of PQDs enables the protection of perovskites.29
The degradation of PNCs occurs through merging, ion migration, or interface polarization. But, MOF encapsulation is the best way to suppress these stability adverses. This can be discussed through some comparative studies.
According to study by Nie and his group, the bulk MAPbBr3 loses its emission after 6 hours and the CsPbBr3 NCs lose 20% of their initial emission intensity after 34 h of UV exposure. In contrast, the Pb-MOF protected MAPbBr3 NCs maintain their emission intensity after 200 h of UV exposure. The reason for the improved stability is the protection provided by the MOF matrix, which prevents the PNCs from fusing.93b The CsPbBr3/MOF-5 maintains 72.8% of its original PL intensity while heating up and continues to emit light even at 120 °C. Under irradiation of UV-light for 80 h, maintains 71.4% of its initial emission intensity and maintains 79.2% of its emission intensity after 60 days of storage, but unpreserved CsPbBr3 QDs rapidly lose their PL intensity. The breakdown of unstable surface ligands and the consequent particle aggregation, which causes the loss of quantum confinement and the development of carrier traps lead to the degradation of PNCs. Mesoporous MOF-5 crystals work well as a matrix to incorporate the PNCs CsPbX3 and prevent them from coming into contact with one another in order to improve instability.98 In polar solvents, the oleic acid stabilized PNCs losses their optical property immediately, Hou et al. have developed (CsPbI3)0.25(agZIF-62)0.75 composite by liquid phase sintering of ZIF-62 MOF glass and perovskite. The processable composites exhibit exceptional resistance to exposure to heat, light, air, and ambient humidity along with immersion in water and organic solvents. They observed significant improvement in the stability and optical performance of composite as compared to pristine perovskite. These findings demonstrate the interfacial interaction between MOF and perovskite lead to the surface defect passivation of perovskite by MOF.97b Further, we have also covered several reports of MOF-induced stability improvement in depth in the MOF encapsulation section.

4. Methodology for the formation of perovskite NCs@MOFs composite
In the last three decades, the development of hybrid inorganic-organic materials, mainly metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), has attracted researchers due to their tunable porosity and high specific surface area.
These are the combination of metal ions that act as connectors, and organic ligands act as linkers, as shown in Fig. 4, which generate open crystalline frameworks.102 Researchers have reported the various effective strategies to improve the environmental stabilization and applications broadening of LHP NCs, ever since work has started in the field of LHP. The formation approaches of perovskite@MOF nanocomposite have been established by incorporation of as-synthesized perovskite NCs within the MOF and nucleation of perovskite NCs inside the MOF cavities.29
 Fig. 4  Schematic representation of the construction of MOFs using metal ion and organic ligands. 
4.1 Ship-in-Bottle
This method is categorized in three sections as shown in Fig. 5: (I) physical mixing – in this strategy, the presynthesized perovskite NCs are directly mixed with MOF by sonication or stirring (Fig. 5a). The mesoporous MOFs are very suitable materials for the encapsulation of LHP NCs inside the pore. (II) Direct conversion – by using Pb-containing MOFs as a starting material is a convenient way for the conversion of Pb-MOF to LHP NCs@MOF composite as shown in Fig. 5b. In the conversion process, synthesized Pb-MOF is treated with monovalent cation through a suitable solvent. This process is very simple, fast, and reduces the use of capping ligands to generate LHP NCs.

(c) Sequential deposition; (d) “one-pot fabrication” technique for the composite formation; (e) “bottle-around-ship” method where perovskite is used as a template for the synthesis of perovskite@MOF composite. 
(III) Sequential deposition – in this process, the perovskite precursors are deposited sequentially in presynthesized MOF to generate LHP NCs inside the MOF (Fig. 5c). It is a two-step process; in the first step, the Pb ion is deposited in synthesized MOF. In the second step, the halide ion is introduced in Pb-deposited MOF through a suitable halide precursor.29,103
4.2 One-pot fabrication
In this method, the precursors of MOF and perovskite are mixed in an appropriate solvent, after applying reaction conditions MOF constructs first then LHP NCs are generated in the MOF cavity after adding a suitable antisolvent as illustrated in Fig. 5d. The one-pot synthesis technique is preferentially used because it saves time as well as cost. To control the crystallinity, shape, and size of perovskite for trapping inside the MOF the extra capping agents are added.103,104
4.3 Bottle-around-ship
In this technique, the MOF precursors are added with pre-synthesized LHP NCs for the formation of perovskite@MOF composite (Fig. 5e). The construction of MOF proceeds on the surface of pre-synthesized perovskite whereby MOF covers the perovskite NCs. Here, protecting the crystallinity of perovskite from the polar solvents, oxygen, and temperature during the synthesis of MOF is very challenging because the surface of LHP NCs can be damaged under the above-mentioned reaction conditions.29,104
Recently, the encapsulation of LHP NCs within the MOF has emerged as a revolutionary scenario in terms of stability and new applications (Fig. 6).

5 MOFs induced stability enhancement of perovskites
In the last five years, the perovskite community has adopted an effective way to improve the environmental stability of LHPNCs by encapsulating perovskites in MOF.
Chen et al.105 in 2016 have used microporous HKUST-1 (Cu3(BTC)2, BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylate) MOF as a template for CH3NH3PbI2X (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite QDs generated by incorporation of PbI2 and CH3NH3X into HKUST-1 shown in Fig. 5a. On exposing MAPI2Cl, MAPbI2Br, and MAPbI2Br@HKUST-1 in moist air at 70% humidity for four days. The XRD peaks intensity of MAPI2Cl and MAPbI2Br (Fig. 7b and c) powder decreased continuously from 0 to 4 days, but in the case of MAPbI2Br@HKUST-1, almost the same XRD pattern (Fig. 7d) was observed after four days. These results have proved the role of MOF to enhance the environmental stability of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites.

In this stepwise approach, the first synthesized lead bromide containing PbBr2@MOF-5 precursor by solvothermal method. In the second step, CH3NH3Br solution was added into PbBr2@MOF-5 to synthesize CH3NH3PbBr3@MOF-5 composites at room temperature (Fig. 8a). They observed the water-resistance emission property of CH3NH3PbBr3@MOF-5 composite in the presence of water on different days for 30 days shown in Fig. 8b. In this investigation, the PL results exhibit excellent water stability of CH3NH3PbBr3 with MOF-5. The improvement in thermal stability of CH3NH3PbBr3@MOF-5 than PbBr2@MOF-5 was also measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shown in Fig. 8c.

Upon irradiating the light under 436 nm for 100 min, the as-synthesized ZJU-28⊃MAPbBr3 exhibited 94% PL intensity of initial (Fig. 9a). It maintained 89% luminescence intensity of initial after one week in the presence of air shown in Fig. 9c. This strategy provides the excellent stability of MAPbBr3QDs.

The confinement of CsPbX3 QDs within porous Cu-BDC (copper-benzene-1,4 dicarboxylate) MOF was reported to stabilize the perovskite.106 MOF was synthesized by the solvothermal method in this work, and then perovskite precursor was introduced into pre-synthesized Cu-BDC MOF (Fig. 10a). The photoluminescence stability for CsPbCl3@Cu-BDC, CsPbBr3@Cu-BDC, and CsPbI3@Cu-BDC was recorded for up to 2 months, shown in Fig. 10b–d, respectively. In all the cases, they found almost the same luminescence intensity after two months, demonstrating the stability enhancement of CsPbX3 QDs.

CsPbX3 QDs were stabilized by using [(NH2Me2)2][Zn3(L)2]·9H2O (L = 5,50-(1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))bis-(oxy)diisophthalate) AMOF-1 as a host adopting mechanochemical synthesis approach.107 The AMOF-1 was synthesized by solvothermal method, and then dimethylammonium (DMA) guest cations from [(NH2Me2)2][Zn3(L)2]·9H2O were replaced by Pb2+ at room temperature. Eventually, the CsPbX3@AMOF-1 was obtained by grounding PbII@AMOF-1 with CsX in mortar and pestle shown in Fig. 11a. The stability of perovskites in composite was investigated in different solvents after several time intervals. The same emission intensity was observed in acetonitrile, toluene, and dimethylformamide solvents over 14 days (Fig. 11a and b). It shows that AMOF-1 provides strong binding sites for CsPbX3perovskites in these solvent mediums.

The encapsulation of CsPbX3 QDs in mesoporous MOF-5 (MOF-5 = Zn2+ as a metal ion with 1,4 dicarboxybenzene as a linker) is a practical approach for stability improvement.98 The solvothermal method was used to develop mesoporous MOF-5 and the traditional hot-injection strategy was followed for the synthesis of CsPbX3 QDs. The composite form of CsPbX3/MOF-5 was fabricated by the solution-mediated mixing of MOF-5 with CsPbX3 QDs at room temperature (Fig. 12a). Upon heating up to 120 °C, the CsPbB3/MOF-5 composites show emission property, which highlights in (Fig. 12b). When CsPbBr3/MOF-5 was kept under UV light for 80 h, It shows 71.4% emission intensity of its initial (Fig. 12c), and the stored CsPbBr3/MOF-5 exhibits 79.2% PL intensity of fresh sample intensity for 60 days shown in Fig. 12d.

Highly stable perovskite NCs@MOF composite have reported by Mollick at el.94 the hybrid bromide perovskite (HBPs) was encapsulated in ZIF-8 using the solvent directed strategy at room temperature as shown in Fig. 13a. In this approach, the perovskite precursor and ZIF-8 segments (Zn2+ and 2-methylimidazole) with capping agent (OABr, n-octylammonium bromide) were dissolved in the mixture of DMF and methanol at constant stirring. The long-term photoluminescence stability of MAPbBr3@ZIF-8 composite shown in Fig. 13b, after ten months composite exhibited only 85% loss of initial PL intensity. The phase stability of MAPbBr3@ZIF-8 composite was examined by XRD analysis (Fig. 13c), the same diffraction pattern of composite immersed in water immersed after 90 days points out the high stability of the composite. In Fig. 13d, upon UV irradiation, composite maintained its PL intensity of 90% and on heating material exhibited 70% PL intensity of initial. All these stability experiments indicate that the ZIF-8 porous MOF act as a protector for perovskite from the environment.

Recently, our group has reported the stability improvement of CsPbBr3 NCs binding with Cu-BTC MOF. In this report, CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs were engaged with Cu-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylate) by physical mixing of MOF microrods with as-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs as shown in Fig. 14a. The Cu-BTC MOF improved PLQY of CsPbBr3 NCs from 51.66% to 96.51%. Moreover, the stability of CsPbBr3 NCs improved considerably on adding Cu-BTC in the toluene solution containing CsPbBr3 NCs. In Fig. 14b, the fluorescent microscopy image of CsPbBr3NCs@Cu-BTC composite exhibits binding of fluorescent CsPbBr3 NCs with Cu-BTC microrods. The stability test of CsPbBr3 NCs and CsPbBr3 NCs@Cu-BTC composite was performed by recording photoluminescence spectra for 3 months (Fig. 14c and d). The pristine CsPbBr3 NCs show around 68% PL intensity loses after 1 month, while Cu-BTC protected CsPbBr3 NCs retains 90% PL intensity.

After 3 months, pristine CsPbBr3 NCs show quenching in emission but Cu-BTC treated CsPbBr3 NCs retain around 50% emission intensity. These findings have proved that the engagement of CsPbBr3 NCs with Cu-BTC MOF is a very impressive strategy to improve the optical performance as well as environmental stability of perovskite NCs.108
6. Applications
6.1 Solar cells
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a remarkable reputation in photovoltaics in a short time from 2009 due to the low-cost device fabrication and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).109 The uniform morphology and high crystallinity of perovskite thin-film are important factors in achieving excellent charge transport in solar cells.110,111 The high crystalline porous MOFs could be improved the environmental stability and photovoltaic performance of lead halide perovskite solar cells. The first time, Ho and co-workers112 have fabricated the mesoporous nanocrystalline Zr-based porphyrin MOF (MOF-525) incorporated CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer (5 v/v%) and achieved the PCE of 12.0%. Ryu et al.113 have developed a Ti-based MOF (MIL-125(Ti), titanium oxocarboxo cluster [Ti8O8(OH)4(-COO)6] bonded with a 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) linker) electron transport layer (ETL) for flexible PSC (Fig. 15a). The nTi-MOF makes easy the electron transfer between mixed cation (MAPbI3)0.95(FAPbI3)0.05 perovskite layers and electrode, gained 18.94% and 17.43% PCEs for rigid and flexible devices. In order of the upgrade in photovoltaic performance, the efficiency of 16.99% was recorded in PSC by the coating of ZIF-8 layer between the interface of mesoporous-TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film.114 Zeng and co-workers99 have achieved 13.17% PCE in (CH3NH3) PbI3 PCS by the doping of 2D Pb-MOF (using 1,3,5-H3BTC (benzene tricorboxylic acid) as a linker) in the hole transport layer (HTL). It was 25% more PCE than without doping of Pb-MOF in HTL, and the MOF-based PSC exhibited high durability than without MOF PSC. Chueh and co-workers115 have added Zr(IV)-based MOFs (UiO-66 and MOF-808) in perovskite precursor to develop heterojunction (perovskite/UiO-66 or perovskite/MOF-808) for PSCs. The MAPbI3/UiO-66 and MAPbI3/MOF-808 heterojunction containing PSCs were provided 18.01% and 17.81% PCEs, respectively. It is noticeable that the MOFs loaded PSCs exhibited high PCEs and environmental stability than pristine PSCs. The emergence of heterojunction light-harvesting layer of [In12O(OH)16(H2O)5(btc)6]n (In-BTC) MOF/Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite gained 20.87% PCE. It displayed more durability than without incorporating perovskite in MOF (Fig. 15b and c)116 Eslamian and co-workers117 were applied the ZIF-8 as a scaffold between TiO2 layer and Cs/MA/FA perovskites in PSC. They observed batter crystallinity, high photovoltaic performance, and stability improvement of PCS than without ZIF-8 incorporation (Fig. 15d).

6.2 W-LEDs
The LHP NCs are well known as suitable light-emitting materials. Therefore, lead halide perovskites have been extensively used to fabricate light-emitting diodes (LEDs). But the poor environmental stability of LHPs restricts the performance parameters (external quantum efficiency (EQE), current efficiency (CE), and luminescence) of LED.118,119 The loading of perovskites with MOFs has been applied to enhance the stability and optical performance of the fabricated LED compared to without MOF. Ren et al.98a have improved the emission lifetime of CsPbX3 QDs by encapsulating in mesoporous MOF-5 (as have explained above).
Moreover, the white LEDs (W-LEDs) were developed by utilizing CsPbX3/MOF-5 composites as phosphors. In this W-LEDs formation, the CsPbBr3/MOF-5 and CsPbBr0.6I2.4/MOF-5 composites were deposited onto a blue-emitting InGaN LED chip with UV light treated adhesive. Under 200 mA current, this LED emitted white light consistently with emission spectra of CsPbX3/MOF-5 (Fig. 16a). In Fig. 16b, the commission Internationable del’eclairage (CIE) coordinates of CsPbX3/MOF-5 W-LED exhibited the characteristic correlated color temperature of 3607 K for white light reflectance. The high luminescence efficiency of 21.6 lm W−1 was measured for CsPbX3/MOF-5 W-LED. Zhang et al. have fabricated a white LED by encapsulation of CH3NH3PbBr3QDs in Bio-MOF-1 and with the mixing of Ru-Bio-MOF-1. The Bio-MOF-1 enhanced the air stability of emission performance of QDs therefore; it proved to be an effective approach for LED. The synthesized powder form of Bio-MOF-1, PQDs-Bio-MOF-1, and Ru-Bio-MOF-1 exhibited emission of blue, green, and red light, respectively. When these blue, green, and red luminescent powders were mixed in the mass ratio of 18:6:3 obtained white light emission, and then fabricated a W-LED (Fig. 16c). The CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.31) represented the white light emission shown in Fig. 16d. These results prove the usefulness of MOFs with perovskites to decide the future of W-LEDs.120

6.3 Information security
The invisible nature (reducing the scattering) and stability of some porous MOF materials have an advantage with fluorescent LHPs for security purposes. The formation of perovskites inside the Pb-MOF (Pb2 (1,3,5-HBTC)2(H2O)) can act as an air-stable and invisible material. This approach was utilized for the synthesis of security ink, which is based on the principle of encryption and decryption. When added MA halide precursor into Pb-MOF, the luminescence appeared under UV light and quenching was observed in the contact of MeOH (Fig. 17a and b). In this reversible process, on the impregnation of MeOH, the composite was converted to white color. Adding MA became yellow–green; therefore, this system proved very suitable for coding and decoding confidential information.93 The different emission color in MAPbBr3@EuMOF was examined at varying temperature and exciting wavelength, red at 254 nm and green at 365 nm.121 Moreover, the reversible quenching and regeneration of emission were observed by adding water and MABr, respectively shown in Fig. 17c. The invisible nature of the PbBr2@UiO-66 MOF composite has been used for information decryption and encryption. Upon adding MABr in PbBr2@UiO-66 MOF invisible ink, the information can decrypt and encrypted by impregnating water shown in Fig. 17d. This reversible decryption and encryption property of PbBr2@UiO-66 MOF provides beneficial security applications.122

6.4 Photocatalysis
The perovskites have potential applications due to their high charge carrier mobility. The photocatalytic activity of perovskite depends upon its charge transfer efficiency and durability. The low stability of perovskites in a water-containing medium reduced its photocatalytic performance.
The loading of perovskites in porous MOFs has emerged as an effective way to enhance the stability as well as the catalytic activity of perovskites. Because porous MOFs act as a protective layer for perovskites NCs, improving hydrophobicity of perovskites. The MOFs also provide a high specific surface area, which upgrades the route of photoinduced electron transfer in the perovskite/MOFs system, enhancing photocatalytic activity.123,124 The Core@Shell CsPbBr3@Zeolitic imidazolate MOF nanocomposite has demonstrated the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Fig. 18a). Moreover, the both ZIF MOF of Co2+ and Zn2+ have also increased the stability of CsPbBr3 QDs. In CO2 reduction activity, the electron consumption rates of 15.498 μmol g−1 h−1 were achieved for CsPbBr3@ZIF-8, and it was 29.630 μmol g−1 h−1 for CsPbBr3@ZIF-67. These rates were more than that of CsPbBr3 QDs without MOFs shown in Fig. 18b.123 Wang and co-workers124 have developed CsPbBr3 QDs/UiO-66(NH2) nanocomposite for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 shown in Fig. 18c and d. The highest photocatalytic performance of 98.57 μmol g−1 was achieved upon using 15%-CsPbBr3QDs/UiO-66(NH2) of the nanocomposite, which was more than the pristine CsPbBr3QDs and UiO-66(NH2).

The encapsulated CH3NH3PbI3 QDs in Fe-porphyrin-based PCN-221(Fex) MOF has been applied for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Fig. 18e and f) in the water medium. After reduction, CO2 was converted into CH4 (325 mmol g−1) and CO (104 mmol g−1). The Fe catalytic site has contributed a vital role in achieving excellent photocatalytic performance. PCN-221(Fex) MOF protected the MAPbBr3 QDs in an aqueous medium and gained record photocatalytic activity of MAPbBr3 QDs@PCN-221(Fe0.2) composite than QDs@PCN-221(Fe0.2). In this system, MAPbBr3 QDs increased the absorption capacity of composite because it has a high absorption coefficient, and the high charge separation was provided by PCN-221.101
6.5 Emission tunability
Lead halide perovskite NCs have demonstrated their excellent absorption and emission properties. One of them, the characteristic emission wavelength tunability, makes them unique from other non-molecular semiconductors. This band-gap tunable property has been controlled by compositional engineering and the quantum confinement effect.125–128 The impactful emission tunability has also been investigated in porous MOFs impregnated lead halide perovskite NCs.129,130
The emission tunability of MAPbBr3 QDs was controlled by ZJU-28 MOF encapsulation engineering with reaction time. The emission wavelength was gently tuned from 509 nm to 530 nm, corresponding to increasing reaction time from 1 to 21 h, respectively, as shown in Fig. 19a. In this order, it was exciting that the narrow full width half maximum (FWHM) from 45 to 25 nm was observed with reaction time controlled by MOF.95

Chen and co-workers131 have reported the confinement of MAPbBr3 QDs within UIO-66 using initially developed Pb2+@UiO-66 MOF, as shown in Fig. 19b. The blue emission shift from 540 to 486 nm was investigated on increasing the concentration of Pb2+ in Pb2+@UiO-66 precursor (Fig. 19c) the size of PQDs was reduced from 6.4 to 3.3 nm.
6.6 Detection and sensing
Halide perovskite NCs have achieved tremendous environmental stability by getting shelter from porous MOFs. Recently, the MOFs decorated perovskite NCs have appeared their supreme luminescent properties in different external aggravations like temperature and polar solvents. The water resistivity of MOFs encapsulated perovskite NCs can be utilized for metal detection as a fluorescent sensing probe in a water medium. Zhang et al.100 have reported CH3NH3PbBr3@MOF-5 composite for metal ions detection based on fluorescence intensity changes as shown in Fig. 20a. The nitrate salts of metal ions were dissolved in an aqueous medium, and composite was added to this water solution. On recording the luminescent spectra in the case of Al3+, Bi3+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ metal ion, quenching in the emission of particular intensity for each ion was observed. But in the case of Cd2+ metal ion, the emission intensity was enhanced, which informs that Cd2+ shows effective interaction with the composite system. The concentration-dependent PL study of Cu2+ and Cd2+ was also recorded.

These results have indicated the CH3NH3PbBr3@MOF-5 worked as a selective fluorescent probe for individual metal ions. In another report, Yu and co-workers132 have developed CsPbBr3 QDs encapsulated Eu-BTC MOF composite for a luminescent thermometer. The dual emission behavior was measured based on fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR). In CsPbBr3 QDs@ Eu-BTC MOF composite system on 20 °C CsPbBr3 QDs shows high PL intensity at 528 nm and on 100 °C Eu3+ exhibits high emission intensity at 618 nm (Fig. 20b). At 20 °C, the CsPbBr3@Eu-BTC composite represents the sensitivity of 3.9% with a high-temperature resolution of 0.004 results are showing that this composite acts as a dependable sensor for the measurement of emission behavior at a particular temperature.
6.7 Photoelectrocatalysis
Qiao et al.133 have confined CsPbBr3 NCs inside the PCN-333(Fe) MOF for photoelectrocatalytic purposes. In this report, PCN-333(Fe) MOF was immersed in PbBr2 containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF) solution for the penetration of PbBr2 in MOF. The developed PbBr2@PCN-333(Fe) was again immersed in CsBr containing DMSO solution and after that CsPbBr3 NCs were stabilized within the MOFs pores by adding oleylamine and oleic acid (Fig. 21a). The as-synthesized CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite suppressed the rate of photogenerated electron–hole recombination and displayed catalytic property in case of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These findings of the CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite made a suitable candidate as a photocathode for Li–O2 battery. In charge and discharge profile of Li–O2 battery as shown in Fig. 21b CsPbBr3 and PCN-333(Fe) exhibited 3.00 and 2.88 V values respectively while CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite showed 3.19 V under illumination. Moreover, CsPbBr3 and PCN-333(Fe) cathode displayed a high discharged voltage of 2.5 V in Li–O2 battery (Fig. 21c) than that of PCN-333(Fe) (2.4 V) and CsPbBr3 (<2 V) under illumination varying current densities. In Fig. 21d the cathode of composite represented excellent cycling polarization for 200 h while perovskite and MOF showed high polarization but both could not maintain it for a long time as compared to CsPbBr3@PCN-333(Fe) composite. Therefore, the combination strategy of CsPbBr3 and Fe-MOF proved their utility as a durable and competent cathode material in photoassisted Li–O2 battery (Table 1).

7. Summary and outlook
In this review, we have demonstrated the causes of the degradation of lead halide perovskite NCs, such as structural, atmospheric, and thermal. We have also discussed the various strategies to improve the stability of LHP NCs. For instance, the synthesis of PNCs with low dimensionality of the inorganic part, surface treatment with hydrophobic molecules, and capping the perovskites with polymers or inorganic oxides have been effectively used to improve the environmental stability of PNCs. Loading of NCs inside the cavities of porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been of topical interest to enhance the durability and potential applications of NCs. The MOFs have the merit of tunable porosity, high specific surface area, and environmental stability. The MAPbBr3@ZIF-8 composite has demonstrated its long-term photoluminescence stability over ten months, losing only 85% of initial PL intensity. Moreover, this composite system has proved its existence after immersed in water for over 90 days, which indicated the excellent stability of perovskite NCs in literature. The MOFs have boosted the environmental stability of perovskite solar cells with high photovoltaic performance.
The loading of perovskites with MOFs has been applied to enhance the fabricated LED's stability and optical performance compared to without MOF. The loading of perovskites in porous MOFs has emerged as an effective way to improve the stability and catalytic activity of perovskites, enhancing the hydrophobicity of perovskites. The MOFs also provide a high specific surface area that upgrades the photogenerated electron transfer range in the perovskite/MOFs system, enhancing photocatalytic activity. The characteristic emission wavelength tunability has proved them unique in comparison to other non-molecular semiconductors. The impactful emission tunability has also been investigated in porous MOFs impregnated lead halide perovskite NCs. the MOFs decorated perovskite NCs have appeared their supreme luminescent properties different external aggravations like temperature and polar solvents. The water resistivity of MOFs encapsulated perovskite NCs has been used for metal detection as a fluorescent sensing probe in the water medium. With the findings, it has been cleared that MOFs' ability to improve the stability of lead halide perovskite has provided a beneficial platform in the present and future for the commercialization of perovskites.
The proposed methods are a good way to effectively encapsulate the lead halide PNCs within the MOF, but there is space for interpretation in terms of encapsulation of PNCs within pre-synthesized MOF creates complications due to pore size and NCs size mismatch. Furthermore, the future research can concentrate on the formation of MOF with appropriate pore size to facile encapsulation of PNCs. In lead halide PNCs@MOF composite, lead toxicity is a significant barrier to the widespread use of MOF promoted potential applications of lead halide perovskites. In near future, the scientific communities can explore new incorporations of lead free PNCs@MOF composite for the commercial applications of PNCs. The encapsulation of PNCs inside the MOF has proven the progress in optical and electrical properties of PNCs. But some combinations are still suffering from the long term stability of PNCs in water. To solve this issue, the future study can focus on the development of superhydrophobic MOF for the encapsulation of PNCs. Direct conversion can be a very efficient method for PNCs nucleation and development because it is rapid, inexpensive, and simple to carry out the experiment, and avoid the requirement of surface capping ligands. Therefore, designing alternative Pb-MOFs for PNCs encapsulation can be beneficial for future research.
