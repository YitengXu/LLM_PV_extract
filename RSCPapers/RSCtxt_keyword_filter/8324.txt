The influence of AgNW@SiO2 on the performance of the TiO2–AgNW photoanodes and DSSCs is investigated. Studies indicates that the range and strength of light absorption of the TiO2 photoanodes, the photon capture ability of the dye molecules, and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) are significantly increased while the dark current is decreased due to the incorporation of AgNW@SiO2. The optimal properties are obtained in a DSSC with a Jsc of 11.83 mA cm−2, and an overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of 6.26%, significantly superior to those of the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode. The enhancements of Jsc and η are attributed to the increase of light coupling and thus the light absorption of the dye due to the localized surface plasmon resonance and the possible enhanced light scattering of AgNW@SiO2 in the photoanode.
1 Introduction
The increasing concern over the crises of energy and global warming have motivated the creation of environmentally and economically viable new energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 the third generation photovoltaics comprised of typically a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode film covered by a monolayer of dye molecules, a redox electrolyte, and a counter-electrode in a sandwich structure, have great potential to be a promising alternative to conventional silicon solar cells due to their relatively high power conversion efficiencies, low cost, simple fabrication processes and potential enormous economical advantages.2–5 To enhance the conversion efficiency of DSSCs, considerable efforts have been directed at controlling the TiO2 photoanode with various nanostructure morphologies,6–8 dopants,9–11 newly synthesized redox shuttles12 and dyes capable of effectively absorbing visible and near-infrared light.13 The dye in a DSSC acts as a photo-absorber and plays a significant role in absorbing light, generating photo-stimulated carriers, and injecting them into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanocrystalline network. Thus, the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the dye and how many carriers it stimulates directly affect the carrier injection and performance of DSSCs. Therefore, enhancing the LHE of the dye should be an effective way to improve the performance of DSSCs. Recently, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanostructures has been regarded as a promising way to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices.14 LSPR is an interesting and unique characteristic of metal nanostructures, and some studies on improving the performance of DSSCs by enhancing the light absorption of dye via LSPR have been conducted recently.15–18 However, most of these studies were confined to spheroidal metal nanoparticles, while studies on those with nanostructures of other non-spherical symmetries like nanowire are scarce.
In this study, monodisperse silver nanowires (AgNWs) encased within a silica shell (AgNW@SiO2) were fabricated by a modified Stober method19 and applied for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to improve the performance of DSSCs. Different amounts of core–shell AgNW@SiO2 were incorporated into TiO2 nanocrystalline films to form the composite photoanodes for the DSSCs, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The influence of the AgNW@SiO2 on the performance of the DSSCs and the mechanisms of their effects were investigated.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Commercial TiO2 powder (P25) was purchased from Evonik Degussa (New Jersey). Ethanol (EtOH, 95%), Triton-X100, acetylacetone, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 20000), AgNO3 (>99.8%), ethylene glycol (99.9%), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%), ammonia (28–30 wt% NH3 in water), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 55000 in terms of monomeric units) (>99.5%) and propylene carbonate (PC) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corporation (China). Ru dye and cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N719) were purchased from Solaronix (Switzerland). Iodine (I2, 99.8%) was acquired from Beijing Yili chemicals (China). Lithium iodide (LiI, 99%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were purchased from Acros. Fluorine-doped SnO2 conductive glasses (FTO, sheet resistance 10–15 Ω sq−1, Asahi Glass, Japan) were used as the substrate for the deposition of mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film. All water used in the fabrication was deionized (18.2 MΩ, milli-Q pore).
2.2 Synthesis of AgNW@SiO2 core–shell structure
The AgNWs were prepared by a liquid-solution-phase reduction approach reported previously.20 This as-prepared AgNW solution was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min three times to remove excess solvent (EG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and other impurities in the supernatant. To protect them from being eroded by electrolyte, the AgNWs were then coated with silica to form a AgNW@SiO2 core–shell structure by the modified Stober method.19,21 The as-prepared AgNWs and AgNW@SiO2 were then redispersed in a vial of ethanol solution and wrapped with foil for further use.
2.3 Fabrication of photoanodes and DSSCs
TiO2 pastes were produced by ball milling the TiO2 powder.11 The TiO2 pastes containing different amounts of AgNW were synthesized by incorporating different amounts of AgNW@SiO2 into the TiO2 pastes according to a series of mass ratios (Ag:TiO2 = 0, 0.2%, 0.4% 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%). These TiO2–AgNW composite pastes were coated on FTO glasses by a doctor-blading technique, then dried under ambient conditions and sintered at 500 °C to obtain TiO2–AgNW composite photoanodes. Then, these photoanodes were sensitized by immersing them into a solution of cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N719) with a concentration of 500 μM in a mixture of EtOH and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio: 1/1) at 60 °C overnight. Then these sensitized photoanodes were washed with EtOH to remove any physisorbed dye molecules on the surface of the nanocrystalline TiO2 films to ensure that these films were covered with a monolayer of dye molecules and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. These photoanodes and platinized counter electrodes were then assembled to form a DSSC by sandwiching a redox (I−/I3−) electrolyte solution.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology of the AgNWs was characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, 6700F, Japan). The crystalline structure of the AgNWs was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). The AgNWs in two vials with and without SiO2 coating were both sonicated in an ultrasonic bath and then transferred onto Cu grids for transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010FEF(UHR)) characterization. The chemical species of the AgNW@SiO2 were analyzed by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, GENESIS 70000). The UV-vis absorption spectra of these samples were obtained on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian). The baseline was subtracted from the absorption spectrum by placing an identical sample holder containing no sample in the path of an identical light beam during the measurement. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5 simulated illumination (Newport, 91192, Global)) with an effective irradiated area of 0.25 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded by a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation CHI660C (Shanghai, China) with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under the conditions of open circuit under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The amount of dye loaded on the photoanodes was measured by the UV-vis spectra of the dye desorbed from these photoanodes upon immersing them in a mixed solution of water and ethanol (volume ratio = 1:1) containing 0.1 M NaOH.
3 Results and discussion
The SEM image (Fig. 2a) taken of the AgNWs shows that these nanowires are several micrometers in length with a uniform diameter and high aspect ratio. The XRD pattern of these AgNWs is shown in Fig. 2b, and the diffraction peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311) confirm the face-center-cubic structure of Ag. Fig. 2c shows a TEM image of an individual AgNW with an average diameter of about 55 nm. An HRTEM image shown in Fig. 2d indicates the high crystallinity of the AgNWs. The left upper corner inset shows clear lattice fringes of the AgNWs with lattice spacings of 0.235 nm. Fig. 2e presents a typical selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the AgNWs, a series of concentric diffraction rings indicate the polycrystallinity of the nanowires. Silver nanomaterials with different shapes exhibit surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peaks at different frequencies.22 Hence, the morphology of silver nanostructures can also be tracked by UV-vis spectroscopy. Fig. 2f shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the AgNWs. Two SPR peaks at about 388 and 350 nm are clearly displayed in the spectrum, and are regarded as the optical signatures of silver nanowires.

Fig. 3a displays a TEM image at the edge of an as-prepared AgNW without silica coating, showing a bare and smooth surface of the AgNW. Meanwhile, there is a uniform silica coating on the edge of the AgNW@SiO2 core–shell structure shown in Fig. 3b. Further evidence for the core–shell structure was obtained from an EDX spectrum (Fig. 3c), in which, besides the Ag peak, Si and O peaks are also observed. Fig. 3d shows a UV-vis absorption spectra of the AgNWs dispersed in ethanol before and after coating with silica. It can be noted that the LSPR peak of the AgNW@SiO2 shifts slightly from 388 nm to 391 nm in comparison with the material without SiO2 coating. This significant red-shift of the LSPR peak is consistent with those reported in the literature, and can be explained by the change of the refractive index in the space surrounding the AgNWs.23,24

In order to assess the effect of the LSPR of AgNW@SiO2 on the light absorption of dye adsorbed in the films, mesoporous TiO2 films with different amounts of AgNW@SiO2 incorporated were prepared by doctor-blading. Fig. 4a shows the absorption spectra of these films before and after absorbing dye. Enhanced absorption of the TiO2 films with AgNW@SiO2 was observed in the whole visible region of the spectra in contrast to that of the pure TiO2 film. The greater the content of AgNW@SiO2 in the sensitized TiO2 films, the stronger the absorption of the TiO2 films in the whole visible region. This notably enhanced light absorption should be mainly attributed to the LSPR of AgNW@SiO2 in the TiO2 films; similar results were also observed in a DSSC system with photoanodes with Ag nanoparticles incorporated.18 To confirm our inference, the amount of dye absorbed in each film was determined by UV-vis absorption measurements. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye desorbed from the TiO2 films measured in NaOH solution are shown in Fig. 4b. It is noted that the absorption peak at around 510 nm of the dye desorbed from the TiO2 films with AgNW@SiO2 is slightly lower than that of the pure TiO2 film, indicating that the amount of dye loaded in the TiO2 films containing AgNW@SiO2 is less than that of the pure TiO2 film. This decrease in the amount of absorbed dye might be the result of the possible decreased surface area of the TiO2 films due to the incorporation of AgNW@SiO2. Despite the lower amount of dye loaded in the TiO2 films with AgNW@SiO2, these films exhibit stronger light absorption than that of the pure TiO2 film, which confirms our inference that the enhanced light absorption of the TiO2 films with AgNW@SiO2 does not arise from an increase in the amount of dye absorbed in the films but the LSPR of the AgNW@SiO2 which significantly improves the light absorption ability of the absorbed dye. Such LSPR originates from light (electromagnetic radiation) interacting with the free electrons of the AgNWs, which leads to collective excitation oscillations and results in a strong enhancement of the local electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the AgNWs. The enhanced electromagnetic field increases the interaction with the dye molecule dipoles and thus results in the enhanced light absorption of the dye and the charge carrier generation.25

To investigate the effect of LSPR on the performance of DSSCs, a series of DSSCs made of N719-dye-sensitized TiO2 film photoanodes with different amounts of AgNW@SiO2 were prepared. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these DSSCs are presented in Fig. 5a, and the cell performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen from the J–V curves, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) exhibits a significant and systematic change with the concentration of AgNW@SiO2. Jsc increases monotonically with increasing AgNW@SiO2 content ranging from 0 to 0.6 wt%. The largest Jsc of 11.83 mA cm−2 is obtained in the DSSC with 0.6 wt% AgNW@SiO2, significantly higher than that (9.69 mA cm−2) for the DSSC without AgNW@SiO2. This increase in photocurrent is consistent with the increase in intensity in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4a). However, when the AgNW@SiO2 content is further increased, Jsc decreases. As previously mentioned, the amount of dye loaded in the TiO2 films with AgNW@SiO2 is a little less than that of the pure TiO2 film. Therefore, the increase in Jsc can be mainly attributed to the enhanced light absorption of the dye (Fig. 4a) resulting from the interaction between the dye molecular dipole and the enhanced electromagnetic field induced by LSPR of AgNW@SiO2, which couples light more effectively and transfers a greater amount of photon energy to the dye to enhance charge carrier generation.26 Another possible reason for the enhanced Jsc may be associated with the enhanced light scattering induced by LSPR in the visible range in the composite films containing AgNW@SiO2, which would increase the optical path, reduce the transmission of incident light and increase the chance for dye molecules to capture and convert the photons to charge carriers.18,27,28 Meanwhile the decrease of Jsc in the DSSCs when the amount of AgNW@SiO2 is greater than 0.6 wt% can probably be explained as follows: an excess amount of AgNW@SiO2 in the TiO2 films may reduce the effective surface area of the TiO2 films and the amount of dye absorbed, and increase charge carrier recombination.29,30Fig. 5b shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs, which reflect the recombination level of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 with triiodide (I3−) to some extent. As shown in Fig. 5b, the dark current of the DSSC decreases with an increasing amount of AgNW@SiO2 and reaches a minimum value in the DSSC with the optimal amount of AgNW@SiO2, which is consistent with the J–V curves. This decrease in dark current might be attributed to the suppression of the recombination between triiodide (I3−) and the electrons transfered backward from the TiO2 films to the electrolyte.

Fig. 6 presents the dependence of the DSSC performance parameters (Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and energy conversion efficiency (η)) on the amount of AgNW@SiO2 in the TiO2 films. As previously mentioned, Jsc increases monotonically with an increase in the AgNW@SiO2 content ranging from 0 to 0.6 wt% and then decreases gradually. The optimized Jsc of 11.83 mA cm−2 is achieved in the DSSC with a AgNW@SiO2 content of 0.6 wt%, exhibiting a 22% enhancement in comparison with that (9.69 mA cm−2) in the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode. The Voc of the DSSCs containing AgNW@SiO2 is slightly lower than that of the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode as shown in Fig. 6b, which might be due to the loss of electron storage properties of the AgNW@SiO2 caused by the insulation properties of the SiO2 coating around it. A similar scenario was observed in an earlier studied Ag@SiO2 core–shell structure system.31 Compared to that of conventional DSSCs, the FFs of the DSSCs with AgNW@SiO2 (Table 1) show no obvious consistent changes. η of the DSSCs with different amounts of AgNW@SiO2 shows a similar tendency to vary to that of Jsc and reaches a maximum value of 6.26% in the DSSC with an optimal AgNW@SiO2 content of 0.6 wt%, 14.8% higher than that of the conventional DSSC (5.45%), as shown in Fig. 6a. These results suggest that a significant enhancement of Jsc and η is demonstrated in the DSSCs with AgNW@SiO2 due to the LSPR of AgNW@SiO2.

To reveal the difference in the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces of the conducting layer/TiO2, Pt/electrolyte, and dye/TiO2/electrolyte, the EIS of DSSCs is usually measured.32 EIS Nyquist plots of the DSSCs with and without AgNW@SiO2 were measured at the same forward bias, and typical examples are shown in Fig. 7a. From left to right, Z1 represents the complex impedance of charge transfer at the TiO2 conduction layer or Pt/electrolyte interface, and Z2 the complex impedance of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.33 Due to the fact that the same Pt-coated counter-electrode is applied in each of the DSSCs, the influence of Z1 can be ignored. Our main concern with the EIS spectra is focused on the charge transfer resistance R2 (real part of Z2) relating to the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. On the whole, the tendency (Fig. 7b) of R2 to vary in the DSSCs with different amounts of AgNW@SiO2 is the same as that for the dark current density (Fig. 5b). It can be noted that when the concentration of AgNW@SiO2 increases from 0 to 0.6 wt%, the diameter of Z2 decreases monotonically (Fig. 7a), and accordingly the charge transfer resistance R2 fitted using the simulation circuits (inset in Fig. 7a) decreases from 21.04 Ω for the conventional DSSC to 16.26 Ω for the DSSC with the optimal AgNW@SiO2 content of 0.6 wt%, as shown in Table 1. The smaller the diameter of Z2 in the Nyquist plots, the smaller the amount of the recombination reaction of electrons with triiodide ions and the excited dye at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface,34 and therefore the smaller the dark current and the larger the Jsc. However, an increase in R2 is observed upon further increasing the AgNW@SiO2 concentration, which is possibly due to the excess AgNW@SiO2 that might undermine dye in contact with TiO2 nanoparticles, prolong the electron transport length and then increase the chance of recombination.35

4 Conclusions
In summary, a series of composite TiO2 photoanodes with different amounts of core–shell AgNW@SiO2 incorporated were prepared and applied in DSSCs. The influence of AgNW@SiO2 on the performance of the photoanodes and DSSCs was investigated. The results demonstrated that the range and strength of light absorption of the TiO2 photoanodes, the photon capture ability of the dye molecules, and Jsc were significantly increased while the dark current was decreased due to the incorporation of AgNW@SiO2. The optimal properties were obtained in a DSSC with Jsc of 11.83 mA cm−2 and η of 6.26% at a AgNW@SiO2 content of 0.60 wt%, significantly superior to those of the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode. The enhancement of Jsc and η were attributed to the possible enhanced light scattering and the increased absorption of dye due to the increased effective light coupling by LSPR of AgNW@SiO2 in the photoanode. Meanwhile, the slight decrease of Voc in the DSSCs with AgNW@SiO2 might be related to the insulation properties of the SiO2 coating which may lead to the loss of electron storage properties of the AgNW@SiO2.
