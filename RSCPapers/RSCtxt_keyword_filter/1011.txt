    , Accepted 2nd July 2018First published on 5th July 2018AbstractHerein, we report a modified two-step method to construct a uniform and pinhole-free polycrystalline perovskite film with large grains up to the microscale using lead mixed-halide (PbI2–PbCl2) precursor solutions to guarantee the device functioning. Commonly used sequential deposition methods based on dip- and spin-coatings are combined with a vapor-assisted solution process to improve the perovskite morphology and tune the residual lead mixed-halides. These can enhance the optical absorption and efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices. The impact of the Cl content in the lead mixed-halide precursors and the employed preparation methods on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs are studied. The highest performance of PSC is obtained for a vapor-treated film containing 2 mol% PbCl2 deposited by spin-coating, showing a 56% increase in photoconversion efficiency compared to the pristine PbI2-based device.
1. Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite materials have recently attained a great deal of attention due to their simple solution-processible preparation, low-cost, strong incident-light harvesting capability, high electron–hole diffusion lengths, high charge carrier mobility, charge accumulation in high density of states and tuneable band gap by chemical management.1–5 Solar cell devices based on organometal halide perovskite materials are a pioneer technology in the solar energy conversion field, exhibiting an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.7%.6 It is well known that a uniform, continuous and pinhole-free perovskite film as the light harvester can guarantee the perovskite solar cell (PSC) functioning. However, preparing such a film is one of the main challenges in the fabrication procedure of PSC devices. Starting from the first reports on PSCs in 2013,6 much research effort has been devoted worldwide into the development of both the fundamental knowledge and technological skills that are needed to improve the quality of perovskite films using different fabrication strategies. The standard two-step (sequential) deposition method is an inexpensive and solution-processible procedure that is most commonly used for providing the perovskite films.7,8 In the two-step method, a perovskite film is formed by sequentially applying PbI2 (typically using spin-coating) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) solutions (using dip- and spin-coatings), followed by baking at 70–150 °C. It is found that the PCE of PSCs made by sequential deposition is highly dependent on the perovskite film morphology which is controlled by the concentration9 and chemical composition10,11 of the perovskite precursors. The presence of a halide-like chloride in the precursor solution may increase the charge diffusion length by up to 10 orders of magnitude,2 provide a uniform film10 and enhance surface coverage.12 A drawback of the standard two-step method is the high growth rate of perovskite thus increasing the surface roughness of the film.13 Meanwhile, various strategies have been suggested by many researchers to improve the fabrication procedures and morphology of perovskite films. Vapor-assisted solution processes (VASPs),14,15 successive spin coating/annealing processes,16 optimization of treatment temperatures,17 ultrasonic-spray methods18 and incorporation of NaCl in precursor solutions19 are some efforts devoted to improve the perovskite quality and, therefore, performance of PSC devices. Amongst them, a VASP can provide a full-coverage perovskite film containing large grains of up to micrometers in size.14 In addition, it is the most promising candidate for the large-scale commercial depositing of perovskite films.17 Despite the progress to date, the efforts devoted to improve the perovskite film quality and the performance of PSCs, it is still highly desirable to develop a way to effectively tailor the chemical composition and morphology of perovskite films. Herein, we propose a modified two-step method to form a uniform perovskite film with large grains and full-coverage of the surface. The detailed process for this method is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In this approach, the commonly used sequential deposition methods (steps 1–3) are combined with a VASP technique (step 4) to improve the morphology of perovskite films. Such an approach is also beneficial for tuning residual PbI2 and keeping it to a suitable level which is demanded for optical absorption, recombination resistance and efficient PSC device operation.

2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Perovskite solar cell device fabrication
The preparation process of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated substrates is explained in more detail in our previous work.20 A TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the cleaned and dried FTO substrates by a spin-casting process using a blocking sol based on titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol. 369 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide was dissolved in 2.53 mL of ethanol, and then, a solution of 2.53 mL of ethanol containing 35 μL of HCl (37% in water) was added dropwise under stirring. An electron blocking compact layer was spin-casted from a filtered stock sol at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by drying at 100 °C for 10 min and firing at 500 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 seconds using a TiO2 commercial paste (Dyesol 30NRD). The obtained film was dried at 100 °C for 20 min and calcined for 30 minutes at 500 °C in order to eliminate the additives from the mesoporous layer. A TiCl4 treatment was then carried out on the TiO2 mesoporous layer by dipping into a solution made of 0.04 M TiCl4 in H2O for 30 minutes at 70 °C then copiously rinsing and finally calcining at 500 °C. As illustrated schematically in Fig. 1, the active perovskite layer was deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold by the following procedures. A 1.2 M PbI2 + PbCl2 solution was prepared using a mixture of DMF and DMSO (Sigma Aldrich) solvents with a 4:1 volume ratio, respectively. The molar ratios of the lead mixed-halides in the solutions were 0, 1, 2, and 4 mol% of PbCl2 with respect to the PbI2 matrix. The solutions were kept under stirring for about 30 min at 90 °C and spin-coated on TiO2 mesoporous films at 6500 rpm for 5 s followed by heating at 100 °C for 20 min. To study the impact of the VASP treatment on the morphology of the perovskite material, five different protocols were pursued for the construction of the films. In the first two approaches, a CH3NH3I (MAI) solution in 2-propanol (8 mg mL−1) was applied on the lead halide films by spin and dip-coating processes as the standard two-step (sequential) deposition methods. These films were considered as the reference PSC devices. In the spin-coating process, 200 μL of the above MAI solution was flushed in a single flow at one of the corners of the lead mixed-halide film and ignited after 120 s of loading time. In the dip-coating process, the samples containing the lead mixed-halide film were dipped in the above MAI solution for 1 min at room temperature and rinsed with 2-propanol for 20 s. The obtained films were cured at 100 °C for 30 min, which made the colour of the samples turn from yellow to dark brown. For the other three approaches, the VASP treatment was carried out on spin- and dip-coated perovskite films by evaporating MAI (at 150 °C for 2 h) and depositing it directly onto the lead mixed-halide film. (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transporting material (HTM) was then deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 36 mg of its powder in 1 mL chlorobenzene using an ultrasonic bath. Moreover, 17.5 mL of a stock solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile (520 mg/1 mL) and 28.8 mL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was added into the spiro-OMeTAD solution to rectify its charge transport characteristics. In order to achieve a fast oxidation of the spiro-OMeTAD layers, they were exposed to an oxygen stream, leading to an enhanced photocurrent of the PSC devices. The device fabrication was carried out under ambient air conditions of 28–32% relative humidity. The PSC devices were finally completed by thermal evaporation of an 80 nm-thick gold layer as the back contact electrode under vacuum.
2.2. Characterization and measurements
XRD measurements of the films were carried out using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro system with a grazing incidence angle configuration, which is operated at 30 kV and 10 mA at 2θ (Cu-Kα) 10–80°, with a step size of 0.02°, and a step time of 2.3° min−1. The absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere detector. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Verios) was used to study the surface morphology of the samples. The current–voltage characteristics of the cells were measured using a solar simulator model no. SS150 with a Nova Sca current/voltage source. The light intensity was calibrated at one Sun (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) using a certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell. The perovskite cell was illuminated and maintained under open-circuit conditions until it reached a steady-state prior to the measurement.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 and 3 show the impact of the chloride content and technological modification methods on the structural characterization of the perovskite films. The peak at 2θ = 24.5° detected for all samples belongs to the TiO2 layer on the FTO substrates. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films revealed a tetragonal crystalline structure with diffraction peaks at 14.1° (1 1 0), 20.2° (1 1 2), 28.4° (2 2 0), 31.9° (3 1 0) and 40.6° (3 3 0).21 A fraction of the film is residual PbI2, as characterized by the peak at 2θ of ∼12.7° corresponding to the (0 0 1) plane. As shown in Fig. 2, residual PbI2 was observed in all three PbCl2 containing perovskite films, deposited on the sample containing 1 mol% PbCl2. However, the intensity ratio of the (1 1 0):(0 0 1) planes was enhanced by increasing the PbCl2 content in the lead mixed-halide precursor solution. This can be explained by the oriented growth of the perovskite structure in the presence of the Cl ions, in agreement to those previously reported in the literature on the Cl-induced preferential orientation of perovskite crystalline grains.22 We can conclude that the incorporation of PbCl2 in perovskite precursors has a beneficial effect on the degree of transformation into crystalline CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite during baking at 100 °C. Surprisingly, by further increasing the PbCl2 concentration up to 4 mol%, the intensity of the (1 1 0) perovskite plane decreased relatively. Therefore, an optimum PbCl2 content is required to improve the oriented growth of perovskite crystals.

 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films containing 2 mol% PbCl2 prepared by spin- and dip-coating methods, followed by VASP treatment on: (a) TiO2 compact and mesoporous layers and (b) the TiO2 compact layer. 
The VASP treatment was employed to tune the residual PbI2 content in the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3, the residual PbI2 is greatly reduced by exposing the samples to MAI vapor, even to contents that cannot be detected by XRD. From the XRD patterns of the perovskite applied on the TiO2 mesoporous layer (Fig. 3a), one can observe that the intensity of the PbI2 peaks (at ∼12.7°) is completely suppressed using the VASP treatment, and correspondingly, the perovskite peaks are enhanced (such as those at ∼14.0°, 20.16°, 28.4°, and 31.9°). However, the peak of the residual PbI2 is still relatively high for the perovskite applied on the TiO2 compact layer without the mesoporous layer (Fig. 3b). Consequently, such a VASP treatment after dipping and spinning of the perovskite precursors is beneficial for converting the residual PbI2 into perovskite. The evidence is that for the samples just treated by VASP, as the second step in the lead mixed-halide layer, the precursors were completely converted to the perovskite material.
The morphology and grain size distribution of the perovskite films with various PbCl2 contents were investigated by FESEM, as shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that the size of the perovskite particles was remarkably affected by the incorporation of PbCl2 in the perovskite precursors, as previously reported.23 The size of the perovskite crystals grown in the pristine film (without PbCl2) is in the range of 200–400 nm, whereas it is in the range of 500–1300 nm for the perovskite crystals grown for the lead mixed-halide films. Moreover, we can observe a uniform growth of perovskite crystals for all layers except for the sample containing 2 mol% PbCl2, which is composed of the bimodal grain sizes containing coarse (more than 1 μm in diameter) and fine (200 nm in diameter) grains. Such a structure may lead to bifunctional properties for the efficient diffusion of photo-excited electrons via increasing the effective mean path of light and good light scattering properties (harvesting) of the perovskite film which in turn may contribute positively to its photovoltaic properties.

The FESEM graphs in Fig. 5 revealed that the introduction of an extra VASP step leads to the improvement of the perovskite morphology, compared to those films made by the spin- or dip-coating methods. Interestingly, for the VASP treated samples, a continuous, flat and full coverage perovskite film with large crystals was obtained which can guarantee the PSC device functioning. Therefore, the VASP treatment has a positive impact not only on tailoring the perovskite film morphology, but also for converting the residual PbI2 into perovskite material.

The VASP as a complementary treatment is a superior technique for preparing highly uniform pinhole free perovskite films, particularly for the spin-coated perovskite films for both planar and mesoporous structures, leading to a crystal size exceeding 2 μm (Fig. 5b and e). The annealing of VASP-treated films at 150 °C for 2 h seems to be an appropriate heat treatment for the TiO2 mesoporous/spin-coated sample (Fig. 5b). The perovskite crystals coalesced via an Ostwald-ripening effect to diminish the surface energy,24 leading to a uniform and smooth polycrystalline perovskite film with equiaxed large crystals. For the TiO2 compact/spin-coated sample, some small grains are located between the large ones (Fig. 5d), suggesting an incomplete growth of the perovskite crystals during heat treatment.
The UV-vis absorbance spectra of the films deposited on the FTO substrates were recorded to better understand the PbCl2 functionality in the optical characteristics of the perovskite films. As presented in Fig. 6a, higher absorbance was obtained for the PbCl2 containing films, compared with that of a pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as the reference sample. For the CH3NH3PbI3 sample, a clear absorption edge appeared at about 780 nm, which is attributed to the formation of the perovskite material with a band gap of 1.59 eV. The absorption onset edge of the perovskite films is not affected in the presence of PbCl2 and it is similar to that of CH3NH3PbI3. Considering that the band-gap variation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is linear with x (i.e., Cl content),25 the presently produced perovskite films with various PbCl2 contents consist of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx phase with x values close to zero. This demonstrates that a considerable Cl content still exists within the film composition and may form a high-chlorine perovskite phase (such as CH3NH3PbCl3) aside from the low-chlorine CH3NH3PbI3−xClx phase. It should be noted that the perovskite film containing 2 mol% PbCl2 showed the highest UV-vis absorbance. This is consistent with the SEM and XRD results, i.e. the highest degree of transformation into crystalline perovskite (XRD, Fig. 2) and is composed of bimodal grain sizes (SEM, Fig. 4c).

As shown in Fig. 6b, the optical absorption is improved by the VASP treatment of the dip- and spin-coated lead mixed-halide perovskite films containing 2 mol% PbCl2. Such high light absorbance is obtained thanks to the presence of perovskite films as an intensive light absorber with a high degree of the crystalline phase (XRD results, Fig. 3a), good surface coverage (SEM graphs, Fig. 5) and high thickness due to the additional VASP treatment. It is clear that better light absorption characteristics leads to the higher current yield in the PSC devices, which is discussed in the following.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of both mesoscopic and planar PSC devices are shown in Fig. 7. In addition, the photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE derived from the J–V curves are given in Tables 1 and 2. CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC as the control device exhibits a JSC of 12.54 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.57 V and a FF of 0.54, resulting in an overall PCE of 4.1%. As shown in Fig. 7a, the incorporation of PbCl2 improved the photovoltaic characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based PSC devices. This result is in agreement with those reported in the literature,26,27 where a mixed-halide in the perovskite composition improved cell efficiency, thanks to higher diffusion lengths, diffusion coefficients, and lifetimes of electron–hole pairs in the lead mixed-halide perovskite absorbers. Moreover, the SEM graphs depict that the size of the perovskite crystals was remarkably increased by the incorporation of PbCl2 within the perovskite precursors (shown in Fig. 4). The less the grain boundary content, the higher the diffusion length. The best performance was obtained for the device containing 2 mol% PbCl2 with a JSC of 17.57 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.86 V, and a FF of 0.42, resulting in an overall PCE of 6.42%. Therefore, the device with an optimal PbCl2 content of 2 mol% showed a 56% higher photoconversion efficiency compared with that of the pristine PbI2-based device. As mentioned earlier, the perovskite microstructure of this device consisted of the bimodal crystal sizes, coarse and fine grains (see Fig. 4c), providing a structure with good light scattering properties which in turn may improve the light harvesting and photovoltaic properties of the PSC device. Comparing Fig. 7a and b it is clear that VASP-treated PSC devices exhibit higher JSC and FF than spin-coated cells, resulting in an efficiency of 8.44%. Such enhancement can be ascribed to the higher light absorption (see Fig. 6b), formation of a uniform and smooth polycrystalline film with equiaxed large crystals (see Fig. 5d) and converting the residual PbI2 into a perovskite material (see Fig. 3a) as a result of VASP treatment.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the role of MAI-vapor-treatment on tailoring the chemical composition and morphology of lead mixed-halide films prepared by dip- and spin-coating methods was evaluated. the VASP as a complementary treatment led to high quality and pinhole-free perovskite films for both planar and mesoporous structures in particular for spin-coated films as a result of the crystal size exceeding 2 μm. XRD analysis demonstrated a full transformation of the precursor to the crystalline perovskite by exposure to MAI vapor. The fabricated PSCs with the optimal 2 mol% PbCl2 exhibited a cell efficiency of over 5.8% and 8.4% for the planar and mesoporous structures, respectively. Since the devices were constructed under ambient conditions with 35% relative humidity, the proposed route might come out to be much more realistic and will open a new concept for the improvement of the power conversion efficiency of PSCs.
