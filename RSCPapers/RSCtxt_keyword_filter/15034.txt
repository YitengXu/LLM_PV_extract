    , Accepted 25th December 2021First published on 28th December 2021AbstractIn spite of the great success of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) in terms of device efficiency mainly owing to the vigorous development of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs), the synergistic effects of the molecular structure and molecular weight (Mw) of PD and PA materials as well as PD–PA pair miscibility on device performance are still unclear and rarely reported. Herein, we introduced PBDB-T and its congener materials (PM6 and PM7) as PDs with comparable Mws and two PYT batches as PAs with different Mws (PYT-M and PYT-H) to deeply investigate the effects of molecular mechanisms on the device efficiency and stability in these six systems. Benefiting from proper PD–PA miscibility owing to the matched molecular structure and Mws, both PBDB-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M systems with suitable phase separation show comparable device efficiencies, which are much better than those of the other four all-polymer systems. Impressively, further investigation demonstrates that the PBDB-T:PYT-H active layer is more stable than the PM6:PYT-M one, resulting from the trade-offs between molecular miscibility and Mw. This work not only employs the synergetic effect of the molecular structure and molecular weight on device efficiency and stability but also provides a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the device performance of all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which consist of p-type and n-type conjugated polymers as electron donor and electron acceptor materials (PDs and PAs), have emerged as a promising alternative to other types of polymer solar cells.1–4 This is because all-PSCs not only have tunable structural, optical, and electrochemical properties, but also possess many superior features that are not readily available in other types of polymer solar cells (PSCs), including enhanced polymer electronic structure tunability, excellent mechanical properties, and thermal stability, and excellent film-forming properties suitable for roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing.5–9 So far, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 16% have been reported in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs based on relevant polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs) as PAs. Although all-PSCs possess the abovementioned merits, many current studies have also shown that the stability issues of all-polymer systems, especially in terms of photostability and thermal stability, generally cannot meet the requirements for practical application.10–14 Therefore, it is very urgent and critical to further expand the pool of the all-polymer systems and to find promising strategies to construct highly efficient and stable all-PSCs.
In particular, the promising device efficiencies of all-PSCs reported in these two years have been mostly obtained by using PBDB-T and its congeners as PDs.15–19 PBDB-T congeners are mainly composed of two building blocks: a 2-alkylthiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit and a 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) unit.20 As compared to PBDB-T, its derivatives PM6 and PM7 (see Fig. 1A), designed by introducing two more fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms into the conjugated side chains of BDT units, show the down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, which can improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC) in devices.21 In addition, as the chlorine–carbon bond shows a large dipole moment at the conjugated side groups compared to the fluorine–carbon bond, the electron-withdrawing effect of PM7 was enhanced, resulting in a deeper HOMO energy level than that of PM6.22,23 It is worth noting that, with the same fullerene acceptor PC71BM, BHJ devices based on PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7 afforded PCEs of 8.10%,24 8.64%,25 and 7.28%,26 respectively. Of particular note is that various molecular structures of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with narrow bandgaps generally result in differentiated photovoltaic performance when blended with PBDB-T congeners due to different molecular compatibilities and electrostatic interactions of donor and acceptor materials.27–29 For instance, Li et al. reported efficient PSCs based on the absorption complementary pairs of PBDB-T series polymers (PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7) and an asymmetrical acceptor IDT6-CN-M, which achieved a PCE of 11.4% for PBDB-T:IDT6-CN-M, 13.3% for PM6:IDT6-CN-M and 13.3% for PM7:IDT6-CN-M.30 In short, recent advances in the morphological understanding of PSCs based on PBDB-T congeners as donors and fullerene derivatives and NFAs as acceptors are discussed systematically for constructing the efficient structure–property relationships.21,28,30 Thus, in the next-phase study, matching appropriate PD materials will provide new challenges and opportunities to further modify and evaluate the photovoltaic performance of new PAs.

Apart from the clear descriptions of structure–property relationships,31,32 simultaneously achieving a highly efficient and stable BHJ microstructure is also particularly challenging for all-polymer systems because the reduced entropic contributions significantly suppress donor–acceptor (PD–PA) pair miscibility.6,33–35 Although modifying film processing technologies (e.g. binary solvent mixtures and solid additives) to improve the PD–PA pair miscibility is a promising strategy, such approaches are highly empirical and system dependent, often providing limited performance benefits. In contrast, tuning the molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer (PD and/or PA) should in principle provide a more general device optimization strategy employed in all-polymer systems36–38 because many studies have demonstrated that modifying the molecular mass of polymer materials has an enormous impact on the whole process of converting solar light into electricity.7,19,38–41 Moreover, the effects of the molecular mass parameter on relevant stability issues is also remarkable.42 Note that the rational selection of both PD and PA materials with suitable Mws is fragile, mainly due to a poor understanding of the effects of molecular mechanisms on the resulting blend physical properties, polymer–polymer interactions, and blend phase separation as well as the differences in device performance (including efficiency and stability). Of particular note is that the practical understanding of guiding the suitable adjustment of Mw values and the rational selection of PD–PA pairs has not been established so far in all-polymer systems.
Based on the abovementioned points, to identify the key affecting factors of molecular mechanisms and explore the material matching rules in all-PSCs, we characterized the PD–PA pair miscibility, active layer morphology, relevant physical dynamics, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of all-PSCs based on PBDB-T and its derivatives (PM6 and PM7) as PDs, and two PYT batches with different Mws (PYT-M with a medium Mw and PYT-H with a high Mw) as PAs (Fig. 1A). The thermodynamic amorphous–amorphous interaction parameters (χ) of these six active layers were estimated by contact angle measurements, and their BHJ blend microstructures were further investigated by different morphology characterization techniques. In addition, to better understand the corresponding physical mechanisms in these all-polymer systems, we systematically studied the exciton dynamics, charge generation, transport, and collection processes by employing steady-state and transient spectroscopic techniques in these all-polymer systems. Besides, we found that both PDBD-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M systems exhibited promising PCEs of over 14%, which is higher than those of the other four all-polymer systems, but the differences in the thermal stability and photostability stability of these two systems are significant. These results strongly allowed us to construct the miscibility–morphology–function relations, and preliminarily shed light on the relevant molecular mechanisms of trade-offs between the device efficiency and stability in all-PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
Polymer characterization and optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 1A, PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 polymers were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. The relevant weight-average molecular weight (MW) and polydispersity index (PDI) of three PD materials were determined to be 97.6 kg mol−1 and 1.87 for PBDB-T, 97.7 kg mol−1 and 2.15 for PM6, and 93.3 kg mol−1 and 2.37 for PM7, respectively. In addition, details of the reaction conditions and methods for the synthesis of PYT PAs with various Mws are described in the literature.12,19 PYT batches with different Mw values (PYT-M with a Mw of 20.5 kg mol−1 and a PDI of 1.67, and PYT-H with a Mw of 38.3 kg mol−1 and a PDI of 1.86; Table S1, ESI†) were prepared using the stoichiometric ratio of comonomers and extending the reaction time from 2 hours for PYT-M to 4 hours for PYT-H. The relevant schematic energy level alignments of the corresponding components of all-PSCs investigated in this work are depicted in Fig. 1B. The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the PYTs are approximately −5.69 and −3.92 eV, respectively, displaying little variation for the range of Mws (20.5–38.3 kg mol−1). Referring to the relevant literature,21–23,30 we have also given the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the investigated PDs, including PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7, yielding sufficiently large HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO offsets when paring with PYTs, to ensure efficient exciton dissociation. Additionally, Fig. 1C presents the normalized absorption spectra of the relevant neat films. All the investigated PDs exhibit a maximum absorption peak at approximately 612 nm and similar absorption edges (λedges) and obvious shoulder peaks, indicating the strong π–π stacking behaviors in the solid state. Interestingly, the thin-film optical spectra of PYT show minimal Mw dependence (PYT-M: λmax ≈ 815 nm and λedge ≈ 932 nm; PYT-H: λmax ≈ 815 nm and λedge ≈ 932 nm, Table S1, ESI†).
Photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs
The abovementioned three PDs (PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7) and two PAs (PYT-M and PYT-H) were selected for performance evaluation via a 3 × 2 all-PSC characterization/performance optimization matrix. These devices were conducted by using a conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/all-polymer active layer/poly(9,9-bis[6(N,N,N trimethylammonium)hexyl]fluorene-alt-co-1,4-phenylene-bromide) (PFN-Br)/Ag. The corresponding active layers were processed by chloroform solvent with a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1. The details of the all-polymer device processing approaches are provided in the Experimental Section (ESI† online). All active layers were optimized to be ∼100 nm thick for device performance comparison.
Their typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves are illustrated in Fig. 2A and B, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. For the PYT-M batch, the optimized all-PSC devices showed the PCEs of 12.29% for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 14.22% for PM6:PYT-M, and 8.37% for PM7:PYT-M (Fig. 2A), respectively. As compared to the PM7:PYT-M system, both PBDB-T:PYT-M and PM6:PYT-M show higher JSC and FF values, even though their VOC values are lower than that of the PM7:PYT-M system. Notably, due to the lower HOMO energy level of PM6 as compared to PBDB-T, the PM6:PYT-M system showed a higher VOC,43 resulting in an increased PCE. Interestingly, for the PYT-H batch, PBDB-T:PYT-H exhibited a better PCE of 14.29% than PM6:PYT-H (9.91%) and PM7:PYT-H (5.02%) systems (Fig. 2B), resulting from the better JSC and FF values (Table 1). Notably, the changing trend of VOC in PYT-H-based all-PSCs is similar to that of the PYT-M-based devices as discussed above. Of particular note is that PM7 and PYT did not match well, thus resulting in inferior device efficiencies (8.37% for PM7:PYT-M and 5.02% for PM7:PYT-M, Table 1). A comparison of the all-PSC performance parameters obtained for all possible combinations of PDs (PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7) and PAs (PYT-M and PYT-H) reveals dramatic variations in PCEs, ranging from 5.02% for PM7:PYT-H to 14.22% for PM6:PYT-M and 14.29% for PBDB-T:PYT-H. Besides, to verify the reliability of device performance, statistical photovoltaic metrics and PCE histogram were obtained from these all-PSCs, as depicted in Fig. 2C for the PYT-M-based devices and in Fig. 2D for the PYT-H-based devices. The observed trends are further exemplified by comparing JSC from J–V data (Table 1) and integrated JSC values calculated from the external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE, Fig. 2E and F) of these six all-polymer systems. Thus, the observed effects of the molecular structure and Mw on all-PSC performance are dramatic. In particular, the investigated JSC and FF trends strongly indicate a substantial dependence on the selections of PD–PA pairs.

Physical mechanisms of relevant all-PSCs
To better understand the influence of PD–PA miscibility on device performance, we studied the exciton dynamics, charge generation, transport, and collection processes in these six all-polymer systems by employing steady-state and transient spectroscopic techniques. We first studied the charge photo-generation of relevant devices by examining the photocurrent at the saturation point where the internal field is large enough to sweep out all carriers to the electrodes prior to recombination.44 The trend of the photocurrent density (Jph), obtained as the difference between the current under one sun illumination and that flowing in the dark, is plotted in Fig. 3A and Bversus the effective voltage (Veff, Veff = V0 − V; here V0 is the compensation voltage at which Jph is zero, and V is the externally applied voltage) for the PYT-M- and PYT-H-based devices, respectively. By calculating the specific values of Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum output power conditions, the efficiency of exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll) were determined to be 95.86%/85.48% for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 96.35%/85.81% for PM6:PYT-M, and 93.99%/68.97% for PM7:PYT-M. The higher Pdiss and Pcoll of the PM6:PYT-M system as compared to the other two devices indicate more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the corresponding device, supported by its high EQE (Fig. 2E). In addition, for the PYT-H-based all-polymer systems, the Pdiss and Pcoll values were calculated to be 97.02%/87.48% for PBDB-T:PYT-H, 93.18%/72.49% for PM6:PYT-H, and 62.21%/39.62% for PM7:PYT-H, respectively, indicating that PBDB-T:PYT-H exhibits the best exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties among these three systems. In particular, unlike PBDB-T:PYT and PM6:PYT systems, voltage-dependent behaviors of Jph were obviously observed for the PM7:PYT devices, illustrating the high dependence of the electric field on the charge carrier transport, which is consistent with the reduction in JSC and FF.45

Measurement of VOCversus light intensity for the devices based on (C) PYT-M and (D) PYT-H as acceptors. Charge carrier lifetime τ, obtained from TPV measurements of the devices based on (E) PYT-M and (F) PYT-H as acceptors, as a function of charge density n, calculated from CE measurements of the corresponding devices under VOC conditions (from 0.15 to 2.50 suns). The dashed lines represent linear fits of the data. 
We further measured the J–V curves under different light intensities (Plight), and the Jsc and VOC dependence on Plight were obtained (ESI,† Fig. S1 and Fig. 3C and D). The relationship between the JSC and Plight can be interpreted based on the formula, JSC ∝ Pαlight,46 in which the exponential factor α denotes the degree of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the similar α values of PBDB-T- and PM6-based devices close to unity indicate negligible bimolecular recombination during sweep-out in the corresponding devices. In contrast, the α values of PM7-based devices are slightly lower than those of the above-mentioned all-PSCs based on PDBD-T and PM6 as donors, indicating that the bimolecular recombination losses are more severe in the PM7-based all-polymer systems. Additionally, the relationship of the VOC–ln(Plight) curves can be used to directly gain insight into the influence of trap-assisted recombination versus second-order recombination in the devices.44 When the slope S is larger than kT/q (where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature of the device, and q is the elementary charge), monomolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination are involved.44 As shown in Fig. 3C, the PM6:PYT-M blend shows a small slope of 1.12kT/q, while PBDB-T:PYT-M and PM7:PYT-M blends exhibit relatively larger slopes of 1.20kT/q and 1.86kT/q, respectively. This result indicates that the PM6:PYT-M system possesses a lower trap-assisted recombination loss as compared with the other two all-polymer systems based on PYT-M as the acceptor.47Fig. 3D further exhibits the VOC–ln(Plight) relationship for the PYT-H-based all-polymer systems at various light intensities. Obviously, PBDB-T:PYT-H shows a smaller slope of 1.01kT/q as compared to the PM6:PYT-H (1.28kT/q) and PM7:PYT-H (1.97kT/q). This result also suggests that PBDB-T:PYT-H did not suffer from serious trap-assisted recombination in devices. It is worth noting that both PM7:PYT-M and PM7:PYT-H devices showed a stronger dependency of VOC on Plight, illustrating that both systems suffered from significant trap-assisted recombination in their blends owing to their small phase domain sizes and poor PD–PA miscibility which will be discussed below.
To directly figure out the degree of carrier recombination in these systems, we combined the transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction (CE) techniques to yield the charge carrier lifetime τ (Fig. S2, ESI†) as a function of charge carrier density n (Fig. S3, ESI†) under open-circuit conditions, τ(n). Here, a non-geminate recombination R (R = λ + 1) can be calculated via the equation τ = τ0(n0/n)λ,12 where τ0 and n0 are constants and λ is the so-called recombination exponent. As shown in Fig. 3E and F, the fitted R values are 2.10 for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 2.06 for PM6:PYT-M, and 2.23 for PM7:PYT-M, 2.02 for PBDB-T:PYT-H, 2.16 for PM6:PYT-H, and 2.40 for PM7:PYT-H, respectively. Note that the recombination value is correlated with exciton dissociation probability and the spatial uniform charge carrier distributions through the active layer.19 The lower R values of PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H as compared to the other four systems imply that both PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H systems can form better phase separation and good PD–PA miscibility to inhibit charge recombination in their blends.
Film morphology of all-polymer systems
The significant difference in the device performance of these six systems enabled us to further understand the morphological origins from the viewpoints of mixing thermodynamics and film solidification kinetics, which are the pivotal factors that impact the blend morphology and physical dynamics and thus determine the device efficiencies of all-PSCs. Herein, morphological characterization of relevant active layers was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS), grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and surface energy measurements. Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†) show the surface topography images of the PYT-M-based and PYT-H-based all-polymer blends, respectively. It can be seen that the PYT-M-based systems exhibit smooth surfaces with low root mean square (RMS) roughness. Moreover, the PM6:PYT-M blend can form strong phase separation with a well-defined interpenetrating network. Such morphologies are known to introduce suitably connected polymer networks, thus improving charge separation and transport properties.38 Notably, the PYT-H-based blends show slightly larger RMS values as compared to the PYT-M-based active layers (Fig. 4B and Fig. S5, ESI†), which can be attributed to the aggregation behaviors of high-Mw polymers.

Since AFM has limitations in resolving the blend microstructures, 2D GIWAXS were further employed to define morphological properties such as local crystallinity and domain size. Fig. 4A presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the PDs and PAs neat films and their blend films. In addition, relevant scattering profiles of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) for the neat films are provided in Fig. S6 (ESI†). All the donor polymers PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 show preferential face-on orientation with almost similar lamellar peaks at qr ∼ 0.297 Å−1 (d-spacing ∼ 21.16 Å). The calculated crystallite coherence lengths (CCL) values are 29.92 Å for PBDB-T, 27.32 Å for PM6, and 14.28 Å for PM7 in the OOP direction, respectively, as summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). In addition, for the PYT neat films, both PYT batches adopt a preferential face-on orientation showing more prominent (010) diffraction peaks located at ∼1.63 Å-1 aligned along the qz direction. The CCL values of these two PYT batches (Table S2, ESI†) are 18.76 Å for PYT-M, and 19.45 Å for PYT-H, respectively. Indeed, the peak intensity gradually increased with increasing Mw value, suggesting that PYT-H had a stronger crystalline order as compared to PYT-M (Fig. 4A). This result reveals that the different Mw values of PYT can fine-tune the molecular orientation properties, possibly resulting in a complex three-dimensional BHJ morphology,48,49 as discussed below.
All of the blend films preferred an obvious face-on orientation relative to the substrate, supported by the prominent (010) in the OOP direction. And the scattering profiles of IP and OOP for the corresponding blend films are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The CCL values extracted from the scattering profiles of IP and OOP directions (Fig. S7A, ESI†) were 18.70 Å for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 19.03 Å for PM6:PYT-M and 18.31 Å for PM7:PYT-M, respectively. It is noted that the PM6:PYT-M blend film exhibited a more ordered π–π stacking with much higher CCL values resulting in an excellent device performance. While the PYT-H batch matched with different PDs, the corresponding blends have also produced a similar trend, as presented in Fig. 4B and Table S3 (ESI†). The CCL values were 19.33 Å for PBDB-T:PYT-H, 20.47 Å for PM6:PYT-H and 19.04 Å for PM7:PYT-H, respectively. In addition, the trend of differentiation of CCL values is consistent with the abovementioned RMS values (Fig. 4B). It is worth noting that the π–π stacking distance and coherence length results imply the exciton dissociation and charge transport characteristics of BHJ blends.50 According to the abovementioned photovoltaic performance data, PBDB-T:PYT-H with a medium CCL value (19.33 Å) compared to PM6:PYT-H and PM7:PYT-H shows a higher PCE of 14.29%. However, it was also found that PM6:PYT-M with a higher CCL value (19.03 Å) compared to PBDB-T:PYT-M and PM7:PYT-M possesses a PCE of 14.22%, which is much higher than those of the other two PYT-M-based all-polymer systems. Thus, optimum photovoltaic performance is achieved in blends of adjusting Mws of PAs matching with different PDs.
Here we also conducted the GISAXS measurements, which offer a quantitative understanding of the inner film phase-separation structure characteristics of the corresponding active layers. As depicted in Fig. 4C and D, the 1D GISAXS profiles of all blend films were dominated by a single lognormal peak. The data are fitted with the effective surface approximation model within the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger model.51 For the PYT-M-based all-polymer systems, the domain sizes of clustered blends phase 2Rgblends are approximately 20.4 nm for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 31.2 nm for PM6:PYT-M and 16.2 nm for PM7:PYT-M, respectively (Fig. 4C). In addition, when PBDB-T congeners match with PYT-H the corresponding blend films show the domain sizes of 24.0 nm for PBDB-T:PYT-H, 32.0 nm for PM6:PYT-H and 21.8 nm for PM7:PYT-H, respectively (Fig. 4D). Notably, among these six blend systems, the domain sizes of PM6-based blends are slightly larger than those of PBDB-T- and PM7-based blends. Moreover, whether it is matched with PYT-M or PYT-H, the trend of the phase domain is similar, but the phase domain sizes of the PYT-H-based systems are slightly larger than those of PYT-M-based systems, probably due to the higher molecular weight of PYT-H materials. Note that the small domain sizes in the PM7:PYT blends can seriously lead to obvious regions of charge trapping, poor charge separation process, which significantly influence the JSC and FF values of the PM7:PYT devices as discussed above. Thus, suitably mixed domains in all-polymer systems are needed to provide enough contacts between the donor and the acceptor materials for effective exciton dissociation.
To further reveal the fundamental factors dominating the domain size characteristics, thermodynamic molecular interactions between PBDB-T congeners and PYT with different Mws were investigated. The lower Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) value, which is known as a fundamental metric of degree of mixing, indicates better miscibility between donors and acceptors, which often leads to lower domain purity.52,53 Herein, the χ values, between donor and acceptors, are estimated from the experimentally measured contact angles (using water and ethylene glycol, Fig. S8, ESI†). The calculated χ values are 0.018 for PBDB-T:PYT-M, 0.023 for PM6:PYT-M, and 0.011 for PM7:PYT-M, respectively. When PBDB-T congeners match with PYT-H, the χ values are 0.029 for PBDB-T:PYT-H, 0.035 for PM6:PYT-H and 0.019 for PM7:PYT-H, respectively. Interestingly, whether PBDB-T congeners match with the PYT-M or PYT-H polymer acceptor, the relative χ values of these blend systems follow the similar order of PM6 > PBDB-T > PM7. In addition, for the same donor materials, the relative χ values of the PYT-H were larger than that of PYT-M, probably due to the Mw differences. Although the χ values of PBDB-T congeners show similar trends when matched with PYT-M and PYT-H, there is no doubt that PAs with different Mws lead to different phase separation behaviors between two components and thus result in a differentiated device performance. Notably, according to the miscibility-function model reported in the literature,53,54 the χ parameters of PM7:PYT-M and PM7:PYT-H are slightly lower than those of the corresponding PBDB-T- and PM6-based all-polymer systems (Fig. 5A–C). The low χ values generally may lead to small domain sizes and poor molecular packing in the PM7-based blends, which are in good agreement with the morphological characteristics presented in Fig. 4. In contrast, the middle χ values should be the driving force for the formation of the appropriate domains sizes in PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H blend films. Moreover, the PM6:PYT-H system with the highest χ (0.035) as compared with the other five systems tends to evolve spontaneously into its thermodynamic equilibrium state and thus leads to spontaneous phase separation in the solid state. Importantly, the spontaneous phase separation of the PM6:PYT-H blend probably forms over-purified domains, which result in the composition of the amorphous mixed-phase away from the percolation threshold and the relatively low PCE (9.91%).55,56

Overall, having fully understood the PD–PA pair miscibility and molecular crystallinity of the PBDB-T congeners:PYT blend films by the GIWAXS, GISAXS, AFM and contact angle characterization, it is possible now to illustrate the corresponding schematic morphologies, as depicted in Fig. 5D. As demonstrated in the PBDB-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M systems, suitable miscibility between donors and acceptors is conducive to the adjustment of the blend morphology by a rational design rule, achieving high photovoltaic performance in all-PSCs. It is worth noting that the highest χ like PM6:PYT-H often has enough driving force for the formation of oversized and excessively pure domains, resulting in an inferior blend morphology. Conversely, low χ systems, such as PM7:PYT, also need to be avoided, as it will result in insufficient phase separation that usually leads to increased bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted carrier recombination as discussed above.
TAS measurements of all-polymer blends
Based on the abovementioned device performance (Fig. 2), physical mechanisms (Fig. 3), morphological characteristics (Fig. 4), and χ parameters (Fig. 5A–C), relevant self-consistent blend morphologies of these six all-polymer systems can be depicted in Fig. 5D. These results further drive us to conduct femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) for evaluating the charge transfer process from PYT to PBDB-T congeners in detail. Here, we selectively excited acceptors at 750 nm (below 10 μJ cm−2) to probe the hole transfer process. The TA spectra of pure acceptors (PYT-M and PYT-H) are presented in Fig. S9 (ESI†), and the TA spectra of their blends are provided in Fig. S10 (ESI†) (PYT-M-based blends) and S11 (ESI†) (PYT-H-based blends), respectively. Compared to the pure acceptor film, a new ground state bleaching (GSB) arose at around 550–650 nm in the first few picoseconds corresponding to the signal of PBDB-T congeners (PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7), indicating the hole transfer processes from PYT to donors. As depicted in Fig. 6 and Table S4 (ESI†), hole transfer process were extracted and fitted by a biexponential function: i = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), where as we pointed out the biphasic hole transfer process in previous literature,6,57,58τ1 represents the ultrafast charge transfer time at the interfaces and τ2 represents the exciton diffusion time toward interfaces before hole transfer, as well as A1 and A2 corresponding to their proportions, respectively.

(I) Performance parameters for A1 and A2 of the PBDB-T and its congeners:PYT films. 
Among the PYT-M-based all-polymer systems (Fig. 6A–C and G), the exciton diffusion mediated hole transfer process (A2) account for 39.8%, 41.8% and 23.2% on PBDB-T:PYT-M, PM6:PYT-M and PM7:PYT-M, respectively. These results indicate that the PM6-based blend is beneficial for the formation of relatively large pure domains, in good agreement with the abovementioned blend morphology characterization studies. However, the PM7:PYT-M blend exhibits a much more interfacial charge transfer process (A1 = 76.9%) than the exciton diffusion mediated process (A2 = 23.2%), suggesting a poor phase separation and transport pathway owing to the morphology mismatch and small polymer miscibility between PM7 and PYT-M, which also agrees well with the morphological characteristics (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, PYT-H-based systems also show a similar trend, implying that the Mw dependence of PYT on the charge transfer process is negligible. Besides, as shown in Fig. 6D–F and H, the interfacial charge transfer process (A1 = 57.5%) of the PBDB-T:PYT-H blend system is much larger than the exciton diffusion mediated process (A2 = 42.5%), which indicates that the better PD–PA phase separation and miscibility result in building a superhighway for fast charge transport. Overall, among these six all-polymer systems, PBDB-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M possess high hole transfer and suitable domain purity, leading to outstanding JSC, FF, and thus, high PCE, as we saw in the abovementioned discussions.
Thermal and photostability stabilities of relevant systems
Combining with the photovoltaic performance results of these six all-polymer systems as well as the abovementioned physical and morphological characterization studies, we can find that the synergistic strategy of PD–PA miscibility and Mw factors provides a good approach to optimize the blend microstructure for efficient exciton separation, charge transportation and extraction, and thus achieve high-performance all-PSCs. This finding has further promoted our research on thermal and photostability stabilities of PBDB-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M, which show comparable device efficiencies (14.22% and 14.29%, respectively), in order to deeply understand how to modify the molecular engineering and molecular weight parameters of polymers to synergistically improve the device efficiency and stability. The relevant test conditions of these two types of stability issues are described in the Experimental Section (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 7A, as compared to the PM6:PYT-M devices tested in a nitrogen glovebox at 85 °C on a hotplate, PBDB-T:PYT-H devices exhibited slightly better thermal stability, resulting from the lower attenuation of JSC and FF (Fig. S12, ESI†). Since the structural ordering of photovoltaic materials is associated with the intensity of the lowest energy peak of UV-vis spectra, we further measured the absorption spectra of these two blends for different thermal annealing times (Fig. S13, ESI†), and found that there was no significant change of absorption intensities of the blend films without and with thermal annealing for 408 hours. Despite this, more clear evidence was found in the PL spectra. Because the difference thermal stability can be confirmed by the change in PL intensity, i.e., ΔI = (It − I0)/I0, where I0 and It are the PL intensities before and after annealing for t hours, respectively.59 As presented in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the PM6:PYT-M film showed significant light-induced losses to 6.02% within 408 hours, while the PBDB-T:PYT-H film lost 3.04% of its initial efficiency over the same period. Enhanced molecular ordering explains the general degradation pattern observed,59 suggesting that PBDB-T:PYT-H is more thermally stable due to its lower molecular aggregation at 85 °C as compared to the PM6:PYT-M.

Additionally, we explored the light-soaking stability of these two all-PSCs measured under one sun illumination at room temperature in a nitrogen glovebox for 408 hours. As exhibited in Fig. 7B, PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H devices showed a significant light-induced decrease to 73.7% and 80.1% within 408 hours, respectively. Again, light-induced degradation hugely influences the JSC and FF parameters (Fig. S15, ESI†). In order to explain the reason for light-induced degradation, PL spectra (Fig. S16, ESI†) were also used to study the origin of the light instability. After continuous light-soaking, the change in the PL intensity of the PM6:PYT-M film showed significant light-induced losses to 14.35% within 408 hours, while the PBDB-T:PYT-H film lost 12.58% of its initial efficiency over the same period. In addition, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) of hole-only or electron-only devices based on PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H without and with light-soaking for 408 hours was investigated, as shown in Fig. S17 and S18 (ESI†), respectively. As summarized in Table S5 (ESI†), these results suggest that the device performance degradation of PM6:PYT-M and PBDB-T:PYT-H all-PSCs probably originates from the reduced hole and electron mobilities.60 Besides, it can be seen that the recombination order (R) slightly increased from 2.06 for the fresh devices (Fig. 3E) to 2.18 for the corresponding PM6:PYT-M device (Fig. S19, data were extracted from Fig. S20 and S21, ESI†) with light-soaking treatment for 408 hours. In contrast, the R value of PBDB-T:PYT-H devices increased from 2.02 for the fresh devices (Fig. 3F) to 2.11 for the aged devices (Table S5, ESI†). Increased recombination order in PSCs can be linked to trap-assisted recombination and/or reduced carrier mobilities.
Overall, all these supplement characterization studies highlight that the PBDB-T:PYT-H system has a more stable blend microstructure than the PM6:PYT-M system regardless of whether it is under high-temperature conditions or under long-term light-soaking conditions, even though the PBDB-T:PYT-H system possesses a slightly higher χ value. Based upon the above discussions, we hypothesized that the differences in the thermal stability and photostability of these two systems might be not only related to the PD–PA miscibility but also associated with the Mw of PYT as well as its intermolecular interactions.42 Indeed, PYT with a higher Mw (PYT-H) requires more external energy to rearrange and/or re-aggregate in its blends, which are directly related to the morphology evolution, and thus shows a better thermodynamically stable aggregate state.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we introduced PBDB-T and its congener materials (PM6 and PM7) as PDs and two PYT batches with different Mws (PYT-M and PYT-H) as PAs to construct six all-polymer systems, including PBDB-T:PYT-M, PM6:PYT-M, PM7:PYT-M, PBDB-T:PYT-H, PM6:PYT-H, and PM7:PYT-H. The synergistic effects of the molecular structure and Mw of PD and PA materials, as well as PD–PA pair miscibility on device efficiency, were investigated. As compared to the other four all-polymer systems, both PBDB-T:PYT-H and PM6:PYT-M systems show an improved optical-to-electrical conversion process demonstrated by relevant steady-state and transient spectroscopic techniques and suitable blend morphology investigated by AFM, GIWAXS, and GISAXS, which are associated with the thermodynamic molecular interactions between PBDB-T congeners and PYT with different Mws. Consequently, relevant self-consistent blend morphologies, further demonstrated by the fs-TAS measurements of these six all-polymer systems, can be depicted effectively. Importantly, relevant stability investigations in terms of thermal stability and photostability reveal that the blend microstructure of the PBDB-T:PYT-H system is much more stable than that of the PM6:PYT-M system, probably resulting from its stronger intermolecular interactions and higher Mw of PYT-H. This work provides an in-depth insight into the rational selection of the PDs–PAs pair and fine-tuning of the active layer morphology and could pave the way toward constructing a highly efficient and stable blend microstructure, an important consideration for possible commercial fabrication of all-PSCs.
