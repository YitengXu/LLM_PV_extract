First published on 17th April 2007AbstractThis chapter reviews the literature reported during 2006 on fullerenes chemistry including fullerene production and separation, organic reactions, organometallic and endohedral derivatives together with theoretical studies and possible applications of fullerene and its derivatives.
Highlights
Highlights of the year include the biological activity for a novel fullerene-acrylamide copolymer, which has been found to be water soluble and to exhibit antitumour activity against bone tumour cells in vitro.1 Another significant highlight was the preparation, separation and structural characterizations of a stable unconventional C64H4 fulleride, synthesised by introducing methane in the fullerene production using an arc-discharge method.2
1. Production, separation and properties of fullerenes
An overview of the production and use of nanomaterials as well as the research and development trends at many institutions, particularly in the UK has been presented.3 Basic chemical properties of different carbon materials as well as selected synthesis methods have been reviewed.4 One-dimensional fullerene nanostructures with well-defined morphology have been prepared by a controllable growth method which is a step toward broader applications of fullerene-related materials in nanoscience and nanotechnology.5 Preparation, partial purification, and multiple functionalization and solubilisation of multilayer fullerene CNO have been reported, which represents the most comprehensive description of CNO’s functionalization and characterization to date.6 Up to one centimetre in size of C60 fullerites have been synthesized in large scale and in a cost effective way by ultrasound induced charging of C60 over KBr surfaces in C60/benzene solution at room temperature in the absence of ultrahigh vacuum.7 Azafullerene (C59N) and encapsulated fullerene (N@C60) have been produced by implanting nitrogen ions into C60 thin films on a substrate immersed in an electron cyclotron resonance plasma under a mirror magnetic field.8
The genotoxicity data for stable colloidal dispersions of C60 fullerenes in water has been reported.9 Preclinical studies on the safety of fullerene upon acute oral administration and evaluation for mutagenesis, showed that fullerenes are not of high toxicological significance.10 It has been found that the highly purified fullerenes do not stimulate the release of nitrogen monoxide by murine macrophage cells in culture, their uptake by human macrophage cells is very low, and they possess a very low toxicity against human macrophage cells.11
The physical and mechanical properties of a C60 fullerene have been investigated under high pressure-high temperature conditions using a designer Diamond Anvil Cell.12 A comparative study of various sorbent materials for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers preconcentration revealed C60 fullerene to be the best choice in terms of sensitivity, precision, selectivity and reusability.13 The thermal stability studies for free pure C60, C60-alkali and C60-alkaline-earth metal compound clusters, showed that the decay temperature of small (C60)⩽6 clusters is increased from below 400 K to as high as 1780 K by adding barium or potassium to the clusters.14 Various metastable phases of C60 crystals, including tubes, spheres, open-ended hollow columns, stars, branches, and trees have been found by screening of C60 crystallization using a simple liquid/liquid interfacial precipitation method. These findings suggest an urgent need to screen C60 crystallization for the development of fullerene C60 drugs.15 High purity single crystal C60 rods with uniform dimensions have been obtained via a rapid synthesis route and their optical and charge transport properties have been investigated. These fullerene structures are expected to be promising materials for nanoelectronic devices including thin film organic solar cells and photodetectors.16 An efficient, rapid and non-chromatographic method for the large-scale isolation of C60 from a fullerene extract has been developed using the differences in the properties of brominated C60 and C70.17 Among the reported stationary phases with pyrene ligands, the new stationary phase of pyrenebutyric acid-modified magnesia-zirconia (PYB-F-(ZrO2-MgO)) has been found to exhibit the best selectivity for the separation of C60 and C70 fullerenes using HPLC technique.18
2. Chemistry of the fullerenes
2.1 Organic chemistry

2.1.1 Addition reactions. 
A range of fullerene additions including the formation of hydrides, hydroxides, halides, oxides, alkyl- and aryl-fullerenes, and cycloadducts which reveal a number of important properties of fullerenes have been reviewed.19 An overview of the work on regio- and, in the occurrence, stereo-selective tether-directed remote functionalization of fullerenes from 1994 up to date has been presented.20 The most successful strategies for dissolving fullerenes in polar solvents by means of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to C60 have been described.21 The recent progress in the synthesis of three, five, six and seven heterocyclic-fused C60 fullerene derivatives via the cycloaddition reactions have been reviewed.22 The spectroscopic characterisation together with the nonlinear optical properties of a new series of fulleropyrrolidine derivatives obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to C60 have been studied.23 Soluble trialkoxysilyl fulleropyrrolidines (alkoxy = methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, and isopropoxy) have been prepared, characterised and their hydrolysis rate constant been measured with 1H NMR spectroscopy.24 Synthesis and properties of a series of fulleropyrrolidines bearing stable nitroxide free radical moieties covalently linked to the C60 fullerene cage have been described; the photogenerated quartet and quintet high spin species, obtained from the spin coupling of the fullerene triplet with the nitroxide spins, have been observed for the first time at room temperature.25N-Methyl-2-(4-N,N-diphenylminophenyl)fulleropyrrolidine and N-methyl-2-(4-di-p-tolylaminophenyl)fulleropyrrolidine have been synthesized via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions under microwave irradiation and their molecular structures, characterization and theoretical aspects of their existence have been reported.26 Two new fullerodendrimers, with two and four ferrocene units on their periphery, have been synthesized by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions between the corresponding azomethine ylides and C60. These new compounds have been studied by using cyclic voltammetry and uv-vis spectroscopy.27 Stable and soluble N-unsubstituted and N-arylated fulleropyrrolidines have been prepared from the reactions of C60, glycine or its N-arylated derivatives, and aliphatic aldehydes or ketones as new useful building blocks for further preparation of more functionalised C60 derivatives.28
The composite obtained from the insertion of a water-soluble bisadduct fulleropyrrolidine derivative into the interlayer space of three layered clays has been described and characterized by spectroscopic techniques and complemented by computer simulations. These findings open new perspectives for the design and construction of novel C60-based organic/clay hybrid materials.29 Novel eight fullerene derivatives of [60]fulleropyrrolidine N-oxides have been synthesised and characterized spectroscopically, especially with 15N NMR spectroscopy.30
The first example of a systematic study on tether-directed selective synthesis of C60 fulleropyrrolidine bisadducts has been achieved by using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of tethered bis-azomethine ylides.31 [60] and [70]fullerene-coumarin dyads have been prepared via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azomethine ylides or by a cyclopropanation reaction of fullerenes with malonate derivatives. The fluorescence properties of these derivatives have showed an efficient dipole–dipole resonance energy transfer from the coumarin moiety to the fullerene moiety.32 Using the same strategy liquid-crystalline fullerodendrimers have been produced from the reaction of aldehyde-based poly(benzyl ether) dendrimers and sarcosine to C60 fullerene.33 C60 derivatives incorporating one or two 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl groups have been synthesized and their antioxidant activity have been determined.34 Pyrazolino[60]fullerenes have been obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions and their electrochemical and photochemical properties suggest that they are good candidates for incorporation into new donor–acceptor assemblies.35
Enantiomerically pure bisadducts of C70 have been synthesised by highly diastereoselective transformations of bismalonates incorporating optically pure Troger base tethers and optically active tetrakisadducts of C70 have been prepared by two sequential chiral-spacer-controlled remote functionalizations for the first time.36 The kinetics of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a series of meta- and para-substituted diphenyldiazomethanes with C60 and C70 fullerenes as dipolarophiles have been investigated in toluene at 30 °C.37 A symmetrical bis(styryl) benzene–C60 dyad has been synthesized based on the nucleophilic Bingel cyclopropanation of the C60 as part of single component solar cells. It has been found that the overall power conversion efficiency for such a solar cell has the highest value reported to date.38 C60 hexakis-adducts bearing 12 electron-donating N,N-dimethylaniline moieties have been prepared by modification to the original Bingel reaction.39
The first example of a 1,4-dipolar cycloaddition reaction in fullerene chemistry has been achieved from the novel multicomponent reaction of C60 fullerene with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate and isoquinoline, quinoline or substituted quinolines.40 Novel thermal cycloaddition reaction of C60 fullerene with the carbonyl ylides generated in situ from trans-epoxides to give C60-fused tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been investigated.41 A variety of C60-containing [2]rotaxanes have been obtained in moderate to good yields by Diels–Alder reactions,42 whilst soluble C60-rotaxanes incorporating a furamide template have been synthesised by Bingel reaction.43
The [2 + 2] photoaddition of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone to C70 and 3He@C70 have been studied by a combination of HPLC chromatography and spectroscopic techniques.44 Novel methodology for the preparation of stereospecifically five-, seven-, and nine-membered fused rings on C60 by photocycloaddition of dienyl cyclopropanes to C60 has been described.45 In order to determine the effects of the C60-cage on the pyrrolidine nitrogen, as well as the influence of further derivatisation, fulleropyrrolidine and pyrrolidine derivatives have been studied using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy.46 The processes of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of methyl azide to azafulleroid (C60NCH3) have been investigated by using AM I semiempirical and DFT.47 DFT have been used to investigate the electronic structures and geometries of 1-(3,4; 3,5 and 3,6-bis-selenocyanatophenyl)pyrrolidinofullerenes.48


2.1.2 Halogenations. 
A single abundant isomer of C76(CF3)18, C78(CF3)18, C84(CF3)18 and C59N(CF3)20 has been produced from pyrolytic trifluoromethylation of C76, C78, C84 and C59N fullerenes with silver trifluoroacetate at 300 °C, respectively.49 Another series of single abundant isomers of C74(CF3)12, C76(CF3)12, C80(CF3)12, two abundant isomers of C78(CF3)12, and C82(CF3)12, indeterminate number of isomers of C84(CF3)12 have been produced from the reaction of a mixture of insoluble higher fullerenes with CF3I at 500 °C.50 A novel isomer of C70(CF3)6 has been isolated chromatographically from a mixture prepared by trifluoromethylation of C70 with silver trifluoroacetate. Its X-ray structure revealed an unprecedented addition pattern.51 Using the same strategy, stable isomers of C70(CF3)n (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) have been synthesised, characterized, and theoretically studied.52 Two C70(CF3)12 isomers,53 five C70(CF3)14 isomers,54 single C70(CF3)16 and C70(CF3)18 isomers have been isolated chromatographically from the mixture produced in the ampoule reaction between C70 and CF3I at 390 °C, and their molecular structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and theoretically investigated at the DFT level of theory.55 Thermally stable perfluoroalkylfullerenes C60(CF3)6, C60(CF3)4O and C60(C2F5)4O have been produced from reaction of C60 and CF3I at 550 °C, characterisation of the products revealed the C60(CF3)6 isomer to be the first C60-fullerene derivative with adjacent CF3 groups.56 Selective synthesis of a trifluoromethylated fullerene and the crystal structure of C60(CF3)12 has been reported.57 Poly(perfluoroethyl)[60]fullerenes C60(C2F5)6 and C60(C2F5)8 have been obtained by the high temperature reaction of C60 with C2F5I, spectroscopic studies of these compounds showed unprecedented arrangement of addends.58 Hyperfluorinated species C60Fn with n up to 100 have been produced from fluorination of C60 fullerene with praseodymium tetrafluorides (PrF4).59 A new isomer of C60F8 has been produced by the reaction of C60 with KMnF4 and characterised by spectroscopic techniques.60 Higher yields of fluorofullerene (C60F18) have been achieved by using Rb2PtF6 and Cs2PtF6 as fluorinating agent.61 The electronic structure of the solid polycrystalline C60F18 has been investigated by reflection electron-energy-loss spectroscopy for the first time.62 C60F48 with 96% purity and 80% yield has been achieved by using C60/MnF2/F2 in a novel two-stage reaction and characterized by spectroscopic means.63 Infrared and Raman spectra, together with DFT computations studies, of C60F36 and C60F48 have shown that major isomers to be C3 and D3, respectively.64,65
Highly chlorinated fullerenes Th-C60Cl24, C1-C60Cl28, and D3d-C60Cl30 have been prepared by high-temperature reactions of C60 with PCl5/ICI and their spectroscopic properties have been investigated.66 Chemical and electrochemical reduction studies showed that the fully aromatic C60Cl30 is much more difficult to reduce than non-aromatic C60Cl24.67 Detailed spectroscopic characterization of D3d-C60Cl30 has been presented for the first time.68 C60Cl6 has been obtained using POCl3 as a chlorinating agent; crystal structure determination showed that the addends have been arranged in the ABAC sequence.69 The reaction of fullerene epoxide with triphenylphosphine and iodine produced a covalently-bonded iodofullerene that has been characterised by X-ray diffraction.70


2.1.3 Hydrogenation. 
Highly reduced C60H36–40 have been produced from the reaction of hydrogen gas with C60 at elevated pressure and temperature and the cage fragmentation pathways have been discussed.71 C60H36 has been prepared under mild conditions and its thermal dehydrogenation has been studied.72 Hydrofullerides C60H44–52 have been obtained by hydrogenation of C60 with thermal decomposition of LiAlH4 at high pressure and temperature.73


2.1.4 Oxidation and hydroxylation. 
The structures and spectra for the fullerene oxides C60On, C70On, C76On, C78On, and C80On have been comprehensively reviewed.74–76 Highly oxygenated fullerenes, C60O3–9, have been prepared by catalytic epoxidation of C60 with methyltrioxorhenium-hydrogen peroxide.77 The reaction of C60O with nucleophilic aromatic compounds in the presence of a Lewis acid afforded 1,4-bis(phenyl)-1,4-dihydro[60]fullerene.78 A number of stable fullerene mixed peroxides have been obtained by the addition of t-butylperoxy radical to fullerenes.79 The mixed fullerene peroxides C60O(OO′Bu)4 and C60((OOBu)-Bu-t)6 have been found to be effective precursors for cage-opened fullerene derivatives,80 while C60(t-BuOO)6 and C60O(t-BuOO)6 have been used for the preparation of isomerically pure fullerenols by reaction with Lewis acid.81 Unusual 1,3-dioxolano-[60]fullerene has been obtained by the reaction of C60 with acyl hypohalogenites CF3COOBr or CF3COOI in the presence of water.82 Polyhydroxylation fullerenes, C60(OH)18–20, have been produced in high yield by the continuous flow of oxygen in aqueous alkaline solution,83 while C60(OH)36, has been obtained under acidic conditions.84 Structural and optical properties of C60(OH)24–28, have been thoroughly analysed.85 The structural stability of C60(OH)32, has been investigated by both semiempirical as well as ab initio DFT calculations.86 Synthesis and spectral characterization of water-soluble derivatives of C70 and a higher fullerene mixture (C76, C78 and C84) have been achieved by direct air oxidation of chemically reduced fullerene carbon structures.87 The 2,2-[60]fullerenoalkanoyl chlorides have been prepared from their corresponding acids with thionyl chloride and converted to the corresponding amides and esters.88 [60]Fullerene-fused lactones have been prepared by the manganese(III) acetate-mediated reactions of C60 with carboxylic acids, carboxylic anhydrides, or malonic acids. Novel reductive ring opening of the lactones with Grignard reagents has been observed.89


2.1.5 Amination. 
Radical photoaddition of N-substituted (2-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidinyl) piperazines to C60 has been found to be selective and yielded C60(amine)4O and C60(amine)4 as major and minor products, respectively.90 A pure 1,4-diaminofullerenes has been isolated from the mixtures of polyaminofullerenes produced from the reaction of C60Cl6 and N-substituted piperazines.91 It has been found that the 1,4-diaminofullerenes C60(NR2)2 undergo interconversion by the reaction with excess of another amine R2′NH at room temperature.92 The electrochemical and photophysical properties of a new triad based on pyrazolino[60]fullerene and a conjugated dimethylaniline group has been systematically investigated.93 [60]Fullerene-fused pyrroline derivatives have been prepared by radical reactions of C60 with β-enamino carbonyl compounds mediated by manganese(III) acetate.94 Fullerene derivatives containing biologically active amino acids, thioamide, and thiourea units have been prepared by the reactions of C60 with amino acid ester hydrochlorides and CS2 in the presence of triethylamine.95


2.1.6 Polymerisation. 
The electrochemical formation of polymers containing fullerenes and studies of their properties and applications have been reviewed.96 A highly water-soluble and a potential material for photodynamic therapy of C60 polymer has been prepared by copolymerization.97 Also, water soluble C60-containing polymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid have been obtained by low-temperature radiation-induced quasi-living radical polymerization.98 A new class of conjugated polymers containing perylene, porphyrin, poly(p-phenylenevinylene) and/or fullerene units on the main chain have been synthesized. The structures and photophysical properties of these polymers have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques as well as gel permeation chromatography and cyclic voltammetry.99,100 Preparation, characterization, and the permeation properties of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) dense polymer films containing C60 have been described.101 A short-chain fullerene dimer has been prepared via bifunctional cycloaddition.102 Fullerene dimers C120, C120O, and C120O2 have been prepared by a high-speed vibration milling technique and their thermal stability has been studied at 150–350 °C under vacuum for up to 4 hours.103 Sequential cycloaddition of a monofunctionalised C60 and C70 fullerene results in the formation of a C60–C70 asymmetric fullerene dimer.104 An unusual 2D polymerisation in which the C60 units are connected both by [2 + 2] cycloaddition and by single carbon–carbon bonds has been achieved by lithium intercalated fullerides (Li4C60).105 Novel C60-anchored multiarmed polymers with well-defined structures have been synthesized by the effective Bingel reaction between C60 and the malonate ester core of the multiarmed polymers.106 Mono- and dual-fullerene C60 end-capped poly(acrylic acid)s (PAA-C60 and C60-PAA-C60) have been obtained by reacting C60 with well-defined mono- and dual-azide end-functionalized poly(tert-butylacrylate)s, followed by hydrolysis. The aggregation behaviours of these end-capped polymers in aqueous solution have been examined.107

2.2 Organometallic chemistry
The electrochemical and properties of redox-active films formed from fullerenes and selected transition-metal complexes have been reviewed together with a number of possible applications for these films.108 Synthesis and electrochemistry of D5d- and C5v-symmetric double-decker buckyferrocene Fe2(C60R10)Cp2 (R10 = Me5Ph5 and Me10) as new types of diiron complexes have been achieved.109 Conical molecules featuring a [60]fullerene/ferrocene hybrid and five arylalkyl side chains (Fe[C60{C6H4–(OCO–C6H3–(OR)2-3,4)-4}5]Cp) have been synthesized and examined for their structural and electrochemical properties as well as their ability to form supramolecular structures in crystals and liquid crystals.110 The two step reaction of C60 with Me3SiCH2MgCl using o-dichlorobenzene/tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran as solvent, respectively results in the formation of a trialkyl[60]fullerene, C60(CH2SiMe3)3H. Further treatment of a trialkyl product with potassium t-butoxide gave a potassium salt, [K(thf)n][C60(CH2SiMe3)3], which has been converted to the Rh(I) complex Rh[η5-C60(CH2SiMe3)3] in high yield.111 Preparation, characterisation, electrochemical and photophysical properties of novel porphyrin–C60 systems linked by ferrocene and related model compounds have been achieved.112 A rigid ferrocene–fullerene dyad has been obtained from the reaction of C60 and N-methylglycine and 1,1′-(α-oxotrimethylene)ferrocene. ET rate from ferrocene to C60 has been enhanced due to the frozen geometry of the dyad.113 Iron fullerene clusters have been prepared by plasma chemical synthesis, isolated by liquid chromatographic techniques, and investigated by electron magnetic resonance.114 Phenylene-bridged zinc bisporphyrins, C60-fulleropyrrolidines and their N-oxides have been synthesized. The fluorescence quenching processes of bisporphyrins by fulleropyrrolidines and their N-oxides has been investigated by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy.115 A zinc porphyrin–fullerene dyad with a disilane as a σ-conjugated linker has been synthesized to evaluate the ET ability of the oligosilane chain.

The electrochemical properties of these products have been reported.123 Efficient synthesis of organophosphorus group substituted C60 and C70 derivatives have been conducted from the reaction of C60 and C70 fullerenes with reactive methylene organophosphorus reagents.124 Carbon bridged organophosphorus C60 dimers have been synthesised by the reaction of aminome-thylenebisphosphonate anions with C60 and fully characterized.125 Syntheses, structures, and electrochemical properties of a series of benzyl isocyanide-substituted C60-triosmium complexes have been reported.126 Fullerene coordination ligands bearing one bipyridine or terpyridine unit have been prepared, their coordination to ruthenium(II) and electrochemical and photophysical properties have been described.127 Pyridinofullerene ligands capable of forming axial complexes with zinc tetraphenyl porphyrin have been synthesized and characterized.128 Polymetallic nanodimensional assemblies have been prepared via metal directed assembly of dithiocarbamate with transition metals (Ni, Pd, Cu, Au, Zn, and Cd).129 C60 and C70 complexes with metal dialkyldithiocarbamates M(R2dtcx), where M = Cu(II), Cu(I), Ag(I), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Pt(II); R = Me, Et, and nPr, have been synthesised and characterised. Their magnetic and photoconductivity properties have also been studied.130 Novel transition metal-fullerene complexes containing di- and tetra-phosphane ligands have been obtained, characterized and their electrochemical properties have been described.131 For providing a simple model of natural photosynthesis, two novel ruthenocene–C60 dyads, with a 2-pyrazoline or a pyrrolidine rings as a linker, have been synthesized and characterized. It has been found that ruthenocene–[60]fullerenes have an ability to prolong the charge-separated states compared with those for ferrocene–[60]fullerenes.132 C60 fullerene complex C60–Pd(Ph2PCH2CH2CH2CH2PPh2) has been prepared by replacement reaction in inert atmosphere, characterized by spectroscopic studies and its photoelectric properties studied.133 Structure and stability of substitutional doped metallofullerenes MC59 of the first,134 second- and third135-row transition metals, C59Sm and exohedral C60Sm have been studied using DFT.136 The conformational (cis and trans) stability and electronic structures of fullerene-porphyrin-fullerene triads linked by metal axial coordination (C60CHCOO)2–Sn(IV) have been studied by ab initio calculations.

Methylaminated potassium fulleride, (CH3NH2)K3C60, has been formed by the co-intercalation of methylamine molecules into the cubic K3C60 lattice and characterized by spectroscopic and X-ray powder diffraction techniques.138 The dynamic and structural properties of the ammonia-doped superconducting fulleride (NH3)0.5–1NaK2C60 have been investigated using sodium and deuterium solid-state NMR techniques.139 The C60-fulleride complexes with bis(η6-hexamethylbenzene) chromium, hexamethylbenzene, and hexaethylbenzene have been synthesised, characterized and their thermal decomposition properties studied.140 Preparation, characterization and hydrogen storage properties of platinum fulleride (Pt–C60) have been discussed. It has been suggested that the hydrogen storage properties of Pt–C60 were related to the valence electron dispersion of Pt.141 A microscopic mechanism for superconductivity in an alkali-metal doped fulleride has been proposed and support has been given for the notion that a fulleride doped with two electrons exhibits Wigner-like correlations.142 Static and dynamic Jahn–Teller effects in the alkali metal fulleride salts K4C60, Rb4C60 and Cs4C60 have been reported.143
2.4 Advanced materials
The synthesis of C60-based TTF or π-conjugated oligomer adducts using Diels–Alder cycloaddition as an efficient tool for linking π-donors onto [60]fullerenes has been reviewed.144 An overview of fullerene photoactive dyads assembled by axial coordination with several electron donors, including porphyrins and subphthalocyanines, together with their photophysical properties based on the structural modifications of the ligands by covalent chemistry have been presented.145
Novel TTF–oligothiophene–fullerene triads have been synthesized as single-component materials for photovoltaic cells. Photovoltaic performances of triad cells has been improved compared to the corresponding oligothiophene–fullerene dyads.146 Dissymmetrical TTF derivatives have been synthesized as versatile building blocks to reach TTF-based donor–acceptor assemblies incorporating C60 in triads C60–TTF–C60 and p-benzoquinone–TTF–C60.147 A new TTF–anthracene dyad fusion with the crown ether unit has been described.148 The fluorescence of this new dyad can be modulated with Na+ and C60, and its fluorescence intensity can be largely enhanced only in the presence of both Na+ and C60.148 Two novel dual oligothiophene-fullerene triads, 8T–4T–C60 and 4T–8T–C60, where quaterthiophene (4T) and octithiophene (8T) are linked by a trimethylene chain and either one is attached to C60 as a photoinduced long-distance charge separation system, have been studied.149 Four X-shaped oligothiophenes with different conjugation length have been investigated as novel electron donors in single-layer bulk-heterojunction solar cells. It has been found that the performance of the photovoltaic cells varied significantly with molecular structures of the four oligothiophenes and the photovoltaic effect is dependent on the substituted thiophene number and the film forming abilities of the X-shaped thiophenes.150 A fabricated phototovoltaic device from a light absorbing π-conjugated oligomer-tetrafullerene nano-array and P3HT has showed an external quantum efficiency of 15% at 500 nm.151 The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the oligomers with C60 and N-methylglycine yields a new family of star-shaped derivatives end-capped with pyrrolidinofullerene moieties as the active materials for photovoltaic devices. The UV-VIS and photoluminescence behaviours of these pyrrolidinofullerene-functionalized derivatives have been investigated.152 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using 5-(4-carbonylphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-methoxylphenyl)porphyrin, N-methylglycine and C60 have been used to produce a covalently linked porphyrin–[60]fullerene dyad. Spectroscopic studies of this dyad showed a promising architecture with potential application as a photoactive organic material.153 New model systems for long-lived intramolecular charge separation have been achieved either through the preparation of covalently linked heterofullerene–porphyrin conjugates from reaction between tetraphenyl porphyrins with peripheral acetyl or malonate groups and C59N,154 or from porphyrin–fullerene photosynthetic model systems with rotaxane and catenane architectures.155 A series of porphyrin–fullerene donor–acceptor dyads in which the two chromophores are linked by conformationally flexible polyether chains have been reported.156 New porphyrin derivatives with β-pyrrole ethynyl linkage and a corresponding dyad with [60]fullerene have been synthesised.157 Their photophysical properties showed that the coupling between the donor and acceptor moieties is strong enough for possible photovoltaic applications.157 Functional mimics of a photosynthetic antenna-reaction centre complex comprising five bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene antenna moieties and a porphyrin-fullerene dyad organized by a central hexaphenylbenzene core have been prepared and spectroscopically studied.158 A silica nanoparticle has been successfully employed as a nanoscaffold to self-organize porphyrin and C60 molecules on a nanostructured SnO2 electrode which exhibits efficient photocurrent generation.159,160
The formation of electrostatically coupled assemblies of a series of anionic dendritic fullerene derivatives and cationic porphyrins in buffered aqueous media has been studied by gel electrophoresis experiments, and which give new insight into aggregation phenomena.161 Supramolecular porphyrin-fullerene conjugates, using bis-18-crown-6 appended porphyrins and pyridine or alkyl ammonium functionalized fullerenes have been synthesised and their structural integrity accomplished spectroscopically and theoretically.162 Photoinduced electron transfer in intramolecularly interacting free-base porphyrin bearing one or four 18-crown-6 ether units at different positions of the porphyrin macrocycle periphery and C60 have been investigated in polar and nonpolar solvents. The investigation showed that the switching of intra- to inter-molecular ET has been achieved by complexing potassium ions to the crown ether cavity in benzonitrile or extracting the potassium ions of the complex with 18-crown-6. This study demonstrates the application of supramolecular methodology to control the excited-state ET path in donor–acceptor dyads.163 Supramolecular triads composed of C60 as a primary electron acceptor, zinc porphyrin as a primary electron donor, and either a ferrocene, N,N-dimethylaminophenyl, or N,N-diphenylaminophenyl as a second electron donor have been constructed via a ‘two-point’ binding motif involving axial coordination and hydrogen bonding.164 The redox behaviour of the different components has been studied using cyclic voltammetry.164 Redox active films have been generated electrochemically by the reduction of dyads consisting of C60 covalently linked to zinc meso-tetraphenyloporphyrin and palladium acetate. It has been found that the film formation is also accompanied by palladium deposition on the electrode surface, the presence of a metallic phase in the film influences its morphology, structure and electrochemical properties.165
Light-harvesting C60-based dyads endowed with a truxene fluorophore unit have been synthesized.166 Studies of photophysical properties revealed that the light absorption and energy transduction processes strongly depend on the nature of the linker connecting both chromophores, such as C60 and truxene.166 Pyrene and fluorene appended fulleropyrrolidine triads,167 and fluorophore–fullerene dyads which contain either a naphthalene, pyrene, or fluorene entity, while the triads contain either a pyrene or fluorene entity in addition to a naphthalene entity, have been synthesized. The redox behaviour of these dyads and triads has been probed by cyclic voltammetry while the geometry and electronic structures have been deduced from ab initio calculations. Steady-state emission studies revealed that the extended range of excitation wavelength to induce energy transfer to the appended fullerene has been achieved in the case of the triads.168 Photovoltaic devices have been fabricated using blends of a phosphorescent platinum–acetylide polymer and a fullerene (PCBM); involvement of the triplet excited state of the platinum–acetylide polymer in photoinduced charge transfer is believed to contribute to the device efficiency.169 An axially substituted titanium(IV) Pc–fullerene donor–acceptor supramolecular dyad has been prepared and its photophysical properties showed that the dyad system exhibits photoinduced ET upon irradiation with visible light to produce a microsecond lived charge separated state.170 A novel zinc Pc–fullerene dyad, in which two photoactive units are brought together by a phenylenevinylene spacer has been synthesized and its charge-separated states have been studied.171 The molecular structures within the interfaces of the bulk heterojunction material comprising regioregular-poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and C60 or its soluble derivative (PCBM) have been studied by one- and two-dimensional NMR.172 Photoluminescence properties of the supramolecular interactions between a pyrrolidinofullerene bearing three chelating pyridyl groups and zinc-Pc have been studied. Solar cells fabricated from thin evaporated layers of these supramolecular moieties showed short-circuit current densities of approximately 4 mA cm−2 with open circuit voltages around 400 mV.173
A series of azahomofullerenes and poly(amino)fullerenes have been synthesized and their photoluminescence and photovoltaic measurements have been investigated.174 Three brominated mono-methano[60]fullerene malonate derivative polyads have been investigated for intra- and inter-molecular heavy-atom effects on their fluorescence properties.175 A new C84 adduct, ([84]PCBM), has been obtained as a mixture of three major isomers via a diazoalkane addition reaction and tested in a bulk heterojunction solar cell as the first C84 derivative to be applied in device fabrication.176 Room temperature liquid C60 derivatives bearing a 2,4,6-trialkyloxyphenyl branch have been prepared.177 Their physical properties showed a dramatic decrease in viscosity with an increase in the length of the alkyl chains. This feature, makes these derivatives attractive novel carbon materials for future applications in materials science.177

A new endohedral fullerene, H2@C60, has been synthesized in good yield by closure of the 13-membered ring orifice of an open-cage fullerene using four step organic reactions. H2@C60 has been purified by recycle HPLC and its spectra178 as well as nuclear spin–lattice relaxation time in organic solvents have been studied.179 The syntheses of the first endohedral superconductors with critical temperatures lower than expected have been achieved by the preparation of pure argon endohedral fullerene Ar@C60.180 Four new monoadducts of endohedral fullerenes encapsulating a nitrogen atom, N@C60, have been synthesised and characterized; the effect of different exohedral molecular structures fused to the fullerene cage has been studied.181 The temperature dependence of the electron spin relaxation times of the molecules N@C60 has been examined in liquid CS2 solution.182 Organic inclusion compound 2,4,6-tris(4-bromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine has been used to create an ordered arrangement of N@C60, P@C60 and N@C70 in a crystalline host matrix. The different host–guest structures were investigated by X-ray diffraction and EPR.183,184 Preparation, HPLC purification and ESR characterisation together with reactivity of the endohedral fullerene epoxide N@C60O has been reported.185 Single endohedral fullerene isomers of Eu@C72-I, Sr@72-II and Yb@72-I have been isolated by multi-step HPLC and characterized spectroscopically for the first time.186 The geometric and electronic properties of Si@C74 have been analysed based on DFT. It has been found that the most favourable endohedral site of the Si atom is to be under the centre of a pentagon ring on the σh plane (Si@C74-5) among the five possible optimized geometries of Si@C74.187 Calcium-containing mono-metallofullerenes, Ca@C76, Ca@C88, and Ca@C90 (I, II), have been synthesized by an improved DC arc discharge method and isolated by a multi-stage HPLC method for the first time, and characterized by spectroscopic techniques.188 The endohedral pyrrolidinodimetallofullerene, La2@C80(CH2)2NTrt, has been synthesized and characterized. The localization of the two La atoms in the 6,6-adduct has been confirmed by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculation.189 A bisadduct190 and five monoadducts191 of La@C82 have been produced from the reaction of La@C82 with diethyl bromomalonate using Bingel reaction and fully characterized. Supramolecular complexes of La@C82 with unsaturated thiacrown ethers have been described in solution as a result of ET.192 Host–guest complexation of endohedral metallofullerene La@C82 with macrocyclic compounds such as azacrown ether have been examined.193

It has been found that this approach provides purified metallic nitride fullerenes at ambient and reflux conditions.196 Two monoadducts of N-tritylpyrrolidino Ih Sc3N@C80 have been produced by the reaction between the pure Ih isomer of Sc3N@C80 and N-triphenylmethyl-5-oxazolidinone via the corresponding azomethine ylide. These N-tritylpyrrolidino derivatives have been characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and are believed to be potential useful precursors for further derivatisation for various applications.197 The exohedral reactivity of a series of TNT endohedral metallofullerenes Sc3N@C68, Sc3N@C78 and several isomers of Sc3N@C80, via [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions of 1,3-butadiene, have been studied together with DFT calculations.198 The enhanced reactivity of the D5h isomers in comparison with the more common Ih isomers of Sc3N@C80 and Lu3N@C80 toward Diels–Alder and 1,3-dipolar tritylazomethine ylide cycloaddition reactions have been reported.199 New three isomers of Dy3N@C80 cluster fullerene have been produced, isolated and spectroscopically characterized.200 The electrochemistry of these new cluster fullerenes as well as Dy3N@C78, has been studied systematically including their redox-reaction mechanism.201 A photoemission study of potassium intercalated TNT endohedralfullerene Dy3N@C80, has been reported.202 Synthesis, characterisation and electrochemical analysis of a series of endohedral metallofullerenes M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Y, Er) derivatives have been described, unexpected isomerization of N-ethyl [6,6]-pyrrolidino-Y3N@C80 to the [5,6] regioisomer has been characterised using electrochemistry as a new tool in such characterization.203 A mixed TNT endohedral metallofullerene, CeSc2N@C80, has been synthesised, isolated and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

4. Applications of fullerene derivatives
The literature concerning the effects induced by carbon nanoparticles on the biological environment and the importance of these effects in human and animal health has been reviewed.208 Several pharmacological effects and possible mechanisms of water-soluble [60]fullerene derivatives on organs, cells, enzymes, and nucleic acids have been discussed.209 The formation of a stable, water-soluble, well-defined complex of a pristine C60-BSA hybrid at a physiological pH range has been reported.210 The formation of C60-BSA played a key factor for studying carbonaceous materials, biodelivery systems, transport mechanisms and for characterizing the potential effects of nanomaterials on wildlife and human health, both in vitro and in vivo.210 Supramolecular composites containing fullerenes immobilized at nanosilica and modified by photosensitive organic molecules have been used for the design of molecular systems that can be effective agents in cancer photodynamic therapy.211 Human epidermal keratinocytes have been exposed to various concentrations of fullerene-based amino acid solutions in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C for periods between 1–24 hours. The results showed that the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.04 mg mL−1 decrease cell viability and initiate a pro-inflammatory response, while concentrations lower than 0.04 mg mL−1 initiate less cytokine activity and maintain cell viability.212 It has been found that the porphyrin–C60 dyad can form a photoinduced charge-separated state to inactivate cells by photodynamic therapy.213 The biological effects of C60 fullerene using mouse embryonic stem cells to clarify the effect on the differentiation have been investigated.214 A therapeutic agent for degeneration diseases of the central nervous system, C60(C(COOH)2)2, has been synthesized, purified and characterized; its interaction with the living cell and penetration of the cellular membrane have been studied in situ using fluorescence microscopy.215 The first [60]fullerene immunoconjugates have been prepared and characterized in an initial step toward the development of fullerene immunotherapy.216 It has been reported that the aqueous C60–polyvinylpyrrolidone complex and molecular-colloidal water solutions of C60 exhibit virocidal activity due to different mechanisms.217 The C60 acts mainly as a membranotropic agent in aqueous complex, while it acts mainly as a photosensitizer in the colloidal water solution.217 The inhibitory effect of water-soluble fullerene on UV-induced and the hydroperoxide t-BuOOH-induced apoptosis-like cell death against human skin keratinocytes cells has been evaluated.218 Four different regioisomers of cationic bis-N,N-dimethylfulleropyrrolidinium salts have been prepared and evaluated as inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase. These fullerene derivatives have been found to be non-competitive inhibitors of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis.219 The biodistribution and tumour uptake of C60(OH)x in five mouse bearing tumour models, including mouse H22 hepatocarcinoma, human lung giantcellcarcinoma PD, human colon cancer HCT-8, human gastric cancer MGC803, and human OS732 osteosarcoma have been examined.220 Similarly, and in order to explore the antioxidative functions of nanoparticles, the biodistribution of [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles, the changes of blood coagulation profiles, the metabolism of ROS in the tumour-bearing mice as well as the possible relationships between nanoparticles treatment and ROS production have been investigated.221 Water-soluble amino acid derivatives of Gd@C82O6(OH)16(NHCH2CH2COOH)8 (AAD-EMF) have been synthesized by the reaction of pure Gd@C82 with an excess of alkaline solution of β-alanine and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. MRI phantom studies have been carried out to confirm the high efficiency of AAD-EMF as MRI contrast agents.222 The aggregation behaviour of AAD-EMF has been studied in detail by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.223
The applications of fullerene materials in catalytic reactions, especially in organic reactions including application in hydrogen transfer and hydrosilylation, pyrolysis of alkanes, H2–D2 exchange, coupling and alkyl transfer reaction have been reviewed.224 An overview of the latest developments in the preparation and properties of mobius aromatic hydrocarbons and trannulenic fullerenes with aromaticity has been presented.225 The most significant examples of the different strategies followed to enhance the electron acceptor ability of substituted fullerenes, thus making it feasible to modulate their electronic properties have been studied.226
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on some of the novel copolymers consisting of fluorene and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine/quinoxaline in combination with fullerene derivative acceptor PCBM have been fabricated, and their photovoltaic parameters have been measured.227 The same strategy has been used to fabricate photovoltaic cells with a power conversion efficiency of up to 0.038% by blending one of the arylenevinylene conjugated polymers, including poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-vinylene) and poly[2-(3′-dimethyldodecylsilylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], with the fullerene derivative PCBM.228 The first demonstration of a working solar cell using a novel covalently linked bis([60]fullerene)-Pc exhibiting long-lived photoinduced charge separation both in solution and in the solid state has been presented.229 The thermal stability of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on blends of regioregular P3HT and fullerene derivative PCBM has been enhanced by decreasing effective polymer regioregularity by introducing 3,4-dihexylthiophene into the polymer chain of P3HT.230 The dependence of the short-circuit current and an open-circuit voltage on light intensity and time have been studied for solid-state photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion devices based on blends of (P3HT) and C60 fullerene.231 The photovoltaic performance of the cell fabricated via electrochemical co-deposition of polythiophene and [60]fullerene on an indium tin oxide glass electrode modified with a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylthiophene) has been remarkably improved.232 The fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells from C60 and polymer crystals obtained from the coupling between propargyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadiyne-1,6-diol have been achieved and their photovoltaic properties have been analyzed in relation to crystal structure, electrochemical properties, and band structure of the polydiacetylene polymers.233 The design and fabrication of a C60 derivative with a uracil-like unit (U–C60), to form a bi-molecular building block with a C60 derivative with a 2,6-bis(acylamino) pyridine unit by complementary trident hydrogen-bonding array has been reported.234
A phase separated mixture of regioregular P3HT and PCBM as the active layer and aluminium (Al) for the source and drain electrodes has been used to fabricate an organic field-effect transistor with equivalent hole and electron mobilities.235 The electrical properties of a bottom gate C60-fullerene based n-channel organic field effect transistor have been reported.236 Fabrication of high performance unipolar (n-channel) ring oscillators with stage delays of 2.3 μs have been achieved by integrating several transistors based on C60 films grown by hot wall epitaxy.237
Air-stable n-channel organic transistors have been fabricated based on a soluble C84 fullerene derivative for the first time, it’s air stability allows the realization of complementary circuits under ambient conditions without encapsulation.238
It has been demonstrated that a single Ni, atom on the fullerene surface can store up to three H2 molecules. Consequently, at high Ni coverage, Ni-dispersed fullerenes are considered to be novel hydrogen storage media capable of storing up to 6.8 wt% H2, thus exceeding the Department of Energy target (6.5 wt%) for automobile applications.239 Using DFT studies, it has been demonstrated that the isolated Li12C60 cluster, where Li atoms are capped onto the pentagonal faces of the fullerene, can store up to 120 hydrogen atoms in molecular form with a binding energy of 0.075 eV/H2.240
