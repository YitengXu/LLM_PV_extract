The resulting rutile TiO2 hierarchical microspheres with a diameter of 5–6 μm are composed of nanorods with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a length of 1–2 μm.

By spin-coating a diluted TPP3 paste (sTPP3) on the RMS film prior to scraping the bTPP3 film, the resulting RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film-based DSSC achieves a significantly enhanced efficiency (7.27%). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film possesses better electron transport capability and longer electron lifetime than the bTPP3 film. This work not only provides the first example of directly growing rutile TiO2 hierarchically structured microsphere film on Ti foil suitable for replacing the rigid, heavy and expensive transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass substrate to serve as a light-scattering underlayer of Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs, but also paves a new route to develop Ti foil-based flexible DSSCs with high efficiency, low cost and a wide application field through optimizing the composition and structure of the photoanode.
Introduction
As an alternative to the traditional silicon-based photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have aroused widespread attention because of their clean, low-cost, easy fabrication, high power-conversion efficiency and good durability.1–3 For improving the photovoltaic performance, strenuous effort has been made to develop various nanostructured or hierarchically structured materials for optimizing the composition and structure of the photoanode.4–15 Among them, the most important purpose is enhancing the light-harvesting capability of DSSCs so as to improve their photovoltaic performance.12–15 In a typical DSSC, incident light must penetrate through the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass substrate and excite the dye molecules on the nanosized TiO2 film. Although most of the incident light can be absorbed by the loaded dye molecules, some incident photons still pass through the DSSC due to the small particle size and thickness of the nanosized TiO2 porous film.10,16
To enhance the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs, some light-scattering materials were introduced into the photoanode.11–17 Generally, larger particles in the nanosized TiO2 porous film act as scattering centers to diffuse the incident light and expand its optical path, and thus enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. However, such scattering centers inevitably lead to the loss of the surface area of the porous film, and thus a light-scattering overlayer on the nanosized TiO2 film has been devised to obtain more efficient light harvesting.18–26 For example, Sun and co-workers24 reported a bilayer TiO2 film consisting of one-dimensional (1D) nanowire arrays (as an underlayer) and a three-dimensional (3D) dendritic microsphere film (as a light-scattering overlayer), the corresponding bilayer DSSC showed a better efficiency (7.2%).25
Crystalline TiO2 mainly exists in three polymorphs (anatase, rutile, and brookite).13–15 Among them, anatase is the most popular crystal phase in the field of DSSCs because of its good electrical conductivity and its (101) facets having the lowest surface energy for efficiently supporting dye loading,27,28 while the most stable rutile proved to be less efficient when used as a photoanode material due to its lower electrical conductivity than that of anatase.16,29–32 Nevertheless, rutile TiO2 has more stable physicochemical properties, higher refractive index and better light-scattering capability when compared to anatase.16,27 Therefore, various hierarchical rutile materials were fabricated and employed as a light-scattering layer or even a photoanode material of DSSCs.16,27–32 For example, well-defined 3D hierarchical rutile TiO2 architectures (HRT) were used as a light-scattering layer of DSSCs, which achieved an efficiency of 8.6%, much better than that (7.6%) of the DSSC fabricated with the commercial transparent/reflector anatase TiO2 paste (7.6%).16 Zhao and co-workers31 synthesized rutile TiO2 hierarchical nanorod/nanosheet/nanoflowers (TNRSFs) on TCO glass and used them as a photoanode of DSSCs with an efficiency of 8.41%, indicating a 51.8% enhancement compared to the nanosized TiO2 photoanode (5.54%). Also, peach-like rutile TiO2 microspheres composed of nanoneedles were produced, and the corresponding DSSC exhibited an efficiency of 2.55%, which was further improved to 5.25% upon a series of post-treatments as a direct consequence of the well-crystallized TiO2 and the efficient light scattering.32
The above results demonstrate the significance of designing photoanode materials with hierarchical structures for enhancing the rutile-based solar cells’ performance.16,27–32 However, the photoanodes in those research studies are fabricated on TCO glass, which limits the application field of DSSCs due to the rigid and heavy nature of TCO glass.33–37 Also, TCO glass makes up more than 30% of the total cost of DSSCs.3 To lower the cost and widen the application field, some flexible substrates (e.g., ITO/PET, ITO/PEN and metals) were used to replace TCO glass.3,36,37 Nevertheless, the conductive plastic substrates are intolerant of temperatures higher than 150 °C, which is much lower than the required one (usually 450–550 °C) to fabricate the photoanode on TCO glass, thus resulting in the relatively poor performance of plastic-based DSSCs. Therefore, metal foils (such as Ti and stainless steel) that are tolerant of high-temperature sintering were used to fabricate flexible DSSCs with encouraging performance compared with the plastic-based ones.3,34
Up until now, to the best of our knowledge, no report focused on the direct growth of hierarchical rutile structures on Ti foil. One of the main reasons is the optical opacity of Ti foil. This means that the corresponding Ti foil-based DSSC requires the incident light illuminating from the counter electrode (back-side illumination). The traditional I3−/I− electrolyte used in the glass-based DSSC has relatively high light absorption, which would hinder the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the Ti-foil-based DSSC because the incident light must pass through the electrolyte before being absorbed by the dye molecules on the photoanode. Therefore, transparent Pt counter electrodes and iodine-free electrolytes are necessary for the Ti foil-based DSSCs.33,34
Herein, a sea urchin-like rutile TiO2 microsphere (RMS) film was directly fabricated on Ti foil via an acidic solution-assisted hydrothermal treatment of Ti foil in TiCl4 solution. The resulting hierarchical rutile TiO2 microspheres with a diameter of 5–6 μm are composed of nanorods with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a length of 1–2 μm. This Ti foil-based RMS film exhibits much better light-scattering capability than the bare Ti foil, and thus was used as an underlayer of a nanosized anatase TiO2 porous film (bTPP3) that was prepared by using commercially available paste (TPP3) for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency. The corresponding Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSC assembled with an iodine-free ionic liquid (IL) gel electrolyte, which is suitable for the necessary back-side illumination,33 gives an efficiency of 4.05%, much lower than the single bTPP3 film-based one on Ti foil (5.97%). By spin-coating a diluted TPP3 paste (sTPP3) on the RMS film prior to scraping the bTPP3 film, the resulting RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film-based DSSC achieves a significantly enhanced efficiency (7.27%). The research results based on spectroscopic, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques indicate that the rutile hierarchically structured microsphere film directly grown on Ti foil is suitable for replacing the rigid, heavy and expensive TCO glass substrate to serve as an efficient light-scattering underlayer of the nanosized anatase TiO2 porous film for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs with lower cost and a wider application field.
Experimental section
Material and photoanode preparation
A Ti foil-based sea urchin-like rutile TiO2 microsphere (RMS) film was fabricated on Ti foil via an acidic solution-assisted hydrothermal process by using TiCl4 as a Ti source. Typically, a concentrated HCl solution (15 mL) was dissolved in deionized water (15 mL), and then TiCl4 solution was dropped into the resulting solution with vigorous stirring. The transparent mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) containing 20 × 30 mm2 Ti foil (0.1 mm, Wuhan Geao), which was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in turn before use. Afterwards, the autoclave was kept at 150 °C for 90 min, and then the treated Ti foil was washed with distilled water and ethanol several times, dried and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to obtain the Ti foil-based RMS film.
In addition to the above Ti foil-based RMS film (referred to as RMS), three other types of film electrodes were prepared for comparative investigations. (1) RMS/bTPP3: commercially available paste (TPP3) containing nanosized anatase TiO2 with a particle size of ∼20 nm (Hep-tachroma Co., Ltd) was scraped onto the RMS film through a doctor blading technique.12,13 After drying at room temperature, the film was calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain the RMS/bTPP3 electrode; (2) RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3: a diluted TPP3 paste (the commercially available TPP3 paste was diluted 10 times with ethanol) was spin-coated on the RMS film, and then the commercially available TPP3 paste was scarped onto it after drying at room temperature, which was calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode. (3) bTPP3: the TPP3 paste was scraped onto the bare Ti foil, and then calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain the bTPP3 electrode. (4) sTPP3/bTPP3: the above diluted TPP3 paste was spin-coated on the Ti foil, and then the TPP3 paste was scarped onto it after drying at room temperature, which was calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain the sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode.
These fabricated Ti foil-based TiO2 film electrodes were post-treated with 1.0 wt% TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to enhance the electrical contacts of the TiO2 films. Dye sensitization was conducted by immersing the TiO2 film electrode into an ethanol solution (0.3 mM) of N719 [cis–bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium), Solaronix SA, Switzerland] for 12 h, and then washed with anhydrous alcohol and dried by blow drying.
Fabrication of the photoanode and the solar cell
As mentioned above, the optical opacity of Ti foil causes the incident light of the Ti foil-based DSSC to be illuminated from the counter electrode (back-side illumination), and thus the light absorption of the traditional I3−/I− organic electrolyte used in the glass-based DSSC would hinder the improvement of the photovoltaic performance.33,34 Therefore, a transparent counter electrode and an iodine-free electrolyte are prepared and used in the present Ti foil-based DSSCs.
A transparent Pt counter electrode was prepared by spreading a 3.0 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution onto the TCO glass followed by heating at 400 °C for 30 min. The resulting Pt counter electrode shows a very similar transmittance in the range of 300–1000 nm as shown in Fig. S1.† An iodine-free ionic liquid (IL) gel electrolyte was prepared according to our previous report.33 Typically, 50 mg of DMPII (1,2-dimethyl-l-3-propylimidazolium iodide, Wuhan Geao) was dissolved in 2.5 mL acetonitrile with stirring, and then 5 wt% KI was added into the solution. Afterwards, 15 wt% PEO (polyethylene oxide, MW = 300000, Alfa Aesar) and 5 wt% PEG (polyethylene glycol, MW = 10000, Alfa Aesar) were added and stirred overnight to obtain the desired electrolyte. This iodine-free IL gel electrolyte has much better transparency than the traditional I3−/I− organic electrolyte, and thus is suitable for the Ti foil-based solar cell that needs back-side illumination.33
The above iodine-free IL gel electrolyte was cast on the top of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film electrode, and then placed on the transparent Pt counter electrode to assemble a typical sandwich-typed Ti foil-based solar cell. A light-shading mask was used on the solar cell to fix the active area to 4 × 4 mm2. At least ten parallel devices were fabricated with each kind of the above TiO2 film-based photoanodes in order to obtain statistically significant results.
Material and electrode characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns in the range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 50° were obtained using a Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV, 15 mA, and a scan rate of 4° min−1. The morphology of the Ti foil-based TiO2 film electrode was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss-Sigma). The thickness of the Ti foil-based TiO2 film was determined using a TalyFormvS4C-3D profilometer (U.K.). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) was obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as a reference. To determine the dye loading amount, the dye-sensitized film electrode was immersed in a NaOH solution (0.1 M) in a mixed solvent (water:ethanol = 1:1) at room temperature, which leads to N719 desorption from the film electrode. The absorbance of the resulting solution was determined by using a UV-3600 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), and the corresponding dye loading amount was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.41 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 at 515 nm as in previous reports.11,12,30
Photoelectrochemical property test
The fabricated DSSC was illuminated by 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) from a 300 W AM1.5G sunlight simulator (2 × 2 beam, w/6258 lamp, Newport, USA). The incident light intensity was determined using a SRC-1000-TC-QZ-N reference mono-crystalline silicon cell system (Oriel, USA) that was calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (A2LA accreditation certificate 2236.01). The current–voltage (J–V) curve for the fabricated DSSC was collected using a CHI618 electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments). The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements were carried out applying a bias of the open-circuit voltage and recorded over the frequency range from 0.05 Hz to 105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. For the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curve measurements, the illumination was turned off using a shutter after the cell was first illuminated to a steady voltage, and then the OCVD curve was recorded. Both EIS and OCVD measurements were carried out on a CHI-604C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments) combined with a Xe-lamp as a light source under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Crystalline phase and microstructure analyses of the RMS film

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the rutile TiO2 microsphere (RMS) film derived from the acidic solution-assisted hydrothermal process. It can be seen that the RMS product scraped from the Ti foil-based film shows obvious diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.4°, 36.1°, 39.2°, 41.2°, and 44.1°, which can be attributed to the reflections of the (110), (101), (200), (111), and (210) planes of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS no. 77-0441),27–30 respectively. There is no diffraction peak ascribable to the anatase or brookite TiO2, indicating that the rutile in the RMS film has high phase purity. Also, the strong and sharp diffraction peaks in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the RMS product has good crystallinity, which is related to the post-calcination process at 500 °C of the RMS film after the hydrothermal process.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the RMS product scraped from the Ti foil-based films derived from an acidic solution assisted hydrothermal process. 
The low magnification FESEM images (Fig. 2a and b) indicate that the RMS film is composed of sea urchin-like microspheres with a diameter of 5–6 μm, which consist of nanorod-like units of ∼200 nm in diameter and 1–2 μm in length as shown in the high magnification FESEM image (Fig. 2c). The hierarchical microspheres on Ti foil are rutile phase as demonstrated in the XRD analysis result. It was reported that the {110} facets of rutile TiO2 can preferentially adsorb Cl− ions, which then retard the crystal growth along the {110} facets to form nanorod-like structures.32 It is also the reason for the formation of the present nanorod-like rutile TiO2 in those microspheres because the hydrothermal reaction was performed in TiCl4 solution. According to the liquid N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. S2†) of the product scraped from the Ti foil-based RMS film, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of RMS is very small (2.58 m2 g−1) since it is composed of large rutile microspheres fabricated from nanorods with ∼200 nm diameter and 1–2 μm length as mentioned above. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the Ti foil-based RMS film has obviously higher diffuse reflectance in the visible region (400–800 nm) than the bare Ti foil, which is helpful to expand the optical path of the Ti foil-based TiO2 photoanode, and thus to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of the Ti foil-based DSSC. This will be discussed further below.

Photovoltaic performance analyses of the Ti foil-based solar cells
In order to investigate the feasibility of applying the Ti foil-based RMS film in nanosized anatase TiO2 film-based DSSCs, five types of TiO2 films were employed to fabricate the Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs. Among them, the RMS device was fabricated using a single RMS film, the RMS/bTPP3 device was fabricated by using a RMS film as an underlayer of the nanosized anatase TiO2 porous film (bTPP3), and the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device was fabricated with a film derived by spin-coating a diluted TPP3 paste on the RMS film, and then scarping TPP3 paste onto it. In addition, the bTPP3 and the sTPP3/bTPP3 devices were fabricated with the bTPP3 and the sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode without RMS film, respectively. Ten parallel devices sandwiched with each kind of the above TiO2 films were fabricated for the photovoltaic performance measurements. Fig. 4 shows the typical current–voltage (J–V) curves of those DSSCs under AM1.5G (1 sun) light illumination, and the typical photovoltaic performance parameter, film thickness, and dye-loading amount are listed in Table 1.

As can be seen from Table 1, the reproducibility of the conversion efficiency for various DSSCs is confirmed by the uncertainty being smaller than ±9%, which can be calculated from the respective standard deviation of ten parallel devices. In particular, the standard deviation of the efficiency for the ten parallel RMS devices is ±0.06 with an uncertainty of ±8.2%, implying the reproducibility of the RMS film grown on the Ti foil via the present hydrothermal process. The RMS device only gives a 0.73% efficiency (η) with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.34 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, while the bTPP3 solar cell performs much better efficiency (5.97%) with Voc = 0.68 V, Jsc = 13.31 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.66. The remarkably enhanced Jsc value of the bTPP3 device can be due to the much larger dye-loading amount (8.14 × 10−7 mol cm−2), which is ∼22 times higher than that (0.37 × 10−7 mol cm−2) of the RMS film. More dye molecules on the bTPP3 film are beneficial for more efficient light harvesting, which leads to more photogenerated electrons and thus to the significantly enhanced Jsc value compared to the RMS device.
It is worth noting that the RMS solar cell exhibits a higher Voc (0.72 V) than the bTPP3 device (0.68 V). On the one hand, the higher Voc of the RMS device might be attributed to the higher Fermi level of the RMS film electrode since rutile has a higher conduction band than anatase.35 On the other hand, the particle size (∼20 nm) of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles in the bTPP3 film is much smaller than that of the nanorods in the RMS film (Fig. 2), which usually causes more charge recombination sites and then an increased dark current (Fig. 5), thereby resulting in the lower Voc value compared to the RMS solar cell (Table 1).34–37 Zaban and co-workers have demonstrated that the Voc value of a solar cell under illumination is related to the increase of the quasi-Fermi level (EFn) of the semiconductor with respect to the dark value (EF0) that equals the redox potential of the electrolyte, and thus the Voc value can be calculated according to eqn (1).38 (1)where kBT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, n0 is the electron concentration in the dark, and n is the free electron density in the photoanode.
 Fig. 5  Dark current curves of DSSCs fabricated with the RMS, bTPP3, RMS/bTPP3, sTPP3/bTPP3, or RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode. 
As can be seen from the typical dark current curves (Fig. 5), the bTPP3 device shows much larger dark current values than the RMS one. It implies an increased charge recombination existing at the bTPP3 film/electrolyte interface, which then leads to the loss of the free electron density (n) of the bTPP3 electrode, and thereby lowers the Voc value according to eqn (1).38,39 In addition, the long rutile TiO2 nanorods accumulated in those RMS microspheres could provide a better electron transport path than the bTPP3 film with much smaller particle sizes even though rutile has a lower electrical conductivity than anatase,16,29–32 and thus effectively reduces the charge recombination, causing a lower dark current and a higher Voc compared to the bTPP3 device. Nevertheless, the bTPP3 device exhibits much higher dye loading and Jsc value due to its larger surface area, which leads to the better conversion efficiency compared to the RMS device (Table 1).
Although the RMS film on Ti foil is particularly suitable for use as a light-scattering layer as mentioned above, the RMS/bTPP3 solar cell only achieves a 4.05% efficiency (Jsc = 11.46 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, FF = 0.57), which is still lower than the bTPP3 device with a 5.97% efficiency (Jsc = 13.31 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.66). A proximate cause for this issue is the much lower Jsc value of the RMS/bTPP3 solar cell even though the RMS/bTPP3 and the bTPP3 films have very similar dye-loading amounts (Table 1). The quite rough surface of the RMS film because of its large sea urchin-like microspheres (Fig. 2) might lead to poor physical contact between the RMS and the bTPP3 films, thus causing an increased electron transport resistance to lower the Jsc value of the RMS/bTPP3 device.
To solve this problem, a diluted TPP3 paste (sTPP3) was spin-coated on the RMS film, and then TPP3 paste was scarped onto it to fabricate the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode. The corresponding RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device achieves an efficiency of up to 7.27% (Jsc = 17.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.67 V, and FF = 0.63), improved by ∼22% when compared to the bTPP3 device (5.97%). The spin-coated sTPP3 can fill the large gaps existing among the nanorods and microspheres to improve the electrical contact between the bTPP3 and the RMS films, and then promote the electron transfer from the bTPP3 film to Ti foil. This conjecture can be supported by the FF value (0.63) of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device being higher than that (0.57) of the RMS/bTPP3 one (Table 1) and the photovoltaic performance parameters of the sTPP3/bTPP3 device without RMS films being very similar to that of the bTPP3 one (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The above results indicate that although sTPP3 on the Ti foil has no obvious effect on the photovoltaic performance of the bTPP3 device, the sTPP3 on the RMS film leads to the decreases of the internal resistance and the charge recombination, and then to the significantly improved efficiency of the RMS/bTPP3 device. As can be seen from Fig. 6a and b, the nanosized anatase TiO2 of sTPP3 is evenly distributed among these rutile nanorods of sea urchin-like microspheres. It is beneficial for improving the physical contact between the RMS underlayer and the bTPP3 overlayer during the subsequent preparation of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film, while the bTPP3 overlayer is a uniform porous film mainly composed of nanosized anatase TiO2 (Fig. 6c).
 Fig. 6  FESEM images of the fabricated Ti foil-based RMS/sTPP3 (a, b) and the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 (c) films. 
Furthermore, the dark currents of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell are smaller than those of the bTPP3, the RMS/bTPP3, and even the sTPP3/bTPP3 devices (Fig. 5), indicating that the RMS underlayer not only acts as a light-scattering layer, but also as a protective layer to suppress the dark current generated at the Ti foil/electrolyte interface. The dark current of the RMS/bTPP3 solar cell is larger than that of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device due to the poor charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In general, the use of a Ti foil-based RMS film as a light-scattering layer can effectively improve the light-harvesting efficiency of the bTPP3 film, which is beneficial for improving the photovoltaic performance of the Ti foil-based DSSCs.
Photoelectrochemical behavior analyses of the solar cells
To gain insight into the interfacial charge transfer dynamics between the RMS and the bTPP3 films of the Ti foil-based solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured under back illumination. Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of the EIS spectra of Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) light illumination. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 7a) of all devices show only two main semicircles because their iodine-free IL gel electrolyte has relatively high conductivity that makes the semicircle at the low frequency region (mHz) (related to the I3− ion's Nernst diffusion) featureless.33,37 Therefore, the photoelectrochemical parameters of these devices can be simulated using the simple equivalent circuit model inserted in Fig. 7a, and the relative fitted parameters are listed in Table 2. The series impedance Rs is mainly related to the electrical resistance between the base resistance and the TiO2 film/Ti foil interface; Rct1 represents the impedance associated with the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, which is related to the high-frequency (in the kHz region) semicircle;38–42 and Rct2 demonstrates the resistance of the electron accumulation/transport within the TiO2 film and the charge transfer across the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces, which is related to the middle-frequency (in the 10–100 Hz region) semicircle.15,36–40

Generally, a lower Rct2 value favors a longer electron transport distance with less diffusion obstruction to some extent, which could lead to a reduction of the charge recombination and a more efficient electron transfer.41 As can be seen from Table 2, the RMS and the RMS/bTPP3 solar cells have greater Rct2 than the bTPP3 device, which can be due to the rutile possessing lower conductivity than the anatase.16,26 In addition, the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell displays a decreased Rct2 (46.4 Ω cm2) compared to the RMS/bTPP3 (724 Ω cm2) and the bTPP3 (61.8 Ω cm2) devices, indicating that the spin-coated sTPP3 on RMS film can improve the physical contact between the RMS and the bTPP3 films and facilitate charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces.
The injected electron lifetime (τn) of a solar cell can be determined by using the equation τn = 1/(2πf) according to the low-frequency peak position of the Bode plots (Fig. 7b), where f represents the frequency of the superimposed alternating voltage.37,40 As shown in Table 2, the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell shows a longer electron lifetime (75.7 ms) compared to the bTPP3 (42.6 ms) and the RMS/bTPP3 (42.5 ms) devices, resulting in the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device showing higher photocurrent density and lower dark current.
The above EIS results indicate that the spin-coated sTPP3 on the RMS film can improve the physical contact between the RMS and the bTPP3 films and facilitate charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces, which then lead to the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film possessing better electron-transport capability and longer electron lifetime compared to the bTPP3 film. Therefore, it can be considered that the composition and the interface structure of TiO2 porous film affect the photovoltaic performance of the Ti foil-based DSSCs, which is consistent with the above analysis results of the J–V (Fig. 4) and the dark current (Fig. 5) curves.
Open-circuit voltage decay curve analyses of the solar cells

Fig. 8 depicts the open-circuit voltage decay (OVCD) and the corresponding electron lifetime (τ′n)–Voc relative curves of the Ti foil-based DSSCs. Under the used open-circuit and dark conditions, the electron transport impedance in the TiO2 film does not affect the OCVD measurement because no current flows through the solar cells. As shown in Fig. 8a, the Voc decay trend of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device is much slower than that of the RMS and the bTPP3 ones. It means that the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 device has longer electron lifetime and lower charge recombination than the RMS and the bTPP3 ones, also indicating that the sTPP3 on the RMS film can promote electron transport from the bTPP3 film to the Ti foil.
 Fig. 8  OCVD (a) and the corresponding τ′–Voc (b) relationship curves of the DSSCs fabricated with the RMS, bTPP3, RMS/bTPP3, or RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 electrode. 
It was reported that the shape of the τ′n–Voc curve of a solar cell qualitatively reflects the effects of the electron traps on the recombination reaction since the difference of the cell's Voc can change the τ′n values due to the shift of the Fermi level of TiO2.38,40Fig. 8b gives the corresponding τ′n–Voc relationship curves derived from the OCVD measurements based on eqn (2): (2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the electron charge.40
As can be seen from Fig. 8b, the τ′n–Voc relationship curve of the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell is located above that of the RMS/bTPP3 and bTPP3 devices in the middle and low voltage regions. It indicates that the electron recombination in the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell is slower than that of the RMS/bTPP3 and the bTPP3 devices, which leads to the longer electron lifetime of the corresponding solar cell. Namely, the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film can more efficiently transport the injected electrons and retard the charge recombination compared to the bTPP3 film. This is consistent with the above analysis results on J–V, dark current, and EIS.
As mentioned above, the spin-coated sTPP3 on the RMS film can ensure connection among those rutile nanorods in the microspheres film. Therefore, the grain boundary and the surface electron traps of TiO2 particles in the RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film could be obviously reduced compared to the RMS/bTPP3 film, which can promote the charge transfer in the electrode. In addition, the nanorod-like structures in the RMS microspheres can also reduce the hindrance to electron transport and provide a better path for electron transfer. Namely, the use of a Ti foil-based RMS film as the light-scattering layer can effectively improve the light-harvesting efficiency of the Ti foil-based DSSCs, and the spin-coated sTPP3 on the RMS film is beneficial for reducing the film resistance and promoting the charge transfer from the bTPP3 film to the Ti substrate. The above advantages of the present Ti foil-based RMS film make it suitable for replacing the rigid, heavy and expensive TCO glass to serve as a light-scattering underlayer of the nanosized anatase TiO2 porous film, and the corresponding Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 solar cell achieves an efficiency of 7.27%, with a ∼22% enhancement compared to the bTPP3 device (5.97%). These results provide a new insight for fabricating more efficient Ti foil-based DSSCs with lower cost and a wider application field by optimizing the composition and structure of the photoanode film.
Conclusions
In summary, a sea urchin-like rutile TiO2 microsphere (RMS) film was directly fabricated on Ti foil via an acidic solution-assisted hydrothermal treatment of Ti foil in TiCl4 solution. The resulting rutile TiO2 hierarchical microspheres with a diameter of 5–6 μm are composed of nanorods with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a length of 1–2 μm. The light-scattering ability of the RMS film in the visible region (400–800 nm) is better than that of the bare Ti foil. By using the RMS film as the light-scattering underlayer of a nanosized anatase TiO2 film (bTPP3), the corresponding Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSC only gives an efficiency of 4.05%. By spin-coating a diluted TPP3 paste (sTPP3) on the RMS film prior to scraping the bTPP3 film, the resulting RMS/sTPP3/bTPP3 film-based DSSC achieves a significantly enhanced efficiency (7.27%), with a ∼22% enhancement when compared to the single bTPP3 device on Ti foil (5.97%). The spin-coated sTPP3 on the RMS film can decrease the impedance of the solar cells and increase the electron lifetime, and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cell. These results provide the first example of directly growing rutile TiO2 hierarchical structures on Ti foil suitable for replacing the rigid, heavy and expensive TCO glass substrate to serve as a light-scattering underlayer of Ti foil-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs, and facilitate the development of more efficient Ti foil-based DSSCs with lower cost and a wider application field by optimizing the composition and structure of the photoanode films.
