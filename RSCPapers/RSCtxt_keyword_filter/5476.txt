    First published on 18th November 2022AbstractElectronic doping is applied to tailor the electrical and optoelectronic properties of semiconductors, which have been widely adopted in information and clean energy technologies, like integrated circuit fabrication and PVs. Though this concept has prevailed in conventional PVs, it has achieved limited success in the new-generation PV materials, particularly in halide perovskites, owing to their soft lattice nature and self-compensation by intrinsic defects. In this review, we summarize the evolution of the theoretical understanding and strategies of electronic doping from Si-based photovoltaics to thin-film technologies, e.g., GaAs, CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2, and also cover the emerging PVs including halide perovskites and organic solar cells. We focus on the chemical approaches to electronic doping, emphasizing various chemical interactions/bonding throughout materials synthesis/modification to device fabrication/operation. Furthermore, we propose new classifications and models of electronic doping based on the physical and chemical properties of dopants, in the context of solid-state chemistry, which inspires further development of optoelectronics based on perovskites and other hybrid materials. Finally, we outline the effects of electronic doping in semiconducting materials and highlight the challenges that need to be overcome for reliable and controllable doping.

1. Introduction
Energy depletion and environmental pollution are two primary bottlenecks for global development. Solar energy is one of the promising candidates for replacing fossil fuels to address the energy crisis. The Sun provides more than enough energy to meet the whole world's energy needs. Photovoltaics directly convert solar energy into electricity, which is an important sustainable energy source. However, approximately only 1.7% of the global electricity demand has been met by electricity generated by PVs up to now. The only limitation of solar energy utilization is its higher cost for electricity generation compared to other technologies.1
In PV technology, semiconductor materials are usually used as light absorbers. Electronic doping is a process that enables the local manipulation of charge carrier density and conductivity in a semiconductor, and it is essential for semiconductor-based electronic devices, in particular solar cells (Table 1). Through electronic doping, p–n junctions can be formed, which are the elementary “building blocks” of solar cells. Based on the p-type and n-type wafers, c-Si solar cells were produced and used for the first time in a prominent application when they were equipped on the Vanguard satellite in 1958.2 However, the cost of generating electricity from solar cells was staggering due to their high manufacturing cost and low conversion efficiency at that time, which was still as high as $100 per watt in 1971. In c-Si solar cells, the Schottky barrier, a region with high resistance for carriers, can be formed at the interface between the metal and the semiconductor.3,4 Recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes in these contact regions severely limits the PCEs of these devices. Through heavy doping, BSF was established in the metal–semiconductor contact interface, promoting the efficiency of commercial Si solar cells to ∼20%, thus reducing the generation cost significantly.5

Even so, Si solar cells remain expensive and still have a high EPBT.30 New-generation PV materials feature weak chemical bonding, low cost, and solution processability, which are promising for achieving PV grid parity. However, it is difficult to achieve reliable and controllable doping, especially for halide perovskite materials, limiting their device performance for commercialization.31–33 The fundamental understanding and modulation of the underlying properties of these materials are still limited, which hinders the future material/device design. In addition, typical physical approaches that are successfully adopted in conventional PVs, like ion implantation, may cause severe crystal damage to materials featuring soft lattice and ionic behavior.34,35 Thus, chemical approaches have been developed and intensively investigated.36,37 However, systematic investigation is still required to reveal their doping validity and impacts on materials properties and consequent carrier behaviors.
“Doping” in new-generation PV materials focuses on the introduction of certain kind of impurities into the lattice for controlling crystal growth and/or tuning the device performance (efficiency and stability).38–40 In this review, the “electronic doping” techniques applied in PV technologies are summarized. We review the electronic doping mechanisms, strategies, and impacts from Si-based photovoltaics to thin-film technologies (e.g., CdTe, CIGS), to the latest generation of PSCs and OPV materials finally. To understand the evolution of electronic doping, we make two comparisons: (1) conventional semiconductors and halide perovskites, and (2) physical and chemical approaches, in which their applications in PVs are extensively discussed. In particular, we discuss chemical approaches to electronic doping, emphasizing various chemical interactions/bonding throughout materials synthesis/modification to device fabrication/operation from a chemistry perspective. New classifications (atomic doping, molecular doping and self-doping) and quantitative models of electronic doping are proposed based on the physical and chemical properties of dopants in the context of solid-state chemistry, which hopes to inspire further developments of optoelectronics for perovskites and other hybrid materials. We hope our contribution will shed light on the understanding of electronic doping and development of effective approaches to modulating the electronic properties of materials.
2. The working principles of electronic doping
Different from a single, isolated atom with discrete energy levels, a semiconductor crystal consists of a huge number of atoms (N → ∞) whose atomic orbitals overlap and split into a near-continuous energy band. The dopants can be incorporated into the semiconductor lattice as substitutions or interstitials, or they may be segregated at lattice defects, grain boundaries and interfaces.41–43 Usually, dopants are dispersed in a low concentration without an orbital overlap, which forms a series of isolated energy levels scattered in the energy bands. The electron configuration in the semiconductor under thermodynamic equilibrium follows the Fermi–Dirac statistics. But the introduced localized electrons from dopants do not follow the original electronic distribution, and were in temporary violation of the Fermi–Dirac statistics.44 The dopants must have the statistical tendency to move to a new thermodynamic equilibrium that obeys the Fermi–Dirac statistics, resulting in the electron transport between dopants and the semiconductor.
The doping type is determined by the introduced localized energy level. If an isolated full energy level appears after doping and it is higher than the original full energy level, that is, VB of the semiconductor, the electrons in this energy level are more likely to enter an empty band, that is, the CB of the semiconductor and become free electrons. This doping is called n-doping. In contrast, if an isolated vacant energy level appears after doping, as long as it is lower than the CB of the semiconductor, it is more likely to accept electrons and leave a hole in the VB. This doping is called p-doping.
When the dopant is atomic, the positions of the introduced energy levels are usually related to the number of valence electrons, so we can simply use the atomic valence to analyze the doping type.45,46 When the dopant is molecular, the positions of empty and full bands are related to the valence electrons of the molecule, the doping type is determined by the HOMO and/or LUMO energy levels of the molecules as compared to the semiconductor energy levels.47,48 In addition, some semiconductors with low defect formation energy and high defect concentration exhibit unusually observed self-doping.49,50 So far, numerous studies have explored the introduction of free charge carriers into semiconductors under equilibrium conditions by atomic doping, molecular doping, or self-doping.
3. Atomic doping
The most prevalent strategy for semiconductor electronic doping involves the introduction of charged impurities compensated by excess charge carriers.51–53 Unlike molecular doping, this strategy has been widely adopted in the industry to yield highly stable n- or p-type doped semiconductors.54 Conventional electronic doping is realized by ion implantation via the bombardment of semiconductors with energetic ions (the dopants) followed by thermal annealing, which has been successfully utilized in Si, GaAs, CdTe, and oxides.55–58 However, atomic doping remains a challenge in some systems in which only a small amount of excess charge carriers can be introduced from the charged defects, especially for perovskite materials.59 In most cases, charged defects are compensated by localized counter charges at the grain boundaries or surfaces.54,59
3.1 Doping mechanism
According to the position of foreign atoms in the lattice, impurities can be categorized into interstitial or substitutional defects. Substitutional impurities are formed when the original atom in the lattice site of a crystalline solid is replaced by a different type of atom, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Foreign atoms that occupy the interstitial position are called interstitial impurities, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Both substitution and interstitial impurities can introduce impurity energy levels into a semiconductor, resulting in p- or n-type doping.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of foreign impurity for substitutional impurity (a) and interstitial impurity (b). 
When foreign atoms occupy the lattice site of the crystal, depending on their valence (valence electrons number), the dopants may give electrons as free charge carriers to form an n-type doping, or accept electrons from the semiconductor, leaving positively charged holes in the VB, to form a p-type doping. Taking Si materials as an example, P atoms will occupy the crystal lattice of Si atoms and generate impurity defects, the reaction involved can be represented using the Kröger–Vink notation formula:60 P + SixSi ⇌ PxSi + Si(1)where SixSi represents one occupied Si site in the perfect crystal and PxSi represents the P atoms that occupy the Si lattice site.
A P atom has five valence electrons but can form only four covalent bonds with the surrounding Si atoms. One of the valence electrons does not participate in the formation of a covalent bond, which is bounded to the P atom loosely. And it is easier for this electron to gain energy to become one of the free electrons: (2)where  represents a positively charged substitution defect and e′ is a negatively charged electron.  is immobilized due to covalent bonds, but the electron can move freely in the Si crystal. As a result, the electron concentration increases.
When B atoms are doped into the Si lattice site,  and free holes are formed, where  cannot move but holes can move freely, leading to the increase of hole concentration. This doping process is shown schematically in Fig. 2.

3.2 Doping strategy
The ionization energy and electron affinity energy of an isolated atom are primarily determined by the number of electrons in its outermost shell (valence electron), which determine whether the dopants give or take electrons from the semiconductor. According to the valence of doped ions, the doping strategy can be divided into heterovalent doping and isovalent doping.

3.2.1 Heterovalent doping. 
In heterovalent doping, heterovalent atoms are incorporated into host semiconductors, and excess free charge carriers are introduced according to the difference between the valence of dopants and the semiconductor. Heterovalent doping is the most common strategy for semiconductor electronic doping, which has been successfully applied to Si, GaAs, CdTe, CIGS and other semiconductors.
Crystalline Si is the earliest and the most widely used photovoltaic material with a diamond crystal structure, which is composed of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic primitive lattices with each atom in a tetrahedral coordination environment (Fig. 3(a)). Crystalline Si has an indirect bandgap of 1.12 eV at 300 K, leading to a high theoretical efficiency limit according to the SQ limit. As the p–n homojunction is the basic structure for Si solar cells, both p-type and n-type Si semiconductors are needed. The B atom, which has a high diffusion coefficient in the Si, has been widely used in p-type wafer production, with the advantage of obtaining a spatially homogeneous doping concentration.6 And for monocrystal Si solar cells, P and Al can also be used to make n- or p-type regions, respectively, by the solid-state diffusion method.61 After decades of research on Si doping techniques, the correlation between the resistivity and dopant concentration has been thoroughly investigated and documented (Fig. 3(b)).62

GaAs is another frontrunner in solar cell technologies. With a crystal structure similar to Si, GaAs has a direct bandgap of 1.44 eV at 300 K. With higher electron mobility and larger light absorption coefficient, the GaAs based solar cell has obtained the best PCE among single-junction solar cells of 29.1%. When Si atoms replace some of the trivalent Ga atoms in the lattice, shallow donor levels (EC − 0.0058 eV) and additional valence electrons are introduced.63,64 However, Si atoms can also replace parts of As atoms at high Si concentration conditions and act as acceptors.65 Interestingly, preferred substitutions in the GaAs lattice that can be altered by doping techniques have been demonstrated, as shown in Fig. 3(c).66 By HVPE, the Si doping in GaAs was close to nominal due to the near-equilibrium character of this growth method, which could incorporate Si in the Ga sites and lead to n-type doping. However, the incorporating of Si in the Ga sites can be almost completely suppressed, and the As sites are predominantly replaced by Si in the strongly non-equilibrium MBE technique for constructing p-type conductivity. Moreover, the IVA group of elements, Ge and Sn, can also be used as a heterovalent cation to prepare n-type GaAs.67 In addition, Zn was used as a p-type dopant, which can replace Ga and introduce a shallow-acceptor level (EV + 0.031 eV).68
CdTe has a direct bandgap of 1.48 eV at 300 K and a Zinc blende crystal structure similar to that of GaAs. With a more optimal bandgap and lower carrier effective masses, it has a higher theoretical PCE than Si. The CdTe champion device has an architecture with a p-type CdTe/n-type CdS heterojunction, thus its p-doping is important.
Group IA and group VA elements have been used to substitute Cd and Te, respectively, for p-type doping, such as Cu, P and As.69,70 The first-principles calculation proposes that the Cu dopants in CdTe can occupy the Cd sites and act as acceptors, or occupy the interstitial positions as donors.71,72 Under Te-rich conditions, Cu dopants can be used to increase the hole concentration due to their larger preference of substitution over interstitial positions. The resistance of CdTe layers decreased rapidly at first and then increased slowly with the increase of doped Cu atom concentration, leading to the same evolution of efficiency and minority carrier lifetime of CdTe (Fig. 3(e)–(g)).73 The formation of compensating donor-type defects may be responsible for the increase in resistivity. At moderate doping concentration, the efficiency and carrier lifetime of CdTe solar cells can be optimized. In addition, P and As dopants can form p-type doping when coordinated tetrahedrally.72,74,75 However, defects of PTe and AsTe could transform into deep donors, which limits the doping efficiency.
Chloride treatment, typically with CdCl2, has been widely used to form n-type CdTe.76 Cl ions may be concentrated at the grain boundaries and form ClTe defects, which can offer free electrons and become positively charged.77 After Cl doping, the quantum efficiency of CdTe quantum dots dramatically enhanced from 10% to 90% and the carrier lifetime increased from 1.2 ns to 2.3 ns. Moreover, MgCl2 could also be used to replace CdCl2 for low-cost and environment friendly processing.78
CuInSe2 has a bandgap of 1.01 eV at 300 K, which can be tuned by the substitution of In to Ga and/or Se to S to construct CIGS. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, are also commonly used as the post-deposition treatment dopants after CIGS growth.79 DFT calculations suggested that alkali atoms tend to occupy the In sites and these substitutional defects have a lower formation energy and act as acceptors (Fig. 3(d)). Besides, alkali metals could increase the intrinsic defect formation energy and passivate the CIGS layer, which decrease the deep-level defect density and increase the net carrier concentration.80,81 In brief, local p–n junctions can be formed by electronic doping to facilitate charge separation.
Halide perovskites have a tunable bandgap and can be adjusted through chemical substitution. The structure of halide perovskites is a framework of corner-sharing lead iodide octahedra (PbI3−) with a cation, such as Cs, MA and/or FA, at the center of each cuboctahedral cage (Fig. 5(a)). Theoretically, heterovalent heteroatoms can be inserted into the A, B, or X site of the perovskite lattice to tailor its carrier concentration. However, the orbitals of A-site cations tend to fall much deeper within the bands, which has limited effect on carrier concentration.82 B and X site ions majorly contribute to the CBM and VBM in perovskites, so it is easier to tune the carrier concentration and EF by the B and/or X site ion doping (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  The possible heterovalent doping elements of halide perovskites and their doping type. 
Replacing Pb with monovalent or trivalent cations is the commonly used doping method to adjust carrier concentration in halide perovskite semiconductors. Generally, substituting Pb with monovalent cations could increase hole concentration and achieve p-type doping. The effect of monovalent cation halide additives such as CuBr, CuI, NaI, and AgI was explored in MAPbI3 perovskite films.83 These results showed that a better PCE was achieved in NaI- and CuBr-based films, but the JSC of the AgI-based films decreased. KPFM measurement identified that the work function of additive-based perovskites significantly shifted (about 0.1 V) toward the work function of Au, which was responsible for efficiency improvement. In contrast, it is also reported that Ag incorporation resulted in an enhancement of the PCE from 16.0% to 18.4% in MAPbI3 based devices, and from 11.2% to 15.4% in MAPbI3−xClx based devices.28 The EF of the Ag-doped perovskite shifted to the VBM, indicative of increased hole concentration. Interestingly, Ag doping can realize not only p-type doping, but also n-type doping. Zhang et al. found that an n-type perovskite film was obtained by adding AgI to the perovskite precursor solution, which was attributed to the crystallization control with aligned orientation of MA cations.84 Therefore, electron mobility was improved from 7.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (pristine MAPbI3) to 1.5 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 after AgI doping, which enhanced the PCE from 17.59% to 20.02%.
The copper(I) complexes can be incorporated into the perovskite film to modulate carrier concentration. Incorporating Cu(thiourea)I into perovskites was found to form a p–n bulk heterojunction, which increased the depletion width from 126 to 265 nm, accelerating hole transportation.85 Besides, it was proved that Na could form substitutional defects in the Pb-site of the perovskite lattice. A 0.5% Na doping significantly improved the electronic conductivity of perovskite, from ∼10−7 Ω−1 cm−1 (undoped MAPbI3) to ∼10−6 Ω−1 cm−1 (Na-doped MAPbI3).86 In addition, DFT calculations indicated that In and Tl were promising candidates to form p-type doping in perovskites materials (Fig. 5(b)).27

In addition to monovalent cations, trivalent cations were also used for the heterovalent doping of perovskites. The first-principles calculations implied that the substituting of Pb with Sb and Bi could form an n-type doping (Fig. 5(c)).27 Due to a similar ionic radius to that of Pb (1.18 Å), Bi (1.02 Å) was the mostly-used heterovalent doping ion, which can be easily doped into lead halide perovskites. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the free carrier concentration measured by the Hall effect increased from ∼109 cm−3 (undoped MAPbBr3 single crystals) to ∼1011–1012 cm−3 after Bi doping. And the conductivity measured by the four point probe method also increased by 4 orders of magnitude, from ∼10−8 Ω−1 cm−1 for the undoped crystal to ∼10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 for the Bi-doped crystal.26 The conductivity of Bi-doped perovskite polycrystalline film increased from 3.02 × 10−6 to 9.76 × 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1.87 Based on Sb doping, the electron density in the CB of MAPbI3 was increased and the quasi-Fermi energy level was elevated.88 Furthermore, Al has a higher valence and smaller ionic radius than Pb, which can substantially reduce the microstrain of the MAPbI3 film and enhance the device performance.37
Other methods like X-site doping were also applied to manipulate the carrier concentration. Oxygen can act as an acceptor dopant, in which the O atoms replaced the I atoms or accommodated interstitially.89,90 Experimental results showed that the concentration of holes and iodine vacancies increased with oxygen pressure under illumination. Surprisingly, the concentration of majority carriers increased at low oxygen pressure, but decreased when the pressure is high, which may be related to the increase of the defect state concentration.88
Besides the heterovalent ion substitution, the electronic doping can be also modulated by interstitial impurities. In Si solar cells, the monocrystalline silicon surfaces have abundant Si dangling bonds, which introduce a half-occupied deep energy level state in the bandgap.91,92 Hydrogen atoms can chemically passivate the Si dangling bonds, and act as acceptors in n-type Si or as donors in p-type Si.6,93 Surface H could further migrate into the bulk region as interstitial H, which can neutralize shallow dopants, so it can act as a compensating donor or acceptor in p-type Si or n-type Si, respectively.94
With a small ionic radius, Li+ cations may locate on interstitial lattice sites and act as n-dopants in halide perovskite materials. DFT calculations indicate that interstitial occupancy is energetically favorable for Li+ compared to A-site substitutions. After Li-doping, the measured EF in MAPbI3 shifted up by 440 meV, reducing the non-radiative process by trap filling.95 Besides, Li+ can do n-doping for CsPbBr3 electrochemically, which improves the electron injection efficiency.96


3.2.2 Isovalent doping. 
Isovalent doping means the doped ions have the same valence as the lattice ions they replace. Take Sn-doped MAPbI3 as an example, the defect reaction equation can be described as: (3)where Sn×Pb represents the Sn atom that occupies the Pb lattice site and I×I represents the one occupying the I site in the perfect crystal. It can be seen from eqn (3) that the incorporation of the isovalent ions will not generate extra electrons and holes, so it will not affect the carrier concentration. However, the carrier concentration of a semiconductor can be significantly changed if there are considerable discrepancies of electronegativity and/or atomic radius between dopants and semiconductors.97 For example, doping N or Bi atoms in GaP will introduce impurity level into the forbidden band realizing isoelectronical doping.98,99 The N atom replaces P atom, which could capture an electron and become a negative charge center with an ionization energy of 0.008 eV. Conversely, Bi atom that replaces P atom can capture a hole and become a positive center, and the excess hole has an ionization energy of 0.038 eV. Therefore, in addition to the valence number of dopants, the electronegativity and atomic radius are also crucial for the doping selection.
In addition, isovalent ions can influence carrier concentration through regulating and passivating defects. This phenomenon is not significant in conventional PVs due to their high defect formation energy and low defect density. However, it cannot be neglected in halide perovskite materials that have a high defect density. As an isovalent dopant, CaCl2 realized a controllable n-type doping of perovskite material. The EF of the Ca-doped CsPbI2Br perovskite film was closer to the CB compared with that in the control film, achieving an enhanced built-in electric field and higher VOC.42 Other isovalent cations, such as Mg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+ and Sr2+ have also been reported to passivate the surface/interface defects and/or increase the grain size, which are capable for electronic doping.100–105
Furthermore, doping unstable isovalent ions can modulate carrier density through redox reactions. Compared with Pb2+, Sn2+ is much easier to be oxidized to Sn4+.106,107 The E0 of Sn2+/Sn4+ is +0.15 V vs. +1.67 V for the Pb2+/Pb4+, indicating that Sn2+ is thermodynamically unstable.108 In addition, Sn2+ has the same valence as and similar ionic radius to Pb2+, suggesting that Sn2+ is a suitable electronic dopant with a redox reaction. Due to the lack of detailed and clear explanation of the mechanism of Sn2+ doping, we thus consider various free carrier formation processes for the electronic doping of Sn-based perovskites. We assume that Sn2+ occupies the lattice site of Pb2+, and the Sn-related defects are activated by lattice instability and defect-mediated processes as endogenous defects. For p-doped halide perovskites, the possible intrinsic defect electronic disorder reactions read as follows: Sn2+ ⇌ Sn4+ + 2e′(4) (5)where  represents a Sn vacancy with double negative charges, and h˙ is a positively charged hole. Consider the tin oxidation in halide perovskites as exogenous, i.e., Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+via the chemical reaction with O2, which may mostly occur at/near grain boundaries and surfaces.109,110 The overall reaction equations can be written as follows: Sn2+ + O2 ⇌ SnO2 + 2h˙(6)
As the Sn-doped perovskites were found to be p-type doped (Table 2) and Sn2+ is easily oxidized, reaction (5) and (6) may be the dominant doping mechanisms for Sn-doped halide perovskites.111 However, the SnO2 phase has not been detected by XRD in an oxidized perovskite. It may exist as an amorphous material or in small “crystalline” aggregates, which was separated and confirmed by high-resolution XPS.112–114 Note that tin oxidation should be further distinguished between the preliminary oxidation of tin in the solution precursors, i.e., before the perovskite nucleation process (discussed in Section 4.2), and after the perovskite crystal formation (Sn2+ occupied in the lattice sites of Pb2+). And it implies that not only the Sn oxygenation/reduction of O2, but also  (eqn (5), at least in part) can contribute to p-type doping. The doping mechanism of Sn is complicated, which requires further investigation.

3.3 Doping efficiency
The effective carrier concentration produced by impurities is affected by many factors. Among them, three main factors may further determine/limit the doping efficiency:115 (1) the desired dopant may have a low solubility. (2) The desired dopant has good solubility, but the defect transition energy level may be too deep, thus, the defect cannot be ionized at normal operating temperatures. (3) The desired dopant has good solubility and proper ionizability, but as the EF shifts due to the increase of carrier density, which may also lead to the formation of oppositely charged native defects or defect complexes of the dopant, thus limiting the change of the EF.
Taking these three main factors into account, the effective carrier concentration n generated by doping can be expressed as follows: n = ndopant × ηIP × (1 − ηSelf-compensation),(7)where ndopant is the dopant concentration, which is limited by solubility, ηIP is the donor or acceptor ionization probabilities, and ηSelf-compensation is the self-compensation probability.

3.3.1 Solubility. 
The factors that affect solid solubility are quite complicated and have not been completely unveiled by experiments. Hume–Rothery and his collaborators proposed a semi-empirical law that illustrates the factors and rules governing the solid solubility in solid solutions. For substitutional solid solutions, the Hume–Rothery rules are as follows:
(1) The atomic radius of the solute (rsolute) and solvent (rsolvent) must not differ by more than 15%: (8)
(2) The solute and solvent should have similar electronegativity. If the electronegativity difference is too great, the metals tend to form intermetallic compounds instead of solid solutions. It is possible to obtain large solid solubility, when the electronegativity difference is less than 0.4–0.5.
(3) The crystal structures of solute and solvent must be similar.
(4) Complete solubility occurs when the solvent and solute have the same valency.
Moreover, for interstitial solid solutions, solute atoms should have a radius smaller than 59% of the radius of solvent atoms to achieve a considerable solid solubility.
Fundamentally, Hume–Rothery rules are based on the geometrical restraints, which is suitable for systems that form either substitutional or interstitial solid solutions. In addition, the Darken–Gurry diagrams are applied to qualitatively assess the solid solubility of dopants, which comprehensively consider the influence of geometry factors and electronegativity (±0.4) on solubility.116
As shown in Fig. 6(a) and Table 3, the analysis of binary silica-based systems is presented by using the Hume–Rothery rules, indicating that P, As, Al, Ga, Ni, Co, Ge, Cu, Fe and Cr have larger solid solubility as substitutional impurities and H can enter interstitial sites of the Si lattice, ignoring the effect of valence electron concentration and the relative price.

Similarly, we assess solubility of dopants in perovskite materials by using the Hume–Rothery rules. However, perovskites are ionic crystals, and the model needs to be modified to accommodate the perovskites. We reasonably adopt the ionic radius to replace the atomic radius and critical atomic ratio (δ) of interstitial solid solution modifies to 0.434, the radius ratio of tetrahedral and octahedral gaps.
As shown in Fig. 6(b) and Table 4, Sn2+, Ag+, Bi3+ and Hg2+ fall into the ellipse with the center of the Pb cation, indicating that those cations have unlimited solubility in perovskites as substitutional impurities. Taking the relative valence effect into account, Ag+ and Bi3+ may have limited solubility in perovskite. Be2+ has a smaller ionic radius than 62% of the radius of Pb2+ to form the interstitial impurities.

The same analysis is applied to X-site doping in perovskites, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and Table 5. Br− can be infinitely substituted for I− in perovskites, which has been reported in the literature.117–119 Surprisingly, S2− and Se2− also fall into the ellipse with the center of I−, which is rarely studied in PSCs. Theoretically, I− can be replaced by S2− and/or Se2−, which acts as acceptors and realizes p-type doping. In this respect, sulfides and selenides have the potential to be used as p-type dopants in halide perovskite materials.

Darken–Gurry diagram considers the main parameters of metal doping, which can be used for rapid screening of possible electronic dopants. However, it may fail in complex systems. DFT calculation was developed to evaluate the doping effects of semiconductors quantitatively.115 And the influences of secondary phases must be considered, if impurities could form strong bonds with the host elements. To avoid the formation of secondary phases between the dopants and the host elements, the chemical potentials μ should be limited,115 nμA + mμX ≤ ΔHf (AnXm),(9)where A and X are the host and doping elements, respectively. ΔHf (AnXm) is the formation energy of AnXm. If the host (AB) is composed of elements A and B, an additional limited formula needs to be added,115 nμB + mμX ≤ ΔHf (BnXm).(10)
Take the Na-doped CdTe as an example, Fig. 7(b) plots the calculated chemical potential region accessible under equilibrium growth condition, as defined by eqn (9) and (10).120 Na can form a very stable compound Na2Te with Te, with a calculated formation energy of −2.84 eV. To avoid the formation of Na2Te, μNa should be limited in a certain range. Under Te-rich conditions (μTe = 0, μCd = ΔHf(CdTe) = −0.79 eV), Na2Te is easy to form, which has a lowest chemical potential of −1.42 eV. Under the Cd-rich conditions (μCd = 0, μTe = ΔHf (CdTe) = −0.79 eV), Na2Te is difficult to form with a high chemical potential of −1.02 eV. When μTe varies between −0.79 eV and 0, μNa changes between −1.42 eV and −1.02 eV. Beyond these chemical potential limits, Na2Te will be formed, and the doping process will stop, as shown in the yellow area of Fig. 7(b).


3.3.2 Ionization probability. 
For the impurity level, each energy level can contain two electrons with opposite spin directions, while the donor and acceptor impurity levels can only be: (1) occupied by one electron with either spin direction, or (2) be empty. According to Fermi–Dirac probability function, the ionization probability of the donors and acceptors without considering self-compensating effects can be obtained: (11) (12)where ηD and ηA are the ionization probability of the donors and acceptors, fD(E) and fA(E) are the density of electrons and holes occupying the impurity level, respectively, ED and EA are the energy of the donor and acceptor levels, respectively, and gD and gA are called degeneracy factors, which are a direct result of the spin factor. For Ge, Si and GaAs semiconductor materials, gD = 2 and gA = 4.


3.3.3 Self-compensation. 
Ideally, charged defects need to be compensated by the opposite charge carriers (electrons or holes) to keep a strict stoichiometric ratio. However, the stoichiometric ratio of some compounds varies with the change of the surrounding atmosphere and the partial pressure.90,121 It is possible to compensate the ionized impurity charges by intrinsic defects instead of the opposite charge carriers.
Take the Bi3+ doping in perovskite as an example. The ideal defect reaction equation (based on positive ions) can be described as follows: (13)where  represents the Bi atom that occupies the Pb lattice site.
However, negatively charged defects may be compensated by localized positive charges, (14) (15) (16)where ,  and  represent I interstitial, MA vacancy and Pb vacancy, respectively. Side reactions (reaction (14)–(16)) compete with the desired reaction (reaction (13)), which reduces majority carrier concentration. The reaction coefficient depends on the defect formation energy (Section 4), that is, the defect's intrinsic characteristics and the position of EF.
Si and GaAs have large formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects, and their side reactions can hardly proceed.122,123 The doping concentration can be presumed to be equal to the majority carrier concentration. However, the side reactions are significant for CdTe due to the low formation energy of Te vacancy.12,124 The increase in the hole concentration from doping can be neutralized by self-doping (Te vacancy), indicating a serious self-compensation effect. Also, the incorporation of the donor (acceptor) will cause the upshift (downshift) of EF, leading to the formation energy decrease of the negatively (positively) charged defect, which further facilitates self-compensating. In addition, the formation of the AX center, which is an acceptor-induced defect that acts as a donor, can also compensate the doping effect (for example, As-doped CdTe, Fig. 8).125
 Fig. 8  Formation energies of AsTe, AX-center, VCd−AsCd and VCd−AsTe under Cd-rich (a) and Te-rich (b) conditions. Reproduced from ref. 125 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright 2017. 
The self-compensation remains a challenge for efficient electronic doping in certain materials. Unfortunately, the halide perovskite materials with a “soft lattice” exhibit low defect formation energy (Section 4), which probably leads to a strong self-compensation effect. The investigation of the self-compensating effect and the modulating strategies in halide perovskite materials are still lack. The control of self-compensating effect is the key to applying atomic doping on semiconductor photovoltaic materials featuring weak chemical bonds and soft lattices.

4. Self-doping
Different from the conventional PVs materials with strong chemical bonding, halide perovskite materials have weak ionic and secondary bonding, which makes it easy to modulate the electronic doping.40,126,127 However, the “soft” nature and low defect formation energy of this new-generation PV materials may lead to the severe compensation effects from the intrinsic defects, leading to the challenge of efficiently and reliably tuning the carrier density.51,128 In addition, typical physical doping approaches, which have been widely adopted in conventional PVs, like ion implantation, may cause severe crystal damage in halide perovskites.129 Therefore, chemical doping strategies should be developed according to the material features. New deposition approaches, which can tune the materials properties by the easy chemical methods, are required, such as controlling the stoichiometric ratio in precursor solution for manipulating the intrinsic defect properties (self-doping, Section 4) and introducing dopants (in precursor solution and/or surface modification) to collect/donate electron from/to the semiconductor. (molecular doping, Section 5).
4.1 Doping mechanism
In an ideal crystal, the ordered arrangement of atoms in a crystal extends indefinitely in three dimensions strictly and periodically. However, the crystal growth is always flawed. Frenkel and Schottky defects are the two types of intrinsic point defects in ionic crystals. Take NaCl as an example, ions might be transferred from the normal position to the interstitial site nearby or the crystal surface, as shown in Fig. 9(b) and (c). The reaction in NaCl crystal can be written as follows: (17) (18)where ,  and  represent Na interstitial, Na vacancy and Cl vacancy, respectively. In reality, some non-stoichiometric compounds, whose composition deviates obviously from stoichiometric composition depending on the atmosphere and pressure, will become n-type and p-type semiconductors. Still, take NaCl as example (Fig. 9(d)–(f)), the doping reactions are as follows: (19) (20) (21)
 Fig. 9  Schematic diagram of perfect and defective lattices of an ionic crystal. (a) Perfect lattice. (b)–(f) defective lattices. Frenkel (b) and Schottky (c) defects, cation vacancy (d), anion vacancy (e), and cation-interstitial (f). 
In short, if the defect is negatively charged (cation vacancy or anion interstitial), the concentrations of electron and negatively charged defects are suppressed and the concentrations of hole and positively charged defects are augmented, which leads to p-type doping. The opposite is true for positively charged dopants (anion vacancy or cation interstitial).
4.2 Doping strategy

4.2.1 Conventional solar cell. 
CdTe solar cells have lower doping efficiency and higher non-radiative electron–hole recombination rates than Si owing to their defect physics.72,130–132 By controlling the growth conditions, the composition of CdTe could be off-stoichiometric and EF could be modulated (Fig. 10).12 VTe has a low formation energy, which is the dominating defect type in CdTe films. Ionized VTe can offer unbounded electrons, which can induce heavy n-type doping. VCd is an intrinsic acceptor defect, whose level is deep and located at the level of ∼0.4 eV higher than the VB according to DFT calculations.72,133,134 In principle, higher hole concentrations can be achieved by reducing the Cd/Te ratio under CdTe growth conditions. However, DFT calculations show that the hole density is always limited below ∼1015 cm−3, regardless of the growth temperature or conditions, owing to the relatively deep VCd acceptor level.72 Non-equilibrium growth strategies, such as quenching from high temperature to room temperature, have been used to further enhance the doping efficiency.12 In addition, extrinsic acceptor dopants need to be used when a heavy p-type doping for CdTe is required.
 Fig. 10  Formation energy of intrinsic point defects in CdTe under different growth conditions. The formation energy of intrinsic point defects is dependent on whether CdTe is grown under Te-rich (a) or Cd-rich (b) conditions. Reproduced from ref. 12 with permission from American Physical Society, copyright 2014. 
CIGS solar cells can be self-doped for p-type by intrinsic defects. The VCu has a low formation energy associated with a shallow acceptor level for p-type doping.135–137 The relevant Kröger–Vink notation formula is shown as follows: (22)where  and  represent Cu perfect crystal and Cu vacancy, respectively. DFT calculations show that Cu antisites (CuIn and CuGa) substantially contribute to p-type doping.17,138 Although CuIn and CuGa may have a deeper acceptor level than VCu, they were predicted to be more abundant in CIGS thin films only under Cu-rich conditions. Other antisite defects, such as InCu and GaCu, have deep donor levels that would trap electrons.135,136 Moreover, defect–defect interactions occur and form defect complexes in CIGS. VCu tends to interact with antisite defects, turning the deep-level defects into electrically benign defect complexes with shallow energy levels. The VSe–VCu complex might act as either an acceptor or donor depending on the position of the EF in the bandgap.139
CZTS, CZTSe, and CZTSSe are the emerging PV technologies due to their environmental friendly nature, abundance, and promising PCEs.140–142 Similar to the above thin-film PV materials, they have high defect density due to their low defect formation energy and complex component. Take CZTS as an example, the Cu, Zn and Sn cations have similar coordination environments, so sublattice cation disorders are commonly observed in this material. Compared with CIGS, CZTS has a larger number of antisite defects as it is easier for Cu to replace the group IIA (Zn) elements than the group IIIA elements (In and Ga).19,140,143 Similarly, CZTS has a mass of charge-compensated defect complexes, such as VCu–ZnCu, VZn–SnZn and CuSn–SnCu. which may passivate deep donor levels and decrease the hole concentration.19,140,143–145 Owing to the “soft” lattice and low defect formation energy, the formation of different types of defects in CTZS materials is highly dependent on their atomic chemical potentials, thus the carrier concentration of CTZS can be controlled by modulating the growth conditions (Fig. 11).19 Experimental investigation also suggests that CZTS is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor. The competitive acceptor defects, CuZn and VCu, may be responsible for the self-doping of CZTS. CuZn has a low formation energy under Cu-rich conditions, which contributes free holes to the VB. While under Cu-poor conditions, the VCu contributes more to hole concentrations.19,140,146

4.2.2 Perovskite solar cells. 
Different from the above thin film solar cells, the synthesis/processing of halide perovskite films is mostly based on the solution methods.126 Various interactions of multiple perovskite ions and the polar aprotic solvents in solution environment offer more abundant chemical pathways to nucleation and crystallization, such as clusters of intermediate (adducts and complexes).147 Compared with the classic nucleation process based on the physical approach, it provides an almost endless chemical space to tailor material properties (Fig. 12).148 However, it also brings challenges for reliable and controllable doping. Composition, atmosphere, solvent, and additives must be carefully controlled for reproducibly modulating the carrier concentration of halide perovskites.51,128

4.2.2.1 Lead-base halide perovskites. 
Due to the “soft” lattice and weak chemical bonds, halide perovskite materials have a high defect density (>1016 cm−3), and their carrier concentration can be regulated by defect concentration. There are many types of defects in perovskite materials (Fig. 13), and we take the point defects of MAPbI3 as a model. All the possible point defects are considered in MAPbI3 including three vacancies (VMA, VPb, and VI), three interstitials (MAi, Pbi, and Ii), two cation substitutions (MAPb and PbMA), and four anti-site substitutions (MAi, Pbi, IMA, and IPb), whose energy levels and formation energy are shown in Fig. 14(a).25,141,149–151 The total energy change (ΔE) between a pristine crystal and defective crystal, the atomic chemical potentials (μi), and the EF together determine the defect formation energy as well as the type of doping.115

Composition engineering, such as changing the PbI2/MAI ratio in the precursor solution, is one proper way to change the atomic chemical potentials and realizes self-doping in perovskite preparation (Table 6). It shows that PbI2-rich films are n-type and PbI2-deficient films are p-type doping (Fig. 14(b)).152 When the MAI/PbI2 ratio is much larger than 1, the formed perovskite may possess a lot of Pb vacancies due to the deficiency of PbI2, which increases the hole concentration for p-type doping (Fig. 14(c)).150 A similar analysis could also be applied to the PbI2-rich film. In addition, the composition engineering can be also applied to other perovskite materials, such as FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, to modulate self-doping.153–155

The atmosphere also determines the atomic chemical potential, which plays an important role in the self-doping of perovskites (Table 6). The evolution of EF of perovskite on TiO2 and PEDOT:PSS in different atmospheres is probed by SPV measurements, indicating that the EF varies with the atmosphere and the deposited substrate.156 Oxygen and water molecules in air could form superoxide or a hydrate phase, which may be the origin of the EF shift.157–159 The “self-healing” effect, moving EF to the mid bandgap, is also reported in the perovskite crystal structure restoration.157 Oxygen and water initially adsorbed in the film may desorb in high vacuum, which restores the initial defective crystal structure and makes EF drastically upshift.160 The sample will reabsorb water and oxygen, and EF will be restored gradually when stored in the air. However, the initial states cannot be fully recovered due to the formation of the hydrate phase on the perovskite surface, and prevent the oxygen diffusion into the film. Heating the sample, instead, could restore the EF completely, in which the water–film barrier on the surface was fully evaporated, resulting in the intercalation of oxygen into the bulk.156
The iodine pressure also influences the electrical properties of perovskites (Table 6). It is proposed that, with the increase of the partial pressure of I2, the concentration of VI decreases and the concentration of VMA increases. This results in an increase in the concentration of holes and a decrease in the concentration of electrons.86,161 This model needs to be verified by experiment results, especially the transition from p- to n-type electronic conductivity at a certain iodine pressure. And indeed, this occurrence was experimentally observed when exposing the samples to an I2 sink.162
The different decomposition rates between PbI2 and organic cations also lead to the self-doping of perovskite. The formation energy of Schottky defects can be calculated by applying the law of mass action to the decomposition reaction. The calculated results showed that MAI had a remarkably low Schottky defect formation energy (0.08 eV) compared with that of PbI2 (0.22 eV) and MAPbI3 (0.14 eV), thereby making the MAI and PbI2 ratio deviate from the stoichiometric ratio during decomposition.163 The annealing process can exacerbate non-stoichiometry and thus the self-doping process (Table 6). Perovskite films with a precursor ratio (PbI2:MAI) of 0.3 had an EF of 0.08 eV below the middle bandgap, indicating weak p-doping properties. After annealing at 150 °C for 45 min, the perovskite films were converted from weak p-type to heavily n-type doping, whose EF moved up to 0.25 eV below the CBM.150 Furthermore, annealing temperature was a key factor in regulating the initial defect state of the MAPbI3 thin film (Fig. 14(d)).164 The EF of the perovskite film was 0.35 eV above the VBM without annealing, indicating a p-type doping film. By increasing the annealing temperature from 60 °C to 100 °C, the EF shifted upwards, and the doping type changed from the p-type to the intrinsic type. After further increasing the annealing temperature to 150°C, the EF located at 0.53eV below the CBM, showing obvious n-type doping properties.
Solvent and adduct intermediated processes are vital to solution processing, which determinate the chemical reaction path and film quality, such as perovskite composition, grain boundaries and defect densities, and thus the carrier concentration. The chemical properties (the enthalpy of solvation and Mayer bond order) of typically used solvents for perovskite fabrication in solution processing are listed in Table 7.165 The dissolution of PbI2 in solvents involves the interaction between the lone pair electrons of the solvent/additive and the Pb atoms, whose strength affects the path of the chemical reactions, mainly the intermediate phases (the adducts, complexes, clusters or colloidal particles).166,167 Many intermediate phases, i.e., PbI2·DMF, PbI2·2DMSO, MAI·PbI2·DMF, and (MA)2Pb3I8·2DMSO, have been investigated, which are crucial for modulating the nucleation and crystallization processes.168–172 In the future, electrical property modulation of perovskite materials needs to be intensively investigated for efficient and stable optoelectronic device design with the focus on precursor chemistry.

4.2.2.2 Tin-based halide perovskite. 
Although lead-based perovskites have achieved impressive development, the toxicity of Pb limits their commercialized applications. Therefore, lead-free perovskite materials are proposed and developed.109,113 So far, various perovskite materials based on halide single and double perovskites have been studied, such as the substitution of Pb by Sn, Bi, Sb, Ge, and Cu.176 Theories and experiments have shown that the tin-based perovskites are the most promising candidates as alternatives due to their similar outer electronic configuration (ns2 np2) and ionic radius.177 However, the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ results in heavy p-type doping and high background hole densities, aggravating the SRH recombination processes and limiting the efficiency of the corresponding solar cells.108,178,179
DFT calculations showed that VSn dominated among all point defects under I-rich and Sn-poor conditions. So, most tin-based perovskites, such as CsSnI3, FASnI3 and MASnI3, showed heavy p-doping properties.51 Other studies suggested that bulk Sn4+ spontaneously transforms into Sn2+, which released two holes to the VB and is responsible for p-doping of perovskites (Fig. 15(a)).110 Although the doping mechanism of tin-based perovskite is still controversial, increasing the content of Sn2+ in the precursor solution has been proved to be an effective way to reduce the hole concentration.

Reducing agents can be used to convert Sn4+ to Sn2+ in tin-based perovskites during the solution process. Initially, excess Sn powder is used in a perovskite precursor solution to restore Sn4+:180 Sn4+ + Sn → 2Sn2+.(23)
Gu et al. demonstrated that after adding the Sn power, the color of SnI2 precursor solution turned from dark red to light yellow, indicating that the comproportionation reaction (eqn (23)) occurred. Except for excess Sn powder, a highly chemical selective organosilicon reductant, TMDHP, was added into the precursor solution to restore SnF2 to Sn(0) nanoparticles (Fig. 15(b)), which was reported to eliminate the residual Sn4+ impurities and get Sn(IV)-free perovskite films.181 By adding 1 mol% TMDHP, the Sn4+ on the surface and in the bulk of the film was reduced by 10% and ∼100%, respectively. Similarly, Sn powders can also reduce Sn4+ in mixed Sn–Pb perovskites.182 After adding Sn powders, the MA0.3FA0.7Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 precursor solution can keep the color unchanged in ambient air for 2 weeks.
Apart from Sn power and organosilicon reductant, ionic reducing agents were also applied to tin-based perovskites. Reductants, such as AHP and HPA, were adopted to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. It thus reduced VSn density and consequently improved the VOC and PCE of PSCs substantially.183,184 Recently, a new reductant with higher reducibility, hydrazine (N2H4), was used to provide a reducing atmosphere by spin-coating the hydrazine solution on the substrates, which can suppress the formation of the A2SnI6 phase via the possible redox reaction path (Fig. 15(c) and (d)),185 N2H4 + 2SnI62− → 2SnI42− + N2 + 4HI.(24)
As a consequence, the Sn4+/Sn2+ ratios were reduced by ∼20% compared to the device without N2H4 treatment. However, N2H4 was sufficient enough to reduce Sn2+ to metallic Sn, which could further destroy the perovskite lattice. Therefore, the hydrazinium chloride (N2H5Cl) salt, with a moderate reducibility together with SnF2, was adopted to prevent the overreduction of Sn2+.186
In addition, Sn source supplement was another effective method to attenuate or to eliminate self-doping of Sn4+. The increase of Sn2+ concentration effectively decreased the concentration of VSn defects, avoiding the transformation of the perovskites to heavy p-type doping.187
SnF2, which was first reported in CsSnI3, has been proved to be an effective additive to prevent the heavy p-doping from self-doped Sn4+.188 By adding 20% SnF2, the hole density measured by Hall and capacitance measurements decreased from ∼1019 to ∼1017 cm−3.189 This result was also confirmed by TA measurements, in which the hole concentration of CsSnI3 increased from >5.7 × 1017 cm−3 to ∼2.8 × 1016 cm−3 after the introduction of 20 mol% SnF2.190 Surprisingly, reducing the background hole density through SnF2 is also effective to other tin-based perovskite materials.111,191–194 For example, the hole density of FASnI3 decreased from 2.2 × 1020 cm−3 to 7.2 × 1018 cm−3 with the addition of 10 mol% of SnF2. In addition to SnF2, other Sn halides, such as SnCl2, were also demonstrated to reduce VSn effectively.195,196 Similar to SnF2, the SnCl2 additive could offer a Sn-rich environment to restrain the generation of VSn.
Halide perovskite films are mostly fabricated via solution process, and the chemical interactions, such as the Lewis acid–base coordination and hydrogen bonding interaction in perovskite precursors, are vitally important for defect density and electronic doping of perovskite devices. Additives can form intermediates with SnI2 to regulate the defect density and self-doping of the resultant film. AA was introduced into MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 precursor solutions, whose CC double bonds can quench the singlet oxygen to avoid the oxidization of Sn2+.197 In addition, TP can suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in CsPb0.5Sn0.5I2Br perovskite solution as the hydroxybenzene groups act as an antioxidant.198 Besides, SnI2–TP–PbI2 composites based on the coordination between the ester group and metal ions can improve crystallization and film quality.
Moreover, solvent for precursor solution is critical for device fabrication. DMF and DMSO mixtures are the common solvents for high-efficiency tin-based perovskite device fabrication. However, DMSO can oxidize Sn2+ to Sn4+, which might be the primary source of tin oxidation in the precursor solution.199,200 New solvents or solvent mixtures need to be explored for preparing high-performance and stable tin-based perovskites. Thirteen solvents have been examined in the fabrication of FASnI3 (Fig. 16).201 Considering the solubility, stability (no Sn2+ oxidation) and the “perovskite-ability” (i.e., the possibility to form the perovskite structure) (Table 8), novel solvent system, which included a DEF:DMPU mixture was proposed, and the solar cell performance was improved compared with the one based on DMSO solvent.

4.3 Doping efficiency

4.3.1 Method of calculation. 
In modern first-principles calculation, the defect formation energy ΔHf(α,q) can be expressed as a function of three factors: (1) the total energy change (ΔE) between a pristine crystal and defective crystal, (2) the atomic chemical potentials μi, and (3) the electron Fermi energy EF:115,202–204 (25)where . E(host) is the total energy of the host for the same supercell in the absence of the defect. ni is the number of elements, E(i) is the elemental solid/gas energy, q is the number of electrons transferred from the supercell to the reservoirs in forming the defect cell, and εVBM is the defect transition energy level. Combined with the formula and the boundary conditions for charge neutrality (the total charge of electrons and negatively charged defects equals the total charge of holes and positively charged defects), the defect formation energies and the equilibrium concentrations of charge carriers can be calculated self-consistently.205


4.3.2 Doping limit rule. 
Under equilibrium growth conditions, there are some thermodynamic limits of the chemical potentials (μi). First, to avoid precipitation of the host elements, a negative μi must be satisfied:115 μi ≤ 0(26)
Second, to maintain a stable host, take binary compounds (AB) for example, μi are bounded by:115 μA + μB = ΔHf(AB),(27)where ΔHf(AB) is the formation enthalpy of AB. Finally, to exclude the possible secondary phases (AnBm) of host elements, μi should be limited by:115 nμA + mμB ≤ ΔHf(AnBm)(28)
Take MAPbI3 as an example, the existence of MAPbI3 without secondary phases of MAI and PbI2 should satisfy the later equations under thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions:206 μMA + μPb + 3μI = ΔHf(MAPbI3)(29) μMA + μI ≤ ΔHf(MAI)(30) μPb + 2μI ≤ ΔHf(PbI2)(31)

Fig. 17(a) plots the calculated chemical potential region accessible under equilibrium growth conditions for MAPbI3, as defined by eqn (29)–(31).25 The narrow but long region marked in red color is the thermodynamic stable range for the equilibrium growth of MAPbI3, which indicates the growth conditions that can be used to tune the n-type/p-type properties of the materials.

Defects with much high formation energies are displayed as dashed lines. Reproduced from ref. 25 with permission from AIP Publishing, copyright 2014. 
In addition, the above equations can be used to deduce the formation energies of intrinsic defects at different points in the phase diagram. Fig. 17(b)–(d) show the formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects in MAPbI3 calculated at three different points, I (I-rich/Pb-poor), II (moderate), and III (I-poor/Pb-rich) in the phase diagram.25 The formation energies of the considered point defects are listed in Table 9. Also, the equilibrium carrier concentration and EF in self-doping can be obtained.

5 Molecular doping
New-generation semiconductor materials have been developed with low-cost, and solution-processability, and the corresponding devices exhibit unique mechanical, optoelectronic, and chemical properties. Different from the classical electronic doping strategy (atomic doping), the solution process enables a new electronic doping strategy, the molecular doping. The molecular dopants can be designed and customized through heteroatom substitution (such as F4TCNQ and F6TCNQ) and structural modifications.24,207,208 Furthermore, the distribution, diffusion, and concentration of the dopants in the semiconductor precursor solution and films can be precisely controlled to modulate the electronic properties of the material.207,209
5.1 Doping mechanisms
The mechanism of molecular doping is illustrated in Fig. 18 by comparing the energy level differences between perovskites and dopants. The dopants possess unoccupied and/or occupied molecular orbitals for electrons. As shown in Fig. 18, if the LUMO level of the molecular dopant (e.g. F4TCNQ) is near the VB of the semiconductor (perovskite), electrons will transfer from the VB of semiconductors to the empty electron acceptor, leaving holes in the semiconductor. As a result, the doped molecules become negatively charged and build up a space–charge layer with semiconductors. This process in turn raises the LUMO and HOMO (or electrochemical potential) of the molecule till thermodynamic equilibrium. If the HOMO of the molecular dopant (e.g. CoCp2) is higher than the CB of semiconductors, electrons will transfer from the dopant to semiconductors, resulting in n-type doping.
 Fig. 18  Simplified model of the semiconductor doping process exemplified by the halide perovskite doped with F4TCNQ or CoCp2. 
However, to establish a model to predict the free charge density qualitatively, the interaction between electrons must be considered.210,211 Take the p-type doping as an example, the IE is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an isolated atom or molecule. And the EA is the amount of energy liberated when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule. They are referenced to the vacuum level, so the value IEsemiconductor − EA-dopant represents the free energy for electrons to transfer between molecules and the semiconductor. Moreover, the distance between electrons and holes is quite short, thus the electronic interaction between dopants and the semiconductor can’t be ignored. Considering the electronic interaction, the energy of an ion pair can be written as follows:212 (32)where δ is the degree of charge transfer, k is Coulomb's constant, e is the electric charge, and r is the distance between the electron and the hole. The value of δ which minimizes E(δ) determines the amount of charge transferred.
In addition to the ion pairs, the dopants and semiconductor may form CTCs by the hybridization of an unoccupied orbital from an acceptor and an occupied frontier molecular orbital from a donor, resulting in the creation of new local HOMO and LUMO levels.213–215 Electrons rearrange in the new hybrid orbitals, and both molecular dopants and the semiconductor share the charge, so fractional charge transfer may occur between the semiconductor and dopants in the CTCs.24

5.2.1 Bulk molecular doping. 
Benefiting from the chemical processability and hybrid features of halide perovskite materials, molecular doping has been successfully applied. Molecular additives have various chemical interactions/bonding with the solvent/perovskite, so they can adjust the crystallinity, regulate the orientation and stress, and form doping gradients. More importantly, the properties of molecular dopants can be easily tuned through heteroatom substitution and molecular design, which provide endless approach to manipulating the electronic doping.
Variety of molecules have been studied as dopants in organic semiconductors. Fig. 19 and Table 10 show the molecular structure and energy level of the commonly used p-dopants. TCNQ, a quinone material with a conjugated structure, can form charge transfer salts with electron donor molecules.209,216–218 The resulting organic salts showed an increased conductivity of up to 1010, which was a big progress in this field.216

Nevertheless, the EA (−4.23 eV) of TCNQ is not sufficient to effectively withdraw the electrons from most OPV materials.24,219 Introducing an electron withdrawing group into the dopant molecule, such as fluorine, –CF3 or nitrile groups, has been proposed to raise its EA. A series of derivatives based on the parent compound TCNQ have been synthesized for organic semiconductor doping, as shown in Fig. 19. Fluorine is the conventional electron withdrawing group to exchange the hydrogen in TCNQ. Interestingly, the EA of TCNQ does not showing a linear relationship with the replacing number of fluorine.219 For example, the estimated values of EA of F2TCNQ and F4TCNQ are −5.03 and −5.2 eV, respectively.220,221
Nitrile groups, a stronger electron withdrawing group compared with fluorine, was used to further increase the EA. The F2HCNQ, in which two fluorines are substituted by nitrile groups, showed a higher EA, which was ∼0.4 eV higher than that of F4TCNQ.216,222 In addition, with six fluorine groups, the EA of F6TCNNQ, was further elevated to −5.60 eV.219,223,224
DDQ was also widely used as a p-dopant. Though its EA was lower than that of TCNQ,24 the DDQ had high solubility with good processability, leading to easy and efficient doping.225–227 In contrast, HAT-CN had poor solution processability due to its larger and rigid planar structure.228 However, comparing with the above micromolecule dopants, HAT-CN was relatively stable without noticeable diffusion. The success of DDQ and HAT-CN utilization has encouraged the development of higher EA molecular dopants. With an EA of −5.87 eV, CN6-CP has become the strongest p-type dopant in the recent literature for OPV.227,229,230 Although this neutral molecule has been reported to be insoluble and highly reactive, they appeared to be stable and soluble when mixed with conductive polymers, such as the PDPP(6-DO)2TT, in CH2Cl2. And the conductivity of PDPP(6-DO)2TT was promoted from 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1 to 30–70 Ω−1 cm−1 after doping by CN6-CP.230
The organo-metal dopant, Mo(tfd)3, with a high EA of −5.37 eV and air stability, has also been investigated.231–233 However, due to the poor solubility in solutions, it can only be processed by using vacuum deposition.24 To improve its solubility that enabled the solution process and prevented the unwanted diffusion, structural modifications were adopted. Substituting the nitrile functional groups with either methyl or octyl esters was applied to increase the solubility. For, example, Mo(tfd-CO2Me)3 has an improved solubility, which is 20 times higher than that of Mo(tfd)3.234,235 Similarly, a series of F4TCNQ analogues, with nitrile functional groups substituted by either methyl or octyl esters, showed an increased solubility of more than 100 times higher and without change in EA.236 According to these molecular design principles, a high EA soluble molecular dopant, TMCN3-CP, was proposed and synthesized.208 And groups like –CN3 and –COCF3 were also applied to increase the solubility of dopants.208,209 The F4-R-TCNQ was synthesized to adjust its diffusion properties by replacing the nitrile with the tailorable ester group, which significantly increases the dopants’ solubility and reduces its diffusion rate in the OPV layer.24 We expect that tremendous efforts need to be devoted for customizing the molecular dopants such as Mo(tfd-R)3, F3-R-TCNQ, and F4-RTCNQ to enable a controllable solution processability.
To minimize the diffusion of the dopants in the composite film, three-dimensional (3D) dopants were proposed, such as the C60 molecules. Replacing the hydrogen atoms with the electron-adsorbing fluorine atoms in C60 molecules increases the EA, tuning the C60 molecules to a p-dopant and derivatives such as C60F36 and C60F48 were synthesized.237,238 With higher EA than that of F4TCNQ, they showed excellent stability against thermal diffusion in experiments. However, due to their poor solubility, they can only be processed under vacuum deposition. Meanwhile, 3D structure dopants occupy a large volume in OPV layers, limiting the doping energy levels. And their large size could prevent them from being inserted into the crystalline lattice, except for the amorphous materials with a loosen structure.239,240
In the early stage, the n-type dopants used for organic semiconductors were atomic dopants.241 However, the atomic dopants are easy to diffuse, limiting the stability and commercial applications of OPV devices. In principle, n-type dopants with a low HOMO level (2.8–3.6 eV) could achieve a high doping efficiency for OPV.207 The widely used n-type molecular dopants and their energy levels are shown in Fig. 20 and Table 10. Organometallic dopants, with strong electron-donating properties, such as mesitylene pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ruthenium dimer (RuCp*mes)2, dimers of rhodocene, (RhCp2)2, and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl cyclopentadienyl rhodium dimer, (RhCp*Cp)2, are widely used as n-type molecular dopants.209,242,243 Besides, metallic sandwich compounds, such as CoCp2 and CoCp*2, were also used as n-type dopants, but they are unstable when exposed to air or water.244–246 The metal sandwich dimers, which cleaved upon doping, can resolve the air-instability issues. And the dimer can extended the storage lifetime of the dopant, providing a strategy for stabilizing the low IE dopants.247–249 It needs to be reminded that with the increase of EA, strong P dopants are difficult to be stabilized.230
 Fig. 20  Molecular structures of common n-type molecular dopants. 
Bulk molecular doping was also investigated in perovskite solar cells. F4TCNQ was doped in the perovskite film by solid diffusion via heating the F4TCNQ powder on MAPbI3, which modified the ITO/perovskite interface and enabled a HTL-free PSC device. After F4TCNQ doping, the device efficiency was significantly improved, from 11.0% to 20.2%.29 F4TCNQ was also used to modulate the electronic properties of CsPbI3 perovskites.250 After incorporating F4TCNQ into the perovskite nanocrystals, the hole mobility was improved from 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the conductivity was enhanced by 250%. However, benzyl viologen or cobaltocene dopants significantly reduce the conductivity owing to their n-dope effect on the CsPbI3 perovskite, resulting in the increasing of hole injection barriers. Besides, DMBI derivatives were introduced into MAPbI3 materials, which upshifted the EF by 520 meV, leading to n-type doping.251 Furthermore, the molecular dopants that are used in OPV can also be applied to PSCs given the composition and “soft” nature of perovskites; however, intensive studies are needed.


5.2.2 Surface transfer doping. 
Surface transfer doping relies on the electron exchange between a semiconductor and dopants situated at its surface, which is a meritorious doping strategy for nondestructive doping of “soft” semiconductors.254 For the conventional doping process as ion implantation, the energetic ions may destroy the lattice of “soft” semiconductors.129 However, as a low cost method, the surface transfer doping avoids the utilization of energetic ions, which can effectively dope the semiconductors without lattice damage.
The molecular doping process and the schematic energy levels are illustrated in Fig. 21; dopants situated at the semiconductor surface could exchange electrons with the semiconductor, causing the electron or hole accumulation.
 Fig. 21  Schematic diagram of the surface transfer doping process. The band diagram of an intrinsic semiconductor (a), a semiconductor by p-type surface transfer doping (b), and a semiconductor by n-type surface transfer doping (c). 
QDs have a large surface-to-volume ratio, which can be utilized to control the passivation and net doping by surface ligands.255–257 Surface transfer doping in QDSC was first observed by Shim and Guyot-Sionnest in CdSe QDs.258 Through sodium biphenyl surface treatment, the CdSe QDs exhibited n-type doping due to the electron transfer from sodium biphenyl to the LUMO of colloidal semiconductor. It opened the door to a successful doping method for QDSC without atomic doping in the QD bulk. Moreover, other colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, such as CdS and ZnO, can also be modulated to n-type by sodium biphenyl.
The EA of the molecular dopants determines the type of surface transfer doping. For a metal–organic complex with deep EA, it can act as the p-dopants. As shown in Fig. 22(a), Mo(tfd-COCF3)3 is an oxidizing agent, which has a high EA and can accept electrons from the VB of QDs.233,243 When comparing its electrochemistry with that of Mo(tfd)3, Ni(tfd)2 was predicted to have an EA of 5.6 eV, which might also act as a p-dopant to oxidize QDs (Fig. 22(b)). Mo(PhBz-dt)3 with a lower EA (4.8 eV) compared to Mo(tfd)3 was being used as a weaker p-dopant (Fig. 22(c)).232

Meanwhile, the utilization of complexes (reductants) with a low effective IE may result in the shifting of EF towards the CB in QDs. (RuCp*mes)2, with an effective IE < 3.0 eV, donated electrons to the QDs, thus resulting in a strong n-type doping effect (Fig. 22(d)).242,259 Note that the molecular dopant concentration should be moderate, high doping concentrations might create larger surface dipoles, thus hindering the carrier transport.21
Organic PV materials are usually bonded via weak intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals interaction force, or electrostatic interactions, making it easier to introduce defects through the traditional doping process.129 Surface transfer doping has received broad interest as a ‘‘gentle” method for organic semiconductor doping. SAMs can be used to modify the surface of an organic semiconductor. By designing the functional groups (electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups), the direction of electron transfer between the semiconductor and molecules can be adjusted.260–262 CF3-SAM and 4-methyl-benzenethiol (CH3-SAM) are usually used to modify OPVs, e.g., CuPc.263–265 CF3-SAM has a strong electron withdrawing –CF3 group, making its HOMO level lower than that of CH3-SAM. After deposition of 30 Å CuPc on the SAM/Au(1 1 1), a larger downward vacuum level shift (−1.05 ± 0.05 eV) was observed on CF3-SAM/Au(1 1 1) compared to CH3-SAM/Au(1 1 1) (−0.25 ± 0.05 eV).
Other SAMs, such as FTS and OTS, were also used for surface modification of OPV materials.266 On exposure of organic molecular crystals to their SAMs, the surface conductivity of the organic crystals increases by four to five orders of magnitude for FTS, by about two orders of magnitude for fluoroalkyltriethoxysilane and by a factor of ten for OTS treatment. Organosilanes with a higher fluorine content have a stronger electron-withdrawing ability, which induce a higher conductivity and more effective p-type doping. Owing to solution processability, the surface transfer doping is also applied to tune the carrier concentration of PSCs via chemical approaches.
Transition metal oxides, such as MoO3, was a widely used p-dopant due to their deep-lying electronic energy states.267,268 With 64 Å of the n-type MoO3 (EA of about 6.7 eV) deposited upon MAPbI3, the energy levels of MoO3 shifted toward a lower binding energy by 0.30 eV, while the energy levels of MAPbI3 shifted toward a higher binding energy by 0.25 eV, indicating the electron transfer from MAPbI3 to MoO3.269 Mo4+ and Mo5+ oxidation states, with 3d5/2 binding energies at 230.1 eV and 232.0 eV respectively, appear in the XPS core level spectrum, revealing that a chemical reaction takes place at the perovskite/MoO3 interface.270,271 Furthermore, the DFT calculations showed that Mo–I covalent bonds and N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds were formed, leading to the increase of work function by ∼0.52 eV.272 Interestingly, the MAPbIBr2/MoO3 contact was revealed to form a hole–electron recombination region through in situ UPS and XPS measurements (Fig. 23(a)), which provided a new pathway for hole transfer.270 In addition to MoO3, other oxides, such as WO3 and V2O5, were expected to modulate the electronic characteristics of perovskites.

Small molecules such as the F16CuPc and HAT-CN are commonly used dopants in organic materials, while they can be deposited onto perovskites by physisorption or chemisorption.270 F16CuPc has a larger EA (∼4.7 eV) than MAPbIBr2, which can downshift the vacuum level of MAPbIBr2 by 0.7 eV (Fig. 23(b)). Compared to F16CuPc, HAT-CN is a stronger electron accepting molecule with a deep LUMO of 5.2 eV. However, the deep-lying HOMO level may mismatch energy levels and cause a high hole extraction barrier at the interface of MAPbIBr2/HAT-CN, which aggravated electron–hole recombination (Fig. 23(c)). Surprisingly, HAT-CN is a suitable electron accepting molecule for 2D perovskites due to their deep VB.273 Introducing HAT-CN molecules into 2D perovskites enabled the charge transfer between the 2D metal halide perovskites and HAT-CN, which was proved by the external quantum efficiency spectra. However, no charge transfer process was observed when the 2D perovskite contained large organic cations, such as phenethylammonium (PEA+), and the large cations may have prevented the contact between the 2D perovskite metal halide sheet and the HAT-CN molecule layer. Interestingly, the surface defect density of perovskites was greatly affected by doping. The reduction effect of surface band bending (0.16 eV) on a high defect density perovskite surface is much lower than that on a low defect density perovskite surface (0.60 eV) after the HAT-CN modification, which may be probably due to the Fermi level pinning effect by surface defects.274
In addition, FDC-2-5Cl with an electron-withdrawing pentachlorophenyl group was explored as acceptors and passivators (Fig. 23(d)).275 After the FDC-2-5Cl surface treatment by solution coating, a p-type doping surface occurred and a high PCE (21.16%) was achieved with an enhanced VOC of 1.14 V. Moreover, by using the spin-coating method an interfacial dipole layer was formed after F4TCNQ interface modification, and the electrons transferred from the perovskite to F4TCNQ, leaving positive charges in the perovskite side. The p-type doping enhanced the built-in electric field and increased the energy barrier to electron diffusion, improving the PCE from 15.3% to 18.1%.276
CoCp2 can be used as an n-type surface dopant to change electrical properties of perovskite thin films.277 By varying the depositing quantity of CoCp2, a tunable shift in the EF was observed, indicating that the interfacial energy levels could be controlled by surface transfer doping. HZ-TIPS and its homologue, OZ-TIPS, formed an interfacial dipole at the interface due to the van der Waals interaction between molecules and the first few layers of the CsPbBr3 surface. The HZ-TIPS/CsPbBr3 interfacial dipole made the energy band bend downward. However, the upward band bending occurred in the case of the OZ-TIPS/CsPbBr3 interface.278 In addition, polymeric materials, such as b-PEI, PVP, and PAA, were used for passivating the perovskite surfaces and changing the surface EF.279 Coordination bonds were formed between polymeric materials and the perovskite, because of the interaction between the lone electron pairs at N or O atoms and the empty orbits of Pb. Also, they prevented the water and oxygen from eroding the perovskites, thus improving the operational stability of the corresponding devices.
In addition, benefiting from the ionic nature of perovskites, the lead halide perovskite surface can convert to a thin, compact material layer through in situ reaction with selected ions, leading to carrier redistribution at the interface.280 The organic cations (MAI and FAI) are volatile, which can leave undercoordinated Pb2+ ions and/or PbI2 at the perovskite surface.281–283 Cationic species have been studied for their compensation or replacement of cation for elimination of surface defects. MAI and FAI are used to eliminate the surface lead iodide, which downshift the EF and reduces the inner series resistance from 30.77 Ω to 26.76 Ω.284 Recently, lead–sulfur bonds (Pb–S) were introduced at the perovskite/ETL interface through the chemical reaction between PbPyA2 and TMS, which upshifted the EF and offered a BSF for electron extraction, resulting in a PCE enhancement from 21.8% to 24.3% in inverted PSCs.285 Based on the ionic nature of perovskites, and with the endless space for chemical materials exploration, the chemical approaches, like ion exchange, in situ reaction, interfacial modification, etc., are the most prospective strategies for achieving controllable doping in the material and device design.

5.3 Doping efficiency
Molecular doping is achieved through electron transfer between the doping molecules and the semiconductor. When doping molecules are incorporated into the semiconductor, the doped molecules are generally in low concentration and dispersed in the semiconductor, which provide enough surface to donate/accept electrons within the semiconductor. For surface transfer doping, there is a high probability for the molecules within several monolayers to have electron exchanged at the semiconductor surface. With the increase of the thickness of the molecular layer, the probability for electron exchange between molecules and semiconductors is greatly reduced.

5.3.1 Doping efficiency of doped molecules. 
When acceptor molecules are used to modify semiconductor interfaces, the electrons transfer from the semiconductor to the acceptor due to the higher EA of the acceptor molecule. By only considering the monolayer of acceptor molecules that is directly in contact with the semiconductor, the distribution of electrons in the acceptor's molecular orbital follows the Fermi Dirac distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium:129 (33)where n and nA are the areal electron density and the density of surface acceptors, respectively. ΔE is the activation energy of acceptor molecules, which is a constant that equals the difference between EV and surface acceptors LUMO (ΦLUMO). US is the surface potential, which is equal to the difference between EV and EF of the semiconductors. US is variable, which is related with the hole density (ps) in the semiconductor and as a function of acceptor coverage nA.
In eqn (35), we set the degeneracy factor to 1, assuming that only one unoccupied LUMO state per molecule can accommodate an additional electron charge even in the case of a degenerate LUMO. This hypothesis is reasonable, because the electron–electron repulsion is very strong when more than one electron enter an isolated molecule.286,287
According to eqn (35), the doping efficiency (η) of the surface acceptors can be described as follows: (34)
Similarly, when the interface is modified with donor molecules, the doping efficiency of the surface donor is (35)
The relative position of the LUMO (HOMO) in doped molecules and EF in the semiconductor reflects the probability of the hole (electron) occupying the molecule energy level. When the LUMO level is much lower than the EF (EF − ΦLUMO ≫ kT), such as F4TCNQ, the doping efficiency is close to 100%, theoretically, and it is same for surface donors.


5.3.2 Doping efficiency for doped semiconductors. 
The first several layers of the semiconductor at the surface will generate an electric field when the semiconductor surface comes into contact with other materials or adsorbs molecules (charged ion). Driven by the electric field, electrons will be redistributed to form a space–charge region near the contact interface. The distribution of the electric field intensity and electrostatic potential in the space–charge region due to the existence of surface adsorbates or surface states can be obtained quantitatively by solving Poisson's equation.
Let us assume that the semiconductor surface is modified by acceptor molecules. For wide bandgap semiconductors, such as diamond, assuming that the semiconductor has unipolar transport characteristics (holes only), using the Boltzmann distribution, the ps on the semiconductor surface can be simply estimated as follows:288 (36)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, ε and ε0 are relative dielectric constant for semiconductor and vacuum permeability, respectively, and NV is the effective density of states for the VB.
It should be noted that eqn (38) is only applicable to non-degenerate cases (e.g. the VB of the semiconductor is below the EF). For acceptor molecules that have a low LUMO, such as F4TCNQ, the transfer of electrons between the semiconductor and the acceptor is significant, which may cause a large upward energy band bending that leads to the EF to fall below the VB at the surface. Thus, the semiconductor surface becomes degenerated, and the classical Boltzmann distribution is no longer applicable. Fermi distribution function is used as a step function to describe the areal hole density:288 (37)
It is important to emphasize that the above calculation of doping efficiency for semiconductors and dopant molecules is based on ideal conditions. In practice, the interaction between doping molecules and semiconductors is complex. The shape, size, orientation, concentration and the distribution of dopants and the solution processing techniques may affect the real carrier concentration. Also, doping may induce the formation of defects or defect complexes in semiconductors, which may locally compensate the charge and/or trap free charges. Moreover, the CTC state formation and coulombic binding of ion pairs can influence the distribution of charge carriers.
At present, it is difficult to predict the doping efficiency of molecular doping accurately. Future research needs to establish the quantitative relationship between doping concentration and carrier concentration, which may require improving chemical imaging and energetic mapping techniques. Also, new models, such as delocalized electronic states, are needed to understand how the dopant's orientation and shape affect the magnitude and delocalization of the disorder in the semiconductor. In addition, controllable solution processing techniques need to be developed, which can modulate the distribution, diffusion, and concentration of dopants within the semiconductor.
In conclusion, when dopants are atoms, the valence, radius, and electronegativity of the atoms determine bond formation and carrier generation. Generally, a negatively charged dopant leads to p-type doping, and the opposite is true for positively charged dopants. When dopants are molecules, the HOMO and LUMO levels of dopants determine the direction of electron transfer between semiconductors and dopants. Usually, a high EA molecule can accept electrons from the VB of a semiconductor for p-type doping and a low IE molecule gives electrons to the CB of a semiconductor for n-type doping. In addition, some semiconductors have low defect formation energy and high intrinsic defect density, showing the unusual defect physics of self-doping. If the intrinsic defect is effectively and negatively charged (cation vacancy or anion interstitial), the hole concentration increases, which leads to p-type doping. If the intrinsic defect is positively charged (anion vacancy or cation interstitial), it may show an intrinsic n-type semiconductor. It is expected to reveal new chemistry and physics in halide perovskites with defect profiles that are distinguished with conventional PV materials.

6. Effects of electronic doping
The essence of electronic doping is the redistribution of electrons in the CB and VB, which leads to macroscopic differences in conductivity, charge transport, carrier recombination, device performance, etc. The desired electrical characteristics of a semiconductor can be obtained through electronic doping, which further determines the performance of photovoltaic devices and related optoelectronic devices.
6.1 Conductivity
Under an electric field, charge carriers (electron and/or hole) can drift and contribute to the current, and their concentration determines the internal resistance of conventional PVs. Owing to the high intrinsic defect density and ionic behavior, facile migration of intrinsic defects of new-generation PV materials could also contribute to the current, especially for the perovskite material. According to different conducting mechanisms, conductors can be divided into ionic conductors, electronic conductors, and mixed conductors. Electronic conductors, such as metals, graphite, and metal compounds are conductive initiated from the movement of free electrons and no chemical changes occur during the conduction process. Similarly, the electrons in the CB of semiconductors flow along a direction driven by the electric field, which is also the electronic conduction. Ionic conductors, such as electrolyte solutions or molten electrolytes, rely on the oriented movement of ions (ion migration) to conduct electricity, which involve chemical changes. In ionic solids, the ionic conduction occurs mainly through the migration of ions through lattice defects. Previous studies proved that new-generation PV materials are mixed conductors, which have both ion and electron transport properties.289,290

6.1.1 Electronic conductivity. 
There are two kinds of charge carriers in semiconductors, the positively charged holes and the negatively charged electrons. These charge carriers can drift under an electric field and contribute to the current. The conductivity (σ) of the semiconductor can be expressed as follows:291 σ = nqμn + pqμp,(38)where n and p are the electron and hole concentration, respectively; q stands for elementary charge; and μn and μp stand for the migration rate of electrons and holes, respectively. There are no numerous differences in the order of magnitude between the electron mobility and hole mobility of semiconductor materials used in solar cells. As a result, carrier concentration is a key factor in determining the conductivity.
The conductivity of the semiconductor can be controlled by electronic doping. As previously discussed, electronic doping was first used in silicon semiconductors, and a continuous conductivity variation from 104 Ω cm−1 to 10−4 Ω cm−1 was achieved by changing the dopant (P or B) concentration from 1012 atoms per cm3 to 1021 atoms per cm−3.62 Cu is used for p-type doping in CdTe, and after adding 0.8 × 1015 Cu atoms per cm2 to a CdTe layer, an abrupt decrease in resistivity by three orders of magnitude and an increase in hole density from <1012 cm−3 to (3.8 ± 0.6) × 1014 cm−3 were achieved.73 Also, the conductivity of the perovskite crystal was increased from ∼10−8 Ω−1 cm−1 to ∼10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 after Bi doping.26 The same result could also be obtained in Bi-doped perovskite polycrystalline films, which increased from 3.02 × 10−6 to 9.76 × 10−6 cm−1 s−1.87 In addition, 0.5% Na doping significantly improved the electronic conductivity of the perovskite, from ∼10−7 Ω−1 cm−1 to ∼10−6 Ω−1 cm−1 for the MAPbI3.86
During the operation of photovoltaic devices, a depletion layer, also called Schottky barrier, is established at the contact interface due to their work function differences, which leads to a high resistance for photon-generated carrier, blocks carrier transport, and is harmful for device performance.5,51 The theoretical calculation indicates that the width of the depletion layer is inversely proportional to the doping concentration:292 (39)where εr and ε0 are the relative and vacuum permittivity of the semiconductor, respectively. Vbi is the built-in voltage, which is given by the difference between the Fermi energies in the n-doped (EF,n) and the p-doped (EF,p) regions in a p–n junction. ND/A are donor ND densities for n-doped semiconductors or acceptor NA densities for p-doped semiconductors.
To overcome the Schottky barrier, heavily doped strategy, or metallized electrodes, is proposed in crystalline silicon photovoltaics, and the Al-BSF technology is mature and predominant in industrial processing (Fig. 24(a)).5,293 BSF can decrease the dark current and the reflection of minority carriers, which results in high-efficiency commercial photovoltaics.294 However, metallized electrodes produce a high defect density at the metal–semiconductor interfaces, causing severe recombination at the rear contact and constraining the PCE to ∼20% for commercial silicon cells.5 To limit their impact, reducing the metal–Si contact area was applied to minimize the rear-side recombination, leading to increased VOC and JSC.295–297 Even so, classic metallization still results in significant nonradiative recombination, limiting the VOC of photovoltaics. Inspired by the structure of Schottky diodes, the metal–insulator–semiconductor structure was used in solar cells to substitute the metal–semiconductor structure.298 A thin layer of insulator, such as silicon oxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiNx), or aluminum oxide (AlOx), was inserted between the wafer and electrode, which balances the optimization between contact conductivity and passivation.5,127,293,299 This device structure is shown in Fig. 24(b), and benefiting from this method on PCE development, the PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) technology becomes the mainstream in current production.293 Besides, replacing heavily doped Si by a doped transport layer (selectively conducts a polarity of charges), usually hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with a low interface defect density is another option to minimize rear-side recombination, which are called silicon heterojunction (SHJ) devices (Fig. 24(c)).293,300–302 Based on heterojunction structures, the Si photovoltaics achieve the current world record PCE of 26.7% and the PCE on production lines is in the range of 23.5–24.5%.293,303

Similar to Si technology, the device structure of PSCs is also based on the heterojunction structure, that is, the n–i–p and p–i–n structures. However, electronic doping is rarely used in PSCs. Recently, the BSF concept was applied to halide perovskites, in which F4TCNQ was introduced at the two interfaces (perovskite/HTL and HTL/electrode interface) to bridge the perovskite to the electrode with the desired band alignment (Fig. 24(d)).304 As shown in Fig. 24(e) and (f), introducing F4TCNQ realized the p-type doping of perovskite and HTL surfaces, which created a BSF at the perovskite/HTL/electrode interface with a low band mismatch. Similarly, Li et al. constructed heterojunctions and down-shifted EF through surface sulfidation treatment (SST) for inverted PSCs (Fig. 24(g)).285 The extra BSF led to inhibited hole transport and improved electron transport (Fig. 24(h)), achieving an increased PCE of 24.3% with a high VOC of 1.19 V and a low voltage loss of 0.36 V (bandgap of 1.55 eV).
Despite the above successes, the electronic doping in perovskite materials is still limit. Compared with Si technology, the transport layers and perovskite layers have low doping concentration, resulting in a broader depletion region and lower built-in electric field. The calculated depletion region value of monocrystalline MAPbBr3 solar cells is ∼7 μm and the measured depletion region thickness of the MAPbI3 nanosheet is more than 5 μm, which is much larger than ∼0.5 μm in the Si p–n junction and ∼0.026 μm in the monolayer WSe2–MoS2 lateral p–n junction, and more importantly, much larger than the thickness of PSC devices of ∼0.8 μm.272,305–307 Therefore, the perovskite has a higher FF and VOC loss compared with Si solar cells. In addition, the perovskite/transport layer interface presents a larger lattice and thermal expansion constant mismatch, bringing severe recombination and poor long-term stability.308–310 Perovskite-based ETL and HTL with heavy doping should be designed and developed to minimize the mismatch and optimize charge transport.


6.1.2 Ionic conductivity. 
Ion transport is also important for electronic devices, such as memristors, sensors, optoelectronic devices, batteries etc.90 When a bias voltage is applied between two electrodes, ion migration will occur, with the electric field as the driving force. Eventually, the ion migration will reach an equilibrium state. Assuming that ion transport processes are random and uncorrelated, the ionic conductivity can be estimated through hopping in an ionic conductor:311 (40)Here the factor of 1/6 results from the assumed 3D isotropic motion as in the random walk model (i.e., b = 6), c is the mobile ion concentration and q is the charge of mobile ion, a is the hopping distance between two neighboring sites or free path, ν0 is the attempt frequency, and includes both successful jumps that can lead to macroscopic diffusion and unsuccessful ones, and ΔS and ΔH are the activation entropy and activation enthalpy of elementary jumps, respectively.
According to eqn (40), defect thermodynamics are curial for evaluating the ionic conductivity, especially the defect concentration. The concentration of ionic and electronic defects upon deviation from the perfect crystal is the function of stoichiometry (δ) and temperature, thus, ionic conductivity can be accommodated through self-doping. Considering an oxide, MO, its stoichiometry and conductivity vary with P(O2). According to the related mass-action law, the reaction is described as follows: (41) (42)where  represents an O vacancy and  represents one occupied O site in the perfect crystal. The change of the defect concentrations with stoichiometry changes can be predicted by combining eqn (44) and electric neutrality principle. Based on this method, defect concentrations upon stoichiometry changes can be obtained, known as Kröger–Vink diagrams. For a classical oxide perovskite, SrTiO3, its Sr/Ti ratio is manipulated by the reaction pathway, such as synthetic conditions, atmosphere and high-temperature treatments.312 Therefore, the ionic conductivity of SrTiO3 is expected to be modulated through self-doping.
Besides, ion transport is observed in halide perovskite materials, such as photoinduced phase separation and large dielectric constants, which contributes to the serious J–V hysteresis and poor stability problems of PSCs.313–316 Similar to oxide perovskites, self-doping dominates the ionic conductivity modulation of halide perovskite materials. Iodine atmosphere treatment of halide perovskite film could decrease the concentration of iodine vacancy, with a low migration activation energy between 0.08 and 0.58 eV, which eliminated possible ion migration paths.162,317–319 As expected, the ionic conductivity reversibly decreases upon increasing the iodine partial pressure unambiguously (Fig. 25(a) and (d)). Besides, PbI2 was proved to passivate defects and eliminate hysteresis in PSCs. Annealing can accelerate the volatilization of MAI and generate PbI2. As the annealing time increases from 5 min to 100 min at 150 °C, hysteresis index for the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite was reduced from 0.384 to 0.146.320

In addition, atomic doping has been demonstrated to be an available approach to regulating ionic conductance. For oxide perovskites, La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.85M0.15O3−δ (LSGM), substitution of La with alkaline-earth cations (Sr, Ca, Ba) and/or Ga with bivalent metal cations (Mg, Ni) can yield high oxygen vacancy concentration and ionic conductivities.321–325 In contrast, substitution of Ga with higher valence cations (Ti, Cr) yields lower levels of oxygen-ion conductivity, increasing the migration activation energy from 60 (5%-doped) to 230 kJ mol−1 (40%-doped).324
In addition to oxide perovskites, atomic doping is also applied for halide perovskite to regulate ionic conductivity, especially for alkali metal cations. LiI, NaI, KI, RbI, and CsI was incorporated into halide perovskite to reduce the intrinsic ion migration.326 Compared with other alkali metal ions, including Li+, Na+, Rb+ and Cs+, K+ has a moderate ionic radius, which could form 6 coordinations with I− and fit the interstitial site of perovskite lattice perfectly, thus, K+ is the best dopant to eliminate hysteresis and suppress ion migration. The hysteresis of PSCs is used to evaluate the ionic conductivity of halide perovskite materials. For the mixed perovskite (FA0.85MA0.1Cs0.05PbI2.7Br0.3), the control film showed a significant hysteresis with a PCE of 17.99% for the reverse scan and 15.08% for the forward scan. After KI doping, hysteresis of PSCs was significantly eliminated, where a PCE of 18.20% for the reverse scan and 17.97% for the forward scan were achieved. KI doping also showed the same tendency for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, indicating a promising strategy to suppress ion transport. Moreover, potassium ions have also been used to modify the grain boundaries and surfaces of halide perovskites, resulting in the decreased defect density and mitigated photo-induced ion migration of perovskite films.327 Interestingly, the alkali metal doping could also increase ionic conductance. Na-doping will generate a substitutional defect of Na on the Pb-site (NaPb), which can induce the generation of iodine vacancies and increase ionic conductivity (Fig. 25(b) and (e)).86
Furthermore, O2 is expected to behave as an acceptor dopant that increases both ionic and electronic conductivity (Fig. 25(c)).89 By treating the device under illumination (Fig. 25(f)) at a low oxygen pressures (P(O2) < 10−2 bar), the ionic conductivity appeared invariant as the oxygen partial pressure changes, while the ionic conduction increased when the P(O2) reached higher pressures (P(O2) >10−2 bar). This behavior indicated that MAPbI3 had a certain oxygen solubility and kept the state stable only for low oxygen partial pressures. Also, superoxide ions could cause such an effect in principle but is thermodynamically not favorable if incorporated interstitially.
Normally, DFT calculation is a helpful tool to evaluate the activation energy and understand the anomalous ion transport; however, the experimentally measured activation energy is often lower than the value predicted by DFT calculation.90,280 These differences are not surprising because the theoretical method only calculates the ionic conductance in a bulk crystal (only considers bulk point defects), while the crystal surface and grain boundaries play as major channels for ion migration.328,329 In addition, there are many other possible ion migration paths, such as strain induced extended defects and soften lattice caused by light illumination.310,330 New theoretical models (common assumptions in DFT calculations) should be proposed to predict ionic conductivity by considering these possible paths as more as possible.

6.2 Carrier dynamics
The effective carrier concentration determines the PCE of solar cells, which is limited by two factors: (1) the total carrier concentration and (2) the carrier extraction efficiency. The total carrier concentration is mainly determined by the bandgap and the thickness of the absorber. By narrowing the optical band gap of PV materials, JSC could increase due to the broadening spectral absorption range; however, VOC, which is positively correlated with the band gap, will decrease. The ideal band gap of a single-junction solar cell is 1.3–1.4 eV through the trade-off between JSC and VOC.331 The PV materials should be thick enough to maximize light absorption, and at the same time be thin enough for efficient charge carrier transfer. The carrier extraction efficiency (ηC) can be described using the following exponential equation:113 (43)where L is the diffusion length of the minor carriers and x is the distance into the semiconductor layer. In detail, L is proportional to the lifetime of the excited carrier (τ), the charge carrier mobility (μ) and the thermal voltage (VT): (44)

6.2.1 Charge transport. 
Charge carriers could be scattered during transport which might influence the lifetime and mobility of carriers. Considering the main scattering mechanism, the effective semiconductor mobility μ could be approximated by Matthiessen's rule:51 (45)where μimpurity, μphonon and μdefect are individual mobilities, limited by coulomb scattering by impurities, phonon scattering by the lattice and surface or bulk defects, respectively. The introduction of a dopant can optimize the carrier concentration, but offer an ionized center to scatter carriers at the same time (Fig. 26(a) and (b)).

Red and blue solid circles represent holes and electrons, respectively. (c) and (d) Electron (c) and hole (d) trapping by a defect of energy ED between the CB and VB. (e) and (f) Electron (e) and hole (f) de-trapping by a defect of energy ED between the CB and VB. (g) Hole and electron recombination assisted by defects. The arrow highlights the direction of the transition from the initial state to the final state. 
Extrinsic impurity and surface defects dominate charge transport in single crystal materials. Through diffusing P and Al in Si materials, the n+–p–p+ structure is established on Si PVs. Owing to the effects of the BSF, P–Al gettering, and the reflection of Al, the bulk conductivity and carrier diffusion length of Si PVs are significantly improved, thus greatly improving the PCE of Si PVs.332
Dangling bond is the main surface electrical defect in conventional PVs, whose energy is about ∼0.55 eV above the VB in Si PV materials. Chemical passivation and surface reconstruction could repair it to shallow defect. By passivating the channel/oxide interface of a Si MOSFET with hydrogen, the defect density was reduced by up to 12 times, which reduced the gate leakage current as well as the tunneling barriers. Chemical passivation is also widely used in the polycrystalline new-generation solar cells, as well as other electronic devices, such as transistors, memory transistors, and photodetectors.285,333–337
In polycrystalline material, bulk defects, e.g., grain boundary and dislocation, also dominate the charge transport process. Self-doping is a common method to regulate bulk defect. MOCVD-grown GaInNAs have been reported to have a long hole diffusion length of 0.9 μm, but the electron diffusion lengths are quite short. Through the MBE-grown strategy, a higher electron diffusion length of 0.5 μm was achieved in GaInNAs.338 This strategy has also been applied in new-generation solar cells.150,205 In addition, extrinsic dopants may command nucleation and crystallization during film growth, thus controlling the bulk defect, especially for films fabricated by the solution process. Initially, MAPbI3 prepared using Cl-based precursors has the carrier diffusion coefficients of 1–5 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, carrier lifetimes of hundreds of nanoseconds, and diffusion lengths of over a micrometer.339,340 Through improving film fabrication techniques, such as additive engineering and composition engineering, the lifetimes increased to tens of microseconds and the corresponding diffusion lengths increased to tens of micrometers.341–344
In addition to ionized center scattering, neutral defects also contribute to scattering.345 Neutral defects can be introduced by isovalent doping or low-ionized-degree impurities and its scattering behavior is similar to the scattering of slow electrons by hydrogen.346 In general, neutral impurity scattering is much weaker than that of ionized impurities, which can be ignored at low doping concentrations. In addition, scattering between carriers should be considered under a high carrier concentration.


6.2.2 Carrier recombination. 
Under continuous sunlight illumination, electrons from the VB will be excited into the CB with a relatively high energy, which tends to shift to a low energy state such as the impurity energy level. Impurity levels, introduced by impurities to the forbidden band of the semiconductor, where an approaching electron or hole is likely to be captured or trapped, are spatially localized. Also, there is a likelihood that the trapped electrons (or holes) with a low activation energy can de-trap to the CB (or VB). These processes are presented in Fig. 26(c)–(f). It is more likely that the trapped carrier will annihilate or recombine with an opposite carrier before it can be excited if the activation energy is large, as illustrated in Fig. 26(e).
The recombination of carriers in semiconductors are usually divided into 3 parts: defect-assisted recombination, radiative recombination and Auger recombination,347 (46)where n is the photo-generated carrier density, and k1, k2, and k3 are the first-order, second-order, and third-order rate constants associated with monomolecular (defect-assisted), bimolecular (radiative), and three-body (Auger) recombination, respectively. When the carrier concentration is relatively low, the recombination is dominated by the defect-assisted recombination. As carrier concentration increases, the defect-assisted recombination gradually saturates and radiative recombination gradually increases, which becomes the dominant recombination. At a higher carrier concentration (>1017 cm−3), the role of Auger recombination becomes non-negligible.149,348 Through the experimental measurements, such as pump-probe spectroscopy and photoluminescence decay, the recombination rate constants of halide perovskites (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3) have been estimated, where k1 = ∼107 s−1 for Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, k2 = ∼10−10 cm3 s−1 for radiative recombination, and k3 = ∼10−28 cm6 s−1 for the Auger recombination.349
The carrier recombination can be modulated by electronic doping in PV materials. The recombination center is formed when impurities are incorporated into the semiconductors. Through altering the types of dopants, such as Si and In, GaN LEDs can be manufactured to produce light with colors ranging from the low end of visible spectrum up to ultraviolet.350 Interestingly, a moderate concentration of dopants could reduce the carrier recombination and increase minority carrier life time. Co-diffusion of P, Al, and/or B in Si materials significantly enhanced the minority-carrier diffusion length, and this concept was also applied in OPV for increasing the exciton diffusion lengths.351–353 Furthermore, dopants can reduce the concentration of intrinsic defects of polycrystalline films. Studies have shown that the carrier lifetime decreased in PSCs at high doping concentrations. However, low levels of doping (Sr, Ca, Ag, Mg, Bi, and Sb, etc.) could increase the carrier lifetime, which might be related to the reduction of defect density by crystallization control and/or passivation.28,87,88,100,102,103,354
In conclusion, carrier transport and recombination are key factors that determine the carrier properties of a material, such as carrier lifetime, diffusion length, and mobility. If the defect states are energetically deep within the bandgap, a proportion of carriers are trapped, reducing the overall conductivity, and altering the coulombic or neutral scattering rates of the remaining free carriers. Besides, defect density and carrier properties have great impact on each other, and finally determine the efficiency and stability of the device (Table 11).

6.3 Device performance

6.3.1 Device efficiency. 
Electronic doping has a great impact on the VOC of the device, and the VOC is determined by quasi-Fermi energy splitting and the relationship of doping level:373 (47) (48)where J0 is the dark saturation current, Dh and De are the diffusivity of holes and electrons, Lh and Le are the diffusion length of holes and electrons, Nd and Na are the concentration of the donor and acceptor which determine carrier concentration, and ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration. Eqn (49) and (50) reveal that high concentration doping is essential for obtaining a larger VOC.
As mentioned above, self-doping is an effective method to modulate electronic doping. The composition dependent carrier concentration and carrier mobility in perovskite films are shown in Fig. 27(a).150 By verifying the MAI concentrations, the J–V curve evolution with the VOC and JSC changes of perovskite devices were modulated, which are summarized in Fig. 27(b) and (c). As the MAI concentration increases, the device VOC first decreases and then increases. According to eqn (49) and (50), the variation of VOC is related to the carrier concentration and doping type. Perovskite films made using 4.0% MAI solution were weakly p-doped with a hole concentration of 4 × 1014 cm−3. Further increasing the MAI content in the films by increasing the MAI solution concentration to 7% promoted the hole concentration, which results in the device VOC enhancement. Reducing MAI content converts films from the weak p-type to moderately doped n-type, which explains the larger VOC in these devices.

Reproduced from ref. 376 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2020. 
However, the doping concentration also need to be well controlled. As the doping concentration increased, the scattering and recombination centers gradually increased, thereby reducing the lifetime of the carriers and facilitating the nonradiative recombination, so an appropriate doping level is crucial. In silicon PVs, a moderate p-type doping concentration is about 1015 cm−3 (in intrinsic crystalline silicon, there are approximately 5 × 1022 atoms per cm3) and the moderate n-type doping concentration is about 1017 cm−3.61,374,375 Doping concentration above about 1018 cm−3 is considered degenerate at room temperature.
FF is determined by many factors, of which the most important ones are the RS and RSH resistance.376,377 At a high current density, the FF is determined by the RS (Fig. 27(e)). The Rs is influenced by both ohmic elements, such as the perovskite layer, the conductive substrate, transport layers, and the metal back contact, as well as the interface resistance, such as Schottky barrier. The electronic conductivity of bulk and surface can be improved to reduce RS, thus to optimize the carrier transport and to get a high FF. Under high internal electric field conditions, RSH has a pronounced effect on the shape of J–V curves (Fig. 27(f)). It arises from the current leakage through the device, such as the carrier recombination in bulk and interface. Electronic doping can minimize the recombination as well as reduce the space–charge buildup to increase the RSH value. Moreover, carrier lifetime determines the charge extraction and the steepness of the J–V curve under low-internal field conditions or near VOC. Appropriate doping concentration can increase the carrier lifetime and thus increase FF.
During the development of Si technology, increasing the current density contributes greatly to the efficiency improvement at the preliminary stage. Afterwards, the efficiency is improved through passivated emitter and rear cells, which accounts for enhanced FF and VOC.293,378 And the development of the efficiency of PSCs appeared in the same trend (Table 12). As JSC gradually approaches the SQ limit of JSC (JSQ), the improvement of VOC and FF is the key to further enhancing the PCE of PSCs. For GaAs, the ratios of the achieved performance parameters to the limit values of the S–Q limit are 88% for PCE/PCESQ, 99% for VOC/VSQ, 91% for JSC/JSQ and 97% for FF/FFSQ.376,379 However, PSCs exhibit low FF and VOC ratios compared to GaAs. The FF of most reported PSCs is around 0.7–0.8 and even certified devices in “Solar Cell Efficiency Tables” with PCEs of 22.7% and 23.3% show low FF values less than 0.8 (FF/FFSQ < 90%).380,381 Therefore, the optimization of performance parameters VOC and FF will be the key factors for further PCE improvements.

The homojunction and heterojunction structures, which could minimize the band mismatch and increase the built-in electric field at the interface to accelerate the carrier transfer, are the major technologies for a high efficiency device in the commercial success of solar cells, especially for VOC and FF enhancement.5,293 Inspired by commercial success of solar cell technologies, heterojunctions were also constructed in PSCs by electronic doping to promote VOC and FF of the devices. Trivalent cations, such as Sb3+ and In3+, were spontaneously distributed in the crystal with concentration gradient due to the difference in the ionic size and electrostatic interaction between the dopants and host atoms, as shown in Fig. 28(a).391 A heterojunction perovskite layer with well-matched band-edge to the ETL was formed based on solution manipulation, which yielded a high FF of 0.84 and a PCE of 21.04%. In addition, Pb–Sn gradient doping was achieved by feeding a continuous flow of precursors of different compositions (Fig. 28(b) and (c)).392 Surprisingly, the graded MAPb0.5+xSn0.5−xI3 exhibited a relatively high VOC and showed the best overall performance among the three absorbers (MAPbI3, MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3). The graded bandgap of the MAPb0.5+xSn0.5−xI3, which was similar to the built-in field of a p–n junction, facilitated carrier separation, transport and collection, thus improving the carrier lifetime. Furthermore, epitaxial growth, an unique material deposition strategy for oxide perovskites and III–V, II–VI and transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, has been adopted in halide perovskites, which constructed highly stable and tunable lateral epitaxial heterostructures, multiheterostructures and superlattices.393 These 2D heterostructures exhibited a suitable band alignment and good diode behaviors, with a rectification ratio of around 102 without hysteresis. These findings and methodologies may inspire further developments of optoelectronics for perovskites and other hybrid materials.

Homojunction structure can be constructed for high efficiency PSCs by compositional regulation. The MAPbI3 films with MAI rich precursors are n-doped and those with PbI2 rich precursors are p-doped.150 The homojunction structure combining a thermally evaporated p-type perovskite layer on a solution-processed n-type perovskite layer was integrated in a planar PSC, which formed a built-in electric field and promoted the oriented transport of the photo-induced carriers (Fig. 28(d) and (e)).152 As a result, the homojunction PSC showed a better performance than the standard p–i–n PSC with an increased PCE from 17.76% to 20.80%. Furthermore, through a robust p–n homojunction, a simplified PSC in the absence of both ETL and HTL was constructed, yielding a PCE of over 8% without using any interfacial modification layers. In addition, capsaicin was applied as an additive in perovskite precursors, which realized the defect passivation and energetic modification for perovskites at the same time, making a complete transformation of the MAPbI3 surface from p- to n-type (Fig. 28(f)).394 After defect passivation by capsaicin, the p–n homogeneous junction (∼100 nm) spontaneously formed, resulting in a high efficiency of 21.88% and an excellent FF of 83.81%.


6.3.2 Device stability. 
The device stability of solar cells depends on two aspects: intrinsic material stability and extrinsic stability against environment. The encapsulation of solar cells can prevent moisture and oxygen invasion effectively and some external encapsulation materials have already been applied to solar cells for commericilization.395 However, the intrinsic material stability, which is affected by complex factors such as the phase and structure stability, chemical stability, and ion migration, is difficult to improve significantly, severely limiting the further enhancement of long-term stability and leading to the reduction of EPBT of solar cells, especially for PSCs.40,396
Defect density of PV materials has huge influence on the intrinsic device stability. Material degradation is generally initialized from defect sites, which are more reactive with water and oxygen.397–399 In addition, defects are channels for water and oxygen capture and rapid diffusion, which further accelerates the degradation of bulk materials.395 For covalent-bond based PV materials like silicon, structural defects are usually electrically neutral. Therefore, eliminating structural defects mainly involves a chemical reaction with primary chemical bonding. For Si solar cells, structural defects are usually eliminated by forming chemically stable oxides and nitrides, i.e., SiO2, SiNx, or AlOx, through thermal oxidization and/or chemical vapor deposition.127 Benefiting from the ionic nature of new-generation PV materials, especially for perovskites, the structural defects are generally charged defects, which enable multifarious elimination methods including redox shuttle and chemical bond enhancement.280
DFT calculation showed that perovskites were chemical unstable, whose enthalpy of formation (with respect to MAI and PbI2) can be negligible.206 Intrinsic degradation would occur in perovskite materials upon ageing treatments such as heat, oxygen, light and moisture. On one hand, Pb2+ can be easily reduced to metallic Pb0 upon heating and/or illumination, which was probed in the halide perovskite film by XPS.400–402 Besides, the nonstoichiometric composition and/or the asynchronous degradation of halide perovskites could leave undercoordinated Pb2+ ions on the film surface and grain boundaries, which had higher reduction or oxidation (redox) activity.280 On the other hand, I− was prone to be oxidized to I0, which triggered the chain reactions and accelerated the degradation of perovskite films.403 Sacrificial agents such as HPA, EtOH and BQ were used to eliminate either Pb0 or I0 defects.402,404,405 However, these additives diminished soon after taking effects. To solve this problem, the “redox shuttle’’ concept was proposed to constantly eliminate Pb0 and I0 simultaneously in PSCs over their life span by using the ion pair Eu3+–Eu2+ on the basis of the following chemical reactions (Fig. 29(a)):406 2Eu3+ + Pb0 → 2Eu2+ + Pb2+(49) Eu2+ + I0 → Eu3+ + I−.(50)

Although the reaction is thermodynamically favored with a Gibbs formation energy (ΔG) of −173.6 kJ mol−1, metallic Pb and I2 powder only led to limited formation of PbI2. Interestingly, this reaction can be easily triggered by applying ion pairs with appropriate redox potentials. Eu3+ could easily oxidize the Pb0 defects and Eu2+ could reduce the I0 defects, which was the best candidate of ion pairs. The resultant device (unencapsulated) retained 91% of the original PCE after 500 h of MPP tracking. In addition, the devices maintained 89% and 92% of the original PCE after heating at 85 °C or under 1 sun continuous illumination for 1500 h, respectively.
Moreover, chemical bond enhancement, incorporating the dopants with strong interactions with the perovskite crystal lattice, can immobilize ions to reduce intrinsic defects and increase chemical stability. Fluoride ions with extremely high electronegativity were introduced into the perovskite film, which formed strong ionic bonds with Pb2+ and strong hydrogen bonds (N–H⋯F) with organic cations (MA/FA), leading to the reduction of both the organic cation and halide anion vacancies (Fig. 29(b)).407 The devices maintained 90% of the original PCE after 1000 h of MPP tracking under continuous one sun illumination. In addition, the devices retained 90% and 95% of the original PCE after heating at 85 °C or under 1 sun continuous illumination for 1000 h, respectively. Recently, fluorine-containing molecules and organic salts, such as FEAI and amphiphilic TFMBAI, had demonstrated great improvement on the stability of PSCs.304,408,409
Under electric field, illumination, and thermal treatment, the charged defects migrate, which could lead to the J–V hysteresis, phase segregation, band bending or even material degradation.410–414 When an electric field was applied to the perovskites, the negatively defects, i.e., VMA and Ii, migrated along the opposite direction of the electric field. At the same time, the positively defects, i.e., VI and MAi, migrated in the direction of the electric field, which caused the charge accumulation in HTL/perovskite/CTL interface and unintentional doping effect.413,415 According to the electric neutrality principle, the negative charged defects migrated and accumulated in the perovskite surface which introduced equivalent numbers of holes to chemically p-dope the interface. Similarly, the migration of negative defects in the perovskite surface led to a chemically n-doped perovskite surface. The chemical doping at the interface led to the generation of an additional electric field in the perovskite absorber that compensated the built-in electric field. It hindered the photogenerated carrier transport, which was harmful for device efficiency and stability.318,319 In addition, the migrating ions have the potential to react with the transport layer or metal electrode. It was proved that the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD+ can chemically react with the mobile I− to form an electroneutral spiro-MeOTAD–I complex under light illumination or thermal stress (85 °C aging).416–418 Besides, the chemical reaction between the mobile I− and metal electrodes, such as silver, was observed in the experiment.414 After aging the MAPbI3-based device, silver electrodes would change from white to yellow due to the formation of AgI, which originated from the chemical reaction between the migrated MAI and Ag. The chemical reactions are also observed in the perovskite/TiO2 interface, which may form Ti–I–Pb bonds between TiO2 and MAPbI3.416 To solve these ion migration issues, methods have been developed including alkali metal ion doping, introducing functionalized additives, adjusting perovskite components, and forming a passivation layer on the perovskite surface, which is described in detail in Section 6.1.2.
The band mismatch and defect states at the perovskite/transport interfaces would cause carrier accumulation and undesired nonradiative recombination, which damaged the long-term stability of the device, especially for MPP tracking.419–421 The Lewis acid–base theory is widely adopted for chemical passivation and doping in perovskite surface. Lewis base-based deep traps, such as the undercoordinated I and antisite PbI3− can be eliminated by the Lewis acid, such as C60 and its derivatives (PCBM, ICBA, etc.) with the capability to accept a lone pair of electrons.422–424 Similarly, Lewis acid-based traps, such as the undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters, can be eliminated by the Lewis base, such as the molecules containing functional groups like nitrogen (N) or sulphur (S) with a pair of nonbonding electrons.425–428
The charged nature of the defects in the perovskite surface enables the neutralization through ionic bonding, such as conversion of surface imperfections to wide bandgap materials. PbI2 is a wide bandgap material with a band gap of 0.8 eV greater than that of MAPbI3. After annealing at 150 °C for 60 min, enriched PbI2 formed at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, leading to n-doping and suppressing the recombination at the surface.429 Besides, the formation of a layered 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface can create type-I band alignment, which is another effective approach to improve the stability. Through in situ reaction between n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and the perovskite, a WBH perovskite was established on the NBH perovskite layer (Fig. 29(c)).380 The modified devices without any encapsulation kept nearly 80% of its original efficiency after 1008 h under 85% RH at room temperature. The operational stability of modified devices significantly increased, where the modified devices maintained over 95% of their initial PCE for 1370 h and the control devices quickly degraded within 100 h. Other chemicals, such as butylammonium (BA+), PEA+, or AVAI were reported to form different layered perovskites at the interface.430–432
Due to the weak secondary bonding between the passivation molecules and the perovskite surface, inorganic anions, which can form strong chemical bonds with the perovskite, are investigated. Similar to the Si passivation strategies, the chemically stable lead oxysalt layer can be established on the perovskite surface, which can provide sufficient protection for extreme conditions such as thermal ageing and humidity aging (Fig. 29(d)).127 Considering the operation conditions of PVs, lead salts that are insoluble in water are ideal candidates. PbSO4 and Pb3(PO4)2, whose solubility is merely 0.0443 and 0.00014 g L−1, respectively, at 20 °C, were formed through the surface reaction by using (C8H17NH3)2SO4 and (C8H17NH3)3PO4 salts. Devices with the lead oxysalt layers (encapsulation) retained 96.8% of their original efficiency after 1200 MPP tracking under 1 sun continuous illumination at 65 °C, whereas the control device showed severe degradation within 474 h. Recently, this strategy was applied to inverted PSCs, where the PbPyA2 and TMS were introduced to form strong lead–sulfur bonds (Pb–S) that not only are chemically stable, with an equilibrium constant (Ksp) of 1.0 × 10−28, but also upshifted the EF and offered a BSF for electron extraction.285 In addition to the above lead compounds, other lead compound with low solubility (Ksp), such as PbCO3 (1.46 × 10−13), PbO (1.26 × 10−15), Pb5(PO4)3Cl (3.98 × 10−85), Pb5(PO4)3Br (7.94 × 10−79) and Pb5(PO4)3F (2.51 × 10−72), await to be developed and investigated.

7. Conclusions and outlook
Electronic doping is crucial to modulate the electrical properties of photovoltaic materials. As the material composition and/or molecular structure extend beyond conventional materials systems, like the new-generation PV materials, the classical understanding of electronic doping based on the crystalline silicon cannot be directly applied. In some cases, these arguments are even controversial which require further investigation. New theories and techniques need to be developed to investigate electronic doping in new PV materials.
In this review, we have first introduced conventional electronic doping (atomic doping using physical approaches mainly in crystalline silicon). We emphasize that physicochemical properties of atoms such as the valence electron, electronegativity, radius, and the redox properties determine the doping type. Subsequently, we turned to chemical approaches, which are developed to tackle with the new-generation of PV materials featuring weak chemical bonding and a soft lattice. New electronic doping strategies (molecular doping and self-doping) have been summarized with the focus on chemical approaches. We concluded that by adjusting the HOMO or LUMO levels of dopant molecules (molecular doping) and the intrinsic defects in polycrystalline semiconductor films (self-doping), controllable electronic doping can be achieved in new-generation PV materials.
In addition, the effects of electronic doping are discussed and summarized. Electronic doping can bring slight or steep shifts in electronic band structure across semiconductor bulks and interfaces. It thus modulates carrier concentration, conductivity, and thus carrier dynamics, which further improves device performance. To assess the effects of electronic doping quantitatively for new-generation solar cells, new models based on the physicochemical properties of individual dopants and the formation and transformation of intrinsic defects are proposed in this review, which can help to better control the carrier concentration of semiconductors and guide the design of devices.
Finally, we have proposed a few parameters of essence that play an important role in different doping strategies, including the chemical properties of materials, defect density, processing conditions, etc.
Reviewing the development of electronic doping, the technologies in conventional semiconductors may shed light on the design and optimization of new solar cells. Constructing p–n homojunction and gradient heterojunction is effective to optimize carrier transport and improve the efficiency in silicon solar cells, and they are expected to be feasible for the emerging PVs. Indeed, p–n homojunctions and gradient heterojunction constructed by the solution process have been reported in OPV and PSC.24,152,391,392,394 However, facile ion migration and defect interdiffusion in these PV materials remain a problem for the stability and effectiveness of the homojunction and heterojunction structures, which need further research.51
Electronic doping at the surface is an effective strategy which can be accomplished by facile in situ chemical/wet processing. It could modify the electrode–semiconductor interfaces for efficient carrier extraction, which is potentially feasible for perovskite solar cells without ETL or HTL.280,366 However, for new-generation PV materials, like halide perovskites, it is likely to react with metal electrodes, thus the investigation of inert conducting materials to retard their corrosion is highly demanded.127,285,414
Furthermore, self-compensation is a common phenomenon in new semiconductors with a soft lattice due to their low lattice formation energy, which limits the concentration of electronic carriers.25,51,150 Non-equilibrium growth, such as quenching and rapid solvent evaporation, which has been widely used in CdTe, may be applicable to overcome the limitations of self-compensation.12
New electronic models and assumptions for DFT calculations need to be developed to interpret experiment results, which are important to guide the processing for effective electronic doping in new-generation PVs. For atomic dopants, self-compensating effects and defect complexes are worth careful consideration. Also, the location of impurity atoms in the crystal lattice affects the doping significantly, and precise location control is desired. For molecular dopants, the dopant solubility, configuration, and size can affect charge delocalization and disorder. To further control electronic doping, the development of new electronic models and calculation methods are required to compute charge and non-localized systems more efficiently. At the same time, time-dependent defect model instead of static defect model must be developed to simulate influences caused by dynamic effects such as aggregation, diffusion, and drift.
The new-generation solar cells, especially for PSCs, have shown rapid development and have the potential to realize PV grid parity. However, the emerging solar cells face significant challenges. In particular, the fundamental understanding is still quite limited, which is far behind the development in device efficiency. On one hand, novel materials and doping methods need to be developed to facilitate the further commercialization of new-generation solar cells. On the other hand, theories applicable for new materials are urgently required to design and conduct effective electronic doping. It is important that the theoretical and experimental investigators, and academic and industrial researchers work closely together to have a comprehensive consideration of electronic doping, and develop more realistic and a reliable process for new-generation or next-generation solar cells.
