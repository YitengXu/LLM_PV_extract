    , Accepted 20th March 2017First published on 21st March 2017AbstractIn this work, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic properties of two new N-annulated PDI derivatives connected with one (M1) or two (M2) thiophene bridging units and directly compare to a twisted PDI dimer with no thiophene units (tPDI-Hex). Compounds M1 and M2 were synthesized using an optimized direct heteroarylation carbon–carbon bond forming method. A combination of optical absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, polarized optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and density functional theory were used to characterize all compounds. Introduction of thiophene units into the PDI dimer scaffold served to red-shift the optical absorption and lower electron affinities. A decrease in the fluorescence intensity of M1 and M2 relative to tPDI-Hex was observed and attributed to photoinduced electron transfer. Notably, both M1 and M2 exhibited less structured thin-films as evidenced by optical microscopy and thin film X-ray diffraction. Photovoltaic properties were evaluated by fabricating bulk heterojunction solar cells with the inverted architecture ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag and using PTB7-Th as the donor polymer. All solar cells were made and tested in air, and only ‘as-cast’ active layers were evaluated to ensure a direct comparison amongst the three acceptors. Solar cells with PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex gave power conversion efficiencies of ∼5% with Vocs of 0.95 V, akin to our previous results. Comparatively, solar cells with PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 active layers exhibited higher Voc values upwards of 1.05 V but only had PCE of 1.1–1.2% when cast from chloroform, which we attributed to the formation of large domain sizes. A change in casting solvent to o-xylene resulted in improved bulk heterojunction morphology by reducing domain size and a doubling of the PCE values to ∼2% was realized for devices using M1 and M2 as electron acceptors. Use of the high boiling solvent, trimethylbenzene, resulted in further improvements in PCE for M1 and M2, increasing the PCE for devices using these acceptors to ∼3%. Importantly, devices made using the new materials exhibit low energy losses in the range of 0.5–0.7 eV.
Introduction
Organic solar cells offer the ability to deliver inexpensive clean energy and thus have received tremendous attention from academic researchers over the last decade.1–3 These solar cells require two primary active components, an electron donating and an electron accepting material, in order to effectively harvest sunlight, facilitate charge separation and transport electrons.4 While many donor materials have been studied leading to significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCE), many state of the art devices are still reliant on fullerene derivatives as the electron accepting component.5–9 While fullerene derivatives are excellent acceptor materials they have a high embodied energy, minimal light absorption in the visible and near-IR regions of the solar spectrum, fixed electronic energy levels, and are soluble in only a limited range of solvents.10–15
In order to expand the potential of the technology, research in the last few years has been shifted towards investigating alternative electron accepting materials to use in place of fullerenes.16–22 Many material designs, both polymeric and small molecule, have been investigated; however, within this regime, perylene diimide-based materials have been one of the most intensely studied and successful systems.23 Perylene diimide (PDI) dyes are ideal for this application because they are relatively inexpensive and can be easily chemically tuned in order to modify their solubility, self-assembly, optical, and electronic characteristics.19,23
Within the Welch research group, we have developed an N-annulated bay-linked PDI dimer, tPDI-Hex (Scheme 1). When combined with the donor polymer PTB7-Th, organic solar cells with PCE of 5.7% were realized.24 Further improvements were achieved using the donor polymer P3TEA, with solar cells reaching efficiencies of 7.6%.24 Noteworthy was the high Voc of 1.13 V, which is among the highest reported in the literature for organic solar cells based upon non-fullerene acceptors.25–33 In addition, these N-annulated PDI materials can be synthesized on multi-gram scale in facile manner, are highly soluble in a range of organic solvents, and include an extra site for N-alkyl side chain engineering.24 Interested in furthering our understanding of this class of materials, we set out to incorporate the N-annulated PDI materials into a molecular architecture containing electron rich thiophene building blocks. The combination of electron rich and electron poor building blocks to form donor–acceptor (D–A) materials is a well-known strategy used to precisely tune the energy levels and optical absorption profiles of π-conjugated materials.34 Previously, we showed that N-annulation at the bay position of the PDI chromophore results in a slight lowering of the electron affinity (EA), owing to the inclusion of an electron donating N-atom.24 We hypothesized that combining this N-annulation strategy with the donor–acceptor strategy using electron rich thiophene linkers would further decrease the EA, and subsequently lead to solar cell devices with higher operating voltages. Herein we present the synthesis and characterization of N-annulated PDI materials bearing one or two thiophene linkers (A–D–A and A–D–D–A architectures, M1 and M2, respectively) and discuss the effect of the thiophene linkers on the optical, electronic, and physical properties as well as photovoltaic device performance.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The target compounds M1 and M2 were synthesized using the direct heteroarylation (DHA) method.35–37 Applying the DHA methodology for C–C bond formation is gaining momentum as an atom-economical and greener alternative to more traditional C–C cross coupling reactions such as the Stille or Suzuki coupling.38–40 Starting with the previously reported brominated PDI synthon (1),24 we employed DHA C–C bond coupling using a heterogeneous palladium catalyst SiliaCat® DPP-Pd. This catalytic system is used in our lab along with a standardized set of reaction conditions for the cross coupling of aromatic C–H and C–Br bonds.41–43M1 was synthesized using a combination of (1) and a thiophene–PDI synthon (2). To form small molecule M2, a bithiophene (3) coupling partner was utilized in combination with (1). After column chromatography, M1 and M2 were obtained as dark red solids in 70% and 51% yields, respectively. The reaction pathways towards M1 and M2 are shown in Scheme 1 and the full synthetic details, including the synthesis of precursor materials, work-up and purification details, are available in the ESI.†
Density functional theory
Quantum chemical calculations are routinely used to probe trends within a series of molecules, and when paired with experimental data can be a powerful tool for understanding structure–property relationships.44–46 Molecules M1 and M2 were investigated in the gas phase using density functional theory (DFT) in order to determine the effect of the thiophene linkers on the overall geometry of the final molecules, as well as their frontier orbital energies and distributions.44 (depicted in Fig. 1, data tabulated in Table 1). The geometry optimization predicts a significant ‘twisting’ of the thiophene units relative to the PDI moieties for M1 and M2, where the planar thiophene and PDI portions of the molecules are twisted relative to each other by 76° and 85°, respectively (Fig. 1A). Because of the added thiophene units, the PDI units for M1 and M2 become spatially separated, and less sterically encumbered by each another, allowing for a reduced dihedral angle between PDI units and overall, more planar structures. For tPDI-Hex, the PDI–PDI dihedral angle is predicted to be 96°, while for M1 and M2 the PDI–PDI dihedral angles are reduced to 22° and 19°, respectively (Fig. 1A).

In addition to the optimized geometries, DFT can also provide an estimate of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies. For M1 and M2 the energies of the frontier MO's were destabilized by approximately 0.1 eV compared to tPDI-Hex, which contains no thiophene linkers. This result is expected, due to the introduction of the electron rich thiophene linkers which can destabilize the frontier molecular orbitals relative to the parent dimer tPDI-Hex. The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals are given in Fig. 1B and Table 1, along with the molecular orbital surfaces depicting the delocalization of the orbitals. Interestingly for tPDI-Hex, the frontier molecular orbitals remain fully delocalized for all the molecular orbitals examined (HOMO−2 to LUMO+2), while M1 and M2 display significant localization of the frontier molecular orbitals with increasing number of thiophene units (Fig. 1B). For instance, the LUMO for tPDI-Hex is fully delocalized, while the LUMO for M1 is localized on the PDI units with minimal density on the thiophene bridging unit. The addition of a second thiophene unit to form M2, causes a complete localization of the LUMO on to only one of the molecule's two PDI units. The gradual localization of the HOMO to the thiophene units and LUMO to the PDI units, with increasing thiophene substitution at the bay positions is a trend that was also noted by Zhan and co-workers in similar PDI–thiophene based architectures.47 These differences in frontier molecular orbital density may be expected to impact charge transport for these materials, as it is well known that molecular orbital overlap between adjacent molecules plays a large part in the ability of a material to transport charge.48
In order to mimic the beneficial properties of PC61BM, which has 3 ‘quasi-degenerate’ LUMO levels that are able to accommodate electrons,49 researchers have experimented with the idea of creating molecules that possess similar properties of degenerate and energetically low-lying LUMOs.50,51 In order to accomplish this it is often sufficient to connect two identical chromophores in a symmetrical and non-conjugated fashion.14 For tPDI-Hex, M1, and M2, which all have highly symmetrical structures with ‘broken’ conjugation caused by a high degree of twisting, the LUMO and LUMO+1 energy levels are quasi degenerate. Having such quasi degenerate energy levels accessible to excited electrons has been proposed as a beneficial trait for electron-acceptors and is believed to be an essential property for mimicking the outstanding electron accepting ability of fullerene derivatives.50,51
TD-DFT also gives some insight on the possible electronic transitions of the new molecules (Fig. 1C). For tPDI-Hex, the electronic transitions with the highest oscillator strengths (Fig. 1C, Table S1, ESI†) are predicted to be the HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transitions, while for M1, bearing a single thiophene unit, the transition with the greatest oscillator strength is the HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 transition. Finally, for M2, bearing two bridging thiophene units, the strongest transitions are predicted to be HOMO−2 → LUMO and HOMO−2 → LUMO+1. Interestingly, M2 is the only molecule of the set which displays a predicted electronic transition from HOMO → LUMO of any significant oscillator strength, perhaps due to the intrinsic donor–acceptor nature of the compound (Fig. 1B and C).
Cyclic voltammetry
With the DFT results and final materials in hand, we set out to use cyclic voltammetry (CV) to experimentally determine the effects of the thiophene linkers on the electronic properties of M1 and M2. The solution CV plots for compounds M1 and M2 are shown in Fig. 2 and the data is tabulated in Table 1. For tPDI-Hex, four reversible reduction waves are visible, while for M1 and M2, only two distinct reduction waves are visible. All three materials had one quasi-reversible oxidation. The ionization potentials (IP) of M1 and M2 were estimated to be 5.69 and 5.58 eV, respectively, while the electron affinities (EA) were estimated to be 3.47 and 3.54 eV. Comparatively, tPDI-Hex has a higher IP and EA (5.99 and 3.76 eV, respectively, see Table 1). These results demonstrate that adding the additional electron rich thiophene linkers between the PDI units has the expected effect of destabilizing the frontier molecular orbitals, as was predicted by DFT studies. In addition, a small and progressive decrease in electrochemical band-gap was noticed for M1 (ca. 2.22 eV) and M2 (ca. 2.04 eV) relative to tPDI-Hex which bears no thiophene bridging units (ca. 2.23 eV). Given that compounds M1 and M2 possess a “donor–acceptor” structure, one might expect a significant decrease in band gap due to intramolecular charge transfer between electron rich (thiophene) and electron poor (PDI) subunits of the molecule, as was illustrated by DFT calculations; however, the PDI and thiophene subunits of the molecule are not aligned in a coplanar fashion, which is expected to inhibit the efficient intramolecular electronic coupling between thiophene and PDI subunits of M1 and M2.

Optical absorption spectroscopy
UV-visible spectroscopy experiments were employed to observe the effect of the introduced thiophene linkers on the optical properties of the molecules M1 and M2. Experimental data is shown in Fig. 3 and tabulated in Table 2. In solution, M1 and M2 display absorption profiles that are remarkably alike and are typical for PDI-based materials, having three major bands visible at ∼540, ∼500 and ∼465 nm (see Fig. 3). These transitions are well documented for PDI-based materials and are attributed to the 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 vibrational modes of the PDI chromophore, respectively.64 In comparison to tPDI-Hex, the inclusion of one thiophene unit in M1 had the effect of red shifting the absorption onset by ∼14 nm. Adding another thiophene unit, moving from M1 to M2, resulted in a further red shifting of the absorption onset by ∼26 nm. These changes in optical band gap correlate well with the decrease in the electrochemical band gap observed using cyclic voltammetry. Density functional theory predicted a low energy HOMO → LUMO transition for M2, however this low energy absorption band is not observed experimentally, suggesting that the electronic communication between the bithiophene unit and PDI end-caps is minimal. We hypothesize that the difference between experiment and simulation arises from a difference in the experimental vs. predicted dihedral angle between planar PDI and thiophene units. A greater twist angle than predicted between these units could disrupt electronic communication between the PDI and the thiophene and thus decrease the probability of this predicted transition. To confirm this, we locked the dihedral angle between PDI and thiophene units at 90 degrees and re-ran the single point calculations, the results are summarized in Fig. S9,† showing that the increased dihedral angle can result in a disappearance of the predicted HOMO → LUMO transition. This result indicates that the twisting of the chromophore as predicted in the gas-state may not always be representative of the experimental molecular geometry owing to intermolecular interactions and rotational disorder.

Thin film UV-visible spectroscopy experiments were also performed using M1 and M2 to investigate any changes to the optical properties upon transition from solution to solid state. Firstly, for M1 and M2, the onsets of absorption in the films cast from chloroform were red-shifted from those in solution by 33 and 35 nm, respectively. This is attributed to the interaction of neighbouring molecules in the solid state, causing a red-shifting of the onset of absorption, due to increased conjugation via planarization of the molecules and π–π interactions in the solid state.65 The relative intensities of the 0–0 vs. 0–1 vibronic peaks are seen to decrease upon solution to film transition. For M2, the change is more prominent than in M1, as the two bands are nearly equal in intensity, an effect often attributed to the face-to-face aggregation of the PDI chromophores.64,66
In both cases, the changes observed on solution to film transition are less drastic than those seen for tPDI-Hex which features a strong 0–1 vibronic band in addition to a new absorption feature at low energies (∼596 nm, Fig. 3B) that is not seen in solution, presumably resultant from the crystalline nature of the molecule in the solid state.24 The fact that M1 and M2 do not possess this low energy shoulder could then be indicative of reduced crystallinity in the solid state. To test this hypothesis, we first performed simple optical microscopy experiments using cross-polarized light. Optical images reveal that films of M1 and M2 do not have visible crystalline features, while a film of the tPDI-Hex molecule does (Fig. S10A†). To confirm that M1 and M2 do not form crystalline features in the films, we performed X-ray diffraction experiments on the films used for optical microscopy. The powder diffraction patterns of tPDI-Hex revealed a diffraction peak at ∼6.4° (θ–2θ scans, Fig. S10B†) while M1 and M2 showed no peaks in the diffraction pattern, suggesting that these compounds do not form a crystalline morphology. The relative crystallinity of these compounds is important to note, because within a bulk heterojunction solar cell's active layer, the crystalline nature of the compounds used can play a large role in determining the characteristics of the solar cell.64,67–70 Therefore, understanding the crystalline nature of a compound and how to control this can be an asset when optimizing active-layer fabrication procedures.
Photoluminescence spectroscopy
Photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to gain additional insight into the optical and electronic characteristics of the two new molecules M1 and M2; data is depicted in Fig. 4 and tabulated in Table 2.

Inset: photograph of M1 and M2 solutions in chloroform used for PL spectroscopy experiments under a UV-lamp. Solutions of similar absorbance at λmax were prepared by careful dilutions of approximately 0.001 mg mL−1 solutions (see page S19, ESI† for details). 

M1 has fluorescence that manifests itself as a broad emission band with the emission maxima centred at ∼626 nm. This is not significantly changed from the intense emission of tPDI-Hex, which is centred around ∼601 nm. M2, however, is visibly less emissive in solution (see inset, Fig. 4), and in addition features a red-shifted emission maxima centred around ∼667 nm. Full details concerning the photoluminescence of tPDI-Hex, M1 and M2, can be found in the ESI for this document (page S19, ESI†).
Bulk heterojunction blends
With a good handle on the materials' properties, we set out to compare the photovoltaic performance of M1 and M2 against tPDI-Hex in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The donor polymer PTB7-Th is energetically poised to act as an electron donor when paired with the three molecules used in this study (Fig. 5). Given that the EA of M1 and M2 are lower compared to tPDI-Hex, we anticipated a concomitant increase is Voc for the solar cells made using M1 and M2 as the acceptor components. BHJ solar cells were fabricated with an inverted architecture (ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag). Importantly, the devices were fabricated under ambient conditions using a simple processing method with no additives, annealing, or special casting conditions, allowing a direct comparison of each acceptor. Active layer BHJ films were cast from chloroform (CF), o-xylene or trimethylbenzene (TMB) at room temperature. CF is a common processing solvent while o-xylene and TMB are considered more environmentally friendly (non-halogenated) solvents.71,72 Following our previous work, we used BHJ donor:acceptor ratios of 2:3 or 3:7.24 Initial studies revealed that both ratios used gave similar performance, and so we chose to continue using the 3:7 ratio, as the higher acceptor loading is beneficial when using more complex and expensive donor polymers such as PTB7-Th. Full details of solar cells made at a 2:3 ratio can be found in the ESI (Table S2, Fig. S12†).

Solar cells fabricated using a PTB7-Th:tPDI-hex BHJ active layer cast from chloroform could be fabricated and tested in air and achieved a PCE of ∼5% in the as-cast devices without any solvent additives or post-deposition treatments.73 This result is among the best reported for air-processed, fullerene-free OPV.73–75 As a direct comparison, we fabricated solar cells for PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 from chloroform solutions (see Table 3, Fig. 6A–C). As expected, solar cells made with M1 or M2 as the acceptor material reached Voc values above 1 V (see Table 3, Fig. 6A–C). The overall performance of the two new derivatives was otherwise quite low (0.9 and 1.2% PCE for devices utilizing M1 and M2, respectively), compared to those using the parent acceptor tPDI-Hex. Importantly, for all three molecules, energy losses were approximated to be 0.5–0.7 eV, among the lowest reported for BHJ solar cells (Table 3).32,76–78

a Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with an inverted architecture (ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag). Active layers were cast from o-xylene, chloroform or TMB as indicated, at a total solids concentration of 10 mg mL−1 for chloroform and o-xylene whereas TMB solutions had a total solids concentration of 15 mg mL−1. A spin casting speed of 1500 rpm (60 s) was used for chloroform solutions, a 600 rpm (60 s) spin speed was used for the casting o-xylene devices, followed by spinning at 1500 rpm (20 s) to allow the film to dry. For TMB devices, the spin speed was 800 rpm (60 s), followed by 1500 rpm (20 s) to allow the film to dry.
b Average values are calculated from a total of four devices. The energy loss of each cell was calculated using the following formula: Eloss = [1240/(onset of photocurrent generation)] − Voc. See Table S2 for summarized device results for 2:3 blends as well as standard deviations for all measurements.

All data is from devices made with a 3:7 donor:acceptor ratio. 
We noted that the overall lower efficiencies for PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 resulted from a lower Jsc and poor fill factor for the device active layer (Fig. 6B and C, Table 3). To investigate this further, we performed thin film optical spectroscopy of the blended films as well as photoluminescence quenching and external quantum efficiency (EQE) experiments. The thin film optical spectra of the blended films indicated that light absorption was occurring from 425–800 nm (Fig. 7B and C). The EQE experiments reflected this, where both PTB7-Th and the molecular acceptors M1 and M2 contributed to the photocurrent in the 425–800 nm region (Fig. 6E and F). Photoluminescence quenching experiments showed efficient charge transfer between donor PTB7-Th and acceptor small molecules tPDI-Hex, M1 and M2 in the blended films, indicated by the near complete quenching of their fluorescence by the donor polymer PTB7-Th (Fig. S14 for 2:3 blends and S16† for 3:7 blends). Quenching of the donor polymer emission was also observed, (Fig. S15 for 2:3 blends and S17† for 3:7 blends) indicating that both channel I and channel II photocurrent can occur.79

Interested in the possibility of extending our simple processing conditions to ameliorate the use of non-halogenated solvents, we set out to fabricate devices using our compounds with o-xylene as the casting solvent. Firstly, the increased Voc and low energy losses observed in devices using PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 was maintained when switching the casting solvent to o-xylene, indicating that the strategy of tuning molecular energy levels is successful in modulating the Voc of the solar cells, regardless of casting solvent (Table 3). Secondly, we noticed a slight decrease in the performance of the solar cells made using PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex blends as the active layers, originating from a slight decrease in photocurrent, lowering the PCE of these devices from ∼5% to ∼4.5% (Table 3, Fig. 6A). For devices made using PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 as the acceptor, the change of casting solvent afforded a near doubling of the PCE from ∼1% to ∼2% (Table 3, Fig. 6B and C). For these devices, an increase in fill factor and Jsc was responsible for the increase in PCE. To investigate the changes in performance more closely, we set out to examine the blend film absorbance profiles (Fig. 7A–F), as well as photoluminescence quenching (Fig. S14–S17†) and EQE experiments (Fig. 6D–F). For PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex blends cast from o-xylene, there is decreased absorbance in the area of 600–640 nm compared to the same blend cast from chloroform (Fig. 7Avs.D). The lack of absorption is reflected in the EQE measurements for this blend, where a significant loss of photocurrent generation is noticed in this region when comparing films cast from o-xylene to those from chloroform (Fig. 6D). This is not surprising, as films of tPDI-Hex cast from chloroform display a low energy shoulder in the absorption profile when cast from chloroform, but not when cast from o-xylene. For PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 active layers cast from either solvent, no significant differences in the optical absorption spectra were observed (Fig. 7). The EQE measurements, however; revealed that the efficiency of photocurrent generation increased at every wavelength from 300 to 800 nm when using o-xylene as the casting solvent in place of chloroform. The change in casting solvent from chloroform to o-xylene did not affect the efficient photoluminescence quenching of the blended materials in all cases (Fig. S14–S17†).
Given that the PCE for M1 and M2 devices nearly doubled when the casting solvent was changed to the higher boiling o-xylene, we set out to create solar cells using our compounds spin-cast from an even higher boiling point non-halogenated solvent, TMB. Device results are tabulated in Table 3 and J–V curves can be found in Fig. S13.† The solar cells with active layers cast from TMB were further improved to those created using o-xylene; Voc values of approximately 1 V were obtained for all cells, with tPDI-Hex displaying the highest performance of 4.4% PCE and M1 and M2 giving performances of 2.0% and 2.6% PCE, respectively (Table 3). J–V curves, EQE measurements (Fig. S13†) and photoluminescence quenching (Fig. S16 and S17†) are also included in the ESI† for solar cells made from TMB. In a similar manner as the solar cells with active layers processed from o-xylene, the lower performance of tPDI-Hex based solar cells arises from decreased photocurrent from the 600–640 nm region (vide supra). For M1 and M2, the EQE measurements revealed that the increased performance for these cells relative to those cast from chloroform is a result of increased photocurrent generation across the visible spectrum (Fig. S13†).
Morphological characterization
As a final comparison between the devices fabricated in this work we investigated the morphology of the BHJ films cast from chloroform using atomic force microscopy (Fig. 8). The AFM images revealed that the blend films featuring PTB7-Th and the two new compounds M1 and M2 possessed continuous domains on the micrometer scale (Fig. 8B and C) much larger than the ∼150 nm domains seen in the blend films containing PTB7-Th and tPDI-Hex (Fig. 8A). Specifically, for films cast from chloroform using PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex blends at both 2:3 and 3:7 weight ratio we observe a finely intermixed active layer that is uniform across the entire area surveyed (see Fig. S18† for AFM images of 2:3 blends cast from CF). Blends of PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 cast from chloroform at both 2:3 and 3:7 ratios exhibit much more fibre-like domains that appear significantly more phase separated than the PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex films, possibly due to the reduction in dihedral angle between the PDI portions of the M1 and M2 chromophores compared to tPDI-Hex.80 It is well known that a finely interpenetrating network of donor and acceptor is necessary to achieve optimal charge separation and transport within a BHJ film,7,81–84 and so the formation of these large domains in blend films containing M1 and M2 is likely playing a large part in the decreased device performance for these materials.

Investigation of the blend films of PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex cast from o-xylene using AFM revealed an increased domain size for both 2:3 and 3:7 weight ratios (Fig. 9A, see Fig. S19† for AFM images of 2:3 blends cast from o-Xyl). The increased domain size corresponds to the decreased solar cell performance for PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex devices compared to the related devices cast from chloroform. Investigation of PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 films cast from o-xylene, however; revealed that the change in solvent was beneficial to the morphology of the blends, resulting in decreased domain sizes. The PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 blends cast from o-xylene show finely interpenetrating, nano-sized domains on the order of ∼400 nm (Fig. 9B and C). The change in morphology corresponds with the increased device performance for both PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 devices using o-xylene as the casting solvent, and is likely the major reason for the increase in PCE upon change of casting solvent. AFM images of the devices fabricated from TMB are similar to those cast from o-xylene, showing increased domain sizes for PTB7-Th:tPDI-Hex and decreased domain sized for PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2, relative to the same blends cast from CF solutions. AFM images for solar cells cast from TMB are included in the ESI for this work (Fig. S20†). In this work, the use of high-boiling, non-halogenated solvents proved to have a beneficial effect on the morphology of our PDI–thiophene compounds, resulting in improved photovoltaic performance.

Previous reports of PDI based materials have shown similar improvements in morphology for PDI–thiophene compounds when casting from non-halogenated solvents. For instance, Hou and co-workers demonstrated that BHJ active layers utilizing a PDI–thiophene based polymer could be cast from the green solvent anisole, while still maintaining a high PCE of ∼5%.71 Hashimoto et al. noticed that changing the casting solvent from a halogenated one such as chloroform and chlorobenzene to a non-halogenated one such as o-xylene was effective in improving the morphology of the BHJ blends containing PDI based materials, and resulted in increased photovoltaic performance.85
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the synthesis of two new PDI based compounds with one (M1) or two (M2) thiophene bridging units. Both final materials were synthesized via a simple and atom-economical direct heteroarylation C–C coupling protocol using a support-metal catalyst system.
The addition of thiophene units is effective in modulating the electron affinity for the new materials, but this strategy is not without its consequences; the addition of thiophene units rendered the new materials M1 and M2 to be less crystalline when compared to tPDI-Hex. Addition of two thiophene units in the case of M2 caused a significant decrease in photoluminescence intensity.
We anticipated that the lowering of the EA via introduction of these thiophene units would have a marked effect on the Voc of the resultant solar cell devices compared to the compound having no electron rich units. While we did observe an increase in Voc from 0.95 to ∼1.05 V, we saw a negative effect on the morphology of the BHJ layers cast from chloroform, which resulted in poor Jsc and low fill factors for the solar cells made using PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2. Thus, we can conclude that while the addition of thiophene bridging units to these PDI dimers is an effective strategy for increasing Voc, a negative effect is observed on the as-cast film morphology. This may be due to the lack of tendency for M1 and M2 to form crystalline domains and may be corrected via changing the processing conditions of the active layer, as exemplified by the improved morphology and resultant PCE's of the devices obtained from PTB7-Th:M1 and PTB7-Th:M2 using o-xylene or TMB as the casting solvents. We believe that the slower evaporation rate of these solvents provides more time for the M1 and M2 acceptors to organize into more ordered nanostructures.
Further improvements in device performance may come from experimentation with various other casting solvents or additives in the typical “device optimization” process. Additionally, chemical modification of the acceptor molecules, such as ring fusion86,87 or alkyl chain modification may lead to higher efficiencies due to improved solid state organization. Further experiments exploring these avenues are underway in our lab.

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic pathways towards small molecules M1 and M2. The synthesis of tPDI-Hex is reported in previous work.24	 

 	Fig. 1  Density functional theory. (A) Dihedral angle between aromatic units. (B) Calculated electronic energy levels and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for tPDI-Hex, M1 and M2. (C) Calculated optical absorption profiles. Calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09,52 input files and results were visualized using GausView05.53 All alkyl chains were replaced with a methyl group to reduce computing time. The B3LYP54–56 level of theory with 6-31G(d,p)57–62 basis set was used for the calculations. TD-SCF63 calculations were performed from the previously optimized geometries.
