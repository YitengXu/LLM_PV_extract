    , Accepted 12th July 2018First published on 12th July 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional group-10 transition metal dichalcogenides have recently attracted increasing research interest because of their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. Herein, we present vertical hybrid heterojunctions of multilayered PtSe2 and Si, which take advantage of large-scale homogeneous PtSe2 films grown directly on Si substrates. These heterojunctions show obvious rectifying behavior and a pronounced photovoltaic effect, enabling them to function as self-driven photodetectors operating at zero bias. The photodetectors can operate in both photovoltage and photocurrent modes, with responsivity values as high as 5.26 × 106 V W−1 and 520 mA W−1 at 808 nm, respectively. The Ilight/Idark ratio, specific detectivity, and response speed are 1.5 × 105, 3.26 × 1013 Jones, and 55.3/170.5 μs, respectively. Furthermore, the heterojunctions are highly sensitive in a broad spectral region ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) (200–1550 nm). Because of the strong NIR light absorption of PtSe2, the heterojunctions exhibit photocurrent responsivities of 33.25 and 0.57 mA W−1 at telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm, respectively. Considering the excellent performance of the PtSe2/Si heterojunctions, they are highly suitable for application in high-performance broadband photodetectors. The generality of the above results also signifies that the proposed in situ synthesis method has great potential for future large-scale optoelectronic device integration.
Introduction
Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have attracted considerable attention worldwide over the past decade because of their versatile and striking material properties (e.g. tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility, strong light–matter interaction, increased optical absorption efficiency, excellent mechanical flexibility, and adjustable carrier density and polarity).1,2 Because of these distinctive features, 2D TMDs are considered to be promising building blocks for various high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices, including field-effect transistors, solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, and ultrafast lasers.3–6 Among these applications, significant efforts have been devoted to developing photodetectors, which are key components in optoelectronic systems and have practical applications in numerous innovative technologies in modern society, such as video and biomedical imaging, optical communication, environmental and security monitoring, optoelectronic integrated circuits, wearable devices and imaging pixels.7–13 Photodetectors made from pure 2D TMDs usually exhibit good performance in terms of photocurrent responsivity and selectivity.7,8 For example, a mechanically exfoliated single-layered MoS2-based phototransistor showed a high responsivity of 880 A W−1 with a distinct response cutoff wavelength at ∼680 nm.14 In addition, Zhang et al. presented a phototransistor fabricated by chemical vapor deposition-grown single-layered WSe2 with a low Schottky contact; this transistor demonstrated an extremely high responsivity of greater than 105 A W−1.15 The high responsivity is primarily related to the long lifetime of photocarriers in 2D TMDs; however, the long lifetime also results in a slow response speed, typically in the range of milliseconds to seconds. Moreover, these detectors are usually subjected to a relatively high dark current, leading to low photosensitivity. Nevertheless, high-speed and high-sensitivity photodetection is greatly desirable from the viewpoint of high-frequency optical sensing applications like military warnings, high-speed optical communication, and fast imaging. As an alternative, integrating 2D TMDs with semiconductors having mature processing technologies to form van der Waals heterostructures provides a possible solution to the above problem.7,8 These structures are normally characterized by the presence of strong built-in electric fields at the heterojunction interface, which rapidly separates photocarriers and remarkably suppresses the leakage current.16,17 Also, the structures can harness the complementary properties and advantages of both components, which is favorable for device performance improvement and may result in some new functionalities. To date, significant progress has been made in 2D TMD/Si heterostructures, and they show a rapid photoresponse with response times as short as several microseconds.18–23 However, their spectral response is usually limited to ∼1100 nm by the intrinsic optical absorption of Si (1.12 eV) due to the relatively large bandgap of 2D TMDs, which greatly restricts the applications of these heterostructures in the near-infrared (NIR) region.
As an emerging 2D TMD, single- or few-layered PtSe2 has recently shown great potential for application in high-performance photodetectors.24,25 In particular, the bandgap of PtSe2 can be tuned from zero to ∼1.2 eV by decreasing the thickness from bulk to monolayer, thus allowing photodetection in the NIR region.26 So far, various methods to synthesise 2D PtSe2 have been developed; among these, the thermally assisted conversion of pre-deposited Pt films has proved to be an ideal technique for producing large-scale PtSe2 layers with controlled thickness.24–28 By transferring the PtSe2 layers onto Si or GaAs substrates, broadband photodiodes with a maximum photocurrent responsivity of 490 mA W−1 at a relatively large operational bias of −2 V or 262 mA W−1 at zero bias have been achieved very recently.29,30 However, despite the progress, the study of 2D PtSe2-based heterostructures for optoelectronic applications is still in its infancy compared to the research on other 2D TMD-based heterostructures. Moreover, the preparation of the above photodiodes relies strongly on the polymer-assisted transfer of PtSe2, which inevitably causes material surface tear, structural continuity deterioration, and interface contamination, limiting the performance of these devices. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a facile and suitable technique that can afford high-quality homogeneous PtSe2 films on a large scale directly on semiconductors for high-performance optoelectronic applications.
In this study, using thermally assisted conversion of pre-deposited Pt films on Si substrates, we present the large-scale in situ construction of homogeneous multilayered PtSe2/Si vertical hybrid heterojunctions. The as-assembled heterojunctions exhibit remarkable rectifying characteristics with a rectification ratio of ∼1.33 × 104 within ±5 V and a small ideality factor of 1.64. Importantly, the PtSe2/Si heterojunctions display pronounced photovoltaic activity, which enables their application as self-driven photodetectors operated at zero bias. Photoresponse analysis reveals that the Ilight/Idark ratio, photovoltage/photocurrent responsivity, specific detectivity, and response speed of the photodetectors are 1.5 × 105, 5.26 × 106 V W−1/520 mA W−1, 3.26 × 1013 Jones, and 55.3/170.5 μs, respectively, under 808 nm illumination; these values are comparable to or better than those of other reported 2D material/semiconductor heterostructures. Moreover, due to extended optical absorption by PtSe2 in the NIR region, the heterojunctions can detect NIR light beyond the absorption limit of Si, making our photodetectors highly sensitive in a wide spectral region ranging from deep ultraviolet (DUV) to NIR (200–1550 nm). The photocurrent responsivities at telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm are estimated to be 33.25 and 0.57 mA W−1, respectively. The overall remarkable performance and high compatibility with the current mature electronic technologies suggest that the in situ constructed multilayered PtSe2/Si heterojunctions show great potential for future high-performance optoelectronic applications.
Experimental
Material preparation and characterization
The multilayered PtSe2 was synthesized via a thermally assisted conversion method.25 First, a ∼5 nm-thick Pt film was coated directly on a clean Si substrate using magnetron sputtering. Then, the substrate was transferred to the central zone of a furnace, and selenium (Se) powder (99.99% purity) was placed on the upstream side. The powder was heated to ∼220 °C to allow evaporation, and the evaporated gas was dragged using a 50 sccm argon flow. The temperature of the central zone was maintained at ∼380 °C. After selenization for 1 h, a grey thin film was formed on the substrate. The morphology of PtSe2 was observed using an FESEM instrument (Hitachi, SU8020). The topography of the sample was probed by AFM (Veeco NanoScope V). Raman spectra were recorded on an HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a 488 nm argon-ion laser. XPS measurements were performed using a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) produced by an XPS system. The crystal structure was studied using an FETEM instrument (JEOL Model JEM-2100F). The absorption spectra of PtSe2 in quartz, the planar Si substrate, and the PtSe2/Si hybrid heterostructure were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Device fabrication and analysis
To fabricate the PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetector, an n-type Si substrate (resistivity: 1–10 Ω cm−1) with a 300 nm-thick SiO2 insulating layer was first cleaned using acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water sequentially. Then, the insulating layer within an area of 0.14 × 0.09 cm2 was removed using a combined photolithography and buffered oxide etching process to define the active area of the heterojunction. The PtSe2 layer was prepared directly on the substrate using a thermally assisted conversion method. Subsequently, a Cr/Au (2 nm/50 nm) electrode, which served as the electrical contact for PtSe2, was deposited on PtSe2 using a lab-built shadow mask through high-vacuum electron-beam evaporation. The bottom electrical contact for n-Si was formed by attaching an indium–gallium (In–Ga) alloy to the rear side of the substrate. The electrical measurements of the devices were performed using a semiconductor characterization system (4200-SCS, Keithley Co. Ltd). For the photoresponse study, an 808 nm laser diode (Tanon Company, UV-100) with different light intensities was employed as the light source. For the response speed investigation, a function generator (Tektronix, TDS2022B) was used to power the laser diode to generate pulsed light of various frequencies, and the output electrical signal was recorded using an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS2012B). To study the spectral response, a lab-built optoelectronic system including a light source (LE-SP-LS-XE) and monochromator (LE-SP-M300) was used. A power meter (Thorlabs GmbH., PM 100D) was employed to carefully calibrate the light intensity of all light sources before the measurement. All measurements were performed in air at room temperature.
Results and discussion
The large-scale multilayered PtSe2/Si vertical hybrid heterojunctions used in this study were constructed by the in situ preparation of PtSe2 layers on Si substrates via a thermally assisted conversion method. The detailed fabrication procedures of the PtSe2 layer and the heterojunction are described in the Experimental section. The color of the Si substrate was changed obviously to grey upon conversion, and a uniform surface morphology was observed across the wafer-scale substrate (see Fig. S1†). Fig. 1a shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of the PtSe2 sample, in which a continuous and uniform film could be easily found. By studying the elemental composition using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the atomic ratio of Se/Pt was determined to be 2.09/1, which was very close to the stoichiometric composition of PtSe2. Furthermore, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image together with the height profile revealed that the PtSe2 film had a thickness of ∼14.5 nm, which corresponded to ∼17 layers of single-layered PtSe2 (Fig. 1c).24 Due to the relatively large thickness, the as-prepared 1-T phase PtSe2 could be considered to be a semimetal. Also, the AFM image implied that the sample had a relatively smooth surface. To further confirm the uniformity of the sample, we studied the Raman spectra of random areas of the PtSe2 film prepared on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 Si substrate. As shown in Fig. 1d, all spectra showed two prominent peaks at ∼177 cm−1 and ∼207 cm−1, which could be assigned to the Eg in-plane vibrational mode of Se atoms moving away from each other within the layer and the A1g out-of-plane vibrational mode of Se atoms in opposite directions, respectively.31 The ratio of the intensities of the two distinct peaks showed a very narrow distribution, suggesting a good uniformity of PtSe2 with few defects (Fig. S2a†). Fig. 1e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, in which four diffraction peaks positioned at 16.76°, 27.58°, 48.88° and 69.06° correspond to the (001), (100), (110) and (202) crystal planes of PtSe2, respectively. Moreover, according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 1f and g), the peaks corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 were located at 73.30 and 76.65 eV, respectively, whereas those corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 were situated at 54.70 and 55.45 eV, respectively. Fig. 1h shows the field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) image of the PtSe2 film. The as-synthesized material was polycrystalline with nanometre-sized crystalline domains of various thicknesses. The inset in Fig. 1h shows the diffraction rings, which could be ascribed to the (001), (100), (101), (110), and (200) planes of PtSe2 from the inside to the outside.32 Further analysis of the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1i) indicated that these crystalline domains have two different interplanar spacings, in which ca. 0.53 and 0.15 nm correspond to the (001) and (202) lattice planes of PtSe2, respectively. This result matched well with the XRD observation. Also, based on the statistical analysis of the HRTEM images of several PtSe2 samples (Fig. S2b†), we observed that the crystalline domains with the (001) plane possess an interplanar spacing distribution of 0.47–0.59 nm, with an average value of 0.53 nm. The value was in accordance with our previous observations of PtSe2 synthesized on a SiO2/Si substrate33 and was very close to the previously reported interlayer distance of PtSe2.34 A relatively large variation in interplanar spacing probably originated from the local distortion of PtSe2 crystal lattices due to the incorporation of excessive Se element, as revealed by our EDS analysis.

Fig. 2b plots the current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of a representative PtSe2/Si heterojunction measured in the dark. Remarkably, the heterojunction exhibited a typical rectifying behaviour, with the rectification ratio determined to be ∼1.33 × 104 within ±5 V, which was much higher than that previously reported for multilayered MoS2/Si (∼5 × 103)18 and PtSe2/GaAs (∼120) heterojunctions.30 The good ohmic contact of both Au-PtSe2-Au and In/Ga–Si–In/Ga structures (Fig. S3a†) confirmed that this rectifying characteristic exclusively originated from the heterojunction formed between PtSe2 and Si. From the slope of the lnI–V curve, shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, the ideality factor (n) of the heterojunction could be deduced to be ∼1.64. Although this value somewhat deviated from that of an ideal diode (n = 1), it was comparable to that of the graphene/Si heterojunction (n = 1.56, with a power conversion efficiency of up to 14.5%)35 and superior to that of the MoS2/Si heterojunction (1.83) reported previously.18

(d) Time-dependent photoresponse of the heterojunction under 808 nm illumination at zero bias. 
Next, we examined the photoresponse properties of the PtSe2/Si heterojunction. Fig. 2c compares the I–V curves of the device under various conditions; as shown in the figure, the heterojunction displayed remarkable photovoltaic activity under 808 nm illumination (87.6 μW cm−2). The photovoltage and photocurrent were 0.28 V and 1.48 μA, respectively, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency of ∼8%. This photovoltaic behavior suggested that our heterojunction could function as a self-driven photodetector operating without an external power supply. Also, the dark current of the heterojunction with a device area of 1.26 mm2 was ∼10.80 pA at zero bias. The small dark current was due to the presence of a built-in electric field, which suppressed the charge recombination at the heterojunction and was therefore favorable for achieving high photosensitivity.36 The time-dependent photoresponse of the heterojunction under periodically switched NIR illumination was further characterized, as shown in Fig. 2d. The device was highly sensitive to the incident light and could be reversibly switched between high- and low-conductance states, giving a stable and repeatable Ilight/Idark ratio of ∼1.5 × 105. We noted that the rise and fall edges were extremely steep, suggesting that the photoexcited electrons and holes could be rapidly generated and separated in the heterojunction. In fact, the device possessed good stability and reproducibility to pulsed illumination, and the photoresponse remained almost invariant even after thousands of cycles of operation (Fig. S3b†).
We have studied the thickness dependence of PtSe2 layers on the photoresponse characteristics. Irrespective of PtSe2 thicknesses, all PtSe2/Si heterojunctions were observed to exhibit a photovoltaic behavior under 808 nm NIR illumination (see Fig. S4†). As the PtSe2 thickness increased from ∼2.5 to ∼14.5 nm, however, the photocurrent level enhanced consistently from 1.51 nA to 1.48 μA, while the photovoltage varied slightly from 0.22 to 0.30 V. The sheet resistance of PtSe2 layers has been reported to increase gradually via a phase transition from semi-metallic to semiconductor by thinning their thickness.28 Accordingly, a low photocurrent observed in thinner PtSe2 samples would be reasonable to stem from the overall inferior performances of charge carrier transport and collection capabilities from PtSe2 to top Au because of the increased sheet resistances of PtSe2. A further increase in the thickness of the precursor Pt film, however, led to a serious difficulty in selenization, resulting in an optimal PtSe2 thickness of ∼14.5 nm in our study.
We further investigated the light intensity-dependent photoresponse properties of the PtSe2/Si heterojunction. Fig. 3a shows the I–V characteristics under 808 nm NIR illumination with varying light intensities (1.75–87.6 μW cm−2), and the I–V curves in a broader light intensity range (0.71 μW cm−2–13.93 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S5a and b.† Apparently, both the photovoltage and photocurrent increased gradually with increasing light intensity, which could be explained by the increased number of photocarriers at a higher light intensity. However, the photovoltage increased rapidly from 97.1 to 353.9 mV when the light intensity was changed from 0.71 μW cm−2 to 0.36 mW cm−2, and a further increase in the light intensity led to a slow increase in the photovoltage (Fig. 3b). The maximum photovoltage theoretically achieved by our heterojunction device was ∼590 mV, supposedly determined by the Fermi level difference between PtSe2 and Si from the energy band diagram, which will be discussed later. Such a relatively large value suggested that the performance of the device could be further improved by optimizing the junction interface, electrical contact, and other parameters.17,37 In addition, a similar tendency was observed in the light intensity-dependent photocurrent at zero bias (Fig. 3b). The underlying reasons could be understood by fitting the dependence of photocurrent on light intensity to a general power law: Iph ∝ Pθ, where θ is an empirical value that reflects the recombination of photoexcited carriers.38 As plotted in the inset of Fig. 3b, when we fitted the curve in a low light intensity range, a nearly ideal exponent of θ = 0.99 was achieved, whereas a non-ideal value of θ = 0.65 was achieved when we fitted the curve in a high light intensity range. The fitting results suggested that the recombination loss was negligible at lower light intensity and became much stronger at higher light intensity.38 The large recombination loss at an elevated light intensity was likely caused by the intensified recombination activity of the charge carriers owing to the higher density of the photoexcited carriers as well as the existence of some trap states between the Fermi level and the conduction band edge.33

(e) Time-dependent photoresponse of the device under different biases. (f) Photovoltage and photocurrent responsivities as functions of incident light intensity. 
Additionally, we found that at higher light intensities the I–V curves deviated significantly from the ideal photodiode-like response (Fig. S5a and b†) and that there was a strong suppression of the photocurrent at zero bias and a sharp rise and rapid saturation of the photocurrent under reverse bias (the photocurrent could not reach saturation within the measurement range for a light intensity exceeding 3.29 mW cm−2). This odd photoresponse behavior was observed in many heterojunction photodetectors21,22,39 and could be correlated with the carrier transport process and energy band diagrams, as illustrated in Fig. 3c and d. The Fermi level (EF) of multilayered PtSe2 was located at ∼4.84 eV according to our previous ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy study.33 In a rough estimation, the work function of n-Si with a resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm was deduced to be ∼4.25 eV.40 Therefore, to achieve thermal equilibrium, when the two materials were in contact with each other, electrons diffused from Si to PtSe2, leaving positively charged empty states within the depletion region in Si, until the Fermi levels aligned. Consequently, the energy levels near the Si surface bent upward, leading to the formation of a built-in electric field at the PtSe2/Si interface. Similar to other graphene/semiconductor heterojunctions,16,17 upon illumination with a photon energy higher than the bandgap of Si (Eg = 1.12 eV), electron–hole pairs were generated mainly within and in the vicinity of the depletion region in Si. The electrons and holes were then rapidly separated by the built-in electric field and collected by the respective electrodes, ultimately generating the photocurrent (Fig. 3c). At high light intensity, there was an increased density of photoexcited carriers, which resulted in the remarkably intensified recombination activity of charge carriers, as discussed above. Thus, the extraction of photocarriers was greatly limited, leading to a suppressed photocurrent at zero bias. However, under reverse bias, an external electric field in the same direction as the built-in one could greatly facilitate the separation of photocarriers.8 Moreover, the depletion region could be extended by the reverse bias, enabling more photoexcited carriers to participate in photocurrent generation (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the photocurrent increased with increasing reverse operational bias. When the reverse bias was sufficiently high, the photocurrent becomes saturated once all photocarriers were extracted and contributed to the photocurrent. Although the photocurrent at high light intensity increased with increasing reverse bias, the Ilight/Idark ratio decreased by a maximum of two orders of magnitude due to the significantly increased dark current at reverse bias (Fig. 3e). Based on the above analysis, it was expected that the photoresponse properties at high light intensity could be optimized by further enlarging the built-in electric field through some strategies, e.g. improving the working function of the PtSe2 layers via chemical doping in the future.25,41
The observed sizeable photovoltage and photocurrent under illumination implied that our PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetector could operate in both photovoltage and photocurrent modes. To quantitatively evaluate the device performance, we calculated the responsivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE), which are the critical performance figure-of-merits for a photodetector. The responsivity is defined as the photovoltage or photocurrent generated per unit power of light incident on the active area, while EQE is the ratio between the number of photoexcited electron–hole pairs contributing to the photocurrent and the number of incident photons and is normally given by the following equations:42 (1) (2)where RV/RI, Vph/Iph, Pin, q, λ, h, c, and G are the photovoltage/photocurrent responsivity, photovoltage/photocurrent, input light power, elementary charge, light wavelength, Planck's constant, speed of light, and photoconductive gain, respectively. Accordingly, RV could reach as high as 5.26 × 106 V W−1 at a low light intensity (0.71 μW cm−2), which exceeded the corresponding RV value of the single-walled carbon nanotube/Si heterojunction (∼105 V W−1)43 and was close to that of the graphene/Si heterojunction (∼107 V W−1).39 The high value also suggested that our device was highly suitable for low-power weak optical signal detection. In addition, the maximum RI was found to be 520 mA W−1, comparable to that of the graphene/Si heterojunction (435–730 mA W−1)38,39 and the multilayered MoS2/Si heterojunction (330 mA W−1) at zero bias18 and the recently reported PtSe2/Si heterojunction at a bias of −2 V (490 mA W−1) (see Table 1).25,29 Furthermore, based on eqn (2), EQE was estimated to be as high as ∼80% at low light intensity, given that G is the unit in photodiodes without an internal gain mechanism.7 Such a large value indicated that most incident photons were converted to electron–hole pairs and contributed to the photocurrent.

The light intensity dependence of RV/RI was also explored, as plotted in Fig. 3f. Apparently, RV decreased gradually with increasing light intensity, similar to the trend observed in the graphene/Si heterojunction photodetector.39 In contrast, RI could remain almost constant within nearly three orders of magnitude of light intensity, implying that our device had a linear response in this region. Generally, the linear dynamic range (LDR) is also an important performance parameter and is usually expressed as follows:46 (3)where  is the photocurrent measured at a light intensity of 1 mW cm−2 (∼5.05 × 10−6 A) and Id is the dark current (∼1.1 × 10−11 A). The LDR for our device was deduced to be ∼114 dB, which was close to that of a traditional Si photodiode (120 dB).46
Furthermore, we studied the specific detectivity (D*), which reflects the ability of a photodetector to detect weak light signals and is obtained as follows:47 D* = A1/2R/(2qId)1/2(4)where A is the effective area of the device and Id is the dark current. Thus, the maximum D* value was calculated to be 3.26 × 1013 Jones. Significantly, this value was comparable to the D* values of previously reported 2D material/three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor heterojunction photodetectors (see Table 1).18,22,44,45,48
We further characterized the light wavelength dependence of RI and D*, as shown in Fig. 4a. The PtSe2/Si heterojunction exhibited a pronounced photoresponse in the broad spectral region of 200–1200 nm, with a peak response at around 800 nm. Interestingly, we found that even under illumination with a photon energy (hν) lower than the bandgap of Si (Eg), our device could show a distinct photoresponse. This was in deep contrast to the behavior of conventional Si photodiodes, which showed a response cutoff wavelength of ∼1100 nm.40 Therefore, the NIR photoresponse beyond the absorption limit of Si could be associated with the strong optical absorption of PtSe2 in this spectral region (Fig. 4d). In fact, as shown in the energy band diagrams (Fig. 3c and d), when the incident light had a photon energy less than the bandgap of Si and greater than the heterojunction barrier height (ΦB < hν < Eg), the electrons excited from PtSe2 had enough energy to overcome the barrier and were injected into the conduction band of Si, contributing to the photocurrent. To better understand the wavelength-dependent photoresponse, we recorded a time-dependent photoresponse under DUV (200 nm) and NIR illumination at optical telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm (O band) and 1550 nm (C band), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b and c, although the photoresponse was relatively low, the device was capable of detecting both DUV and NIR illumination with good stability and reproducibility. The RI values at wavelengths of 200, 1310 and 1550 nm were calculated to be 23.58, 33.25, and 0.57 mA W−1, respectively. Moreover, the Ilight/Idark ratio could reach as high as ∼105 at 1310 nm with increasing light intensity (Fig. S5c†). The excellent performance suggested that our device has potential applications for DUV light detection and optical telecommunication. It is reasonable that the NIR photoresponse could be further improved by enhancing NIR absorption through some strategies such as increasing PtSe2 thicknesses and integrating the plasmonic metallic nanostructures resonating in the NIR range.49

Response speed, which reflects the capability of a photodetector to track a rapidly varying light signal, was evaluated under a high-frequency optical signal provided by an 808 nm laser diode driven by a function generator (Fig. 5a). The temporal photoresponse signal (photovoltage with time) was recorded using a digital oscilloscope. Fig. 5b–d depict the photoresponse of the PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetector to the pulsed light of various frequencies of 1, 5, and 20 kHz, respectively. Remarkably, the device exhibited excellent switching properties with a fast response speed and good repeatability at all frequencies. Furthermore, we have calculated the response speed from the photoresponse curve magnified at 2 kHz (Fig. 5e). In the time domain, the rise (or fall) time is defined as the time required for the photoresponse to increase (or decrease) from 10% (or 90%) to 90% (or 10%) out of the peak value.50 As a result, the rise and fall time (τr and τf) was estimated to be 55.3 and 170.5 μs, respectively. It was worth noting that the response speed was comparable to those of the MoS2/Si heterojunctions,18,23 the graphene/Si heterojunctions,38 and many other pure 2D material-based photodetectors.14,15,51–53 Such a relatively rapid response speed could be associated with the special device architecture, which was favorable for the fast separation and transport of photoexcited carriers. Clean heterojunction interfaces (by in situ preparation) are beneficial for decreasing the number of interfacial defects, resulting in a lower probability in trapping/de-trapping of photogenerated carriers, also supporting a fast response speed. In addition, the relative balance (Vmax − Vmin)/Vmax of the photoresponse as a function of frequency was summarized, as shown in Fig. 5f. The relative balance displayed a relatively slow decay and the value decreased by ∼40% at the frequency of 4 kHz. Besides, the 3 dB frequency, defined as the frequency at which the photoresponse decreases to 0.707 of the maximum photoresponse value, was deduced to be ∼2.7 kHz. The above results implied that our PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetector was capable of monitoring rapid optical signals and was, therefore, promising for high-speed photodetection.

The long-term air stability of photodetectors is of pivotal importance for practical application. We have studied the air stability of PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetectors by storing in air for six months without encapsulation. No obvious degradations in rectifying, photovoltaic behavior, and time-dependent photoresponse were observed (see Fig. 6), validating their superior air stability. Such good air stability is attributed not only to the outstanding air-stable characteristics of PtSe2, but also to a thick, compact film morphology preventing oxidation at the heterojunction interface.

Conclusions
To conclude, the large-scale in situ fabrication of multilayered PtSe2/Si vertical hybrid heterojunctions was achieved using thermally assisted conversion of pre-deposited Pt films on Si substrates. The pronounced photovoltaic effect afforded the heterojunctions with a capability to function as self-driven photodetectors, which exhibited high photovoltage/photocurrent responsivities of 5.26 × 106 V W−1/520 mA W−1, a high Ilight/Idark ratio exceeding 1.5 × 105, a large specific detectivity of 3.26 × 1013 Jones, and a rapid response speed of 55.3/170.5 μs under 808 nm illumination. Further photoresponse analysis showed that these heterojunctions displayed high sensitivity to illumination in a broad wavelength range from the DUV to NIR spectral regions (200–1550 nm). The NIR photoresponse beyond the absorbance cutoff wavelength of Si was attributed to the strong NIR absorption of PtSe2 films. At telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm, the heterojunction photodetectors achieved photocurrent responsivities of 33.25 and 0.57 mA W−1, respectively. It was expected that these high-performance in situ constructed multilayered PtSe2/Si heterojunction photodetectors have potential applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.
