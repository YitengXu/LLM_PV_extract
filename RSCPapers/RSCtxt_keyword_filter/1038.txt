    , Accepted 17th August 2019First published on 21st August 2019AbstractTwo isomeric fused undecacyclic electron acceptors (FUIC and i-FUIC) are designed and synthesized via a one stone two birds strategy based on core unit 4TT (four thienothiophene units condensed with three cyclopentadienyl rings) and end groups 2FIC (2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile). The only difference is the two attachment positions between 4TT and 2FIC, α, α-positions for FUIC and α, β-positions for i-FUIC. FUIC exhibits stronger and red-shifted absorption with an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.22 eV (1.28 eV for i-FUIC), a down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of −4.06 eV (−3.99 eV for i-FUIC), the same highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of −5.31 eV and a higher electron mobility of 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for i-FUIC). Organic solar cells based on a blend of PTB7-Th:FUIC exhibit a power conversion efficiency as high as 11.2% with a high fill factor of 70.6%, higher than that of PTB7-Th:i-FUIC (10.3%).
Introduction
Solution-processable bulk heterojunction1 organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention since they have several advantages, such as low cost, light weight, flexibility, and semitransparency, and are promising for utilization of solar energy.2–4 For a long time, fullerene derivatives have been well-known and often-used electron acceptor materials in OSCs,5 and have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 11%.6 However, further development of fullerene-based OSCs has been restricted by the shortcomings of fullerene acceptors, such as weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral region and limited energy level variability. In the past few years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to developing novel nonfullerene electron acceptors with intense absorption and adjustable energy levels; rylene imides (e.g. perylene diimide and naphthalene diimide) and fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) are two categories of promising alternative materials.7,8 In contrast to fullerene derivatives and rylene imides, FREAs with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, consisting of electron-donating extended fused rings and electron-accepting terminal groups, present some unique merits, such as facile chemical tailoring, efficient electronic modulation, and strong NIR absorption. Since we reported the first FREA, i.e. the benchmark molecule ITIC9 in 2015, the development of the FREA family has been rapid and prosperous, and FREA-based OSCs have exhibited PCEs of >13%.10–18
FREAs with an ultra-narrow bandgap have potential applications in semitransparent,19,20 ternary-blend21 and tandem OSCs,18 and have received increasing attention recently. However, FREAs with an absorption edge >1000 nm (optical bandgap <1.24 eV) still remain rare due to the difficult synthesis of core fused-ring units which are sensitive to oxygen and light.22–26 On the other hand, most molecular frameworks of these FREAs comprise the electron-donating core, end-capped groups and alkoxy substituted thiophene bridges. The thiophene bridges may cause intramolecular rotation, and the non-rigid structure is unfavorable for molecular stacking and charge transport. OSCs based on these acceptors generally exhibit a relatively low fill factor (FF) of <70% (Fig. S1 and Table S1†).
The isomer effect has been proven to play an important role in the OSC field.27,28 For instance, the classical fullerene derivative PC71BM was synthesized by one-pot reaction, yielding a mixture of three isomers. One isomer exhibits very poor PCE, while the other two show relatively good performance.29 For the classical nonfullerene acceptor perylene diimide, 1,6-/1,7-regioisomers were also obtained, which exhibit different photovoltaic properties.30 As for FREAs, isomer effects have been investigated in terms of fused-ring cores,13 end-capped groups,31,32 side-chains33 and core-terminus connection positions.34 However, all these FREA isomers are synthesized through different starting materials and reactions, which is time-consuming and cumbersome.
Here, we design and synthesize two isomeric fused undecacyclic electron acceptors (FUIC and i-FUIC, Chart 1) with strong NIR absorption over 1000 nm via a one stone two birds strategy. First, we design and synthesize a novel strong electron-donating building block, 4TT, where four thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units are condensed with three cyclopentadienyl rings (Scheme 1). Compared with 3TT that we reported before,35,36 4TT not only forms the rigid backbone and strong molecular packing but also extends the conjugation length to enhance the electron-donating properties. Then, we synthesize two key intermediates, aldehyde isomers, in one reaction. Finally, FUIC and i-FUIC are synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation reactions between aldehydes and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (2FIC).31 Efficient intramolecular charge transfer between strong electron-donating 4TT and strong electron-withdrawing 2FIC extends absorption into the NIR region. Meanwhile, the noncovalent F–S and F–H bonds enhance intermolecular interactions and charge transport. The only difference between the two isomers is 4TT/2FIC connection positions: for FUIC, two 2FIC units are attached to the α-position of the outermost thiophene units in 4TT, whereas they are attached to the α- and β-positions in i-FUIC. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high-performance FREA isomers have been synthesized via a one stone two birds strategy.

FUIC exhibits strong absorption in the 650–1020 nm region with a peak at 894 nm which redshifts 86 nm relative to that of i-FUIC. The absorption extinction coefficient of FUIC is 2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1, higher than that of i-FUIC (1.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1). FUIC exhibits the same highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−5.31 eV) but downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (−4.06 eV), compared with i-FUIC (LUMO = −3.99 eV). The electron mobility of FUIC (6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of i-FUIC (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). OSCs based on blends of PTB7-Th37 donor and FUIC acceptor exhibit PCEs as high as 11.2% with a high FF of 70.6%, which is higher than that of PTB7-Th:i-FUIC (PCE = 10.3%). The FUIC and i-FUIC-based devices exhibit a small energy loss (Eloss) of 0.53 eV and 0.50 eV, respectively. FUIC is the first FREA with an ultra-narrow bandgap <1.24 eV and a very high FF >70%.
Results and discussion
Compound 4TT was synthesized via a 4-step reaction (Scheme 1). 4TT, POCl3 and DMF were added to 1,2-dichloroethane solution at room temperature, and the solution was stirred at 85 °C for 12 h to yield a mixture of two isomers (total yield: 77%). To study the components and chemical structures of the mixture, we separated the mixture to afford two pure aldehydes (42% 4TT-CHO and 58% i-4TT-CHO in the mixture). We further changed the synthetic conditions to see if we could control the selectivity of formylation on the 4TT unit. Interestingly, when 4TT was added to the Vilsmeier reagent prepared in 1,2-dichloroethane solution at 0 °C, the solution was stirred at 75 °C for 12 h, and the product was mainly 4TT-CHO (74%). Meanwhile, when 4TT was lithiated by n-butyllithium in THF solution at −78 °C and quenched with dry DMF, the yields of two isomers were 52% for 4TT-CHO and 23% for i-4TT-CHO. The yields of isomers can be controlled through varying the synthetic conditions, which is beneficial for synthesizing a specific isomer.
The difference between the two isomers is that for 4TT-CHO, two CHO units are attached to the α-position of the outermost thiophene units in 4TT, whereas they are attached to the α- and β-positions of thiophene in i-4TT-CHO. To investigate why two isomeric aldehydes can be obtained simultaneously, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted on 4TT along with indacenodithiophene (IDT), which is a classical electron-donating core and only yields α-aldehyde when treated with n-butyllithium/DMF or the Vilsmeier reagent, for comparison (Fig. S2†). The charges on the α- and β-carbons of IDT are −0.311 and −0.049, respectively, while those for 4TT are −0.354 and −0.133, respectively. The charge difference between α- and β-carbons of 4TT is smaller than that of IDT, and thus the electrophilic substitution on 4TT has lower selectivity on α- and β-positions relative to IDT.
Finally, FUIC and i-FUIC were synthesized using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the mixture of aldehydes and 2FIC. To understand the effect of the aldehyde isomeric mixture on the yields of final products FUIC and i-FUIC, we also used pure 4TT-CHO/i-4TT-CHO to react with 2FIC. The final step reaction using either the aldehyde isomeric mixture or pure isomer afforded similar total yields of FUIC/i-FUIC (64–70%).
The new compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. As shown in Fig. S3,† the chemical shift of the protons on the vinylidene groups between 4TT and 2FIC units in FUIC is one singlet (peak no. 1), while the chemical shifts of the protons on vinylidene in i-FUIC are two singlets (peak no. 1′ and 5′). Other protons' chemical shifts are also different between the two isomers. FUIC and i-FUIC have good solubility in common organic solvents, such as o-dichlorobenzene and chloroform at room temperature. FUIC exhibits better thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 326 °C than that of i-FUIC (Td = 187 °C), measured by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S4† and Table 1).

The normalized absorption spectra of FUIC and i-FUIC in solution and thin films are shown in Fig. S5† and 1(a). In chloroform solution (10−6 M), FUIC exhibits stronger absorption in the 650–1020 nm region with a maximum molar extinction coefficient of ε = 2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 838 nm, while i-FUIC shows a blue-shifted maximum absorption peak at 776 nm with ε = 1.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1). Relative to that of solution, the main absorption peaks of FUIC and i-FUIC films red-shift by 56 and 32 nm, respectively, indicating stronger molecular aggregation of FUIC in the film. The optical bandgap of FUIC film is 1.22 eV, calculated from the absorption edge (1017 nm), which is smaller than that of i-FUIC (1.28 eV) and is among the smallest bandgaps for the reported nonfullerene acceptors.

The electrochemical properties of FUIC and i-FUIC were investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. 1b). FUIC and i-FUIC show almost the same HOMO energy levels of −5.31 eV, while the LUMO energy levels of the two isomers are −4.06 eV and −3.99 eV, respectively, estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0), assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. The attachment positions between the core unit and end groups of FREAs have a considerable influence on the LUMO energy level while the effect on the HOMO energy level is negligible. The electron mobilities of FUIC and i-FUIC were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC)38 method in electron-only devices with the structure Al/acceptor/Al (Fig. S6† and Table 1). FUIC film exhibits a higher electron mobility of 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than i-FUIC (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
To investigate the photovoltaic behaviors of the two isomers in OSC devices, we selected PTB7-Th as the donor material. PTB7-Th and the two isomers exhibit strong and complementary absorption in the 500–1000 nm region (Fig. 1a), beneficial for the sufficient utility of solar energy and high short circuit-current density (JSC). The energy levels of PTB7-Th (LUMO = −3.59 eV; HOMO = −5.20 eV)39 match well with those of FUIC and i-FUIC, facilitating efficient exciton dissociation. We fabricated OSCs with the structure ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The optimization details of the devices are listed in Table S2.†Table 2 summarizes the open-circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, FF, and PCE of the optimized devices. After treatment with 1% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min, the device based on PTB7-Th:FUIC shows a VOC of 0.692 V, JSC of 22.9 mA cm−2, FF of 70.6% and PCE of 11.2%, while the device based on PTB7-Th:i-FUIC exhibits a higher VOC of 0.782 V, lower JSC of 20.9 mA cm−2, FF of 63.0% and PCE of 10.3% after being optimized with 0.2% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The higher JSC of the FUIC-based device is related to red-shifted absorption of FUIC, while the higher VOC of i-FUIC is attributed to the higher LUMO of i-FUIC. The FF of 70.6% is the highest value for the devices based on an acceptor with an ultra-narrow optical bandgap <1.24 eV (Fig. 2a) and the PCE of 11.2% is also among the highest PCEs for the devices above (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the corresponding Eloss of devices is 0.53 eV for the PTB7-Th:FUIC-based device and 0.50 eV for the PTB7-Th:i-FUIC-based device, which are both among the smallest values for high-efficiency OSCs (PCE > 10%) reported so far.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performance devices are shown in Fig. 3b. The optimized device based on PTB7-Th:FUIC exhibits a broader and stronger photoresponse with EQE over 60% in the 550–880 nm region, while the device based on PTB7-Th:i-FUIC has a maximum value of 67.7% at 720 nm. The calculated JSC values obtained from the integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum are 22.3 and 20.3 mA cm−2 for the PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC based devices, which have a 2.6 and 2.9% mismatch with those from J–V measurement (22.9 and 20.9 mA cm−2), respectively.

We investigated the light stability of OSCs based on PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC without encapsulation under continuous illumination (AM 1.5G solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. S7†). After continuous illumination for 120 min, the PCE of the PTB7-Th:FUIC-based devices decreases by a factor of 12% and then remains stable until 180 min. However, the PCE of the PTB7-Th:i-FUIC-based devices continuously decays by a factor of 42% after 180 min. The better light stability appears to be related to the weaker absorption of FUIC in the high-energy region.
To investigate the charge generation, dissociation, and extraction properties, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs (Fig. 3c).40 At high Veff (>1.2 V), supposing that almost all the excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes, the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) only depends on the absorbed incident photons, and thus the value of JSC/Jsat can reflect the degree of charge extraction under short-circuit conditions. The JSC/Jsat is calculated to be >95% for the PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC based devices, suggesting efficient charge extraction in the FUIC and i-FUIC-based devices.
We also measured JSC under illumination at different incident light intensities (Plight) to reveal charge recombination under short-circuit conditions (Fig. 3d). Theoretically, JSC and PlightS have a positive correlation. If all free charge carriers are collected at the electrodes rather than being allowed to recombine, S should be 1; however S < 1 indicates that bimolecular recombination exists in some cases. For the PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC based devices, the values of S are estimated to be 0.95 and 0.93 under short-circuit conditions, respectively, suggesting weaker bimolecular recombination in the PTB7-Th:FUIC based devices.
The hole mobility and electron mobility of the PTB7-Th:acceptor blended films were measured by the SCLC method (Fig. S8†). The device based on PTB7-Th:FUIC (μh = 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh/μe = 0.83) has higher and more balanced charge mobilities than the device based on PTB7-Th:i-FUIC (μh = 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh/μe = 0.71), which is beneficial for the higher FF of the devices.41,42
The morphology of the blended films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)43 and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The blended films of PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC exhibit a smooth surface with similar root-mean-square roughness values of 1.24 nm and 1.20 nm, respectively (Fig. S9†).
Fig. S10† and 4 present the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the intensity profiles along the qz and qr axes of the pure PTB7-Th, FUIC, and i-FUIC, and optimized PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC blend films. Consistent with previous results, pure PTB7-Th film shows a dominant “face-on” orientation with the lamellar peak at qr = 0.267 Å−1 (d = 23.5 Å) and the π–π peak at qz = 1.61 Å−1 (d = 3.90 Å). Both pure FUIC and i-FUIC films exhibit weak scattering intensity, indicating relatively low crystallinity (Fig. S10†). For blend films, the PTB7-Th:FUIC film shows a preferential “face-on” orientation and high crystallinity with two distinct lamellar peaks appearing in the qr axis. The lamellar peak at qr = 0.271 Å−1 (d = 23.2 Å), with the corresponding crystallite coherence length (CCL) of 4.84 nm, is assigned to PTB7-Th. The other lamellar peak at qr = 0.354 Å−1 (d = 17.7 Å, CCL = 3.08 nm) is more likely to originate from FUIC. The out-of-plane π–π peak concentrates at qz = 1.64 Å−1 (d = 3.83 Å, CCL = 1.32 nm). It is indicated that PTB7-Th experiences tighter packing after mixing with FUIC. The scattering profiles of PTB7-Th:i-FUIC film show weaker scattering intensity with the lamellar peak at qr = 0.273 Å−1 (d = 23.0 Å, CCL = 5.81 nm) and the π–π peak at qz = 1.63 Å−1 (d = 3.85 Å, CCL = 1.48 nm), signifying face-on oriented packing but with relatively lower crystallinity. These peaks should mainly come from PTB7-Th crystalline domains due to the weak scattering of i-FUIC. Together, the higher crystallinity and the sharper π–π peak of the PTB7-Th:FUIC blend film correlate well with its better device performance.

GISAXS measurements were also performed to estimate the phase separation length scales as shown in Fig. 4c and S11.† The in-plane scattering profiles versus qr are fitted with standard models presented elsewhere in detail.44 The intermixing domain sizes are extracted to be 37.8 and 16.3 nm, and the acceptor domain sizes are 33.0 and 13.0 nm for PTB7-Th:FUIC and PTB7-Th:i-FUIC films, respectively. Both of the films exhibit reasonable phase separation length scales, enabling efficient exciton separation and charge carrier transport for high-performance devices.
Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized a fused tetra(thienothiophene) unit (4TT) with strong electron-donating and molecular packing properties. Based on 4TT, two isomeric fused undecacyclic electron acceptors (FUIC and i-FUIC) were synthesized via a one stone two birds strategy, using strong electron-withdrawing 2FIC as end groups. The only difference between the two molecules is that for FUIC, two 2FIC units are attached to the α-position of the outermost thiophene units in 4TT, whereas the two 2FIC units are attached onto the α- and β-positions in i-FUIC. FUIC exhibits absorption in the 650–1020 nm region with a peak at 894 nm which redshifts 86 nm relative to that of i-FUIC. The absorption extinction coefficient of FUIC is 2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1, higher than that of i-FUIC (1.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1). FUIC exhibits the same HOMO energy level but a 0.07 eV downshifted LUMO energy level, compared with i-FUIC. Furthermore, the electron mobility of FUIC is double that of i-FUIC. OSCs based on blends of PTB7-Th donor and FUIC acceptor exhibit PCEs as high as 11.2% with a high FF of 70.6%, higher than that of PTB7-Th:i-FUIC (10.3%). FUIC is the first FREA with an ultra-narrow optical bandgap <1.24 eV as well as a high FF >70%. Our results demonstrate that the attachment positions between the core unit and end groups have a significant influence on the optical and electrical properties, and photovoltaic performance of fused-ring electron acceptors.
