        redox (3I−/I3−), polysulfide redox (S2−/Sx2−), organic redox [TMTU/TMFDS2+: tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], ferrocene redox (Fc/Fc+), nickel redox [Ni(II)/Ni(III)], and cobalt redox [Co(II)/Co(III)] hole conducting electrolytes were systematically investigated to determine their suitability for use in Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells. A long-term stability test and UV-visible spectral analyses revealed that Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells worked stably with Co(II)(o-phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(o-phen)3(TFSI)3 [TFSI: bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] as the redox mediator.
Introduction
Quantum-dot (QD)- or extremely thin absorber (ETA)-sensitized solar cells (SSCs) have attracted significant attention as promising alternatives to conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (D-SSCs). This is because they have several advantageous properties: stronger absorption than Ru/organic dyes; convenience of band gap tailoring by the quantum confinement effect according to particle size; efficient separation of the generated charge carriers by a large intrinsic dipole moment; good stability; and multiple exciton generation.1 Therefore, many research groups have intensively studied QD-SSCs based on metal chalcogenides such as CdS(e)2 and PbS(e),3 and have achieved great improvements in their power conversion efficiency.
Among the metal chalcogenides, Sb2S3 seems to be a very attractive candidate because it has a high optical absorption coefficient that extends up to α = 105 cm−1 in visible light, and a suitable energy band gap of about 1.7–1.9 eV.4 Further, unlike the other metal chalcogenides, Sb2S3 has several unique properties such as a low melting temperature and a parallel chain-like layered structure; consequently, the Sb-based chalcogenides can serve as an electron-crystal phonon-glass, which is a useful attribute when used in thermoelectric devices. In parallel chain-like structures such as stibnite (Sb2S3), one Sb atom is formally tri- coordinated to three S atoms in a plane by strong covalent bonds, and the other Sb atom is penta- coordinated to five S atoms, of which three S atoms are connected by strong covalent bonds within the same chain and two S atoms are connected by weak van der Waals bonds to the next parallel chain.5 Accordingly, a Sb2S3 sensitizer exhibits relatively strong reactivity to surrounding materials owing to the two weakly bonded S atoms.
Itzhaik et al.6 reported a solid-state Sb2S3-based ETA solar cell with an n-type photoanode/semiconductor sensitizer/p-type hole conductor configuration, i.e., mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/Sb2S3/CuSCN. Moon et al.7 reported a Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell comprising mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene). Recently, we also reported a nanostructured Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell using poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) hole-conducting polymer.8 These completely solid-state Sb2S3-based solar cells confirm the suitability of Sb2S3 as a light-absorbing sensitizer. However, most liquid electrolytes have a corrosive effect on the unique structure of stibnite (Sb2S3). It was, therefore, a prerequisite to find a liquid redox couple electrolyte that was stable toward a Sb2S3 sensitizer in order to develop Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells. Here, we systematically compared the stability of Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells in various liquid redox electrolytes, such as iodide redox (3I−/I3−), polysulfide redox (S2−/Sx2−), organic redox [TMTU/TMFDS2+: tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], ferrocene redox (Fc/Fc+), nickel redox [Ni(II)/Ni(III)], and cobalt redox [Co(II)/Co(III)] electrolytes.

            Nickel
            redox [Ni(III)/Ni(IV)]10. 
A mixture of two solvents (methoxypropionitrile (MPN) and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 1:1) contains 0.1 M tetramethylammonium (TMA) Ni(III) bis(dicarbollide), 0.006 M of Ni(IV) bis(dicarbollide), and 0.002 M of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) hexafluorophosphate (PF6−).



            Cobalt
            redox [Co(II)/Co(III)]11. 
For cobalt bipyridine (bpy) electrolyte with PF6− anion, 0.5 M Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.05 M Co(III)(bpy)3(PF6)3, and 0.2 M lithium perchlorate in a mixture of two solvents (ethylene carbonate and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 6:4) was prepared.
For the cobalt bipyridine (bpy) electrolyte with TFSI anion, we simply replaced the PF6− anion with TFSI [bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide]. For the cobalt 1,10-phenanthroline (o-phen) electrolyte with TFSI anion, 0.5 M Co(II)(o-phen)3(TFSI)2, 0.05 M Co(III)(o-phen)3(TFSI)3, and 0.2 M lithium perchlorate in a mixture of two solvents (ethylene carbonate and acetonitrile in a volume ratio of 6:4) was prepared.

Preparation of the mp-TiO2 film
A TiO2 paste was prepared by mixingTiO2 nanoparticles (anatase, average particle size = 50 nm), ethyl cellulose, and terpineol.8 Colloidal nanoparticles of TiO2 were synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment of an aqueous peroxotitanium complex (PTC) solution.12,8 A TiO2 nanopowder was obtained by centrifuging the nanoparticles in an autoclave at 250 °C for 12 h and subsequent drying in an oven at 100 °C. A dense TiO2 layer of ∼100 nm thickness was deposited on a F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (Pilkington, TEC15) glass substrate using a spray pyrolysis deposition method in order to prevent the recombination between the FTO substrate and the liquid electrolyte. The mp-TiO2 layer was formed by screen-printing on the dense TiO2 blocking layer and subsequent heat-treatment at 500 °C for 60 min in air. It should be noted that the transparent FTO glass substrate had been first cleaned ultrasonically in successive baths of acetone and ethanol and then dried under airflow before use. The thickness of the TiO2 electrodes deposited on the FTO glass substrate was ca. 3 μm, whereas the active area of the TiO2 photoanode was ∼0.18 cm2.
Deposition of Sb2S3 sensitizer on the mp-TiO2 film
A mixture of 3.0 ml of 1 M SbCl3 in acetone and 25 ml of a 1 M Na2S2O3 aqueous solution in a sufficient amount of deionized water was prepared in order to make 100 ml of the final solution. The solution was used to deposit the Sb2S3 sensitizer on the nanoporous TiO2 electrodes by means of chemical bath deposition (CBD).4 More specifically, an amorphous, orange Sb2S3 thin film was deposited on the mp-TiO2 electrodes for 2 h and then washed with deionized water to remove sulfate and chloride residues. Samples of amorphous Sb2S3 were dried at room temperature for several hours and then heat-treated at 330 °C in an argon (Ar) atmosphere for 30 min. The samples of the dark brown crystalline Sb2S3 formed during the heat treatment were taken from the hot plate immediately after the annealing process was complete, and then air-cooled in flowing Ar.
Fabrication of Sb2S3-sensitized SSCs
The Pt-coated counter electrodes were prepared by applying a 5 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in isopropanol to an FTO glass substrate and then heating them to 400 °C for 10 min. The solar cells were assembled by sandwiching the Sb2S3 sensitizer deposited on the mp-TiO2 film with the Pt-coated counter electrodes using a 60 μm thick thermal adhesive film, namely Surlyn® (from DuPont). The electrolyte was injected before the hole was sealed by a Surlyn® film and a cover glass by means of a vacuum back-filling system. In order to improve electrical contact, lead contact pads were made on both sides of the electrodes using an ultrasonic soldering iron.
Device characterization
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the cells were measured under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G illumination provided by the Newport Corporation's Oriel Class A solar simulator 91195A by means of a Keithley 2420 Source Meter® and a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL). The light intensity on the solar cell was controlled using neutral density (ND) filters. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a fully computerized home-designed system comprising a light source (Newport 300 W Xenon lamp 66902) aligned to a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone™ 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). I–V characteristics of the Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were measured using a black mask with an aperture area of 0.10 cm2. All measurements were carried out at least five times and the results averaged.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of dark-brown crystalline Sb2S3 formed on a glass substrate after heat-treatment of amorphous Sb2S3 at 300 °C in Ar atmosphere for 30 min. The patterns confirm the formation of crystalline stibnite because the XRD peaks closely match the characteristic peaks of the stibnite crystal structure (JCPDS 042-1393). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 1(b) shows the formation of crystalline Sb2S3 nanoparticles with a broad size distribution on the mp-TiO2 film.

It should be noted that different solvents were used to attain the highest device efficiency in the solar cells using different redox electrolytes. As listed in Table 1, the conventional redox couples, such as 3I−/I3− (I) and S2−/Sx2− (PS), caused immediate degradation of device performance during I–V measurement. This was particularly true of the PS electrolyte, which dissolved the Sb2S3-sensitizer very quickly, thus resulting in poor device efficiency that was attributable mainly to bare TiO2 without a sensitizer. However, it was still unclear why Sb2S3 was unstable in the sulfur-containing electrolyte and not in the basic electrolyte. Therefore, we checked the stability of a Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell in TMTU/TMFDS2+ redox electrolyte. This electrolyte affected the Sb2S3-sensitizer more gradually. As a result of these preliminary investigations we discarded 3I−/I3−, S2−/Sx2−, and TMTU/TMFDS2+ redox electrolytes, since they were clearly of no use in the fabrication of stable Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells.
In order to confirm the stability of the solar cell devices, we prepared the cells and observed the efficiency change over a month, as shown in Fig. 2(a). For the comparison of long-term stability of devices prepared with different redox electrolytes, an ethylene carbonate/acetonitrile solvent mixture (6:4) was used. We anticipated that this would give a more satisfactory result because acetonitrile used on its own evaporates readily, even from a sealed device. Only the Co(II)(o-phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(o-phen)3(TFSI)3 (CPT) redox electrolyte demonstrated long-term stability.

To elucidate the reason why the stability of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell depends on the redox electrolyte used, we observed the UV-visible spectral change of each electrolyte solution (20 ml) before (–R) and after (–P) reaction with the Sb2S3-sensitizer. For the model experiments, a portion of 34 mg of excess Sb2S3-sensitizer powder was added to 1 mM redox electrolyte in acetonitrile, and the mixture was stirred for 3 days. After filtration of the powders, the UV-visible spectra of the reactant electrolyte solution (–R) and product solution (–P) were compared. The comparison was used to determine whether any decomposition of the electrolyte had occurred, which would lead to unstable performance of the solar cells over time. There was a significant difference between the UV-visible spectra of the reacted ferrocene (Fc–P) and ferrocenium (Fc+–P) solutions and the unreacted Fc–R and Fc+–R solutions, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The UV-visible spectra revealed that the instability of the liquid cell prepared from the Fc/Fc+ redox electrolyte was caused by the decomposition of ferrocene and ferrocenium complexes. In contrast, the UV-visible spectra of unreacted Ni(III)–R and reacted Ni(III)–P solutions were identically indicating that there was no decomposition of the Ni(III) species, as shown in Fig. 2(c). On the other hand, the UV-visible spectrum of reacted Ni(IV)–P solution was significantly different from that of the unreacted Ni(IV)–R solution. It is usual to observe the reduction of the oxidized species [Ni(IV)–R] after the reaction with excess Sb2S3 if the complex is stable. However, the UV-visible spectrum of Ni(IV)–P does not exactly match that of Ni(III)–R. The subtle absorbance increase of Ni(IV)–P around 400 nm might be attributable to the slight decomposition of the Ni(IV) bis(dicarbollide) complex. Interestingly, we did not observe any spectral difference between Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2–R and Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2–P, as shown in Fig. 2(d). This suggests that Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2 is stable with respect to Sb2S3. The spectrum of Co(III)(phen)3(TFSI)3–R became very similar to that of Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2–R after reaction with Sb2S3 [i.e., Co(III)(phen)3(TFSI)3–P], which indicates that most of the Co(III) complex was reduced to Co(II) complex by the Sb2S3 sensitizer. These spectra imply that the Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(phen)3(TFSI)3 redox electrolyte works stably in the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell without reacting with Sb2S3. In contrast, the UV-visible spectra of Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2–R and Co(III)(bpy)3(PF6)3–R reveal that both complexes are decomposed during the reaction with Sb2S3, as shown in Fig. 2(e). The increased absorbance around 400 nm in both Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2–P and Co(III)(bpy)3(PF6)3–P following reaction implies that the bipyridine ligand in the complexes interacts with Sb(III) from the Sb2S3 sensitizer. The strong absorbance of these complexes around 400 nm can be attributed to metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) owing to the complex formation between Sb(III) and bipyridine, which causes unstable cell performance.13,14 In order to determine the suitability of PF6− as a stable counter anion, TFSI was substituted for PF6− in the Co(bpy)3 complexes, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The well-matched UV-visible spectra between Co(III)(bpy)3(TFSI)3–P and Co(II)(bpy)3(TFSI)2–R indicate that Co(III)(bpy)3(TFSI)3 was reduced to Co(II)(bpy)3(TFSI)2 after reaction with Sb2S3. However, the UV-visible spectrum of Co(II)(bpy)3(TFSI)2–P shifted upward slightly at around 350 nm after the reaction. Since no absorption change was observed around the visible range, Sb(III) does not seem to bind to bipyridine released from the Co complex. Therefore, we consider that the change in spectrum around 350 nm resulted from the decomposition of the cobalt complex in the presence of Sb2S3. Based on the UV-visible spectra from Co(bpy)3 complexes in Fig. 2(e) and (f), we can say that PF6− may play a critical role in the detachment of Sb(III) from Sb2S3 powders to induce binding between Sb(III) and bipyridine. Without the PF6− anion, the Co(II)(bpy)3(TFSI)2 complex became slightly unstable in the presence of the Sb2S3 sensitizer, unlike the Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2 complex that was stable in the presence of Sb2S3, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The stability difference of the two complexes can be explained by molecular orbital theory (MOT).
The strong field d7Co(II) complex is not supposed to exist without electron acceptor ligands, such as phenanthroline (phen) or bipyridine (bpy), which have mostly conjugated double bonds. The ligands can accept an electron in the eg orbital of the central metal through electron back-donation; this stabilizes the complex. Therefore, it is possible that phen, which has 7 double bonds, has a greater stabilizing effect on the complex than bpy, which has only 6 double bonds.
From the long-term stability test and UV-visible spectral analyses, we believe that it is possible to fabricate stable Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells by choosing a suitable electrolyte such as Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(phen)3(TFSI)3 redox electrolyte. Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of a Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cell with Co(II)(phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(phen)3(TFSI)3 electrolyte subjected to sun intensity illumination, and its external quantum efficiency. The degradation of power conversion efficiency with increased illumination intensity might be attributed to the degraded fill factor owing to recombination at mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/cobalt electrolyte owing to the difference in the natures of the cobalt redox electrolyte and conventional iodide redox electrolyte.11 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the Sb2S3-sensitized solar cell in Fig. 3(b) indicates that the Sb2S3 sensitizer would work efficiently in transforming the whole spectrum of visible light into electricity.

Conclusions
We systematically compared the stabilities of Sb2S3-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells having different redox electrolytes such as 3I−/I3−, S2−/Sx2−, TMTU/TMFDS2+ Fc/Fc+, Ni(III)bis(dicarbollide)/Ni(IV)bis(dicarbollide)PF6, Co(II)(bpy)3(PF6)2/Co(III)(bpy)3(PF6)3, Co(II)(bpy)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(bpy)3(TFSI)3, and Co(II)(o-phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(o-phen)3(TFSI)3 to find a redox electrolyte that was stable with respect to a Sb2S3 sensitizer. The long-term stability test of Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells and UV-visible spectral analysis of each redox electrolyte before and after reaction with the Sb2S3 sensitizer in various electrolytes revealed that a Co(II)(o-phen)3(TFSI)2/Co(III)(o-phen)3(TFSI)3 redox electrolyte can be used to fabricate stable cells. Although the current device efficiency of Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells using cobalt redox electrolyte is still lower than that of solid type or other inorganic semiconductor-sensitized solar cells, we believe that it could be further improved through proper interface engineering.
