    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 29th June 2021AbstractWe present the fabrication of electron-rich Pt3M alloy-tailored carbon electrodes to maximize hole extraction. Through optimizing the doses and alloy species systematically, the best all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.08% and showed excellent long-term stability at 80% RH over 20 days.
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention in the last decade thanks to boosting of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.5%.1–6 However, their stability under persistent attacks by moisture, heat and/or light is far from the commercial requirement owing to the volatilization or decomposition of organic species (e.g., MA+ and FA+). One of the promising strategies to this impasse is to make all-inorganic CsPbIxBr3−x (x = 0, 1, 2 or 3) PSCs by replacing organic species with inorganic cesium ions (Cs+).7,8 Iodide-containing inorganic halide perovskites have more suitable bandgaps and, therefore, broad spectral absorption range, but the spontaneous conversion from a desirable cubic phase into a yellow phase causes poor moisture resistance. Therefore, the air-stable full-bromine cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite having superior moisture- and thermal-tolerance even in harsh atmospheres is regarded as an “ideal” photosensitizer to balance stability and efficiency.9–11 In addition, use of hole-transporting layers (HTLs), such as state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) or poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), increases the manufacturing cost and simultaneously introduces new disadvantages (hygroscopic additives, or light/thermal instability) and subsequently damages the stability and PCE.12–14 Moreover, the high cost of precious metal electrodes such as Au or Ag also increases the cost and prevents PSC commercialization.15 Carbon electrodes have been applied widely in PSCs because of their chemical inertness, low manufacturing costs, low environmental impact and compatibility with up-scalable techniques. Therefore, carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs free of HTLs show advantages for accelerating their commercial application arising from the excellent stability as well as the low cost, hole-extraction ability and hydrophobicity of the carbon electrode.11,16
One way to make all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs is to improve their PCE without sacrificing stability. The much lower PCE of state-of-the-art carbon-based HTL-free CsPbBr3 PSCs than that of hybrid PSCs is due to two reasons. First, the intrinsic wide energy bandgap (2.3 eV) of a CsPbBr3 light-harvester results in a narrow spectral response range, but the introduction of iodide to broaden the light-absorption range satisfices environmental stability. Second, the inefficient hole-extraction ability of the carbon electrode, accompanied with the large mismatch in energy level (0.6 eV) between the valence band (VB: −5.6 eV) of CsPbBr3 and work function (WF: −5.0 eV) of the carbon electrode leads to a serious charge recombination and non-negligible energy loss. Reducing charge recombination is an effective way to improve PCE without sacrificing the stability of CsPbBr3 PSC.
Optimal alignment of energy levels between the carbon electrode and CsPbBr3 layer can enhance hole extraction and inhibit charge recombination. An intermediate energy level, such as that inorganic compounds (MnS),17 organic polymers (PEDOT, PPy, PANi)18 and quantum dots (QDs; CuInS2/ZnS QDs,19 CsSnBr3−xIx QDs,20 CdZnSe@ZnSe QDs21), has been introduced to improve alignment of energy levels and to promote hole extraction. However, addition of an intermediate level layer results in higher cost and more complex production processes. Reducing the WF of the carbon electrode is a more forthright and concise method to optimize alignment of the energy level and to minimize charge recombination.
In this work, metallic Pt and alloyed Pt3M (Fe, Co, Ni) were made to modify the carbon electrode for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. Preliminary results demonstrated that the Pt and Pt3M alloys optimized the WF and enhanced the conductivity of the carbon electrode, and reduced the mismatch in the energy level at the CsPbBr3/carbon interface and charge recombination. Through systematic tuning of the amount and species of the dopant, the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC tailored by Pt3Co alloy achieved the best PCE of 9.08% in comparison with 6.27% for the pristine device, which is a high level compared with state-of-the-art HTL-free CsPbBr3 PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device also presented excellent long-term stability even upon exposure to a high level of moisture.
Carbon is thought to be one of the most promising electrode materials. Carbon materials are inexpensive, stable, inert to ion migration originating from perovskite and metal electrodes, inherently water-resistant and, therefore, advantageous for high device stability.22 However, their PCEs lag behind those of traditionally processed cells with metal electrodes, which leads to a considerable efficiency gap. Electron-rich Pt3M alloys with a high WF and excellent conductivity can be incorporated into a carbon electrode to optimize the WF and to: (i) enhance the conductivity of the carbon electrode; (ii) diminish the energy difference; (iii) reduce the charge carrier recombination. Pt and Pt3M alloys prepared by a simple hydrothermal method showed spherical morphologies (Fig. 1a–d). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was undertaken to investigate the impact of metallic Pt and Pt3M alloys on the WF of the carbon electrode (Fig. 1e–h). The WF of Pt-, Pt3Fe-, Pt3Co- and Pt3Ni-modified carbon electrodes (denoted as Pt–carbon, Pt3Fe–carbon, Pt3Co–carbon and Pt3Ni–carbon, respectively) was determined to be 5.32 eV (21.2 − 15.88 = 5.32 eV), 5.22 eV (21.2 − 15.98 = 5.22 eV), 5.30 eV (21.2 − 15.90 = 5.30 eV) and 5.23 eV (21.2 − 15.97 = 5.23 eV), respectively. The increased WF for the modified carbon electrode was due to the introduction of Pt (5.65 eV) element with its high WF. The reduced energy difference at CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces promoted hole extraction and reduced the charge carrier recombination. In addition, Pt (2.28) is more electronegative than Fe (1.83), Co (1.88), and Ni (1.91). After alloying with Fe, Co, and Ni, the atomic Pt nucleus attracts electrons from transition-metal atoms to form electron-rich active sites, which leads to an increased electron density at the carbon electrode.23 Consequently, positively charged holes are easier to extract from the valence band of CsPbBr3 for separation of charge carriers. In addition, Pt and Pt3M alloys can improve the conductivity of the carbon electrode significantly (Fig. 1i and j). Given the influence of Pt and Pt3M alloys on the WF and conductivity of the carbon electrode, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs can be further affected.

We assembled solar cells with a structure of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon to explore the influence of Pt and Pt3M alloys on photovoltaic performances. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs at different Pt doses, and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The pristine device showed a PCE of 6.27%, and the best PCE of 7.62% was achieved at a Pt dose of 2.5 wt%. The potential mechanism behind this phenomenon is the reduced difference in energy level at CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces and improved charge separation by introduction of a high-WF Pt to increase the WF of the carbon electrode. However, a much higher Pt dose, such as 3.5 wt%, lowered the PCE to 7.42% because of poor contact between perovskite and carbon layers.
To enhance the hole-extraction ability further, Pt was alloyed with Fe, Co and Ni to prepare Pt3Fe, Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys, respectively, which were then incorporated into the carbon electrode at a proportion of 2.5 wt%. The photovoltaic data of all the devices were enhanced significantly (Fig. 2a). When the carbon electrode was modified with 2.5 wt% Pt3Co, the PCE became 9.08%, which was increased by 44.8% in comparison with the PCE of the pristine device (Table S2, ESI†) and at a high level compared with that of state-of-the-art inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs (Table S3, ESI†). The Pt3M alloys-induced electron-rich active sites made it easier to extract holes from the valence band of CsPbBr3 to cause an enhanced hole-extraction ability and inhibition of carrier recombination. In addition, the energy loss (Eloss) of the device would be reduced owing to the diminished difference in the energy level at the modified carbon electrode/CsPbBr3 interfaces. Then, Voc increased significantly (Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the bandgap of perovskite and e is the charge of an electron). To verify the reliability of the enhanced photovoltaic performance, the corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and steady-state power outputs of different devices were measured. The integrated current densities and steady-state efficiencies were consistent with the results of J–V curves, which confirmed the accuracy of PCE values (Fig. 2b and c). We concluded that employing Pt and Pt3M alloys to modify the carbon electrode could improve the performance of CsPbBr3 PSCs.

To further reveal the charge recombination kinetics in individual CsPbBr3 PSCs, we characterized the relationships of Voc and Jsc as the function of incident light intensity (I). The dependence of Jsc on I could be characterized according to the following formula: Jsc ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1), where α is a fitting factor associated with bimolecular recombination.24 An α value closer to 1 indicates more efficient charge extraction and less bimolecular recombination in PSCs. Here, the α value increased from 0.970 for a pristine PSC to 0.984 for Pt-PSC, 0.990 for Pt3Fe-PSC, 0.996 for Pt3Ni-PSC and 0.998 for Pt3Co-PSC. These data demonstrated enhanced charge extraction and reduced bimolecular recombination owing to the enhanced hole-extraction capability and better alignment of the energy level (Fig. 3a). According to Voc = nkTln(I)/q + constant from the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination mechanism (where k, T and q represent the Boltzmann constant, the absolute temperature, the elementary charge, respectively, and n is an ideal factor related to monomolecular recombination),24 the slope was 1.995kT/q for pristine PSC, and it decreased to 1.941kT/q for Pt-PSC, 1.758kT/q for Pt3Fe-PSC, 1.747kT/q for Pt3Ni-PSC, and 1.636kT/q for Pt3Co-PSC, respectively (Fig. 3b). The low slopes refer to decreased trap-dominated non-radiative recombination by applying Pt3M alloys in the carbon electrode. Characterizations on Jsc and Voc revealed that use of Pt and Pt3M alloys helped suppress charge recombination because of the accelerated charge extraction and reduced trap density.

V
oc decay curves of various CsPbBr3 PSCs were recorded to evaluate the charge recombination rate (Fig. 3c). The lowest decay time for Pt3Co-PSC demonstrated the lowest charge-recombination rate and longest charge lifetime for an enhanced Voc output, which was in accordance with the J–V curves. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization at Voc was undertaken in the dark to study the influence of Pt3M alloys-modified carbon electrodes on charge transfer, where Rs represents the series resistance of the whole device (which corresponds to the intercept on the real axis) and Rrec represents the charge-recombination resistance (which corresponds to the semicircle).25 As shown in Fig. 3d, the Rs for Pt and Pt3M alloys-based PSCs was smaller than that of the pristine PSC, which was also in favor of FF improvement. In addition, the maximal Rrec in Pt3Co-PSC suggested that Pt3Co–carbon suppressed charge recombination effectively due to the optimized alignment of energy level and enhanced charge extraction in the device. In comparison with the pristine device (Fig. 3e), the obviously lower leakage of the current densities in the dark condition of CsPbBr3 PSCs based on Pt and Pt3M alloys-modified carbon electrodes revealed the reduction of current leakage path and suppression of charge recombination.
Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were undertaken to further explore the charge transfer of various CsPbBr3 PSCs. PL spectra were characterized to evaluate the hole-extraction ability (Fig. 3f). The PL spectra of perovskite films deposited with different carbon electrodes demonstrated sharp peaks for CsPbBr3 centered at ∼530 nm, and the PL intensity of CsPbBr3/Pt, CsPbBr3/Pt3Fe, CsPbBr3/Pt3Ni and CsPbBr3/Pt3Co was quenched by 68.3%, 74.9%, 86.9% and 92.5%, respectively, due to their gradually enhanced hole-extraction ability. In addition, TRPL decay curves were employed to determine the PL decay lifetimes (Fig. 3g), which showed obvious bi-exponential decay behavior. Therefore, they were fitted by the double-exponential decay function , where τ1 is the faster component of trap-mediated nonradiative recombination and τ2 is the slower component correlated to radiative recombination.26 Notably, the shorter carrier lifetime (smaller τ2 value) of 0.744 ns for CsPbBr3/Pt–carbon, 0.725 ns for CsPbBr3/Pt3Fe–carbon, 0.503 ns for CsPbBr3/Pt3Ni–carbon and 0.428 ns for CsPbBr3/Pt3Co–carbon, in comparison with 1.414 ns for CsPbBr3/carbon, suggested improved charge-transfer kinetics. The reduced τ2 mainly arose from optimized alignment of energy level and increased charge-extraction ability. These characterizations confirmed the markedly reduced charge recombination upon addition of Pt and Pt3M alloys in the carbon electrode (Fig. 4).

The long-term stability of perovskite halides in humidity and/or air conditions is a great challenge for their commercialization. Thus, we examined the long-term stability of the best device. The unencapsulated device showed excellent long-term stability with PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF maintained >91% of the initial values after exposure to 80% relative humidity at 25 °C over 20 days. This utrahigh stability was closely related to the stable crystallographic structure of CsPbBr3 perovskite and hydrophobic surface of the carbon electrode. This result demonstrated a superior operational stability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs, and that Pt3M alloys-modified carbon electrodes could have a promoting effect on the performance of solar cells.
In summary, metallic Pt and alloyed Pt3M nanostructures with high WFs were developed to modify carbon electrodes for high-performance all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. These results demonstrated that Pt or Pt3M optimized the WF of the carbon electrode for a reduced difference in energy level and charge recombination at CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces. Through tuning the Pt3M dose and species, a 2.5 wt% Pt3Co alloy-tailored all-inorganic CsPbBr3 solar cell achieved a PCE of 9.08%, in comparison with 6.27% for the pristine device. Moreover, the unencapsulated device showed excellent long-term stability with the PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF maintaining >91% of the initial values after exposure to 80% relative humidity at 25 °C over 20 days.
