    , Accepted 1st August 2018First published on 30th August 2018AbstractWith increasing demand for energy storage, obtaining aqueous electrolytes that are incombustible, low cost, and conveniently assembled in air with high ionic conductivity has become a dominant focus. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets in a controllable way for 2.0 V aqueous electrolyte-based electrochemical capacitors that involve activated carbon. From electrochemical performance tests, the electrode results in a large increase in the performance of an asymmetric supercapacitor, which involves activated carbon, in an operating voltage window from 0 V to 2.0 V in aqueous electrolyte, with a high specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, and cycling stability for 6000 cycles with only a 5% drop in the initial capacitance. The superior performance during the charging–discharging process is attributed to the existence of a film, which can prevent electronic conduction while allowing ionic conduction.
1. Introduction
As a source of life, water always has the advantages of environmental friendliness and recyclability, especially in aqueous electrolyte-based electrochemical capacitors (ECs).1–3 For ECs, commonly used electrolytes include aqueous solutions, organic solutions and solid electrolytes. Recently, aqueous electrolytes have become more dominant due to their low cost, incombustibility, environmental-friendliness, convenient assembly in air and high ionic conductivity.4 Aqueous electrolytes show enhanced contact with the micropores of electrodes.5,6 In addition, higher ionic conductivity can allow aqueous-based ECs to achieve higher power density than non-aqueous electrolyte-based ECs.7 However, the temperature range from the freezing point to the boiling point is narrow, which limits the development of these ECs at very low or high temperatures. As we know, the decomposition voltage of water is only 1.23 V.8,9 So widening the stable potential window of aqueous electrolytes has become an urgent research focus.
To solve the limitations of the narrow electrochemical stability potential window, it is necessary to find appropriate strategies. So far, many methods have been developed, such as adjusting the pH of the electrolyte, adding redox-active additives, using water-in-salt electrolyte, and so on.10 According to Luo et al., one common practice is to eliminate O2 and adjust the pH value of the electrolyte.11 Meanwhile, another work reported the use of a room temperature Li salt hydrate melt as the aqueous electrolyte, which could realize a high voltage (∼2.3–3.1 V) in aqueous Li-ion batteries.9 What's more, according to an excellent study, researchers reported a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte, namely a “water-in-salt” electrolyte, which enabled a full Li-ion battery to operate at 2.3 V for more than 1000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% at both 0.15C and 4.5C.12 These excellent studies provide more opportunities to improve the potential window, especially for pseudocapacitive storage applications.
In addition to widening the electrochemical stability potential window, the selection of electrode materials is also essential, since using appropriate capacitance materials can improve the energy density.13–15 In recent years, the incorporation of nanomaterials and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) has become attractive.16 These new types of materials exhibit novel chemical and physical properties, such as crystalline structures and large internal surface areas from MOFs as well as surface, size and microscopic quantum tunneling effects from nanomaterials.17,18 To date, there have been some excellent examples in this research field. Yan et al. reported work involving the fabrication of Fe2O3-NP@MOF composites, in which they concluded that the as-obtained composites enabled the integration of the characteristics of both materials.19 In 2014, Vinogradov et al. synthesized a MIL-125@TiO2 composite and found that, when applied in solar cells, it demonstrated a 6.4% power conversion efficiency (PCE).20 Similarly, to achieve high energy density in supercapacitors, combining MOFs and nanomaterials to form hybrid nanocomposites could be a successful strategy.21
MnO2, a promising pseudocapacitive material with the advantages of environmental-friendliness and low cost, can be used in neutral aqueous electrolytes in electrochemical supercapacitors.22–25 Very recently, Liu's team and Xia's team created high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors established from Mn-based materials.26,27 Liu's team reported a 2.4 V hydrogel supercapacitor that used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–LiCl as the electrolyte. This device demonstrated superior coulombic efficiency and excellent rate capability, as well as remarkable cycle life (>5000 cycles; 95.5% capacity retention). According to Xia, they firstly synthesized a 2.6 V aqueous Na0.5MnO2//Fe3O4@C asymmetric supercapacitor that has an energy density reaching 81 W h kg−1. Such a high voltage is comparable even to those of organic electrolyte supercapacitor systems.
Herein, we report a high-voltage (2.0 V) supercapacitor, with ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets as the electrode material, in neutral environments. Meanwhile, during charging and discharging in aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte with a stable potential window from 0 V to 2.0 V in a two-electrode system that involves activated carbon, a film formed, suppressing the electrolysis of water. The corresponding electrochemical tests demonstrated that the as-prepared ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheet electrode exhibited high capacitance (340 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and excellent cycle performance (approximately 95% capacitance retention over 6000 cycles).
2. Experimental section
Material preparation

Ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets. 
A synthesized potassium permanganate solution (0.002 M, 150 mL) was mixed with ethyl acetate (99.8%, 40 mL) uniformly in a boiling flask. Then, the solution was stirred magnetically under condensation reflux at a temperature of 85 °C. This process was continued until a large quantity of brown particles formed, revealing the end of the reaction. Eventually, the δ-MnO2 material was obtained after washing with deionized water and ethanol several times. Later, to obtain a 10 g L−1 δ-MnO2 standard suspension, 15 mL of ethanol was added into a centrifugal tube containing all of the prepared δ-MnO2 material.


Ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets. 
First 1.0 mL of the standard δ-MnO2 suspension and 30 mL of ethanol were placed in a beaker under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After dropping in 3.0 mL of Cu(NO3)2 solution (0.1 M), the solution was ultrasonicated (10 minutes) to mix it well. In addition, 2 mL of sodium trimesate solution (0.1 M) was added dropwise. The stirring process lasted for one hour, and Cu-MOF successfully grew on the sheet of δ-MnO2. After alternately washing with deionized water and ethanol at least three times, Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 material was eventually obtained.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the formation of ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets consisting of interconnected nanoparticles and ultrathin nanosheets. We used a simple reaction to control the ideal morphology of the composite. XRD patterns of pure ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets, pure Cu-MOF ([Cu3(btc)2], (btc3− = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate)) nanoparticles and ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. S1.† Broad peaks from δ-MnO2 at 2θ = 12.2, 24.8 and 37.0° in the pattern correspond to the theoretical data (JCPDS no. 18-0802). All the XRD peaks of Cu-MOF correspond to pure [Cu3(btc)2], which is the same as the results reported by Liu et al.28 The “#” marks on the composite spectrum denote the obvious diffraction peaks from Cu-MOF, and the general spectral trends of manganese dioxide can also be seen in the XRD pattern of the composite material, which indicates that ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets were successfully fabricated. The Fourier transform infrared spectra of the three samples in Fig. S2† further prove the formation of a composite of the two components, due to the existence of characteristic peaks from both ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets and [Cu3(btc)2] particles.

Fig. S3† exhibits nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the three samples. For the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets, the surface area is 1055.2 m2 g−1, which is obviously larger than for the ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets (203.5 m2 g−1) and Cu-MOF nanoparticles (1041.1 m2 g−1). The δ-MnO2 nanosheets are ultrathin with many wrinkles; the growth of Cu-MOF expands the wrinkles of the nanosheets. As a result, the difference can be attributed to synergistic effects between δ-MnO2 with a high specific surface area and the porous Cu-MOF nanoparticles. Fig. S3a† shows that the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets present a type-IV isotherm with an H4-type hysteresis loop, indicating that the product has slit-shaped cells with uniform shapes and sizes. As seen from Fig. S3b and S3c,† the pore size peaks are located predominantly at approximately 0.42 nm and 20 nm for the nanocomposites. It is obvious that the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets possess a hierarchical porous structure with both micropores and mesopores.
Analytical results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the complete survey spectrum of the as-prepared ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets. Binding energies for Cu (2p), Mn (2p), O (1s), and C (1s) are shown for the composite. Also from Fig. 2, there are copper signals (Cu 2p1/2 at 955.5 eV and Cu 2p3/2 at 934.8 eV), manganese signals (Mn 2p1/2 at 653.9 eV and Mn 2p3/2 at 642.1 eV), an oxygen signal (O 1s at 532.0 eV), and a carbon signal (C 1s at 284.8 eV). As shown in Fig. 2b, the O 1s spectrum consists of three main constituent peaks, namely Mn–O–Mn bonds (529.7 eV), Mn–O–H bonds of hydroxides (531.5 eV) and H–O–H bonds of water (532.4 eV). Fig. 2c depicts two intense bands with binding energies of 653.9 eV and 642.1 eV that are respectively assigned to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2, with an energy separation of 11.8 eV, corresponding to the theoretical values for δ-MnO2, suggesting the presence of tetravalent Mn ions. The Cu 2p core level spectrum in Fig. 2d consists of two bands, Cu 2p1/2 at 955.5 eV and Cu 2p3/2 at 934.8 eV, which is in agreement with results from the Cu-MOF composition. Fig. S4† compares XPS spectra of Cu-MOF, δ-MnO2 and ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets. In Fig. S4b,† we can observe that the intensity of the peak at ∼655 eV decreased significantly upon forming the composite. This may be caused by cover provided by Cu-MOF. As we know, the penetration depth of X-rays is only 2–3 nm, but the size of Cu-MOF that grew on the δ-MnO2 nanosheets is approximately 20–30 nm, so X-rays may not completely reach the surfaces of the δ-MnO2 nanosheets. However, it is still obvious that the XPS characteristic peaks of the composite are consistent with those of the constituent parts, verifying the successful combination of the two materials.

The images in Fig. 3 are from as-prepared δ-MnO2 nanosheets and ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets acquired via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a and b are SEM and TEM images of ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets, respectively. It can be seen that δ-MnO2 is formed of ultrathin and partially transparent soft nanosheets with many wrinkles, showing a morphology resembling rippled silk. The thickness of the nanosheets is measured to be approximately 3–4 nm. Fig. 3c–f are SEM and TEM images of ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets at different magnifications. Additionally, from Fig. 3e and f, the δ-MnO2 nanosheets still maintain a pleated structure and the Cu-MOF nanoparticles are uniformly and evenly grown on the nanosheets; furthermore, the wrinkles provide many nanospaces for the growth of Cu-MOF nanoparticles.

For further study of the electrochemical properties of as-prepared (ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets, ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets, and Cu-MOF nanoparticles) electrodes, we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (CP) tests with a three-electrode system in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution using a saturated calomel electrode. Fig. 4a exhibits the CV curves from ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheet (with a weight of 1.0 mg) electrodes at scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 in a potential window of 0–1.05 V. The shape of the CV curves indicates that the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets have good capacity, demonstrating faradaic pseudocapacitive properties. At the same time, the potential and the current density in Fig. 4a show that the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets have large capacitance. In addition, we compared the three samples, as seen in Fig. S5.† The approximate rectangular shape of the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheet curves is more regular than for the other two samples. It is clear that the capacitance of the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets is larger than it is for the other samples. Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves (Fig. 4b) exhibit an electrochemical window of 0–1.05 V at different current densities. The triangular-like plots show the linear characteristics of platform-free charging–discharging curves, indicating a reversible redox process and the excellent electrochemical capabilities of the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets. The specific capacitance values at different current densities for the three samples were calculated, and they are shown in Fig. 4c. As the areas are normal, capacitance values can be calculated via the following equation:  where i is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, m is the electrode mass and ΔV is the potential window. Because of poor electrical conductivity, Cu-MOF nanoparticles (with a weight of 1.0 mg) demonstrate almost no electrochemical capacity performance, and their capacitance is nearly 0 F g−1. Interestingly, the specific capacitance of the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets is much higher than that of the ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets (with a weight of 1.0 mg). For instance, at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, the capacitance of the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets is 667 F g−1, which is more than twice that of the ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets (307 F g−1). Fig. 4d shows the cycling performance of the three samples at 4.0 A g−1. With an increase in the cycle number, the capacitance remained stable, further confirming the good rate stability of the electrode material. Combined with the above results, the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets show superior electrochemical performance compared to the single components.

To study the effects of the activated carbon electrode, we carried out a series of tests, such as SEM and XRD analysis, and three-electrode electrochemical tests, as shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† It is seen that the activated carbon electrode has good specific capacitance and good cyclability, which demonstrates that the AC electrode is a good candidate for use in asymmetric supercapacitors.
An optimal ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheet//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor (Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC) was also fabricated for further electrochemical performance studies. Fig. S8† shows CV curves from the ASC under different potentials varying from 1.20–2.50 V (Fig. S8a†) and 1.20–3.0 V (Fig. S8b†) at 5 mV s−1. Upon increasing the applied voltage, the shape of the CV curves changed, illustrating that the ASC device can be stable up to a high voltage of 2.0 V. Over a potential range from 0–1.2 V, the presence of weak redox peaks indicates that the pseudocapacitive properties are derived from the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheet electrode. When combined with Fig. S8b,† we find that when the operating potential was increased to 2.0 V, the largest integrated area from the corresponding CV curve appears. At 2.0 V, most faradaic reactions occurred. Meanwhile, the capacitance value increased along with increasing the voltage window. As a result, we selected an operating voltage window of 0 to 2 V for further electrochemical studies of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC.

Fig. 5a illustrates the CV behavior of the ASC in neutral 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution. The CV shapes at different scan rates indicate that the charge stored in the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC is dominated by a pseudocapacitance mechanism. The Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 and AC materials both have a weight of 1.0 mg. Meanwhile, the device exhibits a large capacitance, which can be obtained from the potential and current density. We also compared the CV curves of the three samples in Fig. S9a,† which are the same as those from the three-electrode system. The specific shape of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 curve indicates that it has a larger capacitance than the others do. Fig. 5b shows CP curves from the device at different current densities from 1 A g−1 to 20 A g−1 with a wide operating voltage window (0–2.0 V). The shapes of the CP curves are linear and platform free, indicating that the electrode underwent a reversible redox process and exhibits excellent electrochemical capabilities. According to the CP curves from three ASC devices, we calculated the specific capacitance values at current densities of 1–20 A g−1 (Fig. 5c). The specific capacitance values of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 A g−1 were 340, 297, 264, 234, 210 and 152 F g−1, respectively, and these values are nearly 1.5 times those of the δ-MnO2//AC ASC. The Cu-MOF//AC ASC still showed no electrochemical performance. We also studied the cycling performances of the three devices at a current density of 4 A g−1 (Fig. 5d). After 6000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC remained stable, only exhibiting a 5% drop in the initial capacitance, showing the good cycling performance of the as-prepared Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC.

Interestingly, while performing galvanostatic charge–discharge tests in the operating voltage window of 0 V to 2.0 V, there were no bubbles generated on the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2//AC ASC, illustrating that there was no water electrolysis during the whole testing process. To study the mechanism during the working process, we collected two activated material samples from a cycled composite electrode. One underwent half of the test, and the other underwent the entire test. SEM images of the two samples are shown in Fig. S10.† We can see that a film exists between the electrode surface and the electrolyte, indicated by the white arrow. Fig. S10d–f† shows microscopic images of the activated material that underwent the entire test. It is obvious that as the test progressed, a film, which may act as a protective interphase, gradually formed. As we didn't find electrolysis of water, if this “magic” film allowed electronic conduction only, or both electronic conduction and ionic conduction, there must be electrolysis of water during the electrochemical working process. So combined with the electrochemical properties of the ASC, we infer that this protective interphase can inhibit electronic conduction but allow ionic conduction. Meanwhile, we collected another two activated material samples from a cycled activated carbon electrode during the working process (0.5 cycles) and after the working process (1.0 cycle). SEM images are shown in Fig. S11.† We can find that, in contrast to the activated cycled composite electrode, there is basically no difference between the activated material from the activated carbon electrode before and after the working process. It's obvious that the “magic” film only emerged on the cycled composite electrode and we carried out further studies in the following work.

Fig. 6 shows HRTEM images of activated material that was subjected to the whole test. The images clearly reveal the film in Fig. 6a–c. The SAED image in Fig. 6e indicates that this film is amorphous. The series of images on the right shows the mapping of the elements C, O, Cu and Mn, which are from a selected area (Fig. 6f). These elements are evenly and homogeneously distributed over the whole area without apparent element aggregation or segregation. However, when we prepared the electrode, we added Teflon powder, which also has film-like morphology. A control experiment was made in the absence of Teflon powder during the preparation of the electrode. We collected activated material under the same conditions, and SEM characterization was carried out (Fig. S12†). It is clear that a film still existed, and the area became larger as the test proceeded. All of the above is possible evidence explaining the wide operating voltage window (0–2.0 V) of the Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 electrode without the electrolysis of water.

Furthermore, we carried out another XRD test on the collected activated material powder and compared it with the XRD patterns of the as-prepared ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. S13.† Clearly, as the electrochemical test proceeds, the characteristic diffraction peaks from Cu-MOF disappear; we can't exactly provide a formation mechanism between Cu-MOF and the “magic” film, but we infer that Cu-MOF played an important role in the generation of the film.
For further study of the mechanism, we collected samples for XPS characterization after 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 25 cycles. As exhibited in Fig. S14a,† the electrode material was stable during the charging-discharging process, and sodium ions were transported into the electrode material. The charge storage mechanism of manganese oxide can be described via the following reactions: MnO2 + Na+ + e− ↔ MnOONa(1) (MnO2)surface + Na+ + e− ↔ (MnO2Na)surface(2)
δ-MnO2 nanosheets with a layered spacing of 0.71 nm may exhibit better intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ into and out of the activated material, and offer promising properties for enhancing capacitance. Firstly, the emerged film acts as a protection layer. At the same time, a high Na content, cooperating with the hierarchical nanosheets, increases the amount of Mn3+, which could directly raise the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple concentration to improve the pseudocapacitance of the ASC.
To further verify the electrochemical performance, comparisons with previously reported MnO2-based materials from other supercapacitors are provided in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Obviously, the materials in this work show improvements (specific capacitance and maximum energy density) over most of those materials. The ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets benefit from synergistic effects between the δ-MnO2 nanosheets and Cu-MOF nanoparticles to exhibit enhanced capacitance behavior. We can easily find that the δ-MnO2 nanosheets have good electrochemical performance, and the folds of the δ-MnO2 nanosheets can provide sufficient interfacial area to facilitate charge transport during the charging-discharging process. At the same time, the existing porous Cu-MOF nanoparticles can not only offer a porous structure to provide more diffusion paths for ions but can also strengthen the folds to increase the active surfaces of δ-MnO2 for the absorption and desorption of electrolyte ions. Other ions or molecules can easily insert into the interlamination spaces of δ-MnO2, leading to good ion exchange capacity.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets have been successfully prepared in a controllable way. The as-prepared nanoparticle/nanosheet composite combines the advantages of the porous character of Cu-MOF together with the functional characteristics of ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheets. We investigated its electrochemical performance through a traditional three-electrode system and asymmetrical supercapacitor device. The test results indicate that the ultrathin Cu-MOF@δ-MnO2 nanosheets can be successfully applied in supercapacitors. The MOF@metal oxide composite is a promising material for electrochemical energy storage devices with aqueous electrolytes. When charging–discharging tests were performed, the as-assembled device, which involves activated carbon, showed a wide operating voltage window from 0 V to 2.0 V in aqueous electrolyte, which shows potential for applications in high-energy density supercapacitors. The present work opens an avenue to use MOF@metal oxide composites as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.
