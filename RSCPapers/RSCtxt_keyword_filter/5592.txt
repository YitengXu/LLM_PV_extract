    , Accepted 21st August 2018First published on 1st September 2018AbstractImprovement of power conversion efficiency has always been a major issue in organic–inorganic halide perovskites. Highly efficient carrier separation and optical absorption are strongly required. In this work, we report on the significant improvement of electronic and optical absorption properties in a CH3NH3PbI3 thin-film by intercalating Sr–Cl-layers. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that intercalating Sr–Cl-layers into the film can give rise to complete elimination of surface states and a great enhancement of spontaneous polarization, while the band-gap is rather small. And both the number and insertion position of Sr–Cl-layers have significant influences on the electronic structure of the film; accordingly, we give a phase diagram for designing such a Sr–Cl-layer-inserted CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. Further investigations show that the Sr–Cl-layer can also greatly improve the optical absorption in the sunlight range. Calculations of the thermodynamic stability show the feasibility of synthesis in experiments. This work provides us with an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites (HOIPs) MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+ and X = I, Br, Cl) have drawn much attention because of their outstanding electronic and optoelectronic properties, including an appropriate direct band gap of around 1.7 eV,1,2 low exciton binding energy,3,4 high ambipolar mobilities5–7 and long carrier lifetimes,8,9 for solar cells,10–13 which means that they have huge potential for fabricating high-performance photovoltaic devices. In general, the electronic and optical properties of MAPbX3 depend on their structures, sizes, and morphologies. Plenty of studies have found that HOIPs with reduced dimensionality (e.g., two-dimensional (2D) structures) exhibit many advantages14–19 over their bulk phase, such as longer carrier diffusion lengths, tunability of the layered structure, the construction of flexible photodetectors, and high efficiency of colourful solar cells and so on. Therefore, low-dimensional HOIPs have become ideal candidates for photovoltaics.
To enhance the photovoltaic properties of these low-dimensional HOIP materials, the separation, transport, and collection of photo-generated carriers in MAPbX3 need to be further improved. To date, a large number of experimental studies have been devoted to the development of new methods to eliminate the recombination of electron–hole pairs of 2D MAPbX3 thin films. In order to effectively separate the electrons and holes, the conventional way is to integrate HOIPs with other functional materials to form heterostructures, such as a TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD sandwich structure where TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD layers serve as electron and hole transport layers, respectively. Nevertheless, there are plenty of interfaces in this structure, resulting in unfavorable interfacial defect recombination. Moreover, TiO2 may lead to the decomposition of MAPbI3.20 Direct creation of built-in electric fields in HOIPs is another feasible avenue to drive the separation of photo-generated carriers. However, spontaneous electric polarization in MAPbI3 is too weak to produce a strong built-in electric field for separating electrons and holes. Recently, Strelcov et al.21 experimentally confirmed that there was no ferroelectricity observed in MAPbI3 polycrystalline films and single crystals. To solve this key problem, we propose another strategy to obtain a large built-in electric field by tuning the electronic structures of MAPbI3 thin films. It is well known that the symmetric Pb–I layered structure of MAPbI3 has very weak spontaneous polarization. If an additional atomic layer which could induce strong electric polarization is inserted into MAPbI3, charge in MAPbI3 may be redistributed significantly, and thus a great change in electronic structures may take place, which provides us with a possibility of tuning the spontaneous polarization state. Based on such consideration, a Sr–Cl atomic layer is a good choice due to the following reasons: the Cl element exhibits great electronegativity and has been widely used to form halide perovskite heterojunctions to enhance photon excitation;22 the Sr element has strong metallic character, and the stability of Sr-incorporated 2D perovskite can be significantly improved.23
In this work, we report on significant improvement of carrier separation and optical absorption in a Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MAPbI3 thin film. Based on the first-principles calculations, we predict that a great change in spatial carrier localization takes place when Sr–Cl-layers are inserted, and a large spontaneous polarization/built-in electric field is thus formed in such kind of Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MAPbI3 thin film. Accordingly, a high-efficiency separation of electron–hole pairs is achieved. More interestingly, surface states also can be eliminated completely. Particularly, significant improvement of optical absorption is found in a “1-1-1” type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted thin film (at the top, middle and bottom layers of MAPbI3 thin film, each layer is inserted by one Sr–Cl-layer). This work provides guidance for designing promising layered HOIP absorbers for photovoltaic applications.
2. Computational details
All the calculations were implemented using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)24 in the framework of the ab initio density-functional theory (DFT)25 with the projector augmented wave (PAW)26 method for computing the interactions between valence electrons and core electrons, and the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion was set to be 500 eV which can provide sufficient computational accuracy based on our energy tests. For structural properties, the exchange-correlation potentials were treated by the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)27 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.28 In consideration of the molecular nature of MA+,29,30 PBE calculations incorporating Van der Waals corrections (PBE + vdW)31 were performed to obtain the accurate total-energy, force and lattice constants. In the calculations, the convergence criteria for energy and force were set to be 10−8 eV and 10−6 eV Å−1, respectively. The Gamma centered grids of k-points were used to sample the first Brillouin zone. The k-point meshes were set to 1 × 10 × 10 for perovskite films. The vacuum space was set to be 20 Å to avoid the interactions between two neighboring films. It is noted that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect was reported in MAPbI3 materials because of the strong relativistic effect of Pb.32 Therefore, we performed HSE06 + SOC calculations (see details in Section S1 in the ESI†) to accurately obtain the electronic properties of all the structures in this work.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure and surface stability
Based on the method above, we first determine the structure of the organic–inorganic halide perovskite thin film in the orthorhombic phase (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI†). Taking MAPbI3 as an example, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the MAPbI3 film consists of six Pb–I-layers (Pb-centred octahedral layers). In this arrangement, the total thickness of the film is about 3.7 nm, almost equal to the effective exciton Bohr radius (∼4.0 nm),33,34 implying that the electrostatic Coulomb force of the electron–hole pair is rather weak.

Owing to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the thin film, surfaces play an important role in determining the stability of a layered structure. Two types of facets appearing in this work are modeled, including MAPbI3 and MASrCl3 facets, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). We first evaluate the surface stability of the thin films with different terminations. Three types of typical surface terminations, i.e., flat, MAI(MACl) and vacant terminations, are considered. The stabilities of the differently terminated surfaces are determined by calculating the relative surface energies (γs) (see details in Section S3 in the ESI†). Fig. 1(c) and (d) present the relative surface energies for the three types of surfaces under different chemical conditions. From Fig. 1(c), one can observe that the MAI-terminated surface of MAPbI3 is the most stable one whether under MAI-rich or PbI2-rich conditions, and its surface energy is obviously lower than those of the other surface configurations. The flat and vacancy terminated surfaces are energetically unfavorable. Recently, Yang et al.35 also demonstrated that MAI-terminated 2D MAPbI3 is even more stable than its 3D counterpart. Likewise, the MACl-terminated surface structure of MASrCl3 is the most energetically favorable at any chemical potential, as shown in Fig. 1(d). This conclusion is in accordance with the experimental results, indicating that MA-halogen-terminated surfaces are the most stable.36,37
3.2 Electronic properties of the a-b-c type MPI film
On the basis of the discussion above, we first investigate the electronic structure of the pristine MAPbI3 thin film terminated with {110} MAI facets, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Because the MAI-terminated surface isn't in accordance with the stoichiometric ratio of bulk MAPbI3, it has the general formula MAn+1PbnI3n+1 (MPI, n = 6), where n is the number of layers. One can observe that most carriers accumulate at the film surfaces, i.e., the electrons at the CBM (conduction band minimum) mainly distribute at the bottom surface of the film, while the holes at the VBM (valence band maximum) mainly distribute at the top surface. This kind of carrier distribution originates from the surface effect because of randomly oriented organic molecules and a similar size to the exciton Bohr radius (see Section S4 in the ESI† for details). Unfortunately, these surface states can catalyze carrier recombination and greatly reduce the carrier diffusion length and lifetime.38 This is why electron and hole transporting layers are needed to extract carriers in experiments.39

The charge-density distributions correspond to the bands emphasized in blue. The position of the Fermi level is set to energy zero. 
Surface passivation is an effective strategy to remove surface states. To realize this, we inserted Sr–Cl-layers between Pb–I-layers at different positions to form an “a-b-c” type layered structure so as to tune the electronic structure of the MPI film. The Sr–Cl-layer is considered in this work because of the strong metallic character of Sr atoms and large electronegativity of Cl atoms, which can generate great interactions with Pb–I-layers. The symbols a, b and c represent the numbers of inserted Sr–Cl-layers at the top, middle and bottom of the MPI film, respectively, as shown in the right panels of Fig. 2. Noting that the “insertion” of Sr–Cl-layers in this work can be regarded as a kind of “substitution”; that is, when one Sr–Cl-layer is inserted into MPI, a Pb–I-layer is removed correspondingly. Thus, the total number of the Sr–Cl- and Pb–I-layers of the film still remains at six. The small lattice mismatch between MAPbI3 and MASrCl3 ensures the Sr–Cl-layers being well-matched with Pb–I-layers solidly (see Tables S2 to S4 in the ESI†).
We first investigate the “1-0-1” type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted structure. In this structure, two Sr–Cl-layers are inserted at the top and bottom surfaces of the MPI film. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 2(b), the charge-density isosurfaces are all confined in the region of middle Pb–I-layers, and no charge distributes on the surface Sr–Cl-layers, indicating that the surface states of the thin film are removed completely. Nevertheless, accompanied with the elimination of surface states, both electrons and holes occupy the same zone in middle Pb–I-layers spatially. The overlapping of electron and hole distributions indicates that they easily recombine with each other.
To solve this problem, we further inserted another Sr–Cl-layer into the middle Pb–I-layer so as to form a “1-1-1” type layered structure, which can be written as MAn+1Pb0.5nSr0.5nI1.5n+1Cl1.5n (n = 6). As shown in Fig. 2(c), the states of the CBM and VBM in such a 1-1-1 type layered structure are completely separated into different layers while the surfaces still have no charge distribution. This indicates that there exists a band offset in both the conduction band and valence band. Our calculations show that the confinement energies of the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) are 0.36 and 0.46 eV, respectively. So large band offsets can cause electrons and holes to redistribute towards the lowest energy state and reversely move to different sides of the film. As a result, a spontaneous separation of electrons and holes is induced in the interior of the film. From Fig. 2(c), one can also observe that such a 1-1-1 type layered structure exhibits a direct band-gap with the CBM and VBM located at the Z(0, 0, 0.5) point, for which the band-gap is only 1.64 eV, even slightly smaller than that of the bulk (∼1.70 eV). This phenomenon is somewhat in contrast to the quantum confinement effect; that is, a 2D material should present a wider band-gap than its 3D structure. This abnormality stems from the redistribution of electrons and holes in different perovskite layers, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2(c). It can be found that the states of the CBM and VBM of the 1-1-1 thin film are completely confined in the different layers of MAPbI3, implying a band offset: the CBM (VBM) of the upper MAPbI3 layers is higher than that of the lower layers (staggered gap), which results in a smaller band-gap of the integrated structure compared to an independent MAPbI3 region.
In order to gain a deep insight into the effect of the Sr–Cl-middle-layer, we further plot the schematic energy band diagram and internal electric field distribution of the 1-1-1 type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI thin film, as shown in Fig. 3(a). It is clearly seen that the interfacial coupling between Sr–Cl- and Pb–I-layers plays an important role in modulating the band structure. Since the Sr atom has greater metallic character than Pb while the electronegativity of Cl is stronger than that of I, the interaction between the Sr atomic layer and neighbouring I atomic layer will produce a forward electric field Efr, and so does the interaction between the Pb atomic layer and neighbouring Cl atomic layer. Accordingly, a built-in electric field is formed. Such a forward electric field leads to band bending at the interfaces, further resulting in a bias force for separating the electron–hole pairs.

(c) Schematic energy band diagrams of the 1-0-1 type MPI film. (d) Electrostatic potential of the 1-0-1 type MPI film. The red and blue lines are the average electrostatic potentials of the electron- and hole-rich areas of MAPbI3, respectively. The position of the Fermi level is set to energy zero. 

Fig. 3(b) shows a plot of the electrostatic potential distribution perpendicular to the film surface for the 1-1-1 type Sr–Cl-middle-layer-inserted MPI thin film, from which the spontaneous polarization strength can be estimated. A 0.68 eV electrostatic potential difference between two Pb–I-layers on two sides of the Sr–Cl-middle-layer is obtained. Accordingly, the strength of spontaneous polarization is estimated to be 16.92 μC cm−2, which can produce a built-in electric field strong enough for the spontaneous separation of electron–hole pairs. For comparison, we also present the schematic energy band diagram and the electrostatic potential of the 1-0-1 type MPI film in which only two Sr–Cl-layers are inserted, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The calculation results show that the electrostatic potential difference in this structure is only 0.09 eV, producing 6.06 μC cm−2 spontaneous polarization, which is in accordance with other calculations.40–43
The results above demonstrate that the 1-1-1 type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI structure has a superior electronic structure which can greatly facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs. In order to make a well-rounded evaluation on how the number and position of Sr–Cl-inserted-layers influence the electronic structure of the MPI film, we also calculate all kinds of a-b-c type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI structures. Accordingly, we plot the phase diagram depicting the relationship between the band-gap/charge distribution and the number/position of Sr–Cl-layers, as shown in Fig. 4. One can clearly see that as the background converts from white to pink to purple, the electronic structure gradually changes – i.e., the states of electrons and holes transform from complete overlapping to absolute separation. The insertion of Sr–Cl-middle-layers is crucial for such an electronic structure change (see details in Section S6 in the ESI†): (i) the electrons and holes are hardly independent of each other without any Sr–Cl-middle-layer (pink and white regions in Fig. 4). In the pink region, the distributions of electrons and holes partly overlap. In the white region, electrons and holes completely recombine. (ii) When there exist Sr–Cl-middle-layers (e.g., 1-1-2, 1-2-1 and 1-1-1, shown in the purple region of Fig. 4), electron–hole pairs could separate completely. Besides, spontaneous polarization always emerges no matter how many Sr–Cl-middle-layers are inserted into the MPI. However, the band-gaps of 1-1-2 and 1-2-1 structures with four Sr–Cl-layers (1.92 and 1.99 eV, respectively) are much larger than that of the 1-1-1 type layered structure (1.64 eV). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the competition between the band bending and component change. The insertion of the Sr–Cl-layer results in band bending, which leads to a small band-gap of 2D perovskite (similar to the type-II band alignment). As the components of Sr and Cl atoms increase, Vegard's law plays an important role in the enlargement of the band-gap because the band-gap of MASrCl3 is much larger than that of MAPbI3. Therefore, although the middle Sr–Cl intercalation layer is essential for inducing spontaneous polarization, it is ideal to introduce Sr–Cl-middle-layers as few as possible.
 Fig. 4  The band-gaps of layered a-b-c type MPI structures with different Sr–Cl intercalation layers. The characters “d” and “i” in the circles represent direct and indirect band-gaps, respectively. The purple background means that the layered structures undergo spontaneous separation of electrons and holes, and the pink (white) background means the electrons and holes are partly (completely) recombined. The insets show the atomic structures and band-edge charge distributions of layered a-b-c type structures with different Sr–Cl intercalation layers. 
3.3 Optical properties of the 1-1-1 type MPI film
As is well-known, two main points determine the photovoltaic properties of organic perovskites, i.e., the effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and absorption of sunlight. The results above indicate that our present a-b-c type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI structure is beneficial for effective separation of electrons and holes. Now we turn to examine its light absorption properties by calculating the absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient originates from the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω)+ iε2(ω), which depends on frequency ω. ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) can be obtained using the Kramers–Kronig relation. The absorption coefficient α(ω) can be acquired from the following formula,44 (1)where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Based on eqn (1), we measure light absorption spectra of the 1-1-1 type layered structure with {110} surfaces, as shown in Fig. 5. In the range from 1.0 to 4.0 eV where the solar spectrum mainly centralizes, the absorption spectra exhibit an obvious red shift compared with those of the pristine MPI film. This means that the 1-1-1 type layered structure has a wider absorption range than the pristine MPI film. In particular, around 2.0 to 3.0 eV where the solar spectrum has the highest values, the absorption coefficients of the 1-1-1 type layered structure are much larger than those of the pristine MPI film whether under parallel or perpendicular incident light. We also characterize the 1-1-1 type layered structure with {100} surfaces and found that it also shows an enhanced optical absorption (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). We consider that this so greatly enhanced optical absorption mainly originates from the following reason: CBM and VBM states are mainly contributed by p electrons, hybridizing with very few s electrons (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†). The p–p transitions are much larger than s–p transitions in the 1-1-1 type MPI because s–p orbital hybridizations in 1-1-1 type MPI are much less than those in pristine MPI around the Fermi level. The strong p–p transitions result in a significantly enhanced optical absorption. This process is also widely observed in Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS),45 III–V semiconductors46 and other optical-absorber materials.

3.4 Thermodynamic stability of the 1-1-1 type MPI film
Finally, it is necessary to consider the thermodynamic stability and feasibility of experimental synthesis for the present Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI films. We first calculate the cleavage energy Ec to examine the stability of the interface between the Sr–Cl-layer and Pb–I-layer in the 1-1-1 type layered structure. Because extra Sr–Cl-layers are inserted into MAPbI3, there is a risk of splitting at the interface between the Sr–Cl-layer and Pb–I-layer leaving the two surfaces exposed, i.e., the Pb–I and Sr–Cl surfaces (see details in Section S9 in the ESI†). Thus, the Ec is calculated using the following formula: (2)where ET is the total energy of a Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI film; EPb–I is the energy of exfoliation with a Pb–I surface and ESr–Cl is the energy of the cleaved part with a Sr–Cl surface; A is the area of the cleaved surface. The calculated cleavage energy between the Sr–Cl-layer and Pb–I-layer is −10.1 meV Å−2. As a reference, the cleavage energy of pristine MAPbI3 is calculated to be −14.6 meV Å−2. It is seen that both values are almost the same and are negative, indicating that the interface in the 1-1-1 type layered structure is still stable with the insertion of Sr–Cl-layers. The Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI film will not be cleaved spontaneously.
In addition, we examine the thermodynamic stability of the 1-1-1 type layered structure against chemical decomposition. Two extreme decomposition pathways are considered (see details in Section S10 in the ESI†), and the calculated decomposition enthalpy is between 1.797 and 23.969 meV per atom. The positive decomposition enthalpy means that the 1-1-1 type layered structure can be synthesized and will not give rise to spontaneous decomposition.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have performed systematic DFT calculations to investigate a-b-c type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI thin films. The Sr–Cl intercalation layers play a crucial role in eliminating the surface states and inducing large spontaneous polarization. The strong polarization induced by the insertion of the Sr–Cl-middle-layer causes band-bending and a built-in electric field in the MPI film, leading to a spontaneous separation of electrons and holes. Besides, both the number and position of Sr–Cl-inserted-layers have significant influences on the electronic structure of the MPI film, as established in the phase diagram. In particular, among all the a-b-c type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI structures, the 1-1-1 type layered MPI structure exhibits superior properties, including small band-gap (1.64 eV), large spontaneous polarization (16.92 μC cm−2) and strong sunlight absorption. Moreover, such a 1-1-1 type layered structure exhibits good thermodynamic stability, indicative of possible synthesis in experiments. This work provides us with a feasible strategy to design high-efficiency HOIP materials for solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The side views of the optimized surfaces of (a) MAPbI3 and (b) MASrCl3, respectively. The surface energies of (c) MAPbI3 and (d) MASrCl3 with three types of surface terminations under different chemical potential conditions.	 

 	Fig. 2  Band structures (left panels) and charge-density distributions of the band-edge states (right panels) of layered (a) traditional MPI, (b) 1-0-1 type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI and (c) 1-1-1 type Sr–Cl-layer-inserted MPI structures with {110} facets. The charge-density distributions correspond to the bands emphasized in blue. The position of the Fermi level is set to energy zero.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic energy band diagrams and internal electric field distributions of the 1-1-1 type MPI film. (b) Electrostatic potential of the 1-1-1 type MPI film. (c) Schematic energy band diagrams of the 1-0-1 type MPI film. (d) Electrostatic potential of the 1-0-1 type MPI film. The red and blue lines are the average electrostatic potentials of the electron- and hole-rich areas of MAPbI3, respectively. The position of the Fermi level is set to energy zero.	 

 	Fig. 4  The band-gaps of layered a-b-c type MPI structures with different Sr–Cl intercalation layers. The characters “d” and “i” in the circles represent direct and indirect band-gaps, respectively. The purple background means that the layered structures undergo spontaneous separation of electrons and holes, and the pink (white) background means the electrons and holes are partly (completely) recombined. The insets show the atomic structures and band-edge charge distributions of layered a-b-c type structures with different Sr–Cl intercalation layers.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 5  Optical absorption spectra of layered pristine MPI and 1-1-1 type MPI thin films along (a) out-of-plane (α⊥-xx), (b) y in-plane (α‖-yy) and (c) z in-plane (α‖-zz) polarization directions. The solar spectrum is plotted on the right-Y coordinate as a reference.
