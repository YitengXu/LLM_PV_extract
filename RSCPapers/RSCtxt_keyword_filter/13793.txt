    , Accepted 4th August 2011First published on 30th August 2011AbstractA new series of metal-free organic dyes containing pyrene and α-cyanoacrylic acid end groups and thiophene, bithiophene, thienylbenzene or thienylfluorene π-linkers were synthesized and characterized by absorption, emission and electrochemical measurements. Time-dependent density functional theoretical calculations were also performed to unravel the nature of the absorption induced electronic excitations. Extension of conjugation in the π-linker by the incorporation of phenyl or fluorene was found to enhance the molar extinction coefficient while the use of thiophene red-shifted the absorption. The longer wavelength absorption peaks found for the dyes were attributed to π–π* transition with a contribution from the charge transfer transition which becomes prominent for the bithiophene bridged derivative. The bithiophene containing dye showed moderate overall light-to-electron conversion efficiency attributable to the favorable absorption and redox properties originating due to the presence of a bithiophene segment. The trends observed for the various dyes in the device performance were rationalized by electron-impedance spectroscopy measurements.
I Introduction
There is a growing interest for the renewable energy sources due to the depletion of fossil fuels and contribution to the global warming from the conventional energy generation techniques. Among the alternative energy sources light energy appears to be more promising as it is available aplenty from the sun. Many protocols have been developed in the last few decades to convert the light energy to electrical energy based on the photovoltaic principle.1 The photoelectrochemical cells constructed utilizing the organic or organometallic dyes are attractive due their potential to offer higher conversion efficiency at a lower cost.2 Though the Ru-based organometallic dyes have shown better power conversion efficiencies and device stabilities when compared to the metal-free organic dyes, they are more expensive and involve cumbersome purification procedures which inhibit the proliferation for structural diversity.3 Recently, improvements in photovoltaic performance (up to 10%) have been achieved for organic dyes due to extensive structure–property relationships in donor–acceptor molecules gathered over the decades.4 Most of these organic dyes feature common structural elements such as the terminal amine donor group, π-conjugation linker and α-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor.5–10 The latter also serves as an anchoring unit to the TiO2 nanoparticles. Alternative acceptor units such as rhodanine-3-acetic acid have also been explored with limited success.12 The domination of the α-cyanoacrylic acid segment in the organic dyes suitable for dye-sensitized solar cells is attributed to its coplanarity with respect to the spacer unit and good electron coupling with TiO2.13
Polyaryl/heteroaryl π-conjugated segments such as biphenyl,5 terphenyl,6 oligothiophene,7 fluorene,8 anthracene,9 carbazole,10 fluoranthene11 or their combination have been used as a spacer in organic dyes and found to be beneficial for the light harvesting capability and charge transfer interaction between the donor and acceptor units. Similarly, triarylamines have been used as terminal donors in the organic dyes owing to many advantages, namely (a) they generally inherit lower redox potential which is beneficial for the regeneration of the dyes by the electrolyte system, (b) they may form a denser hydrophobic film on the surface of the TiO2 and thereby prevent the interaction of triiodide ions in the electrolyte with TiO2, and inhibit the aggregation of the dyes at the surface of the TiO2 due to their nonplanar structure.
In this paper, we report the synthesis of a new class of organic dyes having linkers featuring different aromatic units (phenyl/thiophene/fluorene) between pyrenyl and α-cyanoacrylic acid terminal groups. Even though substituted pyrenes are used as a sensitizer14 in photochemical studies their use in dyes suitable for dye-sensitized solar cells remains unexplored. We thought that the extended π-system present in the pyrene though considered as a weak acceptor could be exploited as a sensitizing unit by coupling with electron-rich moieties such as thiophene and/or fluorene. It would be interesting to evaluate the role of the π-bridge in enhancing the donor strength of the aromatic segments and thus modulating the electrochemical and optical properties. Also, the hydrophobic pyrene units are expected to retard the recombination of the injected electron with the aqueous electrolyte and enhance the photocurrent. Thus, we have designed and synthesized five new organic dyes (Fig. 1) capable of absorbing light in the visible region and present the effect of the linkers on the absorption properties such as λmax and molar absorptivity (εmax), and the photovoltaic characteristics.

II Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The pyrene-based organic dyes containing varying lengths of π-conjugation pathway composed of benzene, thiophene, and/or fluorene units were synthesized as illustrated in Scheme 1. The precursor 2-(pyren-1-yl)thiophene was synthesized by Kumada coupling15 between 1-bromopyrene and thiophen-2-yl-magnesium bromide in reasonable yield. It was then converted to the stannyl derivative by treatment with n-butyllithium followed by quenching with tri-n-butyl-tin chloride. The Stille coupling16 reactions of this stannane with appropriate bromo-substituted arylcarboxaldehyde in the presence of a palladium catalyst Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 led to the desired pyrene containing aryl aldehydes (3a–3e). The aldehydes were subsequently converted in moderate yields to the target dyes (4a–4e) by a condensation reaction with cyanoacetic acid involving ammonium acetate as the catalyst and glacial acetic acid as the solvent. The dyes are soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF) and insoluble in hexanes, toluene, and ethyl acetate. The dyes were characterized by IR, NMR (1H and 13C) and mass spectral methods and the spectroscopic data are consistent with the proposed structures.

Optical properties
The light absorbing properties of the new dyes were examined by measuring the absorption spectra in THF solutions. The absorption spectra of the dyes measured for the THF solutions are displayed in Fig. 2 and the relevant parameters are listed in Table 1. All the dyes display a broad absorption envelope with a peak in the range 363–433 nm and a higher energy shoulder. In addition all the dyes show a weak band below 300 nm. The peak at the longer wavelength is attributed to a transition originating from the entire molecule with a prominent charge transfer character, while the shorter wavelength peak stems from the pyrene localized π–π* excitation. The latter assignment was based on the resemblance of this peak to that observed for parent pyrene.17

 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the dyes recorded in tetrahydrofuran. 
In general, the peak position of a π–π* transition band depends on the effective conjugation length while the charge-transfer band will be affected by the nature of electron donor, acceptor, and the bridge connecting them. A closer inspection of the absorption parameters reveals the following important features. Compound 4b inherits the most blue-shifted absorption profile and exhibits a significant hypsochromism when compared to the analogous derivative 4c. It appears that the disposition of the cyanoacrylic acid unit in the meta position not only restricts the conjugation but also disfavors the electronic interaction between the donor and acceptor units.18 Among the dyes, 4d possesses the elongated conjugation; however the absorption peak of 4d is positioned close to that of 4c. From this it may be deduced that the longer wavelength absorption in these dyes is not purely π–π* in nature. The bithiophene bridged compound 4e shows the most bathochromically shifted absorption profile while the thiophene linked derivative 4a displays the least intense peak in the series suggestive of a role attributable to the electron donation ability of the π-linker. It is reasonable to assume that the increment in the electron richness (4e > 4c > 4a) of the π-bridge facilitates the charge transfer transition. The larger extinction coefficient observed for the dye 4d when compared to 4c is assigned to the extension of conjugation in 4d and the electron richness of the thienylfluorene segment. Extension of conjugation favors the transition probability of the π–π* transition while the increment in the donor strength of the π-linker facilitates the charge transfer transition. In view of the above facts, the longer wavelength broad absorption profile is assigned as a charge-transfer transition with contribution from the π–π* transition.
The deprotonation of the carboxylic acid will decrease the electron-accepting strength of the cyanoacrylic acid moiety; on the other hand protonation will restore the acceptor strength.5 Thus, a blue shift for the lower energy absorption band in the presence of triethylamine and a slight red shift on addition of trifluoroacetic acid (Fig. 3) observed for the dyes 4c–4e suggest the occurrence of acid–base equilibria for the dyes in solutions.5,19
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the dye 4e in tetrahydrofuran recorded in the presence of TFA or TEA. 
However, addition of TEA/TFA did not affect the absorption profile of the dyes 4a and 4b (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Since the pyrene moiety is not an effective donor, it appears that the donor strength needs to be augmented by the π-bridge to ensure an effective charge transfer. This further confirms the charge transfer nature of this prominent peak particularly for the dyes with electron rich π-linkers (4c, 4d and 4e).
As the experimental evidences indicated the presence of both π–π* and charge transfer characteristics for the electronic transitions in these dyes, we have performed density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations20 to understand the electronic structure of the new dyes and the nature of the electronic excitations. Firstly, the geometries of the dyes were optimized using tight SCF convergence conditions implemented in the Gaussian 09 program21 suite without imposing any symmetry constraints. The optimized geometries were confirmed to be free from imaginary IR frequencies and correspond to the global minimum in the potential energy surface (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†).
Then the optimized structures were used in the TDDFT computations for the identification of probable vertical transitions in these molecules.
The computed CN stretching frequencies of the dyes 4a–4e are 2336, 2343, 2339, 2336 and 2333 cm−1, respectively, and agree well with the observed values (2213, 2227, 2220, 2229 and 2217 cm−1). The co-planarity of the aryl groups involved in the π-bridge is essential for the efficient electronic migration through the linker from the donor to the acceptor. The optimized geometries exhibited wider inter-planar angles between the aryl groups for the phenylene or fluorene containing derivatives (4b–4d) and the deviation from planarity increased in the order 4e < 4c < 4d < 4b (Fig. 4). This suggests that the usage of an oligothiophene segment as a π-linker is highly beneficial for charge transfer as it tends to assume planar arrangement besides being electron rich. For all the dyes, the cyanoacrylic acid group is found to be coplanar with the adjacent spacer unit (phenyl/fluorene/thiophene), indicating a facile extension of conjugation between the aryl spacer and cyanoacrylic acid groups.
 Fig. 4  Computed interplanar angles between the different aryl groups in the dyes. 
The electronic distributions observed for the frontier molecular orbitals of the dyes are shown in Fig. 5 and the computed excitation energies for the vertical transitions and their oscillator strengths and compositions in terms of molecular orbitals are compiled in Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dyes is mainly contributed by the pyrenylthiophene segment while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is delocalized over the aryl acrylic acid unit. The presence of such well separated frontier molecular orbitals at the two different ends featuring donor and acceptor characters in the molecular materials is expected to produce a charge migration on electronic excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.22 According to the B3LYP23 computations, the longer wavelength vertical transitions in the dyes originate from the HOMO to LUMO electronic excitations with reasonable oscillator strengths. However, the CAM-B3LYP24 model suggested this prominent absorption to result from the electronic promotion from the HOMO to LUMO/LUMO + 1 and HOMO − 1 to LUMO. Since the trend observed in the absorption peak positions of the dyes and the values are within 5% deviation limit of the CAM-B3LYP results (Fig. 6), we presume that the composition of the transitions predicted by the CAM-B3LYP is more reliable. From the electronic distributions observed for the HOMO, HOMO − 1, LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals (Fig. 5), the longer wavelength electronic excitation for the dyes is predicted to contain both charge transfer and π–π* characters.

 Fig. 6  Comparison of observed (THF + TFA) and calculated electronic absorption maxima for the dyes using different theoretical models. 
All the compounds display a weak emission with characteristic colors ranging from blue to orange in THF solutions (Fig. 7 and Table 1). The emission wavelengths of the dyes assume the following increasing order: 4b < 4d < 4a < 4c < 4e, which is slightly different from that observed for the absorption peaks (cf.4b < 4a < 4c < 4d < 4e). Though the fluorene containing dye 4d contains elongated conjugation, due to the enhanced rigidity and reduced charge transfer interaction it displays a blue shifted emission profile when compared to the dyes 4a, 4c and 4e. It is probable that due to the less polar hydrophobic excited state structure, the dye 4d is not effectively solvated by THF while the other dyes (4a, 4c and 4e) are stabilized in the excited state by the solvent–solute interactions.25
 Fig. 7  Emission spectra of the dyes (4a–4e) recorded in tetrahydrofuran. 
In order to probe the effect of solvent environments on the ground and excited state structures of the dyes, the solvatochromism was investigated by measuring the absorption and emission spectra in selected solvents with different dielectric constants. In general, the dyes exhibited red-shifted absorption and emission profiles in toluene and dichloromethane and shorter wavelength absorptions in dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (for instance, see Fig. 8). Unusual red-shift in the absorption and emission spectra of the dyes may originate from the stabilization due to the fast rearrangement of polarizable electrons during excitation which is induced by the relatively large polarizability of dichloromethane.26 Lippert–Mataga analysis of the solvatochromic data showed non-linear relationships for the dyes with the exception of 4b (Fig. 9). This indicates that in the dyes which possess strong push–pull nature, besides the general effects due to the interaction of the dye dipole with its environment, the specific interaction between the dye and solvent such as hydrogen bonding or the formation and stabilization of intramolecular charge transfer states in particular solvent surroundings are also playing a role. Hydrogen bonding of the solvent with the carboxylic acid group of the dye will reduce the acceptor strength of the cyanoacrylic acid unit and decrement the absorption maximum. Reasonable linearity observed for 4b in the Lippert–Mataga analysis is attributed to the absence of donor–acceptor interaction in this dye due to the meta disposition of the acceptor unit.

Electrochemical properties
In order to ascertain the feasibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2 and the dye regeneration the electrochemical characteristics of the dyes were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). All the dyes with the exception of 4a exhibited two irreversible oxidation peaks (Table 1). The first irreversible oxidation wave detected for the dyes 4a–4e in the range 0.75–0.91 V versus ferrocene was attributed to the removal of an electron from the pyrenylthiophene segment while the second irreversible oxidation occurring at the higher potential values belongs to the oxidation of the pyrene moiety. The magnitude of the first oxidation potential observed for the dyes was highly dependent on the nature of the π-bridge which either modulates the donor–acceptor interaction or increments the oxidation propensity of the pyrenylthiophene unit. Stronger communication between the donor and acceptor moieties will retard the electron removal from the donor fragment while the electron-rich π-bridge will facilitate it. Consequently the first oxidation potential for the dyes assumes the trend: 4d < 4e ≈ 4b < 4c < 4a. Facile oxidation observed for the dye 4d points to a weaker donor–acceptor interaction between the pyrenylthiophene and cyanoacrylic acid segments owing to the longer π-spacer.27 Similarly, the meta disposition of the cyanoacrylic acid unit in the dye 4b is responsible for the comparatively smaller oxidation potential. More positive oxidation potential observed for 4a is due to the close association of the cyanoacrylic acid unit with the pyrenylthiophene unit which depletes the electron density successfully from the donor part and the relatively shorter π-segment could not facilitate the removal of electrons.
The excited state oxidation potential (Eox*) of the sensitizer is estimated by subtracting the 0–0 transition energy (E0–0) from the first oxidation potential (Eox), whereas E0–0 is derived from the absorption edge of the dyes since no reduction peak was observed for the dyes. The trends observed in the ground and excited state oxidation potentials for the dyes are depicted in Fig. 10. The ground state oxidation potentials of the dyes occur in the range of 1.51 to 1.67 V versus NHE. These values are more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE)28 and suggest that the dye regeneration by the electrolyte is thermodynamically allowed. The excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes are in the range of −0.80 to −1.30 V versus NHE, and more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE).29 This ensures that the electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2 should be energetically favorable.

DSSC characteristics
From the above discussions it is evident that the dyes developed in this work possess promising light absorption properties and suitable ground/excited state oxidation potentials to use them as potential sensitizers in the conventional dye-sensitized solar cells. We have fabricated nanocrystalline TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells with a liquid electrolyte system and tested the performance of the dyes as sensitizers. The pertinent parameters observed under AM 1.5 global one sun light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are listed in Table 3. The current–voltage characteristics and the IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 11 and 12 respectively.

I–V characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated using the dyes 4a–4e. 
 Fig. 12  IPCE plots observed for the DSSCs fabricated using the dyes 4a–4e. 
The light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs are largely in agreement with the optical properties of the dyes. The higher overall efficiency observed for the dyes 4c–4e is attributable to the red-shifted high molar extinction coefficient absorption realized for these dyes on comparison to the dyes 4a and 4b, which led to a significant hike in the short-circuit photocurrent density.30 Under illumination conditions, Voc of the photoelectrochemical is the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in the nanocrystalline TiO2 film and redox potential of the electrolyte. The pronounced rate of electron recombination between the injected electron from the conduction band of TiO2 and the triiodide or oxidized dye could reduce the Voc. Additionally the band-edge shift occurring due to the interaction of the dye with TiO2 will also alter the Voc. However, a strong dipole present at the TiO2/dye interface will contribute to a more negative shift in the Fermi level of the TiO2 conduction band. The highest Voc observed for the devices fabricated using the dyes 4d and 4e may be attributed to the stronger interaction between the TiO2 and the dye while the lowest Voc exhibited by 4a may be probably due to poor interaction between the dye and TiO2 and aggregation of the dye.31 Aggregation of the dyes is reported to facilitate the recombination of the injected electrons and reduce the Voc.32
Since the ground state oxidation potentials of the dyes are falling in a narrow range (1.51–1.67 eV) we presume that the dye regeneration may remain as a common factor. However, the excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes range from −0.8 to −1.3 eV which may lead to differences in the electron injection propensity of the dyes and alter the photocurrent generation. Consequently high IPCE values (Fig. 10) were realized for the dyes 4c–4e attributable to their intense red-shifted absorption and favorable electron injection.
The diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 13) obtained under illumination conditions increased in the order of 4e < 4d < 4c < 4b < 4a, which indicates that the photoelectron generation and transport are enhanced in the order of 4a < 4b < 4c < 4d < 4e. This is in accordance with the progressive increase in the intramolecular charge transfer for the dyes on moving from 4a to 4e. The electron rich conjugation bridge enriches the intramolecular charge transfer and increases the charge-injection rate. Retardation of charge recombination on extension of the conjugation pathway may also act in concert with the above factor. The Bode phase plots observed for the devices fabricated using the dyes are shown in Fig. 14. The electron lifetime can be extracted from the angular frequency (ωmin)33 at the mid-frequency peak in the Bode phase plot using τe = 1/ωmin and falls in the range of 0.64–2.09 ms. The electron lifetime follows the trend 4a < 4e < 4c < 4b = 4d. The shorter electron lifetime of 4a is self-explanatory and is in accordance with the shorter conjugation, however the relatively shorter electron lifetime for 4e is noteworthy as it exhibited larger overall conversion efficiency in the DSSC. Electron recombination is suppressed in molecules containing a semi-rigid conjugation pathway with nonplanar arrangement as it inhibits aggregation.34 The more planar structural arrangement (vide supra) observed for 4e may be responsible for the shorter electron lifetime.

III Conclusions
We have developed new organic dyes based on pyrene and α-cyanoacrylic acid end groups and π-linkers derived from rigid aromatic/heteroaromatic segments of differing electron richness. We have observed a significant role for the bridging units in the present dyes which lack trivial donor groups. Elongation of conjugation and/or increment in the electron richness for the π-linkers produced a red-shift in the absorption and reduction in the oxidation potentials which manifested in the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Enhanced light absorption properties observed for the bithiophene and thienylfluorene containing derivatives were responsible for the higher overall efficiency realized for them. The present study clearly reveals that harmony of structural elements in the organic dyes is essential to achieve desired positive outcome in the device performance.
IV Experimental
The general experimental methods and instruments used in the present study were described in our earlier publication.5
Synthesis of 5-(pyren-1-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3a)
A round bottom flask was charged with 1-bromopyrene (0.843 g, 3.0 mmol), (5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)tributylstannane (3.3 mmol) and 7 ml DMF. Nitrogen was purged into this, followed by the addition of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (21.0 mg, 1 mol%). This was kept on heating at 80 °C for 16 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of reaction time, the mixture was poured into cold water and extracted with dichloromethane followed by washing with brine solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Then the solvent was evaporated by applying vacuum. The resultant liquid was dissolved in 5 ml acetic acid and heated to 60 °C for 30 min. Then 10 ml of water was added to it and heating was continued for 6 h. The resulting solution was extracted with dichloromethane and washed with brine solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.

Computational methods
We have performed theoretical calculations to understand the electronic structure of the fuctional materials by using the Gaussian 09W (Revision-A.02)21 program suite. The geometries of the dyes in vacuo were optimized using density functional theory (DFT)20 with the hybrid B3LYP23 or CAM-B3LYP24 density functional and the 6-31G** basis set. All optimized geometries were subjected to vibrational analysis and potential energy scan and characterized as global minima. The time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) at the level of B3LYP or CAM-B3LYP/6-31G** was further carried out to determine atleast 10 vertical excitations to the excited state of the molecules. The absorption spectra were simulated by using the 10 lowest spin-allowed singlet transitions, mixed Lorentzian–Gaussian lineshape (0.5) and an average full-width at half maximum (3000 cm−1) for all peaks. The computations in THF were performed by applying the polarizable continuum model (PCM)35 using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) to describe the electrostatic solute–solvent interactions by the creation of solute cavity via a set of overlapping spheres.
DSSC fabrication and characterization
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq.−1, transmittance ∼80%, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP (1 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich, 3 g) for obtaining a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. TiO2 paste36 was coated onto the treated conducting glass by using the doctor blade technique. For coating each TiO2 layer, the dried TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The TiO2 photoanodes of the DSSCs employed in the experiments were composed of a 14 μm thick transparent TiO2 layer with a scattering layer of 4.5 μm thickness. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye at room temperature for 24 h. N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio of 1:1) as a standard dye solution. Various organic dye solutions were prepared in a mixing solvent containing ACN, tert-butyl alcohol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (volume ratio of 1:1:3). The thus prepared TiO2/dye electrode was placed on a platinum-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq.−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan), keeping the two electrodes separated by a 25 μm-thick Surlyn® (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). The two electrodes were then sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, Fluka)/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity; the electrolyte-injecting hole was previously made in the counter electrode with a drilling machine, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the injection of the electrolyte.
Surface of the DSSC was covered by a mask with a light-illuminated area of 0.16 cm2 and then illuminated by a class-A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM 1.5 G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd.). Incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The thickness of the TiO2 film was judged by scanning electron microscopic images (SEM, NanoSEM 230, Nova™). For UV-absorption spectra, dye molecules were coated on the TiO2 films and the corresponding spectra were obtained using an UV-visible spectrophotometer (V-570, Jasco, Japan) equipped with a total integrating sphere. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC, between the ITO-Pt counter electrode and the FTO-TiO2-dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit conditions; the corresponding AC amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5 G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/λφ), where λ is the wavelength, JSC is short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
