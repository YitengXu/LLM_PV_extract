    , Accepted 7th November 2022First published on 8th November 2022AbstractOver the last decade, considerable attention has been paid to the formation mechanism of the ordered β conformation for PFO both in the solution and film to prepare high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. However, the process of solvent evaporation and aggregates transferred from the solution to the film also play key roles in forming ordered structures, which have been neglected. In this study, the influence of molecular weight on the above process was systematically studied using techniques such as SLS/DLS, UV-Vis, PL, and TEM. Five samples with different Mw ranging from 25100 Da to 117000 Da were obtained by the precipitation fractionation method. In dilute THF solution, the molecular chains were in α conformation without aggregates. In films, as the molecular weight increased, the content of β conformation and ordered structure increased first and then decreased. By studying the solvent evaporation process, for the first time, we propose a possible mechanism for the transformation process of chain structure and β conformation from the solution to the film, which involves three stages. This study reveals the transformation process of the chain structure and β conformation of PFO from the solution to the film and its relationship with the molecular weight, which provides theoretical and practical versions for in-depth understanding and control of the formation of the ordered structure in high-efficiency films.
1. Introduction
Conjugated polymers (CPs) are a kind of semi-rigid polymers with a special π–π conjugated main chain structure.1,2 It is well known that the chain packing mode, the content, and the distribution of the ordered structure of CPs can directly affect the mobility of carriers.3 Therefore, controlling the self-assembly of CP molecular chains to obtain highly-ordered structures is a key point in the preparation of high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Due to their excellent photovoltaic properties, they have attracted considerable attention in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),4 solar cells,5 field effect transistors,6 and chemical sensors.7
Polyfluorenes (PFs), a class of conjugated polymers,8,9 have received widespread attention due to their high color purity in blue emitting light, good chemical stability, and high quantum yield, ever since they were discovered by Fukuda et al. in the 1990s.10–12 Among various PFs, poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) is a classical model molecule whose special β phase plays a key role in obtaining highly ordered structures.13–15 The β phase is an aggregated state consisting of ordered β conformation. This phase was reported by Bradley et al. in 1997 for the first time.16,17 They found that a UV-Vis absorption peak at 437 nm appeared with the formation of the β phase, which was proved to be the characteristic absorption peak of the β phase. Furthermore, it has been verified that the β phase formed more easily in PFO than in other PFs.18–20 Compared to the conventional amorphous α conformation whose intra-chain torsion angle is about 135° (Fig. 1a), the β conformation has a larger intra-chain torsion angle (165°) and a more planar structure (Fig. 1b).21,22 Consequently, the formation of β conformation leads to a long conjugated length, effective intramolecular/intermolecular charge transport, high-density molecular stacking, and highly anisotropic properties. With these properties, the β conformation favors charge carrier transport as a self-dopant in films.23–25

Over the last decade, in order to prepare films with highly-ordered structures, a large number of studies have focused on the formation mechanism of the ordered β conformation for PFO both in the solution and film, and great progress has been made.13–15,19–22,26,27 Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the changes in the chain structure and the formation mechanism of the ordered phase during the film formation, including the process of solvent evaporation and aggregates transferred from the solution to the film. During the gradual evaporation of the solvent, the concentration of PFO may increase and the molecular chain may undergo a complex self-assembly process that plays a critical role in the formation of ordered structures in films. Moreover, the original aggregates and ordered phase in the solution will remain on the film as the solvent evaporates. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the changing process of the PFO chain structure and related mechanisms from the solution to the thin film.
Due to the soft matter properties of polymers, the chain structure and ordered phase in solutions and films can be affected by many factors, such as molecular weight, temperature, concentration, and shear force. Among various factors, molecular weight is the basic parameter of polymers, which has a great influence on the physical performance of polymer products. From a micro-level perspective, molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) can impact device performance (such as carrier mobility and power conversion efficiency) by influencing the solubility, crystallinity, phase transition behaviors, and morphology of the polymers in solutions and films.28–32 Small changes in the molecular weight can dramatically alter the solution properties, film morphology, and the orderliness of the films.33–35 Therefore, it is important to study the transfer process of chain-condensed structures and ordered conformation of PFO from the solution to the film from the perspective of molecular weight.
In our study, the drop-casting method, rather than the spin-coating method, was used because the slower solvent evaporation process favors the formation of β conformation and allows the detection of the evolution of PFO chains. In this work, we systematically studied the influence of molecular weight on the transformation process of PFO chain structure and β conformation from the solution to the film by using dynamic/static light scattering (DLS/SLS), UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), Raman spectroscopy, polarizing light optical microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Firstly, five narrowly-distributed samples (PDI range from 1.31–1.42) with different molecular weights (Mw) were obtained from precipitation fractionation. Secondly, the changes in the chain-condensed structure and β conformation in both the precursor solutions and films were studied. Thirdly, in order to simulate the solvent evaporation process, we prepared a series of different concentrations of PFO solutions as well as naturally volatilized solutions, then we studied the relationship between the aggregation degree and the formation of β conformation. Finally, based on the obtained data, we summarized the dynamic evolution process of the chain structure from the solution to the film and the related mechanism of β conformation formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the process of forming films from precursor solutions is divided into three stages. This research provides a theoretical and experimental basis for screening suitable molecular weight and developing proper methods to increase the content of ordered β conformation in films and subsequently improve the performance of the optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and sample preparation
In this work, we used the precipitation fractionation method to separate the original PFO sample into five samples with different molecular weights. The initial sample was a mixture of three products purchased from two different corporations. One was purchased from American Dye Source, Catalog No. ADS329BE, the mean weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was about 65000 Da in the range of 40000–150000 Da, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was about 2.5. The second sample was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp, China, its weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was in the range of 21000–64000 Da, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was about 3.1. The third sample was also purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp, China, its weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was in the range of 10000–20000 Da, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was about 2.0.
The precipitation fractionation process was conducted as follows: firstly, the mixture of the three original samples was dissolved in toluene by heating and magnetic stirring, and the final quality ratio was 1%. Secondly, it was cooled to room temperature for one day and then ethanol, which is a poor solvent, was added until the solution became turbid. After that, the mixture of the solution and precipitate was filtered to obtain the fraction, the filtered clear solution was subjected to the next step. This fractionation procedure was repeated five times. Finally, we got five PFO samples with different weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) values from 1.31–1.42, which were characterized by combined static/dynamic laser light scattering (SLS and DLS). The samples were named M1 to M5, with increasing molecular weights, respectively,
In this research, samples were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then filtered to remove dust with a 0.22 μm filter to obtain solutions with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 for solution characterization and film preparation. Films were fabricated by dropping about 50 μL of solutions and evaporating the liquid naturally. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol, were supplied by Beijing Chemical Company and they were all chromatographically pure.
2.2 UV-Vis spectrum characterization
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum measurements for PFO solutions and films were performed with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer, all data were obtained after the samples were stable for at least 1 hour, and a quartz plate of 1.5 mm thickness was used for measuring the spectra of the films. Then, all curves were normalized at the peak of α conformation. The calculation method for the β conformation content in the PFO solution and film was reported by us previously and it is provided in the ESI† (Section S1).
2.3 Light scattering measurements
Dynamic light scattering and static light scattering data were obtained using a dynamic/static wide-angle laser light scattering instrument (ALV/CGS-3) made in Germany, which was equipped with ALV/LSE-7004 multiple-τ laser light scattering instrument digital correlator; the light source was a 632.8 nm, JDS single-phase He–Ne laser and had an output power of 22 mW. The light scattering (LS) cell was placed in a thermostatic index-matched vessel containing a clean, dust-free toluene solution.
In SLS, the Rayleigh ratio Rvv(q) (also known as the angular dependence of the absolute excess time-averaged scattering intensity), could result in the z-average root-mean-square radius of gyration Rg of the scattering objects, where q is the scattering vector. During the measurement, the scattering angle can be varied in the range of 50° to 150°. Solutions were kept at room temperature for at least 2 hours before the measurement.
In DLS, the normalized scattering intensity autocorrelation function g2(t) was measured, where t is the decay time. g2(t) can be related to the normalized first-order electric field time correlation function g1(t) via the Siegert relation as g2(t) = 1 + β|g1(t)|2. g1(t) is the Laplace transformation of the decay time distribution function A(t) of the decay rate t. and the A(t) can be required using the CONTIN analysis. The details of the LS theory can be found elsewhere.36–38
2.4 Raman spectroscopy characterization
The Raman spectra of the film samples were measured using a laser microscope confocal Raman spectroscopy system. A laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used to excite the sample. The laser was introduced into the microscope and focused on the sample through a 50 × 0.75 NA objective lens, and the light signal integration time was 10 seconds. The spectrometer was calibrated with a standard Si wire before the measurement.
2.5 Fluorescence spectroscopy characterization
Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh FLS 1000) equipped with a xenon lamp as the excitation source. The measurements were recorded from 416 nm to 650 nm with an excitation wavelength of 396 nm at room temperature.
2.6 SEM measurements
The scanning electron microscopy measurements were performed using the Merlin Compact (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH) instrument with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV for morphological studies.
2.7 POM measurements
Polarizing light optical microscopy (POM) images were obtained using the Zeiss Axio Imager 2 Pol polarizing microscope in the transmission mode, which was equipped with a Zeiss digital camera under parallel and crossed polarizers. A 500× magnification lens was used.
2.8 TEM measurements
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) experiments were carried out using a JEOL-2100 instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and an ultimate lattice resolution of 0.102 nm. The film samples for TEM measurement were dispersed in deionized water and then picked up using copper grids.

As previously reported, THF is a good solvent for PFO,39 however, the single-chain properties (such as the size and shape) of THF with different molecular weights are still unknown. Therefore, they should be characterized before being systematically explored for the transformation of the chain-condensed state structure and β conformation of PFO from the solution to the film. In this section, combined dynamic/static light scattering (DLS/SLS) was used to explore the size, size distribution, and shape of single PFO chains in dilute THF solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1. The conformational properties of the PFO chain in THF were studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Fig. 2a shows the normalized intensity correlation function of the five samples at room temperature (about 25 °C), which reflected how fast the light intensity correlation function decays. Since the Brownian motion of smaller particles is faster than that of bigger ones, their correlation function decays faster. Therefore, as the molecular weight increased, the decay of the correlation function slows down, indicating that the volume of the chain was increased. Besides, there was only one relaxation mode in each curve, which indicated that there was only one kind of particle size in every sample. As shown in Fig. 2b, the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) distribution data was calculated from Fig. 2a. The mean sizes of the five samples were no more than 10 nm, indicating that the molecular chains moved in a single-chain mode.22,31 The size of the molecular chains increased with the increase in molecular weight obviously.

According to previous studies,31,32,40 in good solvent chloroform and moderate solvent toluene, the PFO single-chain had an extended rod-like structure whose flexibility increased with the increase in molecular weight. We wonder what the single-chain conformation will be like and the differences in THF. The values of measured root-mean-square radius of gyration (Rg), actual hydrodynamic radius (Rh), shape parameter (Rg/Rh), and contour length (L) of single-chain at different Mw in dilute THF solutions are summarized in Table 2. According to related reports41,42 when the value of the Rg/Rh is >2.0, the chain conformation is a rigid rod; when the value is in 1.5–1.8, the conformation is a random coil; and when it is in 1.0–1.2, the conformation is a loosely connected hyperbranched structure. That is to say, a high value of Rg/Rh represents an extended and rigid chain conformation of a polymer chain, while a low value of Rg/Rh indicates a compact chain packing of a polymer chain. As shown in Fig. 2c, when the molecular weight increased, the value of Rg/Rh decreased gradually from 8.9 to 3.3. Therefore, single chains were rod-like structures, and their flexibility gradually increased with the increase in molecular weight. According to previous reports, the molecular weight and length of a repeating PFO unit are 388 Da and 0.75 nm, respectively.43 As such, the contour lengths (L) of the PFO chains (from M1 to M5) were about 48.5 nm, 64.2 nm, 113.1 nm, 179.8 nm, and 226.2 nm, respectively. Considering the exclude-volume effect, the persistence length of PFO in THF was about (9.4 ± 0.5) nm with the aid of the quasi-to-parameter (QTP) theory for worm-like or helical worm-like bead chains.44 The contour length of the PFO chains (from M1 to M5) was much longer than the persistent length and it became longer with the increase of molecular weight, which indicated that the shape of single-chain became more and more flexible. In our previous results,31,32 the value of Rg/Rh was 2.71–2.46 in good solvent chloroform (Mw: 47000–145000 Da), and the value of Rg/Rh was 2.38–2.09 in moderate solvent toluene (Mw: 10700–125000 Da). Herein, the value of Rg/Rh was up to 8.9–3.3 in good solvent THF (Mw: 25100–117000 Da). We inferred that the PFO single-chain in THF was more rigid than that in chloroform and toluene because of its better solubility and higher stretch degree.

Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra are usually used to analyze the conformation of PFO in solutions. Since the α conformation was always formed at about 390 nm,19,21,45 the peaks from 384 nm to 391 nm, shown in Fig. 2d, were assigned to α conformation. There was only one peak in every curve with an obvious red-shift from 384 nm to 391 nm as molecular weight increased. The reason for the red-shift phenomenon can be explained as follows. Generally, a red-shift is caused by an increase in the conjugated system. As the molecular weight is increased, the single chain became more and more flexible, leading to the self-folding of single chains and the enhancement of intra-chain π–π interactions, which limits the rotation of repeating PFO units and favors the formation of a larger conjugation system. So, the red-shift was more and more obvious with the increase in the molecular weight.
3.2 Influence of molecular weight on the photophysical properties of PFO films prepared from pure THF solution
To systematically study the influence of molecular weight on the transformation of the chain-condensed state structure and β conformation of PFO from the solution to film, we explored the photophysical properties of the PFO films prepared using the drop-casting method from precursor solutions in Section 3.1.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films with different molecular weights were obtained and normalized at the highest point (Fig. 3a). Unlike the slight red-shift phenomenon in solutions, with the increase in molecular weight, the position of the first peak in the films presented a significant red-shift from 390 nm to 415 nm (M1 to M4) followed by a slight blue-shift to 408 nm (M5). In addition, the second peak did not appear at M1, but it could be obviously seen around 438 nm for M2 to M5, which was the characteristic of the β phase. The height of the β peaks increased gradually from M2 to M4 and decreased from M4 to M5. This apparent red-shift of the first peak in the spectra should be caused by increasing overlap of the α phase spectrum with the 0–1 band of the β phase spectrum in films.46 Therefore, the red-shift was more obvious with a stronger β signal. As shown in Fig. 3b, the content of β conformation was calculated based on the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 3a according to the previously reported calculation method.31,32,40 Similarly, with the increase in molecular weight, the β content increased from 0% to 41% (M1 to M4) and then decreased to 33% (M5).
 Fig. 3  (a) Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of PFO films with different molecular weights prepared using the drop-casting method. The concentration of precursor solution was 0.5 mg mL−1. (b) The contents of the β conformation calculated from the curve in (a). 
Raman spectroscopy is also an effective tool to probe the β conformation of polyfluorenes from the perspective of molecular vibration.20,47Fig. 4a shows the Raman spectra in the range of 1100–1700 cm−1 for PFO films with different molecular weights prepared using the drop-casting method. The most intense band was located at 1605 cm−1, which can be assigned to the phenyl ring CC stretch mode.48,49 The peak 1257 cm−1 is related to the bending vibration of the C–C bond connecting two benzene rings, which is sensitive to the torsion angle between adjacent repeating units. In order to evaluate the planarity of the PFO backbone, the Raman spectra were normalized at the highest point 1605 cm−1 (Fig. 4a). It has been reported that the Raman peak intensity ratio of I1257/I1605 can be used to qualitatively determine the flatness of the PFO backbone in films. The value of I1257/I1605 increases with the increase in the flattened β conformation content.47 As shown in Fig. 4b, the increase in the molecular weight was accompanied by an increase in the peak intensity ratio of PFO film at 1257 cm−1/1605 cm−1 from M1 to M4 but decreased from M4 to M5, indicating that the flatness of the PFO backbone and the content of β conformation increased firstly and then decreased.

In addition, α to β conformational transition of PFO leads to the perturbation of the electron-level transitions, which can be sensitively reflected in the fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 5). According to a related report,24 the typical emission peaks of α conformation in the PFO film were at about 430 nm, 450 nm, and 482 nm, corresponding to the 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 electron-level transitions of α conformation, respectively. The transition of α conformation to β conformation resulted in a red shift in the PL spectra. The three characteristic emission peaks of β confirmation at around 440 nm, 466 nm, and 499 nm16,17,50 corresponded to the electron-level transitions of 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, three characteristic emission peaks of the M1 film at 433 nm, 458 nm, and 488 nm, could be assigned to the amorphous α-conformation, which had a red-shift compared to the typical spectrum (430 nm, 450 nm, and 482 nm). This may be because the molecular chain of M1 is short and rigid, which is easy to form relatively compact aggregates during the drop-casting process.31 The more close arrangement of the molecular chain in the film induced strong π–π accumulation, resulting in a red shift compared to the typical spectrum. As the molecular weight increased (from M2 to M5), the content of β conformation increased. The 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 band emission peaks appeared at 440–442 nm, 463–465 nm, and 499 nm, respectively, which should be assigned to the emission peaks of β conformation (typically at 440 nm, 466 nm, and 499 nm). The relative intensity changes of 0–0 and 0–1 peaks in the fluorescence spectra could be used to reflect the change in the orderliness of PFO films.39 Because the presence of ordered structures allowed a strong 0–1 transition, a decrease in the value of PL0–0/PL0–1 represented an increase in PFO chain orderliness and β conformation content. As shown in Fig. 5b, the value of PL0–0/PL0–1 decreased firstly and then increased with the increase in the molecular weight from M2 to M5. These results indicated that the content of β conformation first increased and then decreased with the increase in molecular weight.

The results of UV-Vis absorption spectra, Raman spectra, and PL spectra proved that molecular weight can strongly affect the chain conformation and orderliness of PFO films in the drop-casting process. Some early researchers considered that a PFO molecule backbone could become planar to form the β conformation by the interaction between side chains and the backbone of another PFO molecule after overcoming the steric repulsion.51,52 However, in recent years, the formation of stable β conformation was found on isolated single PFO chains by single molecule spectroscopy,11,53 proving that a single chain can support the formation of β conformation and reversibly switch between α and β conformation. According to the above data and reports, we speculated that, as the molecular weight increases, the flexibility of molecules increases, which favors the self-fold of a PFO molecule for forming ordered structures. However, when the molecular weight exceeds the threshold, the entanglement of molecules dominates, inhibiting the orderly arrangement of molecules.
In this section, we systematically studied the influence of molecular weight on the chain-condensed state structure and β conformation of PFO films. However, the following information remains unclear. How does the chain length affect the formation of the β conformation in films? How do the molecular chains and ordered structure pack into the film? To solve these problems, we continued to study morphology and inner structure of the films in the following section.
3.3 Influence of molecular weight on the morphologies and inner structures of PFO films
To further explore the morphology and inner structure of PFO films, we conducted SEM, POM, and TEM studies. SEM was used to explore the surface morphology of the films (Fig. 6a–e). When the molecular weight was relatively low (M1), many small aggregates (less than 1 μm in diameter) were formed in the film. These aggregates were dispersed and did not contact each other. Then, as the molecular weight increased (M2, M3), larger spherical particles were formed, and the spherical particles contacted each other to form large aggregates. When the molecular weight increased to a certain extent (M4, M5), a large cross-linked aggregated structure was formed in the film. We speculate that the length and rigidity of chains play critical roles. Large aggregates and cross-linked aggregated structures are difficult to form in low molecular weight polymers because the single chains are short and rigid with no mutual entanglement and only π–π interaction between the chains. When the chain length increased, the flexibility of the single chain also increased, leading to the entanglement between different chains in the precursor solution. During the evaporation of the solvent, the entanglement of the polymer chains in the precursor solution was likely to be delivered to the films, forming large-volume aggregates and even cross-linked aggregated structures.

As mentioned above, the β conformation is highly planar, so the ordered β phase tends to form when the content of β conformation is high enough in PFO films. Polarized light microscopy (POM) is usually used to study the distribution of the ordered β phase in films.54Fig. 6f–j shows the POM images of PFO films with different molecular weights prepared using the drop-casting method. When the molecular weight was low (M1), no light can be detected in the areas, indicating that the molecular chains were arranged disorderly and no β phase was formed in the film. With the increase in the molecular weight (M2, M3), bright regions appeared. These regions were small in size and separated from each other, which indicated non-continuous and relatively dispersed β phases. For the films with molecular weight up to 93 kDa (M4), the area and brightness of the light regions were the largest, indicating continuous β phases and the highest content of β conformation. However, when the molecular weight increased to 117 kDa (M5), the area and brightness of the ordered regions decreased, indicating a decrease in the content of the β phase. The POM results proved that the continuous β phases with β conformation in films first increased and then decreased with the increase in molecular weight.
In order to explore the ordered structure of PFO films with different molecular weights, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) images were collected. As shown in Fig. 7a, diffuse electron diffraction rings are presented in the insert SAED image, which demonstrated that the M1 film is in an amorphous state, and no lattice fringes can be observed in HRTEM, indicating that no ordered β conformation was formed in the M1 film. As shown in Fig. 7b–e (M2 to M5), clear crystal diffraction spots in the SAED images and clearly-visible stripes in the HRTEM images proved the formation of an ordered structure (β conformation). Moreover, the area of the crystalline region increased with the increase in the molecular weight from M2 to M4. But when the molecular weight increased to M5, the crystalline region decreased. That is to say, when the molecular weight increased, the content of β conformation in the film increased first and then decreased, which is consistent with the previous experimental data.

3.4 Changes of the chain structure and β conformation in solution during the solvent volatilization process
During the formation of a film, the concentration of PFO increased gradually because of the evaporation of the precursor solvent. We simulated this process with a series of different concentrations of PFO solutions as well as naturally volatile concentrated solutions. To gain an in-depth understanding of the chain structure evolution and β conformation formation during this process, we performed dynamic/static light scattering and UV-Vis spectra studies. Given that the sample M4 can form β conformation easily and its β conformation content is the highest among the five samples, we used sample M4 in the following experiments. Firstly, we investigated the distribution of chain structures in THF at different PFO concentrations. Fig. 8a shows the normalized intensity correlation function curves of solutions with different concentrations at room temperature, which reflected the decay speed of the particle motion in the solution. As mentioned above, the Brownian motion of smaller particles is faster than that of bigger ones. With the increase of PFO concentration, the decay time became longer and longer, which proved that the moving volume of the particles became larger and larger. Fig. 8b shows the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) distribution of PFO according to Fig. 8a. When the concentration of the PFO solution was 0.05 mg mL−1, the signal intensity was too weak to calculate a reliable result. So, it was not displayed in Fig. 8b. Only one kind of particle (<10 nm) is presented in the PFO solution at a concentration of 0.3 mg mL−1, which can be assigned to the PFO single chains. When the concentration was increased to 1.0 mg mL−1, a small number of aggregates (size of 10 nm to 100 nm) appeared. Interestingly, the number of small aggregates (about 10 nm) decreased and the content of the large aggregates (around 100 nm) increased as the concentration increased to 10 mg mL−1. As the PFO concentration was further enhanced to 20 mg mL−1, the size of aggregates increased to about 300 nm. These results indicated that as the concentration of the PFO solution increased, the size of aggregates enhanced resulting from the increase in the collision probability and interaction between molecular chains. However, little is known about the internal structures of these aggregates. We conducted further research on static light scattering (SLS) and exponential law methods.

(b) Hydrodynamic radius distribution of sample M4 with different concentrations. (c) Plots of log I(q) versus q for the chain aggregations in PFO solution with different concentrations. The solid lines were linear fitted. (d) Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra with different volatilization times for sample M4. 
It is well known that SLS is widely used to study the self-similarity of polymer single chains and the fractal dimension of aggregates.36 The fractal dimension is related to the internal structure and chain density of aggregates, and the calculation method of fractal dimension (df) is described in the ESI† (Section S2). For aggregates with fractal structures, a high value of fractal dimension (df) indicates dense chain packing or aggregated morphology.55,56 In this work, we measured the linear relationship between the excess scattering intensity I(q) and the associated scattering vector q in PFO solutions of different concentrations (1.0 mg mL−1, 10 mg mL−1, 20 mg mL−1), and the fractal dimension was obtained. Because no aggregates can be detected in the PFO solution at concentrations of 0.05 mg mL−1 and 0.3 mg mL−1, their fractal dimension values cannot be measured. As shown in Fig. 8c, when the concentration increased from 1.0 mg mL−1 to 10 mg mL−1, the fractal dimension value also increased from 0.25 to 0.62, which indicated that the internal density of the aggregates enhanced. When the concentration increased to 20 mg mL−1, the fractal dimension almost did not change (df = 0.63), indicating that the internal compactness of chains was almost the same as that in 10 mg mL−1. To investigate the forming process of β conformation, we also collected the UV-Vis spectra of PFO solutions at different concentrations (Fig. S1, ESI†). We found that the PFO chains were all in α conformation without any β conformation. Combining the results of UV-Vis, DLS, and SLS, as the concentration gradually increased from 0.05 mg mL−1 to 20 mg mL−1, the single chains gradually transformed into larger aggregates without β conformation, and the inner density of the aggregates also increased. However, when the concentration was higher than 10 mg mL−1, the internal density of the aggregates remained unchanged even though the size of the aggregates increased.
To simulate the solvent evaporation process, we prepared a naturally volatilized solution with an open-to-air solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The solution was studied using the UV-Vis spectrophotometer every hour before the solvent was completely volatilized. As shown in Fig. 8d, β conformation did not appear until 8 hours. Though the content of β conformation increased with the naturally volatilized time, the total amount was still very low (<3%).
To further investigate the transition mechanism of chain conformation during the solvent volatilization process. A drop of high-concentration solution (10 mg mL−1 or 20 mg mL−1) was spread on the substrate and the corresponding UV-Vis spectra were collected every 30 seconds during the evaporation process. Fig. 9a shows the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the film with an initial concentration of 10 mg mL−1. Fig. 9b shows the corresponding relationship between the volatilization time and the β conformation contents, which were calculated from Fig. 9a. The exact values are summarized in the ESI,† shown in Table S1. As the solvent evaporated, the content of β conformation increased slowly from 0% to 4.5% (30 s). Then, it rapidly increased to 21.0% (60 s), and 29.0% (90 s). After most of the solvent was evaporated, the increasing rate slows down (120–240 s). Subsequently, the solvent was almost evaporated and the content reached a stable value of about 36.2% (240 s). According to these results, we assumed that a large amount of β conformation was formed at the later stage of the evaporation process rather than the earlier stage. When the initial concentration increased to 20 mg mL−1 (Fig. 9c and d), the contents of the β conformation were 8.6% (30s), 26.3% (60s), and 34.8% (90s), which were higher than that of the 10 mg mL−1 concentration at the corresponding time points. This indicated that the β conformation could be formed more rapidly when the initial concentration of the solution was higher. In addition, we found that the content of β conformation stabilized at about 37.2% after 180 s with an initial concentration of 20 mg mL−1, which was almost the same as that of 10 mg mL−1. Undoubtedly, the packing effect and the interchain interaction were stronger at a higher concentration. However, the films prepared using precursor solutions at the concentrations of 10 mg mL−1 and 20 mg mL−1 did not show obvious differences in the β conformation content. We infer that the interchain interaction between molecular chains may not be the main reason for the formation of β conformation. It is the intrachain interaction that enhances the formation of β conformation. That is to say, the self-folding of the PFO molecules plays a critical role in the formation of the order structure.
 Fig. 9  Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the film prepared by dropping the solution on the substrate. They were obtained at different evaporation times, and the initial concentration was 10 mg mL−1 (a) and 20 mg mL−1 (c). The relationship between the evaporation time and the contents of the β conformation was calculated from UV-Vis absorption spectra: 10 mg mL−1 (b) and 20 mg mL−1 (d). 
3.5 Mechanism of the transformation process of PFO chain structure and β conformation from the solution to film
To sum up, in the dilute THF precursor solution, the PFO single chains with different molecular weights were in rigid-rod form, all of which were in α conformation. The flexibility of a single chain increased gradually with the increase in molecular weight. During the initial solvent evaporation process, the PFO concentration increased, and larger aggregates were formed without the formation of β conformation (Fig. 8b and Fig. S1, ESI†). Besides, the concentration of the initial solution had little effect on the β conformation content of the final films (Fig. 9). This shows that the accumulation of molecular chains is not the main reason for the formation of β conformation. Currently, there are two main views on the formation of β conformation. In our previous study,31,32 we found that the self-folding of molecular chains of PFO in the solution was the main reason for the formation of β conformation, which was also supported by Cone's report from the aspect of molecular weight.46 Conversely, Nagai et al. found that the β conformation of polydiarylfluorene (PODPF, another type of polyfluorene) tended to be formed at lower molecular weight because of the interchain interaction.57 However, how does a high content of β conformation form in the drop-casted film of PFO?
Based on our results, a possible mechanism for the transformation process of the PFO chain structure and β conformation from the solution to the film is described in Fig. 10. Here, we speculated that the following three stages would occur during the formation of films. In the initial stage, solvent volatilization led to an increase in the concentration, collision probability, and interchain interactions between molecular chains. The concentrated solutions result in close intermolecular distances and large aggregates (Fig. 8b). The internal density of the aggregates increased with the increase in the PFO concentration. However, when the solution reached a certain concentration (>10 mg mL−1), the internal density of the aggregates remained unchanged (Fig. 8c). Due to the existence of the solvent molecules, the internal structure of the aggregation was relatively loose, so it was difficult to form the β conformation (Fig. 10a, d and g). In the second stage, the free solvent is further evaporated. The distance between different chains was further reduced, leading to an increase in the extrusion force. Subsequently, the molecular chain self-folds to form a relatively low-energy conformation. Thus, a small amount of β conformation was formed (<3%) except M1 with low molecular weight (Fig. 10b, e and h). During this process, the molecular chain of sample M1 was too short and rigid to self-fold for β conformation. Because of the remaining abundant solvent molecules, the internal structure of the aggregates was too loose to form a large amount of β conformation. In the final stage, free solvent molecules evaporated completely, and the bound solvent molecules on the surface and inside of the aggregates were further volatilized. The internal interaction of the molecular chain increased rapidly, resulting in a large amount of β conformation by self-folding (Fig. 9). The single chain with a small molecular weight (M1) was rigid and difficult to self-fold, so it was difficult to form β conformation (Fig. 10c). As the molecular weight increased (M2 to M4), the single-chain became longer and more flexible for self-folding, favoring the formation of β conformation (Fig. 10f). However, the molecular chain with high molecular weight (M5) was so long that it was easy to entangle with each other and hard to self-fold to form β conformation (Fig. 10i).

4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the influence of molecular weight on the transformation process of the chain condensed structure and β conformation from solution to films by the drop-casting method. Firstly, we obtained five samples with different Mw in the range of 25100 Da to 117000 Da by the precipitation fractionation method, which were named M1 to M5, respectively. In dilute THF solution, we found that the rigidity of the molecular chain decreased gradually with the increase in molecular weight in the form of α conformation. In films, the entanglement degree of molecular chains increased with the increase of molecular weight, but the content of β conformation and ordered structure in the films increased first (M1 to M4) and then decreased (M4 to M5). By studying the solvent evaporation process using a series of different concentrations of PFO solutions as well as naturally volatilized solutions, we found that the β conformation in the film was mainly formed by self-folding of the main chain during the transition process instead of simple interchain stacking. This study reveals the changing rules of the chain structure and β conformation of PFO from the solution to the film and its relationship with molecular weight, which provides theoretical and practical versions for in-depth understanding and controlling the formation of ordered structures in preparing high-efficiency films.
