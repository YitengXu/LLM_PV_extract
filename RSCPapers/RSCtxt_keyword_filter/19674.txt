    , Accepted 28th February 2019First published on 2nd March 2019AbstractThe introduction of polymer additives is a simple but effective method to achieve highly stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most polymer additives display the characteristic of being insulating, which will restrain the carrier transport in the perovskite light absorption layer and have a negative impact on the photoelectric performance of the devices. Hence, to address this issue, a new conductive polymer additive of polyaniline (PANI), which has special electrical and optical properties, was employed. Under the multiple effects of PANI, the quality of perovskite films was markedly enhanced, with outstanding crystalline structure, improved light absorption and uniform surface morphology, leading to faster PL quenching and charge transfer. As a result, the device with PANI exhibited a dramatically improved PCE from 16.96% (pristine) to 19.09% and reduced hysteresis behavior. The aging tests indicated that PANI perovskite devices show stronger humidity and heat stability, and they exhibited a larger water contact angle than the pristine perovskite. In particular, a PANI perovskite device maintained 86% of its initial PCE after aging under 50% RH for about 1600 h. Our results reveal that a suitable polymer additive displays a huge potential to improve the PCE and long-term stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have generated enormous interest because of their important optoelectronic properties and as they present great prospects for potential photovoltaic application.1–6 In particular, since Park and Grätzel et al. firstly reported all-solid-state PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 9% via using spiro-MeOTAD as a hole transport material (HTM) in 2012,7 the PCE of PSCs has been rapidly improved.8,9 Recently, PSCs have achieved a highest certified PCE of 23.3%.10
Although the PCE of PSCs has always been the focus of research workers, their instability in moist environments and at high temperature has become the more urgent problem to be solved.11–16 A lot of efforts and methods have been carried out to ameliorate the stability of PSCs, such as preparing new electron transporting materials (ETM),17–19 adding a hydrophobic passivation layer,20,21 introducing additives into the perovskite layer,22–24 and designing new-type highly stable perovskite materials.25,26 Among these improvements, the introduction of additives is the most effective and easiest way to enhance the humidity and heat resistance of PSCs.27–33
Polymer additives which have flexible long chains and abundant functional groups have been widely used in the fabrication process of PSCs.34–41 Zhao et al. reported polymer-scaffold PSCs by employing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) additive.34 The devices showed excellent humidity stability and self-healing properties owing to the hygroscopicity of the polymer molecules and the strong interaction with MAI. Xiang and co-workers synthesized a poly(dimethylsiloxane)-urea polymer and introduced it into a perovskite precursor solution.35 As a result, the hydrophobic polymer not only improved the film quality but also prevented moisture from eroding the perovskite. Sun et al. introduced a polyvinylidene fluoride–trifluoroethylene polymer additive into PbI2 solution to adjust the crystallization and morphology for high-performance devices.36 Other polymers such as polyvinylammonium,37 polyvinylalcohol38 and polyvinylpyrrolidone39 can also be used as additives to prepare PSCs with enhanced photoelectric performance. It can be concluded that polymer additives with different chemical properties bring about a great influence on the PCE and stability of PSCs. It remains a challenge to explore potential polymer candidates for high-efficiency devices with excellent humidity and heat stability.
The polymer polyaniline (PANI) is a type of polymer with unique electrochemical activity due to its conjugated structure of p electrons, which is commonly used as a hole transport material or sensitizer in PSCs and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).42–44 In this work, we prepared highly efficient and stable PSCs by adding a PANI polymer additive. The results indicate that the suitable PANI as an additive can make the perovskite film exhibit better crystalline structure, flat morphology, enhanced light absorption and charge transfer. A device with PANI showed a high PCE of 19.09% and negligible hysteresis behavior. In addition, due to the introduction of the PANI additive, the humidity and heat resistance of the perovskite film and device was prominently enhanced. As a result, the PANI0.10 perovskite film exhibited an increased water contact angle from 62.1° for a pristine perovskite film to 71.7°, and retained about 86% of its starting absorption intensity after 200 h of heat aging. The PANI0.10 perovskite device respectively maintained 86% and 81% of its initial PCE under about 50% RH for 1600 h and at 85 °C for 200 h.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a demonstrates the structure of a mesoscopic perovskite device with a configuration of FTO/compact TiO2 (bl-TiO2)/mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layer/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. PANI, a kind of high molecular weight polymer, was introduced into the perovskite layer as an additive, which has a coexisting structure with a different reduction unit and oxidation unit. With the different contents of the two structural units, PANI presents in different degree of redox states, and these can transform into each other. The structures of differently-oxidized states of PANI and the reversible transformations between them are depicted in Fig. 1b. Herein, the PANI added into the perovskite was in the emeraldine state at the beginning. PANI has special electrical and optical properties and can display different conductivity and electrochemical performance after protonic acid doping, light-induced doping, ion implantation doping or electrochemical doping.45–49 Hence, it has been widely researched and applied in the fields of coatings, batteries, absorbing materials, conductive fibers, sensors etc., because of its easy availability with a simple synthesis process, environmentally friendly raw materials and environmental stability. To investigate the effects of the PANI additive on the properties of the perovskite layer, 0 mg mL−1, 0.05 mg mL−1, 0.10 mg mL−1 and 0.15 mg mL−1 PANI were added into (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite precursor solutions, respectively. For simplicity, we name them as pristine, PANI0.05, PANI0.10 and PANI0.15, respectively.

Furthermore, to confirm the introduction of PANI into the perovskite layer, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Pb 4f, C 1s and N 1s for the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite films, shown in Fig. 1c–e. From Fig. 1c, it can be seen that the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks of the PANI0.10 perovskite film display a slight shift to lower binding energy, relative to those of the pristine film. In addition, in Fig. 1d and e, the C 1s and N 1s signals of the PANI0.10 perovskite film were significantly enhanced and shifted due to the introduction of PANI. These results clearly indicate the existence of PANI in the perovskite layers.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to explore the influence of different amounts of PANI on the crystalline properties, as shown in Fig. 2a. It can be observed that there are some peaks at about 14.15°, 20.06°, 24.64°, 28.38° and 31.82°, which are in line with the main diffraction peaks for the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite and belong to the (110), (112), (202), (220), and (310) crystal planes, respectively. However, in Fig. 2a, compared to the pristine perovskite film, the diffraction peak intensities of the perovskite films with different amounts of PANI are evidently enhanced, suggesting that the perovskite films can gain notably improved crystalline structure due to the addition of PANI. Furthermore, we have also given the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values for the (110) peaks of the pristine and perovskite films with different amounts of PANI in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be found that the FWHM values of the perovskites with PANI are smaller than that of the pristine film, and that the PANI0.10 perovskite film has the smallest FWHM value. It indicates that the perovskite films with PANI display more outstanding crystalline structure and that the PANI0.10 perovskite has preferentially orientated in the (110) direction.

Then, the optical properties of the perovskite films with different amounts of PANI were studied by UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Fig. 2b exhibits that the light absorbance of each of the perovskite films with PANI was stronger than that of the pristine film. This indicates that the addition of a moderate amount of PANI can enhance the optical absorption intensity. Among these different amounts of added PANI, the PANI0.10 perovskite film displayed the best light absorbance. Steady-state PL spectra of the pristine and perovskite films with different amounts of PANI on the TiO2 layer are shown in Fig. 2c. From Fig. 2c, it can be observed that the perovskite films with PANI showed quicker PL quenching, revealing that they present more excellent film quality with decreased defects and outstanding crystallinity. When the amount of added PANI was excessive, however, the PL strength of the perovskite film increased again. This is caused by the excess PANI remaining at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, which will reduce the crystallinity and increase defects.27,50
Generally, the photovoltaic performance is affected by the carrier transport and recombination lifetime.51 Therefore, we investigated the transient absorption (TA) response to detect the influence of different amounts of PANI on the internal carrier transport and recombination behavior of perovskite films. Here, TA was characterized in a 760 nm emission window and with 500 nm as the detecting light. The TA curves were fitted by using a single exponential decay function to quantify the characteristic parameters of carrier lifetimes, y = A1 × exp(−x/t1) + y0, and the t1 represents the fitted carrier lifetimes which were obtained and that are depicted in Fig. 2d–g. In general, for the perovskite films, a longer charge lifetime indicates a higher film quality with few internal defects and smooth surface morphology.52,53 From Fig. 2d–g, it can be clearly observed that the fitted charge lifetimes of pristine and perovskite films with different amounts of PANI were, respectively, 63.7, 76.3, 87.7 and 70.2 ns. The charge lifetimes of the perovskite films with PANI were improved, and the PANI0.10 perovskite film showed the longest fitted charge lifetime. Hence, the results reveal that perovskite film quality can be improved by introducing a suitable PANI additive, which favours the diffusion of electrons and holes.

Fig. 3 shows cross-sectional and top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pristine film and perovskite films with different amounts of PANI. It can be seen from Fig. 3a and b that the pristine perovskite film displayed a rough and non-uniform morphology with some holes on the surface, resulting in the quick electron hole recombination and low light absorption owing to the direct contact between the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer. However, when the PANI was added into the perovskite, the films became uniform and dense with high surface coverage and low roughness. When the concentration of PANI was 0.10 mg mL−1, the film displayed the optimal morphology. As shown in Fig. 3a and d, compared with the pristine film, the PANI0.10 film also exhibited a more flat and regular cross-sectional morphology. When PANI was over-added, because the excess PANI is retained at the perovskite grain boundaries, some small grains stacked at random in the surface of the film. In addition, AFM images of the pristine and perovskite films with different amounts of PANI are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The surface roughness of the pristine, PANI0.05, PANI0.10 and PANI0.15 perovskite films was, respectively, 26.9, 19.8, 18.8 and 21.2 nm; the PANI0.10 film displayed markedly lower surface roughness than the other films, further indicating its smoother and preferable surface coverage.

We tested the current–voltage (J–V) curves of pristine devices and perovskite devices with different amounts of PANI to probe the impact of PANI on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. J–V curves are exhibited in Fig. 4a and the detailed data are demonstrated in Table S1 (ESI†). The pristine device showed a Jsc of 22.10 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.06 V, an FF of 72.37% and a PCE of 16.96%. When the PANI was added, the performance of the perovskite devices was significantly enhanced. Finally, we acquired the optimized device based on the PANI0.10 perovskite with a Jsc of 22.50 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V, an FF of 77.13% and the highest PCE up to 19.09%. The prominently improved PCE is attributable to the enhancement of Jsc, Voc and FF which are caused by enhanced light absorption, faster charge transfer and more even film morphology. However, if excessive PANI is added, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs will decrease due to poorer film quality and light absorbance.

(c) IPCE spectra, (d) PCE histograms fitted with a Gaussian distribution and (e) Jsc, Voc and FF distributions of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices. 
To evaluate the hysteresis behavior of the PANI0.10 PSCs, we measured the typical J–V curves of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices under reverse and forward scan directions, which are depicted in Fig. 4b. The PCE values of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices were 16.96% and 19.09%, respectively, at the reverse scan direction, and 15.31% and 18.48% at the forward scan direction. The corresponding Jsc, Voc and FF are displayed in Table S2 (ESI†). The PANI0.10 device did not exhibit remarkable J–V hysteresis, and the corresponding hysteresis index decreased from 9.7% (pristine) to 3.2% (PANI0.10). As shown in Fig. 4c, we examined the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices. Compared to the pristine device, the PANI0.10 perovskite device displayed a stronger spectral response from about 350 to 750 nm, meaning a higher efficiency in converting incident photons to electric current which directly reflects the higher Jsc. From the IPCE spectra, the integrated Jsc values of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices were 21.96 and 22.14 mA cm−2, which conform to the values of 22.10 and 22.50 mA cm−2 gained from the J–V curves.

Fig. 4d presents the PCE distributions of pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices among 30 PSCs. It can be found that the PCE distribution of the PANI0.10 perovskite devices is more concentrated, representing enhanced PCE reproducibility. In addition, the PANI0.10 PSCs have a higher average PCE (18.56%) than the pristine devices (16.27%). The corresponding Jsc, Voc and FF distributions of the pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite devices are also displayed in Fig. 4e. In comparison to the pristine perovskite devices, the PANI0.10 perovskite devices show markedly improved Voc and FF owing to the faster charge transfer and more even film morphology of the PANI0.10 perovskite film. The average Jsc, Voc and FF of the PANI0.10 perovskite devices increased from 22.09 to 22.37 mA cm−2, 1.05 to 1.10 V and 70.77% to 75.66%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Jsc, Voc and FF of the PANI0.10 perovskite devices also exhibited significantly more compact distributions, revealing the better reproducibility of photovoltaic parameters for the PANI0.10 perovskite devices. The results demonstrate that the introduction of a moderate amount of PANI can improve the PCE and reproducibility of PSCs.
Besides obtaining high photovoltaic performance, PSCs need to exhibit significantly improved long-term stability to achieve practical application. Therefore, we carried out humidity and heat stability tests of films and devices of pristine perovskite and those with different amounts of PANI. Fig. 5a exhibits the normalized PCE variation curves of pristine and PANI perovskite devices without any encapsulation under about 50% RH. The PCE of the unsealed pristine device declined to about 20% of its original value following rapid degradation after a 1600 h humidity aging test. In contrast, under the same test conditions, the perovskite devices with PANI all displayed slow degradation and retained about 80% of their initial PCE within the 1600 h aging time. In particular, the PANI0.10 perovskite device retained 86% of its original PCE after 1600 h under 50% RH. These humidity stability tests reveal that the PANI perovskite devices exhibited higher moisture resistance than the pristine device.

(b) Normalized PCE variations of PANI0.10 perovskite devices under about 25%, 50% and 75% RH. (c) The water contact angles of pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite films.

(e) UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine and PANI0.10 perovskite films before and after exposure to 85 °C. 
We also tested the humidity stability of PANI0.10 perovskite devices under different humidity conditions. Fig. 5b presents the normalized PCE variation of PANI0.10 perovskite devices under about 25%, 50% and 75% RH. The results show that the PCE of the PANI0.10 perovskite devices decreased more and more obviously with the increase of humidity, although they could still maintain about 70% of their initial PCE after 1600 h under 75% RH, revealing the high humidity stability of the PANI0.10 perovskite devices. Furthermore, we performed a contact angle test with deionized water, as depicted in Fig. 5c and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The water contact angle of the PANI0.10 perovskite film was 71.7°, larger than that of the pristine film (62.1°). The enhanced water contact angle reveals that the introduction of PANI can notably enhance the water-resistance ability of perovskite films and enhance the humidity stability of PSCs.
We also investigated the heat aging of a pristine device and perovskite devices with different amounts of PANI at 85 °C. From Fig. 5d, it can be clearly seen that the pristine perovskite device decreased by 50% of its starting PCE, while the PANI-containing devices maintained 75%, 81% and 73% of their initial PCE after 200 h at the same high temperature conditions, respectively. In addition, we also measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine and PANI perovskite films before and after exposure to 85 °C to evaluate their heat stability. As displayed in Fig. 5e and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the pristine perovskite film suffered from a serious degradation and retained only about 30% of the initial absorption intensity after 200 h at 85 °C, owing to the decomposition of the perovskite layer. However, the PANI0.10 perovskite film displayed relatively slow degradation and retained about 86% of its starting absorption intensity. The results are consistent with their PCE variation and indicate that the addition of PANI is conducive to the improvement of heat stability.
It can be clearly observed from the above results that the introduction of PANI improves the quality of perovskite films and makes the perovskite devices obtain more outstanding photovoltaic performance and higher stability relative to pristine devices. As shown in Fig. 6, we suggest a possible mechanism. The features of polymers and the unique properties of PANI have very important effects on the quality of the perovskite films. Firstly, PANI, as a polymer additive, plays the same roles as other polymer additives, such as hydrophobicity, passivation and the connecting effect of its carbochain backbone and so on.36–41 Secondly, PANI itself presents special electrical and optical properties, and it will display high conductivity and electrochemical performance after doping. Herein, there are a large number of –NH2+– groups or –NH+– groups in the PANI chain. The –NH2+– groups or –NH+– groups with positive charge can interact with I− in perovskite and form ionic bonds with the negative charge of I−. Then, the PANI will interact with the perovskite and be evenly distributed around the perovskite, or on the interface between the perovskite and the electron transport layer or hole transport layer, which is advantageous to the transport of electrons and holes due to the high conductivity of PANI. Thirdly, as shown in Fig. 1b, PANI has many different oxidation states and can be continuously transformed. The different oxidation states of PANI will have different effects on the performance of perovskite. Therefore, due to the above multiple effects of PANI, the perovskite films and devices not only have superior PCE but also markedly improved humidity and heat stability.

Conclusion
In summary, we have applied a simple and convenient method to prepare PSCs with high PCE and long-term stability under high humidity and temperature environments via adding PANI as an additive. Owing to the multiple effects of PANI, the resulting perovskite films have great crystalline structure, smooth surface morphology, high light absorption and enhanced charge transfer, resulting in a significantly improved PCE of 19.09% and better moisture and heat resistance; 86% and 81% of the initial PCE could be retained under 50% RH for 1600 h and at 85 °C for 200 h, respectively. These findings indicate that the introduction of a suitable polymer additive can be used to acquire highly efficient and stable perovskite devices.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
All reagents/chemicals were purchased from TCI and used directly without further purification. The PANI we used is emeraldine state which was purchased directly without further treatment. Etched glass substrates coated with FTO were cleaned using an ultrasonic method with detergent, ultrapure water and ethanol for 30 min, respectively. They were then washed 2–3 times with ultrapure water and ethanol and sintered at 510 °C for 30 min. At 430 °C, a compact TiO2 layer was coated on the substrates using spray pyrolysis. The compact TiO2 solution included 7 mL of isopropanol, 0.6 mL of titanium diisopropoxide and 0.4 mL of bis(acetylacetonate). By spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the compact TiO2 layer. A TiO2 Dyesol paste of 30 nm was thinned using 5.5 times ethanol. Next, the mesoporous TiO2 layer was annealed at 510 °C for 30 min. 1.35 M perovskite precursor solutions were composed of the stoichiometrically corresponding perovskite components of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 in mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 4:1. (Herein, to form better perovskite films and facilitate the formation of perovskite, 1.05 times of PbI2 was added into the precursor solutions.) The perovskite solutions were heated and mixed at 50 °C for 2 h before use. Then, in an air-flowing glovebox where humidity was kept at 20–30% RH, the perovskite layer was spin-coated on the substrates at firstly 1100 rpm for 11 s, and secondly 4600 rpm for 36 s. During the spin coating step 15 s before the end of the procedure, chlorobenzene (anti-solvent) was dropwise added on the perovskite layer. Then, the perovskite layer was annealed at 105 °C for about 1 h. A HTL solution, which was gained by successively dissolving 73.5 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 18 μL of Li+ salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide) and 8 μL of cobalt(III) salt (tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-(tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tri(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)]) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated on the light absorption layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Lastly, a 60 nm-thick gold electrode was thermally evaporated onto the HTL.
Characterization
A Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi system was used to collect XPS data. XRD patterns with a 2θ range from 5° to 60° were collected on a Smartlab 9 kW. UV-vis absorption spectra with a wavelength from 300 nm to 850 nm were measured using an ultraviolet-vis spectrophotometer (U-3900H, HITACHI, Japan). A spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) was employed to measure steady-state PL spectra with a test range from 660 nm to 860 nm, which were analyzed using the software Fluorescence. The samples were excited using an excitation wavelength of 473 nm, which was from a standard 450 W xenon CW lamp. By using a probe light of 760 nm and a laser light of 500 nm, transient absorption (TA) responses were measured (LKS, Applied Photophysics Ltd); the laser energy was 150 μJ cm−2 and the repetition rate was 5 Hz. A high-resolution FE-SEM (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland) was employed to record the film morphology. A solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) which maintained a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm−2 illumination AM 1.5G, calibrated by a certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) before the measurements, was used to obtain J–V curves. All devices retained an active area of 0.09 cm2 by covering a black mask. In DC mode with no bias light used, the IPCE spectra with a wavelength range of 300–900 nm were collected using a dual Xenon/quartz halogen light source (PV Measurements, Inc.). The humidity stability tests were carried out in different containers with 25%, 50% and 75% RH respectively, which were kept at ambient temperature in the dark. The heat stability test was carried out in a container with a high temperature of 85 °C which maintained 10–20% RH in the dark.
