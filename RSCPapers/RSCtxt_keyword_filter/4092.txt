    , Accepted 23rd June 2022First published on 29th June 2022AbstractThe substitution of the toxic element lead in metal halide hybrid perovskites has been receiving tremendous consideration because poor stability and high toxicity are two of the main issues hampering their further uses. Recently, lead-free bimetallic hybrid double perovskites (BHDPs) have shown various environmental and structure–property advantages over the pristine APbX3 compounds. However, the number of synthesized BHDPs is quite limited and the exploration of their physicochemical properties is still in a very early stage. Herein, two new centimetric BHDPs, namely (H2EPZ)2[BiAgBr8] (ABB-1) and (H2MPA)2[BiAgBr8] (ABB-2), are quasi-two-dimensional with a unique Dion–Jacobson structure, in which the cyclic diammonium cations (1-ethylpiperazinium = H2EPZ and 1-methylpiperidinium-4-amine = H2MPA) are separated by [BiAgBr8]n4n− layers. Interestingly, in addition to strong photocurrent response (the ratio of Ilight/Idark reaches 95 and 89 for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively) and bluish-white broadband emission, ABB-1 and ABB-2 showed efficiently enhanced proton conductivity of ∼9 × 10−4 S cm−1 dependent on temperature and humidity change. This is by far the best BHDP conductive material. Adequate surface coverage thin films of both compounds can be facilely prepared. Moreover, these films are highly stable. The morphologies of these films remain unchanged for a record of 90 days at a relatively high RH of 55%, which paves the way for optoelectronic applications.
Despite three-dimensional (3D) lead halide hybrid perovskites APbX3 (where A is methylammonium or formamidinium and X is a halogen) having received tremendous interest due to their low cost, simple preparation and outstanding optoelectronic conversion performance,1–5 the high toxicity and leakage of Pb2+ as well the instability under water and sunlight represent major drawbacks for these materials.6–11 Those concerns have led scientists to find stable and environmentally friendly metals as a substitute for lead. First of all, divalent non-toxic metal ions such as Sn2+, Ge2+ and Mg2+ were chosen, but these cations are more labile under ambient conditions.12–14 To resolve this issue, a combination between trivalent and monovalent metal cations has become a new pathway to replace Pb2+. Indeed, two metal cations combine to produce an ‘average’ charge similar to traditional perovskites (2MII = MI + MIII) giving rise to the so-called double perovskite materials. During the last few years, several inorganic double perovskites (IDPs) have been synthesized and studied such as Cs2PtI6, Cs2PdBr6, Cs2AgBiBr6, etc.15–17 These compounds showed promising properties and high stability against environmental decomposition. Recently, Cs2TiBr6 has presented a major breakthrough for these kinds of materials; its power conversion efficiency applied in solar cells is found to be 3.3% which represents a new record in photovoltaic devices.18 Despite this great advancement, IDPs still suffer from indirect and broad band gaps, limiting their further applications.
On the other hand, if the inorganic cations are replaced by organic components, the result is a new material family named bimetallic hybrid double perovskites (BHDPs). Lately, BHDPs have received much attention due to their structural tunability and adaptability to thin films.19–21 Moreover, they show high stability against temperature and moisture comparing to APbX3 and band gap tunability, rendering them suitable for further applications.22–24 In 2016, Cheetham et al. synthesized the first BHDPs, namely (CH3NH3)2KBiCl6, which shows an indirect band gap of 3.02 eV.25 Interestingly, this BHDP exhibits structural similarities to the lead chloride analogue APbCl3 (A = methylammonium), but with much higher thermal stability. Thereafter, several BHDPs compounds such as (APP)4[BiAgI8]·H2O, (AMP)4[BiAgI8]2·H2O (AMP = 4-aminomethylpiperidinium and APP = 4-aminopiperidinium), (C6H16N2)2AgBiI8·H2O, (C6H16N2)2CuBiI8·H2O, etc., have been recently reported.22–28 Despite the efforts that have been made, the number of synthesized BHDPs is quite limited compared to hybrid single-metal counterparts. Furthermore, their physicochemical properties such as the origin of their band gaps, luminescence and conductivity are still not fully understood and their exploration is in a very early stage. Therefore, new BHDPs are very highly desired.
In our ongoing studies, we succeeded in preparing two new 2D lead-free BHDPs, namely (H2EPZ)2[BiAgBr8] (ABB-1) and (H2MPA)2[BiAgBr8] (ABB-2), with Dion-Jacobson type of structure. Both hybrid double perovskites present semiconducting properties (the band gap is ca. 2.77 eV for ABB-1 and 2.84 eV for ABB-2) and strong photocurrent responses (the ratio of Ilight/Idark is 95 and 89 for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively). Interestingly, both compounds show high proton conductivity of ∼9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 95 °C and 95% relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, ABB-1 and ABB-2 can be easily coated as high-coverage thin films by the spin coating technique and show high stability against moisture and heat, rendering them with potential for applications.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural descriptions
Single crystals of ABB-1 and ABB-2 with largest size reaching the centimetre level were grown through the hydrothermal procedure, in which stoichiometric amounts of Bi2O3, Ag2O, and EPZ or AMP in a concentrated hydrobromic acid solution were added and the mixture was kept at 120 °C for six hours (see “Experimental” section for more details). EDS analysis matched very well with crystal structure (see below) and revealed the presence of Ag/Bi/Br element ratio of 1.05/0.88/8.05 for ABB-1 and 1.04/0.94/8.01 for ABB-2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). SC-XRD measurement disclosed that ABB-1 belongs to the monoclinic crystal system with centrosymmetric P21/c space group (Table S1, ESI†). The asymmetric unit is composed of one protonated organic cation, Bi(III) and Ag(I) cations and four bromide anions (Fig. S2a, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1(a–c), the crystal structure formed by 2D [AgBiBr8]4n− double perovskite alternates by 1-ethylpiperzinium cations. Indeed, the inorganic [AgBiBr8]4n− layers are assembled through Ag–Br–Bi bridges to form corner-sharing [BiBr6] and [AgBr6] octahedra. Each Bi3+ cation is surrounded by six bromides with Bi–Br bond distances varying in the range of 2.857(12)–2.866(13) Å and the Breq–Bi–Breq (‘eq’ means equatorial) angle varying from 85.19(4)° to 94.81(4)°. Interestingly, the Brax–Bi–Brax (‘ax’ means axial) angle is exactly 180° (Table S2, ESI†). Thus, [BiBr6] exhibits a nearly regular octahedral geometry. On the other hand, the [AgBr6] octahedron is much more distorted than the [BiBr6] one. The Ag–Br interactions range from 2.503(14) to 3.462(15) Å. While Br–Ag–Br angles range from 85.75(3)° to 180(4)°. Such distorted AgI octahedra are frequently found in many other hybrid double perovskite compounds.22,24

The distortion index (Δd) of the [BiBr6] and [AgBr6] octahedra can be quantitatively calculated using the following equation:Δd = (1/6)∑[dn − d/d]where d refers the average distance of M–Br (M = Bi or Ag) bonds and dn is the individual bond length of Bi–Br and Ag–Br. As shown in Table 1, [BiBr6] exhibits a slightly distorted octahedron, while [AgBr6] is much more distorted to form regular octahedral coordination with bromide anions. Thus, the ratio of Δd[AgBr6]/Δd[BiBr6] is 6.27. Moreover, the closest Br⋯Br distance is 3.874 Å, which is proposed to play an essential role in stabilizing this 2D Dion–Jacobson hybrid double perovskite phase.

On the other hand, ABB-2 crystallizes in the monoclinic P2/n space group with the point of 2/m (Table S1, ESI†). The asymmetric unit contains one protonated organic cation, one Bi(III) ion, one Ag(I) ion and four bromide anions (Fig. S2b, ESI†). As seen in Fig. 1(d–f), the crystal structure shows monolayer perovskite with an ordered arrangement of [AgBiBr8]4n− separated by organic cations. The Bi–Br bond lengths are in the range of 2.829(8)–2.892(8) Å, indicating almost undistorted [BiBr6] octahedra. In the [AgBr6] octahedron, the lengths of the two apical Ag–Brax bonds (2.540(9) Å) are much shorter than the other four Ag–Br distances (3.230(6)–3.471(1) Å) within the layer. Whereas Br–Bi–Br and Br–Ag–Br angles range from 85.52(4)° to 175.36 (3)° and from 96.25(3)° to 160.17(6)° (Table S3, ESI†).The distortion degree was also calculated for ABB-2, which shows a regular [BiBr6] (Δd = 0.008) and a distorted [AgBr6] octahedron (Δd = 0.116), indicative of ∼14 times difference between AgI and BiIII sites (Table 1). ABB-2 exhibits Br⋯Br separation (3.681 Å), which is slightly smaller than that in ABB-1.
The two organic cations show regular configuration with C–C and C–N varying from 1.513(8) Å to 1.543(4) Å and from 1.468(1) Å to 1.531(8) Å, respectively. Whereas C–C–C and C–N–C angles range between 108.79(6)° and 113.12(7)° (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). Moreover, Tables S4 and S5 in ESI† show several intermolecular interaction contacts of N–H⋯Br and C–H⋯Br types ranging from 121.25° to 174.21° and from 116.93° to 159.32°, respectively. To summarize the structural description part, we compared ABB-1 and ABB-2 to other previously published 2D hybrid double perovskite structures (Table S6, ESI†), and we found that the MI centres adopt highly distorted six-fold coordination compared with MIII ones while still preserving the double perovskite structure. Moreover, as deduced from Table S6 (ESI†), the organic cation templates have a minor effect to adjust the distortion in 2D hybrid double perovskite structure.

Hirshfeld surface analyses. 
Crystal Explorer is an important tool in order to get better knowledge and gain additional insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions and their quantitative contribution in the crystal structures of ABB-1 and ABB-2, through Hirshfeld surfaces and 2D fingerprint.29 As shown in Fig. S4(a and b) in ESI†, the 3D view of Hirshfeld surface for ABB-1 and ABB-2 is mapped with dnorm and highlighted in red circular spot, blue and white areas represent the shorter, longer and around intermolecular contacts than van der Waals separation respectively. Moreover, 2D fingerprint is a powerful tool to provide quantitative contribution of the intermolecular contacts within ABB-1 and ABB-2 and is also displayed. Indeed, 2D fingerprint is formed by the combination of the distance from the Hirshfeld surface to the nearest nucleus outside the surface (de) and inside the surface (di). As shown in Fig. S5(a–d) in the ESI,† two principal spikes covered the main regions in the total 2D fingerprint and identified as red spots in the 3D Hirshfeld surface are from H⋯Br (appeared like two wings of a bird) and from H⋯H (emerged in the middle areas). These results are consistent with observation from single crystal XRD (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†), suggesting that hydrogen bonding plays a dominant role in structure stabilization. Beside the above-mentioned contacts, other weak interactions observed in 2D fingerprint maps are from Ag⋯Br, Bi⋯Br and Br⋯Br.


Thin-film morphology. 
The two 2D hybrid double perovskites can grow into thin films on glass/ITO substrates. More details can be found in the ESI.† Briefly, 0.2 g of ABB-1 or ABB-2 was dissolved in DMSO and thereafter annealed at 80 °C and cooled to room temperature. Thin-film XRD patterns presented in Fig. S6a and S7a in the ESI† revealed the formation of highly oriented crystalline phases. Compared to ABB-1, thin-film XRD analysis for ABB-2 shows principal reflection plane (002), suggesting that crystalline phases are growing vertically to the substrate. An identical behavior has also been reported for other lead-free 2D perovskites.19–21 As observed from scanning microscopy images presented in Fig. 2(a and c), the two resulting thin films have similar texture; ABB-1- and ABB-2-based thin films are of high coverage, smooth and with very few pin holes, indicating their excellent stability. Moreover, they showed a flat covered grey surface with some valleys, due to the effect of solvent evaporation. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. S6(b–j) and S7(b–j) in ESI,† the elemental mapping of ABB-1 and ABB-2 films shows that Ag, Bi, I, C and N are uniform and homogeneously distributed. Herein, the cross-sectional images revealed that thin films of both ABB-1 and ABB-2 have thicknesses of 300 nm and 250 nm, respectively (Fig. 2(b and d)).

Optical properties and band structure calculations. 
Using polycrystalline powder, the diffuse reflectance data were transformed to pseudo absorption through the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R) = α/S = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R is the reflectance, α is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient) to provide band gap energy.30,31 As shown in Fig. 3a, the absorption edges of ABB-1 and ABB-2 were found to be located at 447 nm and 460 nm, respectively. The band gaps were determined using both direct and indirect fitting scenarios, as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S8, ESI.† The direct/indirect gaps of ABB-1 and ABB-2 are obtained as 2.84 eV/2.69 eV and 2.77 eV/2.65 eV, respectively, corresponding to their yellow color. The band gap of ABB-2 is slightly smaller than that of ABB-1, which is probably due to its distorted structure (see Table 1). Moreover, the order of their band gaps is well consistent with their Ag–Br–Bi bond angles in which the smallest angle correlates to the lowest band gap. This trend was also checked with DFT calculations (vide infra). In addition, the small difference between ABB-1 and ABB-2 band gaps indicates the minimal effect of organic cations on the band gap energy. Remarkably, band gaps were also determined for ABB-1 and ABB-2 thin films (Fig. 3d). We notice that their band gaps (2.88 eV for ABB-1 and 2.83 eV for ABB-2) are only slightly higher than those of the powders due to quantum confinement effect.32 Strikingly, these two BHDPs could be coupled with silicon as has been recently proved for CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite (Eg ∼ 2.3 eV), which is used as an absorber for a tandem solar cell.33

(b and e) The band structure of (b) ABB-1 and (e) ABB-2 without SOC and corresponding PDOS. (c and f) The band structure of (c) ABB-1 and (f) ABB-2 with SOC. 
To get knowledge about the nature of optical band edge, as well as to complement our experimental results, we performed theoretical calculations using first principles simulation via CASTEP code executed in the Material Studio 2019 package. We implemented our DFT calculations using GGA-PBE exchange–correlation functional with and without spin orbital coupling (SOC) self-consistently (more information can be found in the ESI†). In general, these theoretical calculations fitted very well with the experimental results: the theoretical band gap of single-layered ABB-2 was slightly smaller than that of ABB-1 which matches perfectly with the experiment. Moreover, we found that SOC has a remarkable impact on the band gap, particularly in the conduction band. Indeed, without SOC, the calculated band gaps of ABB-1 and ABB-2 were 2.82 eV and 2.63 eV, respectively, which are similar to experimental findings (Fig. 3(b and e)). Conduction band maximum (CBM) and valence band minimum (VBM) are pointing at different Z and G points which are reminiscent of their indirect band gaps. However, including SOC, the band structures of ABB-1 and ABB-2 turned from indirect to direct type: both CBM and VBM are located at the same point Z. As shown in Fig. 3(c and f), the band gaps were 2.11 eV for ABB-1 and 1.91 eV for ABB-2. Concerning partial density of states (PDOS) presented in Fig. S9 and S10 in ESI,† CBM is dominated by Bi-6p, Br-4p and small contribution of Ag-5s states, whereas VBM consists mostly of Ag-4d and Br-4p states. Hence, the band gaps are mainly originated from the inorganic frameworks. As deduced from experimental results (see above), DFT calculation proved also the limited effect of the organic part. The composition of band gaps for CBM and VBM was identical to that of other reported 2D bromide double perovskite compounds.27,34


Luminescence properties. 
Under excitation at 365 nm, both ABB-1 and ABB-2 exhibit a weak broadband emission peaking at 485 nm (2.55 eV) and 495 nm (2.5 eV), respectively (Fig. 4(a and b)). Such peaking points are well consistent with their wide band gaps obtained from the UV-visible results. This broadband emission for ABB-1 and ABB-2 is further consistent with the emission reported for inorganic metal halides such as Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6.35,36 Moreover, several 2D hybrid double perovskites with weak emission at room temperature have been also reported.22–24,37,38 Kanatzidis et al. found that (4AMP)2AgBiI8 and (3AMPY)2AgBiI8 (where AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium and AMPY = (aminomethyl)pyridinium) exhibit very weak emission between 640 nm and 650 nm at ambient temperature.37 Weak photoluminescence (PL) is observed also for the layered (PEA)4AgBiBr8 (PEA = phenethylammonium) with a large Stokes shift (250 meV).38 Herein, the broadband emission of ABB-1 and ABB-2 gives rise to the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates of (0.25, 0.33) and (0.25, 0.36), respectively. This is a bluish-white color. Note that the emissions of ABB-1 and ABB-2 thin films are too weak to be observed. We also measured the decay lifetime for both ABB-1 and ABB-2 at room temperature. The time-resolved PL decay monitoring at 485 nm and 495 nm was fitted with a double exponential function (I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where I represents the luminescence intensity, t is the time after excitation, A is a constant and τ is the lifetime) and showed an average lifetime of 3.83 ns and 4.15 ns for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively (Fig. 4(c and d)).

Photoelectric properties. 
To further understand the semiconducting properties of ABB-1 and ABB-2, two-terminal detectors based on pressed pellet samples were measured under 350 W xenon lamp irradiation (Table 2). At positive voltage (7 V), the dark current was 1.6 × 10−10 A and 1.8 × 10−10 A for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively. Such a low dark current will play an important role in significantly enhancing photo-detectivity. Under illumination, the current was markedly enhanced to 1.5 × 10−8 A for ABB-1 and to 1.6 × 10−8 A for ABB-2, showing a ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 95 and 89 for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively (Fig. S11(a and b), ESI†). We need to mention that the order of photocurrent for both compounds is well consistent with their band gaps, indicating that a narrower optical band gap will lead to better current. A similar trend is also observed in other lead-free hybrid materials.39 Furthermore, we evaluated the stability of both materials toward light: after several cycles of switching the light on/off at 7 V, no remarkable attenuation was detected for ABB-1 and ABB-2, proving the reproducibility and high stability of both hybrid double perovskite structures (Fig. S11(c and d), ESI†). As shown in Table S7 in ESI,†ABB-1 and ABB-2 exhibited efficient photocurrent responses surpassing or matching well with many halide hybrid perovskites indicating the semiconductor nature of these two BHDPs and their potential for photodetector devices.

Stability studies. 
Herein, we studied the stability of ABB-1 and ABB-2 thin films continuously for three months in the dark at 55% RH. As shown in Fig. S12(a and b) in ESI,† we recorded a slight decrease of intensity of XRD peaks for thin films of ABB-2 after 90 days storage at 55% RH. However, for ABB-1 film, we notice that (0−11), (−102) and (−404) peaks become very weak and broad. Despite these two points, XRD patterns of films of ABB-1 and ABB-2 are almost identical to those of freshly prepared samples and did not show additional reflection related to decomposition. In contrast, MAPbI3 thin film is totally transformed to PbI2 after 40 days at 52% RH.40 To the best of our knowledge, ABB-1 and ABB-2 were within the range of long-term stability against moisture for non-toxic bimetallic double inorganic/hybrid perovskite compounds reported to date (see Fig. S13 and Table S8, ESI†). Furthermore, we examined the thermal stability of ABB-1 and ABB-2 powders through thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) between 30 and 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S14(a and b), ESI†). It seems very clear from the TGA curves that these two hybrid double perovskite compounds are stable against mass loss up to 260 °C. In the second place, we examined the PXRD patterns of ABB-1 and ABB-2 powder samples after heating at 70 °C in air for 2 h, 6 h and 12 h (Fig. S15(a and b), ESI†). We noted that both BHDPs exhibit high thermal stability confirming their structural integrity. Hence ABB-1 and ABB-2 show high stability toward moisture and heat.


Proton conduction. 
The proton conductivity of ABB-1 and ABB-2 was measured using compacted pellets of powder samples under various RHs and temperatures. First, we measured the humidity-dependent proton conductivities under various RHs (between 50% and 95%) at 40 °C. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, the Nyquist plots of ABB-1 and ABB-2 showed identical characteristics with semicircles in the high-frequency region and inclined tails at low frequency, suggesting the blocking of protons at silver electrodes.41 Indeed, the proton conductivity of ABB-1 increased considerably and reached 1.01 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 40 °C and 95% RH; while the proton conductivity of ABB-2 increased to 8.09 × 10−7 S cm−1 under the same conditions. As the RH increased, the number of guest water molecules adsorbed by ABB-1 and ABB-2 increased leading to the formation of more proton carriers. Therefore, the proton conductivity of both compounds was enhanced.

To further understand the RH-dependent proton conductivity, we measured the water vapor adsorption of ABB-1 and ABB-2 at room temperature and at different RHs using an Intelligent Gravimetric Sorption Analyzer (IGA 100B). At 298 K, ABB-1 exhibited rapid water vapor adsorption and reached 10.44 g cm−3 at P/P0 = 1, while ABB-2 exhibited much higher water vapor adsorption of 14616 g cm−3 at RH = 100% (Fig. S16, ESI†). As inferred from those results, ABB-2 is more hydrophilic than ABB-1. Hence, RH is suggested to play an important role in constructing a continuous hydrogen bonding transport pathway, thus contributing to increasing the proton conductivity. It should be mentioned that, despite ABB-1 and ABB-2 having non-porous structures, they exhibit water storage, which might be due to the plenty of small interstices generated in the powder samples. Moreover, the temperature-dependent Nyquist diagrams of ABB-1 and ABB-2 were obtained between 50 and 95 °C at 95% RH. As depicted in Fig. 5b and d, with temperature increasing, the proton conductivity gradually rose from 3.01 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 323 K to 7.96 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 368 K and from 1.12 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 323 K to 9.83 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 368 K for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively. Indeed, as the temperature increases, the movement of protons is accelerated, thereby enhancing the proton conductivity. Thus, at 95 °C and 95% RH, the proton conductivity of ABB-1 and ABB-2 is maximized, up to 7.96 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 9.83 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, which represent the best values for lead-free proton-conductive BHDPs and approaching those for MOF and POM counterparts (Table S9, ESI†). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S17 in ESI,† the PXRD patterns of these two perovskites after measurement are very well consistent with simulated ones, indicating that ABB-1 and ABB-2 maintain good crystallinity during proton conduction measurements.

Conclusion
To summarize, we have successfully synthesized two 2D layered Dion–Jacobson bromide hybrid double perovskites ABB-1 and ABB-2 through the hydrothermal method. Both compounds exhibit semiconductor behaviour with wide band gaps of ∼2.8 eV. DFT calculation showed a direct band gap for both BHDPs considering SOC, while an indirect gap nature without SOC. Interestingly, in addition to strong photocurrent response (the ratio of Ilight/Idark reaches 95 and 89 for ABB-1 and ABB-2, respectively) and bluish-white broadband emission with nanosecond lifetimes, both compounds exhibit enhanced proton conductivity at T = 95 °C and RH = 95%. Moreover, crystals of ABB-1 and ABB-2 are very soluble in DMSO and can be easily processed into homogeneous and flat thin films using the spin-coating method. These thin films are highly stable. They remain unchanged for a record of 90 days at a relatively high RH of 55%. Thus, this work enlarges the potential application scope of lead-free BHDPs.
