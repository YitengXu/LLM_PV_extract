    , Accepted 4th June 2021First published on 8th June 2021AbstractProgressive advancement of remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) largely depends on the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), revealing the astonishing ability of OSCs to shift the paradigm of sustainable energy research. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is still positioned as a promising donor in cost-effectiveness and bulk availability. Recently, OSCs composed of P3HT and newly designed NFAs reached over 10% PCE, which increased the expectation of the large-scale production of OSCs. In this review, we summarize the critical evolution of fundamental molecular design for various NFAs over the last decade, specifically for the combination with P3HT. Some important NFAs with new diversity in their building blocks and excellent performance are highlighted. We also summarize nonhalogenated green solvent processes for the P3HT:NFA-based OSCs. Brief introductions are also provided regarding the large-area fabrication. This review offers clear guidelines with a comprehensive view for further developing NFAs compatible with P3HT-based OSCs for future commercialization.Shreyam ChatterjeeShreyam Chatterjee is an assistant professor in Prof. Yutaka Ie's group in the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Japan.

1. Introduction
Efforts to restrict global warming are closely related to the sustainable development goals, which aim to achieve environmental protection, social comfort, and economic prosperity. The ideal global circumstances can be achieved by reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and switching to environmentally friendly energy sources. Reducing energy-related CO2 emissions is the key to the energy transition. In this regard, Si-based inorganic solar cells have been extensively utilized worldwide. However, these solar cells have faced some limitations such as high cost of material and manufacturing, low flexibility, heavyweight, and environmental destruction.1,2
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have evolved as promising next-generation energy sources due to advantages such as low cost, flexibility, lightweight, high-throughput process, large-area production, and printing processes (Fig. 1).3,4 The active layers of OSCs are typically composed of a p-type semiconductor (electron donor) and an n-type semiconductor (electron acceptor). The resulting donor:acceptor (D:A) blend forms interpenetrating bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures in the films, which can overcome a small exciton diffusion length of ∼10 nm of organic materials and thus maximize the D–A interfacial area for efficient photoinduced charge separation.5–7 Although high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 18% (ref. 8–11) and a lifespan of up to 10 years12–15 were reported, innovation efforts for social implementation are still insufficient due to the difficulty in fabricating OSCs suitable for their applications.

Since the 1990s, when the effectiveness of fullerene (C60) and [6,6]-phenyl-Cx-butyric acid methyl ester (PCxBM: x = 61 or 71) was verified,16,17 fullerene derivatives have been utilized as standard acceptor materials in OSC studies. Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been utilized as a representative donor material. However, as a narrow optical bandgap to broaden the absorption range of solar light is essential to increase PCEs, D–A-type narrow bandgap copolymers are ranked as high-performance donor materials with fullerene-based acceptors.
Considerable efforts have been directed toward establishing the fundamental structure–property relationships that control the performance of these polymer:fullerene systems within the device. Fullerene acceptors have a large electron affinity, high electron-mobility, delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), isotropic electron transport, formation of domains with appropriate length-scale for charge separation, and reversible multiple electrochemical reductions to yield stable reduced charged species.18–22 Despite these advantages, they have faced some serious limitations such as (i) low absorption in the visible spectrum, (ii) inadequate scope for synthesis to control the structural tunability of energy levels, (iii) high cost, (iv) morphological instability in the blend films, and (iv) macroscopic crystalline structure formation.23,24
To overcome these limitations of fullerene-based acceptors, electron-accepting small π-conjugated molecules, oligomers, and polymers, termed nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), have been studied.25,26 NFAs can be designed from various π-conjugated building units and assembled through direct synthetic protocols, and their purifications are easily performed by conventional methods. In terms of molecular properties, NFAs have large extinction coefficients in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) region, providing acceptor domains with complementary light harvesting (to their respective donor components). Additionally, the NFA-based OSCs provide a remarkable low energetic offset for the generation of free charge carriers, which improve the overall performance of OSCs by low voltage loss with enhanced device stability.27–29 Considering the significant progress in the development of NFAs, particularly after the emergence of “Y-series” of NFAs within the last five years,30 PCEs based on D–A-type donors and NFAs have been approaching 18%. Thus, a constructive review of NFAs compatible with P3HT is also urgently needed to guide researchers toward further improvement of P3HT:NFA-based OSCs, as P3HT-based OSCs still have advantages for social implementation, as discussed below.
2. Working principle of OSCs
A typical solar cell device converts incident photons from sunlight into electrical current. The working principle of the device includes four key steps: (i) light absorption by the active layer and generation of coulombically tightly bound excitons; (ii) diffusion of the excitons to the D–A interfaces, (iii) exciton dissociation at the interfaces. First, charge transfer (CT) states are created, which in sequence fully dissociate into free holes and electrons (charge carriers); and (iv) charges drift through the separate donor and acceptor domains, where holes and electrons are finally collected at the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively (Fig. 2(a)). Each of the processes is vital and can be decisive in the overall solar cell performance. Here, the energy difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor provides the primary driving force for charge separation and is directly related to the photovoltage (open-circuit voltage, Voc). Two types of exciton dissociation can occur after the photoirradiation in OSCs: (1) the donor is photoexcited and then the excited electron is transferred to the acceptor (channel-I) or (2) the acceptor is photoexcited followed by the hole transfer from the acceptor to P3HT (channel-II) (Fig. 2(b)). The utilization of both types of carrier generation further improves the OSC performance.
 Fig. 2  (a) Device operating mechanism of OSCs. (b) Mechanism of photocurrent generation via different (channels I and II) exciton dissociation pathways in OSCs. (c) Cartoon models of (left) conventional and (right) inverted OSCs. 
When we focus on the OSC device architecture, work functions of both bottom and top electrodes can be tuned by using different interfacial layers. Thus, insertion of proper interfacial layers alters the charge extraction efficiency by adequately matching the Fermi levels of either the donor or the acceptor in the BHJ for the hole or electron collection, respectively. Depending on this mechanism, two types of device structures of the OSCs can be fabricated: (i) conventional and (ii) inverted structures, in which the electrode polarity is reversed in direction (Fig. 2(c)).31 In the conventional OSCs, a p-doped conducting polymer, (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is commonly used to modify the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to improve hole extraction, and low work function metals such as LiF/Al or Ca/Al are often used in the top as a cathode to ensure effective electron extraction. As the low work function metal is vulnerable to oxidation under ambient conditions, the resulting degradation of electrode becomes a major problem for OSCs with a conventional structure. Here, to enhance the stability of the OSC devices, an inverted structure is useful, where TiO2 or ZnO is prepared on ITO electrodes and a high work function metal (more air-stable) is used on the top as an anode for hole collection. Thus, inverted OSCs have superior ambient stability and better compatibility to all solution roll-to-roll (R2R) processing due to the metal anode deposition as a colloidal solution (e.g., Ag nanoparticles).32
3. Why P3HT-based OSCs are important?
P3HT has been extensively used for donor materials in organic electronic devices due to their chemical and electrochemical stability and an appropriate HOMO energy level of approximately −4.9 eV (Fig. 3(a)).33–35 Furthermore, the high crystallinity of P3HT enables the formation of aligned molecular configurations in the solid state, leading to high hole mobility (Fig. 3(b)).34
 Fig. 3  (a) Chemical structure of P3HT and its frontier energy levels relative to the vacuum level. (b) Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of P3HT in solution and thin film. (c) Schematic illustration of the face-on and edge-on configurations of P3HT. 
Thus, P3HT has been one of the most investigated donor polymers in OSC studies. In particular, the P3HT:PCxBM-based OSCs were regarded as the standard for a long time and have assisted in clarifying many fundamental issues, guiding OSC research directions.36–39 In the P3HT:PCxBM system, P3HT acts as the key for light-harvesting, and its absorption is within 300–600 nm (Fig. 3(c)). Thus, the intrinsic narrow absorption range for the P3HT:PCBM system led to the development of medium or low bandgap D–A-type polymers such as polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene (PTB7-Th) and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T). Although the pairing of NFAs with these narrow bandgap D–A-type polymers has yielded PCEs of 16–18%,10,11,40–42 the sophisticated chemical structures of these polymers result in low large-scale viability, low batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high synthetic cost. Furthermore, high-performance NFAs have also faced the same problems. Thus, the combination of D–A-type polymers with NFAs becomes a considerable obstacle for their practical application.
P3HT consists of 3-hexylthiophene as the repeating monomer unit. As the established synthetic routes are easy,43,44 P3HT can be obtained at a low cost (425.7 $ per g) compared to typical D–A-type polymers (PTB7-Th: 2333.8 $ per g; PBDB-T: 1471.3 $ per g).45 Moreover, P3HT has been synthesized in flow with excellent control over the molecular weight (Mw), polydispersity index (PDI), and regioregularity.46 Indeed, P3HT is currently one of the few polymers available in bulk quantities,41 being a feasible candidate donor for the commercialization of OSCs. Its use in large-area R2R printed solar cells has been widely demonstrated.47–51 Thus, P3HT is positioned to be the exclusive donor for large-scale manufactured OSCs.
It is to be noted that a myriad of polythiophene derivative such as (poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene]) (PDCBT) was developed for OSC application.52,53 Although the cost of PDCBT (4340 $ per g) is still high compared to P3HT, these polythiophene derivatives have great potential for practical applications. For further details on polythiophene derivatives, see the reviews in ref. 54–56.
4. Small molecule NFAs in P3HT-based OSCs
4.1. NDI-based NFAs
Naphthalene 1,8:4,5-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI) has characteristic physical and electronic properties such as high electron affinity, high electron mobility, strong absorption coefficient, and thermal stability. Another advantage of the NDI unit is the capacity to tune its solubility via incorporating lipophilic alkyl chains on the nitrogen atoms.57 This alkyl chain is also important in generating unique molecular alignments in the thin films.58 In contrast, the aggregation behaviour, wide energy gap, and narrow light absorption range beyond 400 nm hinder the use of pristine NDA as NFAs. Therefore, chemical modification of NDI-based NFAs has been extensively performed (Fig. 4, Table 1).

Note that the HOMO and LUMO values in this review were taken from the original papers. Since these values were estimated using various techniques, we suggest that the values should be compared with caution. The PCEs in this review showed the maximum values in the original papers. We unify the solvent abbreviation as follows: DCM for dichloromethane, THF for tetrahyrdofuran, CF for chloroform, CB for chlorobenzene, and o-DCB for o-dichlorobenzene.
In 2011, Jenekhe et al. reported NDI-based NFAs named NDI-3TH, where terthiophene units flanked the central NDI moiety.59 This chemical modification enabled obtaining optical bandgaps in the 1.4–2.1 eV range, in the relatively low LUMO energy level of −4.0 eV, and in the HOMO energy level between −5.5 and −6.1 eV. The highest PCE of 1.5% was observed for P3HT:NDI-3TH-based OSCs (Fig. 5(a and b)). This study was one of the first that concluded that additives (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) are effective in significantly increasing the PCEs in the NFAs-based OSCs (Fig. 5(c and d)). Bright-field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) images of the blend films without DIO showed well-mixed, bicontinuous, percolated morphologies, with P3HT nanowires evenly dispersed in NDI-3TH (Fig. 5(c)). The DIO-added films formed interconnected, well-woven pathways for charge transport, whereas P3HT domains remained in the nanowire network (Fig. 5(d)). To explore a set of criteria for the design of NFAs, the homologous series of NDI-based NFAs with different oligothiophene cores, NDI-nTH (n = 1–4) and NDI-nT (n = 2, 3), were developed.60 All these molecules showed ambipolar characteristics of hole (μh) and electron (μe) transport in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). For P3HT-based OSCs, photovoltaic responses were observed when μe/μh > 1, and the formation of bicontinuous nanoscale morphologies in the blend film is also essential for a high PCE.

The combination of electron-donating core substituents with the electron-accepting NDI framework can create a push–pull system. A series of NDI derivatives with amino core substituents and aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms were synthesized.61,62 Although these molecules showed limited PCEs of less than 1%, relatively high Voc values were obtained due to the high LUMO energy levels of the amino core-substituted NDI framework.
An NDI-based NFA (NDI-N1) having naphthalene imide at end groups was synthesized by Bhosale et al.63 The OSCs using this molecule showed a PCE of 2.91%. The additional introduction of a thiophene linker (NDI-N2) further increased the PCE to 4.04%. The smooth morphologies of the blend films indicated the better intermixing of P3HT and NDI-N2, which resulted in the high device performance. The researchers further developed N3 and N4 based on an A–A′–A design, where A′ is NDI and A is rhodanine or 1,3-indandione.64 The basic A–A′–A design dictates superior flexibility in optimizing energy levels to match with P3HT simply by the choice of the A group. OSCs using N3 and N4 showed PCEs of 4.76 and 3.52%, respectively. This research supports that the studied A–A′–A design has a strong potential to develop a series of high-performing NFAs. In fact, Bhosale et al. developed a unique NDI-based NFA N10, which is composed of NDI as both central and terminal functionalities. This molecule showed a PCE of 7.65%,65 which is the highest for P3HT:NDI-based NFAs to date.
Recently, Rao et al. demonstrated the successful use of an A–A1–D–A-type modular format to synthesize V-shaped NFAs.66 The new acceptor NDICz-6, which comprises an electron-rich carbazole D core and an NDI A core together with tetracyanoquinodimethane as A1 unit, was synthesized. The P3HT:NDICz-6-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.58%. Interestingly, after solvent vapour annealing using carbon disulphide, an increase of PCE of approximately two-fold was obtained compared to that of as-cast blend films.
4.2. PDI-based NFAs
Among various rylene diimides, terrylene-3,4:11,12-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) has been the main material to construct NFAs owing to its capability of being functionalized into solution-processable derivatives with nanoscale structures maintaining high electron mobility and a strong absorption coefficient. However, most PDI-based NFAs have bandgaps lower than 1.9 eV and thus narrow bandgap D–A-type donor polymers are generally suitable to complement the absorption. The recent advances in PDI-based NFAs for D–A-type donor polymers have been published in several reviews.67,68 For this reason, a limited number of PDI-based NFAs compatible to P3HT have been reported, as summarized below (Fig. 6, Table 2).

In 2012, Sharma et al. reported a symmetrical PDI derivative (PBI) bearing a 2-(4-nitrophenyl)acrylonitrile group at the 1,7-bay position of the PDI framework.69PBI had an optical bandgap of 1.72 eV and a LUMO energy level of −3.9 eV. Under optimized conditions using DIO as an additive and thermal treatment, the P3HT:PBI blend films showed balanced charge transport due to the enhanced crystallinity and increased hole mobility, resulting in a high PCE of up to 3.17%.
A series of PDI dimers bearing several arylene linkers were developed as NFAs, from which PCEs of up to 2.35% were achieved with PDI dimers having spirobifluorene linkers (1).70 The utilization of three-dimensional (3D) structures such as a tetraphenylmethane framework and silsesquioxane has also been effective for PDI-based OSCs.71 These results indicate that non-planar 3D structures effectively suppress self-aggregation and crystallization of the PDI units, which is favourable for the improvement of solar cell performance. We summarize other NFAs bearing 3D structure in Section 4.8.
Yao et al. designed PDI-based NFAs having twisting chemical structures and amphiphilic nature.72–74Bis-PDI-T-di-EG having 2-methoxylethoxyl (EG) groups at the outer bay-regions of the dimeric backbone resulted in the highest PCE of 1.54% when 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was used as a solvent additive. The molecular solvophobicity, which was generated by the EG groups at the bay-region, is considerably important for the photovoltaic characteristics.72 Further tuning in the central unit by a conformationally twisted 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl)) benzodithiophene (BDT-T) resulted in the BDT-T-bridged PDI dimer 2 and BDT-O-bridged PDI dimer 3.73 Due to the presence of 2-ethylhexylthienyl group in the central BDT-T unit, 2 exhibited a highly twisted conformation through steric pairing and π–π stacking to reduce the over aggregation tendency in the blend (Fig. 7). This distorted structure also helped 2 to achieve excellent solution processability. In contrast, 3 showed high aggregation ability and very poor solution processability, which hindered the fabrication of the device. When blended with the P3HT, the dimer 2 gave a PCE of 1.95% due to its excellent processability.

The swap of inner BDT-T and outer PDI units is also effective for NFAs: the PDI-based compound (B-PDI-B) showed a PCE of 1.7% by functionalizing the bay-region using the BDT-T units.74
Zhan et al. developed a twisted dimeric PDI (IDT-2PDI) with a bulky fused-ring indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) as a bridge.75 The P3HT:IDT-2PDI blend film showed relatively balanced hole and electron mobilities on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and thus this film showed a PCE of 2.61%.
4.3. Other rylene imide-based NFAs
Other electron-accepting small molecules bearing rylene imide were also developed as small NFAs for P3HT-based OSCs (Fig. 8, Table 2). A fluorene-centered perylene monoimide dimer (PMI-F-PMI) with a partially non-coplanar configuration was developed.76 The optimum PCE of the OSC based on PMI-F-PMI and P3HT increased to 2.30% due to the relatively balanced electron–hole transport and smooth morphologies.

Pei et al. developed a series of fluoranthene-fused imide (FFI-1, Th-PhCHO, Th-COOMe) for NFAs.77,78 Slow evaporation of the solvent and subsequent thermal annealing of the P3HT:FFI-1 films resulted in an optimal grain size and a uniform phase separation, with a PCE of 1.86%.77 Subsequently, it was reported that the introduction of the bulky p-formylphenyl group was effective in improving the PCE up to 2.40% due to the improved molecular packing in the blend.78 The extension of the π-conjugation was designed to adjust the charge-transport properties, and a series of acenaphtho fluoranthene-fused diimide derivatives (AFI1, AFI2, and AFI3) were synthesized. Inverted OSCs based on P3HT and AFI3 achieved PCEs up to 2.37%.79
Wudl et al. established a facile and efficient synthetic route towards decacyclene triimide (DTI-4a). This molecule contains three naphthalene monoimide rings positioned in a three-fold symmetric pattern around a central benzene ring.80,81 The electron affinity of this π-conjugated framework was increased by the presence of a multiple electron-accepting imide moiety, thereby facilitating electron injection and charge transport in the device. OSCs were fabricated using P3HT and DTI-4a, which exhibited a PCE of 1.6% and a fill factor of 0.57.
Cao et al. reported Cor-PI and Cor-NI as NFAs, which attached an electron-accepting phthalimide (PI) or naphthalimide (NI) unit to the corannulene core.82 In these molecules, N-hexyl substituents were chosen to ensure sufficient solubility and film forming properties of the compounds. The large dihedral angle between the corannulene core and imide moieties of Cor-PI and Cor-NI improved the miscibility with P3HT, and the P3HT:Cor-NI blend film exhibited a PCE of up to 1.03%.
4.4 NFAs with a three-membered conjugated unit in the core
In this section, we summarize representative NFAs bearing a three-membered conjugated unit in the central part (Fig. 9, Table 3). In most cases, the combination of a central unit with a characteristic terminal unit is critical for obtaining good PCEs. One of the effective terminal units, 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1,3-dione (ID), was developed by Winzenberg et al.83 They utilized fluorene and thiophene as well-established privileged structural templates and synthesized the electron-accepting molecule FEHIDT, which showed a PCE of 2.12%.

A 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3′,4′-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY)-based small molecule (BDP-CPDT), which comprises a thiophene-based donor core and terminal BODIPY units conjugated through the meso position, was developed.84BDP-CPDT showed a low-lying LUMO energy level of −3.79 eV and electron-transport characteristics in OFETs. This compound exhibited the highest PCE of 1.51% when CN was used as a solvent additive.
For the first time, NFAs having rhodanine dyes at the terminal unit were developed by Lim et al.85 A small molecule acceptor (Flu-RH) showed a PCE of 3.08% with a high Voc of 1.03 V. As summarized in this review, the use of rhodanine as the terminal unit contributes to the NFA performance.
Holliday et al. developed a revolutionary NFA (FBR) comprising 3-ethylrhodanine as a terminal unit.86 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of FBR were −5.70 and −3.57 eV, respectively. The HOMO of FBR was delocalized over the entire π-conjugated backbone, whereas the LUMO was concentrated onto the electron-deficient periphery (Fig. 10(a)). This LUMO distribution has advantages for efficient electron-transport along the neighbouring FBR molecules in the blend films. UV-vis absorption spectra showed that FBR can absorb in a considerably higher solar flux region of the spectrum compared to that of PC61BM (∼300 nm), and the molar extinction coefficient of FBR was considerably higher than that of PC61BM (Fig. 10(b)). The nonplanar nature of FBR would act favourably to prevent the growth of large acceptor domains due to self-aggregation and provide relatively isotropic charge transport (Fig. 10(c)). For the first time, OSCs based on FBR exceeded 4.0% PCE and outperformed PC61BM-based cells (Fig. 10(d)). Additionally, the P3HT:FBR blend was highly intermixed, which substantially improved the morphological stability in the devices. Thus, FBR was one of the milestones in the P3HT:NFA-based OSC research.

A diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-attached molecule F(DPP)2B2 showed HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.21 and −3.39 eV, respectively.87 These energy levels were suitable for use as both a donor and an acceptor, and PCEs of more than 3.0% were obtained in both cases. In particular, a PCE of 3.17% was obtained when F(DPP)2B2 was utilized as an NFA with P3HT. F8-DPPTCN was also developed, using fluorene as the core with arms of DPP having thiophene-2-carbonitrile as the terminal units.88 This molecule had a LUMO energy level of −3.65 eV and a narrow bandgap of 1.66 eV. The P3HT:F8-DPPTCN-based OSCs showed a PCE of 2.37%.
A linear NFA (DBS-2DPP) using a dibenzosilole (DBS) as a core unit showed good nanoscale interpenetrating networks with a long fibroid structure, which is beneficial to charge separation and enhanced the efficiency of OSC performance up to 2.05% PCE.89
A NFA named N7 was synthesized by using simple carbazole as the central and DPP as the terminal building block.90N7 displayed well-matched energy levels (HOMO = −5.56 eV and LUMO = −3.74 eV) with those of P3HT. OSCs based on N7 showed a PCE of 2.30% with a high Voc of 1.17 V.
NFAs based on 9-fluorenone or 9,10-anthraquinone as the central building block and DPP moieties as terminal groups, namely DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP, were developed.91 Suboptimal morphologies with DPP-ANQ-DPP inhibited the crystallisation of P3HT chains, resulting in a PCE of 1.2%. NFAs bearing DPP in the central unit were also developed, and we summarize these structures in Section 4.7.
A2–A1–D–A1–A2-type NFAs NAI-FN-NAI(BO) were developed.92 The OSCs based on P3HT:NAI-FN-NAI(BO) exhibited a PCE of 3.6%, which was attributed to the enhanced nanoscale morphologies of the active layer.
4.5 NFAs with a five-membered conjugated unit in the core
In this section, we summarize recent mainstream NFAs that have a five-membered conjugated unit in the central part (Fig. 11, Table 4). A A–D–A-type NFA IDT-2BR based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) and rhodanine was designed by Zhan et al.93IDT-2BR adopts a rigid and coplanar backbone configuration, which facilitates charge transport. The peripheral substituents of hexylphenyl groups on the IDT moiety are beneficial for forming favourable interpenetrating networks without severe self-aggregation when mixing with P3HT. OSCs based on the P3HT:IDT-2BR films processed with 3% 1-chloronaphthalene as an additive achieved PCEs as high as 5.12%. This was the first report in which a PCE over 5% was obtained for a P3HT-based NFA.

IDT-based NFAs with NP as the end-capping group (3) were synthesised.94 The P3HT:3-based blend films showed a PCE of up to 2.36%.
Holliday and McCulloch et al. have reported new acceptor derivatives (O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR) to address the issues of spectral overlap and morphologies for FBR.95 Useful chemical modifications, which include the replacement of the fluorene core with the IDT unit, led to the planarized molecular structure and hence accomplished a red-shift absorption and suitable crystallinity. O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR showed high PCEs of 6.34 and 6.00%, respectively.
Baran and McCulloch et al. reported efficient and stable P3HT-based OSCs by utilizing a ternary approach; two NFAs were combined with P3HT for the active layer.96 The replacement of the IDT core in O-IDTBR95 with indacenodibenzene resulted in a new NFA (IDFBR), which increased the bandgap of the molecule. The absorption maxima for O-IDTBR and IDFBR were at 690 and 530 nm, respectively (Fig. 12(a)). A strong and complementary absorption to O-IDTBR enabled the ternary blend films. Moreover, the difference in their physical properties resulted in a difference between O-IDTBR and IDFBR in the ternary blend: the less crystalline and more diffusive IDFBR dispersed in both P3HT and O-IDTBR phases (Fig. 12(b)), allowing the formation of a three-component redox cascade. As a result, the P3HT-based ternary blend showed an excellent photovoltaic performance with 7.7% PCE. Additionally, this ternary device exhibited an outstanding dark state and photostability in air. Fully solution-processed R2R compatible modules using IDTBR95 (note that IDTBR is the same compound as O-IDTBR. In this review, we use both abbreviated names based on the original papers) and P3HT were performed by Machui et al.48 A total module area of 60 cm2 was fabricated and a PCE of 5.00% was achieved. The details are provided in Section 7.2.

A A2–A1–D–A1–A2 modelled linear molecular structure was utilized to design and synthesize benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA)-containing NFA (BTA1), where rhodanine, BTA, and IDT were used as A2, A1, and D units, respectively.97BTA1 had a flat backbone configuration, which was beneficial for the charge transport. The P3HT:BTA1-based device provided a high Voc of 1.02 V and a high PCE of 5.24%. The utilization of thiazolidine-2,4-dione as the terminal unit keeping the central unit intact as BTA1 developed an NFA (BTA2).98 The substitution of sulphur atoms with oxygen atoms led to the increase of the LUMO energy level from −3.55 to −3.38 eV. The P3HT:BTA2-based device exhibited a doubled Voc of 1.22 V compared to that of the P3HT:PC61BM system and a good PCE of 4.5%.
Two NFAs (BT2 and BT2b) were also developed.99 The high LUMO energy level of these two acceptors induced a high Voc over 0.9 V when pairing with P3HT. The P3HT:BT2b-based device showed a high PCE of 6.08%, which was attributed to the red-shifted absorption and the high crystallinity of the BT2b and the balanced electron and hole mobility of the blend films.
A 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN)-attached small molecule acceptor (BTA3) was developed using the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 modular strategy.100 A lower weight ratio of 1:0.3 was applied for the P3HT:BTA3 blend film. The P3HT:BTA3-based blend film exhibited a promising PCE of 5.64%. The higher electron mobility of the P3HT:BTA3 film formed a continuous electron transport pathway. This study indicated that the incorporation of a weak electron-accepting building unit (BTA) is an effective design to improve the performance of RCN-attached NFAs. An incorporation of the methoxy groups into BTA provided BTA101 and BTA103.101 These methoxy groups contributed to the upshifting of the LUMO energy levels and facilitated the intramolecular charge transfer. BTA101 gave one of the highest Voc of 1.34 V, and BTA103 provided a PCE of 5.31%. In continuation with this material development using quinoxaline as a bridging unit gave new NFAs Qx1b and Qx3b, which gave PCEs of 4.81 and 6.37%, respectively.102,103 In this BTA series, BTA43 and BTA53 were also developed by introducing the oxygen atoms into the side chains. Blending of BTA43 and BTA53 with P3HT provided high PCEs of 6.56 and 6.31%, respectively.104 Introduction of the benzyl group on the terminal N atoms in the RCN part in BTA3 gave a new NFA BTA5. This molecule showed a 6.01% of PCE.105
Chen et al. replaced the BTA unit with thiophene fused-BTA in a BTA3-type molecule, which gave JC2 and JC14. OSCs based on JC2 and JC14 showed PCEs of 6.24 and 7.72%, respectively.106,107
Two A–D–A-type NFAs, l-IDTBTRh and a-IDTBTRh, comprising l-IDT or angular indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (a-IDT) as the central core, BT as the π-bridge acceptor segments, and 3-ethylrhodanine as the end-capping groups, were synthesized.108 The geometric shape of the l-IDT and a-IDT subunits had a pivotal role in governing the optoelectronic properties, charge mobilities, morphologies, and photovoltaic characteristics of the two acceptors. The P3HT:l-IDTBTRh-based film offered a PCE of 5.38%.
Two thiazole (Tz) containing small molecular acceptors (H-IDTzR and P-IDTzR) with A–π–D–π–A-type structures and different side chains were designed and synthesized.109 Both compounds exhibited a good planar configuration due to the incorporation of S⋯N noncovalent conformational locks. P-IDTzR with bulky side chains exhibited suitable crystallinity, which adequately matches with P3HT. The P3HT:P-IDTzR blend films demonstrated optimal morphologies and thus achieved a higher PCE of 5.01% compared to the P3HT:H-IDTzR blend films (3.53%).
A NFA (ORCN) was designed by simple replacement of alkyl side chains in ERCN with alkoxy chains.110 In ORCN, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were increased by the alkoxy chains. Additionally, the S⋯O noncovalent conformational locks of alkoxy chains increased the planarity and rigidity of the backbone of acceptors, yielding higher crystallinity and better charge-transport mobility. Thus, the P3HT:ORCN blend films exhibited a higher PCE of 6.40%, compared to that of the P3HT:ERCN films (2.64%).
A π-extended NFA (IDT-DPP-R) containing the IDT unit was synthesized, exhibiting a strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption.111 The P3HT:IDT-DPP-R binary blend provided a PCE of 1.42%. Ternary blend devices of two acceptors IDT-DPP-R (20%) and PC61BM (80%) with P3HT exhibited a PCE of 3.95%.
Yu et al. reported a simplified NFA named A1 analogous to O-IDTBR for reducing the synthetic complexity.112 This molecule showed a PCE of 5.39% with an industrial readiness factor (i-FOM) of 0.26, which enhanced more than 30%, compared to the P3HT:O-IDTBR OSCs.
4.6 NFAs with a thiadiazole derivative in the core
π-Conjugated molecules bearing thiadiazole derivatives in the central unit have also been developed as NFAs (Fig. 13, Table 5). A high PCE of 2.54% with a high Voc of 0.96 V was obtained by PI-BT, which is composed of a central benzothiadiazole unit and terminal imide units.113 The crystallization behaviour of the molecules has an influence on the PCEs.

It was proposed that the utilization of both the channel-I and channel-II processes (Fig. 2(b)) can achieve higher efficiencies beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit in OSCs.114 Relying on this hypothesis, a new NFA named YF25 was developed.115 The P3HT:YF25 film showed a PCE of 1.4%. It was confirmed that photo-induced hole transfer via acceptor excitation is a viable photocurrent generation pathway for maximising light harvesting in complementary acceptor–donor pairs. This is also supported by the time resolved microwave conductivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements.
Benzothiadiazole-based π-conjugated compounds (Imi-a-BT) bearing phthalimide as the electron-accepting terminal units were prepared.116 The P3HT:Imi-a-BT-based OSCs showed a moderate photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 1.58%.The effect of alkyl chains on the phthalimide unit was further investigated by comparing five different alkyl chains.117 The alkyl chains were found to have a strong influence on the energy levels and the crystallinity of the materials and consequently on the PCE of OSCs. A NFA named Ph-MH with specific alkyl chain modification in the terminal part further improved the PCE up to 2.05%. The overall structural similarity of the NFAs facilitated to reveal the structure–property relationship; a good correlation between the Jsc and the dispersion component of the surface energy (γd) of the NFAs was observed (Fig. 14(a)). With the increased γd value, the molecular orientation gradually changed from the edge-on orientation to a more face-on orientation. This phenomenon is considered to occur because the branched alkyl chain enhanced the amorphous behaviour and thus exposed more π-conjugated planes to the D:A interfaces, which has a beneficial effect on the efficient charge separation in the blend films (Fig. 14(b)).

Alkoxy-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) was utilized to develop NFA (BTDT2R).118 The P3HT:BTDT2R-based blend film exhibited a dramatic enhancement of PCE from 2.74% to 5.09% after solvent vapour annealing treatment.
PI and NI components are frequently used as terminal units for the construction of NFAs. Two electron-accepting π-conjugated molecules (T-BTz-NI and T-BTz-PI) were synthesized to investigate the influence of the terminal units on the properties and photovoltaic characteristics.119 The utilization of NI led to red-shifted absorption and increased the electron accepting characteristics, compared to those of PI. T-BTz-NI showed an improved PCE of 1.16%.
Ie et al. utilized naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz) as an electron-accepting unit and synthesized a linear NFA (NTz-Np).120 For comparison, benzothiadiazole (BTz)-based NFA (BTz-Np) was also developed. Replacement of BTz with NTz facilitated the redshifted absorption and increased the electron-accepting characteristics. The P3HT:NTz-Np blend film exhibited enhanced PCE as high as 2.81%, which is higher than that of the P3HT:BTz-Np-based devices. This result showed the effectiveness of the NTz unit. A series of new NFAs bearing NTz as an electron-deficient central core coupled with a terminal Np via a thiophene linker containing various substituents (hydrogen, fluorine, hexyl, and 2-ethylhexyl groups) were developed to explore the effect of substituents on the thiophene linker on the properties and photovoltaic characteristics of the NTz-Np framework.120 Among the examined substituents, NTz-Thex-Np showed the highest PCE of 2.14% due to the good morphologies in the blend film.121 Naphtho[1,2-c:7,8-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (vNTz), which is a structural isomer of NTz, was also utilized as an electron-accepting unit in NFAs (vNTz-TehR and vNTz-TboR). The electrochemical and photophysical properties were nearly identical to the conventional material of NTz-TboR, but the improved solubility allowed utilizing a smaller alkyl chain. A PCE of 2.06% was obtained by vNTz-TehR.122
Ie et al. also established the synthesis of fluorinated naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (FNTz) as a new electron-accepting unit to be used in the NFA.123 A FNTz-containing NFA (FNTz-Teh-FA) was synthesized, in which a thiophene linker and a fluoranthene imide (FA)-based terminal unit were utilized to increase the overall π-conjugation throughout the molecule. A high PCE of 3.12% was achieved when the P3HT:FNTz-Teh-FA blend was used in OSCs.
Zhang et al. synthesized a new NFA named ZY-4Cl by replacing the cyanosubstituted end groups in BTP-4Cl124 with the carbonyl-substituted counterpart.125 To investigate the interaction between the donor and the acceptors, two model compounds (TT-CN and TT-O) were developed. This model study showed that the P3HT:TT-CN blend exhibited considerably stronger miscibility than that of the P3HT:TT-O blend. The difference in phase separation behaviours of these two blends was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images; the 1:1 ratio of the P3HT:TT-O blend formed rough morphologies with a roughness value (Rq) of 5.02 nm, whereas the P3HT:TT-CN blend showed a smooth Rq of 1.53 nm (Fig. 15(a and b)). The P3HT:BTP-4Cl-based device showed a poor efficiency of 1.0% due to inferior phase separation. In contrast, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based device exhibited an inspiring new record PCE of 9.46% (Fig. 15 (c and d)). From the GIWAX measurements, it was clear that there was no diffraction peaks in any directions for the P3HT:BTP-4Cl film, indicating the highly intermixed P3HT and BTP-4Cl phases and amorphous morphologies of the film. Moreover, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl film provided both edge-on and face-on orientations, reflecting that P3HT and ZY-4Cl have formed two separate phases in the blend film (Fig. 15(e and f)). Thus, it can be stated that lowering the miscibility via removing the cyano groups in the NFAs may be a feasible and universal method for improving the PCE of the P3HT:NFA-based OSCs. This is the best PCE to date for P3HT:NFA-based OSCs.

Quite recently, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl device exceeded a PCE of 10.24% by using a kind of volatilizable solid additive, SA4 (2-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione).126 This enhancement was mainly due to the more ordered molecular packing and more favorable phase separation, leading to the enhanced charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. Thus, for the first time, over 10% PCE was achieved using P3HT-based OSCs.
Zhou et al. reported TPBT-RCN,127 which is analogous to the high performance NFAs Y5 and Y6. The P3HT:TPBT-RCN-based device exhibited an improved PCE of 5.11% in comparison with Y6 (PCE = 2.41%) and Y5 (PCE = 3.60%), owing to the suitable energy levels and optimized phase-separated morphologies.
4.7 NFAs with a DPP unit in the core
The DPP group can be introduced for the terminal unit, as summarized in Section 4.4, and also for the central unit in NFAs (Fig. 16 and Table 6). Sonar et al. developed DPP-based NFA named TFPDPP to fabricate the P3HT:TFPDPP blend film, which achieved a PCE of 1.00%.128

An acetylene-bridged small molecule (DPP-Pht2) based on a DPP core end-capped with phthalimide was developed.129 Suitable fibrillar microcrystalline domains in the P3HT:DPP-Pht2 film produced a better self-organization with the donor, resulting in a PCE of 3.28%.
A DPP-based small molecule (DPP(C2T)2) bearing ester groups at both α and β-positions in the end-capped thiophene ring showed ambipolar characteristics.130 The combination of P3HT with DPP(C2T)2 exhibited a PCE of 1.08%.
NFA named MPU1 was synthesized by the combination of the DPP core with terminal rhodanine.131 The P3HT:MPU1 blend film showed a PCE of 2.16%.
The influence of a spacer unit between DPP and the terminal imide unit was investigated.132 The P3HT:DPP-Th and P3HT:DPP-Tz devices achieved PCEs of 1.30 and 0.43%, respectively, and this difference mainly originates from the film morphologies.
4.8 3D-type NFAs
As summarized in Section 4.2, PDI-based NFAs bearing a 3D structure have been developed. In this section, we summarize other 3D NFAs (Fig. 17, Table 6). Sauvé et al. developed unique 3D chemical structures based on azadipyrromethene (ADP) dyes and their zinc complexes named Zn(ADP)2 and Zn(WS3)2 (Fig. 18(a and b)).133 These molecules showed intense absorption in the visible to NIR regions (Fig. 18(c)) and low reduction potentials, leading to the suitable frontier energy level to combine with P3HT (Fig. 18(d)). The most-efficient NFA Zn(WS3)2 prevented crystallization and promoted favourable nanoscale phase separation from the P3HT blend (Fig. 18(e–h)), providing a high PCE of 4.10%.

The effect of a fluorine atom in three different positions on Zn(WS3)2 (ref. 133) was further explored by synthesizing four different compounds Zn(Ln)2 (where n = 1–4).134 Fluorine substitution had a slight effect on the absorbance and energy levels. However, it strongly affected the charge transport, bimolecular recombination, and device performance. The fluorine substitution increased the PCEs from 2.5% (Zn(WS3)2) to 3.7% (Zn(L3)2). The introduction of hexyl groups at the para position of the proximal phenyls in Zn(WS3) produced Zn(L1)2.135Zn(L2)2 is derived from Zn(L1)2 with 1-naphthylethynyl groups at the pyrrolic positions. A PCE of 5.5% was obtained for the P3HT:Zn(L2)2-based blend film.136
The DPP-based 3D molecule (4) having a [2,2]paracyclophane framework in the central unit yielded the highest PCE of 2.69%.137
A spirobifluorene (SF) unit was utilized to generate a 3D NFA SF-DPPEH.138 The unique X-shaped molecular structure originating from the spiro linkage resulted in high solubility and suppressed aggregation. Moderate crystallization behaviour and nanoscale phase separation decreased geminate recombination and thus enhanced the PCE up to 3.63%. SF-functioned 3D NFAs (SF-OR and SF-ORCN) using rhodanine or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as the terminal units were developed.139SF-OR and SF-ORCN showed high PCEs of 6.66 and 4.48%, respectively. The incorporation of a cyano group into the rhodanine core improved the electron accepting ability. However, it sacrificed the ordered structure because the conjugated backbone became less planar.
Chen et al. introduced a SF-based 3D NFA (SF(DPPB)4), which had a symmetrical cruciate configuration.140 This structure assured fine phase separation in the active layer. The P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 films exhibited a PCE of 5.16% and a high Voc of 1.14 V. This PCE was further improved to 6.09% by using an inverted device structure.141SF(DPPFB)4 was synthesized using the SF core and four DPP arms with end-capping by 4-fluorobenzene.142 The terminal fluorine atoms decreased the energy levels of SF(DPPFB)4. In particular, its LUMO energy level decreased by 0.04 eV, compared to that of SF(DPPB)4.140 The P3HT:SF(DPPFB)4-based device exhibited a PCE of 4.42%.
The spiro(fluorene-9,9′-xanthene) unit was functionalized with terminal DPP units to generate 3-D NFA named SFX1.143 With the P3HT combination, a PCE of 6.55% was achieved after post-annealing treatment.
4.9 Star-shaped NFAs
Relatively planar and two-dimensional (2D) NFAs have also been developed (Fig. 19, Table 7). Lin et al. introduced a star-shaped NFA named S(TPA–DPP) based on triphenylamine (TPA) as a core and DPP as arms. The HOMO and LUMO energies were −5.26 and −3.26 eV, respectively, and the difference between the LUMO of S(TPA–DPP) and the HOMO of P3HT was as large as 1.5 eV, resulting in a high Voc of 1.18 V with a PCE of 1.20%.144

An isoindigo-based star-shaped acceptor (P1) with triphenylamine and phenyl cores was explored. OSCs based on the P3HT:P1 blend film exhibited a PCE of 0.81%.145
Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) core-based NFA (4D) with DPP terminals was synthesized.1464D had a four-directional molecular arrangement with excellent solubility. This compound showed a PCE of 3.86% with a high Voc of 1.18 V. The TPE unit was terminally flanked with cyanopyridone (CP) units to generate a 3D molecular architecture to provide an NFA named TPE-CP4.147 When TPE-CP4 was combined with P3HT, it produced a high PCE of 6.02%. Recently, another NFA named W8, which possesses NDI as terminal units, was reported to achieve a PCE of 5.26%.148
A promising NFA, TrBTIC, composed of an electron rich truxene (Tr) core and electron-deficient dicyano indanedione with a BT moiety was developed.149TrBTIC exhibited excellent solubility in common solvents including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), a green solvent, but crystallized slowly with long-term aging in TMB at room temperature (Fig. 20). The P3HT:TrBTIC-based blend film showed an improved PCE from 6.62% to 8.25% due to the pre-phase separation of the donor and the acceptor, in the blending condition. This detail is shown in Section 6.

4.10 Miscellaneous NFAs
Novel NFAs that do not fit the categories in previous sections are summarized here (Fig. 21, Table 7). A new type of NFAs using strain and Hückel aromaticity was reported by Wudl et al.150 In this study, the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene backbone was designed to develop a series of electron-accepting compounds. An asymmetric D99′BF showed higher solubility and suitable energy levels (HOMO = −5.17 eV and LUMO = −3.24 eV). The P3HT:D99′BF-based OSCs showed a PCE of 1.7% with a promisingly high Voc of 1.10 V. It was revealed that electron transfer can occurs with very low LUMO energy offset (∼0.12 eV) between P3HT and D99′BF.150,151
 Fig. 21  Chemical structures of miscellaneous NFAs. 
Electron-accepting pentacene-based π-conjugated molecules were developed by Anthony et al.152 It was noticed that the photocurrent strongly correlated with the crystal packing motif of pentacene derivatives; 2D π-stacking interactions showed lower photovoltaic characteristics than one-dimensional π-stacking interactions. Compound 5 showed the best performance with a PCE of 1.27%. The dicyanoethylene-substituted quinacridone derivative (DCN-nCQA, n = 4, 6, and 8) was developed.153 The DCN-8CQA exhibited a low LUMO energy level (−4.1 eV), small bandgap (1.8 eV), and moderate electron mobility. The P3HT:DCN-8CQA-based OSCs showed a PCE of 1.57%.
Park et al. developed a dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based NFA (NIDCS), in which a specific strategy for modulating the self-assembly tendencies was implemented by combining an NI moiety into the terminal positions of the molecules.154 The bulkiness of the NI substituent weakened the intermolecular interactions, and balanced aggregation characteristics were obtained in the blend film. The NIDCS-based OSCs with P3HT exhibited a PCE of 2.71% and an exceptionally high Jsc of 8.04 mA cm−2.
An all-carbon NFA material (DIR-2EH) based on diindeno[1,2-g:1′,2′-s]rubicene was developed.155 This is a molecular fragment of fullerene and thus has high electron affinity. A high content of acceptor in the blend film with P3HT (D:A ratio of 1:4) yielded the best PCE of 3.05%. Solution-processable 1,6,7,10-tetramethylfluoranthene (6), as the smallest fragment of fullerene, was synthesized for NFA application.156 This molecule showed absorption up to 400 nm, yielding a PCE of 0.71%. However, this device showed high stability under air-exposed conditions.
An NFA having fused thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) named DNIT-TT2T was synthesized.157 The P3HT:DNIT-TT2T-based blend film achieved a PCE of 1.25%.
Two NFAs named DRCN3TT and DRCN5TT with A–D–A-type chemical structures based on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene central unit and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine terminal groups were developed. These compounds showed both donor and acceptor characteristics. The appropriate LUMO energy levels of −3.50 eV for DRCN3TT and −3.52 eV for DRCN5TT allowed them to act as appropriate electron acceptors for the P3HT donor.158 The DRCN3TT- and DRCN5TT-based blended films with P3HT exhibited PCEs of 3.55 and 2.78%, respectively.
Thickness-tolerable BHJ OSCs were fabricated using IDTIDT-IC as an NFA with a D–A-type donor polymer.159 Using IDTIDT-IC, the P3HT-based OSCs showed an impressive PCE of 3.64% at a large active layer thickness of 236 nm.160 This thickness-insensitive photovoltaic characteristic of the P3HT:IDTIDT-IC system enabled large-scale R2R processing. This is described in Section 7.2.
A silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc)-based NFA, bis(tri-n-butylsilyl oxide) SiPc ((3BS)2-SiPc),161 was developed, and a high PCE of 3.6% was achieved with the SiPc-based material, for the first time.
Recently, utilising the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the central part and rhodanine as the terminal part, which were joined together with a ring-locked by a carbon–carbon double bond, the NFA IDTT-CR was obtained. The P3HT:IDTT-CR blend produced a PCE of 2.86%.162
5. Acceptor polymers in P3HT-based OSCs
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are a class of OSCs in which the active layers are composed of a p-type polymer (donor) and an n-type polymer (acceptor).163 In the polymer:polymer blend films, critical issues such as inadequate light-harvesting capability, low charge-carrier mobility, and formation of unfavourable film morphologies have become more prominent.164,165 A number of effective strategies have been developed to control the film properties and morphologies for all-PSCs, and PCE values over 10% have recently been possible by the combination of D–A-type donor and acceptor polymers.166–168 For recent advances in all-PSCs, the readers are referred to the reviews in ref. 169–173. In the case of P3HT-based all-PSCs, acceptor polymers should have well-matched absorbance, crystallinity, and morphologies with P3HT. However, appropriate acceptor polymers to be used with P3HT are limited and thus the PCEs are still positioned around 5%. In this section, we focus on acceptor polymers for P3HT-based all-PSCs.
5.1. Acceptor polymers based on fluorene and benzothiadiazole units
The pioneering work of P3HT-based all-PSCs was accomplished by the utilization of F8TBT as an acceptor polymer (Fig. 22, Table 8).174 This was achieved by the incorporation of an electron-accepting BT unit into the polymer backbone. The lowered energy levels allowed efficient electron transfer from P3HT to F8TBT. Later, nanopatterned P3HT:F8TBT films fabricated by a nanoimprinting technique improved the PCE to 1.9%.175 The optimization of interconnected phase-separated domains was reported using a crystalline P3HT nanowire blended with F8TBT, which showed a PCE of 1.87%.176 The F8TBT acceptor polymer with substituents in the BT unit was also reported. The alkoxy-substituted F8TBT-OC6 showed a PCE of 1.80% with a Voc of 1.36.177 In 2011, a PCE of 2.0% was attained by using F12TBT.178 The PCE of the P3HT:F12TBT solar cells was further increased to 2.7% through the use of F12TBT with a high Mw of 78000 g mol−1.179 The high MwF12TBT could form suitable blend morphologies for efficient charge generation and charge transport after thermal annealing. The nanoscale characterization of the electrical properties of the P3HT:F12TBT films using the conductive AFM was effective to optimize the blend morphologies, and the chloroform-processed P3HT:F12TBT films reached a PCE of 3.5%.180

5.2. NDI-based acceptor polymers
Among myriads of rylene diimide families, NDI and PDI were extensively utilized as electron-accepting units to construct acceptor polymers with high μe values.181,182 Facchetti et al. developed an NDI-based renowned polymer (P(NDI2OD-T2)), which exhibited high μe values of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements and 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs.181,183 Researchers were keen to apply P(NDI2OD-T2) to an acceptor polymer in all-PSCs.
In 2011, Sirringhaus et al. and Loi et al. independently reported all-PSCs based on P3HT:P(NDI2OD-T2),184,185 where only moderate PCEs of 0.16–0.18% were achieved. The formation of large domains (∼100 nm) in the blend, driven by preferential segregation and crystallization,186 and rapid geminate recombination of the charge population (within 200 ps of excitation), was the governing factor behind the relatively poor Jsc, which limited the overall device performance.184 However, a high FF approaching 65% could be achieved, demonstrating that once excitons are formed, the charges can be effectively transported for collection at the respective electrodes. Later, the morphologies of the P3HT:P(NDI2OD-T2) films were optimized by the process solvent: changing the process solvent from a xylene to xylene:chloronaphthalene (1:1) mixed solvent enhanced PCEs up to 1.3%, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced Jsc as the result of suppressed self-aggregation of P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig. 23, Table 8).187,188
 Fig. 23  Chemical structures of NDI-based acceptor polymers. 
In 2012, Jenekhe et al. reported crystalline acceptor polymers of NDI copolymerized with bisselenophene named PNDIBS. All-PSCs comprising PNDIBS and P3HT showed a PCE of 0.9%.189 The EQE spectrum of this device showed that approximately 19% of the photocurrent came from the NIR (700–900 nm) light harvesting by PNDIBS. D–A-type block copolymers (P3HT-PNBI-P3HT), which consist of regioregular P3HT and NDI units, have been reported.190 All-PSCs fabricated using the P3HT:P3HT-PNBI-P3HT blend film achieved a reasonable PCE of 1.28%. A series of NDI-based copolymers with varying number of fused thiophenes as donor units were developed. Among them, P(NDI-4fTh) showed the highest μes in OFETs and PCEs in OSCs.191
The low-lying (∼4.0 eV) LUMO energy level of P(NDI2OD-T2) is one of the main reasons of low Voc for all-PSCs (∼0.4 V) when combined with P3HT. Considering this, Tajima et al. synthesized a new alternating copolymer named PF-NDI, which comprised NDI and fluorene (F), a common electron-donating building block.192 As the twisting structure between NDI and F units led to the localization of the LUMO density in the NDI unit, PF-NDI had a high-lying LUMO energy level (−3.61 eV). All-PSCs using PF-NDI showed a PCE of 1.63% with an enhanced Voc of 0.68 V.
A series of three-component acceptor polymers (P[PDIx%-co-NDI(1−x)%]) having indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT), NDI, and PDI units were synthesized, and the highest all-PSC performance of 1.54% PCE was found when x = 25.193 The comparison of device performance using a binary blend of P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 with a ternary blend of P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 employing the same PDI, NDI, and IDT component molar ratio showed that the ternary blend showed an inferior performance, due to the ambiguous phase separation.
Angular-shaped NDI was designed to increase the LUMO level of polymers.194 Although the acceptor polymers having this unit showed a low PCE of 0.32%, one of the highest Voc up to 0.94 V was achieved for all-PSCs.
5.3. PDI-based acceptor polymers
PDI-based copolymers generally have low-lying LUMO levels of approximately ∼3.9 eV, and an absorption edge of approximately 650 nm. Thus, the D–A-type donors with narrow bandgaps and deep HOMO energy levels are suitable partners to harvest more photons and achieve a high Voc over 1.0 V. In contrast, some of PDI-based copolymers have also been employed to construct the all-PSCs using P3HT as a donor.
Regio-regular copolymer (r-PDI-diTh) and regio-irregular copolymer (i-PDI-diTh) based on bithiophene and PDI units were developed (Fig. 24, Table 8).195 This copolymer r-PDI-diTh showed superior performance to i-PDI-diTh. Utilizing r-PDI-diTh with P3HT as the donor and employing the inverted device configuration, a PCE of 2.17% was achieved by the appropriate vertical phase separation. The chain-growth polymerization method was applied to the synthesis of copolymers based on bithiophene and PDI units, and these copolymers showed compatible PCEs compared to those synthesized by conventional methods.196
 Fig. 24  Chemical structures of PDI-based acceptor polymers. 
A–A-type copolymers (P1-Cn and P2-Cn) composed of PDI and BT units were reported.197 Due to the presence of an ethynyl spacer between PDI and BT units, P2-Cn showed red-shifted absorption and high electron mobility. However, all-PSCs based on polymeric acceptors and P3HT showed that the performance of P1-Cn device surpassed that based on P2-Cn, due to the high-lying LUMO energy level, efficient charge separation, and good film morphologies.
5.4. Other acceptor polymers
The low absorption coefficient and fixed low-lying LUMO energy levels of NDI/PDI-based acceptor polymers are the major limitations for the PCEs of P3HT-based all-PSCs. Thus, new electron-accepting building units have been designed and applied to develop the acceptor polymers for all-PSCs.
New imide-annealed electron-accepting (TPTI) and dicyanomethylene-annealed units (CN) were synthesized and used to develop acceptor polymers with different monomer combinations.198 All-PSCs comprising PNPDI and P3HT showed a PCE of 0.75%. Copolymers having a thiazole-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole unit (DPP2TzT) showed a broad absorbance up to the NIR region.199 All-PSCs based on P3HT- and DPP2TzT-containing acceptors showed PCEs ranging from 1.5% to 3.0% and the solar cells exhibited a broad spectral response from 350 nm to 950 nm. An acceptor polymer (P-BNBP-CDT) composed of an alternating double B–N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) and a cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene (CDT) unit exhibited strong absorption in the visible range of 500–650 nm and suitable LUMO/HOMO energy levels for P3HT.200P-BNBP-CDT showed a PCE of 1.76% (Fig. 25, Table 8).

Ie et al. utilized fluorinated naphthobisthiadiazole (FNTz) to synthesize FNTz-T-BTz.201 P3HT:FNTz-T-BTz-based all-PSC showed reasonable photovoltaic characteristics of up to 1.13% PCE with a high Voc of 0.96 V. This efficiency was due to the good charge transporting characteristics and suitable blend film morphologies in the blend films.
6. P3HT:NFAs-based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvents
Halogen-free organic solvents are sensible alternatives as process solvents against conventional halogenated toxic solvents. The active layers of OSCs are mostly processed by halogenated toxic solvents such as CB, o-DCB, and CF in a cell size in laboratory. However, these solvents cannot be used for the fabrication of a module size OSC toward mass production due to environmental issues. Thus, the fabrication of OSCs by halogenated toxic solvents is one of the crucial limiting factors for the commercialization of OSCs. In this context, the development of P3HT:NFAs-based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated green solvents is urgently needed. However, studies on this topic are still underway, and the basic design principle of the NFAs that is compatible with the nonhalogenated green solvent process to obtain a reasonable performance of the OSCs is still a severe challenge. For the advances in D–A-type donors:NFA-based OSCs processed by various nonhalogenated green solvents, the readers are referred to some important reviews in ref. 202 and 203. In this review, we focus on the research progress in the field of green-solvent-processed P3HT:NFA-based OSCs.
Anthony and Malliaras et al. utilized toluene as a nonhalogenated solvent to produce the P3HT:2,3-CN2-TCPS-Pn (1c) blend film.204 This film formed large micro-size crystals, and the corresponding OSC showed a PCE of 0.43%. The utilization of a toluene halogenated o-DCB mixed solvent improved the film morphology by suppressing the crystallization of pentacene during film formation, resulting in the increase of PCE to 1.29%.152
Sonar et al. utilized toluene as a process solvent to fabricate the P3HT:TFPDPP blend film, which showed a PCE of 1.00%.127 In contrast, the use of CF resulted in a low PCE of 0.25%.
Brabec et al. utilized IDTBR to develop R2R production of OSC modules in various solvents.48 Among the examined solvents, xylene and o-methyl anisole were effective, achieving high PCEs of 3.71 and 5.41%, respectively. Using methyl naphthalene as an additive to the xylene solution further improved the PCE from 3.71 to 4.99%.
Peng et al. developed a novel NFA named TrBTIC.149 They found that P3HT can be readily dissolved in 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) under warm conditions and slowly crystallized at room temperature. By using this phenomenon, pre-phase separation between P3HT and TrBTIC occurred before the deposition of the solutions, which was tuned by adjusting the aging time. In fact, in this study, it was found that 40 min of aging time was the most appropriate phase separation time for this blend, producing uniform nanowires and favourable interpenetrating networks for exciton dissociation and charge transport, which resulted in a high PCE of 8.25% (Fig. 26).

As the polarity of the solvent has a substantial influence on controlling the miscibility of P3HT and NFA, the blend film morphology should be dictated by both the solvent polarity and the polar character of P3HT and NFA. Thus, the dipole moment of the compounds can be a decisive factor for controlling the overall morphology of the blend film depending on the solvent polarity. Considering this, Ie et al. focused on the correlation between the dipole moment of NFAs and the process solvents because most nonhalogenated green solvents have a low dipole moment.205 Two NFAs named TzTz-NI and PDTz-NI were developed. The symmetric fused central units of thiazolothiazole (TzTz), pyradinodithiazole (PDTz) contributed to decreasing dipole moment of the molecules. These acceptors showed improved PCEs when CB was replaced with o-xylene. The representative NFA of IDTBR showed the same tendency. In contrast, BTz-Np bearing a high dipole moment showed a decreased PCE. The o-xylene-processed P3HT:TzTz-NI and P3HT:PDTz-NI blend films showed smooth film morphologies and higher miscibility than the CB-processed films, which was attributed to the better film-forming characteristics (Fig. 27).
Very recently, Zhang et al. synthesized a new NFA named ZY-4Cl.124 THF-processed P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based cell exhibited a record high PCE of 9.46%.

7. Large area fabrication of P3HT:NFA-based OSCs
In this section, we introduce a brief overview on the process technology of OSCs for large area fabrication and then discuss the upscaling procedure from the cell size to the module size for the efficient P3HT:NFA-based OSCs.
7.1. Requirement for large-scale OSC fabrication
The large-area printing process of OSCs is the frontrunner in organic electronics research and development. Thus, it is regarded as one of the beginning footsteps towards the commercialization of OSCs. Donors and acceptors, which are solution-processable, of low cost, and insensitive to the fabrication method, should be employed to fabricate the actual large area OSCs. However, the number of materials that fulfilled these points is still limited. Generally, spin-coating is a popular technique to prepare active layers of OSCs in the laboratory. Despite being the most approving choice, this method is not entirely applicable for large volume production since it leads to several unintentional and bewildering variations in fabricating device processing, affecting the overall PCE of the device. In addition, the loss of more than 90% of materials during spin-coating is also a problem. Therefore, for relatively long and flexible substrates, large-area R2R methodologies are accomplished for efficient device fabrication (Fig. 28).206

7.2. Towards the P3HT:NFA-based OSCs: from lab to fab
Because of the low PCE of the P3HT-based OSCs (usually below 4%), only D–A-type polymer:fullerene-based OSCs were explored for the production in module size.207 In this area, a comprehensive research on the large-scale production of OSCs from the lab to the industry has been well documented by Krebs et al.,208 who discussed about the complete manufacturing process in detail. Later, they have established the utility of the OSC technology by demonstrating complete R2R production of a low bandgap copolymer, poly(dithienothiophene-co-dialkoxybenzothiadiazole) (PDTTDABT) with PC61BM in air, using slot-die coating, employing flexible substrates in their research. Solar cell modules embracing 16 serially connected cells were prepared with a total module active area of 96 cm2 (Fig. 29).209

IDTBR is the newest NFA that is perfectly complementary to low cost P3HT-based donors, proposed by S. Holliday and McCulloch et al.95 Utilizing IDTBR with P3HT, a practical research of fully solution-processed R2R compatible modules was further performed by Machui et al. for the first time.48 Nonhalogenated green solvents were also utilized to realize the R2R process, which is fully compatible with industrial requirements. As IDTBR had a reasonably good solubility in various solvents, the blending condition of the active layer was optimized with respect to the solubility of P3HT. The solubility requirement of P3HT was fixed at more than 10 mg mL−1 at 90 °C for all the solvents. Thus, the P3HT-solvent solubility distance as a function of the boiling point of the solvent was established (Fig. 30). Finally, it was revealed that solvents located closer to the green box in Fig. 30 provide better performances.

The upper horizontal gray line (1), the lower gray line, (2) and the vertical dashed line (3) represent boundary conditions. Solvents in the green box are defined as ‘suitable for processing’ SD: slot-die. Reproduced with permission from ref. 48. Copyright 2018 Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Furthermore, these OSCs were successfully produced in module size. These OSCs are composed of 12 individual cells monolithically connected in series with an active total area of 64 cm2 (8 × 8 cm). One individual cell, including the interconnect, has a length of 0.67 cm (8 cm/12 cells) and an area of 5.33 cm2 (64 cm2/12 cells) (Fig. 31). A total module area of 60 cm2 could be fabricated, and a PCE of 5.0% was achieved with a halogenated solvent, which was almost retained when the active layers of the modules were processed from a nonhalogenated green solvent (4.7%).

Thus, this is the first time that the P3HT:NFA-based OSCs were produced in module size with almost 5.00% stable PCE, which provides new perspectives in this research field.
8. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we summarized the development of NFAs compatible with the low cost and wide bandgap donor polymer P3HT. Some important classes of electron-accepting materials have emerged to accelerate the advancement in this field. After the progressive rise of narrow band gap D–A-type donor polymers, the P3HT-based OSC research became insufficient. However, it is still a relevant research field as many high performance NFAs with a unique molecular design are continuously emerging. As recent research studies are approaching the commercial barrier of almost 9.0–10.0% PCE,125,126,149 for P3HT:NFA-based OSCs, the commercialization of the OSCs is close. The key points toward further development of P3HT-based OSCs are summarized as follows:
(i) The use of P3HT as a donor is appropriate, as it has high thermal stability, suitable molecular properties, and good hole mobility. In terms of industrial aspects, the advantages of the lowest cost among all the donors, bulk availability, and excellent batch-to-batch purity make it a promising and distinct candidate.
(ii) Development of NFAs is the most important subject for the commercialization of P3HT-based OSCs. A question to be solved is how to obtain a compatible NFA, particularly for P3HT. Here, we propose some guidelines:
(a) A rigid molecular backbone to avoid the energetic disorder within the molecule.
(b) Good solubility to ease the fabrication of uniform thin films. This chemical modification also correlates with the molecular packing in the blend film.
(c) An appropriate LUMO energy level of approximately −3.3 to −3.6 eV (matching with the LUMO of P3HT ∼2.8 eV) and a minimum LUMO energy offset with a proper electron transporting backbone is preferable to attain the maximum Voc and also reduce the energy loss.
(d) Semi-crystalline to amorphous nature. As P3HT has crystalline nature in the film after thermal annealing, semi-crystalline to amorphous nature of NFAs should be anticipated to prevent the excess aggregation in the blend film.
(e) Comparable electron mobility with that of P3HT in the blend.
(f) Good miscibility with both P3HT and a nonhalogenated green solvent.
These guidelines may be helpful for further enhancement of the OSC performance, which leads to the accomplishment of a PCE of up to 15% in near future. Considering several factors such as the efficiency, stability, device fabrication, and cost for OSC commercialization, P3HT:NFA-based OSCs are remarkably promising.
