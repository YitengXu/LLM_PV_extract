    , Accepted 20th April 2012First published on 24th April 2012AbstractDevelopment of efficient Pt-free photofuel cells employing two different electrolytes containing various biomass derivatives and an I3−/I− redox solution for the anode and cathode sides, respectively, is described. These new, separate-type photofuel cells exhibit good photoelectrochemical performance under simulated solar-light irradiation.
Energy production by using solar irradiation is one of the most important challenges in science today. Owing to their high activities and chemical stabilities, systems employing TiO2 as photocatalysts have been the focus of much attention in this area. In fact, TiO2 thin film photocatalysts have been widely investigated in the context of several applications, such as the purification of toxic compounds in polluted water and air,1–5 dye-sensitized solar cells,6–8 hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting9–14 and self-cleaning and antifogging materials.15,16
In novel approaches for energy production, TiO2 photocatalysts have been employed in photofuel cells (PFCs). Kaneko et al. in 2006 developed a system that generates electricity photoelectrochemically via the decomposition of various biomass derivatives by employing UV-light irradiation of a nanoporous TiO2 thin film photoanode and oxygen reduction to form H2O at a Pt cathode.17 The utilization of biomass and bio-related substances as renewable energy resources has opened up enormous opportunities for solutions to the current energy problem. As a result, these systems have considerable practical significance.
However, TiO2 photocatalysts operate only under UV light irradiation (λ < 400 nm) and, as such, only 3–5% of the solar energy reaching the earth can be utilized. Because of this limitation, the development of visible-light responsive TiO2 materials is urgently needed and improvements of the conversion efficiencies of the devices are also required. Cathodic losses during oxygen reduction, especially those associated with cathodic activation like that occurring in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), are one of the key factors influencing the performance of PFCs.18–21 In MFCs, the use of several electron acceptors with high cathodic reduction rates, such as hydrogen peroxide,22 ferricyanide,23 permanganate,24 potassium persulfate25 and ferric ions (Fe3+/Fe2+),26 has been explored to improve performance. However, single electrolyte systems typically employed in PFCs hamper the utilization of these types of electron acceptors.
To overcome this drawback, we have devised a new strategy that is based on the use of a separate-type photofuel cell (SPFC), as shown in Fig. 1. In this novel design, the separation of the PFC into two compartments, comprised of the anode and cathode, enables the use of two different electrolytes. Various biomass derivatives are incorporated as fuels in the electrolyte solution present in the anode compartment. The electrolyte in the cathode compartment contains an I3−/I− redox solution, as is typically used in dye-sensitized solar cells, to enhance oxygen reduction at the electrode. It should be noted that we have previously developed visible-light responsive TiO2 (Vis-TiO2) thin films, created by utilizing a radio frequency magnetron sputtering deposition (RF-MS) method, which act as photocatalysts for the water splitting reaction.27–30 The use of this type of thin film as the anode in the new design leads to an efficient SPFC that operates under solar light.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the new SPFC. 
The Vis-TiO2 thin film as an anode was prepared on an ITO-glass plate by using the RF-MS method employing an O-Naru Tech N-SP-12 following the procedure described previously.27–30 Typical experimental conditions are as follows: the target material was a TiO2 plate, commercially available from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd. (grade: 99.99%); the distance between the target and the substrate was 75 mm; the sputtering gas was Ar (purity: 99.995%); Ar pressure in the chamber was 2.0 Pa; the sputtering power was 300 W; the substrate temperature (TS) during deposition was 873 K and the deposition time was 300 min. For comparison purposes, a TiO2 thin film deposited at a TS of 473 K, which absorbs only UV light (UV-TiO2 thin film), was also prepared. The film thicknesses of the Vis-TiO2 and UV-TiO2 thin films were determined to be nearly identical at 3 μm on the basis of SEM observations.
The setup of the newly developed SPFC is shown in Fig. 1. A Pyrex glass container (L 35 mm × W 70 mm × H 60 mm) was separated into two compartments by using a Nafion film and suffused with different electrolytes of 0.50 M Na2SO4 aq., containing various biomass derivatives as fuels for the anode side (see Table 1), and Na2SO4 aq. containing an I3−/I− redox solution of 0.50 M NaI and 0.025 M I2 aqueous solution for the cathode side. The pH of each solution was adjusted to 2 by adding 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Vis-TiO2 or UV-TiO2 thin films were used as the anode, and a carbon rod (diameter: 5 mm, length: 30 mm) commercially available from Nilaco Corp. or a Pt mesh (8 mm × 30 mm) was used as the cathode.

In electricity generation, the anode was irradiated with light from a PEC-L 11 solar simulator made by Peccell Technologies, Inc. at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) under stirring. The area irradiated was set at 8 mm × 15 mm. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the SPFCs were recorded with an HZ3000 potentiostat (Hokuto Denko Corp.).

Fig. 2 shows photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of various SPFCs under simulated solar-light irradiation at AM 1.5. In these systems, the anode is a Vis-TiO2 thin film, the cathode is carbon or Pt, the anolyte is aqueous Na2SO4 (Na2SO4 aq.) containing 10 vol% methanol, and the catholyte is Na2SO4 aq. in the presence or absence of the I3−/I− redox solution. The result obtained when glycerin is employed as the fuel in place of methanol is also displayed in Fig. 2. The I–V characteristics of the SPFCs using carbon and Pt as cathodes were improved by the introduction of the I3−/I− redox solution, indicating that oxygen reduction, which is well-known to be the rate-limiting step in general PFCs, is promoted at the cathode.

I–V curves of the SPFCs under simulated solar-light irradiation at AM 1.5 under various conditions. Anode: Vis-TiO2 thin film, cathode: carbon rod or Pt, anolyte: Na2SO4 aq. containing 10 vol% methanol or glycerin, catholyte: Na2SO4 aq. with or without I3−/I− redox solution. 
In systems containing only Na2SO4 aq. as the catholyte, photo-formed holes in the TiO2 electrode oxidize organic compounds (i.e., methanol) and photo-formed electrons migrate to the counter electrode where they reduce oxygen, resulting in the generation of electricity. The reactions taking place at the anode and cathode are displayed in eqn (1) and (2). Anode: CH3OH + H2O + 6h+ → CO2 + 6H+(1) Cathode: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(2)The total reaction corresponds to the complete oxidation of methanol to form CO2 and H2O. The theoretical maximum cell voltage for this system is calculated to be 1.29 V based on the potential difference between the conduction band edge (ECB) of TiO2 (−0.06 V, vs. SCE at pH 0) and the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V, vs. SCE at pH 0). However, when using a carbon cathode, the open circuit voltage (VOC) is 0.46 V, a value that is only one-third of the theoretical value of 1.29 V. This observation may be a consequence of various side reactions occurring in the first step of cathodic O2 reduction.31
On the other hand, in the presence of the I3−/I− redox solution, the reaction given in eqn (3) occurs. Cathode: I−3 + 2e− → 3I−(3)In this case, the theoretical VOC is calculated to be 0.60 V based on the potential difference between ECB of TiO2 (−0.06 V, vs. SCE at pH 0) and the redox potential of I3−/I− (0.54 V, vs. SCE at pH 0).32 This data suggests that O2 reduction at the cathode is theoretically preferable to the reduction reaction of I3− to generate I− ions. In fact, the lower activation energy of the I3− reduction reaction compared to that for O2 reduction effectively results in a significant increase in the photocurrent. It is noteworthy that the design of a separate-type container system enables the introduction into the catholyte of the I3−/I− redox couple, which acts as a more efficient scavenger than O2. Moreover, the system using a carbon cathode exhibits the same performance as one using Pt in the presence of the I3−/I− redox couples. This observation indicates that the cost-efficient carbon electrode can be used as an alternative to a Pt electrode.
The observations described above demonstrate that the new system behaves as a highly efficient PFC. In contrast, the I–V characteristics are poorer when the UV-TiO2 thin film is utilized as the anode in place of the Vis-TiO2 thin film (Fig. S1†). This performance difference is likely to be a result of the different visible-light responsivities of the films. The UV-Vis transmission spectrum of the UV-TiO2 thin film shows an absorption band in the UV-wavelength region below 380 nm, while intense absorption at wavelengths longer than 400 nm with an absorption edge located 600 nm is seen in the Vis-TiO2 thin film spectrum (Fig. S2†).
The results of the photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that the Vis-TiO2 thin film acts as a photoanode under visible-light irradiation. The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the film were determined using cyclic voltammetry, performed over a scan range from −0.9 to 1.0 V vs. SCE on a 0.1 M aq. HClO4 containing 10 vol% methanol under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 and 450 nm) generated by utilizing a 500 W Xe lamp XEF-501S (San-Ei Electric Inc.) and optical filters. As shown in Fig. S3†, negligible photocurrent was observed when using the UV-TiO2 thin film, whereas visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 and 450 nm) of the Vis-TiO2 thin film produced a large photocurrent. The results indicate that the use of a Vis-TiO2 thin film for the anode of the SPFC enables the effective utilization of visible light in simulated solar light.
For continuous electricity generation, the reoxidation of I− ions into I3− ions must occur efficiently in the presence of air. The propensity to regenerate I3− ions was investigated by using an alternative system, which contains only I− ions in the catholyte. Fig. 3 shows a time profile of the short-circuit current (ISC) for an SPFC using Na2SO4 aq. containing 0.50 M NaI as the catholyte under simulated solar-light irradiation at AM 1.5 for 5 h. The system is comprised of a Vis-TiO2 thin film as the anode, a carbon rod as the cathode and Na2SO4 aq. containing 10 vol% methanol as the anolyte. Although the photocurrent was initially only 0.10 mA, it gradually increased and reached 0.47 mA after a 1 h irradiation period. On the other hand, when no I3−/I− redox couples were used, the system exhibited a much smaller photocurrent of less than 0.10 mA (see Fig. 2). These observations demonstrate that the I− ions are easily oxidized by O2 in air to form I3− ions, producing equilibrium concentrations of I− and I3− ions corresponding to the balanced formula given in eqn (4). (4)As a consequence, redox cycles are proven to be able to progress at the carbon electrode. The system displayed almost a constant photocurrent over a 4 h period, indicating its high durability. It should be noted that the total reaction occurring under equilibrium control corresponds to the complete oxidation of methanol to generate CO2 and H2O in the presence or absence of the I3−/I− redox couple. The IPCE (incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency) of this system after a 5 h irradiation period was determined to be 42.6% and 1.3% using calculations based on the number of incident photons measured at λ = 360 and 420 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Time profile of the short-circuit current for an SPFC using Na2SO4 aq. containing 0.50 M NaI as the catholyte under simulated solar-light irradiation at AM 1.5. The system is comprised of a Vis-TiO2 thin film as the anode, a carbon rod as the cathode and Na2SO4 aq. containing 10 vol% methanol as the anolyte. 
In order to further improve the performance of the SPFC developed in this effort, various biomass derivatives were employed as fuel in place of methanol. The resulting VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the systems using a Vis-TiO2 thin film as the anode, a carbon rod as the cathode and Na2SO4 aq. containing I3−/I− redox solution, are summarized in Table 1. The FF, corresponding to the ratio of actual maximum power (Pmax) over the theoretical maximum power, was calculated by employing the relationship given in eqn (5). (5)In all cases, the photovoltaic performance of systems containing biomass derivatives as fuels were improved over those not containing fuels. Among those explored, the system using glycerin as fuel displays the highest performance with a VOC of 0.72 V and a JSC of 0.57 mA cm−2 (see also Fig. 2). The results demonstrate that efficient SPFCs can be fabricated utilizing a design in which biomass derivatives and I3−/I− redox couples are utilized.
In conclusion, the studies described above have led to the development of a new, separate-type photofuel cell (SPFC), in which two different electrolytes containing various biomass derivatives and an I3−/I− redox solution are employed for the respective separated anode and cathode compartments. The introduction of various biomass derivatives to the anode solution and the I3−/I− redox couple to the cathode solution lead to significant improvements in the electrochemical performance of the SPFC. Consequently, even the system using carbon as the cathode was found to exhibit a performance that is comparable to one using Pt. Furthermore, the SPFC was observed to operate efficiently under simulated solar-light irradiation due to the presence of a visible-light responsive Vis-TiO2 thin film as the anode. Overall, the new SPFC is effective as a highly efficient, solar light PFC.
