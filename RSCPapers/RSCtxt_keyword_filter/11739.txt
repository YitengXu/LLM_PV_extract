    , Accepted 23rd June 2020First published on 24th June 2020AbstractWide-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are in high demand for constructing efficient ternary or tandem organic solar cells (OSCs), yet the scarcity of high performance wide-bandgap NFAs remains an important issue that need exploration and perfection. Here we designed and synthesized two NFAs (namely IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC), featuring an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core and electron-withdrawing benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-carbonitrile flanks. With optical bandgaps of 1.93 eV (IDT-BC) and 1.89 eV (IDT-C8-BC), respectively, they were both investigated for application in OSCs. By using polymer donor PBDB-T, single-junction OSCs based on two new NFAs are fabricated, giving power conversion efficiency (PCE) records of 6.3% (IDT-BC) and 7.3% (IDT-C8-BC). This work broadens the scope of developing new wide-bandgap NFAs with both high efficiency and easy accessibility.
In the last decade, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted enormous attention due to their unique merits such as easy fabrication, flexibility, and solution-processability.1–9 Recently, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become one of the research hotspots in the field and have pushed the organic solar cell efficiency to new levels: a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 16.5% has been achieved in single-junction OSC devices.10,11 Compared to common fullerene derivatives, NFAs have an undisputed advantage due to their relatively simple synthesis, ease of purification, and adjustable energy levels and bandgaps.12–17 As a result, interest in the research and development of new non-fullerene acceptor materials, as well as in their combination with various donors such as polymers, has been greatly stimulated.
Generally, in order to prepare a high-performance OSC, various materials are used to increase or broaden the absorption range of sunlight.18–24 Therefore, the ternary strategy and the tandem strategy have attracted widespread attention. Furthermore, in order to create ideal electronic devices, small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) play very important roles in ternary and tandem solar cells, due to their versatile chemical structures and tunable optoelectronic properties. We can see that ternary solar cells and tandem OSCs based on non-fullerene SMAs already have very high PCEs.25–27 However, common indoor light sources typically have an emission spectrum between 400 and 700 nm, with a narrow spectral range and a lower intensity than the standard solar spectrum. Furthermore, we noticed that most NFAs are narrow bandgap or medium bandgap, and only a few wide-bandgap acceptors have been reported.28–32 Considering that there are many high-performance wide or medium bandgap polymer donors (such as PBDB-T) available in the polymer solar cell (PSC) field, there is a need to develop more efficacious wide-bandgap SMAs and devices that can achieve excellent performance under indoor light conditions.
When designing wide-bandgap SMAs, the A–D–A structure is the most frequently adopted strategy. For example, in 2017, the Peng group reported the design and synthesis of a high-efficiency small-molecule acceptor (SFBRCN) based on a 3D-structured alkoxy substituted spirobifluorene core.28 Huang et al. showed that two novel wide-bandgap SMAs (IDT-TBA and IDTT-TBA) also work well with ternary solar cells. With the rapid development of the field of OSCs, the application of indoor light sources has attracted more and more attention.31 In 2019, Hou et al. designed a non-fullerene wide-bandgap acceptor called IO-4Cl and blended it with a polymer donor called PBDB-TF to obtain a photoactive layer whose absorption spectrum matched that of indoor light sources. As a result, the organic photovoltaic cell (1 cm2) showed a PCE of 26.1% under light-emitting diode illumination of 1000 lux (2700 K).30 Therefore, in order to fully exploit the potential of tandem and ternary OSCs and increase the photoelectric conversion rate inside, it is crucial to design and develop excellent wide-bandgap acceptors. Moreover, the development of wide-bandgap NFAs is a very effective solution for improving and optimizing the performance of OSC devices.
In this work, we study two wide-bandgap SMAs IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC, based on a 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core and using a weak electron-withdrawing group (7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-carbonitrile) for the terminal group (Fig. 1a). Since the nature of the side chains has a large impact on the molecular packing, the replacement of these relatively bulky side chains with simple linear alkyl chains could potentially improve the packing ability and the charge transport mobility of these molecules.33,34 The optimized OSC device fabricated with PBDB-T as a donor and IDT-BC as an acceptor achieved a PCE of up to 6.3% (and 7.3% for the IDT-C8-BC based device). Given their easy accessibility and considerable photovoltaic performance, IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC offer a pathway to the development of wide bandgap NFA systems with tunable electronics and optical spectra.

The detailed synthetic routes toward the target structures IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The key synthetic step of both compounds involves a Stille coupling reaction. The molecular structures were fully characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. Both IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC are readily soluble, with good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) at room temperature, because of their solubilizing alkyl substituents. In addition, both compounds exhibit good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 438 °C for IDT-BC and 416 °C for IDT-C8-BC in a nitrogen atmosphere, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S4, ESI†).

Fig. 1a shows the normalized neat film UV-vis absorption spectra of the two small-molecule acceptors IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC along with the polymer donor PBDB-T; the normalized solution UV-vis absorption spectra are provided in Fig. S2a (ESI†), and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. When coming to the film state, the maximum absorption peaks were 580 and 600 nm for IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC, respectively, and a clear red shift was observed. The red shift indicates strong intermolecular stacking in their neat films. The absorption edges of the IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC thin films are located at 645 and 676 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eopt) of 1.92 and 1.83 eV, respectively. The extended thin-film absorption of the polymer donor and SMAs has its main absorption band in the range of 450–700 nm. After blending with the polymer donor PBDB-T as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), both systems display a wider absorption spectrum from 450–700 nm. Moreover, the blend films show two equally strong absorption peaks, suggesting good compatibility of the two SMAs with PBDB-T, which is beneficial for achieving high photovoltaic performance.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC were carried out to evaluate the energy levels. A ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (−4.8 eV versus the vacuum level) was used as an external standard. The LUMOs/HOMOs of IDT-BC and IDT-C8-BC were approximated to be −3.57 eV/−5.50 eV and −3.50 eV/−5.39 eV, respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 1d and Fig. S3a (ESI†). Notably, the high-lying LUMO energy level of IDT-C8-BC can indisputably benefit VOC in OSC devices.35–37
The photovoltaic properties of the IDT based wide bandgap acceptors were evaluated by examining the performance of OSCs with PBDB-T as the electron donor. The device fabrication conditions for both the PBDB-T:IDT-C8-BC and PBDB-T:IDT-BC active layers were a donor to acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 (wt%), and an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (device area = 0.11 cm2). Thermal annealing was applied to tune the microstructures of each active layer, and detailed optimization conditions are presented in Tables S1–S8 (ESI†). Table 2 summarizes the parameters of the optimized OSCs with PBDB-T:IDT-BC and PBDB-T:IDT-C8-BC as the active layer measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) conditions. Fig. 2a depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized OSCs.

As an effective method to improve the device performance, it was reported that thermal annealing of the active layer can tune the active layer morphology to favorable microstructures to increase JSC and the FF.38–40 We found that for devices with PBDB-T:IDT-C8-BC and PBDB-T:IDT-BC as the active layers, thermal annealing is crucial for device performance. Specifically, as shown in Table 2, the “as-cast” device of PBDB-T:IDT-C8-BC showed a slightly lower PCE of 5.6%, with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.21 mA cm−2, and a modest fill-factor (FF) of 54.2%. However, after thermal annealing at 90 °C for 10 min, the FF was dramatically increased from 54.2% to 67.6%, JSC was enhanced from 9.21 mA cm−2 to 10.27 mA cm−2, and VOC was slightly reduced to 1.05 V, boosting the PCE from 5.6% to 7.3%. On the other hand, the devices with PBDB-T:IDT-BC as the active layer also performed differently upon thermal annealing. Compared with the “as-cast” devices, the annealed devices showed a slightly improved FF from 50.1% to 54.5%, decreased VOC from 1.14 V to 1.08 V, and effectively enhanced JSC from 8.76 mA cm−2 to 10.53 mA cm−2, leading to an increased PCE from 5.0% to 6.3%. These results show that IDT-C8-BC has better controllability than IDT-BC, and it requires lower temperature treatment to achieve the optimal conditions. It is noteworthy that VOC for the as-cast or annealed devices of IDT-BC is slightly higher than IDT-C8-BC, which was contrary to our initial expectation based on the lower LUMO energy level of IDT-BC. This can be attributed to the increased degree of energy disorder caused by the elongation of the alkyl chain in IDT-C8-BC, which result in the reduced VOC.41,42
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the “as cast” and optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The annealed IDT-C8-BC devices show EQE values higher than those of the “as cast” devices in the range of 450–700 nm, and the EQE response of the IDT-BC based devices remains higher than that of its “as cast” devices in the range of 350–700 nm. Especially, the EQE maxima of the annealed IDT-C8-BC blend devices is 68.5% at 600 nm, and the IDT-BC devices show 64.5% at 580 nm, which are in good agreement with the maximum peak of the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films in Fig. S2b (ESI†). JSC of the optimized IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC devices integrated from the EQE spectra is 9.56 and 9.22 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC values obtained from the experimental devices (with ∼1% deviation, Table 2).
Apart from the J–V and EQE measurements, the charge recombination and transport properties can provide further information on the origin of the differences in device performance. Considering the backward performance, the ‘as-cast’ devices were excluded from the examination of recombination features and charge carrier mobility. First, to understand the recombination profiles, J–V measurements with various incident light intensity were performed. It has been widely reported that VOC and the incident light intensity follow the expression of VOC ∞ nkT/qln(I),31 where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. The n value is usually in the range of 1 to 2, where a value of 1 stands for a trap-free condition and a value other than 1 stands for trap-assisted recombination,43 reflecting the extent of carrier traps across the active layer or at the interface between the organic semiconductor and the electrode. The fitted data are presented in Fig. 3a; the values of the fitted slope are 1.00 and 1.26 for the optimized IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC devices. These values suggest that the optimized IDT-C8-BC devices do not suffer trap-assisted recombination, but the optimized IDT-BC devices have existed portion carrier traps.44–47 On the other hand, we can analyze the charge extraction of the optimized IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC devices by fitting JSC as a function of the incident light intensity plotted on a log scale. The relationship can be described as JSC ∞ Iα, where α is the power factor, and the value of α is in the range of 0 to 1 (0 < α ≦ 1), and the smaller the value of α, the lower the number of carriers extracted prior to recombination.43,44 As illustrated in Fig. 3b, we have obtained α values of 1.00 for both the optimized IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC devices, indicating that all charges were efficiently extracted before being recombined or bimolecular recombination losses are negligible under short-circuit conditions.

Dark current density of (c) electron-only diodes and (d) hole-only diodes. The solid lines are the fits to the experimental data according to eqn (S1) (ESI†). 
Second, the charge transport properties, i.e. the electron and hole mobility, were determined by fitting the dark current density with the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model (details in Table S10, ESI†). The electron-only diodes were fabricated with the device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PhenoNaDPO/active layer/PhenoNaDPO/Ag and hole-only diodes with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag. The optimized devices of IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC exhibited electron mobility of 3.00 × 10−4 and 1.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, as presented in Fig. 3c, and hole mobility of 2.85 × 10−4 and 2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, as presented in Fig. 3d, respectively. The optimized IDT-C8-BC devices have more balanced hole/electron mobility (μh/μe = 0.95, Table S10, ESI†), which leads to a higher FF of 67.6%, in line with reports that more balanced mobility can reduce carrier recombination of optimized devices and increase the FF.48 In contrast, the optimized IDT-BC devices have an unbalanced hole/electron mobility (μh/μe = 2.02, Table S10, ESI†), which further explains the reason for the lower FF.
The favorable thin-film morphologies have played an important role in the enhancement of the device performance, and thus atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to study the phase separation of the IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC based systems.27,49–52 Meanwhile, IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC have favorable miscibility with the host donor of PBDB-T from AFM and TEM images; higher miscibility provides a low driving force for phase separation, facilitating efficient charge dissociation, and improving the charge transfer ability of the blend.53–55 As presented in Fig. 4, AFM height images of the IDT-C8-BC “as cast” and optimized blend film showed a root mean square roughness (Rq) of 1.57 nm and 0.88 nm, and the IDT-BC “as cast” and optimized blend film showed a root mean square roughness (Rq) of 1.48 nm and 0.94 nm, respectively. It can be observed from the AFM phase images that the IDT-C8-BC blend film has an appropriate domain size after annealing treatment in Fig. 4f. However, after the annealing treatment of the IDT-BC blend film, although the value of the root mean square roughness was reduced, the domain size was not changed as shown in Fig. 4g and h. Previous studies have shown that smaller aggregated domain sizes further gave more mixed donor/acceptor phases with larger interfacial areas to improve the charge transfer efficiency and restrict charge carrier recombination.1,53–59 Therefore, after thermal annealing conditions, the blend film of IDT-C8-BC has become more uniform and smooth with smaller aggregated domain sizes, which is beneficial for interface contact and charge collection, which is in line with the photovoltaic performance in Table 1 (for details, see Fig. S4, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a–d) AFM height images, (e–h) AFM phase images and (i–l) TEM images of (a, e and i) IDT-C8-BC “as cast” devices; (b, f and j) IDT-C8-BC optimized devices; (c, g and k) IDT-BC “as cast” devices; and (d, h and l) IDT-BC optimized devices. 
On the other hand, the TEM images also clearly displayed the morphology of the thin films. As presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the neat film TEM image of PBDB-T exhibits distinctly uniform and large fibrous features, while the neat films of IDT-C8-BC and IDT-BC have different morphologies, IDT-C8-BC with larger domain sizes and IDT-BC with more compact domain. In Fig. 4i–l the TEM blend films of IDT-C8-BC had obvious fibrous features after thermal annealing conditions, but the blend films of IDT-BC did not exhibit the same fibrous features as the IDT-C8-BC blend film by annealing treatment. This result is dramatically similar to the AFM analysis; we believe this may be due to the C8 side chain introduced in IDT-C8-BT, which promotes more interpenetrating network structure in the blend film after thermal annealing, resulting in excellent photovoltaic performance of the IDT-C8-BC system.
In summary, two wide-bandgap NFAs were designed, synthesized and used to fabricate OSCs. The introduction of weak electron-withdrawing terminal groups led to enlarged bandgaps as compared to most previously reported IDT-based NFAs. When PBDB-T is employed as the donor polymer, single-junction OSCs with PCE up to 7.3% are achieved by the IDT-C8-BC based devices, demonstrating a ca. 16% enhancement compared with the IDT-BC based devices (6.3%). Since IDT-C8-BC was introduced into the C8 side chain, enhancing the packing ability and the charge transport mobility, more balanced hole/electron mobility was obtained for the IDT-C8-BC-based devices, and it will become easier to control the morphology of the active layer, improving the fill factor and device performance, which is conducive to processing and preparation. This contribution broadens the scope of the development of new wide-bandgap NFAs with high efficiency and accessibility for manufacturing efficient OPV devices.
