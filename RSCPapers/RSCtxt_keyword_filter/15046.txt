    , Accepted 24th June 2022First published on 14th July 2022AbstractThe power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) is limited by the large non-radiation energy loss (ΔEnr), which is due to the low fluorescence quantum efficiency (φF) of typical organic/polymer photovoltaic materials. In this manuscript, we report a polymer acceptor containing a B ← N unit with strong red fluorescence. The polymer, PBN-16, is the alternating copolymer of an electron-withdrawing B ← N-bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and an electron-donating 2,5-dithienyl-1,4-dichlorophenylene unit. PBN-16 exhibits φF of as high as 11% in thin film because of the near-unity φF of BNBP itself and the twisted configuration of the polymer backbone. Its all-polymer photovoltaic device shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.33 V and a PCE of 6.0% under AM 1.5G illumination as well as a VOC of 1.17 V and a PCE of 15.4% under indoor light-emitting diode illumination. Organic light-emitting diode devices using PBN-16 as an emissive material emit pure red light with a luminance efficiency of 0.99 cd A−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.67, 0.32). These results confirm that conjugated polymers or small molecules containing a B ← N unit are promising for organic solar cells with minimized energy loss and high PCE.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) utilize blends of small molecular/polymer electron donors and electron acceptors as the active layer. Compared with inorganic solar cells, OSCs have great merits of flexibility, lightweight and solution processing with low cost.1–10 In the past two decades, OSCs have attracted great attention and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has surpassed 18%.11 Despite the great progress, the PCE of OSCs is still lower than those of inorganic solar cells and perovskite solar cells.12–14 The PCE of OSCs is mainly limited by the large photon energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as the difference between the optical bandgap (Eg) of active layer materials and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of devices (Eloss = Eg − eVOC). Eloss of OSC devices is always about 0.6 eV, which is much larger than that of perovskite solar cells (about 0.4 eV).15–17 Therefore, the key to maximize the PCE of OSCs is to reduce the Eloss. The Eloss of OSCs mainly comes from large non-radiation energy loss (ΔEnr) as evidenced by the very low electroluminescence quantum efficiency of active layers of OSCs.17–21 This is predominantly due to the low fluorescence quantum efficiency (φF) of organic/polymer donor/acceptor materials in the active layers. Generally, φF of organic/polymer donor/acceptor materials is lower than 0.1%. Recently, the Y series small molecular acceptors, which were initially reported by Zou et al., have been reported with relatively high φF (φF = ca. 0.05 when dispersed in a polymer matrix).22,23 The resulting OSC devices show low Eloss and consequently exhibit a record-high PCE of 16–18%.22–34 Therefore, it is urgent to develop organic or polymer photovoltaic materials with high φF.
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been successfully commercialized and play an irreplaceable role in our daily life with the development of new emissive materials.35–38 A lot of highly fluorescent conjugated polymers have already been developed because of their applications in OLEDs.39,40 However, OSC device applications of these fluorescent conjugated polymers are rarely reported. This is mainly because these polymers are amorphous in thin film and exhibit low hole or electron mobilities.
In 2016, our group has developed double B ← N-bridged bipyridine (BNBP), which shows φF of 98% in solution.41 BNBP has been used as an electron-withdrawing unit to design polymer electron acceptors for OSC devices.42–46 All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) of BNBP-based polymer acceptors show a PCE exceeding 10% under simulated solar light illumination.45 In this manuscript, we report an efficient polymer acceptor based on a BNBP unit, PBN-16, which exhibits strong red fluorescence with φF of 64% in solution and φF of 11% in thin film. The high φF is due to the strong fluorescence of the BNBP unit itself and the twisted configuration of the polymer backbone. To our best knowledge, this is the highest φF for organic/polymer photovoltaic materials in thin film. The all-PSC device of PBN-16 shows a VOC of 1.33 V and a PCE of 6.0% under AM 1.5G illumination. Under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination under indoor conditions, the device exhibits a VOC of 1.17 V and a PCE of 15.2%. This work implies an avenue to design organic photovoltaic materials with minimized Eloss for high PCE.
As shown in Scheme 1(a), PBN-16 is the alternating copolymer of the electron-withdrawing BNBP unit and electron-donating 2,5-dithienyl-1,4-dichlorophenylene unit. To ensure good solubility of the polymer, 2-decyltetradecyl was selected as an alkyl chain. Scheme 1(b) displays the optimized configuration of the repeating unit of PBN-16, which is obtained by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The long and branched alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl for clarity. The dihedral angle between the 1,4-dichlorobenzene unit and the thienyl unit is 39.5° owing to the steric hindrance of the Cl atom. The dihedral angle between the thienyl unit and the BNBP unit is 22.5°. The two large dihedral angles indicate the twisted configuration of the polymer backbone of PBN-16. The twisted configuration may hinder a strong intermolecular interaction of polymer backbones in the solid state.
 Scheme 1  (a) Chemical structure of PBN-16. (b) Optimized configuration of the repeating unit of PBN-16. (c) Synthetic route of PBN-16. Reagents and conditions: (i) tributyl(thien-2-yl)stannane, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride, toluene, 120 °C; (ii) lithium diisopropylamide, trimethylstannyl chloride, tetrahydrofuran, from −78 °C to 25 °C; (iii) tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0), toluene, 120 °C. 
The synthetic routes of the monomer and the polymers are shown in Scheme 1(c). Stille Coupling of 1,4-dibromo-2,5-dichlorobenzene (1) and thiophene-2 trimethylstannyl afforded 2,2′-(2,5-dichloro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (2). Lithiation of 2 with lithium diisopropylamide and subsequent treatment with Me3SnCl produced the key monomer 3. The di-bromo monomer of the BNBP unit (4) was synthesized following the literature method.41 Finally, PBN-16 was prepared by Stille polymerization of 3 and 4. The chemical structure of PBN-16 is confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum and elemental analysis. As measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBN-16 is 42.7 kDa and the polydispersity (PDI) is 2.18.
PBN-16 is readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform and chlorobenzene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that PBN-16 has excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) of 349 °C at 5% weight loss (Fig. S3, ESI†). PBN-16 exhibits excellent chemical stability against oxygen, water, protic solvents (such as methanol) and amine nucleophiles (such as triethylamine). Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) pattern of PBN-16 in thin film. The (100), (200) and (300) diffraction peaks can be clearly observed, suggesting that PBN-16 is highly crystalline and adopts an edge-on orientation in thin film. According to the (100) peak, the lamellar distance of PBN-16 is estimated to be 22.06 nm.

Fig. 1 displays the absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra of PBN-16 in solution and in thin film. PBN-16 shows the maximum absorption wavelength of 599 nm both in THF solution and in thin film. The slight difference between the absorption spectra of PBN-16 in solution and film arises from the strong aggregation of the polymer in THF solution. The absorption spectra of PBN-16 in THF solution exhibits temperature dependence (Fig. S6, ESI†). With the increasing temperature, the absorbance at 599 nm gradually decreases and the absorbance at 550 nm gradually increases. This is attributed to the aggregation and dis-aggregation of the polymer chains of PBN-16 in THF solution.47,48 According to the onset absorption wavelength of 628 nm in thin film, the optical bandgap of PBN-16 is estimated to be 1.97 eV. PBN-16 in thin film shows strong red fluorescence with a peak at 620 nm and a shoulder at 678 nm, which come from aggregated polymer chains. In solution, another shoulder at 580 nm can be observed, which may be assigned to some isolated polymer chains in solution. The φF is 11.1% in thin film and 63.9% in THF solution (see the ESI†). To our best knowledge, this φF in thin film is the highest value reported so far for organic photovoltaic materials. The insets of Fig. 1(b) show the photos of the THF solution and the thin film of PBN-16 under irradiation at 365 nm, which clearly show bright red fluorescence.

We employed cyclic voltammetry (CV) to investigate the high highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO/HOMO) of PBN-16. The result is shown in Fig. 2. Based on the onset potentials of the reduction and oxidation processes, the ELUMO/HOMO of PBN-16 is estimated to be −3.39 eV/−5.96 eV. This ELUMO/HOMO suggests that PBN-16 can work as an electron acceptor in OSCs and can afford high VOC. We applied the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to estimate the electron mobility of PBN-16 with the electron-only device (see the ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curve and SCLC fitting of the electron-only device are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). PBN-16 exhibits an electron mobility (μe) as high as 2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is probably attributed to the high crystallinity of PBN-16 in thin film.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) use blends of polymer electron donors and polymer electron acceptors as photoactive layers. They have the advantages of excellent morphology stability and superior mechanical properties.49–55 To study the photovoltaic applications of PBN-16, we selected CD3 (see its chemical structure in Fig. 3(a)) as the polymer electron donor to blend with PBN-16 as the polymer electron acceptor to fabricate all-PSC devices. The device structure and energy level diagram of the device are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The ELUMO offsets and the EHOMO offsets between CD3 and PBN-16 are both larger than 0.3 eV, which would enable efficient photo-induced hole transfer and electron transfer.56,57Fig. 3(c) shows the J–V curves of the device under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and LED illumination (1000 lux, 0.302 mW cm−2). Under AM 1.5G illumination, the device exhibits a PCE of 6.00% with a VOC of 1.33 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 8.42 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 53.6% (Table 1). The VOC of 1.33 eV is among the highest values reported for OSCs. This is due to the high-lying ELUMO of PBN-16 and the low-lying EHOMO of CD3. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device spans from 350 to 650 nm, mainly lying in the visible region with no contribution from the near-infrared region. The narrow EQE spectrum plays an important role in the low JSC of the device under solar light irradiation.

Indoor photovoltaics, which convert low-intensity artificial light under indoor conditions to electricity power, are an ideal candidate to drive low-power-consumption electronic devices for the internet of things (IoTs).58–63 As shown in Fig. 3(d), the EQE spectrum of the CD3:PBN-16 device matches well with the emission spectrum of the commercial LED lighting source. This implies that the device is suitable for indoor photovoltaic applications. We measured the photovoltaic performance of the CD3:PBN-16 based device under LED illumination at a brightness of 1000 lux. The device shows a PCE of 15.23% with a VOC of 1.17 V, a JSC of 0.070 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.5%. This performance is comparable with those of organic indoor photovoltaics reported in literature studies.46,64–70
We studied the charge transporting, collection and recombination behaviors of the all-polymer photovoltaic devices. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the J–V curves and SCLC fitting of the hole-only and electron-only devices of the CD3:PBN-16 active layer. The hole mobility (μh) and μe are estimated to be 5.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.52. These results indicate high and balance charge transport of the all-polymer photovoltaic device. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) plot of the photovoltaic device, which is shown in Fig. 4(c), is used to analyze the charge generation and collection efficiency. The ratio of Jph under short-circuit conditions and at the saturation region (Jph,SC/Jph,sat) is 79.5%, suggesting that the charge collection is inefficient in the all-polymer photovoltaic device. The inefficient charge collection maybe due to the ineffective exciton dissociation of the CD3:PBN-16 active layer. This is consistent with the low EQE values and contributes to the relatively low JSC of the photovoltaic device. The bimolecular recombination behavior of the photovoltaic device was studied by the dependence of JSC on light intensity (I). The JSC and I follow the power law JSC ∝ Iα, where the α value reflects the degree of bimolecular recombination.71,72 As shown in Fig. 4(d), the α value of the fitted curve is 0.94, which implies that the bimolecular recombination of the CD3:PBN-16 blend film is moderate under short-circuit conditions.

We measured the morphology of the CD3:PBN-16 active layer by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the AFM height image of the CD3:PBN-16 film shows a smooth surface with a low root-mean-square roughness of 0.87 nm, which suggests that the polymer donor and polymer acceptor are well intermixed in the blend film. This is also supported by the AFM phase image (Fig. 5(b)). The TEM image (Fig. 5(c)) of CD3:PBN-16 indicates small-size phase separation with some short fibers.

The high φF of PBN-16 motivates us to use it as an emissive material in solution-processed OLED devices. We fabricated multilayer OLED devices with the configuration as shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(b) shows the energy level diagram of the OLED device. PBN-16 was used as the dopant and was dispersed in 9-(3-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole-3-carbonitrile (mCP-CN) as the host in the active layer. The ratio of PBN-16 in the host was 5 wt%. The active layer was spin-coated with the solution of the dopant and host in chlorobenzene. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the OLED device emits red light from PBN-16 with two peaks at 617 nm and 695 nm. The inset of Fig. 6(c) shows the commission International de l’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 coordinate diagram. The CIE coordinates of the OLED device of PBN-16 are (0.67, 0.32), which are very close to (0.67, 0.33) of the standard red emission, suggesting high color purity. The device exhibits turn-on voltages of 5.4 V, a maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.11%, a current efficiency of 0.99 cd A−1, a power efficiency of 0.48 lm W−1 and a maximum brightness of 721 cd m−2. Fig. 6(d) and (e) show the voltage–current density–brightness (V–J–B) curves and the dependence of current efficiency/power efficiency on the current density of the OLED device, respectively. The decent OLED device efficiency confirms the high φF of PBN-16 and indicates that PBN-16 is a good red light-emitting polymer for solution-processed OLEDs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a polymer acceptor based on an alternating BNBP unit and 2,5-dithienyl-1,4-dichloro-phenylene unit. The polymer exhibits φF as high as 11% in thin film because of the near-unity φF of BNBP itself and the twisted configuration of the polymer backbone. Its photovoltaic device exhibits a decent PCE of 6.0% under solar light irradiation and a high PCE of 15.2% under indoor conditions. The OLED device with PBN-16 as the emissive material emits red light with a luminance efficiency of 0.99 cd A−1 and CIE coordinates of (0.67, 0.32). These results indicate that conjugated polymers or small molecules containing a B ← N unit are promising for organic solar cells with minimized Eloss for high PCE.
