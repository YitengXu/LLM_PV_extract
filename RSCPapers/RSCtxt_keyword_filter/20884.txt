    , Accepted 6th December 2012First published on 7th December 2012AbstractWe demonstrate a self-sacrifice-templating method to synthesize Pt–Pb hollow-sphere networks, in which the hollow-spheres arise from the self-sacrifice of in situ formed Pb nanoclusters without the use of a pre-existing template and the networks originate from the diffusion-limited aggregation process. Of particular interest is that the as-prepared Pt–Pb catalyst shows a significantly enhanced activity for formic acid electrooxidation.
Fuel cells are promising high-efficiency and clean energy conversion devices. One of the key challenges before their large-scale commercialization is how to reduce or even eliminate the use of Pt metal applied to catalyze fuel cell reactions.1–4 In this regard, Pt-based catalysts such as nanodendrites,5 nanotubes,6 nanowires7 and net-like assembly8 display potential in the reduction of Pt usage, due to their structural and dimensional merits such as the preferential exposure of active crystal facets, a very effective mass transfer and a strong resistance to electrochemical degradation.6–11 Meanwhile, recent advances in electrocatalysts manifest that hollow structured catalysts possess an improved catalytic activity compared to solid nano-particle (NP) counterparts because a hollow structure could combine both advantages of the dimensions and high space utilizations.12,13 Traditional ways to fabricate a hollow structure generally require various pre-synthetic templates including a hard template, sacrificial template and soft template, which result in a high cost of template materials and the complexity of multi-step synthetic procedures.13,14 Thus, exploring template-free methods for the preparation of a hollow structure are of interest and remain challenging.
With regard to fuel cell reactions, formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO) is gaining more and more attention, not only for its model role in the electrooxidation of small organic molecules, but also formic acid is a promising fuel used in direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs).11,15–20 A critical problem for the Pt catalyst during FAEO is CO poisoning, which arises from the incomplete oxidation of formic acid molecules. In this respect, bimetallic Pt–M catalysts (M = Au, Pd, Pb and Bi, Sb etc.) have shown the ability to inhibit CO poisoning and thus enhance the kinetics of FAEO.16,21–23 In this regard, Pt–Pb catalysts have received extensive attention. Abruna et al. found that the intermetallic Pt–Pb catalyst exhibited an excellent activity and a great tolerance toward CO poisoning during FAEO.23 Sun et al. demonstrated that the non-intermetallic Pt–Pb/C catalyst with a hollow structure can also exhibit an activity as high as 3.6 times that of commercial Pd black.24 Murray et al.25 synthesized highly active Pt3Pb and Pt3Pb–Pt core–shell nanocrystals, and stated that the high activity results from the elimination of CO poisoning and decreased barriers for the dehydrogenation steps. Furthermore, Nazar et al. applied a chemically controlled process to synthesize ordered mesoporous carbon-supported Pt–Pb nanoparticles exhibiting an improved mass activity for FAEO.26 However, most studies of Pt–Pb catalysts for FAEO are focused on their solid NPs structure. Rationally, the Pt–Pb catalysts with a 3D hollow structure are promising to advance the performance of DFAFCs.
In this work, we demonstrate a self-sacrifice-templating method to prepare the structure and composition-tunable Pt–Pb hollow-sphere networks (HNs). In particular, without using the pre-existing template, Pt33Pb67 HNs/C was readily obtained by pouring the deaerated metal precursors–capping agent sodium citrate (Na3CA)–carbon black dispersion solution into the reducing NaBH4 solution under stirring conditions. The detailed synthesis procedure is presented in the electronic supplementary information (ESI†).

Fig. 1a–c show representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM images (HRTEM) of the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C catalyst with an initial mol ratio Pt–Pb = 33:67. The clear contrast between the bright centre and the dark edge demonstrates the presence of a hollow structure. The average diameter of the hollow spheres was statistically calculated to be 10.5±2 nm. Moreover, the abundant hollow spheres (see Fig. 1b) are assembled into nanochains via particle attachment and further interconnected to form large extended networks with exterior porous structures. In the HRTEM image of Fig. 1c, the measured lattice spacing is ca. 0.225 nm corresponding to {111} planes of pure Pt, indicative of the appearance of phase separation between Pt and Pb.24 This can be confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, in which we can observe the coexistence of diffraction peaks assigned to Pt face-centered-cubic (fcc) and 2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2 phases, respectively (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The co-existence of Pt and Pb components in the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C catalyst can be demonstrated by the energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) in Fig. 1d and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in Fig. S2, ESI.†

Exploring the origin of the hollow structure would be of great interest for the facile synthesis of hollow structure nano-materials and their wide application in energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, solar cells, lithium ion batteries and super capacitors.13 Considering the absence of a pre-existing template, the formation of the hollow structure is speculated to arise from the galvanic replacement reaction between the PtCl62− ions and the in situ formed metallic Pb nanoclusters driven by their large redox difference (φΘ PtCl62−/Pt = 0.735 V; φΘ Pb2+/Pb = –0.125 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode). Using pre-synthetic sacrifice templates, these galvanic-replacement-reaction-induced hollow structures have been widely observed in previous reports.14,24,27 Typically, Wan et al. demonstrated that Pt hollow spheres were readily synthesized using pre-existing Co NPs as a sacrifice template.27 Differently, the synthesis of Pt33Pb67 HNs/C did not use a pre-synthetic template, and thus was herein referenced as a self-sacrifice-templating method. This can be supported by analysis of the composition of Pt33Pb67 HNs/C. Compared to the initial composition of Pt33Pb67, the final Pb fraction has been obviously reduced according to the results of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Pt62Pb38) and EDS (Pt59Pb41), which indicate that Pb was partially consumed. Furthermore, the Pb fraction in the surface layer based on the result of XPS (Pt45Pb55) is larger than that in the bulk or core counterparts, based on the comparison between XPS and ICP-OES/EDS results. The relative enrichment of the Pb component in the surface layer and the reduced Pb fraction in the end product both indicate the probability that the in situ formed Pb nuclei were galvanically replaced by PtCl62− ions and the resulting Pb2+ ions continuously diffused out across the shell; while PtCl62− ions diffused into the core and were reduced to Pt atoms by in situ formed Pb nuclei. This process is in good agreement with the Kirkendall effect, in which pores originate from the difference in diffusion rates between the diffusion couple.
In order to obtain further and reliable evidence, a set of control experiments were conducted by tuning the concentration of Pb while fixing other experimental parameters. As a result, we can observe the Pb composition-dependent morphology evolution, in which when increasing the initial Pb fraction, the hollow structure gradually emerges. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2a,b, Pt67Pb33/C shows the well-defined solid NP networks, while the hollow structure is hardly observed. For Pt50Pb50/C, it still displays the dominant solid NPs; meanwhile a few hollow spheres marked by arrows can be found in Fig. 2c,d. In contrast, Pt20Pb80/C (in Fig. 2e,f) exhibits a clear HN structure similar to Pt33Pb67 HNs/C. These TEM observations indicate that the increase in the Pb fraction provides a more available in situ Pb template and therefore facilitates the formation of a hollow structure. The intrinsically consistent evolution trend was also found in the XRD patterns of the catalysts (Fig. S1, ESI†). Specifically, we can observe varied XRD patterns from the single Pt alloy phase of Pt67Pb33/C to the mixed phase of Pt50Pb50/C containing a Pt alloy phase and 2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2 phases, and to the mixed phases of Pt33Pb67 HNs/C and Pt20Pb80/C including Pt fcc and 2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2 phases.

With regard to the assembling behavior of solid NPs or hollow spheres, the amount of capping agent Na3CA plays an important role. When reducing the concentration of Na3CA from 5 to 0 mM, Pt50Pb50/C exhibits a mixed morphology comprised of fewer featured networks and a number of NPs (Fig. S3a,b, ESI†); while the amount of Na3CA increases from 5 mM to 20 mM, excessive Na3CA seems to inhibit the solid NPs or hollow spheres, smoothly inter-attaching and branching to form networks, which finally results in a weakened and aggregated network structure (Fig. S3c,d, ESI†). There is a pertinent concern on which modes are followed during the particle assembling process: an oriented attachment or a random attachment? The HRTEM image in Fig. 2b shows that the orientations of Pt {111} lattice fringes, marked by arrows, are discontinuous and varied randomly, indicating that the particle attachment process may follow a diffusion-limited aggregation model.8,28,29 This point is also supported by the analysis of fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction patterns in Fig. S4† and the TEM observation for a single nanochain in Fig. S5, ESI.† Similar observations on randomly attached NPs were also reported in Ag/Au NP networks29 and the netlike-assembly of Pt NPs .8 However, note that using an in situ TEM to monitor NP growth trajectories in real-time, recent reports showed robust evidence on the oriented NP attachment, where NPs as building blocks undergo continuous rotation and interaction until they find a perfect lattice or shape match.30–32 A typical example is that the winding Pt3Fe NP chains would undergo straightening, orientation and shape correction to yield single-crystal nanorods.31 Thus, these resulting structures typically diffract as a single crystal.30 Furthermore, it is noted that in these syntheses, mild reduction and growth conditions such as using formic acid as a mild reducer at room temperature33 and an electron beam initiating reduction in a low temperature liquid cell31 were adopted to favor the oriented growth and the formation of a single crystal. In contrast to oriented particle attachment, those networks that show random orientation were generally produced under strong reduction conditions such as high temperature hydrothermal conditions,8,34 heating at reflux29 and a strong reducing agent such as sodium borohydride.35 The reduction and growth processes are expected to proceed much more quickly and result in coalescence and fusion of the NPs before they undergo the process of calibration, match and oriented attachment. Intrinsically, the formation of networks belongs to a kinetically controlled growth of NPs rather than an energy-based controlled process.
In combination of the TEM, XRD and composition analysis, the formation of HNs was proposed and illustrated briefly in Scheme 1. It assumes a discrete nucleation stage followed by monomer growth and an assembling process via particle attachment to yield a network structure. It is worthy to note that the particle growth and the particle attachment processes may co-occur and not be distinguished strictly in the time-scale. Specifically, when the concentration of Pb is 0.05 mmol for Pt67Pb33/C, an excess of the strong reducing agent sodium borohydride is capable of quickly reducing Pt and Pb ions simultaneously, irrespective of their big redox potential difference. The resulting immediate nucleation effectively guarantees the formation of Pt67Pb33 solid NPs and a single Pt alloy phase. These solid NPs grow further and form a network structure by particle attachment. In contrast, when the concentration of Pb is 0.2 mmol for Pt33Pb67 HNs/C, the reducing capability of NaBH4 in the initial stage still ensures the production of a solid cluster and a single lattice phase. However, when the reaction continuously proceeds, sodium borohydride is gradually consumed and the reducing capability correspondingly decreases. A critical point becomes present where the added PtCl62− species preferably react with the in situ formed metallic Pb nuclei, driven by their big redox potential difference, which results in the formation of a hollow structure and the occurrence of phase separation.24 Similarly, these hollow spheres grow and form a network structure by particle attachment.

Inspired by its attractive structure, Pt33Pb67 HNs/C was tested as an electrocatalyst for FAEO. The actual Pt loading on the electrode (ca. 39.8 μgPt cm−2) and the end Pt content in the catalyst (ca. 19.3 wt% Pt) were based on the result of ICP-OES. Fig. 3A shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M COOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. FAEO on the Pt electrode generally follows a so-called dual pathway mechanism: one is the indirect pathway which produces the poisoning CO intermediate; the other is the direct pathway to complete oxidation of formic acid into CO2.36–38 As shown in Fig. 3A, the current peak of P1 at 0.326 vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in the anodic scan corresponds to FAEO via the direct pathway. After the potential plateau from 0.326 to 0.576 V vs. SCE, there is the appearance of a prominent current peak of P2 at 0.674 V vs. SCE, which can be ascribed to the oxidation of COad-like intermediates, accumulated in the indirect pathway. Thus, the ratio of P1–P2 is capable of indicating which pathway preferably occurs during FAEO. Due to a severe CO poisoning effect, the Pt/C electrode shows a low activity at the desirable low potential zone in the anodic scan and a small ratio value of P1–P2 for FAEO. In contrast, Pt33Pb67 HNs/C clearly shows a significantly enhanced activity compared to the Pt/C electrode and higher ratio value of P1–P2. For example, the current density of Pt33Pb67 HNs/C at 0.2 V vs. SCE in the anodic scan is 8 times higher than one on the Pt/C electrode. In addition, the onset potential for the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C electrode is negatively shifted by ca. 126 mV compared to the Pt/C electrode, demonstrating an intrinsically improved kinetics process of FAEO. The enhanced activity for the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C electrode can be further supported by the comparison of specific activity, as shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† These results substantially demonstrate that the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C catalyst possesses a superior FAEO activity and much better selectivity for the direct pathway reaction. Such enhancement can be ascribed to the promotion effect of Pb23,24,26 and the unique structure merits from the HN structure. Pb was reported to promote FAEO on the Pt catalyst by any or all of the following effects: the third-body effect, the ligand effect and the bifunctional effect.24,39 Particularly, Pb is believed to provide a geometric hindrance and thereby reduces the number of ensemble sites required for the production of CO,24,40,41 which makes the direct pathway preferably occur. Meanwhile, the hollow structure for Pt33Pb67 HNs/C makes both inner and outer surfaces easily accessible to target molecules.13,27 The network structure is helpful for electron conductivity and mass transfer, which promotes the overall reaction kinetics.6,8 Of note, among all Pt–Pb-based electrodes, Pt33Pb67 HNs/C exhibits the best activity (Fig. 3B), indicating the presence of a combined composition and structure effect on FAEO. The electrochemical stability of the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C electrode for FAEO was investigated by a chronoamperometry experiment at 0.2 V vs. SCE (Fig. 3C). Consistent with CV results, the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C electrode displays a much higher initial current density than the Pt/C electrode. The remaining current at 3600 s is approximately 41.5% for the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C electrode, which is much higher than that for the Pd/C electrode.19,20 Although the Pt/C electrode displays an excellent stability, the low activity due to COads poisoning makes it unfavorable for application as an anodic catalyst in DFAFCs. Such significantly enhanced activity and stability make Pt33Pb67 HNs/C promising for applications in DFAFCs. The electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C catalyst was further evaluated in a fuel cell operating environment. Pt33Pb67 HNs/C and Pt/C catalyst were used as the anodic catalyst in a DFAFC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3D, the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C-based DFAFC consistently shows an improved performance compared with the Pt/C-based one. Specifically, the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C-based single cell has a higher open circuit voltage of 0.855 V (OCV) and maximal power density of 104 mW cm−2 (Pmax) than those of the Pt/C-based single cell (OCV 0.785 V; Pmax 21 mW cm−2).

In summary, using a Pt–Pb HN as an example, this work demonstrated a new structure-control strategy to tune and optimize bimetallic catalysis. It highlights the self-sacrifice-templating route for the in situ formation of a hollow structure without the use of a pre-synthetic template and the NP attachment process for the formation of a network structure. This structure-control strategy is promising to be extended to other bimetallic systems, although some modifications of the experimental conditions might be required. Importantly, the Pt33Pb67 HNs/C exhibited a superior electrocatalytic performance in an electrochemical cell and a realistic fuel cell compared with Pt/C. Such an enhancement can be ascribed to the promotion effect of Pb and the unique structure merits from the HN structure.
