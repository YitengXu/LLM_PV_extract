    , Accepted 30th June 2022First published on 13th July 2022AbstractAlthough a tin (Sn) perovskite is regarded as a good substitute for a lead (Pb) perovskite due to its environmental friendliness and suitable band gap, a Sn-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) still has practical stability and efficiency problems. Here, we introduce a passivation material 2,5-diaminohydroquinone dihydrochloride (C6H8N2O2·2HCl) with –NH2 groups and –OH groups into the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite. Research results indicate that the introduction of C6H8N2O2·2HCl through OH⋯I and NH⋯I effectively improves the morphology of perovskite thin films, facilitates light absorption and film crystallinity, reduces the density of defect states and unnecessary non-radiative recombination, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and reduces the neutral iodine-related defects by the aromatic structures with multiple functional groups. Furthermore, the introduction of Cl also plays a positive role in suppressing the generation of Sn4+ and promoting the formation of large-size crystal grains. By adjusting and optimizing C6H8N2O2·2HCl concentration, the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 device with the presence of the 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive achieves the best power conversion efficiency of 9.17% compared to the pristine one with 7.27%. The corresponding unencapsulated device retains 80% of its initial efficiency after over 800 hours in a glove box with a N2 environment.
1. Introduction
With the development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), environmentally friendly lead-free perovskites have received great attention from the photovoltaic industry.1–13 To meet the needs of commercial production and application, the materials used in PSCs are required to be environmentally friendly and own excellent optoelectronic conversion efficiency. As one of the substitutes for lead (Pb)-based perovskites, organic–inorganic hybrid tin (Sn) halide perovskites show many advantages,14,15 such as excellent optical bandgap, great optical absorption coefficient, extremely high carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy and other excellent optoelectronic performance.16–26 Among them, the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite with mixed cations is regarded as one of the most promising materials among Sn-based perovskites because of its wider absorption spectrum and narrower band gap. The unmodified pristine device of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 is more efficient and more reproducible than the most frequently studied FASnI3 perovskite.3 Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of Sn-based PSCs is inferior to those of Pb-based analogues because Sn perovskite materials have some inherent shortcomings. First, Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+, whether in the perovskite precursor solution or the perovskite film. The oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ is thermodynamically favourable, even in nitrogen-filled gloveboxes.27,28 This change will cause p-type self-doping, generate a large number of Sn vacancies, and promote the rapid recombination of charge carriers, thus limiting the performance of Sn-based PSCs.5,28 In addition, the crystallization rate of tin perovskites is too fast, and it is difficult to form a dense and uniform high-quality tin-based perovskite film without pinholes. A large number of defects at the boundary or in its grain will appear due to the rapid crystallization of Sn-based perovskites.5,29,30 These trap states will induce serious carrier recombination, and at the same time significantly reduce the open-circuit voltage (Voc), which influences the efficiency and stability of Sn-based PSCs.
In some previous work, additives such as SnF2,10,31–33 tin powder,34 hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid,34 or ascorbic acid35,36 have been used to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ and reduce defects in the perovskite film. It is worth mentioning that in perovskites, salts with –OH and –NH2/NH3+ functional groups have been shown to have good passivation functions.31,37 This type of material is used in the perovskite, which can effectively reduce the internal defects and surface pinholes of the perovskite. The use of this type of additives can directly neutralize the dangling bonds or charged defects of the Sn-based perovskite, improve the quality of the Sn-based perovskite film, inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, and greatly improve the efficiency and stability of Sn-based PSCs. For example, Islam et al.38 introduced 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) containing carboxylic acid (–COOH) and the ammonium (–NH3+) into the FASnI3 perovskite precursor and found that –COOH and –NH3+ underwent a hydrogen bond interaction (O–H⋯I and N–H⋯I) with iodide from SnI64− octahedra, which effectively passivated grain boundaries of FASnI3 films and obtained a high-quality FASnI3-based perovskite film and good power conversion efficiency (PCE). In our previous work, we also found that the introduction of hexamethylenediamine diiodide (HDADI) with two –NH3+ into the FASnI3-based perovskite can sufficiently passivate the charged defects and dangling bonds of the perovskite via N–H⋯I and reduce Sn vacancies through the suppression of the oxidation of Sn2+.31 In addition, Han et al.39 added polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to the FASnI3 perovskite and used the O–H⋯I hydrogen bond interaction between polyvinyl alcohol and FASnI3 to introduce new nucleation sites, which slowed down the growth of crystals and presented preferred orientations of crystals, thereby reducing trap states. At the same time, the iodide ion in FASnI3 and the –OH in PVA generate hydrogen bond interactions, which can inhibit the migration of iodide ions. Combined with the above-related work, it can be proved that –NH3+ and –OH have an observable enhancement effect in Sn-based PSCs. In addition, it is worth mentioning that in Sn- and Pb-based perovskites, chloride ions have long been introduced in various forms as effective passivating anions, such as SnCl2,40 PbCl2,41 MACl,42 FACl,43 CsCl44 and NH4Cl.45,46 The explanation for the improvement of performance by the presence of Cl in the synthesis is that the presence of chloride will affect the formation of the film and lead to larger crystalline domains, but Cl does not necessarily remain in the film. At the same time, in previous works on Sn-based perovskites, it is suspected that Cl− can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to a certain extent, like F−.47 Recently, chloride salt has been proven to promote the growth of perovskite grains well. Using chloride salts to produce large size grains is also beneficial to achieve higher PCE in the corresponding PSC.
In this work, we introduce a passivation material 2,5-diaminohydroquinone dihydrochloride (C6H8N2O2·2HCl) with the –NH2 group and the –OH group into the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solutions to explore its influence on the morphology and photophysical properties of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films and then the photovoltaic performance of inverted planar PSCs. Research results indicate that the introduction of C6H8N2O2·2HCl through OH⋯I and NH⋯I effectively improves the morphology of perovskite thin films, facilitates light absorption and film crystallinity, reduces the density of defect states and unnecessary non-radiative recombination, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and reduces the neutral iodine-related defects by the aromatic structures with multiple functional groups. In addition, the introduction of Cl− also played a positive role in suppressing the generation of Sn4+ and the formation of large-size crystal grains. Application of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 composite films into inverted planar PSCs acquires a champion PCE of 9.17%, showing a 24.6% enhancement factor compared with 7.27% of the control device without C6H8N2O2·2HCl. In addition, the storage stability of perovskite films and PSCs has been significantly improved with improved film quality.
2. Results and discussion
As the light-absorbing layer of the PSC, the quality of the perovskite film is critical to achieving high PCE. Generally speaking, only flat, smooth, defect-free, and large grain size thin films can produce high-performance PSCs. Here, we prepared the perovskite precursor solutions in the mixed solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (the molar ratio is 1:4) by dissolving formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), SnI2, SnF2 (molar ratio of 10%) and various concentrations of C6H8N2O2·2HCl (0 to 1.5 mol%) to study the influence of the passivation material C6H8N2O2·2HCl on the quality of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films. Before the preparation of the perovskite film, we first drop poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode as a hole transport layer, spin-coating at 3000 rpm. Subsequently, we continued to spin-coat the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solution on the PEDOT:PSS at a speed of 5000 rpm, and drip chlorobenzene (CB) as an anti-solvent at the 15th second. The film is finally annealed on a hot stage at 90 °C to form a perovskite.
To judge the effect of different amounts of C6H8N2O2·2HCl on the quality of the perovskite film, we used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to detect the morphology of the film with and without the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive, which is shown in Fig. 1. The top-down SEM image of the original FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film without the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive in Fig. 1a shows relatively good coverage, but there are still some holes and obvious defects in the crystal gap, as can be observed in the enlarged part of Fig. 1a. These obvious holes and defects not only are not conducive to the collection and transmission of carriers but also reduce the resistance of the film to water and oxygen, making the film easy to oxidize and decompose. Fortunately, we found that by doping the precursor solution with the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive and adjusting the appropriate amount, the quality of the perovskite film was significantly improved, the crystal grains became dense, and the undesired holes disappeared. It can be seen from Fig. 1b and c that when the concentration of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive increases continuously (from 0 to 1.0 mol%), the holes and the gaps between the crystal grains in the film gradually decrease. When the concentration of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive is increased to 1.0 mol%, a uniform, continuous, pinhole-free, and large-sized dense perovskite film with high crystallinity can be obtained. However, as the proportion of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive was further increased to 1.5 mol%, the crystallization of the perovskite film seemed to be affected, the grain boundaries become inconspicuous, the merging of crystal grains became evident, and a large number of unnecessary holes appeared on the surface again (Fig. 1d), which has seriously affected the quality of the film, so that the light absorption and carrier transport capabilities of the perovskite film are also severely affected. Combined with previous related studies, we believe that this is because the excessive addition of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl material affects the normal growth of crystals in the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film, causing unnecessary phase separation.48 The mutual inhibition of the growth of different crystal phases leads to a large number of pinholes in the crystallization process. Excessive C6H8N2O2·2HCl additives also reduce the crystallinity of the perovskite (Fig. 2c), hinder charge transport and serve as carrier recombination centers due to the phase separation of the solid additive, which is detrimental to the quality of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film.

Adding Cl to the perovskite precursor solution can form some intermediate crystal structures related to Cl, thereby slowing down the crystallization of the perovskite. The Sn-based perovskite crystallizing too fast is one of the problems we need to solve. The slowed-down crystallization speed can effectively reduce the internal defects of Sn-based perovskites, improving the crystallinity and coverage, which can be confirmed by other characterizations below. Through the thermal annealing treatment, the Cl in the perovskite will leave the crystal lattice and be lost. The incorporation of Cl changes only the kinetic process of crystal growth, affects the morphology of the final perovskite, reduces the generation of defects, increases the grain size, and improves the electrical properties of the material.49,50 We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1, ESI†) on films doped with C6H8N2O2·2HCl at different annealing times. We found that with the extension of the annealing time, the characteristic peak of crystallographic planes (100) shifted slightly, which means that Cl is gradually leaving the crystal lattice during the annealing process. In addition, when fully annealed, the half-value width of the (100) peak narrowed, indicating that during the annealing process, Cl changed the kinetic process of crystal growth and made the crystal grains larger (the change in grain size can be clearly seen from the SEM images under different annealing time in Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, passivating materials with passivating functional groups (such as –OH or –NH3+) are used in perovskites, which can also affect the crystallization kinetics process at the early stage of crystallization (before annealing), thereby increasing the grain size and making the size uniform.4,31 Therefore, under the synergistic effect of the passivating functional group and Cl, we can find that the introduction of C6H8N2O2·2HCl has a significant effect on the perovskite grain size. When doping the appropriate amount of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl material, the perovskite grain size becomes relatively uniform, especially when the C6H8N2O2·2HCl doping amounts are 1.0 mol% and 1.5 mol%, the size distribution of perovskite grains is mainly in the range of 600–900 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). Through statistical analysis of the grain size of the film with different doping concentrations, the average grain size increased from 497 nm of the original film to 678 nm of 0.5 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl, 764 nm of 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl and 781 nm of 1.5 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl. In previous reports, it has been proved that large crystal grains enhance carrier mobility. Therefore, the passivating film has better carrier transport ability.51 In addition, the decrease in grain boundaries (GBs) that can be used as an effective recombination center due to the increase in grain size also helps to reduce trap-mediated recombination.52
Then, we found that the doping of C6H8N2O2·2HCl has a positive effect on the hydrophobicity of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with the original perovskite film, the water contact angle of the film added with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl becomes larger, which proves that this defect-free and denser film has better resistance to water erosion. The increased hydrophobicity is due to the hydrophobic organic groups in C6H8N2O2·2HCl. It is worth mentioning that the light absorption of the film in the visible range is slightly improved with a small amount of C6H8N2O2·2HCl doping (Fig. 2b), due to the quality improvement of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film (the modified Sn-based perovskite film is more uniform, continuous, dense and pinhole-free than the pristine film). However, when the amount of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive is more than 1.0 mol%, the film absorption is then greatly reduced because excessive C6H8N2O2·2HCl doping will lead to the decrease in the quality of the perovskite film. In addition, we calculated the bandgap of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 to be 1.32 eV from the positions of the UV-vis absorption sidebands, which is narrower than that of the FASnI3 perovskite material (1.36 eV).5
Next, we discussed the effect of C6H8N2O2·2HCl on the structural properties of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskites. To investigate the effect of C6H8N2O2·2HCl on the crystallinity of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films, we measured the XRD patterns of these perovskite films (Fig. 2c). The main diffraction peaks at 14.0, 24.8, 28.0, 32.4, and 40.7°, which are assigned to the crystallographic planes (100), (120), (200), (122), and (222), respectively, confirm that the perovskite possesses an orthorhombic crystal structure and preferred orientation.31,37,39 When C6H8N2O2·2HCl is incorporated, the diffraction peak intensity of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film on the (100) and (200) crystal planes increases significantly, and it reached the highest value when the doping amount was 1.0 mol%. This indicates that the introduction of C6H8N2O2·2HCl effectively promoted the preferential growth of perovskite crystals along the 100 and 200 crystal directions. It is worth noting that when the doping amount of C6H8N2O2·2HCl gradually increased to 1.0 mol%, we found that the diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite on the (100) and (200) crystal planes began to decrease. We guess that this phenomenon is related to the deterioration of the film quality due to the phase separation of the perovskite film at this time, which is consistent with the SEM image in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns were further observed, and the low-angle diffraction peaks that symbolized the existence of 2D-layered structures were not observed in the XRD patterns of all films, which indicated that FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 films doped with C6H8N2O2·2HCl were all 3D perovskite structures. Next, we explored the photophysical mechanism of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl doped perovskite. We performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements on the pristine and doped (1.0 mol%) FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films, with results presented in Fig. 2d. After light excitation, the pristine perovskite film sample shows an emission with a wide emission band of 850–1025 nm and a maximum peak at 932 nm (Fig. 2d). At the same time, we observed that the PL intensity of the perovskite film containing the 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive increased significantly and showed a slight blue shift (Fig. 2d). In this regard, we believe that the addition of C6H8N2O2·2HCl has a passivation effect on the inside of the perovskite, thereby reducing the internally charged traps and suppressing the non-radiative recombination loss assisted by the charged traps. We also calculated the average exciton lifetime (τavr) with  (A1, A2: fractional intensity; τ1, τ2: lifetime) by analyzing the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay kinetics of the pristine and composite FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 films in Fig. S4 (ESI†) with the bi-exponential function. From the fitted result shown in Table S1 (ESI†), we found that the amplitude of τ1 for the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-incorporated perovskite is decreased from 36.32% to 32.46%, indicative of declined trap-mediated nonradiative recombination due to the reduced defect density. Meanwhile, the long exciton lifetime (τ2) has increased from 5.59 ns of the original film to 8.12 ns. The enhanced exciton lifetime shows that the passivation of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive successfully suppresses trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the perovskite film, which is consistent with the steady-state PL spectra.
In the following work, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to examine the surface chemical composition and chemical environment of the original and 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped perovskite film, further confirming the interaction between C6H8N2O2·2HCl and FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskites. We display the survey spectra in Fig. S5, (ESI†) and the Sn 3d, I 3d, O 1s, N 1s and Cl 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 3 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The presence of Cl was not found, which proved that Cl left the perovskite during the crystallization process (Fig. S6, ESI†). After C6H8N2O2·2HCl was added to FA0.75MA0.25SnI3, we found that the area ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+ was significantly reduced from 19.6% in the original FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film to 9.5% (Fig. 3a), as shown in the Sn elemental analysis. This phenomenon proves that the use of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive significantly inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+ in FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskites, accordingly reducing Sn2+ vacancies and unnecessary Sn4+. The O 1s XPS spectra shown in Fig. 3d and e also support this view. In the O 1s XPS spectra, the peak at 530.7 eV that represents the Sn–O bond shows an obvious decline in the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film compared to that in the control FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 one, suggesting the reduced oxidation of Sn in our eventual perovskite film. Combining I 3d, O 1s and N 1s XPS spectra to analyze together, we attributed this result to –OH and –NH3+ from C6H8N2O2·2HCl, which interact with iodide from SnI64− octahedra via a hydrogen bond (OH⋯I and N–H⋯I). It was found that after C6H8N2O2·2HCl was incorporated, the I 3d peak shifted slightly to the higher binding energy in I 3d XPS spectra, as can be seen from Fig. 3b. Correspondingly, we found that in the N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra, the peak positions of –OH (Fig. 3c–e) and –NH3+ (Fig. 3f–h) at 532.1 eV and 400.8 eV have moved to a lower binding energy of 531.8 eV and 400.6 eV. The change in binding energy proves the formation of our aforementioned hydrogen bond. Herein, we believe that in the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solution, –OH and –NH3+ can also interact with SnI64− octahedron through hydrogen bonds in the precursor solution to form a shielding layer to prevent Sn2+ from reacting with oxygen. This also delays the film formation process and the oxidation of the tin precursor. And in the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film, the formation of hydrogen bonds can passivate the defects in the film, thereby effectively resisting the erosion of water and oxygen. In addition, we believe that another reason for the decrease in the Sn4+ content in the perovskite is the presence of Cl− in the precursor solution. Because in previous work, studies have shown that hard Lewis bases such as chloride can effectively prevent the formation of Sn4+ in the solution.40,50,53,54 It is worth mentioning that a small amount of I2 originally due to the presence of I− disappeared in the passivated film (peaks at the binding energies of 620.3 and 631.5 eV in Fig. 3b). Herein, we believe that the part of functional groups –OH and –NH3+ from aromatic structures that is not fully involved in passivation captures the free I−, thereby reducing the formation of I2. The reduction or even disappearance of residual iodine avoids the introduction of deep trap states.53–57

Based on the above analysis, we give a schematic diagram of the crystal structure of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl passivated perovskite (Fig. 4a). In addition, we also specifically compare the energy levels of the original and 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl passivated FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films. Through the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) test of these two perovskite films (Fig. 4b), the valence band of the perovskite film is calculated using the formula,12,15 and the original and 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSCs are shown in an energy level diagram (Fig. 4c). We have found that the valence band of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped perovskite changes from the original −4.87 eV to −4.90 eV, which is more compatible with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS (−5.28 eV) and can effectively reduce the energy loss of carriers due to energy level mismatch during transport. Therefore, we believe that C6H8N2O2·2HCl has a significant passivation effect on Sn-based perovskite films, which can greatly make the energy level more matched and reduce unnecessary non-radiative recombination in FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films, thereby increasing the Jsc, FF and Voc of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSCs.

Therefore, we fabricate inverted planar PSCs consisting of an ITO transparent electrode, a 40 nm PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer, a 180 nm thick perovskite film as the light absorber, a 40 nm electron-transport buckminsterfullerene (C60) layer, a hole-blocking layer with 9 nm bathocuproine (BCP), and a 100 nm Ag back electrode (Fig. 5a). The defect passivation of perovskite absorption films with –OH and –NH2 groups from C6H8N2O2·2HCl reduces the charged defects and nonradiative recombination centers within the perovskites, resulting in a higher density of photogenerated charges and therefore providing larger quasi-Fermi level splitting and Voc values. Because of the above reasons, the PSCs based on 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl exhibit improved Voc to 0.611 V, compared to 0.577 V of the pristine device, according to the statistical data shown in Table 1.

The champion J–V plot for each condition of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3-based PSCs with different concentrations of C6H8N2O2·2HCl was measured in the reverse scan mode under AM 1.5G, 100 MW cm−2 irradiation, and the main photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 1 and also shown in Fig. 5b. The best performing reference device with the doping concentration of C6H8N2O2·2HCl being 1.0 mol% showed a Jsc of 23.09 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.611 V, a FF of 64.99%, and a PCE of 9.17%. However, the control device without C6H8N2O2·2HCl just showed a maximum PCE of 7.27%, with a Voc of 0.577 V, a Jsc of 20.66 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.00%. It is worth noting that a further increase in C6H8N2O2·2HCl exceeding 1.5 mol% led to deterioration of photovoltaic performance, and the best PCE at this time dropped to 7.78%. This change in photovoltaic performance may be related to the deterioration of the quality of the perovskite film (Fig. 1).
The introduction of more C6H8N2O2·2HCl leads to the perovskite phase separation, which seriously affects the carrier transport characteristics of the film, which in turn affects the overall performance of the PSC. We checked the reproducibility of PCE by fabricating 15 devices for each kind of PSC without or with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl. It was found that when 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl was added to the perovskite, the average efficiency of the device increased from 6.18% to 8.41% compared to the pristine device from the histograms of PCE values of the 15 devices, as shown in Fig. 5c.
The J–V curves in forward and reverse scans of the PSCs with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped are compared as shown in Fig. 5d. Our champion device has low hysteresis, which shows that the doping of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive significantly suppresses defects and ion migration.31,50 The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) curves of the devices without or with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl are shown in Fig. 5e. The integrated Jscs of the corresponding devices are 21.03 mA cm−2 and 22.96 mA cm−2, which coincide well with those experimental values from the J–V measurement. Furthermore, the IPCE of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped PSC has a significant increase in external quantum efficiency in the 350–850 nm wavelength range, which is attributed to better film quality and simultaneously reduced charge trap and carrier recombination. We kept the champion device with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl at the maximum power point (MPP) to track the power output (Fig. 5f). It can be seen that the photocurrent stabilized within a few seconds with a value of 23.06 mA cm−2, generating a resulting PCE of 9.03%. The display and description of the above experimental data proved the effectiveness of the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive in the perovskite to improve the efficiency of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSC devices.
To evaluate the extent of charge recombination within the devices, we conducted the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements for the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSCs without or with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl. The Nyquist plots of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 6a, and the corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset. According to the fitted results summarized, the Rrec value of 898836 Ω for the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSC is much larger than 498605 Ω of the control FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 one, which further verifies the suppressed carrier recombination and efficient charge transfer in the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-doped device. To further explore the charge transport within devices, we conducted the dark J–V curves for the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSCs without or with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 6b. Compared with the pristine device, the C6H8N2O2·2HCl-incorporated FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSC has a lower dark current density. It is generally believed that the decrease in dark current density may be related to the leakage current suppressed by the continuous, uniform and dense perovskite film without pinholes.4,31 Therefore, we believe that the doping of C6H8N2O2·2HCl does indeed produce a continuous, uniform and pinhole-free dense FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film, which suppresses leakage current and improves the efficiency of the corresponding equipment. Finally, we evaluated the long-term stability of the PSCs without or with 1.0 mol% C6H8N2O2·2HCl. Without any packaging, we tested the stability of the devices under a N2 environment. Through multiple tests, we found that the PCE of the original FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSC decays continuously within 800 hours and reaches 30% of its initial efficiency, while the PSC with the C6H8N2O2·2HCl additive remains 80% of its initial value within 800 hours (Fig. 6c).

3. Conclusions
In summary, by applying the multifunctional passivation material C6H8N2O2·2HCl to FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 PSC, the PCE and various optoelectronic properties of the pristine Sn-based perovskite solar cell device are effectively enhanced. The results show that the introduction of C6H8N2O2·2HCl through OH⋯I and NH⋯I effectively improves the morphology of perovskite thin films, facilitates light absorption and film crystallinity, reduces the density of defect states and unnecessary non-radiative recombination, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and reduces neutral iodine-related defects by aromatic structures with multiple functional groups. In addition, the introduction of Cl also played a positive role in suppressing the generation of Sn4+ and the formation of large-size crystal grains. Applications of C6H8N2O2·2HCl-treated C6H8N2O2·2HCl films into PSCs acquire a champion PCE of 9.17% and outstanding long-term stability of over 800 hours to retain 80% of its initial efficiency in a glove box with a N2 environment. This work shows that the Sn-based lead-free PSC can improve its performance through the use of multifunctional passivation materials, and then compete with lead PSCs. And we believe that this work can guide the selection of passivation materials used in perovskites to ultimately design and manufacture highly stable and efficient Sn-based PSCs.
