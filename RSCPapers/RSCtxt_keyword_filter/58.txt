    , Accepted 2nd June 2014First published on 3rd June 2014AbstractWaste heat has been regarded as one of the most important renewable and green energy sources, and its widespread reclamation could help to reduce the negative impacts of global warming and the energy crisis. In this work, we designed a pyroelectric generator based on a polyvinylidene fluoride film for harvesting the heat energy from hot/cold water, which widely exists in industrial processes. To achieve practical application, the device simply contacts a hot flow and cold flow alternately. The output open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current reached a maximum of 192 V and 12 μA, respectively, under a temperature change of 80 °C. The output power density can reach 14 μW cm, which is a great improvement for thermoelectric devices. The prepared pyroelectric generator can drive 42 green light-emitting diodes or charge a commercial capacitor (100 μF) to 3.3 V in 90 s. This work provides a promising strategy for efficiently harvesting waste heat from water and presents significant progress in thermoelectric conversion technology.
Introduction
Due to the threat of a worldwide energy crisis, more and more researchers are focusing on exploring new energy resources. Waste heat utilization has attracted extensive attention and interest due to its universality, availability, and environmental friendliness. Automotive internal combustion engines produce large amounts of heat that dissipate into the environment. Much waste water from industrial cooling is directly discharged into rivers along with the heat loss. Household water also contains much heat energy. If this waste heat could be harvested and utilized, it would be a substantial energy source.
Conventional solid-state thermoelectric technology uses electrons or holes as the working fluid for heat pumping and power generation based on the Seebeck effect and offers thermal-to-electrical energy conversion technology for generating electricity from waste heat.1–3 A steady temperature gradient must be maintained in order to generate sustainable electricity. However, in an environment where the temperature would be spatially uniform without a gradient according to the principle of increased entropy, it is difficult to achieve a large temperature difference. Moreover, the thermal-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency based on commercial thermoelectric materials is still very low.4
Pyroelectricity is one of the least-known properties of solid materials, and it is rigorously defined as the temperature dependence of the spontaneous polarization in certain anisotropic solids.5,6 The spontaneous polarization dipole moment is always nonzero in a pyroelectric material and is equivalent to a layer of bound charge on each flat surface of a pyroelectric thin film. The pyroelectric effect will reveal the net dipole moment (or bound charge) change with temperature variation that can be measured as an electric current from an external circuit.
Devices based on pyroelectric materials have many advantages, such as easy integration with on-chip circuitry, uncooled detection, room-temperature operation, high speed, low system cost, portability, and a wide spectral response with high sensitivity. These devices have been successfully used in many applications, such as pollution monitoring, hot image detector devices, intruder alarms, and gas analysis.7–10 However, pyroelectricity has often been abandoned as a practical energy source due to its low efficiency.11 Recently, pyroelectric energy conversion has attracted more attention.12 Cuadras et al. report a pyroelectric cell that can produce electricity from cyclic temperature fluctuations and charge a 1 μF capacitor to supply low-power autonomous sensors.13 Wang et al. fabricated pyroelectric nanogenerators based on ZnO nanorod arrays, KNbO3 nanorods, and lead zirconate titanate film, and hybrid energy cells were used for simultaneously harvesting thermal, mechanical, and solar energy.14,15 However, the output voltage and current for pyroelectric cells or generators based on inorganic pyroelectric materials are still relatively low (voltage below 22 V, and current below 170 nA).16 An organic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been recently used for a pyroelectric nanogenerator17 due to its promising pyroelectric properties, with a pyroelectric coefficient up to 200 μC m−2 K−1.18–22 Although it functions as only one component in a hybrid energy cell that harvests energy, it reveals the outstanding pyroelectricity of PVDF.
The thermal sources for producing time-dependent temperature variations (dT/dt) utilized by all the energy-generating devices based on the pyroelectric effect depend on electrical heaters.14–16,22–24 However, none of these are capable of producing energy from the environment. Until now, there has been no report on pyroelectric generators that harvest heat energy solely from hot/cold water.
In this work, we made a pyroelectric generator (PEG) based on a PVDF film for harvesting heat energy from hot/cold water, which widely exists in industrial processes such as oil refining, steel making, and glass making or produced by nature such as geothermal heat, volcanic heat, and solar heat. Hot water can be obtained from solar energy water heaters daily in every house. To achieve practical application, the device simply contacts a hot flow and cold flow alternately to produce time-dependent temperature variations. Although the periodic moving device to contact hot and cold flows is driven automatically by an electric oscillator, this driving force would be replaced by water flow after the implementation of a suitable mechanical design, such as in ancient water mills. The output open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current can reach a maximum of 192 V and 12 μA, respectively, under a temperature change of 80 °C. The output power density can reach 14 μW cm−2, which is a great improvement compared to current thermoelectric devices. The prepared pyroelectric generator can drive 42 green light emitting diodes (LEDs) or charge a commercial capacitor (100 μF) to 3.3 V in 90 s. Compared to other nanogenerators, including piezoelectric nanogenerators based on pressure or bending25–28 or triboelectric nanogenerators used to harvest airflow energy,29,30 vibration energy,31,32 and rotary energy,33 our pyroelectric generator provides a promising strategy for efficiently harvesting waste heat from the ambient environment and presents significant progress in thermoelectric conversion technology.
Experimental
PVDF film with a thickness of 110 μm was purchased from Measurement Specialties (US). A 10 μm thick layer of copper was sputtered onto each side of the PVDF film, as shown in Fig. 1. The Cu layers on the PVDF film worked as electrodes. Two Cu wires were fixed on the surfaces of the top and bottom Cu layers with silver paste to link the device to the external instrument. To ensure stable contact with the Cu layer and Cu wire, an epoxy AB adhesive was used to cover the joint. Then, the entire device was covered with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thin film with a thickness of 30 μm to prevent conductivity by water. The commercial capacitor in the charging experiment is an aluminum electrolytic capacitor (100 μF, 16 V) with a package size of 25 mm × 25 mm.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram (a) and digital photograph (b) of a pyroelectric generator based on the PVDF film. 
The hot/cold flows were pumped through two plastic tubes that allowed the water to flow down so that the film of the PEG was parallel to the water flows. Two thermoelectric couples were used to monitor the temperature of the hot/cold flow. The PEG was alternately driven to contact the hot flow and cold flow by an electric oscillator (JZK-5). The output current was measured by a current preamplifier (Stanford Research SR 570).
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the pyroelectric generator (PEG) contains three layers, with two thin exterior layers of Cu working as top and bottom electrodes and an interior PVDF film acting as the pyroelectric material. From Fig. 1b, the length and width of the device is about 30 mm × 30 mm. The thickness of the PVDF film is 110 μm, and the deposited Cu layer is approximately 10 μm. The excellent conductivity of Cu helps to effectively transfer induced electrons from the polarization fluctuation of the PVDF film to the external circuit. Thin Cu layers are required in order to rapidly transport heat from water to the PVDF film to change its polarization state. Heat energy is harvested by simple alternating contact of the device with the hot flow (40, 60, 80 °C) and cold flow (0 °C).

Fig. 2 illustrates our experimental setup. Two pumps are used to lift the cold and hot water to a higher level. The distance between the two flows is approximately 3–4 cm. The device is driven to the left and right by an oscillator in order to contact the flows (Fig. S1†). Once the device contacts the flow, there is an instantaneous current signal. The insets in Fig. 2 are photographs showing the PEG in contact with the cold flow (1) and hot flow (2) and the LEDs, which are lit by its output power. This method of harvesting waste heat energy from hot water is an innovation in the development of pyroelectric generators.

Fig. 3a shows the short-circuit current that is generated with a temperature difference of 40 °C between the hot flow and the cold flow. When the PEG contacts the hot flow, positive current peaks are detected, and conversely, negative current is detected when the PEG contacts the cold flow. The maximum current value is measured to be 5.79 μA. To investigate the effect of the temperature differences on the output current, we conducted two additional experiments with temperature differences of 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively. The corresponding output currents are shown in Fig. 3b and c. Obviously, with the increase in the temperature of the hot flow, the current increases. With a temperature difference of 80 °C, the current reaches a maximum of approximately 11 μA (Fig. 3c). We notice that there are asymmetric current responses in Fig. 3, as exhibited by current peaks that always have a cleaner and faster response when the PEG is switched from the hot flow to cold flow (seen as rapid change from a positive peak to a negative one). These asymmetric current responses are caused by the different mechanical vibrations that occur when the PEG is switched from the hot flow to cold flow, which can be avoided by a manual switch, as shown in Fig. 4a.

In order to ensure sufficient contact of the PVDF film with the hot or cold flow, we manually controlled the device to contact the hot water and the cold water alternately in two beakers (Fig. S2 and Video 1†). Fig. 4a shows the output current versus time when the PEG periodically contacts the hot and cold flows. The whole period from contact to separation between the hot and cold flows is approximately 1.4736 s, which can be counted from the recorded data in Fig. 4a. We enlarge one period to see the details, as shown in Fig. 4b. Once the device contacts the hot water (80 °C), the temperature of the PVDF film immediately rises, with a rapid increase of current from zero to a peak within 0.05 s, which also can be seen from Fig. S3.†
The pyroelectric current I can be determined by the equation I = pAdT/dt(1)where p, A and dT/dt are the pyroelectric coefficient, effective area of the device, and rate of change in temperature, respectively.15,34 In this work, the time for the device to contact the hot flow or cold flow is quite short. Thus, the real temperature of the PVDF film cannot be the same as that of the hot flow or cold flow instantaneously. We assume that the temperature around the surface of the PVDF film rises or drops to a certain temperature between those of the hot flow and cold flow. We also use Comsol Multiphysics software to simulate the temperature on the pVDF. Before the device makes contact with the hot water, the temperature of the PVDF film is equal to that of the room temperature (20 °C). Then it increases rapidly after the device sinks into the hot water. The temperature distribution in a cross-section of the PVDF film is shown in Fig. 4c, from which we can apparently see the temperature change at the moment when the device is put into hot water (80 °C). In the cross-section, the PVDF film with a thickness of 110 μm is covered by a 10 μm Cu layer on both surfaces, and the Cu layer is covered by PVC with a thickness of 30 μm. The temperature across the thickness is not uniform as the PVDF film has a thickness of 110 μm. Because of the symmetry of the device, we set the film thickness along the X direction with X = 0 in the middle of the cross-section. The temperature at the X = 0 plane is the lowest, and the film surface is the highest. Then the temperature at the X = 0 plane and the surface is chosen to calculate the output current. The corresponding current values are 11.42 μA and 14.58 μA, as calculated by eqn (1). The temperature distribution across the thickness when the device contacts cold water is also simulated, as shown in Fig. S4.†
During this process, the temperature at the surface rises rapidly up to 50 °C and then to 72 °C. Subsequently, the device is taken out of the hot water and quickly put into the cold water, where the PVDF film instantaneously cools down. The maximum temperature difference reaches 23.3 °C at the moment when the device is inserted into the cold water (0 °C), as illustrated in Fig. S4.† Using eqn (1), we work out the maximum output currents, which are 14.58 μA and 11.32 μA when contacting hot water and cold water, respectively. These results are close to those (12.58 μA and 11.23 μA) obtained in the experiment in Fig. 4a. The temperature difference and distribution of the PVDF film in the hot water at 60 °C and 40 °C are also simulated (Fig. S5 and S6†). By simulation and calculation, we have further verified the pyroelectric equation.
To illustrate the mechanism of the pyroelectric generator, a schematic sketch is presented in Fig. 5. As molecular thermal motion depends on temperature; the direction of molecules with a spontaneous electric dipole is greatly affected by molecular thermal motion. In an ideal situation, all dipoles of molecules would align along one direction without wiggling (vibration) back and forth at absolute zero. As the temperature increases, the dipoles would diverge in direction and wiggle around their respective pole axes due to the thermal motion. Therefore, the axis direction of dipoles is more diverse, and the wiggling angle θ enlarges at higher temperature.15,22,35 The changes due to the thermal fluctuations in hot/cold water are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. S7† shows the relationship between the maximum wiggling distance and angle θ. No output current is observed, as spontaneous polarization is constant under invariable temperature (Fig. 5a). When the device contacts the hot flow, as the temperature of the PVDF film increases rapidly, the electric dipoles oscillate within a larger angle θ1 with respect to the original angle θ(θ1 > θ), which significantly reduces the intensity of spontaneous polarization. A flow of electrons from the top electrode to the bottom one is generated due to the decrease in the induced charges in the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5b. Conversely, when the device contacts the cold flow, the electric dipoles oscillate within a smaller angle θ2 due to less active thermal motion. Thus, the polarization is remarkably enhanced, which increases the induced charges in the electrodes. Then, a flow of electrons from the bottom electrode to the top one is detected, as shown in Fig. 5c.
 Fig. 5  Schematic sketch of the pyroelectric generating mechanism. The diagrams are showing no output without temperature change (a), the bound charge change caused from the polarization state change and external current flow after contacting hot flow (b), and cold flow (c). 
PVDF is also a piezoelectric material, and thus, the piezoelectric effect might contribute to the output power by expanding/shrinking the film volume at varying temperatures. To explore the origination of the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects, it should be noted that both effects are caused by the polarization of the dipole moment of molecules, which results in bound charge variation on the surface of the PVDF film. Therefore, all variation of the dipole moment polarization of molecules caused by temperature change can be regarded as a pyroelectric effect.
To study the conversion efficiency of the PEG, the output power was measured. Fig. 6 shows the output peak power, current, and voltage as a function of load resistance for the PEG under various temperature differences. As the load resistance increases, the output current decreases while the corresponding open-circuit voltage increases (Fig. 6a–c). Moreover, as the temperature of the hot flow increases from 40 °C to 80 °C, the maximum open-circuit voltage increases accordingly from 93.6 V to 192.6 V. The output power firstly ascends and then descends with the increase in the load resistance (Fig. 6d–f). When the external load is 20 MΩ, the output power reaches a maximum of 32.1 μW (ΔT = 40 °C), 76.4 μW (ΔT = 60 °C), and 126.2 μW (ΔT = 80 °C). Similarly, the maximum output power increases as the temperature of the hot flow increases. These facts demonstrate that a higher temperature difference generates larger open-circuit voltage, output current, and output power, which are attributed to the enhancement of the change rate of spontaneous polarization under a higher temperature difference. As far as we know, none of the previously published experiments with pyroelectric generators reported open-circuit voltage and output power as high as what we have obtained, which is a result of the efficient heat transport for our device in hot/cold water.

In order to understand the high output voltage of the PEG, we simulated the electrical potential distribution of the PVDF film in the cross-section under the alternate interactions of the hot flow at 80 °C and the cold flow at 0 °C by using Comsol Multiphysics software. According to eqn (1), the change of surface-bound charge density can be expressed as: Δσ = IΔt/A = pΔT(2)
Along the thickness of the PVDF film, the potential difference U between the top and bottom electrodes can be given by (3)where E is the electric field intensity, d is the thickness of the PVDF film, and εr and ε0 are the relative and vacuum dielectric constants, respectively. In the simulation, the top Cu layer is connected to ground, and the pyroelectric coefficient (p) of the PVDF film is 2.7 nC cm−2 K−1.36,37 The electrical potential distribution can be observed in the cross-section of the PVDF film in which the maximum potential is approximately 774 V, as shown in Fig. 7a. In our work, the maximum output voltage is approximately 192 V, which is smaller than that of the simulation. As the PVDF film does not fully contact with the flows (Fig. S1†), there is a difference between the experimental data and the simulated result. In order to isolate the device from water, the PVC thin film attached to the surface of the device would affect the transmission of heat. The temperature distribution measured for the PVC film is presented in Fig. 4c.

PVDF is also functioned as a piezoelectric material.38,39 To eliminate the piezoelectric effect of the PVDF film caused by the mechanical beating of the water flow, a comparative experiment was performed. We use flows at ambient temperature to replace both the hot flow and cold flow so that the PEG moves between two flows without a temperature difference. The output current is depicted in Fig. 7b, indicating that the current generated from the piezoelectric effect is approximately 1–2 μA. Compared with the output current above, we demonstrate that the pyroelectric effect plays a leading role in this work.
In addition to the temperature differences, we studied the contact frequency of the device. Fig. 8a–f shows the output current at different contact frequencies (left) and the quantity of charge transfer in half a cycle per second (right) of the PEG under various temperature differences. It reveals that the output current increases as the contact frequency increases. After reaching the maximum at the frequency of 5 Hz, the current begins to decrease because the time for the PDVF film to contact the flow decreases with the increases in contact frequency. Although the temperature difference in the PDVF between hot-cold contacts may decrease with increase in frequency, the reduction is not large enough to reduce the temperature change rate due to the good heat conductivity of the Cu layer. Consequently, the output current is enhanced as the rate of temperature change rises sustainably (<5 Hz). However, if the frequency is higher than 5 Hz, not much heat transfers from the flow to the PVDF film within a short contact time, and then the temperature change rate decreases. Thus, the output current decreases gradually with the increase in the contact frequency of the device. Comparing Fig. 8b, d and f, the quantity of charge transfer increases as the temperature difference increases due to the enhancement of the output current, especially under the hot flow of 60 °C and 80 °C. In particular, the quantity of charge transfer per second under the hot flow at 80 °C is 4.52 μC at 7 Hz, which reveals the potential application for charging storage devices such as Li-ion batteries and capacitors. The detailed calculation for the charge transfer quantity per second is shown in Fig. S8.†
 Fig. 8  Output current at different contact frequencies of the device and the corresponding quantity of the charge transfer per second at the temperatures of 40 °C (a and b), 60 °C (c and d), and 80 °C (e and f). 
To test the real output power and explore the potential application of the PEG, we used the PEG to directly drive LEDs. The LEDs in Line 1 are linked in series for receiving the forward output, while the LEDs in Line 2 are linked in series for receiving the reverse output. The circuit is shown in Fig. 9a. When the PEG contacts the hot flow (80 °C), 42 LEDs in Line 2 instantly light up, and when the PEG contacts the cold flow (0 °C), 26 LEDs in Line 1 instantly light up, as demonstrated in the photographs in Fig. 9b and c.
 Fig. 9  The equivalent circuit used to power the LEDs (a). The optical images of LEDs lit up when contacting the hot flow at 80 °C (b) and cold flow at 0 °C (c). 
The process of driving LEDs is demonstrated in Video 2.† The current obtained from the hot flow is larger than that from the cold flow, which can also be seen in Fig. 3. It reveals that the output signals really come from our PEG, which simply harvests energy from the hot flow and the cold flow. We also use hot water flows of 60 °C and 40 °C to light up LEDs, as shown in Video 3 and 4.† A literature review reveals no previous reports of a method that is able to light up these numbers of LEDs using pyroelectric devices.
According to the charge transfer quantity described above, the PEG has the potential ability to store the electrical energy generated from the temperature difference between hot flows and cold flows into a storage device such as a capacitor. We chose a commercial capacitor (100 μF) to use in a charging test. The working frequency of the PEG is 5 Hz, and the temperature difference between the hot flow and the cold flow is 80 °C. The equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10a. Fig. 10b shows the charging current–time signals within 20 s, indicating that the charging current is slightly smaller than the short-current. Fig. 10c gives the charging voltage–time curve of the capacitor, from which we can observe that the capacitor is charged from 0 V to 3.3 V in 90 s. The electrical energy stored in the capacitor can drive a green LED (Fig. 10d) for approximately 60 s. Fig. 10e shows an optical image of the lit LED.

Based on the investigations of directly driving LEDs and charging a capacitor to light up a LED, we can conclude that our PEG can effectively harvest energy from hot water and transfer thermal energy into electrical energy. Moreover, the pyroelectric efficiency is relatively high compared with other devices. Our PEG may be effectively applied to harvest energy from hot water generated by factories and households in the future.
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and fabricated a pyroelectric generator based on the pyroelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film and successfully harvested thermal energy under the automatically alternating contact of hot and cold water flows. The working mechanism of the PEG is discussed in terms of polarization and thermal oscillation of the electric dipoles in the PVDF film. The temperature of the PVDF film before and after contacting hot or cold water is simulated to confirm the output current generated from the PEG. The calculated result is quite close to the experimental result. The output open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current reach a maximum of 192 V and 12 μA cm−2, respectively, under a temperature change of 80 °C. The output surface and volumetric power density can reach 14 μW cm−2 (1.08 W cm−3), which is a great improvement for thermoelectric devices. In order to understand the high output voltage of the device, the electrical potential distribution across a PVDF film is simulated, in which the theoretical output voltage is higher than the experimental result, indicating that the output power could be further improved. The electrical energy generated by the PEG can light up 42 LEDs when the device contacts the hot flow, and it can be also used to charge a commercial capacitor (90 s, 3.3 V) that can light up a green LED for 60 s. The present results suggest that the PEG could be potentially used to supply energy for storage devices and self-powered electronic devices.
