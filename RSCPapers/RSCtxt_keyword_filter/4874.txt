Dye-sensitized solar cells with these ternary compounds as counter electrodes (CEs) showed photovoltaic performance similar to the devices made with noble metal platinum CE (7.46%).Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention as low-cost alternatives to traditional photovoltaic devices.1,2 In DSSCs, counter electrodes (CEs) with both excellent electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity are indispensable to obtain a low overvoltage and to accelerate the regeneration of I− from I3−. Due to the fact that noble metal Pt, the most widely used material for CEs at present, is very expensive, studies have recently been made extensively on low-cost Pt-like alternatives, including carbon-based materials,3 conducting polymers,4 and metals in the form of oxides,5 sulfides,6–10 selenides,11 nitrides,12 and carbides,13 and great promise has been demonstrated in this field. Extension of the CE materials to ternary compounds may greatly expand this research platform. Catalysts based on molybdenum or tungsten sulfides have been widely used for hydrodesulfurization and hydrogen evolution reaction by electrocatalysis, and introduction of Co or Ni promoters into these matrices results in significant enhancement in the catalytic activities.14–16 Kanatzidis et al.17 have most recently reported the synthesis of porous CoMoS4 and NiMoS4via facile solution reactions. In this work, we have applied these ternary materials with and without graphite additives as the counter electrodes in DSSCs. The resulting photovoltaic devices showed power conversion efficiency up to 7.31%, comparable to the DSSCs made with an expensive platinum-based counter electrode (7.46%).Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (NH4)2MoS4 was obtained by the reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and (NH4)2S aqueous solution at ambient temperature. CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 were synthesized as previously described.17 Briefly, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and (NH4)2MoS4 were dissolved in formamide separately, and then Co or Ni precursor solution was added into the tetrathiomolybdate solution. In these reactions, cationic species of VIII group metals interacted with thiomolybdate anions, leading to precipitation of solids. As the polymerization proceeded, the viscosity of the solution increased, which eventually solidified to a monolithic black gel. It took 7–14 days for the viscous solution to transform into a rigid gel. The products were then annealed at 300 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).Both Ni- and Co-based chalcogels were found to be amorphous, as indicated by the predominant broad features in the XRD patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†). A similar result has been reported in the literature.17 HRTEM (Fig. 1a and b) images did not show a clear crystal lattice except for a few short tiny fringes, further confirming the amorphous nature of these materials. EDS and elemental mapping revealed that all elements were homogeneously distributed (Fig. 1c and d) with almost stoichiometric atomic ratios for CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). Fig. 1  HRTEM images of (a) CoMoS4 and (b) NiMoS4, respectively, (c) elemental mapping of the materials revealing the presence of homogeneous distribution of Co, Ni, Mo and S elements. The scale bar is 50 nm. The chemical species present on the surface of these materials were evaluated by XPS. Fig. 2 shows the Ni 2p, Co 2p and Mo 3d XPS spectra of CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 samples. A doublet of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 appears, with binding energy (B.E.) values of 229.9 eV and 233.0 eV for CoMoS4 while 229.8 eV and 232.9 eV for NiMoS4, confirming that molybdenum is in its VI oxidation state, which is similar to that in the (NH4)2[MoVIS4] precursor.18,19 In the CoMoS4 catalysts, the Co 2p3/2 binding energy (779.7 eV) is higher than the Co9S8 energy (778.5 eV) and close to that for a Co–Mo–S phase reported by Okamoto20 and Alstrup et al.,21 it would indicate that Co2+ ions are bonded to MoS42−, leading to the formation of the CoMoS4 phase. Similarly, Ni 2p3/2 with B.E. values of 853.7 eV can be ascribed to Ni(II) species that are bonded to MoS42−, resulting in the formation of the NiMoS4 phase. Fig. 2  XPS spectra of the CoMoS4 and NiMoS4. The obtained materials were then ultrasonically dispersed in isopropanol for 30 min, resulting in CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 slurry, which was subsequently sprayed onto FTO to form CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 counter electrodes. To improve the conductivity of the electrode, graphite was added into the catalyst precursor (detailed information is provided in ESI†), and the resultant slurry was then sprayed onto FTO glass to obtain CEs of CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C.To investigate the catalytic activity of the as-prepared counter electrodes toward the reduction of I3−, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with these electrodes in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 3a shows the CVs of the five electrodes (i.e., CoMoS4, NiMoS4, CoMoS4-C, NiMoS4-C, and Pt). All of the electrodes exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks. The relative negative pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, whereas the positive pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3−.11,22 When graphite was added into the catalyst, the cathodic and anodic peak currents increased and the peak separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks (Epp) decreased simultaneously, indicating that the graphite can improve the catalytic activity for I3− reduction due to better conductivity. Though the cathodic and anodic peak current densities of the CoMoS4 and NiMoS4-based CEs are lower than those of the Pt electrode, the Epp of the CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C CEs becomes relatively lower. The Epp value is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction, which is an important parameter for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs.23 The Epp values for CoMoS4-C (70 mV) and NiMoS4-C (76 mV) are much smaller than that for Pt CE (115 mV) (more information is provided in Table S3, ESI†). This is immediately responsible for the lower overpotential losses in the CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C CEs than in the Pt CE.

(d) J–V characteristics of DSSCs with different CEs, measured at AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). To further elucidate the catalytic activity of the CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 samples in the reduction of I3− in the DSSC system, we performed the electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) test using symmetrical cells constructed with two identical CEs and investigated the charge transfer process at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The resulting Nyquist plots of five electrodes are presented in Fig. 3b. The high frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs) including the sheet resistance of two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. The left semicircle in the high-frequency range corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode–electrolyte interface for the I3− reduction and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE). And the right semicircle in the low-frequency range reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple transport in the electrolyte. The Nyquist plots for the five CEs were fitted using the Z-view software with an equivalent circuit diagram, as shown in Fig. 3b, which gives the EIS parameters displayed in Table 1. The Rs values of CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 are 14.0 Ω and 15.8 Ω, respectively, both of them are higher than that of Pt (8.2 Ω), which may be caused by the slightly lower conductivity of the two electrodes. After adding graphite into the sample, the Rs values did not decrease evidently, which may be attributed to the poor adhesive strength between the CE layer and the FTO glass with the adjunction of graphite, causing the larger contact resistance to worsen the conductivity.24 The Rct value for CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 is 15 Ω and 7.6 Ω, respectively, which is larger than that of Pt CE (4.7 Ω), indicating they should show poorer catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− than Pt. Nevertheless, the CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C CEs demonstrate lower Rct of 3.3 Ω and 2.5 Ω, which means that both CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C CE could show a better performance than Pt for reducing I3−. These results are in agreement with the CV measurement.

Fig. 3c shows the Tafel curves of the cells based on the five fabricated electrodes and the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of the voltage. In the Tafel zone and the diffusion zone, we can obtain information on the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), which correlates closely with the catalytic activity of the catalysts.22 In the Tafel zone, the anodic and cathodic branch of the curve shows a large slope for CoMoS4, NiMoS4, CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C as compared to Pt, indicating high J0 on these electrodes according to the Tafel equation. These results indicated that the catalytic activity of CoMoS4, NiMoS4, CoMoS4-C and NiMoS4-C is sufficient to catalyze the reduction of triiodide to iodide. The result is in good agreement with the EIS values in terms of eqn (1), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.13 (1) (2) In Fig. 3c, the Jlim values of the five electrodes are of the same magnitude. This finding indicates that there is a similar diffusion coefficient in the symmetrical dummy cell according to eqn (2), where D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the triiodide concentration.The DSSCs with different CEs were fabricated under the same conditions (see ESI†). Fig. 3d compares the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Both the DSSCs with CoMoS4 CE and NiMoS4 CE produced a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 5%, mainly arising from the obviously lower Jsc compared to that of the devices with Pt CE. The PCE was improved to more than 7% after a little graphite was added, and the highest PCE of 7.31% was obtained for the NiMoS4-C CE, which was comparable to that of the Pt-based reference cell. Therefore, the enhanced Voc and improved Jsc for the graphite-containing CEs should be responsive to such superior performance, which could arise from better conductivity that speeds up the reduction of I3−.In summary, we have demonstrated that porous chalcogels CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 showed good electrocatalytic activity in the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−. The DSSCs using these materials as CEs showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.95% and 5.27%, which were further improved to 7.31% and 7.14% after addition of graphite, which are comparable to the device made with expensive platinum electrode (7.46%) in the same device configuration. This study may provide a new route to preparing low-cost and highly efficient counter electrodes alternative to the noble metal Pt in the application of DSSCs.We acknowledge the “Hundred Talents Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. NSFC 20873141), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. NSFC 51273032) for the financial support.Notes and referencesB.
