    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 27th June 2017AbstractA generally applicable synthetic method for all-conjugated graft copolymers is presented. By using an PCDTBT acceptor backbone and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) grafts, all conjugated graft copolymers are synthesized using a grafting-through strategy which permits independent control over the graft length, graft density and backbone length. A TBT-P3HT macromonomer is synthesized using Suzuki coupling of H-P3HT-Br to yield mono-ethynyl functionalized P3HT quantitatively. Mono-functionalized ethynyl-P3HT is subsequently converted into a TBTBr2-graft-P3HT macromonomer using click chemistry, which allows the attachment of the P3HT chains to the polymer backbone though flexible, non-conjugated alkyl chains. PCDTBT is made by a Suzuki polycondensation in the presence of TBTBr2-graft-P3HT (“grafting through”) to give well-defined graft copolymers whose grafting density is determined by the ratio of TBTBr2/TBTBr2-g-P3HT. High molecular weight products of the type PCDTBT-graft-P3HT that are free of any P3HT homopolymer are obtained, which exhibit superimposed absorption of the individual components and quenching of P3HT photoluminescence. P3HT in PCDTBT-graft-P3HT shows a similar degree of crystallinity to that of the macromonomer TBTBr2-graft-P3HT, indicating that most of the P3HT chains in PCDTBT-graft-P3HT are able to crystallize. Thermally annealed thin films exhibit a phase separated structure on the 10–20 nm length scale suitable for exciton diffusion and separation.
Introduction
Precise control over nanostructure formation is key to the reliable functioning of electronic devices in which the efficacy of the excitonic and electronic processes in thin films determines performance.1–3 In organic solar cells, exciton diffusion commonly occurs within only several nanometres, which calls for intimately mixed morphologies of two complementary electronic materials, a donor material and an acceptor material.4 The hitherto most successful approach to bulk heterojunction solar cells is to mix two (partially) immiscible compounds in an organic solvent, and fabricate thin films in such a way that the resulting morphology is a partially demixed, kinetically trapped structure that is most suitable for exciton diffusion, exciton separation and charge transport.5–7 Although this approach, which often uses conjugated donor polymers and fullerene derivatives, is unsurpassed in terms of power conversion efficiency, it does not enable a detailed prediction of the blend morphology, enable thermodynamic control or prevent long-term phase separation during the operation of modules. Owing to their thermodynamically stable and predictable nanostructures, donor–acceptor block copolymers with suitably chosen electronic properties have long been proposed to be ideal candidates for thin film solar cells.1–3,8–22 However, as chemical synthesis is challenging and upscaling may be an issue, such materials may alternatively serve as compatibilizers in ternary systems, in which case much less block copolymer material is required.23–29 Block copolymers made of two conjugated segments, namely an electron acceptor and an electron donor segment, are promising candidates to compatibilize all-conjugated polymer blends for photovoltaics. However, when it comes to phase separation of such complex architectures, intrinsic similarity of all-conjugated diblock copolymers, which exhibit mostly rigid aromatic backbones and flexible alkyl side chains, coupled with usually small degrees of polymerization, may not result in sufficiently large interaction parameters and hence in microphase separation.17,30 We have recently shown that changing the side chains of the PCDTBT block in PCDTBT-block-P3HT block copolymers from alkyl to semifluoroalkyl leads to microphase separation and nanostructured donor–acceptor morphologies and allows compatibilization to take place efficiently.31,32 Given this successful but synthetically tedious strategy, alternative convergent pathways to well-defined donor–acceptor block copolymers are required that allow independent control over individual block lengths, overall molecular weight, block ratio, and facile permutation of building blocks. To this end, conjugated graft copolymers are intriguing materials which can be prepared by “grafting from”, “grafting to” and “grafting through” approaches (Scheme 1). While grafting strategies are ubiquitous in the field of general polymer science, a limited number of examples of all-conjugated graft copolymers with two p-type segments or p-type and n-type segments have been reported.33–35 Here, we present a detailed, well-optimized and general synthetic approach for all-conjugated donor–acceptor graft copolymers having a polymeric acceptor backbone and P3HT grafts. Exemplified by PCDTBT as the electron acceptor block in combination with P3HT as the donor,31,36 high molecular weight PCDTBT-graft-P3HT graft copolymers are constructed that are free of any P3HT homopolymer and that show the expected properties of covalently linked donor and acceptor segments, for example, quenched photoluminescence and microphase separation on a length scale of 10–20 nm.

Results and discussion
Ethynyl-functionalized P3HT is a widely used precursor material to construct conjugated block copolymers with P3HT using click chemistry.16,37–41 P3HT-ethynyl can be made in a most straightforward way by quenching the nickel-catalyzed Kumada Catalyst Transfer Polycondensation (KCTP) of 2-bromo-5-chloromagnesio-3-hexylthiophene with an excess of ethynyl magnesium chloride.37 While this method was reported to yield exclusively mono-ethynyl-P3HT due to complexation of the ethynyl group to nickel, thus preventing ring walking of Ni(0) and additional functionalization at the opposite side of the chain,42,43 we found the formation of ∼10% bis-ethynyl functionalized P3HT from MALDI-ToF and 1H NMR experiments when using this method (Scheme 2A and Fig. SI1†). As the presence of bis-ethynyl functionalized P3HT leads to cross-linked material upon further functionalization within a grafting through approach, we abandoned the in situ functionalization of P3HT made by conventionally initiated KCTP and investigated the external initiation of P3HT with tolyl-based Ni-initiators to block one chain end, followed by quenching of the other end with an excess of ethynyl magnesium chloride (Scheme 2B).44 However, the quantitative hetero bis-functionalization of P3HT appeared to be challenging as well, with the external initiation process being accompanied by conventional initiation and the quenching procedure being incomplete. Thus, we used conventional initiation giving perfectly asymmetric end groups of the type H-P3HT-Br, which can be quantitatively post-functionalized under Suzuki conditions to introduce a TIPS-protected phenyl-ethynyl group (Scheme 2C). The variation of the reaction parameters such as the catalyst, base, and solvent was necessary to drive the reaction to completion, to suppress debromination and to eliminate homocoupling reactions of H-P3HT-Br leading to H-P3HT-H and H-P3HT-P3HT-H, respectively. Pd[PPh3]4 as a catalyst, Cs2CO3 as a base and THF as a solvent allowed for the quantitative introduction of the TIPS-protected ethynyl group leading to H-P3HT-Ph-ethynyl-TIPS, as shown by MALDI-ToF, SEC and 1H NMR analyses (Scheme 2 and Fig. 1).

With mono-functional H-P3HT-Ph-ethynyl-TIPS in hand, a macromonomer TBTBr2-graft-P3HT was designed and synthesized from an asymmetric TBT monomer with an azide-functionalized hexyl side chain (Scheme 3). The one-pot reaction including deprotection of H-P3HT-Ph-ethynyl-TIPS and clicking the ethynyl function and the azide occurred quantitatively, as shown by detailed MALDI-ToF, SEC and NMR characterization studies (Fig. 2). Quantitative conversion of this reaction is seen from MALDI-ToF spectra (Fig. 2a) and also from the proton NMR spectra, which show a characteristic shift of the para-substituted phenyl ring (protons 7 and 8) next to the P3HT chain (Fig. 2b). The MALDI-ToF spectra of further end-functional P3HT derivatives used in this work are shown in the ESI (Fig. SI2–SI7†). During the final click reaction a small amount of homocoupling occurs as can be seen from SEC (see Fig. SI8†).

Using TBTBr2-graft-P3HT with two different P3HT molecular weights of Mn,NMR = 6 and 12 kg mol−1 as comonomers for the synthesis of a PCDTBT-graft-P3HT under Suzuki polycondensation conditions, the grafting density can be easily adjusted by the dibromide comonomer ratio of TBTBr2/TBTBr2-graft-P3HT (Scheme 4). Here, small amounts of TBTBr2-graft-P3HT were used to access roughly symmetric compositions of P3HT and PCDTBT by weight (Table 1). Standard Suzuki conditions were employed for graft copolymer synthesis, using Pd2dba3 with SPhos and K2CO3 in a toluene/water mixture. Although we recently reported that these conditions led to small amounts of carbazole homocoupling which are detrimental to solar cell performance of PCDTBT based solar cells, the combination of a catalyst precursor that can be handled in air together with a phosphine is simpler to handle compared to the alternative Pd[PPh3]4, which requires the use of a glovebox. To avoid molecular weights that are too high, leading to limited solubility of the product, the reaction temperatures and times were limited to 80 °C and 1 d, respectively.

The products were extracted using methanol, acetone and hexanes (to remove salts, catalysts and residual monomers (if any)), dichloromethane (to remove short chains), and finally chloroform and chlorobenzene (to extract the remaining solids). The data shown in Table 1 are from the chlorobenzene fractions. Using high temperature SEC in TCB at 150 °C, the absence of any P3HT macromonomer can be clearly seen (Fig. 3, SI9 and SI10†). High-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy clearly confirms the covalent incorporation of TBTBr2-graft-P3HT into PCDTBT (Fig. 4). The graft copolymer composition can be easily determined from both the aromatic signals and the aliphatic side chain signals, showing P3HT weight fractions between ∼20 and 45 wt% and the corresponding grafting densities between 1.3 and 9.2% (Table 1). Higher grafting densities are possible in principle but were not attempted as the solubility of PCDTBT-graft-P3HT strongly increased with the increase of graft density.

The optical properties of PCDTBT-graft-P3HT were first assessed in solution. UV-vis spectroscopy of PCDTBT-graft-P3HT in chlorobenzene shows the superposition of absorption bands of individual P3HT and PCDTBT blocks. Also photoluminescence of PCDTBT-graft-P3HT in solution is a combination of P3HT and PCDTBT luminescence, with a stronger contribution from PCDTBT than from P3HT (Fig. 5a). This behavior is more prevalent when varying the excitation wavelength from 395 nm (maximum of the π–π* transition of PCDTBT) to 465 nm (maximum P3HT absorption), 505 nm (roughly similar absorption for both P3HT and PCDTBT) and finally to 560 nm (almost exclusive PCDTBT absorption). For all these excitation wavelengths, emission comes mostly from PCDTBT. Only when exciting the P3HT absorption maximum at 465 nm, an enhanced P3HT emission is seen from PCDTBT-graft-P3HT; however, a major contribution still comes from PCDTBT. In other words, energy transfer occurs from P3HT to PCDTBT in solution enabled by the different band gaps of 2.2 and 1.9 eV, respectively.45

To probe crystallinity and provide indications for a possible microphase separation, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of PCDTBT-graft-P3HT was performed and the results were compared to the individual components. Both PCDTBT-graft-P3HT 13 and 15 with high and low P3HT molecular weights of 6 and 12 kg mol−1 showed clear melting and crystallization events of the P3HT graft (Fig. 6). Further DSC results on samples 14 and 16 are shown in the ESI (Fig. SI11 and SI12†). While the melting points Tm of P3HT in PCDTBT-graft-P3HT were similar to those of the corresponding macromonomer TBTBr2-graft-P3HT, the crystallization temperatures Tc of P3HT were lower due to the covalent connectivity in PCDTBT-graft-P3HT, which hinders crystallization. The melting enthalpies of TBTBr2-graft-P3HT are ∼16 J g−1 corresponding to ∼ 50% crystallinity.46,47 With the degrees of crystallinity of pristine H-P3HT-Br being 50–75% depending on mostly molecular weight and dispersity,48 the values for TBTBr2-graft-P3HT of ∼50% are in accordance and indicate that the covalent connectivity of P3HT to the polymerizable TBTBr2 unit can lead to a slight reduction in the degree of crystallinity. Interestingly, comparing the melting enthalpies of P3HT in TBTBr2-graft-P3HT with P3HT in PCDTBT-g-P3HT, a minor difference was found, indicating that approximately the same fraction of P3HT in TBTBr2-graft-P3HT can crystallize as that in PCDTBT-g-P3HT. The latter fact can be a sign of microphase separation of P3HT and PCDTBT, which is a necessary prerequisite for achieving defined morphologies with pure domains that are of utmost importance for undisturbed and complementary electronic processes in donor–acceptor block copolymers (Table 2).

The microstructures of PCDTBT-g-P3HT were further investigated by atom force microscopy (AFM). Upon probing the surface of thermally annealed films, all PCDTBT-g-P3HT samples showed a fibrillary morphology consisting of disordered fibers of 10–20 nm in diameter. As semicrystalline P3HT is able to form fibrils throughout a huge variety of polymer topologies, we assume that P3HT can do so also in PCDTBT-g-P3HT. In that case, PCDTBT forms an amorphous matrix within which P3HT fibers are p-type channels. Interestingly, the two lower molecular weight PCDTBT-g-P3HT samples 14 and 16 exhibit a better defined fibrillar structure compared to the higher molecular weight samples 13 and 15. We assume that the higher melt viscosity of 13 and 15 possibly causes slower kinetics and thus leads to less ordered morphologies for the experimental conditions chosen (Fig. 7). Alternatively, the different grafting densities can, in principle, play a role;35 however, for the low values used here, the interaction of two P3HT chains attached to the same PCDTBT backbone is unlikely to be a major effect. Clearly, although DSC and AFM data can only be indicators for microphase separation, further evidence by X-ray scattering needs to be collected to confirm the assumption made.

Conclusion
We have presented a convergent synthesis of all-conjugated P3HT donor PCDTBT acceptor graft copolymers that permits independent control over the graft length, graft density and backbone length. Using polymer analogous functionalization of P3HT to obtain mono-ethynyl-functionalized P3HT instead of quenching of active P3HT chains with ethynyl magnesium chloride in situ, well-defined P3HT macromonomers can be obtained. Polycondensation of the macromonomer during the synthesis of PCDTBT allows a simple and reliable incorporation of the grafts into the conjugated backbone. The chemical design of the P3HT macromonomer is chosen in such a way that it can be combined with any conjugated backbone structure, including those which exhibit enhanced n-type properties compared to PCDTBT. The non-conjugated linker between the PCDTBT backbone and the P3HT graft electronically decouples the two segments and may additionally provide some flexibility for structure formation. Compared to all-conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers having stiff, conjugated linkers, this can be expected to influence charge dynamics at the heterojunction interface.49,50 Detailed morphological and photophysical studies are required to further elucidate the influence of the spacer moiety on structure formation and optoelectronic performance.
