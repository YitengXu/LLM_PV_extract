    , Accepted 28th September 2018First published on 1st October 2018AbstractMetal sulfide nanostructures, which have been widely studied in recent years, are one of the most promising candidates in energy devices. Herein, coralloid hierarchical structures composed of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle trunks and CuS nanosheet branches are, for the first time, well-constructed on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrates via a multistep route. A seeding assistant strategy is applied to grow uniform and firm metal sulfide films on the FTO substrates. It is revealed that different seeds (i.e., TiO2, CuS and ZnO) all have a positive effect to facilitate the film growth because of their surface roughening behavior on the FTO substrates. Significantly, such three dimensional (3D) Co9S8–CuS electrodes show superior electrocatalytic performance in the reduction reaction of polysulfide electrolyte, and yield an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 4.50% for CdS/CdSe quantum-dot sensitized solar cells as counter electrodes when compared with the one dimensional (1D) Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle (3.25%) and two dimensional (2D) CuS nanosheet (3.83%) electrodes. More impressively, the coralloid structure exhibits excellent stability in the electrochemical cycling tests, keeping 80% current after 500 cycles. Above all, the synthesis strategy here is also feasible to fabricate hybrid Co9S8–CuS films on various flexible substrates, such as carbon cloth, Ti mesh, and Ni foam for potential applications in wearable energy devices.
1. Introduction
Transition metal sulfides have attracted intensive attention due to their superior optical, electrical and chemical properties, as well as their potential applications in photocatalysis, sensors, supercapacitors, and photovoltaic devices.1–4 In the past few years, much effort has been devoted to synthesizing many kinds of metal sulfides with various morphologies, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes or nanowires,5,6 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets or nanoplates,7,8 and three-dimensional (3D) hollow spheres or core–shell hierarchical structures.9,10 Among numerous micro/nano-structures, hybrid materials with hierarchical structures exhibit excellent electrochemical activity owing to the combination of advantages from each single structure.11,12 Many works related to the integration of metal sulfides with metal oxides or carbon materials have been reported in the past few years.10,13–16 In theory, metal sulfides usually possess superior electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, and stability as compared to their corresponding metal oxide counterparts.17 Therefore, the rational combination of different metal sulfides will be feasible to obtain high-performance electrodes for various applications, and several examples have been reported recently, such as Co3S4@MoS2,18 FeCo2S4–NiCo2S4,12 Ni3S2/CoNi2S4,19 and NiS2/CoS2.6 It is indicated that the hybrid metal sulfides with special heterostructures exhibit superiority in the fields of water splitting, energy conversion and storage devices.12,18,19
Among various metal sulfides, inexpensive metal sulfides, such as copper sulfides and cobalt sulfides, which have low resistance and high electrocatalytic activity, have gained great interest for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), water splitting and energy storage devices.20–26 Cobalt sulfides have several stoichiometries, including CoS, Co2S, Co3S4, and Co9S8 with various morphologies, such as nanospheres,23 nanowires,27 and nanosheets.28 Meanwhile, as a well-known p-type semiconductor, copper sulfides also have a series of stoichiometries (e.g., CuS, Cu1.8S and Cu2S) and many nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanosheets and nanocrystals) with attractive electronic, optical, and chemical merits.29–31 In our previous work, different CuxS nanosheet and Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle electrodes were prepared which showed considerable electrocatalytic ability in the reduction of the polysulfide electrolytes, consequently yielding high-performance as counter electrodes (CEs) for QDSCs.20–22,32 Accordingly, it is expected that the incorporation of cobalt and copper sulfides will be beneficial for their electrocatalytic activity as well as stability in the electrochemical cycling tests. This is probably due to the enhanced conductivity and increased active reaction sites derived from the heterojunctions and heterostructures of the hybrid metal sulfide materials.
In this regard, we design coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures consisting of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle trunks decorated with numerous CuS nanosheet branches, which are in situ vertically grown on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrates through a multi-step route combined with chemical and physical processes. The growth process of the hierarchical structures is carefully investigated and discussed. Subsequently, the resultant coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchically structured films are used as CEs in QDSCs, showing improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) for CdS/CdSe QDSCs as compared to the single Co9S8 nanoneedle and CuS nanosheet films. Importantly, such hierarchically structured electrodes possess great stability in electrochemical cycling tests. In particular, the designed fabrication strategy is also applicable for the growth of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures on other substrates, especially flexible and fiber-shaped substrates.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Deposition of different blocking layers on FTO substrates

2.1.1 Deposition of TiO2 blocking layers. 
Fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrates (2 cm × 1.5 cm) with a sheet resistivity of 15 Ω cm−2 are cleaned by ultrasonic agitation in acetone, deionized water and ethanol sequentially for 15 min. The cleaned FTO substrates are first immersed in a 0.18 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then rinsed with deionized water. After being dried in air, the above treated FTO substrates are subjected to an annealing treatment at 550 °C for 60 min to form a thin TiO2 blocking layer.22


2.1.2 Deposition of CuS blocking layers. 
The radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method is applied to deposit CuS blocking layers on the cleaned FTO substrates. Typically, the cleaned FTO substrates are placed in a vacuum chamber, which is then evacuated to a base pressure of 1.0 × 10−3 Pa. The working pressure is adjusted to 3.0 Pa by filling the chamber with argon gas. The gas flow rate of pure Ar is fixed at 80 SCCM (standard cubic centimeter per minute). After 10 minutes, pre-sputtered CuS blocking layers on FTO substrates are obtained at 120 W for 30 min.32


2.1.3 Deposition of ZnO blocking layers. 
The ZnO blocking layer is deposited by the same method as the CuS blocking layers.

2.2 Fabrication of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films on FTO substrates
The Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films are fabricated on FTO substrates using a template assisted method followed by our previous work.22 The soft templates of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanoneedle films directly grow on the pre-treated FTO substrates by placing them in an aqueous solution containing 6.25% urea and 0.15 M cobalt chloride hexahydrate at 90 °C for 3 h. After the chemical bath deposition (CBD), the FTO substrates with the pink soft templates are transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing a 0.01 M Na2S aqueous solution for a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, black Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films are successfully formed on the FTO substrates.
2.3 Fabrication of Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures
The obtained Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films are further deposited using CuS seeds through the same RF sputtering process as for the deposition of CuS blocking layers to fabricate the 3D Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structure, and a hydrothermal post-treatment is applied. The CuS seeded Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films are placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 60 mL deionized water with 0.01 M Cu(NO3)2 and 0.05 M thiourea. And the autoclave is maintained at 150 °C for 1–10 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the black films grown on FTO substrates are taken out, rinsed with deionized water and dried under vacuum. Finally, the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structure is obtained.
2.4 Assembly of CdS/CdSe/ZnS quantum dot-sensitised solar cells
The CdS/CdSe/ZnS quantum dot-sensitised solar cells (QDSCs) are assembled following our previous work.20,33 TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) are used as the photoanode material. The TiO2 paste is prepared by adding 0.5 g P25 powder and 0.5 g polyethylene glycol (PEG, mole weight = 20000) to 1 mL DI water and a 2 mL ethanol mixed solution, and magnetic stirring is performed for 3 h. The TiO2-coated photoanode with a thickness of about 20 μm is prepared using the doctor blade method, and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air to remove the organic substances. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2-coated photoanode is immersed in a 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by another calcination at 450 °C for 30 min.
The CdS and CdSe QDs are deposited on the TiO2-coated photoanode by a facile chemical bath deposition (CBD).34 First, the TiO2 films are immersed into a solution containing 20 mM CdCl2, 140 mM thiourea, 66 mM NH4Cl, and 230 mM ammonia for 80 min. After being rinsed with DI water and dried in air, the TiO2/CdS films are obtained. Secondly, for the deposition of CdSe QDs, the Cd(NO3)2 solution is used as a Cd source and the Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution is used as a Se source, which is prepared by dissolving 0.1 M Se powder into a 0.18 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution at 70 °C for about 7 h to ensure that the black Se powder completely reacted. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution is filtered to remove the unreacted Se powder. It is worth noting that trisodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate (Na3NTA) which acts as a chelating agent was essential to the CBD progress. The as-prepared TiO2/CdS films are then soaked into a mixture of a Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution and a 0.08 M Cd(NO3)2 (containing 0.16 M Na3NTA) solution with a volume ratio of 1:1 for 30 h. The whole CBD process is performed at 10 °C in a refrigerator in the dark. Finally, the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is used to deposit the ZnS passive layer. The TiO2/CdS/CdSe films are alternately dipped into 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solution twice for 2 min for each dipping cycle.
CdS/CdSe/ZnS coated TiO2 films with an active area of about 0.14 cm2 are assembled together with the above-prepared counter electrodes by applying a 60 μm thick hot-malt sealed film as the spacer (SX 1170-25; Solaromix Co.). The polysulfide electrolyte used in this work consists of DI water and methanol with a volume ratio of 7:3 containing 0.5 M Na2S, 0.125 M S and 0.2 M KCl. The electrolyte is injected between two electrodes and driven by the capillary force through the hole on the hot-melt sealed film. In contrast, the traditional Pt, 1D Co9S8 nanoneedle and 2D CuS nanosheet CEs are also prepared on FTO substrates. To obtain Pt CEs, a 5 mM H2PtCl6 aqueous solution is drop cast onto the bare FTO substrates and annealed at 400 °C for 20 min. The CuS CEs are fabricated according to our previous work.32 Breifly, FTO substrates coated with CuS seed layers, which are deposited using the RF sputtering method at 120 W for 30 min, are placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 60 mL deionized water with 0.01 M Cu(NO3)2 and 0.05 M thiourea for a hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 18 h.
2.5 Characterization
The morphologies and lattice structures of all samples are observed via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM OXFORD ZEISS SIGMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The surface roughness of the bare and diverse blocking layer coated FTO substrates is tested via atomic force microscopy (AFM Bruker MultiMode 8 scanning probe microscopy). The phase identification is performed via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X'pert PRO) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI Quantum-2000 XPS, monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV)). The J–V curves of the QDSCs are measured under AM 1.5G simulated standard solar light (Oriel 300 W Xe lamp and Newport AM-1.5G filter). CV measurements are carried out by a CHI600E electrochemical workstation in a three electrode system with the saturated calomel (SCE) electrode as the reference electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and the as-prepared samples as the working electrodes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. For QDSCs, the polysulfide electrolyte containing DI water (70 mL) and methanol (30 mL) with Na2S (0.5 M), S (0.125 M) and KCl (0.2 M) is used in CV analysis. The EIS and Tafel tests are both performed on the symmetric cells by the CHI600E electrochemical workstation using the same polysulfide electrolyte as in the CV test. The frequency of the EIS test ranges from 10−1 to 105 Hz. The scan rate of Tafel analysis was 5 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the complete growth of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchically structured films on FTO substrates experiences multiple processes. Typically, the bare FTO substrates are first deposited with TiO2 blocking layers, followed by the direct growth of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O (CoT) nanoneedle films via chemical bath deposition (CBD), which serve as soft templates for the conversion of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle arrays.22 Subsequently, CuS seed layers are sputtered onto the surface of the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films to assist the final growth of CuS nanosheet branches, consequently achieving the successful construction of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures on FTO substrates. Among these growth steps, the first deposition of TiO2 blocking layers is especially important for the next in situ growth of the CoT films on FTO substrates. Thus, the selection and the effect of the blocking layers need to be further studied.

Fig. 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of different blocking layers deposited on FTO substrates, the subsequently grown CoT soft templates and the final products of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, almost no film remains on the FTO substrates without any blocking layers, mainly due to the quite weak binding force between FTO and the required films. However, with a TiCl4 pre-treatment to form a thin TiO2 blocking layer on the FTO substrates (Fig. 2d), pink CoT nanoneedle films could grow tightly on the FTO substrates (Fig. 2e), which are further converted into black Co9S8 films (Fig. 2f). To investigate the effect of different blocking layers, CuS and ZnO thin films are also deposited on FTO substrates to replace the TiO2 blocking layer using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering method. As shown in Fig. 2g–i, similar pink CoT nanoneedle templates and black Co9S8 films are also observed on the FTO substrates deposited with the CuS blocking layer. The same result is found for the ZnO blocking layer (Fig. 2j–l). It is indicated that the surface of the treated FTO substrates (Fig. 2d, g and j) becomes rougher rather than that of the bare FTO substrates (Fig. 2a). Therefore, it is proposed that the blocking layers may provide sufficient sites for crystal growth and then serve as bridges to strengthen the binding force between the target films and FTO substrates.

The insets in (d–l) are the corresponding optical photographs of the samples. 
To further verify the above conjecture, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is carried out. Fig. 3 shows the surface AFM morphologies of the four types of FTO substrates. It is obvious that the particle size on the surface of bare FTO is only about 1 nm, which is much smaller as compared to TiO2 (120 nm), CuS (70 nm), and ZnO (70 nm), suggesting the coarser surface of the treated FTO substrates. Moreover, the surface root-mean-square roughness (Ra) of each substrate is also calculated using the NanoScope Analysis software. The Ra value of bare FTO is 0.157 nm, which is extremely small in contrast with the TiO2 (22.4 nm), CuS (14.6 nm), and ZnO (13.1 nm) deposited FTO substrates, in good agreement with the above conjecture again. Besides, it is considered that the surface hydrophilic property may be another factor for the crystal growth, and then contact angle analysis is performed as well. The corresponding results (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicate that the TiO2 coating largely increases the substrate hydrophilicity while the CuS or ZnO deposition leads to the decreased hydrophilicity of the resultant FTO substrates. Then, it is considered that the surface hydrophilic property of the substrates likely has little influence on the firm growth of CoT nanoneedle films on FTO substrates. Moreover, the type of blocking layer rarely affects the morphologies of CoT and Co9S8 films (Fig. 2e, f, h, i, k and l). Thus, the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle films with a length of approximately 3 μm and an average diameter of approximately 100 nm based on the TiO2 blocking layer are chosen for the subsequent synthesis of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures.

Subsequently, CuS nanosheets are planted onto the walls of the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles via a second seed-assisted hydrothermal process (see Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the resultant Co9S8–CuS sample presents a coralloid hierarchical structure which is primarily built by numerous nanosheets with a thickness of 10–20 nm and a diameter of 200–300 nm. It is proposed that in this hierarchical structure, the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles act as the trunk with branched CuS nanosheets interwoven on their surface. Then, the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm this hypothesis. Fig. 4d shows that such a hierarchical structure consists of a hollow nanoneedle decorated with many overlapped nanosheets. Moreover, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 4e) demonstrates significantly different lattice fringes in the hierarchical structure. The lattice spacing of 0.568 nm is associated with cubic Co9S8,35 while the lattice spacing of 0.303 nm could be assigned to the (102) planes of hexagonal CuS,36 implying the coexistence of Co9S8 and CuS phases. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4f) exhibits diffraction rings with bright and dark diffraction spots, implying that the Co9S8–CuS samples are polycrystalline, owing to the overlapping of CuS and Co9S8 crystals. Meanwhile, the corresponding EDS measurement (Fig. 4g–i) also reveals that Co, Cu, and S elements distribute uniformly in the Co9S8–CuS sample.

To identify the phase structure of the samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is applied. In Fig. 5a, the XRD diffraction peaks of Co9S8 films match well with cubic Co9S8 (JCPDS No. 19-0364). The XRD pattern of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS films is presented in Fig. 5b, and the peaks at 2θ = 29.4°, 32.2°, 33.9°, 48.4° and 59.5° are indexed to the (102), (103), (006), (110), and (116) lattice planes of hexagonal CuS (JCPDS No. 06-0464), respectively. Meanwhile, other peaks at 2θ = 15.5°, 16.8°, 28.3°, 42.2°, 46.6° and 54.9° are indexed to the (111), (200), (311), (422), (511) and (531) lattice planes of cubic Co9S8. These results again suggest the coexistence of cubic Co9S8 and hexagonal CuS in the Co9S8–CuS sample, in good agreement with the TEM result.

To further study the composition and valence states of all elements in the Co9S8–CuS sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed as well. Fig. 5c shows a survey XPS spectrum of the Co9S8–CuS sample in the range of 0–1200 eV. The peaks at 162.6, 781 and 931.3 eV correspond to S 2p, Co 2p and Cu 2p, respectively, indicating the coexistence of S, Co and Cu elements in the Co9S8–CuS sample.37 The peaks of C 1s and O 1s are due to the exposure of the samples to air. By using a Gaussian fitting method, the Co 2p, Cu 2p, and S 2p spectra are fitted with two spin–orbit doublets. As depicted in Fig. 5d, a mixture of valence states of Co+ (2p3/2 777.5 eV, 2p1/2 792.7 eV), Co2+ (2p3/2 781.0 eV, 2p1/2 797.2 eV), and Co3+ (2p3/2 784.3 eV, 2p1/2 802.6 eV) leads to an average valence state of Co1.78+ in Co9S8.38 The high resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p is shown in Fig. 5e, and the energy difference between Cu 2p3/2 (931.3 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (951.0 eV) is 19.7 eV, indicating pure Cu2+ of CuS.39Fig. 5f displays the high resolution XPS spectrum of S 2p, and the binding energies at 162.0 eV and 163.1 eV are assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.20
To further understand the growth process and mechanism in this work, CuS nanosheets are grown onto Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles using a similar hydrothermal method but without the pre-deposited CuS seeds (denoted as Co9S8–CuS-bs). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), Co9S8–CuS-bs has irregular and sparse CuS nanosheets (Fig. S2c, ESI†) as compared to the well-defined coralloid 3D hierarchical structure (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Thus, it is demonstrated that the sputtered CuS seeds facilitate the fast and full growth of CuS nanosheets on the surface of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles. Furthermore, time-dependent evolution study and control experiments are carried out as well (Fig. S3, ESI†). When Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles pre-deposited with CuS seeds are hydrothermally treated at 150 °C for 1 h (Fig. S3a, ESI†), a few CuS nanosheets emerge on the walls of the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles. However, as the time increases to 2 h (Fig. S3b, ESI†), a great number of thin CuS nanosheets uniformly distribute on the surface of the Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles to constitute the novel coralloid 3D hierarchical structure. Further prolonging the reaction times to 4 h (Fig. S3c, ESI†), 6 h (Fig. S3d, ESI†), 8 h (Fig. S3e, ESI†), and 10 h (Fig. S3f, ESI†), respectively, CuS nanosheets become thicker and thicker, and finally stack together, but they still retain the coralloid 3D hierarchical features. As the hydrothermal time increases, the thickness of CuS nanosheets increases from ∼15 nm (2 h) to ∼100 nm (10 h). Notably, the above mentioned structure growth strategy is also applicable for the fabrication of hierarchical Co9S8–CuS films at other conductive substrates, such as flexible carbon cloth (CC), Ti mesh, and Ni foam substrates (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is considered that the in situ hierarchical structure construction route in this work has high universality for various potential applications.

According to the above experimental results, the growth process of the coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structure can be generally elucidated as follows. First, the pre-deposition of blocking layers promotes the effective in situ growth of CoT soft templates on FTO substrates. Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles are obtained through the reaction between CoT and Na2S using a sacrificial template method. This process can be explained by the Kirkendall effect, in which S2− ions are dispersed from Na2S to react with cobalt ions in CoT to form hollow Co9S8 nanoneedles, which keep the same nanoneedle structure as templates but become hollow mainly owing to the faster outward diffusion of cobalt ions as compared to the inward diffusion of S2− ions.22 As to the hierarchical structure, it is proposed that CuS nanosheets grow on the walls of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles through the heterogeneous nucleation process. Typically, the pre-sputtered CuS seeds on the walls of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles provide nucleation sites for the latter hydrothermal reaction. Aqueous Cu(NO3)2 serves as the Cu source to offer Cu2+ ions, and S2− ions are released slowly by thiourea to combine with Cu2+ ions to form CuS nanosheets.
Subsequently, to investigate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples, the coralloid Co9S8–CuS electrodes prepared with different hydrothermal reaction times are employed as CEs for CdS/CdSe QDSCs. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It is revealed that the Co9S8–CuS electrode prepared for 4 h exhibits the highest short-current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), contributing to the optimal PCE value of 4.50%. Therefore, the optimized sample is chosen to compare with the conventional Pt film, 1D Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles (Fig. 2f), and 2D CuS nanosheets (Fig. S5, ESI†) prepared on FTO substrates.

Fig. 7a presents J–V curves of QDSCs based on the Pt, Co9S8, CuS and Co9S8–CuS CEs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that the values of JSC and fill factor (FF) of the Pt-based QDSCs are quite low (JSC: 12.70 mA cm−2, FF: 0.29), leading to a poor PCE value of 1.84%. In contrast, Co9S8 and CuS CEs show higher JSC values of 15.26 mA cm−2 and 16.41 mA cm−2, VOC values of 0.47 V and 0.51 V, and FF values of 0.45 and 0.46, contributing to considerable PCE values of 3.25% and 3.83%, respectively. Remarkably, the novel coralloid Co9S8–CuS CE exhibits the highest PCE value of 4.50% due to its highest JSC value of 19.75 mA cm−2. It is supposed that the appropriate roughness factor (Rf), porosity, and macropore size (M-size) of the hierarchical structure lead to faster carrier transport, contributing to the higher current density.40,41

Moreover, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis is applied to investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the Pt, Co9S8, CuS and Co9S8–CuS CEs in the polysulfide electrolyte, and the corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. 7b. In theory, the potential range from negative to positive represents the oxidation process with oxidation peaks. To the contrary, the inverse potential range from positive to negative reflects the reduction process with reduction peaks. The reaction process of the three-electrode system in the polysulfide electrolyte here can be illustrated as follows.42 Sn2− + e− → nS2−(1) nS2− − e− → Sn2−(2)
The reductive activities for CEs in QDSCs are more significant than the oxidizability. As shown in Fig. 7b, the negative peak current densities of the Co9S8, CuS and Co9S8–CuS CEs are much higher than those of Pt CEs, indicating their stronger abilities to reduce Sn2−.21 Moreover, the 3D Co9S8–CuS CE exhibits the highest reduction peak current density, suggesting the best reduction properties for the reduction of Sn2− ions, and then matching well with the J–V results. Besides, a continuous CV test was performed to investigate the stability of the Co9S8–CuS CE. Meanwhile, the Co9S8 and CuS CEs are also tested as references (Fig. 7c–e). After 500 cycles, a ∼20% current drop is observed for the 3D Co9S8–CuS CE (Fig. 7e), indicating its superior stability in the polysulfide electrolyte as compared to the 1D Co9S8 CE with a ∼30% current drop (Fig. 7d) and the 2D CuS CE with an ∼80% current drop (Fig. 7c).
Furthermore, EIS experiments are carried out using symmetric cells organized by the Pt/Pt, Co9S8/Co9S8, CuS/CuS and Co9S8–CuS/Co9S8–CuS CEs to study the electron transport behaviour at the interfaces between CEs and the polysulfide electrolyte. The corresponding Nyquist plots in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz are shown in Fig. 7f. All the Nyquist plots are fitted with the inset equivalent circuit and the results are listed in Table 1. The equivalent circuit contains a series resistance (Rs) at the high frequency intercepting on the real axis, and one semicircle which represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) with a constant phase angle element (CPE).20 The Rct value of the Pt electrode is largest (1762 Ω), implying its poor conductivity and inefficient charge transfer ability in the polysulfide electrolyte. However, the 1D Co9S8 and 2D CuS CEs show lower Rct values of 12.27 Ω and 6.23 Ω, respectively, revealing their preferable electrocatalytic response in the polysulfide electrolyte. Moreover, a minimum Rct value (3.34 Ω) of the 3D Co9S8–CuS CE suggests its best activity to electrocatalytically reduce Sn2−, contributing to a highest PCE value.
Besides, the Tafel polarization measurement is conducted to study the charge transfer kinetics using the same symmetric cells in EIS analysis. Tafel polarization profiles reflect the relationship between the function of the logarithmic current density (logJ) and voltage (V). Generally, the intercept of the approximately linear region of the anodic and cathodic branches represents the exchange current density (J0).43 A largest slope associated with a highest J0 value can be observed for the 3D Co9S8–CuS CE compared to the Pt, 1D Co9S8 and 2D CuS CEs (Fig. 7g). J0 can also be calculated using the following equation.43 (3)in which R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, n is the number of electrons anticipated in the redox reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.43 It is found that J0 is inversely proportional to Rct. Thus, the largest slope of the 3D Co9S8–CuS CE corresponds to the smallest Rct value with the best electrocatalytic activity, agreeing well with the EIS results. Moreover, the limited current density (Jlim) as noted in Fig. 7g, which reflects the diffusion velocity of the ionic carrier in the polysulfide electrolyte and the electrocatalytic activity of the CE materials, can be calculated from the following equation. (4)where c is the concentration of polysulfide, l is the spacer thickness and D is the diffusion coefficient. The 3D Co9S8–CuS CE exhibits the highest Jlim value (Fig. 7g), relating to the largest D value with enhanced reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte. Herein, all the electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the coralloid Co9S8–CuS electrode possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity in the Sn2− reduction, which is significantly due to the 3D hierarchical structure with a large surface area as the reaction active site and a sufficient space for electrolyte diffusion, as well as the heterojunctions between Co9S8 and CuS for effective charge transport.
4. Conclusion
In summary, coralloid Co9S8–CuS hierarchical structures composed of Co9S8 hollow nanoneedles decorated with CuS nanosheets are rationally designed and fabricated via a multi-step route. The growth process and mechanism are carefully studied. The heterostructured Co9S8–CuS films are further applied as CEs for QDSCs with an optimum PCE of 4.50%, showing enhancements of 38% and 17% as compared to the 1D Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle and 2D CuS nanosheet CEs, respectively. It is suggested that the incorporation of Co9S8 and CuS is beneficial for their electrocatalytic activity as well as stability in the electrochemical cycling tests. This is primarily due to the enhanced charge transport and increased active reaction sites from the heterojunctions and heterostructures of the hybrid metal sulfides. Importantly, this fabrication strategy can be applied to grow the coralloid Co9S8–CuS films on flexible substrates, such as carbon cloth, Ti mesh, and Ni foam. It may be available to realize various combinations of different metal sulfides, which will inherit individual merits from each single component and broaden their promising applications in many fields.
