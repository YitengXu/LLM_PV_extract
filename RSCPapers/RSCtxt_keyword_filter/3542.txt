    , Accepted 8th September 2021First published on 27th September 2021AbstractRecently, research on the use of additives in photoactive layers to improve the efficiency of solar cells has continued to be conducted. Among them, carbon-based additives serve to increase a device's efficiency by simply and effectively improving the carrier movement. In this work, inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs) are fabricated based on a blend of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM bulk heterojunction as photoactive materials using mixed additives of 4Cl-carbon-based contorted hexabenzocoronene (4Cl-cHBC). The 4Cl-cHBC additives, a kind of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, added to bulk heterojunction in the iPSC devices, provide a cocrystal modifier and effective charge separation to enhance device performance. The reason for this efficiency improvement is that cocrystal is formed due to a combination between 4Cl-cHBC and the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk heterojunction, which reduces bimolecular recombination in the device and significantly increases short-circuit current and fill factor. The RS and RSh values of iPSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives decreased from 7.0 Ω cm2 to 4.0 Ω cm2, and increased from 813 Ω cm2 to 1226 Ω cm2, respectively. The calculated average carrier lifetimes at 500 nm for PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM with 4Cl-cHBC additives are 4.46 ps and 3.06 ps, respectively. The carrier lifetimes show that the charge separation of PTB7-Th:PC71BM with 4Cl-cHBC additives is more than 45% faster. As a result, the iPSCs based on the blend of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM with 4Cl-cHBC additives showed maximum power conversion efficiencies of 9.46 and 8.62%, which were 20.6 and 19.95% higher than those of the reference, respectively.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on composites of blends of donor and acceptor materials have attracted attention due to their potential as renewable, low-cost, flexible, and light-weight devices, with the possibility for large-scale fabrication.1–9 In general, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs utilizing a conjugated polymer as donor and fullerene derivative as acceptor play a leading role in the implementation of high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the BHJ structure has a limitation in increasing the solar conversion efficiency.2–8 Recently, there has been much research reporting an increase in efficiency through structural change by adding various kinds of additives to the BHJ structures.4,10–17 These additives are largely divided into solvent additives and solid additives (including graphene quantum dots (QDs) and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials). The solvent additives help improve fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc) by improving the morphology between substances, while the solid additives remain in the active layer, increasing the efficiency of electron transport and hole transport, and increasing the light absorption area. In recent years, solid additives have been actively researched to increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by mixing various QDs, TMDs, and organic materials. For example, Tzounis et al. used Ag and Au nanoparticles as additives to increase PCE through plasmonics in PSCs.18,19 Liu et al. added black phosphorus QDs to increase the absorption capacity, increasing the PCE by 8.3%.12 Sygletou et al. increased the PCE from 5.6% to 6.3% using TMDs WS2-Au as additives in PCDTBT:PC71BM.15 Sung et al. studied graphene QD-enhanced polymer and fullerene PSCs.14 Ahn and Kang et al. studied the conductivity and performance of solar cells through a structural combination of HBC species and PCBM species. The structural combination of HBC species and PCBM is called a cocrystal. HBC plays a role in improving electrical conductivity by self-combining with PCBM to form a cocrystal. The structure was confirmed by GIXD and TEM diffraction analysis. A solar cell fabricated with the electron-rich HBC and the PCBM cocrystal structure recorded a PCE of >3%.1,2,8 However, there have been very few studies on the application of HBC in the photoactive layer of PSCs.
In this paper, we report a novel approach to enhance photovoltaic performance using mixed additives of 4Cl carbon-based contorted HBC (4Cl-cHBC) in PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM BHJ photoactive layers. The additives of the 4Cl-cHBC nanocarbon play the multifunctional role of cocrystal modifier and effective charge separator. In addition, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of 4Cl-cHBC involving chemical, optical, and electrical properties. To demonstrate the roles of 4Cl-cHBC, the optical, structural and electrical properties were studied along with inverted PSCs (iPSCs) with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives in PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM photoactive materials. The photovoltaic performance and behavior of the fabricated iPSCs with the 4Cl-cHBC additive were investigated using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, time-resolved PL (TRPL), finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling, I–V measurements, and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) under an AM 1.5G illumination.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials for fabrication of photovoltaic devices
4Cl-cHBC was synthesized following a procedure reported previously and then purified by column chromatography using chloroform as an eluent.20 [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, purity > 99%, Nano-C), poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th, Mw = 180 kDa, One Meterial), and polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) solution (Mw = 110 kDa, 37 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) were used in this study.
2.2. Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
The iPSC devices were fabricated on 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with ethanol, acetone and 2-propanol. The ITO-coated glass was treated with O2 plasma for 40 s. PEIE solution was spin-coated with 6 nm thickness and the PEIE film was baked at 110 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Blends of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:4Cl-cHBC solutions with controlled ratios were spin-coated onto the PEIE layer to form a 120 nm thick active layer. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were sequentially deposited on the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 5 × 10−7 Torr, which defines an active area of 0.0464 cm2. For the electron-only device, only the MoO3/Ag electrode was changed to Lif (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm).
2.3. Characterization of photovoltaic structure and photovoltaic devices
The un-encapsulated iPSC devices were tested under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2400 SMU and an Oriel xenon lamp (450 W) with an AM 1.5G filter. A mask was used to define the device illumination area of 0.0464 cm2 to minimize photocurrent generation from the edge of the electrodes. The iPSC devices were then tested in air under an AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator), which was calibrated with the International System of Units (SI) (SRC-1000-TC-KG5-N, VLSI Standards, Inc.) for accurate measurement. The light-dependent open-circuit voltage (Voc) and Jsc were obtained by adjusting the power source of the solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an Oriel IQE-200 (NewPort), a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR8570 low-noise current amplifier. In order to confirm the surface morphology, AFM measurements were carried out in air using an NX-10 (Park systems). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM films with/without 4Cl-cHBC were measured using a UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The modeling of the absorption of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film with 4Cl-cHBC was confirmed by the FDTD method. The PL measurements were carried out using a Xe lamp as the excitation source at room temperature. The PL lifetimes of the carriers were carefully measured by time-correlated single-photon counting experiments at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and a repetition rate of 80 MHz.
3. Results and discussion
The 4Cl-cHBC nanocarbon was synthesized by a protocol known for contorted hexabenzocoronene derivatives and purified by column chromatography.20 The final product of gray-colored 4Cl-cHBC showed a concave molecular structure with a distorted pentaxene core, resulting in a unique crystal structure with 4Cl atoms each attached to a carbon atom of the edge (Fig. 1a). The structural and optical properties of the synthesized 4Cl-cHBC nanocarbon were analyzed using various techniques. The 4Cl-cHBC materials of the contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were placed on a Cu grid using a drop method and observed using HRTEM in order to confirm the shape of the 4Cl-cHBC materials in detail (Fig. 1b). The TEM image shows that 4Cl-cHBC exists in the form of a bundle, and the size was confirmed to be less than approximately 5 nm. The 4Cl-cHBC material exists in a small size in the form of nanocarbons.

To understand the optical properties of the 4Cl-cHBC nanocarbon, the absorption spectrum and the PL spectrum of the 4Cl-cHBC were obtained by a UV–vis spectrophotometer and PL measurements as can be seen in Fig. 1c and d. It can be seen from the absorption spectrum of 4Cl-cHBC in Fig. 1c that the nanomaterial has a wide absorption wavelength range from visible light to ultraviolet light.21,22 The peaks in the identified absorption range have various wavelengths of 375, 400, 450, 475, 550 and 570 nm (inset of Fig. 1c). Through the PL spectrum of the 4Cl-cHBC nanocarbon in Fig. 1d, it can be seen that the entire range of visible light is emitted. Peaks of various emission wavelengths of 495, 530, 580 and 680 nm were identified, and the dominant peak among them was that at 495 nm.
A schematic illustration of the iPSC with the ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:4Cl-cHBC/MoO3/Ag structures based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ containing 4Cl-cHBC as additive material is shown in Fig. 2a. The detailed information of device fabrication is provided in the Experiment section. In order to confirm the photovoltaic properties using 4Cl-cHBC as a solid additive in BHJs, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM BHJ photoactive materials as representative donor–acceptor polymers with and without 4Cl-cHBC in the iPSC devices were investigated for their photovoltaic performance as can be seen in Fig. 2b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). It was found that the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ device without the 4Cl-cHBC additive exhibited the lowest PCE of 8.06% with Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 15.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.5%. While the devices with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 1.25, 2, and 2.5 wt% show an improved photovoltaic performance with PCE of 9.37% (Voc = 0.79 V, Jsc = 16.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.0%), 9.46% (Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 16.4 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.9%), and 9.06% (Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 16.3 mA cm−2, and FF = 68.9%), respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 2b. The BHJ device with 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt% embedded in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive layer exhibits the best performance and a maximum PCE of 9.46% is obtained with Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 16.4 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.9%. Therefore, the maximum PCE (PCEmax) in iPSCs was 20.6% higher than that of the device without 4Cl-cHBC. In addition, the corresponding photovoltaic performances of the devices with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives are summarized in Table 1.

When comparing the samples containing 4Cl-cHBC, it can be seen that the sample with 4Cl-cHBC at 2 wt% is an optimized sample. This is because less 4Cl-cHBC does not give enough of an effect, and more 4Cl-cHBC interferes with the binding of PTB7-Th to PC71BM. Similarly, there is an increase in efficiency due to the 4Cl-cHBC additive in the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ device using the same acceptor material and different donor material. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the J–V characteristic curves of the iPSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ blend with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additive. In addition, the corresponding photovoltaic performances of the devices with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additive are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
The devices of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ without 4Cl-cHBC exhibit photovoltaic performance with PCE of 7.17% (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 14.8 mA cm−2, and FF = 69.8%). While the devices of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2.5, 5, and 10 wt% exhibit an improved photovoltaic performance with PCE of 8.67% (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 15.3 mA cm−2, and FF = 75.5%), 8.62% (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 15.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.2%), and 8.34% (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 14.9 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.5%), respectively. As a result, the iPSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ blended with 4Cl-cHBC as the additive material showed PCEmax of 8.62%, which was 19.95% higher than that of the reference.
To further examine the device performance, we measured EQE to quantify the photocurrent generation as a function of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2c. An overall increase in EQE is observed and the maximum EQE is obtained for the device with 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt%. The extent of the increase in the Jsc value as calculated from the EQE is in agreement with that shown by the J–V characteristics of the devices with the 4Cl-cHBC additives. The improvement of the EQE can be supposed as being due to the increase in the light absorption and the carrier movement by the 4Cl-cHBC additives contained in the heterojunction layer.
To confirm the combination of 4Cl-cHBC and PC71BM, the film morphologies of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ containing the 4Cl-cHBC additives were measured using AFM. Fig. 3a and b show 30 × 30 μm2 AFM topography images with color contrast of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM with 4Cl-cHBC at 2 wt% spin-coated onto the PEIE/ITO/glass substrate. The root mean square (RMS) value of the film without 4Cl-cHBC was 1.315 and that of the film with 4Cl-cHBC at 2 wt% increased to 1.682. It was confirmed that the RMS value slightly increased with the inclusion of the 4Cl-cHBC additive in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ due to the increased surface roughness of the film resulting from the combination with 4Cl-cHBC in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ.
In order to confirm the light absorption effect of the 4Cl-cHBC additives added to the BHJ structure, the absorbance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ film with and without 4Cl-cHBC was measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer, as can be seen in Fig. 3c. There is no significant difference at wavelengths between 300 and 800 nm. To prove this, optical simulations were performed using an FDTD solution.3Fig. 3d shows the simulated optical absorption spectra of the BHJ devices with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives. The two spectra are nearly identical and agree well with the experimental results in Fig. 3c. Furthermore, Fig. 3e and f additionally show the simulated absorption profiles of the BHJ devices without and with 4Cl-cHBC, respectively, at a wavelength of 480 nm. They also do not show a big difference, and therefore the 4Cl-cHBC additives do not significantly affect the light absorption. For the simulations, the broadband plane wave source (300–800 nm) was set to be normally incident at the solar cells, and a periodic boundary condition and a perfect matched layer boundary condition were used for the lateral and vertical interfaces, respectively. The optical absorption was calculated using Pabs = 0.5ε0ε′ω|E|2, where ε0 and ε′ are the permittivity of free space and that of the imaginary part of each layer, respectively, ω is the free space frequency, and E is the electric field. The iPSC structures used for the simulations were Ag/MoO3/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PEIE/ITO/glass and Ag/MoO3/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:4Cl-cHBC/PEIE/ITO/glass.23,24 Optical constants were taken from the literature or obtained using an ellipsometer (Woollam M2000D).
The mechanism of increasing photovoltaic performance efficiency using PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ photoactive materials and the 4Cl-cHBC additive composite structures was explained by J–V curve fitting, bimolecular recombination, and TRPL measurement.
The first factor for increasing photovoltaic performance efficiency is an improvement of FF that can be seen by the J–V curve fitting. The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSh) calculated from the inverse slopes in the J–V curves obtained from the iPSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive materials with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives can be seen in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The RS and RSh values of iPSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive materials with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives decreased from 7.0 Ω cm2 to 4.0 Ω cm2, and increased from 813 Ω cm2 to 1226 Ω cm2, respectively (Fig. 4a and b).25 The decreased RS and increased RSh from the contribution of the additives in the active layer led to the increase of the FF. These results mean that the 4Cl-cHBC:PC71BM cocrystal structure has low resistance.8

The second factor is the reduction in recombination caused by bonding of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive materials with the 4Cl-cHBC additives through the obtained EQE measurement and bimolecular recombination. The EQE was measured to analyze the improved photovoltaic performance of the iPSC devices. Fig. 2c shows that the EQE of iPCSs with 4Cl-cHBC was higher than that of the iPSCs without 4Cl-cHBC. This is because the combination between 4Cl-cHBC and PC71BM in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ leads to a pair of absorbed photons separated by charge carriers, and most of the photogenerated carriers are collected at the electrode without the effect of bimolecular recombination.
To understand the charge recombination behavior of devices with and without 4Cl-cHBC, we measured Voc as a function of light intensity (Plight) and Jsc as a function of Plight. The charge carriers recombine inside the active layer and the recombination mechanism can be studied by analyzing the following relation:26–30 (1)where n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, q is the absolute value of electron charge and T is the temperature. The relevant recombination mechanism can be investigated by determining the slope of the Voc–Plight curve. As the ideality factor (n) approaches 1, it follows that the relevant mechanism is bimolecular recombination. Also, it can be seen that when the ideality factor (n) approaches 2, it depends on the related mechanism of trap-assisted recombination.

Fig. 5a shows plots of Voc as a function of Plight of iPSCs with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives. The n values of iPSCs with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives were obtained as 1.15 and 1.04, respectively. As a result, it can be seen that the relevant recombination mechanism is dominated by the bimolecular mechanism.31 Since bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism, according to the equation below, the closer S is to 1, the weaker is the degree of bimolecular recombination: Jsc ∝ (Plight)S(2)

Fig. 5b shows plots of Jsc as a function of Plight of iPSCs with and without 4Cl-cHBC. The S values of the two devices with and without 4Cl-cHBC are 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, showing that the degree of recombination decreased with the addition of 4Cl-cHBC. In addition, the electron carrier mobility of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ-based device with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives based on the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model is described in the following equation: (3)where JSCLC is the current density of the electron-only devices, V is the applied voltage, L stands for the thickness of the active layer, ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 C V−1m is the permittivity of free space, and εr is assumed as 3.5 as the relative dielectric constant of the active layer. The fitting plot of J–V characteristics by the SCLC model for the fabricated electron-only devices (ITO/PEIE/Active layer/Lif/Al) is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The calculated results show that the electron mobility significantly increased from 8.84 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after the addition of 4Cl-cHBC.32,33 This shows that the 4Cl-cHBC additives improve the carrier transport ability, resulting in reduced bimolecular recombination due to rapid electron transfer. Therefore, it was found that the electron transport of the device was improved and the PCE was increased.
The final factor is the carrier lifetime of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive material with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives. TRPL measurements were performed to understand the improved charge transport performance as a result of cocrystal formation between 4Cl-cHBC and PC71BM in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ with respect to the excited electron–hole recombination. As can be seen in Fig. 5c, the excitation light was applied at a wavelength of 400 nm and the peak at 500 nm was compared. The PL lifetime of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure containing 4Cl-cHBC at 2 wt% decreases compared to the reference PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure. For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ-based device with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives, the calculated average carrier lifetimes at 500 nm are 4.46 ns and 3.05 ns, respectively. The results of the carrier lifetime for structures mean that the charge dissociation of holes and electrons is increased in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structures with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt%, thereby improving the carrier movement. From the previously described data, it can be seen that there is a correlation between the carrier lifetime and the measured IPCE values as evidence of the efficiency improvement of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ-based device with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives (Fig. 2c and Table 3). As expected, direct photoexcitation of the 4Cl-cHBC additives adds to the photocurrent in the wavelength range of the UV–vis region. The EQE at a wavelength of about 500 nm exhibits a peak enhancement from 52% to 58.5% upon introduction of the ITO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:4Cl-cHBC (2 wt%)/MoO3/Ag structures. Accordingly, the iPSCs with 4Cl-cHBC between PTB7-Th:PC71BM exhibited a 12.5% enhancement in EQE. PL carrier lifetimes of the PC71BM:4Cl-cHBC (2 wt%) structure decrease significantly in comparison with those of the reference PTB7-Th:PC71BM structures. The calculated average carrier lifetimes at 500 nm for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM structures with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt% are 4.46 ps and 3.06 ps, respectively. As a result, the carrier lifetime of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt% was reduced by 31% compared to that of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure. In other words, it can be seen that the charge separation of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure with the 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt% is faster than that of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM structure by more than 45%.

As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the results for iPSCs with the 4Cl-cHBC additives match well the energy band diagram including ITO/PEIE, PC71BM, PTB7-Th, and MoO3. In the case of 4Cl-cHBC additives, since the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ contains a very small amount of the additives, 4Cl-cHBC is shown as located between PTB7-Th and PC71BM. The processes of exciton dissociation and the separated electron transport are synergistically promoted with the introduction of an appropriate amount of the 4Cl-cHBC additives. The movement path of the electrons, by referring to the energy band diagram, is described as follows. Under incident light, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer with 4Cl-cHBC additives can be easily transported to the PEIE/ITO cathode collecting electrode and MoO3/Ag anode collecting electrode, respectively.
4. Conclusions
In summary, iPSCs were prepared by adding 4Cl-cHBC additives to PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM BHJ structures. The 4Cl-cHBC additives play a multifunctional role as cocrystal modifier and electron transport layer for effective charge separation. The optical, structural and electrical properties were studied along with the iPSCs with and without the 4Cl-cHBC additives in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM BHJ as photoactive materials to confirm the roles of the 4Cl-cHBC additives. The mechanism and increase in the efficiency parameters such as Jsc, Voc, and FF of the photovoltaic devices using the 4Cl-cHBC additives were confirmed from analysis methods such as J–V curve fitting, bimolecular recombination, and TRPL measurement. The device with 4Cl-cHBC additives at 2 wt% has the highest photovoltaic efficiency performance, and shows improved carrier transport as a result of increasing charge dissociation between holes and electrons. Therefore, the iPSCs based on the BHJ of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM with 4Cl-cHBC additive material at 2 wt% exhibited maximum PCE of 9.46 and 8.62%, which were 20.6 and 19.95%, respectively, higher than those of the reference without the 4Cl-cHBC additives.
