    , Accepted 27th April 2016First published on 27th April 2016AbstractAlthough Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) has attracted attention as an alternative to CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) as an absorber material in solar cells, its low efficiency is a serious shortcoming preventing its commercialization. To realize a high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cell, improved grain crystallinity, inhibited secondary-phase formation, controlled defect generation, adequate Na content, and band gap grading are required in the absorber layer. Few studies have focused specifically on band gap grading. In this study, a method of using SeS2, a new potential chalcogenization source material, to control the S and Se contents in a CZTSSe absorber and its effects were investigated. Using an appropriate SeS2/Se weight ratio, band gap grading was realized within the depletion region. By increasing the value of VOC through band gap grading in the depletion region, a record VOC deficit of 0.576 V was achieved. Furthermore, the possibility of enhancing JSC through the formation of a type-inverted n-type phase at the absorber surface in response to an appropriate alignment of the conduction-band minimum energy level and the Fermi energy pinning level is discussed. By introducing the chalcogenization source material SeS2 during the annealing process, CZTSSe solar cells with a maximum efficiency of 12.3% were obtained.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy sources, including solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, solar thermal energy, and biomass conversion energy, must be developed to meet the challenges of climate change.1 Among these energy sources, PV energy, which has the potential to convert an infinite amount of sunlight into solar electricity, can be used in everyday life if a high energy density can be achieved at a low cost and with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Of the many inorganic PV materials that have been considered for use in low-cost PV devices,2 thin-film solar cells based on Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) and related materials have drawn significant interest in the context of PV technology because they use Earth-abundant elements and have useful band gap energies (Eg) of 1.0–1.5 eV and absorption coefficients exceeding 104 cm−1.3–5 However, compared with CdTe, which has a PCE of 21.5%, and CIGS, which has a PCE of 21.7%,6,7 CZTSSe, which has a PCE of 12.6%, must be further improved.6,8 To improve the efficiency of a CZTSSe solar cell, it is important to minimize current and voltage losses. To do so, the grain crystallinity must be improved;9,10 the formation of secondary phases must be suppressed;10–16 and the presence of defects,10,15–19 the Na content,20,21 and the band gap16,22–24 in the absorber layer must be controlled. If the band gap of the absorber increases near its back contact side, then carrier collection is improved by the additional drift field formed by the electrons and the current density (JSC) is improved by the inhibition of recombination at the back contact side.16,25–27 If the band gap increases from the center of the absorber to the absorber–buffer interface, then the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is improved by the locally increased band gap in the space-charge region.25–28 For this reason, high-efficiency CIGS devices have a graded band structure in the absorber layer.25–32 In a CIGS absorber layer, the band gap grading is typically produced by means of the compositional profile of the Ga/(In + Ga) ratio. In CZTSSe, the band gap varies with the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio from approximately 1.0 eV in Cu2ZnSnSe4 to 1.5 eV in Cu2ZnSnS4.22,23,33,34 In a few previous studies, CZTS precursors have been formed through a solution process followed by a 2-step annealing process in which selenization was performed after sulfurization.22 In addition, the band gap tuning of CZTS precursors can be performed by adjusting the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio during the CZTSSe nanocrystal formation stage23 or by applying both S and Se in the annealing process after precursor formation via sputtering.35 However, few studies have addressed band gap grading in CZTSSe absorber layers.22 In this study, we adopted a hybrid chalcogen chemical, selenium disulfide (SeS2), as an effective chalcogenization source material for creating high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells. This report presents the first demonstration of chalcogenization using SeS2 and reports a method of band gap grading in the depletion region.
2. Experimental section
The structure of the studied CZTSSe solar cell consisted of a soda lime glass (SLG) substrate, a 600 nm-thick Mo layer as a back contact layer, an approximately 1.8 μm-thick CZTSSe absorber layer deposited via sputtering and annealed with Se and SeS2, a 50 nm-thick CdS buffer layer deposited via chemical bath deposition, a 50 nm-thick intrinsic ZnO layer deposited via sputtering, a 300 nm-thick Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer deposited via sputtering that functioned as a transparent conducting oxide layer, and a 500 nm-thick Al collection grid deposited via thermal evaporation. The Mo layer was deposited on the SLG substrate via DC magnetron sputtering using a Mo target with a purity of 99.99%. The metal precursors for the CZTSSe absorber layer were deposited on the Mo layer using 99.99% pure Cu, Sn, and Zn sputtering targets with a stacking order of Cu (170 nm)/Sn (268 nm)/Zn (188 nm)/Mo. For the sulfo-selenization process, all samples were placed in a graphite box with a Se source and a SeS2 source. The annealing system was a semi-closed system; therefore, the Se and SeS2 sources remained in the graphite box after vaporization. To provide sufficient Se and SeS2 vapor and prevent severe decomposition of the CZTSSe films, the annealing processes were conducted in an Ar-filled rapid thermal processing (RTP) chamber at slightly above 1 atm. For thermal annealing, a 2-step annealing process was applied using chalcogenization sources with various SeS2/Se weight ratios. The sample was heated from room temperature to 300 °C over 1000 s and then maintained at 300 °C for 1500 s. Subsequently, it was heated from 300 °C to 510 °C over 1000 s and then maintained at 510 °C for 1100 s. SeS2 and Se were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification. The remaining layers in the device, as described above, were subsequently added using the aforementioned procedures.
The samples were characterized by means of a solar simulator, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry (STEM-EDS), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and measurements of the current–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the charge density (NCV). The current–voltage characteristics were measured under a simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) spectrum and an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) using a solar simulator (Newport Co., model 94022A). The EQE values were obtained using an SR 830 DSP lock-in amplifier system (McScience Co.). ICP emission spectrometry (Shimadzu Co., model ICPS-8100) and STEM-EDS (Bruker Co., model QUANTAX-200) measurements were performed to analyze the compositions of the films. To confirm the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio in the CZTSSe absorber, each sample was mechanically polished using a dimple grinder until the Mo back contact layer was exposed, and then, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed. The absorber layer was exposed as a surface of approximately 150 μm in length, and a depth-resolved Raman analysis based on the position yielded results throughout the depth of the absorber layer. The depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements were obtained using the 632.8 nm line of a He–Ne laser, the 514.5 nm line of an Ar+ laser, and the 325 nm line of a He–Cd laser as the excitation sources. The C–V characteristics (Keithley, model 4200-SCS) were measured using 50 mV and 100 kHz AC excitation with a DC bias from −4.5 V to 0 V.
3. Results and discussion
The characteristics of the CZTSSe solar cells are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The same precursor was deposited on all cells, and after the annealing process, the ICP emission spectroscopy measurements revealed the elemental compositions of the Cu-poor and Zn-rich samples to be [Cu]/([Zn] + [Sn]) = 0.706–0.709 and [Zn]/[Sn] = 1.350–1.369, respectively. During the annealing process, 30 g of Se and 0.1129 g of SeS2 (SeS2/Se = 0.38 wt%) were placed near sample cells CZTSSe01, CZTSSe02, and CZTSSe03; 30 g of Se and 0.0386 g of SeS2 (SeS2/Se = 0.13 wt%) were placed near cell CZTSSe04; and 30 g of Se and 0.2875 g of SeS2 (SeS2/Se = 0.63 wt%) were placed near cell CZTSSe05. Cells CZTSSe01, CZTSSe02, and CZTSSe03 exhibited similar characteristics, and cell CZTSSe02 demonstrated the highest efficiency (η) (12.3%). Compared with cell CZTSSe02, cell CZTSSe04 had a lower SeS2/Se weight ratio, a lower VOC and a rather high JSC, whereas cell CZTSSe05 had a higher SeS2/Se weight ratio, a higher VOC and a lower JSC (Fig. 1a). As shown by the EQE curves presented in Fig. 1b and the band gap graph in the inset of Fig. 1b, cell CZTSSe04, which had a low SeS2/Se weight ratio, showed a narrowing Eg of 1.055 eV and exhibited characteristics similar to those of CZTSe, whereas cell CZTSSe05, which had a high SeS2/Se weight ratio, showed a widening Eg of 1.358 eV and exhibited characteristics similar to those of CZTS.

To identify the cause of the variation in the band gap of the CZTSSe absorber layers as a function of the SeS2/Se weight ratio, the spatial distribution of the absorber composition was examined via STEM-EDS; the results are shown in Fig. 2. During the annealing process, in cell CZTSSe04, which had a relatively low SeS2/Se weight ratio of 0.13 wt%, a gradation in the absorber composition was formed such that the atomic percentage of S decreased from 8% to 1.2% from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to a depth of approximately 0.8 μm, and the atomic percentage of Se ranged from 50% to 56% (Fig. 2b). In cell CZTSSe05, which had a relatively high SeS2/Se weight ratio of 0.63 wt%, the atomic percentage of S was approximately constant at 22% from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to the inside of the absorber, and the atomic percentage of Se was approximately 30% (Fig. 2c). In cell CZTSSe02, which had a SeS2/Se weight ratio between those of cells CZTSSe04 and CZTSSe05, the atomic percentage of S decreased from 12% to 6% from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to a depth of approximately 0.2 μm and was approximately 4% in the bulk of the absorber (Fig. 2a); meanwhile, the atomic percentage of Se increased from 42% to 52% from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to a depth of approximately 0.2 μm and was approximately 52% in the bulk of the absorber. Therefore, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio can be adjusted by adding only a small amount of SeS2, indicating that this material is a very efficient source of S. These changes appear as variations in the [S]/([S] + [Se]) and [Se]/([S] + [Se]) ratios, as shown in Fig. 2d and e.

All cells have similar [Cu]/([Zn] + [Sn]) and [Zn]/[Sn] ratios, but the atomic percentages of S and Se differ. 
Depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy was performed to confirm the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of cell CZTSSe02 throughout the depth of the absorber layer. Fig. 3a shows a schematic diagram of the depth-resolved Raman scanning method. Fig. 3b shows the depth-resolved Raman results of cell CZTSSe02, which reveal clear CZTSSe peaks. Three types of lasers (632.8 nm, 514.5 nm, and 325 nm) were used in the depth-resolved Raman investigation to detect the secondary phases in all samples. However, no Raman peaks of the secondary phases were detected; thus, we can conclude that there was no detectable secondary phase formation in the absorber layer. The frequency and intensity of all Raman modes as well as the shape of the Raman spectrum depend on the composition in terms of S and Se. Therefore, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio could be measured quantitatively by analyzing the Raman internal intensity.36 The Raman peak at 196 cm−1 was broader and the peak intensity was weaker near the absorber surface than inside the absorber, as shown in Fig. 3c. This indicates that the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio increased from the absorber bulk to the CdS–CZTSSe interface. Fig. 3d shows the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratios of cells CZTSSe02, CZTSSe04, and CZTSSe05 in the direction from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to the inside of the absorber. In cell CZTSSe04, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio decreased from 0.15 at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 0.029 at a depth of approximately 0.8 μm. In cell CZTSSe05, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio ranged from 0.38 at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 0.43 in the center of the absorber. In cell CZTSSe02, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio decreased from 0.225 at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 0.11 at a depth of approximately 0.2 μm and was approximately 0.065 in the bulk of the absorber. The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of cell CZTSSe02, as calculated based on the Raman spectroscopy results presented in Fig. 3b, decreased from 0.206 at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 0.140 at a depth of approximately 0.2 μm and remained constant thereafter. This decrease in the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of cell CZTSSe02 from the CdS–CZTSSe interface to a depth of approximately 0.2 μm is consistent with the STEM-EDS results.
 Fig. 3  The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio in the CZTSSe absorber layer. (a) To measure the phase distribution throughout the depth of the absorber layer, cell CZTSSe02 was mechanically polished using a dimple grinder until the Mo back contact layer was exposed. (b) The depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy results of the absorber layer of CZTSSe02 in the depth direction. The depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a 1 mW, 532 nm laser. The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio was 0.18 at 0.10 μm from the CdS–CZTSSe interface in the depth direction and less than 0.14 below a depth of 0.20 μm, in which region it remained relatively constant. (c) A comparison of the Raman peaks from that at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to that at a depth of 0.35 μm reveals that the Raman peak was broader near the CdS–CZTSSe interface than inside the CZTSSe. This is because of an increasing S content. (d) The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratios of cells CZTSSe02 (red line), CZTSSe04 (black line), and CZTSSe05 (blue line). The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of CZTSSe02 was calculated based on the depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy results using the optical method described in ref. 36. The results obtained via STEM-EDS (solid red line) and Raman spectroscopy (dashed red line) for the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of cell CZTSSe02 indicate similar trends. 
Therefore, the device characteristics vary, resulting in a graded band gap, as the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of the CZTSSe absorber layer varies with the SeS2/Se weight ratio used during the annealing of the absorber precursor. In many previous studies, various approaches have been used to produce CZTSSe alloys for use as absorbers: only S has been used as the source,8,10,20,21,24 only Se has been used as the source,9,37,38 and both S and Se have been used together as sources,35 and sulfurization and selenization have been successively performed during the annealing process.22 However, exact control of the chalcogenization reaction is difficult because of the different thermal behaviors of S and Se. S is known to vaporize at a lower temperature than Se, and therefore, the incorporation of S into CZTSSe absorbers is dominant during thermal treatment for chalcogenization. Because of the highly reactive nature of S, suitable control of the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio is difficult. However, to prepare CZTSSe absorber layers with optimized band gaps, precise control of the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio is required. SeS2 is not a pure chemical compound but rather a mixture with an overall Se:S ratio of 1:2. This mixture consists of cyclic Se–S rings, SexS8−x, containing variable numbers of S and Se atoms.39 We found that SeS2 exhibits a stepwise thermal vaporization behavior (see Fig. S1†). The temperatures corresponding to 50% weight loss (T50) of S, Se, and SeS2 are 230 °C, 440 °C, and 330 °C, respectively. The SeS2 mixture has a thermal vaporization temperature that is between those of S and Se. If S and Se are used during the annealing of the precursor, then control of the reaction is not easy because of the large difference between the vaporization temperatures of these two materials; therefore, it might be preferable to use SeS2 and Se instead. To examine the thermal vaporization behavior of SeS2 in more detail, the changes in the vaporized species were investigated based on the mass spectra at a vaporizer temperature of 300 °C (see Fig. S2 and S5†). During the initial vaporization process, most of the pure elemental sulfur, Sx, is released from the SeS2 source by thermal heating. As the thermal heating process proceeds with the vaporizer temperature maintained at 300 °C, the SexS8−x are released successively, ending with the release of elemental selenium, Sex. Therefore, we expect that during the initial heating stage of the annealing process, the partial pressures of Sx and SexS8−x increase and Sx and SexS8−x are the dominant chalcogen sources, whereas once the annealing temperature is reached, the partial pressure of Sex increases and Sex is the dominant chalcogen source. Moreover, during the cooling stage that follows the annealing process, the partial pressures of Sx and SexS8−x again increase, offering the possibility of preparing CZTSSe films with S-rich surfaces. As shown in Fig. 3d, cell CZTSSe04, which had a relatively low SeS2/Se weight ratio of 0.13 wt%, exhibited [S]/([S] + [Se])-ratio-based grading of the notch type in the absorber layer. The formation of [S]/([S] + [Se])-ratio-based grading was more difficult in the absorber layer of cell CZTSSe05, which had a relatively high SeS2/Se weight ratio of 0.63 wt%. Therefore, the [S]/([S] + [Se])-ratio-based grading and band gap grading in the absorber can be controlled by using an appropriate SeS2/Se weight ratio, as in cell CZTSSe02. Because of the stepwise release of chalcogen elements from SeS2, the incorporation behaviors of S and Se change throughout the heating and cooling processes. Finally, SeS2 can be recommended as an alternative sulfur source in place of S elements for the control of the S content in CZTSSe absorbers and even for obtaining band-gap-graded CZTSSe absorbers.
The band gap of a CZTSSe alloy increases linearly with increasing [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio.33 Under the assumption that the conduction-band minimum energy (EC) is 1.50 eV and that the valence-band maximum energy (EV) is 0.00 eV in CZTS, it can be shown that EC is 1.15 eV and EV is 0.15 eV in CZTSe.33 The band gap grading in a CZTSSe absorber layer can be calculated using the results presented in Fig. 3d, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. The band gap varies with the SeS2/Se weight ratio used during the annealing of the absorber precursor. In cell CZTSSe04, the band gap value at the CdS–CZTSSe interface (Eg1) was 1.08 eV, and this value decreased to 1.01 eV inside the CZTSSe (Eg2). In cell CZTSSe02, the value of Eg1 was 1.15 eV, and the band gap decreased sharply to Eg2 = 1.04 eV at a depth of approximately 0.2 μm and remained constant thereafter. In cell CZTSSe05, the value of Eg1 was 1.25 eV, and by a depth of approximately 0.56 μm, the band gap had increased to 1.29 eV (Eg2). If the SeS2/Se weight ratio is low, as in cell CZTSSe04, S has a small doping effect because of the low partial pressures of Sx and SexS8−x induced by the vaporization of SeS2 during the heating and cooling stages of the annealing process. If the SeS2/Se weight ratio is high, as in cell CZTSSe05, the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio remains relatively constant, as shown in Fig. 3d, and the band gap is also constant, as indicated in Fig. 4c, because of the high partial pressures of Sx and SexS8−x resulting from SeS2 vaporization. However, if an appropriate SeS2/Se weight ratio is used, as in cell CZTSSe02, band gap grading is achieved at the CdS–CZTSSe interface. As in cell CZTSSe02, EV grading at the CdS–CZTSSe interface can reduce the density of the holes at the interface and inhibit interface recombination by acting as a hole transport barrier. Moreover, EC grading at the CdS–CZTSSe interface can lead to the absorption of photons with less energy than Eg1, thereby improving the quantum efficiency and increasing the current. Furthermore, the EC grading at the CdS–CZTSSe interface is related to the depletion width (Wd). The collection length of the photogenerated carriers in an n+–p junction solar cell is approximately the sum of Wd and the minority carrier diffusion length.37 As shown in Fig. 4d, Wd can be calculated from the measured NCV.40 The values of Wd for cells CZTSSe02, CZTSSe04, and CZTSSe05 were 0.187 μm, 0.222 μm, and 0.149 μm, respectively. Thus, Wd increases as the Se content at the absorber surface increases. We can assume that the Fermi energy level is pinned at approximately 0.02 eV above the EC of CZTSe for n-type doping.33 When the Fermi energy pinning level falls below the EC of CZTSSe, it becomes more difficult to dope the surface to n-type.41 When the CZTSSe absorber surface can be easily doped to n-type, a type-inverted n-type phase forms at the p-type absorber surface.41 In this case, electron–hole separation occurs easily, and Wd increases. As EC decreases at the CdS–CZTSSe interface, EC approaches the Fermi energy pinning level.33 As a result, such a type-inverted n-type phase could form more easily at the p-type absorber surface in CZTSSe02 and CZTSSe04 than in CZTSSe05. Therefore, cells CZTSSe02 and CZTSSe04, which had high Se contents at their absorber surfaces, exhibited broad Wd characteristics, facilitating improved collection of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Wd of cell CZTSSe02 was comparable to the depth of approximately 0.2 μm below the CdS–CZTSSe interface at which the band gap changed, as shown in Fig. 4a. Thus, the graded band gap characteristics of cell CZTSSe02 were located in the depletion region. The rate of recombination in the depletion region can be reduced by increasing the barrier height by means of increasing the band gap in the depletion region.26 This increases VOC, but JSC can simultaneously decrease because of the Fermi energy pinning level if the region with a wider band gap is not sufficiently thin. Therefore, cell CZTSSe02, which had a wider band gap at the CdS–CZTSSe interface than cell CZTSSe04, exhibited improved VOC characteristics. Although cell CZTSSe02 had a wider band gap than cell CZTSSe04, it showed similar JSC characteristics because of the band gap grading in the depletion region, even when a type-inverted n-type phase had effectively formed at the p-type absorber surfaces of both samples. Ultimately, cell CZTSSe02, which exhibited good formation of the type-inverted n-type phase at the p-type absorber surface and good band gap grading in the depletion region, demonstrated 12.3% efficiency.
 Fig. 4  The band gaps in [S]/([S] + [Se])-ratio-graded CZTSSe absorber layers. (a) In cell CZTSSe02, EC decreased from 1.26 eV at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 1.18 eV at a depth of approximately 0.2 μm, and EV increased from 0.11 eV to 0.14 eV; therefore, Eg decreased from 1.15 eV to 1.04 eV. (b) At the CdS–CZTSSe interface in cell CZTSSe04, EC was 1.21 eV and EV was 0.13 eV; therefore, Eg1 was 1.08 eV. Inside the absorber, EC was 1.16 eV and EV was 0.15 eV, resulting in a decreased Eg2 of 1.01 eV. (c) At the CdS–CZTSSe interface in cell CZTSSe05, EC was 1.34 eV and EV was 0.09 eV; therefore, Eg1 was 1.25 eV. Inside the absorber, EC was 1.37 eV and EV was 0.08 eV, resulting in an increased Eg2 of 1.29 eV. (d) The C–V charge densities (NCV) in the CZTSSe absorber layers at a temperature of 300 K and a frequency of 100 kHz. The depletion width (Wd) at Vbias = 0 was 0.187 μm for cell CZTSSe02, 0.222 μm for cell CZTSSe04, and 0.149 μm for cell CZTSSe05. 
4. Conclusions
We examined the relationship between the SeS2/S weight ratio introduced during the annealing process of a CZTSSe absorber and the resulting band gap grading. It was found that the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio can be controlled by using an appropriate SeS2/S weight ratio, and band gap grading was observed in the depletion region of the CZTSSe absorber thus produced. The presence of band gap grading in a sufficiently thin depletion region improved the VOC. Among the CZTSSe solar cells that had band gaps of 1.2 eV or less, cell CZTSSe02 had the highest VOC (0.521 V) and the lowest VOC deficit (0.576 V). Moreover, effective formation of a type-inverted n-type phase at the p-type absorber surface and suitable band gap grading in the depletion region improved the JSC characteristics. The 12.3%-efficiency CZTSSe solar cell produced via sputtering demonstrated the highest efficiency among the vacuum-processed solar cells. Therefore, the hybrid chalcogen chemical SeS2 is concluded to show promis as a potential chalcogenization source for the production of high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells. However, the chalcogenization mechanism has to be investigated for further studies. Further improvements of the sulfo-selenization process using this hybrid chalcogenization source are expected to enable the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency CZTSSe thin-film solar cells. The potential chalcogenization source and the fabrication process proposed based on the results of this study can be applied not only in research on thin-film solar cells but also in various fields related to PV devices and chalcogen-based materials.

 	Fig. 1  Device characteristics of the CZTSSe solar cells: (a) the current density–voltage curves under a simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum and an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) produced by a solar simulator and (b) the EQEs at a bias of 0 V and the calculated band gaps (inset).	 

 	Fig. 2  Compositional distributions of the CZTSSe absorber layers for cells with various SeS2/Se weight ratios as determined via STEM-EDS measurements: (a–c) the compositions of (a) cell CZTSSe02, (b) cell CZTSSe04, and (c) cell CZTSSe05 and (d and e) for these three cells, (d) the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratios and (e) the [Se]/([S] + [Se]) ratios. All cells have similar [Cu]/([Zn] + [Sn]) and [Zn]/[Sn] ratios, but the atomic percentages of S and Se differ.	 

 	Fig. 3  The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio in the CZTSSe absorber layer. (a) To measure the phase distribution throughout the depth of the absorber layer, cell CZTSSe02 was mechanically polished using a dimple grinder until the Mo back contact layer was exposed. (b) The depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy results of the absorber layer of CZTSSe02 in the depth direction. The depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a 1 mW, 532 nm laser. The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio was 0.18 at 0.10 μm from the CdS–CZTSSe interface in the depth direction and less than 0.14 below a depth of 0.20 μm, in which region it remained relatively constant. (c) A comparison of the Raman peaks from that at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to that at a depth of 0.35 μm reveals that the Raman peak was broader near the CdS–CZTSSe interface than inside the CZTSSe. This is because of an increasing S content. (d) The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratios of cells CZTSSe02 (red line), CZTSSe04 (black line), and CZTSSe05 (blue line). The [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of CZTSSe02 was calculated based on the depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy results using the optical method described in ref. 36. The results obtained via STEM-EDS (solid red line) and Raman spectroscopy (dashed red line) for the [S]/([S] + [Se]) ratio of cell CZTSSe02 indicate similar trends.	 

 	Fig. 4  The band gaps in [S]/([S] + [Se])-ratio-graded CZTSSe absorber layers. (a) In cell CZTSSe02, EC decreased from 1.26 eV at the CdS–CZTSSe interface to 1.18 eV at a depth of approximately 0.2 μm, and EV increased from 0.11 eV to 0.14 eV; therefore, Eg decreased from 1.15 eV to 1.04 eV. (b) At the CdS–CZTSSe interface in cell CZTSSe04, EC was 1.21 eV and EV was 0.13 eV; therefore, Eg1 was 1.08 eV. Inside the absorber, EC was 1.16 eV and EV was 0.15 eV, resulting in a decreased Eg2 of 1.01 eV. (c) At the CdS–CZTSSe interface in cell CZTSSe05, EC was 1.34 eV and EV was 0.09 eV; therefore, Eg1 was 1.25 eV. Inside the absorber, EC was 1.37 eV and EV was 0.08 eV, resulting in an increased Eg2 of 1.29 eV. (d) The C–V charge densities (NCV) in the CZTSSe absorber layers at a temperature of 300 K and a frequency of 100 kHz. The depletion width (Wd) at Vbias = 0 was 0.187 μm for cell CZTSSe02, 0.222 μm for cell CZTSSe04, and 0.149 μm for cell CZTSSe05.
