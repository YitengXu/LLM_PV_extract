    , Accepted 5th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent anti-bending ability are successfully fabricated, in which the novel cathode PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) is used. With a bending radius of 1.0 cm, when the bending cycle, N, equals 0, 10000 and 20000, the power conversion efficiency as a function of N, η(N), is 13.91%, 10.86% and 3.45%, or 100%, 78% and 25% of η(0), respectively. During bending along an edge of our FPSC, we found that the reductions of layer conductance, φ(N), for the cathode, electron transport layer, perovskite layer, and hole transport layer are essential for reduction of η(N) due to bending. For each of the above constituent layer “i”, when N increases, the normalized layer conductance fi(N), i.e. φi(N)/φi(0), consistently and markedly decreases, and its reduction rate consistently increases. η(N) can be well fitted by the product of fi(N)mi for the mentioned four layers, and the power, mi, is determined by fitting. The “i” for the cathode is marked as “1”, and when the cathode is improved as mentioned, not only the reduction rate of f1(N) with N sharply decreases, but also the power, m1, largely decreases from 1.52 to 0.0076. When the novel cathode is used, the influence of its layer conductance reduction on η(N) reduction due to bending greatly decreases.
Introduction
The development of perovskite solar cells has attracted tremendous attention, due to their sky-rocketing power conversion efficiency (PCE), η.1–5 Within 10 years, the η of perovskite solar cells increased from the initial 3.8%6 to the current record of 25.2%.7 Researchers are gradually trying to solve the problems that limit their application, such as by improving the stability,8–13 reducing the material toxicity,14etc. It is expected that the elimination of these problems would finally pave the way to their mass commercialization.15–17 Among the various types of perovskite solar cells, an important branch is the flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs).18–21 To fabricate FPSCs, usually, organic substrates are used, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), which have wonderful anti-bending ability.22,23 However, in order to achieve an η value as large as possible, it is required that the cathode and the electron transport layer (ETL) should be annealed at approximately 500–600 °C, which is in conflict with the thermal endurance of the organic substrates.11,24–26 Another disadvantage of the organic substrates is that the quality of the perovskite layer is poor due to their unevenness.27–30 Consequently, the η values of FPSCs with organic substrates were unsatisfactory.
Indium tin oxide (ITO) has excellent electrical conductance and transparency, as well as good contact with the ETL, and it is widely used in regular (n–i–p) structured FPSCs as the cathode.31–35 However, its anti-bending ability is poor. Even if the FPSCs with an ITO cathode are subjected to only a small number of bending cycles, a relatively large number of cracks develop in the ITO cathode and its conductance sharply decreases, which lead to the manifest reduction of η for FPSCs.15 Therefore, it is urgent to find a cathode material with superior anti-bending ability, and also with excellent electrical conductivity and transparency, as well as good contact with the ETL.
It is usually considered that during bending, the emergence and development of cracks are the critical reasons that cause the reduction of η for FPSCs. However, experimental results showed that in our FPSCs, during bending, the consistent and marked reduction of layer conductance, φ, which is the reciprocal of layer resistance, of the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and hole transport layer (HTL) in FPSCs is essential for the consistent reduction of η. The emergence and development of cracks in one of the mentioned four layers is an important reason that led to the layer conductance reduction. However, it is difficult to quantitatively characterize the cracking extent. And, it's not the only reason, because some micro factors also play important roles that lead to the layer conductance reduction. In order to quantitatively study the layer conductance for each of these four layers of FPSCs, we adopted the high resistance method. The influence of layer conductance reduction of each of these four layers on the reduction of η for FPSCs due to bending is studied. Maybe this failure analysis method can be used in other flexible devices when they are bent using a cylinder with a fixed bending radius.
Experimental results
Layer conductance
In order to quantitatively study the layer conductance reduction of the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL in FPSCs due to bending, and to set up the link between layer conductance reduction and reduction of η due to bending, we adopted the high resistance method. However, the area of our FPSC is as small as 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, and it is difficult to bend a sample with such a small area tens of thousands of times. The following procedures are designed. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), on a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm PEN substrate, a cuboid film with the same layer depth, the same material was fabricated with the same fabrication method for each of the four constituent layers in FPSCs. At the centre of the film, a zone of 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, which is the size of the active area of our FPSC, was reserved, while the film outside the zone was removed. Au electrodes with the same layer depth were evaporated on the two sides of the zone. A home-made bending machine was used to bend the 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm substrate with the 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm film at the centre, along the edge vertical to the Au electrodes, automatically. The details of the machine are given in Section 1 of the ESI.† Along the edge vertical to the Au electrodes, for one of the four layers labelled “i”, the layer resistance of the film, Ri, was measured with a high resistance meter, and the corresponding layer conductance is obtained using φi = 1/Ri. We found that when the bending radius, r, is fixed as 1.0 cm, for the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL in the FPSC, and when the bending cycle, N, increases, the layer conductance, φi(N), consistently and markedly decreases, which is essential for the consistent reduction of η of the FPSC.

During bending, in each of the constituent layers, cracks are formed mainly parallel to the Au electrodes. When N increases, a greater number of and wider cracks appear.28,30,36 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of each of the constituent layers studied after bending are presented in the ESI.† We consider that cracking is an important factor that leads to the layer conductance reduction. Moreover, from the micro perspective it can be deduced that local lattice distortions and energy band modifications in the constituent layer are produced during bending, which lead to the changes in mobility and carrier concentration. These factors also contributed to the layer conductance reduction during bending.
PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) cathode
At first we used a very thin layer of ITO(20 nm) as the cathode to maintain good contact with SnO2. But, the electrical conductance of this very thin ITO layer is quite small. In order to increase the electrical conductance of the cathode, a PEDOT:PSS:Li layer with both wonderful electrical conductivity and excellent anti-bending ability proposed by Wang et al.37 was fabricated parallel to the very thin ITO(20 nm) layer. PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) as a whole functions as the cathode for our FPSCs. The ITO(20 nm) layer was fabricated on PEDOT:PSS:Li via magnetron sputtering. The fabrication details of PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) are given in Section 2 of the ESI.†
Modifications of the ETL and perovskite layer
In some of our FPSCs, the ETL and the perovskite layer are modified. In the literature, high quality SnO2 nanoparticle dispersion liquid was used to fabricate the SnO2 layer as the ETL,38 while doping SnCl2·H2O with lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) to form the SnO2:Li layer as the ETL has shown advantages.39 We combined these two methods and doped the SnO2 nanoparticle dispersion liquid with LiTFSI to fabricate the SnO2:Li layer as the improved ETL. The fabrication details of SnO2:Li are given in Section 3 of the ESI.† For the perovskite layer, an improvement method was proposed by Liu et al.40 In their research, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) was treated with 2.0 mg mL−1 methimazole (MMI)/iso-propanol (IPA) solution, and the quality of the perovskite layer was largely improved. We adopted their method and improved it. In our method, MAPbI3 is treated with 2.0 mg mL−1 MMI/IPA and 0.5 mg mL−1 MMI/(IPA/diethyl ether (DTE), v:v = 1:4) solutions, each once, to form MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI as the improved perovskite layer. The fabrication details of MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI are given in Section 4 of the ESI.† Discussions of the anti-bending ability of the HTL are given in Section 5 of the ESI.†

J–V characteristics of unbent FPSCs
All of the FPSCs studied in this article have a planar architecture of PEN/cathode/ETL/perovskite/HTL/Au. The cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL are abbreviated as “C”, “E”, “P” and “H”, respectively. For the cathode, ETL and perovskite layer, each of them includes two cases: before and after improvement, which are labelled “0” and “1”, respectively. For the cathode, “C0” and “C1” represent ITO(185 nm) and PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm), respectively. For the ETL, “E0” and “E1” represent SnO2 and SnO2:Li, respectively. For the perovskite layer, “P0” and “P1” represent MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI, respectively. For the HTL, in this article, only 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is used. Correspondingly, the notations of the FPSCs are simplified. For example, the FPSC with the “C1/E1/P1/H” architecture is abbreviated as “C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC”.
The illustration of the 3-D architecture, cross-sectional SEM image, energy band diagram, forward (FW) and backward (BW) scanned J–V curves under AM 1.5G irradiation for the unbent C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC are presented in Fig. 1(b)–(e), respectively.
In the experiment, the solar irradiation power density, Pin, of the solar irradiation simulator equals 1000 W m−2. The η is decided using: (1)in which Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, and FF is the filling factor. The J–V parameters of the FW and BW scanned J–V curves for the unbent C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC are listed in Table 1. The η obtained by BW scanning is 13.91%. The hysteresis index, h, is defined as h = (ηBW − ηFW)/ηBW,41 in which ηBW and ηFW are the η values calculated from the BW and the FW scanned J–V curves, respectively. For C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, h is 2.08%. If not specifically indicated, the η values discussed in this article are all obtained from the BW scanned J–V curves for the FPSCs.

The J–V curves for the unbent FPSCs all with C1 as the cathode, with ETLs of E0 or E1, and with perovskite layers of P0 or P1, are presented in Fig. 1(f). The corresponding J–V parameters are listed in Table 2. For the FPSCs with C1 as the cathode, compared with those of C1/E0/P0/H-FPSC, the η, Jsc, Voc and FF increase, when E0 is replaced by E1, or when P0 is replaced by P1, or when both E0 and P0 are replaced. For the last case, all of the four parameters are the largest.

J–V characteristics of bent FPSCs
For the cathode, ETL and perovskite layer, each of them includes two cases: before and after improvement, and therefore, there are 23, or 8, possible combinations for the FPSC architecture. We found that when C0 is used, the anti-bending ability of the FPSC is unsatisfactory, and the improvements in the ETL or the perovskite layer are useless. Therefore, when C0 is used, only the C0/E0/P0/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs are discussed. When C1 is used, the improvements in the ETL or the perovskite layer have large influence. Therefore, all of the C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H and C1/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs are discussed. The J–V parameters for all of the FPSCs studied are listed in Table 2.
When the bending radius, r, is 1.0 cm, after bending, the effects of the bending cycle, N, on the normalized J–V parameters η(N)/η(0), Jsc(N)/Jsc(0), Voc(N)/Voc(0) and FF(N)/FF(0), for the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, are presented in Fig. 2(a)–(d). The FPSCs were bent along the edges parallel to the y-axis as shown in Fig. 1(b) with a bending machine.
 Fig. 2  (a–d) Effects of N on the normalized J–V parameters η(N)/η(0), Jsc(N)/Jsc(0), Voc(N)/Voc(0) and FF(N)/FF(0), for the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, when r = 1.0 cm. 
In Fig. 2(a), for the FPSCs with C1 as the cathode, when E0 is replaced by E1, or when P0 is replaced by P1, or when both E0 and P0 are replaced, the anti-bending ability of the FPSC is improved. The last case has the best anti-bending ability.
Generally, for all of the FPSCs studied, when N increases, η decreases from its initial value, η(0), i.e. the η of the unbent FPSC. For C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, its η(0) equals 13.91%. Although it is smaller than that of C0/E1/P1/H-FPSC, 14.43%, C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC has the best anti-bending ability among all of the FPSCs studied. Compared with those of the FPSCs with C1, when N increases, the η values of the FPSCs with C0 decrease much more quickly from η(0). For C0/E1/P1/H-FPSC, when N = 1000, η remains at 7.38%, or 51% of the η(0). When N = 2000, η remains at 1.16%, or only 8% of the η(0). When 0 < N < 2000, the average reduction rate of η, vη, equals 66.35 ppm per bending. For C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, when N = 2000, η remains at 13.54%, or 97% of the η(0). When N = 10000, the η for C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC remains at 10.86%, or 78% of the η(0). When N = 20000, there is still an η of 3.09%, or 22% of the η(0). As N increases, the vη for C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC increases. When 0 < N < 10000, vη = 3.05 ppm per bending. When 10000 < N < 20000, vη = 7.77 ppm per bending. The vη for C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than that for C0/E1/P1/H-FPSC.
In Fig. 2(b)–(d), it can be seen that Jsc, Voc and FF are all functions of N. Generally, for all of the FPSCs studied, when N increases, Jsc, Voc and FF decrease, but their decreasing extents are different. C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC is taken as an example. When N = 10000, Jsc(N) remains at 17.76 mA cm−2, which is 83% of Jsc(0). Voc(N) remains at 1.02 V, which is 97% of Voc(0). FF(N) remains at 60.12%, which is 97% of FF(0). When N increases, the reduction of Jsc(N), rather than that of Voc(N) and FF(N), is the major factor responsible for the reduction of the η.
Here, we define the failure efficiency, ηf, for the bent FPSCs. After bending, when η is smaller than ηf, the FPSC is defined as failed. The corresponding N is defined as the failure bending cycle for the FPSC, Nf. The results of Nf for the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, when ηf is 8%, 5% and 2%, are listed in Table S2.† For C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, when ηf = 8%, Nf ≈ 15000, and when ηf = 2%, Nf ≈ 21000.
When ηf is fixed, the improvement ratio is defined as the ratio between the Nf for the FPSC compared and that for C0/E0/P0/H-FPSC. The calculation results of the improvement ratio when ηf is set as 8%, 5% and 2%, and when the C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H or C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSC is compared, are listed in Table S3.† When ηf = 8%, the improvement ratio for C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC is as large as 18.44.
The effects of r and N on η, Jsc, Voc and FF for the C1/E1/P1/H-FPSCs are presented in Fig. S1(a)–(d).† Generally, when r is fixed as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 cm, as N increases, η, Jsc, Voc and FF decrease. When N is fixed and r decreases, η, Jsc, Voc and FF decrease. For the C1/E1/P1-FPSCs, irrespective of whether r is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 cm, Jsc, rather than Voc and FF, is the major factor responsible for the reduction of η when N increases.
The effect of N on the J–V curve for the bent C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, when r = 1.0 cm, is presented in Fig. 3(a). Jsc(N) and Voc(N) are functions of N. When N increases, the reduction rate of Jsc(N) is larger than that of Voc(N).
 Fig. 3  (a) Effect of N on the J–V curves for the bent C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, when r = 1.0 cm. (b and c) Effects of N on Rs(N) and Rsh(N) for the bent C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, when r = 1.0 cm. 
To further investigate the influences of N on the J–V characteristics of our FPSCs, we studied the effects of N on the series resistance, Rs(N), and the shunt resistance, Rsh(N), of the bent C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, when r = 1.0 cm. The results are presented in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively. It can be seen that for all of our FPSCs studied, when N increases, Rs(N) greatly increases, and generally, Rsh(N) decreases. When the FPSC fails, the corresponding Rs(N) is approximately an order of magnitude larger than Rs(0), and Rsh(N) is approximately the half of Rsh(0). C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC is taken as an example. When N increases from 0 to 21500, Rs(N) increases from 13.1 Ω cm2 to 122.9 Ω cm2, which is approximately an order of magnitude larger than Rs(0), and Rsh(N) decreases from 2322.6 Ω cm2 to 833.7 Ω cm2, which is 35.9% of Rsh(0).
According to the diode equivalent circuit model for solar cells, generally, when Rs greatly increases, the major impact on the J–V parameters is that Jsc greatly decreases, and FF decreases. When Rsh decreases, FF and Voc decrease.42 From this aspect, in our bent FPSCs, mainly, it is the reduction of Rs that leads to the reduction of Jsc, and further to the reduction of η. To better understand the J–V characteristics of the bent FPSCs, it is critical to investigate the influences of bending on the electrical conductivity properties of the constituent layers.
Reduction of layer conductance and η(N) due to bending
Reduction of layer conductance
For the PEN substrate of our FPSCs, the tensile modulus is 2200 MPa,43 and the flexural modulus is 2250 MPa,43 and it exhibits good anti-bending and anti-deformation abilities. The anti-bending ability of the Au film is excellent due to its metal ductility.
Therefore in our FPSCs, the layers that affect the reduction of η include the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL. With the high resistance method, when N = 0, the φi(0) values of these four constituent layers in our FPSCs were measured, and the results are listed in Table S4.†
The normalized layer conductance, fi(N), is defined by us as follows: fi(N) = φi(N)/φi(0)(2)which satisfies fi(0) = 1. When N increases, fi(N) monotonously decreases. The experimental data of fi(N) for the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL in FPSCs are presented in Fig. 4(a)–(g).

We propose that during bending, the layer conductance reductions of the constituent layers studied are essential for the reduction of η of the FPSCs. As shown in Fig. 4, for all of the constituent layers studied, when N increases, fi(N) consistently and markedly decreases, and its reduction rate consistently increases. When N is sufficiently large, fi(N) is almost 0. In order to fit fi(N), we introduced a function: 1 − aiN − biN2. There is a critical point for the function, Nci, which satisfies: 1 − aiNci − biNci2 = 0(3)therefore: (4)
We found that for all of the constituent layers studied, fi(N) can be well fitted using the following function: (5)in which ai and bi are positive constants to be decided via fitting. ffiti(0) = 1, and ffiti(Nci) = 0. The reduction rate of ffiti(N) when 0 ≤ N < Nci is as follows: (6)
From eqn (4) and (6), it can be derived that (7)where (8)
Therefore, ai is the reduction rate of fi(N) when N = 0, ai and bi are both positively related to the reduction rate of fi(N) when N increases, and ci is the reduction rate of fi(N) when N = Nci. From the experimental results of fi(N), it can be seen that for all of the constituent layers studied, ai and bi are both positive. The fitting results of ai and bi, as well as the corresponding ci and Nci, for all of the constituent layers studied are listed in Table 3.

With decided ai and bi, the ffiti(N) for all of the constituent layers studied are calculated. The fitting results are also presented in Fig. 4(a)–(g) to compare with the corresponding experimental data of fi(N). It can be seen that for all of the constituent layers studied, fi(N) and ffiti(N) well agree with each other.
In eqn (6), when N increases, “the smaller the ai or bi is, the smaller the reduction rate of ffiti(N) becomes”, here, fi(N) directly marks the anti-bending ability of the corresponding layer "i". It is the layer that owns an “anti-bending ability”, not the layer conductance.
In Table 3, when the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, ai sharply decreases from 23.55 to 1.46, and bi from 1893.15 to 1.97. When the ETL is improved from E0 to E1, bi decreases, while ai increases. When the perovskite layer is improved from P0 to P1, both ai and bi decrease. From this aspect, the improvement of the cathode is prominent, while the improvements of the ETL and perovskite layer are limited.
According to eqn (8), the smaller the ai or bi is, the smaller the ci becomes. In Table 3, when the cathode is improved, ci sharply decreases, and Nci sharply increases. When the ETL or perovskite layer is improved, ci decreases, and Nci increases.
During bending, cracks are formed in the constituent layers of the FPSCs. We consider that cracking is an important feature that leads to the layer conductance reduction of the constituent layers. The SEM images of ITO(185 nm), PEDOT:PSS:Li, PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm), SnO2, SnO2:Li, MAPbI3, MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI and spiro-OMeTAD after bending, when r = 1.0 cm, are presented in Fig. S2–S9,† respectively.
For the cathode, the anti-bending ability of PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) is much better than that of ITO(185 nm), due to the excellent anti-bending ability of PEDOT:PSS:Li, as demonstrated in Fig. S2–S4.† For the ETL, the anti-bending ability of SnO2:Li is better than that of SnO2, as demonstrated in Fig. S5 and S6.† For the perovskite layer, the anti-bending ability of MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI is better than that of MAPbI3, as demonstrated in Fig. S7 and S8.† For the HTL, the anti-bending ability of spiro-OMeTAD is satisfactory, as shown in Fig. S9.† The excellent anti-bending ability of the C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC is attributed to the optimization of each one of the constituent layers.
Moreover, from the micro perspective it can be deduced that local lattice distortions and energy band modifications in the constituent layer are also produced during bending, which lead to the changes in mobility and carrier concentration. These factors also contributed to the layer conductance reduction of the constituent layers during bending.
We performed Hall measurements to study the effects of N on the mobility, μ, the carrier concentration, n or p, and the sheet resistance, Rsq, for bent ITO(185 nm) and PEDOT:PSS:Li, when r = 1.0 cm.
The results are presented in Fig. 5(a)–(c). When N increases from 0, the mobility and the carrier concentration for ITO(185 nm) and PEDOT:PSS:Li first decrease with small reduction rates, and then the reduction rates greatly increase, as showed in Fig. 5(a) and (b).

Correspondingly, when N increases from 0, the Rsq values for ITO(185 nm) and PEDOT:PSS:Li first increase slowly, and then the increasing rates greatly increase, as showed in Fig. 5(c).
From the SEM and Hall measurement results, it can be deduced that for ITO(185 nm) and PEDOT:PSS:Li, during bending, even before the macroscopic cracks are formed, point defects, defect clusters, local lattice distortions, energy band modifications etc. appear in the layers, which also contribute to the layer conductance reduction. When N increases, more and more microscopic defects and macroscopic cracks in the layer appear, and the layer conductance decreases, which is characterized by fi(N). For the other constituent layers, we infer that a similar mechanism applies.
Relationship between the reduction of J–V parameters and that of layer conductance
After bending, the failure of the whole FPSC device is associated with the failure of every constituent layer. But their influential extents are definitely different. We established a phenomenological model to study the relationship between the reduction of J–V parameters and that of layer conductance.
We used the following functions to fit Jsc(N), Voc(N) and FF(N): (9) (10) (11)where i is the positive integer that labels the constituent layers of FPSCs, and k is the total number of constituent layers considered.
In eqn (9)–(11), miJ, miV and miF are positive values to be fitted. fi(N)miJ, fi(N)miV and fi(N)miF mark the influence of the layer conductance reduction of layer “i” on the reduction of Jsc(N), Voc(N) and FF(N), for the FPSCs due to bending. As fi(N) is fitted using 1 − aiN − biN2, the smaller the ai, bi or miJ, the less the influence of the layer conductance reduction of layer “i” on the reduction of Jsc(N) due to bending. The cases of Voc(N) and FF(N) are similar. Because the PEN substrate and the Au anode have little influence on the reduction of Jsc(N), Voc(N) and FF(N), for our FPSCs due to bending, we did not consider these two layers in this article. Therefore in eqn (9)–(11), k equals 4, and i equals 1, 2, 3 and 4, which represent the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL, respectively. When i equals 1, 2 or 3, there are two cases: before and after improvement. When i = 1, the two cases are labelled C0 and C1. When i = 2, E0 and E1. When i = 3, P0 and P1. When i = 4, the only case is the spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. For Jfitsc(N), eqn (9) can be rewritten as the following: Jfitsc(N,m1J,m2J,m3J,m4J) = Jsc(0)[f1(N)]m1J[f2(N)]m2J[f3(N)]m3J[f4(N)]m4J(12)where fi(N), i = 1, 2, 3, and 4, are calculated according to eqn (5) with the parameters ai and bi listed in Table 3.
When the mentioned four layers are considered, eqn (10) and (11) for Vfitoc(N) and FFfit(N) can be rewritten in forms very similar to eqn (12), and they are shown by eqn (S1) and (S2), respectively, in Section 6 of the ESI.†
For an FPSC with a decided architecture of C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H or C0/E1/P1/H, the mean squared error of the fittings for Jsc(N), which is marked as χJ2, is defined as the following: (13)where j is the positive integer that labels the experimental data, and q is the total number of experimental data.
The mean squared errors of the fittings for Voc(N) and FF(N), which are marked as χV2 and χF2, can be defined in forms very similar to eqn (13), and they are shown by eqn (S3) and (S4), respectively, in Section 6 of the ESI.†
For an FPSC with a decided architecture, the values of miJ, miV and miF, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, are fitted to achieve the χJ2, χV2 and χF2 as small as possible. For the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, the fitting results of miJ, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the corresponding minimum χJ2 are listed in Table 4.

Similarly, the fitting results of miV and miF, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the corresponding minimum χV2 and χF2 are listed in Tables S5 and S6,† respectively.
For the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H or C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, the experimental data of Jsc(Nj) and the fitting curves of Jfitsc(N) are compared in Fig. 6(a). Voc(Nj) and Vfitoc(N) are compared in Fig. 6(b). FF(Nj) and FFfit(N) are compared in Fig. 6(c).

In Fig. 6(a), for the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, the experimental data, Jsc(Nj), and the fitted curves, Jfitsc(N), well agree with each other. The influence of layer conductance reduction for the four layers on the reduction of Jsc(N) for FPSCs due to bending is determined using ai and bi as listed in Table 3, and using miJ, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, in Table 4. When the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, besides the sharp reduction of ai and bi as listed in Table 3, m1J greatly decreases from 1.13 to 0.0033, which decreases from the maximum of miJ to the minimum of miJ, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4.
In Fig. 6(b), for our studied FPSCs, the experimental data, Voc(Nj), and fitted curves, Vfitoc(N), well agree with each other. In Fig. 6(c), for our studied FPSCs, the experimental data, FF(Nj), and fitted curves, FFfit(N), well agree with each other. Similarly, the influence of layer conductance reduction for the four layers on the reductions of Voc(N) and FF(N) for FPSCs due to bending is determined using ai and bi as listed in Table 3, and using miV and miF, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, in Tables S5 and S6 in the ESI.† When the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, m1V and m1F only slightly decrease, and their reductions are relatively less manifest than that of m1J.
For the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, substituting eqn (9)–(11) in eqn (1), ηfit(N) is defined as follows: (14)where i is the positive integer that labels the constituent layers of FPSCs, and k is the total number of constituent layers considered, and  mi = miJ + miV + miF(15)
Similar to Jfitsc(N), Vfitoc(N) and FFfit(N), for ηfit(N), we only considered the mentioned four layers, and therefore ηfit(N,m1,m2,m3,m4) = η(0)[f1(N)]m1[f2(N)]m2[f3(N)]m3[f4(N)]m4(16)And, mi can be obtained using eqn (15) with the miJ, miV and miF results from Table 4, S5 and S6,† respectively. The mi results are listed in Table 5.

For the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, the experimental data of η(Nj) obtained from eqn (1) and the calculation result of ηfit(N) obtained from eqn (16) are compared in Fig. 6(d).
In Fig. 6(d), for our studied FPSCs, the experimental data, η(Nj), and the calculation result, ηfit(N), well agree with each other. For an FPSC with a decided architecture of C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H or C0/E1/P1/H, the mean squared error between the experimental data, η(Nj), and the calculation result, ηfit(N), which is marked as χ2, is defined as the following: (17)where j is the positive integer that labels the experimental data, and q is the total number of experimental data.
For the C0/E0/P0/H, C1/E0/P0/H, C1/E1/P0/H, C1/E0/P1/H, C1/E1/P1/H and C0/E1/P1/H architectured FPSCs, with eqn (17), it is calculated that their corresponding χ2/10−3 are 1.31, 0.74, 0.96, 1.23, 0.42 and 3.47, respectively.
In our studied FPSCs, the reduction of Jsc(N) is the most influential factor for the reduction of η(N) due to bending, that of FF(N) is in the second place, and that of Voc(N) is almost negligible. Therefore, the reduction of η(N) is largely determined by that of Jsc(N). The influence of layer conductance reduction for the mentioned four layers on the reduction of η(N) for FPSCs due to bending is determined using ai and bi as listed in Table 3, and using mi, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4, in Table 5. When the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, besides the sharp reduction of ai and bi as listed in Table 3, m1 greatly reduced from 1.52 to 0.0076, which reduced from the maximum of mi to the minimum of mi, i = 1, 2, 3 and 4. When the ETL is improved from E0 to E1, or when the perovskite layer is improved from P0 to P1, as shown in Table 5, the reduction of m2 or m3 is not manifest, when compared with that of m1. From this aspect, it is again demonstrated that in our FPSCs, the improvement of the cathode is prominent, while the improvements of the ETL and the perovskite layer are limited.
The wooden barrel principle says that the volume of water that a barrel contains depends on the shortest piece of the constituent boards. As illustrated in Fig. 7, in our FPSCs, the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, the ETL from E0 to E1, and the perovskite layer from P0 to P1. For C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC, during bending, the layer conductance reduction of the ETL is primarily responsible for the reduction of η(N). The improvement of the ETL and the perovskite layer proposed in this article is still not satisfactory. To further improve the η and the anti-bending ability of FPSCs, it is important to further improve the ETL and the perovskite layer. Maybe our failure analysis method can be used in other flexible optoelectrical devices such as flexible photodetectors, flexible laser devices, etc., when they are bent using a cylinder with a fixed bending radius.
 Fig. 7  Illustration of the wooden barrel principle in terms of the reduction of η(N) for FPSCs due to bending. 
In practical application, the deformation of FPSCs is complex and diverse. Apart from bending, there are many other deformation conditions, for example, stretching.44–46 It still requires further investigation to study the failure process of FPSCs when they endure more complicated deformation.
Conclusions
For the first time in FPSCs, PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm) is used as the cathode to replace the conventional ITO cathode. The ETL is improved from SnO2 to SnO2:Li, and the perovskite layer from MAPbI3 to MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI. The η(0) of C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC achieved 13.91%. After bending, when r equals 1.0 cm, and N equals 10000, 15000 and 20000, η remained at 10.86%, 7.99% and 3.45%, respectively, or 78%, 57% and 25% of η(0), respectively. We found that the reductions of the layer conductance of the cathode, ETL, perovskite layer and HTL in FPSCs are essential for the reduction of η(N) of FPSCs due to bending. With the high resistance method, it is experimentally demonstrated that when N increases, for each constituent layer “i”, the normalized layer conductance, fi(N), consistently and markedly decreases, and its reduction rate consistently increases. The relationships between the reductions of J–V parameters, Jsc(N), Voc(N), FF(N) and η(N), and those of fi(N)miJ, fi(N)miV, fi(N)miF and fi(N)mi are established, where miJ, miV and miF, are positive values to be fitted, and mi = miJ + miV + miF. The smaller the ai, bi or miJ, the less the influence of the layer conductance reduction of layer “i” on the reduction of Jsc(N) due to bending. The cases of Voc(N), FF(N) and η(N) are similar. The reduction of Jsc(N) is the most influential factor for the reduction of η(N) due to bending, that of the FF(N) takes the second place, and that of Voc(N) is almost negligible. When the cathode is improved from C0 to C1, not only the reduction rate of f1(N) with N sharply decreases, but also the power, m1, largely decreases from 1.52 to 0.0076. The result shows that in our FPSCs, the improvement of the cathode is prominent, while the improvements of the ETL and the perovskite layer are limited.

The solution was stirred at 400 rpm for 30 min.
The following describes the steps to fabricate the PEN/PEDOT:PSS:Li/ITO(20 nm)/SnO2:Li/MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architectured FPSC, i.e. the C1/E1/P1/H-FPSC. Each step was carried out after the sample was cooled down to room temperature. Glass and PEN substrates were rinsed with deionized water, IPA, acetone and ethanol by sonication. After drying them in N2 flow, UVCA was spin-coated on the glass substrate at 800 rpm for 5 s, and then at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The PEN substrate was then put on UVCA. The ultraviolet curing process of UVCA was performed by exposing the sample to ultraviolet lamp (Taylan YIH 365 nm) irradiation for 30 s. The sample surface was cleaned with an oxygen plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma) for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS:Li dispersion liquid was spin-coated on PEN at 1000 rpm for 5 s, and then at 2500 rpm for 60 s. The sample was first annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, and then at 150 °C for 10 min. An ITO(20 nm) layer was fabricated on PEDOT:PSS:Li using a magnetron sputtering system (CEVP Gamma1000C Edition 1.01b) in direct current mode. The sputtering power was 10 W, and the sputtering time was 15 min. The sample was annealed at 140 °C for 1 h. The sample surface was then cleaned with oxygen plasma for 2 min. SnO2:Li dispersion liquid was spin-coated on ITO(20 nm) at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The sample was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, cleaned with oxygen plasma for 5 min, and moved into a N2-filled glovebox. MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated on SnO2:Li at 1000 rpm for 5 s, and at 4000 rpm for 60 s. 10 s after the spin-coating began, 0.8 mL of DTE was dropped on the rotating sample as the second solvent. The sample was annealed at 90 °C for 10 min to form the pristine MAPbI3. 50 μL of 2.0 mg mL−1 MMI/IPA solution was dipped on the pristine MAPbI3. The sample was kept still for 3 s, then it was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s,40,48 and annealed at 90 °C for 10 min to form the once treated MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI. 50 μL of 0.5 mg mL−1 MMI/(IPA/DTE, v:v = 1:4) solution was dipped on the once treated MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI. The sample was kept still for 3 s, spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 90 °C for 10 min to form the twice treated MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI, i.e. the improved MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI perovskite layer. Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on MAPbI3:PbI2-MMI at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The sample was then moved out of the N2-filled glovebox, and it was kept in a dark anhydrous desiccator for 15 h to oxidize the spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, an 80.0 nm thick Au coating was deposited on the spiro-OMeTAD as the anode using a thermal evaporator (LJ-TH400) at a fixed deposition rate of 0.7 Å s−1. The FPSC was gently peeled off the glass substrate with the aid of the peptizing agent. The other FPSCs studied in this article were fabricated by assembling these procedures according to their architectures.
Characterization

J–V curves of the FPSCs were obtained using a source measure unit instrument (Keithley 2400) and Oriel PVIV software (Edition 2.0). During measurement, the FPSC was soaked in the irradiation generated by a xenon-lamp-based solar irradiation simulator (180 W Newport), which was adjusted to simulate AM 1.5G solar irradiation. Its intensity was calibrated using a standard reference silicon solar cell (Pharos Tech. SRC-000-TC). The FPSC was covered with a custom-made metal mask (Shenzhen Rigorous Technology Co. Ltd.), which defines the edges of the square shaped active area as 0.3 cm, so that the area of each FPSC is 0.09 cm2. The J–V curves were obtained with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and a scan step of 0.02 V. Layer conductance was measured using a high resistance meter (Keithley 6517B). A home-made bending machine was applied to bend the FPSCs automatically. The machine used a 9 V direct current power source to drive the rotation of the motors (Zhong'ao R140). The glass cylinders attached to the motors fixed the bending radius, r, as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 cm. Via modifying the decade resistance box (Hongfa J-2361) in the electric circuit, the rotation speed of the motor was controlled as 120.0 rpm, which was measured using a digital non-contact laser tachometer (UNI-T UT373). The bending cycle, N, was calculated by multiplying 120.0 rpm with the elapsed time after the rotation starts. SEM images were obtained using a focused ion beam (FIB) instrument (FEI Helios Nano Lab 600i Dual Beam System) with an electron beam voltage of 5 kV, and an electron beam current of 43 pA. Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was applied to analyze the SEM images. Carrier concentration, mobility and sheet resistance were measured using a Hall system (Accent HL5500) at room temperature. Film thickness was measured using a surface profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150). The scanning route length was 0.5 mm, and the scanning time was 20 s. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using an AFM microscope instrument (Cypher S) in tapping mode. Gwyddion Edition 2.34 AFM image processing software was applied to analyze the AFM images. Absorbance spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600Plus UV-VIS-NIR).
