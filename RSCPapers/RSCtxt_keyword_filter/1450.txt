    AbstractA novel incorporation of polyoxometalate (POM) into Cu2O photocathodes was achieved by electrostatic adsorption of polyoxometalate on Cu2O crystal faces, so that the Cu2O/POM composite films exhibit significant photovoltaic enhancement because the POM could act as electron-acceptor to retard the electron–hole recombination and facilitate the photoexcited electron transfer.
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O), an important low-cost and environment-friendly semiconductor with a direct band gap 2.1 eV and relatively high absorption coefficient in the visible region, has attracted much attention because of its extensive applications in fields such as gas sensors, photocatalysis, water splitting, lithium ion batteries, optical devices, and solar cells.1 However, the dissatisfactory power conversion efficiency really hinders its progress in practical applications. Generally, the efficiency is greatly limited by both the high carrier (electron and hole) recombination in the bulk and the low electron mobility of Cu2O. In order to solve these problems, many attempts have been carried out such as controlling morphology, doping, combination with other materials, etc.2 In particular, Cu2O modified with other materials for improving power conversion efficiency has attracted much attention.3 Huang et al. developed the Au–Cu2O core–shell heterostructures and found that the incorporation of Au nanocrystal cores into Cu2O could evidently enhance the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanocrystals.4 Ogale et al. reported the use of the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique to deposit ZnO layer on Cu2O film, so that an enhancement of photocatalytic activity was achieved.5 Recently, Huang's group reported on the synthesis of sharp-faced Cu2O crystals with positively charged {111} and {110} faces, and then the positively charged Cu2O crystal faces were employed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of photodegradation of methyl orange.6
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of molecular metal–oxo cluster compounds based mainly on Mo, W, V, Nb, and Ta elements, have shown fine physicochemical properties and various applications.7 In particular, POMs have an intrinsic characteristic of electron acceptor, which is capable of capturing the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of semiconductors and thus promote power conversion efficiency of semiconductor. Ozer and Ferry investigated the use of POMs in TiO2 suspensions to increase the photocatalytic efficiency on the degradation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene.8 Yoon et al. reported that phosphotungstic acid played a vital role in improving energy conversion efficiency of TiO2 photoanode.9 In recent five years, our group carried out several researches on the incorporation of POMs into semiconductor films to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of semiconductors.10 These above-mentioned results indicated that the modification of semiconductor materials with POMs is an effective strategy to promote their photoelectrochemical performance. Since we knew the current problem that Cu2O as a semiconductor generally possesses both the high electron–hole recombination and the low electron mobility, we have certainly considered that POMs should also be possible to modify Cu2O photocathodes so as to enhance the photovoltaic response. However, no demonstration of modifying Cu2O with POMs has been reported up to now.
Herein, we report for the first time on the incorporation of polyoxometalate [(CH3)4N]5PW10Mo2O40·4H2O]11 (denoted as PW10Mo2) into Cu2O film to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite film photocathode. By means of the Cu2O crystals prepared according to the literature method,6 a novel approach of electrostatic adsorption was used in the preparation of the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite in which the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles were made firstly by electrostatic interactions between the [PW10Mo2O40]5− anions of negative charge and the Cu2O crystal faces of positive charge. Subsequently, the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles were made into the thin film on FTO glass by using a facile dropping-liquid-casting method.
The as-prepared Cu2O pristine crystals exhibited rhombic dodecahedral and corner-truncated rhombic dodecahedral structures (Fig. 2B and ESI†). The structures of rhombic dodecahedral and corner-truncated rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O have more active faces than other morphologies.6 The rhombic dodecahedral and corner-truncated rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O oriented to show the {111} and {110} planes which were analyzed by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 2A) and XRD analysis (Fig. 3B). The {110} and {111} faces are likely more positively charged due to the high density of Cu atoms on the {110} and {111} faces; this brings an occasion towards electrostatic adsorption with negative charge [PW10Mo2O40]5− anions. As shown in Fig. 1, the formation of PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite was realized by a self-assembly process in solution in that the negative charge [PW10Mo2O40]5− anions could be absorbed onto Cu2O active faces by means of the electrostatic attractive force.

These particle morphologies and sizes were analyzed by TEM and SEM (Fig. 2 and S3 in ESI†). The observed sizes of the Cu2O crystals appeared in the size of submicrometer or micrometer (approximately 1–2 μm). Fig. 2B shows the morphology and a smooth surface of pristine Cu2O crystals. Fig. 2C and D exhibit the rough morphologies of the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles. Compared with Fig. 2B, both Fig. 2C and D appear in a rougher particle morphology of Cu2O due to the surface deposition of PW10Mo2 on Cu2O crystals. Also, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite demonstrates the coexistence of PW10Mo2 and Cu2O in the composite (Fig. 2E). In IR spectra (Fig. 3A), the peaks (curve b) at 1036, 943, 802, and 704 cm−1 are assigned to νas(P–O), νas(WO), νas(W–O–W) and νas(Mo–O–Mo) respectively, which are the characteristics of PW10Mo2. The peaks at 621 cm−1 in curve a and curve b are assigned to the νas(Cu2O–O). These above-mentioned results indicate that the PW10Mo2 was successfully absorbed on the active faces of Cu2O, and the PW10Mo2 still remains its characteristic structure. The XRD (Fig. 3B) of the pristine Cu2O particles (curve a) and PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles (curve b) reveals that the diffraction peaks of PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles highly match those of pristine Cu2O particles. Because the amount of PW10Mo2 absorbed on Cu2O crystals is rather less, the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite particles still retain the morphology of pristine Cu2O crystals. Therefore, such an incorporation of PW10Mo2 with Cu2O did not influence the crystal structure of Cu2O.

A three-electrode system was employed to measure the photovoltaic performance of the Cu2O photocathodes (ESI, Fig. S4†). The photocurrent response measurements in Fig. 3C were carried out at a constant bias of 0 V (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3C, the pristine Cu2O film shows weak photocurrent response due to the influence of fast electron–hole recombination, while the PW10Mo2/Cu2O film presents much higher photocurrent than the pristine Cu2O film. Compared to the pristine Cu2O film, the photocurrent of PW10Mo2/Cu2O film has an increase of 179% owing to the incorporation of PW10Mo2. Since the photocurrent increase closely depends on the charge-transfer power, PW10Mo2 should be responsible for improving the photoelectrochemical performance of Cu2O through facilitating photogenerated electron transfer and restraining electron–hole recombination.10
Furthermore, I–V curves (Fig. 3D) have been measured upon illumination. It was seen from Fig. 3D that the Cu2O film shows a weak photoelectrochemical performance with power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.0081%, fill factor of 0.19, short-circuit current (Jsc) of 36.49 μA cm−2, and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.16 V.12 However, the η of PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite film is 0.018%, with Jsc = 67.76 μA cm−2, Voc = 0.22 V and fill factor (ff) = 0.17. As compared to the pristine Cu2O film, an increase of 125% in the η value was gained for the PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite film. Such data are well in agreement with the results of the photocurrent response measurements, suggesting that POMs could act as an electron transfer mediator to improve effectively the photovoltaic performance of Cu2O photocathode.
The surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) can provide important information about the behavior of carrier separation and transfer at the surface or interface.13 The SPS arises from the photoexcitation of excess free carriers (electron and hole), which causes a redistribution of carrier charges. The surface photovoltage responses of the pristine Cu2O film and the PW10Mo2/Cu2O film are presented in Fig. S5.† The PW10Mo2/Cu2O film displayed the stronger SPS response than the Cu2O film. This is attributed to the fact that under the illumination the photoinduced electrons could be trapped by PW10Mo2, and then the charge separation in Cu2O was facilitated further.
Fig. S6† shows the fluorescence emission spectra of the Cu2O film and the PW10Mo2/Cu2O film. Both films have a fluorescence emission band at 390 nm. The fluorescence is clearly quenched in the PW10Mo2/Cu2O film, though the position and shape of the band remain the same. The photoinduced electron transfer from the Cu2O to PW10Mo2 clusters should be responsible for the fluorescence quenching.14 Therefore, such fluorescence quenching in the PW10Mo2/Cu2O film further proved POM as electron transfer mediator to decrease the charge recombination and facilitate the electron transfer.
From the above results, the mechanism for the photocurrent generation of PW10Mo2/Cu2O composite photocathode is proposed as illustrated in Fig. S7:† under the illumination, Cu2O absorbs light and generates electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons transfer from the CB of Cu2O15 into the CB of PW10Mo2 (Fig. S1 in ESI†), and then the electrons transfer from PW10Mo2 to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface leading to the electrolyte. Accordingly, the holes transfer from VB of Cu2O to the external circuits and finally transfer to the counter electrode. Evidently, PW10Mo2 played an important role in the electrons transfer process, in which PW10Mo2 functioned as “electron shuttle” to catch the photoinduced electron and subsequently transfer to next shuttle.
In summary, we have developed a unique means of making POM/Cu2O composites by electrostatic attractive interaction in which [PW10Mo2O40]5− anions were adsorbed on Cu2O crystal faces of positive charge. The most interesting result is the first demonstration that the introduction of POM into Cu2O could effectively improve the photovoltaic performance of Cu2O, because POM could act as an electron transfer mediator to retard the electron–hole recombination and facilitate the photoexcited electron transfer. This opens a new way to advance the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of Cu2O-based solar cells. On the other hand, such an improvement of charge separation should also be advantageous to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (by electron) and photocatalytic oxidation (by hole). Thus, the results obtained from this study are potentially useful in many applications including photocatalysis, solar photovoltaic cells, and water splitting devices. Further research on the assembly and optimization of POM/Cu2O photovoltaic devices instead of the photoelectrode is underway.
