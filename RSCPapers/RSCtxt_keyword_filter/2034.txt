, Accepted 28th June 2023First published on 1st July 2023AbstractIn the search for alternate green energy sources to offset dependence on fossil fuels, solar energy can certainly meet two needs with one deed: fulfil growing global energy demands due to its non-depletable nature and lower greenhouse gas emissions. As such, third generation thin film photovoltaic technology based organic solar cells (OSCs) can certainly play their role in providing electricity at a competing or lower cost than 1st and 2nd generation solar technologies. As OSCs are still at an early stage of research and development, much focus has been placed on improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) inside a controlled environment i.e. a glove-box (GB) filled with an inert gas such as N2. This was necessary until now, to control and study the local nanomorphology of the spin-coated blend films. For OSCs to compete with other solar energy technologies, OSCs should produce similar or even better morphologies in an open environment i.e. air, such that air-processed OSCs can result in similar PCEs in comparison to their GB-processed counterparts. In this review, we have compared GB- vs. air-processed OSCs from morphological and device physics aspects and underline the key features of efficient OSCs, processed in either GB or air.Shafket RasoolShafket Rasool received his PhD degree from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology in Advanced Materials and Chemical Engineering, with main emphasis on the fabrication and stability of large area organic photovoltaics (OPVs).

Introduction
In 2000, the world's energy demand was about 9200 Mtoe (million tons of oil equivalent) which has risen to 14200 Mtoe in 2021 (Fig. 1a).1 This energy demand will keep rising due to population growth with active urbanization, industrialization, etc. Currently, these ever-rising energy demands are being fulfilled by mostly burning non-renewable fossil fuels, for instance, 80% of the energy demand in 2021 was being met by burning fossil fuels with 29% contribution from oil, 27% from coal, and 24% from natural gas.2 Unfortunately, burning fossil fuels adds to global warming via the release of greenhouse gases (GHG), for example, CO2 emissions have risen from 26 Gt CO2/year in the year 2000, to 36 Gt CO2 per year in the year 2020, which is 38% higher than in 2000 in just two decades (Fig. 1b).3 If CO2 emissions per capita are drawn against GDP per capita (Fig. 1c), CO2 emissions are the highest among the most developed countries in the world. CO2 is a major contributor to GHG emissions, i.e. in the USA alone, 78.8% of the total GHG emitted in 2020 comprised of CO2.3,4 This continued rise in GHG emissions, which also includes methane gas, will result in global median surface temperature rising above 1.5 °C in the early 2030s which would be devastating for our planet Earth. Considering the “Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)” proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and also achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, restricting CO2 emissions and replacing fossil fuel based power-plants (especially coal-based power plants) could prolong this global temperature rise of 1.5 °C until 2050, and achieve zero CO2 net emission by 2050.5 This NZE could result in lower than 1.5 °C global temperature rise by 2100. If GHG emissions aren’t restricted, and we continue to fulfill our energy demands using the current energy generation sources, which are heavily based on fossil fuels, it will result in a global median surface temperature rise of more than 2.5 °C.5

Keeping track of the NZE as proposed by the IEA and within the scope of the Paris Agreement, much of our energy dependence must shift towards renewable energy sources. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy is the cleanest non-depletable source of energy. A seismic shift has been witnessed between renewable and fossil-fuel-based non-renewable energy sources in the last decade. For instance, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE; the estimated revenue which is required to build and operate a generator over the specified cost recovery period, and is often considered as a figure of merit to measure the competitiveness of the technology) was 0.417 USD per kW h in 2010 for solar photovoltaics (PV), while intensive research and development in solar PV technology and improvement in PCEs etc. brought down the LCOE to 0.048 USD per kW h putting renewables in a competitive market (Fig. 2).6 Therefore, solar PVs are not only an efficient source of energy among other technologies, but will also be helpful to realize NZE goals by 2050.

Currently, the solar PV market is dominated by inorganic-type solar PVs. Over 90% of the solar PVs consist of either c-Si or polycrystalline Si-type modules, while among other thin film technologies, cadmium telluride (CdTe) dominates with ∼7% of the global market share. The reasons for their dominance in the energy sector lies in their efficient energy output on the lab-scale and large scale, as well as their excellent lifetimes. For example, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lab scale mono-crystalline silicon-based solar cells is 26.7% (area ∼79 cm2) while the c-Si module has shown 24.4% PCE (area ∼13177 cm2),7 and the commercial c-Si solar panel comes with ∼25 years of a lifetime thus making them an ideal choice for use in domestic and commercial applications. Other inorganic thin-film technologies include CIGS, GaAs, perovskite solar cells (PvSCs) etc., while non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells (OSCs) are also contenders among the thin film solar PV market. Currently, OSCs are in the research and development (R&D) phase with immense research focused on: (1) the design of novel and suitable electron donors and NFAs, (2) finding effective and efficient interfacial charge transport layers, (3) light soaking (LS) stability enhancement methodologies, etc. OSCs have already crossed 14% PCE on the large-area OSC sub-module scale, which is thought of as the required threshold for the commercialization of OSCs.8,9 Improving PCEs will not only lower the LCOE, but it will also help in reducing the energy payback time (EPBT). The EPBT is the time required to generate the total energy input used during the fabrication of a specific solar technology. For c-Si, the EPBT is one year while semi-transparent OSCs also have an EPBT ranging from 51 days to 1.1 years.10 If OSCs could provide similar lifetimes to c-Si, then due to the low-cost lab-synthesized raw materials, the advantages of OSCs would outweigh the c-Si solar PV in terms of flexibility, colorful building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications, low light indoor solar PVs, tailored band-gap (Eg) based solar PVs, etc. It has been reported that perfectly encapsulated OSCs with ultraviolet cut filters have retained nearly 94% of their initial efficiency under 1 sun simulated conditions (the initial PCE of OSCs was 10.2%).11 Thus OSCs, if not complete, can still take their place in the renewable energy mix in near future.
Currently, state-of-the-art highly efficient OSCs are being processed inside a controlled inert environment and have a boosted certified PCE of >19% for single junction OSCs,12,13 and 20.0% for OSCs having tandem architecture.14 Since OSCs are said to be advantageous over inorganic (such as c-Si or a-Si) solar cells in terms of their production via fully established industrial roll-2-roll (R2R) coating techniques, such industrial production is possible in an open environment. It is not feasible to provide an inert environment in such large R2R fabrication units, which makes inert-environment processed efficient OSCs rather less important from the industrial mass production aspect. Such PCEs and morphological studies of GB-OSCs are, however, still important for fundamental studies on OSCs; nevertheless, such fundamental studies and high PCEs are equally important for air-processed OSCs (air-OSCs). In this review, we have compared GB-OSCs with air-OSCs on a small-area and large-area scale, and their morphological aspect is contrasted in terms of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and finally their charge generation dynamics using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). We have also discussed important features of GB-OSCs and air-OSCs in the fabrication of efficient OSCs. Finally, an outlook for efficient small area and large-area OSCs is presented, along with the potential for commercial/niche applications of these air-OSCs.
Glove-box processed organic solar cells
Shaheen et al. reported 2.5% PCE for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs in 2001.15 Round-robin studies have since been started and breakthroughs in PCEs have often come with innovative photoactive material design, device architectural improvements, device engineering such as pre- or post-annealing, solvent vapor annealing (SVA), processing additives, etc.16–23 A decade later in 2011, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation reported 11% PCE for OSCs according to NREL, and this record was held for the next four years until Jingbo Zhao et al. achieved 11.5% PCE in single junction OSCs in 2016.24 As of 2022, OSCs have reached the milestone of certified 19.2% PCE in single junction BHJ OSCs.12 Such breakthroughs in PCEs were only possible after the invention of the novel NFA called as Y6.25 Besides, OSCs with tandem architecture have also been studied thoroughly alongside single-junction OSCs, and PCEs have progressed from an outstanding 6.5%,26 to 20.27% (Table 1).14

With the invention of novel Y-shaped Y6 NFA, immense investigations to further tune molecular properties of the Y6-derivatives are underway. Chemical structure optimizations, molecular backbone symmetry of photoactive materials, molecular orbital levels such as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), dipole moments, exciton binding energies, etc. can be computed using density functional theory (DFT).32,46–52 First the DFT study of the Y6 NFA revealed planar acceptor units around the twisted central unit with N-alkyl side chains directed towards the central core (Fig. 3a and b).25 This twisted structure helps in the enhanced solubility of Y6 in common solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), etc. Small structural modifications of Y6 NFA, such as employing the amphiphilic oligo (ethylene glycol) group led to the synthesis of a new NFA called BTO, resulting in enhanced solubility of this BTO NFA in CF and CB, along with assisting the crystalline orientations of the Y6 NFA when BTO is used as a guest additive (Fig. 3c).32 Keeping the same NFA backbone core, changing fluorine (F) atoms from the end-group of Y6 (also called BTP-4F) with chlorine (Cl) atoms to synthesize BTP-4Cl results in downshifted HOMO–LUMO energy levels with a reduced bandgap (Eg).28 Furthermore, DFT calculations have shown that the dipole moment can be manipulated using an asymmetric distribution of Cl-atoms at the end groups of the Y-series NFA, such that BO-5Cl with five Cl-atoms on one side of the NFA has a dipole moment of 15D while BO-4Cl with two Cl-atoms on each side of the NFA has a dipole moment of 4D.38 Such high dipole moments result in efficient movement of the charges along the backbone of the photoactive materials. In short, DFT calculations can provide preliminary data to assess the photophysical as well as charge-carrier dynamics behavior of the individual photoactive materials.

Yuan et al. introduced Y6-NFA for the first time and employed it in the fabrication of single-junction GB-OSCs, and obtained 15.7% PCE in conventional and inverted architecture, which was the highest PCE at that date.25 Since the introduction of Y6 NFA, a lot of structural modification has been carried out to improve the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Y6, ranging from atomic substitution in the backbone, change of solubilizing alkyl-chains at the central core unit, modification in C11 alkyl-chain positions, atomic modification or molecular extension of the end-groups, etc. Selenium (Se) atom substitution at the place of the sulphur (S) atom in Y6 (called CH1007, as shown in Fig. 4a) can further enhance their inter- and intra-molecular interactions via face-to-face π-interactions and resulted in improved charge-transport (Fig. 4b and c).53 Terminal group stacking has shown as low as 3.32 Å π-distance between two adjacent channels (Fig. 4c). OSCs based on CH1007 NFA lead to a remarkably high JSC of 27.48 mA cm−2 resulting from the red-shifted absorption, and higher charge-transport properties due to the formation of a 3D network in Se-containing CH1007 NFA backbones in the blend film.

Another significantly important modification to improve molecular packing of the NFA has been carried out by Li et al. via the modification of the C11-linear alkyl chain at the beta-position of the Y6 with branched alkyl-chains (Fig. 5a).35 Unlike Y6 (C11 linear alkyl-chain at the beta position) which forms orthorhombic vacancies along the c-axis, L8-R (branched alkyl chain at beta position) formed ellipse-shaped voids, and also L8-R showed rotational symmetry for enhanced interactions between side-chains while Y6 packed in mirror symmetry, and such motifs in the single-crystal showed an enhanced packing coefficient for L8-R (64.1% for L8-BO) in comparison to 54.5% for Y6 (Fig. 5b and c).35 Such a dense packing of the L8-R NFAs is beneficial for efficient charge-transport in the photoactive films. A denser stacking network was also reported in Y6-BO via replacing F-atoms at the terminal position (BO-4F) of the NFA with Cl-atoms (BO-4Cl).38 Such dense packing in the single-crystal of BO-4Cl results in non-covalent O–S interactions between the S-atom of the central core and the O-atom of the end-group, leading to the π-stacking distance of ∼3.15 Å. Such dense packing of the single-crystal NFAs is beneficial for charge transport in organic solar cells because it allows for efficient charge separation and collection. When NFA is densely packed, there are fewer defects or vacancies in the material, resulting in fewer sites for charge carriers to become trapped, thus can improve the overall charge transport efficiency of the final OSC. As a result of the improved molecular packing achieved via optimized branched-chain topology in such NFAs, which also resulted in optimized morphology of the blend film and tuned LUMO levels of the PM6 donor with L8-BO NFA leading to reduced non-radiative energy loss channels, and the OSCs consisting of PM6:L8-BO showed an outstanding PCE of 18.32% (17.9% certified).35

Morphology has a significant impact on the final efficiency of the OSC. A homogenous, well-ordered morphology is more desirable for efficient charge transport in the photoactive film. For reference, single-crystal morphology can be considered the most efficient as it will allow efficient charge separation and transport without defects or vacancies. OSC films are solution processed from solution and mostly contain two or more photoactive components, so achieving the morphology of a single-crystal is not possible. However, instead of single-crystal, the efficient OSC's blend films have well-ordered crystalline morphologies. The presence of ordered microstructures is a good indication of efficient charge transport in organic films. Surface morphologies of the photoactive blend films are assessed via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Liu et al. introduced a wide bandgap D18 donor polymer which gave nanofibrous morphology using Y6 as NFA, and the morphology changes to bundle-like with a diameter of ∼20 nm upon SVA (Fig. 6).34

The high crystallinity in the PM6:L8-BO blend film resulted in increased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.11 nm in comparison to the 1.05 nm RMS roughness for the PM6:Y6 blend film.35 Although high crystallinity of the photoactive film can be good for efficient charge transport through the blend film, too high crystallinity of the blend film leading to higher rms roughnesses is often considered less suitable for efficient OSCs, because, rougher films due to very high crystallinity of either donor polymer or the NFA results in ineffective charge-transport through blend films due to the reduced interfacial area between donor and acceptor materials. For instance, D18:BTPIC-4F showed RMS roughness of 2.30 nm (10.3% PCE), while D18:TTPIC-4F showed RMS roughness of 1.11 nm (17.1% PCE).54 With higher roughness, Zhou et al. found a higher trap density and large non-radiative recombinations in the D18:BTPIC-4F blend film, which were reduced in the D18:TTPIC-4F film via the chemical modification of the NFA, i.e. by extending the core of the NFA to induce stronger intra- and inter-molecular interactions (Fig. 7).54 Since these photoactive films have been prepared inside the controlled inert environment (GB-processing), these studies can be considered as reference data to fabricate efficient OSCs processed in air.

When TEM is used to study the bulk of the blend films, it can provide detailed information about the size, shape, and distribution of the acceptor particles within the film. The morphology of the blend films will depend on several factors, including the specific materials used as the acceptor and the processing conditions used to prepare the film. In general, TEM images of blend films may show a variety of morphologies, including spherical particles, elongated or fibrous structures, nanowires, or more complex shapes. The morphology of the film can be influenced by the phase separation of the blend components, the degree of aggregation of the particles, and the presence of defects or impurities, based on which, it is possible to gain insights into the properties of the film, such as its charge transport properties, optical properties, and stability, etc.21,55–58 The sizes and shapes of the fullerene-based OSCs have been controlled using the solvent additive,21 while the formation of stronger nanowire-like morphology has been reported to be obtained using the modified donor materials.56,58
On the other hand, NFA-based blend films also need strong fibrous bulk morphology to exhibit enhanced absorption of the incident photon, and generation of charge-carriers as well as their transport towards electrodes via the enhanced surface area of the donor and NFAs. For instance, Zhang et al. reported enhanced miscibility and ordered highly crystalline packing by moving the alkyl-thiolation side chains from the para- to meta-position in the small molecule donor while using BTP-eC9 as the NFA, which resulted in 16.2% PCE in all-small-molecule OSCs (Fig. 8a and b).59 Guo et al. synthesized terpolymer using PM6 with 30 mol% of BFT (called PF1) to tune the energy levels, molecular ordering, and aggregation, which resulted in the distinct fibrillar bi-continuous interpenetrating network, and improved the PCE from 16.2% for PM6:Y6 to 17.3% for PF1:Y6 (Fig. 8c and d).60 Similarly, a fibrillar network morphology of the blend for the ternary (PM6:Y6:PC71BM), as well as quaternary (PM6:CNS-6-8:Y6:PC71BM) blends resulted in outstanding PCEs of 17.00% and 18.07%, respectively (Fig. 8e and f).61 In short, in a blend of an efficient OSC, a stronger fibrillar network with a stronger and denser donor–acceptor phase difference is always beneficial to utilize the maximum amount of incident photons and the efficient charge transport.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to study the molecular packing, the direction of the arrangement of photoactive materials with respect to the substrate, and the extent of the ordering of the materials in the blend film.62–65 From the packing perspective of donor polymers and NFAs in the blend films, packing in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction i.e. perpendicular with respect to the substrate, is highly desirable in OSCs, because of the vertical flow of charge-carriers in OSCs. Also, good packing materials in OSCs result in enhanced light absorption of the incident light, enhanced mobility of the charge-carriers across the bulk of the photoactive film and reduced charge-carrier recombinations.66–75 He et al. introduced BO-5Cl NFA with the high dipole moment of 15D, which has shown a π–π stacking distance (dπ–π) of 3.56 Å in the OOP direction in pristine films, while the blend film of PM6:BO-5Cl showed dπ–π of 3.63 Å in the OOP direction as well as a very large coherence length (CCL) of 26.5 Å.38 Such a high dipole moment along with short dπ–π in the OOP direction and very large CCL is highly desirable for enhanced intramolecular interaction and well-suited charge-transport channels across the blend film with reduced non-radiative recombinations. PM6:BO-5Cl showed a non-radiative energy loss as low as 0.178 eV and a total energy loss (Eloss) of 0.522 eV (15.02% PCE), while the ternary blend PM6:BO-4Cl:BO-5Cl also showed a non-radiative energy loss as low as 0.198 eV and a total energy loss of 0.496 eV (18.56% PCE), which is among the lowest Eloss for ternary OSCs. Addition of the highly crystalline D18 polymer to PM6:L8-BO blend also results in an enhanced crystallinity of the NFA via the heterogenous nucleation seeding mechanism and results in increased fibril network and crystallinity of the blend film, as observed from the (021) diffraction peak of GIWAXS analysis (Fig. 9a and b).12 Zhu et al. showed with GIWAXS analysis that the addition of the third component can result in shorter dπ–π, closer to more crystalline blend morphology as shown in their overlapped π–π stacking locations and their corresponding lamellae peaks (Fig. 9c). It was suggested that the double fibril morphology (Fig. 9d) is formed in such photoactive systems which lead to high exciton diffusion lengths, higher mobilities, reduced bimolecular recombinations, all of which led to the highest single-junction OSCs with a PCE of 19.6%. A similar trend of high crystallinity and higher PCE than their binary counterparts has been observed in ternary OSCs, when Zhang et al. added highly crystalline eC9-2Cl NFA to the blend of PM6:L8-BO and the resulting OOP diffraction peak in the ternary film appeared at the same place as the neat eC9-2Cl and L8-BO (qz = 1.73 Å−1 corresponding to dπ–π of 3.63 Å), and the ternary blend containing 20% of eC9-2Cl NFA in PM6:L8-BO showed a PCE of 18.66%.76 In summary, it can be concluded from the GIWAXS analysis of the GB-processed OSCs that the best-performing OSC shows: (1) a stronger diffraction peak in the OOP direction, (2) has a reduced π–π stacking distance of nearly 3.6 Å, and (3) possesses a larger CCL.

Besides the morphology of the photoactive films of OSCs, the dynamics of the photoexcited states in efficient OSCs have also been studied in detail using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to gain insights into photophysical phenomenon occurring upon absorption of light. A pulse of light excites the sample, and the absorption is shown in the bleaching peak which may be associated with the formation of the excited state such as charge carriers, and based on the shape, intensity, and decay time of the bleaching peak, the dynamics of the excited states are assessed to fabricate OSCs with improved PCEs.77–80 Vezie et al. reported using TA spectroscopy in which the low offset between exciton and CT-state results in a lower non-radiative voltage loss and lower photocurrent generation, due to increased oscillation.81 Dong et al. also showed similar trends where CT-state lifetimes reduce when the energy loss is also reduced.82 Fig. 10a and b show the potential energy diagram of the singlet exciton and CT state with a low energy offset photoactive system.82 A system with a low offset between the singlet-state (S1) and CT-state (ΔECT–S1) tends to reach thermal equilibrium and results in higher VOC in low Eg-containing NFA-based OSCs, due to hybridization of the CT-states and S1 state of the low Eg NFA in the blend film.82

Karuthedath et al. studied a series of electron-donor polymers as well as smallmolecules, with their NFA combinations, keeping special emphasis on the relationship between ionization energy (IE) offset and their internal quantum efficiency (IQE), whereas charge carrier generation yields were extracted from TA spectroscopy.83 It was found that the difference between the IE offset value of around 0.5eV can yield a sufficient driving force for the exciton dissociation into the CT state and charge-separation, and finally to the efficient carrier extraction. Wang et al. employed femtosecond TA spectroscopy to determine the hole transfer dynamics in binary, ternary and quaternary BHJ films and obtained τ1 and τ2 from the bi-exponential fit corresponding to ultrafast exciton dissociation at the interface and diffusion of excitons towards the interface (q-BHJ: τ1 = 0.394 ± 0.027 ps and τ2 = 14.276 ± 0.80 ps, t-BHJ: τ1 = 0.515 ± 0.036 ps and τ2 = 17.685 ± 0.79 ps, and b-BHJ: τ1 = 0.720 ± 0.052 ps and τ2 = 20.121 ± 0.926 ps).84 It was found that the most efficient (q-BHJ) photoactive system showed the highest PCE of 17.71% in contrast to the ternary (17.33% PCE) or binary (16.71% PCE) systems. Cui et al. employed TA spectroscopy to measure the exciton lifetime and hole transfer (HT) processes in the binary PBQx-TF:eC9-2Cl and ternary PBQx-TF:eC9-2Cl:F-BTA photoactive systems.13 Ground state bleaching (GSB) at 580 nm showed that the binary blend has an exciton lifetime of 50 ps and the ternary has a shorter exciton lifetime of ∼10 ps which is helpful in enhanced electron transfer along with lower recombinations of excitons due to the formation of cascaded energy level alignment, while the hole transfer rates were found to be low due to relatively lower differences in their ionization potentials, but the overall charge transfer in the ternary film was faster for the ternary photoactive system. He et al. also employed fs-TA spectroscopy for the investigation of interfacial exciton dissociation (Fig. 11).38 In the blend film, followed by the decay of the acceptor peak at 855 nm, GSB of PM6 occurred at ∼640 nm and was assigned to the HT from NFA to PM6. Via the bi-exponential fitting of the PM6 GSB signal peak, τ1 = 0.236 ± 0.024 ps and τ2 = 6.55 ± 0.66 ps in PM6:BO-4Cl; τ1 = 0.315 ± 0.035 ps and τ2 = 23.19 ± 2.32 ps in PM6:BO-5Cl; and τ1 = 0.265 ± 0.027 ps and τ2 = 10.43 ± 1.04 ps for PM6:BO-4Cl:BO-5Cl blend film. The ternary blend showed fast exciton dissociation (τ1) with a long diffusion length (τ2) and gave exciton dissociation efficiencies of 95.8%, 89.4%, and 93.1% for PM6:BO-4Cl, PM6:BO-5Cl, and PM6:BO-4Cl:BO-5Cl, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the design of such NFAs is imminent where combinations with electron donor polymers result in enhanced exciton diffusion lengths and lifetimes, and which possess low ΔECT–S1 that result in enhanced VOC by lowering their nonradiative recombinations.

Air-processed organic solar cells
The above discussed PCEs, morphologies, molecular orientation and their packings, charge-generation dynamics, etc., all are from the photoactive films processed in GB. Almost all highest efficiency OSCs discussed above are processed from halogenated solvent systems.12–14,39,76,85 One of the main advantages of OSCs is their ease of production at a mass-scale employing already well-established industrial R2R coating methods. Since R2R coating is only possible in air, therefore, the use of halogenated solvent is almost impractical, keeping in mind that nearly 70% of GHG emissions already come from the energy sector via burning fossil fuels.86 Thus AP-OSCs are of more prime importance than highly efficient OSCs processed inside GB and from halogenated CF or CB solvents. However, AP-OSCs processed from halogen-free solvents lag behind GB-OSCs processed from halogenated solvent.
Zhang et al. employed a graded-BHJ approach where the first coated PM6 donor polymer layer (via blade-coating in a humidity-controlled environment) solidifies rather quickly and provided nucleation sites for the second BTP-eC9 NFA film to induce faster ordering of the NFA. This relatively faster crystallization process in the G-BHJ strategy inhibited excessive aggregation due to prolonged crystallization time in the case of BHJ-coated films. Using the G-BHJ approach, Zhang et al. were able to fabricate OSCs with 16.77% PCE from non-halogenated Xyl solvent in comparison to 15.87% PCE for BHJ film when coated via the BC-method.88 Rasool et al. also fabricated OSCs processed in open-air conditions via SC (GB and air) as well as BC (air), in an open-air environment without the use of the humidity-controlled environment and without using a hot stage for BC-OSCs.87 It was determined that when photoactive materials are processed in air, rather than PM6 donor polymer, Y6-hu NFA shows highly ordered and crystalline films with strong order in the OOP direction (Fig. 12a–c). Due to the difference in drying dynamics of the photoactive film in very-dry GB conditions versus relatively humid and O2-containing air-processing conditions, Y6-hu tends to show higher crystallinity which was observed in their pristine (Fig. 12a–c) as well as their blend films (Fig. 12d–f). Higher crystallinity from the Y6-hu NFA film resulted in higher RMS roughness of the air-processed films, 1.05 nm for SC-GB, 1.19 nm for SC-air, and 1.29 nm for BC-air blend films, and the CS-state efficiency for SC-GB and SC-air is also found to be similar, and as a result, SC-air OSCs showed a PCE of 17.38% while BC-air OSCs showed a PCE of 16.04%.87

To improve the PCE of AP-OSCs, Sun et al. used a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach to coat the PM6 donor polymer and NFA layer independently, rather than using a blend solution of PM6:Y6 (Fig. 13).89 The photoactive film coated via the LbL approach had higher absorption, and more importantly the LbL coated film had a higher absorption co-efficient in the NFA's absorption range, and more ordered Y6 NFA domains at the top of the blend film as assessed via GIWAXS at a shallow incident angle of 0.02°. In AP photoactive films, more NFAs were relatively accumulated at the top of the film while PM6 donor polymer accumulated at the bottom of the film which can be visualized in Fig. 13a and b. By carefully controlling the coating speed along with the substrate's temperature during the coating of NFA film, the final photoactive film with a more controlled morphology, excellent charge transport and extraction properties can be realized (Fig. 13b). As a result, small area AP-OSCs with 16.35% PCE were fabricated, whereas large-area OSC sub-module (schematics shown in Fig. 13c) with an outstanding PCE of 11.86% has been reported.89

Further exploring the advantages of the LbL coating technique, Sun et al. fabricated OSCs via an LbL-doctor-blade (LbL-DB) coating approach.90 It was found in their analysis that mainly the coating speed and the concentration of the photoactive solutions play the most important role towards the final PCE of the high efficiency photoactive system (Fig. 14a and b). The optimized AP-OSC coated via LbL-DB, using PM6 and T8 photoactive materials, resulted in an outstanding PCE of 17.98% in comparison to the 17.45% for BHJ solution coated via DB (BHJ-DB, Fig. 14a and b). Morphologically, the photoactive films coated via an LbL-DB approach showed homogenous film (the rms roughness for the film coated at a coating speed of 2.1 m min−1 was found to be 0.56 nm while it was 0.58 nm for the film coated at 30.0 m min−1), however BHJ-DB showed a relatively rougher surface (0.68 nm vs. 1.06 nm for films coated at 2.1 m min−1 and 30.0 m min−1, respectively) when the coating speed was enhanced. As shown in Fig. 14b, each solution with different concentration results in similar PCE even with an increased coating speed. Moreover, humidity also had negligible effects on the final PCE of the LbL-DB OSCs (Fig. 14c) resulting in >17.5% PCE in the 20-60% humidity possessing environment.90

Since the commercialization of the OSCs can be realized using fast R2R coating methods, which is a continuous yet rapid high-throughput industrial manufacturing process, the lab-scale manufacturing should also be tested under such rapid processing conditions, for which, work carried out by Sun et al. is of great importance.90 There are various coating methods available for the fabrication of AP-OSCs, among which the most common are doctor-blade (BD), slot-die (SD), and bar-coat (BC), all of which are much more efficient as compared to the robust spin-coating method. Although there are other printing methods for the coating of OSCs, such as flat-bed printing, rotary printing, flexoprinting, and gravure printing,91 however, DB or SD or BC are more efficient with the passage of time than their predecessors. In Table 2, the PCE of a few of the representative OSCs has been listed with respect to the photoactive area along with their coating method. It can be clearly observed that the PCE of the OSC sub-module decreases substantially once the photoactive area of the OSC sub-module is increased. Fan et al. reported a small-area (0.06 cm2) OSC with >17% PCE, while their OSC sub-module (19.30 cm2) showed 14.79% PCE (Table 2), and Rasool et al. also reported >17% PCE on a small area (0.13 cm2) while the OSC sub-module showed 12.44% PCE on a photoactive area of 31.50 cm2.87 However, Yoon et al. were able to achieve an outstanding PCE of 14.04% for their OSC sub-module with a photoactive area of 58.5 cm2, due to the uniform coating of the crystalline photoactive film achieved with the help of ternary component P(NDI2OD-T2).92 From these studies, it can be concluded that once the morphology of the photoactive film is controlled, equally efficient OSCs from the air can also be fabricated.

Outlook
Organic solar cells have shown potential for practical applications in our lives, such as in the integration of semitransparent OSCs onto greenhouse structures (Fig. 15a),113 indoor photovoltaics (Fig. 15b),114 water splitting (Fig. 15c),115 organic photodiodes (Fig. 15d),116 building-integrated photovoltaics,117 etc. Improvement in the BD or BC techniques, which are industrially feasible and preferable, is imminent. With currently available techniques, the PCEs of AP-OSCs have surpassed a 17% PCE barrier.88,90,95,98,118 If the same trend in enhancement in PCEs continues with novel coating methods, improvement in coating conditions, or the introduction of novel photoactive materials, then, the PCEs of the AP-OSCs can also reach as high as their GB-processed counterparts, i.e. ∼20%. Once this barrier is crossed, then the advantages of OSCs such as green-materials-based photoactive materials, low carbon footprint, solution processability, open-air R2R coating, flexible OSCs, semi-transparent OSCs, BIPVs, customizable organic electronics such as indoor low-light applications and internet-of-things, low LCOE, etc, could outweigh other inorganic solar cell technologies, provided that OSCs have high stability under continuous sunlight irradiation conditions. With PCEs of AP-OSCs (∼18%) reaching >90% of the best GB-OSC's PCEs (∼19.6%), improving the light-soaking stability of the OSCs has been a real hot potato for researchers, and it is a key factor in making OSCs competitive with inorganic solar cells. Nevertheless, for the fabrication of efficient AP-OSCs on a large-area scale, either new coating technologies (such as G-BHJ, LBL-DB) or optimizations of the processing conditions (such as controlling the concentration of the photoactive solutions, coating speed and the substrate temperature etc) are needed.

From the above discussions, the following can be concluded as the key requirements for the fabrication of efficient AP-OSCs (or GB-OSCs):
1. Custom-designed photoactive materials are imminent for the successful translation of efficient OSCs from lab-scale to R2R industrial scale. Such materials can be T8 NFA (which is a structurally modified version of Y6) possessing good solubility in halogenated (CF) or halogen-free (toluene) solvent and reproducibility due to their appropriate aggregations, or Y6hu NFA (structurally modified Y6) for their enhanced solubility in CF, CB, or o-Xyl to produce enhanced crystallinity when processed in air resulting in similar PCEs from a range of processing solvents (CF, CB, or O-Xyl),87 addition of ternary components (such as P(NDI2OD-T2) or highly crystalline D18 polymer) to regularize and reproducibly form crystalline domains, etc.12,92 Usually, such materials are more beneficial for large-area AP-OSCs which show good solubility in halogen-free solvents, while still possessing a reasonably high aggregation tendency.
2. Use of DFT calculations to compute physical properties to design molecular structures with beneficial properties such as desired HOMO–LUMO levels, twisted Y6-like molecular structures, and higher dipole or quadrupole moments containing photoactive materials for efficient transport of charges via their backbones.
3. From a morphological aspect, the following key aspects should be considered:
(a) The rms roughnesses of the photoactive films should not be too high (assessed via AFM analysis). Generally, highly crystalline donor polymers or NFAs result in overly aggregated regions, thereby enhancing the roughness of the photoactive film too much, which sometimes act as recombination centers, i.e. energy loss channels, and this should be avoided. Also, as compared to benchmark SC-photoactive films, the DB or BC photoactive films can result in higher roughness due to the difference in their drying procedure (almost immediate drying in the SC-method while in DB or BC methods, either photoactive films dry naturally or via the use of slightly hot substrate). Such photoactive materials or modified coating techniques or the conditions should be employed which do not result in overly aggregated photoactive regions with higher roughness.
(b) From blend morphology aspects as shown in TEM analysis, it can be safely said that a good photoactive blend film has a stronger fibril network with reasonable donor–acceptor phase separation. In PM6 and Y6 NFA type blend films, usually very high phase separation is not observed, however, the stronger fibril network and phase separation does help in enhanced light absorption and efficient charge-transport.
(c) GIWAXS analysis is one of the most important characterization tools, providing information related to polymer donor or NFA's stacking direction, dπ–π between the backbones of donor polymers or NFAs, and their extent of order in the specific direction obtained by the calculation of their CCL. From the analysis of the benchmark highly efficient GB-OSCs, it can be concluded that the final blend film should have a stronger π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction with enhanced CCL, as well as reduced dπ–π. Such AP-OSCs whose blend films have a similar dπ–π and reasonably higher crystallinity as compared to their pristine counterparts, results in outstanding PCEs and will be desirable.
4. From the device physics aspect, such photoactive systems should be designed which have low ΔECT–S1, allowing hybridization of CT and S1 states. This will in turn lower the non-radiative energy-loss channels (ΔVnr) in photoactive blend films, resulting in enhanced VOC. The ΔVnr can be reduced via designing NFAs with upshifted LUMO levels to better match with the donor polymer's LUMO level. Such NFAs, which have a high ECT and higher oscillator strength of the CT-states resulting in higher hybridization between the CT-state and S1 state, and possess high exciton diffusion lengths and exciton lifetimes will be of much more interest to fabricate AP-OSCs with improved photovoltaic parameters. Although the reduced ΔECT–S1 might result in lower photocurrents due to the absence of enough driving energy for the dissociation of CT-states into free carriers and their extraction, nonetheless, if the above mentioned properties in the NFAs are achieved, the OSCs can result in outstanding PCEs due to reduced ΔVnr, yet are comparable to inorganic solar cell's ΔVnr.
5. Keeping in view the techno-economic aspects of this class of energy harvesting technology, if efficient and stable AP-OSCs are coated rapidly, for instance the use of the LbL-DB method, AP-OSCs can compete with market-dominant inorganic technologies in terms of $ Wp−1 (power output per manufacturing hour in terms of $).90
6. Furthermore, it can be safely said that for the processing of efficient AP-OSCs, the final blend film should have similar morphological and packing features as these photoactive films show in GB-processed counterparts. The processing protocol for AP-OSCs from a commercialization aspect can be summarized as follows:
(a) UVO of the rigid/flexible ITO is carried out in air and it is common for GB-OSCs and AP-OSCs.
(b) Coating of the air-stable HTL (for conventional device architecture) or ETL (for inverted device architecture) should be and usually is carried out in air for GB-OSCs as well as AP-OSCs. However, the most important point to consider here is that the HTL or ETL in small area AP-OSCs should be coated while considering their compatibility with the R2R coating technique. Although coating a robust spin-coated HTL/ETL can lead to higher PCEs, however, if it is not compatible with large-area R2R coating techniques, these HTLs/ETLs are useless from a commercialization aspect.
(c) The most important part in GB-OSCs as well as AP-OSCs is the coating of the uniform photoactive film while keeping the fibril network intact along with their crystalline packing features in the OOP direction. Photoactive materials should be processable in halogen-free solvent systems to lower the environmental carbon footprint of such AP-OSCs. As the R2R coating is considered as a fast-coating technique, such photoactive films will be of much greater interest which show a thickness tolerance while maintaining their high PCE output. Also, most photoactive films need thermal annealing to show their optimum performance, which could enhance input energy to fabricate AP-OSCs. Therefore, annealing free photoactive films with thickness tolerance and higher crystallinity will be an ideal choice for the fabrication of efficient AP-OSCs.
(d) Coating of the top-electrode via thermal evaporation (in contrast to the current ongoing research where the top silver or aluminum electrode is thermally evaporated under high vacuum) is not compatible with continuous R2R coating techniques, therefore, special attention must be given to find and optimize R2R coatable top electrodes, such as the application of printable silver ink. Since this step can be optimized during the commercialization step, nevertheless, optimization of high-throughput R2R coatable HTL or ETL buffer layers for efficient extraction of charge-carriers will be preferrable. Also, it will be extremely challenging to control the thickness of the buffer layers down to a few nanometers range during R2R coating, therefore, these buffer layers should also show thickness tolerance while producing good charge transport.
(e) Finally, photoactive films should also possess robust morphology such that their performance does not degrade too much under light soaking conditions, and under thermal stress (variable temperatures during the day and night times). Photoactive materials should also have resistance against UV-light to stop photo-bleaching phenomenon. However, UV-filterable thin film over an AP-OSC sub-module can solve this photo-bleaching issue.
As shown in Fig. 16a, the PCEs of the AP-OSCs from halogen-free solvent systems has almost reached the PCE of OSCs processed from halogenated solvent, and the PCE of the OSC sub-modules has also reached reasonably high on a relatively larger area (Fig. 16b), therefore, it can be safely concluded that AP-OSCs can be commercialized in the near future.
