    , Accepted 9th May 2019First published on 10th May 2019AbstractLow-cost, robust counter electrodes (CEs) with merits of superior catalytic activity and long-term stability, and rapid electron/mass transport are highly desirable for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, FeS2/carbon hybrids on carbon cloth (FeS2/C@CC), in which FeS2 nanoparticles were embedded in a carbon shell, were fabricated using an in situ deposition–carbonization–sulfurization approach. The hybrid electrode can provide a rapid mass/electron transport rate at the electrolyte/electrode interface, revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscope measurements. Moreover, the in situ grown carbon shell not only guaranteed the tight adhesion of the hybrid catalysts to the substrate, but also contributed to the long-term stability and partly to the catalytic activity. As a result, the device with the FeS2/C@CC CE presented a power conversion efficiency of 8.15%, exceeding that of Pt (7.61%). The as-developed hybrid FeS2/C@CC electrode is a very promising candidate as a robust CE in DSCs. Meanwhile, the fabrication method could offer new opportunities in exploring high-performance catalysts for various energy-related applications.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been considered as one of the most promising photovoltaic devices due to their easy fabrication process, cost-effectiveness and relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–6 As is well-known, the PCE is dependent on each component of the device.7–9 High PCE has been achieved by using optimized dyes with suitable redox couples. Up to now, various redox couples, such as I3−/I−, Co2+/Co3+ and Cu+/Cu2+, have been widely utilized in DSCs.10–12 These redox couples regenerate the dyes absorbed on the photoanode, and need to be efficiently reduced on the counter electrode (CE). High conductivity and catalytic activity of redox couples are highly expected for CEs in DSCs. Pt metal has been the most successful candidate due to its high electrical conductivity with excellent catalytic activity towards various redox couples.4,13,14 However, high cost and poor stability towards redox couples limit its widespread application.4,5 Consequently, many efforts have been devoted to exploring low-cost, Pt-free materials for improving the performance of CEs.4,15–18
Transition metal sulfides are composed of elements that are abundant in nature, and thus have been intensely investigated in recent years due to their easy synthesis, satisfactory catalytic activity and excellent environmental friendliness.15,19 Pyrite iron disulfide, one of the transition metal sulfides, has been considered as a next-generation photovoltaic material candidate because of its narrow band gap and efficient optical absorption.20 Recently, pyrite iron disulfide with controllable morphologies, such as nanorods,21 nanosheets22 and nanocrystal inks,15 has also been synthesized and applied as CEs in DSCs. However, up to now, individual iron disulfide with catalytic activity exceeding that of Pt has seldom been reported. This is partly due to the low conductivity of transition metal sulfide, compared with metals.23 Mixing metal sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) with highly conductive materials to form nanocomposites (hybrids) could produce highly efficient catalysts for DSCs.24 Carbon-based materials, including graphene and mesoporous carbon, are the most popular catalyst materials for the oxygen25,26 and nitrogen reduction reactions,27,28 and hydrogen evolution reaction,29 owing to their intrinsic high conductivity and catalytic performance as well as chemical inertness against corrosive electrolytes.30,31 Therefore, carbon-based materials are the ideal partners to construct composite catalysts. In the hybrids, the high electrical conductivity of carbon can supplement the low conductivity of metal sulfides.24,32 Accordingly, polymer/ferrous sulfide nanoparticles and FeS2/reduced graphene oxide composites have been synthesized by heating mixtures of metal salt and carbon precursors.33 However, the resultant catalysts were usually of poor quality in terms of both uniformity and homogeneity of the composite structures. Additionally, the as-prepared catalysts were generally deposited on the substrate via two types of methods to construct the counter electrode.16 One involves directly depositing the as-prepared catalysts on the substrate;34 the other involves depositing the catalyst slurry.12 In the case of the former method, only a very thin catalyst layer could be obtained due to poor adhesion among nanoparticles.35 The resultant thin catalyst layer cannot provide enough catalytic sites for reactions. To increase the thickness of the catalyst layer, the catalysts could first be made into slurries. Slurries are prepared by mixing catalysts with a pore-forming agent and high viscosity solvent.36 However, the diffusion and mass transfer of redox couples will be impeded as the catalyst layer becomes thick, which limits improvement in catalytic activity.37 Additionally, adhesion between the catalysts and conductive substrate need to be further enhanced. Therefore, it is highly imperative to explore efficient and stable CEs based on non-noble and earth-abundant elements for mass production in DSCs. Meanwhile, simple fabrication methods are highly desirable for metal-sulfide/carbon hybrid CEs.
Herein, we report an easy approach for in situ preparation of FeS2/carbon hybrids tightly anchored on a carbon cloth (CC) substrate, and their application as highly efficient catalysts for I3−/I− in DSCs. CC replaced the high-price FTO glass due to its low cost and high conductivity, and it could also provide a 3D porous skeleton for rapid mass/electron transport.38,39 The Fe-complex was firstly synthesized using a wet-chemical method, and it was deposited on CC using a dipping technique. After the subsequent carbonization–sulfurization process, the FeS2 NPs possessed a high surface area. Simultaneously, the as-obtained carbon shell coating on the FeS2 NPs guaranteed high conductivity, tight adhesion to the substrate, and good protection of FeS2 against erosion as well as partial contribution to catalytic activity. As a result, the as-designed FeS2/carbon hybrids presented better stability and photovoltaic efficiency (8.15%) than its thermally deposited Pt counterpart (7.61%).
Experimental
Chemical reagents
Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) was purchased from Aladdin, and sodium oleate (NaOL) was purchased from Macklin. Sulfur powder was purchased from Xilong Chemical Co. Chemical reagents were of analytical grade, and all reagents were utilized directly without further purification.
Synthesis of the ferric oleate (FeOL) precursor
In a typical synthesis process, FeCl3·6H2O (0.36 g, 1.33 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (2 mL), and then mixed with sodium oleate (4 mmol, 1.22 g) solution dissolved in 20 mL of hexane.40 The mixed solution was aged at 85 °C for 3 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature. The as-obtained viscous liquid, FeOL, was then diluted with chloroform (10 mL) and kept for further use.
Preparation of Fe2O3/C@CC, FeOxSy/C@CC, FeS2/C@CC and FeS2@CC electrodes
The carbon cloth substrate (1 cm × 2 cm) was firstly cleaned using acetone and deionized water for 20 minutes, respectively. To deposit FeOL on its surface, the cleaned CC was subsequently immersed into the 0.13 M FeOL solution for 10 minutes. After that, it was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 hours. Finally, the FeOL@CC was heated at 600 °C for 3 hours under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The product was washed with DI water and ethanol, respectively, and dried at 60 °C for 6 hours. Fe2O3 NPs encapsulated in the carbon shell supported on CC (Fe2O3/C@CC) were obtained. The FeOxSy/C@CC and FeS2/C@CC samples were prepared by sulfurization treatment of Fe2O3/C@CC with different amounts of sulfur powders, respectively. The sulfur powder was placed upstream of the porcelain boat, while the Fe2O3/C@CC was located downstream. The samples were heated at 500 °C for 2 hours at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The Fe2O3 NPs were transformed into FeOxSy or FeS2 NPs by the sulfurization process. As a control electrode, the FeS2@CC sample was also prepared. The preparation processes were similar to those for the FeS2/C@CC electrode, only replacing FeOL with FeCl3 solution. Fe3+ ions were changed to FeS2 NPs after the sulfurization process. Only FeS2 NPs were deposited on CC in this case, denoted as the FeS2@CC electrode.
Fabrication of DSC devices
N719-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by a conventional method according to previous reports.41,42 The device had a sandwich-type configuration with an N719-sensitized TiO2 electrode, a counter electrode and liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte was 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.6 M dimethylpropyl imidazolium iodide and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The various as-prepared electrodes and Pt were used as CEs in the devices.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of all the as-obtained materials were carried out with a Bruker AXS D8-Advanced X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The standard XRD patterns of γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS PDF#39-1346) and FeS2 (JCPDS PDF#42-1340) were used as the references. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F, JEOL) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The thickness of the FeS2/C layer on the substrate was estimated using SEM characterization. The size and shape of the as-prepared samples were analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1200EX, JEOL) at 100 kV. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). All of the spectra were calibrated to the binding energy of the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The surface potential of catalysts was measured using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM, Asylum Research MFP-3D Infinity), and KPFM measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere, employing a FTO electrode as the reference electrode. The samples were prepared on a FTO substrate.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system using the as-prepared electrode as a working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode. The CV measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instrument, Inc.) with a scan rate of 75 mV s−1. The electrolyte was 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile solution. Furthermore, the stability of the samples was estimated with 50 cycles of CV measurement. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the different electrodes was conducted using an electrochemical system (Solartron 1255B and SI1287) at 0 V with a frequency from 10 mHz to 10 kHz and a potential modulation of 10 mV. Symmetrical dummy cells assembled with two identical electrodes filled with the same electrolyte as used in the DSC were applied for the EIS measurement. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the dye-sensitized solar cells were recorded with a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si reference cell (Oriel Newport PN91150V). The active area of the solar cell was 0.25 cm2 with a metal mask.
Results and discussion
The synthetic procedure, which involves in situ deposition, carbonization and sulfurization steps, and a photograph of the FeS2/C@CC sample are shown in Scheme 1. The ferric oleate (FeOL) was firstly prepared according to a previously reported approach using FeCl3 and sodium oleate as starting materials,40 which were utilized as the precursors of both Fe and C elements. Carbon cloth (CC), a self-supporting and well-conducting electrode, was used as the 3D substrate, possessing the merits of light weight, high conductivity and high surface area.38 The FeOL was uniformly assembled on the surface of CC to fabricate the FeOL@CC electrode by immersing CC into the precursor solution for 10 minutes. Then, the FeOL@CC sample was heated under a N2 atmosphere at 600 °C for 3 hours to produce the Fe2O3/C@CC composite. During the carbonization process, the as-prepared FeOL layer was in situ converted into Fe2O3/carbon hybrids on CC. The Fe2O3 NPs were encapsulated by a thin carbon layer. The thin carbon layer was derived from the capping ligands around the FeOL NPs. The resultant carbon shells will guarantee that the NPs tightly adhere on the substrate. Finally, the Fe2O3/C@CC was further treated with sulfur powder in a furnace at 500 °C under a N2 atmosphere, and the Fe2O3 NPs reacted with S and changed to FeS2/C hybrids on CC. Moreover, different degrees of sulfurization were easily achieved by varying the amount of sulfur powder (50, 30 and 10 mg) used in the study. Consequently, various electrodes, including FeS2/C@CC and FeOxSy/C@CC, could easily be synthesized via the combination of in situ deposition, carbonization and sulfurization treatments.

The morphology of the sample in each step was firstly observed using SEM. After successful deposition of Fe2O3/C NPs on the substrate, the surface of the substrate became rough (Fig. 1a), compared with bare CC containing a smooth surface (Fig. S1a†). Moreover, lots of NPs could be easily observed on the substrate, and those particles were stacked together (Fig. 1a and S1b†). Furthermore, after the sulfurization process, no obvious changes in the morphologies were observed (Fig. 1a and b). However, the concentration of FeOL precursors can have a large influence on the morphologies of samples, revealed by the TEM images in Fig. S2.† As a result, the optimized concentration of the FeOL precursor was 0.13 M. The thickness of the as-obtained FeS2/C layer was about 80 nm on the CC substrate. Furthermore, elemental distribution of the catalyst on the substrate was characterized via elemental mapping analysis, indicating good dispersion of NPs on the CC (Fig. 1c). The results also implied high loading of catalysts on CC. Obviously, Fe and S elements were found on the substrate, and the NPs mainly consisted of Fe and S elements. More importantly, the elemental mapping results also demonstrated the successful conversion of Fe2O3 to FeS2via the facile sulfurization method. Some O element was also observed due to the exposure to the air atmosphere. The content of oxygen and composition of the final sample were certainly determined by the amount of sulfur used in the sulfurization process.

The obtained XRD patterns confirmed the formation of Fe2O3 and FeS2 in the synthesis process. As shown in Fig. 1d, the two peaks at 25.6° and 43.6° can be attributed to the (002) and (102) diffraction planes of the CC substrate. The peaks at 30.2°, 35.6°, 43.3°, 53.7°, 57.3°, and 62.9° were assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) diffraction planes of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3, JCPDS PDF#39-1346), indicating that the FeOL on CC was completely converted into γ-Fe2O3@CC. The formation of γ-Fe2O3 NPs embedded in a thin carbon shell (γ-Fe2O3/C) resulted from the carbonization of the FeOL precursor and capping ligands under an inert atmosphere. After the following sulfurization treatment, new peaks were clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 1d. The newly formed sharp peaks demonstrated good crystallinity and the peaks at 28.5°, 33.1°, 37.1°, 40.8°, 47.4°, and 56.3° can be well indexed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (311) planes of pyrite (FeS2, JCPDS PDF#42-1340). Obviously, the amount of S powder used in the study determined the composition of the final sample. The proportion of FeS2 increased and the proportion of γ-Fe2O3 decreased when the amount of S was increased during the sulfurization step. In the case of insufficient sulfurization treatment, such as 10 and 30 mg S, the γ-Fe2O3 phase and FeS2 phase coexisted in the FeOxSy/C@CC sample. However, the amount of S showed few effects on the morphologies of the as-prepared hybrids on the CC substrate (Fig. S1c and d†).
The morphologies and crystal structures of the samples were further characterized by TEM and HRTEM. Fe2O3/C and FeS2/C hybrids were peeled off from CC prior to characterization. Fig. 2a and b show the typical morphology of the as-prepared hybrids. NPs are marked with a white dashed circle, and they were encapsulated by a thin carbon layer, marked with a yellow dashed circle. The typical HRTEM images for Fe2O3/C and FeS2/C hybrids are shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. The clear lattice fringes indicated high crystallinity for the two samples. The corresponding lattice space was calculated to be 0.254 and 0.268 nm, assigned to the (311) crystal plane of Fe2O3 and the (200) crystal plane of FeS2, respectively. The results of both XRD and HRTEM demonstrated that γ-Fe2O3 could be easily converted into FeS2via the sulfurization method. Moreover, the heating rate and carbonization temperature could greatly affect the size of nanoparticles as well as the size distribution on the CC substrate, and thus the catalytic activities of the final samples toward I3− reduction. Based on the results shown in Fig. S3 and S4,† the heating rate and temperature of the carbonization step were set to 10 °C min−1 and 600 °C, respectively.

Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to evaluate the composition of the samples. Fig. 3 shows the typical high resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p, O 1s and S 2p. Fe and O elements were detected in the Fe2O3/C@CC sample (Fig. 3a and b), while S and Fe elements were detected in the FeS2/C@CC sample (Fig. 3c and d). Noticeably, the peaks located at 725.0 eV and 711.4 eV can be associated with the characteristic signal of Fe 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, the two broad peaks at 734.2 eV and 718.6 eV are attributed to satellite peaks of Fe.43 The peak of Fe 2p3/2 could be divided into three peaks at binding energies of 712.9, 711.3 and 710.3 eV, respectively. These three peaks indicated the presence of the Fe–O bond. Meanwhile, the O 1s spectra could be fitted well using four peaks located at 533.4 (C–O–C), 531.7 (CO), 530.2 (C–O–Fe) and 529.6 eV (Fe–O) (Fig. 3b).43 These results also confirmed the formation of Fe2O3 in the sample. After the sulfurization treatment, typical peaks were obtained for S and Fe elements and they are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. The two predominant peaks at binding energies of 724.0 and 710.8 eV were assigned to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively. The Fe 2p spectra could be fitted well with peaks located at 709.5 (Fe(III)–S), 711.0 (Fe(III)–S), 706.9 (Fe(II)–S) and 715.7 eV (Fe(II)–S).44 The corresponding S 2p peak can be divided into four peaks, located at binding energies of 168.7, 164.5, 163.5 and 162.5 eV, corresponding to the SO42− group, the C–S–C bond, and Sn2− and pyrite persulfide S–S2− groups, respectively.44 More importantly, no obvious peaks from iron oxides were detected, implying conversion of iron oxides to iron sulfides. According to these results, FeS2/C hybrids were successfully grown on the CC substrate.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was firstly carried out to examine the catalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared electrodes towards the tri-iodide reduction reaction. Two pairs of reduction and oxidation peaks were observed for all electrodes within the scanning range, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The negative pair of peaks is ascribed to the reduction of I3− to I− and oxidation of I− to I3−. The reduction peak is the analysis focus of CV measurement because the I3− ions must be effectively reduced to I− ions on the counter electrode.17 The separation of cathodic and anodic peak potentials (ΔEpp) and the current density of the reduction peak are the two key parameters for the assessment of the catalytic activity. Obviously, both the current density of the reduction peak and the ΔEpp varied greatly for various electrodes. The estimated ΔEpp for each electrode is summarized in Table 1. The ΔEpp values for CC, Fe2O3/C@CC, and FeOxSy/C@CC electrodes were 0.880, 0.779 and 0.715 V, respectively. Apparently, after the incorporation of various catalysts on the CC substrate, ΔEpp decreased significantly. More importantly, after complete sulfurization treatment, ΔEpp for FeS2/C@CC decreased to 0.392 V, smaller than that for the Pt electrode (0.449 V), demonstrating that FeS2/C hybrids could be efficient catalysts for the triiodide reduction reaction. The ΔEpp decrement indicates that tri-iodide ions are quite readily reduced on the FeS2/C@CC electrode, and that the reduction reaction occurs slightly more easily on the FeS2/C@CC electrode.19 Moreover, the current density of the reduction peak (Jc) for electrodes increased in the order of CC < Pt < Fe2O3/C@CC < FeOxSy/C@CC < FeS2/C@CC, which implies that the I3− reduction reaction performance was improved after the decoration of the CC substrate with various catalysts. A large Jc is desirable for counter electrodes, and it could lead to a large photocurrent density of the solar cell.31 To evaluate the function of the thin carbon layer embedding the FeS2 NPs, a control electrode, FeS2@CC, was also prepared. The CC was firstly dipped into the FeCl3 solution to absorb Fe3+ ions, and then carbonized, and further reacted with S under a N2 atmosphere to convert Fe2O3 to FeS2 NPs. The changes were confirmed using XRD measurement (Fig. S5†). The as-prepared FeS2@CC electrode presented a small ΔEpp (0.539 V) as that observed for the FeS2/C@CC electrode in the CV plot. This was ascribed to the good catalytic activity of the FeS2 catalyst towards the I3− reduction reaction.19 Nevertheless, its current density was very low, compared with the electrode derived from the FeOL precursor. The small Jc was due to low loading of the catalyst (FeS2) on CC, confirmed by its SEM images (Fig. S6†).

Furthermore, the long-term stability is also a key parameter for an efficient counter electrode. The FeS2@CC, FeS2/C@CC and Pt electrodes were chosen for the stability test. The electrochemical stability of the electrodes towards the I3− reduction reaction was tested by CV with 50 cycles in the scanning range from −0.6 to 1.3 V. The typical CV plots are shown in Fig. S7.† The normalized changes in Jc for each electrode are presented in Fig. 4c. The final Jc of the Pt electrode was 89% of its initial value. On the other hand, in the case of the FeS2/C@CC electrode, the final Jc was up to 92% of its initial value, indicating that the FeS2/C@CC electrode possessed better stability than the Pt electrode. Moreover, the morphology and composition of the FeS2/C@CC electrode after the CV test were also measured. As shown in Fig. S8a and b,† no obvious changes in morphology and composition were observed. These results also confirmed the good stability of the FeS2/C@CC electrode towards the electrolyte. However, the FeS2@CC electrode showed poor stability (Jc of 66%). The CV results demonstrated that the as-obtained carbon layer around the FeS2 NPs contributed to both the catalytic activity and the stability.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) represents the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface.9,19,42,45,46 Thus, EIS for the different electrodes was also conducted using symmetrical cells to investigate the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces toward I3− reduction. Symmetrical dummy cells assembled with two identical electrodes filled with the same electrolyte as used in the DSC were applied for the EIS measurement. The obtained Nyquist plots for the different electrodes are presented in Fig. 4d. The Nyquist plots were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4d,45 and the solid curves represent the fitted data. The fitted values of Rct for CC, Fe2O3/C@CC, FeOxSy/C@CC, FeS2/C@CC and Pt electrodes are 1.57, 1.11, 0.71, 0.47 and 0.58 Ω cm−2, respectively. Compared with the blank CC electrode, the hybrid electrodes presented small values of Rct. Furthermore, the Rct became smaller with the following sulfurization process. Consequently, the FeS2/C@CC electrode showed a smaller Rct than that for the Pt electrode, which confirms that the catalytic activity of FeS2/C@CC could be comparable to that of the Pt electrode toward triiodide reduction in DSCs. The results are consistent with the results of CV measurement.
The above-mentioned CV and EIS results imply that the as-developed hybrid catalysts could work well as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells. Consequently, DSCs were assembled with these electrodes. The photocurrent density vs. applied potential characteristic plots measured from those devices are shown in Fig. 5a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices is dependent on the CEs. The bare CC electrode presented the lowest PCE of 4.48%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.695 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.573. After the deposition of catalysts on the substrate, the parameters were greatly enhanced. Notably, the PCE apparently increased as the Fe2O3 nanocrystals changed to FeS2 NPs by the sulfurization treatment step. The sulfurization process definitely resulted in the improvement of Jsc and FF, and thus PCE. The PCE for the devices with different catalysts on CC increased in the order of Fe2O3/C (6.27%) < FeOxSy/C (6.80%) < FeS2/C (8.15%). More importantly, the PCE of the FeS2/C@CC-based device is higher than that of the Pt-based device (7.61%). The large PCE of the FeS2/C@CC-based device resulted from its large Jsc and FF, compared with the other devices. The high FF could be ascribed to the fast mass/electron transfer in the case of the FeS2/C@CC electrode, revealed by the EIS measurement. The changes in Jsc for the various devices are also in good agreement with results of CV measurements.

The FeS2/C hybrid-based device showed a high efficiency (8.15%) compared with the Fe2O3/C hybrid-based device (6.27%). To clarify this, the surface potential of the Fe2O3/C and FeS2/C catalysts was further measured using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM).4,47 The surface potential of the catalysts was measured to illustrate the electron transport processes between the I3−/I− redox couple and catalysts on the CEs. As shown in Fig. 5b, the FeS2/C hybrid had a surface potential of −5.46 eV, which matches better the potential of the I3−/I− redox couple (−4.90 eV), compared with −5.60 eV for the Fe2O3/C hybrid. Generally, a suitable surface potential results in a moderate energy level matching, which will promote fast electron transfer across the interface between the catalysts and the I3−/I− redox couple.4,47 This meant that the device based on FeS2/C@CC presented higher efficiency than the Fe2O3/C@CC-based device. Additionally, in the case of the device containing the FeS2@CC CE, its PCE (6.10%) was much lower than that for the FeS2/C@CC-based device. The high PCE was attributed to FeS2/C hybrids containing a structure of carbon shell surrounding FeS2 NPs. The simultaneously obtained carbon layer will not only contribute to the stability, revealed by CV tests, but also to the enhancement in PCE. The results demonstrate that FeS2/C hybrids could be a promising alternative as low-cost Pt-free catalysts in DSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, FeS2/C hybrid catalysts were successfully prepared and tightly anchored on carbon cloth, derived from the successive carbonization and sulfurization of an FeOL precursor on the substrate. The as-prepared FeS2/C@CC showed higher efficiency and better long-term stability than its Pt counterpart. The enhanced efficiency could be ascribed to the intrinsic catalytic activity of FeS2/C NPs (a small Rct and suitable surface potential matching well with the redox couple), high surface area and rapid mass transport provided by the hybrid CE. The improved long-term stability resulted from the thin carbon layer coating, largely protecting catalysts against erosion. These results demonstrate that the as-designed FeS2/C composite could be a promising alternative as a low-cost, Pt-free catalyst for highly efficient DSCs. The fabrication approach reported here could be suitable for exploring highly efficient catalysts in various electrochemical energy-related applications.
