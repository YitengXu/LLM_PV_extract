    , Accepted 6th October 2010First published on 10th December 2010AbstractThis critical review discusses specific preparation and characterization methods applied to hybrid materials consisting of π-conjugated polymers (or oligomers) and semiconductor nanocrystals. These materials are of great importance in the quickly growing field of hybrid organic/inorganic electronics since they can serve as active components of photovoltaic cells, light emitting diodes, photodetectors and other devices. The electronic energy levels of the organic and inorganic components of the hybrid can be tuned individually and thin hybrid films can be processed using low cost solution based techniques. However, the interface between the hybrid components and the morphology of the hybrid directly influences the generation, separation and transport of charge carriers and those parameters are not easy to control. Therefore a large variety of different approaches for assembling the building blocks—conjugated polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals—has been developed. They range from their simple blending through various grafting procedures to methods exploiting specific non-covalent interactions between both components, induced by their tailor-made functionalization. In the first part of this review, we discuss the preparation of the building blocks (nanocrystals and polymers) and the strategies for their assembly into hybrid materials' thin films. In the second part, we focus on the charge carriers' generation and their transport within the hybrids. Finally, we summarize the performances of solar cells using conjugated polymer/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrids and give perspectives for future developments.Peter ReissPeter Reiss graduated from the University of Karlsruhe (TH), Germany, in 1997 and received the PhD degree (under the supervision of Dieter Fenske) from the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry in 2000.

1 Introduction
The fields of conjugated polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals had been developing in parallel, with little overlap and interactions, till the early 1990s. At that time, the publication of the famous paper of Burroughes et al.1 on the electroluminescence of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) triggered an enormous interest in organic electronics. In the same period a significant progress was made in the preparation of semiconductor nanocrystals of controlled and tunable electronic and spectroscopic properties.2 Very quickly it turned out that a combination of these two components may lead to nanocomposites whose properties are unmatched by conventional materials.3 Since then, several applications of these new hybrid materials in various domains of electronics were developed, for example as active layers in light emitting diodes, photodiodes, and photovoltaic cells, to name a few. In essentially all applications described here conjugated polymers are used in their undoped i.e. semiconducting form. They can also be used in their doped (conducting) form, for example as components of electrodes or hole transporting layers but these applications are beyond the scope of this article. Recently, a few specific reviews have been published on the preparation of conjugated polymer/nanocrystals hybrid materials.4–7 More general reviews on the synthetic and processing strategies used for the incorporation of these nanoparticles into polymer matrices of various types were also published.8–10
To specify the object of this critical review it is helpful to give the broadest definition of a hybrid since different (and sometimes contradictory) definitions of this term are found in the literature. In the context of this article, a “hybrid” is defined as the association of at least two components of distinctly different chemical nature, whose molecular level distribution is achieved either by simple mixing or by linking both components together via specific interactions. These can involve the formation of covalent, coordination, ionic or hydrogen bonds. Each hybrid component possesses its chemical identity and can exist independently of the hybrid.
In conjugated polymers their processability and principal physicochemical properties can be tuned, in a wide range, by their pre- or post-polymerization functionalisation, controlling their macromolecular parameters and inducing appropriate supramolecular organization. In the case of nanocrystals, these properties can be modified—due to quantum confinement—not only by changing their size, but also by varying the shape, composition and surface ligands. Thus, in hybrids discussed here the properties of their constituents can be tuned individually and adapted to each other. This particularly applies to the positions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which determine their electronic, redox and luminescent properties. Therefore, conjugated polymers/nanocrystals hybrids can hardly be equaled by other systems as far as the design flexibility is concerned.
The organization of this article is as follows:
The first section reviews the progress in the chemical synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals. Concerning their specific properties, and in particular the photophysical ones, the interested reader is referred to excellent reviews on this subject.11–15 In addition to the description of binary II–VI (for example CdSe, CdS, CdTe, ZnSe), III–V (InP, InAs) and IV–VI (PbS, PbSe, PbTe) semiconductor nanocrystals, we will also discuss recent examples of ternary and quaternary compounds. The surface functionalization of nanocrystals in view of their use in hybrid materials for (opto-)electronic devices will be presented next. The second section introduces the most important families of n- and p-type semiconducting polymers, their synthesis and electronic properties. Based on these organic and inorganic semiconductors, the third section focuses the preparation of organic/inorganic hybrid materials. We are attempting to categorize the large number of different chemistry and processing approaches into a few general strategies. The characterization of the physicochemical properties of the hybrids is added to this section, with special emphasis on (spectro-)electrochemical techniques. The following, extensive section is dedicated to the description of methods used for the study of the electronic and transport properties of hybrid materials, illustrated with a large number of recent examples. Finally, in the last section the device characteristics of hybrid solar cells will briefly be reviewed and compared to other types of photovoltaic devices.
2 Chemical synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals
A number of recent reviews deal in detail with the synthesis and physical properties of nanocrystals.16–20 Therefore this section aims at giving a brief, systematic overview of the different applied synthesis strategies for a large variety of materials. We include in particular novel types of ternary and quaternary semiconductor nanocrystals, such as chalcopyrite (CuInE2, E = S, Se) and stannite (Cu2ZnSnE4, E = S, Se) derivates. These compounds currently draw strongly increasing attention due to their low band gap (Eg,bulk ≤ 1.5 eV) and the absence of toxic heavy metals, such as Cd, Pb or Hg.
2.1 Classification of the synthetic approaches
We are dividing the solution phase or “wet-chemical” methods for synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals into three categories, depending on the used reaction medium: (i) room temperature methods in aqueous media, either in the presence of stabilizers or within inverse micelles; (ii) reactions at elevated temperatures in organic solvents of hydrophobic or amphiphilic nature; (iii) synthesis at the oil–water interface. A variant of method (ii) is the solvothermal synthesis, which relies on high autogenous pressures afforded in a sealed autoclave by heating the solvents above their boiling point. This method has been so far of particular interest for the synthesis of group III nitride nanocrystals, whose preparation by conventional methods at standard pressure has not yet been achieved.21–25 Among other reaction media, not discussed here, ionic liquids26 and supercritical fluids27 have been proposed. For a comprehensive review of recent advances in the field of wet-chemical synthesis of inorganic nanostructures the reader is referred to ref. 28.
Historically the synthesis in aqueous media was the first successful preparation method of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. Nanocrystals formation takes place in homogenous aqueous solutions containing appropriate stabilizers of surfactant- or polymer-type.29,30 The latter bind to the NC surface and stabilize the particles by steric hindrance and/or electrostatic repulsion. In parallel to this monophase synthesis, a bi-phase technique has been developed, which is based on the arrested precipitation of nanocrystals within inverse micelles.31–34 Here nanometre-sized water droplets (dispersed phase) are stabilized in an organic solvent (continuous phase) by an amphiphilic surfactant. They serve as nano-reactors for the NC growth and prevent at the same time from particle agglomeration. Both methods provide relatively simple experimental approaches using standard reagents as well as room temperature reactions and were of great importance for the development of NC synthesis. Furthermore, for some materials (e.g.mercury chalcogenides,35–38iron sulfide39) aqueous synthesis is either the only or at least the best preparation method reported to date. On the other hand, the samples prepared by these synthetic routes usually exhibit size dispersions σ on the order of 15% or more and therefore post-synthetic size fractionation procedures have to be applied, such as size-selective precipitation. More recently, Li and coworkers reported another bi-phase preparation method, also called liquid–solid–solution (LSS) method.40 Here metal and chalcogenide precursors are reacted in an ethanol/water mixture in the presence of fatty acid stabilizers.41 In addition to transition metal sulfide and selenide semiconductor nanocrystals, this process has been successfully applied to noble metal, magnetic and oxide nanoparticles.42
In 1993 a novel high temperature synthesis method in organic solvents yielded nearly monodiserse (σ < 10%) CdS, CdSe and CdTe nanocrystals without size fractionation.2 As demonstrated in classical studies by LaMer and Dinegar,43 the synthesis of monodisperse colloids via homogeneous nucleation requires a temporal separation of nucleation and growth of the seeds. Initially the concentration of monomers, i.e. the minimum subunits of the crystal, constantly increases by their addition from exterior or by in situ generation within the reaction medium. It should be noted that in this stage no nucleation occurs even in supersaturated solution, due to the extremely high energy barrier for spontaneous homogeneous nucleation. The latter is overcome for a yet higher degree of supersaturation (S > Sc), where nucleation and formation of stable nuclei take place. As the rate of monomer consumption induced by the nucleation and growth processes exceeds the rate of monomer supply, the monomer concentration and hence the supersaturation decrease below Sc, the level at which the nucleation rate becomes zero. In the following stage, the particle growth continues under further monomer consumption as long as the system is in the supersaturated regime.
2.2 Overview of the synthesis methods used for different materials
Experimentally, the separation of nucleation and growth can be achieved by rapid injection of the reagents into the hot solvent, which raises the precursor concentration in the reaction flask above the nucleation threshold (“hot-injection method”).44 The hot injection leads to an instantaneous nucleation, which is quickly quenched by the fast cooling of the reaction mixture (the solution to be injected is generally at room temperature) and by the decreased supersaturation after the nucleation burst. Another possibility relies on attaining the degree of supersaturation necessary for homogeneous nucleation by the in situ formation of reactive species upon supply of thermal energy (“heating-up method”).17 This method is widely used in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, but recently an increasing number of examples of semiconductor nanocrystals prepared by this approach can be found. Obviously avoiding the delicate injection step leads to considerable simplification and increased reproducibility of the synthesis.
An example is the straightforward synthesis of Cu2S and other transition metal sulfide nanocrystals by heating the metal oleate complex in a solvent mixture of oleylamine and dodecanethiol.45 The size of the Cu2S nanocrystals could be tuned from 7 to 20 nm by changing the amount of dodecanethiol and the reaction temperature, while preserving an excellent monodispersity (Fig. 1). Table 1 gives a (non-exhaustive) overview of the applied methods as well as of the combinations of precursors, stabilizers and solvents used in the syntheses of various semiconductor nanocrystals in organic solvents.

In an ideal case all crystallization nuclei are created at the same time and undergo identical growth. During the growth stage it is possible to carry out subsequent injections of precursors in order to increase the mean particle size without deterioration of the narrow size distribution as long as the concentration corresponding to the critical supersaturation Sc is not exceeded. Crystal growth from solution is in many cases followed by a second growth process, Ostwald ripening.106 It consists of the dissolution of the smallest particles because of their high surface energy and the subsequent redeposition of the dissolved matter onto the bigger ones. Thereby the total number of nanocrystals decreases, whereas their mean size increases. Ostwald ripening can lead to reduced size dispersions of micrometre-sized colloids. In the case of nanometre-sized particles, however, Ostwald ripening generally yields size dispersions on the order of 15–20%,19 and therefore the reaction should be stopped before this stage. Using the hot-injection or heating-up synthesis methods, it is possible to obtain samples with 5–10% standard deviation from the mean size without post-preparative size fractionation.
For the application of nanocrystals in solar cells and photodetectors the absorption of light up to wavelengths in the (near) infrared spectral range is highly desirable. Therefore the research on narrow band gap semiconductors has been boosted during recent years. Lead chalcogenides have been intensively studied, with particular interest in PbS and PbSe. On the other hand, a number of binary, ternary and quaternary transition metal sulfides and selenides are being investigated (cf.Table 1). Most approaches are based on the combination of 1-octadecene (ODE), used as a solvent, and oleylamine (OAm), used as a stabilizing ligand, while different kinds of metal, sulfur and selenium precursors are explored under varying reaction conditions. In the case of the ternary and quaternary compounds, in addition to the size and shape, the composition of the nanocrystals has to be controlled as the latter strongly influences their electronic properties.
2.3 Nanocrystals' surface ligands exchange
Nanocrystals' surface ligands have several roles. During synthesis, they control the balance between nucleation and growth by regulating the reactivity of the precursors. Furthermore, they assure colloidal stability through steric repulsion (synthesis in organics) or electrostatic repulsion (synthesis in water). As far as nanocrystals' photoluminescence is concerned, surface ligands play an important role in the passivation of surface trap states. The latter provide non-radiative relaxation channels, which are competing with radiative recombination. In some examples, even the ubiquitous “blinking phenomenon”—i.e. the fluorescence intermittency of nanocrystals triggered by photo-induced charging—can be suppressed by judicious choice of the surface ligands.107 In the case of hybrids, surface ligands should provide solubility to the nanocrystals in a common solvent with the desired conjugated polymer. At the same time, they should enable charge transfer between both constituents. It is obvious that it is hardly impossible to find ligands, which meet all the requirements in the different steps of fabrication and use of hybrids. Nevertheless we will see some approaches in Section 4 where the initial surface ligands could be kept during hybrid preparation. However, in the overwhelming majority of cases, ligand exchange is carried out in a post-synthetic step. A large number of synthesis methods rely on the reaction of inorganic or organometallic complexes in organic solvents (cf.Table 1). Steric stabilization, used in these procedures, requires rather bulky ligands with long alkyl chains. These act, however, as an insulating barrier for charge transfer. Therefore, right from the earliest reports on hybrids, ligand exchange with different kinds of “small” molecules has been carried out. In the case of solution phase ligand exchange, the new molecules generally contain an anchoring group for the nanocrystal surface, i.e. a chemical function capable of forming a covalent or coordination bond with nanocrystals' surface atoms. Pyridine is the most prominent example for this strategy. Surface treatment of cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals with pyridine before blending with conjugated polymers led to strongly improved performance of the obtained hybrid materials in solar cells.108–112 We prefer to use the term “pyridine treatment” instead of “pyridine exchange” or “pyridine capping”, as in most examples the efficiency of the exchange reaction is poorly characterized. Therefore most likely a mixture of initial surface ligands and pyridine molecules exists at the nanocrystal surface. The same applies for n-butylamine, an alternative to pyridine recently proposed by Olson et al.113 These authors correlated differences in the observed J/V characteristics of surface treated CdSe nanocrystals in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) matrix with the influence of the surface ligands on the observed phase separation (Fig. 2).

The characteristics under illumination (hollow symbols) were recorded under AM 1.5D conditions with 100 mW cm−2. Black symbols: measurements in the dark. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier. 
Another strategy, aiming at increasing the charge carrier mobility within quantum dot thin films, i.e. solids composed of nanocrystals, relies on the use of bifunctional linker molecules. In colloidal solution, an extensive crosslinking of the nanocrystals by these ligands would lead to precipitation. Therefore, bifunctional linkers are used for the surface treatment after deposition of nanocrystal thin films. These bifunctional ligands are for example 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1,6-hexanedithiol, 1,4-benzenedithiol, 1,7-heptanediamine or 1,4-phenylenediamine.114–119 As the replacement of bulkier ligands with smaller ones results in the shrinking of the interparticle distance within the film, cracks and voids can appear which deteriorate the film quality. Therefore a double exchange has been proposed.120 The first one is carried out in solution and uses loosely bound ligands with similar dimensions as the bifunctional ligands. These are then introduced in a second exchange after thin film deposition. The described strategy has mostly been used in Schottky-type solar cells but is in principle also applicable for the preparation of hybrids—in particular by means of layer-by-layer assembly. This kind of deposition is favored by the strongly reduced solubility of the nanocrystals after crosslinking. Another type of surface treatment aims at the complete removal of the ligands in nanocrystals' thin films and uses hydrazine.121 As in the former examples, a decrease of the interparticle distance was observed upon treatment with a dilute solution of hydrazine. This compound, being a reducing agent and a Lewis base, also improves the passivation of surface trap states and consequently leads to strongly enhanced charge carrier mobilities in nanocrystal thin films. The review of Hillhouse and Beard122 summarizes the progress and economical aspects of solar cells fabricated from thin films of nanocrystals treated with small organic molecules.
A recent development towards better electronic coupling between quantum dots exploits inorganic surface ligands instead of organic ones. Kovalenko, Scheele and Talapin developed a series of so-called molecular metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) by dissolving bulk metal chalcogides in hydrazine.123 An example is the Sn2S64− Zintl complex, which replaces the initial surface ligands of various nanoparticles (e.g.CdSe, CdTe, Bi2S3, Au, Pd) in a simple exchange reaction using its hydrazine solution. The high colloidal stability is achieved due to the electrostatic repulsion provided by the two terminal negatively charged sulfur atoms, which are not bound to the nanocrystal surface. Furthermore, quantum dots retain, at least partially, their photoluminescence properties.
In terms of electronic properties, nanocrystal solids with initial surface ligands are highly resistive (σ = 10−12 to 10−9 S cm−1). Surface treatment with mono- or bifunctional thiols and amines strongly improves the charge carrier mobilities up to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1,4-phenylenediamine treated CdSe nanocrystals119 or 1,2-ethanedithiol treated PbSe nanocrystals124 and up to 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for hydrazine treated PbSe nanocrystals.121MCC ligands showed results on the same order of magnitude after transforming the ligands thermally into a transparent “glue” (e.g. SnS2)—however, in this case the possibility of charge transport through the sintered MCC surface ligand matrix has also to be taken into consideration.
3 Principal families of conjugated polymers for organic electronics
3.1 Generalities
The main feature of semiconducting polymers used as active components of photovoltaic cells, light emitting diodes, photodiodes, field effect transistors and other electronic devices is their spatially extended π–π or π–n–π bonding system. In this type of macromolecular compounds the σ-bonding system assures the integrity of a given macromolecule, however, its electrons do not contribute to the electrical charge transport. The presence of π-electrons makes possible the formation of different types of charge carriers like solitons, polarons, and bipolarons without the cleavage of the macromolecule. Charge carriers can for example be photogenerated (in photovoltaic cells) or injected from the electrodes (in light emitting diodes). Permanent charge carriers can also be introduced into the polymer matrix through chemical or electrochemical doping, transforming polymeric semiconductors into polymeric conductors (and even polymeric metals in some cases).125 This aspect of conjugated polymers' electroactivity is, however, beyond the scope of the present article.
Electronic, spectroscopic and redox properties of conjugated polymers are governed by the position of their HOMO and LUMO levels, which also define their band gap. These parameters are of crucial importance for their application as components of hybrid (conjugated polymers/inorganic nanocrystals) materials used in photovoltaics. In such materials, efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation, which determine the efficiency of a given solar cell, can occur at the interface between polymeric (electron donor) and nanocrystal (electron acceptor) phases, provided that the energy levels of the nanocrystals and the polymer are properly aligned. In particular the LUMO level of the acceptor must be situated below the LUMO level of the donor. The same applies to the HOMO levels (Fig. 3). The resulting staggered energy levels configuration assures an effective charge separation. The LUMO level of the acceptor should not, however, be too low because the open circuit voltage of a photovoltaic cell, Voc, is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor. Tuning of these levels is therefore of extreme importance in developing new materials for hybrid photovoltaic devices.
 Fig. 3  Energy levels alignement in a conjugated polymer/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrid facilitating the dissociation of excitons and charge separation. Left panel: excitons formed in the nanocrystal phase; right panel: excitons formed in the polymer phase. The electron (e−) and hole (h+) transfer processes are indicated with arrows. 
Experimental determination of the HOMO and LUMO positions must be considered as one of the most important steps in the characterization of polymers for organic or hybrid electronic applications. The position of the HOMO level can be measured by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) whereas that of the LUMO level by inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) (see for example ref. 126). One can also use indirect techniques to probe these levels, one of the most convenient being cyclic voltammetry. In this method the onsets of the first reduction and the first oxidation peaks of the studied polymeric semiconductor are determined. It is additionally assumed that these onsets correspond to the addition of an electron to the LUMO level and the abstraction of an electron from the HOMO level, respectively.127 The onsets of the reduction and the oxidation processes can also be determined, in a more precise way, by UV-vis-NIR or Raman spectroelectrochemical techniques.128 Using the absolute potential scale one can calculate the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels with respect to the vacuum level.129 The energy difference between the electrochemically determined LUMO and HOMO levels gives the so-called “electrochemical band gap”. It should be pointed out that for many organic semiconductors an excellent correlation is found between the LUMO level determined from IPES measurements and the onset of the first reduction peak, while the correlation between the optical and electrochemical band gaps is usually worse. Scheme 1 gives an overview of the literature data concerning the electronic energy levels of semiconductor nanocrystals (bulk values), conjugated polymers and electrode materials of relevance for use in hybrid solar cells and photodetectors.
 Scheme 1  Energy levels of selected materials of relevance for hybrid solar cells and photodetectors4,5,130 (ITO = indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate); MEH-PPV = poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]; MDMO-PPV = poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene], P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene), and PCBM = methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester). 
The exact positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels are also influenced by several factors of molecular and supramolecular nature. On the level of the structure of an individual macromolecule one of them is the chain regularity. In cases where unsymmetrical monomers are used and the applied polymerization methods are not regiospecific, nominally the same polymers may differ in their properties. Poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT—one of the most popular organic semiconductors used in photovoltaic cells and field-effect transistors—can be taken here as an instructive example. The positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels, as well as the width of its band gap, strongly depend on the polymer regioregularity. The degree of regioregularity not only affects the band structure but also strongly influences the charge carrier mobility in the devices. The latter is several orders of magnitude lower for non-regioregular polymers as compared to those showing high regioregularity.131 Finally, the lack of regioregularity makes the formation of an ordered supramolecular structure more difficult and therefore this parameter should be strictly controlled.
Polydispersity of the conjugated polymers is another point of concern. In the majority of cases the obtained polymerization or polycondensation products are mixtures of oligomers and true high molecular weight compounds. Similar to non-regioregularity, large polydispersity of molecular mass has a negative impact on the structure of thin semiconductor films in real devices since the supramolecular organization of short chain oligomers is frequently incompatible with that found for high molecular weight fractions.132 As a result, structurally poorly defined, amorphous layers are formed upon solution processing. It should also be noted that reducing the polydispersity is not sufficient. For many polymers the charge carrier mobility in the final devices is strongly molecular weight dependent, increasing by ca. 4–5 orders of magnitude for one order of magnitude increase in Mn.133–135 Thus, the application of synthetic routes leading to high molecular weight polymers of reduced polydispersity is recommended.136,137 Alternatively, fractionation of polydispersed polymers can be used with the goal to isolate the highest molecular weight fractions but this procedure implies significant losses of the synthesized compounds.
From the technological point of view solution processibility of semiconducting polymers is of crucial importance. Low molecular weight organic semiconductors can be vapor deposited, but the macromolecular nature of conjugated polymers excludes this type of processing. Solution processing has several important advantages in the fabrication of organic electronic devices, among them is the possibility of applying common solution based printing and patterning techniques, easily adaptable to large surface substrates. Since presently fabricated semiconductor nanocrystals are also solution processable, these techniques can be applied to the fabrication of hybrid electronic devices. In semiconducting polymers the solubility is usually induced by the presence of flexible alkyl or alkoxy groups. Regiochemistry must be strictly controlled in this case since inappropriate distribution of the solubilizing side groups may drastically perturb the main chain conjugation.138,139Conjugated polymers containing basic sites can also be solubilized via complexation with Brønsted or Lewis acids.
Despite all above-mentioned limits, one notes that modern synthetic polymer chemistry offers several solutions leading to semiconducting polymers with the desired macromolecular and supramolecular parameters and improved processibility. When exploring synthesis pathways to conjugated polymers, suitable for organic electronic applications, two simple principles should be kept in mind: (i) electron withdrawing moieties, present as side groups or as inherent parts of the conjugated main chain, lower the LUMO level of the polymer and (ii) side or main chain groups of electron donating properties raise the HOMO level of the polymer. These principles are used in the synthesis of low band gap semiconducting polymers, which are especially suitable for the applications in photovoltaics since their absorption bands extend towards the red and infrared spectral range. For this reason they better match the solar spectrum whose maximum flux intensity corresponds to 1.77 eV (ca. 700 nm).
Typical low band gap, high molecular weight organic semiconductors are copolymers, preferably alternate copolymers. They are obtained via oxidative, Yamamoto or Kumada coupling of a specially designed macromonomer containing electron-donating and electron-accepting units. Alternatively they can be synthesized by Stille or Suzuki coupling of two types of monomers containing electron-accepting and electron-donating units, respectively (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Synthetic procedures used in the preparation of low band gap semiconducting polymers for photovoltaic applications. 
In organic electronic devices semiconducting polymers can behave either as p-type conductors or as n-type ones, depending on the position of their HOMO and LUMO levels. Cases of ambipolar behavior have also been reported. Typical families of polymeric semiconductors will be described below.
3.2 
          Polymers used as n-type semiconductors

Polymers used as n-type semiconductors in organic electronic devices must possess a low lying LUMO level, below −4.0 eV with respect to the vacuum level if air operating stability is needed (see for example ref. 140). Some of these polymers are depicted in Scheme 2. Poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (P1) has no solubilizing substituents, its dissolution in the base form is therefore difficult. It can, however, be solubilized via complexation with a Lewis acid or via protonation with an appropriate Brønsted acid. P1, reported for the first time more than 40 years ago,141 recently turned out to be a very promising n-type semiconductor exhibiting a LUMO level of −4.5 eV with respect to the vacuum level. For the fabrication of organic electronic devices it can be solution processed from methanesulfonic acid solutions. Charge carrier mobility measured for this polymer in the OFET configuration is 0.1 cm2 V−1s−1. Recently anisotropic, belt-like nanostructures of P1, showing a very high aspect ratio, have been prepared.142
 Scheme 2  
Polymers used as n-type semiconductors. 

P2 is a representative example of polymers containing alternating electron donating oligothiophene units and electron accepting indenofluorenebis(dicyanovinylene) ones. It exhibits ambipolar behavior with comparable hole and electron mobilities.143 Several derivatives of P2 with tunable structural and electrical properties were prepared either by Stille or Yamamoto coupling.144 These polymers exhibit electron and hole mobilities of the order of 1 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 and represent the first example of ambipolar semiconductors operating in air.

P3, P4 and P5 are donor–acceptor copolymers of arylene bisimides and oligothiophenes. As a result their band gaps are low and they exhibit interesting optical properties, which foretell their potential use in solar cells.145,146 They are usually obtained from core-dibrominated bisimides and various stannylated thiophene derivatives viaStille coupling.147,148P3 is commercially available as a product of Polyera (ActiveInk™ N2200). P4 and P5 are particularly interesting cases. In the former the thienoacene-type segment favors the chain planarity. In the latter bridging β-positions in the adjacent thiophene rings of the bithiophene segment prevent their torsion and also improve the macromolecular planarity. The resulting polymer shows a LUMO level of −4.02 eV with respect to the vacuum level and a band gap of 1.5 eV—very well suited for photovoltaic applications.
3.3 
          Polymers used as p-type semiconductors
By analogy with polymers used as n-type semiconductors it could be postulated that good candidates for p-type polymeric semiconductors should exhibit a high lying HOMO level. This is not the case. Polymers with a high lying HOMO level like polypyrrole or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) are much more stable in their doped form than in the neutral (undoped) one, suitable for the majority of organic electronic applications, including photovoltaic cells. Their undoping is difficult and they become easily redoped even in the presence of minute amounts of contaminants showing slightly oxidizing properties. As a result permanent charge carriers frequently exist in these polymers, which severely perturb the photovoltaic effect. Thus, a delicate compromise is needed in this case as far as the energy level alignment is concerned: polymers with a HOMO level lying too high are prone to oxidation whereas a too low position of the HOMO level makes the photogeneration of charge carriers difficult.
Regioregular head-to-tail, head-to-tail coupled poly(3-hexylthiophene) (ht–ht P3HT) (P6 in Scheme 3) is one of the most extensively studied electroactive polymers for photovoltaic cells and photodiodes where it can be used in the form of nanocomposites with fullerene derivatives, namely methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (abbreviated as PCBM) and/or semiconductor nanocrystals.149P6 is also used in the fabrication of field-effect transistors. As already stated the exact position of the HOMO level of P6, its gap and the charge carrier mobility are molecular weight dependent, and this dependence persists to very high molecular weights.150 It should be noted that there exist several disadvantages in using ht–ht P3HT in organic electronic devices and especially in photovoltaic cells. Independent of its molecular weight, the HOMO level of this polymer is too high (−4.9 to −5.1 eV) to assure its long term operating stability. Moreover, its band gap (2.0–2.1 eV, depending on the molecular weight) does not correctly match the solar spectrum.
 Scheme 3  Different types of poly(alkylthiophene)s and poly(alkylselenophene)s. 
Poly(alkylthiophene)s of different regioregularities, for example head-to-head and tail-to-tail (hh–tt), are not suitable for photovoltaic cell fabrication due to even worse match of the solar spectrum and poor electrical transport properties. They show, however, strong electroluminescence.151
Poly(dialkylterthiophene)s (P7)152 and poly(dialkylquaterthiophene)s (P8)153 are also solution processable, although they contain a smaller number of solubilizing side groups per mer than P6. Recently, a selenoderivative of poly(didodecylquaterthiophene), P9, has been reported.154,155 All these polymers show a HOMO level position similar to P6 and slightly larger band gaps.
The ability of the rotation around the interring single bond is the main cause of significant non-planarity of poly(alkylthiophene)s. Bridging adjacent thiophene units with an appropriate linker is one of the possible strategies for the preparation of more planar poly(thiophene) derivatives of smaller band gap (Scheme 4). This can be done, for example, via synthesizing cyclopentadithiophene-type monomers containing dialkyl substituents. Dibromoderivative of this monomer can be polymerised via a nickel-catalysed coupling reaction to yield P10.156 As expected, P10 shows a reduced band gap (1.7–1.8 eV) as compared to the case of P6. Copolymers containing dithienosiloles and thiophene (or bithiophene) (P11) can also be ascribed to this family of polymeric semiconductors. The presence of aSiR2 bridging group significantly shifts the HOMO level, which is in P11ca. 0.3–0.4 eV lower than in P6.157
 Scheme 4  
Polymers containing bridged bithiophene units. 
The band gap can be further diminished if the bridging group has a distinct electron withdrawing character. Polymers with carbonyl (P12) or dicyanoethylene (P13) bridges show gaps of 1.2 eV and 0.8 eV, respectively (Scheme 5).158,159 They are usually obtained by electropolymerization of the corresponding monomers.
 Scheme 5  Bridged polythiophenes contaning electron withdrawing groups. 
Fusing the adjacent thiophene rings instead of bridging them is another strategy of impeding the polymer chain torsion (Scheme 6). Polymers containing fused oligothiophene units with no side solubilising groups are difficult to process. Introduction of alkyl substituents induces, however, a significant torsion between the neighbouring fused oligothiophene segments. A compromise is therefore needed, which is usually achieved by separating units containing alkyl substituents with unsubstituted bithiophene. This can be illustrated taking poly(2,5-bis(3′-dodecyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-3,6-dimethylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (P14) and its selenium analogue poly(5′,5′-(3,6-dimethylselenopheno[3,2-b]selenophene-2,5-diyl)bis(3-dodecyl-2,2′-bithiophene)) as examples.154 The presence of a spacer (unsubstituted thiophene ring) between the fused aromatic core and dodecylthiophene is necessary in this case because polymers without such spacers are less planar, exhibit more disordered supramolecular organization and consequently very poor performance in organic electronic devices.
 Scheme 6  
Polymers containing fused oligothiophene segments. 
Several electroactive, conjugated polymers containing thienothiophene or thienoacene type fused rings have been synthesized in recent years (P15–P18). Polymers, in which the chain conformation is all anti, are especially interesting because their chain structure facilitates the formation of very ordered supramolecular organization of so-called π-stacked lamellae, similar to that found for P6. As a result these polymers show good device performances in organic electronics.160–163
Further tuning of the band structure of polythiophene derivatives can be achieved by introducing electron-accepting groups into the polymer main chain. Alternating copolymers consisting of bithiazole and oligothiophene units (Scheme 7) can be considered as a typical example of this approach (P19 and P20). The presence of bithiazole lowers the HOMO level of these polymers by 0.15 to 0.30 eV with respect to P6, improving, in this manner, the air operating stability of these copolymers.164,165

Pyrazine modified polythiophenes can be considered as another example of donor–acceptor type macromolecular compounds in which thienopyrazine units are electron acceptors and quaterthiophene units are electron donors (Scheme 8). They can be prepared by Stille coupling of 8,10-bis[5-bromo-3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)acenaphtho[1,2-e]thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (P21) or 10,12-bis[5-bromo-3-alkylthiophen-2-yl]dibenzo[f,h]-thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline (P22) with distannylated 3,3-dialkylbithiophene.166 Showing low band gaps (1.16–1.43 eV) these polymers are very suitable for photovoltaic applications.

To summarize, a number of polythiophene derivatives are very promising candidates for application as active components of organic and hybrid photovoltaic cells. They can be rendered solution processable and their band gap as well as the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels can be modified in such a manner as to assure air operating stability and good match with the solar spectrum.
Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (abbreviated as PPV) (P23 in Scheme 9) has been the subject of a significant research interest in the early and mid-1980s because of its electrochemical activity and high electronic conductivity after chemical or electrochemical doping.167 An intensive interest in the semiconducting (undoped) form of this polymer and its derivatives started in 1990 after the discovery of its electroluminescent properties.1 In fact, the seminal paper describing the fabrication of a PPV-based electroluminescent diode triggered an exponentially growing interest in organic electronics.
 Scheme 9  Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and poly(thienylene vinylene) derivatives. 
Unsubstituted PPV is neither soluble nor fusible and can be processed only viathermal decomposition of a soluble precursor.168 This is of course inconvenient and therefore significant research efforts have been undertaken to synthesize its solution processable derivatives. Similar to the case of polythiophene family, solubility of PPV derivatives is achieved by introducing long alkyl or alkoxy substituents to the aromatic ring. Soluble PPV derivatives like for example poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV, P24) can relatively easily be prepared via a modified Gilch method,169i.e. by the reaction of dihalo-p-xylene with a base such as, for example, tert-butoxide (Fig. 5).170 The same procedure can be used for the preparation of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) (P25).
 Fig. 5  Gilch synthesis of poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s. 

          PPV derivatives have been used for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction solar cells, including organic/inorganic ones with semiconductor nanocrystals,108 despite the fact that they show band gaps above 2.0 eV (PPV 2.4 eV; MEH-PPV 2.2 eV) which are too large to correctly match the solar spectrum. Again as in the case of polythiophene derivatives, introducing substituents, which modify the π-electron density in the conjugated backbone, leads to a change in the HOMO and LUMO positions and eventually to a lowering of the band gap. For example, attaching triphenylamine groups to the 2,5-position of the phenyl ring leads to a narrowing of the band gap by 0.4 eV in the resulting polymer (P26) as compared to unsubstituted PPV (P23).171 Modification of the electronic properties of PPV can also be achieved by introducing substituents to the vinylene segment. For example, the presence of a strongly electron withdrawing group, like CN, results in simultaneous lowering of the polymer HOMO and LUMO levels by 0.5 eV in MEH-CN-PPV (P27) with respect to the case of MEH-PPV. Although the band gap position is changed, the bandwidth remains essentially the same.172
Poly(thienylene vinylene)s (PTVs) show significantly lower band gaps than their PPV analogues. To give an example, regioregular, dodecyl-substituted PTV (P27A) shows a band gap of 1.6 eV. Appropriate selection of the ring substituent yields PTV polymers with tunable band gap, suitable for a variety of applications in organic electronics.172
Polyfluorenes (P28) constitute another important class of semiconducting polymers (Scheme 10). They combine a rather large band gap on the order of 3.0 eV with strong electroluminescence. For this reason they are used as blue emitters in organic light emitting diodes. The fluorene mer can, however, also serve as a building block for the preparation of alternating copolymers with other conjugated blocks of varying electron donating/electron accepting properties. Such syntheses involve either Suzuki or Stille coupling reactions (cf.Fig. 4). Using this approach several new polymeric semiconductors were prepared with tunable electronic properties, which can serve as components of devices such as field-effect transistors, photovoltaic cells and others (P29).
 Scheme 10  
Alternating copolymers containing fluorene, silafluorene or fluorenone units. 
Oligothiophenes173 or their fused analogues174 are frequently used as co-monomers in the fluorene-based P29—type of copolymers. They show a reduced band gap as compared to poly(fluorene) homopolymers. The band gap can further be narrowed if the oligothiophene units are functionalized with strongly electron withdrawing groups such as aromatic fused pyrazine (P30).166,175 The presence of a 2,1,3-benzothiazole unit in copolymers of the P29-type also leads to a significant narrowing of the band gap. P31 is a representative example of this class of polymeric semiconductors.176 Several polymers of this family have been prepared and tested in organic electronic devices, mainly in photovoltaic cells.172Silafluorene analogues of the above-described copolymers were also synthesized (see P32 as a representative example). The presence of the benzosilole group in these polymers lowers their HOMO level and, as a result, they are good candidates for the use in air-operating electronic devices such as p-channel field-effect transistor or photovoltaic cells.157
Semiconducting copolymers and terpolymers containing fluorenone building blocks, instead of fluorene ones, have also been synthesized with the goal to use them as components of photovoltaic cells and other devices. P33 is a representative example of this class of polymers.177,178 Careful selection of the main chain segments with different electron withdrawing (donating) properties leads to organic semiconductors showing a reduced band gap. Their UV-vis spectra extend towards the red and near infrared parts of the spectrum and, by consequence, better match the solar spectrum. Fluorenone containing polymers show better thermal stability than their fluorene analogues since fluorenone is the product of thermal degradation of fluorene units in the presence of oxygen.

Carbazoles and indenocarbazoles are convenient building blocks for the preparation of solution processable semiconducting polymers since the presence of the NH group facilitates their substitution with alkyl solubilising groups (Scheme 11). Soluble poly(carbazole) (P34) and poly(indenocarbazole) (P35) homopolymers are well-known semiconductors, used in the fabrication of field-effect transistors, photovoltaic cells and other organic electronic devices. An excellent review on the synthesis of these polymers and their derivatives is recommended.179
 Scheme 11  Poly(carbazole)s, poly(indenocarbazole)s and their derivatives. 
Similar to the case of fluorenes or fluorenones, carbazoles and indenocarbazoles can serve as building blocks, which upon coupling with appropriate electron deficient co-monomers yield low band gap polymeric semiconductors. In P36 electron rich carbazole units alternate with electron deficient ones, containing the benzothiazole core, whereas in P37 indenocarbazole units alternate with bisalkoxyphenylquinoxaline ones.180 Both copolymers show narrower band gaps than their corresponding homopolymers.181
Poly(triarylamine)s such as P38 and P39 (Scheme 12) have been extensively studied as organic semiconductors in the past decade, however, interest in these compounds comes down to the late 1980s.182 Poly(triarylamine)s are used not only as hole transporting materials in electroluminescent devices183 or semiconductors in p-channel organic field-effect transistors184,185 but also as electroactive separator materials in rechargeable lithium batteries186–188 or components of the cathode.189 The three most popular preparation methods of solution processable poly(triarylamine)s, suitable for use in organic electronics are: (i) metal catalyzed Yamamoto-type coupling of dihalotriarylamine monomers;190 (ii) Suzuki AB-type condensation of an appropriate intermediate;191 and (iii) microwave assisted, palladium catalyzed condensation of aniline derivatives with dibromobiphenyl or dibromoderivatives of other aromatic compounds.192
 Scheme 12  Examples of poly(triarylamine)s. 
A significant progress in controlling their molecular weight has been achieved in the past few years.193 Thin layers of poly(triarylamines) are usually amorphous but despite this fact they usually show good electrical transport properties.194Alternating copolymers of triarylamine with fluorene (P40), indenofluorene (P41)191 and carbazole (P42)192 have also been prepared (see Scheme 13).
 Scheme 13  
Copolymers containing triaarylamine units. 
To summarize, several dozens of semiconducting polymers have been synthesized in the past two decades. The use of molecular engineering methods enabled the preparation of solution processable semiconductors with tunable electronic, spectroscopic and redox properties, tailored for a given application. However, the use of these polymers in composites with inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, extremely difficult. Because of their distinctly different chemical nature, polymeric and nanocrystal components have a strong tendency to phase separate. Therefore the additional functionalization of the semiconducting polymers and/or the design of functional nanocrystals capping ligands are usually required in the preparation of nanocomposites suitable for electronic applications. Such strategies will be described in the next section.
4 Hybrid materials from semiconductor nanocrystals and conjugated polymers
A large number of papers on the preparation of conjugated polymers/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrid materials have been published in the past 15 years. Taking into account the diversity of chemical constitution of both components, the preparation methods reported in the literature significantly differ since they are usually adjusted to a given polymer/nanocrystals couple. Despite this apparent variety of the methods and techniques, they can be classified into few categories, which are discussed below. While reading this section special attention should be paid to Fig. 6 and 7, which summarize the principal chemical preparation methods of the discussed hybrid materials.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the different strategies for the preparation of hybrid materials using conjugated macromolecules containing anchoring functions for the nanocrystal surface.

4.1 Overview of the strategies for the preparation of hybrids

4.1.1 Blending of non-functionalized polymers with nanocrystals capped with initial ligands. 
The preparation of nanocomposites from unmodified components is not trivial. Simple casting from a common solvent leads to phase separation of the constituents on a micrometre scale.6 This phenomenon has two origins: (i) nanocrystals capped with initial ligands, such as oleic acid, TOPO, stearic acid, hexadecylamine and others, have a strong tendency to form densely packed agglomerates or even highly ordered supercrystals upon solvent removal;16,19 (ii) solidification of conjugated polymers exhibiting high regioregularity gives rise to semi-crystalline structures, in which crystallized zones are separated by amorphous ones.195 As a result, processing of composite layers, in which individual nanocrystals are controllably distributed within the polymer matrix on the nanometre level, is extremely difficult. Some attempts to overcome this problem, using purely physical approaches, have been reported in the literature. An attractive method has been proposed in ref. 196. During solution processing of a composite consisting of TOPO-capped CdSe nanocrystals and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), the authors exposed the casting zone to a strong electrical field. In these conditions the phase-separated nanorods aligned perpendicular to the substrate yielding an oriented supramolecular organization. Such an electrical-field-induced texture effect is favorable in various applications of hybrid materials in electronics and especially in these cases where the nanocrystals exhibit high aspect ratio.196
Another route to composites, in which the distribution and structuration of the nanocrystals within the polymer matrix can be strictly controlled, involves directional epitaxial solidification of the polymer (again regioregular P3HT) in a crystallizable solvent, namely 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. Such solidification, carried out in the presence of spherical or rod-like CdSe nanocrystals, leads to semi-crystalline polymer layers in which crystalline lamellar domains alternate with amorphous interlamellar ones.197 The nanocrystals are rejected to the amorphous zones. The resulting supramolecular organization is therefore periodic and consists of alternating zones of crystalline poly(3-hexylthiophene) and zones in which nanocrystals are embedded in the amorphous polymer matrix.
Xu et al. proposed a processing method leading to a uniform distribution of TOPO-capped CdSe nanocrystals on the surface of P3HT nanowires.198 It is known that regioregular P3HT can be processed in a variety of forms, differing in their crystallinity and morphology. In particular its slow precipitation from p-xylene or cyclohexanone, which are poor solvents for P3HT at room temperature but can dissolve it at elevated temperatures, leads to the formation of nanofibers of ca. 20 nm in diameter.199CdSe nanocrystals compactly self-assemble on the surface of these nanofibers in the second processing step. The resulting composite shows enhanced photoconductivity, when illuminated with white light, as compared to pristine P3HT nanowires or to P3HT/CdSe nanocomposites prepared by conventional blending.
In the three above described methods, the composite components were not modified. Neither the functionalization of the polymer chain nor nanocrystals ligand exchange was carried out. Therefore their applicability is limited to these systems, for which the special processing conditions, described above, can be used.
In general, exchanging the initial, strongly binding ligands for more labile ones facilitates the dispersion of nanocrystals in a conjugated polymer matrix. In this procedure, first described by Greenham et al.,112 the initial TOPO ligands are exchanged for pyridine ones. These loosely bound ligands are supposed to be—at least partially—removed during the casting procedure, yielding “bare” nanocrystals stabilized by the conjugated polymer matrix. The substitution of the initial ligands is very important if charge transfer between both hybrid components is aimed, as they contain in most cases long alkyl chains acting as an insulating barrier. However, the proposed method has some drawbacks, the main being the reduced solubility of the pyridine-capped nanocrystals in most organic solvents, and the sensitivity of the system to even small changes in the ligand exchange and processing conditions.


4.1.2 Capping of the NC surface with conjugated macromolecules containing anchoring groups (cf.Fig. 6). 
A more versatile route for the preparation of nanocrystals/conjugated polymers hybrids is to functionalize the conjugated macromolecule with substituents containing an anchoring function capable of binding to the nanocrystals surface. An exchange of the initial ligands for the tailor-made macromolecular ones must then be carried out before the final processing step. For oligomers or low molecular mass polymers the anchor functions can be introduced either as terminal or as side groups (Fig. 6, routes 1 and 2). For polymers of a higher molecular weight, side groups are preferable (route 5), taking into account that with increasing molecular mass, the ratio of the end groups to the number of mers decreases, making the anchor functions less and less available for binding to the nanocrystals surface. Inspired by this approach, Querner et al. prepared a series of solution processable oligo- or poly(alkylthiophenes) side-functionalized with carbodithioic anchoring groups. For TOPO capped CdSe nanocrystals the ligand exchange occurs in surprisingly mild conditions owing to the strong chelating effect of the carbodithioic complexing group.200 Another advantage of the selected system is the enhanced resistance against photo-oxidation of the grafted carbodithioic anchoring group, which is technologically important, especially in photovoltaic applications.201
One must, however, be aware of the fact that the chosen polymer functionalization strategies should not perturb the macromolecular regioregularity. This is of crucial importance for essentially all applications of the polymer/nanocrystals nanocomposites in organic electronics. The same rules apply to hybrid materials as to materials consisting of neat conjugated polymers. Any perturbation of regioregularity induces unfavorable, more twisted chain conformation and makes the formation of an ordered supramolecular structure more difficult. As a result, a significant lowering of the charge carrier mobility and worsening of other electrical parameters is observed.131,202
The ligand exchange approach is a very popular method for hybrids' preparation. Reported examples comprise conjugated oligo- and polythiophenes funtionalized with thiol203 and phosphonic acid204 as well as with tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-ylidene side groups.205 In a slightly modified manner Liu et al. prepared hybrids of CdSe nanorods with amino-terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Fig. 6,route 4).206 The authors applied a two-step procedure: the initial surface ligands were first replaced by pyridine and, in the second step, the temporary pyridine ligands were exchanged for the polymeric ones.
Very recently Zotti et al. have synthesized a series of oligothiophene α,ω-dicarboxylic and -diphosphonic acids as well as polythiophenes with alkylene-carboxylate or alkylene-sulfonate side substituents.207 These compounds have then been used for the preparation of hybrid materials via ligand exchange with hexadecylamine-capped CdSe nanocrystals. The applied processing procedure consisted of alternating layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of both constituents to build a multilayer-structured hybrid.
Comb-like, graft copolymers containing polythiophene main chain and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) side groups (PT-g-PDMA) have recently been synthesized by Wang et al. with the goal to use them as organic matrices in hybrid materials with CdSe nanorods.208 The presence of the PDMA arms, showing an eleven-fold lower average polymerization degree as compared to the main chain (60 vs. 700) and containing amine anchoring groups, improved the compatibility between the organic and inorganic components of the hybrid.
Advincula et al. prepared composites of CdSe nanocrystals and dendritic oligo- and polythiophenes containing phosphonic acid type anchor groups (Scheme 14).209,210 As in ref. 112, a two step procedure was applied. In the first step the initial (TOPO) ligands were exchanged for pyridine ones and in the next step they were exchanged for phosphonic acid functionalized oligothiophene dendrons (Fig. 6, route 3).

The ligand exchange procedure has also been used for the preparation of hybrid materials consisting of nanocrystals and conjugated oligomers or polymers other than polythiophene families. Different anchor groups were tested. Sudeep et al. functionalized some oligo(phenylene vinylene)s with phosphine oxide type terminal groups.211 They were then used for the preparation of hybrids with CdSe nanocrystals. Javier et al. fabricated a hybrid of CdSe nanocrystals and oligo-p-(phenylene-ethynylene)n (n = 0, 1, 3) with dibenzylthiol end groups. In the resulting hybrids the nanocrystals were separated by rigid conjugated molecular spacers of length 1.3–3.1 nm.212 A triblock, ABA-type copolymer containing a central polyfluorene-type conjugated segment linked to two poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate) blocks has recently been assembled with CdSe nanocrystals.213 Multidentate coordination assured in this case the stability of the formed hybrid. A PPV derivative bearing a terminal sulfide function has been synthesized by Chen et al. and introduced via ligand exchange on the surface of CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals.214 The obtained hybrid material was tested in a light-emitting diode configuration showing enhanced efficiency compared to the pristine polymer.
In the preparation of hybrids, it is sometimes easier to use oligomer-type, conjugated ligands, containing an appropriate anchor group, than their high molecular weight analogues. This is due to a significant complexity of the synthesis and processing of functionalized conjugated polymers. One can, however, apply a two-step procedure leading to good compatibilization of non-functionalized conjugated polymers and nanocrystals. In the first step the nanocrystals are coated with functionalized conjugated ligands of oligomer type via the exchange with initial ligands. Such pre-coating facilitates, in the second step, the dispersion of nanocrystals in polymer matrices consisting of non-functionalized conjugated polymers. This aspect can be discussed in terms of the solubility parameters, δ. To a first approximation, the dispersion can be considered as a molecular solid solution, in which the polymer matrix is “the solvent” and the oligomer-coated nanocrystals “the solute”. The solubility parameter of the solute is then determined by the chemical constitution of the nanocrystals' surface and by consequence must be close to that of the solvent since both are chemically very similar. As a result a homogenous dispersion of the nanocrystals in the polymer matrix can be obtained. The applicability of this approach has recently been demonstrated by the preparation of a hybrid of poly(3,3″-dioctyl-2,2″:5″,2″-terthiophene) and CdSe nanocrystals, which had previously been coated with carboxylic acid functionalized dioctyl-2,2″:5″,2″-terthiophene. The resulting hybrid materials show a uniform nanocrystals distribution within the polymeric matrix.215 To the contrary, the use of TOPO-coated nanocrystals with the same polymer results in a strong, uncontrolled phase separation.


4.1.3 Hybrids via covalent grafting of conjugated macromolecules and nanocrystals capped with functionalized ligands (Fig. 7). 
(a) Ligand exchange followed by grafting of the conjugated oligomer/polymer (Fig. 7,routes 6–9). 
Grafting of macromolecules on nanocrystals surface, via a specially designed linker ligand, containing an anchor function and an additional reactive function capable of reacting with a side or end-functionalized macromolecule, is a versatile method of hybrids' preparation. It becomes more and more popular in recent years because it allows for a very precise engineering of the hybrid components. This type of procedure can be described as follows: (i) the initial NC surface ligands (e.g.TOPO, oleic acid, oleylamine, hexadecylamine, etc.) are first replaced by the above described linker ligands; (ii) the grafting reaction is then carried out, nature of which depends on the type of the reactive groups in the linker ligand and in the molecule (macromolecule) being grafted. A representative example of this procedure, yielding oligothiophene functionalized CdSe nanocrystals, is discussed below. In the first step, the exchange of the initial stearate capping ligands for 4-formyldithiobenzoate is carried out. Since carbodithioate anchor groups form strong chelate-type bonds with the cadmium atoms at the nanocrystals surface, the ligand exchange can be performed in mild conditions with essentially 100% yield.216 In the next step, the aniline terminated tetrathiophene is grafted through condensation between its amine group and the aldehyde group of the linker ligand. As a result an azomethine linkage is formed. A very similar procedure, involving the same linking ligand, was applied in the preparation of a hybrid of aniline tetramer (a model compound mimicking the behavior of polyaniline—a very well-known conducting polymer) and CdSe nanocrystals.201,217,218
Using a three-step procedure Zhang et al. grafted vinyl group terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) onto CdSe nanorods using either p-bromobenzyl-di-n-octylphosphine oxide (DOPO-Br) or 2-(4-bromo-2,5-di-n-octylphenyl)ethanethiol as linker ligands.219 In the first step the initial TOPO ligands were exchanged for pyridine ones. Then the labile pyridine ligands were replaced by the aforementioned linker ligands. In the last step the grafting reaction was carried out via Heck coupling between the terminal vinyl group of the macromolecules and the bromine group of the linker ligand.
An interesting idea of the use of electrochemical grafting in the preparation of hybrid materials, and more precisely poly(alkylenedioxythiophene)s/CdSe hybrids, has recently been evoked by Shallcross et al.220 In this procedure poly(alkylenedioxythiophenes) (alkylene = ethylene, propylene, diethylpropylene) were first electropolymerized on a transparent (ITO) electrode. Next CdSe nanocrystals capped with a bifunctional linker ligand, namely alkylenethiophene containing a carboxylic anchor group, were electrochemically captured on the surface of the electrodeposited polythiophene. It seems that the proposed procedure can easily be extended to the preparation of multilayer nanocomposites by means of an electrochemically driven LbL technique.
(b) One-step procedure using the bifunctional linker ligand in the nanocrystals synthesis. 
Some authors use bifunctional linker ligands as initial nanocrystals' ligands. This strategy reduces the preparation of hybrid materials by grafting to one single step since no additional ligand exchange step is needed. Bromine functionalized TOPO (DOPO-Br) is—just like TOPO itself—a good capping ligand for CdSe nanocrystals because it forms complexes with Cd surface atoms during nanocrystals' nucleation and growth in the reaction medium. Using this compound, hybrids of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives and CdSe nanocrystals were prepared by the copolymerization of 1,4-divinyl benzene and 1,4-dibromobenzene derivatives, initiated by the coupling of the former to DOPO-Br ligands on the nanocrystals surface.221 It should, however, be noted that the control of the copolymerization conditions is difficult in this case. The organic part of the resulting hybrid consists of oligomers of different lengths. Such molecular mass polydispersity is disadvantageous since it inevitably leads to a dispersion in the positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the grafted molecules. Therefore, in applications where these energy levels must be strictly controlled, the above-described hybrids may be of limited use.
In a similar approach, p-phenylene vinylene oligomers containing 3–6 mers were grown on DOPO-Br capped nanocrystals by the homocoupling of 1-bromo-2,5-di-n-octyl-4-vinylbenzene.222 Finally, using a one-step procedure, vinyl-terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) was grafted onto DOPO-Br coated nanocrystalsvia Heck coupling.223 These hybrids have recently been processed using the Langmuir–Blodgett deposition technique and integrated to a photovoltaic device (Fig. 8).224

4.1.4 Preparation of hybrids via non-covalent interactions (Fig. 7, route 10). 
As it has already been stated, the components of conjugated polymers/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrids have a strong tendency to phase separate. One can, however, impede this phenomenon by creating specific interactions between the nanocrystals surface ligands and the conjugated macromolecules constituting the polymer matrix. Under such circumstances a homogeneous distribution of the nanocrystals in the polymer matrix can be expected. In this respect the application of supramolecular chemistry concepts becomes helpful. The molecular recognition approach was first developed by Rotello and coworkers. They exploited this phenomenon in the preparation of organic–inorganic hybrids of metal nanoparticles and conventional polymers and more specifically in the molecular level processing of hybrids of diaminotriazine functionalized poly(styrene) and thymine-capped gold nanoparticles.225,226 In this case molecular recognition between the complementary functional groups assured the uniform distribution of the inorganic component within the polymer matrix. The same strategy has been used for the fabrication of layers of self-assembled semiconductor nanocrystals on appropriate electrodes227 or for selective immobilization of metal nanocrystals on functionalized surfaces.228 Later, the molecular recognition concept was extended to the design and preparation of conjugated polymers/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrids. De Girolamo et al. prepared a solution processable regioregular poly(alkylthiophene) derivative containing diaminopyrimidine side groups, namely poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-3-(6-oxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine)hexylthiophene) (P3HT-co-P3(ODAP)HT).229 The functionalized macromolecules were able to molecularly recognize 1-(6-mercaptohexyl)thymine (MHT) capped CdSe nanocrystalsvia three hydrogen bonds as schematically depicted in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Molecular recognition between poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-3-(6-oxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine)hexylthiophene) and 1-(6-mercaptohexyl)thymine coated CdSe nanocrystalsvia three complementary hydrogen bonds.229 
Direct processing of P3HT-co-P3(ODAP)HT/CdSe(MHT) hybrids was difficult because no common solvent could be found for the polymeric and nanocrystalline components. To overcome this problem the authors developed a special processing technique.229 It consists of the preparation of a chloroform solution of the molecular conjugate of P3HT-co-P3(ODAP)HT and MHT, to which a chloroform solution of stearate-capped CdSe nanocrystals is added. Exchange of the stearate ligands for the conjugated ones, occurring in situ, followed by casting and slow solvent evaporation results in the formation of a molecular hybrid material with uniform distribution of the nanocrystals within the polymer matrix.
The molecular recognition phenomenon, in combination with the use of orthogonal solvents for the conjugated polymer and the nanocrystals, can further be exploited as the driving force for the processing of hybrids using the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique.230 One of the appealing features of the functional copolymer P3HT-co-P3(ODAP)HT, which facilitates its application to this technique, is its adherence to a large variety of substrates containing oxide or hydroxide groups. As a consequence no necessity of surface modification or deposition of a special anchoring layer exists. The adherence of the polymer originates from its capability of forming hydrogen bonds between its DAP groups and oxidized surfaces. Films of the P3HT-co-P3(ODAP)HT/CdSe(MHT) hybrid can be deposited by alternating dipping of the substrate into a polymer solution in chloroform and into a dispersion of nanocrystals in a DMF/MeOH mixture (10:1), with an intermediate step of rinsing with chloroform and drying under argon flow after each dipping step. The applied procedure assures strict control of the layer thickness since the LbL deposition process can be followed by UV-vis spectroscopy and stopped when the absorbance reaches the desired level. The surface coverage of the polymer layer by the consecutive nanocrystals layer is incomplete and depends on the concentration of the nanocrystals' dispersion. As a result, after the deposition of several bilayers, an “interpenetrating network” morphology is found rather than a multilayer one in the resulting films, since each consecutive polymer layer fills “the voids” between nanocrystals in the underlying layer.230
Another type of non-covalent interactions, namely electrostatic ones, has recently been exploited by Wang et al. in the fabrication of a film of a hybrid material consisting of a water-soluble polythiophene derivative and CdSe nanocrystals.231 In this case CdSe nanocrystals were functionalized with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) prior to their self-assembly with side-chain-functionalized polythiophene, i.e. poly(3-(3-thienyloxy)propyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide) (P3TOPA). Lutich et al. reported the preparation of hybrid materials from a water-soluble fluorene and phenylene copolymer, namely poly[9,9-bis(3′-[(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium]-propyl)-2,7-fluorene-alt-1,4-phenylene] dibromide (PDFD), and thioglycolic acid capped CdTe nanocrystals.232 Also in this case the LbL process can be applied. In the preparation of hybrids consisting of thiophenol-capped CdS nanocrystals and a poly(fluorene) derivative of dendritic structure, Chou et al. exploited non-covalent, π–π interactions with the goal to improve the miscibility between both components.233


4.1.5 
            In situ
            growth of nanocrystals in conjugated polymer matrices. 

In situ
            growth of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix can be considered as another way to obtain intimate blends of nanocrystals and conjugated polymers. This approach differs from all the method described in the previous paragraphs, but it constitutes an interesting way to overcome the problem of finding a common solvent during the hybrid processing. The principle of this approach is based on the dissolution of the nanocrystals precursor in a solution of the polymer, and the growth of the nanoparticles in the polymer template. The macromolecular chains enable the stabilization of the nanocrystals and passivation of their surface states. This strategy has been applied to a variety of semiconductor nanocrystals, such TiO2,234,235ZnO,236–238 PbS239–242 and CdS.243–245
The work of Liao et al. can be considered here as an instructive example of this approach.243 These authors have grown CdS nanorodsin situ in a P3HT template, the sulfur atom of the thiophene ring giving an anchoring site for the nucleation of the nanocrystals (Fig. 10). Using this hybrid material, the authors have prepared solar cells, which showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.9% under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2).

The growth of the nanoparticles in a given polymer template can also be favored by grafting of the nanocrystals' precursor to the macromolecular chains. Peng et al. have prepared a polythiophene based copolymer bearing zinc methacrylate moieties by atom-transfer radical polymerization.246 Subsequent hydrolysis of the zinc methacrylate groups yields a polythiophene/ZnO hybrid nanocomposite showing efficient PL quenching, which indicates its suitability for photovoltaic applications.

4.2 Hybrids characterization

4.2.1 Analysis of the composition. 
Hybrids of conjugated polymers and inorganic nanocrystals are complex materials whose properties depend on molecular parameters of the polymeric component (polymer chain microstructure) and on its macromolecular parameters (molecular mass and its distribution). Shape, size and its distribution as well as the stoichiometry of the nanocrystals must also be taken into account. Finally, the supramolecular organization of the hybrid and its in many cases hierarchical nature must be analyzed. For these reasons, the detailed characterization of hybrids requires the use of several complementary techniques. In hybrids prepared via ligand exchange or by ligand exchange followed by oligomer (polymer) grafting, the estimation of the degree of ligand exchange is of crucial importance since this process determines the chemical composition of the resulting hybrid. The ligand exchange induced changes in the composition of the organic part of the hybrid can be determined by classical elemental analysis or by various instrumental analytical methods. Elemental analysis brings especially useful information in cases where a characteristic element can be found in the new ligand, which is not present in the old ones or vice versa. More frequently, the verification of the degree of ligand exchange is carried out by 1H NMR spectroscopy through the integration of the peaks corresponding to the initial ligands and the exchanged ones.247 The NMR lines of the capping ligands in colloidal solutions of nanocrystals are somehow broadened, as compared to those registered for the corresponding “free” ligands, because of the limited molecular mobility of the molecules coordinated to the nanocrystals' surface. However, in the majority of cases this phenomenon does not perturb the determination of the ligands' relative ratio.248UV-vis absorption spectroscopy can also be used in ligand exchange investigations provided that the molar absorption coefficient of the diagnostic peaks, selected for the initial and the exchanged ligands, is known. Finally, FTIR spectroscopy gives in most cases at least qualitative information about the success of ligand exchange since a large number of surface ligands contain clear IR diagnostic bands, originating from anchoring functions such as amine or carboxylate groups.
Another important parameter, which characterizes hybrid materials discussed in this review, is the organic to inorganic matter ratio. This ratio can be determined from either elemental analysis or thermogravimetric (TG) investigations. In general, organic components of the hybrid decompose yielding no residual mass. Moreover, at the temperature of the organic component decomposition, the inorganic core of the nanocrystal remains still intact. Therefore, the mass measured after the organic part decomposition corresponds to the inorganic part of the hybrid, provided that no oxidation of the inorganic core (or other type of a mass changing reaction) has taken place during the TG measurement. Combining the NMR and TG data and knowing the size of monodisperse nanocrystals in a given sample, it is possible to calculate the number of their surface atoms and, in the next step, to find the degree of their surface complexation or, in other words, to find the surface ligand to nanocrystals' surface atoms ratio. This is also an important parameter characterizing the hybrid.


4.2.2 Determination of the relative HOMO and LUMO levels.

            . 
As it has already been stated in Section 3.1, the application of hybrids in electronics requires the determination of the HOMO and LUMO levels of their organic and inorganic components since the type of their alignment determines their possible applications. The ELUMO − EHOMO energy difference of the hybrid components can be extracted from the UV-vis spectroscopic data.249,250 It is recommended to determine it first for both components separately (i.e. for “free conjugated ligands” and nanocrystals capped with initial ligands), since interactions with nanocrystals may influence the conformation of the conjugated ligands after their complexation and, by consequence, alter the ELUMO − EHOMO energy difference (see below).217
Optical studies give access to the value of the ELUMO − EHOMO energy difference but do not provide information concerning the position of these levels with respect to the vacuum level. As also mentioned in Section 3.1, the HOMO level can be determined by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and the LUMO level by inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES). They can also be determined electrochemically since both components of the hybrid are electrochemically active. Their voltammograms give a clear anodic wave upon their oxidation and a cathodic one upon their reduction (see Fig. 11). The determination of the oxidation and reduction wave onsets gives access to the HOMO and LUMO levels.

                Cyclic voltammograms of (a) different-sized CdSe nanocrystals;217 (b) hexyl (curve 1) and dodecyl (curve 2) substituted poly(3-alkylthiophene)s.251 
In the majority of cases the electrochemically determined ELUMO − EHOMO energy difference is, for nanocrystals, very close to that measured optically. By both methods the quantum confinement effect, characteristic of nanocrystals, is evidenced.217,252 Also in conjugated polymers the optically and electrochemically determined ELUMO − EHOMO energies usually agree, although there exist cases where the recorded optical transition of the lowest energy does not reflect the HOMO to LUMO transition. This can happen in donor–acceptor-type polymers where the HOMO and the LUMO orbitals may be located on different chemical moieties. Thus, the comparison of the spectroscopic and electrochemical data must be treated with caution.

Spectroelectrochemical methods
            . 
Spectroelectrochemical determination of the HOMO and LUMO levels is recommended over the voltammetric one since the latter is sensitive to the film morphology and the scan rate. The spectroelectrochemical study can be carried out in the “quasi-static” mode. In this experiment the electrode is polarized to potentials close to but lower than the expected onset of oxidation (reduction). The potential is then being raised (lowered) in small increments of ca. 10 mV. At each step the spectrum is registered (UV-vis-NIR, FTIR or Raman, depending on the applied technique). Since oxidation (reduction) induced spectral changes are very characteristic, the potential of the oxidation (reduction) onset can clearly be identified.
This method is illustrated in Fig. 12a and b where the results of UV-vis spectroelectrochemical investigations of a thin layer of poly(2-(2-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-3-yl)acetic acid) and its hybrid with CdSe nanorods are presented.252 The hybrid material was prepared by exchange of the initial ligands for pyridine ones in the first step and for the macromolecular ligands in the second step. Carboxylic groups present in the polymer served as anchor functions.
The most striking difference between the spectra of the neutral form of pure poly(2-(2-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-3-yl)acetic acid) and its hybrid with CdSe nanorods (see the spectra in Fig. 12 registered at E = 0.1 V) is a hypsochromic shift of the π–π* transition band from 448 nm in the pure polymer to 430 nm in the hybrid. This means that the band gap of the polymer in the hybrid increased by approx. 0.12 eV as a consequence of the interactions with the dispersed nanocrystals. This shift can, therefore, serve as an indication of a conformational change occurring in poly(2-(2-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-3-yl)acetic acid) upon its coordination to the nanocrystals' surface that lowers its effective conjugation length. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for the composite of diaminopyrimidine functionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene) and thymine-capped CdSe nanocrystals.255 Since the macromolecules in the hybrid are in a less planar conformation than in their free form they are more difficult to oxidize. This phenomenon is clearly demonstrated in the spectroelectrochemical response of the composite layer. Oxidative (or reductive) doping of nearly all conjugated polymers gives rise to a bleaching of the π–π* transition with simultaneous growth of two new bands in the red and infrared part of the spectrum. The same is observed for poly(2-(2-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-3-yl)acetic acid) and its composite with CdSe nanocrystals. Upon rising the electrode potential from 0.1 to 0.7 V one observes an essentially complete disappearance of the π–π* transition band in the pure polymer whereas in the case of the hybrid this band is still of significant intensity. Moreover, the positions of the doping induced bands in the hybrid, registered at E = 0.7 V, are also hypsochromically shifted as compared to the corresponding bands in the pure polymer. In the former, they are located at 750 and 1340 nm, compared to 775 and 1534 nm, respectively, in the latter. These differences are consistent with a larger gap of the polymer in the hybrid, which also results in a higher spacing between the polaron levels. Finally, the doping induced bands in the hybrid material are of significantly lower intensity for the same electrode potential, which indicates a much more difficult oxidative doping. Similarly difficult doping was reported for polymers of low conjugation length.254

Thus, as clearly seen from this instructive example, organic and inorganic components of the hybrid may mutually influence the position of their HOMO and LUMO levels and as a result their spectroscopic and redox properties do not follow the rule of additivity. As demonstrated, grafting of aniline tetramer to CdSe nanocrystalsvia an azomethine-phenylene spacer and carbodithioate anchor function results in a lowering of the nanocrystals' HOMO level.217 This is caused by the fact that the charge of the oligoaniline radical cations, which are formed at lower potentials, makes the oxidation of the nanocrystals more difficult. To the contrary, in molecularly processed hybrids of poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-3-(6-oxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine)hexylthiophene) and mercaptohexylthymine-capped CdSe nanocrystals the formation of a self-assembled network makes the nanocrystals less resistant against electrochemical oxidation which means that their HOMO level is raised. Spectroelectrochemical investigations of this hybrid unequivocally show that the oxidation of the nanocrystals starts at lower potentials as compared to the case of stearate-capped nanocrystals.255


4.2.3 Photoluminescence quenching studies. 
The majority of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals and conjugated oligomers (polymers) are photoluminescent and electroluminescent. In most examples of organic/inorganic molecular hybrids, prepared either by ligand exchange or by grafting of a conjugated oligomer (polymer) to a linker ligand, the luminescence is efficiently quenched via charge and/or energy transfer as a consequence of the relative energy level alignment.221,223 Effective luminescence quenching is especially important in hybrids which are to be used as components of photovoltaic cells (see Section 5.2.1) and can be considered as a manifestation of the exciton dissociation phenomenon in hybrid systems showing a staggered (type II) energy band alignment. The ligand exchange induced quenching can be followed in a titration experiment where small aliquots of the oligomer (polymer) solution are added to a colloidal solution of the nanocrystals containing the initial ligands or vice versa. Registration of the photoluminescence spectra after each addition allows, after their normalization, the determination of the degree of quenching as a function of the nanocrystals to oligomer (polymer) ratio.204,256 The quenching can also be considered as an indirect measure of the effectiveness of ligand exchange.
To summarize, specific interactions between macromolecules and nanocrystals (or their ligands) strongly influence the position of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the hybrid material constituents. This leads, in turn, to a significant modification of their redox and spectroscopic properties. As a result the properties of the hybrid materials can only in rare cases be considered as additive. Thus any newly developed organic/inorganic hybrid requires its full characterization by application of several complementary techniques such as elemental analysis, thermogravimetry and NMR spectroscopy, which must be used for the determination of the hybrids' chemical composition and the degree of the complexation at the NC surface. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical investigations are necessary to establish their redox properties, the alignment of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the hybrid components and the efficiency of their luminescence quenching. Finally, microscopic techniques (TEM, SEM, AFM, STM) are necessary for the elucidation of the hybrids' supramolecular organization and morphology.

5 Charge-carrier generation and their transport in hybrids
One of the main characteristics of the organic/inorganic hybrid materials discussed in this review is the photoelectric effect. Indeed, they exhibit the ability of converting radiation energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Photogeneration of charges in the hybrid materials (namely of a coulombically bound electron–hole pair, the exciton) is directly exploited in photovoltaic cells and photodectors and adds a new control parameter on the behaviour of field-effect transistors and memory devices. Moreover, hybrids being heterojunctions of at least two semiconductors exhibit an internal photo-induced “chemical” potential drop. Specific and engineerable band structures allow for the design of different types of devices. One possibility of energy level alignment occurring in semiconductor heterojunctions (type II or “staggered” alignment) has been shown in Fig. 3. It leads to spatial separation of the charge carriers in the two materials. To the contrary, a type I alignment provides confinement of both the electron and the hole in one of the semiconductors. This configuration is mainly used in core/shell nanocrystals, aiming at better photostability and higher fluorescence quantum yield upon growth of a larger band gap semiconductor on the surface of the emitting core nanocrystal.257
The mentioned potential drop can induce dissociation of bound excitons into electrons and holes that diffuse in the networks of both nanocomposite components, even without an applied external electric field. Thus, the generation and transport of charge carriers in the active layer are of crucial importance in essentially all applications of organic/inorganic hybrids. For this reason we give here an overview of different physical characterisation techniques of nanohybrids with special emphasis on the elucidation of electrical transport phenomena. As expected, such studies are often application-oriented. For example, in materials tested as active components of photovoltaic devices, parameters that lead to an increase of photocurrent are sought for, whereas in search for new lost-cost, solution processable and light-sensitive memory devices, the emphasis is put on the study of electrical bistability, electrical history and ageing. In the studies of solar cells, an improvement in charge transport throughout the whole device is aimed, and thus the effect of nanocrystals' insulating surface ligands must be minimized, whereas the presence of such ligands likely empowers long-lived charge retention in electrically bistable memory devices. Most studies discussed in this review are related to photovoltaics and photodetectors, therefore the descriptions of transport phenomena are focusing on these applications.
In the dark, no charge carriers should exist in ideal hybrid materials suitable for photovoltaic or photodiode applications. This means that both components of the hybrid (polymer and nanocrystals) should be used in their undoped state. However, in real systems different types of charges are present in such materials in the dark, for example residual charges originating from incomplete undoping of the polymers, charges resulting from local electrochemical doping, and so on. Under irradiation, the active layer transforms the energy of light into so-called “photogenerated” unbound charges, which are free to move in the system in addition to the already mentioned residual charges. It is, however, important to prepare, purify and process the hybrid in such a manner as to minimize the concentration of residual charge carriers and charge carrier traps. If the interference from residual charge carriers is negligible, the electrical transport of charges is directly correlated to the dissociation of excitons whose efficiency determines the maximal number of photogenerated free carriers. Recombination of free positive and negative charge carriers at interfaces or defects plays a limiting role as far as the electrical transport is concerned. Scheme 15 gathers the possible fates of charge carriers in a type II hybrid device.
 Scheme 15  Charge carrier generation, transfer and transport processes in hybrid materials. 
Understanding the active layer behaviour requires variation of its essential parameters in a large range. This usually implies three types of parameters: (i) molecular parameters like chemical composition of the hybrid components and their functionalisation; (ii) material parameters such as supramolecular organization in the hybrid layer as well as its morphology and (iii) external parameters like applied electric field, temperature, light intensity and wavelength. These parameters would not necessarily vary in such wide ranges when hybrid materials are used as components of real devices. We first review the exciton diffusion and dissociation phenomena, then focus on studies of conduction mechanisms, and finally on the investigation of recombination processes.
Relatively little understanding of hybrid materials functioning as active layers has been achieved, compared to the understanding of charge-carrier transport in thin films consisting solely of inorganic nanocrystals or of conjugated polymers (see for example ref. 258 for a general review on the use of nanocrystals in optoelectronics, and ref. 259 and 260 about transport in organic semiconductors). Studies carried out in these closely related fields could be very inspiring when kept in mind that the properties of hybrid materials frequently cannot be predicted from the properties of pure conjugated polymers and inorganic nanocrystals by the simple rule of addition. This is because mixing of these components frequently involves direct intermolecular interactions leading to synergic effects.
The hybrid materials discussed in this section are listed in Table 2.

5.1 Exciton generation and diffusion
Photoexcitation results in the generation of excitons either in the polymeric phase or in the nanocrystals phase. Their presence gives rise to specific changes in the absorption spectrum of the hybrid material.

5.1.1 Exciton absorption band and lifetime in the photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectrum. 
Photo-induced absorption is a pump-probe method: the sample is photo-excited by a source of a fixed wavelength. Changes in the transmittance of the sample caused by the presence of excitations are recorded as a function of the wavelength of the probing light. In these experiments one can detect the depletion of the ground states by an increased relative transmittance at the gap energy. Pientka et al. observed bleaching of the polymer absorption bands at 2.2 eV, in the blends of MDMO-PPV with InP (4.2 nm) or with CdSe (4.1 nm) spherical nanocrystals, corresponding to the gap energy 2.4 eV of the polymer.268,269
Heinemann et al. reported a PIA spectrum of pure P3HT exhibiting a peak at 1.09 eV,273 identified as an interchain singlet exciton.287 In the same article,273 the PIA spectra of P3HT:PCBM and of P3HT:CdSe nanocrystals blends were also investigated (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 13  Photo-induced absorption spectra of pristine P3HT and blends of P3HT/PCBM (50% of PCBM in weight) and P3HT/CdSe nanocrystals (∼90% of nanocrystals in weight) at 80 K, with a laser power of 30 mW cm−2 and chopper frequency of 80 Hz. The inset shows the schematic energy level diagram of photoexcited P3HT with the allowed optical transitions. Reproduced from ref. 273 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmBH & Co. 
When fitting the frequency dependence of relative transmittance peaks in PIA (see Section 5.2.4), one can obtain the species lifetimes. Pientka et al. found a triplet exciton lifetime in pure MDMO-PPV of 156 µs at 20 K.268
In hybrids consisting of DHeO-CN-PPV and 4.0 nm CdSe nanocrystals, Ginger and Greenham reported the measurement of exciton lifetimes from PIA signals as a function of temperature to be 0.21 ms, 0.13 ms and 0.05 ms at 15 K, 160 K and 245 K, respectively.262


5.1.2 Exciton lifetimes extracted from the decay of the photoluminescence signal. 
Photoluminescence lifetime measurements (cf. right part of Scheme 16) consist of recording the photoluminescence signal intensity decay as a function of time after excitation, giving access to the exciton lifetime before radiative geminate recombination. They can be used to compare the lifetimes of excitons in a pure polymer and in its blends with nanocrystals. Such comparative spectra manifest different couplings between organic and inorganic components of the hybrid. Kang et al. have demonstrated that long-lived polymer excited states are quenched by nanocrystals in hybrids of vertically aligned CdTe nanorods and P3OT.280 The photoluminescence lifetime decreased from 13 ns in the pure polymer sample to 250 ps in the hybrid. Noone et al. reported a decrease of the photoluminescence lifetime with increasing content of 3.5 nm butylamine treated PbSe nanocrystals (up to 75% in weight) in hybrids with MDMO-PPV.270
 Scheme 16  Typical aspects of photoluminescence (PL) studies. The green curves are typical of polymer spectra and the red curves of hybrids spectra. The left part depicts a stationary photoluminescence quenching experiment where the photoluminescence is recorded as a function of the emitted light wavelength and exhibits a peak at λ0. The right part shows the dynamics of the photoluminescence decay for the pure polymer and for the hybrid at the peak wavelength λ0. The tangents to the curve indicate the photoluminescence lifetime. 
Wang et al. have shown that the lifetime of the photoluminescence of AFPO-3 decreased when it was blended with branched CdSe nanocrystals. The photoluminescence decay was more important for larger weight ratios of nanocrystals.285Transport of excitons is driven by the diffusion when no external field is applied and by the drift-diffusion in the presence of an external field. This transport of excitons eventually leads to either their monomolecular (or geminate) recombination or their dissociation at an energetic interface. Alternatively their dissociation can be caused by an external electric field. The diffusion length is defined as the length on which excitons statistically diffuse before recombining. The reported diffusion lengths in pure conjugated polymers vary strongly but are generally on the order of a few nanometres to 10 nanometres (cf.Table 3).

These diffusion lengths correspond to radiative and non-radiative decays of a time range of 10−12 to 10−9 s.112,262,270,291 When charge collection is intended (e.g. in photodiodes or photovoltaic cells) rather than charge trapping or recombination, such small diffusion lengths imply the use of materials, in which the phase separation of the components occurs on the nanometre scale, i.e. on the order of around 10 nm. This condition has to be fulfilled to optimize the dissociation of excitons by maximizing their chance to meet an energetic interface before recombining.

            et al. excited selectively polyfluorene PFE containing very small amounts (3% in weight) of spherical CdSe–ZnS core–shell nanocrystals (3.3–5.8 nm core diameter) and monitored the decay of the photoluminescence signal as a function of temperature.284 The efficiency of the nonradiative energy transfer from the polymer exciton onto the nanocrystal phase Q is in this case given by Q = 1 − τD/τ0, where τ0 is the decay time of the photoluminescence in the pristine polymer and τD the decay time in the hybrid. At room temperature, Q reached approximately 30% whereas it decreased to about 5% at 6 K. Thus the energy transfer is thermally activated, which is attributed to the thermal activation of exciton diffusion.

5.2 Dissociation of excitons into free charge-carriers
Several types of charge carriers can be formed upon doping or photoexcitation of conjugated polymers such as solitons, polarons, bipolarons, etc. In nanocrystals, exciton dissociation leads to the formation of free electrons and holes. Excitons dissociate at energetic interfaces where the electron (hole) is transferred to a lower (higher) energy level, being thus electrostatically separated from its counterpart. Favourable energetic interfaces for exciton dissociation are found at the electrodes, at the interfaces of the components of the heterojunction and at localized defects (such as impurities, surface traps on nanocrystals and polymer chain imperfections such as chain folding, regioregularity defects or chain ends).

5.2.1 Photoluminescence quenching measurements. 
In photovoltaic cells based on the bulk heterojunction concept and in photodiodes, the energy levels of the hybrid components are aligned in the staggered configuration (see Scheme 15). Only this type of alignment promotes an effective charge separation at the interface. On the other hand, the charge separation prevents from radiative recombination within the hybrid constituents (cf. left part of Scheme 16). Therefore photoluminescence quenching measurements have been used to study the exciton dissociation in hybrids (see also Section 4.2.3). It has to be stressed that the photoluminescence of the nanocrystals is in general already quenched by surface treatments, such as refluxing in pyridine, prior to the hybrid processing. To the contrary, the quenching of the polymer photoluminescence is induced by the presence of the nanocrystals and depends on their content in the mixture. Ginger and Greenham reported a decrease in the photoluminescence quantum yield from 15% in pure MEH-PPV to 2% in its blends with 65% in weight of CdSe spherical nanocrystals treated with pyridine (2.5 nm, 3.3 nm and 4.0 nm).262 A similar effect was reported in the case of blends using MEH-CN-PPV with an efficiency going down from 60% for pure MEH-CN-PPV to 2% for blends with 65 wt% of nanocrystals. In blends of 3.0 nm spherical CdSe nanocrystals with P3HT (with ∼90% nanocrystals in weight), Heinemann et al. reported a photoluminescence quenching of 70% relative to the emission of pristine P3HT.273 In blends of MDMO-PPV with 3.5 nm spherical PbSe nanocrystals, the photoluminescence was quenched by up to 80% with respect to the pristine polymer luminescence for 75 wt% of nanocrystals.270
The degree of photoluminescence quenching depends on the nature of the polymer–nanocrystals interface that may influence the coupling between nanocrystals and polymer chains. It has been shown that the photoluminescence of some polymers does not decrease upon incorporation of nanocrystals: Ginger and Greenham found no photoluminescence quenching for DHeO-CN-PPV blended with spherical CdSe nanocrystals (2.5 nm, 3.3 nm, and 4.0 nm in diameter) treated with pyridine, up to a 65% weight content of nanocrystals.262 They suggested that the alkyl chains of this polymer provided spatial barriers, which inhibited charge transfer. Noone et al. also reported the absence of photoluminescence quenching of P3HT when blended with 3.5 nm PbSe spherical nanocrystals treated with butylamine.270
Insulating nanocrystal surface ligands have also been found to inhibit the photoluminescence quenching. Greenham et al. showed in their initial report that quenching of the photoluminescence of MEH-PPV did not occur when 4 nm CdS nanocrystals were capped with TOPO but was efficient after their treatment with pyridine (up to 90 wt% of nanocrystals).112 This behaviour was attributed to the difference of electronic coupling allowed by insulating ligands (TOPO) and by small and conjugated molecules: in the case of insulating ligands, the transfer process takes longer than the radiative or non-radiative decays usually at play in MEH-PPV.
Finally, it should be pointed out that photoluminescence quenching can arise not only from charge transfer between two components of the hybrid material but also from energy transfer from the excited state of the donor to the lower excited state of the acceptor (see Scheme 15). Although the photoluminescence experiments are widely used, they do not distinguish between charge and energy transfers. On the other hand, light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) and photo-induced absorption (PIA) allow to distinguish between these two processes and to detect the types of free carriers that arise from the dissociation.


5.2.2 Light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR). 
Some of the photogenerated charge storage configurations carry unpaired spins. These are for example positive polarons (s = 1/2, q= +1) or negative polarons (s = 1/2, q = −1). For this reason their formation can be followed by various ESR-based techniques. For example, light-induced electron spin resonance (LESR) allows the detection of photo-generated paramagnetic species and of their Landé factor g. Under magnetic field, an unpaired spin exhibits split energy levels and consequently a supplementary allowed energetic transition. The absorption of electromagnetic energy from the magnetic field by unpaired spins can be recorded which gives access to the Landé factor through eqn (1): (1)where ν is the field frequency and B the field strength (h and µb are respectively the Planck constant and the Bohr magneton).
In LESR, the spins are photo-generated by a laser excitation prior to the detection of energy absorption. Pientka et al. applied LESR to blends of MDMO-PPV with 4.1 nm CdSe nanocrystals treated with pyridine or 4.0 nm CdSe nanocrystals capped with TOPO.268 They detected an LESR signal at g = 2.0025, characteristic of the presence of polymer radical cations (Fig. 14). This signal had a much higher intensity for blends with pyridine treated nanocrystals than for blends with TOPO capped ones, in accordance with the observed stronger photoluminescence quenching. However, no trace of radical anions (i.e. negatively charged spins) was found.
 Fig. 14  Light-induced electron spin resonance spectra from ref. 269. The straight line is the spectrum of a blend of MDMO-PPV and 3.1 nm CdSe nanocrystals treated with pyridine while the dashed line corresponds to the spectrum of a blend of MDMO-PPV and 3.1 nm CdSe nanocrystals capped with their original TOPO ligands. Measurements were taken at 293 K, with excitation at 514 nm and 20 mW cm−2. The inset shows the temporal evolution of the LESR signal at g = 2.0025 while light is switched on and off. Reproduced from ref. 269 with permission of Elsevier. 
Heinemann et al. studied blends of P3HT and 3.0 nm spherical CdSe nanocrystals treated with pyridine.273 They identified at resonance at g = 2.002 a signature of photo-generated polarons on the polymer. At 5 K and a microwave power of 10 mW, two more resonances appeared at g = 2.001 and g = 2.005 and were attributed to strongly localized polarons. No trace of paramagnetic states on the CdSe nanocrystals could be detected.
Dietmueller et al. investigated LESR in blends of 33 nm spherical Si nanocrystals with P3HT.277 They found a signature of positive polarons at g = 2.0024 and of dangling bonds on Si nanocrystals at g = 2.0065 in the hybrid both in the dark and under light. The polaron signal obtained upon irradiation was, however, one order of magnitude more intensive. This increase is comparable to that observed in P3HT:PCBM blends. The dangling bonds signal became smaller with irradiation. The authors attributed the observed spectral features to the photogeneration of positive polarons on the polymer chains without concluding on the exact process that led to it. Several pathways may be involved: (i) exciton generation on the polymer followed by the electron transfer on the nanocrystal; (ii) exciton generation on the polymer with subsequent energy transfer to nanocrystals, followed by a back transfer of the hole to the polymer; (iii) exciton generation in the nanocrystal followed by the hole transfer to the polymer (cf.Scheme 15).


5.2.3 Photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy. 
As already stated, PIA is a pump-probe method where the relative transmittance ΔT/T of samples is recorded after photoexcitation. PIA is not only suitable for the detection of excitons (see section 5.1.1) but also can serve for the determination of the resulting charge carriers' configuration after the exciton dissociation.
Ginger and Greenham investigated blends of PPV derivatives (MEH-PPV, MEH-CN-PPV, DheO-CN-PPV) and spherical CdSe nanocrystals with diameters of 2.5 nm, 3.3 nm and 4.0 nm, treated with pyridine.262 For pristine MEH-PPV, they observed no features in relative transmittance at room temperature but in composites with nanocrystals (40% of nanocrystals in weight) three broad peaks at 2 eV, 1.3 eV and 0.5 eV were found. They were attributed to the presence of localized polarons in the π–π* gap of the polymer.
Using photo-induced absorption, Tseng et al. showed the appearance of a broad peak in the relative transmittance spectrum of PFE blended with 3.2 nm CdSe nanocrystals treated with pyridine (75% of nanocrystals in weight) after photo-excitation of the nanocrystals.283 This peak was absent in the transmittance spectrum of 3.2 nm CdSe nanocrystals treated with TOPO. Since it was also absent in the blend of the same pyridine-treated 3.2 nm CdSe nanocrystals with poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA), the authors attributed it to the presence of charged species in the conjugated polymer, either bipolarons or π-dimers.
Pientka et al. studied the photo-induced absorption of blends of MDMO-PPV with 4.1 nm CdSe nanocrystals (80 wt%) or with 4.2 nm InP anocrystals (67 wt%), both treated with pyridine.268 They reported the apparition of two peaks, at 0.31 eV and 1.34 eV, in the relative transmittance spectra after excitation at 532 nm and attributed these lower energy bands to allowed transitions involving the positive polaron states located in the polymer band gap.
Noone et al. reported the photo-induced absorption in blends of MDMO-PPV or P3HT with CdSe and PbSe nanocrystals of different diameters treated with butylamine.270 Whereas the blends with CdSe nanocrystals exhibited a large polaronic absorption band between 1.0 eV and 2.1 eV, the blends containing PbSe nanocrystals showed no evident features above the noise of the experiment for the diameters tested (from 3.5 nm to 4.8 nm).


5.2.4 Lifetimes of photo-excited charge-carriers. 
 

LESR
 decay
            . 
Since the LESR brings evidence of the presence of photo-generated paramagnetic species, studying the decay of the LESR signal intensity allows finding the lifetime of these charge carriers.
Pientka et al. carried out the room temperature investigation of the LESR signal decay (g = 2.0025, corresponding to the presence of polarons in MDMO-PPV blended with 4.1 nm CdSe or 4.2 nm InP nanocrystals).268 A very long decay time was measured: the LESR signal lasted several seconds after switching off the excitation light. Heinemann et al. have shown that the decay of polaron signal of P3HT blended with 3.0 nm spherical CdSe nanocrystals (∼90 wt%) can be divided into two components.273 The decay time of the first one is faster than 1 s, whereas the signal of the second one persists over several hours. This second component was attributed to the existence of deep traps inhibiting the recombination of polarons.

Frequency dependence of the PIA 
spectrum
            . 
In the photo-induced absorption experiments, modulating the excitation light chopper frequency gives indications on the lifetimes of the generated carriers. Three different equations describe possible recombination pathways (eqn (2) to (4)). Eqn (2) describes the dependence of the PIA signal on the chopper frequency in the limits of a monomolecular recombination process:294 (2)where kgen is the generation rate, i the light intensity, τ the exciton lifetime and ω the chopper frequency.
Ginger and Greenham found −ΔT/T agreeing with eqn (2) in blends of DheO-CN-PPV and 4.0 nm spherical CdSe nanocrystals (40% of nanocrystals in weight).262 This monomolecular recombination behaviour is consistent with the absence of photoluminescence quenching observed in these blends: it suggests that electron transfer does not occur in between this high electron affinity polymer and nanocrystals.
In the case of bimolecular recombinations, the following equation can be used:273 (3)where β is a decay constant and 
One should also consider a more complex case in which polaron lifetimes are distributed. This picture is coherent with the supramolecular organisation of the polymer layers in which less ordered areas coexist with better ordered ones. This must give rise to energetically non-equivalent domains and by consequence to dispersive recombination.
Indeed, several literature examples show that the polaron lifetime distributions should be taken into account since the experimental data cannot be fitted with eqn (2) and (3) using a single value of the lifetime. For example, for blends of MEH-PPV with spherical 2.5 nm or 4 nm CdSe nanocrystals (40% of nanocrystals in weight), Ginger and Greenham found −ΔT/T being proportional to ω−1/2.262 This is incompatible with eqn (2). To explain this discrepancy, the authors propose a distribution of the lifetimes that would include components longer than several ms and shorter than 100 µs. Similarly, Tseng et al. suggested a broad distribution of the lifetimes, in the µs–ms range, in the explanation of the spectroscopic results obtained for PFE/3.2 nm CdSe blends (75% of nanocrystals in weight).283 Pientka et al. investigated MDMO-PPV/4.2 nm InP nanocrystals blends (67 wt%) and found lifetimes ranging from 250 µs to several tens or hundreds of ms.269
A model accounting for this dispersive recombination with multiple trapping and release of carriers from the traps leads to the following relationship:295 (4)where (−ΔT/T)0 gives the PIA amplitude at a zero chopper frequency, ω = 0, τ the effective mean lifetime and γ a constant.
The experimental data can be fitted with one (mean) lifetime using eqn (4), as demonstrated by Wang et al., who measured the frequency dependence of the PIA signal in blends of AFPO-3 and branched CdSe nanoparticles treated with pyridine.285 They found a broad distribution of polaron lifetimes ranging from 330 µs to 10 ms. Fitting their data to eqn (4) yielded an average lifetime of 1.3 ms and γ = 0.89. Heinemann et al. found a mean lifetime for polarons of τ = 60.7 ms for blends of P3HT/3.0 nm CdSe spherical nanocrystals (blended with ∼90% nanocrystals in weight).273 An example of the frequency dependence of PIA spectra is shown in Fig. 15.
 Fig. 15  Frequency dependence of the photo-induced absorption (PIA) peak at 1.22 eV, due to localized polarons for blends P3HT/PCBM (50% of PCBM in weight) and P3HT/CdSe (∼90% of nanocrystals in weight). Measures were taken at 80 K at a laser power of 30 mW cm−2. Dashed and full lines are fits to the data using bimolecular (eqn (3)) and dispersive (eqn (4)) recombination models.

5.3 Conduction mechanisms
The most common method of charge transport characterisation in a given material is to measure the electrical current as a function of applied voltage at room temperature. An external voltage is applied to the device through chosen electrodes and the outgoing current is measured. For recording the current–voltage characteristics under illumination, light is shone through a transparent conducting electrode (e.g. a glass substrate covered with transparent conducting oxide such as Indium Tin Oxide, ITO), see Scheme 17. In measurements directed towards testing new hybrid materials as potential components of photovoltaic cells, the used light source usually mimicks the solar spectrum. For other purposes it can have a definite wavelength (that allows selective excitation of the smaller gap component of the hybrid).
 Scheme 17  Typical sample architecture for photocurrent measurements. 
In composites of this type, a rectifying behaviour is usually obtained (Scheme 18), owing to the asymmetry of the top and bottom electrodes or of the active layer itself. Fitting this rectifying current–voltage characteristics with the simple equations (eqn (5) and (6)) presented below, as well as the application of impedance spectroscopy, gives access to the equivalent circuit elements, characterizing a given material in the dark or under illumination, as shown in Scheme 18.
 Scheme 18  Electrical modelisation of hybrid devices: equivalent circuit of hybrid devices and current–voltage characteristics in the dark and under illumination (in linear and semi-logarithmic scales). The asymmetrical behaviour is observed only when the active layer or the electrodes present an asymmetry (see for example ref. 264 and 296). The fill factor is defined as the orange area (Isc × Voc) divided by the purple area (the maximal rectangular area delimited by the I–V curve in the lower right quadrant). 

5.3.1 Equivalent circuit representations. 
 

Dark current–voltage characteristics
            . 
Equivalent circuit diagram characterizations aim at studying hybrids at the device scale and are often performance-oriented. The whole device can be modelled as a diode in series with a resistor (the series resistor Rs) and in parallel with a resistor (the shunt resistor Rsh) and a capacitance. The latter is negligible in steady-state conditions and for this reason not shown in Scheme 18. The slope of the dark I(V) at zero voltage corresponds to the inverse of the shunt resistance and in an ideal case, i.e. without any short circuits between electrodes bypassing the active layer and in the absence of current leakage, Rsh is infinite. The slope at infinite voltages corresponds to the inverse of the series resistor Rs, which is zero in an ideal case where the contact and bulk resistance of the active layer can be neglected.
Under the hypothesis of an Ohmic contact and a Schottky barrier (metal–semiconductor) contact, current–voltage characteristics can be fitted to a modified Shockley equation to obtain values of the shunt resistor Rsh and the series resistor Rs, both in Ω: (5)where I is the current in the external circuit (and in Rs) in A, V the applied voltage in V, Us the voltage at the series resistor in V, and I0 the saturation current in A. n is the ideality factor and lies between 1 for an ideal diode (no loss mechanisms) and 2 for a device dominated by losses, e.g. by recombination processes. This equation can be written considering the current density in A cm−2, in which case the resistances are in Ω cm2, see for example ref. 297.
Dridi et al. studied 30–40 nm thick films of MEH-PPV containing TiO2 nanocrystals by impedance spectroscopy.297 In the dark, a series resistance Rs = 1.009 Ω cm2, a shunt resistance Rsh = 17.145 MΩ cm2 and an interfacial capacitance (in parallel) of the order of pF were found, indicating that insulating barriers (e.g. due to oxides or air gaps at the Al electrode) could be considered as negligible.

Current–voltage characteristics under illumination
            . 
Under illumination, hybrids tend to generate electrical currents so one adds a current generator to the above equivalent circuit picture. The current–voltage characteristics can, in this case, be described as: (6)
Shunt and series resistors have similar physical meanings as in the previous case. A short circuit current Isc (at V = 0 V) and an open circuit voltage Voc (at I = 0 A) appear with light irradiation. The area under the curve in the quadrant [V > 0, I < 0] corresponds to the electrical power extracted from the device. The parameters Rs, Rsh, I0 and n characterize the performances of the device (together with the fill factor, see Scheme 18, Voc and Isc) and give hints on physical processes at play within the active layer.
Huynh et al. studied the resistivity of thin films of P3HT containing 90 wt% of 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods as a function of the film thickness.271 They found that a light-intensity dependent shunt resistor better described the system than an Ohmic one. The shunt photo-conductance (Rsh light − Rsh dark)−1 increased linearly with the light intensity from 10−7 Ω−1 cm−2 to 10−2 Ω−1 cm−2 for intensities varying from 0.01 mW cm−2 to 500 mW cm−2, indicating larger current leakages for higher light intensities.


5.3.2 Electrical transport regimes from the current–voltage characteristics. 
In thin films of nanocrystals, the transport is found to occur via hopping, which is a thermally activated process, and to present space-charge limitations due to slow electrons. For example, Ginger and Greenham found electron mobilities of 10−4 to 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1 in thin films of TOPO-coated CdSe nanocrystals.298 As indicated in Section 2.3, the surface ligand exchange after deposition of nanocrystal multilayers has been used to increase the charge carrier mobilies. To give a recent example, Liu et al. studied charge carrier mobilities in field effect transistors whose channels consisted of thin films of PbSe nanocrystals treated chemically. For 6.1 nm nanocrystals treated with ethanedithiol, the electrons (holes) reached a mobility of 0.07 cm2 V−1s−1 (0.03 cm2 V−1s−1).124
In thin films of polymers, hole transport is also field-dependent and temperature activated. Typical mobilities measured for P3HT films are in the range of 10−1 to 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 and for MEH-PPV 10−6 to 10−7 cm2 V−1s−1 (e.g.ref. 259,299 and 300). They are strongly influenced by the molecular mass of the polymer and the morphology of the deposited layer.301

Applied field dependence of dark and photo-currents
            . 
Applied field dependence of dark current. 
The seminal study of Alivisatos' group on the dark current in thin films of 90% in weight 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods embedded in P3HT showed that the dark current analysis in terms of equivalent circuit is good enough for low applied voltages.271 For higher voltages (from 0.7 V for 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods in P3HT), the series resistance does not show an Ohmic behaviour. The presence of charges with poor mobility induces space-charge effects: they are not evacuated fast enough and accumulate, screening the electric field (reducing the effective field probed by the charges). This indicates that low mobilities of carriers limit the transport out of the film. This so-called “space-charge effect” implies a drop of the bulk heterojunction potential. The current in the non-Ohmic series resistor can be expressed as: (7)where the first term of the sum is the Ohmic term (dominant at low voltages) and the second term takes into account the space-charge-induced potential drop in the bulk. a is the electrode surface, µ the carrier mobility, ε the permittivity of the sample, Ntr the trap density, and d the film thickness. With the second term modified to account for the field dependence of the mobility, the previous equation becomes:271,302 (8)C is a temperature dependent parameter.
In this case the Shockley equation (eqn (5)) can be rewritten as follows: (9)where Vb is defined as in eqn (8).
Huynh et al. included high field effects i.e. field-dependent mobility and space-charge to fit dark current–voltage characteristics for P3HT/7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorod hybrids as well as for 8 × 13 nm CdSe nanorod/P3HT samples.303
In samples of CdS nanopillars embedded in a MEH-PPV matrix, Yang et al. found a good agreement between their current–voltage characteristics and eqn (6) for low voltages (0.1 < V < 1 V) and observed a large discrepancy between the calculated and measured data at higher voltages.267 Their analysis has also led to the conclusion that low mobility of holes in the polymer induces space-charge effects.
Applied field dependence of photocurrent. 
The photocurrent corrected for dark current is also called “external quantum efficiency” (EQE, the number of collected electrons in the external circuit per incident photon). Huynh et al. measured the EQE as a function of applied voltage in hybrids of P3HT and 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods (90 wt% of nanocrystals).303 From relatively high values (from 60% to 50%) for reverse bias, it fell drastically to very low ones at forward bias. Forward bias creates a field that opposes the built-in electric field, and the effective field is lowered. Therefore the number of collected electrons is lower as a result of the diminution of their mobility and the increase of their recombination efficiency.
Watt et al. studied the hole transport in blends of MEH-PPV and 4 nm spherical surfactant-free PbS nanocrystals, synthesized in situ in MEH-PPV, as a function of the applied field. They compared it to the hole transport in pristine MEH-PPV265 and found that the hole transport is much less field dependent in the blends than that in the pure polymer devices.

Temperature dependence of dark and photocurrents
            . 
 
Temperature dependence of dark current. 
Huynh et al. studied the temperature dependence of dark current in the temperature range between 298 K and 453 K in a P3HT/CdSe nanorod hybrid containing 90 wt% of nanocrystals.271 The saturation current I0 increased with temperature and could be fitted by a thermally activated current I0 ∝ eϕ/kT with two different activation energies, ϕ = 0.35 eV for lower temperatures and ϕ =1.47 eV for higher temperatures. The latter roughly corresponds to the band gap of the used nanocrystals.
Temperature dependence of photocurrent. 
Greenham et al. investigated the temperature dependence of the short circuit current for a device containing 5% in weight of 5 nm CdSe nanocrystals in P3HT using an illumination at 514 nm.112 The recorded curves presented a reproducible hysteresis between cooling and warming phases. The current at 298 K was of the order of 200 nA and decreased to 40 nA at 10 K. This rather small fivefold decrease indicates that the conduction is not strongly thermally activated up to room temperature. The authors argue that the recombination is governed by the morphology of the films.

Dependence of photocurrent on the illumination parameters
            . 
Dependence of photocurrent on light intensity. 
Increasing the light intensity tends to increase the number of generated excitons and eventually of free charges. However, after an initial increase of the photocurrent, it starts to decrease. This phenomenon is attributed to recombination processes and will be discussed in the next paragraph.271
The increase of photocurrent with light intensity is accompanied by an increase of the open circuit voltage Voc.112,267,271 It reaches a saturation plateau at large illumination intensities. In ref. 112, the authors studied hybrids consisting of 5 nm CdSe nanocrystals (90% in weight) in MEH-PPV for different illumination intensities. For intensities higher than 500 µW cm−2 (up to the highest measured intensity of 50 mW cm−2), the reported saturation plateau of Voc was in the range 0.5–0.6 eV, and corresponded to the work function difference between the used Al (4.3 eV) and ITO (ca. 4.7–4.9 eV) electrodes.
To the contrary, for 90% in weight 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods in P3HT illuminated by a 514 nm source,271 and for CdS nanopillar arrays embedded in MEH-PPV,267 the maximal Voc exceeds the differences in the work functions of the electrodes and also the difference between the electron affinity of the acceptor and the ionization potential of the donor. In both cases, the authors explain this discrepancy by the pinning of the Fermi level at an interface. In the case of P3HT/CdSe the calculated pinning of the Al electrode to the lowest unoccupied energy level of CdSe nanocrystals gave an effective maximal Voc of 0.85 eV, in agreement with the experimental data. In the case of MEH-PPV/CdS the calculated value was 0.5 eV, also in agreement with the experimental data, but no saturation plateau was observed for Voc even at the highest measured light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.267
Spectral dependence of photocurrent. 
Monitoring the photocurrent as a function of illumination wavelength gives clues about the relative efficiencies of light to current conversion for a photon of given energy. Depending on the absorbance spectrum of the active layer, photons of different wavelengths penetrate more or less deeply before being absorbed. In strongly absorbing layers, excitons are formed close to the transparent electrode/semiconducting layer interface. However, at the same time this process heightens the density of excitons and charges in this area, which leads to the enhanced recombination and lowering of the effective field. These phenomena impede, to a large extent, efficient exciton dissociation and transport of electrons towards the metallic electrode.
Greenham et al. noticed that for low CdSe nanocrystals/MEH-PPV mass ratios, a peak in the photocurrent occurs in a spectral region where the optical density of the semiconducting nanocomposite is low and light is thus absorbed far inside the layer.112 For higher ratios, the photocurrent spectrum follows the absorption spectrum, indicating that the percolating network of nanocrystals facilitates exciton dissociation and electrons transport to the metallic electrode. This parallelism between absorption and current action spectra is used as an indicator of efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport and may serve to optimize the hybrid counterpart contents and the film thickness.303
Convincing examples are found in the field of infrared photodetectors. McDonald et al. prepared hybrids of MEH-PPV and 5 nm PbS nanocrystals capped with octylamine.304 The maximum of the MEH-PPV absorption peak was located at 522 nm, whereas the nanocrystals first excitonic peak occurred at 1262 nm (but with a much lower optical density), consistent with the assumption of the superposition of the spectra of both components. Since the photocurrent of the composite started to increase steadily from 1400 nm with decreasing wavelength, it could be concluded that an efficient charge generation was induced in a spectral region not absorbed by the polymer (cf.Scheme 19). The nanocrystals served, in this case, as sensitizers and the polymeric phase as a charge transporting medium.
 Scheme 19  Typical aspect of the EQE spectrum as compared to the absorption spectra of the polymeric and nanocrystals components of a hybrid containing low band gap nanocrystals (NCs). 
Similar results were found by Rauch et al. who studied ternary blends of P3HT:PCBM and 4.5 nm PbS nanocrystals.149 A peak in the EQE spectrum was found at 1220 nm, attributed to the first excitonic nanocrystals peak (none of the other components absorbed at this wavelength).

Electronic coupling between the hybrid components
            . 
Electrical transport in hybrids strongly depends on the coupling between the two phases constituting the hybrid and also between the individual nanocrystals. It is therefore influenced by the film supramolecular organisation and morphology. Furthermore, the electronic coupling between the polymer and nanocrystals is strongly affected by the nanocrystals capping ligands. Insulating ligands will tend to trap one type of charges in the inorganic island-like phase, thus limiting the recombination and transport. Smaller or conductive ligands offer a much smaller energy barrier to overcome and facilitate the separation and diffusion of charges.
Charge retention: hysteresis in the current–voltage characteristics. 
The weak coupling between the hybrid components can lead to a hysteresis in the electrical characteristics of the hybrid. This phenomenon corresponds to an electrical bistability, which is frequently exploited in memory devices. Recent papers of Wei and collaborators described memory effects due to the electrical bistability from charge retention in hybrids of polymers and nanocrystals. In ref. 275, hybrid thin films of P3HT/2.85 nm CdSe nanocrystals and P3HT-only devices were studied in gated geometries. The current–voltage characteristics presented a much larger hysteresis under illumination than in the dark. This behaviour was postulated to be a consequence of trapped charges.
The same group pursued these studies with the goal to improve the charge retention. For this purpose they used type I CdSe/ZnSe core/shell nanocrystals (2.85 nm core) embedded in a P3HT matrix.276 In these nanocrystals, the energy band alignment of the core and shell material induces confinement of the electrons and holes in the core (see Scheme 1). As expected, the current after illumination was higher than in the case of control samples containing 2.85 nm CdSe core nanocrystals without a shell.
Ham et al. also presented the core/shell nanocrystals/polymer approach for memory devices.282 They measured current–voltage characteristics of 100 nm thick films of (insulating) PMMA containing 80 wt% of InP/ZnS nanocrystals but without any gate voltage. They observed low conductivity for low applied voltages (currents up to 1 nA for voltages between 0 and 1.5 V) and high conductivity when the voltage sweep reached 1.5 V. This change was not reversible for the applied voltages between −5 V and +5 V, with currents in the µA–mA range. The authors attributed the change in conductivity to trapped charge carriers acting as space charges. The high conductivity I(V) curve could be fitted by a space charge limited currentI ∝ V2.
Current dependence on time after illumination changes. 
Thin films of P3HT/2.85 nm CdSe nanocrystals and P3HT-only devices in FET geometries were illuminated for several seconds.275 After turning off the light, the relaxation of charges was studied. In the control device (P3HT only), all charges relaxed quickly. On the other hand, in the hybrids, after a rapid relaxation phase, the current stabilized at a non-zero value. This behaviour seems to originate from a rapid de-trapping in the gate oxide and at the gate oxide–P3HT interface, followed by a second phase where charges stay trapped on nanocrystals, leaving the device in a metastable state of enhanced conductivity.
Zhang et al. electrically characterized hybrid devices consisting of blends of MEH-PPV and octylamine treated PbS nanocrystals (80 wt% nanocrystals).305 They annealed their samples at different temperatures up to 220 °C, exceeding both the octylamine boiling point (175 °C) and the MEH-PPV glass transition (215 °C). The current intensity rose with increasing annealing temperature. Moreover, switching the laser illumination on (off) caused a rise (decay) of the measured short circuit current. The difference of temporal evolution of the dark and photocurrent at zero bias resulted from charge trapping and release. The rise (decay) was much shorter in the case of annealed samples than in the case of unannealed ones. For example, the characteristic rise time of the photocurrent was 1.7 ms for annealed hybrid thin films, more than ten times smaller than the 18 ms measured for unannealed ones. This was explained by the partial deprotection of nanocrystals.
Similar charge retention phenomena leading to the electrical bistability have been widely studied in organic matrices containing metallic (e.g.gold nanoparticles306) or organic dopants. The performances of such memories, as well as the mechanisms of their functioning, have been reviewed by several groups.307–309 Bistability effects in materials implying the use of nanocrystals in non-polymer matrices have also been reported. Fischbein and Drndic310 and Mohanta et al.311 reported on the bistability in thin films of CdSe nanocrystals surrounded by their initial surface ligands. In the first example, the dependence of the electrical behaviour on the irradiation conditions was investigated. In the second one, the impedance spectroscopy allowed demonstrating that the effective dielectric constant increased during the transistion from low-to-high conduction states.

Percolation
            . 
 
Increasing the efficiency of transport to the electrodes by increasing the nanocrystals/polymer weight ratio. 
As already indicated, in most studied hybrid materials, nanocrystals act as electron acceptors and the organic phase as the electron donor according to the staggered energy band alignment displayed in Scheme 15. The transport efficiency is limited by the lowest mobility carriers. Electrons inside individual nanocrystals have a larger mobility than holes in the polymeric phase. Nonetheless, the existence of an efficient transport route from the dissociation point to the electrode is not necessarily assured for electrons due to the granular and dispersed nature of the nanocrystal phase.
Numerous experiments show that the transport efficiency increases with increasing nanocrystal proportion up to an optimal polymer/nanocrystals ratio. For hybrids with “standard” polymers such as P3HT, MEH-PPV, e.g. having no specific interaction with pyridine treated nanocrystals, the optimal weight ratio has been determined as 1: 9 (polymer:nanocrystals).111,112,266,274,278 This improved efficiency is attributed to the formation of a percolating network within the nanocrystal phase. In the case of amine end-functionalized P3HT, the optimum ratio is much lower (around 1: 1).206 Here the affinity of the amine group for the nanocrystals surface results in a better control of the phase segregation than in the case of the pristine polymer.
Increasing the efficiency of transport to the electrodes by optimizing the shape and orientation of nanocrystals. 
Percolation is also improved by use of anisotropic nanocrystals such as nanorods,110,111 tetrapods,279,281 or hyperbranched nanocrystals.272 Very recently, Dayal et al. studied the influence of nanocrystals' shape on device performances and on microwave photoconductivity measurements.312 Spherical, nanorod and tetrapod CdSe nanocrystals of comparable characteristic dimensions (the smallest dimension being 4.5 nm, the length of the rods' and tetrapods' arms being around 30–50 nm) were used in blends with P3HT. Concerning device performances, the short circuit current increased from spherical nanocrystals over nanorods to tetrapods, while the open circuit voltage decreased. The fill factor was superior in the case of tetrapods. This improvement in the device performance was correlated with time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. In these measurements, the sample is placed in a microwave cavity at its resonance. The dielectrical properties of the sample, among others the photoconductivity of carriers, modify the cavity resonance. This pump-probe technique thus allows probing dynamically and locally the photogenerated carriers' conductance by measuring the variation of the reflected power of the cavity. Rod- and tetrapod-based hybrid devices exhibited larger photoconductivity transients at long times than dot-based samples. This finding was ascribed to the existence of longer-lived photogenerated carriers. The authors suggested that the efficiency of mobilecarrier generation (in other words: the efficiency of charge separation or the efficiency of generation of long-lived, free charge carriers) increases the photocurrent in samples containing anisotropic nanocrystals, rather than the percolation itself. In the case of tetrapod-based samples, additional improvement results from a more efficient percolation. The problem of forming a percolating network for the charge carriers can be circumvented by building arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.267,280
Bicontinuous interpenetrating network shown by impedance spectroscopy. 
In impedance spectroscopy, real and imaginary parts of the effective complex impedance Z of the device are recorded as a function of frequency ω. As was mentioned earlier, modeling this couple Re[Z(ω) + jIm[Z(ω)] by an equivalent circuit facilitates the description of the device in terms of resistors, capacitors and inductors.
Huang et al. studied thin films of blends of MEH-PPV with different loadings of 5 nm spherical CdSe nanocrystals by impedance spectroscopy.266 At low frequencies for low nanocrystal concentrations, they observed negative imaginary impedance. This phenomenon is more generally associated with inductive effects and has been explained in the cited paper by the existence of transient space charge at the interface between MEH-PPV and CdSe caused by poor evacuation of electrons into the nanocrystal phase. The negative imaginary part of the impedance vanished at higher concentrations of nanocrystals, in parallel to a decrease of the real effective impedance (corresponding to the resistance). This finding seems to indicate that an efficient interpenetrating network has been formed by increasing the nanocrystals concentration from 83 wt% to 90 or 94 wt%.


5.3.3 Effective mobilities and densities of charge carriers. 
There exist several methods for the measurement of charge mobilities. The most frequently used in conjugated polymers are: space charge limited current (SCLC), time of flight (TOF) or measurements of field effect transistor whose channel consists of the semiconductor being studied (FET configuration).313 The latter techniques will briefly be described here as they have also been applied to hybrids.
Time-of-flight experiments imply the use of a sample such as the one presented in Scheme 17. The device is illuminated by means of a laser pulse and the type of charge-carrier is selected by applying a bias on the sample. The recorded transient current exhibits a maximum at a “transfer” time ttr. The mobility can then be calculated using eqn (10): (10)where d is the film thickness and E is the applied field.

Choudhury et al. used the TOF technique to determine the hole mobility as a function of electric field and film thickness in blends of PVK and pyridine treated CdS nanocrystals (diameter < 14 nm).286 The obtained values lied between 10−7 and 3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1, i.e. close to the values obtained in TOF measurements of pristine PVK.314
Watt et al. studied hole and electron mobilities in thin films of a hybrid consisting of 4 nm spherical surfactant-free PbS nanocrystals and MEH-PPV—the nanocrystals are synthesized in situ in the polymer—and found that electron and hole mobilities are well balanced in these blends. Furthermore, blending enhances both mobilities, which have been determined by TOF in pure MEH-PPV as µh MEH-PPV = 2.83 (±0.11) × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1 and µe MEH-PPV = 1.8 (±0.1) × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1 (values obtained for 4945 V cm−1 electric field).
A FET device has three distinct electrodes, as shown in Scheme 20. The drain and source electrodes are used to apply voltage and measure current. The gate electrode is located on the whole area of the active layer (in this case called “channel”) and separated from it by a thin dielectric layer. The application of a gate voltage allows depletion or accumulation of one type of carriers in the channel of the active layer.

The drain–source current Ids is expressed as a function of the gate–source voltage Vgs using eqn (11): (11)where W is the width and L the length of the channel, C the gate oxide capacitance and Vth the threshold voltage. From this so-called “transfer characteristics” in the saturated regime, the mobility of holes can be found.
Chen et al. reported typical p-channel FET characteristics for P3HT/3.5 nm CdSe nanocrystals hybrids:275 the current was dominated by hole transport. The same group found hole mobilities of 4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 for P3HT-only devices, 8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 for P3HT/2.85 nm core CdSe nanocrystals devices (∼90 wt% nanocrystals) and 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1 for devices containing P3HT and CdSe/ZnSe core/shell nanocrystals (core diameter 2.85 nm, ∼90 wt% nanocrystals).276
Rauch et al. investigated ternary mixtures of P3HT, PCBM and 4.5 nm PbS nanocrystals.149 Their devices exhibited ambipolar transport with mobilities up to µh = 4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 and µe = 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1 found in FET geometry measurements. They showed that both P3HT and PCBM were necessary to achieve efficient nanocrystals exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transport. PCBM is the electron transporter (its LUMO level matches that of the nanocrystals) and P3HT is the hole-transporting phase (its HOMO level matches that of the nanocrystals). Therefore the obtained devices showed the transport features of all-organic heterojunctions with additional sensitivity to infrared light due to the presence of PbS nanocrystals.

Chen et al. estimated the increase ΔN in the carrier density between dark and light characteristics using eqn (12):275 (12)with Ci the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric layer, e the electron charge and ΔVth the shift of Vth between dark and light transfer characteristics. The obtained values were ΔN = 4.51 × 1011 cm−2 for P3HT only devices and ΔN = 1.39 × 1012 cm−2 for P3HT/3.5 nm CdSe nanocrystals devices.

5.4 Recombination processes
When describing experimental techniques used to determine the exciton and photo-excitation lifetimes in previous sections, we gave hints on how to identify the types of recombinations that occur in different types of hybrid materials. Indeed, two processes shorten the photo-excitation lifetimes: recombination processes and current collection at the electrodes. The latter process is, in itself, a recombination process that permits charge neutrality conservation in the device. It is not distinguishable from trap-assisted recombination processes or from those taking place at the heterojunction interface. To the contrary, spectroscopic characterisations necessitate neither current collection nor the use of electrodes. Thus they allow studying recombination processes independently from current collection. Still, it must be noted that the interface between the active layer and electrodes can be considered as a preferable site for traps and thus might give rise to trap-assisted recombinations.
Recombination is the main process limiting efficient charge transport in the active layer. One distinguishes between different types of recombination: (i) monomolecular (geminate) recombination implies that an electron and a hole, originating from the same exciton, recombine as favored by Coulomb attraction; (ii) bimolecular recombination (also called Langevin recombination) involves an electron and a hole originating from different excitons; (iii) trap assisted recombination arises when an electron (hole) recombines at a defect state lying lower (higher) in energy. Recombination should thus depend on densities of defects and charge-carriers. The monomolecular (geminate) recombination rate is proportional to the density of excitons Nexc (i.e.Rmono = kmono·Nexc). The bimolecular (Langevin) recombination rate, Rbim, is proportional to the product of the densities of electrons and holes, NP or equivalently to the square of the exciton density Nexc2. The trap assisted recombination rate, Rtr, depends on the trap density, Ntr, the hole and electron densities.267 Consequently, the exciton density evolves like eqn (13): (13)where kgen is the generation rate of excitons, i is the light intensity and kdiss the dissociation rate of excitons.
The elements of this formula are taken from the different domains of organic and inorganic semiconductors and the authors suggest that the validity of all hypotheses should be checked thoroughly.267 For example, in hybrids, the charge-carrier densities are not uniform throughout the device: N is the electron density in the nanocrystal phase, P the hole density in the polymer, in the vicinity of inorganic interfaces for bimolecular recombination and in the vicinity of traps for trap-assisted recombination.

5.4.1 Types of defects. 
Photoluminescence measurements. 
Some types of defects in nanocrystals or in the polymer can be detected by photoluminescence measurements. Yang et al. observed two photoluminescence peaks at 1.8 eV and 2.4 eV in a CdS nanopillar array without polymer.267 These peaks are present at room temperature as well as at 12 K and were attributed to sulfur vacancy defects and intersticial sulfur defects, respectively.

Electron spin resonance
            . 
An electron spin resonance signal in the dark also indicates the presence of unpaired spins in the material. While Pientka et al. reported no dark signals in pure MDMO-PPV, CdSe nanocrystals or InP nanocrystals, indicating quasi-defect-free organic and inorganic components,268 Dietmueller et al. observed unpaired spins due to dangling bonds of 33 nm Si nanocrystals in disordered medium and positive polarons in P3HT, even in the dark.277


5.4.2 Electroluminescence. 
The high colour purity and accordable luminescence of nanocrystals make them promising candidates for electroluminescent devices: electrically injected charges recombine radiatively under photon emission.

Temperature dependence of electroluminescence
            . 
Dabbousi et al. studied the electroluminescence of blends of MEH-PPV and t-Bu-PBD (60 wt% of MEH-PPV) with 3.2, 4.0 and 6.0 nm CdSe nanocrystals (5–10% volume fraction of nanocrystals) as a function of temperature.296 The electroluminescence as well as the photoluminescence increased with decreasing temperature. This effect was attributed to the lower efficiency of non-radiative recombination pathways when the temperature drops. The electroluminescence increase saturated between 50 K and 10 K, contrarily to the photoluminescence that increased steadily. The electroluminescence saturation arised probably from the drop of the charge mobilities in MEH-PPV (hole transporting component) and t-Bu-PBD (electron transporting component) with decreasing temperature.

Applied voltage dependence of electroluminescence
            . 
Gao et al. studied thin films prepared by alternate deposition of soluble PPV precursor layers and CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals (core diameter 3.7 nm), followed by thermal conversion of the polymeric precursor to PPV.261 The electroluminescence recorded for this composite showed a peak around 660 nm, a signature of the nanocrystals. No contribution from the polymer was observed. The threshold voltages for electroluminescence were between 3.5 V and 5 V. The use of insulating PAH, instead of PPV as the organic component, allowed better understanding of the role of the polymer. The electroluminescence was identical but the threshold voltage was shifted to a value of 10 V. Thus, it was demonstrated that the polymer film served mostly as a charge transporting layer rather than a photon emitting one.

Nanocrystals' loading dependence of electroluminescence
            . 
Tessler et al. described near-infrared electroluminescent devices made of blends of InAs/ZnSe core/shell (core diameter 4 nm) nanocrystals with MEH-PPV or F6BT.263 Similar to in the previous case, the luminescence of hybrids originated mainly from the nanocrystal component of the hybrid. The threshold voltage and the intensity of the electroluminescence peak increased with the content of nanocrystals in the hybrid. The photoluminescence of the polymer was quenched by a factor of 5 in blends of a 1:1 volume ratio, indicating an energy transfer from the polymer to the nanocrystals. Both observed phenomena were attributed to bipolar charge trapping on the nanocrystals.


5.4.3 Recombination of photogenerated charges at energetic interfaces. 
Since the densities of photogenerated excitons, electrons and holes can be related to the number of absorbed photons, recombination processes must depend on the light intensity.

Photocurrent dependence on light intensity
            . 
One way to study recombination processes is to record current–voltage characteristics as a function of the illumination intensity. As predicted by eqn (13), the linear dependence of the short circuit photocurrent Isc as a function of light intensity i can be treated as an indication of a monomolecular recombination, whereas sublinear dependence indicates the domination of bimolecular processes.267,271 The simple model outlined above indeed suggests that higher intensities imply higher charge densities due to low mobilities and thus an increased probability of electrostatic interaction between charges.
Greenham et al. found an approximately linear dependence of Isc on the light intensity i for low intensities (Isc ∝ i0.9) in samples of MEH-PPV blended with 90 wt% of 5 nm CdSe nanocrystals.112 They attributed this finding to a fixed number of recombination centers, identified as “dead ends” of the nanocrystals' percolation paths. At higher light intensities, Isc became sublinear (Isc ∝ i0.65).
In blends of 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods and P3HT, illuminated with 514 nm light, the current density as a function of light intensity was found to be slightly sublinear, especially at intensities larger than 10 mW cm−2.271 Also in composites of CdS nanopillars and MEH-PPV a sublinear Isc dependence on light intensity was found for all intensities.267 This observation is consistent with the presence of traps in the system inducing large trap-assisted (thus bimolecular) recombinations. Moreover, the fact that bimolecular recombination occurs by confinement at a two-dimensional interface should be taken into account. Yang et al. suggested consequently the application of a modified Langevin-like formula for two-dimensional bimolecular recombination.267,315
The open circuit voltage Voc also depends on the light intensity. This intensity dependence can be included in the short circuit Isc(i), so that Voc can be written as: (14)where, as indicated before, n is the ideality factor and Isc and I0 respectively the short circuit current and the saturation current. Fitting Voc to the data gives an ideality factor of 1.57 for the 7 × 60 nm CdSe nanorods/P3HT hybrids271 and an ideality factor of 2 for the CdS nanopillars/MEH-PPV composite.267 These high ideality factor values confirm the domination of loss mechanisms.

PIA
 dependence on light intensity
            . 
To distinguish between mono- and bi-molecular recombinations, one should consider the low-frequency range of PIA signals (see eqn (2) and (3)). In this regime, monomolecular recombination pathways yield linear dependence on light intensity whereas bimolecular recombination processes imply a square-root dependence on light intensity.
In blends of MDMO-PPV and 4.1 nm CdSe nanocrystals as well as in blends or MDMO-PPV and 4.2 nm InP nanocrystals, Pientka et al. found a monomolecular recombination regime for low illumination intensities (up to 1 mW cm−2) and a bimolecular recombination regime for larger light intensities.268 This finding was consistent with larger charge-carrier densities at higher illumination intensities, giving rise to an increased probability of meeting the opposite charge.
In hybrids of PFE and 3.2 nm CdSe nanocrystals, Tseng et al. found a −ΔT/T ∝ i−0.61 relationship which they interpreted as a signature of bimolecular recombination regime with a distribution of lifetimes.283

5.5 Summary and discussion
In summary, the electronic properties of hybrid materials consisting of conjugated polymers and semiconducting nanocrystals have been studied with various experimental techniques in the last fifteen years. Spectroscopic studies allow the characterisation of the hybrid materials on their own, whereas electrical measurements strongly depend on the film morphology, on the interfaces with the electrodes and on the electrode materials. Exciton generation upon illumination has been proved by the appearance of photo-induced absorption bands.268 The lifetimes of these excitons have been studied by photoluminescence decay experiments266,270 and PIA frequency measurements.262,268 Their diffusion seems to be thermally activated.284 Whereas photoluminescence quenching indicates the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers or energy transfer (i.e. creation of an exciton on the lower gap component of the hybrid),262,270,273 only positive polarons on the polymers have been observed by light-induced electron spin resonance268,273 and photo-induced absorption262,268,270,283 and no sign of their negative counterparts has been detected yet. The positive polarons exhibited long lifetimes that are distributed in such wide ranges as the micro- to milli-second range or longer, as found by LESR signal decay studies and PIA frequency measurements. The latter tend to indicate dispersive recombination processes in the most recent studies.273,285 Electrical characterisations exploring a wide range of parameters such as temperature and light intensity have been rather rare until now.112,267,271 Dark and photocurrents have been described by a space charge limited current model associated with a field dependent mobility. Temperature dependence indicated the thermal activation for energies correponding to material parameters. Studies of the current dependence on the illumination wavelength gave mostly an absorbance sensitizer role to the nanocrystals rather than the desired electron transport role.149,264 Current hystereses have been reported when scanning the applied voltage back and forth.275,276,282 These hystereses are more important when nanocrystals are decoupled, either by the use of type I core/shell nanocrystals or of insulating surface ligands, or by blending them with an insulating polymer and are attributed to nanocrystals' charging. Finally, mobilities have been measured by time-of-flight measurements265,286 and with field effect transistor configuration.149,275,276 The obtained hole mobilities were relatively close to those measured in pristine polymer films, with the exception of ref. 265, where the nanocrystals were directly synthetized in the polymer matrix. The transport was dominated by holes in the hybrids investigated in these reports. Recombination is likely to be the dominating efficiency-limiting process in hybrid materials. It has been shown to be dispersive in many samples by studying the short circuit photocurrent as a function of light intensity, either monomolecular at low light intensities (low charge-carrier density) or bimolecular at higher light intensities. These findings are coherent with the widely distributed lifetimes of free charge carriers mentioned above, as well as with the idea that hybrid materials are of highly disordered nature. In contrast with all-organic blends (e.g. with PCBM as an electron acceptor), electrons have neither been detected spectroscopically so far nor have charge transport studies shown their large contribution. Many efforts are underway to improve the transport by enhancing mobilities through the use of anisotropic nanocrystals and crystalline polymers and through reducing trapping and recombinations. However, these novel and hopefully higher-performance hybrid materials have to be submitted to the various studies described above in order to be able to understand the factors governing their electrical properties.
Doing so, one should be aware of the limitations of each type of experiments and of the fragility of the asumptions made in usual models. Indeed, two characteristics of hybrids influence largely charge transport and thus device efficiency: (i) they are made of two or more components of very different chemical nature that are electronically coupled and (ii) they are at least partly disordered. One should thus bear in mind that the usual asumptions that were made to develop the most common models of transport might not be verified in the case of hybrids.
For example, Drude's conductivity model was developped for ordered inorganic materials in the framework of the drift-diffusion model, where charge carriers are considered to be free or “delocalized” (i.e. the mean free path between collisions is much larger than Bloch's wavelength of the carrier). In organic semiconductors, disorder leads to spatially localized states.316 These are described by non-uniform densities of states from the fluctuations in state energies and by electronic coupling distributions from the fluctuations in the interactions between sites via various wavefunction overlaps.
Although the mobility concept arose from the analysis of ordered materials, it is widely applied to organic semiconductors, nanocrystal assemblies and hybrid thin films. It has been shown that the mobility in organic semiconductors depends strongly on diverse parameters: temperature, disorder and impurities, electrical field, charge carrier densities, and so on (see ref. 313 for a review of mobility measurements and calculations in organic semiconductors). For this reason, it should be noted that mobilities measured by different techniques are supposed to be different. For example, in ref. 317 it is shown that the hole mobilities in PPV derivatives obtained via field effect transistor measurements are very different from those derived from space charge limited current (diode configuration). One reason for this difference is the strong possibility of increasing the charge carrier densities in the FET configuration. Moreover, the larger the surface of the investigated sample, the stronger the mobility depends on material's order and purity.313 These discrepancies arise from different measurement configurations.
On the other hand, when a quantity is measured many times in similar experimental conditions, the variability of its value often leads to averaging procedures. Averaging over many events is not convincing if the dispersion of the studied quantity values is large compared to the quantity itself.260 For this reason, studies in the field of organic semiconductors led to suggest the use of mobility distribution functions to reflect spatially dispersive transport processes.318,319
Finally, the apparition of localized states having energies inside the forbidden energy band, blurs the strict notion of the energy band gap. The localized states exhibit very restricted mobility in comparison to delocalized states, so it has been proposed to use a forbidden mobility region rather than a strict energy band gap concept.320,321 These considerations were formulated in the quest of understanding disordered systems, more particularly in the case of organic semiconductor thin films, and should most probably also be relevant for future studies of hybrid materials.
6 Application of hybrids in solar cells
Solar cells are devices, which transform solar radiation energy into electricity. In Section 5 the electrical properties of related devices, namely photodetectors, were also presented. These devices change their conductivity depending on the illumination conditions and will not be discussed here. For more details on this topic, we refer the reader to Section 7.2 of ref. 258.
The simplest organic solar cell consists of a layer of an appropriate conjugated polymer (oligomer) sandwiched between two electrodes of different work functions. One of these electrodes must be transparent since the radiation must reach the semiconductor layer. Upon radiation excitons are formed in this layer which then dissociate. The holes and electrons formed in the dissociation process migrate to the electrodes creating the difference of potentials. In this simple device, however, the photoinduced charge generation—the key parameter of the cell operation—is extremely inefficient.322 This is caused by the fact that the conjugated polymers, used for the fabrication of photovoltaic cells, are good electron donors but poor electron acceptors. As a consequence the formed excitons can dissociate to liberate the charges only in the vicinity of the electrode since the electrode is the only electron accepting area in the device. The photoinduced charge generation is facilitated if, in addition to the conjugated polymer, an electron-accepting component is dispersed in the active layer. In this case the large interface area between the electron donating and the electron accepting components promotes the photoinduced charge generation. If both phases form interpenetrating, percolating networks, the created electrons and holes can be transported to the respective electrodes. This briefly described concept of “a bulk heterojunction” was first experimentally proven by Heeger and co-workers who fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cells consisting of MEH-PPV (poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene)) as an electron donating semiconductor and fullerenes (C60) as electron acceptors.323 In more recent works C60 was replaced by its soluble derivative—methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Some of the solar cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and PCBM show power conversion efficiences approaching 5%.324 Even higher values were reported recently with lower band gap polymers and PC70BM:poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives yielded 6.1%325 and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene—benzodithiophene derivatives 7.4%326 under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2).
Photovoltaic cells containing nanocrystals as electron accepting components are based on the same principle of bulk heterojunction. In addition to their appropriate electronic structure, nanocrystals offer some advantages over other electron accepting components. First, the shape of nanocrystals can be varied (spheres, rods, tetrapods, hyperbranched) and by changing their shape it is possible to tune the percolation threshold since the dispersion of objects of higher aspect ratios results in its lowering. Second, the absorption spectrum of the crystals and their HOMO and LUMO levels can also be tuned by changing their size or their composition. Thus, it is possible to fabricate nanocrystals, which—in addition to the conjugated polymer—strongly contribute to the collection of photons under solar irradiation.
The principles of the device functioning of photovoltaic cells with semiconductor nanocrystals as electron acceptors are illustrated in Fig. 3 (Section 3.1). For proper operation the staggered (type II) alignement of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the bulk heterojunction components must be accomplished, compatible with the electrodes work functions. If an exciton is formed in the polymer phase, then the electron is transferred to the nanocrystals phase and reaches the aluminium electrodevia its percolating pathway. The remaining hole is transported to the ITO electrode through the polymer phase. In the alternative case, i.e. the formation of an exciton in the nanocrystals phase, the hole is transferred to the polymer phase and then transported to the ITO electrode, whereas the electron reaches the aluminium electrode through the nanocrystals phase.
A typical conjugated polymer/semiconductor nanocrystals bulk heterojunction type photovoltaic cell contains two additional layers (PEDOT:PSS and LiF), which improve the contact between the active layer and the electrodes and facilitate the extraction of holes and electrons, respectively.
The first bulk heterojuction-type solar cells containing semiconductor nanocrystals as electron accepting components were reported by Greenham et al. who used spherical CdSe or CdS nanocrystals in nanocomposites with MEH-PPV.112 The low efficiency of the obtained solar cells (0.2% under AM 1.5 conditions, 0.5 mW cm−2) is in accordance with the observed incomplete photoluminescence quenching. The obtained morphology suffered from uncontrolled phase separation of the active layer components. It should be underlined that already in this early study pyridine has been suggested for replacing the initial surface ligands and improving the charge transfer and charge transport properties of the hybrid.
A significant progress in the cell efficiency is generally achieved by replacing spherical nanocrystals with rod-like ones.110 Solar cells fabricated from 7 × 60 nm pyridine-treated CdSe nanorods and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) showed an improved power conversion efficiency of 1.7% under AM 1.5 conditions, 100 mW cm−2.111 Other types of anisotropic nanostructures, such as tetrapods or hyperbranched CdSe nanocrystals, were also tested as components for hybrid photovoltaic cells. CdSe tetrapods with poly(p-phenylene vinylene) exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 2.8%.327 Using a low band gap thiophene–benzothiadiazole based copolymer, 3.1% have been reached.281 Hybrid solar cells consisting of hyperbranched CdSe nanocrystals and poly(3-hexylthiophene) showed an efficiency of 2.2%.272
While the shape and size of the nanocrystals are controlled during their synthesis, the supramolecular organization and morphology of the polymer phase strongly depend on the hybrid thin film processing conditions. Mixing poly(3-hexylthiophene) with rod-like CdSe nanocrystals from 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene leads to a fibrilar morphology of the polymeric phase, facilitating charge carriers transport. The resulting interpenetrating network of two high aspect ratio components is very favorable for photovoltaic applications. Although for the nanocrystals' contents required for the functioning of the cell the fibrilar morphology is partially lost, still high cell efficiencies, exceeding 2.5%, can be obtained.109 A clear evidence of the existence of preformed poly(alkylthiophene) nanofibers after processing has been obtained by Jiu et al. who prepared hybrids with pyridine-treated CdSe nanorods.328 In this study, a better device performance was achieved with poly(butylthiophene) instead of poly(hexylthiophene) nanofibers, in accordance with the observed improved nanoscale organization of the hybrid thin film.
As discussed in Section 2.3, surface ligands are strongly influencing charge transfer and transport processes in the hybrid and thus directly influence the solar cell device performance. Pyridine, widely used in the processing of bulk heterojunction layers, has several disadvantages: (i) the ligand exchange is not complete; (ii) the solubility of the pyridine-treated nanocrystals is reduced, and the addition of pyridine to the nanocrystal/polymer co-solvent is required in most cases to obtain stable colloidal solutions; (iii) pyridine used as a co-solvent influences the supramolecular organization of conjugated polymers, it is for example a non-solvent for P3HT. Therefore an increasing number of studies concerns the search of alternative nanocrystals surface ligands for hybrids.
Aldakov and coworkers investigated a number of small sulfur-containing conjugated heterocycles (3-methylthiophene, 3-octylthiophene, ethylenedioxythiophene, and 1,3-thiazole) in hybrids with CdSe nanorods.256 However, in no case an improvement of the photovoltaic device performances with respect to pyridine could be obtained, which was attributed to the observed phase segregation of the hybrid's components into large polymer-rich and nanocrystal-rich domains. In a similar study, Olson et al. examined stearic acid, oleic acid, butylamine and tributylamine in hybrids with spherical CdSe nanocrystals.113 The use of butylamine in combination with an annealing step at around 110 °C yielded devices reaching an efficiency of 1.8% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). On the other hand, the authors point out a somehow limited reproducibility of the results due to inefficiencies in the ligand exchange procedure.
Zhou et al. reported recently a PCE of 2% for hybrids consisting of small spherical CdSe nanocrystals and P3HT, which is an unprecedented high value for this system. In their approach, the authors used hexadecylamine (HDA) capped CdSe nanocrystals, which were washed with hexanoic acid (Fig. 16). TEM and dynamic light scattering revealed a significantly reduced interparticle distance and effective particle size, respectively, pointing at the replacement of the bulky, insulating HDA ligands.

It is instructive to compare the data obtained for conjugated polymers/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrid solar cells with those reported for other types of these devices investigated in the recent years (see Table 4). Given a large number of different parameters, which characterize the performance of photovoltaic cells, it is sometimes difficult to compare literature values. For these reasons all data collected in Table 4 represent energy conversion efficiencies under air mass (AM) 1.5 1 sun conditions (typical solar spectrum, 100 mW cm−2), according to the following relationships: (15) (16)

We purposely added in Table 4 a column specifying the active surface of the measured devices. In the listed all-organic and hybrid solar cells, it strongly varies from 0.045 to 0.28 cm2 with most of the devices having an area of around 0.1 cm2. When comparing the obtained efficiency values, one should bear in mind that these are not independent from the device active surface. Pandey and coworkers showed that the measured efficiency increases strongly with decreasing device area, especially if the latter becomes smaller than 0.3 cm2.336 As can be seen from Fig. 17, reducing the area from around 0.3 cm2 to 0.03 cm2 leads to an approximately double value of device efficiency. Simulations revealing that the loss of performance of larger solar cells originated from the higher series resistance, which reduces FF and Jsc, have consolidated these results obtained with an organic model system. Therefore the performance loss of larger devices cannot simply be attributed to poorer film quality, but to the sheet resistance of ITO used as anode.

To conclude, although the power conversion efficiency of conjugated polymer/semiconductor nanocrystals hybrid photovoltaic cells is still significantly lower than those measured for silicon based or Grätzel type cells, the described new nanomaterials show several promising features. Their technologically most important advantages are: (i) they are easy to process, using low cost methods of low energy consumption; (ii) they can be deposited on large surface, cheap substrates which can partially compensate their lower performance. Of course, still much research is needed to improve their efficiency and long-term stability.
7 Perspectives
Research on hybrids consisting of semiconductor nanocrystals in a matrix of a conjugated polymers was originally motivated by the appealing possibility of combining in a synergic way two individually tunable semiconductors with complementary properties. In particular, conjugated polymers provide solution processibility in the form of thin films on large and flexible substrates, while semiconductor nanocrystals exhibit optical and electronic properties, which can be easily adjusted with size and composition. Among the possible applications of hybrids, solar cells and photodetectors have been mostly investigated so far. The majority of reported results concern n-type cadmium chalcogenides in combination with p-type poly(alkylthiophene) or poly(phenylene vinylnene) derivatives. Motivated on the one hand by environmental and toxicological issues and on the other hand by the lack of covering a spectral range above 800 nm, a series of novel nanocrystals has been developed during the last few years, mostly copper-containing binary and multinary sulfides and selenides. Due to the different electronic properties of these novel compounds, also other families of polymers will have to be investigated in order to obtain the desired energy band (or HOMO–LUMO level) alignment of the organic and inorganic semiconductors. Moreover, better matching of the solar spectrum by conjugated polymers' absorption spectra is still possible. Although the building block approach and the donor–acceptor concept significantly contributed to the preparation of several dozens of low band gap polymeric semiconductors, this synthetic pathway is still far from being exhausted. To this end electrochemical, spectro-electrochemical and photoelectron spectroscopic studies have to be performed in order to assess the energy level positions of the hybrids constituents.
Nanocrystals' surface chemistry remains a critical point for assuring compatibility with the polymer matrix as well as for enabling efficient charge transfer and charge transport processes. For the time being, a rather empirical choice of surface ligands has been practiced, looking for “small” molecules to replace the initial ones containing long, insulating alkyl chains. A concomitant requirement is the solubility of the functionalized nanocrystals in a common solvent with the polymer. At the same time the composition of the multicomponent mixture of nanocrystals, polymer and at least one solvent strongly influences the morphology and phase separation of the thin films obtained in the processing step. Morphology control in turn is of crucial importance for the electronic properties of the hybrid film. Phase separation should occur on the length scale of the exciton diffusion length, and continuous percolation pathways for the charge carriers to the electrodes have to be provided. It has recently been demonstrated that complementary solution NMR techniques can give valuable information about dynamics of ligand exchange processes337 and in fine about the composition of the hybrid mixture in solution. Further progress in the hybrid processing techniques will require wider use of these techniques.
Concerning the application of hybrids in solar cells, the results obtained to date—although being promising in view of the rather short time of research and few teams involved—are far from the expectations. While all-organic devices reach now more than 8% of power conversion efficiency, the best values obtained with hybrid devices have stagnated around 2–3% for the last five years. It is obvious that the cited parameters (nanocrystals' surface chemistry, morphology control, processing parameters) are key issues to be addressed. On the other hand, the approaches developed so far only give an incremental improvement, while a “quantum leap” would be needed to make technologically competitive hybrid-based photovoltaic devices. Another issue, which has not to be forgotten in the quest of better efficiencies, is the problem of device stability. Some devices based on hybrids of PbS and P3HT have shown promising stability under ambient conditions.120,337 Nevertheless, prolonged exposure to air for non-encapsulated devices generally leads to degradation of their performance due to oxygen and water diffusion at grain boundaries and through pinholes of the back electrode and/or oxidation of the electrode itself. An exciting approach to overcome this problem, not applied to hybrids so far, is the preparation of solar cells with an inverted structure. Instructive examples of this approach can be found in ref. 338–340. Instead of using a high work function transparent semiconducting oxide (e.g. ITO) and a low work function metal cathode (e.g. Ca, Al, Mg), inverted cells apply a less air sensitive high work function metal (e.g.Ag, Au) as the back electrode for hole collection and a metal oxide (e.g.TiO2, ZnO) as the electron collector at the ITO interface. To give an example, a solar cell consisting of a plastic/ITO/ZnO NPs/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag stack yielded a power conversion efficiency of 3.3% and 80% of this efficiency was retained after 40 days of operation under ambient conditions.339 Furthermore, this strategy avoids problems related to the diffusion of metal into the active layer during the electrode deposition process.
Concluding, in order to meet the high expectations set on hybrids and to make them a real alternative to competing approaches, such as all-organic electronic devices, two points seem to be of particular importance. First, a better analysis of the limiting factors in the different hybrid solar cells is needed, since these devices are complex systems with multiple interfaces. As has been shown in this review, special spectroscopic (e.g. photoinduced absorption measurements) and electrical (e.g.TOF measurements) studies can help to extract such information. These studies should be carried out on model systems of precisely defined properties and in parallel on real test devices. The structure of planar heterojunctions, for example, can be much better controlled than that of bulk heterojunctions. Second, a much stronger implication of theorists in this research is highly desirable. The predictive role of such studies cannot be overestimated. DFT calculations carried out for model compounds have already turned out to be very useful guidelines for the preparation of pre- or post-functionalization of semiconducting polymers. Similarly, modeling of the electronic structure of nanocrystal–surface ligands complexes and of the electrical transport at the interfaces and within the hybrid would be extremely helpful for designing more rational approaches towards hybrids with improved optoelectronic properties.
