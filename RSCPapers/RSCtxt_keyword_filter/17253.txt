Introduction
Recently, organic-lead halide perovskites have been widely investigated on account of their remarkable characteristics, including direct band gap, high balance hole and electron mobility, strong absorption coefficient, and long carrier lifetimes.1–3 Due to their superior characteristics the organic-lead halide perovskites have emerged as strong competitors in photovoltaic and general optoelectronic applications. The organic-lead halide perovskite-based solar cells have more than 23.6% power conversion efficiency (PCE), making them favorable for commercialization.4 However, the commercial applicability of these materials is hampered by their relative lack of stability compared to established inorganic and organic semiconductors. It has been found that it is possible to tune the properties and stability of the organic-lead halide perovskite materials by site-substitution at A sites of the ABX3 perovskite structure.5
Currently, research on methylammonium (MA) lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium (FA) lead iodide (FAPbI3) has become a hot topic worldwide and the number of publications shows the exponential growth as a function of time on the logarithmic scale. MAPbI3 crystals have a tetragonal structure at room temperature, which suffers from lattice distortion and strain, while FAPbI3 crystals suffer from the well-known spontaneous phase transition from the desired cubic phase (α phase) black perovskite to δ-phase yellow non-perovskite at room temperature. This phase transition is the main obstacle for high efficiency and long-term stability of MAPbI3-based and FAPbI3-based optoelectronic devices. Meanwhile, the optical response range and decomposition temperature of these organic-lead halide perovskites are unsatisfactory for optoelectronic applications.
Composition engineering could be a potential solution to solve these problems. Seok et al.6 prepared MAxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite thin films by mixing the large FA cation with the small MA cation, resulting in a tunable band gap and a stable structure. Zhu et al.7 had synthesized the mixed FA1−xCsxPbI3 perovskite thin films with a Cs component between 0.1 and 0.3, which provided an expected improvement in thermal stability. However, most published reports are based on polycrystalline films, which invariably contain significant grain boundaries and defects due to their preparation processes. These defects limit their applications in high performance devices. More importantly, it is still not clear what role organic cations play, nor how they influence the material properties in perovskites.
To obtain a deeper understanding of material properties, single crystals are regarded as the best platform among various building blocks for fundamental study. Here, we synthesized a series of perovskite single crystals with mixed organic cations (NH4+, MA+, HC(NH2)2+FA, CH3CH2NH3+EA) along the compositional space, and conducted a systematic investigation to correlate the carrier behavior with the organic cation size. The single crystals were synthesized via inverse temperature crystallization assisted by hydroiodic acid, where the quality of the crystals could be judiciously controlled by the thermodynamic process. It is found that size of the organic cation can not only cause lattice strain by lattice contraction or dilation but also may induce phase transitions by octahedral tilting. Meanwhile, thermal stability is related to the probability of HI formation, which is directly related to the acidity of the organic species. FA incorporated MAPbI3 crystals possess the best thermodynamic properties owing to the low acidity of the FA cation. Organic cations affect transport properties of crystals by affecting crystal structure. The cubic phase crystals have the lowest lattice strain and low trap density. These results represent an important step to highlight the role of organic cations in hybrid perovskite materials, which will further benefit the fundamental understanding of materials and device optimization.
Experimental
Synthesis of mixed-perovskite crystals

Growth of the mixed-perovskite crystals. 
Perovskite crystals were grown using a reported method of inverse temperature crystallization.8 Briefly, 1 M PbI2 and 1 M MAI were dissolved in 2 ml γ-butyrolactone (GBL) at 40 °C, and stirred until the solution become clear. The solution was then kept at 90 °C for about 12 h to allow for pure MAPbI3 crystal growth. For the FA cation mixed with MAPbI3, 0.159 g MAI, and 0.172 g FAI were dissolved in 2 ml GBL solution, for the EA cation mixed with MAPbI3, 0.273 g MAI, and 0.05 g EAI were dissolved in 2 ml GBL solution and for the NH4 cation mixed with MAPbI3, 0.238 g MAI, and 0.01 g NH4I were dissolved in 2 ml GBL solution.

Characterization of the mixed-perovskite crystals
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the single crystals were collected by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8-Advance) using Cu Kα radiation. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrums were measured by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (U-3900). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA analyzer (PYRTS 1). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out by using a Q2000 to test phase transition. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was carried out using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (U-3900). V–I characteristics were tested using a Keithley 2400 instrument.
Result and discussion
Four types of organic cation-mixed single crystals were successfully grown by the inverse temperature crystallization process. All crystals are of millimeter size, as shown in Fig. 1. In principle, any single-charged organic cation could be used to form a perovskite once there is sufficient space to fit it within the inorganic crystalline cage. But, if a cation is oversized, a perovskite with a low dimension crystal structure will form. In our work, all crystals form 3D structures. In this structure, the halogen, I, atoms occupy the vertices of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, while the divalent metal, Pb, sits at the center of the octahedron. Organic species occupy the 12-coordinated octahedral cavities of the 3D network. A schematic diagram of crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2(d).

To further investigate the crystal structure, single crystals were ground into powder to characterize their crystalline phase by powder X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), all samples possess a pure perovskite phase. The main peaks for MAPbI3 and NH4+-incorporated MAPbI3(NH4@MAPbI3) crystals are at about 2θ = 14.1°, 28.3°, and 31.7°, which is in agreement with that of a previously reported pure tetragonal phase.9 The reported, calculated and experimental data of MAPbI3 show that (211) and (213) intensity peaks were used to differentiate between tetragonal and cubic phases.10 No (211) reflection at 2θ = 23.5° was observed, which proves that EA+-incorporated MAPbI3 crystal (EA@MAPbI3) and FA+-incorporated MAPbI3 crystal (FA@MAPbI3) have a cubic structure. Cell parameters of the four types of crystals are shown in Table 1. The expanded powder XRD patterns of the four types of crystals are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The (112) peak diffraction in Fig. 2(b) shifts to a higher angle when the small sized cation NH4+ is incorporated into a MA-based perovskite. Simultaneously, when the A-site cation is changed from EA@MA to FA@MA, the (110) peak diffraction shifted to a lower angle. These peak diffraction shifts are the result of a variation of lattice parameters in the crystals upon the partial substitution of the organic cation. The sizes of the organic cations are shown in Fig. 2(c). The powder X-ray diffraction data show that when an EA cation or FA cation is incorporated, the MAPbI3 structure transited from a tetragonal phase to a cubic phase. Octahedral tilting has been proven to be the origin of phase transition in perovskite crystals.11 This octahedral tilt adjusts the tolerance factor toward the first distortion factor, which results in favorable conditions to stabilize cubic perovskites.12 In contrast, if a small cation such as NH4+ is incorporated into MAPbI3, the lattice of the cell contracts and the tolerance factor shifts far away from the distortion factor 1; hence NH4@MAPbI3 still retains a tetragonal structure. In summary, the size of the cation could tune the structure of lead halide perovskites via lattice contracting and octahedral tilting.

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of perovskites were characterized by a UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer to confirm the band gap energy of single crystals. Diffuse reflectance spectra for the single crystals as a function of wavelength in the range of 740–860 nm are presented in Fig. 3(a). The absorption edges of MAPbI3 and EA@MAPbI3 are about 830 nm, while the absorption edge of NH4@MAPbI3 maintains a blue-shift to about 820 nm. The absorption edge of the FA@MAPbI3 crystal displays a clear red-shift to ∼860 nm. The red-shift of the absorption edge allows the perovskite to function as an efficient solar cell light-absorbing material. A further analysis of optical spectra can be performed to calculate band gap energy. The Kubelka–Munk equation at any wavelength is: (1)where S and K are scattering and absorption coefficients, respectively, and F(R∞) is the Kubelka–Munk function. The band gap Eg and the absorption coefficient α of a direct band gap semiconductor are related through the well-known equation:13,14 (2)where α is the linear absorption coefficient of the material, hν is the photon energy, and C1 is a proportionality constant. When the material scatters in a perfectly diffuse manner, the Kubelka–Munk absorption coefficient S is constant with respect to wavelength, and using the remission function in eqn (2), we obtain the expression:15 [F(R∞)hν]2 = C2(hν − Eg)(3)
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra for mixed-perovskite crystals. (b) Band gap energy determination. 
Therefore, obtaining F(R∞) from eqn (1) and plotting [F(R∞)hν]2 against hν, the band gap energies, Eg, can be obtained easily, and are shown in Fig. 3(b). The band gap energies of NH4@MAPbI3, MAPbI3, EA@MAPbI3, and FA@MAPbI3 are 1.52, 1.51, 1.50, and 1.46 eV, respectively. The results show that the band gap energy of the cubic structure perovskite is smaller than that of the tetragonal structure. Theoretical work has revealed the electron configuration of MAPbI3, in that the valence band maximum is composed of antibonding combinations of Pb s and I p orbitals, and therefore any change to the perovskite lattice that increases the amount of Pb–I overlap will destabilize the valence band, raising it in energy. The conduction band, derived from p-orbitals and having poorer orbital overlap, is expected to respond less strongly to distortions in lattice structure than the valence band that is derived from Pb s orbitals.16 In other words, organic cations change the metal–halide–metal bond by octahedral tilting, confirming two factors: (1) an increase in Pb–I overlap will decrease the band gap, or (2) a reduction in metal–halide overlap will increase the band gap. Metal–halide orbital overlap is a σ* interaction, and reduction of the M–X–M bond angle reduces the extent of overlap between metals, and results in an increase in band gap energy.17 From the XRD results, FA@MAPbI3 and EA@MAPbI3 have a cubic structure, while NH4@MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 have a tetragonal structure. The metal–halide–metal bond angle in the cubic structure is close to 180°, while the tetragonal structure suffers from distortion, causing the metal–halide–metal bond angle to go below the value of 180° (Fig. S3, ESI†). Our work is in line with previous reports. Organic cations tune the band gap energy of the perovskite by changing the metal–halide–metal bond via tilting of the octahedra. In addition, we found that the band gap energy of the same structure perovskite crystals is also altered. For example, the band gap energy of NH4@MAPbI3 is bigger than that of MAPbI3 and the band gap energy of EA@MAPbI3 is bigger than that of FA@MAPbI3. From the X-ray diffraction data we could easily find that the cell lattices of NH4@MAPbI3 and EA@MAPbI3 are smaller than those of MAPbI3 and FA@MAPbI3, respectively. We suspect that lattice contraction could widen the band gap of perovskite crystals. This speculation needs to be verified by further theoretical and experimental research. In general, organic cations in perovskite materials tune the band gap energy via octahedral tilting or lattice contraction. Fig. 4 shows the schematic representation of band gap energy variation of mixed perovskite crystals.

To explore the thermal properties of perovskites, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted from room temperature to 500 °C under nitrogen flow. For uniform temperature distribution, the large crystals were ground into a fine powder prior to testing. All the perovskites start to undergo about 20% mass loss of hydroiodic acid followed by about 7% loss of the organics at ∼230 °C, except for FA@MAPbI3 perovskite. FA@MAPbI3 starts decomposition at 270 °C. This decomposition sequence indicates that the organic group is bound into the perovskite matrix more tightly than the HI. The thermal stability is related to the probability of HI formation, which is directly related to the acidity of the organic cation.18 The stronger the acidic character of the cation, the higher the chance that the organic cation can be deprotonated to yield HI. Since the FA cation is less acidic than other organic species, it is natural that FA-incorporated perovskites possess the best thermal stability. Identical thermal behavior was also observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which is shown in Fig. 5(b). MAPbI3 and NH4@MAPbI3 show a peak at 57 °C, which indicates a tetragonal–cubic phase transition. EA@MAPbI3 and FA@MAPbI3 perovskite crystals show a cubic phase at room temperature; hence no endothermic peak appears, indicating the improvement of thermodynamic stability.

To investigate the transport properties of perovskite single crystals, the trap density (ntrap) of the crystals was estimated. Voltage (V)–current (I) curves of Au/perovskite single crystal/Au hole-only devices were measured in the dark. When the applied voltage is lower than the kink-point voltage, the current I increases linearly with applied voltage V, demonstrating an ohmic response between the electrode and the perovskite for the hole-only device. As the applied voltage exceeds the kink-point voltage, the current I exhibits a quick non-linear increase, indicating that the trap states are fully filled by the injected carriers. The applied voltage at the kink point is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is determined by the trap state density:19 (4)where L is the thickness of the perovskite single crystal, ε is the relative dielectric constant, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Hence, the trap density, ntrap, can be calculated using eqn (1). Based on Fig. 6, the corresponding hole trap density values are 6.29 × 109 cm−3, 7.36 × 109 cm−3, 7.18 × 109 cm−3, and 1.56 × 109 cm−3 for MAPbI3, NH4@MAPbI3, EA@MAPbI3, and FA@MAPbI3, respectively. Compared with the previous report,20 the trap density values of all four types of mixed perovskite crystals are small, indicating the high quality of these crystals. The ntrap value in FA@MAPbI3 is the lowest owing to its cubic phase and low lattice contraction degree.

Conclusions
In conclusion, four types of halide perovskite single crystals were grown to explore the effects of organic cations on various perovskite properties such as crystal structure, stability, and optoelectronic properties. Our findings suggest that: (1) the size of organic cations can not only cause lattice strain by lattice contraction or dilation but also may induce phase transitions by octahedral tilting; (2) precise band gap engineering is achieved by controlling bond angles; (3) thermal stability is related to the probability of HI formation, which is directly related to the acidity of the organic species; and (4) organic cations affect the transport property of crystals via affecting crystal structure. The cubic phase crystals have the lowest lattice strain and low trap density. These results represent an important step to highlight the role of organic cations in hybrid perovskite materials, which will further benefit the fundamental understanding of materials and device optimization.
