    , Accepted 4th July 2013First published on 4th July 2013AbstractPrevious studies have concentrated on harnessing the surface plasmonic effects of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) to improve polymer solar cell performance. Although ample examples have evidenced the viability of this methodology, the adverse effect of device photocurrent reduction via the intrinsic metal-mediated losses of plasmonic metal NPs, which hampers further enhancement of device efficiency, has rarely been recognized. To address this issue, we herein embedded Au NPs coated with a dielectric SiO2 layer into polymer solar cells, attempting to reduce the negative effects of these metallic nanostructures and thus increase photovoltaic photocurrent and efficiency. We constructed inverted polymer solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, and blended Au NPs coated with SiO2 layer, i.e. Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures into the active layer. Compared with plasmonic solar cells embedded with sole Au NPs, the device incorporating Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures indeed exhibited significantly augmented photocurrent density, though not a superior overall efficiency. The photocurrent density increase is attributed to the dielectric layer coating Au NPs, which mitigates metal-mediated losses such as exciton quenching, probably induced by the electron accumulation on the metallic surface, but which meanwhile is thin enough to maintain the plasmonic effects of the gold core upon photoexcitation. The study provides new insights into strategies harnessing plasmonic nanostructures to enhance photovoltaic performance, i.e. the balance between plasmonic effects and metal-mediated losses has to be comprehensively evaluated.
1. Introduction
Plasmonics, which merges photonics and electronics on nanoscale dimensions, has attracted intensive interest due to its significance in fundamental research and potential applications in miniaturized optical devices, sensors, medical diagnostics and therapeutics, etc.1–5 In recent years, plasmonic nanostructures composed of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au or Ag have been embedded into solar cells to enhance their photo-to-current efficiency.6–17 The power conversion efficiencies of such plasmonic solar cells even have broken the 10% efficiency barrier.18 It is well established that the conversion efficiency is governed by external and internal quantum efficiency, and the former is influenced by charge diffusion and exciton dissociation while the latter is related to incident light and absorption efficiency. Typically, increasing the thickness of solar cell active layer would enhance light absorption and from this perspective is advantageous for the cell efficiency; however, a thicker layer would generally decrease device efficiency due to the usually low carrier mobilities and short exciton diffusion lengths of organic polymers employed. Plasmonic nanostructures, on the other hand, are promising to provide a solution for the paradox between carrier mobility and absorption efficiency of the solar cells. It is expected that upon sunlight excitation, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of the metallic nanoparticles is triggered and the local electromagnetic field is thus increased, which would help facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transfer process in the cells, and eventually lead to enhancement of the photocurrents and the power conversion efficiencies of the devices. Moreover, the blended metal NPs scatter more incident light into the cell and increase the light propagation range, also potential for increasing the cell efficiency. Thus, by utilization of surface plasmonic effects of metallic nanoparticles to guide and confine light on subwavelength scales,19–21 the mismatch between efficient light trapping and effective exciton diffusion can be conveniently bridged.
Plenty of research has corroborated the plasmonic effects of metal NPs on enhancing solar cell performance. However, some negative effects of introducing plasmonic NPs into the cells, like deteriorated power conversion efficiency and other often not understood effects have started to grasp the attention of a few groups.13,22–24 The underlying reasons accounting for these adverse effects are still under debate, among which the metal-mediated loss is one possible explanation. Ample evidence have shown that advantageous plasmonic effects from bare metallic NPs in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are also interfered by metal-mediated losses such as carrier recombination,25–27 reduction of I3− to I− by electrons easily trapped by metallic NPs28 and metal core charging effects.29 Moreover, several groups have also suggested metal-mediated losses in organic solar cells. Recently Ginger et al. found that metal NPs accumulated long-lived negative charges from adjacent photoexcited P3HT/PCBM blend, which imposed potential risks of charge recombination in an organic photovoltaic device.30 Additionally, Hsu et al. implied in their study that Au NPs in organic solar cells resulted into energy loss due to quenching, a process competing with the enhanced absorption from the plasmonic effect of the same metal NPs.31
Under this context, we attempt to improve the performance of plasmonic solar cells by encapsulating Au NPs with a dielectric layer, which looks counterintuitive at first glance as the dielectric layer might hamper electrical conductivity. Indeed, the effects of this methodology turn out to be manifold as it represents both an opportunity to reduce metal-mediated losses such as charge recombination and a potential risk of hindering electrical conductivity in the solar cell layer.32 Herein we construct inverted polymer solar cell employing nanosized ZnO semiconductor as the buffer layer and blends comprised of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the active layer. P3HT belongs to the polythiophene family and is a benchmark electron donor, while PCBM is a soluble fullerene derivative and acts as electron acceptor in solar cells due to its high hole mobility. Up to the present, these two molecules are the most widely investigated active materials for bulk-heterojunction solar cells, but power conversion efficiencies of these devices are limited to approximately 5%.33 Au NPs or Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures are embedded into the active layer because the plasmonic effect is large in close vicinity to the NPs, while decaying rapidly within a few tens of nanometers. It is observed that plasmonic solar cells incorporating Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs exhibited significantly augmented photocurrent density compared with the device embedded with sole Au NPs, although the overall power conversion efficiency is not increased. The photocurrent density increase is attributed to the dielectric layer coating Au NPs, which mitigates metal-mediated losses such as exciton quenching probably induced by the electron accumulation on the metallic surface, but meanwhile is thin enough to maintain the plasmonic effects of the gold core upon photoexcitation. The result discloses that the balance between plasmonic effects and metal-mediated losses has to be comprehensively evaluated to design highly efficient plasmonic solar cells.
2. Experimental details
Syntheses of plasmonic nanostructures

Preparation of Au NPs. 
Synthesis of the ∼14 nm diameter Au NPs core was through the reduction of an aqueous boiling solution of HAuCl4 using sodium citrate as reducing agent and stabilizer, in accordance to previous literatures.34 Briefly, 0.5 mL of 25 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was added to 20 mL deionized water and heated to reflux under magnetic stirring, then 1.3 mL of 38.8 mM freshly prepared trisodium citrate aqueous solution was swiftly added. The solution was allowed to reflux for 15 min, until the color changes from faint yellow to dark red.


Preparation of spacer of silica shell. 
0.5 mL aqueous solution of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, with average molar masses of 10 kg mol−1) with a density of 12.8 mg mL−1 was added to the 22 mL aqueous solution of as-prepared Au NPs. Subsequently at room temperature, the mixture stood for 24 h under magnetic stirring, which allowed PVP molecules to attach to the surfaces of Au NPs. The PVP-attached Au NPs were then separated from solution by centrifuging at 11000 rpm for 30 min and redispersed in 5 mL deionized water. Thereafter, 5.0 mL PVP-modified Au NPs were added into a flask containing a total volume of 15.8 mL mixture composed of 0.8 mL ammonia and 15.0 mL ethanol under magnetic stirring. Then, 7 μL tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in 10 mL kept in a constant pressure funnel was added dropwise into the flask within a period of 6 h. The total volume of the reaction mixture now reached about 30 mL and was stirred for another 12 h to complete the preparation process. Then the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min to remove unreacted reagent, and redispersed in 200 μL ethanol solution.


Preparation of SiO2 spheres. 
Silica nanoparticles were prepared using a variation of the method developed by Stöber et al.35 Briefly, an aqueous solution of 3 mL of 30% ammonia was mixed with 50 mL ethanol. Then 1.5 mL TEOS was added and the solution was kept stirring for about 4 h.

Fabrication of polymer solar cells

Preparation of the ZnO precursor. 
The ZnO precursor was prepared through dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.0%, 1 g) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.0%, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.9%, 5 mL) under vigorous stirring for 12 h for the hydrolysis reaction in air.36,37


Fabrication of solar cells. 
The device was fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate, which was cleaned by ultrasonication in water, dichloromethane, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in succession, and thereafter was dried by argon gas flow and treated with UV ozone before use. First, the ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated on top of the ITO-glass substrate, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the active layer was deposited through spin-coating the mixed uniform solution of P3HT (∼15 mg mL−1, from Rieke Metals) and PCBM (∼10 mg mL−1, from Nichem Fine Technology Ltd.) in chlorobenzene. To make plasmonic solar cells, the active layer needs to be blended with plasmonic nanostructures (Au NPs or Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures or reference SiO2 NPs) in advance. The quantity of Au NPs was optimized at an weight ratio of 3 wt%, determined by the weight of P3HT. To make a fair comparison of the effects on the solar cells from the different embedded particles, the numbers of Au or Au@SiO2 or reference SiO2 NPs were maintained the same in respective active layers. The concentration of Au NPs and thus the particle numbers were determined by measuring Au NP absorbance at LSPR maximum by using a molar extinction coefficient of 3 × 108 M−1 cm−1.38 The typical concentration of silica nanoparticle colloidal solutions and hence particle numbers were calculated by assuming that all of the TEOS reacted and that these nanoparticles have a density of 2 g cm−3 and a diameter of ∼51 nm.39
The active layer was thereafter thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Finally, the Ag anode film (ca. 100 nm thickness) was deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation.

Characterization

Spectroscopic measurement. 
The collection of UV/VIS absorption spectra was performed on a TU-1810 Spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument, China). The fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out on a FluoTime 200 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) TCSPC time-resolved fluorescence platform, equipped with a nanosecond pulsed LED at 464 nm (pulse width <750 ps) as the excitation source.


Transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization. 
The electron micrographs were obtained using a Tecnai G2 F30 Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope at an operating voltage of 300 kV.


Scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization. 
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) was employed to obtain the morphologies of samples.


Atomic force microscope (AFM) characterization. 
AFM images were recorded on a Bruker Multimode atomic force microscope in air by tapping mode. The silicon cantilevers used here were obtained from Bruker with a spring constant of 20–80 N m−1. The images were collected with a scan rate of 1 Hz and a scanning density of 512 lines per frame.


Solar cell characterization. 
The devices were tested under an AM 1.5 illumination supplied by a xenon lamp (OSRAME-O150W) with an optical filter (AM 1.5G) under a power of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with a Solar Cell Scan 100 (Zolix Instruments). The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured with a Model 4200-SCS Semiconductor Characterization System (Keithley Instruments Inc.).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The characterization of plasmonic nanostructures
The schematic representation of preparing the core–shell structure is shown in Fig. 1. It mainly undergoes procedures of initial preparation of gold nanoparticles and sequential growth of SiO2 shell on the gold core. Standard sodium citrate reduction method is used to obtain the Au NPs with average size of ∼14 nm.34 An improved Stöber process is employed to grow a silica spacer shell with a controlled and uniform thickness on the PVP-modified gold core.40,41 By varying the amount of TEOS used in the synthesis, the thickness of the spacer shell can be conveniently adjusted to ∼13 nm adopted in the solar cell. This thickness is deliberately selected to employ the insulating effects of the dielectric layer and meanwhile maintain the plasmonic effects of the gold core, as our previous results indicate plasmonic field can reach a long-range distance of over 34 nm.38
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesizing process of Au@SiO2 core–shell plasmonic nanostructures. 
The TEM images of these as-prepared Au NPs, Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs together with reference SiO2 NPs with the diameter about 51 nm are demonstrated in Fig. 2(a)–(c). Fig. 2(d) illustrates the extinction spectra of Au NPs and Au@SiO2 core–shell nanostructures. The naked ∼14 nm Au NPs exhibit one LSPR peak at 521 nm. When wrapped with SiO2 shell at a thickness of 13 nm, the LSPR band maximum of the core–shell structure shifts significantly to the longer wavelength of 528 nm, which can be explained by the increase of the local refractive index surrounding Au NPs.42 Note the plasmon band regime of either particle is very close to absorption peak of the P3HT/PCBM blends, suggesting an enhanced light-harvesting efficiency of the solar cell via LSPR is possible.25,43

3.2. Solar cell architecture

Fig. 3(a) displays the architecture of the inverted plasmonic solar cells. The inverted geometry demonstrates many superiority in comparison with conventional ones, such as air-stability and easy fabrication.37,44,45 Nanosized ZnO semiconductor is adopted as buffer layer in an inverted configuration. Unlike many previous studies where metallic NPs were incorporated into buffer layer such as poly(3,4-ethyl-enedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),11,46 the NPs are embedded into the active layer. Considering that buffer layer is generally spincast up to as thick as 100 nm, devices with the incorporation of plasmonic structures in active layer is preferable to ensure the plasmonic field working range.1,10,14,32 If the metallic NPs are wrapped with insulating SiO2 shell, the metal-mediated losses might be mitigated and meanwhile the advantageous surface plasmonic effect can be maintained. Hence, we blended naked Au NPs and Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs respectively in the solar cells for comparison. It is expected that a balance would be reached between plasmonic effects and metal-mediated losses for the device embedded with the latter nanostructures.

Fig. 3(b)–(c) display SEM images of ZnO layer spin-coated on ITO glass with different resolution. The ZnO nano/microwires with ∼200 nm width and several micrometer length form a three-dimensional (3D) web-like network, which facilitate the photoactive polymers to infiltrate the vacancy and porous structure and expose to sufficient illumination.47 As a result, exciton creation and dissociation at the P3HT/PCBM interface is greatly improved. In addition, the 3D network of ZnO film is beneficial to bulk heterojunction compared with planar configuration. The intimate contact increases the interfacial region between the P3HT/PCBM blend and the ZnO buffer layer and thus ITO electrode, stimulating efficient electron collection, reducing the electron/hole recombination and thus improving the solar cell efficiency.48–50 On the other hand, the presence of Au NPs uniformly embedded in the active layer is evident from the SEM images, where the bright dots are the NPs and the background represents the P3HT/PCBM active layer (Fig. 3(d)).
Previous report had found that morphological changes in the active layer are less favorable for exciton dissociation.13 Hence the loading of different particles in the active layer as in our case might also affect film morphology, exciton dissociation and eventual overall device efficiency to different extent. We thus made further measurement to compare AFM images of Au or Au@SiO2 or SiO2 NP embedded P3HT/PCBM active layers on silicon plates (Fig. 4). Probably due to the low loading particle concentration, generally the surface roughness of the three film is slight and the blend morphology does not exhibit significant variations from each other. As indicated by the AFM height images of Fig. 4(a), (c) and (e), the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the three active layers only increases slightly from 0.99 nm, 1.15 nm to 1.40 nm when a 5 × 5 μm2 area without large protrusion was selected for calculation for each layer. At certain positions for each film, especially for the SiO2 NP embedded one, occasional large protrusion was found though, ascribed to the local aggregation of embedded particles. As can be seen from the AFM height images of Fig. 4(a), (c) and (e), when for each layer a 3 × 3 μm2 area with the presence of large protrusion was selected for calculation, the RMS ranges from 1.21 nm, 1.48 nm to a significant change of 8.01 nm. However, the overall RMS calculated by selecting the full size of 10 × 10 μm2 for each layer still varies slightly, 1.11 nm, 1.29 nm and 3.41 nm for Fig. 4(a), (c) and (e), respectively. Meanwhile, no large contrast and thus no obvious nanoscale morphology changes were observed in the corresponding phase images (Fig. 4(b), (d) and (f)). Therefore, it is presumed that the different morphological changes as caused by the embedding of different particles only play a minor role in affecting photovoltaic efficiency.
 Fig. 4  AFM height images of Au or Au@SiO2 or SiO2 NP embedded P3HT/PCBM active layers on silicon plates ((a), (c) and (e), respectively) and corresponding phase images ((b), (d) and (f)). Each full image size is 10 × 10 μm2. The area of black square encircling large protrusion is 3 × 3 μm2 and the area of white square encircling no large protrusion is 5 × 5 μm2 for (a), (c) and (e). 
3.3. IPCE characteristics

Fig. 5 displays UV/Vis absorption spectra of plain P3HT/PCBM films and those blended with Au NPs or Au@SiO2 core–shell plasmonic nanostructures, or SiO2 NPs. The absorption in the region from ∼400 to 620 nm exhibits enhancement after incorporating plasmonic nanostructures into the P3HT/PCBM active layer of the solar cell, with the solar cells blended with Au@SiO2 NPs demonstrating detectably larger absorption. The augmented light trapping may eventually lead to augmented photocurrent density. The film blended with SiO2 NPs demonstrates even stronger extinction intensity, as caused by the intense light scattering from the particles with a large size of ∼51 nm. However, the enlarged light extinction intensity does not necessarily translate into a photocurrent increase of a solar cell, if the photons are not fully consumed by the active layers. Hence, an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve would provide a picture closer to the actual power conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic device.
 Fig. 5  UV/Vis absorption spectra of plain P3HT/PCBM films and those blended with Au NPs or Au@SiO2 core–shell plasmonic nanostructures, or SiO2 NPs. All the films are spin-coated on quartz substrates. 
The IPCE curves versus incident light wavelength for these solar cells are shown in Fig. 6a. For devices embedded with Au NPs or Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs, the IPCE is significantly higher than that of reference device within the visible region from ∼400 to 620 nm. The curves of the increase in IPCE (ΔIPCE) after incorporating plasmonic NPs illustrate more obvious comparison (Fig. 6b). Note the solar cells blended with Au@SiO2 NPs exhibit overall larger ΔIPCE values than that of cells embedded with single Au NPs. It can be largely excluded that the enhancement is caused by light scattering from the embedded nanoparticles which augments incident light absorption, as the device blended with solely SiO2 NPs exhibits even stronger light scattering but has no such IPCE increase. On the other hand, previous study implied that for devices embedded with small plasmonic nanoparticles, ∼14 nm Au NPs and ∼40 nm Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs in our case, reflecting and scattering light is not a major route to harvest incident photons.10 Hence, considering that IPCE increases in the ∼400–620 nm wavelength regime, which coincides with the extinction range of the plasmonic nanostructures (Fig. 6b), one would conclude that LSPR effects indeed improve the IPCE and therefore photocurrent density of the devices.
 Fig. 6  IPCE curves of different devices (a) and the curve of the increase in IPCE (ΔIPCE) after incorporating plasmonic NPs and the normalized extinction spectra of the NPs (b). 
One would expect that the effect on organic solar cells might be even larger when using moderately sized nanoparticles (larger than 100 nm) since scattering is by far the more dominant factor then. Herein our focus is to investigate the mitigation of metal-mediated losses by coating Au nanoparticles with dielectric layer in plasmonic solar cells, and therefore we chose Au NPs and Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs with smaller sizes considering that their LSPR bands overlap with P3HT/PCBM blends, and their near field enhancement is larger than the scattering effect. Meanwhile, we are trying to design embedded plasmonic nanostructures with various sizes, geometries and core compositions which may generate more remarkable plasmonic effects. These results will be reflected in separate work.
3.4. 
          J–V characteristics
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices, recorded under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G), are presented in Fig. 7 and all the device parameters are summarized in Table 1.The reference device demonstrates a short-current Jsc of 7.23 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.57 V, and an overall power conversion efficiency η of 1.95%. By contrast, addition of either plasmonic nanostructure, Au NPs or Au@SiO2 to the device would lead to a noticeable overall efficiency increase of 25% or 11%, respectively. Remarkably, although the overall conversion efficiency of solar cells incorporating Au@SiO2 NPs is not higher than that of cells embedded with sole Au NPs, the Jsc of the former is noticeably larger. And as expected, sole addition of SiO2 NPs lack of LSPR effects only drags the device efficiency to a decreased number of 1.70%, albeit short-current rises slightly compared with reference probably due to more light scattering by the large size NPs.

3.5. Pros and cons of coating Au NPs with dielectric layer
The fact that both Au and Au@SiO2 NPs enhance the overall efficiency of the devices significantly stems from the LSPR effects of these plasmonic nanostructures. It is well established that localized surface plasmons (LSP) are charge density oscillations on the surface of metallic NPs. LSPs are excited in response to incident light; this leads to a strong enhancement of the local electromagnetic field,51,52 which facilitates more efficient dissociation and transferability of excitons and eventually leads to photocurrent increment of photovoltaics. On the other hand, as optical extinction cross sections of plasmonic NPs are larger than their physical cross sections,53,54 more energy from incident light can be accepted and concentrated to the vicinity of their physical boundary. This feature enables plasmonic NPs to function as an antenna to enhance the interactions between incident light and active layer and contribute to improve photocurrent generation of solar cells.
However more strikingly, when Au@SiO2 NPs are blended into the active layer of the solar cells, the Jsc of this device is even larger than that of the device blended with sole Au NPs. On the one hand, the stronger plasmon scattering of larger Au@SiO2 NPs as caused by larger particle size is supposed to contribute to an enhanced photocurrent, as evidenced by Fig. 6. More important, the insulating effect of the SiO2 spacer might mitigate metal-mediated losses in a device solely embedded with naked gold cores.
We thereafter employ time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to obtain an in-depth understanding of the balance between plasmonic effects and metal-mediated losses. In Fig. 8, pristine P3HT films exhibit fluorescence decay that can be best fitted with an average lifetime of 0.60 ± 0.06 ns. Compared with P3HT reference film, the lifetime of the film embedded with Au NPs is noticeably shortened to 0.52 ± 0.05 ns. The fluorescence lifetime reduction of P3HT can be attributed to the excitation energy transfer from the dye to the Au NPs, as numerous literatures have demonstrated that noble metal nanoparticles can lead to fluorescence quenching of dye molecules in the vicinity.38,55–58 Alternatively, in certain circumstances photoinduced electrons might also be generated and transfer to the metal NPs, accumulating on the surface and resulting into fluorescence reduction of the dye.11,30 However, with dielectric layer of SiO2 coating the Au NP surface, whichever coupling between the plasmonic field and the photogenerated excitons within the photoactive blend is expected to be weakened. As a result, the lifetime of the film embedded with Au@SiO2 NPs is almost the same as that of plain P3HT and reference SiO2 NPs, as indicated by the overlapping of the three decay curves in Fig. 8. The fitted data are consistent with previous results31 and imply the incorporation of insulating layer around the Au NPs indeed mitigate metal-mediated energy losses due to quenching in the solar cells.
 Fig. 8  Photoluminescence (PL) decay profiles of the reference P3HT films, P3HT films embedded with Au NPs or Au@SiO2 NPs or SiO2 NPs spin-cast on quartzes. The excitation wavelength is 464 nm and the decay curves are measured at 650 nm. 
We also performed dynamic PL measurements in P3HT/PCBM blends embedded with/without plasmonic NPs. However, with the presence of electron acceptor of PCBM, the fluorescence of P3HT in the films is greatly quenched and hard to obtain decent fluorescence lifetime data with our current excitation source of a nanosecond pulsed LED. Previous measurements using a picosecond pulsed laser light source derived averaged lifetime of 0.36 ns and 0.27 ns for P3HT/PCBM blends with and without ∼45 nm Au NPs, respectively, which also showed a detectable fluorescence lifetime reduction of the film upon addition of metal NPs.11 Further transient absorption measurement may ascertain whether the Au NPs accumulate long-lived negative charges when they are in contact with photoexcited P3HT/PCBM blends and therefore lead to metal-mediated losses in plasmonic solar cells, as proposed in ref. 30.
Surprisingly, the blending of Au NPs into the device also induces the improvement of Voc of the plasmonic solar cells. The open-circuit voltage of the device blended with Au NPs increases about 20 mV compared with reference device, which is not observed for those incorporating Au@SiO2 NPs despite the assumed occurrence of LSPR effects in both devices. Hence, a mechanism other than single plasmon induced enhancement or metal-mediated losses may account for the distinct behaviors. In this specific case where P3HT is employed as the charge donor, one explanation is that naked Au NPs act as hole carriers as their work function is well matched with the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT, and hence additional charge transportation network is built. For instance, investigations from Heeger and his colleagues also showed an enlarged Voc for solar cells where bare Au NPs were blended with P3HT/PCBM.10 They proposed that the introduction of Au NPs in the cell resulted in a small energy barrier for hole extraction as the work function of Au NPs is close to the HOMO energy level of P3HT. The efficient hole extraction thus reduce the electron/hole recombination and eventually led to higher open-circuit voltage. Similar results are also reported by Mahmoud and co-workers.59 Meanwhile, the metal/polymer interface may undergo electronic interaction or chemical reaction, which may also induce Voc increase.16,32,60 These beneficial factors however are counteracted when Au NPs are coated with dielectric layer in plasmonic solar cells, which suggest the pros of mitigating metal-mediated losses may nonetheless bring cons of hindering additional charge transportation in the solar cell layer under certain circumstances.
We also blended sole SiO2 spheres into the solar cells for comparison. Without the gold core, the cell would not experience plasmonic effect upon photoexcitation, and as a result all of the main parameters of the device, i.e., Jsc, Voc, FF and η are inferior to that of the plasmonic devices (Table 1). Moreover, addition of the insulating SiO2 NPs in the device is disadvantageous for charge transport. For instance, the large SiO2 NPs with diameter of ∼50 nm as shown by the TEM images (Fig. 2(c)) may deteriorate the contact between electrode and active layer. Hence, the cell exhibited poorer performance than the pristine reference device, albeit the photocurrent density of the former was slightly higher probably due to the scattering of more light by the large sphere size. Likewise, for plasmonic cells embedded with Au@SiO2 NPs, the adverse effects of the insulating shell and the large particle size should also exist, as the decrease of device FF is obvious compared to the reference.
The above discussions indicate that an overall efficiency of a solar cell is determined by a combination of various factors that influence device short-current, open-circuit voltage and fill factor. Although the cell embedded with Au@SiO2 NPs demonstrates the best photocurrent density, its open-circuit voltage and fill factor are not optimized simultaneously. The SiO2 spacer as insulating layer is beneficial for metal-mediated loss mitigation, while may hinder charger transport and enlarge the bulk resistance within the cell. As result, the overall efficiency of Au@SiO2 NP-embedded device is smaller than that of device blended with sole Au NPs. By fine-tuning various relevant parameters, like optimizing the dielectric layer thickness and the amount of embedded plasmonic NPs, however, it may emulate or even outperform Au NP-embedded device.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we improve the photocurrent density of plasmonic solar cells by incorporating Au@SiO2 NPs in the active layer. The dielectric layer encapsulating the metal NPs is supposed to mitigate metal-mediated losses such as exciton quenching in the device but does not block the near-field enhancement of the gold core upon photoexcitation. Note that introduction of dielectric layer also brings cons of hampering the electrical conductivity in the device. Consequently, the cell does not exhibit a superior overall efficiency, indicating coating Au NPs with dielectric layer is one effective way to mitigate metal-mediated losses in plasmonic solar cells but no panacea in enhancing the device performance in every aspect. These various influencing factors discussed in this article however provide a rich pool of tunability tools at handy to improve solar cell performance.
