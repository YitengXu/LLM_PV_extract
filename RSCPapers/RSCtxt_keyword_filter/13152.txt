    , Accepted 21st September 2017First published on 22nd September 2017AbstractHerein, we have investigated the effect of both the bifunctional linker (L1, L2, L3, and L4) and ZnO morphology (porous nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes (NTs-A and NTs-Z)) on the electron injection in CdSe QD sensitized solar cells by first-principles simulation. Via calculating the partitioned interfaces formed by different components (linker/QDs and ZnO/linker), we found that the electronic states of QDs and every ZnO substrate are insensitive to any linker, while the frontier orbitals of L1–L4 (with increased delocalization) manifest a systematical negative-shift. Because of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of L1 compared to its counterparts aligned in the region of the virtual states of QDs or the substrate with a high density of states, it always yields a stronger electronic coupling with QDs and varied substrates. After characterization of the complete ZnO/linker/QD system, we found that the electron injection time (τ) vastly depends on both the linker and substrate. On the one hand, L1 bridged QDs and every substrate always achieve the shortest τ compared to their counterpart associated cases. On the other hand, NW supported systems always yield the shortest τ no matter what the linker is. Overall, the NW/L1/QD system achieves the fastest injection by ∼160 fs. This essentially stems from the shortest molecular length of L1 decreasing the distance between QDs and the substrate, subsequently improving the interfacial coupling. Meanwhile, the NW supported cases generate the less sensitive virtual states for both the QDs and NWs, ensuring a less variable interfacial coupling. These facts combined can provide understanding of the effects contributed from the linker and the oxide semiconductor morphology on charge transfer with the aim of choosing an appropriate component with fast directional electron injection.
Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have aroused wide interest in light harvesting and solar energy conversion which is ascribed to their advantages of multiple exciton generation and tunable absorption by changing size and shape.1–4 As the analogue of a molecular dye, QDs in their sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) play an indispensable role in light capturing and electron transfer into the oxide semiconductor (commonly TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2). The operating principle in QDSSCs involves the processes of generating electron–hole pairs (excitons) in QDs, injecting interfacial electrons from QDs into the conduction band of the oxide semiconductor after exciton dissociation, and reducing of the holes by the hole transfer material (HTM).5,6 Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of QDSSCs still lag behind their molecular dye7 and perovskite counterparts,8 the encouraging PCE of 12%9,10 has very recently been reached.
The restricted performance of QDSSCs is aroused from some detrimental factors, such as the QD surface chemistry11 (trap states, defect, and dangling bond), electron–hole recombination at the QD/oxide semiconductor interface, as well as the incomplete ligand exchange during the complicated synthesis in solution.12,13 Meanwhile, the long-term stability of QDSSCs to the surrounding environment (oxygen, moisture, water etc.) can also affect the PCE pronouncedly.14 To overcome these limitations, some efficient strategies have been proposed, such as using a core/shell structured QD material through epitaxial growth of a second semiconductor material around the QD core, encapsulating the QD core with a molecular ligand, and varying the morphology of the oxide semiconductor.
For constructing a core/shell structure, it has been confirmed that an appropriate shell material can passivate the charge carrier traps and midgap states, suppress charge recombination, and improve the stability of the device, which plays the role of a barrier layer.14,15
Regarding the molecular ligand, it works similar to the shell material in the core/shell structure, and various kinds of molecules have been explored, containing a long- or short-chain aliphatic/aromatic series,16,17 ions18,19 (such as halide20,21), and a metal chalcogenide22–25 ligand. For long- or short-chain series, they commonly possess the opposite ends, for example HS–Ral(Rar)–COOH26 (Ral = aliphatic and Rar = aromatic), which is responsible for connecting QDs and the oxide semiconductor, thus also called a “bifunctional linker26,27”. The exploration of aliphatic and aromatic linkers has shown that these two families can affect the electron injection rate constants (kinj) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) obviously. For kinj, it has been observed that the HS–Rar–COOH sandwiched QDs and substrate yield a larger kinj compared to the HS–Ral–COOH (both of them possess a comparable length) tethered interface, which is imparted by the conjugated backbone for the former tunneling the electron transfer and strengthening the electronic coupling between QDs and substrates.28–30 As for Voc, substituting Rar (commonly the benzene ring) with different electron-donating and -withdrawing functional groups can regulate the interfacial dipole moment and shift the edge of the conduction band of the oxide semiconductor, finally varying the value of Voc.31–33
Regarding the improvement of PCE by varying the morphology of the oxide semiconductor, the widespread strategy is to change the dimensions of the substrate, such as 1-D nanotubes/nanowires/nanorods, 2-D nanosheets, and 3-D nanoparticles, as well as more complicated hybrid nanocomposites.34–38 Previous studies have demonstrated that these special morphologies show a better performance compared to the traditional ones because their oriented and high surface area-to-volume ratios not only favor the directing of electrons to the electrode, but also slow the detrimental recombination.
Although a great many studies have been devoted with the aim of enhancing the performance of QDSSCs from experiment, the deep comprehension of the charge transfer mechanism at the atomic scale is still insufficient. Generally, the distinguished performance can mirror the possibility of manipulating the interfacial electronic energy level alignment and electronic coupling, which is critical not only for understanding the fundamental insights of the charge transfer mechanism, but also for designing new QDSSCs before the real device construction. Thus, an in-depth understanding of interfacial electronic structures from theoretical calculation can rationalize the observed phenomenon, and aid in the design of new components for future applications.
In view of the above-mentioned results, we have theoretically simulated the electron injection rate in a ZnO/linker/CdSe QD system (Scheme 1(a)) by considering the effect of both the varied linker and ZnO morphology from the perspectives of material design and mechanism exploration. For the linker, we have considered the widely studied 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBzA, HS–C6H4–COOH) in previous experiments, and designed another three MBzA derivatives (defined as PDTCA series) where the SH is replaced by NHCSSH,13,39–42 containing PDTCA, PDTCA-E, and PDTCA-T (molecular structures have been shown in Fig. 1(a)). The reasons for designing these novel linkers are as follows: (i) CSSH can anchor on the Cd site in the QDs more strongly compared to SH (the calculated binding energy is shown in Table S1 in the ESI†) and the NHCSSH applied in the ligand for CdSe QDs has been well researched generally. (ii) For PDTCA-E, we want to see the variation of the kinj with further expanding conjugation via replacing the carboxyl by 2-cyanoacrylate. (iii) And to improve the efficient conjugation on top of the PDTCA-E, we attempt to replace the benzene ring by thiophene in PDTCA-T. As for the ZnO morphology, four different nanocomposites containing porous nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires (NWs), single walled nanotubes of (6,6)-armchair (NTs-A) and (9,0)-zigzag (NTs-Z) were considered, where all of them possess a comparable size (details in Fig. 1(c)–(f)).

This paper is organized as follows: in the Methodology section, we introduce the model and theoretical approach on which the simulations are based. And then the Results and discussion are presented. And the final section is the Conclusion.
Methodology
Models
The starting point for CdSe QDs was cut from the bulk wurtzite lattice with a roughly spherical (CdSe)33 core of ∼1.5 nm (Fig. 1(b)). The ZnO NPs (Fig. 1(c)), NWs (Fig. 1(d)), NTs-A (Fig. 1(e)), and NTs-Z (Fig. 1(f)) were constructed based on the bulk wurtzite ZnO nonpolar (100) surface (the details for the construction of these ZnO substrates can be seen in the ESI†).43–46 After obtaining all blocks, the binding mode of the linker tethered on the QDs and substrate should be determined.47 Based on a report,30 the COOH end binds to ZnO via an Olinker–Zn bond, while the SH or CSSH end binds to the Se-terminated (0001) facet in QDs (Fig. 1(b)) via a S–Cd bond, where this surface contains six Cd atoms and three Se atoms.48,49 As we know, the end in the linker is analogous to the anchor group in the molecular dye such that several binding modes can be envisioned after chemisorption,50,51 and different modes can influence the electronic coupling significantly. According to previous reports,47,52,53 we only selected the most stable one (the bidentate bridging (left in Fig. 1(g)) for every end except for the monodentate bridged for SH (right in Fig. 1(g))). Notably, both of them are deprotonated where the H in COOH and SH/CSSH is transferred to a nearby OZnO and Se on the associated surfaces, and all considered linkers can bind to these substrates stably (the calculated adsorption energies of all linkers on QDs and ZnO are shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). For simplification, these four linkers were labeled as L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively (Fig. 1(a)), and the interfaces of linker/QDs and ZnO/linker were defined as Interface-1 and Interface-2, respectively (see Scheme 1(a)).
Computational details
The optimization of the isolated linker, CdSe QDs, ZnO NP/NW/NT-A/NT-Z substrate, linker/QD complex, ZnO/linker complex, and the integral ZnO/linker/CdSe QD system was performed by the CP2K/QUICKSTEP program54,55 combined with a hybrid Gaussian and plane wave basis set based on DFT. The generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)56 of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)57 exchange correlation functional was employed together with norm-conserving Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH)58 pseudopotentials, and when forces were less than 45 meV Å−1 (default value), the structures were considered relaxed. It has been confirmed previously that the varied functionals produce different deviations in the description of the energy gaps.59–61 Although it is well established that electronic structure calculations based on the GGA or LDA functional underestimate energy gaps, they can still be reliable for geometry optimizations compared to the bulk structure. Contrarily, hybrid functionals such as B3LYP62,63 include a portion of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange that can resolve the above problem, providing values of the calculated gaps very close to experimental data (the estimated energy gap performed by varied functionals as implanted in the different programs can be seen in Fig. S2 in the ESI†). And it has been adopted generally in theoretical simulation for larger CdSe clusters (1.3–2 nm in diameter)59 and material interfaces.64–69 Therefore, the single point calculation was performed by the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level (by Gaussian 09 D.01 version70) to simulate the electronic properties on top of the PBE-optimized geometries and subsequent excited state calculations. A plane wave cutoff for the expansion of the density was set to 400 Ry. For Zn, Cd, and Se elements, the short-range, molecularly optimized double-ζ single polarized basis set (DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH) was applied, and for nonmetal elements such as C, H, O, N, and S, the double-ζ single polarized basis set (DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH) was used.71
For simulation of the absorption spectra, an appropriate functional should be selected. It is known that varied functionals can yield different descriptions in transition energy with respect to the experimental value. Among various functionals, the hybrid B3LYP and long-range corrected hybrid CAM-B3LYP were widely used, where the latter one can well treat the electronic states with a possible charge transfer characteristic, and the former one has been verified to reproduce the experimental result with the appropriate balance between simulation time and accuracy.59,68,72 In our previous report, we found that these two functionals can provide similar results to the main transition contribution and intramolecular charge transfer related to the maximum absorption feature, but CAM-B3LYP overestimates the transition energy by ∼1.0 eV compared to B3LYP.73 Therefore, we used the hybrid B3LYP functional combined with the 6-31G(d) (C, H, O, N, and S atoms) and the LANL2DZ (Se, and Cd atoms) basis sets on top of the PBE geometries in whole simulation (the absorption spectra calculated by varied levels can be seen in Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Meanwhile, the first 100 singlet transitions were considered in the solvent methanol according to experiment30 (in the framework of the polarizable continuum model, C-PCM74). As for simulation of the electronic coupling between QDs and the substrate, it was performed using the Gaussian program following the method of Azpiroz et al., and the detailed derivation can be seen in ref. 67.
Results and discussion
To obtain a preliminary understanding of the charge transfer mechanism, we initially investigated the electronic properties in the partitioned Interface-1 and Interface-2 by the Newns–Anderson model75,76 which relates the hybridization between a discrete level (the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO)) of the linker and manifold acceptor states of the capped material (here QDs or ZnO). In detail, when the discrete level of the linker lies within the energy region spanned by the electronic band of the capped material, and if they are strongly coupled, the interactions result in a splitting of the original discrete level into new hybrid orbitals. Contrarily, when the discrete level lies outside the electronic band, even if coupled, the pristine molecular orbitals are hardly hybridized with the manifold acceptor states. Accordingly, this hybridization possesses a Lorentzian distribution:77 (1)where εi is the ith molecular orbital (MO) energy in the complex, EH/L(A) is the HOMO/LUMO energy of the linker after adsorption obtained by a weighted average, and ħΓ describes the broadening width taken as the mean deviation of the HOMO/LUMO levels of the linker and it can be viewed as a critical parameter to comprehend the hybridization quantitatively. And these items are defined as follows:78 (2) (3)where pi in eqn (2) and (3) is the portion of the ith MO for the linker, and it is evaluated by:78 (4)
Notably, this model we used is similar to the assumption by Weiss et al.42 that even though the occupied and virtual orbitals may couple with multiple MOs on the linker, the interaction with the HOMO and the LUMO of the linker is the dominant contribution. Therefore, for simplicity, they restricted their discussion to mixing of the occupied and virtual states of the capped material with only the HOMO and the LUMO of the linker, and similar treatment has been performed by other studies.79
The electronic properties of Interface-1
Based on the calculated energy levels in Scheme 1(b), we find that the HOMO/LUMO levels of all linkers are lower/higher in energy than those of the bare QDs, and the energy level alignment of all linkers relative to QDs potentially generates hybridization in interfacial orbitals, which is similar to the core/shell structure with the type-I energy alignment. Thus we calculate the Lorentzian distribution and the coupling matrix elements associated with this interface to comprehend the interaction unambiguously (Fig. 2).

(e) The coupling matrix elements in these four linker/QD interfaces (the blue and green lines represent the coupling in occupied and virtual states, separately). 
From Fig. 2(a), we find that the HOMO and LUMO levels of QDs after capping L1 are slightly shifted by 0.10 eV, which is evidenced by the similar projected density of states (PDOS(QDs), the pink solid line) and the total density of states (DOS(bare QDs), the pink dot line). Contrarily, the EH(A) and EL(A) of L1 estimated by eqn (2) (−6.84 and −2.25 eV, the gray solid lines) all produce an apparent negative-shift by ΔEH = 0.52 eV and ΔEL = 0.87 eV compared to that in the isolated molecule (the gray dot lines). Meanwhile, the ħΓ which quantitatively characterizes the broadening width of the molecular orbital based on eqn (3) shows a significant mixing of the frontier orbitals of L1 with the occupied and virtual states of QDs, and the LUMO(L1) yields a wider spanning (0.463 eV) with respect to the HOMO(L1) (0.274 eV), which can also be understood by the coupling matrix elements intuitively (Fig. 2(e)). From the point of orbital matching, when the HOMO or the LUMO of the linker aligned in the region of the occupied or virtual states of QDs with a low density of states near the edge, a small number of occupied or virtual orbitals are resonant with the linker's orbital (the left in Scheme 2), and vice versa (the right in Scheme 2). For L1/QDs, the HOMO(L1) belongs to the former, and the LUMO(L1) is assigned to the latter.
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the hybridized orbitals created by mixing of occupied/virtual states of substrate or QDs with the HOMO/LUMO of linker in the region with low (left) and high (right) density of states near the edge of the states. 
Similar to the situation in L1/QDs, the PDOS(QDs) and DOS(bare QDs) develop an almost identical trend in the L2/QD interface. Meanwhile, L2 makes a significant difference in frontier orbital energy before and after capping, and the ΔEH is more distinct than the ΔEL (1.39 eV vs. 0.84 eV). Because of the negligible variation in the occupied and virtual states of QDs and the more negatively shifted HOMO(L2) and LUMO(L2) compared to that of L1, the HOMO(L2) approaches the region of the occupied states of QDs with a high density of states, while the LUMO(L2) tends to approach the region of the virtual states with a low density of states. Consequently, the energetic resonance of the interfacial orbital between L2 and QDs changes obviously. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (e), the HOMO(L2) presents a slightly stronger coupling than the LUMO(L2) in the interfaces, which is quantitatively manifested by the wider spanning of the HOMO (ħΓ = 0.212 eV) with regard to the LUMO (ħΓ = 0.185 eV), generating comparable coupling matrix elements.
Concerning the more delocalized L3, it still leads to a negligible effect on QDs, and the HOMO(L3) produces a more remarkable downward trend compared to the LUMO(L3) (ΔEH and ΔEL are 0.71 and 0.29 eV, Fig. 2(c)). This pronounced downward trend for HOMO(L3) leads to its alignment in the region of the occupied states of QDs with nearly the highest density of states, and hence triggers the electronic coupling apparently stronger than that in the virtual states (the ħΓ of HOMO(L3) vs. LUMO(L3) is 0.379 eV vs. 0.179 eV, and the coupling matrix elements in the virtual states are smaller than that in the occupied states).
As for the L4/QD interface (Fig. 2(d)), the electronic states of QDs remains resistant to the most conjugated L4, while the HOMO(L4) and the LUMO(L4) separately yield the strongest and the weakest interactions with the occupied and virtual states of QDs compared to other linkers.
Based on the assessed interfacial electronic structures in Interface-1, we obtain that (i) the electronic states of the QDs are insensitive to all considered linkers. (ii) With the increasing of the delocalization from L1–L4, the HOMO and the LUMO display a systematical negative-shift. (iii) Because the electronic states of QDs are resistant to the considered linkers, the apparent variation in orbital matching between the linker and QDs is contributed from the facile molecular orbital for the linker. For L1/QDs, the higher LUMO(L1) compared to other linkers makes it aligned in the region of the virtual state of QDs with a higher density of states, increasing the energetic resonance in virtual orbitals between QDs and L1, and leading to the strongest coupling in their interface. Simultaneously, the highest HOMO(L1) with regard to other linkers is aligned in the region of the occupied states of QDs with a lower density of states, decreasing the energetic resonance, and weakening the interfacial coupling. While for other linkers, the trend of the HOMO and the LUMO changes gradually to the opposite scenario, indicating that the electron dominated wave function delocalization in the L1/QD interface turns into the hole dominated feature by passing through L2/QD, L3/QD, and L4/QD interfaces.42 (iv) From the viewpoint of interfacial electron transfer, the higher molecular LUMO relative to the edge of the virtual states of QDs can generate a larger electron injection driving force (ΔGe) with respect to the lower one. In L1/QDs, the electron transfer is facile from L1 to QDs, and with the LUMO downward, the electron transfer tends from QDs to the linker (especially in L4/QDs), suppressing the efficient electron injection to the electron-acceptor (ZnO) subsequently. In other words, even though L1 possesses a larger energy gap compared to L2, L3, and L4 which hardly involves electron excitation, the electron transfer from QDs to L1 is more difficult to occur than others (the details can be seen in optical properties in the ESI†). These facts combined reveal that L1 is more appropriate than others for matching with CdSe QDs. Furthermore, the systematic variation of the HOMO and LUMO levels relative to the insensitive QDs reveals that the ΔGe from the linker to QDs decreases from L1 to L4, while the hole injection driving force (ΔGh) from the linker to QDs increases, increasing the possibility of hole accumulation in QDs, especially in L4/QDs, potentially favoring the recombination.15,80
The electronic properties of Interface-2
In this section, we will turn our concentration on the interface formed between the linker and ZnO (Interface-2) with the aim of investigating the coupling of the linker with various ZnO substrates. In contrast to the scenario in Interface-1, the HOMO level of all linkers in Interface-2 locates in the energy gap of ZnO, therefore we assume that the HOMO of all linkers hardly hybridizes with the occupied states of ZnO, and the discussion on electronic coupling in this interface is only limited in the virtual orbitals. Meanwhile, similar to the situation of QDs, the PDOS(ZnO) of every morphology abstracted from the ZnO/linker complex is almost identical to the DOS(bare ZnO) (not shown), thus, the variation of the edge of the occupied and virtual states of ZnO will be not analyzed.
From Fig. 3(a), the EL(A)(L1) (the pink solid lines) varies with the changing of NPs, NTs-A, NWs, and NTs-Z (−1.13, −1.21, −1.23, and −2.19 eV), and the ΔEL(L1) are 0.25, 0.17, 0.15, and 0.81 eV, respectively. Consequently, the LUMO(L1) broadens on these substrates by 0.064, 0.100, 0.048, and 0.084 eV, respectively, showing that the interaction of L1 with NTs-A is the strongest than that with other substrates. This can be further manifested by the larger coupling matrix elements in Fig. 3(b). Similarly, this can be accounted for by the orbital matching in that the LUMO(L1) is aligned appropriately in the region of the virtual states of NTs-A with a high density of states, and thus a large number of virtual orbitals of NTs-A are resonant with the LUMO(L1).
 Fig. 3  (a) The fitted Lorentzian curve ρLUMO (the blue lines) and the LUMO level of linkers L1, L2, L3, and L4 before (the pink dot lines) and after (the pink solid lines) adsorption on ZnO NPs, NWs, NTs-A, and NTs-Z (the data labeled in plots are the ħΓ, EL(A), and ΔEL, unit in eV). (b) The coupling matrix elements in every substrate/linker interface. 
After replacing L1 by L2 on NPs, NTs-A, NWs, and NTs-Z, the change tendency of LUMO(L2) is identical to that of LUMO(L1), and the ΔEL(L2) is assessed to be 0.36, 0.17, 0.09, and 0.58 eV, respectively. This recognizable LUMO(L2) on these corresponding substrates translates into the effective broadening of 0.038, 0.085, 0.025, and 0.020 eV. Combined with the coupling elements in Fig. 3(b) (the second column), NTs-A achieves the strongest electronic coupling with L2 in this set undoubtedly.
Then concerning L3, the EL(A)(L3) are estimated to be −2.50, −2.55, −2.67, and −3.36 eV on NPs, NTs-A, NWs, and NTs-Z, which in turn determines their ħΓ to be 0.016, 0.044, 0.028, and 0.025 eV, respectively. This comparable broadening for LUMO(L3) is attributed to the fact that the virtual orbital resonances of these substrates with the LUMO(L3) are comparable, thus leading to comparable coupling.
As for L4, the EL(A)(L4) are assessed to be −2.59, −2.65, −2.75, and −3.47 eV after being attached on NPs, NTs-A, NWs, and NTs-Z, and the lower-lying LUMO(L4) compared to the other three counterparts on these corresponding substrates generates the smallest number of energetic resonance in the ZnO/L4 interface, reflected by the smaller broadening for LUMO(L4) of 0.014, 0.018, 0.012, and 0.028 eV, respectively, as well as the weakest coupling in the order of magnitude of ∼10−3.
Based on the assessed interfacial electronic properties in Interface-2, we find that (i) the LUMO level is systematically negative-shifted with the strengthened delocalization from L1 to L4 on any one of the considered substrates. (ii) The LUMO level for any one of the considered linkers systematically decreases after tethering on NPs, NTs-A, NWs, and NTs-Z separately. (iii) The lower-lying LUMO level inclines to be away from the region of virtual states of the substrate with a high density of states, and the different extents in orbital overlapping between varied linkers and substrates yield a discriminable interfacial energetic resonance and coupling. Therefore, (i)–(iii) combined determine that L4 attached NTs-Z is less able to facilitate electron tunneling through the interface. (iv) Interestingly, nearly every linker produces the smallest variation in the LUMO level before and after they capped on NWs, indicating that all of them can form the most stabilized interfacial state with NWs. (v) And lastly, the electronic coupling in Interface-2 is less strengthened than that in Interface-1.
The electron injection rate
After evaluating the electronic structures in partitioned interfaces, we will construct the integrated ZnO/linker/CdSe QD system to investigate the critical process of electron injection by means of estimating the electron injection rate constant kinj based on the Fermi golden rule, which characterizes the electron transfer from a single state (d) of the QDs to a manifold of acceptor states (k) of ZnO:66,67 (5)where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, Vdk is the electronic coupling between donor (QDs) and acceptor states (ZnO), and ρ(εd) is the density of states of the ZnO substrate estimated at the donor energy. For Vdk, it has been computed by evaluating the off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian H projected on the donor (QDs, d) and acceptor (ZnO, k) states of the individual monomers: 〈ϕQD|Ĥ|ϕZnO〉(6)
Notably, because of the more strengthened coupling of the linker with QDs than that with varied substrates, we treat the linker/QD complex as a complete donor which is similar to the core/shell structure. And all optimized ZnO/linker/QD structures are shown in Fig. S4–S7 in the ESI† (the detailed derivation of the electronic coupling elements can be seen in ref. 67). To provide a visualized comparison, we have translated the kinj into the injection time τ (τ = 1/kinj), and all related parameters are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4.

Clearly from Fig. 4, the τ decreases from 3.50, 1.85, 1.73 to 0.16 ps when the QDs tethered on NTs-A, NPs, NTs-Z, and NWs by L1. After replacing L1 by L2, the τ shortens with NPs, NTs-Z, NTs-A, and NWs (69.93, 13.16, 9.71, and 2.79 ps). Concerning the τ in L3 mediated QDs and substrates, it decays with the variation of NPs, NTs-A, NTs-Z, and NWs (39.84, 15.85, 12.99, and 2.16 ps), respectively. As for L4 sandwiched interfaces, the variation in τ follows the order of 22.94, 5.78, 3.77, and 1.34 ps with NTs-A, NPs, NTs-Z, and NWs as substrates respectively.
On the other hand, different linker tethered identical substrates can also yield recognizable τ apparently. For any one of the NPs, NWs, or NTs-Z, the τ decreases systematically with variation of L2, L3, L4, and L1, while a different situation is detected in NT-A supported cases that the τ decreases with L4, L3, L2, and L1.
Consequently, L1 mediated QDs with any one of the NPs, NWs, NTs-Z, and NTs-A can all generate the shortest τ compared to other linkers on the one hand, and NW supported QDs bridged by any one of the considered linkers always yield the shortest τ compared to other substrates on the other hand. Remarkably, L1 bridged QDs and ZnO-(100) facet in varied morphologies overwhelmingly achieve ultrafast electron injection (the maximum τ (τmax) ∼160 fs for NWs as substrates) compared to their counterparts in this work. This reminds us that L1 bridged other QDs and oxide semiconductors generally achieve a faster electron injection than their analogues with a comparable alkane chain or more delocalized backbone. For example, Watson et al.26,29 have measured the τ less than 10−8 s for L1 bridged CdS QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles, after replacing L1 by SH–(CH2)4–COOH which possesses a similar molecular length, and the τ is prolonged obviously. This can be reasoned by the fact that L1 would provide increased electronic coupling and better-defined distance between QDs and TiO2. Moreover, Cánovas et al.28 have measured L1 bridged CdSe QDs and the SnO2 substrate, and the τ is 2 ps (kinj = 5.00 × 1011 s−1). When changing L1 by the shorter SH–(CH2)3–COOH and the more delocalized SH–(C6H4)2–COOH, the τ delays to 25 ps (kinj = 4.00 × 1010 s−1) and 7 ps (kinj = 1.42 × 1011 s−1), respectively. Furthermore, Hansen and Pullerits et al.79 characterized the τ of SH–CH2–COOH and SH–(CH2)2–COOH sandwiched CdSe QDs and ZnO nanorod/nanowire interfaces via experiment combined with theoretical calculation, and they obtained τ of 3.8 and 16 ps. These findings together indicate the capability of molecular length and delocalization of linker fine tuning the electron-transfer rates.
To shed light on the essence of the distinct τ after making some change in the linker or substrate, the critical factor of electronic coupling which directly influences the τ will be analyzed and discussed in detail. As observed above, the τ in any one of the NP, NW, or NT-Z supported systems is delayed strictly by passing from L1, L4, L3, and L2. And it varies with L1, L2, L3, and L4 when NTs-A is the substrate. Regarding the molecular length which increases in the order of L1 < L2 < L4 < L3 (6.97, 8.96, 10.54, and 10.94 Å), we observe that except for the shortest L1, tethered QDs achieve the strongest coupling with every substrate (|Vdk|2 ranges in 10−3 ∼ 10−4 eV2), and the longer counterpart bridged interfaces tend to weaken the electronic coupling apparently by 1–2 orders of magnitude (Fig. 5). The difference in τ between L1 and other linker (PDTCA series) mediated systems is ascribed to the competing effect between the molecular length and interfacial coupling. For L1, although it possesses the shortest molecular length which turns into a more localized feature compared to the other three ones, the smallest distance between QDs and the substrate achieves the strongest interfacial coupling. Therefore, both molecular length and delocalization are critical factors for improving charge transfer. Remarkably, this result is different from our previous investigation that the τ estimated in the L2 bridged CdSe QDs and TiO2 NP systems is slightly faster than that in the L1 mediated system (1.41 × 1011 s−1vs. 1.29 × 1011 s−1).73 And this can well illustrate the competing effect that the increased interfacial coupling outweighs the increased distance.
 Fig. 5  Electronic coupling as a function of molecular length and energy gap for linkers L1–L4 bridging (a) the QDs and NPs, (b) the QDs and NWs, (c) the QDs and NTs-Z, and (d) the QDs and NTs-A, respectively. 
On the other hand, during the resolution of the remarkable τ in varied substrate supported systems, we find that the reason for NW constructed cases always leading to the strongest coupling with the QDs compared to other substrates is predominantly the less sensitive virtual states for both of the QDs and NWs upon any considered linker tethering. From Table 1, the variations of the LUMO energy for QDs (ΔEL(QDs)) and NWs (ΔEL(NWs)) before and after being bridged by L1–L4 are subtle (0.50, 0.08, 0.07, 0.05 eV for QDs, and 0.10, 0.06, 0.09, and 0.11 eV for NWs), leading to a similar coupling in interfaces (|Vdk|2 is 10−3 order of magnitude for the L1 bridged case, and 10−4 order of magnitude for L2–L4 bridged cases), hence, a less difference in τ is obtained. However, for the other substrate supported systems, both of the sensitive virtual states for QDs and the substrate after mediated by different linkers have been detected, which translates into the significantly varied coupling, for example, the |Vdk|2 is 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6 orders of magnitude for L1, L3, and L2 bridged QDs and NPs, accounting for the completely different picture with regard to NW bearing systems.
Undoubtedly, the electron injection rate vastly depends on both the linker and the morphology of the substrate. For the linker, the extending conjugation of L2–L4 cannot shorten the τ with respect to the reference L1 on all considered substrates, which is attributed to the shortest molecular length of L1 decreasing the distance between QDs and substrate, and subsequently improving the interfacial coupling. This illustrates that a short and delocalized linker is designed for future application. As for the morphology of ZnO, NW supported systems always show the fastest electron injection overwhelmingly (τmax < 3 ps) compared to other substrates no matter what the linker is. Then NT-Z associated systems produce a moderate τ (τmax < 14 ps), and NP and NT-A supported systems yield the longest τ (τmax ∼ 70 ps). This is mainly aroused from the less sensitive virtual states for both the QDs and NWs to every capped linker, ensuring a less variable coupling between QDs and substrate. While in NP, NT-A, and NT-Z based systems, the facile virtual states for both the substrate and QDs potentially lead to coupling and decoupling to a different extent.
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the effect of both the bifunctional linker (L1–L4) and ZnO morphology (NPs, NWs, NTs-A, and NTs-Z) on electron injection in QDSSCs. We found that the electron injection rate vastly depends on both the linker and the morphology of the substrate. On the one hand, L1 bridged cases achieve the shortest τ, while L2, L3, and L4 bridged cases prolong the τ apparently. On the other hand, ZnO NW supported systems always yield the shortest τ (τmax < 3 ps), followed by NT-Z (with moderate τ (τmax < 14 ps)), NP, and NT-A supported systems (the τ ranges from several to tens of picoseconds). Overall, the NW/L1/QD system achieves the fastest injection by ∼160 fs. These essentially stem from the shortest molecular length of L1 decreasing the distance between the QDs and substrate, and subsequently improving the interfacial coupling. Meanwhile, the NW supported cases generate less sensitive virtual states for the QDs and NWs with any one of the considered linkers bridged, ensuring a less variable coupling between QDs and NWs. While in NP, NT-A, and NT-Z based systems, the sensitive virtual states for both the substrate and QDs potentially lead to coupling and decoupling between these components to a different extent. We hope that these can provide understanding of the effects contributed from the linker and the oxide semiconductor morphology on charge transfer with the aim of choosing an appropriate component with fast directional electron injection.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  (a) Representation of CdSe QD sensitized solar cells (Interface-1 represents the linker/QD interfaces, and Interface-2 represents the ZnO/linker interfaces). (b) Schematic energy level alignments between the ZnO (pink lines), linker (orange lines), and CdSe QDs (grey lines) in considered ZnO/linker/QD system.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a)–(f) The models employed in this work: linkers L1–L4, the ∼1.5 nm CdSe QDs, the ZnO NPs, NWs, NTs-A, and NTs-Z. (g) The considered binding modes: the bidentate bridging for COOH/CSSH (left) and monodentate bridging (right) (light gray = Zn, red = O, dark gray = Cd, light yellow = Se, pink = H, blue = N, brown = C, yellow = S atoms).

 	Fig. 2  The projected density of states (PDOS) of CdSe QDs (the pink solid lines) abstracted from the linker/QD complexes, the total density of states (DOS) of bare CdSe QDs (the pink dot lines), the fitted Lorentzian curves, ρHOMO (the blue lines) and ρLUMO (the green lines) of linker, and the HOMO and LUMO levels of linker before (the gray dot lines) and after (the gray solid lines) capping on QDs: (a) L1/QDs, (b) L2/QDs, (c) L3/QDs, and (d) L4/QDs, respectively (the data labeled in plots are the energies of the frontier orbitals and their effective broadening ħΓ, and the data in parentheses are the variation in frontier molecular orbital energies (ΔEH and ΔEL) before and after capping on QDs, unit in eV). (e) The coupling matrix elements in these four linker/QD interfaces (the blue and green lines represent the coupling in occupied and virtual states, separately).	 

 	Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the hybridized orbitals created by mixing of occupied/virtual states of substrate or QDs with the HOMO/LUMO of linker in the region with low (left) and high (right) density of states near the edge of the states.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The fitted Lorentzian curve ρLUMO (the blue lines) and the LUMO level of linkers L1, L2, L3, and L4 before (the pink dot lines) and after (the pink solid lines) adsorption on ZnO NPs, NWs, NTs-A, and NTs-Z (the data labeled in plots are the ħΓ, EL(A), and ΔEL, unit in eV). (b) The coupling matrix elements in every substrate/linker interface.
