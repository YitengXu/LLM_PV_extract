    , Accepted 7th July 2015First published on 8th July 2015AbstractThree thiazole-bridged DPP polymers with deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were designed for field-effect transistors (FETs) and polymer–polymer solar cells. By introducing thiazole–thiazole coupled segments, perfluoroalkyl side chains or strong electron-deficient naphthalenediimide units into the conjugated backbone the three thiazole-bridged DPP polymers have LUMO levels of −4.0 to −4.4 eV. The three DPP polymers exhibit optical absorption in the near-infrared region, crystallinity and an electron mobility of around 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 in bottom contact FETs. The polymers were applied as electron acceptors in polymer–polymer solar cells to provide PCEs of around 0.4%. The low PCEs are mainly due to low short-circuit currents (Jsc) and attributed to large phase separation. Our results demonstrate several efficient strategies to lower the energy levels of conjugated polymers in order to be used as universal acceptors for photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells comprising conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors have successfully achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10% in recent years.1–3 The application of conjugated polymers as electron acceptors to replace fullerene derivatives has also attracted increasing attention,4 even though polymer–polymer solar cells provide lower maximum PCEs of around 6% than polymer–fullerene solar cells.5–8 Compared to the small-molecule fullerene derivatives, extended conjugated polymers provide better thermal stability of the morphology in photovoltaic devices. In addition, the chemical structure of polymer acceptors can be intentionally modified to tune their absorption spectra, energy levels, charge transport properties and crystallinity. It can be expected that the PCE of polymer–polymer solar cells will approach the PCE of polymer–fullerene solar cells when new polymer acceptors are systematically explored together with morphology and device optimization.
The success of fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) in high efficient photovoltaic cells is mainly attributed to their high electron mobility, high crystallinity and suitable energy level for charge separation and transportation.9 PCBM possesses a deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level below −4.0 eV and a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level below −6.0 eV10 and can be applied as an almost universal electron acceptor in combination with numerous conjugated polymers as electron donors. Polymer acceptors with a LUMO below −4.0 eV have also been reported and are generally based on perylenediimide (PDI)11–13 and naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives.8,14–16Other building blocks, such as benzothiadiazole (BT),17 isoindigo18 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),7,19–22 have also been used in electron accepting polymers for polymer–polymer solar cells, but they usually possess higher-lying LUMO levels. While most studies have focused on designing polymer acceptors with high-lying LUMO to afford a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in polymer–polymer solar cells, it is also useful to explore polymer acceptors with lower lying LUMO levels similar to PCBM.
In this work, we attempt to develop conjugated polymers as electron acceptors based on electron-deficient DPP units, aiming at obtaining a deep LUMO level. Several DPP-based conjugated polymers exhibit high hole and electron mobilities of around 10 cm2 V−1 s−1,23–25 and high PCEs above 8% as electron donors.26–28 Upon introducing thiazole (Tz) into the conjugated backbone of DPP polymers, the LUMO of the resulting PDPP2TzT polymer is reduced −4.0 eV due to the electronegative imine nitrogens (CN–C) and an electron mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been achieved.21 As a consequence, PDPP2TzT can be successfully applied as an electron acceptor to yield a PCE of 2.9% in polymer–polymer solar cells.21 The high-lying LUMO of thiazole-bridged DPP polymers can be realized by introducing electron-rich copolymerized units into the conjugated backbone.22
In order to achieve a low-lying LUMO in DPP polymers, three thiazole-bridged DPP polymers were designed and synthesized, as shown in Fig. 1. We show below that PDPP2Tz with thiazole–thiazole coupled segments has a LUMO of −4.03 eV. In PDPP2TzFBDT, when Tz–DPP–Tz alternates with perfluoroalkyl thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (FBDT) the LUMO is lowered to −4.16 eV. Further deepening of the LUMO to −4.4 eV is realized in PDPP2TzNDI, an acceptor–acceptor polymer consisting of Tz–DPP–Tz and NDI. These three polymers possess electron mobilities of around 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 in bottom contact field-effect transistors (FETs). The polymers were applied in polymer solar cells as electron acceptors, but provided low PCEs of 0.4%. Our results pave an efficient way to design polymer acceptors with deep LUMO levels that can be used as universal electron acceptors for polymer–polymer solar cells.

Experimental
Materials and measurements
All synthetic procedures were performed under an Ar atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. THF and toluene were distilled from sodium under an Ar atmosphere and benzophenone was used as an indicator. 2-Perfluorohexylthiophene,29 3,6-bis(5-bromothiazol-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (4),30 3,6-bis(5-bromothiazol-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (6),22 2,7-dioctyl-4,9-bis(trimethylstannyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (7)31 and the polymer PDPP5T32 were synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature.
The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The molecular weight of DPP polymers was determined by GPC at 140 °C on a PL-GPC 220 system using a PL-GEL 10 μm MIXED-B column and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as the eluent against polystyrene standards. A low concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 of the polymer in o-DCB was applied to reduce aggregation. The electronic spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed under an inert atmosphere at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. An ITO glass slide covered with a thin layer polymer (approx. 20 nm) was used as the working electrode. The counter and reference electrodes were a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl, respectively. All potentials were referenced against Fc/Fc+. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in reflection mode at 40 kV and 200 mA with Cu Kα radiation using a 2-kW Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory by using the Gaussian 09 program package. The atomic force microscope (AFM) images were recorded using a digital instruments nanoscope IIIa multimode atomic force microscope in tapping mode.
The organic field-effect transistors were fabricated using heavily doped silicon wafers as the common gate electrode with a 300 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 layer, which was modified by OTS as the gate dielectric. Au electrodes (25 nm) were vacuum deposited first and then polymer thin films were spin coated on the substrate from chloroform solution with a thickness of around 30–50 nm. The devices were thermally annealed at temperatures of 140–160 °C in a high vacuum chamber for 2 h, cooled down and then moved into a glovebox filled with N2. The devices were measured on an Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyser at room temperature.
The photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating poly-(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP AI 4083) onto precleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (15 Ω per square). The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating a chloroform solution containing PDPP5T and DPP polymer acceptors with a 1:1 (w/w) or 2:1 (w/w) ratio and the appropriate amount of processing additive such as diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) or o-DCB. Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation at ∼1 × 10−5 Pa as the back electrode. The active area of the cells was 0.04 cm2. An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI standards Inc. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted using a computer-controlled Agilent B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit. The extern quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

n-Butyllithium (2.4 M in hexane, 2.50 mL, 6.0 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 2-perfluorohexylthiophene (2.20 g, 5.5 mmol) in THF (15 mL) at −78 °C. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, 4,8-dehydrobenzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (0.55 g, 2.5 mmol) (1) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 1 h at −78 °C. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. A mixture of SnCl2·2H2O (9 g, 40 mmol) in 10% HCl (16 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for additional 1.5 h, after which it was poured into ice water. The mixture was extracted with petroleum ether twice and the combined organic phases were concentrated to obtain the crude compound 2. Further purification was carried out by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether as the eluent to obtain pure compound 2 as a pale yellow viscous liquid (1.35 g, yield 55%).1H NMR (CDCl3): δ = 7.60 (d, 2H), 7.55 (s, 4H), 7.50 (d, 2H). 19F NMR (CDCl3): δ = −80.72, −101.09, −121.35, −122.69, −126.01.

A solution of 2 (0.75 g, 0.76 mmol) in THF (15 mL) at −78 °C was placed in a 50 mL argon purged flask, and then n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane, 1 mL, 1.6 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 2 h at −78 °C. Subsequently, trimethyltin chloride (1.0 M in hexane, 1.7 mL, 1.7 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at ambient temperature. Then, the mixture was extracted using dichloromethane and the combined organic phase was concentrated. Further purification was carried out by recrystallization using ethanol to obtain the pure compound as a yellow solid (0.45 g, yield 45%). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ = 7.61 (d, 2H), 7.56 (s, 2H), 7.52 (d, 2H), 0.42 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 145.41, 144.39, 143.67, 140.02, 137.54, 130.69, 130.13, 129.77, 129.48, 128.23, 120.96, 77.34, 77.23, 77.02, 76.71, −0.00, −6.46, −6.54, −8.32, −10.09, −10.18. 19F NMR (CDCl3): δ = −80.73, −100.92, −121.42, −122.65, −126.00.
PDPP2Tz
To a degassed solution of monomer (4) (66.93 mg, 0.084 mmol), hexabutylditin (48.73 mg, 0.084 mmol) (5) in toluene (1.5 mL) and DMF (0.15 mL), Pd2(dba)3 (2.29 mg, 2.5 μmol), triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (2.62 mg, 10.0 μmol) and CuI (3.24 mg, 0.017 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 24 h, after which it was precipitated into methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted with acetone, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was reduced and the polymer was precipitated in acetone. The polymer was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield PDPP2Tz (36 mg, 67%) as a dark solid. GPC (o-DCB, 140 °C): Mn = 8.6 kg mol−1 and PDI = 1.72.
PDPP2TzFBDT
To a degassed solution of monomer 6 (75.83 mg, 0.074 mmol), 3 (97.40 mg, 0.074 mmol) in toluene (1.5 mL) and DMF (0.15 mL), Pd2(dba)3 (2.01 mg, 2.2 μmol) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (2.31 mg, 8.8 μmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 24 h, after which it was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted using acetone, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was reduced and the polymer was precipitated in acetone. The polymer was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield PDPP2TzFBDT (106 mg, 77%) as a dark solid. GPC (o-DCB, 140 °C): Mn = 13.1 kg mol−1 and PDI = 1.74 (the polymer is only partially dissolved in o-DCB at 140 °C).
PDPP2TzNDI
The same procedure as for PDPP2Tz was used, but now 6 (81.70 mg, 0.080 mmol) and 7 (85.58 mg, 0.080 mmol) were used as monomers. Yield: 72 mg, 67%. GPC (o-DCB, 140 °C): Mn = 44.9 kg mol−1 and PDI = 2.53.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the monomers and polymers are presented in Scheme 1. The bistannyl-FBDT (3) monomer was synthesized using similar methods reported in the literature33 and were recrystallized to high purity, which is beneficial for efficient polymerization. The polymers were prepared from dibromo-2TzDPP monomers (4 or 6) and bistannyl compounds (3, 5, 7) by Stille polymerization, in which Pd2(dba)3/PPh3 with or without CuI as the catalyst and toluene/DMF as the solvent were used to achieve optimized molecular weights. 2-Butyloctyl (BO) for PDPP2Tz and 2-octyldodecyl (OD) for PDPP2TzFBDT and PDPP2TzNDI were used as side chains on DPP to optimize solubility. The molecular weight of the polymers was determined by GPC measurement using o-DCB at 140 °C as the eluent and a low polymer concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 was used to reduce aggregation (Fig. S1, ESI†). PDPP2Tz has a relatively low molecular weight of Mn = 8.6 kg mol−1 (Table 1), which may be caused by the lower reactivity of hexabutylditin. Under the same polymerization conditions, PDPP2TzNDI gave a high Mn = 44.9 kg mol−1. For PDPP2TzFBDT with perfluorohexyl side chains, the high molecular weight fraction was insoluble in o-DCB even at 140 °C, and only a low molecular weight fraction was measured, giving Mn = 13.1 kg mol−1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the DPP polymers in chloroform solution and as thin films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 2a, and the data are summarized in Table 1. All polymers exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra in thin films compared to solution spectra, indicating aggregation in the solid state. PDPP2Tz has an optical band gap of Eg = 1.37 eV, which is lower than that of PDPP2TzT which has an additional thiophene as a co-unit (Eg = 1.47 eV).21 PDPP2TzFBDT has an Eg = 1.58 eV, which is slightly higher than that of PDPP2TzBDT with benzodithiophene (BDT) (Eg = 1.53 eV).22 PDPP2TzNDI with an electron-deficient DPP core and NDI give an Eg of 1.53 eV, which is much larger than that of its analogue PNDI-DPP (Eg = 1.15 eV) with thiophene as bridges,34 indicating the strong influence of thiazole on the optical properties.
 Fig. 2  (a) Optical absorption spectra of the polymers in solid state films and (b) HOMO and LUMO levels determined from cyclic voltammetry. 
The frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on thin films (Fig. 2b, Table 1 and Fig. S3, ESI†). For comparison, [70]PCBM gave a LUMO of −4.16 eV and a HOMO of −6.15 eV in our measurements (Fig. S3b, ESI†). PDPP2Tz has a LUMO of −4.03 eV and a HOMO of −5.40 eV. Upon introducing perfluorohexyl units, PDPP2TzFBDT shows a similar LUMO as [70]PCBM of −4.16 eV and a HOMO of −5.74 eV. It is interesting to note that PDPP2TzBDT, without perfluoroalkyl side groups, has a LUMO of −4.0 eV,22 indicating that the side chains can effectively tailor the energy levels. Further lowering of the LUMO and HOMO was realized by incorporating two electron-deficient units, DPP and NDI. PDPP2TzNDI has a LUMO of −4.40 eV and a HOMO of −5.93 eV. The deep LUMO of PDPP2TzNDI compared to that of PCBM should provide a larger driving force for exciton dissociation into free charges in polymer–polymer solar cells, but of course a concomitant loss in Voc.
The delocalization of the frontier orbitals over the conjugated backbone and the expected energy levels were further studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. 3). In the DFT calculations, methyl and trifluoromethyl units were used to replace long alkyl chains and perfluorohexyl units in order to reduce the calculation time. For PDPP2Tz and PDPP2TzFBDT, both HOMO and LUMO levels are delocalized along the conjugated backbone. However, PDPP2TzNDI has a more localized HOMO on the DPP-segment and a LUMO on the NDI-segment. In addition, the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels show similar trends as in electro-chemical measurement that increase from PDPP2Tz to PDPP2TzFBDT and PDPP2TzNDI.

Thin polymer films on Si substrates were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the molecular packing. The polymer thin films were drop cast from chloroform solutions and thermally annealed at the temperatures indicated in Table 2. The polymers exhibit (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.67° (PDPP2Tz), 6.17° (PDPP2TzFBDT) and 4.61° (PDPP2TzNDI), corresponding to the lamellar spacings of 1.89 nm, 1.43 nm and 1.92 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). The PDPP2TzFBDT film also shows an additional broad peak (010) at 23.7°, corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 0.37 nm.

Charge carrier mobility
The electron mobility of the conjugated polymers is important for the efficient polymer–polymer solar cells. High electron mobility assists charge transport to the electrodes and reduces recombination. The mobilities of the polymers were determined in a bottom gate–bottom contact FET configuration, where a highly n-doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer, which contained strip gold electrodes, was passivated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayers. DPP polymers were dissolved in chloroform and spin-coated on the substrates. The devices were thermally annealed at 140–160 °C (Table 2) and measured under an inert atmosphere. Typical transistor transfer and output characteristics are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). OFETs based on the as cast polymer thin films were also characterized and showed much lower charge carrier mobilities (Table S1, ESI†) than those of the devices after thermal annealing (Table 2). The improved mobilities after thermal annealing can be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity, which was also observed in other conjugated polymer FETs.35 AFM revealed that the roughness of the polymer thin films was increased after thermal annealing, indicating better aggregation (Fig. S5, ESI†). PDPP2Tz and PDPP2TzFBDT exhibit ambipolar transfer characteristics with high electron mobility compared to their hole mobility (Fig. 5 and Table 2). PDPP2TzNDI only shows an electron mobility of 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobilities of these DPP polymers are comparable to those of other electron acceptors such as P(NDI2OD-T2) in the same device configuration.36

Polymer–polymer solar cells performance
The DPP polymers in this work show optical absorption in the near-infrared region, deep LUMOs, crystallinity and sufficiently high electron mobility, making them of interest for application as electron acceptors for polymer–polymer solar cells. In this work, we selected another DPP polymer PDPP5T as an electron donor to construct photovoltaic devices.21 PDPP5T with DPP as the core alternating with five thiophene rings as repeating units has been successfully applied into polymer–polymer solar cells combined with PDPP2TzT as an electron acceptor.21 By applying cyclic voltammetry as performed for the three acceptor DPP polymers, the HOMO and LUMO levels of PDPP5T were determined to be −4.89 eV and −3.45 eV (Fig. 2b and Fig. S3a, ESI†). Therefore, both the HOMO and LUMO offsets between PDPP5T and the DPP polymers in this work are larger than 0.3 eV, which ensure enough driving force for exciton dissociation into free charges.37
Polymer–polymer solar cells were fabricated by using ITO/PEDOT:PSS and Ca/Al as electrodes. The photo-active layers, consisting of PDPP5T blended with the thiazole-bridged DPP polymers, were processed from chloroform solution, in which the processing additive, the donor to acceptor ratio and the thickness of the active layer were optimized. Different high boiling point additives such as DIO, 1-CN and o-DCB were examined, but 1-CN provided the best performance for all cells (Table S2, ESI†). The J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 6a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. All cells provide a moderate Voc of 0.53–0.61 V, where PDPP2TzNDI with the deepest LUMO gave a Voc of 0.53 V. In comparison, PDPP5T:PCBM cells have been reported to give a Voc of 0.57 V.21 Therefore, the Voc in these polymer–polymer solar cells confirm the similar or even lower LUMO levels compared to that of PCBM. However, all these cells show a low short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.77–2.2 mA cm−2 and a poor fill factor (FF) <0.4. The low Jsc is reflected in a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 6b). The three cells display EQEs below 0.1 in their absorption region. As a result, the PCE based on these cells ranged from 0.19 to 0.42%.

The low PCE in these cells needs to be discussed. Several parameters can influence the device performance, including photon absorption, exciton diffusion, charge separation, and charge transport into electrodes. Since in these donor–acceptor polymer–polymer systems, the HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO energy differences are higher than 0.3 eV, efficient charge generation via exciton dissociation is expected. Therefore, we presume that exciton diffusion or charge transport and recombination limit the efficiency. While studying the morphology of the blend films by AFM (Fig. 7), large domains were found in all three systems, indicating that photo-generated excitons are prone to intrinsic recombination before they can diffuse to the interface between the donor and acceptor, where charges can be formed. Especially, for PDPP5T:PDPP2TzFBDT with perfluoroalkyl side chains, fibril-like structures were found that can be attributed to the demixed thin films between PDPP5T and PDPP2TzFBDT. It has been also reported that conjugated polymers bearing perfluoroalkyl chains had the tendency to self-aggregate into fibril structures via the fluorophobic effect.38 Therefore, further improvement of PCE based on these polymer acceptors requires selecting suitable donor polymers and device optimization to achieve better phase separation.

Conclusions
In this work, three thiazole-bridged DPP polymers with deep LUMO levels were designed and synthesized via Stille polymerization for application in FETs and polymer solar cells as electron acceptors. By applying thiazole–thiazole coupled segments, perfluoroalkyl side chains or strong electron-deficient moieties in the main chain as the design strategy, the LUMO levels of DPP polymers could be adjusted below −4.0 eV. The polymers also show near-infrared absorption and are semi-crystalline. The polymers were applied in bottom-contact FETs where they showed an electron mobility of around 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. The polymers were tested as electron acceptors for polymer–polymer solar cells in combination with another DPP polymer as a donor to give a PCE of 0.4%. The low PCE was found to mainly originate from the large phase separation between the donor and acceptor, leading to a reduced Jsc. From this point, much effort is still needed to further improve the PCE based on these DPP polymers acceptors, such as the selection of donor materials and optimization of the solution process technique.
