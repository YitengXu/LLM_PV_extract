    , Accepted 10th July 2017First published on 11th July 2017AbstractFabrication of efficient colorful flexible polymer tandem solar cells remains a challenge. In this work, we report the use of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the top transparent electrode in tandem solar cells that in the meantime acts as an optical coating for light engineering. Modification of the thickness of the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS allows tailoring the reflectance spectra and yields colorful polymer solar cells with easy processability. Compared to the strategies of adopting optical microcavities and photonic crystals, the use of PEDOT:PSS also offers the important advantage of excellent mechanical flexibility that enables the fabrication of flexible colorful solar cells. The fabricated colorful flexible polymer tandem solar cells with polymer electrodes display power conversion efficiency (PCE) values from 7.23% to 8.34% depending on the yielded color of the cells, which are among the highest values for reported colorful polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting great attention because of their unique features of excellent mechanical flexibility and low-temperature processing.1–4 The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs has been increased over 12%5,6 with the efforts of developing highly efficient active layer materials, designing novel device architectures and exploring the underlying physical mechanisms.4,7,8 Parallel to those efforts on efficiency improvement, versatile devices including semitransparent, flexible and colorful polymer solar cells have also been under widespread investigation towards flexible and light-weight powering applications.9–14 Colorful flexible polymer solar cells are highly desirable to meet the aesthetic demand of photovoltaic-integrated applications with green buildings (e.g., windows, walls),15 electric vehicles,16 and wearable electronics,17 because the decorative appearance is pleasing to consumers and therefore enhances their market competitiveness.
Polymer solar cells afford a unique advantage to realize colorful appearance via chemical synthesis to tune the band gaps of the photoactive layer materials. For instance, devices composed of a wide-bandgap (around 1.90 eV) thiophene copolymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) generally display a brown-red appearance.18 With a low-bandgap (around 1.60 eV) polymer poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), polymer solar cells appear grey-green in color.19 Though the absorption bandgap of organic materials can be apparently adjusted by molecular design, a minor change in the molecular structure could induce significant changes in energy levels, carrier mobilities, crystallinity, and therefore photovoltaic performance.
Light management engineering is an efficient approach to realize vivid colors but without changing the inherent physical properties of the active materials.20–25 Optical structures such as optical microcavities and photonic crystals could achieve transmission and/or reflection colors at particular resonance wavelengths. For example, Betancur et al. reported colored semitransparent polymer solar cells by the use of MoO3/LiF photonic crystals on the top electrode.12 Red, blue and green colors have been achieved by altering the thickness of the high (MoO3) and low (LiF) refractive-index materials. The use of other photonic crystals (e.g., WO3/LiF, TiO2/SiO2) and optimization of the period (the air number) of the photonic crystals yield colorful polymer solar cells with PCEs up to 7% after combining with high-efficient photoactive layers.26–28 Besides photonic crystals, embedding an Ag/NPB/Ag microcavity as the composite device electrode also successfully enables colored semitransparent polymer solar cells.29 The devices display a broad color change from bluish to reddish color with PCEs around 5%. Nevertheless, the PCEs of colorful polymer solar cells still need to be enhanced. On the other hand, the aforementioned optical structures are often fabricated by high vacuum deposition with a multiple layer-by-layer structure that is complicated and significantly increases the fabrication cost. The complicated multiple-layer optical structure also limits the mechanical flexibility of the polymer solar cells. Therefore, exploring novel low-cost, easily processable, flexible optical structures to fabricate highly efficient colorful polymer solar cells is desirable. Recently, we have found that transparent conducting polymers could be used for optical engineering of perovskite solar cells.30
In this work, we report the utilization of the transparent conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), as the top transparent electrode to fabricate colorful flexible polymer tandem solar cells. In the meantime, the transparent polymer electrode acts as an optical antireflection coating for light management. Changing the thickness of PEDOT:PSS enables effective tuning of the spectral position of reflectance and therefore yields tunable aesthetic colors for the polymer tandem cells. The fabricated devices show a broad color gamut across the visible spectrum observed from the PEDOT:PSS side. The PEDOT:PSS polymer electrode is solution-processed and highly flexible. With this, we demonstrated colorful flexible tandem polymer solar cells with PCE values from 7.23% to 8.34%, which are among the highest values for reported colorful polymer solar cells.
Results and discussion
Before applying the transparent polymer electrode into flexible tandem solar cells, we first tested its function to realize colors in single-junction polymer solar cells. Fig. 1a shows the device structure, glass/ITO/polyethylenimine (PEI)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA)/PEDOT:PSS. The thin layer (about 5 nm) of PEI is used as a surface modifier to decrease the work function of the ITO electrode to enhance electron extraction.31 The classical blend of polymer P3HT:ICBA is used as the photoactive layer. PEDOT:PSS with a conductivity of about 600 S cm−1 is used as the top electrode via the transfer-printing technique.32,33 Different thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS films were fabricated as the top electrodes. Details of device fabrication are given in the Experimental section.

(c) Reflective colors of the devices plotted in the CIE 1931 chromaticity space. (d) Color change of OPV devices with 48 nm (sample 1), 75 nm (sample 2), and 95 nm (sample 3) PEDOT:PSS electrodes at different view angles of 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively. 
To verify the color tuning, simulated and experimentally measured reflectance spectra of the samples are presented in Fig. 1b. With PEDOT:PSS with thicknesses of 48 nm, 95 nm, 105 nm and 160 nm, the measured reflection peaks of the devices can be tuned at 604 nm, 505 nm, 525 nm, and 560 nm, respectively. The simulated reflectance spectra plotted as a function of the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS electrode are in good agreement with the experimental results. The tuning of the reflectance spectra of polymer solar cells indicates light redistribution arising from the coherent superposition of the reflected and transmitted electromagnetic fields among the PEDOT:PSS polymer electrode and the photoactive layer, which is consistent with the results in our previous work.30 In order to precisely evaluate the color appearance of polymer solar cells with PEDOT:PSS of varied thickness, the color coordinate positions based on the corresponding measured reflectance spectra are also plotted in the CIE 1931 chromaticity space. As shown in Fig. 1c, the CIE coordinates display a wide distribution in red, blue, and green hues, indicating a wide color gamut. These results clearly demonstrate the viable color tuning of polymer solar cells using transparent PEDOT:PSS as a facile optical engineering layer. Reflective colors are possibly angle-dependent.34 Here, we investigated the angle-dependence of the as-obtained reflective colors. Pictures in Fig. 1d and the video in the ESI† show that colors of the sample almost do not change when the view angle is less than 30°. But, when the view angle further increases to 60°, the color of the samples is significantly changed. Quantitative measurement of the reflection spectra at different view angles will be performed in the future to gain further in-depth insight into the color changes.

Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells with different color appearances under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. When illuminated from the PEDOT:PSS side (the device colors are observed from this side), the colored devices with PEDOT:PSS of 48 nm, 95 nm, and 160 nm display a similar open-circuit voltage (VOC) of about 0.88 V and fill factor (FF) of about 0.65. The high VOC and FF indicate the high-quality contact between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the photoactive layer (P3HT:ICBA), and the polymer electrode without a metal electrode is sufficiently conductive to collect charge carriers. The short-circuit current density (JSC) is sensitive to the polymer electrode thickness. It decreases from 7.78 mA cm−2, 7.33 mA cm−2 to 6.54 mA cm−2, respectively, when the PEDOT:PSS thickness increases from 48, 95, to 160 nm, respectively. The reduced JSC is mainly associated with the decrease in the transmittance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode as its thickness increases (Fig. S1, ESI†). Though the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS films is different (347 Ω sq−1, 165 Ω sq−1, and 107 Ω sq−1 for 48, 95, 160 nm respectively), the three types of devices display a comparable fill factor. The high FF (0.65 ± 0.02) of the solar cells with 48 nm PEDOT:PSS indicates that the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS films is not an obstacle for the performance when the device area is small (about 5 mm2) since the FF is very sensitive to series resistance. The influence of the sheet resistance will become more pronounced when the device area becomes larger. Metal grids will be required to reduce the collecting resistance for high efficiency.35

To reveal the difference in JSC, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the colored devices. As shown in Fig. 2c, the device with 160 nm PEDOT:PSS exhibits lower EQE values across the entire photoresponse range compared with those of devices with PEDOT:PSS of 95 nm and 48 nm. The decreased EQE is due to the lower transmission of the thick PEDOT:PSS electrode. On the other hand, the reflectance of the devices also affects the EQE spectra. The device with 95 nm PEDOT:PSS displays lower EQE (Fig. 2c) values at 450–550 nm that correspond to high reflectance (Fig. 1c). Therefore, JSC is an overall result of the varied reflectance and transmittance of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes.
When illuminated from the ITO electrode side, all the colored devices with different thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS electrodes show comparable EQE values in the entire response range (Fig. 2d), thus yielding a similar JSC of about 7.40 mA cm−2 and PCE of about 4.2%. The similar EQE and PCE values of the devices when illumined from the ITO side are because of the similar transmittance and reflectance of the glass/ITO electrodes. This also confirms that the JSC difference when illuminated from the top PEDOT:PSS side is due to the optical difference (transmittance and reflectance) rather than the electrical difference of the devices with different thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS electrodes.
Therefore, the utilization of the transparent PEDOT:PSS electrode could yield colorful solar cells by simply changing the film thickness. To enhance the efficiency of the colorful solar cells, we further applied the strategy to tandem solar cells.6,36–43 Tandem solar cells that contain different bandgap junctions can maximize the absorption and minimize the thermalization of the photon energy. The stacked junctions of efficient tandem solar cells typically absorb most of the visible light. It is hard to achieve transmissive multiple colors. Instead, it is possible to realize reflective colors with the PEDOT:PSS electrode strategy. Fig. 3a shows the device structure of the fabricated colorful flexible tandem solar cells: PES/Ag/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/charge recombination layer (CRL)/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS. PES is polyethersulfone that is used as the flexible substrate. P3HT:ICBA is used as the wide bandgap junction and PTB7-Th (poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))):PC71BM is the low bandgap junction. The CRL consists of modified PEDOT:PSS/PEIE.44 The CRL has conductivity on the order of 10−2 S cm−1 that minimizes the lateral current along the CRL and maximizes the VOC. The flexible tandem cells with 48 nm, 95 nm, and 160 nm PEDOT:PSS electrodes display different colors (Fig. 3b). The results confirm the applicability of the approach to fabricate colorful polymer tandem solar cells. The colored flexible tandem devices display a similar VOC of about 1.6 V and a similar FF of 0.6. The VOC of the colored flexible tandem cell is about 1.60 V, which is close to the sum of VOC values of P3HT:ICBA-based (0.86 V) and PTB7-Th:PCBM-based (0.77 V) subcells.33,44 The JSC also varies because of the different transmittance and reflectance of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes, which is consistent with those of the single-junction colored P3HT:ICBA devices. The flexible tandem solar cells display PCEs of 7.23%, 8.14%, and 8.34% for cells with PEDOT:PSS thicknesses of 160 nm, 95 nm and 48 nm, respectively (Fig. 3b). The PCEs demonstrated here are among the highest values for reported colorful polymer solar cells (Table S1, ESI†). In order to evaluate the mechanical flexibility of the colorful flexible devices, a repeated bending test was performed on the device with a radius of 5 mm. Photovoltaic performance of the colorful device with 95 nm PEDOT:PSS after different bending cycles is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The VOC, JSC and FF were only slightly reduced after 5000 consecutive bending cycles. The device retained 91% of the initial PCE value. This demonstrates that the colorful flexible solar cells have excellent mechanical properties because all the components are plastic except for the bottom silver electrode.

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated colorful flexible polymer tandem solar cells via the use of a transparent conducting polymer as the top electrode that in the meantime acts as an optical engineering layer. The displayed colors of the flexible polymer solar cells were achieved by tuning the film thickness of the transparent polymer electrode via solution processing. This strategy of realizing the colors of the cells is facile and cost-effective. The polymer as the optical engineering layer also enables the fabrication of flexible devices. The fabricated colorful flexible solar cells demonstrate power conversion efficiencies of 7.23–8.34% varying as the color changes. The values are among the highest values for colorful polymer solar cells. The realized colors here are reflective ones which do not strongly rely on the bandgaps of active layers. This strategy can also be applied to other polymer active layers and other types of solar cells. The efficiency of the colorful flexible solar cells can be further enhanced if high-performance active layers are selected. The demonstrated colorful cells are cost-effective, easily processable, flexible, and of light-weight, which are promising for photovoltaic integration and other aesthetic applications.
Experimental section
For single-junction solar cells, PEI (Aldrich) in isopropanol (0.1 wt%) was spin-coated onto pre-cleaned ITO glass at 5000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in air. The P3HT:ICBA (Lumitech) blend film was prepared by dissolving a mixture in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at a total concentration of 40 mg ml−1 (1:1, wt%), then spin-coating at 700 rpm for 1 min and annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glove box.
For tandem solar cells, a layer of silver film with a thickness of 80 nm was thermally deposited through a shadow mask on flexible PES substrates. The subsequent organic layers (PEI/P3HT:ICBA) were prepared in the same way as described for the single-junction solar cells. Then, the m-PEDOT:PSS/PEIE layer was prepared by spin coating as the charge recombination layer. The m-PEDOT:PSS layer was prepared by mixing PEDOT:PSS formulation of AI 4083 and PH1000 (Heraeus) at a mixing ratio of 3:1, as we reported earlier, and spin-coating on a plasma (PDC-002, Harrick)-treated P3HT:ICBA layer and annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The thin layer (5 nm) of PEIE in isopropanol (0.1 wt%) was spin-coated onto the m-PEDOT:PSS layer at 5000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The layer of PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt%, Solarmer) was then deposited by spin coating from a chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3, by volume) solution (a total concentration of 25 mg ml−1). The thickness of the P3HT:ICBA layer is about 200 nm and the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer is about 110 nm, which is based on the optimization of our previous work on tandem cells.33,44
For the transfer printing of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes, PEDOT:PSS PH1000 with 5 wt% ethylene glycol (Aldrich) and 0.5 wt% surfactant (TOYNOL® Superwet-320) was first spin coated onto a plasma-treated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate at different speeds from 600 to 3000 rpm and dried in air for 6 min at room temperature and relative humidity of 40%. Then, the PEDOT:PSS on PDMS was deposited onto the plasma-treated active layer surface. The PDMS substrate was then peeled off and separated from the PEDOT:PSS films. We have previously reported that the mild plasma treatment on the active layer surface will not affect the solar cell performance.45 The contact between the transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS and the plasma-treated active layer is well adhered with the assistance of hydrogen bonding. The PEDOT:PSS films were left on the active layer as the top electrodes. The device area was about 5 mm2.
Device characterization

J–V characteristics were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter controlled by the LabVIEW program. The reflectance of the samples was measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The thickness of the film was characterized using a DEKTAK XT profilometer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded on a standard system using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.
