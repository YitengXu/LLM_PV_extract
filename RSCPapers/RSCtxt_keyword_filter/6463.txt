    , Accepted 19th October 2012First published on 19th October 2012AbstractA novel uniform multi-level matrix of vertically erected graphene walls is directly grown on a dielectric substrate by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 900 °C without the presence of any catalyst and post-transfer treatment. Such a two-level structure is composed of continuous vertically erected graphene sheets (the second level) on a nanocrystalline graphene film (the first level). A nanocrystalline film is formed in the first stage (<15 min), and the graphene walls initialize on the boundary C sp3 atoms as nucleation centers to grow the erected graphene walls as the second-level component. The microstructure of the graphene walls can be modified by plasma power, growth time and seed layer coating. The unique three-dimensional graphene structure possessed high hydrophobicity (contact angle: 141°), outstanding electron conductivity (sheet resistance: 198 Ω sq−1), and tunable transparency (91.9–38.0% at 550 nm). The three-dimensional structure enables the graphene to act as an excellent electron transport network with high surface area in many aspects. The highly conductive graphene walls were used as the counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) with a photovoltaic efficiency of 6.01%, comparable to FTO-based DSSCs (6.10%). This in situ one-step growth indicates the great potential to fabricate excellent electrodes for photovoltaic and electronic applications.
1. Introduction
With a unique combination of high specific surface area, chemical stability, mechanical strength, flexibility, and high electrical and thermal conductivity, graphene is considered as a promising new candidate of conducting electrode in photovoltaics and microelectronics.1–4 Since conducting electrodes require large-size and few-layered graphene, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a superior method to growth these films. However, traditional thermal CVD requires catalyst films such as Cu or Ni, and post-transfer or additional catalyst removal techniques.5,6 The complicated process usually results in wrinkles, holes, and metal etching residues on the films, which are setbacks for further applications.
A superior solution is to achieve direct growth of graphene on dielectric substrates. Recently, Bi et al. attained few layer graphene films directly grown on SiO2 substrates obtained by ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition.7 However, methane needs high temperature (>1200 °C) to be dissociated to activated C atoms without a metal catalyst. Most transparent substrates cannot withstand this high temperature process. Plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) has advantages to achieve deposition at low temperature and low pressure by use of reactive species generated in the plasma, and has already been used for the low-temperature growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).8,9 Not only does plasma act as an excellent stimulus for the dissociation of methane as a gas predecessor, but also the high electric field aligned perpendicular to the surface conduces the unique structure of the graphene film. So it is a promising way to combine the plasma with conventional thermal CVD conditions to directly form excellent graphene films without any metal catalyst.
In the present work, we report a novel PECVD method to grow uniform vertically erected graphene walls at 900 °C directly on SiO2 substrates without using any catalyst, possessing a unique two-level structure composed of continuous vertically erected graphene sheets (the second level) on a nanocrystalline graphene film (the first level). The qualities and properties of the graphene walls are strongly dependent on plasma power and growth time. Meanwhile, the 3D microstructure of the graphene walls can be modified by plasma power, growth temperature, growth time and seed layer coating on the substrates. The graphene walls with a well-connected 3D structure possess high hydrophobicity (contact angle: 141°), outstanding electronic conductivity (sheet resistance: 198 Ω sq−1) and tunable transparency (91.9–38.0% at 550 nm). The excellent PV application of the graphene walls is demonstrated by a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.01% as the counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Hence, PECVD as a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach to fabricate excellent multifunctional electrodes has very promising potential for future applications.
2. Experimental
The lab-built PECVD apparatus consists of vacuum CVD chambers, a plasma generator and a high temperature furnace. 2 cm × 2 cm SiO2 was washed in acetone for 10 min, then rinsed with deionized water and dried for use. They were introduced into the CVD chamber and fixed on an Al2O3 platform. The samples were heated up to 750 °C by the furnace and cleaned with H2 plasma for 30 minutes. The plasma was generated by a copper loop applying a radio frequency (RF) power of 13.56 MHz. During cleaning, the hydrogen flow rate (FH2), and RF power (IRF) were set at 60 standard cubic centimeter per minutes (sccm) and 200 W, respectively. Subsequently, the substrate was heated up to 900 °C and the growth was started. A gas mixture of methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) was used to grow graphene by the PECVD method. The IRF and growth times were changed variably, while the FCH4 and FH2 were kept at 5 and 20 sccm throughout the whole experiment. After growth, the samples were removed from the furnace and cooled to room temperature within 20 min under high vacuum conditions.
The graphene films on SiO2 substrates were directly measured by Raman spectroscopy with a laser excitation energy of 532 nm in a Renishaw inVia Reflex Laser Raman with a cooled CCD detector. TEM and SEAD were conducted using a JEOL 2100F microscope, operating at 200 kV. XPS experiments were carried out on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). The morphology of graphene on SiO2 substrates was investigated by a Hitachi S-4800 FESEM operated at 0.8 kV. The surface roughness was measured on an atomic force microscope (AFM, SeikoIISPI3800V & spa 300HV). The optical transmittance characteristics were determined via a UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum in a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100). The sheet resistances of the graphene films were measured by the Van der Pauw method with an Accent HL5500. Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics (J–V) were measured using a Keithley Model 2440 source meter under AM 1.5 illumination. A 1000 W Oriel solar simulator was used as a light source and the power of the light was calibrated to one sunlight intensity by using a NREL-calibrated Si cell (Oriel 91150).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 PECVD preparation of graphene walls
Direct growth of graphene films on transparent insulating substrates (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.) is important for practical applications to avoid structure damage and property decaying during CVD graphene transfer from metal substrates. The graphene films were reported to be grown on SiO2 substrates by using the ambient pressure CVD (APCVD) method at >1200 °C, but the growth temperature is too high to use low-cost glass substrates. Hence, we developed a lab-built inductively coupled plasma–PECVD method to directly grow graphene on SiO2 substrates without using any metal catalyst (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, the 60 min PECVD growth results in a continuous flower-like three-dimensional network structure of vertically erected graphene walls (Fig. 1b). The average size of the vertically erected sheets is around 100–150 nm. The cross section image suggests that these vertically erected sheets are around 130 nm high, which are almost one piece from top to bottom (Fig. 1c). Based on the TEM observations (Fig. 1d and e), the edges of the graphene film are curved instead of straight (graphene films grown on Ni or Cu substrates). The layer number is very difficult to determine due to the overlap of the curved sheets, and the calculated interlayer spacing is about 0.335 nm. This nano-textured surface could make the graphene films possess not only well-connected electron transport paths, but also high specific surface area, which is suitable for catalyst supports (e.g. counter electrodes in DSSCs).10

The morphology and microstructure of the graphene walls systematically investigated with different growth times reveal a two-level growth process in PECVD. We fabricated the samples with IRF of 300 W at 900 °C in 15–60 min, for which SEM images and TEM images were measured. In the early stage of growth (<15 min) with an RF power of 300 W, a ∼30 nm thick graphene film was uniformly deposited on the SiO2 surface (Fig. 2a and e). The flat film seems to consist of nanocrystalline graphene, which is quite different from the graphene film deposited on Cu or Ni surface by conventional CVD. Moreover, the ambiguous diffraction ring pattern further confirms that the film is typically a polycrystalline structure, and the crystallinity degree of the graphene film is relatively low. As the growth proceeded, nucleation centers initialize on the boundary C sp3 atoms so as to grow the erected graphene walls as the second-level component (Fig. 2b and f). When the growth time reached 45 min, vertical graphene sheets randomly cover the whole substrate surface and keep growing. Electron diffraction (insets of Fig. 2f and g) reveals that the crystalline structure becomes more regular. With the increase in growth time to 60 min, much larger graphene sheets (100–200 nm in size) formed with a network structure, and their crystallinity can be further improved (Fig. 2d and h). The same results are verified by the atomic force microscope (AFM) images in Fig. S1.† The corresponding average root mean squared (RMS) roughness in a 10 μm × 10 μm area steadily increases from 1.75 to 5.11 nm with the increase of growth time from 15 to 60 min. The increasing roughness indicates more large-size graphene sheets vertically grow with longer growth times.

Raman spectra of the as-prepared graphene walls on SiO2 substrates with IRF of 300 W at 900 °C in 15–60 min were shown in Fig. 3a. All the samples have three peak structure in the Raman spectrum, which are indexed at 1342 cm−1, 1585 cm−1 and 2691 cm−1, corresponding to the D band, G band, and 2D band.11 The G band reflects the E2g phonon at the center of the Brillouin zone. The D band and the 2D band are generated by double-resonant Raman scattering. The G-peak of the sample grown in 15 min appears at around 1592 cm−1, which suggests that the structures may contain some nanocrystalline graphitic features (Fig. 3a).12 This peak shifts down with increasing growth time and reach 1580 cm−1 after 45 min, which is a common feature of graphitic carbon materials.9 This indicates that the deposition of graphene fragments on the substrate is inclined to form nanocrystalline graphene in the early growth stage. The D bands of all the samples are due to not only the high fraction of open edges of small-sized graphene sheets, but also to defects inside the graphene domains, which are in accordance with the SEM and AFM observations. Furthermore, all the samples have shoulder peaks at 1622 cm−1, which are assigned as G′-peaks. The G′-peak is associated with symmetry breaking due to a finite size of sp2-hybridized crystallites and originates through a double resonance process. It suggests that the graphene walls show a relatively low order of graphitization with a large amount of inter-crystalline defects.13 These self-defects can introduce significant charge carriers into the 3D conducting network, which might be the origin of the excellent electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the 2D band can be fitted with six Lorentzian peaks (Fig. S3†), rather than a single Lorentzian peak.11 This feature suggests that the graphene walls with a growth time of 60 min have a typical triple-layer structure. Moreover, Raman spectra from over 100 points on the entire SiO2 surface were carried out, suggesting the good uniformity of the graphene walls.

The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG), the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 2D band, and the intensity ratio of the 2D band to the G band (I2D/IG) are important factors, from which the grain size and the number of layers can be estimated.11 With a growth time of 60 min, the FWHM of the 2D peak is ∼59 cm−1, and the intensity ratio I2D/IG is ∼0.7; this signals that it is few layered graphene. The intensity ratio ID/IG is considered to provide information on the grain size of graphene, according to the equation ID/IG = C(λ)/Lα, where Lα is the grain size, λ is the wavelength of incident light and C(λ) is a constant calculated as C(λ) = 2.4 × 10−10 × λ4.14 The intensity ratios of the D band to the G band and the 2D band to the G band of the graphene walls show high linear dependences on the growth times (Fig. 3b). With the increase of the growth time from 15 min to 60 min, the I2D/IG increases from 0.40 to 0.68; the ID/IG decreases from 2.01 to 1.52. This reveals that the early growth stage results in the small-sized graphene covering the whole SiO2 surface to a continuous and uniform film. Then, further growth keeps forming vertically erected graphene walls with larger grain sizes and fewer layers on top of the former layer.
In order to verify the C sp3-hybridized boundary atoms as nucleation centers for the erected graphene walls on the second-level component, the atomic ratio of C sp2 and C sp3 is obtained by taking the ratio of the C 1s peak areas in XPS spectra. The original graphene wall signal shows the main C sp2 peaks with an obvious shoulder on the high binding energy side. Only ∼2 mol% oxygen was estimated to be present on the basis of the XPS analysis, which indicates that the C–O peak should not be the origin of this peak shoulder. An initial XPS survey scan reveals that the asymmetric C 1s peak can be fitted with two different peaks with a binding energy at 284.6 eV and 285.4 eV, assigned to C sp2 and C sp3 bonds, respectively (Fig. 3c and d).15 The graphene wall samples suggest a higher ratio of C sp3/C sp2 with increasing growth time, indicating that the vertical growth of graphene sheets on the second-level component highly depends on C sp3-hybridized atoms as nucleation centers.
3.2 Growth mechanism of PECVD
To reveal the growth mechanism of graphene wall growth by PECVD, different graphene wall samples were fabricated with different plasma power (50–200 W) and at different growth temperatures (600–800 °C). The plasma power shows a critical effect for vertical growth of the graphene walls, which is verified by the SEM images of the samples (Fig. 4a–c). With the decrease of plasma power, the vertically erected graphene sheets, especially the sample with 100 W, become sparser. However, the sizes of the graphene sheets remain the same. The variation of the microstructure indicates that the high electric field aligned perpendicular to the surface provided by plasma is key to conducing C sp3-hybridized atoms as nucleation centers for vertical growth of the graphene walls. On the other hand, the growth temperature mainly affects the size of the graphene walls (Fig. 4a–c). At low temperature, the amount of vertically erected graphene sheets remains the same, but the size has no further increase due to the lack of driving force. These results also suggest that the growth temperature of the graphene walls can be as low as 600 °C, which is suitable for most economical substrates.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of graphene walls directly grown on SiO2 substrates (a–c) with plasma power of 50 W, 100 W, and 200 W at 900 °C, and (e–g) with plasma power of 300 W at 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C. 
The two-level structure of the graphene walls indicates the possibility to modify the microstructure by adding a seed layer on the substrates. In order to verify this, dilute graphene oxide solution with two different sheet sizes (20–50 nm and 40–80 nm) was dip-coated on the SiO2 substrates. Then, these preprocessed substrates were annealed under the flow of Ar at 600 °C before PECVD growth with a plasma power of 300 W at 900 °C for 45 min. Fig. 5 shows Raman spectra and SEM images of graphene walls grown on different preprocessed substrates. SEM images intuitively verify the increase of the average grain sizes of graphene sheets, much larger than graphene wall samples with no coating. The Raman spectra show similar results. The intensity ratio ID/IG of the large GO sheet coating and small GO sheet coating are 0.76 and 0.90, much larger than graphene wall samples with no coating (ID/IG = 1.83). After adding a larger nucleation seed in the first-layer, the boundary C sp3 atoms as nucleation centers become sparser, which provide more space to grow much larger erected graphene walls in the second-level.

3.3 Electrical and optical properties
The vertically erected graphene walls directly grown on SiO2 substrates by PECVD possess outstanding optical and electrical properties. Photographs of as-prepared samples grown in 15, 30, 45, and 60 min are shown in Fig. 6a, which intuitively verify the excellent transparency. Their sheet resistances and transparencies in the wavelength range of 250–2500 nm both decease with the increase of growth time (Fig. 6b). The details are listed in Table 1. All the graphene samples, especially grown in 15 and 30 min, possess excellent transparencies in the whole visible and near-infrared light range, which covers the high-intensity spectrum for most solar cells. For instance, the transparency at 550 nm reaches 91.9% for 15 min growth, to 87.6% for 30 min growth, and their values are superior to other transparent conductive films (TCFs), especially in the near-infrared light range. The corresponding average sheet resistances are 2268 Ω sq−1 and 996 Ω sq−1 for 15 and 30 min. Compared to graphene films made from graphene oxide16 (8 kΩ sq−1, ∼80% transparency) and directly grown on SiO2 substrates by LPCVD methods (4–20 kΩ sq−1, 80–90% transparency),17 our graphene walls have a higher conductivity for a similar transparency. The performances of our graphene walls are comparable with the 1-layer and 7-layer graphenes grown by thermal CVD as references. It is noticed that the sheet resistance of the as-prepared film grown for 120 min can be a much lower value at 198 Ω sq−1, with poor transparency (∼38%). The excellent optical and electrical properties suggest that our PECVD method has potential applications in future transparent conductive electronics for PV devices.

3.4 Wettability of liquid droplets
The 3D microstructure of the erected graphene walls grown on SiO2 can be used to dramatically alter the wettability of the substrate. The graphene consists of a two-dimensional honeycomb carbon lattice. The stable electronic structure results in a rather low surface energy.18,19 The attraction from the non-polar lattice to water molecules is weaker than the binding energy among water molecules. Therefore, the roughness effect in conjunction with the surface chemistry of the graphene walls is highly hydrophobic. Static contact angles of water droplets were measured by placing a droplet of deionized water (2 μL) on the surface of the samples, as shown in Fig. 7. Overall, the graphene walls dramatically change the hydrophilicity of the SiO2 substrates into high hydrophobicity. The estimated contact angle of water on the solid surface and the calculated surface energy were listed in Table 1. As a reference, SiO2 surface was observed to be completely wetting, i.e., the water droplet brought into contact with the solid spontaneously formed a film with a water contact angle of ∼23° (Fig. 7) and a surface energy of 66.9 J m−2. The contact angle of the graphene walls with a growth time of 15 min reaches 91° and the surface energy decreases (18.0 J m−2). The contact angle (θC) increases and surface energy decreases with increasing growth time, which reaches 129° and 2.35 J m−2 with a growth time of 60 min, indicating that the roughness of the graphene walls is key to modifying the wettability of the surface. The contact angle of the graphene walls further increases (141°) with GO as the preprocess coating (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, the contact angles of oil and ethanol droplets on the graphene walls are 38° and 0° (Fig. S2†). This has shown promising potential for practical applications as excellent, cheap, eco-friendly, self-cleaning glass.

3.5 Catalytic electrode application
To demonstrate the applications as excellent electrodes and catalyst supports, graphene walls on SiO2 substrates were assembled as counter electrodes in DSSC prototype devices, as shown in Fig. 8a. The DSSC based on the graphene wall film with a sheet resistance of 198 Ω sq−1, shows a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 6.7 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a fill factor (FF) of 44.1%, and an overall PCE of 2.19% (Fig. 8b). This demonstrates that the graphene film can be used as the counter electrode in DSSCs. However, the relatively poor PCE may be due to the lack of I−/I3− catalytic capacity for pure graphene. To further optimize the cell efficiency, the graphene film with a small amount of Pt by sputtering (30 S) is used as the counter electrode, and its efficiencies reach up to 6.01% (Voc = 0.77 V, Jsc = 12.1 mA cm−2, FF = 64.4%). This property is quite close to the reference sample with Pt/FTO as counter electrode (6.10%), which is widely used as a counter electrode in DSSCs.20,21 These excellent results suggest our graphene walls are very promising counter electrodes for DSSCs, especially for the substitution of expensive FTO.

4. Conclusions
We demonstrated a novel PECVD method to grow uniform graphene walls at 900 °C directly on SiO2 and other dielectric substrates without using any catalyst. The two-level 3D structure of the graphene walls can be modified by plasma power, growth temperature, growth time and seed layer coating. The graphene walls with a well-connected 3D structure possess high hydrophobicity (contact angle: 141°), outstanding electronic conductivity (sheet resistance: 198 Ω sq−1) and tunable transparency (91.9–38.0% at 550 nm). Excellent PV application of graphene walls is demonstrated by a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.01% as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Hence, PECVD as a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach to fabricate excellent multifunctional electrodes has very promising potential in future applications.
