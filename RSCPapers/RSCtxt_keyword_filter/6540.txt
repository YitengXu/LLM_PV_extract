    , Accepted 28th November 2018First published on 4th December 2018AbstractIn this work, a simple interface engineering process for SnO2 electron selective layer (ESL) surface passivation employing a SnCl2 solution is introduced, which has successfully reduced the energy loss for a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) output and consequently improved the performance of all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It was found that surface passivation can effectively suppress the recombination process at the interface between the perovskite and SnO2 due to higher recombination resistance. The shorter PL decay time is attributed to the excellent electron extraction from the perovskite film. After optimizing surface passivation, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced from 4.73% to 7.00% and a high Voc of 1.31 V was achieved, which is one of the highest Voc values reported for inorganic Cs-based PSCs. More importantly, the passivated SnO2 based device retains 95.5% of its initial performance at 90 °C in air without encapsulation. This work provides a simple and efficient interface engineering method to improve the Voc and efficiency of all-inorganic PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting tremendous attention in the past several years, leading to an achievable high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3%.1,2 The perovskite light absorber, in most highly efficient PSCs, is composed of organic cations (e.g., methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA)) hybridized with lead halide frameworks, which promises perfect band gap and strong light absorption ability.3–5 However, the thermal stability of these hybrid PSCs is an important issue to be addressed owing to the irreversible decomposition of the perovskite phase to lead iodide and organic molecules when exposed to heat stress at a low temperature (80 °C).6 Mixing inorganic Caesium (Cs) with the MA and FA can improve the composition and structural tolerability at a higher temperature (100 °C).7 However, the fundamental solution for thermal endurance is to entirely replace the organic cations with a Cs cation. Thus inorganic PSCs with the formula CsPbX3 (X = I, Br) are attracting great attention due to their outstanding thermal stability (stable over 400 °C) and the high-speed progression in their performance.8–11
Among the family of CsPbX3, CsPbBr3 is the most stable, but its large band gap (2.30 eV) leads to poor light absorbing ability.12 CsPbI3 possesses the narrowest band gap leading to good light absorbing properties but easily transforms to the non-photoactive orthorhombic phase (yellow phase) at room temperature in air.10,13,14 Therefore, for balancing the band gap and the phase stability of CsPbX3 perovskite materials, mixing I and Br is one of the best choices.11 For example, CsPbIBr2 is a good light absorber with an appropriate band gap of 2.0 eV and better phase stability at room temperature. However, the performance of CsPbIBr2 based PSCs is still low. One crucial factor is the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) owing to a large energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as the energy loss between the bandgap of the perovskite materials and the device Voc (Eloss = Eg − eVoc).8 For example, Yabing Qi et al. fabricated all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 based PSCs with a carbon electrode and the Voc was only 0.96 V (PCE = 6.14%) with an Eloss larger than 1.0 eV, which is much larger than that of the organic–inorganic PSCs (less than 0.5 eV).15 Zhong Jin and co-workers also fabricated a similar device structure with a Voc of 1.08 V.16 A higher Voc for CsPbIBr2 based devices of 1.227 V was achieved by Yibing Cheng et al., in which they utilized the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting material (HTM) and a Au electrode, and achieved a PCE of 8.02%.17 Thus the Eloss must be reduced in order to further improve the performance of the inorganic PSCs. It has been proved that non-radiative recombination at the interface between the perovskite film and the electron selective layer (ESL) or HTM, is one of the major factors that induce Eloss of the device.8 For instance, Qifan Xue et al. constructed a SnO2/ZnO bilayered ESL for CsPbI2Br, which has successfully suppressed interfacial trap-assisted recombination and contributed to a high Voc of 1.23 V and PCE of 14.6%.8 Alex K.-Y. Jen and co-workers modified a SnO2 film using C60 and the resultant Voc and PCE of CsPbIBr2 are 1.18 V and 7.34%, respectively.18 Therefore, interface engineering is a very promising method to reduce the Eloss and to increase Voc for further enhancement of the performance of all-inorganic PSCs.
Here we propose a simple interface engineering process for SnO2 ESL surface passivation employing a SnCl2 solution. It shows that surface passivation leads to faster carrier transformation through the interface and larger charge recombination resistance for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs. By employing the passivated SnO2 ESL, a high Voc of 1.31 V was recorded for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs using carbon as the counter electrode. The PCE was enhanced from 4.73 to 7.00% after the passivation process. Our results indicate that surface passivation is a very promising method to reduce the Eloss for the all-inorganic PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication process of the all-inorganic PSCs where bare and passivated SnO2 were used as the ESL (the details are depicted in the Experimental section in the ESI†). Firstly, we spin-coated the SnO2 colloid (tin(IV) oxide) solution to form a SnO2 film. The ultra-thin passivated SnO2 layer was prepared by spin-coating 0.1 M SnCl2 precursor on the prepared SnO2 at 6000 rpm followed by an annealing process at 180 °C for 1 h. Fig. 2 shows the field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and the atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the SnO2 film before and after passivation. From Fig. 2a and c, we can confirm that the introduction of the ultra-thin passivated SnO2 layer induces a significant difference in the film morphology. Several prominent holes are observed in the SnO2 film (red-circled), implying an imperfect coverage property, which will lead to severe recombination during charge extraction from the perovskite film. However, with an ultra-thin passivated SnO2 layer, the holes are filled; this forms a hole-free ESL. We also compared them using AFM images as shown in Fig. 2b and d. The SnO2 film becomes much smoother after passivation by SnCl2. Specifically, the root-mean-square-roughness (Rq) is dramatically decreased from 7.05 nm to 4.21 nm, which implies the effect of passivation. The effect of passivation or non-passivation is also presented in Fig. S1,† as observed through their transmittance properties. Compared with the bare SnO2 film, the films passivated by SnCl2 with different concentrations display higher transmittance properties in the visible light region. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a smoother surface, which leads to lower reflectivity and thus higher transmittance.19 The SnO2 film passivated with 0.15 M SnCl2 has the highest transmittance because of its smoother surface and lower Rq of 2.99 nm (Fig. S2†). The smoother surface results from the passivation effect rather than annealing at the higher temperature of 180 °C, as shown in Fig. S3.†

In order to investigate the effect of SnO2 film passivation on the performance of the devices, we fabricated an inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite film on a bare and passivated SnO2 film, respectively. The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1 and it should be noted that the inorganic CsPbIBr2 film was annealed at a relatively low temperature of 160 °C, rather than the widely used temperature of around 300 °C in previous publications.
Fig. S4† shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbIBr2 films on different ESLs and the insets show the photographs of the prepared CsPbIBr2 films. From the XRD patterns, we found that both the films show similar strong peaks at 14.7°, 20.9°, and 29.9°, corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal planes of the CsPbIBr2 cubic perovskite structure, respectively.20–22 Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5,† both the CsPbIBr2 films display similar surface morphologies, but the film on passivated SnO2 seems a little denser with higher coverage owing to the smoother surface of the ESL, which is a beneficial criterion to form a high-quality perovskite layer.23 The effects of SnO2 passivation on cell performance are further investigated by fabricating PSCs with the architecture of ITO/ESL/CsPbIBr2/carbon, as depicted in Fig. 1, in which the ESL is the bare SnO2 or passivated SnO2 film.

Fig. 3a shows the cross-sectional SEM image with the passivated SnO2 ESL and the thickness of the perovskite layer is about 260 nm, which is similar to those of previous reports.15,16,18 Therefore, we confirmed that through the processes depicted in Fig. 1, the above architecture was successfully fabricated. Moreover, the band alignment diagram of the components (Fig. 3b), determined from Fig. S6,† illustrates that the light-generated electrons and holes can be effectively transferred from the perovskite absorber to the ESL and the HTM, respectively, implying perfectly matching energy levels for this device configuration.

Fig. 4a displays the J–V curves of the champion CsPbIBr2 PSCs with different ESLs and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown as the inset in Fig. 4a. It is clear that the passivated SnO2 based device outperforms the bare SnO2 based device. The Voc, short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the passivated SnO2 based device are 1.23 V, 8.50 mA cm−2 and 0.67, respectively, resulting in a high PCE of 7.00%, with a 0.16 V and 48.6% enhancement in Voc and PCE when compared with those of the bare SnO2 based device (1.07 V and 4.73%). All the measured Jsc values in our experiments match the photocurrent density calculated from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. S7†) well. The higher Jsc might be partly attributed to the denser light absorber layer because of its stronger light absorption ability. However, the bare SnO2 based PSC has a slightly higher EQE value than the passivated one in the range of 300–400 nm, which could be attributed to the better transmittance property of the bare SnO2 film in this range, as shown in the transmittance spectra of different SnO2 films (Fig. S1†). The output stability of the champion cells is measured in ambient air, during which the bias voltage is set at their respective maximum power points. As displayed in Fig. S8,† the stabilized PCE of the passivated SnO2 based device is estimated to be 6.45% after 130 s continuous measurement, which is higher than that of the bare SnO2 based device of 3.91%. At the same time, the passivated SnO2 based device shows a slight increase in PCE, while a slight decrease is observed for the bare SnO2 based device. This indicates the better output stability for the device with passivated SnO2 as the ESL. We summarized the performances of the CsPbIBr2 based PSCs with a carbon or Au electrode reported to date, as shown in Table S1.† We found that the champion PCE (7.00%) obtained for the passivated SnO2 based solar cell in this work is comparable to those of the literature.

In order to verify the reproducibility of the high-performance passivated SnO2 based PSCs, we fabricated 20 pieces of bare SnO2 and passivated SnO2 ESL-based solar cells, respectively, as listed in Table S2.† We found that the PCEs of most of the passivated SnO2 based devices are in the range of 5.27 to 7.00%, while all the bare SnO2 based cells show PCEs lower than 4.71%. However, all the Voc values of the passivated SnO2 based cells are above 1.20 V while the Voc values of the bare SnO2 based devices were distributed in the range from 0.85 to 1.07 V. The Voc distribution of the PSCs on bare and passivated SnO2 is shown in Fig. 4b. Thus our passivation method is highly reproducible in achieving a high Voc. More importantly, the highest Voc of 1.31 V was achieved after SnO2 surface passivation, which is higher than that of other reported CsPbIBr2 PSCs (Table S1†) and is one of the highest Voc values obtained for inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs. Therefore, we can conclude that the passivation of the SnO2 ESL with the ultra-thin SnO2 film is a promising approach to reduce Eloss for CsPbIBr2 PSCs.
To completely understand the passivation effect of the SnO2 film, various concentrations of SnCl2 solution were studied. This study shows that a very low concentration of SnCl2 is ineffective in passivating the SnO2 film as proved through its non-obvious enhancement of the performance (Fig. S9 and Table S3†). In contrast, a thicker passivated SnO2 layer (high concentration) increases the series resistance of the device (Fig. S10†). We also prepared a single SnO2 layer on ITO using 0.1 M SnCl2 precursor with a spin-coating speed of 2000 rpm. We found that its performance is compromised, as compared to that of the bare SnO2 ESL based device (Fig. S9 and Table S3†). Thus the reason for the reduced Eloss and enhanced performance of the passivated SnO2 based solar cells lies in the interface modification, rather than the difference between the SnO2 films prepared from the SnO2 colloid solution or SnCl2 precursor.8,24,25
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer properties in the PSCs with the SnO2 ESL with or without passivation. EIS was performed at an applied bias of Voc under dark conditions and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Generally, the high-frequency arc represents the transport process combining the transport resistance and the chemical capacitance, which are related to the charge transport from the cathode to the anode, while the arc at the low-frequency region represents the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance (Crec) at the interface of perovskite/SnO2 and perovskite/carbon.25,26 It is clear that the device with the passivated SnO2 ESL shows larger Rrec (60572 Ω) than the bare SnO2 ESL based device (21055 Ω), which indicates that the recombination process in the former device is highly suppressed. Similarly, the former has a slightly larger series resistance (Rs) than the latter owing to its thicker SnO2 film. We also performed EIS for other devices with different ESLs, as shown in Fig. S10.† We found that after passivation, the devices possess larger Rrec than the bare SnO2 based device and that 0.1 M SnCl2 passivation leads to the highest Rrec (summarized in the table inset in Fig. S10†), thus resulting in the best performance. However, the device using the SnO2 ESL prepared by spin-coating 0.1 M SnCl2 at 2000 rpm shows the smallest Rrec. In brief, this surface passivation decreases the recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the ESL, which significantly improves the Voc and PCE of the devices.

To better understand the effect of SnO2 passivation on the electron extraction and transport mechanism, steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements of the perovskite film on different substrates were conducted. Fig. 6a shows the PL spectra of the ITO/CsPbIBr2, ITO/SnO2/CsPbIBr2 and ITO/passivated SnO2/CsPbIBr2 samples. The ITO/CsPbIBr2 exhibits high PL intensity, which implies serious carrier recombination.8 The ITO/passivated SnO2/CsPbIBr2 sample shows lower PL intensity than the ITO/SnO2/CsPbIBr2 sample, indicating stronger electron extraction ability from the perovskite film and lower recombination possibility.27Fig. 6b shows the TRPL spectra of the samples and the decay time is calculated via the exponential fits of the spectra. The parameters are listed in the table inserted in Fig. 6b. As shown in the table, when CsPbIBr2 is deposited on the bare ITO substrate, the PL decay times are 5.24 and 17.40 ns for τ1 and τ2, respectively. However, the ITO/SnO2/CsPbIBr2 sample possesses reduced PL decay times of 3.24 and 12.09 ns for τ1 and τ2, respectively. When the passivated SnO2 ESL was used for perovskite film deposition, both τ1 and τ2 are further reduced to 2.77 and 8.88 ns, respectively. Moreover, the CsPbIBr2 film on the passivated SnO2 ESL has the smallest average decay time among the three samples. Thus the passivation of the SnO2 ESL can accelerate the electron injection rate from the perovskite film and suppress the charge recombination at the perovskite/ESL interface, resulting in higher Voc and better performance.

Fig. S11† displays the hysteresis properties of both the SnO2 and passivated SnO2 based CsPbIBr2 PSCs. We found that both kinds of devices have severe hysteresis when compared with the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs. The hysteresis indices for the SnO2 and passivated SnO2 based device are 43% and 42.3%, respectively. Yibing Cheng and co-workers have explained this phenomenon by pointing out that there is iodide-rich phase segregation near the grain boundaries, forming clusters in the CsPbIBr2 film, which has a great influence on the ion migration.17 Concentrated mobile ions generated by phase segregation pile up at the CsPbIBr2/ESL interface, resulting in the formation of larger injection barriers and hampering electron extraction. This phenomenon exacerbates the hysteresis in CsPbIBr2 PSCs. On the other hand, the relatively small grain size with a large number of grain boundaries and compositional defects accompanying the one-step solution fabrication method might be another reason for the severe hysteresis properties.9,28
It has been widely accepted that the degradation of perovskite occurs at the interface between the ESL and the perovskite materials.29,30 In order to investigate the effect of SnO2 surface passivation on device stability, we measured the thermal stability of the unencapsulated solar cells at 90 °C in air with a relative humidity of 60–70%. The time-dependent normalized Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the two types of devices are shown in Fig. 7. It shows that the passivated SnO2 based device has a better durability than the bare SnO2 based device. All the parameters of the two solar cells increase over the first one hour, which is recognized as the interfacial ripening process with better charge transferability and improved crystallinity of the perovskite materials.16,31 During the subsequent tens of hours, the FF of the passivated SnO2 based device remained at a higher level than the initial value, while the Jsc decreased obviously relative to the initial value. After 80 hours, the passivated device could still retain 95.5% of its initial performance, which is much higher than that of the bare SnO2 based device (58.3%). Moreover, we found that after long hours of light exposure, the appearance of the active area of the bare SnO2 based device changes when viewing from the back, as shown in Fig. 7a (inset), while this phenomenon was not observed for the passivated SnO2 based device. Thus there must be some undesired photochemical reactions occurring at the bare SnO2/perovskite interface, such as light and interface defect-induced halide migration in the CsPbIBr2 film, that impede its high performance.32,33 Hence the SnO2 surface modification can help to avoid the photochemical reactions and improve the thermal stability of inorganic PSCs.

Moreover, we studied the room-temperature phase stability of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite materials. The measurements were carried out at 25 °C in air at a relative humidity of 65%. The results for the device with CsPbIBr2 deposited on the passivated SnO2 film are shown in Fig. S12.† They show that CsPbIBr2 is very unstable when the film changes from red to transparent quickly within 80 min. From the time-dependent XRD patterns of the sample, we observed that the phase changes from the photo-active α phase to the non-photoactive δ phase after 80 min.10 There is no obvious difference in phase stability for the perovskite film deposited on the SnO2 ESL with or without passivation at room temperature because the phase transition is mainly caused by water. However, after the re-heating process in air, the transparent film re-transformed to the red colored film, indicating reversible phase transition properties, which is in accordance with Peidong Lin research.34 Therefore, the room-temperature phase stability of CsPbX3 perovskite materials, especially for the halide-rich phases, is one of the most important aspects that are required to be promptly addressed.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our work has demonstrated an efficient interface engineering method of SnO2 ESL passivation, which aims to reduce the energy loss of all-inorganic Cs-based PSCs. We found that the passivation of SnO2 not only effectively decreases the recombination at the interface between the CsPbIBr2 perovskite and SnO2, but also accelerates electron extraction from the perovskite film. After passivation, the efficiency was dramatically enhanced and a high Voc of 1.31 V was achieved. The passivated SnO2 based devices significantly outperformed the bare SnO2 based solar cells in terms of thermal stability. This work has proved that energy losses occurring in all-inorganic PSCs can be overcome through interface engineering. We believe that this method is highly applicable to other PSCs for decreasing the Eloss.
