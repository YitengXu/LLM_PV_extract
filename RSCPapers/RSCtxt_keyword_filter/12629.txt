    , Accepted 18th July 2022First published on 19th July 2022AbstractStibnite Sb2S3 and tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures being economical, environmentally benign and having a high absorption coefficient are highly promising materials for energy conversion applications. However, producing these materials especially tetrahedrite in the phase pure form is a challenging task. In this report we present a structurally characterized single source molecular precursor [Sb(4,6-Me2pymS)3] for the facile synthesis of binary Sb2S3 as well as ternary Cu12Sb4S13 in oleylamine (OAm) at a relatively lower temperature. The as-prepared Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures were thoroughly checked for their phase purity, elemental composition and morphology by powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron microscopy techniques. pXRD and EDS studies confirm the formation of phase pure, crystalline orthorhombic Sb2S3 and cubic Cu12Sb4S13. The SEM, TEM and HRTEM images depict the formation of well-defined nanorods and nearly spherical nanocrystals for Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13, respectively. The Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals exhibit an optical bandgap of ∼1.88 and 2.07 eV, respectively, which are slightly blue-shifted relative to their bulk bandgap, indicating the quantum confinement effect. Finally, efficient photoresponsivity and good photo-stability were achieved in the as-prepared Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructure-based prototype photo-electrochemical cell, which make them promising candidates for alternative low-cost photon absorber materials.
Introduction
Ever-increasing environmental and energy concerns have led to an unquenchable quest for non-toxic and Earth abundant active absorber materials for solar cell applications.1 In this context, metal chalcogenides are widely considered as admirable candidates owing to their large absorption coefficients with a wide sunlight wavelength region and high sunlight irradiation stability.2 The recent addition to the family of photon absorber metal chalcogenides is group-V chalcogenides, benefitting from their exciting electrical and optical properties. Among the various group-V chalcogenides, antimony sulfide has recently drawn significant attention as an energy conversion material.3 For instance, Sb2S3, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal structure with the Pnma(62) space group, has a high absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 and a direct band gap of ∼1.7 eV.4,5 Due to such a wide bandgap, Sb2S3 can generate a high open circuit voltage which makes it an attractive light absorber material for the top cell in Si-based tandem solar cells. Moreover, being RoHS (restriction of hazardous substances) compliant and having advantages of relatively abundant resources, non-toxicity, high stability, etc., Sb2S3 is projected as a fine candidate for the development of sustainable solar cells3,6 as well as a promising substitute for well-established photon absorbers which are based either on scarce (Ga, In, Te) or toxic (Cd, Pb) elements.7,8
Beyond binary chalcogenides, there is a complex yet interesting class of ternary materials. These materials not only exhibit physical and electronic properties appropriate for photovoltaics, but also have multiple degrees of freedom for tailoring their physical properties such as band gap engineering via stoichiometric variation.9 One such interesting family of ternary materials is copper antimony sulfides (CAS). There are various distinct phases of CAS which include CuSbS2 (chalcostibite), Cu3SbS4 (skinnerite), Cu3SbS4 (fematinite), and C12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite), comprising abundant and non-toxic elements.10 These are p-type semiconductors with typically very high absorption coefficient values and a direct band gap which varies between 1 and 1.8 eV depending upon the crystal structure.11,12 Among the different phases of CAS, CuSbS2 (1.4–1.5 eV) and Cu12Sb4S13 (1.6–1.7 eV) have the most suitable band gap values with respect to the highest theoretically predicted power conversion efficiencies.11,13 In addition, tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13 is an attractive candidate for thermoelectric devices, owing to its intrinsically low thermal conductivity attributed to the unique features of its crystal structure.14 In spite of these advantageous characteristics, investigations into CAS are limited with the literature mainly dominated by CuSbS2 while other pivotal phases like tetrahedrite are largely overlooked. This may be possibly due to the difficulty in obtaining phase pure tetrahedrite as there are high chances of formation of Cu3SbS4 and CuSbS2 secondary phases.15–17
Owing to the paramount importance of Sb2S3 (stibnite) and Cu12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite) in photovoltaics, various solution phase and wet chemical methods have been reported for their preparation. These include hydrothermal,18,19 solvothermal,20,21 hot-injection,22,23 drop-casting or spin coating techniques.24 Most of these methods use different sources of the metal and chalcogen and are categorised as a dual source precursor route. In contrast, a molecular precursor, which comprises a pre-formed bond between the desired elements of materials, offers several distinct advantages in terms of simplicity, lower defect concentration and the ability to produce nanomaterials under milder conditions with better control over their stoichiometries and good reproducibility.25,26 In addition, molecular precursors are equally suitable for the preparation of nanomaterials and deposition of thin films.27 Revaprasadu and co-workers have successfully used thio-benzoates and seleno-benzoates for the preparation of Sb2S3, Sb2Se3 and Sb2(S1−xSex)3 solid solutions for electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage.28,29 Antimony xanthates have been explored by Han et al. for the preparation of self-standing Sb2S3 thin films.30 Obtaining phase pure ternary Cu12Sb4S13 is far more challenging than binary Sb2S3. Cu12Sb4S13 is conventionally prepared by a solid state route which requires heating the constituent elements at high temperatures in evacuated quartz ampoules for an extended period followed by post annealing treatment.31 Alternatively, reports suggest that high-purity Cu12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite) can easily be produced using a molecular precursor route.15,32,33 For instance, Lewis and co-workers have used both xanthates and dithiocarbamates of Cu and Sb to obtain Cu12Sb4S13.15,30 Similarly, Rath et al. have used xanthates to produce Cu12Sb4S13 and studied its photo-induced charge transfer characteristics.10 In another experiment, diethylcarbamates of copper and antimony were successfully used for the solvothermal preparation of high-purity Cu12Sb4S13with multiply-voided morphology.33 However, to date, only a handful of molecular precursors derived from xanthates,10,15,28 dithiocarbamates32–34 and thio-benzoates28,29 have been used for the preparation of Sb2S3 and CAS.
Previously, our group has successfully used hemilabile internally functionalized chalcogenolate ligand derived metal complexes for the facile synthesis of binary and ternary metal chalcogenide nanostructures and thin films which have been evaluated for their photo-responsive behaviour and energy storage applications.26,35,36 The internally functionalized ligand especially pyridyl/pyrimidyl chalcogenolates provides stability to the precursor towards an oxidizing environment.37,38 To expand the horizon of molecular precursors for binary antimony sulfide and ternary copper antimony sulfide, in this article we present the synthesis and characterization including structure elucidation of an air-stable antimony(III)-4,6-dimethylpyrimidylthiolate complex. The utility of the complex as a molecular precursor for the facile preparation of phase pure binary Sb2S3 nanorods and ternary Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals has been demonstrated. The as-prepared nanostructures exhibit high photo-responsivity and good photo-stability under alternating light and dark conditions which indicates their suitability as photo-absorber materials in solar cells. The results of this work are described herein.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and spectroscopy
Treatment of SbCl3 with three equivalents of 4,6-MepymS− (prepared by the reaction of 4,6 PymSH·HCl with 6 equivalents of NEt3) resulted in the final product as a crystalline powder in a good quantitative yield (Scheme 1). The 1H NMR spectrum of the complex displayed expected resonances and peak multiplicities. The pyrimidyl ring proton resonances of the complex are shifted downfield with reference to the corresponding signals for the free ligand.

The complex crystallizes as a discrete monomer having a monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/n while the unit cell of the same accommodates four complex molecules. In complex 1, the antimony atom adopts distorted square pyramidal geometry due to a stereochemically active lone pair where the coordination core is defined by “S3N2” donor atoms. The equatorial position is occupied by two chelating ligands through sulfur (S2, S3) and nitrogen atoms (N3, N6) whereas the axial position is occupied by the S1 atom of the third non-chelating ligand. The structural prospect, especially geometry distortion of the main group metal complexes, is predominantly governed by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR). Thus, the geometry of the six electron pair complex having composition AL3L′2X (A = central atom Sb, L = S, L′ = N, X = lone pair) is governed by the lone pair–bond pair repulsion, which explains the deviation from the coplanarity of S2, N3, S3 and N6 atoms. However, the chelating behavior of the ligand cannot be ignored as an important factor for the deviation from the ideal square pyramidal geometry. It is the very reason the bond angles of N3–Sb1–S2 = 59.6(1), N6–Sb1–S3 = 59.8(1), S1–Sb1–N3 = 91.5(1) and S1–Sb1–N6 = 84.8(1) deviated from the standard value of 90° but all are in the expected range of documented values.38,39 Moreover, the non-chelating behaviour of the third ligand can be rationalized from the steric crowding offered by the hydrogen atoms in the three vicinal methyl groups (C5, C9 and C18).
The crystal packing diagram of complex 1 (ESI Fig. S1a†) shows that the monomeric [Sb(4,6-Me2pymS)3] molecules are interlinked together to form an infinite chain network through Sb1⋯N6 (3.451 Å) and C10–H10B⋯S1 (2.843 Å) short contacts. These intermolecular distances are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms involved (sum of the van der Waals radii of Sb and N = 3.61 and H and S = 2.9 Å) which indicates the presence of strong non-bonding secondary interactions. Moreover, these chain-like assemblies are interlocked to each other by C3–H3⋯S1 (2.887 Å) interactions to form the 3D structure (ESI Fig. S1b†). These distances are also shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of S and H which confirms ample non-bonding interactions between them.
The equatorial Sb–S bond distances Sb1–S2 = 2.493(1) & Sb1–S3 = 2.502(1) are in good agreement with the reported values whereas the axial Sb1–S1 bond is shorter as expected. It is worth mentioning here that axial Sb–S (axial as well as equatorial) 1 is the shortest as compared to any similar type of complex reported so far.39 The Sb1–N3 and Sb1–N6 bond distances 2.755(5) and 2.747(6) respectively are slightly elongated compared to the documented values i.e. 2.563(6) & 2.676(6) Å in [Sb(2-SC4H3N2)3]39 and 2.470(1) Å in [Sb(2-SC5H4N)3].40 However, it is comparable to the Sb/Bi and N distance of 2.76 and 2.8 Å reported in [Sb(Se–C5H3(Me-3)N)3] and [Bi(Se–C5H3(Me-3)N)3]41 which is considered as a weak interaction between Sb/Bi and N. Hence, in [Sb(4,6-Me2PymS)3] also, weak interaction may be considered between the Sb and N as it is significantly shorter than the van der Waals radii (3.55 Å) but slightly greater than the covalent radii. The average C–S bond distance is 1.75 Å, which is comparable to that reported for [Sb(pmt)3].39 No significant changes in the C–S bond reflect the existence of the thiol form predominantly over the thione form. The comparative prospects about selected bond lengths and bond angle parameters are summarized in Table 3.

Comparative structure prospect of [Sb(4,6-Me2pymS)3] (1)
A comparative prospect elucidates that the square pyramidal geometry is more favourable in the antimony complex derived from pyrimidyl thiol as described above. Even bulkier substitution on the pyrimidyl ring could not force higher order symmetry (Table 3). Similarly, the type of orientation noticed in compound 1 also strongly supports the square pyramidal geometry. However, an octahedral geometry is attained around antimony in compound 1. The close separation of the Sb⋯ atom in the unit cell of compound 1 seems to act as a driving force for the stabilization of the square pyramidal geometry.
Thermal studies
In order to gain insight into the relative volatility and thermal stability of the complex, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the same was performed under an inert atmosphere of flowing argon (Ar) (Fig. 2). Moreover, TGA also provided valuable information about the potential of a molecular precursor to produce the corresponding material. The TG and DTG plot as presented in Fig. 2 reveals that the complex 1 remains stable up to ∼148 °C, beyond which, it undergoes single step decomposition at ∼250 °C, followed by gradual weight loss before the plateau is reached. Surprisingly, the weight loss observed in the TG curve (∼81.8%) of the complex does not correspond to the transformation of the same into antimony sulfide, elemental antimony or sulfur. It is well reported in the literature that the volatile nature and possibility of sublimation at an elevated temperature in some antimony complexes with a sulfur-containing ligand restrict the exact determination of the nature of residue on the basis of weight loss percentage.42,43 In order to investigate the nature of residue, the complex 1 was furnace heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under flowing Ar up to 330 °C. The temperature was maintained for 1 h, after which the heating was stopped and the furnace was cooled to room temperature under flowing Ar. The pXRD of the shiny black residue obtained after solid state decomposition of the complex revealed the formation of an orthorhombic phase of Sb2S3 (ESI Fig. S2†). It is important to note here that there are several reports in the literature, wherein despite the mismatch between the calculated and observed weight loss in TG, the complex serves as an efficient precursor for the synthesis of nanostructures by either solventless or solvent mediated routes.26,32,36,44

Preparation and characterization of antimony sulfide nanostructures
The thermogravimetric analysis and the subsequent characterization of the residue confirm that complex 1 can be utilized as a suitable single source precursor for the preparation of antimony sulfide materials. To further validate the utility of the complex as a single source molecular precursor for the preparation of antimony sulfide nanostructures, thermolysis of the same was performed by a heat-up method in OAm at 180 °C for 10 min. During temperature optimization, it was observed that the precursor was stable below 170 °C and shows no sign of decomposition. Therefore, for complete decomposition to occur, thermolysis temperature was set at 180 °C. The solvent OAm was primarily chosen due to the fact that it can perform the role of a high boiling solvent (boiling point 350 °C) and a strong capping agent, simultaneously. OAm being liquid at room temperature makes the purification procedure of the final product relatively simple. Moreover, OAm also aids in the decomposition of the precursor.45 The primary amine interacts with the molecular precursor and accelerates its decomposition which promotes the formation of monodisperse particles by separating the nucleation and growth step.46 Revaprasadu et al. have reported the synthesis of antimony selenide nanorods in OAm at a relatively lower temperature.47 In the present case also the thermolysis temperature is significantly lowered compared to the decomposition temperature (250 °C) as inferred from TG analysis, indicating the possible involvement of OAm as a catalyst in the thermolysis of the precursor.
The reflections from the pXRD pattern of the nanostructures synthesized from 1 (Fig. 3a) can be indexed to phase pure orthorhombic Sb2S3 (ICSD 22176) with lattice parameters a = 11.23 Å, b = 11.31 Å, and c = 3.84 Å; and the Pnma space group symmetry with major peaks at 2θ = 28.0, 28.2, 31.1, and 31.3° corresponding to the (230), (211), (301), and (240) planes, respectively. The intensity profile of the pXRD pattern also matches very well with the standard pattern. The strong and sharp pXRD peaks indicate high crystallinity of Sb2S3 nanostructures. The pXRD pattern does not contain any other reflections which confirm the phase purity of the antimony sulfide nanostructures. The average crystallite size calculated from the Scherrer equation was found to be ∼32 nm. At this point it is important to mention that the Scherrer equation is often used to estimate the crystallite size by correlating the scattering domain size and the line broadening in the pXRD pattern. However, there are other factors that may contribute to the peak broadening observed in the pXRD patterns, including crystal distortion and defect sites.

The 2D elemental mapping presented in ESI Fig. S3a† shows a uniform distribution of Sb and S within the nanostructures. To gain better insight into the composition of the as-prepared antimony sulfide, EDS analysis was performed which revealed that the ratio of Sb:S is 39.9:60.1 (2:3) confirming the formation of Sb2S3 (ESI Fig. S3b†). The crystalline nature of the as-synthesized nanorods was further affirmed from SAED analyses where well-defined discrete spots were observed (ESI Fig. S4†).
The morphology of the as-prepared Sb2S3 was investigated by the electron microscopy technique. SEM and TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 3b and c clearly depict the formation of well-defined nanorods with an average width of ∼33–50 nm. HRTEM images given in Fig. 3d show the presence of clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing value of 4.4 Å which can be indexed to the (130) plane of orthorhombic Sb2S3. The growth of 1-dimensional nanorods can be understood on the basis of orientation and the anisotropic nature of their building blocks. The crystal structure of Sb2S3 is composed of infinite one-dimensional long chains of Sb4S6 wherein the atoms are connected with strong covalent bonds. The two chains are connected by weak van der Waals forces of attraction between the sulfur atom of one chain and the antimony atom of the other chain giving rise to a three-dimensional orthorhombic structure as shown in Fig. 3e. These weak van der Waals interactions vanish at higher temperature (in the present case 180 °C) leading to the separation of chains, which facilitates the formation of 1-dimensional nanostructures. It should be noted here that such anisotropic structures find great relevance in energy storage and energy conversion devices.48
Preparation and characterization of copper antimony sulfide nanostructures
Various synthetic methodologies have been developed for the preparation of Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures. However, it is a challenging task to control the stoichiometry and the phase purity of ternary nanostructures prepared by multi-source precursors, due to the different reactivities of the metal precursors. For instance, Colombara et al. reported the sulfurization of Sb–Cu metal precursors at different temperatures which resulted in the formation of CuSbS2 films with a minor presence of a binary CuS phase.49 Embden et al. used CuCl, SbCl3 and bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide to produce tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13. They found that an excess of sulfur is known to promote the formation of famatinite Cu3SbS4 instead of Cu12Sb4S13 while a reduced sulfur content causes the contamination from the antimony sulfide impurity phase.11 Recently, Regulacio et al. used copper(II) diethyldithiocarbamate and antimony(III) diethyldithiocarbamate complexes as precursors to prepare tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13. Their investigation established that to obtain pure tetrahedrite from the decomposition of copper and antimony dithiocarbamates, a mixture of coordinating solvents (oleylamine + dodecanethiol) in an appropriate ratio has to be used. In pure OAm or DDT, either famatinite Cu3SbS4 or skinnerite Cu3SbS3 as the major phase was yielded.31
Following the success of producing binary Sb2S3, the precursor was further investigated for its ability to synthesize more complex and interesting Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures. In the present case, for the synthesis of copper antimony sulfide nanostructures, the complex 1 was co-thermolyzed with Cu(acac)2 (in a 1:1 molar ratio) by a heat-up technique in pure OAm at 180 °C. Once the temperature was reached, the reaction temperature was maintained for 10 minutes followed by separation of the material by repeated centrifugation and washing. The crystal structure, morphology and homogeneity of the nanostructures were investigated by pXRD, EDS, SEM, TEM and SAED.
The pXRD pattern of the nanomaterial thus synthesized showed Bragg's reflections at 2θ = 24.4, 29.8, 32.3, 34.8, 36.8, 39.1, 42.8, 44.6, 48.1, 49.8, 54.7 and 59.2° (Fig. 4a). These reflections can be matched with those originating from the planes of cubic Cu12Sb4S13 with the I3m space group (ICSD 14619). Furthermore, the reflection along the (222) plane is most intense, indicating the preferential growth of nanocrystals along that plane. It is important to note here that the absence of reflections from any binary phase or other phases of CAS ensures the phase purity of the synthesized product. The lattice parameter (a = 10.33 Å) calculated by the least squares fitting method is comparable to the reported value. The average crystallite size calculated from the Scherrer equation was found to be ∼22 nm.

2-D elemental mapping was performed to understand the distribution of constituent elements of Cu12Sb4S13. The resultant elemental map provided in ESI Fig. S5† shows the homogeneous distribution of Cu, Sb and S within the material. This observation further confirms the formation of the ternary metal sulfide as opposed to separate binary phases. The average elemental composition of the nanocrystals has been determined by EDS. The analysis suggests the formation of the material with the atomic ratio of Cu:Sb:S being 11.8:4.1:12.4 which is very close to what is expected.
Scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were performed to examine the morphology of the as-prepared tetrahedrite sample. Representative micrographs are displayed in Fig. 4b and c. From the figures it is apparent that the tetrahedrite nanocrystals have nearly spherical morphology. Clear lattice fringes, indicative of the crystalline nature of particles can be clearly observed in the HRTEM image given in Fig. 4d. Upon examination of these lattice fringes, an inter-planar spacing of 2.98 Å was determined which corresponds to the (222) plane of cubic-phase tetrahedrite.
It is noteworthy that tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13 is an attractive photon absorber material owing to its high absorption coefficient which is attributed to its unique structure displayed in Fig. 4e. Tetrahedrite consists of a mixed oxidation-state Cu2+ (d9) and Cu1+ (d10) to maintain charge neutrality and unusual stoichiometry and possesses tetrahedrally (Cu(1)) and trigonally (Cu(2)) coordinated copper atoms. Similarly, two types of sulfur atoms are also present viz. tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated.11 Overall, the structure can be viewed as a 3D Cu–S framework which provides a continuous path for carrier conduction along with a structurally isolated low-valent Sb(III) atom which adopts a highly asymmetric coordination environment. This can lead to long distances between the Sb atoms, resulting in flat bands and high joint densities of states. Overall, these unique features of the tetrahedrite structure contribute to its high absorption coefficient as explained by Heo et al.50
Optical properties
Stibnite Sb2S3 and tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13 have been projected as attractive candidates for optoelectronics and photovoltaics owing to their high absorption coefficient and suitable narrow band-gap. Both Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 have a bulk direct band gap close to 1.7 eV.4,13 In view of the importance of optical band-gap in nanoelectronics, the optical properties of Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals were investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and the optical band gaps of these materials were determined using a plot of the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R) as given in the following equation:[F(R)hν]n = A(hν − Eg)where hν is photon energy, A is a constant, Eg denotes the band gap, and n depends on the nature of the optical transition. The direct band gap of the materials was calculated using Tauc's model (n = 2).
From the diffuse reflectance spectra presented in Fig. 5, it was observed that the direct optical band gaps of Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals is ∼1.88 and 2.07 eV, respectively, which are distinctly blue shifted with respect to the bulk band gap. The increase in the band gap value of the as-prepared nanostructures with respect to the bulk band gap values may be either due to quantum confinement or lattice distortion or surface lattice defects.51 For instance, Mishra et al. have prepared Sb2S3 nanoparticles having a dimension of 5–80 nm and have shown a linear blue shift of the band gap with the inverse square of particle size indicative of the quantum confinement phenomenon.52 Geng et al. have reported 1.9 eV bandgap for Sb2S3 nanowires having a diameter of 20–50 nm.53 Similarly, for spherical tetrahedrite nanoparticles band gap tuning from 2.45 to 1.82 eV has been demonstrated by Chen et al.54 In another report, Lewis et al. have reported 1.49 eV band gap for spherical tetrahedrite particles synthesized from the reactive melts of metal xanthates.43 In the present case the estimated band-gap values of Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals are close to the one reported for quantum confined particles; however, the contribution of surface lattice distortion towards the blue shift of the band gap cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, the bandgap of nanostructures falls in the range suitable for photon absorber materials.

Photoresponse measurements of Si/Sb2S3 and Si/Cu12Sb4S13 based liquid junction photoelectrochemical cells
Photoresponsivity and photo-stability are important criteria to select an absorber material for photovoltaic and photodetector applications. To test the photoresponse of a semiconductor film (of different types and morphologies), photoelectrochemical characterization is an excellent reliable tool as there are no complications associated with additional contacts.11 A high photoresponse can be achieved when a material has a high absorption coefficient, larger effective mass and suitable band-gap value. Since both Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 fulfil the above-mentioned requirements,55 evaluating the photo-electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures is considered worth. Accordingly, the photo-electrochemical cells were prepared using the Si/Sb2S3 or Si/Cu12Sb4S13 geometry as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter and pseudo reference electrodes in aqueous Na2S (0.6 M):Na2SO3 (0.8 M) (1:2) as the electrolyte. A colloidal solution of Sb2S3 or Cu12Sb4S13 nanostructures in chloroform was dropcast over the silicon substrate (100) orientation to prepare the working electrode.
In the present work, I–V curves for both the cells (Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13) show nonlinear characteristics as shown in Fig. 6a. There is a remarkable increase in current under illumination conditions relative to that of dark current due to photo-generated carriers. The photo-response of both the nanostructures as a function of time was measured under a white light intensity of 200 μW cm−2 with a bias voltage of −1.5 V and is displayed in Fig. 6b. The study revealed a highly stable photo-response of both the cells (Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13) under dark and light conditions for more than 3000 s. The generated photocurrent (Ipc = Ilight − Idark) upon illumination for Sb2S3 shows a remarkable jump of ∼49 μA while it is significantly higher for ternary tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13i.e., ∼76 μA. At this point it is to be noted that the dark current is also higher for Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals whereas Sb2S3 nanorods in the dark show low but more constant current. The higher magnitude of the dark current and photocurrent for ternary Cu12Sb4S13 relative to binary Sb2S3 is plausibly because copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with high electrical conductivity. Wang et al. documented that the photocurrent of 1.9 μA with a large dark current of 19.6 μA in the Cu12Sb4S13 film is due to the high carrier (hole) density as suggested by the close proximity between the Fermi energy and the valence band.24 Chao et al. demonstrated the effect of morphology on photoresponse. On illumination with a power intensity of 24.5 mW cm−2, Sb2S3 nanoflowers show a photoresponse from 2.5 nA to 95 nA with a low dark current while nanoneedles show a photoresponse from 3.9 mA to 7.5 mA. This is attributed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoflowers (assembled by numerous porous sheets) than nanoneedles which could bring an increase of sensitive area and hence enhance the oxygen absorption/desorption process, leading to an enhancement of carrier injection and transport.56 In another investigation, Zhong et al. studied the effect of light source power on the photoresponse of Sb2S3 nanowires. They found that the highest photoresponse was obtained when Sb2S3 nanowires were illuminated with a 638 nm laser at room temperature.57 Performance comparison of Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 is summarised in Table 4.

Photoresponsivity (R) or photocurrent generation efficiency is the ratio of generated photocurrent and incident optical power (R = Ipc/PS) which is expressed as the photocurrent (Ipc) generated by the light power density (P = 200 μW cm−2) on the effective area of a photodetector (S = 0.785 cm2 in the present case). In the present case, the as-prepared Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals exhibit a high photoresponsivity value of 312 mA W−1 and 446 mA W−1, respectively.
Since the photoresponse of Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystal films is encouraging, switching behavior for both the cells was studied. Fig. 7(a and c) display the current versus time plots i.e., switching (∼50 s light on, 50 s light off) for the prepared Si/Sb2S3 and Si/Cu12Sb4S13 cells. Both the electrodes exhibit a good switching over ∼24 cycles. Light energy excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and results in increased photoconductivity. This increase is almost constant when the light is on and experiences a sudden decrease in conductivity due to the loss of charge carriers when light is turned off. These good cycle-to-cycle reproducibility and stable retention performance can make these materials efficient and stable working electrodes. From the repeated cycles, the middle cycle has been chosen to calculate the rise time (the time required for the current to increase from 10% to 90% of the peak value) and the fall time in each case. The rise and fall time for Sb2S3 nanorods is 9 and 8 s, respectively, while the same for Cu12Sb4S13 is ∼8 and ∼10 s, respectively (Fig. 7b and d). The difference in the rise time and fall time is possibly due to the involvement of trap states or defects in the switching process.

Conclusion
This article describes the room temperature synthesis and characterization including structural elucidation of an air-stable antimony 4,6-dimethylpyrimidylthiolate complex. The complex was explored as a cost effective molecular precursor for the facile preparation of technologically important binary Sb2S3 and ternary Cu12Sb4S13 materials in the nano-regime. The nanostructures were synthesized in OAm well below the decomposition temperature of the complex as inferred from TGA, suggesting the possible role of OAm as a catalyst in the decomposition of the precursor. Electron microscopy studies revealed the formation of well-defined Sb2S3 nanorods and nearly spherical Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals with a homogeneous presence of constituent elements within the nanostructures. The estimated bandgaps of nanostructures are blue shifted with respect to the bulk bandgap and are in the range suitable for solar cell application. The prototype photo-electrochemical cell fabricated from the as-prepared Sb2S3 nanorods and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals showed remarkable photoresponsivity and photostability under alternating light and dark conditions. The synthetic route can be used to develop other economical and stable metal thiolate precursors for the facile synthesis of metal sulfide nanostructures. Moreover, the promising photoresponsivity and photostability properties of Sb2S3 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanoparticles have provided a new dimension to study the prospects of higher analogues i.e. the bismuth and selenium family in the near future.
