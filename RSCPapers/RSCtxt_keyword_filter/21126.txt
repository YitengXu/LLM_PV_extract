    , Accepted 9th March 2011First published on 4th April 2011AbstractPhotochemically stable poly(ionic liquids) (poly(ILs)) including poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide) ([PBVIm][Br]) and poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) ([PBVIm][TFSI]) were synthesized and dissolved in the room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) to form quasi-solid-state electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), without using any volatile organic solvent. DSSCs based on IL/[PBVIm][TFSI] gel electrolyte yielded a power conversion efficiency of 4.4% under a simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The superior long-term stability of fabricated DSSCs indicated that the DSSCs based on solvent-free IL/poly(ILs) gel electrolytes could overcome the drawbacks of cells containing volatile solvents.
Introduction
Since the first model cell reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently attracting a great deal of academic and industrial interest because of their high efficiency and low cost.2 Photoelectric conversion efficiency up to 11% has been achieved for liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs.3 However, the leakage and volatilization of the organic solvent electrolyte limit the long-term performance of liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs. To overcome these drawbacks, several attempts, such as using p-type semiconductors,4 organic hole conductors,5,6 physically cross-linked gelators,7,8 and polymer gel electrolytes,9 have been applied to replace the liquid electrolytes. Among these technologies, quasi-solid-state polymer electrolytes have been attracting a great deal of interest because of their nonflammability, negligible vapor pressure, good contact with the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode and counter electrode.10–12
Up to now, several types of polymer gel electrolytes based on poly(acrylonitrile),13 poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (poly(St-AN)),14 poly(ethylene oxide),9poly(ethylene glycol),11,15 polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),16 poly(acrylic acid)-(ethylene glycol),10 poly(siloxane-co-ethylene oxide),17 and poly(vinylidene-fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP)7,12,18,19 have been prepared. However, all these polymers require conventional volatile organic solvents, such as propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, 3-methoxypropionitrile, N,N-dimethylacetamide, γ-butyrolactone, and N-methyl pyrrolidone, which act as plasticizers.10–20 Unfortunately, for outdoor use, the presence of a volatile solvent in quasi-solid-state DSSCs still gives rise to such potential problems as high-temperature instability and flammability.21 Therefore, the replacement of organic solvent plasticizers is particularly critical for real DSSC application.
Room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are mostly organic salts with melting points below or near room temperature. They are attracting wide attention because of their negligible vapor pressure, high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical window.22–24 Recently, ILs have been widely used as an important source for iodide-based redox couples and as electrolytes in DSSCs.25 Although there are already numerous works reporting the fabrication of DSSCs based on room temperature ILs, these devices are still suffering leakage problems in practical use.
More recently, growing attention has been paid to polymeric ILs ((poly(ILs), polymers formed from IL monomers) because they are a new class of polymers that combine both the novel properties of ILs and improved mechanical durability and dimensional control resulting from polymerization.26 Compared with non-ionic polymers (e.g.PVdF-HFP, poly(St-AN) and PMMA), poly(ILs) usually have higher ionic conductivity. Recently, IL oligomers27 and poly(ILs)28 have been used as solid polymer electrolytes for solid-state DSSCs. The resultant cells show maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 3.1% and 0.65%, respectively. On the other hand, poly(ILs) have been dissolved in organic solvents to fabricate quasi-solid-state DSSCs.29–31 However, these DSSCs also suffer from the volatilization of organic solvents.
Here, we report high-performance quasi-solid-state DSSCs using IL/imidazolium-type poly(ILs) as gel electrolytes. The poly(ILs) were prepared viafree radical polymerization of a monomer composed of N-methylimidazolium with a vinyl moiety. The synthesized poly(ILs) could be easily dissolved in room temperature ILs to form gel electrolytes, without using any volatile organic solvent. The fabricated DSSCs displayed better long-term stability than those with conventional liquid electrolytes, indicating that IL/poly(ILs) gel electrolytes are promising candidates for solar cells with good durability.
Experimental procedure
Materials

1-Iodopropane, bromoethane, 1-bromobutane, 1-methylimidazole, 1-vinylimidazole, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium iodide and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII)/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) were synthesized according to the previous reports.22TiCl4 and H2PtCl6 were purchased from Aldrich. cis-Bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) ([RuL2(NCS)2]) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland) and used without any further purification.
Synthesis of ILs and poly(ILs)

          1-Butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide ([BVIm][Br], primrose yellow) was synthesized by the reaction of 1-bromobutane with 1-vinylimidazole at room temperature for 3 days. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCCl3): 10.98 (s, 1H), 7.77 (s, 1H), 7.50 (dd, 1H), 7.46 (m, 1H), 5.95 (m, 1H), 5.36 (m, 1H), 4.38 (t, 3H), 1.91 (m, 2H), 1.37 (m, 2H), 0.96 (t, 3H). Yield: 74%. Poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide) ([PBVIm][Br]) was prepared viapolymerization of [BVIm][Br] in ethanol at 60 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h.32 Anion-exchange of [PBVIm][Br] with LiTFSI in aqueous solution yielded poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) ([PBVIm][TFSI]).33 Poly(St-AN) (Mn = 29700 and PDI = 1.84) was synthesized viafree radical polymerization, as reported in the literature.14 All the polymers were dissolved in liquid electrolyte containing 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M TBP, and a mixture of PMII/EMITFSI (13:7, v:v) at 80 °C for about 8 h under nitrogen atmosphere to form quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolytes.
Fabrication of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs
Cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film.34,35 Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles were coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in 0.5 mM [RuL2(NCS)2] ethanol solution at room temperature for 24 h. Afterward, the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching either the liquid or polymer electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a Pt counter electrode. The resulting cells were placed in a vacuum to remove air to guarantee optimum filling and fine electrical contact. The produced devices were sealed with epoxy resin for measurements.
Characterization and photovoltaic measurements
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a ProStar LC240 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The viscosity measurements were carried out on a viscometer (Haake® Rheo Stress 6000, Germany). Steady-state voltammetry was tested in a conventional photoelectrochemical cell equipped with a 5.0 μm radius platinum ultramicroelectrode (CHI107) as the working electrode, and a platinum foil as the counter electrode. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminium foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 15, 50 and 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 260 1/4).
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows a general synthetic procedure and chemical structures of the synthesized poly(ILs). The chemical structures of the produced poly(ILs) are confirmed by FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. 1. The absorption peaks at 1170, 1161 and 1126 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching and asymmetric stretching vibrations of C–N of imidazole rings.33 An absorption band at around 1656 cm−1 (Fig. 1a) which is ascribed to the CC stretching band of monomer [BVIm][Br] disappears after polymerization while the CN stretching vibration belonging to the imidazole ring is observed at about 1634 cm−1 (Fig. 1b,c). Compared with Fig. 1b, new bands corresponding to TFSI anion are observed at 1365, 1205, 1046 cm−1 in Fig. 1c indicating the successful anion exchange of polymers.33

Fig. 2 shows photographs of the polymer electrolytes. All the electrolyte samples are quasi-solid-state gels at room temperature. Table 1 shows the viscosity and ionic conductivity of the liquid and polymer electrolytes at 25 °C. The viscosity of the liquid electrolyte (139 cP) increased drastically with addition of synthesized poly(ILs) polymer. Since the diffusion of ions strongly depends on the viscosity of the electrolyte, higher viscosity generally leads to lower ionic conductivity. The viscosity of three polymer gels increased with the increase of polymer content and decreased with increasing temperature. The conductivity of the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based electrolyte is higher than that of the [PBVIm][Br]-based electrolyte at the same polymer content probably because of its relatively lower viscosity. It is not surprising that the poly(St-AN)-based electrolyte shows the lowest conductivity due to its nonionic polymeric network.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the fabricated DSSCs containing liquid electrolyte and polymer gel electrolytes under simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters including open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and the overall PCE of DSSCs are also summarized in Table 1. The device based on the liquid electrolyte showed Jsc of 11.27 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.653 V, FF of 0.716, and yielded a PCE of 5.3%. The parameters of the devices based on the polymer electrolytes decreased due to limited transport properties of these electrolytes.25 The lowest PCE was obtained for the poly(St-AN)-based cell because of its highest viscosity.

Cells are tested using an aluminium foil mask with an aperture area of 0.1 cm2; (b) in the dark. 
The lower PCE in quasi-solid-state DSSCs is due to the inferior diffusion coefficient of I3− in the polymer electrolyte. This is clearly visible in Fig. 4, which shows comparative steady-state voltammograms for liquid and polymer electrolytes obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, equipped with a 5 μm radius platinum ultramicroelectrode as the working electrode and a platinum foil as the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte demonstrates the highest diffusion coefficient of I3− (2.51 × 10−7 cm2s−1). Although the viscosity of the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based electrolyte is about 35 times higher than that of the liquid electrolyte, the diffusion coefficient of I3− in the liquid electrolyte is only 1.4 times higher than that in the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based electrolyte (1.76 × 10−7 cm2s−1). We assume that this discrepancy could be attributed to the interconnected IL nanochannels formed in the present polymer electrolytes in which I3− and I− can move freely.12 Therefore, the PCE of DSSCs based on [PBVIm][TFSI] still achieved a reasonable value. However, the diffusion coefficient of I3− is 1.01 × 10−7 cm2s−1 and 6.43 × 10−8 cm2s−1 in the [PBVIm][Br]- and poly(St-AN)-based electrolytes, respectively, due to the high viscosity of the electrolytes.

The Voc enhancement for the device based on [PBVIm][TFSI] electrolyte is assigned from the suppression of the dark current at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The dark current originates from the reduction of I3− by conduction band electrons from TiO2.34 As shown in Fig. 3b, the onset of the dark current is shifted by approx. 60 mV from [PBVIm][TFSI] to poly(St-AN). The lower dark current onset value indicates the lower I3−reduction rate (ket). The decrease of I3−ket should lead to an increase of Voc according to the following equation:34  where Iinj is the flux of charge resulting from sensitized injection related to the electron back transfer rate, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the TiO2 surface, and ket is the rate constant for I3−reduction. In the case of the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based cell, the hydrophobic polymer reduces the hydrophilic ionic mobility of I3− close to the TiO2 film, generating a lower dark current at overpotentials less than 0.31 V. Eventually, the reduction rate will decrease, which leads to the enhancement of Voc. However, the [PBVIm][Br]-based cell shows an increasing dark current with onset value less than 0.29 V (Fig. 3b). It is not surprising that the poly(St-AN)-based cell yielded the lowest Voc due to its highest dark current. The enhancement of Voc arising from suppression of the back electron transfer has also been observed in previous studies viapyridine derivatives grafting on TiO2 surfaces as well as co-grafting hexadecylmalonic acid.34,36 At the interface of TiO2-dye photoanode and electrolyte, a higher diffusion coefficient of I3− to the Pt counter electrode for the I− form could also lead to a lower I3−reduction (ket) rate, restraining the dark currents and obtaining a higher Voc as described. Furthermore, the diffusion of I− to the TiO2-dye photoanode is in favor of the regeneration of dye for the sustaining operation. Therefore, the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based cell shows a higher Voc (0.613 V) and a higher PCE (4.4%) in three polymer gel devices.
The IPCE values of devices based on different electrolytes are consistent with the PCE, as shown in Fig. 5. The maximum IPCE values at 530 nm are 66%, 34%, 44% and 61% for the liquid electrolyte, poly(St-AN)-, [PBVIm][Br]-, and [PBVIm][TFSI]-based electrolytes, respectively. The broad feature appears covering the visible spectrum range from 450 nm to 650 nm. The PCE values of the devices under different light intensity illumination are also summarized in Table 2. The superior device performances could be obtained under both high and low simulated sunlight irradiation. The DSSC based on the polymer electrolyte with [PBVIm][TFSI]-25 wt% displays a maximum PCE of 4.7% under AM 1.5 irradiance at 50 mW cm−2. Under high light intensity illumination, the charge recombination could become the dominating control factor to achieve the similar PCE, which can be accomplished under low light illumination.30

To investigate the long-term stability of the DSSCs, the cells fabricated with the liquid and polymer electrolytes are stored under ambient conditions without further sealing. The PCEs of the cells are measured every four days, as shown in Fig. 6. The total efficiencies are normalized to the values measured on the first day. During the first seven days, the efficiency of all the polymer electrolyte-based cells was enhanced due to the increased regeneration rate of the dye. The efficiency of the cells with the liquid electrolyte decreased gradually because of possible electrolyte leakage. It should be noted that the cells containing the [PBVIm][TFSI]-based electrolyte still retain most of their initial efficiency even after 50 days, indicating that the addition of [PBVIm][TFSI] could suppress the leakage of the liquid electrolyte, and therefore result in a better practical stability of the device. However, the efficiency of cells based on the [PBVIm][Br] electrolyte dramatically decayed after 25 days testing, probably due to the interhalogen interaction between Br− and I2.37

Conclusions
IL/poly(ILs)-based electrolytes have been prepared and employed to fabricate quasi-solid-state DSSCs, which are free of any volatile solvent. The cells based on [PBVIm][TFSI] electrolytes showed maximum efficiency of 4.4% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 as well as superior long-term stability, which indicated that the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on IL/poly(ILs) gel electrolytes could overcome the leakage problems of devices based on liquid electrolytes. These results demonstrate a feasible approach to quasi-solid-state DSSCs in future practical applications.
