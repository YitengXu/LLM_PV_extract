First published on 28th April 2008AbstractThis chapter reviews the literature reported during 2007 on fullerenes chemistry including fullerene production and properties, organic and organometallic chemistry, endohedral derivatives and advanced materials as well as theoretical studies and possible applications of fullerene and its derivatives.
Highlights
The in vitro antitumour activity of a novel fullerene-maleic anhydride derivative synthesized viaradical polymerization has been tested and the result showed that the derivative exhibits better antitumor activity against HeLa cells and bone tumour cells. The antitumor mechanism of water-soluble fullerene derivative has been investigated.1
1. Production, separation and properties of fullerenes
An integrated technology for the manufacture of C60 and C70 fullerenes with purity exceeding 99.5 and 98.0 wt%, respectively, has been developed.2 Extractable amounts of C60 and C70 fullerenes have been obtained by two-step pyrolysis of PCF3 and high-temperature pyrolysis of two fullerene precursors-1,2′-binaphthyl and 1,3-oligonaphthylene. The formation of fullerenes was confirmed by MALDI-TOF and HPLC analysis.4 Isolable quantities of C60fullerene have been achieved by flash pyrolysis of bromine-substituted truxenone derivatives.5 Size-tunable hexagonal C60fullerene nanosheets have been prepared using a liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation method. The prepared C60nanosheets are porous, very thin, and foldable in nature.6 Saturated C60 fullerenes with O2, N2 or Ar have been achieved by precipitation of C60 from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution saturated by these gases. The structure and chemical composition of the fullerenes was characterized by spectroscopic techniques.7
Onion-like fullerenes nanocarbons were synthesized in high yield and quality by arc discharge in water between pure graphite electrodes at the current of 50 A. Many spectroscopic techniques were employed to study the crystallography of these carbon nanostructures.8 Comparative analysis of processes in carbon arc and RF plasma during fullerene production has been presented. It has been found that the zone of fullerene formation is significantly larger in RF plasma reactor compared to arc reactor.9
An overview of the synthesis and characterization of different types of fullerene dimers such as directly bonded dimers, a short chain C60 dimer and other dimers with bridge molecules of varying length have been presented.10
Cage-opened C59 fullerenones with 18- and 19-membered-ring orifices has been prepared through peroxide-mediated stepwise cleavage of fullerene skeleton bonds. C59 fullerenones were found to encapsulate water under mild conditions as characterized by spectroscopic data and single-crystal structures.11
Systematic separation and quantification of C60 and C70 fullerenes using thermostated micro thin-layer chromatography have been studied. The reported separation protocol shows a capability for the evaluation of fullerenes quantity in commercial samples.12 Remarkable improvement in efficiency of filtration methods for fullerene purification has been achieved by using 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as solvent.13 It has been found that the encapsulation of fullerenes with a cyclotriveratrylene derivative system was preferred for the separation of C84fullerene from fullerenes mixture.14
The toxicity of C60fullerene and its derivatives have been reviewed.15 Toxicity evaluation of C60, C70 and C60(OH)24in vivo using embryonic zebrafish show’s that C60(OH)24 is significantly less toxic than C60. These studies also suggest that the embryonic zebrafish model is well-suited for the rapid assessment of nanomaterial toxicity.16
The increase of fullerene nanoparticle additives was found to improve the lubrication properties of regular mineral oil.17 The effect of C60fullerene water suspension on bacterial phospholipids and membrane phase behaviour has been investigated. It has been shown that the response in lipid composition and membrane phase behaviour depends on both the fullerene concentration and the cell wall morphology.18 The binding abilities of calix[5]arene-based host molecules for higher fullerenes in organic solvents and the structure of the host–guest complex of double-calix[5]arene and C76 have been investigated.19
The solubility of C60fullerene in long chain fatty acids esters have been tested, It has been found that C60 is not only soluble in the fatty acid esters but is also reactive with them under mild conditions. The C60 solubility in vegetable oils may pave the way for easier application of C60fullerene in medicinal chemistry and in additive chemistry for varnishes and fuels.20 The solubility of C60fullerene in toluene was found to increase with increasing pressure, and then decreased with a sharp maximum, suggesting a transition between solid phases.21 The solubility of C60 in water and other conventional organic solvents was remarkably improved by grafting hydrophilic PEO onto C60 using macroazo initiators. In addition, the thermal stability of PEO was dramatically increased by grafting onto C60fullerene.22 The solubilisation of C60 in water in the presence of aquatic HSs was found to be 8–540 times higher than that in the blank solution.23 Thermodynamic properties of C60 solutions in individual and mixed organic solvents,24 and polythermal solubility of C60 and fullerene mixture in higher isomeric carboxylic acids have been studied within the 20–80 °C range.25,26

Fullerene C60 as a superefficient quencher of singlet exited states of PAH has been found by the quenching of fluorescence of PAH by C60 in ethylbenzene at 293 K. The overlap integrals of the PAH fluorescence spectra with the C60absorption spectrum and the critical energy transfer distances have been calculated.27
The effect of the C60 and C70fullerene contents on the dielectric properties of polyimide films has been presented. It has been found that the modification of polyimide with C70 has no significant influence on time constants, while increasing the amount of C60 leads to shorter beta-relaxation time.28
Relative stabilities of six C74fullerene cages have been evaluated using the Gibbs energy in a broad temperature interval. The computations indicate that the isolation of other C74 cages, in addition to the IPR isomer, is less likely though not impossible.29 DFT calculations were carried out to study the reactivities of Ih C60 and D5h C70 fullerenes. It was found that some of the C70 sites have larger reaction energies than that of C60, although C70 is energetically more stable than C60fullerene.30

A DFT study on the dimerization of C62, H2–C62, and F2–C62 were showed that all isomers of the H2–C62 dimer are appreciably more stable than the individual monomers. Although a large steric repulsion due to F atoms significantly reduces the stability of F2–C62 dimer, its two isomers were still more stable than separate monomer.70
