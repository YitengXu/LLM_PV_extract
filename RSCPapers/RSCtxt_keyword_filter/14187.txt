    , Accepted 13th June 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractIn this work, photovoltachromic cells (PVCCs) are fabricated using a solvent-free polyethylene glycol (PEG)–titanium hybrid polymer electrolyte. With appropriate addition of 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in the electrolyte, the range of tunable colored-state transmittance of the PVCC is enlarged due to an improved fill factor. A transmittance modulation larger than 40% can be maintained for at least 3 months, demonstrating the good long-term stability of PVCCs fabricated using the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte.
Self-powered smart windows which combine solar cells and electrochromic (EC) cells have attracted a lot of attention.1,2 The transmittance of the EC layer in smart windows can be modulated by the intensity of sunlight irradiation. Self-powered smart windows can thus improve energy saving efficiency and indoor comfort.3–5 Photoelectrochromic cells (PECCs), which integrate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and EC cells, were first demonstrated by Bechinger et al. in 1996.5 To fabricate a PECC, the two electrodes of a dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) film and a WO3 EC film are sandwiched together with a Li-ion containing I−/I3− redox electrolyte solution. The coloration of the cell is induced by illumination without external power sources. The photochromic characteristic is achieved by light–electricity conversion and coloration in the photovoltaic film and the electrochromic film, respectively. However, photovoltaic characteristics of PECCs are not reported.5–8
We have previously reported a photovoltachromic cell (PVCC)9 composed of a patterned WO3–Pt electrochromic electrode and a dye-sensitized TiO2 NP photoanode to demonstrate a solar cell with chromic behavior. In addition to the bleaching mode that operates at short circuit when there is no light, as in a PECC, a PVCC can be bleached very fast under illumination by simply opening the cell terminals. Moreover, a PVCC generates electrical energy as a photovoltaic system, allowing its transmittance to be tuned by controlling the energy fluxes via the resistance of a load in series with the cell. These functions are realized by a patterned WO3–Pt electrode, which provides photovoltaic potential for controlling the charge/discharge of Li ions and a catalytic path for electron transfer.
Adopting the conventional fabrication methods for DSSCs, EC cells, and PECCs, the reported PVCCs were assembled with liquid electrolyte solutions.9,10 However, the issues associated with using a liquid electrolyte, such as leakage and volatilization of organic solvents, limit the long-term stability of PVCCs. Alternatives to liquid electrolytes, including the ormosilane network,11 gelled ionic liquid electrolyte,12 and solvent-free polymer electrolyte,13 have been developed for PECCs with the WO3 electrochromic electrode. Among them, the solvent-free polymer electrolyte shall be the most adequate one. Several polymers can interact with cations to bring about the separation of the cations and anions of salt. A solvent-free polymer electrolyte can thus be obtained by dissolving a salt in a polymer matrix without the assistance of a volatile solvent. Without the issue of volatilization, the ionic conductivity of the solvent-free electrolyte will be stable for a long time. Polyethylene oxide (PEO)/polyethylene glycol (PEG), whose ether oxygen atoms can interact with Li ions in the presence of LiI to form solid complexes, has been studied for its potential application as a cationic (Li+) and an anionic (I−/I3−) conducting electrolyte in EC cells14,15 and PECCs.13 Moreover, the solvent-free PEG–Ti complex matrix has been prepared by the addition of titanium isopropoxide.16 The electrical conductivity of the PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte is insensitive to humidity, suggesting good ambient stability of the PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte.
The tunable multi-level transmittance in the colored state, which is not possible to be achieved in PECCs, is the most important aspect to evaluate PVCCs and is determined by the photovoltaic properties of the cell.9 Therefore, the selection of a polymer electrolyte for high-performance PVCCs is more critical than that for PECCs. In this work, PVCCs were fabricated using the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte to improve their stability. The effects of electrolyte composition on PVCC performance were investigated. With appropriate addition of 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), the range of tunable colored-state transmittance of the polymer-electrolyte PVCC is enlarged due to an improvement in the fill factor (FF). The long-term stability of the optimized PVCC is also demonstrated in this work.
A schematic of the PVCC with the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte is shown in Fig. 1. The TiO2 NP and patterned WO3–Pt electrodes were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using the screen printing technique. N719 dye was employed to sensitize the TiO2 NP anode. To prepare the solvent-free polymer electrolyte, PEG and titanium tert-isopropoxide were dissolved in 2-propanol followed by hydrolysis and condensation.14 LiI, I2, and DMPII were added into the PEG–Ti hybrid system to form the solvent-free polymer electrolyte. The solvent-free polymer electrolyte without DMPII and those with 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mM DMPII are denoted as E1, E2, E3, and E4 electrolytes, respectively. Details of the fabrication of PVCCs with the liquid electrolyte and solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolytes are given in the ESI.†

The polymer-electrolyte PVCC fabricated using the E1 electrolyte, which is composed of LiI and I2 in the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid matrix, is denoted as PVCC-E1. Details of the measurements of the photovoltaic and photovoltachromic properties of the PVCC cells are described in a previous study.9 The photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) curve of PVCC-E1 is displayed in Fig. 2(a). The photovoltaic properties of the cell are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The concave-up J–V curve and low FF show that PVCC-E1 has rather poor photovoltaic performance. The PVCC performance of the cell was further examined. The changes in transmittance of PVCC-E1 in colored/bleached states were measured in two operation modes: (I) at short circuit, achieved by turning the light on/off and (II) under illumination by shorting/opening the circuit. The transmittance of coloration–bleaching cycles for the short-circuited PVCC on exposure to chopped white light (operation mode I) was monitored at a wavelength of 788 nm. As shown in Fig. 2(b), for PVCC-E1, the transmittance modulation was 45% and the coloration time (Tc, with light on) and bleaching time (Tb, with light off) were about 7 and 151 s, respectively. The change in transmittance during open/short cycles at a wavelength of 788 nm of the illuminated PVCC-E1 (operation mode II) is shown in Fig. 2(c). The transmittance modulation, Tc (cell terminals short-circuited), and Tb (cell terminals open-circuited) were 48%, 6 s, and 17 s, respectively.

Changes in transmittance of PVCC-E1 measured at 788 nm when (b) exposed to chopped white light under short circuit conditions (operation mode I) and (c) subjected to open/short cycles under illumination (operation mode II). (d) Transient optical transmittance at 788 nm of PVCC-E1 in series with a variable resistor under illumination. 
The changes in optical transmittance of the illuminated PVCC-E1 in series with a variable resistor are shown in Fig. 2(d). The colored-state transmittance of PVCC-E1 under constant illumination is adjustable from 7% to 35%, with the series resistance R increasing to as large as 800 Ω. This tunable transmittance range (28%) of colored-state PVCC-E1 is inferior to that (37%) of the liquid-electrolyte PVCC (PVCC-EL) obtained by adjusting R to 600 Ω.9 It can be attributed to the poor photovoltaic performance of PVCC-E1 (as shown in Fig. 2(a)), which will be discussed later. Although the transmittance modulation of PVCC-E1 is acceptable (Fig. 2(b and c)), the tunable transmittance range of colored-state PVCC-E1 (Fig. 2(d)), which is the most important aspect to evaluate the performance of the PVCC, is quite limited and needs to be improved.
DMPII was added to the solvent-free PEG–Ti electrolyte to improve the conductivity of the electrolyte and therefore the photovoltaic properties of the polymer-electrolyte PVCC.16Fig. 3(a) shows the influence of DMPII concentration on the photovoltaic performance of the PVCCs with the solvent-free PEG–Ti electrolyte. The photovoltaic properties of the cells are also listed in Table S1 (ESI†). S-shape J–V curves were obtained for PVCC-E2 and PVCC-E3 whereas the J–V curve of PVCC-E4 is concave-down. With the addition of DMPII in the polymer electrolytes, the shunt and series resistances of the cells were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, which were not achievable by increasing the concentration of LiI (ESI†). The FF and thus the efficiency of the PVCCs increased with the concentration of DMPII in the solvent-free PEG–Ti electrolyte.

The PVCC performance of PVCC-E4 (with the optimized J–V characteristic) was further evaluated. Fig. 3(b) shows the change in transmittance of PVCC-E4 monitored with operation mode I. A transmittance modulation of 46.4% was obtained for PVCC-E4 with Tc and Tb values of about 8 and 81 s, respectively. When PVCC-E4 was bleached/colored in operation mode II (see Fig. 3(c)), the transmittance modulation, Tc, and Tb were 48.2%, 8 s, and 6 s, respectively. The results indicate that the Tb values in operation modes I and II for PVCC-E4 are significantly lower than the corresponding values for PVCC-E1. Fig. 3(d) shows the transient optical transmittance at 788 nm of PVCC-E4 in series with a variable resistor under illumination. PVCC-E4 exhibits a colored-state transmittance that is tunable from 7% to 45% as R increases from 0 to 800 Ω. The tunable transmittance range of colored-state PVCC-E4 (38%) is higher than that of PVCC-E1 (28%) due to the improvement in FF.
To illustrate the influence of FF on the range of tunable colored-state transmittance in PVCCs, the J–V curves of PVCC-E1 (low FF), PVCC-E4 (high FF), and the resistor with various resistances (R) are shown in Fig. 4. When driving a load R, the operating voltages of PVCC-E4 are always higher than those of PVCC-E1. The difference in the operating voltages of the two PVCCs becomes increasingly significant with increasing load R. In terms of operating voltage, PVCC-E4 is more sensitive to the load R. Therefore, the range of colored-state transmittance of a PVCC can be enlarged by improving the FF of the cell.

Fig. 5 shows the stability of PVCC-E4 under illumination for 200 open/short cycles. It reveals that the coloration–bleaching response in the last 5 cycles is very similar to that in the first 5 cycles. The transmittances in the bleached states are almost identical for the 200 cycles and those in the colored state slightly increase (∼2%) in the last 5 cycles, demonstrating the very good stability of the PVCC-E4 cell.

Fig. 6(a and b) show the long-term changes in transmittance of PVCC-E4 measured at 788 nm with operation modes I and II, respectively. Fig. 6(a) shows that the transmittances of the as-prepared PVCC-E4 operated in mode I were 60.7% and 10.8% in the bleached and colored states, respectively. The transmittance of the cell in the bleached state remained at ∼60% during the 91 day long-term stability test. The transmittance of the cell in the colored state increased to 19.1% after the 91 day long-term stability test. Furthermore, the transmittances of the as-prepared PVCC-E4 operated in mode II were 55.9% and 11.8% in the bleached and colored states, respectively. The transmittance of the cell in the bleached state increased to ∼60% on day 2 and remained at ∼60% from day 10 to day 91. The transmittance of the cell in the colored state increased from ∼10% to ∼18% on day 20 and remained at this value until day 91.

The transmittance modulations of PVCC-E4 measured at 788 nm in the two operation modes are shown in Fig. 6(c and d), respectively. For comparison, the transmittance modulations of PVCC-EL are also shown. The transmittance modulation of PVCC-E4 decreased by only ∼10% after the 91 day long-term stability test. A transmittance modulation larger than 40% was obtained on day 91. However, the transmittance modulation significantly decreased from 40% to 15% for PVCC-EL after a 26 day long-term stability test, as shown in Fig. 6(c and d). The results demonstrate that the long-term stability of the PVCC is considerably improved by using the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte.
Conclusions
In this work, PVCCs were fabricated using the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte. The effects of DMPII concentration in the solvent-free polymer electrolyte on the PVCC performance were investigated. In the absence of DMPII, the tunable colored-state transmittance range of the illuminated polymer-electrolyte PVCC in series with a variable resistor was 28%, which is inferior to that of the liquid-electrolyte PVCC. With appropriate addition of DMPII, the range of tunable colored-state transmittance of the polymer-electrolyte PVCC increased to 38% due to an improvement in FF. Under illumination by shorting/opening the circuit, the transmittance modulation, Tc, and Tb were 48.2%, 8 s, and 6 s, respectively, for the optimized polymer-electrolyte PVCC. The long-term stability of the optimized PVCC was also investigated. A ∼10% decrease in the transmittance modulation was observed in the polymer-electrolyte PVCC after the 91 day long-term stability test. A transmittance modulation larger than 40% was still maintained on day 91, demonstrating the good long-term stability of the PVCC with the solvent-free PEG–Ti hybrid electrolyte.
