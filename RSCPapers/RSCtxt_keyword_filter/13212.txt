    , Accepted 26th March 2012First published on 26th March 2012AbstractMulti-functional mesoporous TiO2 (M-TiO2) beads with high porosity and good interconnectivity in the anatase phase were synthesized via a solvothermal reaction at low temperature (100 °C) using a graft copolymer, i.e., poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM), as a structure-directing agent. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the TiO2 beads consisted of 13 nm interconnected nanocrystallites and were monodisperse with tunable sizes of approximately 120, 250, 500 and 750 nm. The photoelectrodes fabricated with M-TiO2 beads showed a high surface area (86.5 m2 g−1) and a stronger light scattering effect, as confirmed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The structures of M-TiO2 beads effectively offered better pore infiltration of the polymer electrolyte. Furthermore, the improved interconnectivity of M-TiO2 beads improved the electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime, resulting in an improvement in the light harvesting efficiency. Thus, quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with M-TiO2 beads showed a higher efficiency (4.8% at 100 mW cm−2) than those with conventional P25 (3.8%). A structure–property relation among M-TiO2 beads was investigated in terms of surface area and light scattering. Upon utilizing double layer structures and a solid polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), the efficiency was increased up to 6.7% at 100 mW cm−2, one of the highest values for all-solid-state DSSCs.
Introduction
As global warming has intensified, more attention has been placed on sustainable and renewable energy sources such as solar cells. Since the announcement of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991, DSSCs have received significant attention as promising next generation solar devices due to their high photoconversion efficiency, low cost, and facile fabrication process.1,2 Much of the current research has focused on increasing cell performance, which can be achieved by developing a novel dye,3,4 a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer,5,6 a thermal-resistance transparent conducting oxide (TCO),7 an electrolyte8–10 or a counter-electrode.11 In particular, the TiO2 layer is a very important element because it can directly affect light harvesting, charge recombination and interfacial contact of the electrode–electrolyte.
A high specific surface area, fast electron transport and large light scattering effect are the desirable properties of photoelectrodes in DSSCs. The DSSC efficiency of photoelectrodes fabricated with commercial TiO2 powder (e.g., P25) is limited due to their small surface area and low connectivity, often resulting in crack formation. One-dimensional (1D) TiO2 compounds such as nanorods,12,13 nanotubes14,15 and nanowires15–17 were investigated as a photoelectrode to enhance electron transport, but their low surface areas restricted photoconversion efficiency. Mesoporous TiO2 beads with a submicrometre-sized diameter and monodispersity are of particular interest because they can simultaneously promote light scattering and dye loading of electrodes, thereby increasing the photon-to-current conversion efficiency.18–27 For example, the Caruso and Cheng group recently reported the synthesis of high efficiency (7.2% at 100 mW cm−2) DSSCs based on mesoporous anatase TiO2 beads with high surface area and a liquid electrolyte.18 However, the synthesis is rather complicated because it is based on two-step reactions utilizing many chemicals, a high temperature of 160 °C for 16 h and the combined sol–gel/solvothermal reaction. Furthermore, there is no report on high efficiency solid-state or quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on mesoporous TiO2 beads, which are more attractive because they are lightweight and offer long-term stability and flexibility in cell design.
Reported herein is the facile synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 (M-TiO2) beads, having a controllable diameter in the range of 120 to 750 nm, via a solvothermal reaction at a lower temperature (100 °C) using poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM) graft copolymer and glucose as a structure-directing agent and a crystal-growth directing agent, respectively. The resulting M-TiO2 beads were characterized in detail using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The quasi-solid-state and all-solid-state DSSCs were fabricated with a low molecular weight (Mw) polymer electrolyte and a solid polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), respectively. The DSSCs were characterized via current–voltage curves, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)/intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC, Mn = 22000 g mol−1), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (POEM, Mn = 475 g mol−1), D-glucose, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, 37 wt%), ethyl cellulose, α-terpineol, fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2, 14 nm), poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME, Mn = 500 g mol−1), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII, C7H13N2I), iodine (I2) and acetonitrile were purchased from Aldrich. Ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719) was purchased from Solaronix. TiO2 powder (P25) was purchased from Degussa. A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (TEC8, 8 ohms sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) was purchased from Pilkington, France.
Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 (M-TiO2) beads
The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer consisting of a poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) side chains was synthesized via atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), according to a previously reported method.28 The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer (0.2 g) and glucose (0.8 g) were dissolved in 36 ml of THF and 4 ml of water, respectively. Then, the glucose solution was slowly added drop-wise into the polymer solution with continuous stirring at 1000 rpm. Subsequently, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 ml of the sol mixture consisting of TTIP and HCl with 2:1 vol ratio was added to the polymer solution to form Beads1, Beads2, Beads3 and Beads4, respectively, and stirred vigorously for 2 h. The suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was cooled naturally in air, dark brown precipitates accumulated at the bottom of the vessel. The precipitates were harvested by centrifugation, followed by washing three times with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol. After being dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight, the samples were calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in order to remove residual organics.
Fabrication of DSSC
The DSSCs with an active area of 0.24 cm2 were constructed by drop-casting the polymer electrolyte solution onto the photoelectrode and covering with the counter-electrode, following a previously reported procedure.28–31 First, the clean conducting surface of the FTO glass was blocked with a layer of titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide by spin-coating, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, the TiO2 pastes were deposited on the blocking layer-coated FTO glass using a doctor-blade technique and successive sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. To prepare a screen-printable viscous TiO2 paste, 0.1 g of the M-TiO2 beads were dispersed in 2 ml of ethanol with an ultrasonic horn for 25 min, followed by stirring for 1 h. Then, 0.5 ml of ethyl cellulose solution (dissolved in ethanol at 10 wt%) and 0.4 g of α-terpineol were added into the TiO2 suspension and stirred at room temperature for 20 min, followed by sonication for 20 min. The paste was concentrated by evaporation of the ethanol at room temperature for a few days. The TiO2 photoelectrodes were sensitized with the 10−4 M ruthenium (N-719) solution in ethanol at 50 °C for 2 h in a dark room. Polymer electrolyte solutions consisting of PEGDME, SiO2, MPII and I2 dissolved in acetonitrile were dropped on the dye-absorbed TiO2 photoelectrodes. The molar ratio of ether oxygen to iodide salt was fixed at 20, and the iodine content was fixed at 10 wt% with respect to the salt. The Pt-coated counter-electrodes were prepared via spin-coating of a 7 mM H2PtCl6 solution in isopropyl alcohol and calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for a day to permit complete evaporation of the solvent and were then sealed with an epoxy resin. Photoelectrochemical performances were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light intensity was homogeneous over an 8 × 8 in2 area, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate no. C-ISE269) for a sunlight intensity of one (100 mW cm−2). Five identical DSSCs were assembled and characterized. The average estimated error of efficiency was ±5%. IMVS/IMPS measurements were carried out on a electrochemical workstation equipped with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated red light emitting diode (635 nm) driven by a source supply, which can provide both DC and AC components of the illumination. The frequency range was set from 10000 Hz to 0.01 Hz. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm (McScience, K3100).
Characterization
The morphology and structure of TiO2 beads were observed using FE-SEM (SUPRA 55VP, Germany, Carl Zeiss) and EF-TEM (LIBRA 120). XRD measurements were carried out on a Rigaku RINT2000 wide-angle goniometer with a Cu cathode operated at 40 kV and 300 mA. The concentration of the absorbed dye and reflectance spectra were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) in the range of 200 to 1100 nm. The specific surface area and pore size diameter were determined from N2 adsorption–desorption measurement via the BET and BJH methods. In advance of these measurements, the TiO2 films were additionally degassed at 70 °C under dynamic vacuum (10−2 Torr) for 1 h.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of M-TiO2 beads
M-TiO2 beads were synthesized using TTIP as a TiO2 precursor via a solvothermal reaction at a low temperature, i.e., 100 °C, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer was introduced as a structure-directing agent because a hydrophilic–hydrophobic microphase-separated structure is critical for controlling organized mesoporous morphology.28 Good miscibility and interactions between TTIP and POEM might allow TTIP to be selectively incorporated into hydrophilic POEM domains where TiO2 crystallites are formed in situ during calcination. The hydrophobic domains including the PVC main chains do not contain TTIP due to their poor affinity and thus generate the bead pores after calcination. A hydrophilic small molecule, i.e., glucose, played the role of a crystal growth-directing agent32 for TiO2 as well as a compatibilizer to improve the interactions between the small TTIP and the highly entangled PVC-g-POEM long chains.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of M-TiO2 beads via a solvothermal reaction. 
The FE-SEM images of submicrometre-sized M-TiO2 beads via a solvothermal reaction at 100 °C are presented in Fig. 1. All the M-TiO2 beads exhibited rough spherical morphology with high porosity and monodispersity. The magnified images revealed that the beads consisted of small-sized TiO2 nanocrystallites and nanopores. The average diameter of the beads was approximately 120 ± 20 nm (Beads1), 250 ± 50 nm (Beads2), 500 ± 100 nm (Beads3) and 750 ± 150 nm (Beads4). The bead size was easily controlled by changing the amounts of Ti precursor, i.e., TTIP, as the average particle diameter increased with increasing TTIP content. This is because the large amount of TTIP increases the concentration of the Ti source in solution, which is thought to promote the growth of TiO2 beads. The submicrometre-sized TiO2 beads can give the film the ability to scatter light, according to the Mie theory.33 The well-interconnected structure with small nanoparticles might suppress electron recombination and increase the electron lifetime. Thus, these effects will provide a synergistic improvement in the light harvesting efficiency and, consequently, in current density. It should be noted that randomly aggregated, small TiO2 nanocrystals without mesopores and interconnectivity were produced when synthesizing without PVC-g-POEM or glucose, as shown in Fig. 1i and j, indicating the importance of both components. The morphology of the M-TiO2 beads was further investigated using TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the M-TiO2 beads consisted of a large number of small TiO2 nanocrystallites which were well packed and interconnected in a manner that is effective for providing good charge transport properties. Small voids existed among the nanocrystallites, which provided bead porosity and increased the internal surface area for dye adsorption. The size of the nanocrystallites was uniform and estimated to be approximately 13 to 14 nm, which was consistent with the FE-SEM and the XRD results.

The phase purity of the M-TiO2 beads before and after calcination at 500 °C was characterized by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. S1.† The XRD pattern indicated that all M-TiO2 beads were in the pure anatase phase. The peaks at 25.6, 38.1, 48.4, 54.5, 55.5, 63.1, 69.7 and 75.5° correspond to the reflections from the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (115), (220), and (215) crystal planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.18,34 Before calcination, all diffraction peaks showed an anatase crystalline phase of approximately 5 to 6 nm in size, calculated from the Scherrer equation using the main diffraction peak (101).34 After calcination at 500 °C, the average crystallite size was increased to approximately 13 to 14 nm, indicating aggregation and growth of crystallites during heat treatment. However, high temperature heat treatment improved the crystallinity of the beads, as evidenced by the increased sharpness of the peaks. Although the crystallite sizes did not show a significant difference according to bead size, Beads1 showed the largest value of 13.6 nm.

The performances of DSSCs were strongly dependent on the amount of dye adsorption, which is related, in turn, to the surface area and porosity of the TiO2 photoelectrode. Thus, the adsorption–desorption curves of the M-TiO2 beads were measured as shown in Fig. S2† and are summarized in Table 1. Specific surface area was calculated from nitrogen isotherms using the BET method, while average pore diameter was determined using the BJH method. Type-IV isotherms with H1-type hysteresis loops at high relative pressures (P/P0 = 0.7–0.9) were observed for all the M-TiO2 beads, indicating the presence of large mesopores (Fig. S2(a)†). Overall, the surface area of the M-TiO2 beads ranged between 75 and 86 m2 g−1, which was almost two times higher than that of P25 (47 m2 g−1). The largest value (86.5 m2 g−1) was obtained for Beads2, with a size of 250 nm, which is comparable to the value (89 m2 g−1) recently reported by Caruso and Cheng.20 The average pore diameters of the M-TiO2 beads were slightly smaller than that of P25 with the exception of Beads4 with a 750 nm size, as estimated using the BJH method. The different surface structures of the TiO2 electrodes resulted in different surface areas, which imparted different levels of dye adsorption. The amount of dye adsorption onto the M-TiO2 beads ranged between 112 and 125 nmol cm−2, which was much larger than that of P25 (74 nmol cm−2). The dye loading of Beads2 was the highest, indicating that its surface area, the highest of the five, permits the greatest level of N719 dye adsorption. Thus, the photoelectrodes fabricated with M-TiO2 beads may generate more photoelectrons and enhance performance in DSSC.

Fabrication of photoelectrodes and their DSSCs performances
The 12 μm thick photoelectrodes of M-TiO2 beads were fabricated via a doctor blade technique using ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol as a binder and additive, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Since DSSC efficiency is also strongly dependent on the light scattering ability of the TiO2 photoelectrode, the UV-visible reflectance spectra of the photoelectrodes fabricated with M-TiO2 beads were measured and compared with P25, as shown in Fig. S3.† The reflectance of the M-TiO2 beads was always much larger than that of P25, indicating effective light scattering ability on beads with sizes of a few hundred nanometres. The reflectance ability of M-TiO2 beads was arranged in the sequence—Beads3 ≅ Beads4 > Beads2 > Beads1—which falls nearly in line with the sequence of bead size. Overall, the TiO2 photoelectrodes derived from large-sized beads showed higher reflectance than those from small-sized beads. However, there was little difference between Beads3 (500 nm) and Beads4 (750 nm), implying the presence of a critical size for light scattering. The Beads3 film showed a photonic reflectance value higher than 60% in the range of 400–800 nm, which provided a basis for the effective use of long wavelength photonic energy. Thus, M-TiO2 beads could extend the photo-response of the photoelectrode well into the visible spectrum, resulting in an enhancement of the light utilization efficiency. An abrupt diffused reflectance edge at 410 nm was observed for all samples and is attributed to light absorption by the band transition of TiO2.35 This reflectance result clearly shows the function of M-TiO2 beads as a light scattering layer in the visible light regions, which is also consistent with the next IPCE result.

IPCE is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the external circuit produced by an incident photon at a given wavelength. Hence, a light scattering effect can be evaluated by measuring the IPCE spectra of the TiO2 photoelectrodes. The IPCE values of the DSSCs fabricated with M-TiO2 beads and P25 are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of illumination wavelength. The DSSCs with M-TiO2 beads exhibited higher IPCE values than that with P25 over the whole spectral range. Generally, the maximum IPCE value increased with an increase in bead size, i.e., Beads3 ≅ Beads4 > Beads2 > Beads1, which is consistent with the reflectance results. Despite a relatively lower surface area, the DSSC consisting of Beads4 showed a higher IPCE value than that of Beads2 due to strong light scattering properties. In order to evaluate the size dependency of the light scattering effect, the normalized IPCE data were also plotted in Fig. 4(b). The photoelectrodes based on M-TiO2 beads markedly enhanced the IPCE values at the longer wavelength region of 550–700 nm, resulting from the strong scattering effect of the beads over the visible range.
The photoelectrodes fabricated with M-TiO2 beads possess secondary pores between beads and impart an effectiveness for pore-infiltration of the polymer electrolyte with a large volume.36 Thus, quasi-solid-state DSSCs employing a PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2 polymer electrolyte were fabricated with M-TiO2 beads, and their photocurrent–voltage curves were measured at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5. The detailed photovoltaic properties including a short-circuit current density (Jsc), an open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and an overall energy conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. The DSSCs fabricated with M-TiO2 beads displayed a higher photocurrent density than that that with P25 due to a larger amount of dye loading due to the larger surface area and the strong scattering property resulting from a large bead size. Although there was a slight difference among the different M-TiO2 beads, Beads3 showed the highest efficiency, reaching 4.8% at 100 mW cm−2, which is consistent with the IPCE results. The relatively lower efficiency (4.3%) of Beads1 arises from a smaller surface area and lower light scattering effect. Interestingly, the Voc values (0.75–0.76 V) of M-TiO2 beads were always greater than that of P25 (0.73 V). In general, the increase in dye loading leads to an increase in charge recombination between the injected electrons and the tri-iodides, which often limits the Voc value. However, the formation of M-TiO2 beads with good interconnectivity might compensate for this negative effect, minimizing interfacial charge recombination losses.

The dynamics of charge transport and charge recombination of the device were investigated in detail using IMPS/IMVS techniques,37 as shown in Fig. S4.† A diode laser with variable power and modulation control was used as a light source for these studies. Because the DSSCs with M-TiO2 beads had enhanced photoconversion efficiency at long wavelengths (as confirmed by IPCE and reflectance), the light source at 635 nm was used to confirm the scattering effect. The time delay from the IMPS measurement corresponds to the transport time of the injected electrons through the TiO2 photoelectrode. The electron lifetime (τr) was calculated from the expression τr = 1/2π frmin, where frmin is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component.38 The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) was determined from the equation Dn = d2/(2.35τd), where d is the thickness of the photoelectrode. The τr values of the DSSCs always decreased with current density, which is related to light intensity. Electron trapping–detrapping involves shallower levels at higher light intensities; thus, electron transport becomes faster.39
The M-TiO2 beads showed a greater electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime than the P25 film, indicating a lower charge recombination of electrons in the former. In the P25 photoelectrode, there were many large pores formed from the use of the binder during film preparation, resulting in less interconnectivity between particles. Therefore, electrons in the P25 photoelectrode travel through a longer path to the conducting substrate, resulting in a lower diffusion coefficient. However, the TiO2 nanocrystals in the M-TiO2 beads and photoelectrodes are well interconnected within the beads due to a close packing of grains, resulting in good electron transport. The Dn values increased with the size of the M-TiO2 beads (Fig. S4(b)).† The effective electron diffusion length (Ln) can be obtained from Dn and τr using the relationship Ln = (Dnτr)1/2.13 As shown in Fig. S4(c),† the M-TiO2 beads exhibited higher values than P25, demonstrating that the M-TiO2 bead films can be much thicker than the P25 film for a given recombination loss. The highest values of τr, Ln and Dn were obtained for Beads4, which had the largest size and good interconnectivity, leading to improved charge transport and charge recombination abilities. Therefore, Beads4 showed higher Jsc and Voc values, leading to larger IPCE and conversion efficiency, despite a lower dye loading due to a smaller surface area.
The M-TiO2 beads were also utilized to form a 7 μm thick scattering layer on top of a transparent, 7 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film (total TiO2 thickness ≈ 15 μm). The photocurrent–voltage curves of all-solid-state and quasi-solid-state DSSCs with double layers structures were measured at 100 mW cm−2 and presented in Fig. 6 and their performances are summarized in Table 3. A polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) of poly((1-(4-ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII, Mw = 15000 g mol−1) was employed as a solid electrolyte for the solid-state DSSC in which the incorporation of I2 as an initial component of electrolyte was not necessary.40 Upon introduction of double layers, a solar cell conversion efficiency was increased up to 5.7 from 4.8% for quasi-solid-state DSSCs with PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2 electrolyte. The efficiency increase is mostly due to the enhanced Jsc value, resulting from increased dye adsorption and light scattering effect. However, the higher thickness of the TiO2 film may cause polymer electrolytes not to penetrate into the pores of photoelectrodes sufficiently, which increases the resistance of the cell and thus has a negative effect on FF, which reduced from approximately 0.60 to 0.53. Interestingly, the efficiency of solid-state DSSC with PEBII reached 6.7% at 100 mW cm−2, which is larger than that of quasi-solid-state DSSCs and one of the highest values for solid-state DSSCs.8–10,28–31 The higher efficiency of PEBII-based DSSC is attributed to higher ionic concentration, well-organized structure and lower glass transition temperature (Tg) of PEBII.40

Conclusions
The graft copolymer-directed solvothermal reaction has been introduced to synthesize multi-functional M-TiO2 beads in the anatase phase, possessing a high porosity as well as good interconnectivity, as confirmed by FE-SEM, EF-TEM and XRD analyses. In particular, four different types of TiO2 photoelectrodes (i.e., Beads1 with 120 nm, Beads2 with 250 nm, Beads3 with 500 nm and Beads4 with 750 nm) were prepared, and their properties were compared systematically with P25-based photoelectrodes. The DSSC fabricated with the Beads3 and the PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2 polymer electrolyte exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 4.8% at 100 mW cm−2 as a result of simultaneous increases in Jsc and Voc values, which was greater than that achieved with the P25 (3.8%). The improved performance of M-TiO2 beads resulted from their large specific surface area (∼86.5 m2 g−1), greater light scattering effect (60% in the 400–800 nm range) and improved charge transport, as confirmed by BET, IPCE, reflectance and IMPS/IMVS analysis. High efficiency (6.7% at 100 mW cm−2) was obtained by utilizing double layer structures and a solid PIL (PEBII) as a photoelectrode and an electrolyte, respectively, which is one of the highest values for solid-state DSSCs.
