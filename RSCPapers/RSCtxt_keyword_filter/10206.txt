    , Accepted 9th January 2019First published on 9th January 2019AbstractIncorporating n-type fullerene derivatives into the perovskite layer affording bulk heterojunction (BHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is an effective strategy to passivate trap states, consequently reducing the current–voltage hysteresis and improving the device performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative (C60-PyP) via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, and the unambiguous determination of its molecular structure by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Upon incorporating C60-PyP as an additive with an optimized doping ratio of 0.13 wt% into the CH3NH3Pbl3 (MAPbI3) perovskite precursor, the regular-structure bulk heterojunction PSC devices exhibit a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.82%, which is dramatically enhanced relative to that of the control devices (17.61%). The C60-PyP additive provides heterogeneous nucleation sites, leading to the decrease of the nucleation Gibbs free energy and consequently enlarged grain size and improved crystallization of the MAPbI3 perovskite film. Besides, incorporation of C60-PyP results in enhanced crystalline orientation as confirmed by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. Meanwhile, the coordination interaction between the N atom of the pyridine moiety within C60-PyP and the Pb2+ ion within MAPbl3 leads to the passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer, jointly contributing to the improved device performance and markedly suppressed current–voltage hysteresis. Moreover, the ambient stability of the devices is improved upon C60-PyP incorporation due to the hydrophobic nature of the C60-PyP molecule, which presumably resides at the grain boundaries.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic devices due to the superior properties of perovskite materials including large absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility, long carrier recombination lifetime, adjustable bandgaps, etc.1–6 Recently, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% has been achieved.7 Among the factors determining the device performance, the film quality of the perovskite absorber layer is one of the most determinative ones. Additive engineering via incorporating exotic additives such as small molecules,8–11 polymers,12,13 and fullerene derivatives14–17 into the perovskite layer has been proved to be effective in improving the quality of the perovskite film via crystallization control and/or defect passivation. In particular, incorporating n-type fullerene derivatives into the perovskite layer affording bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs is an effective strategy to passivate trap states, and fullerene derivatives represent an intriguing type of additive with multiple functions, including (1) facilitating electron extraction and transfer due to their strong electron-accepting ability; (2) passivating the trap states via the interaction of the fullerene cage with Pb–I antisite defects; (3) acting as heterogeneous nucleation sites to tune the grain quality of the perovskite, which jointly contribute to improved PCE and stability.14–21 [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is the first fullerene derivative which was incorporated into the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) precursor solution, and PCBM was observed to be located homogeneously at the perovskite grain boundaries (GBs), passivating the Pb–I antisite defects, resulting in a decent PCE of 14.4% with suppressed current–voltage hysteresis.14 A fluoroalkyl-substituted fullerene derivative (DF-C60) was recently synthesized and incorporated into the MAPbI3 layer to form a DF-C60/perovskite heterojunction in PSCs, yielding an impressive PCE of 18.11% relative to that of the control device (15.67%).15 Very recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized fullerene derivatives were incorporated into the MAPbI3 precursor, yielding a best PCE of 16.41% with a reduced hysteresis index and improved ambient stability.16 Note that, among them only a few fullerene derivatives such as DF-C60 as additives were reported to achieve higher PCEs (18.11%) than that based on the PCBM additive (14.4%). Besides, the functional groups grafted onto the fullerene cage are limited to fluoroalkyl, ester, polyethylene glycol and so on,14–16 which exhibit relatively weak interactions with the perovskite layer. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop novel fullerene additives bearing other functional groups, which enable reinforced interactions with the perovskite layer.
Herein, we synthesized a novel pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative (abbreviated as C60-PyP) and applied it as an exceptional additive affording coordination interactions with MAPbI3via the pyridine moiety, resulting in dramatically improved PCE of the bulk heterojunction PSC device with suppressed current–voltage hysteresis. C60-PyP was synthesized via a facile 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, and its molecular structure is unambiguously confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction. The effects of C60-PyP additive on the crystallization, grain orientation and trap states of the perovskite film are investigated systematically, revealing that improved crystallinity and enlarged grain size as well as coordination interactions between C60-PyP and Pb2+ contribute to the improved PCE.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization of the pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative (C60-PyP)
Very recently, by applying several fullerene derivatives bearing pyridine moieties as electron transport layers (ETLs) of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs, we found that the grafted pyridine moiety fulfilled the coordination interactions with the Pb2+ ion of MAPbI3 perovskite whereas no such coordination interaction was observed for the PCBM ETL, leading to the enhanced device performance relative to that based on the PCBM ETL.22 Stimulated by the peculiarity of the pyridine moiety, in this work we manage preferably to design and synthesize another novel pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative (C60-PyP) in which the pyridine moiety is grafted in a different manner. C60-PyP was synthesized via a facile 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of C60 with an excess amount of N-(4-chlorophenyl)picolinohydrazonoyl chloride (ca. 2-fold) and a few drops of triethylamine in chlorobenzene solution at 80 °C (see Scheme 1). The detailed synthetic procedure is described in the Experimental section. The solubilities of C60-PyP in chlorobenzene and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) are about 6 mg mL−1 and 4 mg mL−1, respectively.

The chemical structure of C60-PyP was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. According to the 1H NMR spectroscopic result, the proton signals of phenyl, pyrazole and pyridine groups within C60-PyP are observed in the range of 7.32–8.51 ppm (see ESI Fig. S1†). The 13C NMR spectrum of C60-PyP shows clearly the sp2-carbon signals of the C60 cage in the range of 135.64–151.76 ppm. Besides, the sp2-carbon signals of the pyridine ring overlap with those of the sp2-carbon of the C60 cage. The sp2-carbon signals of the chlorobenzyl moiety are in the range of 124.94–135.63 ppm. Especially, the lone pair of nitrogen in the pyrazole ring of C60-PyP is located at the benzene ring containing addition sites,23 resulting in the shift of the carbon signals of addition sites to low field at 123.31 and 123.36 ppm (see ESI Fig. S2†). The mono-adduct nature of C60-PyP is confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, showing the dominant ionic peak at m/z = 949, which is coincident with the molecular weight of the mono-adduct (ESI, Fig. S3†).
Furthermore, the molecular structure of C60-PyP is unambiguously determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Fig. 1a shows the X-ray single crystal structure of C60-PyP, unveiling that the addition reaction occurs at a [6,6]-bond junction with the bond length of 1.60 Å for C1–C2, which keeps closed. In the pyrazole ring grafted onto the fullerene cage, the bond length of C1–N2 is 1.501 Å, which is much larger than that of C3–N1 (1.279 Å), indicating the double bond character of C3–N1. In addition, the bond lengths of C2–C3 and N1–N2 are 1.538 Å and 1.366 Å, respectively, falling in the range of single bonds. Interestingly, the packing structure of C60-PyP shows that the fullerene cage is prone to form an ordered pathway (Fig. 1b), which is expected to facilitate electron transport along such a pathway.

The molecular energy level of the fullerene derivative is determinative for charge transport and thus is an important parameter for its applicability in the PSC device. The energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) of C60-PyP is estimated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2a) to be −3.89 eV according to the onset reduction potential of C60-PyP at −0.91 V vs. Fc/Fc+. In order to obtain the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) of C60-PyP, the optical bandgap of C60-PyP (Eg,opt = 1.72 eV) is estimated according to the absorption onset (723 nm) of the UV-vis spectrum (Fig. 2b), and the EHOMO is calculated to be −5.61 eV based on the equation EHOMO = ELUMO − Eg,opt.22,24 Both the ELUMO and EHOMO values of C60-PyP are quite comparable to those of PCBM and other C60 derivatives bearing pyridine moieties we reported very recently (see ESI Table S1†), revealing that the molecular energy level of the fullerene derivative is dominatingly determined by the fullerene core.22 Besides, the LUMO energy level of C60-PyP is close to the conduction band of MAPbI3 perovskite (Fig. 2c), fulfilling the prerequisite for charge transport from the perovskite to C60-PyP.

The thermal stability of C60-PyP was evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (see ESI Fig. S4†). The TGA curve of C60-PyP shows three weight-loss processes as follows. The first weight-loss step is assigned to the removal of solvent molecules remaining in the C60-PyP crystal lattice (2.93%, 198.5–266.4 °C). The second weight-loss step (266.4–456.7 °C) with 11.49% weight loss is assigned to the detaching of the addend groups (pyridine, phenyl and pyrazole ring). The third weight-loss process starting from 456.7 °C is attributed to the decomposition of the C60 cage within C60-PyP. The detaching temperature of the functional group at 266.4 °C indicates the excellent thermal stability of C60-PyP, and this enables the tolerance of C60-PyP to the thermal annealing process generally required for PSC device fabrication.
Photovoltaic performance of PSC devices using C60-PyP as the additive
To evaluate the function of C60-PyP as an additive doped in MAPbI3, we fabricated regular-structure (n–i–p) planar heterojunction PSC devices with the structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI3 + C60-PyP/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 2d). C60-PyP was dissolved in DMF and was doped into the perovskite precursor solution with different doping ratios (0.05 wt%, 0.13 wt%, 0.25 wt% and 1.0 wt%) to determine the optimized additive concentration. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSC devices with and without C60-PyP additive obtained under 1 sun illumination are compared in Fig. 3a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh) are summarized in Table 1. The control device without C60-PyP shows an average PCE of 17.04% with a Voc of 1.083 V, a Jsc of 20.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.24%. After incorporating C60-PyP additive with a relatively low doping ratio (0.05–0.25 wt%), the device performance of PSCs is enhanced obviously, and the optimized doping ratio is determined to be 0.13 wt%, under which an average PCE of 19.04%, calculated from a Voc of 1.090 V, a Jsc of 22.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 78.26%, is obtained. The champion device exhibits a PCE of 19.82%, which is enhanced by ∼12% relative to that of the control device. Upon increasing the C60-PyP doping ratio to 1.0 wt%, however, the device performance decreases obviously, which is even lower than that of the control device. The variation tendency of PCE as well as other photovoltaic parameters is confirmed further by comparing the statistical photovoltaic data obtained for 15 independent devices (see ESI Fig. S6 and S7† for the histograms and box plots of the photovoltaic parameters).

Among the three photovoltaic parameters, the PCE enhancement upon C60-PyP incorporation primarily originates from the increase of Jsc (from 20.9 to 22.3 mA cm−2, ∼6.7% enhancement), whereas the enhancement ratios of both FF (from 75.24% to 78.26%, ∼4.0% enhancement) and Voc (from 1.083 to 1.090 V, ∼0.6% enhancement) are much smaller. The increase of Jsc is verified by comparing the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the devices with and without C60-PyP additive as shown in Fig. 3b. The perovskite device with 0.13 wt% C60-PyP additive shows a higher EQE response in the region of 620–780 nm compared to that of the control device, indicating more effective photon utilization, as evidenced from the enhanced integrated Jsc.
The current–voltage hysteresis is further examined by measuring the J–V curves in different scan directions (Fig. 3c and d). The control device suffers from a severe hysteresis with a hysteresis index of 20.3%, while the 0.13 wt% C60-PyP-doped device exhibits negligible hysteresis with a hysteresis index of 0.53% (see ESI Table S2†). We further verify this result by measuring the J–V curves at different scan rates, revealing that the control device without C60-PyP suffers from considerable variations whereas the fluctuation for the 0.13 wt% C60-PyP-doped device is much smaller (see ESI Fig. S8†).
Effect of C60-PyP on the morphology and crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film
In order to elucidate the correlation between the MAPbI3 film quality and the photovoltaic properties of the PSC device, we carried out morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The control perovskite film shows a compact morphology with a relatively small grain size of ca. 300 nm. Interestingly, when 0.13 wt% C60-PyP was incorporated, the average perovskite grain size increases obviously up to 600 nm, which however decreases to 450 nm after incorporating 1.0 wt% C60-PyP additive (see Fig. 4a–c and ESI Fig. S9† for grain size distribution). Interestingly, when the C60-PyP doping ratio increases to 1.0 wt%, some exotic particles appear, which aggregate mostly along the grain boundaries (Fig. 4c). This phenomenon is similar to the case of incorporating the PCBM additive into the MAPbI3 film,14 and the exotic particles are presumably assigned to the aggregate of C60-PyP molecules. Nevertheless, the amount of C60-PyP additive incorporated into the MAPbI3 film has little influence on the thickness of the MAPbI3 film (ca. 300 nm, Fig. 4d–f). On the other hand, the roughness of the perovskite film is sensitively affected by the amount of C60-PyP additive, and increase of the C60-PyP doping ratio results in the dramatic increase of the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the MAPbI3 perovskite film from 12.64 nm to 23.19 nm (Fig. 4g–i). This result confirms that incorporation of excess C60-PyP additive facilitates its aggregation.

The effect of C60-PyP additive on the crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite was then studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 5a compares the XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 perovskite film without and with C60-PyP addition, revealing that all perovskite films exhibit the same tetragonal phase of MAPbI3, and the two intense diffraction peaks at 14.1° and 28.5° assigned respectively to (110) and (220) lattice planes30,31 exhibit no obvious shift after C60-PyP addition. This indicates that C60-PyP does not participate in the formation of the MAPbI3 crystal lattice. Interestingly, after incorporation of 0.13 wt% C60-PyP additive, the intensities of the (110) and (220) diffraction peaks increase obviously, suggesting the improvement of the crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite. Nevertheless, incorporation of 1.0 wt% C60-PyP results in the decrease of the intensities of the (110) and (220) diffraction peaks, indicating that the existence of excess C60-PyP additive deteriorates the crystallization of MAPbI3 perovskite.

(c) Azimuthal scan profiles for the (110) plane of the perovskite film with different C60-PyP doping ratios. (d) Pb 4f XPS spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite films without and with 1.0 wt% C60-PyP doping. The asterisks denote the signals of Pb metal due to the photoinduced degradation of the perovskite in a vacuum.33 
The crystallinity changes of the perovskite film intrigue us to investigate whether C60-PyP incorporation would affect the crystalline orientation of the perovskite. Fig. 5b shows the synchrotron-based 2D-grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of the MAPbI3 perovskite films without and with C60-PyP doping, in which the scattered rings at q ≈ 10, 20, and 22.2 nm−1 correspond to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite crystal, respectively.32 The perovskite film with C60-PyP additive shows discrete Bragg spots along the Debye–Scherrer ring for the (110) plane compared to the control film without C60-PyP, suggesting a more ordered arrangement of the 3D crystal grains. The azimuthal scan profiles for the (110) plane obtained from the 2D-GIXRD patterns are shown in Fig. 5c, and the reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak at 90° for the perovskite film with 0.13 wt% C60-PyP suggests a preferential out-of-plane orientation for the (10) plane in the perovskite. This result is consistent with the crystallinity change discussed above.
Based on the above results, we propose a plausible interpretation for the effects of C60-PyP on the crystallinity and morphology of the MAPbI3 film. The pristine MAPbI3 perovskite generally exhibits a homogeneous nucleation manner, followed by growth of the perovskite seed crystal (Fig. 6a).17 After incorporating C60-PyP into the perovskite precursor, C60-PyP may serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for perovskite crystallization as shown in Fig. 6b, and this provides a much lower nucleation barrier than the homogeneous nucleation manner due to the decreased Gibbs free energy, facilitating the growth of larger perovskite crystalline grains.17,34,35 In this sense, addition of excess C60-PyP (1.0 wt%) results in the existence of excessive nucleation sites, and this is unfavorable for the crystallization of the perovskite, consequently leading to decreased crystallinity and grain size.

Interaction of C60-PyP with MAPbI3
Given that the Pb2+ ion has strong coordination ability with Lewis bases due to its 6p empty electron orbitals,36 it is intriguing to investigate whether the incorporated C60-PyP can interact with MAPbI3. We carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) characterization to monitor the change of the binding energy of the Pb2+ ion within MAPbI3 after incorporating C60-PyP additive. According to the comparison of the high-resolution Pb 4f XPS spectra of the pristine MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 + C60-PyP (1.0 wt%) films (Fig. 5d), the characteristic Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 signals at 143.38 and 138.52 eV (ref. 37 and 38) detected for the pristine MAPbI3 shift obviously towards the lower core-level binding energies of 143.20 and 138.35 eV respectively after C60-PyP incorporation. This result suggests the decrease of cationic charge of Pb2+ ions within MAPbI3, which is due likely to the donation of the lone electron pair on the N atom of the pyridine moiety within C60-PyP to the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+via coordination bonding.22,35 Notably, the metallic Pb signal at 136.0 eV and 141.3 eV in the perovskite film disappeared after incorporation of C60-PyP,39,40 which is due to the reduction of iodine vacancy defects induced by the bonding effect between C60-PyP and uncoordinated Pb2+.
It has been reported that the Pb–I antisite defects are the main deep-level defects in perovskite films, where the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions as trap states at grain boundaries readily capture transported electrons.18 After C60-PyP incorporation enabling coordination interactions with the Pb2+ ion of MAPbI3, such uncoordinated Pb2+ trap states can be effectively passivated. As a result, the undesirable non-radiative recombination process can be prohibited, contributing to the increase of Jsc.24 Besides, passivation of the trap states at grain boundaries is beneficial for the inhibition of ion migration and consequently reduced current–voltage hysteresis.41–44
Effect of C60-PyP on the carrier dynamics of the MAPbI3 film
We next carried out a series of characterization experiments to investigate the effect of C60-PyP on the carrier dynamics of the MAPbI3 film. To elucidate the origin of PCE enhancement after incorporating C60-PyP, we first utilize the relationships between Voc and incident light intensity to elucidate the recombination mechanisms within PSC devices. By plotting Voc as a function of incident light intensity, as shown in Fig. 7a, the interior recombination mechanism can be understood according to the following equation:45,46 (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e refers to the elementary charge, and n is the ideal factor related to the dominant recombination mechanism in PSCs. The decreased n value demonstrates a suppressed monomolecular recombination process, leading to improved device performance. After adding 0.13 wt% C60-PyP into the MAPbI3 film, the n value reduces to 1.07 compared to 1.35 for the control device, suggesting the reduction of the monomolecular recombination process as well as the decreased number of trap states. Obviously, C60-PyP within the MAPbI3 film exhibits effective trap state passivation, leading to the reduction of non-radiative recombination and consequently improvement of Voc.

(f) Nyquist plots of the control and 0.13 wt% PSC devices measured in the dark under a reverse potential of 1.0 V. The fitted curves are shown as solid lines, and the experimental data are shown as corresponding points. Inset: the equivalent circuit model employed for the fitting of the impedance spectra. 
To further solidify this speculation of trap passivation via C60-PyP, we then quantificationally evaluate the amount of trap states within the MAPbI3 film using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method based on electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. The corresponding I–V curves are presented in Fig. 7b. In the low bias voltage region, the I–V curves show linear correlation characteristics, indicating that they are located in an ohmic regime. When the bias voltage exceeds the kink point, the current increases nonlinearly, that the trap-states are completely filled. Accordingly, the corresponding bias voltage at the kink point is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), and the trap-state density (nt) can be determined through the equation:24,42 (2)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (28.8 for MAPbI3), e is the elementary charge of the electron, and L = 300 nm is the perovskite film thickness determined by cross-sectional SEM in Fig. 4. The VTFL values of the control device without C60-PyP and the devices with 0.13 wt% C60-PyP are determined to be 0.415 V and 0.196 V, respectively, affording an nt of 1.47 × 1016 cm−3 and 6.94 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The decrease of trap density for the MAPbI3 film with 0.13 wt% C60-PyP indicates the improved film quality of the perovskite.
We next study the charge transfer and recombination dynamics in the MAPbI3 film by performing steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopic measurements. As shown in Fig. 7c, the PL peak at 763 nm for the control MAPbI3 film is assigned to its characteristic emission.47,48 After incorporation of 0.13 wt% C60-PyP into the MAPbI3 film, the PL peak of the corresponding MAPbI3 film is obviously quenched, indicating effective electron transfer from MAPbI3 to C60-PyP because of the strong electron acceptability of fullerene derivatives. Additionally, TRPL spectroscopy was employed to study the charge transfer kinetics from the perovskite to C60-PyP (Fig. 7d). The corresponding fitting parameters are tabulated in ESI S11.† Relative to the control MAPbI3 film with a lifetime of 39.41 ns, the perovskite film with 0.13 wt% C60-PyP shows a markedly decreased lifetime of 8.82 ns, indicating effective charge transfer from the perovskite to C60-PyP.
To confirm the more favorable electron transport within the perovskite film after the doping of C60-PyP, the carrier mobility was measured using the SCLC method through dark current–voltage responses of the electron-only devices shown in Fig. 7e. Based on the Mott–Gurney law [eqn (3)], we calculated the corresponding carrier mobility, where the Jd is the current density and μe is the electron mobility.24,42 (3)
According to eqn (3), the electron mobility of MAPbI3 films increased from 8.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 2.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after incorporation of C60-PyP. The remarkably increased electron mobility for MAPbI3 films with C60-PyP additive is mainly attributed to the strong electron acceptability of C60-PyP. The higher carrier mobility indicates better charge transport properties and directly contributes to the increase of Jsc. Furthermore, the favorable band energy alignment between C60-PyP and the perovskite (Fig. 2c) facilitates charge transfer between adjacent perovskite crystalline grains, suppressing effectively the unfavorable charge accumulation and consequent hysteresis.
Further investigation of the charge transport dynamics of PSCs with or without C60-PyP is performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark under a reverse potential of 1.0 V. The corresponding Nyquist plots of the devices and fitted curves using an equivalent circuit employed for fitting are presented in Fig. 7f. The fitted parameters obtained from Nyquist plots are summarized in ESI Table S4,† including series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), which are related to the internal series resistance and charge transfer dynamics of the devices, respectively. The constant phase element (CPE) is correlated with the non-ideal chemical capacitances. According to the fitting data, after addition of C60-PyP into the MAPbI3 film, the corresponding Rs and Rct values exhibit a similar decreased trend from 2.80 to 1.39 Ω cm2 and from 32.45 to 23.71 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating facilitated charge transport after incorporation of C60-PyP.
Effect of C60-PyP on the stability of the PSC device
To unveil the effect of C60-PyP additive on the stability of the PSC device, the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point was measured (ESI, Fig. S11 and Table S5†). The PCE of the C60-PyP-doped PSC device can be stabilized at 18.63% during the illumination period of 300 s, which is much higher than that of the control device (15.61%). This tendency agrees with that obtained from J–V curves (see Table 1), confirming the reliability of the measured PCE.
The ambient stability of the PSC device is further evaluated by storing the device without any encapsulation under ambient conditions in the dark (temperature: 20 °C, relative humidity: 35%). As shown in Fig. 8, the performance of the control device is quite susceptible to the ambient environment with a PCE drop of ca. 30% after 30 days, whereas the C60-PyP-doped PSC device exhibits a better stability with a PCE drop of ca. 17%. The underlying degradation mechanism is further studied by monitoring the compositional change of the perovskite film by XRD measurements, indicating that the MAPbI3 phase for the control device decreases obviously along with the appearance of the PbI2 phase, whereas upon C60-PyP incorporation, a negligible PbI2 phase is detected in the MAPbI3 film after 30 days (see ESI Fig. S12†). This indicates that the C60-PyP additive could protect the perovskite from degradation due to the hydrophobicity of C60. In addition, we carried out SEM measurements to monitor the morphology change during the degradation of the MAPbI3 film. After storage at a high humidity (80%) for 24 h, the control MAPbI3 film begins to decompose from grain boundaries along with the appearance of a large number of pinholes. However, upon C60-PyP incorporation, the MAPbI3 film still retains the perfectly dense and smooth morphology without obvious pinholes (see ESI Fig. S13†). This can be explained by the fact that the defects accumulated at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film are effectively passivated, and thus the decomposition of the perovskite film by moisture erosion can be effectively suppressed.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative (C60-PyP) was synthesized via a facile 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, and its molecular structure was unambiguously determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. C60-PyP was incorporated as an additive into the MAPbI3 layer to construct bulk heterojunction PSC devices, and a dramatic PCE enhancement from 17.61% to 19.82% is obtained under the optimized C60-PyP doping ratio of 0.13 wt%, with suppressed current–voltage hysteresis and improved ambient stability. Incorporation of C60-PyP provides heterogeneous nucleation sites, leading to the decrease of the nucleation Gibbs free energy and consequently enlarged grain size, improved crystallization and enhanced crystalline orientation of the MAPbI3 perovskite film. Besides, the coordination interaction between the N atom of the pyridine moiety within C60-PyP and the Pb2+ ion within MAPbl3 leads to passivation of the trap states of the perovskite layer, contributing to the improved Jsc. With the effectiveness of the pyridine-functionalized fullerene derivative enabling coordination interactions with MAPbl3 in efficiency enhancement, this study provides new insights into additive engineering towards high-efficiency bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells.

Device fabrication
For the fabrication of PSCs, the ITO-coated glass substrate was ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min before being dried at 60 °C. A TiO2 compact layer was prepared by spin-coating the dispersed TiO2 nanoparticle solution onto ITO at 5000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 150 °C for 30 min. The MAPbI3 perovskite layer was fabricated using the spin-coating precursor solution (composed of 2.2 M MAI, 0.8 M PbAc2 and 0.2 M PbCl2 in 1 ml of DMF) at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For the preparation of the C60-PyP doped perovskite layer, a solution of C60-PyP in DMF was added into the perovskite precursor solution according to different weight ratios. To prepare the spiro-OMeTAD layer, 73.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD was first dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene; then, 28.8 mL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 18.8 mL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) were added. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form a hole transport layer. Finally, the device was transferred into a vacuum chamber (10–6 torr), and an Au electrode (ca. 100 nm thick) was thermally deposited through a shadow mask to define the effective active area of the device (0.10 cm2). All device fabrication procedures were carried out in a N2-purged glovebox (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O).
Measurements and characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characterization was performed using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA) which was calibrated with a mono-crystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with a KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The scan speed for all of the J–V tests in this article was 100 mV s−1. The measurements were performed with a mask (well-defined area size of 0.10 cm2) to ensure accurate measurement under ambient conditions. Around 15 devices were fabricated and measured independently under each experimental condition to confirm the reproducibility of the result and to obtain the statistical histograms of the photovoltaic parameters. The EQE measurements were carried out on an ORIEL Intelligent Quantum Efficiency (IQE) 200TM Measurement system established with a tunable light source. SEM measurements were carried out using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Gemini SEM 500, Germany). AFM images were recorded on an XE-7 scanning probe microscope in non-contact mode (Park systems, Korea). XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source in a vacuum. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (0.154 nm). The GIXRD measurements were performed at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) employing an X-ray with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å. The two-dimensional GIXRD (2D-GIXRD) patterns were acquired using a MarCCD detector mounted vertically at a distance of around 365 mm from the sample with an exposure time of 30 s at a grazing incidence angle of 1°. The 2D-GIXRD patterns were analyzed using software Fit 2D and displayed in scattering vector q coordinates with q = 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is half of the diffraction angle, and λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded employing an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. Impedance spectroscopic measurements (EIS) were performed in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) with a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under 1.0 V. AC 20 mV perturbation was applied with a frequency from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Z-View software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates, USA). All the measurements were carried out in ambient surroundings.
