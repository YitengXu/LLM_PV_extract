    , Accepted 24th May 2021First published on 24th May 2021AbstractThe anion exchange between MAPbX3 (X = I− or Br−) and MAX salts in a solution environment is investigated. We find that I− can enter MAPbBr3 single crystals (SC) in millimeter scale, while Br− can only penetrate the surface of MAPbI3 SC in a micrometer scale. Due to the lattice variation, the reaction is partially reversible.
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have attracted intensive research attention in the past few years due to their unique properties, such as high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance etc.,1–4 for application in photovoltaics, photodetectors, light-emitting-diodes, and X-ray detection.5–8 Typical metal halide perovskites have a composition of ABX3, where A is an organic cation such as methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), and cesium (Cs), B is a divalent metal ion of lead (Pb) and tin (Sn), and X is a halide anion of iodide (I−), bromide (Br−) and chloride (Cl−). Since the first report on using MAPbI3 as the light absorber in solar cells,9 various strategies have been developed to tune the morphology, bandgap and defect density etc. of perovskite thin films for fabricating efficient solar cells.5,9,10 Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% for single-junction solar cells.11 By employing various ions in the perovskites with a specific ratio to tune the bandgaps, highly efficient perovskite-based tandem solar cells have also been fabricated.12–14 In particular, perovskites containing different ratios of I−, Br− and Cl− have demonstrated combined optical properties with structural dominance of the major element of the lattice.12,15,16 Coexistence of different anions demonstrates the potential of perovskites for diversified optoelectronic applications.
Interestingly, besides adjusting the compositions of perovskite precursors, the compositions of the perovskite nanocrystals and thin films can also be tuned by an ion exchange reaction. M. Grätzel et al. firstly reported on rapid halide exchange in MAPbX3, for which the perovskite is infiltrated in a mesoscopic scaffold.17 It was identified that the reaction was strikingly being completed within seconds or minutes after contact. L. Manna et al. investigated the anion exchange reactions in perovskite nanocrystals of CsPbX3, for which the halide ions swiftly exchange by mixing two compositions in solution.18 M. V. Kovalenko et al. found that halide salts were also able to react with CsPbX3 nanocrystals.19 Meanwhile, H. J. Snaith et al. reported on cation exchange for lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3) thin films.20 In particular, it was found that the ion exchange reactions are highly dependent on the crystal and film morphology. In the macroscale, L. Etgar et al. discovered that ion exchange can also occur between the MAPbBr3 single crystal (SC) and halide salts of MAI and MACl.21
In order to minimize the influence of perovskite morphology, grain boundaries and defects, etc., here we employed MAPbX3 SCs to investigate the anion exchange reactions with MAX in a solution environment of ethanol. By conducting photoluminescence (PL) spectra and imaging measurements, we characterized the intrusion of different anions into the perovskite SC. Iodide is able to enter the MAPbBr3 single crystals (size ∼10 mm) and replace bromide in a millimeter scale, while bromide can only penetrate the surface of an MAPbI3 single crystal for dozens of micrometers. For perovskite thin films, we found that the anion exchange reaction can accomplish in several minutes. This work provides a facile method to tune the halide compositions of MAPbX3, and may motivate the understanding of ion diffusion in mixed-halide perovskites.
MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 single crystals were synthesized according to the procedures in the literature.22 MAX and PbX2 were mixed and dissolved in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the precursor solution. The small perovskite particulates were harvested as seed crystals for further crystal growth (Fig. S1, ESI†), and experimental details can be found in the supporting information. For the anion exchange reactions, we selected SCs with the size of ∼10 mm as the target samples. The original MAPbBr3 SC was orange in color, and the original MAPbI3 SC was black in color, as shown in Fig. 1a. The SCs were dipped in MAI solution (10 mg mL−1 in ethanol), and in MABr solution (10 mg mL−1 in ethanol), respectively. After ∼2 hours, the surface color of MAPbBr3 SC completely turned into dark black, and the surface color of MAPbI3 SC turned into orange. Although the lattice parameters of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 are significantly different, the anion exchange process has not caused distinct morphology or volume change. In order to accomplish complete anion exchange, the SCs were then dipped in the MAX solution for ∼12 days, and the samples were labelled as MAPbBr3–MAI and MAPbI3–MABr. To characterize the cross-section, the SCs were cleaved by a surgical blade. The whole cross-section of MAPbBr3–MAI was black in color, indicating that I− anions might completely substitute Br− anions in the crystal (Fig. 1b). However, for MAPbI3–MABr, only the edge of the cross-section was orange in color, while the main body of the cross-section was still black in color, indicating that the intrusion of Br− in the SC of MAPbI3 was limited in the surface layer. The evolution of the surface color was investigated by UV-vis absorption spectrum measurements in reflection mode. As shown in Fig. 1c, the original MAPbBr3 SC showed an absorption onset at ∼590 nm. After an anion exchange reaction, the onset significantly shifted to ∼837 nm, and the onset at ∼590 nm completely disappeared. For MAPbI3 SC, an absorption onset of ∼870 nm was observed. After the anion exchange reaction, the intensity of the onset slightly reduced, and a new onset at ∼590 nm emerged, the position of which nicely matched with that of MAPbBr3. The results indicated that the surface of MAPbBr3 can be completely transformed into MAPbI3, while the surface of MAPbI3 can only be partially transformed into MAPbBr3. Notably, this observation is totally opposite to the results observed for perovskites on a mesoporous scaffold.17 As mentioned previously, our results may shed more light on the intrinsic properties of MAPbX3, since the results were collected by perovskite SCs rather than multicrystalline films. Notably, the quality of the perovskite SCs may also significantly influence this process, since MAPbBr3 SCs may have cracks as reported previously.23 In order to quantify the intrusion of different anions into the perovskite SCs, we observed the morphology and color change by a microscope, and characterized the potential compositions by PL spectrum measurements. The color evolution after the anion exchange reaction nicely matched with results of macroscopic observation, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. In particular, the surface of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 SCs showed similar morphology and textures after anion exchange. For the cross-sections, MAPbBr3–MAI showed black color with luster, and scattered orange spots were observed. For the cross-section of MAPbI3–MABr, a distinct interface between the black domain and orange margin can be observed, and the thickness of the orange margin was estimated to be ∼35 μm. To further analyze the compositions, we conducted PL spectrum measurements at five different locations around the cross-section. As shown in Fig. 2c, on the surface (spot 1#) of MAPbBr3–MAI, a single peak at 783 nm was observed, which exactly matched with the results in the literature for MAPbI3 SC.22 This indicated that a layer of high quality MAPbI3 formed on the surface of MAPbBr3 SC after the anion exchange reaction. When we characterized spot 2# on the edge of the cross-section, the PL peak slightly shifted to 777 nm with reduced intensity, and a tiny peak at 544 nm emerged. Similar results were observed for spot 3#. When we further moved the testing spot to the center (spot 4# and 5#), the PL peak for MAPbI3 disappeared, and a single peak at 543 nm which corresponded to pristine MAPbBr3 SC was observed. This phenomenon indicates that iodide ions have not entered the lattice of MAPbBr3 at the SC center, while leaving the MAPbBr3 phase unaffected. Particularly, in this case, the properties observed at the macroscale (color) cannot reflect the composition, crystal structure or phase of the material.

The locations are marked with green dots. 
For MAPbI3–MABr, on the surface (spot 1#), a PL peak at 683 nm was observed, corresponding to MAPb(IxBr1−x)3 with x ≈ 0.5.24 At the center (spot 2#), a single peak at 773 nm was observed, indicating that MABr has not penetrated into this area. At the edge area (spot 3–5#), which was orange in color, the observed peaks were between 683 nm and 773 nm, and showed a merged shape of two peaks. In particular, halide phase segregation phenomena may occur in these cases, since the observed positions of the PL peaks do not match with the results of UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 1c, and this issue will be further discussed in characterization of MAPbX3 thin films.
MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 thin films were deposited on FTO glass substrates by spin-coating the perovskite precursors in stoichiometry with a concentration of 0.8 M and 1.2 M. The film thickness was estimated to be 200 nm for MAPbBr3 and ∼300 nm for MAPbI3, measured by a profilometer. The MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 thin films were dipped in MAI and MABr solution (10 mg mL−1 in ethanol) for 3–60 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, the yellow MAPbBr3 film rapidly changed to dark brown after 3 min dipping in MAI solution. For longer immersion time, no significant color change was observed. In particular, after 60 min, the film collapsed, which might be caused by the lattice expansion due to the larger size of I− ions. For MAPbI3 thin films, the anion exchange process and color change was much slower. Confirming by UV-vis absorption spectrum measurements, after 3 min of the anion exchange reaction, the absorption spectrum of MAPbBr3 thin film transformed to that of MAPbI3 thin film, showing onset at ∼755 nm. For longer reaction time, the onset slightly shifted to a longer wavelength of ∼763 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). For MAPbI3 in MABr solution, the reaction was gentler. As shown in Fig. 3b, after 3 min, the film was orange, and after 15 min it turned to yellow completely. This is consistent with the results of UV-vis spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†).

XRD measurements were employed to collect information on the structural evolution. For the pristine MAPbBr3 film, distinct peaks at 14.9° and 30.1° were observed as shown in Fig. 3c, which were assigned to the (100) and (200) lattice planes of the cubic structure (space group Pm3m, a = b = c = 5.9171 Å) at room temperature.22,25 After ion exchange reactions, these two peaks steadily shifted to 14.1° and 28.4° (Fig. S4, ESI†), the position of which matched with those of the (110) and (220) of a tetragonal structure (space group I4/m, a = b = 8.8725 Å, c = 12.547 Å) of MAPbI3. In particular, no new peaks emerged after the ion exchange reaction. For MAPbI3 in MABr solution (Fig. 3d), similar transformation of the XRD patterns can be observed (Fig. S5, ESI†). Notably, a new peak appeared at 17.2° occasionally, and it did not belong to MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MAI, MABr, PbI2 or PbBr2.22 Considering it was quite close to the peak of PbBr2 at 18.6° (Fig. S6, ESI†), we propose that the emergence of this new peak is due to the formation of PbI2−xBrx. Since the crystal lattice of MAPbI3 is much larger than that of MAPbBr3, when Br− anions enter the lattice of MAPbI3 and substitute I− anions, severe lattice shrinkage will occur. Otherwise, Br− cannot bond to adjacent Pb atoms for forming [PbBr6]4− octahedral cages. Instead, PbBr2 or PbI2−xBrx may form during the anion exchange reaction.
According to the analysis on XRD patterns, it seems that I− and Br− ions both can completely substitute each other for the thin films, and the halide composition evolves from either pure bromide to mixed bromide/iodide, then to pure iodide. PL spectra and imaging techniques were employed to further investigate the emission characteristics (Fig. 4). For MAPbBr3 films, the initial emission peak located at 531 nm. After 3 min dipping in MAI solution, the emission peak rapidly shifted to 755 nm. As the dipping time increased, the intensity of the emission peak steadily increased. For MAPbI3 films, 3 min dipping in MABr only led to a peak shift from 766 nm to 704 nm, which corresponds to a mixed-halide phase MAPbI3−xBrx. Notably, the peak position cannot be used to evaluate the ratio between I and Br, since it is highly dependent on the phase segregation of I-rich and Br-rich domains. Finally, a longer dipping process resulted in complete substitution of I− by Br−. This indicates that it is feasible to tune the halide composition of perovskite thin films by the anion exchange reaction.

In summary, it is found that ion exchange reactions can occur on the surface of perovskite SCs and thin films, and the penetration of halide ions in the perovskites can reach millimeter scale. Although perovskites based on different halides have different lattice parameters, the intrusion of diverse halide ions into the perovskite SCs will not lead to significant morphology or shape change. This work provides a facile method to tune the halide compositions of MAPbX3, and may motivate the understanding on diffusion and segregation of halide ions in mixed-halide perovskites.
