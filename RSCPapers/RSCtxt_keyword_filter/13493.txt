The ability to prepare high quality perovskite films, with large areas, for solar modules using simple methods is essential for commercializing this promising photovoltaic technology. By combining the composition of the halogens (Cl can improve the morphology of the film by reducing the crystallization rate, and Br can increase the Voc and stabilize the crystal lattice) and film casting engineering (hot solution spin-coating (HSS) and solvent annealing (SA)), high quality single-phase mixed-halide perovskite films can be prepared using a one-step method. This new method can not only prepare high quality, small area films reproducibly but also be adopted readily to prepare high quality homogeneous films with large areas for perovskite solar modules. An inverted mixed-halide perovskite solar module (active area of 25.2 cm2) achieves the highest efficiency of 14.3% with a remarkably high FF of 74.4% and has no current hysteresis.
Organic–inorganic perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X: halide), have proved to be photo absorbers for solar cells since 2009.1 Their capabilities have advanced at an unprecedented trajectory: within 6 years, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells increased to more than 19% (ref. 2–4), and 22.1% efficiency was reported recently.5 Perovskite materials, besides the phenomenal efficiency of their corresponding cells, have the advantages of low cost, high absorption coefficients, excellent carrier transport rates (with a carrier mobility of up to 50 cm2 V−1 s−1),6 all solid components7 and tunable compositions as well as the ability to be fabricated using various non-expensive processes.8–13 High-efficiency devices reported generally have small active areas, however to be commercially viable, up-scaling the device area is necessary. Several methods such as close space sublimation,14 air flow-assisted PbI2 blade coating,15 and using new lead precursors such as Pb(CH3CO2)2·3H2O16 or additives17 have been used to prepare large area perovskite films. A module area of 100 cm2 with an efficiency of 4.3% was achieved.14
In the past several years, our group has developed a two-step spin-coating method to fabricate high quality perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS for inverted perovskite solar cells.18–20 In this paper, we intend to develop a simple, reproducible and scalable method to fabricate large-area, high quality perovskite films for inverted solar cell modules using spin-coating with common precursors such as MAX and PbX2 (X: halogen). Furthermore, it was known that the halide in the CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite is a vital parameter in determining the intrinsic properties (such as electric, electronic and optical properties), film morphology and therefore, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite. For example both experimental results1 and theoretical calculation data21 show that adding Cl in CH3NH3PbI3 will not change the absorption onset (∼800 nm) of the perovskite but will improve the film morphology.22 Furthermore, although CH3NH3PbCl3 has low stability, it has a lower lying HOMO compared to CH3NH3PbI3. As a result CH3NH3PbI3−xClx has a higher carrier lifetime and carrier transport rate than CH3NH3PbI3 and also is more stable than CH3NH3PbCl3.3,11,23
On the other hand, Cheng,24 Noh,25 and Jeon26et al. found that CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx is more stable than the CH3NH3PbI3 film under an ambient atmosphere having moderate (>35%) humidity. In the presence of Br the distorted tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 will turn to the more ordered cubic structure of CH3NH3PbBr3, increasing the thermal stability.27 CH3NH3PbBr3 has a higher LUMO and a lower HOMO energy level25 than CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore solar cells based on CH3NH3PbBr3 (or CH3NH3PbIxBr3−x) exhibit higher open-circuit voltages1,28,29 although the Jsc will be sacrificed. Moreover, the reported high quality perovskite films deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films (instead of compact TiO2 layers) prepared using one-step solution processes generally contain more than one type of halogen.30 In general, mixed-halide perovskite films can be deposited on flat substrates more facilely than full-halide perovskites (such as CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbBr3) using one-step methods due to the former crystallizing more slowly, and therefore better quality films can be obtained. Therefore, precursor solutions containing three types of halogen were used to search for simple film preparation conditions.
The objective of this study focused on developing a simple one-step (without anti-solvent treatment) method to fabricate high-quality perovskite films. Precursor solutions with high concentrations may be necessary for preparing high quality films. Therefore only PbI2, CH3NH3Cl, and CH3NH3Br were used as starting materials for the mixed-halide perovskites, due to the low solubility of PbCl2 and PbBr2 in DMF. We first fixed the concentration of two of the components and changed the concentration of the other in order to test the photovoltaic performance of the resulting mixed-halide perovskite films. The highest efficiency cells based on the films fabricated from the precursor solutions containing various stoichiometries of the halides are listed in Table 1. When the mole ratio of CH3NH3Cl, CH3NH3Br and PbI2 in the precursor solution was 4:1:3, the corresponding device had the highest efficiency of 9.24%. We also tested the photovoltaic performance of the CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared from a 0.6 M (CH3NH3I + PbI2)/DMF precursor solution using the same method and the efficiency of the resulting device was very low (<1%). Certainly, an inverted cell based on the CH3NH3PbI3 film with an efficiency much higher than 10% is also possible using sophisticated/well-controlled fabrication processes such as hot-casting,31 (anti-)solvent washing,32 or two-step spin coating.19

To explore the compositions and structures of the mixed-halide perovskite films prepared from the precursor solutions with varying amounts of halides, EDS, GIXRD and UV/Vis absorption data were obtained. The atomic ratios (listed in Table 2, estimated from the EDS data) of iodine and bromine in the films is close to that in the precursor solutions. For example, the atomic ratios of I/Br are 6 and 3 in the precursor solutions, and the corresponding films have I/Br atomic ratios of 6.4 and 3.2, respectively. Nevertheless the content of chlorine in the films is much lower than that in the precursor solutions (a similar phenomenon was observed by Yang et al.3), even though the film was made using the one-step spin-coating method. It may be due to the size of the Cl− ion (181 pm) being much smaller than that of the I− ion (220 pm). Chlorine ions may be too small to replace iodine in the lattice points of perovskites as proposed by Mosconi et al.33 The source of Cl (CH3NH3Cl), and the resulting full-chlorine perovskite (CH3NH3PbCl3) are very unstable, and they may decompose to CH3NH2(g) and HCl(g) (or PbCl2) during the thermal annealing (100 °C) process.34–36 However, a specific amount of Cl is necessary to prepare high performance mixed-halide films. When the amount of MACl decreases (from 4:1:3 to 3:1:3) or increases (from 4:1:3 to 5:1:3) in the precursor solution, the efficiency of the corresponding cells decreases according to the data displayed in Table 1.

The GIXRD spectra (Fig. 1) of the mixed-halide perovskite films reveal that Film-1 (prepared with the precursor solution containing only MACl and PbI2 with the formula CH3NH3PbI2.4Cl0.6) has two diffraction peaks at 2θ lower than 15 degrees, belonging to the PbI2 (100) plane (12.25°) and the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) plane (13.8°),37 respectively. No diffraction peaks belonging to CH3NH3PbCl3 or PbCl2 were detected. Excess MACl did not react with all of the PbI2 to form CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x, instead only CH3NH3PbI3 and unreacted PbI2 phases were detected in the XRD pattern. It is known38 that the (110) diffraction of CH3NH3PbI2Cl occurs at 14.10°. We did not observe any diffraction peaks at 2θ between 14.10° and 13.8° for Film-1, which may be due to the Cl content being too low or Cl not occupying the lattice points of the perovskite. Cl in the CH3NH3PbI2.4Cl0.6 film may exist as small-sized PbCl2 grains (XRD silent) which distributed randomly in the CH3NH3PbI3 film. Film-2 and Film-3 (both contain three types of halogen) show only one crystalline phase and their (110) and (220) diffraction peaks shift to higher angles, and at the same time their crystalline domain sizes also increase slightly compared to those of the CH3NH3PbI2.4Cl0.6 film (Film-1). Moreover, the (110) diffraction peaks of Film-2 and Film-3 fall between 13.8° and 15.2° (15.2° is the diffraction angle of the (110) plane for CH3NH3PbBr3 (ref. 20, 39 and 40)) and shift to higher angles as the Br content in the films increases. The XRD data suggest that Br atoms may replace iodine in the lattice points of the perovskites, due to the size of the Br− ion (196 pm) being not so different from that of the I− ion (220 pm). The same conclusion was made by Noh25et al. in the preparation of a CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx film which contains only I and Br in the precursor solution. Interestingly, the d-spacing of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (see Table 2) is not directly proportional to the I/Br atomic ratio. The d-spacing of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx is equal to 6.43 Å × (3 − x)/3 + 5.83 Å × X x/3. Nevertheless, the decrease in the d-spacing as a result of inserting Br in the MAPbI3 lattice seems to be proportional to the Br content: for example, compared to MAPbI3, the d-spacing of CH3NH3PbI2.2Br0.3Cl0.5 is 0.05 Å smaller, whereas the d-spacing of CH3NH3PbI2.09Br0.65Cl0.26 is 0.11 Å smaller. We are now trying to grow single crystals of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx to study the relationship between the stoichiometry of I/Br and the d-spacing of the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx perovskite.

UV/Vis absorption spectra of the mixed-halide (Film-1–3) and full-iodide perovskite films are illustrated in Fig. 2. CH3NH3PbI3 has two local absorption maxima (λmax) at ca. 506 nm and 750 nm with an on-set absorption at 800 nm.18 The on-set absorption for CH3NH3PbBr3 is 550 nm and the two values of λmax are at ca. 415 nm and 525 nm.28 The two values of λmax for Film-1 are 484 nm and 750 nm which is slightly blue-shifted for the short wavelength peak but similar for the longer wavelength peak compared to those of CH3NH3PbI3. This is a general phenomenon observed in the absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films.38 On the other hand, both λmax values for Film-2 and Film-3 are blue-shifted compared to those of Film-1 and CH3NH3PbI3, consistent with the higher band gap (shorter λmax) of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx. Film-3, with higher Br content, has a shorter λmax compared to Film-2, which is consistent with the GIXRD data, implying that some iodine atoms in the CH3NH3PbI3 lattice were replaced by bromine atoms in Film-2 and Film-3. Furthermore the shift in λmax can be an indication of the Br content in the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx film, just like the changes in the d-spacing obtained from the GIXRD patterns.

The GIXRD patterns displayed in Fig. 1 also show that the crystalline domains and crystallinity of the mixed-halide perovskite films increase as the content of Br in the films increases. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the cell based on Film-2 is higher than that of the device using Film-3 (with more Br content) as the active layer. The crystallinity and crystalline domain sizes of the active films may not be the only parameters for determining the efficiency of a perovskite solar cell. It is known that the morphology of the active film also has a large impact on the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell. SEM images (both surface and cross-section) of Film-1–3 were taken and are displayed in Fig. 3. In the absence of Br, Film-1 is quite smooth, however it has a lot of holes/defects. The surface roughness of Film-2 is slightly higher than that of Film-1, however no holes were observed. With further increases in the Br content of the film (Film-3), the surface roughness increases further, therefore the efficiency of the corresponding device decreases. Furthermore, Film-1 containing no bromide is very fragile; the film frequently fell apart when broken-in-half to study the morphology of the cross-section. Therefore the cross-section image reveals lots of voids formed by loosely aggregated small particles, consistent with its fragile nature. On the other hand, the cross sections of both Br-containing films (Film-2 and Film-3) are rather dense and show close contact to the PEDOT:PSS layer. The high roughness of Film-3 could be a major reason for its low efficiency.

In the composition screening process, we found that the stoichiometry of MACl/MABr/PbI2 in the precursor solution achieves the best efficiency is 4:1:3. The next screening step is to change the concentration of PbI2 but keep the same mole ratio of the other three components, and the photovoltaic parameters of the resulting inverted cells are summarized in Table 3. The highest efficiency device was based on the film made from the precursor solution with the concentration of PbI2/DMF equal to 0.6 M. However, when the concentration of PbI2 is higher than 0.35 M, the precursor solution may be over-saturated at room temperature. When the precursor solution was passed through a 0.22 μm filter, a precipitate was formed inside the filter. Therefore, fabrication of the devices should be controlled very precisely (such as the temperature and the standing time of the precursor solution) to obtain reproducible results. However, the purpose of this study is to find a very simple method to prepare high quality films for the inverted perovskite solar modules. To simplify the fabrication process and to obtain reproducible results, 0.35 M precursor solutions were used. Perovskite films prepared with low precursor concentrations and high spin rates are very thin, therefore, the spin program was optimized simultaneously and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding films is also listed in Table 3. Data in Table 3 show that the best performance film was prepared from the 0.35 M precursor solution using a consecutive one-step, two-stage spin: 1000 rpm, 10 s, then 7000 rpm, 20 s. The highest obtained power conversion efficiency is close to 12% with a Voc of 1.03 V (the I–V curve is illustrated in Fig. S1, ESI†) and quite reproducible, as shown in the efficiency statistics data also listed in Table 3.

Spin coating is a well-known technique for depositing thin films on substrates. It is also a common technique used to prepare perovskite films for inverted perovskite solar cells. The solution was dripped onto the substrate and a centrifugal force was applied, excess solution was spun-off, and at the same time the solvent in the film evaporated and a dry film was formed on the substrate.28 Perovskite films fabricated using the one-step spin coating method undergo fast three dimensional crystallization reactions, therefore sophisticatedly manipulating the solvent evaporation (and therefore crystal growth) is necessary to obtain a continuous, full coverage film on a smooth surface. To further improve the quality of the perovskite films to enhance the photovoltaic performance, a method named Hot Solution Spin-coating (HSS) was used. In the HSS method, a hot (60 °C) precursor solution (containing a mole ratio of MACl/MABr/PbI2 equal to 4:1:3) was quickly dropped on the spin coater and spun right away. Since the solution is still hot, the solvent evaporates (or solution concentrated) quickly during spinning and a continuous film with no isolated grains is formed. SEM images displayed in Fig. 4 reveal that the mixed-halide perovskite film prepared with HSS is very flat and the grain size is larger than that prepared from the cold precursor solution. The two λmax values of the UV/Vis absorption spectrum for the HSS film are close to those of the film made from the cold precursor solution, indicating that the stoichiometries of Br/I in both films are similar. Not so surprisingly, the inverted cell based on the film prepared using the HSS method has an average efficiency of up to 14% (see Table 3, the I–V curve of the highest efficiency cell is illustrated in Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  SEM images of the mixed-halide perovskite film prepared using the (a) cold solution spin-coating method and (b) hot solution spin-coating (HSS) method, and (c) combining the HSS and solvent annealing (SA) methods (top: low magnification; bottom: high magnification). 
Furthermore, we had shown previously19 that solvent annealing (SA) of perovskite films with DMF can enlarge the grain sizes in the films (when the film is continuous without large holes) and enhance the photovoltaic performance. The same strategy was used to treat the mixed-halide films and the grain sizes increased further as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 4. The inverted cell based on the film prepared by combining the HSS and SA methods exhibited an efficiency of more than 16% with a high Voc of 1.1 V (see Table 3). The high-efficiency cells are very reproducible as the efficiency statistics data (based on 34 devices) shows in Fig. S3, ESI.† The high-efficiency cell also has no current hysteresis over two scan directions, at various scan rates (see Fig. S4(a), ESI†), the stable steady-state Jsc as a function of time is illustrated in Fig. S4(b), ESI† and the current density integrated from the IPCE curve is very close to that measured from the I–V curve (see Fig. S4(c), ESI†). We also used the same film preparation procedure to prepare a full-iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) film from the 0.35 M (MAI + PbI2) precursor solution and the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding cell are also listed in the bottom of Table 3. The efficiency of the inverted MAPbI3 cell is less than 4%, due to the quick crystallization nature of the full-iodide lead perovskite. This is one of the reasons that mixed-halide perovskites were used to develop this simple film fabrication method.
The preparation of perovskite films for small area (typically 0.1 cm2) cells, with high efficiency and good reproducibility, has been achieved using several methods such as two-step spin-coating,19 anti-solvent washing26 and PbI2 seeding41 by several research groups. However, up-scaling these methods to prepare large films for solar modules increases the complexity of the processes, therefore the efficiency of the modules is generally lower than that of the small cells.42 For example, Malinkiewicz43et al. compared the photovoltaic data of large-area (1 cm2) cells with standard-sized (0.09 cm2) cells and found that the conversion efficiency dropped from 12% for the small cells to 8.3% for the large ones. Most of the reduction in efficiency results from a decrease in the fill factor. Thus, developing a simple film preparation method is very important for scaling-up the processes of fabricating solar modules for practical applications. The one-step HSS + SA method we developed for fabricating high-quality mixed-halide perovskite films is very simple, reproducible and straightforward. Therefore it could be readily adopted to prepare large area perovskite films. The designed inverted perovskite solar module is composed of 9 cells in series with the active area of each cell equal to 4 mm × 70 mm. The illustration of the ITO pattern on the substrate and the cross-section of the resulting perovskite solar module, as well as a picture of the real device are displayed in Fig. S5, ESI.† The quality of the large-area perovskite film is almost as good as the small-area films as the SEM micrographs presented in Fig. 5 show. The large-area perovskite film is very flat, composed of big grains and has a good attachment to the PEDOT:PSS layer as shown in the illustration of the cross-section image. The thickness of the film is ca. 230 nm (using both the SEM cross-section image and a depth profile meter) which is also close to that of the small area film prepared with the same precursor solution and using the same method.
 Fig. 5  SEM images (surface (left) and cross-section (right)) of the large-area mixed-halide perovskite film prepared using a combination of the HSS and SA methods. 

Fig. 6(a) shows the I–V characteristics of the inverted perovskite solar module based on the mixed-halide perovskite film prepared using the one-step HSS method combined with the SA method. The module exhibits a Voc of 9.05 V (the average for each cell is 1.06 V), Isc of 53.5 mA, remarkably high FF of 0.744 and an overall conversion efficiency of 14.3% which is the highest value for perovskite solar modules, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the perovskite solar module generally showed photocurrent hysteresis at different scan directions or scan rates.14,16 The photocurrent hysteresis of the module may be due to either the charge traps (so called capacity effect) on the perovskite film with defects, an imbalance in the transport of electrons and holes, the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite material and/or the migration of ions in the perovskite. The I–V curves for the module measured in different voltage scan directions reveal almost no photocurrent hysteresis, suggesting that the large area mixed-halide perovskite film prepared using the new method is of high quality: maybe as good as the small-area films. The same conclusion was derived from the SEM images shown in Fig. 4 and 5. To evaluate the film homogeneity more directly, light beam induced current (LBIC) mapping for the module was performed and illustrated in Fig. 6(b). The spatial map was obtained by illuminating the sample using a diode laser with a wavelength of 530 nm. The related EQE values on the LBIC map of the inverted solar module are quite uniform with no significant border effect. This is why the solar module (composed of 9 cells with sizes of 4 mm × 70 mm arranged in series) exhibits such a high power conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the EQE inhomogeneity was still observed in the LBIC map displayed in Fig. 6(b). It may not just relate to the quality of the perovskite film, but may also be due to the properties of other components of the interphases of the module. More creative film preparation methods and interphase engineering are needed to further improve the quality of the inverted perovskite solar module and increase the power conversion efficiency.

In conclusion, we have developed a one-step hot solution spin-coating method for the reproducible preparation of high quality mixed-halide perovskite films. The advantage of using three types of halogens in the precursor solutions is that Cl can improve the morphology of the film by reducing the crystallization rate of the perovskites and Br can increase the Voc values of the corresponding devices and stabilize the perovskite lattices. Therefore, high quality films can be prepared using a very simple one-step method and achieve a high efficiency of over 16%. This film fabrication method is so simple that it can be readily adopted to up-scale the film size and achieve high efficiencies for inverted perovskite solar modules. Combining the stoichiometry engineering of the halogens, known solvent annealing and the newly developed HSS method, high quality, large-area mixed-halide perovskite films can be prepared and their corresponding inverted solar modules can achieve a record-high efficiency of 14.3% with a remarkably high fill factor of 0.744. This study provides a big step toward fabricating low-cost perovskite solar modules for commercial applications.
Experimental
Materials and physicochemical studies
PEDOT:PSS (1.3–1.7 wt%, from H.C. Stark Baytron P, AI 4083), as an aqueous dispersion, was obtained from Heraeus Co. Fullerene derivatives, PC61BM (99.58%), were purchased from Solenne B. V., Netherlands. PbI2 (99.999%) was bought from Aldrich Co. All materials were used as received except where specified otherwise. ITO-covered glass substrates purchased from Ruilong optoelectronic Co., Taiwan were photolithographically patterned in our laboratory with HCl(aq.) for the small area cells. The ITO pattern for the module was designed by us but fabricated by Ruilong Co. Taiwan. CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br and CH3NH3Cl (MAI, MABr and MACl) were synthesized using a similar method to that reported in the literature.23 UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrometer. The thickness of the films was measured using a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on the 1 cm × 1 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys was used to represent the film thickness. GIXRD data were collected in the 2θ range of 5–50 degrees using a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) with Cu Kα1 radiation and equipped with a 2D detector. Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) data were obtained using a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 15 kV. Samples (films on the substrate) for SEM surface and cross-section imaging and EDS studies were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape and then coated with a thin layer of gold film to avoid charging. The cross-section image of the film was also used to estimate the thickness of the perovskite.
Fabrication of the inverted perovskite solar cells and modules
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on pre-patterned ITO glass at 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. For the fabrication of the mixed-halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−x−yBrxCly) and full-iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) film using the one-step method, various amounts of PbI2, CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br and CH3NH3Cl were mixed and dissolved in DMF then stirred overnight in a glove box to make the precursor solutions. After passing the solution through a 0.22 μm filter, the perovskite films were formed by spin-coating the precursor solution on the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate using various spin rates and times. Specifically, in this study the highest efficiency device was based on the CH3NH3PbI3−x−yBrxCly film fabricated from the precursor solution containing PbI2, MABr and MACl in the mole ratio equal to 3:1:4 and with a PbI2 concentration of 0.35 M. The spin program is 1000 rpm for 10 seconds then 7000 rpm for 20 seconds. For the hot solution spin-coating (HSS) method, the filtered precursor solution was heated to 60 °C and then dropped on the substrate and spun right away. After the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, 2 wt% PCBM in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1500 rpm for 30 s. The solvent annealing (SA) was carried out by covering the film with DMF at room temperature for 24 hours after the perovskite film was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM film was transferred to a vacuum chamber and used to coat the Ca/Al electrode (20 nm/100 nm) to obtain the inverted perovskite solar cell. All of the fabrication procedures, except the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layer, were carried out in a N2-filled glove box. The active area of the cell is 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm. The films made from the same batch of precursor solution were used to synthesize perovskite films for EDS/SEM, GIXRD and UV/Vis measurements as well as for fabricating solar cells. The process of fabricating the solar module is very similar to that used to assemble the small cells except the pre-patterned large area ITO electrode was used and a large amount of the PEDOT:PSS aqueous suspension, hot (60 °C) precursor solutions and PCBM solution were applied on the substrate during the spin-coating process. The active area of the module is 25.2 cm2 (mask area), obtained by connecting 9 cells in series (the active area of each cell is 4 mm × 70 mm).
The photovoltaic performance and light beam induced current (LBIC) measurements
The solar cell and module were covered with a defined mask. The I–V characteristics of the cells were measured using a Keithley 4200 source measuring unit under a simulated AM 1.5G light (Wacom solar simulator for the cells and Yamashita solar simulator for the modules) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. External quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air after sealing the device with a silica sealant and measured immediately. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Inc., Taiwan). The LBIC system used in this study was also designed by Enlitech Inc., Taiwan. The light source for the LBIC (or so-called spatially resolved photocurrent map) measurement was a green laser diode with a wavelength of 530 nm which matches the absorption region of the perovskite solar cells. The intensity of the light was first calibrated using a silicon diode and the module was fixed on an x–y motorized stage. The scanning step of the stage is 0.5 mm and the diameter of the laser light beam is 10 μm. The intensity of the laser light was measured before and after the sample measurements to ensure that the light intensity of the laser was very stable. It takes ca. 10 hours to finish one LBIC measurement. The photocurrent (equal to EQE) produced on each point can be used as an indication of the homogeneity (quality) of each layer and the interphases of the perovskite solar module. The determination of the photovoltaic parameters and the calibration of all measuring facilities are the same as what we reported previously.19
