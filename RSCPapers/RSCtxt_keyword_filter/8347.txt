    , Accepted 3rd March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractA facile and green method has been developed for the aqueous solution preparation of CuOX as an anode buffer layer for organic solar cells (OSCs). The CuOX buffer layer is prepared simply by spin-coating a copper acetylacetonate precursor based aqueous solution onto an ITO substrate at room temperature in ambient air. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used to modify the precursor aqueous solution and can greatly increase the work function of the CuOX film to improve the hole collection efficiency and the charge transport efficiency. UV-ozone post-treatment of the CuOX film leads to the fully oxidized state of copper oxide, which significantly improves the performance of OSCs. Through H2O2 modification and UV-ozone post-treatment on the CuOX anode buffer layer, the highest power conversion efficiency of the OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM blends reaches 8.68%, which is 10% higher than that of the standard PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer based OSCs. In addition, the devices with the CuOX buffer layer show much better air stability than those with PEDOT:PSS. Our results indicate that the aqueous solution processed CuOX with low cost and green solvents is a promising anode buffer layer material for efficient and stable OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively studied due to their unique features, such as potentially low fabrication cost and large area flexibility.1–3 To date, great improvements have been made in OSCs with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% for single-junction cells.4–6 Nevertheless, compared with inorganic solar cells, the PCE and stability of OSCs are still left far behind,7 which hinder their commercial application. To design efficient and stable OSCs, besides the innovation of new photoactive materials, it is well worth paying attention to the interfacial materials between the active layer and the electrodes.8–10 Such a buffer layer can prevent photogenerated carriers from recombining, tune the effective work function of electrodes, and enhance the device stability.9,11–13 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most commonly used anode buffer layer for OSCs.14,15 However, the high acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS cause some corrosion problems on ITO, which affect the long-term stability of OSCs.16–18 Transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as MoO3, V2O5, WO3 and NiO, are emerging as a promising class of alternatives for PEDOT:PSS as anode buffer layers, with demonstrable advantages of the wide range of energy level aligning capabilities, high transmittance in the visible region, and excellent ambient stability.19–25 However, some problems, including the toxicity of the commonly used materials (such as NiO and V2O5) and shortage in the supply of the key metal materials (such as tungsten and molybdenum), have been unmasked as limitations for practical application. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for the development of nontoxic and solution-processable electrode modification layers with earth-abundant materials for high-performance OSCs.
Recently, copper oxides (CuOX), including cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and cupric oxide (CuO), have drawn great attention as anode buffer layers for high-performance OSCs due to their advantages of earth-abundant sources, low cost, and simplicity of preparation.26–30 For instance, Chen et al. have demonstrated the use of CuXO by vacuum thermal evaporation as an effective hole transporting buffer layer and a PCE of 4.06% was achieved for a P3HT:PC61BM blend based solar cell with a device degradation of 25% after 40 days.26 However, the vacuum based deposition method is costly and incompatible with the solution-processed and roll-to-roll techniques used in OSCs.31,32 Thus, there were also some attempts to use solution-processed CuOX as an anode interfacial layer in OSCs. Lin et al. have fabricated the CuOX film well on the P3HT:PC61BM blend by using low-cost sol–gel processing in the inverted device structure and the PCE was improved from 3.11% (without the CuOX interlayer) to 4.02% (with the CuOX interlayer).27 Li et al. reported the application of solution processed CuOX as an anode buffer layer for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a conventional structure. The CuOX buffer layer was prepared via spin-coating a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of copper acetylacetonate on an ITO substrate, followed by thermal transformation (at 80 °C) in air.28 With the introduction of the CuOX anode buffer layer, a high efficiency of 7.14% was obtained for PSCs based on a narrow bandgap conjugated polymer (PBDTTT-C) donor material. CuO nanoparticles synthesized via sonochemistry have also been utilized as an anode buffer layer in a PCDTBT:PC71BM bulk heterojunction solar cell.29 UV-ozone treatment increased the work function of the CuO buffer layer for better interfacial contact and hole extraction, leading to an improved PCE from 6.00% to 6.44% in comparison to the PEDOT:PSS-based solar cells. Despite the considerable efforts devoted to the solution processed CuOX for OSCs, there were few reports on the green aqueous solution processed CuOX at room temperature in ambient air, which possess the advantages of being environmentally friendly and economical when compared with the commonly used organic solvents.
In this work, we develop a facile and green method to obtain the aqueous solution-processed CuOX anode buffer layers for highly efficient OSCs. The CuOX film was prepared from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) modified copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(C5H7O2)2) (CAA) without annealing in ambient air. The resultant CuOX layer on ITO shows a high work function (5.45 eV) and a high light transmittance (88% at 600 nm) in the visible range after UV-ozone treatment. The PCE of OSCs with CuOX as the anode buffer layer is 8.68%, higher than that of the OSCs with PEDOT:PSS as the buffer layer. Moreover, the devices with our CuOX anode buffer layer exhibit much better stability than the devices with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer. Our study suggests that the aqueous solution processed CuOX with low cost and green solvents is a promising anode buffer layer material for efficient and stable OSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Copper(II) acetylacetonate (CAA) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were purchased from 1-material. All solvents were commercially available and used as received without any further purification.
CuOX film deposition
1 mg mL−1 CAA solution was prepared by dissolving accurate amounts of CAA powder in deionized water and then 0.4 vol% acetic acid was added into the solution which made the powder gradually dissolve. 30 vol% H2O2 was added into the CAA solution with the volume ratios of 3:2, 1:1, 2:3 and 1:3 to make H2O2 modified CAA solutions. The H-CuOX film and s-CuOX film were prepared by a spin-coating process using the obtained CAA solution with and without H2O2 modification as a precursor, respectively. The whole spin-coating process was conducted in air at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The s-CuOX and H-CuOX films were washed by spin-coating methanol on it. The O-CuOX film was obtained from the H-CuOX film after UV-ozone post-treatment.
PEDOT:PSS film deposition
PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P AI4083) was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter (0.45 μm) before use. The PEDOT:PSS film was also deposited by the spin-coating process at 3000 rpm for 40 s and then baked at 140 °C for 15 min.
Device fabrication
To prepare the active layer solution, PTB7 and PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, polymer concentration was 25 mg mL−1) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (100:3 v/v). The ITO/glass substrates were cleaned by sonication using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially for 15 min. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were then treated under UV-ozone exposure for 20 min, followed by the deposition of the CuOX or PEDOT:PSS buffer layer by spin-coating. The CuOX or PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were transferred into a glovebox and the active layer was deposited on the top of the CuOX or PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating at 1300 rpm for 120 s. Then a poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) film was spin-coated onto the active layer as a cathode buffer layer from a 0.4 mg mL−1 methanol solution at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Al was deposited with a shadow mask defining an active device area of 5.2 mm2 under a background pressure of approximately 5 × 10−4 Pa.
Film and device characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo) system. The optical transmittance spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode atomic force microscope in the tapping mode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photovoltaic response was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was recorded on a Stanford Research System Model SR830 Lock-in Amplifier unit coupled with a mono-chromator and a 500 W xenon lamp, and a calibrated Si photodiode with a known spectral response was used as a reference.
Results and discussion
Characterization of CAA based anode buffer layers
Since the CAA powder cannot be dissolved in pure water, a small amount of acetic acid (0.4 vol%) was added as an additive. To better understand what happens to the CAA when acetic acid and H2O2 were added, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. S1.† No obvious difference was observed in the FTIR spectra with respect to that obtained from the pure CAA precursor solution, indicating that CAA solutions have similar chemical compositions with and without H2O2. The XPS survey scan (Fig. S2†) also shows the same result that there is no obvious difference between the precursor solutions with and without H2O2 modification.
The absorption, transmittance and reflectance spectra of the CuOX film on ITO, the PEDOT:PSS film on ITO and the bare ITO glass are shown in Fig. 1. The CuOX film on ITO glass has weak absorbance and reflectance, shows similar transmittance from 300 to 900 nm with the bare ITO substrate, and it is even more transparent than the PEDOT:PSS film at wavelengths longer than 500 nm.

XPS core level measurements were performed on the films of s-CuOX, H-CuOX and O-CuOX to study the surface chemical composition. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the broad Cu3/2 peak is de-convoluted into two peaks, which are related to Cu2O (peak 1) and CuO (peak 2). For the s-CuOX film (Fig. 2a), Cu+ has a single peak at 932.8 eV with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.49 eV, but Cu2+ has one main peak at 934.4 eV with a FWHM of 1.65 eV. The Cu2+/Cu+ ratio obtained from the deconvolution of the Cu 2p3/2 peak is about 0.8:1. For H-CuOX films (Fig. 2b), the peaks of Cu+ and Cu2+ are located at 933.1 eV and 934.6 eV with a FWHM of 1.40 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively. The Cu2+/Cu+ ratio slightly increases to 1.0:1. The O-CuOX films (Fig. 2c) show a Cu+ peak at 932.9 eV and a Cu2+ peak at 934.6 eV, and the FWHM of Cu+ and Cu2+is 1.33 and 1.89 eV, respectively. The most noteworthy is that the Cu2+/Cu+ ratio reaches 3.2:1. It can be concluded that the addition of H2O2 and UV-ozone post-treatment can lead to the oxidation state transformation from Cu+ to Cu2+ in copper oxide and what's more, UV-ozone treatment contributed more. Fig. 2d shows the O 1s core level XPS spectra of the CuOX films. There is a strong peak at 530.3 eV, which corresponds to O 1s binding energy.33

Fig. 3 shows the AFM height (a–d) and the phase (e–h) images of the s-CuOX (a and e), H-CuOX with a H2O2:CAA volume ratio of 3:2 (b and f) and 2:3 (c and g), and O-CuOX (d and h) films. It is clear that CuOX exists in the form of nanoparticles. Modified with H2O2, CuOX particles aggregate together and turn into flakes. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of s-CuOX, H-CuOX with a H2O2:CAA molar ratio of 3:2 and 2:3, and O-CuOX films is 2.70, 2.70, 2.84 and 2.68 nm, respectively, indicating smooth surfaces. It can also be concluded that there is a full coverage of CuOX on the ITO substrate from their phase images. The AFM images of the PTB7:PC71BM film on ITO/O-CuOX, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and bare ITO glass are shown in Fig. S3.† The PTB7:PC71BM film on ITO/O-CuOX shows a RMS roughness of 0.80 nm, which is similar to that on ITO/PEDOT (0.80 nm) and bare ITO glass (0.81 nm). It can be seen that the UV-ozone treatment on the CuOX buffer layer has almost no effect on the morphology of the PTB7:PC71BM film, which could be attributed to the good film forming properties of PTB7.

The work function (WF) of the anode buffer layer is crucial to the performance of OSCs. For efficient hole-extraction, the WF should be high enough to pin the Fermi level to the positive integer charge-transfer state of the donor materials, according to the integer charge-transfer (ICT) model.34 We measured the WF of the CAA based anode buffer layers on ITO substrates by UPS. As shown in Fig. 4, the WF of the s-CuOX film is 5.06 eV, which is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS.35 Nevertheless, by means of adding H2O2 to the CAA solution before spin-coating, the WF of the H-CuOX film substantially increased to 5.38 eV. And the WF was further increased to 5.45 eV by UV-ozone post-treatment. The increased work functions of H-CuOX and O-CuOX films are beneficial to the formation of ohmic contact between the anode and the photoactive layer, indicating their possibility as high performance anode buffer layers for OSCs.

Device performance
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our CAA based anode buffer layers, OSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM blend with the conventional device structure of ITO/CuOX/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al (see Fig. 5b) were fabricated. The molecular structures of the PTB7, PC71BM, and PFN molecules are shown in Fig. 5a. The energy level diagram of the device with different anode buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS and CuOX films is shown in Fig. 5c. The typical photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 6a. The device performance is also summarized in Table 1. The device based on the bare ITO has a poor PCE of 6.06%, a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 14.62 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61 for reference. The device with the s-CuOX anode buffer layer shows greatly improved performance with a PCE of 7.37%, a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 15.60 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68. If the CAA solution was modified with H2O2 (the H2O2 and CAA solution volume ratio adjustment is shown in Table S1†), the device based on the H-CuOX buffer layer has a slightly increased VOC of 0.72 V due to the WF increase of the H-CuOX film. Its FF also increases to 0.70, and thus the PCE of the device based on the H-CuOX film increases to 7.78%, which is comparable to that of the device with the PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer (PCE of 7.89%). The device with the O-CuOX film post-treated via UV-ozone (time optimization is shown in Table S2†) has the best performance. The VOC, JSC and FF of the device are all significantly enhanced to 0.74 V, 16.44 mA cm−2, and 0.71, respectively, and thus the maximum PCE can be further enhanced to 8.68% (with an average PCE of 8.52 ± 0.08%), which is 10% higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer based device.

The series resistance (Rs) of the devices is calculated from the J–V characteristics under illumination at around 1 V (summarized in Table 1). The increased FF of the CuOX and PEDOT:PSS based devices could have resulted from the decrease in Rs (from 5.5 Ω cm2 for the device without the buffer layer to about 2 Ω cm2 for the device with the anode buffer layer). The increased JSC of the CuOX modified devices could be ascribed to the enhanced charge collection at the CuOX/PTB7:PCBM blend interface and enhanced charge transport, which benefits from the high WF of H-CuOX and O-CuOX anode buffer layers. The fully oxidized state leads to the upward shift of the built-in voltage for the CuO containing devices compared to that for Cu2O, which indicates a more efficient separation of the photo-generated carriers and thus results in a higher photo-current density in CuO containing devices.26 Consequently, the JSC of O-CuOX based OSCs is significantly enhanced compared to that of H-CuOX and s-CuOX.
We also measured the EQE of the OSC devices. As shown in Fig. 6b, the calculated JSC values from the integration of the EQE spectra are close to the values obtained from J–V curves with the average deviations below 10%, which indicates that the experimental results presented in this work are reliable. The higher EQE of the devices based on CuOX could also be ascribed to the enhanced transmittance of ITO/CuOX (as shown in Fig. 1) and the increased hole collection efficiency and the charge transport efficiency, which benefitted from the higher WF of the CuOX buffer layer. It should be mentioned that, although the transmittance of CuOX in the wavelength range of 400–550 nm is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (see Fig. 1), the EQE of the CuOX-based device is higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device in the wavelength range (see Fig. 6b), which could be resulted from the additional absorption in the active layer of the CuOX-based device in the range of 400–550 nm due to the overall light redistribution of the incident light resulting from the different thicknesses of CuOX (5–10 nm) and PEDOT:PSS (∼30 nm) layers.24,36,37
To compare the charge collection between the devices with H-CuOX and O-CuOX films as anode buffer layers, the charge collection probability (PC)38,39 with respect to the internal voltage (Vint) under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was calculated as shown in Fig. 7. We found that the PC of the device based on the O-CuOX film is higher than that based on the H-CuOX film in the full range from short-circuit to open-circuit conditions.40 The PC increases from 94.9% to 96.9% under the short-circuit conditions by UV-ozone post-treatment of the CuOX layer.

The long term stability of unencapsulated OSCs with our aqueous solution processed CuOX and PEDOT:PSS buffer layers is investigated by testing the degradation of the characteristic parameters (PCE, VOC, JSC and FF) with time under an ambient atmosphere as shown in Fig. 8. After 50 hours, the PCEs of the CuOX modified devices stored in air dropped to about 47% of the initial PCEs. The observed decrease in the PCE is mainly due to the degradation of both JSC and FF, with an almost unchanged VOC. In contrast, the stability of the devices with PEDOT:PSS is quite poor, nearly 0% of their initial PCE was retained after 40 hours in air. The ambient humidity absorbed by the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS could cause corrosion of the cathode layer, leading to the increase of series resistance, which explains the decrease of JSC and FF.41 Although our CAA based anode buffer layers are water-soluble and prepared from aqueous solution, our experiment illustrates that they are not hygroscopic or degraded by humidity. Consequently, the CAA based films are very useful buffer layers for OSCs in terms of stability.

Conclusions
In conclusion, efficient and stable organic solar cells have been achieved by using aqueous solution-processed CuOX as the anode buffer layer. The CuOX film can be easily prepared from a H2O2 modified copper acetylacetonate based aqueous solution at room temperature in ambient air. The CuOX layer shows high light transmittance. Hydrogen peroxide can greatly increase the work function of the CuOX film. The high work function improves the hole collection efficiency and the charge transport efficiency. UV-ozone post-treatment makes most Cu2O transform into CuO, which indicates a more efficient separation of the photo-generated carriers and thus results in a much higher photo-current density. A high PCE of 8.68% was obtained for the OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM with the aqueous-processed CuOX anode buffer layer. In addition, compared with the PEDOT:PSS modified devices, OSCs with the CuOX layer exhibit much better long term stability in ambient air. Therefore, the CuOX layer obtained from our environment friendly approach is a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS for producing low-cost, highly efficient and stable solar cells.
