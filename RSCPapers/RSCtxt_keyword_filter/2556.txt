    , Accepted 20th July 2011First published on 18th August 2011AbstractA TiO2-nanotube-array-based photocatalytic fuel cell system was established for generation of electricity from various refractory organic compounds and simultaneous wastewater treatment. The present system can respond to visible light and produce obviously enhanced cell performance when a narrow band-gap semiconductor (i.e.Cu2O and CdS) was combined with TiO2 nanotubes.
Since the first discovery of photocatalytic water-splitting on a single-crystal TiO2 electrode by Fujishima and Honda,1 extensive research has shown that titania is a promising catalyst for photocatalytic applications due to its high efficiency, low cost, chemical inertness and photostability.2 A variety of preparation routes have been applied to fabricate nano-scaled TiO2 of different geometric shapes and microstructures (i.e. particulates, rods, wires, belts, or tubes), including hydrothermal synthesis, template synthesis, magnetic sputtering, or sol–gel.3 Of these fabrication methods, the architecture demonstrating by far the most remarkable properties are highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNA) synthesized by anodization of titanium in fluoride-based baths, the dimensions of which can be precisely controlled.4 Well aligned TiO2 nanotubes with various lengths (0.5–720 μm), pore sizes (20–250 nm) and wall thicknesses (7–40 nm) can be achieved by finely tuning the electrochemical parameters during their synthesis.5 For applications where the use of highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes has been studied, these advantages have manifested themselves in an extraordinary enhancement of the properties when compared to any other form of titania.6
Recently, a TNA-based photocatalytic oxidation technique has been proven to be a promising process that can be used to degrade various persistent and hazardous organic pollutants.7 Upon illumination, photo-generated electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, generating electron–hole pairs. The positive holes are powerful oxidants for degrading the organic compounds adsorbed on the nanotubes surface. Most studies on TNA-based photocatalysis have mainly focused on the efficiency and the extent of mineralization. However, the important application of the TNA electrode in energy yield from refractory organic wastewater with simultaneous wastewater treatment has not been reported yet. Meanwhile, organic compounds in wastewater are important sources of energy. Based on the statistics,8 energy loss in terms of organic matter caused by biowaste discharge has reached 130 EJ per year, corresponding to almost one third of the global yearly energy demand. Therefore, seeking sustainable approaches that recover the energy from these energy-rich organic wastes and degrade them to non-hazardous products are highly desirable.
Designing a system in which organic compounds from wastewater are degraded and the chemical energy is converted into electrical energy simultaneously can achieve a double benefit—organic pollutant degradation and energy reclamation. The TiO2 photocatalytic process may degrade organic matter and constantly produce photogenerated electrons that directly pass through the conductive substrate to the cathode. In turn, this forms a TiO2-based photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) system. In 2005, Drew and co-workers9 first reported a hybrid-catalyst-based fuel cell system. In that work, the TiO2 photocatalytic technology was introduced in the Pt–Ru fuel cell system to generate electricity by using methanol as a substrate.
Preparation by sonoelectrochemical anodization of a short, robust, and highly ordered TiO2 nanotube array (STNA, Fig. S1, ESI†) with superior electron transfer performance and excellent mechanical stability has been reported.10 In this work, the high-performance STNA electrode was applied as a photoanode material in the novel fuel cell system for electricity yield using various refractory organic compounds as “substrates” and simultaneous wastewater treatment. The studied refractory model compounds include aromatics, azo dyes, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), surfactants, etc. The present PFC system can respond to visible light and give even better cell performance by utilizing a composite electrode prepared by decorating the TiO2 nanotubes with a narrow band-gap semiconductor (i.e.Cu2O and CdS). Our findings suggest that the PFC system may provide the basis for the development of novel devices for generation of electrical power from renewable resources with simultaneous degradation of refractory organic waste in liquid or soluble form.

Fig. 1 shows the working principle of the STNA-based PFC system. Upon illumination, the TiO2 nanotubes photoanode will produce electron/hole pairs in the conduction band and the valence band, respectively. The photogenerated holes will oxidize the organic molecules (fuel) to CO2 and H+. While the photogenerated electrons will move through an external circuit to the Pt-black/Pt cathode. Hydrogen ions generated from photo-oxidation move toward the cathode via diffusing through the electrolyte solution. These will interact with oxygen and externally arriving electrons to produce water under aerobic conditions.

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of various typical refractory organic compounds (including PPCPs, azo dyes and aromatics etc.) are listed in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). On comparing the results, the organic acids present relatively higher cell performance compared with other compounds shown here, identifying the organic acids can be easily photodecomposed by the photocatalytic process of TiO2 nanotubes. Especially, in the case of malonic acid, the highest cell performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.53 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.55 V and a maximum power output (JVmax) of 0.64 mW cm−2 was obtained. Among the group of azo dyes, methylene blue with a simplest molecular structure produced the best performance (Fig. S9, ESI†). This may partly be due to smaller molecular volume of methylene blue compared with other azo dyes. More methylene blue molecules can be adsorbed per unit photoanode area. Other complex organics might necessitate more oxidative steps to achieve complete decomposition and mineralization.

Other recalcitrant organic compounds such as aromatics, EDCs, PPCPs as well as surfactants were also successfully photodecomposed by the TiO2 nanotubes photoanode and gave the relevant PFC characteristics (Table S1, ESI†). The cell efficiencies listed in Table 1 are relatively large. The reason is that the exciting radiation has a limited spectral extent around 254 nm and it is directly absorbed by titania with small losses.11 The data in Table 1 reveal that the above electrochemical cell can be successfully employed to photodegrade a large variety of refractory water pollutants, leading to water cleaning with simultaneous production of electricity.
One of the advantages of the PFC is that the quantum efficiency of the system can be obtained.12 Since within the system, a forward bias was exerted between the cathode and the photoanode of PFC, which would facilitate efficient electron transfer within the photoanode material, most of the electrons would flow towards the cathode via the external circuit. Under this condition, the charges that passed through the external circuit could be regarded as the amount of the charges used effectively for substrate oxidation at the STNA photoanode. The internal quantum efficiency (η′) of the system could then be defined as the ratio of the total decomposition number against photon number effectively used for activating the substrate, and the denominator can be estimated from the charges passed in the external circuit in the PFC.13

Tetracycline was selected as a model substrate in this work. Within 8 h, tetracycline was decreased from 0.22 to 0.012 mmol L−1 (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†), which corresponds to conversion of 2.08 μmol tetracyclinevia a 78-electron process per one tetracycline molecule. This amounts to the charge of 96485 × 2.08 × 10−6 × 78 = 15.6 coulombs (C) for the oxidative decomposition. The charges passed in the outer circuit during the 8 h reaction were measured to be 7.36 C (Fig. S8, ESI†), which leading to η′ equals to 212%. This provides compelling support that both the incident light energy and the chemical energy contribute to the system performance of the PFC.
The PFC system can also respond to visible light and give even higher performance under the irradiation of simulated solar light illumination if a narrow band-gap semiconductor is complexed with the highly-ordered TiO2 nanotubes photoanode. Table 2 summarizes the J–V characteristics of the PFC system applying different photoanode materials under solar light irradiation. As can be seen that, the pure STNA electrode produces comparable or even better PFC performance compared with that under UV illumination. This can be ascribed to the low UV irradiation intensity used, ∼3.6 mW cm−2, which is nearly comparable with the intensity of the UVA part of the solar spectrum. Moreover, compared with the traditional TiO2 nanoparticulate film (Fig. S2, ESI†),14 the STNA electrode gave much higher Jsc values in various organic solutions, which can be due to the different microstructures of the two electrode materials (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). The excellent transportation properties of photogenerated electrons and desirable mechanical stability of the STNA electrode make it a desirable photoanode material for PFC applications.

The combination of the pure STNA electrode material with narrow band-gap semiconductors (e.g.Cu2O and CdS)15 increases greatly both the Jsc as well as the JVmax value under simulated solar light illumination (AM1.5). Especially for the CdS/STNA nanocomposite photoanode (Fig. S3, ESI†), Jsc and JVmax of the PFC system are found to be 1.66–1.75 and 1.38–2.41 times higher than those of the respective pure TiO2 nanotubes photoanode in three different organic compounds solution (Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, to demonstrate visually the electrical energy generation, an example of 0.05 mol L−1phenol could light a LED indicative lamp by applying four CdS/STNA-based PFC systems in series under visible light illumination (Fig. 2 and Fig. S10, ESI†), since the LED requires an excitation voltage of 2–4 V. Even without applying the light sources, the present PFC systems can work outdoors under solar illumination and light a LED indicative lamp by using the composite photoanode materials (Fig. S11, ESI†). That means the PFC systems can work outdoors efficiently under natural solar illumination by applying modified photoanode materials. Practical applications of the above procedure are then feasible.

The employed PFC system was, however, not optimized, since optimization of the system was not the main focus of the present work. The cell performance would have been better if, for instance, the distance between the two electrodes were shorter, the higher light intensity adopted and larger photoanode area exposed to illumination. All these factors affect cell performance and organic compounds degradation. Furthermore, the present PFC system is a small laboratory prototype, which we believe can be further optimized and up-scaled to synthesize a large size unit module towards practical environmental applications.
In conclusion, a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) system was established for recovering energy from various refractory organic compounds and simultaneous water cleaning. The studied model compounds include aromatics, azo dyes, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), etc. and their cell performances were demonstrated. The short, robust and highly-ordered TiO2 nanotubes photoanode enhanced cell performance under both UV and solar light illumination compared with the traditional TiO2 nanoparticulate film. Furthermore, the present PFC system could utilize solar or visible light rather than UV light by applying appropriate narrow band-gap semiconductor material to produce electricity from various poorly-degradable environmental pollutants. Such a PFC system may serve well as a promising technology for wastewater treatment.
