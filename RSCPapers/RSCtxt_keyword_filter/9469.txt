    , Accepted 26th June 2022First published on 27th June 2022AbstractWe report synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of the novel [5,6]-open C70(CF2) isomer III along with the already known [6,6]-closed and [6,6]-open C70(CF2) isomers I and II. The compounds were obtained in a ratio of I:II:III = 4:6:1 by means of thermal treatment of C70 fullerene with sodium chlorodifluoroacetate. This product composition is explained with the use of quantum chemical calculations that identify the reaction pathway as a two-stage nucleophilic cyclopropanation rather than the previously postulated carbene addition. We further report the first cyclic voltametric studies for the whole set of isomers of C70(CF2). Together with the DFT data, they demonstrate that the LUMO is stabilized in both isomer II ([6,6]-open) and III ([5,6]-open) by 0.1 eV with respect to the pristine C70, and isomer III has the lowest reorganization energy of all.
Introduction
Organic electronics is a constantly developing research field. Fullerene derivatives, being among the first n-type semiconducting materials tried, are still widely used in organic solar cells (OSCs), hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), etc. as vital components in the electron transport layers and/or photoactive layers.1,2 Many non-fullerene acceptors are presently used in the organic solar cells3,4 and show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 18%,5 yet the fullerene derivatives, in particular, isomeric mixtures of PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester), are still employed as a reference electron acceptor material in organic photovoltaics. The highest PCE values of OSCs with PC71BM-based active layers exceed 17% as well.6,7 In a series of recent studies,8–12 individual regioisomers of PC71BM and their analogs have been considered as well and have proved generally advantageous with respect to the mixtures. It should be noted that the electronic properties of the compounds, in particular absorptivity in the visible region, are mostly governed by the exact addition pattern of the exohedral moieties.13,14

D
5h-symmetric fullerene C70 features five orbits of equivalent carbon atoms, and the C–C bonds fall into eight orbits. The portions of the molecule near the ends of its fivefold axis are usually referred to as poles while the belt between them – as the equatorial region. Typically, common syntheses (e.g. the Bingel–Hirsch reaction, the Prato reactions, carbene addition, etc.) with fullerene C70 provide isomeric mixtures of two regioisomeric monoadducts at [6,6]-bonds 5 and 7 (see Fig. 1) near the poles.15–18 In addition, an unusual byproduct, a [5,6] Prato adduct at bond 4 in the equatorial region of C70, has been reported recently.19 Activation of bond 4 has also been observed in C702− dianions:20 treatment thereof with α,α′-dibromo-o-xylene gives the respective closed [5,6]-adduct in addition to the common [6,6]-closed ones at bonds 5 and 7. Formation of C70(CH2) serves an exclusive example of functionalization of the equatorial [6,6]-bond (1), which requires extreme pyrogenic conditions.21 Likewise, preparation of the [5,6]-open C70(CCl2) by thermolysis of alkali trichloroacetates is the only example of methylenation at bond 4.22
 Fig. 1  Structures of isomeric difluoromethylenated fullerenes C70(CF2) I–III. 
Previously,23 we have been demonstrated that CF2 fullerene derivatives can be promising as acceptor materials for organic electronic devices due to low reorganization energy, energy of the frontier levels like in the celebrated PC61BM, and decent electron-transfer rate like in pristine fullerenes. Here we report synthesis, isolation and electrochemical study of a novel [5,6]-open regioisomer C70(CF2) and compare it against the previously known [6,6]-open and [6,6]-closed isomers (Fig. 1).
Experimental
All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Solvents were dried by common techniques and distilled before use. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed with an Agilent 1100 series LC system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) and a thermostated analytical (4.6 mm I.D. × 25 cm) Cosmosil Buckyprep column. HPLC separation was carried out using Shimadzu LC 20 series instruments equipped with DAD and UV/Vis λ2 detectors, recycling system, and thermostated semi-preparative (10 mm I.D. × 25 cm) and preparative (20 mm I.D. × 25 cm) Cosmosil Buckyprep columns. In the course of the HPLC analyses, UV/Vis/NIR spectra of the toluene solutions were being registered with a diode array detector in the 290–950 nm range with 2 nm resolution. The MALDI mass spectra (negative ion mode) were acquired using two instruments: a Bruker AutoFlex Rf-TOF (N2-laser, 337 nm, 2.5 ns pulse) and Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL Hybrid Fourier Transform (N2-laser 337 nm, 3 ns pulse). The latter enabled high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) with resolving power over 50000. 2-trans-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenilyden]malononitrile (DCTB, ≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a matrix. 13C and 19F NMR spectra in CDCl3 or [D4]oDCB with small amount of hexafluorobenzene (C6F6, δF −162.9 ppm) as an internal standard were recorded at 565 and 151 MHz, respectively, using a Bruker Avance III spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out under oxygen-free and moisture-free (<1 ppm) argon atmosphere in an MBRAUN Labstar glovebox. The CV curves were registered at 100 mV s−1 using Elins Pi-50Pro-3 potentiostat at ambient (25 °C) temperature in a home-made one-compartment cell with a platinum disc working electrode (WE), a platinum coil counter electrode (CE), and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (Ag wire immersed in a solution of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in acetonitrile separated from the main compartment by a Vycor® plug; RE) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) using 0.2 M Bu4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte. oDCB was purified by distillation under reduced pressure in the presence of CaH2 followed by purging through column containing dry SiO2 and activated molecular sieves (4 Å pore size) and stored in glovebox over anhydrous alumina. Bu4NBF4 (for electrochemical analysis, ≥99.0%, Fluka) was stored in a glovebox and used as received. After each experiment, ferrocene (Fc) was added to the cell as an internal standard. The potential of the Fc+/0 couple in oDCB was in the range of 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 couple. Potential iR-drops were corrected during experiment using hardware positive feedback method.
Synthesis of C70(CF2)
The C70(CF2)n (n = 1–3) mixture was prepared according to the previously reported protocol.24 To a solution of C70 (168 mg, 0.2 mmol) in oDCB (200 mL), dry CF2ClCOONa (304 mg, 2 mmol, 10-fold excess, two equal portions with an interval of 1 h) and a catalytic amount of 18-crown-6 (10%, ca. 15 mg) were added. The mixture was heated at reflux for 3–4 h (ca. 180 °C), and its composition was monitored using HPLC (Cosmosil Buckyprep 4.6 mm I.D. × 25 cm, toluene, 1 mL min−1). Then, the reaction mixture was filtered through a silica gel column using toluene as an eluent, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid residue was redissolved in toluene, filtered and separated using HPLC. To isolate the three isomers of C70(CF2), initial separation with a preparative HPLC (Cosmosil Buckyprep 20 mm I.D. × 25 cm, toluene, 15 mL min−1) was followed by purification with a semi-preparative recycling HPLC (Cosmosil Buckyprep 10 mm I.D. × 25 cm, toluene, 4.6 mL min−1).

Quantum chemical calculations
Computations of optimized molecular geometry, relative energy, hessians, transition states and IRCs, adiabatic electron affinity, frontier molecular orbital distribution, and NMR chemical shifts were performed at the RI-DFT level of theory with the use of PRIRODA v.6 software.25 PBE exchange-correlation functional26 and a built-in basis set of triple zeta quality (tz2p) were employed. Solvation corrections for the ring closure process in C70(CF2Cl)− were obtained by single-point recomputations with the hybrid PBE0 functional27 and D-PCM solvation model.28 Gas phase electron affinity values were also refined by single-point PBE0 recalculations. All PBE0 computations used the def2-svp basis set29 and were performed with Firefly v. 8.2.0 package,30 partly based on the GAMESS(US) software code.31 The experimental EA(C70) value of 2.765 ± 0.010 eV was used to scale the calculated data.32
Results and discussion
Synthesis, isolation, and structures of isomeric C70(CF2) compounds
Difluoromethylenated derivatives of C70 were synthesized as described hereinbefore. HPLC-MS extracted-ion-current (EIC) mass chromatogram for C70(CF2)− ion (m/z 890 Da) revealed three different C70(CF2) monoadducts in the raw product (Fig. 2(a)). Two earlier eluted C70(CF2) isomers were of much higher abundance than the last one, and from the retention times they were identified as the known [6,6]-closed and [6,6]-open C70(CF2) isomers I and II.24 The less abundant isomer III of C70(CF2) is isolated for the first time. Previously, its presence was only hinted at by the mass spectrometry data.

Preparative HPLC separation of the raw product gave three fractions f3, f5, and f6. The MALDI MS data showed all three to be dominated by C70(CF2) (see Table S1 in ESI†). Fraction f6 that contained isomer III was found to be contaminated with the earlier eluted isomer II and some CF2 bis-adducts and even minor amounts of tris-adducts. Further purification by seven cycles of semi-preparative HPLC afforded 5 mg of isomer III (cf. 168 mg of the starting C70 and 22 and 30 mg, respectively, of the isolated isomers I and II) with 98+ % HPLC purity (Fig. 2(b)). Thus, the yields of the three isomers were 13, 18, and 3%, respectively, and the I:II:III molar ratio was ca. 4:6:1. This ratio differs from the 1:3:1 estimate based on the negative ion EIC detection in HPLC-MS (Fig. 2(a)). Thus, the negative ion MS data likely suffer from the discrimination effect, i.e. readier electron attachment by more electrophilic molecules, in the present case – isomers II and III (see discussion below and Table 4). The need for extra, two-stage HPLC separation can also contribute to lower apparent yield of the isomer III.
The 19F and 13C NMR spectra of the isolated isomers I and II further supported their assignment as the known [6,6]-closed and [6,6]-open C70(CF2) isomers, respectively (see Table 1 and Fig. S3, S4 in ESI†).24 The 19F NMR spectrum of C70(CF2)-III reveals an AX spin system with two doublets at δF of −92.4 and −121.6 ppm and the spin-spin coupling constant 2JFF = 211.5 Hz (Fig. 3(a)), thus demonstrating inequivalence of the fluorine atoms within the CF2 group. The 13C NMR spectrum contains 34 sp2 fullerene cage signals in the δC range of 128–152 ppm and two doublets of doublets at 111.12 (2JCF = 43 and 28 Hz) and 117.17 (1JCF = 250 and 241 Hz) ppm clearly attributable to the equivalent bridgehead carbon atoms and to the CF2 carbon atom, respectively (Fig. 3(b)). The chemical shift value in the bridgehead atoms corresponds to the sp2 state, which suggest that isomer III is a homofullerene, i.e. a product of CF2 insertion into a C–C bond rather than of cyclopropanation.

The number of distinct 13C NMR signals is consistent with either Cs or C2 symmetry, but the latter is incompatible with a single CF2 addend: addition at bond 1 where the C2 axis passes would result in higher, C2v symmetry. Excluding Cs isomers I and II where bonds 5 and 7, respectively, are involved (in isomer II, the fluorine atoms are, moreover, equivalent), the only remaining possibilities are addition at the [5,6]-bond 4 or 8 (see Fig. 3). The DFT predicted 19F and 13C NMR chemical shifts in the C–CF2–C fragment for the two known isomers and the two isomer III candidates are compared in Table 1 against the experimental data. As one can see, the 19F chemical shifts unambiguously favor the adduct at bond 4 over the adduct at bond 8. Thus, isomer III is isostructural to the less-abundant Prato and other adducts of C70.19,20
The geometry of the three isomers of C70(CF2) was optimized at the PBE/tz2p and PBE0/def2-svp levels of theory. In good agreement with the previous work,24 PBE/tz2p data predict that isomers I and II assume, respectively, [6,6]-closed and [6,6]-open configuration. The new isomer III turns out to have a [5,6]-open configuration, with a markedly steeper potential energy surface (PES) profile (Fig. S8, ESI†) than the isomers I and II where the open-closed difference remained within 10 kJ mol−1.24 Interestingly, PBE0/def2-svp calculations incorrectly predict generally lower separations between the bridgehead atoms and even [6,6]-closed configuration for isomer II. Despite PBE0 is generally far more accurate than PBE, it is the latter that predicts the structure of CF2 fullerene derivatives more correctly, which can be seen from a comparison against X-ray structures available for, e.g. [6,6]-open C60(CF2) and [5,6]-open C70(CF3)8CF2.34,35 In view of that, bond opening in difluoromethylenated fullerenes could serve as an interesting test case for computational methods.
As shown in Table 1, DFT calculations predict isomers II and III to be virtually isoenergetic, and so would be the so far unavailable adduct at bond 8. In the same time, isomer I is some 20 kJ mol−1 less stable.24 Thus, difluoromethylenation of C70 is controlled kinetically rather than thermodynamically.
Mechanism of fullerene difluoromethylenation
Previously, it was assumed that fullerene difluoromethylenation with sodium chlorodifluoroacetate proceeds through [2+1] cycloaddition of difluorocarbene generated by thermal decomposition of the salt.24,33 Indeed, sodium chlorodifluoroacetate was one of first reagents used as a source of difluorocarbene, as early as in 1960.36 Since then, many novel difluorocarbene-releasing compounds have been developed,37,38 yet readily available CF2ClCOONa is still relevant. Typically, reactions of alkenes with a large excess of alkali chlorodifluoroacetate (sometimes in the presence of 18-crown-6 as a catalyst) are carried out in diglyme under reflux (162 °C) to give gem-difluorocyclopropanes. Thermolysis of chlorodifluoroacetate yields chlorodifluoromethyl anions (CF2Cl−) that are believed to be very short-lived and to rapidly produce :CF2 carbene.38–40
However, one also has to consider an alternative possibility that electrophilic fullerene molecules initially capture the CF2Cl− carbanions. In the resulting anionic intermediates, the negative charge is typically localized in ortho- and para-positions with respect to the CF2Cl addend. The following intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the ortho anionic center on CF2Cl displaces Cl− and completes formation of the CF2 bridge (see Fig. 4). This mechanism will be referred to as nucleophilic pathway.

The above two alternatives has been initially considered for a similar reaction between C60 and alkali metal trichloroacetates.41 According to the DFT estimates, the nucleophilic pathway is energetically more preferable than the carbene addition. In a further experimental and theoretical study of the same reaction with both C60 and C70, formation of C60/70(CCl3)− intermediates has indeed been confirmed through detection of the C60/70(CCl3)H products.42 The present reaction with sodium chlorodifluoroacetate has been studied, apart from C6033,34,43 and C70,24 also for the Cs-C70(CF3)8,35,44 Sc3N@C80, and Sc3N@C7845,46 compounds. Formation of two isomeric C70(CF3)8[CF2] adducts was interpreted in terms of concurrence of the nucleophilic and carbene pathways.44 In the Sc3N endohedral fullerenes, computational rationalization of the experimental results clearly favors the nucleophilic pathway.45,46 Although there is no direct verification of attachment of CF2Cl− to fullerenes, of note is formation of C60CF3− anions under refluxing C60 with CF3COOCs.47 Thus, the body of available evidence is mostly in favor of the nucleophilic pathway in the reaction of C60 and C70 fullerenes with alkali metal chlorodifluoroacetates.
In the present study, the reaction of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate with C70 gave three isomers of C70(CF2) in a ratio of 4:6:1, and a thorough chromatographic survey failed to detect any further isomeric products (see Table S1, Fig. 2(a)). These observations can be compared against the computational predictions for the two pathways in question. A detailed computational survey for CF2 addition to C70 can be found in our previous work.24 It predicts formation of four isomeric adducts, the three actually obtained ones plus one more at bond 2, in a ratio of 5:6:1:1. It consistent with HOMO and HOMO−1 density distributions in C70 fullerene (Fig. S10, ESI†). The lack of the fourth isomer in our experiment suggests that the alternative, nucleophilic pathway may be involved.
The key DFT estimates for formation of different isomeric structures via the nucleophilic pathway are summarized in Table 2 (note that the less stable C70(CF2) isomers are omitted). In the nucleophilic pathway, initial attachment of a CF2Cl− carbanion to the electrophilic fullerene is barrierless. The relative stability of the anionic intermediates correlates with the steric aspects of the C70 cage as can be revealed by the π-orbital axis vector (POAV) analysis.48 Indeed, exohedral attachment proceeds readier at stronger pyramidalized sites, and in C70, pyramidalization decreases when going from the polar region (a) to the equatorial belt (e).49 As has been shown in work,21 addition to the e-sites can be achieved only under extreme temperatures.

The barrier heights for CF2 bridge closure estimated for the gas phase with PBE exchange-correlation functional and for the solution phase with PBE0 and D-PCM corrections (Table 2) are in good agreement, the solution-phase value being some 20 kJ mol−1 lower. The activation energy values for transformation of the anionic intermediates a and b into isomer II of C70(CF2) and of the intermediate c into isomer I are comparable, but for isomer III the barrier is ca. 20–30 kJ mol−1 higher, which explains its lower abundance despite sufficient relative stability of the precursory intermediate d. One can attempt to model the C70(CF2) isomer ratios on the basis of the kinetic model (1) below which includes reversible addition of CF2Cl− to C70 fullerene followed by irreversible CF2 bridge closure. (1) (2) (3)
If barrierless formation of the anionic intermediates is effectively limited by low concentration of the active CF2Cl− anions, one can consider a quasi-steady-state approximation for the isomeric C70(CF2Cl)− intermediates and obtain eqn (2) and (3) above for the formation rate of different isomers of C70(CF2). The rate constants for the barrierless addition of CF2Cl− to C70 can be approximated as k1(i) = niA, where A is a frequency factor and ni – the number of equivalent carbon sites in C70 to give the corresponding C70(CF2Cl)− isomer, and the activation energy for the reverse process of CF2Cl− detachment can be taken equal to the binding energy BDE(C70–CF2Cl−).
The resulting eqn (3) predicts I:II:III isomeric ratios of 13:14:1 and 3:3:1 and very little yield of the 2-adduct at the PBE/tz2p and PBE/tz2p//PBE0/def2-svp/D-PCM the levels, respectively, at the reaction temperature of 453 K, in satisfactory agreement with the experimental ratio of 4:6:1. Thus, the experimental and theoretical data suggest the nucleophilic addition-substitution pathway of C70 fullerene difluoromethylenation favored by electron-withdrawing properties of C70.
Electronic and electrochemical properties of C70(CF2) isomers
Electronic spectra for the three isomers of C70(CF2) and related C70(CCl2) compounds are presented in Fig. 5. In the isomers II and III, CF2 insertion opens the C–C bond, and the initial 70 π-electrons all remain in the spherical π-system. Accordingly, there are only marginal differences from the spectrum of the parent C70, such as red-shifting of some bands by 10–20 nm. Similar observations have been reported previously for the other open CX2 derivatives of C70, the isomer of C70(CCl2) due to addition to bond 422 and C2v-C70(CH2) due to addition to bond 1.21 On the contrary, withdrawal of two electrons from the π-system in the closed isomer I notably alters the UV-Vis spectrum, similarly to the case of the respective isomer of C70(CCl2).22 One can observe blue-shifting of the absorption bands and disappearance of some of them in the range of 320–380 nm. For all three isomers of C70(CF2) the optical HOMO–LUMO gaps fall in the range of 1.7–1.8 eV (Table 4).

Electrochemical behavior of the isomers of C70(CF2) and of the parent C70 was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves for isomers I and II have been already reported in our earlier work,24 albeit within a narrower potential window (−2.1 to 0 V vs. Fc+/0) which covered only three reduction steps. Now we provide a more detailed study of all isomers within the range of –2.5 to 1.7 V vs. Fc+/0 (see Fig. 6) which encompasses four reduction steps and the first oxidation step. The potential values obtained are summarized in Table 3.

In pristine C70 and isomers I and II of C70(CF2), four one-electron reversible reduction steps are observed, evidencing stability of the respective anionic states within the CV timescale. In the [5,6]-open isomer III, however, only the first three reduction steps are reversible. They are followed by three irreversible features peaked at −2.08, –2.20, and −2.29 V vs. Fc+/0 without complementing oxidation peaks in the reverse scan. All reversible peaks duly demonstrate anodic/cathodic peak current ratios close to unity. In isomer II, the separation between the reduction peak and the respective reoxidation peak for the 1st and 2nd reduction steps is somewhat increased, reaching 0.10 V. For all the rest reversible peaks in all compounds, the separation is approximately 0.06–0.07 V.
The oxidation process is irreversible in all compounds. Its onset is observed at 1.07–1.17 V vs. Fc+/0 with peak potentials of 1.10–1.25 V vs. Fc+/0 (determined after deconvolution, see Table 3). Similarly to the other fullerene derivatives studied,50,51 irreversibility of oxidation is due to enhanced reactivity of the fullerene cations toward the electrolyte. Unlike pristine C70 and isomers I and II of C70(CF2) where the oxidation wave has a single maximum, in isomer III it shows splitting, the peak potentials being 1.10 and 1.20 V vs. Fc+/0. A further minor anodic peak at 0.93 V vs. Fc+/0 (marked with asterisk in Fig. 6) can be observed in the CV curve of the blank electrolyte and, therefore, is likely due to an electrolyte impurity. In general, upon modification of C70 with a CF2 group, the oxidation potential varies within ca. 0.1 V. In the isomer III it is the lowest and in the [6,6]-open isomer II – the highest.
The first reduction potentials in the open isomers II and III are positively shifted by 0.13 and 0.09 V with respect to C70, while in the closed isomer I there is virtually no shift. The electrochemical estimates for the LUMO and HOMO energy and the respective gap are listed in Table 4. The open isomers II and III demonstrate the lowest LUMO energy of −3.90 and −3.87 eV, i.e. the highest electron affinity, and the closed isomer I shares the value of −3.78 eV with C70. The DFT estimates for the electron affinity are in good agreement with the electrochemical data (Table 4). Enhanced electrophilicity is typical of the open isomers, both [6,6] and [5,6], which has been previously demonstrated for [6,6]-open C60(CF2), [6,6]-open/[6,6]-closed cis-2-C60(CF2)2, [6,6]-open C70(CF2), and [5,6]-open C70(CF3)8CF2.24,35,43,52

In the open isomers of C70(CF2) where no electrons are being withdrawn from the π-system, the LUMO is stabilized by the same 0.10–0.15 eV as in the other known open adducts. Contrariwise, the closed adduct I with its unchanged LUMO energy differs in its behavior from the other closed CR2 adducts where the LUMO energy is up-shifted by 0.1–0.3 eV, likely due to withdrawal of the bridgehead carbon atoms from the π-system.23,24,56,57 Perhaps, the difference results from the fact that the configuration of the electron-withdrawing CF2 group in the isomer I is actually rather soft, and the bond between the bridgehead atoms is almost broken. The 2nd and 3rd formal reduction potential in all isomers of C70(CF2) and the 4th potential in isomers I and II are all positively shifted with respect to those in C70 by 0.02–0.17 V (see Table 3). The largest shifts of 0.12, 0.17, and 0.08 V for the isomers I, II, and II, respectively, are observed at the second reduction step.
From the viewpoint of applicability in organic optoelectronics, it is of interest to compare the electron transport properties of the isomers of C70(CF2). The electron transfer rate correlates inversely with the intramolecular reorganization energy on assumption of the anionic geometry. In Table 4, we summarize the DFT estimates for reorganization energy in the compounds studied. The [5,6]-open isomer III has the lowest reorganization energy of 0.14 eV, less than 0.21 eV in the parent C70 and less than 0.17 eV in the isomer II. Note that isomer III also has the lowest HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.0 eV, which suggests its higher activity toward further functionalization.
Conclusions
A novel electron-withdrawing [5,6]-open isomer of C70(CF2) appears to be accessible via thermolysis of chlorodifluoroacetate salts in the presence of C70. It turns out that the reaction proceeds as a two-step nucleophilic cyclopropanation pathway. Experimental and theoretical characterization of the new isomer in comparison with the previously known ones suggest its enhanced reactivity due to a reduced HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.0 eV and reveal an advantageously low reorganization energy of 0.14 eV. This makes the [5,6]-open isomer III of C70(CF2) a particularly prospective compound for organic electronics.
