    , Accepted 12th November 2021First published on 12th November 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) phenylethyl ammonium (PEA+)-methyl ammonium (MA+) lead iodide ((PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7]) hybrid perovskite exists as temperature-dependent dimorphs exhibiting an ill-defined phase transition occurring over the 150–200 K range. Raman scattering, photoluminescence, optical absorbance and solid state MAS NMR spectroscopic methods are employed to investigate the structural complexity, disorder and structure/function of this system. The Raman and 1H MAS NMR data indicate that the lower bounds of the phase transition at ∼150 K are characterised by attenuated rotational modes and slower motional dynamics throughout the disordered MA+ organic sublattice, inducing a strengthening of the MA+⋯I hydrogen bonds and a 5 meV increase in the excitonic and photoluminescence energies. It is evident that different recombination mechanisms are dominant for the room temperature and low temperature phases reflecting the importance of MA+ dynamics in the optical properties of the material. Single crystal X-ray studies are unable to position the organic cations within the Pb2I7 framework; however, 1H/13C MAS NMR measurements describe elements of local structural disorder based on conformational isomerism within the PEA+ sublattice. Concomitant I− and Pb2+ migration and [Pb2I7]3− framework defects create stacking disorder, dislocations and dispersed octahedral tilting leading to additional disorder and distributed MA+ and PEA+ cation dynamics.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high performance and low cost for light harvesting applications.1–3 These materials can also be deployed as light emitting diodes (LEDs),1,4,5 X-ray and photo detectors,6,7 spintronics8 and lasing applications.9 The solar cell performance of AMX3 perovskites (A is an organic cation, usually MA = CH3–NH3+, M = Pb, Sn, X = I, Br, Cl or a mixture of them) has evolved much faster than other photovoltaic materials,1,10 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25% being achieved.11–13 However, poor moisture stability and degradation of the photoluminescence characteristics remain as significant obstacles to the fabrication of low-cost and long lifetime devices from 3D hybrid perovskite systems.1,8 In comparison, 2D perovskites have demonstrated improved stability and flexible chemical engineering possibilities for solar light-harvesting and LED applications.8,14–18 These materials have been found to be excellent candidates for light emitting diode (LED) applications due to tenability, high quantum efficiencies, and broadband emission.8,14–19
The crystal structures of 2D perovskites are derived from the cubic perovskite aristotype by slicing on the {100} planes and intercalating organic cations to yield a layered structure with corner-sharing MX6 octahedral blocks occupying the basal plane (Fig. 1). This yields the general formula R2(A)n−1MnX3n+1, where R is the long organic cation-spacer, A is a small organic (or inorganic) cation such as methylammonium (MA+), and n indicates the number of octahedral layers within each inorganic block.20 Introducing hydrophobic organic layers simultaneously provides protection from moisture and creates intrinsic quantum wells that widens the band gap and promotes strong excitonic properties due to quantum confinement.21–24
 Fig. 1  Generalized scheme of the crystal structure types comprising 2D perovskite systems. 
In general, the typical architecture of 2D hybrid perovskite systems relies on the electronic structure being directly controlled by the inorganic sublattice, while the organic cations provide more subtle steric influences.20,22,25 Previous work has reported that the top of the valence band is influenced by the Pb 6s and I 5p orbitals, while conversely the bottom of the conduction band by Pb 6p and I 5s orbitals.25 In particular, the Pb–I bond length within the PbI6 octahedron and Pb–I–Pb bridging angle between PbI6 octahedra correlate closely with the electronic structure and optical properties.22,26,27 Consequently, temperature driven polymorphism leads to abrupt changes in optical and electronic properties, and device performance, in these materials. For example, the 2D perovskite (PEA)2[PbI4] (n = 1, PEA = phenylethyl ammonium) system is structurally stable over a 10–340 K temperature range;28,29 however, in contrast, the 3D perovskite system MAPbI3 (n = ∞) undergoes two phase transitions over similar temperature ranges.30 Furthermore, hydrogen bonding between the methylammonium cations was shown to be extremely important in 3D perovskites as this significantly increases the overall stability and provides possibilities for tuning of the electronic states.31–34
The 2D (n = 2) perovskite system (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] is intermediate to MAPbI3 and (PEA)2[PbI4], and it possesses MA+ and PEA+ cations which are both capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Substantial ambiguity and uncertainty surrounds the complete ambient and low temperature single crystal structure determinations of the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system as the light elements are essentially invisible to the XRD technique.35,36 It is postulated that structural disorder throughout the organic substituents is responsible for the disorder, although this is yet to be established conclusively.36 This uncertainty precludes an understanding of the low temperature photophysical properties,37 and consequently the influence of hydrogen bonding in this process has not been thoroughly investigated. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a very sensitive probe for studying hydrogen atom vibrational modes in hybrid perovskite systems, with recent studies characterizing the vibrational interactions between the MA+ cation and halogen atoms in 3D perovskites.31,38
This study describes a low temperature Raman spectroscopic investigation of the N–H bond vibrations, particularly those related to the formation of N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds in (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7], to provide complementary information to single crystal X-ray diffraction where lighter elements evade detection. The absorption, emission and Raman vibrational modes of (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] over the 80–293 K temperature range have been analyzed, with a correlation of the MA+ cation vibrations and excitonic features revealing a broad phase transition occurring over a wide temperature of range between 150–200 K. This study also utilizes solid state 1H and 13C MAS NMR to investigate and constrain the structural disorder that influences the organic PEA+ and MA+ cations, and shows that the broad phase transition could be attributed to gradual thermal rearrangement of the stacking disorder of the PEA+ cations within the 2D interplanar channels, which also concomitantly disrupts the hydrogen bonding network.
Experimental
Synthesis
The synthesis procedure described previously by Stoumpos et al.21 was used to obtain crystalline (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7], however, the method was modified to include an excess of methyl ammonium iodide. Inorganic lead iodide (99.999%, trace metals basis, perovskite grade), phenyl ethyl amine (99%), 57% w/w non-stabilized aqueous HI solution, and 50% aqueous H3PO2 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, while methyl ammonium iodide was purchased from Dyesol. These reagents were used without purification unless otherwise stated in the associated procedure.
Phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide was prepared by slowly mixing the amine with a stoichiometric amount of hydroiodic acid in ethanol at 0 °C for 1 hour, after which the solvents were removed by rotary vacuum evaporation at 50 °C. Where necessary, excess ethanol was added to form an azeotropic mixture with water to remove the latter completely. The solid product was washed with diethyl ether to remove the remaining iodides. Finally, the ammonium salt was dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight (1.76 g; 83% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 7.78 (bs, 3 H, NH3), 7.32–7.20 (m, 5 H, ArH), 3.06–3.03 (m, 2 H, CH2), 2.88–2.84 (m, 2 H, CH2). 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 137.1, 128.6, 128.6, 126.7, 40.0, 32.8.
Then (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] (n = 2) was prepared. A two-necked round bottom flask was used to combine PbI2 powder (230 mg, 0.5 mmol), methyl ammonium (53 mg, 0.33 mmol) and phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide salts (125 mg, 0.5 mmol) with magnetic stirring. Methyl ammonium iodide was added with 30% excess. Subsequently, 57% w/w aqueous HI solution (2.0 mL mL) and 50% aqueous H3PO2 (0.20 mL) were added sequentially in a dropwise manner. The suspension was brought to reflux under flowing N2 with continuous stirring (30–60 min) to yield a clear, bright yellow solution. Stirring was discontinued and the solution cooled slowly to room temperature while red rectangular plates precipitated. The crystals were finally isolated by vacuum filtration, washed with copious amounts of diethyl ether, and thoroughly dried under vacuum for several hours.
Solid state 13C and 1H MAS NMR
All solid-state MAS NMR measurements were acquired at 18.8 T using a Bruker Avance III-800 spectrometer operating at 1H and 13C Larmor frequencies of 800.16 and 201.19 MHz, respectively. These measurements were undertaken using a Bruker 0.7 mm triple channel H/C/N ultrafast MAS probe which enabled a MAS frequency of 110 kHz throughout this study. The 1H MAS NMR data were acquired using single pulse methods which utilised a π/2 pulse length of 1.0 μs (calibrated using adamantane) and a recycle delay of 30 s. In contrast, the 1H–13C cross-polarisation (CP)MAS NMR data were measured using an initial 1H π/2 pulse time of 1.0 μs, a Hartmann–Hahn contact period (in the form of a CP ramp) of 2 ms, in conjunction with 1H decoupling fields of >100 kHz during data acquisition. Both 1H and 13C chemical shifts were both referenced against TMS as the primary IUPAC reference (δiso = 0.0 ppm) via a secondary solid adamantane reference (δiso = 1.9 ppm for 1H; δiso = 37.7 ppm for 13C). The 1H MAS NMR data were accurately simulated using the DMFit NMR software package to quantitatively estimate the relative proportions of the individual PEA+ and MA+ cations present.
Two-dimensional heteronuclear 1H–13C correlation data was achieved through the use of the inversely detected hCH HETCOR experiment utilising forward 13C–1H CP, evolution of the 13C magnetisation under fast MAS and high 1H decoupling conditions, and then reverse 13C–1H CP for detection of the 1H magnetisation. The preparatory 1H and 13C π/2 pulse lengths prior to the forward and reverse CP processes were both 1 μs in duration, while the forward and reverse CP ramps (contact periods) were both 2 ms. The 2D homonuclear 1H–1H NOESY data were acquired using mixing times of 100 and 300 ms, a recycle delay of 5 s, with each experiment acquiring 160 slices in the indirect F1 dimension. The 2D homonuclear 1H–1H single quantum-double quantum BABA recoupling experiment was performed using a single rotor synchronised recoupling loop of 9.1 μs, a double quantum evolution period of 15 μs, with 1280 slices comprising the indirect F1 dimension. All data were processed using the Bruker TopSpin (v 4.0.8) NMR data processing package. The 1H T1 relaxation times were measured using a saturation-recovery experiment. An initial pulse train of 100 π/2 pulses with a separation delay of 50 ms was used to achieve complete saturation prior to single pulse acquisition. The resulting data were deconvoluted and integrated using Dmfit simulation program.39 The resulting integrated intensity data from each 1H resonance was fitted with a single exponential function using OriginPro (2019) software to obtain the 1H T1 (spin–lattice) relaxation times.
Optical characterization
A WITec Alpha 300RAS confocal Raman microscope was used to record Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and optical absorption spectra. The 633 nm (red) line from an 8 mW He−Ne gas laser coupled to an Acton spectrometer with a diffraction grating of 1800 grooves mm−1 (1.3 cm−1 resolution) and a thermo-electrically cooled Andor CCD detector was chosen to avoid photoluminescence. The backscattered Raman signal passed through two 633 nm BragGrate Notch Filters (BNF) for effective laser line rejection. The blue line of a linearly polarized CW solid laser (457 nm) was chosen for PL measurements with the excitation power maintained below 0.8 μW to avoid detector photo-degradation and saturation. A halogen lamp (15 V, 150 W, 3100 K) served as the white light source for the absorption measurements. A long working distance 20× microscope objective (spot size of ∼2 μm) was used for the low temperature experiments. All data were measured between 293 K and 78 K using a nitrogen gas flow cryostat.
Powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction
Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data were measured using a Shimadzu XRD-600040 diffractometer in θ–2θ scan mode with a measurement rate of 1 degree min−1. Cu-Kα (1.5406°) X-ray line was chosen as a source while using scintillation NaI detector. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker X8 CCD diffractometer using a graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα source (λ = 0.71073 Å) equipped with a CCD detector at room temperature. A full sphere collection was undertaken ranging from 2.325° to 29.000°. A total of 9178 reflections were observed of which 7388 had an intensity above the threshold limit of I > 2 s−1 (I); these reflections were used to fit the structural model in the P1 triclinic space group. Data reduction and absorption corrections were performed with SAINT and SADABS respectively. The motif of the inorganic sublattice was determined by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures on F2 using the Bruker SHELXL-2018 package. The location of the organic MA+ and PEA+ moieties could not be determined.
DFT computation
First principle calculations, including atomic structure optimization, band structure, and phonon frequencies simulation, were based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code was used, employing the previously reported crystal structure35 as the initial parameters. The exchange correlation potential was described using the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).40 The Brillouin zone was sampled by a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh using Monkhorst–Pack (MP) method. The energy convergence for the relaxation was chosen to be less than 10−5 eV Å−1. The newly developed vdW density functional (vdW-DF2) was deployed to account for nonlocal van der Waals interactions.41
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The formation of the 2D (n = 2) (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] phase was confirmed by powder XRD analysis of the horizontally oriented platelets shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). These data exhibit reflections that are consistent with results previously reported by Peng et al.42 An additional single crystal X-ray structure determination was conducted in order to obtain the accurate atomic coordinates. A partial structural solution with only the Pb and I atoms being located resulted in an unusually high R1 value of 0.13 and GooF of 2.44. The refined lattice parameters, positional coordinates, and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters are reported in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†). The organic atoms could not be located due to disorder in the organic sublattice. The highest q peak with an intensity of 13 electrons occurs at a distance of 1.69 Å from PB1 site. Splitting the PB1 site reduces the site occupancy factor by ∼5%. Similarly, I5 has a q peak at a distance of 1.65 Å having an intensity corresponding to ∼4%. The distance of 1.7 Å is lesser than the Pb–I bond distance of >3.1 Å, excluding the possibility of a presence of another atom so close to PB1 site. Detection of positional disorder at Pb and I sites with a distance of 1.7 Å in the same direction strongly suggests the presence of stacking dislocations at the 4–5% level. Stacking dislocations within the inorganic sublattice are attributed to the positional and conformational disorder in the organic sublattice accommodating the MA+ and PEA+ cations. The I and Pb Ueq values in Table S1 (ESI†) range from 0.053–0.063 Å3 and 0.0336–0.0334 Å3, respectively, indicating that the halogen atoms are comparatively more disordered. From Fig. S2 (ESI†), positions I8 and I9 protruding perpendicularly out of the PbI6 plane exhibit the highest displacements, suggesting that this positional irregularity in the I species defining the interplanar channels is directly associated with the disorder perturbing the organic sublattice.
A characterisation of the disorder within the organic sublattice can be achieved using high resolution solid state 1H and 13C MAS NMR which is very sensitive to the short-range chemical environment defining each atomic species. Fig. 2 shows the 1H ultra-fast MAS NMR data (υr = 110 kHz) from the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system presented with the spectral simulation and deconvolution, and the assigned 1H chemical shifts representing the aromatic, amine and aliphatic moieties are summarized in Table 1. These data were acquired under fully relaxed conditions thus allowing a quantitative estimate of the H speciation. As observed from the 1H shift assignments in Table 1, a quantitative simulation of the 1H MAS NMR spectrum in Fig. 2 can be preserved only when a distribution of chemical shifts is introduced for the methylene positions 5 and 6. These assignments were corroborated by the 2D heteronuclear and homonuclear MAS NMR data exhibited in Fig. 3. The 2D 1H–13C hCH HETCOR data displayed in Fig. 3(a) shows the basic heteronuclear correlations expected for the aromatic, amine and aliphatic species comprising the PEA+ and MA+ cations. However, an expansion of the 1H and 13C aliphatic special regions (see Fig. 3(b)) indicates that the broader 1H correlations are associated with both the α-CH2 (H position 5) and β-CH2 (H position 6) clearly span two well-defined H chemical environments. As represented in Fig. 2 and 3(b), it can be deduced that positional disorder characterizing the ethylamine side chain distributes the 1H intensity from the α-CH2 moiety between H positions 5 and 5′; similarly, the 1H intensity from the β-CH2 moiety is distributed between the H positions 6 and 6′. From the 1H chemical shift assignments presented in Table 1, it is inferred that this rationalisation results in a PEA+:MA+ cation ratio of ∼2:1 which is consistent with the nominal (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] compositional stoichiometry.

 Fig. 3  Solid state 2D MAS NMR studies undertaken (υ0 = 800.16 MHz, υr = 110 kHz) including, (a) the 2D heteronuclear 1H–13C hCH HETCOR data, (b) an expansion of the aliphatic region of the 2D hCH HETCOR data highlighting the positional disorder in the ethylammonium substituent of the PEA+ cation, (c) the 2D homonuclear 1H–1H DQ/SQ BABA data highlighting through-bond associations, and (d)–(f) the 2D homonuclear 1H–1H NOESY data acquired with mixing times of 10, 100 and 300 ms, respectively, disclosing the through-space associations. 
The 1H ultra-fast MAS NMR data of Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) also indicates the presence of structural H2O evidenced by the broad upfield resonances at δ ∼ 1.4 ppm. As observed in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the hCH HETCOR data establishes an absence of connectivity to any aliphatic or aromatic carbon species. Furthermore, the highly shielded (upfield) shift suggests that these H2O position(s) that are distant from the PEA+ or MA+ amine cations, thus avoiding H-bonding arrangements that would introduce a deshielded (downfield) 1H chemical shift. Previous studies have demonstrated that 2D perovskites exhibit a propensity for H2O absorption.1,8 While the highly shielded 1H shift shown in Fig. S2(a) and S3(a) (ESI†) suggests that these H2O molecules reside in the inter-planar spacing between the aromatic rings of the PEA+ cations, other positions such as those near the [Pb2I7]3− framework or within the cubooctahedral cage accommodating the MA+ cation may also be possible.
The positional disorder exhibited by the PEA+ cation emanates from different structural conformers associated with the positioning of the ethylamine side-chain, as shown by the 1D 1H MAS NMR and 2D 1H–13C hCH HETCOR data (see Fig. 2(a) and 3(a), (b), respectively). These conformers differ markedly in the proximity of the amine functionality with respect to the aromatic ring. PEA+ conformer 1 positons the amine functionality at a maximum distance away from the aromatic ring, while PEA+ conformer 2 suggests that the aliphatic side-chain and amine moiety wrap back towards the aromatic ring introducing much closer contact. Direct evidence for this conformational isomerism is provided by both the 2D homonuclear 1H–1H double quantum/single quantum (DQ/SQ) BAck-to-BAck (BABA) and 2D homonuclear 1H–1H NOESY experiments.43,44
The former experiment provides short-range information that relies on the selection of DQ dipolar coherence. As depicted in Fig. 3(c), the 2D 1H–1H BABA data show correlations (highlighted in red) that emphasize the expected short range correlations that are fundamental to the structure of the PEA+ and MA+ cations; however, this data also reveals evidence for the occurrence of conformer 2 with a short range aromatic-NH3+(PEA) correlation between the 1H shifts at δ 7.6 ppm and δ 6.6 ppm.
In contrast, the 2D homonuclear 1H–1H NOESY data of Fig. 3(d)–(f) are sensitive to longer range dipolar through-space interactions between nuclear spins. The spatial sensitivity limits of the NOESY technique are ∼2–3 times that of the BABA experiment with the NOESY experiment able to detect correlated dipolar interactions out to ∼6 Å,45,46 thus making it a powerful complement to the BABA approach. Due to its elongated arrangement of the pendant ethylamine sidechain into the free volume towards the 2D perovskite surface bisecting the PbI6 octahedra, the PEA-NH3+ moiety of conformer 1 is unlikely to experience a significant homonuclear 1H–1H dipolar interaction with the phenyl group anchoring the molecule. Although not measured in the 2D 1H–1H NOESY data utilizing a short 10 ms mixing time (see Fig. 3(f)), experiments employing longer mixing times of 100 and 300 ms detect weak-moderately strong intermolecular off-diagonal correlations between the PEA-NH3+ moiety (δ 6.6 ppm) of conformer 1 and the CH3 group of MA+ (δ 3.1 ppm) in the next-nearest-neighbor cuboctahedral cavity (see the data in Fig. 3(e) and (f), respectively). Such a spatial relationship must be confined to be within the ∼6 Å detection limit of this experiment. This scenario differs markedly from the evidence supporting the local structure of PEA conformer 2 where intense intramolecular off-diagonal correlations are exhibited in the 2D 1H–1H NOESY data of 3s Fig. 2(d)–(f) relating the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons (δ 7.6 ppm) with the PEA-NH3+ moiety (δ 6.6 ppm) for mixing times as short as 10 ms. These observations emphasize the strong homonuclear 1H–1H dipolar interaction between these proton species, and corroborate the 2D 1H–1H BABA data above (see Fig. 3(c)). These findings contrast with those from low field (2.35 T)/broadline 1H T1 relaxation measurements and mid-field (9.4 T) 13C T1 relaxation measurements on the more ordered (PEA)2[PbI4] system which highlights no detectable disorder in the NH3+ position of the PEA+ cation.47,48
The structural disorder based solely around discrete PEA+ conformers outlined above is only a simplistic representation of the total disorder (and disruption to the H-bonding network) characterizing the PEA+ cations in the organic sublattice. As illustrated in Fig. S3(a) and (b) (ESI†), realistic descriptions must accommodate more complex arrangements such as in-plane and out-of-plane conformers, head–head and head–tail stacking, and orientational stacking faults that are underpinned by the basic PEA+ cation conformers proposed above. The breadth of this phase transition suggests that it is comprised of thermal re-ordering processes within a highly disordered network comprised of distributions of these structural realizations within the PEA+ cation network. This is supported by the 1H T2 values provided in Table 1 which are 3–4 orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding T1 values, thus suggesting that the correlation times of reorientation are slow. As shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†) for a dominant dipolar relaxation mechanism, the divergent T1 and T2 values are characteristic of correlation times that are on the slow motion side of the extreme narrowing limit in a regime normally associated with polymers and macromolecules. The disordered PEA+ cations in the 2D channels form a highly occluded network lacking cooperative modes of fast motion. Furthermore, the broad 1D 1H MAS NMR resonances of Fig. 2(a) and 2D 1H–1H MAS NMR contours observed within Fig. 3(c) and (d) are influenced by widespread chemical shift dispersion. It is important to note that, although these measurements are performed under ultra-fast MAS conditions (υr = 110 kHz), this dispersion is unable to be averaged (and resonances further narrowed) by these ultra-fast MAS frequencies. The extent of the disorder represented in the 1H MAS NMR data, coupled with the very broad second-order phase transition characteristics identified in the DSC data, are consistent with the XRD results which are limited to the location of the inorganic framework positions only.
Optical properties
An exfoliated (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] sample exhibits strong excitonic photoluminescence and absorbance at room temperature due to intrinsic crystallographic quantum confinement (see Fig. 4(a)).49,50 The optical images are presented as ESI,† in Fig. S5. The photoluminescence (PL) data in Fig. S6(a)–(c) (ESI†) were simulated using asymmetric pseudo-Voigt peaks which accounted for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening,51 while Fig. S6(d)–(f) (ESI†) shows that the evolution of the excitonic absorption edge was monitored by applying a linear fit to the lower energy slope of the optical absorbance (OA) spectra.
 Fig. 4  Photophysical and thermal data from the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system including, (a) photoluminescence (PL, 457 nm excitation) and optical absorbance (OA) of (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] measurements acquired over a 93–293 K temperature range showing normalized PL and OA evolution under decreasing temperature, (b) plot of the PL peak maximum (purple) and the excitonic absorption edge (cyan) versus temperature, (c) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showing the gradual phase change in the temperature range from ∼200 to 150 K (the shape of the curve suggests the second order phase transition), (d) plot of integrated PL intensity (logarithmic scale) verses 1/T as fitted by eqn (1), and (e) plot of intensity integrated PL intensity (logarithmic scale) versus laser excitation power (logarithmic scale) measured at room temperature (pink) and at 80 K (green) with the slope of the linear fits reflecting the power coefficient of the dependence and the recombination mechanism. 
As observed in Fig. 4 and Fig. S7 (ESI†), the PL and the OA exhibit no abrupt intensity or frequency changes during cooling above 200 K apart from the gradual narrowing of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) which is ascribed to phonon population depletion. The excitonic absorption energy is almost unchanged during cooling from room temperature before a distinct blueshift of ∼5 meV below 200 K, and it shows continuous redshift below 150 K (see Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S7(a), ESI†). An earlier study of (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] reported a small continuous red shift in absorption between 10–293 K with absorption peak asymmetry providing inconclusive evidence of a phase transition.37,52 The integrated PL intensity exhibited in Fig. 4(d) generally increases during cooling with a discontinuity at ∼200 K appearing concomitantly with the excitonic anomaly. A similar evolution of the optical properties was observed under decreasing and increasing temperature regimes (see Fig. 4 and Fig. S7, ESI,† respectively). The combined data provided by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results of Fig. 4c and the optical spectroscopy provides corroborating evidence of a very broad and diffuse second-order phase transition phenomenon extending over the 150–200 K range.
Photoluminescence decreases with heating due to thermal quenching,18,53 whereby the integrated PL intensity conforms to:29,54 (1)where I0 is PL intensity at 0 K, Ea is the activation energy and α is a ratio of radiative and non-radiative lifetimes at 0 K. The fitting of the logarithmic integrated PL intensity vs. inverse temperature is shown in Fig. 4(d). The activation energy of 250(40) meV measured from the room temperature phase was much larger than the value of 125(10) meV elucidated from the low temperature polymorph. This latter energy value is significantly smaller than reported exciton binding energy value of 170 meV.52 These results, together with the significant reduction in PL intensity at 200 K, suggest that the transformation into the low temperature phase introduces non-radiative pathways through the formation of longer-lived defect structures via reduced I− and Pb2+ migration throughout the framework.29,43 Both Pb2+ and (in particular) I− defects can be associated with stacking faults influencing some elements of the PEA+ cation disorder in the 2D channels, and also introduces distributions within the shape, size and tilting of the cuboctahedral cavity thus affecting the MA+ dynamics. These assertions corroborate the findings of the 1H MAS NMR study and shape the structure/function relationship of the material. At lower extremes of the phase transition (∼150 K), reduced ionic migration throughout the inorganic [Pb2I7]3− framework is directly associated with attenuated rotational modes and slower motional dynamics throughout the disordered organic sublattice.
PL intensity is proportional to excitation intensity with a power law coefficient k, I(PL) ∼ Pk, where the coefficient k = 1 describes free exciton recombination, k = 1.5 describes trapped exciton recombination, and k = 2 relates to bimolecular free carrier recombination.55,56 Therefore, defect-related recombination pathways can be examined using excitation intensity dependent experiments. Fig. 4(e) shows the log–log graphs of integrated PL intensity of (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] with excitation power having slopes of 1.5 at room temperature, consistent with non-radiative defects, and 1 at low temperature, suggesting an absence of defects. However, it is noted that defects may not be activated at 80 K.
Methylammonium dynamics
To further investigate the structural evolution of the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system, a temperature dependent Raman spectroscopic study was undertaken. These results are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The larger wavenumber bands can be attributed to molecular vibrations of the PEA+ and MA+ cations, while the smaller wavenumbers emanate from the inorganic sublattice as reported for the MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 systems.10,31 This interpretation was supported by direct comparison with the Raman data from the (PEA)2[PbI4] and (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] systems (see Fig. 5a and Fig. S8, ESI†) that allows the unambiguous assignment of MA+ bands (910 (ρ MA), 970 (υ C-N), 1247 (ρ MA),1478 cm−1 (δ NH3)), with the remainder contributed by the PEA+ cation. The vibrational modes are illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Over the 78–293 K temperature range, neither the PEA+ nor υ C–N MA+ bands split or change intensity, in contrast to the NH3+ vibrations. The relative intensity of the 910 cm−1 (ρ MA+) band increases continuously below ∼200 K, while the intensity of the bands at 1247cm−1 (ρ MA+) and 1478 cm−1 (δ NH3+) increase below ∼200 K (see Fig. 5). It is important to note that the C–N bond stretching frequency and intensity do not undergo any changes with temperature, confirming that only one end (rather than both ends) of the MA+ cation is involved in the phase transition. Thus, spectral changes involving the NH3+ bending or rocking vibrations demonstrate that the phase transition is strongly associated with the NH3+ moiety and its participation within the hydrogen bonding network.

As shown in Fig. 5(c), further evidence of a low temperature dimorph of (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] is observed by low wavenumber Raman spectroscopy. It is notable that distinct bands below <150 cm−1 persist even at room temperature as the PEA+ cations are relatively static and do not participate in large amplitude vibrations. This observation is consistent with the 1H MAS NMR study that is characterized by broad resonance linewidths and short T2s from slower motional correlation times and occluded structural disorder. Furthermore, this feature is in sharp contrast to that observed in 3D perovskites which only exhibit broad Raman bands due to dynamic MA+ and FA+ disorder,10,31,57 emphasizing that the presence of the PEA+ cations induce a more rigid inorganic sublattice with distinct low wavenumber Raman bands. The bands below ∼30 cm−1 are attributed to PbI6 tilting modes, those below 80 cm−1 are assigned to I–Pb–I bending modes, the peaks between 80 cm−1 and 150 cm−1 are assigned to Pb–I stretches, while those bands <50 cm−1 cannot be assigned unique Raman modes. Nevertheless, temperature dependent features are evident in Fig. 5(c). For instance, the feature at ∼30 cm−1 is distinct only after cooling, while the mode at 100 cm−1, assigned to Pb–I stretching in the PbI6 octahedron, develops a splitting. This phenomenon is caused by octahedral distortion resulting in the improved peak resolution due to the formation of a more ordered and rigid structure; this assertion is supported by increased hydrogen bonding at low temperatures.58 These temperature dependent features in the variable temperature Raman data of Fig. 5(c) infer a discontinuous evolution of crystal structure at around 200 K that is consistent with the other evidence of the ill-defined phase transition.
The 1H MAS NMR data presented in Table 1 corroborates the Raman findings reported above. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the octahedral tilting induces a reduction in the I–Pb–I angle (labelled α) to ∼155°; this represents a substantial distortion from 179° measured from the MAPbI3 structure at room temperature.59 This octahedral tilt distorts the bond lengths, bond angles and shape of the cuboctahedral cavities accommodating the MA+ cations. The volume of the cavity, containing MA+ cations, decreases from ∼80 Å3 in the tetragonal phase of the 3D MAPbI3 to ∼50 Å3 in (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] (Fig. S10, ESI†). In this case the degrees of freedom available for the MA+ cation motion become restricted, thus resulting in altered MA+ dynamics in comparison to MAPbI3. The MA+ cation dynamics in MAPbI3 at room temperature has been shown to undergo ultra-fast reorientation using quasi elastic neutron scattering, GHz spectroscopy, 14N NMR, and electron diffraction, with the resulting rotational correlation times (τrot) residing in the picosecond range.60–62 The reorientation dynamics of MA+ in MAPbI3 have also been investigated using 1H T1 relaxation experiments,59,61,63,64 with Kubicki et al. reporting the 1H T1 of the CH3 and NH3+ moieties to be ∼16 s when measured at high field (21.1 T, 900 MHz).64 In the present study, similar high field 1H T1 measurements (18.8 T, 800 MHz) were undertaken on (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7], with the summarized results of Table 1 and Fig. 6 describing significantly shorter 1H T1s characterizing the MA+ and PEA+ cation dynamics within this system. As represented in Fig. 6, the saturation-recovery T1 data have been fitted with single exponential functions, with all measured 1H T1 values falling within a narrow range of ∼2.4–3.1 s.
The different T1 ranges characterizing the MAPbI3 and (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] systems, and the diverse motional regimes that they represent, are highlighted in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). While the MA+ cation dynamics of the 3D (n = ∞) MAPbI3 perovskite (characterised by longer T1s and no octahedral tilting) places it in fast motional regime on the right of the extreme narrowing limit, the MA+ and PEA+ cation dynamics of the 2D (n = 2) (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] perovskite (characterised by shorter T1s, divergent T1 and T2 values and significant octahedral tilting) reside on the opposite side in the slow motional regime. The octahedral tilting underpinning the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] framework is a key feature of the overall system. In addition to the smaller distorted cuboctahedra environments inducing restricted MA+ cation dynamics, I− and Pb2+ defects (and associated ion migration) introduce additional framework disorder including distributions within the octahedral tilting, dislocations, and misalignment within the 2D channels, which directly translate into the disordered PEA+ environments reported above. These effects have been proposed in previous structural, computational, and photophysical studies on similar 2D hybrid perovskite systems.65,66
The optical and Raman spectroscopic results consistently demonstrate a broad phase change commencing at 200 K which is attributed to MA+ dynamics and its hydrogen bonding state. In particular, the Raman study provides unambiguous evidence that part of the evolution of the organic sublattice with temperature involves the vibrations of the NH3+ constituent of the MA+ cation. These spectral changes are manifested from MA+ ordering through hydrogen bonding that promotes harmonic vibrations and a more rigid structure, thus yielding more intense and narrower bands as demonstrated from previous studies for 3D perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Br, I).10,31,43,67 Nevertheless, the 1H MAS NMR study indicates that the timescale of MA+ motion in (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] is much slower than that in MAPbI3 by approximately four orders of magnitude; as outlined above, this is governed by distortion of the cuboctahedral cavities. In contrast, the PEA+ component of the organic sublattice also contributes to the broad phase change behavior through different thermally driven mechanisms of reorientation. It represents a connected organic network of highly occluded and disordered cations that also participates in slow molecular reorientation and is also underpinned by the 1H MAS NMR data. The contrasting influences dominating the different parts of the organic sublattice suggest that the observed broad phase transition of Fig. 4(b) is highly inhomogeneous, and the overall thermal response probably represents a superposition of discrete thermal rearrangement processes pertaining to the MA+ and PEA+ cations.
Previous single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements on the (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system36 and those undertaken within this study, have been unable to elucidate a structural determination of the complete system. While longer-range periodic elements defining the inorganic [Pb2I7]3+ framework can be determined, the short-range structural detail yielding the exact coordinates of the MA+ or PEA+ cations is hindered by the structural disorder within the organic sublattice, as demonstrated by the solid state NMR technique. This precludes a measure of the hydrogen-bonding lengths influencing the MA+ cations and further corroboration of the effects observed in the Raman data. A full DFT computational analysis of the statistical distributions of structural realisations generated to simulate the disorder within the organic sublattice is being undertaken to support the spectroscopic and thermal response observations reported for the first time.
Conclusions
In this work, the significant structural disorder characterizing the MA+ and PEA+ cations constituting the organic sublattice within the 2D (n = 2) (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] system as reported by the 1H and 13C MAS NMR technique has been presented with photophysical and Raman spectroscopic studies characterizing this material. The structural disorder described in this work represents the first rationalization of disorder for 2D hybrid perovskites, and it corroborates the partial structural solution (inorganic framework only) obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the very broad phase transition as exhibited by the DSC data. The phase transition observed to occur over a 200–150 K temperature range is probably an inhomogeneous process involving the rearrangement of both the MA+ and PEA+ cations in discrete thermally driven processes. While the 1H MAS NMR data demonstrate that the MA+ dynamics in 2D (PEA)2(MA)[Pb2I7] is slow in comparison to its 3D MAPbI3 counterpart (by approximately four orders of magnitude), the Raman study shows that the MA+ hydrogen bonding network is strengthened over this temperature range. The importance of MA+ dynamics over this temperature range on the changing photophysical and optical properties was also emphasized for this 2D perovskite system. In addition, the 1H MAS NMR data determines that the PEA+ cations are also in a slow motional regime, and the structural disorder comprised of conformational isomers and stacking and orientational dislocations produce a highly occluded network down the 2D channels that also structurally readjusts over this temperature range. Furthermore, the ability for these 2D channel structures to absorb water was observed, thus potentially augmenting the disorder phenomenon throughout the PEA+ cation network.
