    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 7th November 2022AbstractThe nature of perovskite films ensures the viable concern of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), leading to both satisfactory stability and adequate photovoltaic performance. In this work, a polymer hybrid of quaternary ammonium chloride functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (PHQACl-CN), a promising material with a structure consisting of a cationic ammonium group and an anionic chloride group, is integrated into perovskite. A satisfactory amount of PHQACl-CN in the perovskite favors good crystal morphology, and represses the generation of surface or point defects by sequestering counter ions and reducing ion movement. Experiments reveal that PHQACl-CN establishes strong hydrogen bonding interactions with perovskite, reducing charge carrier recombination. As a consequence, perovskite films with enlarged grain size and lacking pinholes are achieved, which show enhanced performance and stability. The most efficient PSC processed with PHQACl-CN3 shows a PCE of 18.21% with improved stability, where 82% of the original efficiency is maintained after 320 h of shelf storage, and over 73% of the original efficiency is retained after a continuous 200 h of thermal handling at 85 °C under moisture levels of 45–50%RH in air. The PHQACl-CN-patterned perovskite films are encouraging for utilization in PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskites have revolutionized photovoltaic device structure, due to their optoelectrical qualities,1–3 high power conversion efficiency (PCE)4,5 and low-temperature treatment, inspiring their entrance into the market. Despite the rapid rise in the PCEs of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their instability remains a challenge. So far, moisture, oxygen, high temperatures and light conditions have all been noted as sources of instability in PSC devices.4,6 Considering the fragility of perovskite films, their exposure to moist conditions significantly accelerates their degradation.7,8 Therefore, establishing an efficient and stable perovskite film is an important goal in solar cell research. Until now, many attempts have been proposed to tune the properties of perovskite, through the inclusion of various materials, typically following the concepts of morphology regulation,9,10 passivation of surface defects,11,12 and design of PSCs with strengthened stability. In addition to tackling the instability of PSCs, the introduction of a polymeric matrix into a perovskite film can provide a device with considerable performance. Consequently, there have been several studies exploring the use of polymers, including hydrophobic natural polymers,13,14 polymers containing photogenerating sites,15 solvent-free deposition polymers,16 and polymeric hybrid materials.8,17 Such polymers allow for the fabrication of reasonably durable solar cell devices, which can meet market demands. On the basis of these studies, the introduction of a suitable amount of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in perovskite to create an operationally stable polymer-derived solar cell has been proposed.18 The use of PEO during the treatment of perovskite leads to a device with an interesting PCE and great duplicability, together with noticeable resistance when exposed to an operating environment of ≈55%RH, compared with the reference PSC structure. Regarding the hydrophilic nature of polymers, common additives can dramatically influence the passivation of defects at grain boundaries (GBs), through their coordination bonding with uncoordinated Pb2+.11,19 As formerly investigated, introducing the well-designed capping ligand (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) can also lead to the passivation of defects, thus enhancing device stability. The amino groups (–NH2) of APTES bond to the surface of perovskite.20 As such, constructing perovskite-based materials using amine or ammonium groups is as an eligible way for improving the stability and surface qualities of perovskite films, towards producing high-quality solar cells.21 For example, integrating a double-component system of methylammonium acetate (MAAc) and thio-semicarbazide (TSC) has improved device stability.22
Furthermore, a properly designed PSC, containing quaternary ammonium halide anions and cations, can enhance the stability of the solar cell when exposed to moist air.11 The development of environmentally friendly photovoltaic polymers that are accessible, highly efficient, and long-lasting has received significant attention.23 Among these polymers, polystyrene, poly(vinylbenzyl)s, poly(phenylene oxide), poly(aryl ether sulfone)s, and their derivatives have been proven to be beneficial materials for application in operational solar cells.24–27 The treatment temperature, strategic use of additive, type of solvent, and environmental humidity have been reported to be influential parameters when manipulating thin films.14,28 Applying a high concentration of polysulfones can negatively affect the hydrophilic and rough features of the formed films, preventing their further involvement in polymer-driven device operations.8,19,29 Several studies confirm that crosslinking strategies24 and incorporating substantial nanofiller material components into the polymer matrix11,24,30 can enhance material stability, and can lead to other notable physical attributes and good performance.8,19,31 Therefore, the strategic exploration of relevant polymer materials rendering defect-passivation processes is crucial to fabricate thin films with considerable stability and efficiency.
Hence, we propose a specific polymer hybrid of quaternary ammonium chloride functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (PHQACl-CN), enabling the enhancement of both the PCE and stability of PSC by inhibiting charge recombination. PHQACl-CN has been chosen for forming high-quality perovskite due to its unique merits. The PQACl polymeric substituent was used to create a perovskite film consisting of a hydrophilic unit containing quaternary ammonium groups and a hydrophobic part. Meanwhile, a C3N4-based nanofilling material was used as a functional group provider, including amino (–NH2) and imino (–CN–) groups, strengthening the chemical bonding within particles and further improving the electrochemical properties. PQACl polymer hybrid materials show good thermal stability, and can tolerate the common temperatures used for perovskite film annealing. (1) PHQACl polymer materials show good thermal stability, and can tolerate the common temperatures used for perovskite film annealing. Meanwhile, their appropriate solubility in various solvents leads to a uniform solution, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†), positively affecting the formation of perovskite film and consequently restricting a reduction in efficiency. (2) PQACl polymer materials exhibit an adequately hydrophilic structure to supply an elegant coverage of the perovskite film. (3) PHQACl-CN establishes an outstanding intermolecular interaction with perovskite to attain a reliable device with enhanced charge transfer and good stability. As investigated in our previous study,32 PQACl derived-polymer materials exhibit promising chemical structures (Fig. S1, ESI†) and good solubility behavior (Table S1, ESI†), as well as good thermal stability (Fig. S2, ESI†), acceptable morphology (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the existence of a polymer backbone and functional groups (Fig. S4, ESI†). Inspired by the polymer structure of PQACl and its functional group activity, including cationic quaternary ammonium and anionic chloride species, this polymer is a promising material for PSC development. In light of this, the designed PHQACl-CN materials are responsible for suppressing the cation defects derived from the evaporation of MA+ during PSC construction, while the chloride groups passivate the anion defects occurring from iodide ion vacancies. As indicated, introducing chlorine ions is regarded as a viable approach for inhibiting the generation of halide vacancies owing to the strong binding strength between Pb2+ and Cl−.33,34 Based on this, there is no doubt about the quality of the intended films when further exploring their photovoltaic parameters. We evaluate the impact of PHQACl-CN integration on the properties of the perovskite films, particularly the morphology and transmittance traits, along with the stability and performance aspects of the obtained PSCs. Consequently, perovskite integrated with PHQACl-CN3 showed a high PCE of 18.21%, and maintains over 82% of this performance after 320 h when exposed to a relative humidity of 20–30%. In addition, this polymer hybrid perovskite film was used to create a device with good thermal stability at 85 °C in moist air of 45–50%RH, retaining ≈73% of its original PCE after 200 h.
Experimental section
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The FTO glass substrates are consecutively cleaned by ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone, ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 15 min, and then dried at 100 °C. After that, the FTO glass substrates were treated with ultraviolet (UV)-ozone in an oven for 20 min. After the cleaning procedures, a compact TiO2 layer was coated on FTO substrates at a rate of 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing treatment at 450 °C (heating rate: 2 °C min−1) for 30 min to generate an electron-transport layer (ETL). PHQACl-CN or PQACl materials were stirred at 70 °C prior to use, for achieving viable perovskite-polymer hybrid solutions, as detailed in the (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, equal molar proportions of PbI2 and MAI were dissolved in the aforementioned PHQACl-CN or PQACl-DMF/DMSO solutions under stirring at 70 °C for 2 h to boost the interactions between the ions (Pb2+, MA+, and I−) contributed by the perovskite precursor (MAPbI3) and various interesting species of PHQACl-CN, including imine (–CN–) and amine (–NH2) groups, polymer of quaternary ammonium (PQA+) and chloride ions (Cl−). The perovskite thin films were acquired by a two-step spin-coating procedure using 80 µL of the obtained PHQACl-CN-perovskite solutions on cleaned substrates at 2000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s, consecutively, with a quick drop of 240 µL of ethyl acetate (EA) anti-solvent at 14 s before the end of the process. Then, the perovskite-coated substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h. The hole transport layer (HTL), termed as Spiro-OMeTAD solution, was obtained by stirring 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 µL of TBP and 17.5 µL of Li-TFSI (520 mg Li-TSFI dissolved in 1 mL ACN) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (CB). Next, 60 µL of the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The fabrication of these solar cells was finally achieved by thermally evaporating the Ag electrode of approximately 100 nm and an effective area of 0.06 cm2. Each PSC device was fabricated under ambient conditions at room temperature (22–25 °C) and 20–30%RH.

Results and discussion
The influence of polymeric integration on the perovskite fabrication process was assessed using FTIR, by analyzing the vibrations of perovskite thin films integrated with sCN3, PQACl3, and PHQACl-CN3. The FTIR spectra, illustrated in Fig. 1b and c, show a new weak vibration at 1116 cm−1 in the perovskite film with PQACl3, indicating the presence of the stretching vibration of OSO,35 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Like most other spectra of nanofilling materials obtained using concentrated sulfuric acid treatment,36,37 two new peaks occurred at 1082 cm−1 and 1141 cm−1 in the perovskite integrated with sCN3 or PQACl, undoubtedly indicating the successful inclusion of SO and S–O groups in the perovskite film, respectively (Fig. S5c and d, ESI†). These data indicate the effective interactions between the perovskite and PQA in the integrated polymer, leading to the formation of an amine complex structure,38 as shown in Fig. 1b and c, and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Peaks at 1581 cm−1 and 1483 cm−1 are present in the perovskite films with PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3, corresponding to vibrations of the aromatic skeleton of PQACl, meaning that these perovskite films contain an additional polymer backbone. Again, this shows that the perovskite film integrated with PHQACl-CN3 exhibits competitive properties for stable solar cell applications. As reported in Fig. 1b and c, the introduction of CN groups in the formed perovskite film is clearly confirmed by the peak at 1716 cm−1 in perovskite blended with sCN3 and PHQACl-CN3.39 Another important observation is that the peak shifts from 1758 cm−1 in the reference sample to 1740 cm−1 in the perovskite integrated with PHQACl-CN3. This shifting behavior indicates the enhanced interactions between the perovskite and additive through hydrogen bonds, facilitating the strong binding of these integrated components to perovskite grains and rendering the defect passivation process.38,40
The crystalline properties of the perovskite samples with and without sCN3, PQACl3 or PHQACl-CN3 were analyzed using XRD, as depicted in Fig. 1d. The perovskite films constructed with the above-mentioned additives displayed smaller PbI2 peaks than the reference perovskite, implying a high conversion of PbI2 into perovskite. Additionally, there were slight increases in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) peak for perovskite with various representative additives as shown in the ESI.† In particular, the perovskite sample with PHQACl-CN3 exhibited enhancement in the formation of perovskite.
It is worth noting that GBs and pinholes in a perovskite film can be major routes for moisture to penetrate, thus limiting the solar energy conversion efficiency and longevity of perovskite films.41,42 To investigate the morphology of the obtained perovskite films, SEM images were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S7–S9 (ESI†), perovskite films made with an appropriate amount of sCN, PQACl or PHQACl-CN show reduced formation of GBs and pinholes, along with an improved uniform perovskite grain distribution compared with the reference perovskite sample. This change in film morphology is possibly due to the enhanced hydrogen interactions in the perovskite with sCN,21 as shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S7 (ESI†). For the perovskite thin films with PQACl, the morphology is gradually changed to bulk-like crystals with the increase in PQACl, as shown in Fig. 2g and Fig. S8 (ESI†).25 The outstanding perovskite crystal with even and more uniform surface morphology is suitably formed by introducing PHQACl-CN, as shown in Fig. 2j and Fig. S9 (ESI†). This suggests that employing an appropriate amount of a morphology-reinforcing polymer, specifically PHQACl-CN3, can provide perovskite thin films with unique advantages, which may be due to the improved hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between the perovskite and the active sites yielded by PHQACl-CN3. Similar positive adjustments in the cross-sectional SEM images of the treated perovskite films are also shown in Fig. 2e, h and k. Fig. 2 reveals uniform and satisfactorily crystallized perovskite samples made with PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3. Detailed SEM information for the perovskite films treated without or with various materials (sCN, PQACl and PHQACl-CN) is illustrated in Fig. S7–S9 (ESI†). Therefore, the perovskite sample made with PHQACl-CN3 was selected for further investigation in terms of its stability and performance.

To provide clarity on the influence of sCN3, PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3 on the perovskite films, the average grain sizes in the perovskite films were assessed by Image-pro software using the collected SEM images. As depicted in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the average grain size of the reference film was 211 nm, which was increased to 428 nm, 413 nm and 604 nm for the perovskite films processed with sCN3, PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3, respectively. In agreement with previous investigations,19,43 these results confirm a good relationship between the substrate surface and the grain size. Remarkably, integrating PHQACl-CN3 into the perovskite film contributes to the formation of a large average grain size without voids. To probe the possible changes in the topography of the representative films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was performed, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The root mean square (RMS) of the reference perovskite film is 18.16 nm, whereas the RMS of perovskite samples treated with sCN3, PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3 are 14.19 nm, 15.04 nm and 12.69 nm, respectively. It can be visibly noted that the strong decrease in RMS is attributed to the higher uniformity of the perovskite film after PHQACl-CN3 inclusion and the absence of clusters where there is an increase in size. This reveals the effect of the polymer additive on controlling the morphology and restraining disturbance in crystal growth. As the existence of GBs is destructive, the considerable decline in RMS for the perovskite film with PHQACl-CN3 is anticipated to act as an important feature for charge carrier transfer in the fabricated PSCs.
The introduction of chlorine via the inclusion of chloride ion species into the crystal lattice confirms the construction of mixed halide perovskite films. The newly formed perovskite films demonstrate reliability within PSCs, due to the superior optoelectronic behaviors resulting from the outstanding electronegativity of chlorine (as compared with iodine), along with the affiliated additional bindings produced with lead ions.34,44 Based on the chemical structures of the PQACl materials displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), a small quantity of Cl has been possibly introduced into the perovskite (MAPbI3) during the additive engineering process. Their combination can evidently allow chemical reactions to occur during perovskite formation, as described in the ESI.† As a consequence of the electronegativity of the chlorine atom, iodide ions in PbI2 and MAI may interchange with chloride ions, generating PbCl2 and MACl. The chloride ions in the initiated PbCl2 continue to switch with the iodide ions from the perovskite precursor, leading to the formation of a mixed-halide perovskite film. Through the perovskite crystal annealing process, the PQA ions may also detain the chloride ions and therefore prohibit MACl gas expulsion, leading to the disappearance of pinholes and defects.
As formerly described, the instability of the perovskite film is typically caused by its hydrophilicity; therefore, integrating hydrophobic polymers into perovskite has been proposed as a solution to minimize the hydrophilic attributes of the resulting film.8,45 In this study, PHQACl-CN3 behaves as the most illustrative hydrophobicity-reinforcing agent. Existing organic properties in the polymer, together with the adaptive surface properties of sCN shown in Scheme 2 and 3, has created a perovskite film that is rich in polymer backbones, evidenced by the increase in contact angle values. The contact angle results are displayed in Fig. 2c, f, i and l. The contact angles of the perovskite treated with PHQACl-CN3, PQACl3 and sCN3 are 91.43°, 83.29° and 76.37°, respectively, while the contact angle of the reference perovskite sample is 64.94°. However, few studies reveal that polymers with high-grade hydrophobicity contribute to a great enhancement in moisture stability and the enlargement in perovskite grain size, supporting this perspective.8,25
To assess the optical characteristics of the formed perovskite thin films, we carried out PL, TRPL and UV-visible tests. In order to understand the excitation and mobility of carriers in the perovskite film samples, a steady-state photoluminescence (PL) test was conducted. The maximum emission of PL for perovskite treated with PHQACl-CN3 is higher than those of with sCN3, PQACl3, and without inclusion. One possible reason for this is the reduction in nonradiative recombination,30,46 as displayed in Fig. 3a. Another important appearance is that the PL peak shifts from 786 nm to 778 nm after processing the perovskite with PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3, indicating the satisfactory passivation of defects.34 Based on this shifting PL peak, the presence of PQACl-derived materials in perovskite films can favor the passivation of defects along GBs and the surface, probably resulting from its successful coordination within the perovskite materials, as illustrated in the FTIR analysis (Fig. 1b and c). For better confirmation, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay spectra of the fabricated perovskite films deposited on sufficiently cleaned glass substrate were measured, as shown in Fig. 3b, to evaluate the dynamics of interfacial electron–hole recombination. As referred to in earlier studies, the fast-decay PL species (τ1) and slower PL components (τ2) deal with the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and radiative recombination in bulk perovskite films, respectively.30,47,48 It is distinctly clarified that there is a prominent difference in τ2 and τ1 values, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The τ2 values for perovskite films made with PHQACl-CN3, PQACl3 and sCN3, and the reference perovskite film, are 48.7, 27.9, 20.6, and 12.8 under the same treatment conditions, respectively, and they exhibit τ1 values of 13.6, 10.3, 7.9, and 3.2. The prolonged PL lifetime usually reflects insignificant defects within the films or the termination of nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers, which largely emerge from passivation influence by polymer materials at the surface and GBs.30,49 The PHQACl-CN3 perovskite film outperforms the latter three perovskite films and the reference sample. As shown in Fig. 3c, the absorption onset of all perovskite thin films envelops the visible light area, with slight differences in intensity when the wavelength is in the range of 500–850 nm. The better crystalline properties in the sCN3, PQACl3 and PHQACl-CN3 films are mirrored in the evolution of higher intensity in almost the whole spectra when compared with the reference film. This behavior can be predominantly derived from the enlarged grain size, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and the enhanced passivation of defects, as illustrated in Fig. 3d.

(c) The absorption spectra of the reference and the representative perovskite films from polymer-constructed samples. (d) Schematic diagram showing the passivation process of MAPbI3 defects by polymer inclusion. 
To further confirm the effects of the polymer hybrid materials in the perovskite films, PSCs with FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag architectures were created, as shown in Fig. 4a. In reverse scanning mode, the reference perovskite device provides a PCE of 13.24% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.27 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.018 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 59.11%. From the reverse scanning results displayed in Fig. 4a, the outstanding device amongst those containing the perovskite film with PQACl3 shows a PCE of 15.46%, Jsc of 21.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.044 V, and FF of 65.43%. The champion device amongst those based on the perovskite film with sCN3 exhibits a PCE of 16.88%, Jsc of 22.34 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.057 V, and FF of 67.85%. Detailed information regarding the J–V characteristics of PSCs with various additive proportions is shown in Fig. S12–S15 (ESI†). Table 1 also outlines their corresponding photovoltaic parameters. As displayed in Fig. 4a, among all processed films, the most competent polymer hybrid-derived perovskite (with PHQACl-CN3) affords a PCE of 18.21%, with a Jsc of 22.62 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 V, and FF of 71.23%. This excellent performance possibly results from the superior passivation of defects efficiently reinforced by PHQACl-CN3 compared to the other additives, as indicated by the PL and TRPL measurements. After evaluating the J–V features relying on the scanning direction results, we determined the hysteresis index (HI) from the recorded PCEs as described in the ESI.†29 Compared with the reference film in the J–V, the illustrative PHQACl-CN3 device reveals a minor hysteresis, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). This considerable PCE, together with the increased Voc and FF, is attained from the restrained nonradiative recombination with the polymer materials on the surface of perovskite.50,51 Aside from the promising photovoltaic performance of the films, elucidating their long-term stability is essential to verify their global use in solar cell systems.52 We mentioned that integrating polymer materials in the perovskite boosts the film characteristics and device performance, while also enhancing shelf stability. The unencapsulated PSCs treated with PHQACl-CN3 reveal the most effective long-term stability. As shown in Fig. 4c, the shelf stability results for the devices containing PHQACl-CN3, PQACl3 and sCN3 films are considerably increased, retaining 92%, 83%, and 74% of their initial PCE after 120 h of storage in ambient environment without encapsulation. The reference sample only retains 16% of its PCE after the same time period. The device employing PHQACl-CN3 retains over 82% of its initial PCE after 320 h, proving its superior environmental stability.

As specified by the Nernst-Einstein equation reflecting the theory of ion conductivity, the diffusion of ions is quickly augmented by temperature, thus leading to the degradation of perovskite crystals.12,14,25 Therefore, thermal stability is an important criterion to examine when manufacturing efficiently stable PSCs. As confirmed in Fig. S2a, b and S5b (ESI†), these two types of materials selected for introducing into the perovskite films fulfill the required temperature condition for producing PSCs. Therefore, delegated films were correctly fixed on a hot plate at 85 °C (45–50%RH) to excite the migration of ions within the film samples. We realized that the PSC with PHQACl-CN3 exhibits the most efficient thermal stability. For example, compared with the reference film, perovskite films with PHQACl-CN3 at 85 °C show 81.2% of the initial PCE after 72 h, and maintain 66.5% of the PCE after 240 h. Meanwhile, a PCE of 38.2% was recorded for the reference perovskite film after 48 h, retaining only 7% after 96 h without encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 4d. These loss levels are in line with their PL and TRPL measurements as mentioned above. In other words, the films revealing lower τ1 and τ2 values can endure the degradation process quicker than those with higher τ1 and τ2 values. As compared with graphene oxide materials, a polymer-derived CN additive that is well-distributed in the perovskite exhibits fruitful merits.53,54 From this point, establishing hydrogen bonding interactions between amine (–NH2) or imine (–CN–) and quaternary ammonium groups (QA) of the polymer hybrid materials, and the cations of perovskite, can prevent ion delocalization in the perovskite layer, effectively hindering defect creation and promoting film stability, as previously shown in Fig. 3d. By using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) pattern, the defect densities of the reference and outperforming perovskite films with a device assembly of FTO/TO2/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag were quantified. As presented in Fig. 4e and f, the defect densities (Ndefects) of the reference film and perovskite with PHQACl-CN3 are 3.26 × 1015 cm−3 and 5.28 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. From these results, the polymer materials within the outperforming perovskite can crucially facilitate the coordination of defects.
Next, we investigated the charge-transport mechanism of the devices using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a dark environment. The representative Nyquist plots and fitting model of the PSCs are illustrated in Fig. 5a, and the values for both series resistance (Rs) and recombination resistance (Rct) are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The PHQACl-CN3-derived perovskite solar cell displays high augmentation in Rct, demonstrating that the enhanced charge transfer and reduced recombination rate provide noticeable photovoltaic performance, together with increased grain size and reinforcement in the passivation influenced by the polymer,8,25,44 confirming an increase in carrier lifespan.25,34 Hence, the appropriate addition of polymer materials together with the GBs/surface can impede nonradiative recombination and efficiently adjust the crystal growth.

The normalized light absorbance of un-encapsulated films of (b) reference perovskite and perovskite with (c) PHQACl-CN3, tested under ambient conditions with 45–50%RH. (d) XRD spectra of the representative perovskite films exposed to 45–50%RH ambient conditions for 120 h. 
To further examine the enhancement in stability of the perovskite films containing polymeric materials, the UV-visible spectra and XRD patterns of these film samples were collected in ambient conditions with 45–50%RH after several consecutive days. For the reference perovskite film, the absorption edge displays changes after 6 days. At the same time, it exhibits a gradual decrease in light absorbance intensity in the visible region, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. This tendency proves the degradation of the film. Also, the absorption edge reduces to ∼495 nm, possibly indicating the existence of PbI2 and the loss of CH3NH3+ in the reference film. In contrast, after being stored under the same conditions, the perovskite film with PHQACl-CN3 manifests a similar absorption spectrum to that of the fresh film after 6 days, confirming enhanced stability compared with the films containing PQACl3 and sCN3. The PHQACl-CN3 film also exhibits negligible decomposition, as presented in Fig. 5c and Fig. S16 (ESI†). According to the data for the perovskite film with PHQACl-CN3 in Fig. 5c, the absorption edge significantly starts to change after 24 days, but still maintains an absorption edge at ≈770 nm. Based on these results, perovskite with PHQACl-CN3 demonstrates great stability when exposed to 45–50%RH at room temperature. As indicated in Fig. 5d, PHQACl-CN3 inclusion is beneficial as it boosts the stability. The reference perovskite film reveals relevant decomposition in air over a period of 120 h, as confirmed by the emergence of an enormous PbI2 peak located at 12.7°. The perovskite with PHQACl-CN3 remains persistent, confirming that the polymer-introduced materials help to hamper the perforation of water and moisture, hindering the degradation of the perovskite.25,55 As shown in earlier research, reference perovskite films display moisture instability due to their ionic properties.8,56 In order to address this issue, various strategies have been implemented, typically aimed at adjusting defects at the GBs and pinholes.25,53 Resisting moisture in PSCs is strongly facilitated by hydrogen bonding between N⋯H–NH2–CH3+ and NH–H⋯I−, by the passivation of the exposed positively charged ion, H–NH2–CH3+, and negatively charged ion, I−, at GBs.8,14,57 Also, the existence of chlorine ions in the PQACl3-based perovskite can significantly prevent the generation of halide vacancies, owing to the significant bonding force between Pb2+ and Cl−.34,57 For the PHQACl-CN3 perovskite film, an enlarged contact angle is observed. As shown in Fig. S17 and S18 (ESI†), there is a noticeable difference in contact angles and cross-sectional SEM images between the top-performing perovskite and the reference films when exposed to ambient temperature and 45–50%RH after 18 days, which can also supply enhancement in moisture resistance, consequently boosting the film stability.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we utilized a structured polymer hybrid material, PHQACl-CN3, to develop PSCs with improved performance and stability. The good partnership between PQACl3, bearing hydrophilic units with quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic polymer backbone, and sCN nanofilling materials, providing amine or imine groups, strengthens the chemical bonding within particles and further improves the electrochemical features of the processed film. The incorporation of PHQACl-CN3 can passivate NH3–CH3+ through the formation of coordinate bonds. This inhibits the generation of halide vacancies owing to the strong bonding force between Pb2+ and Cl−. H⋯I and N–H⋯N bonding interactions between the polymer hybrid and perovskite lead to ion movement resistance and minimize points defects. Based on this collaborative achievement, the structured device reveals an enhanced PCE of 18.21%, along with reliable device shelf life and good thermal stability. The perovskite with PHQACl-CN3 maintains 82% of the original efficiency after 320 h shelf storage, and over 73% of the original efficiency is retained after 200 h of continuous thermal treatment at 85 °C under 45–50%RH. This study represents a viable strategy for constructing polymer hybrid-assisted perovskite solar cells with high efficiency and sustainable long-term stability. Furthermore, the PHQACl-CN3 perovskite films are supportive for use in PSCs.
