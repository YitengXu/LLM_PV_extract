1. Introduction
Under the threat of global environmental pollution and energy shortages, the development of “green” energy-efficient photoelectric technologies is an effective means of addressing this crisis. Photovoltaic detectors are considered as a novel type of photodetectors that can convert an optical signal into an electrical signal without external power.1–7 Further with the increasing demand for portable and sustainable operation of new electronic devices, the advantages of photovoltaic detectors in wearable communication, mobile electronic devices, intelligent robots, and other fields are becoming increasingly apparent, enabling them to achieve smaller dimensions and lower weight.8–14 Photovoltaic detectors typically rely on a sufficiently strong built-in electric field generated by a heterojunction.15–18 This kind of photodetector possesses ultra-low dark current, large photocurrent on/off ratio, fast photoresponse rate, etc.19 Meanwhile, the carrier concentration at the junction can be dynamically modulated by the gate voltage, achieving the tunable built-in electric field. These excellent characteristics enable photovoltaic detectors to have advantages such as high linearity and tunable optical response by gate voltage.20–26 Consequently, photovoltaic detectors can be widely used in polarization-sensitive enhanced photodetectors, optoelectronic logic devices, neuromorphic devices, etc.27,28
Heterostructure engineering, as a promising strategy, stands out among the methods for realizing photovoltaic detectors.29–35 When two or more materials with n-type and p-type semiconductors with matching energy band structures are reasonably assembled together to form a heterostructure, the synergistic effect will become obvious.36–45 This breaks through the limitations of the properties imposed by single material-based devices.46–51 For example, α-In2Se3 has a bandgap of ≈1.38 eV, which cannot satisfy the requirements of detectors operating in the near-infrared region. Chen and co-workers fabricated a ferroelectric-enabled van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction by vertically stacking α-In2Se3 and black phosphorus (BP) to realize high-sensitivity photodetection in switchable visible and infrared bands.52 In recent years, Hu's group designed a vertically stacked back-to-back 2D/3D BP/MoS2/Si hybrid photodetector.53 This study proposed the use of a BP/MoS2 p–n junction for medium wavelength infrared detection and a MoS2/Si n–p junction for near infrared detection, thus achieving two-colour infrared photoelectric detection.
Further, given the characteristics of ultra-thin atom level thickness and layer-dependent bandgap tunability as well as the interlayer vdW interaction of 2D materials, photovoltaic heterostructures based on 2D materials become a promising field. Due to their atom-level thickness, the optoelectronic properties of 2D ambipolar materials like MoTe2 and WSe2 (ref. 54 and 55) are easily modulated by external localized fields. And alternatively, by manipulating the polarization states generated by nonvolatile ferroelectric fields, it is possible to arrange and customize the energy bands at the heterojunction interface, resulting in the formation of customizable p–n junctions. The configuration of heterojunctions (n–p, n–n, and p–p) can be converted through external gate voltage pulses. These characteristics enable heterojunctions to have switchable, nonvolatile, and multilevel photovoltaic responses, which are particularly useful for self-powered optoelectronic logic devices that achieve multi-level output state programming and neuromorphic computing devices with sensing-memory-computing functions. In addition, the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials have a great dependence on the number of layers,56,57 which is different from conventional bulk materials. When the thickness of 2D materials is reduced to the atomic scale, quantum confinement effects influence the energy band structure of the material.58 Therefore, a new alternative is introduced in the design of photovoltaic devices, making it possible to form homojunctions of the same 2D material with different layers for photovoltaic detection.59 Furthermore, by modulating the layers of 2D materials, photovoltaic photodetectors for room temperature infrared bands can be realized, which fill the band gap vacancy in the 0–1 eV range of conventional semiconductors.60 For example, the band gap of a single layer BP can be down to 0.3 eV. Moreover, standardized measurement and evaluation of 2D materials are essential for the development of 2D photovoltaic heterostructures and related devices.61–66 Electron microscopy and diffraction techniques are commonly used for the characterization of 2D materials, including X-ray diffraction, Kelvin probe force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, etc. For instance, transmission electron microscopy provides information on the structure and crystal defects of 2D materials, which is useful for studying their optical and electrical properties and optimizing the performance of photovoltaic detectors. Correctly applying characterization methods can provide a better understanding of the structure and properties of 2D materials, leading to the design of high-performance photovoltaic detectors.
In this review, we focus on the recent implementation methods of photovoltaic devices and related emerging functional applications. First, several relevant key performance parameters of photovoltaic detectors are uniformly defined and briefly introduced. The latest research progress of photovoltaic devices based on lateral and vertical configurations is discussed in detail. Subsequently, Section 4.1 mainly introduces polarization-sensitive enhanced photovoltaic devices. This requires the built-in electric field at the p–n junction to improve the anisotropic current ratio. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 discuss the additional advantages and unique applications of the photovoltaic effect in photoelectric logic devices and neuromorphic computing. Finally, the future developments of high-performance photovoltaic devices are discussed.
2. Mechanism and figures of merit of photovoltaic detectors
In the photovoltaic effect, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are extracted and accelerated by the internal electric field Eb, and illumination on the photovoltaic devices could thereby result in a sizable photocurrent (i.e., short-circuit current Isc) without external bias Vds (Fig. 1b). The Eb could come from the formation of a depletion region at the interface of the semiconducting p–n junction or the Schottky junction.67–74 In related device studies, the channel carrier concentration and even the carrier transfer at the vdW heterostructure interface could be dynamically modulated by the gate bias to form the tunable and abrupt built-in field. This allows for adjustable (gate-dependent) responsivities of a photovoltaic device. A typical example is that the responsivities change linearly within a finite range of gate voltages and show a sign change with the applied Vg (Fig. 1c). Different from the photoelectric conversion mechanism of photovoltaic devices, photoconductive devices require the external electric field force to separate the photoinduced e–h pairs, generating extra free carriers and inducing a net increase in the photocurrent (Iphoto) over the entire gate voltage range (Fig. 1f).75,76 The photogating effect can be regarded as a particular example of photoconductive effect77 and related devices generally show a horizontal shift in the threshold voltage (VTh) of Ids–Vg traces under illumination.78–86 This is because one of the photogenerated carriers (electrons or holes) is captured in trap states, which can alter the potential energy at the semiconductor/dielectric interface. These changes in charge distribution can induce an additional electric gating field and result in changes of charge transport behavior.87–89

Several related key performance metrics for photovoltaic detectors are uniformly defined and briefly introduced below for a better comparison of the performance of photovoltaic detectors with different sizes and operating conditions.
Short-circuit current (Isc) refers to the photocurrent value generated flowing through both ends of the device when the circuit is short-circuited, which increases with the enhancement of light power.90
Open-circuit voltage (Voc) refers to the voltage value resulting from the accumulation of electron–hole pairs at the opposite terminals of the device when the circuit is open, which is proportional to light power.25,91
Responsivity (R) refers to output photocurrent per incident optical power on the effective area, i.e., R = Iph/(PinAdevice/Alaser), in which Iph = Ilight − Idark, Pin is the incident light power, Adevice is the effective channel area, and Alaser is the spot area.92,93
Linearity for photovoltaic devices refers to the dependence of the short-circuit photocurrent Isc on the incident optical power P, i.e., Isc ∝ Pα, and α is the linearity. When α is closer to 1, the device shows the better linear response.
3. Photovoltaics in different configurations of 2D materials
3.1 Lateral configuration
Lateral configuration is the in-plane structure with the electric-field direction parallel to the 2D crystal plane94–100 Several tuning methods, including electrostatic doping, chemical doping, ionic gating, surface charge transfer doping, etc, have been exploited for programming the carrier type in 2D materials to achieve a lateral p–n heterostructure. In this section, we mainly analyze recent advances and modulation mechanisms in typical photovoltaic detectors with lateral configurations.

3.1.1 Chemical doping. 
In a conventional p–n junction, the adjacent p- and n-type regions of semiconductors are formed by chemical doping.101–105 Similarly, the application of patterned doping to 2D materials with a mask-assisted process has been explored for stable and large-scale compatible lateral p–n junctions.
For instance, Won Jong Yoo and co-workers successfully obtained a laterally uniform MoS2 p–n homojunction by AuCl3 solution selective doping (Fig. 2a).103 AuCl3 can act as an effective electron acceptor due to its large positive reduction potential. During this reaction, ions in solution received electrons from the MoS2 layer, thereby leading to a significant p-doping of the MoS2 through surface charge transfer (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, h-BN was used as a hard mask to maintain its intrinsic n-type properties in the coverage area, resulting in a lateral MoS2 p–n homojunction. In the absence of the AuCl3 doping process, MoS2 comes in contact with metal electrodes to generate the photovoltaic effect. The Voc and Isc were just 0.08 V and 20.4 nA at a wavelength of 600 nm and Vg = −40 V. The Voc and Isc were enhanced to 0.5 V and 46.7 nA after doping (Fig. 2c). Different from the general lateral p–n junction, Cui et al. realized the seamless lateral SnS2 p–n-metal junction based on the solvent-based intercalation method (Fig. 2d).106 After copper and cobalt atoms are used to intercalate into the vdW gap of SnS2 to modify its band structures, a p-type semiconductor and highly conductive metal are achieved, respectively. Cu0+, Co0+, respectively, were provided by disproportionation reactions. After the insertion of Cu and Co atoms into the vdW gap of SnS2, ion-exchange reactions were obtained with the parent material, resulting in p-type SnS2 and highly conductive metals, respectively (Fig. 2e). The p–n-metal junction in contact with Co–SnS2 showed better optoelectronic properties than the p–n junction (Fig. 2f). Additionally, some other chemical doping methods can induce n-type behavior from p-type devices and allow acquiring a large built-in potential to be obtained in the p–n junction in this plane.104,107 For instance, Wang and co-workers employed benzyl viologen as an effective electron dopant to achieve an environmentally stable in-plane BP p–n junction.102 Further, Zhang's team used cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and PMMA partial protection to develop an efficient, facile partially n-type doping method for constructing a lateral WSe2 p–n junction device (Fig. 2g and h).108 The Br− in cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide solution as dopants preferentially occupy the Se vacancy and transfer electrons to W to achieve effective n-type doping. The doped WSe2 p–n junction had an enhanced rectification ratio of 103 (Fig. 2i). In addition, other performance parameters of the photodetector (such as photoswitching ratio and temporal response) were also significantly improved because of the formation of a built-in electric field in the WSe2 p–n junction (Fig. 2j).

3.1.2 Thickness modulation. 
The layer-dependent electronic band structure is one of the unique characteristics of 2D layered materials.109,110 This characteristic implies the existence of band discontinuities at the interface between monolayer and multilayer thin films, providing a possible method of constructing photovoltaic detectors with lateral configurations through thickness engineering.
Howell et al. designed a lateral homojunction photovoltaic detector composed of monolayer and multilayer of MoS2.111 A strong and bias-switchable photocurrent signal was observed at the junction at zero bias. Zhai's group had achieved lateral homojunction photovoltaic detectors by stripping WSe2 of different thicknesses (thick region: 65 nm, thin region: 6 nm) for dry transfer.112 And the band structure of the junction can be adjusted by the gate voltage to achieve a transition from the p–p junction (Vg < 0) to the n–n junction (Vg > 0). A clear photovoltaic effect was observed in the junction under laser illumination at 532 nm, with a Voc of 0.49 V and an Isc of 0.125 nA. Further, plasma etching is a highly effective method for thinning layered 2D materials and modulating their thickness.113,114 Hu et al. have used Ar+ plasma etching to modulate the thickness of PtSSe and WSe2.115 As the layered PtSSe or WSe2 became thinner, the doping accordingly transits from p-type to intrinsic and n-type conductance. For example, the layered PtSSe field-effect transistors with less than 10 layers exhibited n-type conductance, while the layered PtSSe field-effect transistors with more than 18 and 10–18 layers exhibited p-type and intrinsic doping, respectively. Further, they also fabricated a WSe2 photovoltaic diode with inhomogeneous thickness. A high rectification ratio of 4400 was obtained without external gate voltage. And Voc and Isc were 0.38 V and 286 nA, respectively, under 520 nm laser illumination.


3.1.3 Local gate modulation. 
In a typical FET-like structure, the use of multiple local gates allows us to locally manipulate n- and p-type electrostatic doping in different regions of the semiconductor channel. Commonly, the double-gate FET structure could be used to configure and electrically modulate lateral p–n junctions within the single ambipolar nanosheet.117–121
For example, in early reports, Jarillo-Herrero et al. defined lateral p–n junctions within ambipolar monolayer WSe2 by using the split-gate configuration (Fig. 3a).122 A pair of Au split gates (separated by a 100 nm gap) was deposited under the WSe2/HfO2 structure. The p–n or n–p junctions were formed when the gates are oppositely biased (p–n: Vg-Left = 10 V, Vg-Right = −10 V; n–p: Vg-Left = −10 V, Vg-Right = 10 V) (Fig. 3b), and the WSe2 p–n homojunction reached a Voc of 0.65 V and a Isc of 1 nA at 0 bias and low light-intensity of for λ = 700 nm. And Isc increased linearly with the increase of incident power (Fig. 3c). Castellanos-Gomez et al.119 and Thomas Mueller et al.121 used traditional dielectric materials h-BN and Si3N4 as gate dielectric, respectively, and proved that similar to a split gate lateral p–n junction. And a significant Voc was obtained in the p–n configuration with gate reverse bias. Subsequently, Zhao and co-workers prepared a gate-tunable MoTe2 p–n homojunction integrated on the silicon photonic crystal cavity (Fig. 3d).123 In the proposed structure, two gate electrodes were realized directly from the silicon photonic crystal cavity, which provided a resonant mode coupled with the MoTe2 layer (Fig. 3e). It could solve the ineffective interaction between light and the few-layer MoTe2 caused by its atomic layer thickness,124 resulting in enhanced light absorption. The p–n homojunction device exhibited excellent photovoltaic effect at the illumination of 1353.7 nm and the bias of Vsd = −0.5 V, with Voc of 0.46 V, EQE of 13.1% and responsivity of 156 mA W−1 (Fig. 3f). Different from the above modulation method that requires continuous application of gate voltage, Pan et al. constructed a lateral nonvolatile MoTe2 diode (Fig. 3g).55 The bottom graphene is used as a floating gate to store charges, and the Si back gate is used as a control gate. When a positive Vg was applied to silicon, there was a positive potential between graphene and MoTe2. And the accumulated electrons in the MoTe2 tunnel to the graphene. After no Vg was applied, the electrons in MoTe2 will disappear. Because of the h-BN barrier, the tunnel electrons were trapped by graphene. Holes were induced in a portion of MoTe2 to form a lateral MoTe2 p–n junction (Fig. 3h). When the device worked in a p–n junction state, it showed obvious photovoltaic characteristics (Fig. 3i). In contrast, if a negative control gate voltage pulse was applied, holes would be accumulated in the MoTe2 flake. After removing the gate voltage, the n–n junction (high conduction state) was formed in the channel. Furthermore, under light irradiation, the device possessed different power conversion states at different working states (p–n junction state or n–n junction state), which gives it the potential to develop optoelectronic logic devices (Fig. 3j).

3.1.4 Ferroelectric modulation. 
In the local gate modulation described above, it is necessary to continuously apply the control voltage to maintain the working state of the junction. And a nonvolatile p–n junction configuration can be achieved by introducing a ferroelectric field with opposite polarization directions. The direction of spontaneous polarization in a ferroelectric field can be locally switched by an external stimulus.125 This enables reconfigurable functional devices based on ferroelectric polarization.
For example, Wang's research team built a photovoltaic device of the MoTe2 lateral p–n junction by using a scanning probe to control the polarization of the ferroelectric polymer deposited on 2D transition metal dichloride (TMD) (Fig. 4a).126 By controlling the voltage applied to the scanning probe, the ferroelectric copolymers can be controlled to alternately polarize up (Pup state) and down (Pdown state), thus providing a transverse p–n–p–n structure in MoTe2. A photocurrent of opposite polarity was observed in the junction region, indicating the presence of a reversed built-in electric field between the p–n and n–p regions (Fig. 4b and c). MoTe2 p–n homojunction devices constructed using this method exhibit good optoelectronic properties (responsivity of 1.5 A W−1). In addition, Wu and co-workers realized a BP in-plane homojunction defined by ferroelectric domains.129 The ferroelectric film was up-polarized and down-polarized via piezoresponse force microscopy technology, and then BP was p-doped and n-doped by these ferroelectric domains, thus achieving an in-plane p–n junction on the BP. The phase difference along the red dashed line between the Pup state (p-doped region) and Pdown state (n-doped region) revealed that the ferroelectric film was patterned into two opposite domains with a 180° domain wall. Simultaneously, the photovoltaic effect of BP in-plane homojunction devices mainly occurred at ferroelectric domain walls and varied with the polarization angle of incident light, which accords with the linear dichroism of BP. The maximum Isc and Voc obtained at 0° are 1.58 nA and 0.016 V, respectively. Zhai's group also reported similar studies. They fabricated a reconfigurable lateral p–n junction photodetector with ferroelectric polarization-defined p/n doping in MoS2 using the device configuration of bottom electrical contacts (Fig. 4d).127 The p/n type switching of MoS2 doping polarity can be realized by applying the opposite polarization voltage locally to the atomic force microscope tip (Fig. 4e). When illuminating the p–n diode with 532 nm light, apparent photovoltaic effect was observed under zero bias driven by the built-in field in the junction (Fig. 4f and g). In addition to the control of ferroelectric polarization by a piezoelectric probe, the polarization direction of ferroelectric field can be switched by the external gate voltage pulses. Wang et al. implemented a MoTe2 p–n junction defined by nonvolatile P(VDF-TrFE) ferroelectric domains (Fig. 4h).128 Voltage pulses of a pulse width of 2 s (Vg1 and Vg2 for the left and right gates, respectively) were applied to both gates to independently control the polarization direction (Vg = 18 V: upward polarization; Vg = −18 V: downward polarization) of the left and right P(VDF-TrFE) membranes (Fig. 4i). When the polarization direction of the ferroelectric field was opposite, the energy level of MoTe2-Femi is significantly different. This created a built-in electric field between the gates and separates the photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 4j), producing a good linear photovoltaic effect related to optical power (Fig. 4k).

3.2 Vertical configuration
The vertical configuration's electric field or the junction is perpendicular to the atomic plane of the 2D material, which is an out-of-plane structure.130–133 Generally, heterojunctions can easily be created by laminating two sheets 2D materials of opposite or identical conductive types (inherently n-type: MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, etc; intrinsically p-type: WSe2, MoTe2, BP, etc).134–136 The following paragraphs will analyze recent advances and modulation mechanisms in photovoltaic detectors implemented using vertical configurations.

3.2.1 2D/2D semiconductor contact. 
Compared with 3D heterostructures, there are no chemical bonds and lattice mismatch at the interface of the stacked 2D crystalline atomic layers.137,138 This means that high-quality 2D materials with a variety of optical properties can be prepared into vertical artificial vdW heterojunctions by a simple exfoliating–restacking method.139–141 In this section, we mainly discuss the latest advances in manufacturing methods and performance optimization of photodiode devices based on vertical p–n junctions.
As an important example, Chu and co-workers fabricated MoTe2/MoS2 vertical heterostructures stacked by exfoliation and restacking techniques (Fig. 5a).142 Under laser irradiation at 637 nm, strong photoresponsivity was observed in the junction, with Voc and Isc of 0.51 V and 1.09 μA, respectively (Fig. 5b and c). And the device can change its operating mode by applying a small bias voltage (Fig. 5d). Under short-circuit state (Vds = 0 V), current flowed in the p–n junction is only made of Isc. Under this circumstance, the photocurrent on/off ratio was up to 105 and the dark current was extremely low (3 pA). Unlike the materials used in the former, Saurabh Lodha et al. achieved a WSe2/ReS2 p–n heterostructure by stacking few-layer flakes of ReS2 flakes onto WSe2.143 High Voc (0.64 V) and large Isc (2.6 μA) were obtained under 532 nm incident light illumination. Further, the WSe2/ReS2 p–n heterostructure enabled ultra-fast (5 μs) high responsivity (3 A W−1) transient photoswitching owing to the type-II near-direct bandgap and efficient photogenerated carrier separation. What's more, Wang's group fabricated a gate-tunable vertical p–n diode by vertically stacking p-type few layer BP on n-type few layer InSe (Fig. 5e).144 The prepared heterojunction exhibited a clear gate-modulated rectification behavior in the dark, the rectification ratio was ≈1.8 × 102 at Vg = −15 V and monotonically decreases as the back gate voltage shifts from negative to positive (Fig. 5f). And this few-layer p-BP/n-InSe heterojunction device was the potential for broad-band photoresponse owing to the narrow direct bandgap of multilayer BP (Eg ≈ 0.3 eV) and InSe (Eg ≈ 1.3 eV). Simultaneously, as the positive/negative Vg had the opposite modulation effect on the band alignment of the BP/InSe heterojunction, as the Vg increased from a negative value to a positive value, the Isc was amplified and the Voc was reduced (Fig. 5g). Recently, Gan's group successfully fabricated a vdW heterojunction photodetector based on vertically stacked BP and MoTe2 (Fig. 5h).145 By focusing a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and 9 μW incident power onto the heterojunction at room temperature, the obvious photovoltaic effect can be observed (Fig. 5i). The photovoltaic effect in the heterojunction was switchable by the gate voltage (Fig. 5j), which makes the device have the potential to realize a novel photovoltaic optoelectronic logic element without external bias.

3.2.2 Mixed-dimensional semiconductor contacts. 
Beyond the aforementioned purely 2D/2D structures, another important and recommended research focus is the photoresponse of mixed-dimensional p–n junctions such as 1D/2D and 2D/3D contacts. These systems combine the advantages of established 1D (e.g. metal nanowires) or, 3D semiconductors (e.g. Si) and the unique properties of ultra-thin 2D materials,146–148 and inspire the fertile optoelectronic properties beyond pure 2D and bulk optoelectronic devices.149–152
Traditional 3D semiconductors have two fundamental competitive advantages: strong light absorption and efficient manufacturing methods constructed directly from commercial substrates (InGaAs, Si, etc.). Several representative pioneering studies for vertically stacked 2D/3D heterostructures have been proposed, for example, Xu and co-colleagues designed a 2D/3D photovoltaic photodetector using the MoS2/h-BN/GaAs heterojunction.153 Insertion of h-BN suppressed charge transfer in the MoS2/GaAs heterojunction, leading to an increase in the barrier height and shunt resistance of the photodiode and thus a reduction of dark current. The J–V curve of the MoS2/GaAs heterostructure photodetector under 635 nm (100 mW cm−2) illumination showed an open-circuit voltage of 0.55 V and a photocurrent density of 20 mA cm−2. In another study, Jie's group achieved the construction of a WS2/Ge 2D/3D vdW heterojunction for ultrabroadband photodetection (Fig. 6a).154 Ge has the desirable characteristics of high mobility, large absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region and small band gap of 0.67 eV, which makes photodetectors have the potential for high-sensitivity broadband photoelectric detection. Meanwhile, the bandgap of 2D WS2 was effectively narrowed by controlling the concentration of S vacancies,155–157 enabling an ultrabroadband spectral response of the device from deep ultraviolet (200 nm) to mid-wave infrared (4.6 μm) band. In addition, effective AlOx layer (3 nm) surface passivation was utilized to reduce the density of dangling bonds and defects on the surface, and to reduce WS2/Ge interface recombination, which leads to an improvement in the photovoltaic behavior of the heterojunction (Isc increases from 47 mA to 95 mA; Voc increases from 0.14 V to 0.23 V) (Fig. 6b). And note that both responsivity and EQE values increased with decreasing light intensity (Fig. 6c), and the maximum responsivity and EQE values of 634.5 mA W−1 and 50.8%, respectively, were achieved at a relatively weak light intensity of 42 μW cm−2.

1D/2D heterojunctions are also proposed for obtaining enhanced optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic detectors. This can be attributed to the low-dimensional geometries, high specific surface area, and multiple light scattering absorption of 1D nanostructures.158 For instance, Li's team successfully prepared vertical 1D/2D heterojunction photovoltaic detectors by epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on TMDs/Si substrates using plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (Fig. 6d and e).159 The photogenerated carriers were separated by the built-in electric field, and the accumulated electrons moved to the GaN nanowires while the holes are collected by the Si back electrode, inducing a distinct photovoltaic effect (Fig. 6e and f). Young Tack Lee et al. prepared 1/2D ZnO/WSe2 mixed-dimensional vdW heterojunction based photovoltaic devices (Fig. 6g).160 The detector was passivated using an amorphous fluoropolymer (Fig. 6h). The abundance of carbon-fluorine dipoles inside the polymer induced an increased hole density in WSe2, thus balancing the carrier concentration in the heterojunction and improving device performance (such as the highest rectification ratio of over 106). Table 1 summarizes the important photovoltaic devices with different junction configurations reported in the literature and their performances.

4. Functional applications of photovoltaic detectors
4.1 Polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on the photovoltaic effect
The photoconductive polarization-sensitive detectors based on individual materials such as GeAs,162 GeAs2,163 GeSe,164–166 GeSe2,167 ReS2,168,169 and so on generally have the disadvantages of large dark current, long response time and low anisotropic photocurrent ratio.170–172 Polarization-sensitive photovoltaic detectors based on vdW heterojunctions can combine the advantages of different materials to optimize the detector performance.
In 2015, Cui et al.173 designed the ion-gel gated BP-based electric-double-layer transistor (Fig. 7a), which showed the formation of an inversion layer (surface electron accumulation) on the p-type BP channel (holes in bulk) with a further increase in positive Vg (Fig. 7b). Such a vertical p–n junction structure induced by gating can spatially separate the photogenerated carriers in the channel into surface or bulk layers (Fig. 7c) and therefore greatly enhance the efficiency of the polarization-sensitive photodetector. The maximum photocurrent at 1500 nm with 0° polarization dramatically increased while the photocurrent with 90° polarization did not significantly change as Vg varies from 0 to 1.5 V (Fig. 7d). Specifically, the photoresponsivity at 1700 nm (0° polarization) can be enhanced by one order of magnitude with Vg > 0 (Fig. 7e). In addition to inducing p–n junctions in a single BP material, some studies have shown that BP can effectively combine with TMDs to form a series of functional vdW heterojunctions for polarization-sensitive detection.174–178 Ali Javey and co-workers designed the BP/MoS2 photovoltaic diode with Au as a back reflector, MoS2 as a mid-wave infrared window, and selective contact (Fig. 7f and g).60 In addition, a bias-selectable, polarization-sensititive monolithic photodetector based on the BPt/MoS2/BPb device structure was designed. The crystal orientations of BPt and BPb were perpendicular to each other. At the wavelength of 3.5 μm linearly polarized light, the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of the BPt/MoS2 or BPb/MoS2 device reached ∼100:1 (Fig. 7h). Based on this device, the spectrum-resolved photoresponse measurement was performed at ±250 mV (Fig. 7i), demonstrating the bias-optional polarization-sensitive photodetection. Moreover, Li's team achieved a type-II photovoltaic GeAs/InSe (anisotropic/isotropic) heterojunction by using a PVA/PDMS-assisted dry transfer method.179 A large anisotropic photocurrent ratio up to 18 was observed at zero bias under the illumination of λ = 635 nm and Plaser = 34.7 nW. Furthermore, Luo et al. prepared the single-crystalline 2D/3D(4-AMP)(MA)2Pb3Br10/MAPbBr3 (MA = methylammonium and 4-AMP = 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium) hybrid perovskite heterostructure through the temperature-cooling solution method (Fig. 8a).180 The measured anisotropic photocurrent ratio of this 2D/3D heterostructure-based device has reached a remarkable high of 17.6 under photovoltaic mode with the laser wavelength of 405 nm (Fig. 8b). In contrast, the (4-AMP) (MA)2Pb3Br10-only device showed a relatively low anisotropic photocurrent ratio with the ratio of ∼1.5 under 405 nm illumination at 10 V bias (Fig. 8c) and this is from the intrinsic anisotropic crystal structure of (4-AMP) (MA)2Pb3Br10.

In the above research, the anisotropic photocurrent ratio can be improved by constructing photovoltaic heterojunctions. On this basis, the introduction of strong local fields of ferroelectric thin films can further improve the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of photovoltaic detectors. Wu and co-workers realized an in-plane BP p–n junction polarization-sensitive photodetector defined by the opposite polarized ferroelectric field (Fig. 8d).129 As shown in Fig. 8e, the photoelectric conversion mainly occurred at the ferroelectric domain wall and diffuses to the electrodes on both sides. This broad photocurrent mapping implied that there was another mechanism (photothermoelectric effect) to generate electron–hole pairs besides the photovoltaic effect (Fig. 8f). Combined the photothermoelectric effect and photovoltaic effect in one device to enhance the photocurrent in the armchair direction, and greatly improve the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of the polarization photodetector.181,182 Specifically, under the modulation of a high electric field (1.9 V nm−1), a single-layer BP became a Dirac semimetal with anisotropic dispersion, and its electronic structure in the armchair direction will change obviously, but the electronic structure in the zigzag direction will not change (Fig. 8g). Thus, the photothermoelectric current in the direction of the armchair increased and caused an enhanced anisotropic photocurrent ratio of 288 (at 1450 nm incident light). Moreover, Wang's group designed a ferroelectric-tuned GeSe/MoS2 vdW heterojunction polarization-sensitive detector (Fig. 8h).181 The anisotropy of GeSe/MoS2 heterostructure was further enhanced by the anisotropic Stark effect of ferroelectric field in GeSe. Compared with the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of 1.09 of the GeSe photodetector, the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of GeSe/MoS2 device increased to 5.53 at 520 nm incident light (Fig. 8i and j). In the heterostructure systems containing isotropic and anisotropic 2D materials, the anisotropic photocurrent ratio of polarization sensitive photodetectors depends on the absorption anisotropy of the material structure.180 Meanwhile, the built-in electric field of heterojunctions can suppress carrier recombination, providing effective driving force for carrier separation/transmission, and helping to achieve high anisotropic current ratio.183
The existing polarization-sensitive photodetectors have shown excellent commercial application potential. For example, the IMX250MZR polarization detector chip technology from Sony is currently mature, with anisotropic current ratios ranging from 35 to 425. Table 2 summarizes the reported polarization-sensitive photodetectors based on the photovoltaic effect and their photodetection performances in the literature. In the past two years, Wu's team129 and Wang's team181 reported two-dimensional photovoltaic polarization detectors, whose polarization performance is close to that of commercial detectors. Currently, 2D polarization-sensitive photovoltaic detectors are limited in the preparation of large-area arrays, but they are expected to surpass commercial focal plane polarization detectors in pixel density, integration, and other aspects due to their ability to independently realize polarization sensitive detection.

4.2 Optoelectronic logic devices based on photovoltaic detectors
Optoelectronic logic devices, with light pulse and voltage as logic or configuring inputs and the multi-level photocurrent states as output, are capable of functioning as a reconfigurable logic gate including “AND”, “OR” or “NOT” operations and digital-to-analog converter (DAC).185–189 Photovoltaic detectors have the characteristics of low dark current, low power consumption, highly linear response of photoelectric conversion and susceptible gate tunability, and are particularly useful for programming the multi-level output states of a device in optoelectronic circuits.190–192
Several proof-of-concept optoelectronic logic devices based on the photovoltaic effect have been demonstrated in ambipolar TMD material systems like BP,193,194 WSe2 (ref. 195) and MoTe2.81 The gate-controlled logic switch devices based on BP and WSe2 heterojunctions were reported by Zhang's group.196 The device switched smoothly between the “ON” and “OFF” states when alternating gate voltages of −10 and 30 V were applied under 18 mW laser irradiation. Subsequently, Gan and co-workers realized a novel photovoltaic optoelectronic logic device based on the 2D BP/MoTe2 heterojunction (Fig. 9a).145 The logic switch of this device is attributed to the gate-switchable photovoltaic effect in the heterojunction, which realizes the functional integration and parallel operation of reading and decoding the input optical signal in the optoelectronic circuit.

Due to the ambipolar conduction characteristics of the BP and MoTe2, the BP/MoTe2 heterojunction can be dynamically tuned to anisotype (p–n, with Vg from −35 V to 15 V) and isotype (p–p, with Vg from −60 V to −35 V; n–n, with Vg from 15 V to 60 V) for reconfiguring the photovoltaic effect (Fig. 9b and c). Further, with an optical signal as the “input” (OFF-state “0” for no light and ON-state “1” for 5 μW laser) and gate voltage Vg as the “control” (OFF state “0” for Vg = 0 V and ON state “1” for Vg = −60 V), the photovoltaic current “output” Isd of heterostructure could be switched to the OFF state for Isd < 10−12 A or the ON state for Isd > 10−12 A (Fig. 9d–f) for photovoltaic optoelectronic logic function. This device showed the promising performance of output dark current <1 pA, on/off current ratio >105, switching time <10 μs, broadband operation in the spectral range from 400 to 1600 nm, and linearly adjustable output current signal. Recently, Li's research team completed comparable work as well. They created a logic optoelectronic device based on a gate-tunable lateral p–n homojunction (Fig. 9g).197 The MoTe2 homojunction's carrier type and band slope can both be directly impacted by changing the Fermi level of the material through gate control, suggesting a flexible and tunable photoresponse in the device. Due to the gate-tunable built-in field of the lateral homojunction, the device can output the different logic Voc switch behavior at different voltage stimuli (−40 V or 40 V) (Fig. 9h and i).
Further, electronic logic devices based on p- and n-type transistors were developed. Complementary device applications were explored by integrating n-type and p-type transistors. A back-gate voltage was applied as the input VIN and the supply voltage VDD was applied to the p-type transistor. For example, Qin's team made a MoTe2 complementary inverter using MgO surface charge transfer doping technology (Fig. 10a).97 The MoTe2 inverter integrated an undoped MoTe2 field-effect transistor (p-type) and MgO-doped MoTe2 field-effect transistor (n-type), providing a clear signal inversion at high output voltage and low input voltage (Fig. 10b). When the supply voltage was 6 V, the direct voltage gain of the inverter reached 26 (Fig. 10c). Similarly, Seongil Im et al. integrated the multivalue p-channel MoTe2 field-effect transistor and plain n-MoS2 field-effect transistor to make a complementary ternary inverter (Fig. 10d).198 The inverter had a ternary value property due to the resonant tunneling type injection (from n-MoS2 to p-MoTe2 channels) and channel reversal. Therefore, the transfer characteristics of the heterostack field-effect transistors displayed ternary value Isd behavior: two ON states and OFF state (high ON: Vsd = 1 V, intermediate ON: Vsd = 0.1 V, and OFF: gate leakage) along with Isd dip depending on Vg (Fig. 10e). Based on the ternary value Isd states, the voltage transfer characteristics were achieved from ternary value inverter with a 500 MΩ external resistor. The voltage gain between 0 and 1/2 states was as high as ≈10 but the second gain between 1/2 and 1 states was low to only a few (Fig. 10f). Furthermore, the method based on ferroelectric-domain-control can also be used to build logic devices. Different from the mode of optical writing and electrical reading of photovoltaic logic devices, ferroelectric controlled logic devices can realize the process of electrical writing and optical reading. Wang's research team constructed a WSe2 p–n junction-based quasi-nonvolatile memory by using a scanning probe to control the polarization of the ferroelectric polymer deposited on WSe2 (Fig. 10g).126 In the quasi-nonvolatile structure, both writing and erasing operations were achieved by charge transfer through the p–n junction from the bare floating gate electrode. Charges were transferred from the electrode to the charge trapping layer graphene-2 through the forward-biased p–n junction after applying a short floating gate voltage Vfg = +4 writing pulse (Vfg = −4 V erasing pulse) on the floating gate electrode with the p–n junction, thus realizing two storage states. Charges trapped in the graphene-2 remain due to the rectification characteristic of the p–n junction, even if the electrode voltage was removed, allowing the channel storage state to remain unchanged. The quasi-nonvolatile memory created by this method had a refresh time of more than 100 s and a write/erase speed of 10 μs, which is 104 times faster than the operation speed when the flash operation mode is performed (Fig. 10h and i).

4.3 Neuromorphic computing applications of photovoltaic detectors
Computing in sensors or memory devices (also called “in-sensor computing” or “in-memory computing”) allows for reducing latency and power consumption associated with data transmission and is expected for real-time analysis.199–206 Due to properties such as the gate-tunable photoresponse characteristics, a significant research effort is currently focused on exploring the unique properties of photovoltaic heterostructures for designing computational sensing devices.
Simple neuromorphic computing tasks have been demonstrated with these systems, such as the in-sensor convolution network or a single-level perceptron network. For example, Zhai et al. implemented simultaneous broadband image sensing and convolutional processing (also called “in-sensor convolutional processing”) using PdSe2/MoTe2 photovoltaic heterostructures (Fig. 11a).207 The associated heterostructure device shows a broadband gate-tunable positive and negative photosensitivity (Rj), and their photoresponsivity depends linearly on the gate voltage, which is beneficial for convolutional processing (Fig. 11b). Therefore, taking Rj as the weight of broadband convolution, and setting Rj to certain values for each pixel through modulation of the gate voltage, the convolutional kernels can be reconfigured for different convolutional processing operations (namely sharpness and edge enhancement) to perform pre-processed remote sensing images (Fig. 11e). Further, during the training process of the convolutional neural network, utilizing the gate voltage as weights in the kernels and continuously optimizing the weight distribution of kernels can achieve the broadband pattern recognition, and compared with a single-band based convolutional network, the broadband convolution network effectively improves recognition accuracy for broadband images (Fig. 11c and d). Moreover, Lucas Mennel and his colleagues have demonstrated that a photodiode array based on a single reconfigurable WSe2 p–n homojunction can itself constitute an artificial neural network that can simultaneously sense and process optical images (Fig. 11f).208 The channel state (p–n junction or n–p junction) was controlled by two bottom gates, with one gate electrode biased at Vg and the other at −Vg, enabling an adjustable photoresponse between −60 and +60 mA W−1 (Fig. 11g). The artificial neural networks for image processing can be implemented by taking illumination intensity, responsivity and photocurrent as input, weight and output respectively (Fig. 11h). On this basis they made a 3 × 3 imaging array as nine inputs, in which each pixel was divided into three detectors corresponding to three outputs. The classifier and automatic encoder based on the detector were proved to be feasible (Fig. 11i).

Another emerging progress in related neuromorphic research is the use of ferroelectric materials for photosensors to achieve the nonvolatile reconfigurable photovoltaic effect.209–218 He and co-workers realized the nonvolatile reconfigurable optoelectronic artificial synapse based on MoTe2/α-In2Se3 ferroelectric p–n junctions (Fig. 12a).187 Applying Vg pulses to polarize a-ln2se3 can set the material to different polarization states (Fig. 12b and d). For this reason, the MoTe2/α-In2Se3 p–n junction had a nonvolatile reconfigurable behavior (Isc: from 73.57 to 825.10 pA; Voc: from 260 to 390 mV, with Vg changing from −80 to 80 V), which can simulate the plasticity of synapse in retina (Fig. 12e). This nonvolatile reconfigurable photovoltaic effect makes it possible to MoTe2/α-In2Se3 ferroelectric p–n junction can simulate the retina synapse-like vision functions. The short-term plasticity changed to a long-term plasticity by applying a series of identical spikes (Vg pulse of 20 V and duration of 200 ms) (Fig. 12c), thus inducing the continuous ferroelectric polarization switching in α-In2Se3 to mimic the functions of retina synapse, including spike-amplitude and spike-duration dependent short-term excitation and inhibition, paired-pulse facilitation and paired-pulse depression, long-term potential and depression without driving voltage. Moreover, an experiential learning-forget-relearning process was simulated in-concept without applying driving voltage. Moreover, Liu's group fabricated a ferroelectric photovoltaic sensor network based on the Pt/Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3/SrRuO3 heterojunction (Fig. 12f and g), which can simultaneously integrate image sensing and processing functions.204 Applied a positive or negative voltage pulse to the Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 ferroelectric layer through the Pt electrode, and setted the polarization up or down state respectively, showing a nonvolatile positive and negative photoelectric response controlled by residual polarization. This results in a nonvolatile positive and negative photoelectric response controlled by residual polarization (Fig. 12h). On this basis, the ferroelectric photosensor network was further demonstrated with real-time image processing functionalities, including binary pattern classification with an accuracy of 100% and edge detection with an F-measure of 95.2%. These fundamental simulations of synaptic behavior will facilitate the development of optoelectronic artificial neuro-networks.

Beyond the above conceptual functional demonstrations based on a single or a little amount of devices, further optimization of the device structure and integration of device arrays are necessary to advance these proposed photovoltaic systems towards practical applications.219–222 Memory could be introduced into the 2D photovoltaic heterostructures to create intelligent devices capable of performing in-memory sensing and in-memory computing. Further through optimizing the preparation of large-scale 2D materials and achieving the controllable transfer of 2D materials,223–226 it should be possible in the future to achieve the large-scale integration of devices to implement practical neuromorphic computing functions.
5. Conclusion and outlook
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent advancements in the design and fabrication of 2D photovoltaic detectors. The working mechanism and relevant figures of merit of this kind of photodetector were first described in detail. Then, we discussed various photovoltaic devices with lateral and vertical configurations using different p–n junction modulation modes, including chemical doping, thickness modulation, local gate modulation, and ferroelectric modulation. Meanwhile, photovoltaic detectors based on 2D materials exhibit substantial impressive and attractive performances, such as ultra-low dark current, large photocurrent on/off ratio, fast photoresponse rate, high linearity, tunable optical response by gate voltage and so on. Therefore, in the fourth part, the functional applications of 2D photovoltaic detectors have been designed and expanded, including 2D polarization-sensitive-enhanced photovoltaic devices, 2D optoelectronic logic devices, and recent emerging 2D neuromorphic devices for artificial intelligence applications.
Although significant progress has been made, the research into 2D photovoltaic detectors is still at a relatively basic stage and cannot completely replace commercial photodetectors. There are still many challenges that need to be overcome for their practical application in future 2D photovoltaic devices. Therefore, given some shortcomings of 2D photovoltaic detectors and current practical application requirements, we anticipate the further improvement and development direction of photovoltaic photodetectors, in order to push the proposed concept to practical application.
(1) The current research about photovoltaic detectors primarily remains on the performance of individual devices to simulate or proof-of-concept demonstrate their practical functionality in sensor arrays. The main reason is that the large-scale and uniform synthesis of 2D materials and the fabrication of sensor arrays are still challenging. The production technology of large-scale and high-quality 2D materials is thus crucial. Currently, the TMDs are at the stage of developing mono-oriented growth methods and only a limited number of TMDs, such as MoS2 and WSe2, can be produced as single-crystalline wafer-scale films.227 At present, a large area BP film has been prepared by pulsed laser deposition.228 Nevertheless, the application of the high-temperature vacuum deposition method for large-area growth of BP films still needs to be further explored. The development of large-scale controllable 2D material growth is expected to lead to the large-scale integration of high-quality photovoltaic heterojunction devices in the future.229,230
(2) While 2D materials possess desirable qualities such as transparency, flexibility, and light weight, their thickness poses a limitation to the amount of light they can absorb. This ultimately results in lower optical absorption efficiency for devices that rely on 2D materials for manufacturing next-generation photovoltaic devices. To improve absorption efficiency in photovoltaic heterojunctions, further development of absorption improvement technologies is necessary. This includes interfacing metallic nanoparticles on the 2D heterojunction to boost the photon absorption and increase the short-circuit current density.231 Additionally, implementing photovoltaic heterojunctions with two-photon absorption, where electrons can absorb two photons simultaneously, can enhance the light–matter interaction of 2D materials and improve optical absorption efficiency.232
(3) Current neuromorphic devices based on the photovoltaic effect generally have perceptual and computational functions, but lack memory capabilities.233 Memory could be introduced into the photovoltaic heterostructures to create intelligent devices capable of performing in-memory sensing and in-memory computing. The use of ferroelectric materials (such as α-In2Se3) as photosensors of photovoltaic heterostructures is considered as potential substitutes to achieve advanced in-memory sensing or computing technology. The MIM memristor architecture, which typically consists of a metal/insulator/metal structure, is also expected to be available with 2D photovoltaic heterojunctions (MHM) replacing the traditional insulator layer.234 The resistance switching mechanism in this MHM architecture is based on band modulation rather than conductive filaments, which can effectively prevent material degradation during the set/reset processes.
With continuous efforts dedicated to tackling these issues and the rapidly ongoing progress in photovoltaic device research, 2D photovoltaic devices with higher performances can be expected in the years to come.
