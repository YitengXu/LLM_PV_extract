    , Accepted 6th July 2020First published on 8th July 2020AbstractThe valorization of lignin has significant potential in producing commodity chemicals and fuels from renewable resources. However, the catalytic degradation of lignin is kinetically challenging and often requires noble metal catalysts to be used under harsh and toxic conditions. Here, we report the bias-free, solar reformation of lignin coupled with redox biotransformation in a tandem structure of a BiVO4 photoanode and perovskite photovoltaic. The tandem structure compensates for the potential gap between lignin oxidation and biocatalytic reduction through artificial Z-schematic absorption. We found that the BiVO4-catalyzed photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin facilitated the fragmentation of higher molecular weight lignin into smaller carboxylated aliphatic and aromatic acids. Lignin oxidation induced photocurrent generation at the photoanode, which enabled efficient electroenzymatic reactions at the cathode. This study successfully demonstrates the oxidative valorization of lignin as well as biocatalytic reductions (e.g., CO2-to-formate and α-ketoglutarate-to-L-glutamate) in an unbiased biocatalytic PEC platform, which provides a new strategic approach for photo-biocatalysis using naturally abundant renewable resources.
Introduction
Lignin is one of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass, and it comprises about 20–30% of the solid weight of plants. Despite lignin's potential as a renewable resource, it has been treated as a waste from pulp processing and has been underutilized because of its recalcitrant nature, stemming from its complex and irregular polymeric structure.1,2 Due to lignin's high resistance to degradation, the catalytic depolymerization of lignin often involves chemical oxidants used under harsh conditions, such as extreme temperature/pressure and high pH.3,4 The electrochemical oxidation of lignin proceeds without any additives but is still energy intensive, requiring high current density, substantial bias, and costly bulk electrode materials (e.g., Pt,5 Au,5 IrO2,6,7 Ru/V oxides,8 Pb,9,10 and Ni11). Solar energy is a sustainable alternative for lignin oxidation with efficiencies in both energy and cost. For example, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been applied to solar lignin degradation, which involved semiconductors under ultraviolet (UV) or visible-light irradiation (e.g., rare earth doped-TiO2/UV,12 ZnO/UV,13 Fe2O3–Nb2O5/visible-light,14 and In2S3/visible-light15). The photocatalytic degradation of lignin typically occurs via the radical-induced oxidation pathway, including the light-driven generation of hydroxyl (OH˙) and superoxide (O2˙−) radicals on the edge of bandgaps. However, combining oxidation and reduction reactions in a one-pot system hampers the overall efficiency due to the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and causes photocatalyst inactivation.16,17 However, photoelectrochemical cells offer a greener option for a cost-effective, safe, and sustainable approach to draw electrons from lignin for solar-to-chemical production by utilizing renewable sources like sunlight to reduce the energy required for the electrochemical method.18,19
Here, we report an unbiased photoelectrochemical (PEC) platform that couples lignin oxidation with biocatalytic reductions under visible light. As depicted in Scheme 1, the PEC system consists of three components: (1) a bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode used to photoelectrochemically oxidize lignin; (2) a triple-cation perovskite photovoltaic (PV) used to form a tandem structure with BiVO4 and provide supplementary photovoltage driving redox reactions under zero external bias; and (3) a carbon cloth cathode to reduce NAD+ to NADH for enzymatic redox conversions (e.g., CO2-to-formate and α-ketoglutarate-to-L-glutamate reactions). Solely driven by light, the photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin could be achieved under environmentally benign conditions, while boosting the green synthesis of value-added chemicals using redox enzymes.

The BiVO4 photoanode promotes the photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin. The triple-cation perovskite photovoltaic (PV) forms a tandem structure with the BiVO4 photoanode, providing supplementary photovoltage to drive reactions under zero external bias. The carbon-cloth cathode reduces NAD+ to NADH for the reductive conversion of substrates (e.g., CO2 to formate, and α-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate) using redox enzymes (formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)). 
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
All chemicals, including lignosulfonate, alkali lignin, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate [Bi(NO3)3·5H2O], potassium iodide (KI), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), p-benzoquinone, vanadyl acetylacetonate [VO(acac)2], 1,4-dioxane, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetic anhydride, dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potassium hydride (KOH), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (BSTFA/TMCS), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD+), and sodium formate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). These chemicals were used without further purification. The rhodium(III)-based electron mediator (M = [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+, Cp* = C5Me5, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) was synthesized according to the previous literature.20 Formate dehydrogenase from Thiobacillus sp. KNK65MA (TsFDH) was cloned, expressed, and purified according to the previous paper.21
Synthesis and characterization of the BiVO4 photoanode
A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (TEC-7, Pilkington) was thoroughly washed in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution by ultrasonication for 30 min, followed by rinsing in deionized (DI) water and ethanol. For the electrochemical deposition of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI), a plating solution was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.04 M) in 100 mL KI (0.4 M) aqueous solution and adjusting the pH to 1.7 using HNO3, followed by the addition of 40 ml of an ethanol solution containing a p-benzoquinone solution (0.23 M). The precursor solution was stirred for 1 h. A conventional three-electrode configuration that consists of FTO as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl3 M NaCl as a reference electrode, and Pt mesh as a counterelectrode was employed with a potentiostat/galvanostat (WMPG 1000, Wonatech Co., Korea) for the electrodeposition; the FTO glass (2 × 3 cm2) was immersed in the as-prepared precursor solution, and a cathodic bias of −0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied for 4 min. Afterward, the dark orange BiOI layer on the FTO was washed with DI water and dried under ambient conditions. To synthesise BiVO4 from the BiOI, 200 μL of a DMSO solution containing VO(acac)2 (0.2 M) was dropped onto the BiOI layer, followed by heating at 723 K for 2 h with a ramping rate of 1 K min−1 under air. Subsequently, the excess V2O5 on the electrodes was removed by soaking the as-synthesized BiVO4 electrodes in a NaOH (1 M) aqueous solution for 5 min. The morphology of the BiVO4 electrode was observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an S-4800 field microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The crystal structure of BiVO4 was obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a D/MAX-RC thin film X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU Co., Japan) equipped with a nickel filter under a scan speed of 5° min−1 and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 10–60°. UV–vis absorption and transmittance spectra (range from 300 nm to 700 nm) were obtained using a V-650 UV/visible spectrophotometer (JASCO Inc., Japan), in which an electrode was placed at the center of an integrating sphere to measure all light reflected and transmitted to accurately assess the absorbance.
Fabrication of a carbon cloth cathode
A carbon cloth (Zoltek Co., USA) was thoroughly washed by ultrasonication in acetone, isopropanol, and DI water, and then dried in an oven at 353 K for 1 h, followed by treatment with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min. The clean carbon cloth was cut into small pieces and was wired using silver paste and the edges were covered with an insulating epoxy resin (Hysol 9460), leaving an active area of 2 cm2.
Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of lignin by BiVO4
Voltammetric experiments for lignin oxidation by BiVO4 were performed with a single-cell compartment with a 3-electrode system: BiVO4 (working electrode), Ag/AgCl3 M NaCl (reference electrode), and Pt wire (counter electrode) connected to a potentiostat/galvanostat. To examine the photooxidation of lignin on the BiVO4 photoanode, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed in KHCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.2) at different concentrations of lignin at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under illumination from a 450 W Xe lamp equipped with a 400 nm cut-off filter. The light intensity was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 on the surface of the photoanode using an ILT 1400-A radiometer (International Light Technologies Co., USA). The photoelectrocatalytic reaction was further conducted in the 3-electrode system mentioned above with applied different anodic bias in the range from 0 to 800 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl).
Characterization of lignin photooxidation and products
2D 1H–13C HSQC NMR analysis was carried out by dissolving 20 mg of freeze-dried reaction samples in 0.5 mL of DMSO-d6, which were then transferred to NMR tubes. The NMR spectrum from the lignin sample was acquired at 25 °C on a 400 MHz FT-NMR (Bruker) instrument with a 5 mm BBO NMR probe. The central DMSO solvent peak was used as an internal reference (δH/δC 2.50/39.52 ppm). The HSQC parameters and NMR chemical assignments followed the previously published paper.22 For the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, 10 mg of freeze-dried reaction samples were acetylated with 0.5 mL pyridine and 0.5 mL acetic anhydride at 50 °C for 16 h. Modifying lignin with acetyl and propyl groups improved its incorporation into the matrix due to a correspondingly higher solubility. Therefore, lignin samples need to be derived (e.g., acetylation and methylation) to enhance the solubility in organic solvents before analysis.23,24 Acetylated reaction samples were obtained by centrifugation with deionized water and dried under vacuum at 35 °C. The acetylated samples were dissolved in THF at 4 mg mL−1 and filtered using a PTFE membrane filter (0.2 μm pore size) before GPC analysis. The average molecular weight distribution of the lignin sample was measured by GPC (Agilent 1200S equipped with an Optilab rEX (RI) detector). PLgel MIXED-C 5 μm, 7.5 × 300 mm and PLgel MIXED-E 3 μm, 7.5 × 300 mm columns were used with THF as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 30 °C. The calibration curve for the molecular weight was generated using polystyrene standards. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were collected using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Inc., USA) with one bounce reflectance diamond ATR crystal accessory, which was used to determine a modification in the internal structure of lignin before and after oxidation. The oxidation products were further analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Aqueous samples (20 ml) were acidified to pH 2–3 with HCl and thoroughly extracted three times with ethyl acetate. We acidified the lignosulfonate samples to protonate the products before extraction, which helps homogenizing and recovering the possible phenolic products from the aqueous phase.25,26 The organic layers of the extracts were collected and dried over anhydrous MgSO4, followed by rotary evaporation. Then, the residue was dissolved in 100 μL dioxane and 10 μL pyridine, followed by derivatization with 50 μL of BSTFA/TMCS in a water bath at 353 K for 45 min under constant shaking, and the resultant was used for GC-MS analysis. 4.00 μL of silylated samples were injected into a TG-5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and separation performed using a Trace 1300 GC instrument with an ISQ QD single quadrupole mass analyzer (Thermo Scientific Inc., USA). The analyses were performed using a splitless mode (split flow 52.2 mL min−1) with helium at 1.740 mL min−1. The inlet temperature was maintained at 573 K, MS transfer line at 553 K, and ion source at 553 K (electron ionization). The temperature gradient started at 318 K and was held there for 5 min, and then raised to 553 K at 10 K min−1, and was held there for a further 10 min. The MS was operated with the electron ionization mode (70 eV). For the analysis of oxidation products from alkali lignin and milled wood lignin, the samples were extracted with dichloromethane and analyzed using a GC–MS (Agilent) with a DB-5MS column (60 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was elevated from 323 K to 553 K. The product's mass spectrum was identified using an authentic library of standards. The mass analyzer range was set to 5–1050 a.m.u. (scan time 0.2 s) with positive ion polarity. The high resolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS) analysis was carried out with a microTOF-QII instrument (Bruker Corp., Germany) using the technique of electrospray ionization (ESI). Instrumental conditions were set as follows: spray voltage (IS) 4.5 kV, nebulizer temperature 180 °C, and sheath gas (nitrogen) flow rate, ca. 4 L min−1. The electrospray source was heated to 50 °C.
NADH regeneration and biocatalytic reduction in the lignin-fueled, unbiased PEC system
The BiVO4/perovskite solar cell tandem configuration was constructed based on a two-electrode system according to the literature.27,28 The photoelectrochemical NADH regeneration and biocatalytic reduction in the lignin-fueled PEC system were conducted in a two-cell compartment connected with a 3 M KCl salt bridge without an applied bias (0 V) under illumination using a 450 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter (light intensity: 100 mW cm−2). The BiVO4 photoanode was immersed in KHCO3 (10 mM, pH 8.2) containing a certain amount of lignin in a homemade large glass cell, whereas the carbon cloth cathode was immersed in a phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5) containing M (0.5 mM) and NAD+ (2 mM) in a disposable cuvette (2 mL). In full cell experiments, 8 mL of the lignin solution (0–5 mg mL−1) was added into a cuboid glass reactor. The distance between the perovskite solar cell and BiVO4 photoanode was 1.5 cm in the tandem structure, and the space was filled with the lignin solution. The regenerated amount of NADH was calculated from the absorbance increase at 340 nm using a V-650 UV/visible spectrophotometer. For biocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate coupled with lignin oxidation, TsFDH (10 U ml−1) was added to the above-mentioned cathodic component. CO2 was purged into the cathodic solution for at least 1 h before and continuously purged during the whole reaction (flow rate: 50 mL min−1). The formate concentration was determined by calculating the area of the formate peak from the sample solution (200 μL) diluted with 2 M H2SO4 (20 μL) for the inactivation of TsFDH, and the peak was detected using a Prominence LC-20A modular liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu Corp., Japan) equipped with an Aminex® HPX-87H ion exclusion column. For the GDH enzymatic reaction coupled with lignin oxidation, the reaction medium for the cathodic component consisted of NAD+ (2 mM), M (0.5 mM), α-ketoglutaric acid disodium salt dihydrate (50 mM), (NH4)2SO4 (250 mM), and GDH (40 U) in 3 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5). The L-glutamate concentration was analyzed using a 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, USA).

Results and discussion
Characterization of the nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode
We prepared nanoporous BiVO4 through a two-step process according to the literature;29 it involved (1) the electrochemical deposition of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (Fig. S1†) and then (2) the thermal transformation of BiOI into BiVO4 in the presence of a vanadyl acetylacetonate precursor. The resulting BiVO4 film exhibited a nanoporous network structure with agglomerated particles averaging 120 nm in diameter (Fig. 1a). Approximately 2.5 eV of the optical bandgap was estimated from the Tauc plot of UV-vis absorbance for nanoporous BiVO4 (Fig. 1b). Our X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the monoclinic scheelite structure of crystalline BiVO4 (PDF file no. 14-0688) (Fig. 1c). We examined the capability of thus-synthesized BiVO4 to oxidize lignin under illumination using a 450 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. According to our analysis using a linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) (Fig. 1d and S2†), we observed a significant increase in the oxidation current from −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) as well as a cathodically shifted oxidation onset potential (≈50 mV) in the presence of lignins (e.g., alkali lignin and lignosulfonate) under illumination, which were attributed to lignin's capability to capture photogenerated holes in BiVO4 and facilitate electron–hole separation. The oxidative photocurrent exhibited a proportional relationship to lignin concentration (0 to 5 mg mL−1) (Fig. S3†), implying that lignin oxidation is more favorable than water oxidation on the BiVO4 electrodes. In contrast, other non-lignin residues from cellulosic biomass, such as cellulose and xylan, had negligible effect on the photocurrent generation by BiVO4.

Photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin by BiVO4
The photoelectrochemical oxidation of alkali lignin was further investigated using a three-electrode configuration that consisted of BiVO4 as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl3 M NaCl as a reference electrode, and Pt wire as a counter-electrode. We analyzed the changes in the chemical structures of lignin during the photoelectrochemical oxidation using 2D-NMR spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 2 and S4,† characteristic linkages such as β-O-4 (blue colored A), β-5 (green colored B), and β–β (cyan colored C) were observed and they progressively disappeared during the prolonged photoelectrochemical oxidation. The results suggest that the oxidation of lignin occurred through the linkages with low bond dissociation energies (BDEs) such as 54–72 kcal mol−1 (β-O-4) and 54–63 kcal mol−1 (β-5), rather than the one with relatively higher BDE (β–β, 81 kcal mol−1).30 According to our analysis using gel permeation chromatography (Fig. S5†), a dramatic decrease in the high molecular weight of the lignin polymer was observed over time, which suggested the depolymerization of lignin into small molecules. The major fraction of untreated lignin was polymers of over 51000 Mw and the photoelectrochemical reaction caused a significant decrease of the molecular weight to less than 15000 Mw after a prolonged reaction of 12 hours, which clearly showed the fragmentation and degradation of the lignin macromolecules.

The photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin exhibited different oxidation characteristics depending on the structure of the original lignin. The photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignosulfonate occurred through a ring-opening oxidation of polymeric lignin with unspecific fragmentation into smaller substances. According to our analysis using FTIR (Fig. S6†), the absorption bands at 1420, 1512, and 1595 cm−1 corresponding to the aromatic skeletal vibrations in lignosulfonate31 disappeared after 3 hours, indicating the cleavage of the aromatic structure. We observed increased absorptions at around 1644 and 1719 cm−1, which correspond to the CO stretch in conjugated and unconjugated carbonyl/carboxyl groups, respectively. The results imply the conversion of aromatic ring structures into carbonyl (or carboxyl) groups. However, the oxidation of alkali lignin exhibited an increase in the CO stretch at around 1700 cm−1, while maintaining its aromatic ring vibrations at 1448, 1537, and 1625 cm−1. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis further showed that the majority of the oxidation product from alkali lignin was a carboxylated aromatic compound of diethyl phthalate (Fig. S7 and Table S1†), which is in good agreement with the FTIR results. This indicates that the aromatic ring structure of alkali lignin could be preserved during the photoelectrochemical oxidation process. The oxidation of other lignin species (lignosulfonate and milled wood lignin) yielded different kinds of carboxylated aliphatic and aromatic compounds, such as butanedioic acid, glycolic acid, benzoic acid, N-methoxymethyl-N-methylformamide, 1,1,3,3-tetrachloroacetone, and N-methyl-N(2-methylpropyl)formamide (Fig. S7, S8 and Tables S2, S3†). We speculate that the oxidation of lignin may differ from sources and pretreatment methods, which significantly affect the nature (e.g., the chemical structure and physicochemical properties) of the respective lignin substrate. The mass spectra from high-resolution mass-spectrometry (HR-MS) analysis further confirmed the fractionation of high-molecular weight lignin (Fig. S9†). However, it is worth noting that the prolonged over-oxidation reaction may further decompose the products into CO2 as the simplest form of oxidized carbonaceous materials. According to the literature,2,32,33 the photocatalytic oxidation of lignocellulosic biomass could generate CO2, which is sequestered as a carbonate. We believe that the issue of over-oxidation could be avoided by optimizing the reaction times (e.g., exchange of the anode electrolyte before complete oxidation) to obtain more chemicals.
A significant decrease in lignin's characteristic absorption was observed at around 280 nm associated with the etherified hydroxyl groups in the β-O-4 linkage as well as the hydroxyl/methoxyl groups linked to the aromatic rings of lignin units (Fig. S10a†).12 The results indicate the photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin, which was also evident from the decolorization of the lignin solution. Moreover, the oxidation of lignin also showed a clear dependency on the applied potential (Fig. S10b†) and negligible changes were observed under dark conditions. In addition, we confirmed that other lignocellulosic components such as cellulose and xylan exhibited a negligible effect on the oxidation of lignosulfonate by BiVO4 even at the same concentration as that of lignin (1 mg mL−1) (Fig. S11†). The results suggest that the BiVO4 electrode oxidizes lignin (rather than other components) because of the electrical activities of lignin originating from its diverse redox-active groups.
The reactive species such as h+, e−, ˙OH, H2O2, and ˙O2− produced by the photoelectrochemical redox process of BiVO4 are identified as the key active species for the C–C and C–O bond cleavage.34–38 We investigated the effect of triethylamine (TEA, hole scavenger), sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8, electron scavenger), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, hydroxyl radical scavenger) and sodium pyruvate (SP, H2O2 scavenger) on lignin oxidation by photoexcited BiVO4 (Fig. S12†). According to our results, the hole scavenger inhibited the oxidation of lignin, indicating that the lignin oxidation is driven by the photogenerated holes. The enhanced oxidation of lignin in the presence of an electron scavenger also supports the hole-driven oxidation of lignin, as the electron–hole separation of BiVO4 could be accelerated by the electron scavengers. Both TBA and SP exerted negligible effect on lignin oxidation, implying that the OH˙ radical and H2O2 did not play a dominant role. In addition, we tested the effect of reduced oxygen species that could be generated by the counter-electrode (Pt wire) during the reaction (Fig. S12e†). The oxygen reduction at the cathode did not affect the oxidation of lignin, which indicates that the superoxide species have negligible effect on the oxidation of lignin. Thus, we speculate that BiVO4 facilitates the direct transfer of photogenerated holes to lignin, which could lead to the weakening of C–C bonds and induce fragmentation and oxidation of lignin into organic acids.33,39 We also observed a negligible effect of dissolved oxygen on the oxidation of lignin by BiVO4. According to our 2D-NMR analysis (Fig. S13†), there was no significant difference in lignin oxidation under both O2 and N2 purged conditions, indicating that O2 is not involved in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin.
Bias-free photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin
According to our results (Fig. S10b†), an external bias of over 200 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 8.2) was required to drive lignin oxidation using the photoexcited BiVO4 electrode. To achieve the “bias-free” photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin, we have designed a tandem structure that consists of a BiVO4 photoanode and an organometallic perovskite PV. Considering the remarkable bandgaps (1.6 eV for perovskite and 2.5 eV for BiVO4), we expected that the potential of electrons generated from the BiVO4 electrode would be further elevated in the tandem structure where the photovoltaic absorbs the remaining part of the visible light passing through the photoanode. We chose the perovskite PV as a green option due to its superb photo-voltage output to drive the bias-free photoelectrochemical reaction, as well as its easy synthesis of solution processing that does not require an energy-intensive vacuum deposition process. We fabricated a large-area PV cell with a bandgap of ≈1.6 eV (active area: 1 cm2) on the base of a triple-cation perovskite absorber.40 The assembly with the PV led to a cathodic shift of 920 mV in the J–V profile of BiVO4 (Fig. 3a), which is consistent with the open-circuit voltage of perovskite (Voc, ≈0.94 V).28 The BiVO4–perovskite tandem system (BiVO4/PV) also exhibited an enhanced incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency up to 700 nm due to the photovoltaic effect of the perovskite solar cell (Fig. S14†).

The changes in the linear-sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves of the BiVO4/PV tandem structure and bare BiVO4 at various lignin (lignosulfonate) concentrations (0–5 mg mL−1) were recorded under visible light irradiation. A huge shift in the onset of oxidation (0.92 V) was induced by PV (100 mW cm−2, scan rate: 50 mV s−1). (b) Unbiased light-driven regeneration of NADH in the photoelectrochemical cell under various conditions. Reaction conditions: The cathode electrolyte contained M (0.5 mM) and NAD+ (2.0 mM) in a phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5); the anode electrolyte contained 5 mg mL−1 lignin in a KHCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.2); the geometrical surface area of BiVO4, the perovskite PV cell, and carbon cloth was 6, 1, and 2 cm2, respectively. 
To examine the effect of lignin concentration on the performance of the tandem cell, we tested the photocurrent generation from BiVO4/PV and bare BiVO4 (Fig. 3a). Note that the increasing amount of lignin did not significantly affect the generation of oxidative photocurrent from both configurations. In addition, the lignin solution did not show significant absorption over 440 nm (Fig. S15†), which would not interfere with the visible-light absorption by the PV. The results show that the perovskite solar absorber provides additional power with which unbiased photoelectrochemical lignin oxidation can be achieved.
Lignin-fueled, bias-free regeneration of NADH
We coupled photoelectrochemical lignin oxidation with the electrochemical reduction of a nicotinamide cofactor (NAD+) on a carbon cloth cathode (geometric surface area: 1 cm2). We observed this reduction via a mediator {M, [Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+} (Fig. S16†); the cathodic reduction peak of M at around −700 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 6.5) increased significantly due to the catalytic reaction in the presence of NAD+ (2 mM), which was attributed to the sequential electron transfer from the electrode to M and to NAD+. We observed highly efficient NADH regeneration upon light irradiation to the tandem BiVO4/perovskite compartment containing 5 mg mL−1 of lignin under no bias (Fig. S17†). The results imply that the lignin oxidation on a BiVO4 electrode provides most of the electrons required for NAD+ reduction, rather than through the slow reaction of water oxidation (i.e., without lignin). In contrast, NADH was not regenerated in the absence of the perovskite PV, indicating that the solar absorber is essential for the unbiased coupling of the reduction and oxidation reactions. Under illumination, the initial rate of NADH regeneration exhibited a proportional relationship to the lignin concentration, which was saturated at approximately 2.4 mM h−1 with 5 mg mL−1 lignin (Fig. 3b). Note that the lignin oxidation on the BiVO4 photoelectrode was also saturated at over 5 mg mL−1 of lignin as well as 0.7 mg mL−1 of guaiacylglycerol-beta-guaiacyl ether, a lignin model dimer, according to the LSV analysis (Fig. S18 and S19†). We attribute the saturation behavior to the limited number of active sites (and thus limited photocurrent generation) on the surface of the BiVO4 electrode for lignin oxidation at high lignin concentrations.
Lignin-fueled biocatalytic reduction
Building upon the successful regeneration of NADH in the unbiased PEC platform using lignin, we reduced CO2 to formate using an NADH-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Thiobacillus sp. (TsFDH) (Fig. S20†). In the lignin-fueled PEC system, the rate of formate synthesis (∼0.37 mM h−1) was 4.5 times higher than that of the reaction based on water oxidation (∼0.08 mM h−1) (Fig. 4a). The negative control results obtained without PV, TsFDH, NAD+, M, or CO2 confirm the critical role of each reaction component in facilitating the photobiocatalytic CO2-to-formate conversion. Our cyclic voltammetric analysis of the carbon cloth electrode in N2 and CO2 purged buffers showed that there was no sign of direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 under the applied potential up to −1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. S21†).
 Fig. 4  Bias-free photoelectrochemical lignin oxidation coupled with biocatalytic CO2 reduction. (a) A series of control experiments for formate formation in the unbiased tandem system. (b) Initial rate of formate formation at various lignin concentrations. Reaction conditions: The cathode electrolyte contained M (0.5 mM) and NAD+ (2.0 mM) in a phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5); the anode electrolyte contained 0–5 mg mL−1 lignin in a KHCO3 buffer (10 mM, pH 8.2); the geometrical surface area of BiVO4, the perovskite PV cell, and carbon cloth was 6, 1, and 2 cm2, respectively. 
Lignin concentration (1–5 mg mL−1) exhibited a proportional relationship to the rate of formate formation (Fig. 4b), which is in agreement with Fig. 3b. The results indicate that the oxidation of lignin is a rate-determining factor for its counterpart reaction of biocatalytic CO2 reduction through NADH regeneration. Obviously, because of the NADH-dependent nature of TsFDH, the increased NAD+ concentration showed a positive effect on the rate of CO2 reduction (Fig. S22†). The biocatalyst concentration also had a significant influence on the overall efficiency of CO2 reduction; however, the initial rate of formate formation versus the concentrations of TsFDH was saturated with a maximum (∼0.35 mM h−1) at 10 U TsFDH (Fig. S23†). This supports our assumption that electron transport by lignin oxidation is a rate-limiting step that governs the platform's overall efficiency. We further observed the production of 5.71 mM of formate after 24 hours of reaction (Fig. S24†). The slow rate of formate production at the initial reaction stage is attributable to the lag phase of NADH regeneration for reaching the equilibrium ratio of [NAD+]/[NADH] needed to drive TsFDH for CO2 reduction.21,41 Previous studies on biocatalytic CO2 reduction based on PEC platforms (e.g., α-Fe2O3/BiFeO3 photocathodes,42 Co-Pideposited α-Fe2O3/ITO,41 and triple-junction silicon on ITO/H-SiNW43) required an additional bias as high as 1.0 V (Table S4†). The lignin-fueled tandem PEC system achieved a high formate yield using only light; to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first example of the photoelectrochemical reformation of lignin coupled with biocatalytic fuel production from CO2 and visible light, which suggests an alternative solution for valorizing waste lignin to yield valuable chemicals.
In addition to the biocatalytic CO2 reduction, we tested another model reaction, selective amination of α-ketoglutarate into L-glutamate by L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (Fig. S25†). According to our results, the lignin-fueled PEC platform facilitated the biocatalytic reduction by GDH under unbiased conditions, which demonstrates its versatility for the environment-friendly utilization of lignin and the green synthesis of value-added chemicals.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the bias-free, photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin and biocatalytic reductions (e.g., CO2 to formate and α-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate) in a tandem photoanode/PV structure. Lignin oxidation using the BiVO4 photoanode produced small carboxylated organic molecules, and simultaneously supplied electrons to the cathode for NADH regeneration coupled with redox biotransformation using TsFDH and L-glutamate dehydrogenase. The tandem structure with a perovskite-based PV facilitated the unbiased operation of the PEC system by compensating for the potential gap between lignin oxidation and CO2 reduction through artificial Z-schematic absorption. The BiVO4-catalyzed oxidation of lignin (5 mg mL−1) allowed for rapid formate production (0.37 mM h−1), at a rate 4.5 times higher than that of the water oxidation-based reaction (0.08 mM h−1). Under no bias and using visible light as the sole energy source, the lignin-fueled photoelectrochemical platform achieved approximately 5.71 mM formate production within 24 hours. The current study hints at a new design for the unassisted artificial photosynthesis of value-added chemicals from waste lignin.
