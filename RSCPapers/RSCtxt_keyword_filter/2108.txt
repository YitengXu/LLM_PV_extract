The CSORG5 molecule possess facile synthesis, solution processability, visible light absorption, a properly matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level with conjugated polymers and moderate electron mobility, making the molecule an ideal acceptor for P3HT and other low band gap conjugated polymers. The BHJ organic solar cell constructed from a P3HT:CSORG5 (1:1) active layer processed from a DIO/THF solvent, exhibits a high open circuit voltage of up to 0.98 V resulting in an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.80%. Furthermore, the PCE is enhanced up to 4.16% when a thin layer of TiO2 is inserted between the active layer and the Al electrode.
Introduction
Among various photovoltaic technologies, organic solar cells have received immense attention because of their low cost, flexibility, chemical versatility and easy fabrication compared to other alternative solar cell technologies.1 Much effort has been paid in improving the power conversion efficiency of typical polymer/fullerene based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells up to 10%,2 where in, the fullerenes as acceptor are playing key role. The most common acceptor materials that are usually employed in BHJ organic solar cells are phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) owing to their large electron affinity and strong tendency to accepts the electron from the donor semiconductors, ability to form favorable nanoscale networks with donor conjugated polymers and high electron mobility.3 However the efficacy of fullerenes as acceptors was hampered by its weak absorption in the visible region and near IR-region, limited tunable HOMO and LUMO energy levels and expensive synthesis and purification procedures are the barrier to commercialization.4 In order to circumvent these drawbacks, it is highly desirable to develop new fullerene free acceptor materials, which exhibit favorable electron transport properties and broad absorption over the visible region of solar spectrum and bandgap tunability. Recently, some non-fullerene acceptors have been developed and a few materials showed efficiency over 2%.5 More recently, J. Pei et al. have reported PCE in the range of 2.11–2.90%, on fluoranthene fused imide derivatives based electron acceptors in solution processed inverted bulk hetero junction solar cells with P3HT as a donor.6 J. Yao et al. have reported high PCE 4.03%, on perylene diimide dimer-based non fullerene acceptor material for efficient solution processed BHJ solar cells.7a Recently, BHJ organic solar cells based on solution processed non-fullerene acceptors have shown PCE up to 4% .7b
Phenothiazine is a common heterocyclic compound acquiring electron rich nitrogen and sulphur hetero atoms and is known to depress the molecular aggregation due to its non-planarity.8a–d Owing to the unique optical and electrochemical properties, phenothiazine based supramolecules have been widely utilized in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), photovoltaic cells and organic thin film transistors. In continuation of our pursuits in the synthesis and application of phenothiazine based ruthenium and metal-free sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells, we are interested in the development of phenothiazine based small molecules for organic photovoltaic applications.8e–g
As a part of our ongoing research program, we have been engaged to develop new materials for DSSC8e–g,9 and OSCs.10 In this paper, we report synthesis and characterization of non-fullerene electron acceptor material CSORG5 and its application in solution processed OSC as acceptor. CSORG5 compound is a phenothiazine connected via a hexyl chain with a di-tert butyl carbazole unit, wherein the alkyl chain can improve the solubility. While the extra electron donor, di-tert-butyl carbazole unit can contribute to improvement in the molar extinction coefficient and, the malononitrile acts as good electron acceptor. The novel small molecule exhibited broad band absorption complementary to P3HT, appropriate energy levels matching with P3HT and moderate electron mobility. After optimization of processing of active layer, solution processed BHJ OSCs based on P3HT:CSORG5 (spin cast from DIO/THF) showed PCE as high as 2.80%, which is further improved up to 4.16%, when a thin layer of TiO2 was deposited in between active layer and Al electrode.
Experimental section
Materials and Instruments
The starting materials phenothiazine, carbazole, dibromohexane and malononitrile were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The solvents were purified by standard procedures and purged with nitrogen before use. All other chemicals used in this work were analytical grade and were used without further purification. All the reactions were performed under argon atmosphere unless and otherwise mentioned. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Avance 300 and 500 MHz spectrometer using TMS as internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on Shimadzu LCMS- 2010 EV model with ESI probe. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-Vis to near IR 3600 spectrometer. Electrochemical data were recorded using Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT30. The cyclic voltammogram curves were obtained from a three electrode cell in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 tetrahydrofuran solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, Pt wire as a counter electrode, Pt rod as a working electrode and NHE as reference electrode and calibrated with ferrocene.
Device fabrication and characterization
The solar cells were fabricated on an indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate with a structure ITO/PEODT:PSS/P3HT:CSORG5/Al. The ITO coated glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, ultra-sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. A thin layer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophe-ne):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Aldrich) of thickness 60 nm was spin coated from aqueous solution onto the top of ITO glass substrate and baked for 10 min at 120 °C in air. The solutions of P3HT (5 mg ml−1) and CSORG5 (5 mg ml−1) in either THF or DIO/THF were prepared and mixed by blending P3HT:CSORG5 in 1:1 ratio. The active layer was formed by spin coating the blend solution (1500 rpm for 25 s) onto the top of PEDOT:PSS layer, immediately covering with a Petri dish until dry. The dried substrates were then baked at 60 °C for 10 min before depositing the metal electrode. The metal contact was thermally deposited under vacuum on the top of active layer. The device area (0.25 cm2) was formed by the overlap between the deposited metal and the ITO layer. For the device with TiO2 layer, the thin TiO2 layer was deposited on the top of the active layer from a sol gel paste and dried in ambient conditions at a temperature 60 °C for 30 min, before the deposition of final aluminum (Al) electrode through thermal evaporation. Photovoltaic cells without protective encapsulation were subsequently tested AM1.5 G irradiation with illumination intensity using a solar simulator coupled with AM1.5 optical filter. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley source meter (model 2400). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured using a monochromator and xenon lamp as light source and resulting photocurrent was measured with source meter under short circuit condition.

Optoelectronic properties
Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of CSORG5 in THF solution and thin film. In solution, CSORG5 exhibited strong absorption with the maximum absorption coefficient of 1.85 × 104 and 1.69 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 330 nm and 455 nm, respectively. The thin film of CSORG5 shows significant broad absorption bands throughout 300 to 550 nm, relatively to that in solution with absorption peaks at 330 nm and 470 nm. In thin film, the longer wavelength absorption band was red shifted by 15 nm relative to that in solution and the optical band gap estimated from its absorption edge (565 nm) is 2.19 eV.
 Fig. 1  Optical absorption spectra of CSORG5 in solution and thin film. 
The oxidation and reduction potentials of CSORG5 were calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measured in THF solvent and the cyclic voltammogram is shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, CSORG5 exhibits irreversible oxidation and quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The onset oxidation and reduction potential vs NHE are 0.88 V and −1.32 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.58 eV and 3.40 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potential, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of NHE to be 4.7 eV below vacuum level. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are lower than those for P3HT (−4.95 eV and −3.00 eV).11 The difference in LUMO (0.40 eV) and HOMO (0.63 eV) between the CSORG5 and P3HT are sufficient enough for the efficient excitons dissociation.12 Moreover, the difference between the HOMO of P3HT and LUMO of CSORG5 is as large as 1.55 eV, which may results high Voc for polymer BHJ solar cells using P3HT and CSORG5 as electron donor and acceptor, respectively.

Photovoltaic properties
The current–voltage characteristics of the two devices using CSORG5:P3HT (1:1 weight ratio) BHJ active layer (device A as cast from THF and device B cast from DIO (3% vol)/THF) are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters i.e., short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency are complied in Table 1. The blend ratio with 1:1 wt shows best photovoltaic response with Jsc = 4.65 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V, FF = 0.41 and PCE = 1.75% (device A). The device showed quite high Voc as compared to devices based on PCBM acceptor which is attributed to the large difference between the LUMO level of CSORG5 and HOMO level of P3HT. When the active layer was spin coated from DIO/THF (device B) the Jsc, Voc and FF showed improvements up to 5.96 mA cm−2, 0.98 V and 0.48, respectively, leading to the PCE about 2.80%, a 60% enhancement as compared to that for device A. There is a significant increase in the Voc for the device based on solvent additive active layer as compared to counterpart device cast from THF solvent. The adsorbed high boiling point solvent additive i.e. DIO may render relaxation and self organization of the molecules, which promotes the intermolecular interaction and ordered packing13 and thus reduces defects and series resistance in film, resulting improvement in Voc.14 As the low value of Jsc using CSGOR5 as acceptor is low as compared to that with PCBM may be attributed to the higher value of LUMO level as compared to PCBM, forming a barrier for electron collection at cathode.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these three devices is shown in Fig. 4. These devices show broad plateau of IPCE spectra from 425 nm to 650 nm and closely resemble to the absorption bands of both CSORG5 and P3HT indicating both CSORG5 and P3HT are contributing to the photocurrent generation. The IPCE values for the device B are higher than that for the device A may be due to the increase in the crystallization of P3HT with the addition of solvent additive as reported in literature.15

The hole and electron mobilities in the BHJ active layer were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method with device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:CSORG5/Au and Al/P3HT:CSORG5/Al, respectively. The average hole and electron mobility for the blend cast from THF only were found to be about 8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. But when the BHJ active layer was cast from DIO/THF, the hole mobility improves up to 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility also increases 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The better charge transport is beneficial for the enhancement of Jsc, therefore the device B showed higher Jsc in comparison to device A. The electron/hole mobility ratio for device A and B are about 0.014 and 0.28, respectively. The improvement in the electron/hole mobility ratio for device B as compared to device A indicates the more balanced charge transport in device B is responsible for the increase in Jsc and FF.
The PCE of organic solar cell (device B) is still low and may be due to the mismatch between the optical absorption length and insufficient charge transport in the device.16 The optical absorption can be increased by increasing the thickness of the BHJ active layer, but this increases the probability of charge recombination that can decrease the carrier drift velocity by reducing the internal electric field. Therefore, proper structuring of the solution processed organic solar cell needed to increase the light harvesting within the thin active layer is very important. It has been reported that the light absorption can be enhanced by altering the spatial distribution of the optical electric field inside the device.17 It is well known that the optical interference between the incident and back reflected light, the intensity of the light at the surface of the metal electrode is zero. Therefore, the insertion of the optical spacer between the active layer and metal electrode can increase the optical absorption of the active layer. We have inserted a thin layer of TiO2 in between the active layer and metal electrode for device C. Fig. 3 also shows the current–voltage characteristics under illumination of the devices, with and without TiO2 layer and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 1. The Jsc and FF increase from 5.96 mA cm−2 and 0.48 to 7.28 mA cm−2 and 0.56 respectively, enhancing the over PCE from 2.80% to 4.16%. To understand the enhancement in Jsc, we have recorded the optical absorption of the active layer before and after the insertion of TiO2 layer and shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the absorption of the active layer between 350–700 nm increases with the incorporation of the TiO2 layer. The enhancement in the IPCE spectra of the device with TiO2 layer (Fig. 4), in this wavelength region is in good agreement with the increase in absorption of active layer. The enhancement in both absorption and IPCE leads to an increase in the Jsc and overall PCE.

We have also determined the maximum photo-induced carriers generation rate (Gmax) in the BHJ solar cells with and without TiO2 layer. Fig. 6a shows the effect of TiO2 optical spacer on the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the internal voltage (Vin) of the device with and without TiO2 layer under illumination. Jph was calculated as Jph = JL − Jd, where JL and Jd are the current density under illumination and in dark, respectively,18 Vin is determined as Vin = Vbi − Vappl, where Vbi is the built in voltage, which refer to the voltage at which Jph is zero, and Vappl is the applied voltage.19 As can be seen from Fig. 6a that Jph increases with the Vin at low voltage but Jph saturates at high voltage (1.8 V). At high voltages, the internal field is large enough to sweep out all the charge carriers to the electrodes and the saturated photocurrent (Jphmax) is limited only by the number of absorbed photons, can be expressed as. 
Jphast = qLGmax
(1)Where q is electronic charge, L is the thickness of the active layer and Gmax is the maximum photo-induced carrier generation rate per unit volume.20 The value of Gmax for the device without and with TiO2 layer is 4.18 × 1026 m−3 s−1 (Jphmax = 6.03 mA cm−2) and 5.45 × 1026 m−3 s−1 (Jphmmax = 7.85 mA cm−2), respectively. These values show that the Gmax increases after the insertion of optical spacer. Since the Gmax corresponds to the maximum number of photons absorbed by the active layer, such enhancement indicates that the absorption of light increases in the device with the incorporation of TiO2 in between the active layer and Al electrode.
 Fig. 6  (a) Variation of Jph and (b) charge collection probability (or) normalized photocurrent with saturated photocurrent with internal voltage Vin for the device B (without TiO2) and device C (with TiO2). 
The charge collection efficiency (Pc) is also a deciding factor for the PCE of an organic solar cell. We have also investigated the charge collection behavior in the devices with and without TiO2 layer. The Jph of the solar cell can be written as18,21 
Jph = qLGmaxPc
(2)where Pc is the charge collection efficiency. From above eqn (1) and (2), we have calculated the Pc by normalizing the Jph with Jphsat i.e. (Jph/Jphsat). Fig. 6b shows the charge collection probability (Pc) with respect to Vin under illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 6b that the value of Pc for device with TiO2 optical layer is higher than that for the device without TiO2. Therefore the TiO2 optical spacer increases both the light absorption and charge collection, thereby increasing the Jsc. As can be seen from the current–voltage characteristics of the devices in dark (Fig. 7), the TiO2 layer effectively reduces the leakage current in the reverse bias. The leakage current is due to the recombination of the charge carriers in the device and therefore the insertion of TiO2 effectively reduces the charge recombination.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage characteristics of device B (without TiO2) and device C (with TiO2) in dark. 
To get more information about the effect of TiO2 layer on the charge recombination mechanism in the device, we have measured the Jsc at different illumination intensities. The variation of Jsc with the illumination intensity in log–log scale is shown in Fig. 8. A power law dependence of Jsc upon the illumination intensity is generally observed in organic solar cells and can be expressed as. 
Jsc ∝ Iγ
(3)Where I is the illumination intensity and γ is the exponential factor.18,20a,22 The data shown in Fig. 8 were fitted to power law using eqn (3), we found the value of γ about 0.89 and 0.93, for the device without and with TiO2 layer, respectively. The higher value of exponential factor for the device with TiO2 layer than that for without TiO2 layer, indicates that bimolecular recombination is reduced for this device.23 This result agrees with an increase in charge collection efficiency and fill factor by inserting the TiO2 layer.
 Fig. 8  Dependence of Jsc with illumination intensity for device B (without TiO2) and C (with TiO2). 
We have also measured the electron and hole mobility of the devices using the P3HT:CSORG5 (DIO/THF cast)/TiO2, and found that the electron and hole mobilities are about 7.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The ratio of electron/hole mobility improves to 0.41 as compared to device B. The improvement in this ratio is also an indication of the reduction in recombination. As the conduction band edge of TiO2 is very close to the work function to Al cathode electrode, the collection of the electrons also improved for device C as compared to device B.
Conclusion
In summary, a novel D–A solution processed small molecule CSORG5 was developed as electron acceptor for polymer BHJ solar cells. It exhibits broad absorption spectra complementary to that P3HT and suitable HOMO and LUMO for efficient exciton dissociation. The BHJ solar cell based on P3HT:CSORG5 (1:1) active layer spin coated with DIO/THF solvent showed higher PCE about 2.80% as compared to the device processed from the THF solvent (PCE = 1.75%). The more balance charge transport is attributed to the higher value of Jsc and PCE for the device processed with DIO/THF solvent. The PCE has been further improved up to 4.16%, when a thin film of TiO2 layer was inserted in between the active layer and Al electrode. The incorporation of the TiO2 layer increases the charge collection efficiency due to the more balanced charge transport.
