    , Accepted 2nd July 2018First published on 4th July 2018AbstractA polymer donor material with appropriate energy levels and high light-harvesting capability is critical for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). Especially, it is a challenge to develop polymer donors which can simultaneously achieve both high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and transmittance for semitransparent PSCs. In this work, we designed and synthesized two new conjugated polymers PBT-F and PBT-SF which possess strong absorption features and appropriate energy levels as donor materials for PSCs. By using IT-4F as an acceptor, high Jsc values of over 21 mA cm−2 were obtained for both PBT-F and PBT-SF-based devices, showing promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.14% and 10.51%, respectively. Very importantly, the optimal PBT-SF:IT-4F blend film possesses a thinner thickness (∼80 nm) and high transmittance in the 400–600 nm region. The semitransparent PSCs based on PBT-SF:IT-4F showed an encouraging PCE of 7.76%, with a notable average transmittance of 39% and a high Jsc of 17.48 mA cm−2. These results demonstrate that PBT-SF is a promising polymer donor for high performance opaque and semitransparent PSCs.
Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and semitransparency.1–4 Open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are the three key parameters to determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC.5,6 Photoactive materials innovation (including donor and acceptor materials) is currently the major research focus in the development of PSCs. In recent years, the exciting progress on nonfullerene acceptors has provided great opportunities to improve the performance of PSCs, and the efficiencies of nonfullerene PSCs have been significantly promoted to over 13%.7–12 Unlike fullerene derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors exhibit broad and strong absorption features in the wavelength range of 650–800 nm, which can effectively enhance the photon-harvesting capability of the active layer. With regard to the development of matching polymer donors for efficient nonfullerene PSCs, several critical molecular design criterions should be kept in mind. Firstly, polymer donors should possess complementary absorption with nonfullerene acceptors in terms of enhancing light-harvesting of the active layer. Moreover, appropriate HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels of polymer donors are specially required to match with nonfullerene acceptors for achieving high Voc values and providing the driving force for exciton dissociation. What is more, a well-developed morphology with nanoscale phase separation and a bicontinuous donor/acceptor interpenetrating network between polymer donor and nonfullerene acceptor materials is critical for the photovoltaic performance of devices. Based on these molecular design principles, several donor polymers have been developed for highly efficient nonfullerene PSCs.10–16
In addition to aspiring to photoactive materials for highly efficient PSCs, the transparency of PSCs is also an important research issue. This is because semitransparent PSCs have great potential for use in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).17–23 Considering the fact that the light in the 400–600 nm region is most sensitive to human vision,24 it is essential to develop high-efficiency semitransparent PSCs with high transmittance in this region. Generally, the photoactive layer thickness should be thin enough to maintain the total transmittance of semitransparent PSCs. On the other hand, the incident light absorption ability of these devices will reduce upon decreasing the thickness of the photoactive layer, resulting in the decreasing Jsc value. Such an inherent trade-off between the transparency and photon-harvesting capability of the active layer should be the main reason for the lower efficiencies of semitransparent PSCs than their opaque counterparts. Therefore, it is challenging to develop photoactive materials which can simultaneously achieve high Jsc and transmittance for semitransparent PSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized two new polymer donors (namely PBT-F and PBT-SF, as shown in Fig. 1a) which possess strong and complementary absorption spectra and matching energy levels with the nonfullerene acceptor (IT-4F). Due to the positive effect of alkylthio side chains on lowering the HOMO level of molecules,25–29PBT-SF shows a lower HOMO level and slightly red-shifted absorption than PBT-F. The PSCs based on PBT-F:IT-4F showed a PCE of 9.14%, with Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 21.57 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.545. A higher Voc of 0.80 V and FF of 0.606 were obtained for the PBT-SF:IT-4F based device, achieving a higher PCE of 10.51%. The two devices exhibited very high Jsc values of over 21 mA cm−2 which should result from the strong photon-harvesting capability, good charge extraction and transportation properties of the active layer. Especially, the absorbance of the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend film is mainly located in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm, and the optimal thickness is 75–85 nm for the PSC device, and thus a high transmittance in the 400–600 nm region can be guaranteed for semitransparent PSCs. Attributed to these promising features, the semitransparent PSC based on PBT-SF:IT-4F exhibited a promising PCE of 7.76%, with a high Jsc value of 17.48 mA cm−2 and a notable average transmittance (AT, calculated from 400 to 600 nm) of 39%. Due to the thin thickness of the active layer, a high average visible transmittance (AVT, calculated from 370 to 740 nm) of 31% was obtained for this device. These results demonstrate that PBT-SF is a promising polymer donor for efficient PSCs and high transparency semitransparent PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of polymers
The chemical structures of PBT-F and PBT-SF are shown in Fig. 1a. PBT-F and PBT-SF were synthesized by Stille-coupling polymerization, and the detailed synthetic procedure is described in the ESI.† These two polymers are soluble in toluene, chloroform, and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBT-F and PBT-SF is 14.7 and 12.5 kDa, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.83 and 3.02, respectively (estimated by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C). The decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight-loss of the two polymers is estimated to be over 300 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating the good thermal stability of the two polymers.
Physicochemical properties

Fig. 1b displays the absorption spectra of PBT-F and PBT-SF in dilute chlorobenzene solutions and thin solid films on a quartz plate. PBT-F shows almost the same absorption profiles in solution and the thin film state. Attributed to the small polymer aggregates in solution, two clear vibronic peaks at 587 and 633 nm are observed in the absorption spectrum of PBT-F in solution. The thin film absorption edge of PBT-F is red-shifted by 17 nm than that in solution, corresponding to an optical band-gap of 1.77 eV. Due to the effective π–π stacking between the molecular backbones in the solid state, the PBT-F film shows a stronger shoulder peak at 635 nm. The PBT-SF thin film shows a weaker shoulder peak but a slightly red-shifted absorption spectrum (Eg = 1.76 eV) in comparison with PBT-F. Relative to PBT-F, PBT-SF exhibits stronger absorbance in the region of 300–650 nm (Fig. S2†). The energy levels of PBT-F and PBT-SF were measured by cyclic voltammetry. The onset oxidation potential (φox) of PBT-F and PBT-SF is 0.65 and 0.72 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and the onset reduction potential (φred) is −1.09 and −1.26 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO levels calculated from the φox and φred are −5.39 and −3.65 eV for PBT-F, and −5.46 and −3.58 eV for PBT-SF, respectively (Fig. 1c). Resulting from the positive effect of alkylthio chains on down-shifting the HOMO level, PBT-SF shows a lower HOMO level than PBT-F. Generally, lower HOMO level of a polymer donor can lead to higher Voc values of PSC devices.
The crystalline nature of the neat PBT-F and PBT-SF films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), both PBT-F and PBT-SF films exhibited high crystallinity with a strong (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.46° and 4.31°, corresponding to a d100-spacing of 19.78 Å and 20.47 Å, respectively. Moreover, clear diffraction (010) peaks at 2θ = 24.09° and 24.46° (d010 = 3.66 and 3.61 Å) were also observed for the PBT-F and PBT-SF films, respectively, indicating the ordered π–π stacking feature of these two polymer films.
Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the fundamental aspects of the molecular architectures of PBT-F and PBT-SF. As shown in Fig. 2, the LUMO distributions of PBT-F and PBT-SF are mainly delocalized at the acceptor and thiophene π-bridge units with some extension onto the donor unit, while the HOMOs of these two polymers are well-distributed along the whole conjugated backbones. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated to be −4.89 eV and −2.27 eV for PBT-F, and −5.04 eV and −2.42 eV for PBT-SF, respectively. These two polymers exhibit relatively good molecular planarity with similar dihedral angles.

Photovoltaic performances
The PSC devices with the conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PDEOT:PSS/PBT-F (or PBT-SF):IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performances of PBT-F and PBT-SF, where IT-4F10 and PFN-Br30,31 were used as the acceptor material and cathode interlayer, respectively. For the initial photovoltaic characterization, the donor (D)/acceptor (A) weight ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, and 1:2 (w/w) were scanned, and the optimal D/A is 1:1 for the PBT-F:IT-4F-based device and 1:1.5 for the PBT-F:IT-4F-based device (the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S1, ESI†). The optimal thickness of the active layer is 90–100 nm for the PBT-F:IT-4F blend and 75–85 nm for the PBT-SF:IT-4F blend. The optimal treatment for the PBT-F and PBT-SF based devices is using 1% N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) (v/v) as the solvent additive. Other processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) lead to poorer photovoltaic performances of the devices (Table S2†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are plotted and shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.

The device based on PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) exhibited a moderate PCE of 7.11%, with a high Jsc of 18.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.83 V, and a FF of 0.453. By treating the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend with 1% NMP as the solvent additive, the Jsc and FF values of the device were significantly enhanced to 18.96 mA cm−2 and 0.545, respectively, leading to a higher PCE of 9.14%. Due to the lower HOMO level of PBT-SF compared to PBT-F, a higher Voc of 0.86 V was obtained for the PBT-SF-based device, with a PCE of 7.18%, a Jsc of 16.68 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.499. After being treated with 1% NMP, the PBT-SF-based device exhibited a significantly enhanced PCE of 10.51%, with a notable Jsc of 21.53 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.606. Fig. 3b displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices. The optimal devices based on the two polymers exhibited a broad photo-to-current response in the range of 400 to 760 nm. The integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra are rather consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.
We further investigated the absorbance features of the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) and PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film (100 nm) displayed the highest absorbance of 0.62 at 642 nm. Due to its higher IT-4F content compared to that of the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend, the absorbance of the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend film was significantly enhanced in the 680–750 nm region which is the dominant absorption region of IT-4F. Interestingly, the absorbance of the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend film is mainly located in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm, while the absorbance in the 400–600 nm region is weak (green region in Fig. 4a). This unique feature of the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend film shows great potential for fabricating semitransparent PSCs, since wavelengths of 400–600 nm is most sensitive to human vision; thus high transparency of semitransparent PSCs in this region is highly required. Moreover, the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend film yielded a very high Jsc of 21 mA cm−2 in a very thinner film (∼80 nm), indicating the strong photon-harvesting capability and high transmittance of this blend film.

Encouraged by the above advantages of the PBT-SF:IT-4F blend for semitransparent PSC application, we fabricated semitransparent devices with the structure of glass/ITO/PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w)/PFN-Br/Au (1 nm)/Ag, and three different thicknesses (10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm) of the Ag cathode were investigated. The J–V curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c displays the transmission spectra of the BT-SF:IT-4F-based devices with different thicknesses of the Ag cathode. As shown in Table 2, the semitransparent PSC device with an Ag cathode thickness of 10 nm exhibited a PCE of 5.59%, with a high AVT of 39% and AT of 46%. When the Ag cathode thickness was increased to 15 nm, a higher PCE of 6.63% was achieved, and the AVT and AT slightly decrease to 36% and 43%, respectively. Notably, an encouraging PCE of 7.76% was obtained for the device with the 20 nm thick Ag electrode, and a high AVT of 31% and AT of 39% were maintained. Due to the trade-off between the transparency and photon-harvesting capability of the active layer, it is a challenge to develop highly efficient photoactive materials to achieve both high PCE and transparency for semitransparent PSCs. The emerging nonfullerene acceptors with strong NIR absorption provide new opportunities to achieve both high efficiency and transparency. Table 3 summarizes the state-of-the-art semitransparent PSCs with PCEs over 7% reported in the literature, and Fig. 4d shows the plot of the PCE versus AVT (or AT) of the corresponding semitransparent devices.20–23,32–35 As shown in Table 3, the highest AT of 37% for semitransparent PSCs was reported by Zhu et al., with a Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2 and PCE of 7.74%.22 Zhan et al. recorded the highest PCE of 10.12% for PTB7-Th:IUIC based semitransparent PSCs, with an AVT of 31% and Jsc of 18.31 mA cm−2.21 It should be pointed out that the high-efficiency semitransparent PSCs summarized in Table 3 are mainly beneficial for the development of nonfullerene acceptors with strong absorption profiles in the NIR region. In this work, we used an effective strategy by developing a new donor material with strong photon-harvesting capability in a very thin film state to realize a notable AT of 39% and a competitive PCE of 7.76% in semitransparent PSCs. Benefiting from a high AT of 39%, the background pattern of a flower can be clearly seen through the PBT-SF based semitransparent PSC with 20 nm Ag (Fig. 4e).

Charge carrier generation, extraction, recombination, and transport properties
The charge carrier (hole (μh) and electron (μe)) mobilities of the blend films were evaluated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 5a and S4 (ESI†), the μh and μe of the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film are 1.29 × 10−4 and 7.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a relatively balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.7. While a higher μh of 2.36 × 10−4 and μe of 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were determined for the PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film, with a μh/μe ratio of 2, the PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F blend films exhibited a relatively balanced μh/μe ratio of ∼2 which should be favorable for reducing charge recombination, since the ratio of μh/μe close to 1 indicates that holes and electrons can equally arrive at the electrode so as to reduce charge recombination. In comparison with the PBT-F:IT-4F blend, both higher μh and μe values were determined for the PBT-SF:IT-4F blend film, resulting in the higher FF value of the PBT-SF-based device.

The exciton and extraction properties of these devices were investigated by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff).36 As shown in Fig. 5b, Jph reached the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) at a high Veff value of 2 V, suggesting that all of the photo-generated excitons dissociated into free carriers and were collected by the electrodes. High Jsat values of 21.21 and 20.50 mA cm−2 were determined for the PBT-F and PBT-SF based devices, respectively, indicating the excellent light harvesting and exciton generation of the PBT-F and PBT-SF-based devices. The exciton dissociation efficiency of these PSC devices can be evaluated using exciton collection probability P (E, T), which is defined as Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions.37 The P (E, T) values of over 92% were determined for the PBT-F and PBT-SF-based devices, implying good charge extraction in both devices (Fig. 5c).
To further understand the recombination mechanism of these devices, we measured the dependence of Jsc values on light intensity (Plight) (in the range from 2 to 100 mW cm−2). The relationship between Jsc and Plight could be described as Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is an exponential factor which is approximately equal to the fitted slope of the plot on a log–log scale.38 If the bimolecular recombination is negligible, α should be equal to 1, while α < 1 indicates the existence of some bimolecular recombination.39 The α values of the PBT-F and PBT-SF based devices without any extra-treatment were fitted to 0.734 and 0.751, respectively (Fig. S6†). After processing with 1% NMP, a higher α value of 0.896 and 0.959 was fitted for the PBT-F and PBT-SF based devices, respectively, suggesting that the treatment with 1% NMP can effectively weaken the bimolecular recombination in these two devices. Compared with an α of 0.896 for the PBT-F-based device, a higher α of 0.959 was fitted for the PBT-SF based device (Fig. 5c), indicating weaker bimolecular recombination in the PBT-SF based device. Moreover, the trap-assisted recombination of these devices was investigated by plotting the Voc values versus logarithmic dependence Plight (Voc ∝ lnPlight).40 A slope of 1 × kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge) plotted for Voc ∝ lnPlight suggests that free-carrier bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, while a slope of 2 × kT/q indicates monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination in BHJ solar cells.40,41 As depicted in Fig. 5d, the fitted slopes are 1.53 and 1.39 kT/q for the PBT-F and PBT-SF based devices, respectively, implying that the monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination of the devices based on PBT-SF is lower than that of the PBT-F-based devices.

2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements were first performed to investigate the crystallization and relevant structural features of the optimal PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) and PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend films, with the 2D patterns and line-cuts shown in Fig. 6. Apparently, the PBT-F:IT-4F pattern exhibits a slightly enhanced (100) diffraction peak and a significantly stronger diffraction halo at ∼1.25 Å in comparison with the PBT-SF:IT-4F one. This phenomenon may indicate the over crystallization of the PBT-F:IT-4F blend, which may also further alter the phase separation and hinder the charge carrier transport. A similar trend can be found in the SCLC characterization; therefore the GIWAXS results depict the morphological difference between the PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F blend films and deliver a reasonable explanation for the solar cell performance. Importantly, both blend films displayed clear π–π stacking (010) scattering in the out of plane direction, implying the edge-on π–π stacking orientation of these blend films, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in PSC devices.42 Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to study the top surface of the PBT-F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) and PBT-SF:IT-4F (1:1.5, w/w) blend films. The surfaces of the as-cast PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F blend films exhibited a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.99 nm and 1.01 nm, respectively (Fig. S7a–d†). After processing with 1%NMP, the PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F blend films exhibited a larger Rq of 3.60 nm and Rq of 3.28 nm, respectively (Fig. 7a–d). The bulk morphology of these two blend films were further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S7e and f,† undefined phase separation is observed for the as-cast blend films of PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F. Very importantly, the treatment of 1% NMP for these blend films delivers clear and defined nanoscale phase separation with well-developed nanosize segregated crystallites (Fig. 7e and f), which should be in favor of high photovoltaic performance. The combination of morphology characterization results reveal that the PBT-F:IT-4F and PBT-SF:IT-4F blend films can favor a good morphology for efficient charge separation and transport, and thus high photovoltaic performance.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed two new conjugated polymers PBT-F and PBT-SF which possess strong absorption features and low-lying HOMO levels as donor materials for PSCs. By using IT-4F as the acceptor, high Jsc values of over 21 mA cm−2 were obtained for both PBT-F and PBT-SF-based devices, demonstrating a promising PCE of 9.14% and 10.51%, respectively. The high Jsc values of these devices were enabled by the strong and complementary absorption, good charge extraction and transportation, and favorable morphological properties with an end-edge on molecular orientation of the blend films. Especially, the PBT-SF:IT-4F blend film exhibited great potential for semitransparent PSC application as this optimal active layer exhibited a thinner thickness and high transmittance in the 400–600 nm region. The semitransparent PSCs based on PBT-SF:IT-4F showed a promising PCE of 7.76%, with a high AT of 39% and AVT of 31%. These results reveal that PBT-SF is a promising polymer donor for high performance opaque and semitransparent PSCs. Moreover, we demonstrate an effective strategy to simultaneously realize high Jsc and transparency by developing photoactive materials with strong photon-harvesting capability even in a very thin film state.
