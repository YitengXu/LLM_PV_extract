    , Accepted 7th March 2016First published on 15th March 2016AbstractA Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material is successfully synthesized via a co-precipitation process and a subsequent high-temperature solid state method. The chemical composition, structural characteristics and elemental distribution of the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material are investigated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). The results show that Mg is effectively and equably doped into the samples, which can replace partially Li+ in the cathode material. The electrochemical properties of the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material are evaluated and compared with those of the conventional Li1.5[Mn0.75Ni0.25]O2+δ cathode material. It can be found that the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. It can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 248.6 mA h g−1 and an improved initial coulombic efficiency of 87.9% at 0.1C with a cut-off voltage of 2.0–4.6 V. Moreover, the capacity retention reaches a relatively high value of 94.2% after 200 cycles at 0.5C. In contrast, the capacity retention of conventional Li1.5[Mn0.75Ni0.25]O2+δ is only 59.6%. In addition, the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material also shows excellent rate capability, which can display a discharge capacity of 130.1 mA h g−1 even at 10C and a capacity retention of 92.6% after 100 cycles at 5C. The enhanced electrochemical properties of the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material could be attributed to the introduction of Mg, which can effectively mitigate the structural deterioration of the material and facilitate the diffusion coefficient of Li+ during cycling.
Introduction
Nowadays, most of the countries in the world are focusing on sustainable development to solve the growing severity of environmental problems and energy crisis, and many countries are working hard in order to develop new green power sources.1–3 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as environmentally friendly and high efficiency energy storage devices, have been widely applied in many fields such as laptops, mobile phones, and wearable devices. At present, many efforts are focused on LIBs to expand their use in electric vehicles and energy storage equipment for intermittent power sources such as solar and wind.2,3 Thus, developing LIBs with low cost, high-power and high-energy density becomes an attractive research subject.4,5
Research on cathode materials is one of the key technologies to promote the development of LIBs.5–7 As a promising cathode for the next generation of LIBs, lithium-rich layered oxide materials with chemical compositions of xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2 (M = Mn, Ni, Co, etc. 0 < x < 1) have attracted much attention in recent years by virtue of their less environmental impact, low cost, wide working voltage range and high capacity.8–10 Especially, the discharge specific capacity of lithium-rich layered oxide materials (>250 mA h g−1) is far superior to that of the current commercialized cathodes such as LiMn2O4 (∼120 mA h g−1), LiCoO2 (∼140 mA h g−1), LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (∼160 mA h g−1) and LiFePO4 (∼160 mA h g−1).11–17
In spite of these merits, however, lithium-rich layered oxide materials have several drawbacks which impede their application in practical energy storage devices, including the large irreversible capacity in the first cycle, obvious capacity fading and voltage degradation upon repeated cycling, and insufficient rate capability. The large initial irreversible capacity can be attributed to the irreversible removal of Li2O formed by Li2MnO3 activation in the initial charge–discharge process.18–20 Moreover, the intensive removal of Li+ during cycling can cause the rearrangement of the transition-metal ions, which leads to phase transformation from the original layered structure to a nanocomposite where spinel-like regions are embedded in a layered LiMO2 framework,21–24 and the instability of the generated spinel-like phase results in gradual capacity loss, voltage degradation and low diffusion velocity of Li+ related to poor rate capability.25–29
To improve the electrochemical properties, numerous approaches have been tested. The surface modification of the cathode material with a thin layer of an inert metal compound is usually considered as one of the effective technologies, such as fluoride (AlF3), oxides (ZnO, ZrO2, and Al2O3) and phosphate (FePO4).30–34 The surface coating layer can protect the inner cathode material from attack by the acidic species such as HF and oxidation of carbonate solvents at high voltages, leading to suppression of the side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, and then the capacity fading can be alleviated.33,35 But the surface coating layer is usually so heterogeneous and thin that it could not provide persistent protection against continuous acidic species attack, resulting in a slow capacity attenuation during long-term cycling.36,37 Furthermore, the surface coating layer could not stop the layered-to-spinel transformation, and thus has no effect on the voltage degradation.35,38 Element doping is another effective method to improve the electrochemical performance and structural stability of layered cathode materials.39–41 Previous studies on the layered oxide material LiMO2 (M = Mn, Ni, Co, etc. 0 < x < 1) have indicated that during the preparation of LiMO2, the cation disorder occurs because the ionic radius of Li+ (ion radius 0.076 nm) is similar to that of Ni2+ (0.069 nm). Thus, the Ni2+ can easily occupy Li+ sites in the Li layer after calcination.42–44 This phenomenon gives us a possibility to achieve Li+ site substitution with the alien atoms in the lithium-rich layered oxide cathode material. Mg2+ (ion radius of 0.072 nm), as an electrochemically inert alien cation, has its ionic radius close to that of Li+ (0.076 nm), so it is possible to place Mg2+ at the desired Li+ site.45 Generally, Mg2+ in the Li layer can provide structural support during cycling, thus enhancing the cycling stability of the lithium-rich layered oxide material.46 Integrating the perspectives of the present studies, Mg doping becomes a possible candidate.
Conventionally, a Mg-free precursor was first prepared, and then mixed with an appropriate amount of Mg(OH)2 (or MgO) and Li2CO3 (or LiOH·H2O), and finally calcined at a high temperature to produce Mg-doped lithiated compounds.45,47 However, this approach may not ensure that the Mg distributes uniformly in the particles. In addition, the Mg-doped cathode material can be prepared by a sol–gel method,48 but this approach is not suitable for large-scale applications. Herein, we synthesized a carbonate precursor with an appropriate magnesium content by a co-precipitation process, and then the precursor was thoroughly mixed with desired amounts of Li2CO3, and calcined to form the final cathode material. The structures, morphologies and electrochemical properties of the Mg-doped lithium-rich layered oxide material were studied in detail.
Experimental section
Synthesis of the Mg-doped and conventional lithium-rich layered oxide materials
A Mg-doped Li1.4Mg0.1[Mn0.75Ni0.25]O2+δ (ML) cathode material was synthesized by a co-precipitation process and a subsequent high-temperature solid state method. At the beginning of the process, a 1.6 mol L−1 mixed aqueous solution of MnSO4, NiSO4 and MgSO4 with a molar ratio of 30:10:4 was slowly pumped into a stirred reactor at a designed flow rate. Synchronously, a 1.6 mol L−1 solution of Na2CO3 as a precipitant and a desired amount of NH3·H2O solution as a chelating agent were separately fed into the reactor, and then the Mg-doped [Mn0.75Ni0.25Mg0.1]0.91CO3 (MP) precursor can be formed by strictly controlling the stirring speed (∼600 rpm), pH (∼7.5) and temperature (∼55 °C) of the reaction system. The as-obtained precursor was washed several times, and then oven-dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the precursor was pre-sintered for 6 h at 500 °C for converting it into oxide powder. To prepare the final cathode material, a desired amount of Li2CO3 was thoroughly mixed with the as-prepared oxide powder by grinding. After that the mixtures were calcined at 850 °C for 12 h, and then cooled down to room temperature. To make a comparison, the conventional Mn0.75Ni0.25CO3 (CP) precursor and the Li1.5[Mn0.75Ni0.25]O2+δ (CL) cathode material were prepared in a similar way.
Materials characterizations
An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscope (ICP-OES, Optima 7300 DV, Perkin Elmer Co., USA) was used to analyze the chemical compositions of the MP, CP, ML and CL samples. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDXS) (JSM-6100LV, JEOL, Japan) was used to investigate the morphology and elemental distribution of the resulting samples. To observe the crystalline phase of the samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8, Bruker AXS GmbH, Germany), equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) and a graphite monochromator, in the scattering angle (2θ) range of 10–80° in a continuous scan mode with a scan rate of 4° min−1. For Rietveld structure refinement, the diffraction patterns were collected in the scattering angle (2θ) range of 10–110° at a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 2 s per step, and the structural analysis was carried out using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) program. The positive electrodes after 200 cycles were rinsed using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to remove the electrolyte from the surfaces of electrodes in a glovebox, and then dried to remove the residual DMC.
Electrochemical measurements
In order to fabricate the positive electrodes, an 80:10:5:5 (wt%) mixture of the as-prepared cathode materials, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), graphite and acetylene black, was dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solution, and homogenized for 1 h at 800 rpm, and then the slurry was coated onto a thin Al foil and dried at 110 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The dried electrode was pressed, and then punched into circular films with a diameter of 10 mm and the loading mass of the active material is 4–5 mg cm−2. CR2025 coin cells were assembled in a glovebox using lithium foil as the anode, 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in a solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) = 1:1 as the electrolyte, and a porous polypropylene based membrane (Celgard) as the separator, in an argon atmosphere. Finally, these coin cells were tested on a Neware battery test system (CT-3008, Neware Co., China) at different current densities in the range of 2.0–4.6 V (vs. Li+/Li) to evaluate their electrochemical properties. Furthermore, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was applied to estimate the diffusion velocity of Li+, and the test results were collected by charging and discharging the cells for 10 min at 0.1C (1C = 200 mA g−1) between 2.0 and 4.6 V, and then keeping the cell in an open-circuit voltage (OCV) for 60 min.
Results and discussion

Table 1 shows the ICP-OES results of the as-obtained samples. The concentrations of Li, Ni and Mg in CP, CL, MP and ML samples are normalized by fixing the molar concentration of Mn in each sample at 0.75. As shown in Table 1, the concentrations of Mn and Ni in the CL cathode material and Mn, Ni and Mg in the ML cathode material after calcination are in accordance with those in CP and MP precursors, as desired. Especially the Mg contents in the MP precursor and ML cathode material are in accordance with the target stoichiometric concentrations, and the presence of Mg in the ML cathode material makes the concentration of Li in ML lower than that in CL, as expected.

Fig. 1 exhibits the SEM images of the as-prepared samples, and each sample reveals a typical analogous spherical morphology with an average size of approximately 8 μm. The MP (Fig. 1a) and CP (Fig. 1b) precursors are comprised of similar nanosized primary grains, which indicate that the introduction of Mg will not affect the morphology of the precursor. As illustrated in Fig. 1c and d, some mesopores can be clearly observed on the surface of the particles, which could be related to the CO2 escaping after calcination. According to the literature, this porous structure can conduce to electrolyte percolation.46 In addition, it is easy to distinguish the ML (Fig. 1c) and CL (Fig. 1d) cathode materials due to the very different size of the primary grains making up the particles of cathode materials, and this result may indirectly demonstrate that the addition of Mg can affect the growth of primary grains. Moreover, to further analyze the distribution of Mn, Ni and Mg elements in the samples, the MP precursor and the ML cathode material were examined via EDXS. Fig. 2 shows the EDXS mapping of the Mn, Ni and Mg elements in the MP and ML samples. It can be seen that all the elements evenly disperse in the MP precursor and ML cathode material. Combined with the EDXS data and previous ICP-OES results, the conclusion can be drawn that the co-precipitation process and the subsequent high-temperature solid state method can make the Mn, Ni and Mg elements effectively and equably distribute in the samples.

Fig. 3 displays the XRD patterns of all the as-obtained samples. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, it can be found that each of the precursors (MP and CP precursors) has a typical hexagonal structure with the space group of R3c, corresponding to MnCO3 rhodochrosite.49,50 This result indicates that the introduction of Mg will not influence the crystalline structure of the precursor. As presented in Fig. 3b, all the peaks of ML and CL cathode materials can be well indexed based on the hexagonal α-NaFeO2 type structure with the Rm space group.26,51 Besides, the weak superlattice reflection peaks appearing between 20° and 25° are similar to those observed in Li2MnO3, which correspond to the C2/m space group. This characteristic could be caused by the short-range superlattice ordering of the Li, Ni and Mn atoms in the transition metal layers.38 Meanwhile, the separations between the two pairs of the (006)/(102) and (018)/(110) peaks of ML and CL cathode materials can be clearly observed, suggesting a well-organized layered structure.31,52 In addition, no impurity peaks related to the Mg-related compounds can be found from the XRD patterns in two cathode materials, and this result demonstrates that the Mg has been completely introduced into the lattice. To further determine the effect of Mg doping on the crystalline structure of the ML cathode material, the full spectrum fitting and atomic structure refinement with GSAS software have been carried out. The XRD patterns of the ML cathode material calculated by Rietveld refinement are shown in Fig. 3c, and the related Rietveld parameters are listed in Table 2. Based on the above results, it can be found that the Mg2+ prefers to occupy the Li+ (4h) site in the Li2MnO3 (C2/m) phase, and the related atomic arrangement and the structure of the C2/m phase in the ML cathode material are shown in Fig. 3d. It can be seen that the introduction of inert Mg2+ into the Li+ (4h) site could play the role of a pillar to stabilize the crystal structure during cycling, since it can suppress the migration of TM ions into Li sites and enhance the structural stability of the material, and then the phase transformation from layered to spinel-like structure and the deterioration of the generated spinel-like phase can be effectively mitigated.25,46

Li/ML and Li/CL cells were operated at a current density of 20 mA g−1 (0.1C) between 2.0 and 4.6 V to research the electrochemical characteristics in the first and second charge–discharge processes. As presented in Fig. 4, it can be observed that both Li/ML and Li/CL cells exhibit high discharge capacities (>240 mA h g−1) with the electrochemical characteristics of the lithium-rich layered oxide material. The initial charge curve can be decomposed into two sections: (1) the first sloping region ranges from 2.0 to 4.5 V, including the oxidation of the transition metal ions and extraction of Li+ from the layered LiMO2 framework; (2) the second long plateau region above 4.5 V, where Li2MnO3 was activated. The activation of Li2MnO3 can cause the irreversible extraction of Li+ and the accompanied oxygen loss, which directly results in the irreversible capacity.53 The charge capacities resulting from the first sloping region are similar for Li/ML and Li/CL cells, but the charge capacity corresponding to the second long plateau region of the Li/ML cell is lower than that of the Li/CL cell. The shorter second plateau could be ascribed to the impact of the inactive Mg2+ and the formation of a stronger Mg–O bond which can suppress the irreversible extraction of Li+ and the accompanied oxygen loss in comparison to the Li–O bond.47 Thus, the Li/ML cell can exhibit a higher initial coulombic efficiency (87.9%) than the Li/CL cell (77.5%). Additionally, in the second charge process, the voltage plateau above 4.5 V disappears, which could be caused by the irreversible structural change in the initial cycle.54,55

To investigate the cycling performance of the ML and CL cathode materials, the Li/ML and Li/CL cells were tested at 0.5C for 200 cycles in the voltage range of 2.0–4.6 V, after 3 cycles at 0.1C, as shown in Fig. 5a–c. As seen from the results, the Li/ML cell shows excellent cycling performance, and it exhibits a discharge capacity of 232.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and a discharge capacity of 218.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 94.2%. In contrast, the Li/CL cell can reach a discharge capacity of 226.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, but the capacity retention of the Li/CL cell is only 59.6% after 200 cycles, which is far below that that of the Li/ML cell. In addition, the voltage fading of Li/ML cell cannot be apparently observed, while that of the Li/CL cell was extremely serious with the increase of the cycle number.

Discharge capacity comparisons of Li/ML and Li/CL cells during cycling (f) above 3.5 V and (g) below 3.5 V. 
It is generally known that the primary factor for the gradual capacity loss and voltage fading should be ascribed to the phase transformation from layered to unstable spinel-like structure.21–24 Thus the differential capacity vs. voltage (dQ/dV) curves and electrochemical evolutions of Li/ML and Li/CL cells were provided to thoroughly research the electrochemical reactions that occurred during cycling. Fig. 5d and e show the dQ/dV curves of Li/ML and Li/CL cells cycled at 0.5C in the voltage range of 2.0–4.6 V, respectively. According to recent reports in the literature, the redox reactions in about the 3.0 V region are ascribed to the layered-to-spinel transformation, and the Li+ intercalation/deintercalation redox reactions of the layered LiMO2 mainly occur at voltages higher than 3.5 V.25 As seen from the results, apparent polarization exists in the Li/CL cell after 200 cycles. In contrast, the ML displays inconspicuous polarization. Furthermore, the peak intensity not only above 3.5 V, but also below 3.5 V for the Li/CL cell decreases dramatically during cycling, while that for the Li/ML cell decreases slightly, implying that the Mg doping can mitigate the conversion from the layered to spinel-like phase and the deterioration of the generated spinel-like phase. Thus, the Li/ML cell shows a weaker voltage fading than the Li/CL cell. Meanwhile, the discharge capacity comparisons of Li/ML and Li/CL cells during cycling above 3.5 V and below 3.5 V were collected, and are shown in Fig. 5f and g. Due to the layered-to-spinel transformation, theoretically, the decrease of discharge capacity above 3.5 V should be compensated by the increase of discharge capacity below 3.5 V. However, the Li/CL cell shows continuous capacity fading in the lower voltage region (<3.5 V), which could be associated with the deterioration of the spinel-like phase during cycling. Compared to the Li/CL cell, the Li/ML cell can manifest a significantly reduced discharge capacity fading above 3.5 V, and a remarkable increase of discharge capacity below 3.5 V, which is approximate to the decrease of discharge capacity above 3.5 V, further revealing the mitigation of the evolvement of the spinel-like component. It has to be said here that the Mg doping cannot solve the problem once for all, but it can truly mitigate the structural degradation during cycling.
To further confirm this fact that the Mg doping can enhance the structural stability of the ML cathode material, the electrodes of ML and CL cathode materials after 200 cycles were collected and then investigated by SEM measurements. The morphologies of the electrodes of ML and CL cathode materials are presented in Fig. 6a and b, separately. It can be clearly observed that both of the ML and CL electrodes were composed of spherical cathode materials and other residue which may be polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), graphite and acetylene black. Furthermore, the morphology of the CL cathode material looks significantly aggregated and pulverized. In contrast, the ML cathode material exibits great difference, and the spherical morphology can be maintained well after cycling. These results can further reinforce that Mg doping can efficiently enhance the structural stability of the ML cathode material during cycling.

The rate capabilities of Li/ML and Li/CL cells were studied by charging and discharging the cells at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 7a. Firstly, the Li/ML and Li/CL cells were charged and discharged for 5 cycles at 0.1C to activate them. Then the cells were charged at 0.2C before each discharge, and discharged at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C and 10C for 5 cycles. Finally, the current density decreased from 10C to 0.1C. It can be found that the discharge capacities of Li/ML and Li/CL cells decrease with increasing current density, but the discharge capacities at different current densities from 0.2C to 10C for the Li/ML cell were much higher than those for the Li/CL cell. Significantly, the Li/ML cell displays a discharge capacity of 248.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 130.1 mA h g−1 even at a high rate of 10C, whereas only a considerably low discharge capacity of 65.4 mA h g−1 can be maintained for the Li/CL cell at the same rate of 10C. Additionally, there is a slight fading on the capacity of the Li/CL cell when the current density decreases from 10C to 0.2C, but the capacity of the Li/ML cell can be recovered quickly. To further investigate the cycling performance of Li/ML and Li/CL cells at high current density, after the rate capability test, the cells were tested at a high rate of 5C between 2.0 and 4.6 V, as illustrated in Fig. 7b–d. The Li/ML cell can deliver an elevated discharge capacity of 169.0 mA h g−1 and an excellent capacity retention of 92.6% after 100 cycles. In contrast, the Li/CL cell can only display a discharge capacity of 118.7 mA h g−1 and a relatively low discharge capacity of 65.7 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, in which the loss is more than 55.3% relative to the first discharge capacity. Furthermore, it has been found that the rate capability and high rate cycling performance of the ML cathode material in this work is superior to most of the recently reported results. Specifically, compared with other studies, such as Al-doped (∼100.0 mA h g−1 at 4C), Y-doped (107.0 mA h g−1 at 2C) and Sn-doped (137.8 mA h g−1 at 5C) lithium-rich layered oxide materials,56–58 the rate capability of the ML cathode material in our work is much better than that of others. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the Mg doping, because the introduction of inert Mg2+ into the Li+ (4h) site can efficiently enhance the structural stability of the ML cathode material during cycling processes. Meanwhile the smaller primary grains of the ML cathode material compared with those of the CL cathode material can reduce the diffusion path of Li+, and then facilitate the diffusion velocity of Li+ in the material,59,60 which is in significant correlation with the rate capability of electrode materials.61–63 Thus, the ML cathode material displays superior electrochemical properties.

To intensively explore the origin of the improved rate capability of the ML cathode material, GITT, as a reliable method to explore the chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ (DLi+) in electrode materials, was carried out. Firstly, the cells were charged/discharged at 0.05C for activation in the voltage range of 2.0–4.6 V. Then the cells were charged at a constant current for an interval τ of 10 min, and the current density is 0.1C. Subsequently, the cells were kept in an open-circuit voltage (OCV) for 60 min to allow the voltage to relax to the steady-state value, Es. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a and b demonstrate the GITT curves of Li/ML and Li/CL cells at room temperature, and dE/dx and dE/dt1/2 as a function of stoichiometry x in the charge procedure are displayed in Fig. 8c and d, respectively, whereafter the value of DLi+ can be calculated by using the following eqn (1). (1)where Vm (cm3 mol−1) is the molar volume of the sample, which is deduced from the crystallographic data. S (cm2) represents the active surface area of the electrode, and L (cm) stands for the diffusion length of Li+.
 Fig. 8  The GITT curves of (a) Li/ML and (b) Li/CL cells as a function of time between 2.0 V and 4.6 V; (c) dE/dx, (d) dE/dt1/2, and (e) the calculated DLi+ values for the Li/ML and Li/CL cells as a function of the stoichiometry x. 
As seen from Fig. 8e, each of the DLi+ values of Li/ML and Li/CL cells show a n-type variation along with the change of stoichiometry x. For the Li/ML cell, the DLi+ can remain at almost a constant value (∼1.11 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) during a wide range of stoichiometry x between 0.28 and 0.93. In contrast, for the Li/CL cell, the average DLi+ value is about 6.91 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 in a relatively narrow range of stoichiometry x between 0.50 and 0.92. The GITT results further prove that the excellent rate capability of the ML cathode material could be associated with the Mg doping, which can provide a stable and high-efficiency path for Li+ intercalation/deintercalation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this work reports a scalable and effective Mg doping strategy for Li-rich cathode materials. The electrochemically inactive Mg2+ can be introduced into Li+ sites via the co-precipitation process and the subsequent high-temperature solid state method, and the electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Mg doping can not only improve initial coulombic efficiency and rate capability but also alleviate capacity fading and discharge voltage degradation of the material. The enhanced electrochemical properties of the material can be related to the addition of Mg, which can effectively mitigate the structural deterioration during repeated charge/discharge cyclic processes, and build a stable and high-efficiency path for Li+ intercalation/deintercalation. Therefore, the Mg doping approach may be a novel and beneficial methodology to overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of the current lithium-rich layered oxide materials.
