    , Accepted 25th March 2011First published on 27th April 2011AbstractDiscrete spherical polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles with a uniform diameter of ∼85 nm and electrical conductivity of ∼10 S cm−1 were fabricated by chemical oxidative polymerization within micelles composed of myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MTAB) and decyl alcohol as the nanoreactors. A methanol-based colloidal dispersion containing 5 wt% PPy was dropcast directly onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to use as counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The surface resistivity of the PPy layer on the FTO glass decreased from 624 to 387 Ω sq−1 after post-doping with concentrated HCl vapor for 1 min. The DSSCs made of PPy/FTO and HCl-doped PPy/FTO CEs exhibited power conversion efficiencies of ∼5.28 and ∼6.83%, respectively under standard AM 1.5 sunlight illumination. The post-doped and highly oxidized PPy allowed the electrons to move into the PPy layer readily and facilitated the electrocatalytic reaction of the I3−/I− redox couple, giving enhanced cell performance. Moreover, the cell efficiency was enhanced to ∼7.73% with further fine tuning of the electrolyte composition, which is comparable to the value (∼8.2%) using conventional Pt CEs.
Introduction
Since the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) composed of a nanocrystalline TiO2 working electrode, sensitizer dye, electrolyte, and platinized counter electrode (CE), introduced in 1991,1 has shown great promise as low-cost, highly efficient power generator for green and renewable energy sources.2,3 Recently, extensive studies of the individual components of DSSCs have been carried out to reduce production costs and achieve optimal cell performance.4–12 In DSSCs, the CE is one of the most important and indispensable components.13 The reactions at the CE rely on the type of redox couple in the electrolyte. Traditionally, the I−/I3− couple has been adopted as the redox mediator. I3− ions generated after electron injection from 3I− ions into the oxidized dyes are reduced in the CE. Generally, platinum (Pt) layer-loaded transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates, such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and indium tin oxide (ITO), have been widely used as CEs because of their high conductivity and catalytic activity for reducing I3− ions. Although platinized CEs might be the best choice for the realization of high-performance DSSCs, the noble metal Pt is one of the most expensive components in DSSCs. Moreover, it was reported that the presence of a small amount of water in the electrolyte can lead to the corrosion of Pt.14 Therefore, developing a practical, cost-effective alternative to Pt-based CEs has become a major goal in this field.
In recent years, efforts have been directed toward conducting polymers, with potential uses such as conducting substrates, hole conductors, and CEs for DSSCs due to their advantages of tunable conductivity, high catalytic activity, and low material cost.15–26 Polyaniline (PANI)19–21 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),22–26 have been adopted as CEs for DSSCs. In particular, PEDOT electrodeposited on conducting substrates increased the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs to ∼8%,25,26 which is close to that of a conventional Pt CE. PEDOT prepared by electrochemical polymerization exhibits high conductivity, catalytic activity, and good adhesion on conducting substrates. Unfortunately, however, since PEDOT is much more expensive than other conducting polymers and is only electrodeposited within a limited area of the electrode, the production costs can increase. Among the known conducting polymers, polypyrrole (PPy) is of special interest due to its easy synthesis, high conductivity, excellent stability in air, low cost, and high polymerization yield (>90%) under conventional synthetic conditions compared with PEDOT.27 However, a few studies have examined PPy-based CEs in DSSCs.28 Therefore, these advantages of PPy motivated us to explore its feasibility as an alternative material to Pt CEs.
Here, we report on spherical PPy nanoparticles coated on FTO glass as a highly efficient CE for DSSC applications. Monodisperse and spherical PPy nanoparticles, with a high polymerization yield of ∼93%, were fabricated easily within micelle templates by chemical oxidative polymerization. To improve the performance of the PPy-based CE, the effects of HCl vapor treatment and electrolyte composition on the conversion efficiency were also systematically investigated.
Experimental
Synthesis of spherical PPy nanoparticles
A typical synthesis proceeded as follows. Myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MTAB) (6.73 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (200 mL), and decyl alcohol (3.17 g, 20 mmol) was added to the solution with stirring for 1 h. The resulting milky-white mixture was ultrasonicated for 20 min until it became transparent. Then, doubly distilled pyrrole monomer (4.03 g, 60 mmol) was added to the solution and stirred for 1 h. After further ultrasonication for 10 min, FeCl3 solution (120 mmol dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water) was added to the above monomeric solution. After polymerization for 3 h at 25 °C, the resulting PPy was filtered and washed with methanol and distilled water several times for purification, and then dried in a freeze-dryer for 24 h. From the FT-IR and XPS analyses, we found that the MTAB and FeCl3 were thoroughly removed from the final products by filtering and washing (data not shown). The polymerization yield of PPy nanoparticles was as high as 93.2%.
Preparation of PPy nanoparticle CEs
PPy nanoparticles (2.0 and 5.0 wt%) were re-dispersed in methanol (5 g) and ultrasonicated for 2 h to form stable dispersions. The resulting PPy dispersions (10 μL) were then dropcast onto an 8 × 6-mm area of FTO glass substrate (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) framed in tape. Finally, the CEs were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h. To improve the electrical conductivity of the PPy layers, the PPy/FTO CEs were treated with HCl vapor. The electrodes were placed in a 500 mL round flask with an air inlet/outlet valve and exposed to a flow of nitrogen gas with HCl vapor supplied via a bubbler containing HCl aqueous solution (35 wt%) at room temperature for the desired time (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, or 10 min). For comparison, a conventional Pt CE was prepared according to a previous method.29
Fabrication of DSSCs
To prepare DSSCs, pre-cleaned FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with water and ethanol. A transparent nanocrystalline layer was prepared on the FTO glass plates using doctor blade printing using TiO2 paste and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were heated gradually under flowing air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. A paste containing 400-nm anatase particles was deposited using doctor blade printing to obtain the scattering layer and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were heated gradually under flowing air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting film was composed of a 10-μm-thick transparent layer and a 4-μm-thick scattering layer. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in N719 dye solution (0.3 mM in CH3CN) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and various PPy CEs were assembled in a sealed sandwich-type cell with a 25-μm gap of a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn, DuPont). Then, the electrolytes were introduced into the cell, which was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile (E1), 0.6 M 3-hexyl-1,2-dimethyl imidazolium iodide (HDMII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile (E2), 0.03 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), 0.6 M HDMII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile (E3), and 0.03 M GuSCN, 0.6 M HDMII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (1:1) (E4).
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer. The morphology of the synthesized PPy was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM6340) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2010). The surface resistivity of the PPy layers of the CEs was measured with a Keithley 2000 multimeter. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the PPy in methanol were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy (Unicam 8700 series). Cyclic voltammetry (CV, Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat) was measured in a three-electrode system with PPy/FTO and HCl-doped PPy/FTO working electrodes, Pt wire CE, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode dipped in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in the range ±1.0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were measured under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 using 450 W xenon arc lamp (Ushio, UXL-75XE), whose power of an AM 1.5 Oriel solar simulator was calibrated by using KG5 filtered Si reference solar cell (National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-certified Si diode, area = 3.937 cm2) to reduce the mismatch in the region 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM 1.5 to less than 2%. Before measurements were taken, to reduce scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the TiO2 layer, light shading masks were used on the DSSCs, so the average active area of DSSC was 0.18 cm2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 1000 nm using a model QEX7 system (PV Measurements, Inc.) equipped with 75 W xenon lamp, monochromator, and optical chopper. Light intensity was calibrated using a NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a standard.
Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the procedure used to synthesize the spherical PPy nanoparticles is presented in Fig. 1. First, MTAB and decyl alcohol molecules form a stable micelle in water (Fig. 1a). Decyl alcohol was used as co-surfactant to strengthen the hydrophobic interactions of the surfactant molecules. After pyrrole monomers are added, they penetrate the hydrophobic inner spaces of the micelles (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, pyrrole monomers are polymerized by chemical oxidative polymerization inside the individual micelle cores (Fig. 1c). Finally, spherical PPy nanoparticles are obtained by washing (Fig. 1d). This micelle polymerization technique can be applied to the mass production of PPy nanoparticles in a high yield. In addition, the particle size can be controlled by adjusting various parameters.

An FT-IR spectrum of the polymerized PPy is shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption bands at ∼1592 and 1486 cm−1 were assigned to the antisymmetric ring stretching and symmetric mode in the pyrrole rings, respectively.30 Absorption bands were also observed at ∼1368 and 1054 cm−1 (N–H and C–H deformation vibrations) and 1226 and 944 cm−1 (stretching vibrations in the doped PPy).30Fig. 2b and c show TEM images of PPy nanoparticles at different magnifications. The TEM images verify that the polypyrrole nanoparticles were spherical and had uniform diameters of ∼85 nm. Furthermore, they show that they were fabricated as individual discrete particles without aggregation, which is very useful for their stable dispersion. These spectral and morphological characteristics indicate that PPy was synthesized successfully via chemical oxidative polymerization within surfactant/co-surfactant micelles. The average electrical conductivity of a pressed pellet of PPy nanoparticles measured, using a four-probe method, was as high as 10.4 S cm−1.

The methanol-based PPy dispersions of 2.0 and 5.0 wt% were dropcast onto FTO glass substrates to investigate the effect of the PPy layer thickness on the DSSC performance. Fig. 3 shows SEM images of the surface and cross-section of the PPy layer on FTO. The inset in Fig. 3b shows the typical picture of PPy/FTO CE. The surface of the PPy layer is an obviously highly nanoporous structure of PPy particles that are held loosely together irrespective of the PPy concentration (Fig. 3a and c). The porous structure of the CE made of PPy nanoparticles increases the specific surface area, which might facilitate the electrocatalytic activity of the I3−/I− redox reaction in the electrolyte solution. The respective thicknesses of the PPy layers coated using 2.0 and 5.0 wt% PPy dispersions were ∼2 (Fig. 3b) and 10 μm (Fig. 3d) over the entire range. In addition, it is clear that the interfacial adhesion between the PPy layer and FTO glass was excellent in both samples. This may be due to the high surface energy of the discrete PPy nanoparticles.31

Because the electron transfer and reduction of the redox species have to be carried out efficiently on the CE, low surface resistivity of the CE is one of the most crucial factors for producing high-performance DSSCs. Like other conducting polymers, the electrical properties of as-prepared PPy can be enhanced by post-doping.32,33Fig. 4a shows the change in surface resistivity of the PPy CEs (10 μm) with the HCl vapor treatment time. The surface resistivity decreased sharply from 624 to 387 Ω sq−1 at 1 min. At longer HCl vapor treatment times, the surface resistivity increased to 589 Ω sq−1 at 5 min and then leveled off from 5 to 10 min, which might be due to over-oxidation. From this result, it is expected that experimentally optimized post-doping with HCl vapor for 1 min will facilitate charge transport among PPy nanoparticles on FTO glass substrates, reducing interparticle contact resistance.

The electronic states of the as-prepared PPy and PPy post-doped with HCl vapor for 1 min can be observed using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4b). These two UV-vis spectra show two distinct bands appearing below ∼480 nm and above ∼850 nm, respectively. The low-energy bands are due to electronic transitions between the valence band and bipolaron band, and the high-energy bands are due to π–π* transitions.34 Compared with as-prepared PPy (0 min), the absorbance increased and the peak positions for both transitions were red-shifted (378 → 458 nm and 960 → near infrared (IR) region) in the PPy post-doped with HCl vapor (1 min). The red shift in the peak positions, together with the increase in absorbance, indicates a decrease in the band gap.34 Therefore, these UV-vis data support the observation that the conjugation length in PPy increased with post-doping with HCl vapor for 1 min, decreasing the surface resistivity of the PPy CE.

Fig. 4c compares the cyclic voltammograms for the reduction of I2/I3− obtained at the CE prepared from as-prepared PPy and PPy post-doped with HCl vapor for 1 min. Two pairs of redox peaks in the same positions are clearly observed for both samples. The relatively negative peaks located at ∼0.05 V correspond to the reduction reaction in eqn (1), and the more positive peaks located at ∼0.55 V are assigned to the reduction reaction in eqn (2).35 I3− + 2e− = 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− = 2I3−(2)
Compared with the CE made of as-prepared PPy (0 min), the HCl-doped PPy electrode (1 min) had a much greater current density, implying a faster reaction rate and stronger catalytic activity for the redox reaction of I3− and I2 species. This may be due to the low surface resistivity of the PPy CE caused by the increased carrier density through post-doping with HCl vapor for 1 min. Based on the surface resistivity data, UV-vis spectra, and cyclic voltammograms, we expect that HCl-doped PPy CE (1 min) with superior catalytic activity will provide enhanced DSSC performance.
The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5. The IPCE spectrum of the optimized PPy (HCl treatment time, 1 min; PPy thickness, 10 μm; electrolyte, E3) CE and the Pt-based DSSCs exceeds 60% over a broad spectral range 390–620 nm, reaching its maximum of 75% at 532 nm. The IPCE tails off toward 800 nm, contributing to the broad spectral light harvesting. The IPCE spectrum of the optimized device is enhanced more in the red region compared with the other three devices, which is in good agreement with its UV-vis spectrum. From the overlap integral of this curve of the optimized device with the standard global AM 1.5 solar emission spectrum, a short-circuit photocurrent density of 14.8 mA cm−2 is calculated, which is in good agreement with the measured device photocurrent.

The J–V curves for DSSCs based on various CEs and electrolyte compositions are presented in Fig. 6. The derived photovoltaic parameters, such as the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and overall conversion efficiency (η), are summarized in Table 1. Although the η of the Pt cell reached to a maximum of ∼8.21%, the optimized PPy-based cell gave Jsc = 15.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 V, and ff = 0.64, corresponding to η = 7.73%. When the HCl treatment time for 10-μm PPy-layered CE using electrolyte E1 was increased from 0 to 1 min, Jsc increased from 11.0 to 14.5 mA cm−2, whereas Voc and ff remained essentially constant, so that η = 6.83%. The enhanced photovoltaic performance might be due to the greater catalytic activity and lower surface resistivity of the PPy layer with HCl vapor treatment compared with as-prepared PPy CE, as shown in Fig. 4. Increasing the HCl treatment time to 10 min reduced η to 5.39%, which concurred with the surface resistivity data (Fig. 4a). In addition, when the PPy layer thickness changed from 10 to 2 μm with a fixed HCl treatment time of 1 min and the same electrolyte (E1), Voc and Jsc dropped to 675 mV and 13.8 mA cm−2, respectively, whereas ff remained constant, affording a slightly lower η of 6.35%, which is attributable to the decreased PPy layer that acts as a catalyst for the I3−/I− redox couple. We also investigated the influence of the electrolyte composition on the photovoltaic performance. When we changed the electrolyte composition from E1 to E4 with a fixed HCl treatment time (1 min) and a PPy layer thickness of 10 μm, the optimized cell gave Jsc = 15.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 778 mV, and ff = 0.64, corresponding to η = 7.73% using the E3 electrolyte composition. The large Jsc enhancement and higher Voc of the optimized cell relative to one without any HCl treatment is related to red shifting with intense absorption and a minimized dark current. Considering these results, the DSSC performance using PPy-layered CEs is likely governed not only by the enhanced catalytic activity and lowered surface resistivity of the PPy layers following the HCl vapor treatment for 1 min but also by the optimized electrolyte composition. Further studies to understand the difference in cell performance with the different electrolyte compositions are currently underway.

Conclusions
Multigram-scale spherical PPy nanoparticles with uniform size (∼85 nm) were synthesized within micelles as nanoreactors. PPy-layered FTO glass as the CE for DSSCs was fabricated by dropcasting a PPy-dispersed colloidal solution. By controlling the thickness and HCl vapor treatment time of the PPy layer on the FTO substrate and adjusting the electrolyte composition, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC reached a maximum of ∼7.73%, which is the highest efficiency to date using only PPy as the CE. Although we obtained a reasonable DSSC performance compared with Pt electrode, in principle, it is possible to improve the performance of the PPy-based CEs using the same simple approach if the particle size is controlled and the electrical conductivity is increased. Moreover, the PPy-dispersed colloidal solution will enable PPy nanoparticles to be used as a convenient and efficient CE material for the mass production of DSSCs by virtue of the ease of preparation and low-cost.
