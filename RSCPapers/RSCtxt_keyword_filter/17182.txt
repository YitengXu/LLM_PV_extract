    , Accepted 24th March 2016First published on 24th March 2016AbstractThree heteroleptic ruthenium complexes, RC-15, RC-16 and RC-22, with sulfur- or oxygen-containing electron-donor, phenylpyridine-based ancillary ligands, are synthesized. The influence of the different electron donors—the acyclic electron donors methylthio and methoxyl, and the cyclic electron donor methylenedioxy—on the photophysical and electrochemical behavior in dye sensitizers and photovoltaic performance in DSSCs are investigated. Compared to the conventional dye N3, all the dyes demonstrate superior performance in the form of molar absorptivity, photocurrent density (JSC) and conversion efficiency (η). The DSSCs based on RC-15 and RC-16, with only a two-atom change in the acyclic electron donor, exhibit analogous photovoltaic performance (9.28% for RC-15 and 9.32% for RC-16). The highest photocurrent density (19.06 mA cm−2) and conversion efficiency (9.74%) are recorded for RC-22, which contains the cyclic electron donor. Transient absorption (TAS) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are carried out to investigate the sensitizers’ regeneration and the behavior of excited electron decay kinetics. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is operated to explain the charge recombination and the electron lifetime. These consequences reveal substantial dependences on the different configurations of the electron-donor ancillary ligands.
Introduction
An eco-friendly and low-cost alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained massive research interest in recent decades.1–4 The monolayer of dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 in DSSCs regulates the yield of harvested solar photons and separated charges, governing the photon-to-current conversion efficiency to a great extent.5–14 The zinc porphyrin dye SM315 possesses the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of 13%;15 however, the low yield and highly toxic chemicals of its synthesis pose a painful obstacle to the wide use of this series of dyes.16–22 Over the past 20 years, ruthenium complexes Ru(NCS)2L2 (L = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, called N3 dye) maintained a clear lead in high-performance dyes due to their broad absorption spectrum,23,24 appropriate energy levels,25–28 long excited-state lifetime,29,30 and excellent stability.31 One of the basic strategies underlying the molecular design of efficient sensitizers has been the modification of N3 dye.32–36 Alternative approaches are based on tuning the light absorption to lower energies by introducing a ligand with a low-lying π* molecular orbital and/or by destabilization of the Ru t2g orbital with an ancillary electron-donor ligand.37–42
Here we present three different ruthenium complexes, RC-15, RC-16 and RC-22 (Scheme 1), containing phenylpyridine and an ancillary electron-donor unit. Significant π-conjugation of the phenyl rings should certainly enlarge both the absorption range and the charge transfer cross-section of relevant Ru(II) complexes.29 Furthermore, the ancillary electron donor can provide indirect electronic perturbations for fine-tuning the HOMO/LUMO levels, thus, bringing better electron transfer to the anchor unit, resulting in a noteworthy enhancement of the DSSCs' photovoltaic conversion efficiency.42,43 The effects of different configurations of electron-donor ancillary ligands in these Ru complex dyes on the photophysical and electrochemical properties and on the photovoltaic performance are studied.

Experimental
Materials and equipment
The starting materials 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine, (4-methylthiophenyl)boronic acid, (4-methoxyphenyl)boronic acid and (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)boronic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI and used as received. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were puriss grade and used without further purification unless otherwise noted.

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Advance 400 spectrometer. Mass spectra (MS) were recorded with an LTQ Orbitrap XL Mass Spectrometer. The UV-vis spectra of the three dyes and the sensitized TiO2 films were performed on a U-spectrophotometer 3900H (Hitachi, Japan). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on a CHI-660d electrochemical analyzer in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt disk working electrode, an SCE reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. Measurements of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) used an Autolab PGSTAT 302N analyzer (Metrohm, Switzerland) in the frequency region from 50 mHz to 1000 kHz. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured on a QE/IPCE measurement kit (Newport, USA). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were obtained using a 3A grade solar simulator (Newport, USA, 94043A) under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. Transient absorption spectra were carried out using a laser flash spectrophotometer (LP920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd Scotland) in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable laser (OPOLette 355II, Opotek, Inc., CA). The probe light from a pulsed xenon arc lamp was passed through various optical elements and a monochromator before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a digital signal analyzer (TDS 3012C, Tektronix, USA). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was carried out on a fluorescence detector (QM400 and LaserStrobe, Photo Technology International, USA).
Synthesis
The synthetic pathway of these three dyes is shown in Scheme 1. The ligands were synthesized through the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with satisfactory yield. All ruthenium sensitizers were prepared in a three-step, one-pot reaction and purified by Sephadex LH-20 column for high product purity. All the structures were confirmed by NMR and MS. The detailed synthetic route and characterization data are illustrated in the ESI.†
Device fabrication
A screen-printed, double-layered film of TiO2 particles was employed as the mesoporous negative electrode. The colloidal TiO2 nanoparticle fabrication process was carried out according to our previous paper.44,45 A 20 nm-sized TiO2 particle film with a thickness of 4 μm was primarily printed on the fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass electrode (12–14 Ω per square, TEC 15, USA) and then coated by a 10 μm-thick layer of 400 nm-sized light-scattering anatase particles. The thickness of the TiO2 thin film electrode was measured by a profilometer (XP-2, AMBIOS Technology Inc., USA). The TiO2 films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. After cooling down, the TiO2 thin film electrodes were immersed in an acetonitrile/tert-butanol (50:50, v/v) mixed solvent containing 300 μM dye sensitizers and 20 mM chenodeoxycholic acid for 12 h, then rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and dried by air flow. To prepare the counter electrode, Pt catalyst was deposited on FTO glass by spraying H2PtCl6 solution and treating at 450 °C for 20 min. The two electrodes were separated by a 45 μm thermal adhesive film (Surlyn, USA) and sealed by heating. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode glass substrate, made with a sand blasting drill, was sealed with a thin glass cover by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte by using a pipette. The organic electrolyte solution was a mixture of 1 M 1,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide (DMII), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS). The area of the TiO2 film electrodes was 0.25 cm2.
Results and discussion
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of the three complexes (RC-15, RC-16 and RC-22) were measured in DMF solvent and compared with that of the N3 absorption spectrum (Fig. 1a). The optical data are summarized in Table 1. The general absorption spectra of N3-related dyes consist of three bands caused by ligand–ligand charge transfer transitions (LLCT) and/or metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCT). The characteristic MLCT of RC dyes, which dominates the performance of the dye, peaks at about 530 nm (slightly red-shifted compared to that of the reference N3). The bathochromic shift of the MLCT band suggests that the band gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for RC dyes becomes smaller than that of N3. The higher molar extinction coefficients of the MLCT are 15800 M−1 cm−1 (RC-15), 15100 M−1 cm−1 (RC-16) and 18600 M−1 cm−1 (RC-22). It should be noted that reinforcement by electron-donor ancillary ligands results in increased electronic transition dipole momentum and, therefore, absorption coefficient of the MLCT band.38 Owing to the cyclic nature of its electron-donor ancillary ligand, RC-22 shows the highest absorption intensity compared to RC-15 and RC-16 (acyclic), and therefore, it is likely to exhibit the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), which is confirmed from the JSC measurements in subsequent sections. Considering the same surface area being occupied by dyes with various light harvesting efficiencies, those with high molar extinction coefficients allow an enhanced light-harvesting yield and, ultimately, a noteworthy reduction in subsequent film thickness. The absorption spectra of RC dyes adsorbed on TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 1b. When the RC dye molecules are adsorbed on TiO2 film, the absorption bands are broadened and more red-shifted compared with those in DMF solution, indicating interactions between the dye sensitizers and the TiO2 surface.

To obtain and analyze the molecular orbital energy levels, the electrochemical properties of these RC dyes were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a Fc/Fc+ couple as external reference (+0.63 V); the tested cyclic voltammograms for the oxidation potential  of the RC dyes are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms for the RC dyes in DMF solution of TBAPF6. 
The ground-oxidation potentials (, corresponding to the HOMO level of dyes) of the RC dyes sensitizers in DMF solution (5 × 10−4 M) are calculated according to eqn (a): (a) The experimental potential values for RC-15, RC-16 and RC-22 are 0.93, 0.93 and 0.91 V (versus normal hydrogen electrode [NHE]), which are assigned to the Ru(II)/Ru(III) couple. Note that all the oxidation potentials of RC dyes are more positive than those of the I−/I3− redox couples (0.4 V vs. NHE).2 Therefore, the driving forces are sufficient for the regeneration of the three dyes. Based on the absorption thresholds from the absorption spectra of dyes (λ), the excitation transition energies (E0–0) of the RC dyes are gained according to eqn (b): E0–0 = hν/λ(b) Excited-state oxidation potential  is calculated according to the equation: (c)
As a result, their excited-state oxidation potentials  are calculated to be −1.16, −1.19 and −1.17 V (vs. NHE). The excited-state potentials of the three dyes obtained in DMF are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),2 providing sufficient driving force for electron injection. The energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 3. The difference in the oxidation potential between RC dyes and N3 is attributed to the electron-donor ancillary ligands. The band gaps of the RC dyes are smaller than those of N3, resulting in increased intensity of the MLCT band. In consideration of the negative free energy of electron injection, RC dyes may achieve satisfactory JSC. However, RC dyes show inferior negative free energy for dye regeneration, resulting in distressing Voc compared to N3. These results are verified in this paper (see below).

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
Preliminary photovoltaic experiments were employed to evaluate the performance of the three new dyes and the benchmarked dye N3. The IPCE value corresponds to the photocurrent density produced in the external circuit under monochromatic illumination of the cell divided by the photon flux that strikes the cell.2
The IPCE spectra for the cells sensitized with the RC dyes and N3 are illustrated in Fig. 4. Due to the strong photon-harvesting capability of electron-donor ancillary ligands, sensitization over the entire visible spectrum is obtained. All the RC dyes outperform the standard N3 in IPCE. RC-22 demonstrates the most efficient sensitization of TiO2 thin film over the spectral range, with an external quantum efficiency of about 90% in the plateau region.
 Fig. 4  The incident photon-to-current efficiency conversion spectra for DSSCs sensitized with the four dyes. 
Moreover, dye loading amounts were obtained by desorbing the dye on the sensitized TiO2 films by a methanol solution containing TBAOH and then measuring the absorption spectra. The dye loading amounts of RC dyes and N3 on TiO2 are 1.83 × 10−7, 1.85 × 10−7, 1.61 × 10−7 and 2.15 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, although all RC sensitizers show lower loading amounts on TiO2, they have higher extinction coefficients than N3 (see Fig. 1). Therefore, RC sensitizers can harvest much more light compared to N3. This is one of the main contributors to their higher photocurrent values.
The current density–voltage curves for the solar cells based on RC dyes are compared with that of the N3 dye, as shown in Fig. 6. Compared to N3, the superior quantum efficiency of RC dyes translates into higher photocurrent density and better conversion efficiency. The detailed values for the photovoltaic parameters of all devices measured under 1 sun irradiation are summarized in Table 2.

As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, RC-15 and RC-16 exhibit better overall conversion efficiency (9.28% for RC-15 and 9.32% for RC-16) compared to that of N3 (9.27%). This improvement can be attributed to the introduction of the electron donor methylthio and methoxyl. Furthermore, inconspicuous difference has been found when there is an exchange of an oxygen with a sulfur atom in two equivalent positions. With the cyclic nature of its electron-donor ancillary ligand, RC-22 exhibits the best performance in terms of its short-circuit current density of 19.06 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.725 V, and fill factor of 0.706, leading to a PCE value of 9.74% (Table 2). Hence, this class of electron donor cyclic units can be considered an attractive class of molecular fragments for high-efficiency sensitizers.

Transient absorption measurements
The recombination kinetics of the excited-state dye molecules with injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the dye cation interception by iodide in the electrolyte were investigated using a nanosecond time-resolved laser flash spectrophotometer. In Fig. 6a, a broad negative peak is observed in the visible region between 400 and 650 nm, which can be assigned to the bleaching of ground-state dye molecules.7 Moreover, the broad positive peak between 650 and 900 nm can be allocated to the electronic excitation of dye cation. So, the excitation wavelength of 500 nm and probe wavelength of 750 nm are chosen to study the decay trace of dye cations. As shown in Fig. 6b–d, traces 1–3 reflect the dynamics of the recombination of conduction band electrons by the dye cation in pure acetonitrile (ACN). This decay trace can be fitted with the single exponential decay according to the equation: OD(Δt) = A0 + A1 e−Δt/τ(d)
 Fig. 6  (a) The transient absorption change of dyed TiO2 film in ACN; (b, c, and d) the transient absorbance decay kinetics for TiO2 films grafted with RC-15 (b), RC-16 (c), and RC-22 (d), which are immersed in pure ACN (1, 2, 3) or the electrolyte with redox species (4, 5, 6). 
When the electrolyte with redox species (I−/I3−) was added to the acetonitrile, the dye cation was regenerated by the injected conduction band electrons or by the iodide in the electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 6b–d, the absorbance decays 4, 5 and 6 are accelerated due to the RC dye cation being regenerated by both iodine in the electrolytes and the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. According to the equation above, the fitted lifetime (τ) and the yield of interception by iodide in electrolyte of traces 1–6 are listed in Table 3. The fitted lifetime, which implies that the charge separation at the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface and the RC dyes can be regenerated rapidly, can explain the high photocurrent output of the RC dyes. Furthermore, the dye regeneration process of the RC-22 dye with the methylenedioxy electron-donor unit is faster than those of RC-15 and RC-16, which indicates a certain relationship between the electron-donor ancillary ligands and the dye regeneration rate.

Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements
Time-correlated photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to investigate the emission decay behavior of the dyes in solution or device form. Fig. 7 shows the lowest excited-state decay behavior of the dyes in DMF solution. The solution was excited using a pulse laser (460 nm) and monitored at 750 nm. Durrant and co-workers have proposed that the faster the decay rate of the lowest excited state lifetime, the higher the photocurrent density, owing to more efficient electron injection caused by decreased kinetic redundancy of the excited electrons.46 Because electron injection from excited dye to TiO2 conduction band happens in a femtosecond–picosecond time range, the shorter lifetime of the dye molecule (picosecond time range) is ideal to bring about a decrease in kinetic redundancy.47 According to Fig. 7, the decay rate is in the following order: RC-22 > RC-15 > RC-16. This order is in good agreement with the photocurrent density. Hence, we come to the conclusion that the RC-22 dye with the methylenedioxy electron-donor unit is better than the other two electron-donor units.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under a bias voltage of −0.70 V to characterize the charge transfer resistances of cells in the dark. Fig. 8 displays the EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on the RC dyes and N3. In general, the EIS spectra of DSSCs based on these dyes show two main semicircles in the Nyquist plots. In Fig. 8, the first semicircle, which stands for the charge transfer resistances at the Pt/electrolyte interface RPt, was almost the same in the cells due to the consistent electrolyte and Pt electrode.46 The charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct), corresponding to the second semicircle, is in the order of N3 (28.4 Ω) > RC-22 (21.7 Ω) > RC-16 (18.5 Ω) > RC-15 (14.2 Ω), indicating that the recombination rate is subdued in the order of N3 > RC-22 > RC-16 > RC-15 in the dark. The electron lifetime (τn) can be estimated by eqn (e): τn = Rct × Cμ(e)Cμ is chemical capacitance, and the respective τn values for the DSSCs based on RC-15, RC-16, RC-22 and N3 dyes are 22.8, 25.1, 29.2 and 35.6 ms, respectively. It is clear that the lifetime and Rct order are consistent with the VOC values. For the RC dyes, the longest electron lifetime (τn) is observed with the RC-22-based DSSC, which may be attributed to the better geometry orientation and a more compact layer of the anchored dye on the TiO2 film.32 These results suggest that cyclic electron-donor ligands can suppress the back reaction in the electrolyte effectively, yielding enhanced charge lifetime, open-circuit voltage and cell efficiency.

Conclusions
We synthesized three heteroleptic ruthenium complex sensitizers and investigated their photophysical and electrochemical behavior and their photovoltaic performance in an attempt to explore the structure–activity relationships associated with the dyes. The results show that incorporation of an electron-donor ancillary ligand prominently improves the molar absorptivity of ruthenium(II) complexes and the performance of the sensitized devices. Compared with N3, all the RC dyes possess relatively higher molar extinction coefficients as well as satisfactory negative free energy of the excited state. Eventually, the dye-based DSSCs exhibited much higher photocurrent densities (18.50 mA cm−2 for RC-15, 18.31 mA cm−2 for RC-16 and 19.06 mA cm−2 for RC-22) and conversion efficiencies (9.28% for RC-15, 9.32% for RC-16 and 9.74% for RC-22) than N3 (17.45 mA cm−2, 9.27%). Among them, RC-22, which contains the cyclic electron donor methylenedioxy, shows a stronger overlap and conjugation between the lone-pair electrons of the two oxygen atoms and the π orbital of the phenylpyridine system,32 obtaining the highest molar extinction coefficient, optimized regeneration (recombination) kinetics and ultimately the best photovoltaic performance. This work not only provides a new vision on how electron-donor ancillary ligands affect the performance but also exploits an efficient methodology based on fine electronic tuning of dyes to achieve further enhancement of ruthenium complex dyes.
