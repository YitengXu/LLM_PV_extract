    , Accepted 31st July 2014First published on 5th August 2014AbstractIn recent years, organometal halide perovskite-based solid-state hybrid solar cells have attracted unexpected increasing interest because of their high efficiency (the record power conversion efficiency has been reported to be over 15%) and low fabrication cost. It has been accepted that the high efficiency was mainly attributed to the strong optical absorption (absorption coefficient: 15000 cm−1 at 550 nm) over a broader range (up to 800 nm) and the long lifetimes of photoexcited charge carriers (in the order of 10 ns – a few 100 ns) of the perovskite absorbers. However, much of the fundamental photophysical properties of perovskite relating to the high photovoltaic performance are remained to be investigated. The charge separation and recombination processes at the material interfaces are particularly important for solar cell performances. To better understand the high efficiency of perovskite solar cells, we systematically investigated the charge separation (electron and hole injection) and charge recombination dynamics of CH3NH3PbClI2 hybrid solar cells employing TiO2 nanostructures as the electron transfer material (ETM) and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transfer material (HTM). The measurements were carried out using transient absorption (TA) techniques on a time scale from sub-picoseconds to milliseconds. We clarified the timescales of electron injection, hole injection, and recombination processes in TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD solar cells. Charge separation and collection efficiency of the perovskite-based solar cells were discussed. In addition, the effect of TiO2 size on the charge separation and recombination dynamics was also investigated. It was found that all TiO2-based perovskite solar cells possessed similar charge separation processes, but quite different recombination dynamics. Our results indicate that charge recombination was crucial to the performance of the perovskite solar cells, which could be effectively suppressed through optimising nanostructured TiO2 films and surface passivation, thus pushing these cells to even higher efficiency.
Introduction
Over the past two years, a new type of organic–inorganic hybrid solid-state solar cell based on organometal trihalide perovskite has attracted unexpected increasing attention.1–9 The organometal trihalide perovskites in the form of CH3NH3PbClxI3−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) can be simply crystallized from solution at low temperature (≤100 °C), which enables them as promising light absorbing materials in various solar cells. In 2009, Miyasaka and co-workers reported the first lead halide perovskite sensitized solar cells with an energy conversion efficiency of about 3.8%. However, these cells were unstable due to the iodide/triiodide redox liquid electrolyte.10 Therefore, Nam-Gyu Park and co-workers improved the cells by further optimization of the titania surface and perovskite processing in 2011, which pushed the energy conversion efficiency up to 6.54%.11 Since then, the perovskite-based solid-state solar cells have been reported with an unexpected rapid improvement in the energy conversion efficiency from 8% to 15.4%, as reported by the pioneering researchers of Snaith, Miyasaka, Nam-Gyu Park, and Gratzel groups.1–9 To date, two kinds of architectures for the heterojunction perovskite hybrid solar cells have been proposed. One is the same as the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs), which employs mesoporous metal oxides as the electron transport material (ETM), perovskite as the light absorber, and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material (HTM).1,2,5 Another architecture is a much simpler planar heterojunction (i.e., a p–i–n) solar cell12 without the use of a mesoporous metal oxide layer. Both of them have shown a high energy conversion efficiency of over 15%, which confirms the superiority of perovskite over other light absorbing materials. Therefore, the perovskite-based solid-state solar cells are expected to be a new type of low-cost high efficiency next generation solar cells. However, the detailed mechanisms, especially the charge transfer and recombination at the interfaces within these high performance solar cells, are unclear. Nam-Gyu Park has predicted that the heterojunction perovskite solar cell could achieve an efficiency as high as 20% in the near future.4 Snaith predicts that the energy conversion efficiency of the perovskite-based solid-state solar cells is likely to be pushed toward that of CIGS (20%) and then toward and beyond that of crystalline silicon (25%) by using three key strategies: optimizing the solar cell architecture; employing a narrower band-gap perovskite; and adopting a multijunction approach.13 To achieve these exciting goals, it is critical to gain the basic understanding of the photophysical properties, including photoexcited charge carrier dynamics, charge separation, charge recombination and charge transport in the perovskite-based hybrid solid-state solar cells. Very recently, Stranks14 and Xing15 reported that the effective diffusion lengths of charge carriers were relatively large in CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbClI2, with the value about 100 nm and 1 μm, respectively. The relatively large charge carrier diffusion lengths arise from the higher mobility and larger charge carrier lifetimes in these materials. Therefore, light-generated electrons and holes can move ultra-long distances in the perovskite, resulting in the generation of photocurrent, instead of losing their energy as heat within solar cells. On the other hand, the charge separation and recombination dynamics at the ETM/perovskite/HTM interfaces are also significant for understanding the mechanism behind photovoltaic performances, and shedding light on the ways to even higher efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
Herein, to investigate the mechanism of high efficiency perovskite-based hybrid solid-state solar cells and therefore find similar materials for the next generation solar cells, we fabricated CH3NH3PbClI2 perovskite hybrid solid-state solar cells employing mesoporous metal oxide films as the ETM and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The charge separation and recombination dynamics in these cells were systematically investigated by using femtosecond and nanosecond TA techniques on a time scale of sub-picoseconds to milliseconds. To verify whether there is charge transfer from perovskite to TiO2 and from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD, and investigate the corresponding charge transfer kinetics at these interfaces, CH3NH3PbClI2 was deposited on two types of mesoporous metal oxide films with different band gap energies (Eg). One is the commonly used titania (TiO2) with the band gap of 3.2 eV. Another mesoporous film is yttrium oxide (Y2O3), which possesses a relatively wide band gap of 6.0 eV. The effect of hole transport material (spiro-OMeTAD) was also investigated by fabricating two types of samples, i.e. with or without spiro-OMeTAD. It was observed that electrons were effectively injected from perovskite into the conduction band of TiO2, but this process was not observed in the case of Y2O3. This is because the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbClI2 is higher than that of TiO2 but much lower than that of Y2O3 (Fig. 1). By choosing the probe light wavelength from the visible region to the NIR region in TA measurements, the relaxation dynamics of electrons in CH3NH3PbClI2 and/or those injected into TiO2, and the relaxation dynamics of holes in spiro-OMeTAD were detected. Photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes in CH3NH3PbClI2, time scales of charge separation and charge recombination at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces were clarified. Finally, to search for the possible factors influencing the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells, we compared the photoexcited charge carrier dynamics between two kinds of TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD solar cells employing TiO2 nanocrystals of different sizes (18 nm TiO2 for cell A, 30 nm TiO2 for cell B). Cell B showed a much higher energy conversion efficiency (∼9%) compared to that of cell A (∼6%). The difference in the efficiency was suggested to be due to the great difference in the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and thus the resultant short circuit current density (Jsc). Charge separation and charge collection efficiencies were quantitatively discussed for these solar cells. It was revealed that the differences in IPCE and Jsc were mainly attributed to the greatly different charge recombination time, which was about one order slower in cell B compared to that in cell A.

Experimental
Sample preparation
The samples of perovskite hybrid solar cells were fabricated by the following processes and materials. F-doped SnO2 layered glass (FTO glass, Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd) was patterned by using Zn powder and 6 N HCl aqueous solution. On this patterned FTO glass, titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol was sprayed at 300 °C to prepare compact TiO2 layers. The porous TiO2 layer was fabricated by spin-coating a TiO2 paste of different nanoparticle sizes (18 nm: PST-18NR or 30 nm: PST-30NRD, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.) in ethanol (TiO2 paste:ethanol = 1:2.5 weight ratio for PST-18NR or TiO2 paste:ethanol = 2:7 weight ratio for PST-30NRD), followed by heating the substrate at 550 °C for 30 min. For some TA measurements, glasses, instead of FTO, were used as the substrate and a porous Y2O3 was fabricated on the glass substrates. Then, CH3NH3I and PbCl2 were mixed with a 3:1 molar ratio to prepare a 40% solution of perovskite in N,N-dimethylformamide and the mixture was spin-coated on the TiO2 and Y2O3 porous substrates. The substrates were heated at 100 °C for 45 minutes, followed by spin-coating a mixture of 55 mM of tert-butylpyridine, 9 mM of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt, and 68 mM of spiro-OMeTAD. Finally, Ag and Au electrodes were fabricated by a vacuum deposition method for photovoltaic measurements. Photovoltaic performance was evaluated by using an AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 irradiance solar simulator (CEP-2000, Bunkoukeiki Inc) with a 0.4 × 0.4 cm mask.
Transient absorption measurements
We have used two kinds of TA setups to characterize the charge separation (electron injection and hole injection) (a fs TA technique: fs-TA)16,17 and charge recombination dynamics (a ns TA technique: ns-TA)18–21 in the samples. In the fs-TA setup for characterization of charge separation,16,17 the laser source was a titanium/sapphire laser (CPA-2010, Clark-MXR Inc.) with a wavelength of 775 nm, a repetition rate of 1 kHz, and a pulse width of 150 fs. The light was separated into two parts. One part was used as a probe pulse. The other part was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) (a TOAPS from Quantronix) to generate light pulses with a wavelength tunable from 290 nm to 3 μm. It was used as a pump light to excite the sample. In this study, a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe beam wavelength of 775 nm were used. According to the experimental results reported by Deschler and co-workers very recently,22 the TA response of ground state bleaching (GSB) for CH3NH3PbClI2 on glass peaked at 1.65 eV that was spectrally unchanged out to times beyond 200 ns. So the probe light wavelength of 775 nm (i.e., the photon energy of 1. 64 eV) used in this study is appropriate to monitor the GSB of CH3NH3PbClI2 on Y2O3 and TiO2 substrates with or without spiro-OMeTAD, and thus electron transfer and hole transfer processes at each interfaces can be investigated systematically.
In the ns-TA setup for characterization of charge recombination,18–21 the pump light source was an OPO (Surelite II – 10FP) output excited by a Nd:YAG nanosecond pulse laser (Panther, Continuum, Electro-Optics Inc.). The pulse width was 5 ns, and the repetition rate was 0.5 Hz. We used a pulse light with a wavelength of 470 nm as a pump light to excite the sample. The probe light was a fiber coupled CW semiconductor. Three kinds of probe wavelengths of 785 nm, 658 nm and 1310 nm were used. The probe beam of 785 nm was used to measure the TA responses of GSB for CH3NH3PbClI2 on Y2O3, i.e. the recombination of electrons and holes in CH3NH3PbClI2.22 The probe beam of 658 nm was used to measure the trapped electrons in TiO2 (ref. 23) according to the reports of Yoshihara and co-workers, which was used to investigate charge recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and holes in the perovskite. The probe beam of 1310 nm was used to monitor the holes in spiro-OMeTAD24 and thus measure the charge recombination between holes in spiro-OMeTAD and the electrons in TiO2 and/or in perovskite. For all measurements, the pump and probe lights were irradiated from the glass and the TA measurements were carried out in a N2 atmosphere.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the room temperature optical absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbClI2 film on Y2O3 porous substrates. Similar spectra were also observed for those deposited on TiO2 porous substrates. As shown in Fig. 2, no sharp peaks related to exciton absorption were observed in the optical absorption spectrum at room temperature. This means that photoexcited electron–hole pairs exist as free charge carriers or very weak bound excitons rather than strong binding excitons. This can be understood by the fact that the exciton binding energy is relatively small in the three dimensional perovskite (e.g., 37 –50 meV was reported for CH3NH3PbI3), which is comparable to the thermal energy at room temperature25

To systematically investigate the charge separation and recombination dynamics in CH3NH3PbClI2-based solar cells, TA measurements were conducted for CH3NH3PbClI2 on either Y2O3 or TiO2 films, with and without spiro-OMeTAD. In the case of CH3NH3PbClI2 deposited on Y2O3, the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers in CH3NH3PbClI2 and charge separation dynamics at the CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD interface were investigated by the fs-TA measurements. The pump light wavelength was 470 nm to only excite CH3NH3PbClI2, and the probe light wavelength was 775 nm which was just the optical absorption edge as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3(a) shows the normalized TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 for a time scale up to 3 ns for different pump light intensities, i.e. 0.9 and 1.8 μJ cm−2. A bleaching signal with a very slow decay was observed for both intensities. Since there is no electron injection from the perovskite to Y2O3 owing to the large band gap of Y2O3 (Fig. 1), the slow decay could be attributed to the slow recombination process of photoexcited charge carriers in CH3NH3PbClI2. We confirmed that the peak intensity was proportional to the pump light intensity, but the decay time was independent of the pump light intensity as shown in Fig. 3(a). We found that there were two processes in the TA decay process and the TA signal could be well-fitted to the following biexponential function: Y = A1e−t/t1 + A2e−t/t2(1)where t1 and t2 are the time constants, A1 and A2 are the contributions from the corresponding components. It was calculated that the time constants t1 and t2 of the two charge recombination processes are 34 ps (A1/(A1 + A2): 9%) and much larger than 10 ns (A2/(A1 + A2): 91%), respectively. The faster decay process (34 ps) could be considered to be nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes through defects or trap states in CH3NH3PbClI2 or at CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 interfaces. This is consistent with the observations reported by Deschler and co-workers very recently that the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) was lower at lower pump intensity (<25 mW cm−2) but increased rapidly above 50% for higher pump intensity (by 100 mW cm−2) and reached a maximum value of 70% for CH3NH3PbClI2 on glass. Their results and our results indicated the possibility of nonradiative recombination due to effects at lower pump light excitation. However, as shown in Fig. 3, the relative contribution of the faster decay is as small as less than 10%, which suggested that the defect or trap state density in CH3NH3PbClI2 or at the interfaces is very small, which was consistent with the previous results obtained by a thermally stimulated current measurement.26 The slower decay process (≫3 ns) could be attributed to the recombination of free electrons and holes in CH3NH3PbClI2. This result suggested that the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers was quite long, which was confirmed to be as long as μs by the following ns-TA measurement results.

Fig. 4 shows the normalized TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 samples with and without spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. By fitting the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 with spiro-OMeTAD to eqn (1), we found that only one exponential decay with a time constant of 16 ± 2 ns appeared. Compared with the long lifetime (as long as microseconds as shown below) of the TA decay in Y2O3/CH3NH3PbClI2, the fast decay process in the Y2O3/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD could be considered to originate from the photoexcited hole injection from CH3NH3PbClI2 to spiro-OMeTAD. This result indicated that charge separation occurred at the interfaces between CH3NH3PbClI2 and spiro-OMeTAD. In fact, we also tried to measure the TA signal of holes in spiro-OMeTAD using the pump wavelength of 470 nm and probe beam wavelength of 1310 nm using the fs-TA, since the holes in spiro-OMeTAD could show a TA signal in the NIR region.24 However, we could not observe any TA signal for the 1310 nm probe for the time scale up to 3 ns. This is possibly due to the longer hole transfer time of 16 ns. On the other hand, as shown below (Fig. 6), the TA signal of holes in spiro-OMeTAD with a 1310 nm probe was observed very clearly on the time scale of μs. This result also supported the longer hole injection time of 16 ns in this case.

Following the fs-TA measurements, the ns-TA setup was applied to measure the TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 (with and without spiro-OMeTAD) samples to further study the charge carrier lifetimes and charge recombination between electrons in CH3NH3PbClI2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 5 shows the TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 without spiro-OMeTAD for a time scale of 200 μs measured with a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe light wavelength of 785 nm. Similar to the fs TA results shown in Fig. 3, a large bleaching signal was observed and recovered to zero at around 100 μs. This is considered to be the recombination of electrons and holes in CH3NH3PbClI2, because there is no electron injection to Y2O3 just as mentioned above. By fitting the TA decay with eqn (1), we found that two decay processes existed with lifetimes of 3.7 ± 0.1 μs (70%) and 60 ± 1 μs (30%), respectively. Combining the fs-TA and ns-TA results for CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3, the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers in CH3NH3PbClI2 can be mainly considered to be as long as μs.

Fig. 6 shows TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM measured at a probe wavelength of 1310 nm. This result indicates that charge separation truly occurred at the CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces, which is well consistent with the fs-TA results as shown in Fig. 4. The decrease of the TA signal of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 with spiro-OMeTAD originated from the recombination between the electrons in CH3NH3PbClI2 and the holes in spiro-OMeTAD, which could be fitted very well with eqn (1) and only one exponential decay was observed. The time constant of the decay was determined to be 0.37 ± 0.07 μs, which corresponded to the recombination time.

Based on the above results, the photoexcited charge carrier (electrons and holes) dynamics in CH3NH3PbClI2 deposited on Y2O3 substrates without and with spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM were clarified, which are illustrated in Fig. 7.

Subsequently, we studied the photoexcited electron injection and recombination dynamics using both the fs-TA and ns-TA measurements for CH3NH3PbClI2 deposited on TiO2 substrates. Fig. 8(a) shows the normalized TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 for 400 ps with the pump light intensities ranging from 0.5 μJ cm−2 to 12.5 μJ cm−2. Similar to CH3NH3PbClI2 deposited on Y2O3, when the pump light intensity was lower, the decays in the normalized TA responses overlapped with each other very well. However, when the pump light intensity was larger than 3.75 μJ cm−2, a faster decay process appeared in the TA response, which maybe resulted from interactions of multiple charge carriers (e.g., Auger recombination). To determine the electron injection dynamics from CH3NH3PbClI2 to TiO2, the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 under a lower pump light intensity (i.e., the decay was independent of pump light intensity) was used to compare with that of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 decayed much faster than that of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 and can be fitted very well to a one exponential decay function with a time constant of 1.8 ± 0.1 ns, which is about 2–3 orders smaller than the photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes (∼μs) as shown in Fig. 7. It is worth noting that the fast decay component with a lifetime of 34 ps that appeared in the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 is not observed in that of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2. So the electron injection time tET and electron injection rate kET can be calculated to be about 1.8 ns and 5.5 × 108 s−1 by the following equation: kET = 1/tET = 1/tPero/TiO2 − 1/tPero/Y2O3(2)where tPero/TiO2 and tPero/Y2O3 are the TA signal decay times of the perovskite on TiO2 and Y2O3 substrates, respectively. Then, the electron injection efficiency ηEinj can be calculated to be about 100% for all electrons with lifetimes longer than 100 ns. Here we suppose that the other 9% charge carriers that recombined with a lifetime of 34 ps did not exist in the CH3NH3PbClI2 prepared on TiO2, because we did not observe any faster decay component in the TA responses of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2.

For comparison, the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 is also shown in (b). The pump light wavelength is 470 nm and the probe light wavelength is 775 nm. 
Next, we detected the recombination dynamics in CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 without spiro-OMeTAD, i.e., the recombination between electrons in TiO2 and holes in CH3NH3PbClI2, using the ns-TA. Fig. 9 shows the TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 measured with a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe light wavelength of 658 nm. Yoshihara and co-workers have clearly demonstrated that the TA signal in nanocrystalline TiO2 films observed at 500–1000 nm mostly resulted from trapped electrons in TiO2.23 In addition, in the previous studies,18–21 it was shown that electrons injected into TiO2 from DSC and QDSCs could be detected by the TA signal probed at 658 nm on the timescale of microseconds. We also measured TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/Y2O3 under the same condition and observed a bleach signal as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the TA response in CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 observed at 658 nm corresponded to the electrons in TiO2 injected from CH3NH3PbClI2. As shown in Fig. 9, the TA decay can be fitted very well with a one exponential function with a time constant of 0.14 ± 0.02 μs. This result indicates that the recombination between electrons in TiO2 and holes in perovskite occurred with a time trec1 of 0.14 μs.

Then, we detected the recombination dynamics in CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 with spiro-OMeTAD, i.e., the recombination between electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD using the ns-TA. Fig. 10 shows TA response of CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2 without (a) and with (b) spiro-OMeTAD measured with a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe light wavelength of 1310 nm, which monitors the relaxation dynamics of holes in spiro-OMeTAD. For the sample without spiro-OMeTAD, no TA signal can be observed. However, for the sample with spiro-OMeTAD, an absorption signal can be observed very clearly, which can be fitted very well with a one exponential decay function with a time constant of 60 ± 0.5 μs.

The photoexcited charge carrier relaxation and transfer dynamics of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD evaluated above are illustrated in Fig. 11(a). This is the typical result of the cell A with a TiO2 nanoparticle size of 18 nm. The important thing is to understand how the carrier dynamics relate to the photovoltaic properties. We measured several cells and the energy conversion efficiency was typically 5–7%. Fig. 12(a) and (b) show typical results of the IPCE spectrum and the current voltage (I–V) curve of the cell A. The short circuit current Jsc, open circuit voltage Voc, fill factor FF and energy conversion efficiency η of cell A are 11.81 mA cm−2, 0.79 V, 0.71 and 6.59%, respectively. The IPCE value at 470 nm (the pump light wavelength used in the TA measurements) is 58%.

To investigate the effect of TiO2 particle size on the photovoltaic performance and carrier dynamics in the TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD solar cells, we measured cell B with a TiO2 nanoparticle size of 30 nm. The energy conversion efficiency was typically 8–10%. Fig. 12(a) and (b) also show typical results of the IPCE spectrum and the current voltage (I–V) curve of the cell B, where Jsc, Voc, FF and η are 17.60 mA cm−2, 0.78 V, 0.69 and 9.54%, respectively. The IPCE value of cell B at 470 nm is about 85%. Comparing the photovoltaic performances of the two kinds of cells, Voc and FF are very close to each other, but the Jsc values of cell B are significantly larger than those of cell A. This is due to the great difference in the IPCE spectra. To study the correlation between the photoexcited charge carrier dynamics and the photovoltaic properties, especially the IPCE, we characterized the charge separation and recombination dynamics of cell B with the same methods as mentioned for cell A. The typical result is shown in Fig. 11(b) (for the detailed TA data, please see the ESI,† Fig. S2–S4). Comparing the charge carrier dynamics of the two cells, we find that the recombination time of electrons in TiO2 and holes in the perovskite was almost the same (i.e., 0.13–0.14 μs), and the electron injection time became a little faster (0.7 ns) in the case of cell B (Fig. S2, ESI†). However, the recombination time of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD in cell B became as long as 600 μs, which is ten times larger than that in cell A (60 μs). It would be very interesting and important to see how these changed separation and recombination dynamics influence the IPCE and Jsc of the two kinds of cells. In the following, we focus on the IPCE values at 470 nm, which are 58% and 85% for cell A and cell B, respectively.
It is known that IPCE depends on the optical absorption efficiency ηAbs, charge separation efficiency ηCsep which is the product of electron injection efficiency ηEinj and hole injection efficiency ηHinj, and charge collection efficiency ηCcol as follows: IPCE = ηAbsηCsepηCcol = ηAbsηEinjηHinjηCcol(3)The optical absorption of the two cells could be assumed to be almost the same here, because the perovskite is much more strongly absorbing over a broader range up to 800 nm, which can enable a complete (e.g., at 470 nm) and broader light absorption in films as thin as 500 nm.4,13 So we think the great difference in the IPCE as well as Jsc should originate from the charge separation efficiency ηCsep and charge collection efficiency ηCcol, which are related to charge transfer and the recombination rate. ηHinj can be calculated using the hole injection time tHT from the CH3NH3PbClI2 to spiro-OMeTAD and recombination time trec1 from the perovskite to TiO2, and thus ηHinj is the same for the two cells and can be estimated to be about 90% using the following equation: ηHinj = (1/tHT)/(1/tHT + 1/trec1)(4)where tHT and trec1 are 16 ns and 0.14 μs or 0.13 μs, respectively. ηEinj can be considered to be close to 100% for the two cells according to the following eqn (5), since the electron injection times tET from the CH3NH3PbClI2 to TiO2 (0.7–1.8 ns) were more than two orders smaller than the photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes tlifetime (as long as μs) of CH3NH3PbClI2 and no fast recombination (observed in the case of CH3NH3PbClI2 on Y2O3 substrate with a lifetime of 34 ps) was observed in CH3NH3PbClI2/TiO2. ηEinj = (1/tET)/(1/tET + 1/tlifetime)(5)Thus, charge separation efficiency can be considered to be about 90% for both cells. Therefore, the great difference in the IPCE of the two cells is mainly because of the difference in charge collection efficiency ηCcol. Similar to solid-state DSCs, ηCcol is determined by the relative diffusion time of electrons tEdif through TiO2 to the collection electrode (i.e., the FTO electrode) and the relative diffusion time of holes tHdif through spiro-OMeTAD to the collection electrode (i.e., the Au electrode) compared to the recombination time trec2 of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD.27 To achieve high ηCcol, trec2 should be much larger than tEdif and tHdif, i.e., electrons and holes should arrive at the collection electrodes before their recombination with each other. In the case of cell B, the IPCE value at 470 nm is 85%, and ηCsep is about 90% as mentioned above. The optical absorption efficiency can be considered to be more than 90% at 470 nm considering the higher optical absorption coefficient as mentioned above, optical scattering and reflection. Then, ηCcol can be considered to be close to 100% for cell B according to eqn (3). This result indicates that the recombination time trec2 of 600 μs in cell B is large enough compared to tEdif and tHdif so that electrons and holes can be collected almost completely before their recombination. On the other hand, for cell A, the IPCE value at 470 nm is 58%, suggesting that ηCcol is about 70% as discussed above, which is much smaller than that of cell B. This result means that the recombination time trec2 of 60 μs in cell A is not large enough compared to tEdif and tHdif, and thus about 30% of the charge carriers were lost due to recombination during transport of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD. These results indicate that for the perovskite-based solar cells, the key point for IPCE and Jsc is the charge recombination during charge carrier transport through ETM and HTM rather than charge separation or optical absorption. For a TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD solar cell device, where the thicknesses of TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2 and spiro-OMeTAD were 500 nm and 150 nm, respectively, we find that a charge recombination time trec2 in the order of a few 100 μs is long enough to achieve near complete charge collection. The reason for the great difference in trec2 between cells A and B has the following possibilities. (1) The surface area of the TiO2 nanostructured layer in cell B (30 nm) is smaller than that in cell A (18 nm), thus the recombination possibility of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD was decreased greatly. (2) The TiO2 nanostructured layer in cell B has larger pore sizes, which may result in larger crystalline perovskite growing on the TiO2 surface. Therefore, the contact interface between TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD would decrease or the distance between them would increase. As a result, the recombination probability of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD would decrease. The details are under study now. It is beyond the scope of this paper and will be published elsewhere.
Conclusions
We systematically studied the photoexcited charge carrier dynamics of perovskite CH3NH3PbClI2 deposited on both Y2O3 and TiO2 films. We clarified the charge carrier lifetimes, charge separation and recombination dynamics in the CH3NH3PbClI2-based solid-state hybrid solar cells, where TiO2 was used as the ETM and spiro-OMeTAD was employed as the HTM. Photovoltaic properties together with charge separation and recombination dynamics of two kinds of TiO2/CH3NH3PbClI2/spiro-OMeTAD solar cells were compared, where TiO2 nanoparticles of different sizes (cell A: 18 nm; cell B: 30 nm) were used in the nanostructured TiO2 layer. Cell B showed higher IPCE, Jsc and efficiency compared to cell A. We found that the great differences in the IPCE and Jsc of the two kinds of cells resulted from the great difference in charge recombination of electrons in TiO2 and holes in spiro-OMeTAD. These results indicate that the key point for the IPCE and Jsc of the perovskite-based solar cells is charge collection efficiency, rather than charge separation efficiency. These results indicate that suppressing the recombination through appropriate interfacial engineering for the perovskite-based solid hybrid solar cells is very important for achieving high efficiency.
