Herein, we report the construction of double-network luminescent supramolecular hydrogels via in situ copolymerization of acrylamide and functional monomers, which are precoordinated allyl-modified 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid lanthanide complexes Ln·L3 in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol skeleton. The Ln·L3 complexes act as multifunctional conjunctions and cross-link the polyacrylamide chains, thus improving the mechanical strength of the obtained supramolecular hydrogels. As a result, extremely stretchable and tough supramolecular hydrogels with remarkable self-healing capability at room temperature are achieved. Moreover, compared to the individual Ln·L3 emitting precursor, the luminescence performance of the obtained supramolecular hydrogels is significantly improved with much longer excited lifetime and higher luminescent quantum yield, which can be ascribed to the reduced coordinated water molecules in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ ions.
1. Introduction
Luminescent hydrogels offer several advantages, including versatile shaping and patterning, excellent optical qualities, and easy control of the refractive index, making them excellent candidates for various applications such as sensing, imaging, diagnosing, photovoltaic conversion and fabrication of electroluminescent devices.1–4 We have been engaged in the development of robust luminescent supramolecular hybrid hydrogels via co-assembly of lanthanide (Ln) complexes with nanoclay and zeolite matrices.5–8 Although these hydrogels exhibit high elastic modulus, they underperform in extensibility. Moreover, nanoclay-based hydrogels show poor film forming ability as the evaporation of water causes loss of transparence.9 These shortcomings may hamper their further applications of such hydrogels. Recently, we sought to construct lanthanide-containing luminescent hydrogels with a rigorous set of characteristics of high toughness and extreme stretchability, high luminescence efficiency, and facile room-temperature self-healing.
Due to their attractive features including ease of processing, high transparence, flexibility, and controllable cost, polymers are another series of ideal matrices to immobilize lanthanide emitting centers.10–14 In particular, the hydrogels constructed via non-covalent strategies have emerged as effective and appealing substitutes to overcome the drawbacks of brittleness and lack of self-healing ability or stimuli-responsiveness acquired from covalent polymer hydrogels.15–22 In addition, recent progress in the development of tough non-covalent supramolecular hydrogels, specifically double-network (DN) hydrogels developed by Gong et al., endow such hydrogels comparable mechanical strength to covalent cross-linked hydrogels while preserving the abovementioned advantages,23,24 thus making this class of soft and wet materials one of the strongest candidates for use as cartilage substitute materials.25,26
Herein, we designed novel luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels that are tough, stretchable, and self-healable. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with excellent film-forming characteristics and high transparency is employed as the first network.27 Specifically, the second network is constructed via in situ copolymerization of acrylamide (AAm) monomer precursor solutions, consisting of functional co-monomers, which are precoordinated allyl-modified 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (L) lanthanide complexes Ln·L3, to generate luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels (Scheme 1). First, this in situ copolymerization strategy can effectively prevent the aggregation or leaking of lanthanide complex and enable homogeneous distribution of lanthanide ions in the resultant materials; also, the lanthanide complex conjunctions in the second network further cross-link the polyacrylamide chains and significantly improve the mechanical strength as well as extensibility of the obtained DN hydrogels.28,29 As a result, luminescent hydrogels with combined robust mechanical properties and high self-healing efficiency under mild conditions are achieved. Second, the movement of water molecules is confined to the double polymer network, thus protecting lanthanide centers from the infiltration of water molecules. As a result, compared to the Ln·L3 emitting precursor, significantly improved optical properties, namely, prolonged excited lifetimes and higher quantum efficiencies, are achieved in the obtained supramolecular hydrogels.

2. Results and discussions
2.1 Mechanical behavior of the luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels

L and the corresponding Ln·L3 were prepared and comprehensively characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), FT-IR spectroscopy and luminescence titration (Fig. S1–S7, ESI†). In situ copolymerization of Ln·L3 and AAM in the presence of swollen PVA skeleton in water led to the formation of transparent luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels (Fig. S8, ESI†), which can easily be molded into free-standing objects with various shapes (Fig. 1A). Taking both transparency and mechanical strength into account, the monomer concentration of the first network skeleton and the second network C[AAM] were maintained at 0.4 M and 2.0 M, respectively. Moreover, limited by the solubility of Ln·L3 in AAM aqueous solution, C[Ln·L3] was maintained at 25 mM unless specified otherwise.

(B) The tensile stress–strain curves of the SN hydrogels and DN supramolecular hydrogels with varying Ln·L3 concentrations. (C) Samples of the Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogel were subjected to a cycle of loading and unloading to various strains (deformation rate of 100 mm min−1). 
To gain insight into the mechanism of forming strong DN supramolecular hydrogels and verify the roles of Ln·L3 in this process, we further carried out some control experiments. We tried to perform the polymerization of individual AAM monomers at 2.0 M in the absence of Ln·L3 and PVA skeleton. However, the obtained hydrogel was too fragile to be mechanically tested. Double-network hydrogels without Ln·L3 (DN-Non Ln) were also prepared via polymerization of AAM monomers in the presence of PVA skeleton; mechanical improvement was also observed in the obtained DN-Non Ln as it can bear a fracture stress of 5 kPa. Single-network (SN) supramolecular hydrogels were also prepared via copolymerization of AAM monomers (2.0 M) and Ln·L3 (25 mM) and a fracture stress of 20 kPa was achieved. Surprisingly, nominal tensile stress–strain curves of the DN supramolecular hydrogels demonstrated that an increase in C[Ln·L3] leads to drastic strength enhancement (Fig. 1B), and an increase in more than 20 times was achieved at Ln·L3 concentration of 25 mM. Upon stretching, the Eu3+-containing DN hydrogel sheet underwent continuous extension, withstood a fracture stress up to 125 kPa, and underwent elongation of more than 30 times its original length (Fig. 1B and ESI,† Video S1). This phenomenon indicates that Ln·L3 complexes can act as robust multifunctional conjunctions and further cross-link the polyacrylamide chains, thus significantly improving the mechanical strength of the luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels. Further test results indicate that the species and the molar ratio of lanthanide ions have negligible impact on the mechanical properties of the resultant DN supramolecular hydrogels, and both Eu3+- and Tb3+-containing hydrogels as well as the Eu3+/Tb3+ co-doped hydrogel exhibited roughly equal tensile strength (Fig. S9, ESI†). To investigate the hydrogel's capability of recovering from the applied strain, we performed cyclic tensile tests. As shown in Fig. 1C, a hysteresis and apparent residual strain was observed when retracted to zero stress. However, the hydrogels gradually recover to their initial length after a certain period of waiting time, and no visible elongation was observed after several repeated stretching/retraction processes (ESI,† Video S2). Therefore, our hydrogels exhibit reliable fatigue resistance, which may be ascribed to the significant stability of the Ln·L3 complexes.30
In light of the existence of hydrogen bonds between PVA and PAAM in the DN supramolecular hydrogels,31 self-healing between two cut surfaces is expected. Hence, we rejoined the freshly cut Eu3+- and Tb3+-containing hydrogels (denoted as self-healed hydrogel) and allowed them to self-heal for 1 h. No trace of the self-healed scar was evident even when observed under 254 nm UV lamp illumination, and tensile testing showed that the healed hydrogel still displayed comparable fracture stress (Fig. S9, ESI†) with the virgin supramolecular hydrogel. Also, no rupture occurred at the self-healed site (Fig. 1A), implying that the mechanical properties of the DN hydrogels were fully recuperated within 1 h after cutting.
2.2 Rheological properties of the luminescent DN supramolecular hydrogels
To further characterize the dynamic mechanical behavior of DN supramolecular hydrogels, we performed rheological tests on the abovementioned supramolecular hydrogels at different frequencies and strains. Both Eu3+- and Tb3+-containing as well as Eu3+/Tb3+ co-doped DN supramolecular hydrogels exhibited similar rheological behaviors (Fig. 2A–C). The storage modulus (G′) value was larger than the loss modulus (G′′) value in the applied frequency range, indicating the characteristic of a stable gel phase material. An average G′ value of 90 kPa was achieved, and both the dynamic mechanical strength and tensile stress were markedly improved compared to that of the SN supramolecular hydrogels constructed via a similar strategy.30 The elastic modulus increased significantly with the increase in the test frequency from 0.01 to 100 Hz, indicating that the hydrogels are more viscoelastic than the general block copolymer hydrogels.32 We also determined the rheological properties of self-healed supramolecular hydrogels (Fig. 2D), and no distinct change was observed in both G′ and G′′ values compared to those of the virgin hydrogels, which confirmed the complete recovery of the DN supramolecular hydrogels without mechanical strength loss after the self-healing process. Strain sweep was carried out by taking Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogels as an example (Fig. 2E). Upon fixing the strain amplitude sweep at ω = 1.59 Hz, the hydrogel was subjected to increasing shear strain from 0.1 to 10000%. Interestingly, the elastic modulus remained steady even when the strain reached 200%, indicating the excellent damage resistance capacity. With the further increase in strain, the elastic modulus began to decrease, indicating softening of the hydrogel. The yielding behavior was observed when the strain was over 1000%, which corroborates the tensile mechanical testing results, indicating that the hydrogel could withstand a very large deformation before breaking. We also tested the recovery property of the DN supramolecular hydrogel by employing alternating strain amplitudes of 2000% and 0.1% at a fixed frequency (1.59 Hz). As shown in Fig. 2F, prompt recovery of the network was observed during the subsequent small amplitude sweep. These results indicate that in situ copolymerized robust DN supramolecular hydrogels possess the property of rapid self-healing at the microscopic level.

2.3 Luminescence properties of the supramolecular hydrogels
Benefitting from the high coordination number of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (PDA),33 both Ln·L3 aqueous solution and the subsequently obtained supramolecular hydrogels exhibited the typical characteristic color and brightness of Ln complexes upon irradiation under 254 nm UV lamp illumination (Fig. 1A and Fig. S10, ESI†). The corresponding emission spectrum of Tb3+-containing supramolecular hydrogels consists of four sharp emission lines at 490, 543, 582, and 621 nm, assigned to the transitions from the 5D4 level to the 7FJ levels (J = 6, 5, 4, 3), of which the 5D4 → 7F2 line is prominent and responsible for the green emission. The emission spectrum of Eu3+-containing supramolecular hydrogels displayed five sharp peaks at 582, 594, 615, 650, and 694 nm, which could be assigned to 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions. Among the peaks, the 5D0 → 7F2 band at 615 nm is predominantly responsible for the luminescence emission in red. Emission color can be tailored from green to red through yellow by altering the molar ratio of the two lanthanide chromophores (Eu3+ and Tb3+) in DN supramolecular hydrogels (Fig. 3A, B and Fig. S11, ESI†). We also studied the change in luminescence behavior versus stretching, as shown in Fig. 3C. There was only a 20% emission intensity decrease even when the hydrogel was stretched to 10 times its original length, and this property might render them extremely valuable for various optical applications, such as collapsible displays and coating devices.

The overall quantum yield (Φ) and excited-state lifetime (τ) of DN supramolecular hydrogels were determined (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†) and listed in Table 1. Compared to the values of the Ln·L3 precursor aqueous solution, significant prolonged luminescence lifetimes and increased quantum efficiencies of both Eu3+ and Tb3+ excited states were observed in the DN supramolecular hydrogels. Possible reasons for the significant luminescence improvement can be explained as follows: on the one hand, the in situ copolymerization method enabled more homogeneous distribution of lanthanide ions and can effectively prevent the aggregation of emitting centers; on the other hand, water molecules were preserved in the double network and their movement was immobilized by the polymer matrix, thus preventing the diffusion of water molecules to Ln complexes.7

To verify our hypothesis on shielding the Ln complexes from water in the DN supramolecular hydrogels, the number of water molecules in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ ions in both Ln·L3 aqueous solution and DN hydrogels was estimated according to the reported method34,35 (for details, please see the Experimental section in ESI†). The luminescence lifetime of the Eu·L3 solution in H2O decreased significantly compared to that observed in the D2O medium (Table 1). Based on these values, the coordinated water number q in the Eu·L3 aqueous solution was determined as 2.27, which indicates that more than two water molecules coordinate with the Eu3+ ion in the Eu·L3 aqueous solution. In contrast, the luminescence decay rate of Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogels in H2O only decreased slightly compared to that in D2O, leading to a small coordinated water number of 0.08 in the first coordination sphere of the Eu3+ ion. The coordinated water number in the first coordination sphere of Tb3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogel was determined as 0.19, which is also much smaller than the value of 1.44 in the Tb·L3 aqueous solution. These results confirm that the presence of double networks leads to a sharp decrease in the water number in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ ions, thus improving luminescence behaviors of Ln complexes in DN supramolecular hydrogels.
We subsequently explored the possibility of processing the hydrogels into thin films. Flexible self-standing and highly transparent thin films were prepared by simply casting the DN supramolecular hydrogels on a silicon substrate and drying at 60 °C (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, the luminescence quantum efficiency of the obtained thin films boosted again compared to that of the DN supramolecular hydrogels; extremely high quantum efficiency of 52.4% for Tb3+-containing thin films and 48.2% for Eu3+-containing thin films were achieved (Fig. 4B). These findings can be attributed to the further decrease in the coordinated water number in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ ions in thin films (Table 1). In view of the high transparency of the obtained film, the lanthanide complexes with such high quantum yield will effectively convert higher energy photons in the near UV region into lower energy photons of long wavelengths. Thus, the utilization of these thin films as advanced optical devices or as luminescent down-shifting coating in enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells is highly expected.36–38 We also tested the self-healing property of the thin films; however, the freshly cut thin films do not show self-healing behavior, which may be ascribed to the absence of water molecules in the film as water is usually essential for the formation of hydrogen bonds in healable supramolecular hydrogels.2 After dripping a drop of water on the freshly cut thin film cross-section, we observed that the film shows satisfactory self-healing behavior and can be held vertically (Fig. 4D) or even bent (Fig. 4E).

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have observed remarkable simultaneous enhancement of both mechanical strength and luminescence performance in the presented luminescent supramolecular hydrogels, which were obtained by copolymerization of functional lanthanide-containing co-monomers and acrylamide monomers. Our result is particularly surprising and important when compared with earlier reports regarding lanthanide-doped hydrogels. The presence of lanthanide complex conjunctions could enhance the mechanical performance of our supramolecular hydrogels via further cross-linking the polyacrylamide chains. Moreover, the presence of a polymer network could simultaneously boost the optical properties of our supramolecular hydrogels via reducing the coordinated water number in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ ions. The underlying mechanism was elucidated by comparing the mechanical strength with different lanthanide co-monomer contents and by applying stationary and time-resolved spectroscopy. The properties of the new composites with respect to their utilization for bio-sensing and fabrication of flexible and self-repairable display devices are the topic of further investigations.

 	Scheme 1  Proposed structures and preparation routes of the DN luminescent supramolecular hydrogels formed via in situ copolymerization of Ln·L3 and AAM monomers in the presence of PVA.	 

 	Fig. 1  (A) Pictures of DN supramolecular hydrogels: a disk-shaped hydrogel under daylight (i); Eu3+-containing (ii), Tb3+-containing (iii) and co-doped (iv) (Eu3+/Tb3+ = 5:5) hydrogel sheets (50 × 20 × 3 mm) as well as self-healed hydrogels (v) with strain of 800% under 254 nm UV lamp illumination. (B) The tensile stress–strain curves of the SN hydrogels and DN supramolecular hydrogels with varying Ln·L3 concentrations. (C) Samples of the Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogel were subjected to a cycle of loading and unloading to various strains (deformation rate of 100 mm min−1).	 

 	Fig. 2  Rheological properties of the DN supramolecular hydrogels. Frequency (ω) sweep tests at ω = 0.01–100 rad s−1 and strain (γ) = 1.0% of the Eu3+-containing (A), Tb3+-containing (B), Eu3+/Tb3+ (Eu3+/Tb3+ = 5:5) co-doped (C) and self-healed (D) DN supramolecular hydrogels at 25 °C. (E) Strain sweep test of Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogels at γ = 0.1–10000% with ω = 1.59 Hz. (F) Continuous step strain test of Eu3+-containing DN supramolecular hydrogels at γ = 0.1 and 2000% with ω = 1.59 Hz.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Luminescence emission spectra of the DN supramolecular hydrogels with varying Eu3+/Tb3+ molar ratios and (B) the corresponding CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram (λex = 280 nm), (Tb3+/Eu3+ = 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, 1:9, 0:10, respectively). (C) Luminescence emission spectra of the Eu3+/Tb3+ (Eu3+/Tb3+ = 5:5) co-doped DN supramolecular hydrogel before (i) and after (ii) stretching; the inset shows the pictures of hydrogel monolith before (1) and after (2) stretching under 254 nm UV lamp illumination.
