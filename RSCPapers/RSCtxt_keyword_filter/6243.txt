    , Accepted 3rd April 2020First published on 4th April 2020AbstractEfficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a strategic and promising goal towards clean, green and sustainable fuel production. The most important task in PEC water splitting is the development of an efficient and stable photoanode with effective solar light absorption, generation and separation of free charge carriers, and charge carrier transport to the surface for the oxygen evolution reaction; however, such requirements are challenging to achieve simultaneously. Here we show that this problem can be solved in polycrystalline Ta3N5-nanorods (Ta3N5-NRs) that consist of aggregated single crystalline domains. The fabricated highly-conductive photoanode with large grain domains provides enhanced light harvesting because of the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers, which leads to a completely saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 V (versus RHE) and delivers a solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72% for single-photon photoanodes.

Broader context
Market commercialization of photocatalytic water splitting requires a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of at least 10%, which depends on properties such as effective solar light absorption, generation and separation of free charge carriers, and carrier transport to the surface for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we show that the efficiency of each process can be separately maximised by polycrystalline Ta3N5-nanorods (Ta3N5-NRs) that consist of aggregated single-crystalline domains. We demonstrate this concept in the fabrication of a highly conductive photoanode that consists of large grain domains, and provides enhanced light harvesting because of the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. This results in a completely saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 V vs. RHE and delivers a state-of-the-art solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72% (with photoanode fill-factor (FF) = 42%). In addition, we performed a demonstration of operating the Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanode at 1.1 VRHE for the first time and realised a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA cm−2 under one sun conditions, with a continuous retention of 80% for 70 minutes. We hope that the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes proposed here represent a significant step in the research focused on the practical production of solar hydrogen.

1. Introduction
Efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting process on semiconducting materials is one of the strategic goals of sustainable energy research, because such chemical fuels can be stored and later used on demand.1–6 From the various designed PEC cells that have the potential to reach the required solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 10% for practical application,7 the most economically promising is a cell that is based on a combination of n-type (for water oxidation) and p-type (for proton reduction) semiconductor electrodes as the photoanode (PA) and photocathode (PC). In such a p–n type of PEC cell, the STH conversion efficiency is determined by the matched current density obtained from the PC and PA at the working point, which occurs at the crossover of the current–potential curves of the PC and PA. To improve the STH efficiency of such a device architecture, it is imperative to optimise the current density, fill factor (FF), and onset potential of both the PC and PA. For instance, an increase in the FF of the PA can lower the working potential along with a dramatic improvement in the matched photocurrent density for both electrodes.8,9 It is reported that an improvement in the FF from 50 to 70% for the PC and PA alone can result in an increase of the STH efficiency from 10 to 15%.8 To date, many efficient and stable photocathodes with high photocurrent and FF have been developed;10–15 however, the more challenging task remains of developing an efficient and stable photoanode with FF > 30%. In general, suitable energy band alignment (with respect to the redox potential of water), visible light absorption, efficient charge separation, high photocatalytic activity, and excellent corrosion resistance are the important prerequisite properties required for the development of high performance and stable photo-responsive materials.3,16
Several visible light responsive materials, such as WO3,17 BiVO4,3 heterojunction WO3–BiVO4,18–20 Fe2O321 and Ta3N5, have been recently examined by us and other research groups to determine their suitability for the above-mentioned requirement.22–25 Ta3N5 is one of the most attractive candidates, which satisfies almost all the required criteria. An excellent approach to realise a photocurrent density of ∼12 mA cm−2 (which is ∼90% of the theoretical maximum) was demonstrated by Liu et al.,26 using a sophisticated modification process of Ta3N5, which included the formation of layers of protective and hole-storage complexes on the top using TiO2, Fh, Ni(OH)x and molecular catalysts. Unfortunately, the long-term photostability failed owing to the unstable complex layers. The instability of the photo-active material, Ta3N5, also originates from the fast and permanent surface photocorrosion, which leads to the formation of a surface tantalum oxide thin layer and results in a low PEC activity.27 Surface modification of Ta3N5 by doping ions of foreign materials28–32 and surface modification with a co-catalyst or/and a surface protection layer have been shown to be an excellent strategy to avoid surface photocorrosion. Recently, with a combination of a GaN thin film protective layer and CoPi as a co-catalyst, our group reported on the stabilisation of a Ta3N5 photoanode for water oxidation.33 In such a configuration, the Ta3N5 photoanode showed a stable photocurrent of ∼7.5 mA cm−2 over 10 hours under continuous illumination, which, to date, is the most stable reported photoanode.
In recent years, efforts have been made to fabricate high-performance nanostructured Ta3N5 photoanodes such as nanotubes and nanorods.34–37 The electrode fabrication methods include electrochemical anodisation or/and selective etching processes to produce nanostructured oxide precursors, and subsequent nitridation in a flow of ammonia at high temperature. For instance, one dimensional (1D) undoped Ta3N5 nanorods (NRs) with a length of ∼600 nm were fabricated by our group.36,37 A photocurrent density of ∼5 mA cm−2 was realised at 1.23 VRHE. In principle, a well-aligned and separated Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode is considered as an ideal light-harvesting device, because the photogenerated holes and electrons inside the nanorods can easily diffuse along the nanorod radius toward the side surface and along the nanorod length to reach the Ta substrate, respectively, and hence efficiently suppress the charge carrier recombination process. As a result, the photocurrent in the nanorod-based photoanode can be maximised by separate optimisation of the optical and electronic thicknesses, namely, sufficiently longer nanorods will allow for the absorption of incident solar light at longer wavelength, and a small nanorod radius comparable with the diffusion length will effectively separate the photogenerated charge carriers.
Herein, we demonstrate efficient polycrystalline Ta3N5-NRs fabricated directly on a Ta substrate by the combination of Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) and nitridation techniques. After loading of the FeNiOx oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst, we achieve a saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 under 1 sun illumination at 1.05 VRHE. We show that Ta3N5-NRs with a high-aspect ratio, which are prepared by GLAD, provide enhanced light harvesting with efficient charge separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This leads to a completely saturated photocurrent with FF ∼ 42%, delivering a solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72%.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes
The fabrication of uniform TaOx-nanorods was performed in a custom-made magnetron GLAD system, which was equipped with a three-dimensional (3D) rotation stage that allowed positioning of the substrates over each magnetron at a desired distance and normal or glancing angle. In such a GLAD configuration, the deposition under the glancing angle led to the formation of vertically standing separated nanorods, instead of a thin compact film, owing to the shadowing effect,18,38,39 which prevented the deposition of the incident atoms behind spontaneously formed islands, Fig. S1, ESI.† The morphology of the nanorods depends on the material and deposition conditions such as the substrate roughness, angular distribution of the deposited flux, working gas pressure and flux energetics. For instance, at a higher working pressure during the GLAD process, more collisions between the sputtered atoms significantly increased the flux distribution and resulted in the increase of the diameter and decrease in the density of the fabricated nanorods on a tantalum (Ta) substrate. By optimisation of the GLAD parameters such as the magnetron power, working pressure and sample rotation speed, the diameter and areal density of the nanorods were optimised. A Ta substrate (10 × 10 × 0.3 mm, 99.95%, Nilaco Co., Japan, mirror polished) was placed on the substrate holder, which was located over the magnetron or sputtering source (with a Ta target, 99.99%, Toshima Co., Japan) at a distance of 12 cm and glancing deposition angle α = 85° to the substrate normal as shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† A mixture of Ar (with flow rate 15 sccm) and O2 (7.5 sccm) gas was used for the reactive sputtering of TaOx. To achieve a constant deposition rate of the sputtered material during the GLAD process, pre-sputtering with a closed magnetron shutter was performed for 15 minutes at a RF magnetron power of 350 W. When the deposition rate of the sputtered material reached a constant rate, the shutter was opened to perform the GLAD process. The sample with a well-separated and uniform shape of the vertically aligned TaOx-NRs was denoted as “optimised”, which was prepared at a working pressure of 0.35 Pa with a sample rotation speed of 55 rpm, while the other sample, consisting of non-uniform shape TaOx-NRs, was denoted as “non-optimised”, which was fabricated at 0.45 Pa and 45 rpm. The as-grown amorphous TaOx-NRs on the Ta substrate, placed in a horizontal tube furnace, were converted to the crystalline phase of Ta3N5 by nitridation using an NH3 flow rate of 250 sccm at 980 °C for 2.5 hours, which was followed by natural cooling. For more details, please see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI.†
2.2. Characterisation
The crystal structure of the Ta3N5-NR-based electrodes was measured by XRD (Smart Lab., Rigaku, Japan) with CuKα irradiation. The surface morphologies, crystallinities and elemental compositions of the Ta3N5-NRs were characterised by SEM (SU8020, HITACHI, Japan) and HRTEM (JEM-2800, JEOL, Japan) instruments equipped with SAED and electron dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. The chemical states of Ta in the Ta3N5-NR based samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Ulvac-Phi, Inc.) using an Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energy of the obtained XPS spectra was calibrated to the C 1s peak of carbon at 284.4 eV.
2.3. PEC measurements
The PEC characterisation of the photoanodes was conducted according to the standard PEC characterisation protocol40 in 0.5 M K2HPO4 electrolyte (pH 13, adjusted by KOH) by a standard three-electrode method with a Ag/AgCl reference, a Pt counter and a fabricated Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode working electrode. The working electrode potential was controlled using a potentiostat HV-100 (Hokuto Denko, Japan). The electrode potentials were converted to values versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the Nernst equation:VRHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + V0Ag/AgCl,where EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and V0Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl at 25 °C (0.198 V). To avoid electrolyte heating in the PEC cell during photoanode evaluation under the simulated solar light, a cooling plate (as one cool plate, model SCP85) was used on which the PEC cell was placed. A commercial solar simulator (XES-40S2, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) was used for irradiation of the photoanode with a light intensity (AM 1.5G) of 100 mW cm−2, which was adjusted by using an NREL calibrated photodetector. Photocurrent density–potential (Jp–E) curves were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 from the cathodic region under chopped or/and non-chopped simulated solar light. HC-STH values for the fabricated photoanodes were determined from the Jp–E curves by using the following equation:HC-STH (%) = Jp × (1.23 − VRHE) × (100/P),where Jp (mA cm−2) is the photoanode photocurrent density, V is the electrode potential versus RHE and P is the intensity of the simulated solar light (AM 1.5G = 100 mW cm−2).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a MAX-302 Xe light source (Asahi Spectra, Japan) equipped with bandpass filters to provide monochromatic light. Values of the IPCE for all the fabricated photoanodes were calculated using the following equation:IPCE (%) = [(1240/λ) × Jp/P] × 100,where λ (nm) is the wavelength of the monochromatic incident light, Jp (mA cm−2) is the photocurrent density and P (mW cm−2) is the power density of the incident light.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (METEK Inc., VersaSTAT3) of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes was performed at a potential of 1.23 V (versus RHE) with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and frequencies ranging from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. The acquired data were fitted by the ZView program (Scribner Associates, Inc.) using an equivalent circuit model including resistances and constant phase element (CPE) values.
2.4. Optical simulations of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode
The Ta3N5-NR based photoanode was modelled by a unit cell which consisted of a cylindrical nanorod of Ta3N5 on a Ta substrate. The geometry parameters, such as the diameter at the top and bottom, height t of the NR, and periodicity of the unit cell, closely resembled those determined from the SEM image of the fabricated Ta3N5-NR/Ta photoanode. Owing to a measurement limitation in the NR device architecture, we considered that the material parameters of the Ta3N5-NR were similar to a thin film. The complex refractive index (refractive index n, extinction coefficient k) of Ta3N5 from ellipsometry measurements was used for the NR and is provided in the ESI.† We set the refractive index as n = 1.47, 1.33 and 3 for the glass, the electrolyte, and the Ta substrate, respectively. Apart from the NR, the extinction coefficient was set to k = 0 for all the remaining layers. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, optical simulations of the glass/water/Ta3N5-NR/Ta device in 3D were performed using the finite element frequency domain method, where the Maxwell equations of electromagnetic waves were solved to obtain the electric field of light propagation at each meshing node. For this, continuous periodic boundary conditions for the electric field were applied to opposite faces, and the solar spectrum AM 1.5G was incident normally on the glass. Using the phase elimination method, we calculated the optical characteristics; that is, the absorption A(λ), reflection RF(λ) and transmission TR(λ) of light propagation for various wavelengths λ. To avoid computational complexities, the generation rate G of the charge carriers was calculated from the Beer–Lambert law and is given by:  where α(λ) is the absorption coefficient, N0(λ) is the photon flux density of the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, and λ1 = 280 nm and λ2 = 625 nm (where IPCE (1.23 VRHE) approaches 0). The scaling factor a (= 1.048 × t/Dtop) was adjusted so that the current densities obtained from optical simulations  and the Beer–Lambert law were equal. Using the phase elimination method, we calculated the optical characteristics; that is, the absorption, reflection and transmission of light propagation for various wavelengths.41
2.5. Electrical simulations of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode
Because both the potential (or energy band) variation and carrier transport were symmetrical around the centre of the Ta3N5-NR, the unit cell could be translated from a 3D to a two-dimensional structure for electrical calculations. Such dimensional simplification enabled us to effectively reduce the number of meshing points and hence the computational time. The geometry parameters were similar to those obtained from the optical simulations (or SEM image) of the Ta3N5-NR/Ta photoanode. The material parameters necessary for electrical simulations, which were extracted from the literature, are provided in Table S1, ESI.† The flux of excited charge carriers in the NR was provided by the generation rate G obtained from the optical calculations, whereas the charge carrier relaxation was modelled by the mid-gap defect-assisted Shockley–Reed–Hall recombination rate R (characterised by an equal lifetime τ for electrons and holes). The charge carrier lifetime τ (or diffusion length ) was varied to investigate the role of bulk recombination loss in the performance metrics. We considered an ohmic contact at the substrate; however, the electrolyte was modelled by a pseudo Schottky contact with work function Wel and a surface reaction rate. The work function Wel was fixed at the middle of the redox potential of H2 and O2 at pH 13. Because the activity of O2 evolution was controlled by the extraction of holes, the surface reaction rate or recombination velocity for electrons and holes was set to 0 and Sh, respectively. Using the semiconductor module of COMSOL Multiphysics, electrical simulations were performed by solving the Poisson equation and the drift-diffusion and continuity equation self-consistently at each discretised node. The series resistance Rs effect was incorporated by scaling the potential V axis with V + JRs, where J is the simulated photocurrent density and Rs is the area normalised series resistance.
3. Results
3.1. Morphological and structural properties of Ta3N5-NR based photoanodes
Ta3N5-NRs were fabricated on Ta and fused silica substrates by the combination of GLAD, using a RF-magnetron sputtering source, and nitridation techniques. More details on the fabrication process of the NRs can be found in the Experimental section and Fig. S1, ESI.†Fig. 1a shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the Ta3N5-NRs fabricated on a Ta substrate (Ta/Ta3N5-NRs) before and after the nitridation process. The XRD patterns of the as-grown TaOx-NRs on a Ta substrate (Ta/TaOx-NRs) corresponded to an amorphous structure, while both the nitridised samples exhibited a high crystallographic purity of the Ta3N5 material. The XRD patterns for both the fabricated samples were in good agreement with monoclinic crystalline Ta3N5 without any crystalline tantalum sub-nitrides. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images recorded from both nitride samples are presented in Fig. 1(b–e) and confirmed the vertical alignment of the fabricated Ta3N5 nanorods directly on the Ta substrate without the aggregation of the NRs. Well-separated and vertically-aligned Ta3N5-NR-based samples can be fabricated uniformly (as shown in Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) by our GLAD technique over a larger area of ∼4 × 5 cm. With a length of 2100 nm for both samples, the average diameter and areal NR density of the optimised Ta3N5-NRs estimated from the SEM images were ∼120–130 nm and 1.2 × 109 cm−2 and were 210–230 nm and 8.2 × 108 cm−2 for the non-optimised Ta3N5-NRs.

(b–e) Top and cross-sectional SEM images of the optimised and non-optimised Ta/Ta3N5-NRs. Transmission electron microscopy images and selected area electron diffraction patterns acquired from the optimised (f and g) and non-optimised (h and i) Ta3N5-NRs. Scale bars (b–e) 500 nm, (f and h) 100 nm. 
The nanostructure of the optimised and non-optimised Ta3N5-NR-based samples was further characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fig. 1(f–i). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 1(g and i) demonstrated sharp diffraction spots, which were indexed to the [−3−32] and [−312] zone axes for the optimised and non-optimised samples, respectively, which confirmed that both Ta3N5-NR samples were composed of single-crystalline-like domains. A different growth orientation was observed by TEM in both the Ta3N5-NR-based samples, analogous to our previous work36 on the nitridation process of Ta2O5. Nevertheless, the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. S5, ESI,† reveals that both fabricated nanorods consisted of single-crystalline domains, and these single-crystal regions varied in size and orientation with respect to each other. In this sense, our fabricated Ta3N5-NRs were polycrystalline and were made up of an aggregate of small grains, with sizes ranging between 10 and 50 nm. Dark field images for the optimised and non-optimised Ta3N5-NRs obtained from the (0−2−3) and (130) diffraction spots of the electron diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. S5(d and h), ESI,† respectively. All the grains appeared bright, which indicated that grains with orientations other than (0−2−3) for optimised and (130) for non-optimised were absent. Interestingly, the optimised sample showed almost two to three times bigger grain sizes compared with the non-optimised sample, as well as much shorter distances between the grains with the same crystallographic direction. The HRTEM observation results were consistent with those of SAED.
3.2. The PEC characteristic of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes
Prior to the PEC evaluation, the Ta3N5-NR samples were homogeneously covered by the FeNiOx OER co-catalyst (Fig. S6–S9, ESI†), to protect their surface from photocorrosion and to promote the oxygen evolution reaction. These results clearly demonstrated that loading the FeNiOx co-catalyst did not change the morphological properties of the fabricated photoanodes. Fig. 2a and Fig. S10, ESI,† show the current–potential (V versus RHE) curves (J–VRHE) of the optimised and non-optimised Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanodes under chopped simulated sunlight of AM 1.5G. The onset potential for the optimized photoanode is detected at ∼0.57 VRHE (measured at 0.2 mA cm−2), which cathodically shifts by ∼0.2 VRHE in comparison to the non-optimized photoanode (Fig. S11, ESI†). More importantly, the optimised photoanode showed a quick rise in the photocurrent with the applied potential beyond the onset potential and achieves photocurrent saturation of 9.95 mA cm−2 at ∼1.05 VRHE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest photocurrent density reported for a Ta3N5-based photoanode at such a low applied potential. In addition, at lower applied potentials from 0.6–0.9 VRHE, the measured photocurrent densities were in the range of 0.7–8.5 mA cm−2, which were 7 times higher as compared to the non-optimised samples. In addition, from Fig. S12a and b (ESI†), we find that the Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode provides significantly high photocurrent density in comparison to the bare Ta3N5-NR photoanode, which is due to the excellent charge separation efficiency. Besides this, the wavelength dependence of the IPCE for both samples was probed at various applied potentials and 1.1 VRHE, as shown in Fig. S13, S14, ESI,† and Fig. 2b, respectively. The IPCEs at 1.1 VRHE for the optimised sample were in between 87 and 75% for the broad range of wavelengths 380–540 nm and were almost two times higher compared with the non-optimised sample. Thus, the optimised photoanode demonstrated excellent photon absorption and its conversion to solar water oxidation. The expected current densities of 9.6 mA cm−2 and 4.8 mA cm−2 in Fig. 2c, obtained by integrating the product of the IPCE with the AM 1.5G photon flux over all wavelengths, were consistent with the photocurrent density from J–VRHE shown in Fig. 2a for both the samples at 1.1 VRHE. Furthermore, from Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†), we observed that the integrated current using the IPCE and the photocurrent from the J–VRHE data were in good agreement at different applied potential for both samples. Fig. 2d depicts the half-cell solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (HC-STH, η) for both the optimised and non-optimised Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanodes. The optimised photoanode demonstrated a maximum HC-STH of 2.72% at 0.89 VRHE, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest efficiency among the recently reported state-of-the-art photoanodes based on single-step photo-excitation.42–44

(e) Presentation of the fill-factor (FF) to define the rectangularity of the J–VRHE curve determined according to eqn (1), where IMP and VPM are the current density and potential at the maximum power point (PMAX), ISC is the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE and EON is the onset potential. The electrolyte used is 1 M KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 13 by KOH. 
Another key parameter that quantitatively characterises a photoanode is the FF. In a photovoltaic (PV) cell, the FF is defined as the ratio of the maximum obtained power to the product of the short-circuit current and open circuit voltage.45 Similarly, we demonstrated, in our previous work, the concept of using the rectangularity of the J–VRHE characteristic of the photoanode to determine the FF of the photoanode.46 The current–potential characteristics of the optimised photoanode and the estimated maximum power point are shown in Fig. 2e. As per the previously employed definition of the onset potential, our optimised photoanode exhibited an outstanding FF of ∼42%. To date, this is the best FF value exhibited by a single-photon photoanode. The FF of a photoanode is an important feature for constructing p–n type PEC cells. A higher photoanode FF will shift the working potential of the PEC cell to a lower potential, which enables usage of a photocathode with a smaller driving force and a more negative onset of cathodic photocurrent. Our optimised photoanode is able to generate a photocurrent density of almost 10 mA cm−2 at 1.05 VRHE. Additionally, this superior photocurrent density from our optimised photoanode, with a light absorption edge of ∼600 nm, can enable the realisation of a solar energy conversion efficiency greater than 10% in a PEC water splitting device in tandem with simple PV cells with a light absorption edge >600 nm.
To quantitatively prove that the PEC reaction was optimised for the Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode and Pt-counter electrode to produce O2 and H2 gases, respectively, gas chromatography measurements were performed. Measurements of the evolved O2 and H2 gases were carried out in an air-tight three-electrode PEC cell with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. The PEC cell was connected to a gas chromatograph and to a vacuum pump. Prior to the measurements, the PEC cell was pumped to a base pressure of a few Torr and then backfilled with Ar to approximately 40 Torr. Under steady-state simulated AM 1.5G light, the chronoamperometry (Jp–t) curve of the optimised Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode showed a reproducible photocurrent of ∼9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.1 VRHE, see Fig. 3b. The amounts of evolved O2 and H2 were detected by gas chromatography and the respective faradaic efficiencies (ξF) were evaluated, as shown in Fig. 3a. O2 and H2 were evolved at the expected stoichiometric ratio with generation rates of 82.8 and 164.9 μmol h−1 cm−2. ξF, which corresponds to the ratio between the directly measured gas and that calculated from the Jp–t curve, is presented in Fig. 3a (right axis). ξF reached 85% within the first 10–15 minutes and later became saturated at ∼95–96% for both the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction. The continuous production of O2 on the Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode, with close to 100% ξF, suggested that the anodic photocurrent was fully used for O2 production. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, we performed a demonstration of operating the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode at 1.1 VRHE for the first time and realised a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA cm−2 under one sun simulated sunlight, which showed good stability for the OER with a continuous retention of 80% for 70 minutes, as shown in Fig. 3b.

(a) Evolution of H2 and O2 with faradaic efficiency on the right axis and (b) photocurrent for the Ta/Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx optimised photoanode at 1.1 VRHE under AM 1.5G simulated solar light. The characterisation of the photoanode was conducted in 1 M KH2PO4 electrolyte adjusted to pH 13 by KOH in a three-electrode configuration. 
To understand the possible mechanism behind the reduction in photocurrent at 1.1 VRHE during the stability test, we performed SEM, TEM, XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of fresh and post stability test optimised and non-optimised samples. The SEM images of both samples in Fig. S15, ESI,† reveal that the morphology of the NRs is retained after the stability test of the samples with and without the cocatalyst, which suggests that the NRs do not undergo photocorrosion. Further, from Fig. S16 (ESI†), TEM images of the optimised and non-optimised samples show that the single crystalline domain size and structure of both samples do not change after the stability test. However, STEM-EDS in Fig. S17 and S18, ESI,† shows that the FeNiOx cocatalyst on the surface of the NR is partially removed, which gives rise to the formation of a thin amorphous oxide film as confirmed by HRTEM in Fig. S16, ESI.† In addition, after the stability test, no change in the bulk composition of the NRs for both samples is observed from the XRD pattern shown in Fig. S19, ESI.† Besides this, a surface study of the NRs using XPS measurements (in Fig. S20, ESI†) provides evidence of nitrogen deficiency on the NRs, thereby leading to the formation of a TaOx thin film after the stability test, which is also supported by the HRTEM image. Such surface oxidation of NRs leads to Fermi level pinning (Fig. S20d–h, ESI†), which is the probable cause for the reduction in photocurrent at 1.1 VRHE after the stability test. Our results are in good accordance with the recent observations reported in the literature.47 We believe that the protection of the NR surface by a co-catalyst or/and a conductive protective layer like GaN or MgO is imperative to improve the stability of the Ta3N5-NR based photoanodes.47,48 For instance, from Fig. S12c and d (ESI†), we find that the FeNiOx co-catalyst indeed improves the stability of the NRs by protecting the Ta3N5-NRs surface towards the formation of a resistive TaOx thin film.
3.3. Opto-electrical simulations of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode
Opto-electrical simulations were performed to study the current potential characteristics of the modelled Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode (shown in Fig. 4a). The IPCE or current density at a given applied potential depends on (a) the photogenerated hole density arising from light absorption in a Ta3N5-NR and (b) the extraction rate of holes by the electrolyte. The schematic of the charge carrier dynamics in the Ta3N5-NR is provided in Fig. S21a, ESI.† Using the complex refractive index of Ta3N5 provided in Fig. S21b, ESI,† the optical simulation results in Fig. 4b and Fig. S21c and d, ESI,† revealed that light absorption was limited by optical losses such as reflection loss in the short wavelength regime (<500 nm) and/or transmission loss in the long wavelength regime (>500 nm). Owing to the effects of scattering and absorption in the Ta3N5-NRs, the reflection loss was significantly less than that of a Ta3N5 thin-film with a similar thickness. This clearly indicated that the reflection loss can be significantly suppressed by proper device design of Ta3N5-based photoanodes. In addition to optical losses, the current density at 1.23 VRHE was affected by the bulk recombination loss of photogenerated charge carriers. For instance, in Fig. 4c, the current density at 1.23 VRHE increased and became saturated with an increase in the carrier lifetime, τ (or diffusion length LD). At high LD (>Dtop) or corresponding τ, the saturated current density was limited solely by optical losses; however, the current densities at low LD were further reduced by additional bulk recombination loss. Similar trends of current density with varying carrier lifetime were also observed for a thin-film device architecture. The results indicated that NRs required significantly less diffusion length or carrier lifetime than similar thickness thin films to achieve a similar current density at 1.23 VRHE. From Fig. 4c, by comparing simulations with the experimental data, the estimated carrier lifetime was τ = 1.36 ns.

(b) Mapping of optical (TR – transmission, RF – reflection), and recombination (RC) losses along with the harvested/extracted (for OER) fraction under AM1.5 solar irradiance spectra.

(d) Energy band diagram at different applied potential V. (e) Charge carrier density (electron – n and hole – p) along with the difference of generation G and recombination R (G–R) profiles at V = 1.23 and 0.75 VRHE. (f) Comparison of simulated (Sim. – circle symbol) and experimental (Exp. – line) data of the current potential characteristics of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode. The current density at 1.23 VRHE is dictated by optical and recombination losses, whereas the onset potential is limited by the surface reaction rate along with recombination losses. 
Fig. S22, ESI,† indicates that the onset potential reduced with the increase in the surface reaction rate or hole extraction rate Sh and diffusion length, whereas the current density at 1.23 VRHE was determined by the absorption and diffusion length but not by the surface reaction rate. It is evident that the rate of change of the current at a potential around the onset potential and that around 1.23 VRHE were not significantly affected by the surface reaction rate and diffusion length. However, parasitic resistance, such as series resistance, significantly decreased the rise of the current with the potential and thereby degraded the FF. In addition, the saturated current density regime at a high applied potential reduced with an increase of the series resistance. Based on this, with a series resistance of 12 Ω cm2, we calibrated the simulated data with the experimental current potential characteristics in Fig. 4f and estimated material parameters such as the (1) diffusion length or carrier lifetime, (2) surface reaction rate, and (3) series resistance for the optimised sample of the Ta3N5-NR based photoanode. Furthermore, the energy band diagram in Fig. 4d, along with the charge carrier density and extracted charge carrier rate in Fig. 4e at different potentials, clearly suggests that the reduction in current density with the decrease in potential arose from the significant increase of the recombination loss in the depletion region at the NR/electrolyte interface.
In the literature, various groups have realised Ta3N5-NR based photoanodes with different morphology with low photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE.36,37,49 We suspected that such a low photocurrent density is due to insufficient length of the NRs for light absorption at longer wavelength along with a non-optimised diameter of the NRs (not comparable to the diffusion length, as justified by Fig. 4c). To justify our theory, we investigate the role of the length of the NR (L) in the PEC performance of the Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode. For this, we perform optical and electrical simulations of the modelled device (shown in Fig. 4a) by varying L. From the optical simulation results shown in Fig. S23a (ESI†) we find that the light absorption at high wavelength (>450 nm) increases with the increase in L. Consequently, from Fig. S23b (ESI†), the integrated current density obtained from simulated light absorption improves with the increase in L and nearly gets saturated beyond L = 2000 nm. Such characteristics of the current density with L are governed by optical losses such as reflection and transmission. However, the photocurrent density of the fabricated Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode at 1.23 VRHE is further limited by recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which is dictated by the diffusion length/carrier lifetime or crystalline quality of the NRs. Fig. S23c (ESI†) shows the current potential characteristics of fabricated Ta3N5-NR based photoanodes with respective SEM images having different length Ta3N5-NRs. As predicted by simulation results, the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE of the fabricated samples increases with the increase in the length of the NR. The difference in the integrated current density from light absorption and the measured photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE is a measure of the recombination loss of charge carriers. Therefore, from a comparison of the simulation trend with the experimental data, we find that the charge carrier recombination loss reduces with the increase in the NR length, which suggests that the carrier lifetime increases with the increase in the NR length. From Fig. 23b (ESI†), we conclude that the optimized Ta3N5-NRs with L = 2100 nm have a higher carrier lifetime in comparison to small length NRs, which is responsible for such performance improvement.
4. Discussion
The advantages of the uniform and well-separated Ta3N5-NRs mentioned above were used to produce an enhanced photoanode performance and to moderate its stability. We demonstrated a maximum HC-STH efficiency of 2.72% at 0.89 VRHE, which sets a new performance benchmark for single-photon photoanodes, see Fig. 5. Additionally, our optimised polycrystalline Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanode showed a saturated photocurrent of ∼9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 VRHE. These results clearly demonstrate that the present Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode is an excellent option for PEC application and is comparable to other existing nanostructures.
 Fig. 5  Reported state-of-the-art efficiencies for single-photon photoanodes. Numerical data are given in Table S3, ESI.† 
On the basis of the above results and the simulation process, we propose the main reason for the enhanced and saturated photocurrent in the optimised photoanode. As shown in Fig. S5, ESI,† the optimised Ta3N5-NRs consisted of grains that were two- to three-times bigger in comparison to those in the non-optimised photoanode, with much shorter distances between the domains with the same crystal direction. Such variation in the morphology of grains for both samples can induce a change in the bulk carrier lifetime or diffusion length and conductivity inside a Ta3N5-NR. As evidenced from our simulation results shown in Fig. S22, ESI,† a high diffusion length or surface reaction rate decreased the onset potential, whereas a high series resistance degraded the FF. Furthermore, an additional onset potential decrease can originate from the decrease of the flat-band potential owing to an increase in the donor density. Based on this, it was expected that the optimised sample would exhibit (1) high carrier lifetime and diffusion length, (2) low electrical resistance (bulk and interfacial), and (3) high doping density along with a low flat band potential in comparison to the non-optimised sample.
To verify our expectation, both the optimised and non-optimised photoanodes were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to understand the charge carrier transport inside the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode. The fitted Nyquist plots under illumination conditions (Fig. S24 and Table S2, ESI†) exhibited a big arc at low frequencies, which corresponded to the interfacial charge carrier transfer from Ta3N5-NRs, whereas the small arc at high frequencies represented the bulk properties like the resistance and depletion capacitance. The arc at low frequency indicated that the interfacial charge transfer resistance for the non-optimised photoanode was 200 Ω, which was double the optimised value of 100 Ω. These results suggest that in the non-optimised photoanode, holes accumulated near the electrolyte/Ta3N5-NR interface, which later partially recombined with electrons around the onset potential. The second arc recorded at higher frequencies demonstrated a low bulk resistance of ∼2.5 Ω for the optimised sample, which was 3.6-times smaller than the non-optimised photoanode value of 8 Ω. It was considered that the optimised photoanode with bigger grain size resulted in a reduction of the resistance across the Ta3N5-NRs, which led to more efficient electron transfer.
In addition, Mott–Schottky analysis, shown in Fig. S25, ESI,† revealed that the flat-band potential of the optimised Ta3N5-NRs shifted cathodically by 0.21 VRHE compared with that of the non-optimised sample. The low resistive nature of the optimised photoanode, which was predicted by simulation results and verified by EIS, was further confirmed by Mott–Schottky analysis by calculating the high electron concentration/doping density in the optimised nanorods to be 4.21 × 1019 cm−3, whereas the non-optimised nanorods exhibited a value of 6.3 × 1018 cm−3.
The fraction of photogenerated holes that does not recombine with the electrons in the bulk and reaches the electrode/electrolyte interface is known as the charge separation efficiency (ηsep). The charge injection efficiency (ηinj) is the yield of the photogenerated holes (present at the electrode/electrolyte interface) injected into the electrolyte to oxidise water. Both the separation and injection efficiencies characterise the bulk and surface recombination process. According to Dotan et al.,50 an independent estimation of ηsep and ηinj is possible by measuring the photoanode photocurrent in an electrolyte that contains hole scavengers (e.g., H2O2). As was expected, the separation efficiency of the optimised Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx photoanode, Fig. S26, ESI,† was much higher than that of the non-optimised photoanode and reached a saturation value of 90% at 1.05 VRHE. Similarly, the injection efficiency for the optimised photoanode also showed a saturation of 80% starting at 0.9 VRHE, which indicated that our optimised photoanode exhibited recombination losses of only 10%, and this value is in good agreement with our theoretical estimation presented in Fig. 4b.
Additionally, we separately measured the J–VRHE characteristics from 0 to 1.3 VRHE for our optimised photoanode at incident angles of 90°, normal incidence, and 45° (Fig. S27, ESI†) to demonstrate the effect of light trapping and absorption on the Ta3N5-NRs. There were very small differences in the photocurrent density at 1.05 VRHE, with values of 9.95 cm−2 mA cm−2 at 90° and 8.4 mA cm−2 at 45°, depending on the incident angle owing to superior light trapping in the high-aspect ratio nanorods. Consequently, the calculated HC-STH values were as high as 2.72% at 90° and 2.25% at 45°. Considering the projection of the daily sun movement, we approximated that our optimised photoanode can provide 2.25% HC-STH starting from 9 AM, will reach the peak of efficiency of 2.72% between 11 AM and 1 PM and then slightly decrease to 2.25% by 3 PM (Fig. S28, ESI†).
It should be noted that this may be a way to reach an STH conversion efficiency of higher than 10%, which is required for practical solar water splitting application. Our best photoanode provides a saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 VRHE, Fig. 2a, and thus the integration of the same nanorods onto a conductive transparent substrate (e.g., Al2O3/GaN, which is stable at the high temperature nitridation condition) may be considered to realise a photoanode with a light absorption edge of ∼600 nm. Hence, the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode is fabricated by the sputtering process in the GLAD regime, thus making this method compatible with a conductive Al2O3/GaN substrate, as we previously demonstrated51 when we fabricated a transparent Ta3N5 thin-film-based photoanode on Al2O3/GaN by the combination of the sputtering and nitridation processes. With all of these considerations, hypothetically, it is possible to realise a STH of ∼12% in a PEC water splitting device in tandem with a simple PV cell with a light absorption edge >600 nm. We hope that the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes proposed here represent a significant step in the research focused on the practical production of solar hydrogen.
5. Conclusions
By optimising the GLAD and nitridation parameters, we fabricated highly efficient polycrystalline Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanodes that consist of aggregated single-crystalline large grain domains. We demonstrated that the large grain domains in a Ta3N5 nanorod improve its conductivity and provide enhanced light harvesting owing to efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers, which leads to a saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 VRHE and delivers a state-of-the-art solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72% (at a photoanode FF ∼ 42%) for single-photon photoanodes. Additionally, stoichiometric O2 and H2, with gas evolution rates of 82.8 and 164.9 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively, were stably produced on the Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanode and Pt counter electrode with faradaic efficiencies near to 96% achieved. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time operating a Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanode at 1.1 VRHE and realise a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA cm−2 under one sun simulated solar light, where it shows good stability for the OER with a continuous retention of 80% for 70 minutes. Our results represent a significant step forward in the realisation of a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of more than 10%, which is required for practical solar hydrogen production.

Broader context
Market commercialization of photocatalytic water splitting requires a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of at least 10%, which depends on properties such as effective solar light absorption, generation and separation of free charge carriers, and carrier transport to the surface for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we show that the efficiency of each process can be separately maximised by polycrystalline Ta3N5-nanorods (Ta3N5-NRs) that consist of aggregated single-crystalline domains. We demonstrate this concept in the fabrication of a highly conductive photoanode that consists of large grain domains, and provides enhanced light harvesting because of the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. This results in a completely saturated photocurrent of 9.95 mA cm−2 at 1.05 V vs. RHE and delivers a state-of-the-art solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.72% (with photoanode fill-factor (FF) = 42%). In addition, we performed a demonstration of operating the Ta3N5-NR/FeNiOx-based photoanode at 1.1 VRHE for the first time and realised a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA cm−2 under one sun conditions, with a continuous retention of 80% for 70 minutes. We hope that the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanodes proposed here represent a significant step in the research focused on the practical production of solar hydrogen.

VRHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + V0Ag/AgCl,
HC-STH (%) = Jp × (1.23 − VRHE) × (100/P),
IPCE (%) = [(1240/λ) × Jp/P] × 100,

(f) Comparison of simulated (Sim. – circle symbol) and experimental (Exp. – line) data of the current potential characteristics of the Ta3N5-NR-based photoanode. The current density at 1.23 VRHE is dictated by optical and recombination losses, whereas the onset potential is limited by the surface reaction rate along with recombination losses.
