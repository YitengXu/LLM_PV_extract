    , Accepted 17th October 2012First published on 19th October 2012AbstractNew thiolate/disulfide redox couples (M−/M2) were introduced and also combined with T−/T2, resulting in more efficient binary redox couples. The binary redox couples, in particular M−/T2, yielded a high energy conversion efficiency and reasonably stable performance with the carbon black counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been investigated intensely as a new electrochemical solar cell to convert solar energy to electricity.1 Many efforts have been made to improve the energy conversion efficiency and long-term stability of DSCs. The I−/I3− redox couple is by far the most common redox couple used in DSCs, affording an energy conversion efficiency of up to 11.0% and 10.3% for ruthenium-based and metal-free organic sensitizers, respectively.2,3 Although the I−/I3− redox couple has reached efficiencies in excess of 11%,4 its disadvantages, such as corrosion of metal-based current collectors, sublimation of iodine, and absorption of visible light, may be problematic for use in practical DSC applications.5
There have been several alternative redox couples reported, including ferrocene/ferrocenium,6 cobalt complexes,7 nickel complexes,8 pseudohalogens, i.e., (SeCN)2/SeCN−, (SCN)2/(SCN−), halogen/pseudo-halogen,9 and organic TEMPO+/TEMPO.10 Recently, CoIII/II complex redox couples were reported to perform with more than 12% efficiency with YD2-o-C8 dye.11 Organic thiolate/disulfide redox couples have been introduced into DSCs by Grätzel and co-workers (called T−/T2),12 and garner special interest because of their negligible corrosion properties in combination with less visible light absorption and an acceptable efficiency.12,13 However, the couple shows a low fill factor12 and lack of long-term stability13 mostly because of the large charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode (Rct).
In this paper, we introduce a new thiolate/disulfide redox couple (M−/M2 in Fig. 1), which is combined with the previously reported one (T−/T2 in Fig. 1), resulting in binary redox couples (M−/T2 and T−/M2). With the aim of reducing the large Rct with the Pt counter electrode14 and improving the stability of DSCs, we adopted a carbon black (CB) counter electrode instead of a Pt counter electrode.15 The CB counter electrode yields an increase in device efficiency with the binary thiolate/disulfide redox couples, mainly resulting from the good catalytic activity of carbon materials for T−/T2.16 We found that the performance using the binary-redox shuttles was improved by the decrease in electron recombination and the fast dye regeneration rate. The improvement in photovoltaic performance is primarily due to the prevention of thiolate ion adsorption on the CB surface.
 Fig. 1  (a) The molecular structures and (b) redox potential of the redox couples (Fig. S4†). 

Fig. 1(a) shows the chemical structures and the redox potential of the redox couples in the electrolyte. We employed T− and M− as sources of thiolate and T2 and M2 as those of disulfide. Although the M species (M− and M2) have a more negative redox potential than T−/T2 and are chemically slow in terms of electron transfer kinetics,17 they have merits with regard to their slow electron recombination rate. In order to take the merits of each redox couple and tune the redox potential, we combined two different thiolates/disulfides (T−/T2, M−/T2, T−/M2 and M−/M2) for use as redox couples in the electrolyte. The electrolyte was composed of 0.4 M disulphide, 0.4 M thiolate and 0.5 M tert-butyl-pyridine (tBP) in γ-butyrolactone (GBL).

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the J–V characteristics of DSCs using the thiolate/disulfide redox couples with N719 dye based on the Pt and CB counter electrodes, respectively. The Pt counter electrode with the T−/M2 showed higher open-circuit voltage (VOC), compared to that with the T−/T2. Furthermore, the M−/T2 showed a higher short circuit current (JSC) and VOC than the T−/T2. However the M−/T2 showed a much lower fill factor (FF) of 0.30, compared to the T−/T2 FF of 0.51 (Table 1). The FF is more adversely affected by the M2 species than the T2. By introducing the CB counter electrode, the FF was significantly increased compared to when the Pt counter electrode was used. Specifically, the FF with the M−/T2 and the T−/M2 was remarkably enhanced compared to that with the T−/T2. As a result of the introduction of the CB counter electrode, the M−/T2-based cell achieved an efficiency (η) of 4.1% compared to an η of 3.1% for the T−/T2-based cell. In these data, JSC of the cell with the Pt counter electrode was higher than that with the CB counter electrode. The difference in the spacer thickness used or the diffusion length may partly contribute to the difference in JSC because the spacer thickness used was 25 μm for the Pt and 60 μm for the CB counter electrodes. The 60 μm thick spacer was used to avoid any possible contact between the rough CB counter- and the photo-electrodes. Clearly, the high efficiency is mainly due to the improvement in the FF, resulting from the use of the CB counter electrode.18 Possible explanations for this enhancement could be the advantages conferred by the high surface area and the high catalytic activity of the CB counter electrode, and the moderate corrosion resistance of the thiolate/disulfide electrolyte.13

The mass-transport limitation of the photocurrent was characterized by measuring the photocurrent transients. Fig. 2(c) shows the decay of photocurrent to on–off irradiation under 1 sun illumination for the disulfide/thiolate electrolyte-based devices with a 6 μm TiO2 layer.19 During the five seconds of light exposure, the photocurrent decay of M−/T2 was much slower than that of the others, suggesting faster dye regeneration rate by the electrolyte containing the M−/T2.
In order to elucidate the effects of two different counter electrodes on the FF, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with the symmetric cells in the dark (Fig. 3(a) and (b)).20 The series resistance (Rs) is the sum of sheet resistance, electrolyte resistivity, and electrical contact of the cells (inset table in Fig. 3(b)).21 Semicircles are clearly observed for the symmetric cells based on both the Pt and CB counter electrodes. These semicircles represent the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode (Rct). Obviously, the Rct value of the CB counter electrode is much smaller than that of the Pt counter electrode based on the thiolate/disulfide redox electrolyte. This implies that the CB counter electrode more efficiently reduces the disulfides than the Pt counter electrode. For the I−/I3− redox couples, the Rct semicircle with the Pt counter electrode is smaller than that with the CB counter electrode.

The inset table shows the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (2Rct) of the symmetric cells. (c) Recombination lifetime (τn) and (d) diffusion coefficient (Dn) with the CB counter electrode from IMVS and IMPS measurement, respectively. 
To investigate the high Rct of the cells based on the thiolate/disulfide electrolyte with the Pt counter electrode, the FT-IR spectra of the Pt counter electrodes were measured and are presented in Fig. S1.† The peak at 1100 cm−1 corresponds to the Pt–S bond formed due to the adsorption of the sulfur ion in thiolate onto the Pt surface.22 The effective surface area of the Pt counter electrode was decreased by the reaction between sulfur and the Pt counter electrode, resulting in a decline in catalytic activity and high Rct. Therefore, the results strongly suggest that the lower thiolate reduction resistance on the CB counter electrode has a high FF, yielding high energy conversion efficiency.
From the photovoltaic perspective, we find that the M−/T2 has a higher photovoltage value than the T−/T2 regardless of the counter electrode, although the redox potential of the T−/T2 is more positive than that of the others (Fig. 1(b)). The VOC is directly related to the potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte, the Fermi level of TiO2 and the recombination process.23Fig. 3(c) shows that the binary redox couples, M−/T2 and T−/M2, have a much longer electron lifetime τn than the T−/T2 redox couple. The electron diffusion coefficients (Dn) of the binary redox couples are located between those of the T−/T2 and M−/M2 (Fig. 3(d)). Dn follows a power law with light intensity as a result of trap filling with electrons generated from the bias light.24 These results illustrate that the binary M−/T2 redox couple with the CB electrode has a higher VOC than T−/T2, which is mostly attributable to the longer electron lifetime.

Fig. 4 shows the long-term stability test results of the devices stored in the dark at room temperature for 1000 hours. The normalized performance parameters were measured under 1 sun illumination for the cells with either a Pt or CB counter electrode. The DSC with the M−/T2 electrolyte based on the CB counter electrode showed rather stable photovoltaic performance over 1000 hours, in contrast to the Pt counter electrode. Notably, the efficiency based on the Pt counter electrode decreased significantly, even after 20 hours of storage. After 1000 hours of storage, the efficiency of the cell with the Pt counter electrode dropped almost 30%, due to the drastic decrease in the FF. The thiolate/disulfide redox couple appeared to be unstable with the Pt counter electrode, due to the adsorption of thiolate on the Pt surface.13

In conclusion, a new thiolate/disulfide redox couple (M−/M2) was introduced, which was then combined with the previously reported redox couple (T−/T2) to make two binary redox couples (M−/T2 and T−/M2). With the CB counter electrode, the energy conversion efficiency of the binary redox couple (M−/T2) was higher than that of the other redox couples. The high efficiency of the binary redox couple is attributable to the increase in both VOC and JSC with the nearly unchanged FF when compared to the T−/T2. The high VOC is closely associated with longer electron lifetime, even though the potential of the binary redox couple was shifted more negatively (upward shift). The increased JSC is primarily due to the faster dye regeneration for the binary redox couple M−/T2. In addition, the CB counter electrode showed much better stability in thiolate/disulfide-based DSCs, compared to the Pt counter electrode. Future work is in progress to increase the conversion efficiency by optimizing the electrolyte composition and the properties of different dyes.
