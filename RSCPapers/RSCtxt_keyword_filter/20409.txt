    , Accepted 27th August 2020First published on 28th August 2020AbstractHole-transport materials (HTMs) have a critical effect on the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). So far, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is commonly used as an HTM for highly efficient PSCs. The HTMs with a spiro framework like spiro-OMeTAD usually show high thermal stability and good film forming capacity. To date, massive efforts have been made to prepare new HTMs with a spiro core structure connecting two electron-donating moieties. However, the harsh synthetic routes and purification processes of the spiro structure are the main challenges for their large-scale applications. To solve this issue, herein, a single aromatic heterocycle pyrazine is used to connect two electron-donating groups for the construction of new HTMs (denoted as 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ), which could be synthesized under mild reaction conditions with high yield (over 60%). Moreover, in terms of molecular structure, the electron-withdrawing property of the pyrazine group could increase the molecular polarity, enhance intermolecular interactions, and thereby promote charge transfer, affording a high hole mobility. Experiments indicate that 2,7-DMPZ film shows a more uniform morphology, better hole transport property, and more efficient charge transfer compared to the 3,6-DMPZ film, endowing the 2,7-DMPZ-based device with an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.61% with enhanced stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the hottest topics in the photovoltaic technology field due to their facile preparation and low-cost.1–3 In the last decade, perovskite has been reported to possess extraordinary merits such as superior light absorption capability,4,5 tunable bandgap (1.50 to 2.30 eV),6 long charge carrier diffusion length (over 0.1 mm),7 and high charge carrier mobility,8,9 which make the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs acquire a drastic increase from 3.8%10 to 25.2%.11 In general, a typical n–i–p type PSC device structure contains a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) photoanode, electron transporting materials (ETMs, n-type semiconductors), perovskite absorber, hole transporting materials (HTMs, p-type semiconductors) and metal electrodes.12–15 The HTM is an essential component for a highly efficient PSC, which plays a significant role in providing efficient hole extraction and transport from the perovskite layer to metal electrodes.16–18 Furthermore, it could prevent the external environment from damaging the perovskite active layer and could improve the stability of the PSC device.19,20 Consequently, tremendous efforts have been made to design and prepare various HTMs for high-performance PSCs.
To date, in n–i–p type PSCs, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the most popular HTM, and the recorded PCEs for PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD were exceeding 20%.21 Spiro-OMeTAD is featured with two rigid π-conjugated systems linked by a sp3-hybridized carbon atom.22,23 The spiro configuration could confer high thermal stability and suppress molecular aggregation, leading to a highly uniform and morphologically stable film.24–26 Consequently, molecules with this kind of structure is an ideal building block for the construction of HTMs. Therefore, much effort has been made to enhance hole transport properties of new HTMs containing a spiro core structure. For example, Grätzel groups27 synthesized an asymmetric spiro-based HTM FDT by introducing fluorene-dithiophene into the spiro structure, and the thiophene–iodine interaction improved the hole transfer at the FDT/perovskite interface, resulting in a promising efficiency of 20.2% in the device. Gao et al.28 reported two di-spiro-based HTMs G1 and G2. Compared with the single-spiro-based HTMs, the di-spiro-based HTMs with a larger π-conjugated system endowed a better π–π stacking in the film, leading to a higher hole mobility. Zhu and co-workers29 have developed two new HTMs, SCZF-5 and SAF-5, by incorporating a carbazole block into the spiro-skeleton to enhance hole-transporting ability. However, the orthogonal structure would suppress molecular interaction which might hinder the intermolecular charge transfer and result in a low hole mobility.24 In particular, the complexity in synthesizing and purifying spiro-based compounds, which usually involves a low-temperature reaction (−78 °C) with a highly active reagent butyllithium, is still the main problem.26,27,30 To address these questions, in this work, we try to use a “single aromatic heterocycle” instead of a “single carbon atom” to construct the twisted molecular structure, and two HTMs, 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ, were designed and synthesized under mild reaction conditions of Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction with a high yield (over 60%) (Fig. 1). In these two molecules, the pyrazine core structure was modified with 3,6-carbazole-diphenylamine and 2,7-carbazole-diphenylamine as the peripheral groups, respectively. Pyrazine works as a structural linkage; on one hand, it could expand the conjugation of the whole molecule compared to a single C atom, and on the other hand, its electron-withdrawing property will increase the molecular polarity and enhance intermolecular interactions, thus facilitating charge transfer. Moreover, the synthetic routes for 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ are simpler than that of the spiro structure. As expected, 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ demonstrated excellent thermal stability and film-forming ability. The diphenylamine groups were modified on different positions on a carbazole moiety, and as a result, 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ show distinct distorted molecular configuration, electronic property, and energy levels due to different steric hindrance and electron-donating effects. 2,7-DMPZ exhibits a more uniform and smoother film morphology, and a higher hole mobility than 3,6-DMPZ. Encouragingly, the device utilizing 2,7-DMPZ as the HTM exhibits a promising PCE reaching 19.61%. In contrast, the device based on 3,6-DMPZ HTM shows a lower PCE of 17.09%. Notably, 2,7-DMPZ as HTM is superior to the state-of-the-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD, which shows an inferior PCE of 18.65%. It turns out that the strategy of replacing a C atom by a single aromatic heterocycle is feasible in building “3D” type HTMs with twisted molecular structures.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structure of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ. The optimal molecular geometry of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ (Fig. S7, ESI†) was calculated using density functional calculations (DFT) carried out at the B3LYP/def2SVP level with Grimme's D3BJ empirical dispersion correction using the Gaussian 09 program. The results show greatly distorted 3D-shaped structural conformations for both molecules.31 The synthetic procedures of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ, and the experimental details are given in the ESI.† 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ were synthesized using the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction of 2,5-dibromopyrazine with N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (compound 1) and N2,N2,N7,N7-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diamine (compound 2), respectively.32 The corresponding structure characterization details of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and the high-resolution MALDI-TOF spectra are provided in the ESI.†
The photophysical properties of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ were studied using Ultraviolet–Visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in dilute dichloromethane solution (Fig. 2a). It can be noted that 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ exhibit two major absorption bands ranging from 280 nm to 500 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption bands of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ around 280–400 nm are caused by the π–π* transition. Intriguingly, 3,6-DMPZ shows wider absorption with extra shoulder peaks around 430 nm in comparison with 2,7-DMPZ. It might be attributed to the more effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the carbazole rings to the pyrazine ring of the 3,6-DMPZ molecule than 2,7-DMPZ because the dimethoxydiphenylamine groups in 3,6-DMPZ offered a stronger electron-donating ability of than those in 2,7-DMPZ. Moreover, the two 2,7-carbazole-diphenylamine groups of 2,7-DMPZ show more steric hindrance, making the carbazole rings more twisted out of the pyrazine ring plane than 3,6-DMPZ, which hinders the effective ICT from the carbazole rings to pyrazine ring and narrows its absorption in the visible region. The energy bandgap (Eg) of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ was calculated to be 2.30 eV and 2.46 eV from the UV-vis absorption (Fig. S8, ESI†) onset wavelength (λonset) of their films based on the equation Eg = 1240/λonset.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ was recorded in a CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the electrolyte (Fig. S9, ESI†). Both 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ display the reversible oxidative and reductive processes. Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are obtained from the onset of their first oxidation peak versus Fc/Fc+. As shown in Fig. 2b, the HOMO levels of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ were calculated to be −5.23 eV and −5.18 eV, respectively. They are sufficiently positive to the valence band of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, −5.43 eV) used in this work, suggesting that 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ are capable to extract holes from the perovskite. Moreover, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ were estimated to be −2.93 eV and −2.72 eV, respectively, according to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg. These LUMO levels are significantly higher than the conduction band of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, −3.93 eV), which could block the electron transfer from perovskite to the Ag counter electrode.
The thermal properties of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†). In TGA experiments, 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ show the same high thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of 505 °C with a weight loss of 5% under a N2 atmosphere, which is one of the highest values reported for HTMs.33 This clearly demonstrates that they have outstanding thermal stability due to their rigid aromatic structure. From DSC measurements, it was found that 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ exhibit high glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 169 °C and 132 °C, respectively, indicating that 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ have superior stability in the amorphous state. These values are higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (126 °C),34 which is attributed to the improved molecular interaction and packing.35 Besides, the high Tg values of both 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ are advantageous to form a uniform thin film and enhance the film morphological stability during device operation.24,36–38
To confirm the film-formation capability of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ, the morphology of the HTM film spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 3a and b). As shown in Fig. 3a, films based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ show a homogeneous surface and full coverage on the perovskite layer. In contrast, the HTM 2,7-DMPZ exhibits a more uniform surface with fewer voids, which could lead to effective charge transport at the interface. Moreover, the AFM images revealed that 2,7-DMPZ exhibited a smooth and uniform film with a small root-mean-square (RMS) value of 10.7 nm, while 3,6-DMPZ HTM showed a rougher surface morphology with a RMS value of 11.6 nm (Fig. 3b). The poor uniformity of the HTM 3,6-DMPZ layer may be due to its relatively lower solubility (around 35 mg mL−1) compared to 2,7-DMPZ (over 60 mg mL−1).39,40 These results indicate that 2,7-DMPZ HTM could endow an effective ohmic contact between the perovskite layer and the metal electrode, thus reducing charge-carrier losses and enhancing charge transfer at the interface, which are conducive for the effective performance of the device.41,42 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S11, ESI†) were conducted, and no obvious crystallographic peak was observed, confirming the amorphous phase of the 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ films.43,44

The hole transporting properties of the two HTM films with dopants were further explored using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. 3c). The hole mobilities of the 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ films were determined to be 3.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of the 2,7-DMPZ film was found to be over two times higher than that of 3,6-DMPZ.
To fully evaluate the role of 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ as HTMs on the photovoltaic performance of the device, n–i–p PSCs with ITO/compact TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Ag architecture were fabricated as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b depicts the cross-sectional SEM image of the device configuration in which a clear boundary between individual layers is observed. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices with 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ measured at 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) are displayed in Fig. 4c and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The 2,7-DMPZ-based device achieved an encouraging PCE of 19.61% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.61 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.80, which is remarkably higher than the control PSC using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM (18.65%) (Fig. S12, ESI†). In contrast, the device based on 3,6-DMPZ yields a much lower PCE (17.09%), with a low Jsc of 21.59 mA cm−2 and Voc of 1.01 V. The Jsc of the 2,7-DMPZ-based device is much higher than that of 3,6-DMPZ because of its smoother surface morphology and higher hole mobility. The enhanced Voc value of the 2,7-DMPZ-based device may result from the more effective carrier transfer and less nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/2,7-DMPZ interface.40 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured for PSCs based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ (Fig. 4d), in which both the devices showed a high response from 400 nm to 750 nm. The integrated current densities calculated from the EQE spectra are 20.62 mA cm−2 and 21.56 mA cm−2 for 3,6-DMPZ- and 2,7-DMPZ-based devices, respectively. The results agree with the Jsc values determined from the J–V measurements. Moreover, electrical hysteresis of the devices based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ was studied by forward and reverse scanning of J–V curves (Fig. 5a and Table S1, ESI†). Interestingly, the PSCs with 2,7-DMPZ show negligible hysteresis with a little hysteresis index (HI) of 0.04 compared to 3,6-DMPZ-based PSCs (0.08). This superior hole transport property results in a smaller hysteresis for 2,7-DMPZ-based devices than PSCs based on 3,6-DMPZ. To verify the photovoltaic performance obtained from the J–V curves, the steady-state photocurrent density and PCE output at the maximum power point of the 3,6-DMPZ- and 2,7-DMPZ-based devices were tested within 200 seconds (Fig. 5b). The devices based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ both have a stable output with PCE values of 16.57% and 19.22%, and Jsc values of 19.27 mA cm−2 and 20.45 mA cm−2, respectively. They are in line with the results obtained from the J–V curves. Besides, from statistical analysis based on 20 devices (Fig. 5c), the devices based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ both exhibit a narrow distribution of PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF. This shows that these devices have good reproducibility. The durability of the 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ based PSCs was also investigated in a N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the device with 2,7-DMPZ maintains over 85% of its initial PCE over 30 days, while that of the 3,6-DMPZ-based PSC is less than 80%, highlighting the better stability of the 2,7-DMPZ-based PSC. Inferior stability of the 3,6-DMPZ-based PSC is likely because the 3,6-DMPZ film contains more voids which might facilitate ion migration and drastically destroy the device stability.

To better understand the reasons for the different photovoltaic performance exhibited by the PSC devices based on 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ, the hole extraction capability of two HTMs, the charge-transport kinetics and the charge recombination dynamics in PSCs were systematically studied using steady-state photoluminescence (PL), transient photocurrent (TPC) decay and transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measurements, respectively. From the PL experiment (Fig. 6a), it is clear that the bare perovskite film showed a strong PL signal and the PL intensity decreased dramatically after the HTM was deposited on it. Obviously, a more significant PL quenching was observed with the perovskite/2,7-DMPZ than with the perovskite/3,6-DMPZ bilayer, which indicates that the 2,7-DMPZ film has a stronger hole extraction capability at the interface between 2,7-DMPZ and the perovskite layer. The TPC measurement (Fig. 6b) indicates that the photocurrent decay of the 2,7-DMPZ-based device is faster than that of the 3,6-DMPZ-based device. It is revealed that the 2,7-DMPZ-based device has a much faster charge transfer which contributes to a high Jsc. This is because 2,7-DMPZ has a larger hole mobility and more excellent hole extraction ability. As illustrated in the TPV measurement curves (Fig. 6c), the photovoltage decay of the PSC based on 2,7-DMPZ is much slower than that of 3,6-DMPZ, suggesting a longer carrier diffusion length and less trap-assisted carrier recombination under the open-circuit conditions of 2,7-DMPZ based PSC.24,45 These results were further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. 6d). From EIS analysis, the series resistances (Rs) of 2,7-DMPZ- and 3,6-DMPZ-based PSCs are 17.93 Ω and 23.61 Ω, respectively. The lower Rs of the 2,7-DMPZ-based device suggests a faster hole transport process. The Nyquist plots suggest that the device based on 2,7-DMPZ showed a larger recombination resistance (Rrec) than the 3,6-DMPZ-based device, which helps to suppress the charge recombination and promotes carrier spatial separation and diffusion. As a result, the 2,7-DMPZ-based PSC obtained a higher Voc.46 Clearly, the more uniform morphology, more efficient hole extraction and hole transporting property, and less carrier recombination endow 2,7-DMPZ-based PSC with a higher PCE with a smaller hysteresis compared to the 3,6-DMPZ-based PSC.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two new compounds (3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ) were developed and successfully applied as HTMs in PSCs. 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ exhibit twisted molecular structures, which are composed of pyrazine as the core structure, and 3,6-carbazole-diphenylamine and 2,7-carbazole-diphenylamine as the peripheral groups, respectively. As a result, different molecular configurations make 3,6-DMPZ and 2,7-DMPZ show distinctions in energy levels, electronic properties, film-forming ability, and hole transport properties. In contrast, 2,7-DMPZ shows higher hole mobility, smoother film morphology, stronger hole extraction and transport ability, and less charge recombination compared to its counterpart. All these superior properties of 2,7-DMPZ led to a higher value of Jsc, Voc and FF for 2,7-DMPZ-based devices. As a result, a remarkable PCE of 19.61% was achieved for the 2,7-DMPZ-based devices.
