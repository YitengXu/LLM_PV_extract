1. Introduction
Developing renewable energy technologies with both portability and high energy-conversion and storage efficiencies, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and metal–air batteries, to mitigate the depletion of fossil fuels is significant to fulfil the requirement of a sustainable way of life.1–3 However, practical applications are still constrained by the sluggish kinetics and large overpotentials of the foundation electrochemical reactions in these energy-conversion devices, such as oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER).4,5 Therefore, it is highly imperative to develop competent electrocatalysts, as the use of efficient and robust electrocatalytic materials can effectively boost the aforementioned energy-conversion reactions.
Nanomaterials present unique merits such as great control of surface chemistry, short ion diffusion length, and abundant accessible active sites, which are highly desirable for advanced clean energy conversion processes.1,6–8 Substantial synthetic, methodological, and technological progress in nanostructured materials has been made over recent decades.6–8 Nanostructures have been synthesized and employed as electrocatalysts for the vast research field of the abovementioned energy electrocatalysis due to their infinite variety of structural motifs and intriguing properties, displaying superb activity compared with traditional catalysts.1,9–11 The science of nanoscale electrocatalysts is becoming firmer, more widely accepted, and is acquiring a new perspective in energy electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the preparation processes of many reported electrocatalysts with excellent performances usually involve undesired chemical by-products/derivatives and still have difficulty switching to mass-production.12 Among all technologies for nanomaterial fabrication, magnetron sputtering as a green and relatively low-cost technique presents great potential in large-scale application owing to its special superiorities such as high-quality products, admirable repeatability, extreme conciseness, and quick preparation process. As a physical vapor deposition technology, magnetron sputtering with an extra magnetic field deposits various thin-film materials on all kinds of substrates at relativity high speeds and low operating temperatures regardless of the melting temperature of the sputtered targets.13–15 In addition, such a solution-free method possesses the characteristics of low toxicity, ease of operation, and most importantly, environmental friendliness, which are well-suited to tackle challenges that we face in the rational design and synthesis of competent electrocatalysts.16–18 The fabrication of electrocatalytic nanostructures based on magnetron sputtering is thus quite attractive and offers a number of advantages: (i) green fabrication processes basically without toxic/flammable raw materials, hazardous liquids/gases or noxious by-products; (ii) high purity, (iii) high density and good uniformity, (iv) excellent adhesion strength, (v) favourable corrosion resistance, and (vi) freestanding features (no binders and additives, no need for post-treatment, high loading of active components, etc.) for the sputtered materials; (vii) great control of stoichiometry and film thickness; and (viii) rich target sources such as metals, semiconductors, and even organic compounds. At present, a few review papers have discussed the applications of magnetron sputtering and sputtered materials despite the apparent merits of magnetron sputtering (high-quality materials, pollution-free growth, low operating temperature, etc.).19,20 In particular, comprehensive reviews that exclusively focus on the application of magnetron-sputtered electrocatalysts for various energy-conversion reactions have been neglected. Moreover, regarding the structure and chemistry points of view, there is an extensively growing interest in using magnetron-sputtered materials as electrocatalysts for energy-conversion applications. Accordingly, it is timely and necessary to present updates on recent advances in developing the family of sputtered materials for innovative energy-conversion processes.
This article intends to provide an overview of important advances in magnetron-sputtered materials as prospective electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage, with a focus on materials design, green synthesis, and catalytic performance. After a brief introduction of the magnetron sputtering technology's basic principles, a review is presented on representative sputtered electrocatalysts separately for ORR, OER, HER, and so forth. Table 1 summarizes the latest literature for comparison. Following this part, how sputtered nanomaterials can serve as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts in energy devices is discussed as well. Meanwhile, a framework for rationalizing electrocatalyst design and reflecting current research trends is described. Finally, open challenges and other critical future directions are outlined.

2. Magnetron sputtering and its applications
2.1 Principles of magnetron sputtering
As one of the widely-used physical vapour deposition technologies, the magnetron sputtering technique has become the most effective method to prepare a wide range of thin film materials. With this technique, all kinds of catalytic materials can be easily prepared (Fig. 1a).21–23 As shown in Fig. 1b, the setup for magnetron sputtering consists of the following parts: an electric field (power supply), a target plate (cathode), a substrate, a vacuum chamber and a nonreactive gas (usually Ar).24 When a magnetic field is applied near the target area, the gas introduced into the vacuum chamber will become ionized Ar atoms to bombard the target, thus releasing the molecules/atoms that form thin coatings on the substrate.25 In addition, according to the power supply for the target, current magnetron sputtering can be classified into three groups: direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS), radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) and pulsed magnetron sputtering including medium frequency (MF) pulsed sputtering and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS).26 To date, more advanced versions of magnetron sputtering like magnetron sputtering with a glancing angle deposition technique (GLAD) for well-ordered nanostructure production and plasma-enhanced magnetron sputtering (PEMS) have also emerged, thus enabling magnetron sputtering to become more versatile.27,28

(c) A brief summary of the development of the history. (d) Quantity of SCI articles based on magnetron sputtering (the keywords used for a search in the Web of Science were “magnetron sputtering” and “electrochemical”). (e) Green synthesis enabled by magnetron sputtering and the wide range of sputtered materials. 
The first description of sputtering in gas discharges was reported by Grove in the mid-19th century.29 In the 1930s, Penning proposed an additional magnetic field in a sputtering system, extending the lifetime of the electrons in the target (cathode) vicinity,30 which was further explored by Kay and Gill.31,32 However, it was the 1970s before magnetron sputtering reached industrial application (Fig. 1c).33 To date, a wide range of thin films deposited on various types of substrate (such as carbon paper, silicon wafer and stainless steel) via magnetron sputtering have been applied in energy electrocatalysis, and the quantity of such research articles has taken an upward trend since the 2000s (Fig. 1d). In addition, magnetron sputtering has gradually achieved full automation, entered the industrial production stage, and is widely used in manufacturing in various industries.
The structure and properties of magnetron-sputtered films can be influenced by many factors. (i) The sputtering parameters, such as the sputtering power, working gas composition, pressure, flow rate, substrate temperature, rotation speed of the substrate, and target-to-substrate distance, are determinants of the properties of sputtered films. The sputtering power, which has a significant influence on the target ionization ratio and deposition rate, is a critical factor to enhance film/substrate adhesion and the density of the film.34 If the power is too high, a detrimental influence on the quality of films can be induced by over-high-energy ions, while poor adhesion will appear at low sputtering power. As for gas composition and pressure, at lower pressures, the increase in pressure will lead to both the rise of Ar ion number and the deposition rate. Furthermore, high-substrate temperatures are required to synthesize highly crystalline and homogeneous films, and also to increase adhesion between the film and substrate.35,36 Another factor is the rotation speed of the substrate: the substrate will need to maintain a certain rotation speed to optimize the uniformity and quality of the deposited materials.34,37 Finally, to ensure a full extension and uniform deposition of molecules/atoms, a relatively long distance between the target and substrate is required; however, too long a distance will lead to lower deposition rates. (ii) Initial target materials, like composite film, can introduce more phases and improve the bond strength. (iii) Other influencing factors, like the post-annealing treatment of the as-sputtered films, can further improve their crystallinity. Moreover, a pre-sputtering process is usually performed prior to sputtering to remove impurities and contamination from the target material.38,39 Notably, even small changes of the abovementioned parameters, such as the rotation speed of the substrate, during the deposition process alter the resulting catalytic properties. Thus, it is possible to maximize the performance of the sputtered material through a fine-tuning of sputtering parameters and it is also important to make sure the parameters are accurate and consistent for each experiment in order to ensure high-quality and reproducible sputtered structures at the same time.
2.2 Thin film preparation via magnetron sputtering
As aforementioned, the different parameters empower magnetron sputtering to freely produce nanomaterials endowed with the desired chemical compositions, structures, and properties. Note that this technique allows for the quick synthesis of the following compounds at relativity low temperatures with almost no pollution (Fig. 1e), which usually requires harsh conditions or redundant fabrication processes. (1) Pure metals: the most commonly used and easily prepared sputtered materials are pure metals, which are prepared by single-target magnetron sputtering that tailors the chemical and physical properties through parameter optimization with only one target. As an example, in order to precisely control the shape of the nanoparticles grown by magnetron sputtering, Zhao et al.40 studied the growth mechanism of iron nanoparticles and found that a cubic shape can be obtained under certain combinations of the deposition rate and temperature (Fig. 2a). In addition, discrete and well-defined copper nanocups were sputter-deposited by a template-assisted magnetron sputtering process (Fig. 2b).41 (2) Alloys: similar to the preparation of pure metals, alloys like CuMoTaWV42 and Zn1−xAgxSb43 can also be easily sputter-deposited with the corresponding alloying target via single-target sputtering (especially when the targets are homogenous and of the desired composition). Moreover, sputtered alloys with synergies and interactions present superior performances compared with pure metals. For instance, a near-ideal strength up to 3.3 GPa was obtained by using Mg65Cu25Y10 alloy as a sputtering target, through a deposition process with an argon pressure of 0.2 Pa and substrate temperature at 150 °C, to form amorphous/nanocrystalline dual-phase magnesium alloys.44 Dual-target co-sputtering, in which the sputtering system contains two targets, has also been developed to fabricate alloys with particular compositions. For instance, TiAu alloy layers featuring compositional gradients (Au concentration gradients) were synthesized via the co-sputtering method, and these could be further converted into site-selectively Au-decorated TiO2 nanotubes by anodization (Fig. 2c).45 In addition, co-sputtering deposition was also employed to prepare Ir–Ni–Ta–(B) metallic glasses with both a high glass transition temperature and a wide supercooled liquid region, which reached a strength of 3.7 GP at 1000 K.46 (3) Chalcogenides: the growth of Nb2O5 porous thin films by DCMS using a metallic Nb target under an Ar/O2 atmosphere was reported (Fig. 2d)47 The oxidation of Ag films by reactive sputtering deposition of NiO to form hierarchically porous AgO nanorods was also reported (Fig. 2e).48 Moreover, three-dimensional (3D) structured LiFePO4 thin films were also reported (Fig. 2f).49 Recently, a dense and homogeneous ZnO layer (nearly 200 nm) was constructed to serve as a multifunctional interphase between the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 and Li metal in lithium metal batteries via magnetron sputtering, which improved the interface contact and stability simultaneously.18 Metal sulfides like CuS nanopillars were prepared via RFMS (Fig. 2g).50 Moreover, atomically thin MoO3 films with tunable layer numbers were prepared by RFMS, which could be converted to large-area and continuous MoS2 atomic layers through a post-sulfurization process.51 Selenides like SnSe thin films can also be easily grown by single-target magnetron sputtering.52 High-quality Cu2ZnSnSe4 films were sputtered-deposited from a quaternary Cu–Zn–Sn–Se target.53 (4) Phosphides: Fe–P(–Mn) thin films were grown on oxidized Si wafers using magnetron sputtering.54 (5) Carbides: high photocurrent densities and photovoltages were obtained by growing conformal Mo2C films on amorphous silicon photoabsorbers by magnetron sputtering to serve as a photocathode for solar hydrogen production.16 (6) Nitrides: with a target-to-substrate distance of 100 mm, CrN thin films were deposited by using reactive DCMS under N2 reactive gas and a DC power of 250 W from a metallic Cr target (Fig. 2h).55 (7) Non-metal: silicon-doped amorphous carbon was prepared via co-sputter deposition of a silicon target and four graphite targets.56 A nitrogen-incorporated amorphous carbon thin film was also prepared via DCMS using a N2/Ar gas mixture.57 (8) Composites or heterostructures: for instance, Wu's group utilized polystyrene as a template to fabricate Si/Ge core–shell nanoarrays58 (Fig. 2i) and cap-shaped Ag-decorated ZnO hollow nanosphere arrays59 (Fig. 2j). Furthermore, 3D multilayered Cu@Mg@C nanowires60 were also prepared by alternating sputtering of Mg and C on a Cu current collector (Fig. 2k). By magnetron sputtering of Co onto stainless steel mesh, followed by annealing and dealloying processes, Co(OH)2 nanosheets were prepared, which could be further converted into core–shell Sb@Co(OH)2via sputtering Sb onto the Co(OH)2 substrate.61 More examples of thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering are shown in Table 1.

3. Applications in electrochemical half-reactions
Energy electrocatalysis via the assistance of a green energy supply is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable ways of energy storage and conversion. As such, nearly all kinds of energy half-reaction based on numerous catalytically active materials have been extensively explored for our pursuit of a green future society. Fig. 3 presents the typical steady state polarization curves for many types of half-reaction (can be divided into oxidation and reduction reactions) and their main products. Nonetheless, such electrocatalysis processes are still not economically feasible as the efficiencies are limited by the sluggish reaction kinetics, leading to large overpotentials and poor selectivity. Thus, the main challenges in this field lie in the fine design of electrocatalysts. Magnetron sputtering technology as a sustainable/green, relativity low-cost and quick option offers precise control of the catalysts’ chemistry and structural stability by depositing disparate elements with a final stoichiometry matching that of the target.62 By adopting various substrates with specific morphologies like nanodots, nanofibers, or nanoarrays, sputtered materials with the desired morphologies as well as high catalytic activities can be obtained.60,63,64 The diversity of available sputtering targets also opens doors for screening advanced electrocatalysts. Moreover, with nanoscale thickness, sputtered thin films possess tuneable active-site density, accessibility, and compositional adaptability, making them highly competitive electrocatalysts. To date, magnetron-sputtered nanostructures have driven substantial progress in the field of electrocatalysis.
 Fig. 3  Various types of energy half-reactions and the main products (including reactions that have not yet been reported to be catalyzed by sputtered materials such as two-electron WOR). 
In this section, we discuss design strategies of electrocatalysts toward a wide range of energy-conversion processes (i.e. ORR, OER, HER, carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CRR), alcohol oxidation reactions (AOR), and other half-reactions) based on magnetron sputtering technology, and grant insights into the advantages of utilizing such a sputtering approach to improve the corresponding catalytic properties. A number of rational designs that are capable of boosting the electrocatalytic efficiency are presented with an emphasis on the activity, selectivity, and stability.
3.1. Oxygen reduction reaction
The cathode ORR as the heart of energy systems (like fuel cell and metal–air batteries) generates two typical products, H2O with the four-electron (4e−) process and H2O2 with the 2e− process.65–67 This raises the question of product selectivity. The 4e− process with fast kinetics is important for applications of energy devices like proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and metal–air batteries.68 In contrast, the H2O2 product generated by the 2e− process is a potent and green oxidant for a vast range of industrial applications, such as wastewater treatment, textile bleaching and medical disinfection, as it enjoys a rich content of active oxygen (47.1% w/w) and only water as the by-product.69–71 Moreover, since the 2e− oxygen reduction pathway has been less studied until the last five years or so,69–71 all of the reported sputtered catalysts in this section are basically 4e− ORR catalysts. Therefore, efficient electrocatalysts with tailored selectivity (4e− process for fuel cell/battery applications or 2e− process to generate H2O2) and a low overpotential of ORR (both 4e− and 2e− processes) are highly desired. In fact, due to the advantages of magnetron-sputtering fabrication processes, sputtered electrocatalysts for 2e− ORR are expected in the coming years.

3.1.1 Noble metal-based electrocatalysts. 
In the past few decades, platinum-based nanostructures synthesized via magnetron sputtering have been widely reported as ORR electrocatalysts.72–78 These sputtered Pt-containing electrodes features high process control and good scalability, showing great potential for fuel cell applications. Generally, a high sputtering pressure is beneficial for ORR efficiency as well as the catalyst utilization of sputtered Pt films by tailoring the surface structure and crystal orientation.79 Moreover, both the particle size of pure Pt sputtered layers and their electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR were found to be increased with sputtering deposition temperature in Sievers's work.80 And they also sputter-deposited an amorphous carbon interlayer onto glassy carbon (GC) for Pt deposition to form Pt/C sputtered layers, which shared the same electrochemical behaviour as pure Pt sputtered layers. Yet, the activity of the Pt/C layers was inferior to the pure Pt layers in direct contact with glassy carbon due to the high electrical resistance of the amorphous carbon. Thus, it is effective to optimize the deposition temperature to positively affect the ORR activity of Pt-based electrodes. Also, it is important to avoid introducing carbon into such a form since the layer-by-layer repeated coating reduces the utilization of magnetron-sputtered active materials. In Fu's work, how to make proper use of magnetron sputtering to prepare catalysts was exemplified by sputtering Pt nanoparticles (3 nm) onto a monodisperse carbon sphere (50 nm) layer, resulting in a novel carbon sphere-supported Pt catalyst, which exhibited a greatly enhanced specific surface area of Pt and a preferred Pt(111) orientation, giving rise to a superior rated power density performance to commercial Pt/C with the same Pt loading in fuel cell tests.81 Deng et al.82 demonstrated a hard-template strategy to construct ordered Pt nanotube arrays as promising electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications based on a hydrothermally prepared ZnO array and sputtered Pt. These synthetic strategies can effectively maximize the specific surface area of active materials with boosted activity. Generally, the development of electrocatalysts with both an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and specific activity is one of the finest approaches for application and commercialization, which has important practical significance. In a recent study, a nanoporous Pt–CoO composite structure was successfully synthesized by magnetron sputtering, in which the Co is mainly distributed in the interior and the Pt is mainly distributed on the outer surface (Fig. 4a and b).83 The Pt–CoO catalyst had a suitable core–shell structure and a porous structure that is conducive to the mass transfer process of the reaction. It also displayed good stability and required less Pt. The XAS characterization results showed that Pt underwent partial oxidation in the Pt–CoO structure, and Co existed in the CoO state. No alloying between Pt–Co can be observed and a small amount of CoO may be distributed on the surface of the Pt. Besides, the CoO in the Pt–CoO composite structure inhibited the Pt dissolution during the electrocatalytic reaction. Compared with other state-of-the-art Pt-containing electrodes, the Pt–CoO nanostructure displayed both ultrahigh specific activity and ECSA, giving rise to greatly improved mass activity (Fig. 4c and d). In addition, the magnetron sputtering technique also affords the ability to grow Pt nanolayers with a controlled thickness on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which revealed improved electrocatalytic activity for the typical 4e− ORR.84,85 Despite the promising electrocatalytic activities of Pt/CNTs, such structures experience high rates of corrosion during service in PEMFC. Much effort has been devoted to addressing this issue. In Zhang's study, NbO2 films were sputter-deposited onto a CNT array by RFMS from a niobium target in mixed Ar/O2 plasma as a support for Pt deposition.86 The modification of the CNT array with a sub-nanometre NbO2 layer was demonstrated to provide effective protection from electrode corrosion. Consequently, the Pt/NbO2/CNT catalysts enjoyed a much higher electrochemical area and specific activity compared with their Pt/CNTs counterparts. In another reference, magnetron sputtering was used for the fabrication of ORR catalysts comprising Pt-alloy nanoparticles uniformly falling onto a NbOx/carbon nanoparticle support (2 < x < 2.5).87 The incorporation of NbOx functional layers significantly boosted the durability and mass activity of the resultant Pt/NbOx/C electrode via Pt–O interactions and a strain effect, demonstrating an effective approach for engineering Pt-based catalysts on an oxides/carbon substrate. Note that the sputtered NbO2 showed good conductive properties while it essentially preserved the ORR activity of the deposited Pt. Meantime, the insertion of the NbO2 layer significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of the composite catalyst due to its excellent wetting with graphene as well as Pt. Similarly, a Ag/TiO2/MWCNTs electrode was prepared via a magnetron sputtering technique, and it possessed superior ORR activity and durability compared with the commercial Pt/C electrode.88

PtxMy binary alloys (M = Ru,89 Ir,90 Fe,91,92 Ni,93 Co,93,94 Ta,95etc.) with synergistic effects of the alloyed components have been prepared by magnetron sputtering as ORR catalysts. In Johnson's work, magnetron sputtering coupled with inert gas aggregation was utilized to fabricate PtRu nanoparticles on glassy carbon for ORR, which exhibited pronounced O2 reduction peaks in acidic electrolytes.89 In Li's work, a Ag/Pt-coated polyethylene structure was formed by sequential deposition of 40 nm Ag and 10 nm Pt by magnetron sputtering.96 The Ag/Pt electrode with a mass loading of 0.07 mg cm−2 exhibited a high mass activity of 142.8 mA mg−2 at 10 mA cm−2 and a geometric current density of 250 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V. Similarly, mesoporous Pt catalysts were constructed by Sievers et al.97 by sequential sputtering deposition of thin Pt and Co layers, followed by dissolution of the Co templet during cell conditioning. As a result, both the RDE kinetic current and the mass specific current in half-cell tests were significantly increased (16-fold increase and 7-fold increase, respectively) for the optimal Pt–Co configuration (Pt thickness of 30.5 nm) with optimal gas diffusion. In 2019, Sievers et al.98 further proposed an unsupported Pt–Cu electrocatalyst by applying an electrochemical leaching procedure to heterogeneous Pt–Cu templates (from 95 to 99.5 at% Cu) that were prepared by alternating sputtering from Cu and Pt targets. Notably, it was found that the higher initial copper content, lower remaining Cu content in the Pt–Cu networks, and the remaining Cu content as well as edges and defects jointly boosted the specific activity of the PtxCuy nanostructure to 5.8 mA cmPt−2. Ordered Pt–M intermetallic compounds with a unique electronic structure have obvious advantages over chemically disordered structures, and the magnetron sputtering technique can easily develop ordered Pt–M intermetallic catalysts. For instance, by varying growth temperatures and deposition rates, both disordered and ordered Pt–Co films were grown on a MgO substrate as electrodes toward ORR.99 A 7-fold enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for the ordered Pt–Co films was obtained, and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the d-bandwidth of the ordered one was much smaller than the disordered one. In addition, PEMFCs comprising a Pt-doped CeOx anode and a Pt50Co50 cathode were also made exclusively of magnetron-sputtered thin film catalysts.100 Despite excellent performances of these thin film catalysts, prevention of platinum oxidation in harsh conditions, such as automotive startup/shutdown mode, remains to be studied.101 Lately, co-sputtering with different powers to the Pt and Ni targets with a fixed deposition time (to obtain identical thickness) was conducted to investigate the influence of the PtxNi100−x alloy composition on its ORR performance.102 Owing to the alloy formation and the so-called Pt-skeleton induced by Ni leaching, the specific power of the prepared Pt25Ni75 electrode was 10 times higher than that of commercial Pt catalyst when serving as a cathode in fuel cells. Furthermore, constructing nanostructured thin films (NSTF) that feature organic molecular solid catalyst support particles and polycrystalline thin films through magnetron sputtering is another strategy towards the enrichment of active sites.103 Instead of depositing nanoparticles onto nanocarbon supports, Pt–Ni alloy films were grown onto the NSTF layer of oriented organic pigment whiskers via a facile magnetron sputtering method to form a Pt–Ni NSTF catalyst, followed by a 400 °C annealing treatment under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere to evaporate the inner whiskers and form a Pt-skin surface. As a result, the mesostructured PtNi thin film (PtNi Meso-TF) with crystalline features and larger exposed active surface areas can be obtained (Fig. 4e).104 The resultant PtNi Meso-TF displayed an improved affinity for ORR with a more than 20-fold enhancement of activity vs. Pt/C due to the increased presence of the ideal Pt3Ni(111) facets and stable Pt-skin structure (Fig. 4f). In addition to the greatly enhanced performance, this seeding study also has implications for further research, for instance, how to further ensure the mechanical strength and stability of the PtNi Meso-TF, as the pure organic support in NSTF or Meso-TF will evaporate after thermal treatment. Besides, since these substrates are not an electron conductor, the electron conduction for ORR process can only be achieved by reducing the thickness and the active sites of Pt-based films, which is a question for further exploration. It is well known that in Pt-containing electrodes, Pt plays a less useful role if it is wrapped in the interior of the catalyst. In order to maximize the surface Pt amount in the Pt–Ni alloys, Myers's group directly constructed vertically aligned Pt–Ni thin films on Ni nanorods (Pt–Ni/Ni) by utilizing magnetron sputtering in GLAD and SAD geometries.105 The resultant Pt3Ni7/Ni electrode showed enhanced mass- and area-specific activities relative to those of the higher-Pt content Pt–Ni/Ni catalysts. Note that the ORR performance of the Pt3Ni7/Ni electrode also exceeded the performance of magnetron-sputtered Pt–Ni alloy nanorods, which was reported by Myers's group as well.106 In general, alloying Pt with the abovementioned metals, such as Ni, can lead to a modulated surface structure and thereby improve the ORR activity.4,107,108 In addition to transition metals, alloying Pt with rare-earth metals, such as yttrium, was also reported to further enhance their ORR activities.109–112 In 2017, Pt3Y with a thickness of 3 nm was prepared by single target co-sputtering from a Pt target where clips of Y foil were placed on its surface (a foil-based target), exhibiting an enhancement in mass activity by a factor of 11, relative to Pt nanoparticles.113 Of note, the high activity of Pt3Y was derived from the surface reconstruction of the Pt3Y alloy during the electrochemical operation where a strained Pt overlayer was formed on the surface of the alloy. Inspired by this, Brown et al.114 provided a more complete profile of the Pt3Y catalyst by sputtering of a Pt3Y single target to form Pt3Y films, and investigated the overlayer chemistry and structure before and after acid treatment. It was found that Y was oxidized to stoichiometric Y2O3 and substoichiometric oxides (Pt3Y-O) at the surface of the Pt3Y, and such an oxide layer cannot be completely removed with acid treatment. Moreover, the overlayer thickness can strongly influence the overall ORR performance of Pt3Y films since a thicker overlayer means less strain in the overlayer, resulting in a drop in ORR activity, while a thinner overlayer can bring severe leaching, causing catalyst stability issues. Importantly, despite many crystal defects and microstrains throughout the sputtered Pt3Y films, they revealed a very high activity, highlighting Pt3Y as a promising catalyst for fuel cell systems. In addition to binary alloys, a number of reports have dealt with multimetallic systems that were prepared via magnetron sputtering for ORR. As an example, Tan et al.115 prepared sputtered Pt–Au–Co alloy and the level of specific activity for ORR established on the optimal Pt–Au–Co alloy (Pt 2.5 atom %, Au 25 atom %) thin-film catalysts exceeded the value for identically synthesized Pt–Co and pure Pt, respectively.
Palladium belongs to the same periodic table group as Pt, and also possesses moderate ORR activity.116 In 2013, Oishi and Savadogo investigated the ORR activity of a set of sputtered PdCo alloys with varied Co compositions, where the best ORR performance was achieved at Pd65Co35 due to optimal d band properties.117 Generally, for Pt- and Pd-based alloys, the electrochemical performances are linked with the component and thickness of the outer noble metal shell. In Yang's work, a de-alloyed Pd–Cu thin film with a core–shell structure showed a 2-fold activity enhancement compared with pure Pd due to the limited strain and weak ligand effect caused by the thick Pd overlayer (1.5 nm).118 Also, PdCu thin films with a stable ordered structure were prepared via a co-sputtering technique, which exhibited superior ORR activity and durability up to 100000 cycles (Fig. 4g and h).119 The performances might be attributed to the lattice contraction and weakened oxygen adsorption energy on the Pd lattice caused by the incorporation of Cu. Besides, the thin Pd-rich shell (0.6–0.8 nm) on the surface of PdCu can mitigate possible Cu leaching, thus enhancing the durability of the Cu component in alkaline media. Such a combinatorial strategy shows the effectiveness of co-sputtering as an optimized high-throughput screening method for alloy electrocatalysts with well-defined compositions and structures. In Li's work, Pd–Au–Ag–Ti thin films were prepared by a magnetron co-sputtering system, which exhibited a low overpotential and high current density in alkaline media.120 In addition to Pd-based alloys, dispersion of Pd onto a carbon support via magnetron sputtering has also been reported. The early demonstrations of dispersion of Pd nanoparticles on MWCNTs by magnetron sputtering were carried out by Ye et al.121 and Jukk et al.122 It has been determined that, on the Pd/MWCNT composites, the ORR proceeded via a 4e− pathway in both alkaline and acid media, and showed moderate activity and fine stability. In addition, the structure design of Pd-containing electrocatalysts is essential for boosting ORR performances. As an example, electrospun polymer fibers were deposited on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite to serve as a template first, followed by sputter-deposition of Pd thin films and heating treatment at 320 °C under an Ar atmosphere to remove the fiber cores and obtain the Pd nanoshells.123 The resultant Pd nanoshells with an increased electroactive surface area presented a much higher ORR activity than the Pd thin film counterparts that share similar thickness and geometric area. This work suggests that by using the sputtering and electrospinning techniques in a tandem configuration, catalysts with an enlarged electroactive surface area can be synthesized.


3.1.2 Nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts. 
In the past few decades, nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts have been found to be catalytically active for the ORR, demonstrating great potential to replace the expensive platinum-based catalysts used in fuel cells. For instance, both Co–C–N and Fe–C–N films (with and without boron doping) to serve as ORR electrocatalysts have been prepared via sputtering deposition in early studies.124–126 In Xu's work, three different Fe–N–C catalysts were also prepared using RFMS with graphite and iron as the targets and an Ar/N2 gas mixture as the working gas.127 The Fe–N–C films that were processed at high temperatures displayed superior ORR activity compared with the Fe–N–C counterparts deposited at room temperature owing to the enhanced graphitization degree and hydrogenated nitrogen species. In addition to Co and Fe, Cu also acts as a robust ORR catalyst owing to its moderate electrocatalytic activity, electronic conductivity, and stability.128 A good example was demonstrated by Shao et al.129 in 2017, where the Cu nanoparticles were encapsulated in graphitic carbon nanoshells via magnetron co-sputtering of copper and graphite targets in N2/Ar gases with controlled deposition temperatures from 250 to 750 °C, forming a series of core–shell structured Cu–C–N films (Fig. 5a). When deposited at 650 °C, the Cu–C–N achieved excellent 4e− ORR performance with a Tafel slope of ∼63 mV dec−1, a half-wave potential (E1/2) of −0.24 V and an onset potential (Eonset) of −0.06 V, owing to the appropriate thickness of the carbon nanoshells and the synergistic effect between such shells and the Cu nanoparticles. And Cu incorporation can facilitate the electronic interactions with ORR adsorbates in such core–shell structures. As can be seen from this case magnetron sputtering as a high-quality deposition method can play an even greater role in developing these advanced electrocatalysts. This technology can be utilized in combination with others, which will further increase catalyst performances in future research.

In general, the reported magnetron-sputtered M–N–C materials mentioned above showed 4e− ORR activity rather than activity toward 2e− ORR to H2O2. And the 2e− reduction pathways over such materials have been less studied until the last five years or so.69–71 As an example, Strasser's group130 developed a series of M–N–C materials comprising exclusively M–Nx moieties (metal atoms in the carbon matrix are coordinated with nitrogen atoms in the form of metal cations) and studied the 2e− ORR performance of these M–N–C catalysts. The activity and selectivity toward the 2e− ORR were found to be determined by the nature of the metal cation center in the catalytically active M–Nx moieties. The Co–N–C showed the highest ORR selectivity of up to 80% toward H2O2 production, among all the prepared samples (Fe–N–C (28%), Cu–N–C (36%), Mn–N–C (43%), N–C (45%), Ni–N–C (52%)). DFT calculations revealed that the Co–N–C binds the ORR intermediates most effectively, making it a superior H2O producer. In fact, there has been a debate on the reaction mechanism for ORR (a 2e− or 4e− pathway) regarding the Co–N4 structure.131,132 Therefore, more research work on regulating the catalytic activity and selectivity in atomic precision (a 2e− or 4e− pathway) is expected in this field.
Another promising material class in ORR is high-entropy alloys,120 such multi-metallic catalysts, which can provide easy access to different elemental compositions, making it possible to control the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity via the suitable selection of element combinations and compositions. However, it is difficult to prepare high-entropy alloys through conventional wet-chemistry synthesis.133 Remarkably, Schuhmann's group demonstrated the fine-tuning of the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal-free Cr–Mn–Fe–Co–Ni high-entropy alloys by means of combinatorial co-sputtering into an ionic liquid (Fig. 5b).134 The intrinsic catalytic activity towards ORR can be significantly improved by increasing the Mn content from 19% to 60% in the quinary alloy system while maintaining the proportions of Cr–Fe–Co–Ni constant (Fig. 5c). Note that all the resultant Cr–Mn–Fe–Co–Ni alloys yielded promising ORR activities that were comparable to that of Pt, and all the quaternary alloys were of inferior activity, implying that massive novel active sites were formed in the quinary high-entropy alloy system. Schumann's work suggests that it is promising to develop novel electrocatalytically active systems like an unlimited number of multinary alloys targeting the replacement of Pt-based electrodes by using magnetron sputtering technology.
Apart from M–C–N (M = transition metals) catalysts and high-entropy alloys, sputtered metal oxides films and their hybrids such as ZnO layers,135 ZrO2−x films,136 Pt–CeOx thin films,137 and Pt/SnO2 thin films138 have also been reported as OER catalysts, producing attractive activities. In 2010, the influence of RF power (75–175 W) on the ORR catalytic properties of the ZrO2−x films were investigated.136 The crystallinity of ZrO2−x was found to be positively proportional to the RF power, and the ZrO2−x deposited at 175 W displayed improved ORR kinetics, indicating that higher crystallinity might promote the oxygen adsorption process over the surface of the oxides. Furthermore, Pt/SnO2 thin films were prepared by DCMS, where the Pt on SnO2 films revealed different ORR activities depending on the surface properties of the SnO2.138 The activity of Pt supported on partially reduced SnO2 film with no preferential orientation was doubled compared with the activity of Pt on fully oxidized SnO2, indicating a strong surface-dependent support–metal interaction. The adsorption strength of OH on the Pt surface of Pt/oxidized SnO2 became so intense that it led to the formation of an irreversible Pt oxide layer.139 Moreover, engineering the crystallinity and electronic structure of the Pt in oxide hybrid systems is another approach to advance catalyst design. In Meng's work, the Pt layer was atomically and electronically coupled with CoO nanorods by magnetron sputtering and subsequent annealing, which featured boosted activity and durability toward ORR as compared with the Pt benchmark.140 The enhancement was attributed to the atomically matched interface, desired Pt faceting and down-shifting d-band center of the Pt. In another reference, GLAD-deposited niobium oxides were further sputter-deposited with Pt layers, forming nanostructured metal oxide hybrid catalysts featuring optimized Pt distribution on columnar oxides supports.141 Thin film solid oxide fuel cells (TF-SOFCs) featuring low-temperature operation are a promising candidate for power generation and energy conversion, yet they usually involve limited cathode performance and cell scalability issues, impeding the practical applications. In Lee's work, a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O2.95-Y/Zr metal alloy (LSCF-YSZ) porous cathode with a columnar nanostructure was prepared by co-sputtering (Fig. 5d), and other components including an electrolyte, anode and interlayer were also sputtered-deposited to construct an all-sputtered TF-SOFC (Fig. 5e), which displayed a high peak power density around 1.7 W cm−2.142 Lee et al. demonstrated that fuel cell devices can be prepared entirely using a single sputtering process and a single piece of sputtering equipment, which is beneficial for the cost-effective mass production of devices in the future.
With tunable electronic structures and molecular configurations at the atomic scale, nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials have been proved to be an effective metal-free ORR electrocatalyst.143,144 Using DCMS with a graphite disk target under a varied mixture flow of CH4/N2, Zhang et al.145 prepared N-doped amorphous carbon films as an ORR catalyst, where the generated pyridinic N was found to catalyze ORR. However, several issues such as the specific roles of different nitrogen moieties (i.e. graphitic N (NG) and pyridinic N (NP) sites) in the ORR are still not fully understood. In this regard, Colavita's group studied the N-site chemistry in three carbons of similar nitrogen/carbon content ratios that differed in N-site composition (a-C:N 900 with almost 100% NG, a-C NH3 700 consisting of almost 100% NP, and a-C NH3 900 with a nearly 1:1 NG:NP concentration), which were obtained by an annealing treatment of sputtered amorphous carbon film precursors.146 The NG:NP composition was found to strongly influence the O2 reduction selectivity, where only a-C NH3 900 featuring a 1:1 NG:NP composition showed a predominantly four-electron pathway for O2 reduction. Also, a-C:N 900 displayed the lowest values of limiting current density and the lowest value of electron transfer numbers close to 2 (Fig. 5f and g), implying that the two-electron reduction from O2 to H2O2 became the predominant pathway. Moreover, models of graphene clusters with exclusive NG (2NG-Gr), exclusive Np (2Np-Gr), and equal NG and Np sites (NGNp-Gr) were built to discuss the effect of the composition of N-sites on the ORR activity and selectivity at the atomic scale. Interestingly, ORR intermediates showed neither too weak nor too strong adsorption energies on both of the NG-rich and Np-rich surfaces, whereas the coexistence of Ng and Ng sites in similar proportions demonstrated a better stability of the intermediates, giving rise to the predominantly four-electron pathway. The significant ring currents and lower number of electrons of a-C:N 900 and a-C NH3 700 can thus be assigned to the poor stability of intermediates according to DFT analysis (Fig. 5h).
It can be seen from the above discussion that alloys and their composites can serve as efficient electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction catalysis. In particular, the synthesis and application of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have gathered wide research attention in recent years.133,134 As aforementioned, such multi-metallic materials (consisting of five or more principal elements) have infinite possible combinations and thus provide easy access to different elemental compositions, making it possible to have control over the intrinsic catalytic activity.133 But it is difficult to prepare HEAs through conventional wet-chemistry synthesis.133 Xin et al.147 and Li et al.148 systematically discussed the synthetic methods for HEAs. Some methods for preparing HEAs show inherent disadvantages. For instance, carbonthermal shock synthesis is only suitable for carbon support.147 Mechanical allying and solvothermal synthesis provide unsatisfactory size uniformity and a low surface area of catalysts, leading to low selectivity149 (size-dependent local geometric structure) and low activity (less exposure of active sites). Besides, mechanical allying also shows low substrate applicability, and solvothermal synthesis also suffers from low productivity and element applicability.150,151 In addition, other methods such as the dealloying method, fast-moving bed pyrolysis (FMBP) and casting-cum-cryo-milling are efficient strategies to fabricate HEAs. But these three methods all suffer from low element applicability, high cost and low substrate applicability (except for FMBP). And FMBP also presents relatively low productivity.147 In contrast, magnetron sputtering has the best performance in nearly all aspects such as size uniformity, surface area, and element applicability. As aforementioned, Schuhmann's group even demonstrated the sputtering of different atoms into ionic liquid to form high-efficiency ORR catalysts.134 However, the operation of magnetron sputtering requires a vacuum environment, which makes its cost still relatively high.147 Note that mechanical allying and casting-cum-cryo-milling are available for large-scale synthesis of HEAs, but such methods all have other disadvantages.147 Therefore, attention should be paid to improvement in these aspects, as industrial production of HEAs requires efficient, reliable and inexpensive preparation processes.
Moreover, we should again highlight a recent work reported by Sievers et al.,83 in which a novel self-support Pt–CoO network requiring no carbon support was designed as a superior ORR electrocatalyst. A glassy carbon disc electrode and gas diffusion layer as the substrate, and a porous network were prepared by alternating magnetron sputtering of Co and Pt layers followed by acid leaching of non-noble metal CoO components. The excellent specific activity of the Pt–CoO catalyst developed in their study is not at the cost of reducing ECSA. This study also shows that the combination of high specific activity and high ECSA can result in an extremely high mass activity in sputtered nanocatalysts for ORR. Importantly, the strategies proposed by Sievers et al. to improve the dispersion and specific activity of sputtered nanocatalysts should be industrially scalable and can be applied to all surfaces such as gas diffusion layers or membranes.

3.2. Oxygen evolution reaction
As the ORR's reverse reaction, the OER is another key oxygen electrochemistry reaction in renewable energy technologies (Fig. 3), yet the sluggish kinetics limits the commercialization of current devices.152 Different from ORR, the OER is an anodic process that usually becomes visible to the unaided eye during anodizing at relatively high potentials. Thus, one of the most studied catalyst groups for OER is oxides. The most well-known OER catalysts are RuO2 and IrO2, which are regarded as the benchmark OER catalysts due to their supreme OER activity. In 2015, Paoli et al.153 investigated the OER activity and corrosion rate of RuO2 electrocatalysts that were prepared by thermal oxidization of sputtered Ru nanoparticles under acid conditions. The high degree of control over particle size allowed for an accurate estimate of the performances where the activity maximum of the resultant RuO2 was identified at a particle size of 3–5 nm. The RuO2 also exhibited a mass activity of 0.6 A mg−1 and a turnover frequency of 0.65 s−1 at 0.25 V overpotential. Furthermore, both thermally oxidized Ru (t-RuO2) and plasma-treated Ru (p-RuO2) were also reported by Paoli et al.,154 where the former is the most stable yet least active one, and the p-RuO2 had higher activity than t-RuO2 and enhanced stability in comparison with as-sputtered Ru nanoparticles. Paoli's studies suggest that the activity and stability of some widely investigated catalysts like Ru can be improved with a high degree of control over particle size and proper post-treatments. In addition, it was found that fine-tuning of the near-surface composition of Ru and Ir elements in a sputtered Ru–Ir system by surface segregation can optimize the balance between the activity and stability toward OER.155 By selective leaching of sputtered IrxCoy films, Jensen et al.156 recently reported a dramatically enhanced OER mass activity and stability for a nanoporous IrOx network. A mass activity around 817 A gIr−1 can be achieved in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution, which was more than 8 times that achieved by the commercial Ir-black nanoparticles. The increased electrochemically active surface area was confirmed as the main attributor for the enhanced OER performance.
Electrocatalysts based on precious metals like Ru and Ir present excellent OER performances, yet their scarcity necessitates the design of other low-cost electrode materials. Gorlin et al.157 demonstrated that adding trace amounts of Au to sputtered MnOx can significantly enhance the OER activity of pure MnOx because of local interaction between Au and MnOx. Li and co-workers158 prepared co-sputtered Ni–Fe oxide films for OER, which displayed an η2 of 329 mV (much lower than those of as-sputtered FeOx and NiOx). Li et al.96 showed NiFeOx supported on sputtered Au as electrocatalysts for OER, which yielded an η10 of 190 mV and a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1. Moreover, the presence of Cr (10–30 at%) in co-sputtered Ni1−y−zFeyCrzOx electrocatalysts was found to boost the OER activity.159 Similarly, Sn-doped Fe2O3 (0–12 at%) was also prepared by low-temperature sputtering without altering the morphology and crystal phase.160 The tin-doping effects on the OER performance were investigated, where a 60 mV overpotential decrease and a halved Tafel slope were obtained for the 6.2 at% Sn-doped Fe2O3 sample. In another work, both CoOx and CoxSiyOz nanowires were sputter-deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate to study their OER performance. The inclusion of Si within CoxSiyOz was found to improve the overall mechanical stability without impairing the catalytic response.161 Self-standing nanowires with a large surface area and open space can not only improve the catalyst's utilization but also eliminate the need for additive components. However, the substrate's electronegativity was found to influence the OER activity of CoOx, where the precious metal Au outperforms other substrates due to its high electronegativity. In this regard, a CuO nanowire array was co-sputtered with Co and Fe targets to form core–shell self-standing heterogeneous nanowires comprising an outer CoFeOx and the inner CuO.162 Based on the control of the electronegativity of the substrate (from Cu to CuO) and the synergies between Cu, Co and Fe, the resultant CuO@CoFeOx nanowires displayed an enhanced OER performance with an η10 of 0.36 V over 300 h without noticeable degradation. Using RFMS from Ni, Fe, and Co targets under Ar/O2 gases, Inamdar et al.163 reported NiFeCo oxide film supported in stainless steel for OER electrocatalysis. The trimetallic electrode displayed an overpotential of 280 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 32.25 mV dec−1. In a similar fashion, Kim et al.164 demonstrated that FeOOH/CuCo2S4 films prepared by magnetron sputtering of an FeO ultrafine coating onto CuCo2S4/Ni foam substrate can serve as OER catalysts with an η10 of 240 mV and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1. In developing perovskite oxide catalysts for OER, Chen and co-workers165 reported the preparation of sputtered Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) on a surface-oxidized nickel substrate (Ni) as an OER catalyst with higher mass activity than that of the benchmark IrO2 in 2017. It was found that the nickel oxide of the Ni substrate can tune the oxidation state of the transition metal cations (cobalt and iron) in the BSCF, giving rise to enhanced OER activity. What's more, the electronic configuration can be further optimized by adjusting the BSCF's thickness, allowing control of the intrinsic OER activity and stability. Consequently, low Tafel slope (65 mV dec−1) and long durability (10000 cycles) were achieved by 10 nm and 20 nm BSCF-Ni heterostructures, respectively. Water-splitting tests based on the BSCF-Ni (38.7 mg cm−2) as the anode and sputtered Pt–Ni as the cathode also displayed a small overpotential. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) featuring large surface-to-bulk ratios as well as controllable layered structure adjustment have attracted increased attention for the OER since 2013,166 although it is still difficult to precisely control the structure of LDHs, and yield LDH electrocatalysts on a large scale. Besides, conventional preparation methods usually involve binder-assisted coating procedures, leading to compromised electron and charge transfer ability.167 In this regard, a novel and efficient route was proposed to prepare defect-rich LDHs. CoGa LDH on stainless steel (CoGa LDH/SSM), prepared via a sputtering–painting–alloying–dealloying process (Fig. 6a and b), displayed high OER activity (η10 of 258 mV), favourable kinetics (34.1 mV dec−1) and outstanding stability with an almost invariable overpotential after 70 h long-term testing in 1 M KOH (Fig. 6c–f).168 The improved OER performance was ascribed to the following aspects: (i) the presence of CoO6−x units featuring abundant oxygen vacancies induced high electron transfer conductivity and facilitated the adsorption reaction of hydroxyl (OH); (ii) the low activation energy barrier of CoGa LDH/SSM boosted the catalytic activity; and (iii) the self-supported nature made CoGa LDH/SSM free of any binders. Luo et al.169 obtained LDH-ZnO heterostructures by implementing magnetron sputtering to coat a NiFe-LDH/Ni foam support with uniformly distributed ZnO nanoparticles. Both DFT calculations and quasi-real-time Raman spectra showed that the plasma sputtering treatment of NiFe-LDH can synchronously create defects and heterostructures, giving rise to promising OER performances (η10 of 210 mV, 57 mV dec−1) and stability. Recently, Cr-leached multimetal (oxy)hydroxides were synthesized from FeCoCrNi alloy films that were prepared via a magnetron sputtering method after surface reconstruction.170 The formation of Ni4+ and a Fe–Ni dual-site in the prepared (FeCoCrNi)OOH jointly boosted the OER activity and lowered the overpotential (Fig. 6g and h), showing the effectiveness of engineering highly oxidized metal species in multimetal-based electrocatalysts. Amorphous films with disordered atomic structures have also been researched as potential OER catalysts. Lian et al.171 prepared compositionally variant, amorphous Fe–Co–P–C films via a co-sputtering process and found that their electrocatalytic activities and stabilities were improved with increases in Co content, where an η10 of 310 mV and a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec−1 were obtained for the Fe20Co60P13C7 sample, suggesting that the amorphous films had a close bond with the substrate and thus offered an effective adsorption and diffusion platform.

From the above discussion, one can see that transition metal-based oxides/hydroxides are among the most active catalysts for OER in alkaline media. However, in addition to Ir-based and Ru-based oxides,172–174 other transition metal-based oxides (such as Ni, Co, and Fe) are not very stable in an acidic environment. In fact, perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts are relatively stable in acid media.175 However, the preparation of perovskite oxides generally involves high-temperature annealing above 600 °C, leading to limited low surface areas and less exposure to active sites.176 This gives us a hint to circumvent the usual annealing step, and magnetron sputtering may be a good solution for fabricating such perovskite oxide nanostructures for OER, since magnetron sputtering is not only carried out at lower temperatures but can avoid the generation of hazardous substances. In addition, some metal oxides with electrocatalytic power toward OER that may be stable in acid media, such as MoWO6,177 can also be prepared by magnetron sputtering in future research.
3.3. Hydrogen evolution reaction
Hydrogen as the cleanest fuel can be produced by water-splitting processes, which involve protons produced via OER on the anode and electrons at the cathode electrode surface (HER). Since the most effective catalysts for the 2e− HER process (2H+ + 2e− → H2) are precious metals, especially Pt-based materials, robust and low-price HER electrocatalysts are still currently required.
Generally, the active sites, conductivity, and free energy for H* adsorption of a catalyst can influence the HER activity. Wu et al.178 utilized magnetron sputtering to grow Ni films on nanoporous Si, which displayed a much higher HER activity in comparison with Ni-coated planar Si due to its increased active sites and better solid–liquid interface. Zhang et al.179 demonstrated the fabrication of Ni–Mo alloy nanorod arrays by a co-sputtering method. The ordered array geometry not only maximized the active sites’ utilization but also allowed in-time leaving of as-formed H2, giving rise to enhanced catalytic activity. Typically, the thin films or coatings obtained by magnetron sputtering share a similar grain size, roughness and crystal structure over a wide range of compositions, which makes it possible to accurately examine the effect of different components on the electrocatalytic properties. In another reference, Ni–W coatings with varying compositions were prepared by DCMS, which reached the highest HER activity with a W content ranging from 15 to 19 at%.180 However, the exact mechanism to explain the effect of synergism in the Ni–Mo, or Ni–W electrode on the improved HER kinetics is still needed. In addition, Zhu et al.181 utilized magnetron co-sputtering to produce an intermetallic Pt2Si/Ti plate electrode with an ordered lattice structure, which displayed a low η40 and Tafel slope (78 mV, 30.5 mV dec−1) due to the enhanced surface reactivity of the Pt component and promoted breaking of HO–H bonds stemming from the Si component.
With a Pt-like hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH), MoS2 is a widely studied chalcogenide to catalyze the HER.182 Generally, MoS2 films that are prepared via magnetron sputtering are characterized by their high purity, quick fabrication and good reproducibility features, which distinguish them from counterparts prepared by other synthetic techniques.183–185 In addition, different deposition conditions can be customized to give different microstructures and crystalline states to the MoS2 films.186 In 2015, amorphous MoS2 nanosheet arrays were prepared via magnetron sputtering, exhibiting an η10 of 226 mV and a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.187 Despite the good catalytic activity of amorphous MoS2, its catalytic mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this regard, Xi et al.36 recently deposited MoSx layers (thickness of 350 to 450 nm) on an F:SnO2 (FTO) substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering from a molybdenum target (100 W DC output power) in a mixed Ar/H2S working gas under different deposition temperatures. Notably, the crystallinity of the sputtered MoSx layers was found to increase with the substrate temperature. Also, the amorphous MoSx deposited at room temperature experienced a structural transformation changing from an amorphous polymer chain structure consisting of Mo3S13 and Mo3S12 entities to MoS2-like nanoislands during electrochemical cycling, and revealed much lower η10 and Tafel slope (180 mV, 40 mV dec−1) values than that of 2H-MoS2 deposited at 500 °C. Nevertheless, using H2S as a working gas for the preparation of sulfides by magnetron sputtering can contaminate the environment, whether for large-scale industrial production or lab-scale experiments.188 Thus, argon should be the better choice.
In general, the HER kinetics of a catalyst is related to the type and number of active sites it possesses, so the identification of the corresponding contributions of different active sites is thus essential to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.189–191 Based on a MoS2 target and a fixed sputtering power of 275 W in Ar plasma, Xu and co-workers192 synthesised porous and orderly 2H-MoS2 platelet films on the carbon fiber substrate with controllable thickness by lengthening the deposition time from 40 s to 100 min. The electrocatalytic activities of various active sites of MoS2 were evaluated by tailoring the mono-/di-/tri-types of active site in each film, where the activity of the stepped-termination surface (sS) was the lowest. The resultant MoS2 columnar films deposited with 100 min exhibited the optimal η10 and Tafel slope (204 mV, 40 mV dec−1) among all the samples. Note that the exposed active edge of sheets and terraces on the basal planes were found to possess higher electrocatalytic activity than the sS active sites. Using a simple variation in the thickness of MoS2, Xu and co-workers not only designed different types of active site but studied the electrocatalytic activity of the different types of active site. This work also offers a novel strategy to investigate the electrocatalytic activities of various active sites in the electrocatalysts.
Furthermore, the sulphur content of the MoSx nanocluster plays a critical role in its hydrogen electrocatalysis.193 In another reference, (MoSx)1000 nanoclusters prepared by sputtering and condensation processes were found to display remarkable improvements in their HER performances after sulphur-enriching treatment. Patel et al.194 found that the increase of sputtered film thickness (300 nm to 1 mm) can result in enhanced HER efficiency because a larger density of active edge sites and a porous upper layer can be obtained for a better adsorption of H+ ions on MoS2. As is well documented, in addition to reducing the size of the MoS2, inducting the heterogeneous growth of MoS2 crystals, and activating the inert basal plane, the density of active sites also can be increased by switching the semiconductive 2H phase to the metallic 1T phase MoS2. Gao et al.37 employed magnetron sputtering to prepare 3D flower-like MoS2 grown on candle soot with Ni foam as a supporter, which achieved an η10 of 56 mV and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec−1 in alkaline media (Fig. 7a and b). The HER efficiency was attributed to the formation of a metallic 1T phase that was caused by the bombardment of Ar ions and the super-hydrophilic feature of the prepared sample. Also, note that a 1T–2H phase mixed and defective MoS2 can be obtained via the facile sputtering method. In addition to the deposition of MoS2 onto flat substrates, modifying irregular carbon nanopowder with MoS2 (MoS2/C) by magnetron sputtering from a MoS2 target to enhance the surface contact areas was also reported.195 Interestingly, the sputtering time (7.5 to 120 min) was found to manipulate the chemical composition of the sputtered materials (Mo4+ to Mo6+ and associated S anions), where 45 min (the highest composition of MoS2) resulted in an optimal HER performance.

Generally, heteroatom doping of MoS2 is a proven approach to further boost the HER activity. In 2016, Ni-doped MoS2 nanoclusters were prepared via magnetron sputtering and gas condensation process, and the HER enhancement was attributed to the increase in active edge site density derived from Ni-doping of the initially inactive S-edge sites.196 Similarly, Humphrey et al.197 demonstrated a controlled preparation of cobalt-doped MoS2 clusters via the same process and studied the effect of Co doping of MoS2 on the HER activity. In contrast to the Ni-doping effects, it was found that Co poisoned HER-active defects in the basal plane, and its high dopant mobility exacerbated this situation (Fig. 7c). The contrasting results revealed that the HER performance of heteroatom-doped MoS2 is highly sensitive to the sample's nature; thus modifying active sites in MoS2 through appropriate dopant choice and thorough consideration of dopant–vacancy interactions is important. In another reference, a set of Ni3B4-doped MoS2 with different Ni3B4 doping amounts were synthesized by RF magnetron co-sputtering from Ni3B4 and MoS2 targets.198 The component Ni3B4 was controlled by the applied power from 10 to 30 W where the best performance (102 mV, 93 mV dec−1) was achieved at 10 W. It was found that the incorporation of Ni3B4 can not only create more defects but also improve the wettability at a relatively low doping amount. In addition to MoS2, a MoSe2/graphite composite was also prepared through salinization of sputtered Mo film on a graphite surface, which produced an η10 of 125.8 mV and a Tafel slope of 52.1 mV dec−1 in acidic solution.199 In detail, the vertical aligned MoSe2 nanosheets and the rough surface of graphite contributed to the exposure of active sites and further improved the HER activity. This work provides us with a method for the mass production of MoSe2 nanofilms grown onto carbon substrates.
Similar to MoS2 and MoSe2, W-based chalcogenides are promising alternatives to drive the HER as well. According to Wu et al.,200 a better HER performance can be achieved by preparing defective WS2 since the HER activity of WS2 dominantly stems from the edge sites with rich defects. In Wu's work, W films were grown onto different substrates by magnetron sputtering, and then reacted with sulfur to produce vertically aligned 2H-WS2. Further hydrogen treatment was applied to the as-prepared 2H-WS2 to produce highly defective WS0.44 with more active sites, which revealed a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1 and reasonable stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. WSe2 also presents unique properties suitable for electrocatalysis applications. By using a WSe2 target under an Ar atmosphere, Cho et al.34 prepared WSe2 nanofilms by controlling the RF power and deposition time at room temperature. In detail, when the sputtering power and time increased, the loading amount increased and the electrochemical surface area decreased. The optimal η10 and Tafel slope (220 mV, 126.3 mV dec−1) were observed in the 200 W 15 min sample. Note that such a facile room-temperature sputtering method can be easily expanded to other 2D TMD target materials, promising potentially practical electrocatalysts toward HER. Furthermore, WSe2 nanofilms can also be prepared by depositing W nanofilms (about 10 nm) onto the graphite substrate via direct-current magnetron sputtering and then followed by a salinization process at 600 °C.201 The resultant WSe2 nanofilms exhibited reasonable η10 and Tafel slope values (189 mV, 72 mV dec−1). This work also studied the N2 pressures as a critical factor that influences the HER performance of WSe2. In another work, ternary MoS2(1−x)Se2x and WS2(1−x)Se2x alloys were deposited on FTO substrate by sputtering, sulfurization, and further post-annealing in a selenium environment. The MoS2(1−x)Se2x exhibited an η10 of 141 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1, surpassing the WS2(1−x)Se2x alloys prepared with same procedures (167 mV, 107 mV dec−1), pure MoS2, and pure WS2.202 Recently, FTO/WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures as HER catalysts were also constructed via a solution bath and radio-frequency sputtering.203 The interacting interfaces significantly improved the HER kinetics, giving rise to a low η10 and a small Tafel slope (116 mV, 76 mV dec−1) with good stability (continuous H2 production for 20 h).
More recently, Yao et al.204 reported the sputtering method to deposit a WC layer on Cu nanowire arrays (Cu@WC) without further calcination. The nanowire-like morphology of Cu@WC and ultrathin nature of the WC layer (nearly 10 nm) are depicted in Fig. 7d and e, respectively. It is interesting to point out that this core–shell catalyst has several advantages. (i) The core–shell structure was verified to increase the carrier density of WC, and the strongly delocalised interfacial electrons (Fig. 7f) can thus accelerate the electron transfer at the interface of the core–shell structure under the external electric potential. (ii) The matched work functions (WFs) between Cu and WC (ΔWF of only 0.12 eV) provided the high level of Pt-like electrons in WC. (iii) The lattice mismatch between WC and Cu can weaken the hydrogen bonds during absorption. Accordingly, Cu@WC provided significantly enhanced activities compared with other transition metal-based HER electrocatalysts (Fig. 7g). Moreover, carbides like NbC and Ta–Hf–C with good electrocatalytic response towards HER electrocatalysis have been reported.205,206 And we have also seen nitrides such as MoxN, Ni2N, and MoVN as HER electrocatalysts in recent years.207–209
As can be seen from the above discussion, transition metal sulfides and selenides, such as MoS2, WS2, and MoSe2, exhibit excellent catalytic capability for HER. However, these materials are still far from reaching the full potential. Several aspects should be paid attention to in future research. For instance, facile fabrication of the targeted phase or the combination of different phases to boost HER kinetics is highly desired. Besides, tailoring the heterostructures can create more low-coordinated active sites and boost electron transfer, which should help to attain higher activity. Moreover, since Te has the lowest electronegativity compared with O, S, and Se,7 it is expected that sputtered metal tellurides with optimized electron states/transmittability are more attractive HER electrocatalysts.
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are one of the hot spots in the field of HER catalysis.210–212 Facile, effective, and sustainable synthetic routes of such materials are therefore indispensable for broadening the applications. Here, we compare some typical methods for preparing TMDs in the hope that new insights and directions in this field can be reflected. (i) An exfoliation method (solvent-, stabilizer/dispersant-assisted) using bulk TMD crystals is a classic and convenient way for 2D TMD fabrication. Lithium intercalation is a well-known exfoliation method with a high-yield production of single-layered sheets. But this method is time-consuming with an inferior exfoliating effect.213–215 More unfortunately, this method requires an inert synthetic environment and involves organolithium sources and organic solvents like hexanes, which causes low sustainability and makes this method doubtful.215 Although other insertion methods have been reported, most of them still contain ungreen intercalating agents and/or residues. (ii) Hydro- and solvothermal synthetic strategies as typical wet-chemical methods can also fabricate 2D TMDs but suffer from rigid reaction conditions.216–219 Note that the solvothermal method with additional organic solvents also produces unwanted wastes. (iii) Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): one of the CVD technique's advantages is that it produces high-quality TMD nanomaterials with an ultrahigh level of control. However, this process is also carried out at high temperatures, and nanostructures may not be stable at such high temperatures. Also, we should note that the fabrication of TMDs via CVD processes involves the use (S, Se, or Te powder) and generation of toxic/hazardous substances. (iv) Hot-injection method: this method allows for the synthesis of monodisperse colloidal 2D TMDs, but is still conducted at relatively high temperatures and it is not easy to remove surfactants involved, thus limiting its large-scale production.220 In contrast to the abovementioned synthetic methods, the physical sputtering strategy provides a facile and sustainable method to directly synthesize TMD nanostructures with controlled morphology.192 As a typical deposition technique, magnetron sputtering can realize the large-area direct growth of 2D TMD films.194 Moreover, it is also a green method that is carried out without using any solvents, stabilizers, dispersants, or hazardous substances.192 Notably, the resulting deposited film is entirely derived from the target material, which makes the sputtering synthetic process almost residue-free.
In fact, one of the most prominent characteristics of magnetron sputtering is the pollution-free preparation. The physical sputtering route is facile and environmentally benign for catalyst preparation, thus holding great promise to replace some conventional preparation processes having waste emissions and other pollutants. Since the wet-chemical method is one of the most widely used and low-cost nanomaterial fabrication techniques, magnetron sputtering is roughly compared with such methods (solvothermal synthesis as an example) for preparing nanomaterials such as HEAs from seven aspects, namely greenness/sustainability, cost, productivity, size uniformity of prepared nanomaterials, substrate applicability (types of substrate on which the catalysts can grow), element applicability (ranges of elements available for catalyst preparation), and surface area. The comparison results are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the advantages of magnetron sputtering technology make it quite promising and suitable for mass production. However, magnetron sputtering's cost and production rate are the major problems that need to be solved for its further applications.

3.4. Carbon dioxide reduction reaction
Unlike ORR, OER and HER, the CRR proceeds through multi-electron (even twelve-electron) reduction pathways and thus generates more products including C1, C2 and C3 products, etc.221 Moreover, the competing HER also diminishes the Faraday efficiency (FE) of the desired product, highlighting the complexity of the CRR. Therefore, it is imperative to develop electrocatalysts featuring both high activity and selectivity to tackle the sluggish kinetics of CRR.
It is well known that engineering electrode catalysts with three-phase interfaces can largely boost the activity and selectivity in electrochemical catalysis.222,223 Inspired by the alveolus structure in mammalian lungs, which ensures rapid diffusion of gases while avoiding water infiltration, Cui's group designed a novel biomimetic electrode that also featured favourable gas permeability for overcoming CO2 mass-transport limits and low water diffusibility for the suppression of HER competing processes.224 In this catalytic electrode system, gold nanoparticles were deposited on nanoporous polyethylene (PE) membrane by magnetron sputtering to form a bilayer Au/PE structure, which was further treated with oxygen plasma to enhance the hydrophilicity (Fig. 9a–c). Such a unique design enabled efficient CO2 diffusion and inhibited water penetration, and also resulted in a local pH increase at the active sites. Benefiting from the sufficient three-phase contact and high local pH, an FE for CO2 reduction to CO (FECO) of 92% and a geometric current density for CO production of 25.5 mA cm−2 were achieved at −0.6 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the bilayer Au/PE structure, much higher than the those of flat Au/carbon paper and Au/silicon wafer (Fig. 9d and e). To conclude, in the preparation of magnetron sputtering electrodes, one thing is often neglected, that is, the selection of the sputtering substrate. This is also the reason why quite a few catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering do not perform well. In fact, the selection of a suitable substrate is necessary to construct a robust and efficient electrode, as different substrates enjoy different properties.64,225 For instance, polymer substrates, such as PE, are usually flexible and hydrophobic, which can be used to construct flexible waterproof electrodes. Such a property can be exploited to construct electrocatalysts for reactions that are competitive with HER, like NRR and CRR (Fig. 3). Another example is conductive glass substrates like FTO, which can be further calcined at high temperatures in the air. If the active material needs to be calcined in air after sputtering onto the substrate, then FTO is a fine choice. Moreover, if considerably high electrical conductivity is required, graphite paper or carbon fiber cloth can be used. The choice of substrate is therefore critical to maximizing the performance of the active material, and it is also an excellent choice to make a home-made substrate with unique properties compatible with catalysts for sputtering processing in order to achieve the full performance of the active material.

In addition to the abovementioned Au/PE electrode, sputtered films like Ag226,227 and Cu227,228 with controllable thickness and good adhesion to the substrate have also been prepared as CRR catalysts, demonstrating the great potential of sputtered electrodes for CRR. Recently, Au and AuPd thin film alloys were deposited by magnetron co-sputtering.229 Strikingly, Pd as a superb HER catalyst can suppress the HER when alloyed with Au by increasing the CRR intermediate species coverage and tuning the catalyst's activity, leading to enhanced selectivity toward CO. To investigate the effect of component changes of bimetallic catalysts on the CRR activity and selectivity, Smith et al.230 utilized a co-sputtering procedure to prepare compositionally variant Au–Pt thin films with a uniform surface morphology. In detail, when the Au content increased, the binding strength of the COOH and CO intermediates reduced. Meanwhile, the d-band center shifted away from the Fermi level, indicating that the CRR selectivity of Au–Pt bimetallic films was linked to its composition. Similar to Au–Pt systems, the increase of Au content in magnetron-sputtered Au–Cu thin films was also found to reshape the d-band electronic structure in Liu's study, leading to a weaker *CO binding strength.231 These reports demonstrate the feasibility of modulating the selectivity of bimetallic or even polymetallic catalysts by adjusting their components to inhibit the formation of certain intermediates. In addition, nanostructures featuring high purity and uniform morphology can be easily prepared by the highly reproducible sputtering process, suggesting that the impact of influencing factors on the catalysts’ activity and selectivity, except for the composition (such as local pH), can be significantly reduced. In another work, Guo et al.232 used magnetron sputtering to deposit Ag layers with different thicknesses from 2 to 10 nm onto polycrystalline Zn pellets and studied the synergistic effect between Ag and Zn toward the CRR electrocatalysis. The resultant AgZn electrocatalysts with a 2 nm-thick Ag layer demonstrated a significantly enhanced CRR activity, selectivity, and stability for the conversion of CO2 to CO. The benefit of combining the Ag layer with the Zn structure was evidenced by the XPS data. The binding energy shift in the Ag 3d spectra implied a charge transfer from Ag to Zn and suggested that the bimetallic structure improved the surface charge transfer for CRR. In recent years, diverse electrocatalysts have been developed for directly converting CO2 to alcohols, yet the process still suffers from high overpotential, low FE and low yield rate. In order to improve the selectivity towards ethanol in the CRR process, a confinement strategy – coating Cu catalysts (200 nm) with a 50 nm nitrogen-doped carbon (N–C) layer to promote C–C coupling and suppress C–O bond-breaking in HOCCH* – was demonstrated by Sargent's group (Fig. 9f and g).233 Under a current density of 300 mA cm−2, an ethanol FE of around 52% was achieved by the sputter-deposited N–C/Cu catalysts. Also, the 34% N–C/Cu catalyst (atomic percentage of nitrogen in N–C) exhibited higher FE values and partial current densities of ethanol compared with bare Cu (Fig. 9h and i). Interestingly, the electron density difference plots for N–C/Cu and C/Cu with adsorbed *CO intermediates (Fig. 9j) showed that the adsorbed *CO gains electrons in the plot of N–C/Cu, whereas no electron transfer can be observed for the C/Cu. It is suggested that the N–C layer is beneficial to electron transfer to adsorbed *CO on Cu, thus promoting the generation of the C–C coupled intermediate. Besides, on the basis of spectroscopy and DFT analyses, they concluded that the strong electron-donating ability and confinement of the N–C capping layers were responsible for the pronounced selectivity towards ethanol.
In addition to this confinement strategy, more recent studies by Sargent's group also highlighted the advantage of magnetron sputtering as an effective and powerful tool that can be coupled with other synthetic techniques for CRR electrocatalyst construction, such as modifying a sputtered Cu/PTFE electrode with a hydrated ionomer catalyst coating for C2 product generation from simulated flue gas,234 and tetrahydro-bipyridine films for CO2-to-ethylene conversion.225 These examples show the effectiveness of magnetron sputtering as an intermediate step in the preparation of multicomponent electrocatalysts. And exploration of these advanced CRR catalysts will provide references for the design of new catalysts toward the goal of carbon-neutral cycles.
It can be seen that in order to inhibit the HER side reaction, many novel catalysts for CRR are being designed, such as the bilayer Au/PE structure. However, most of the reported magnetron-sputtered catalysts are only metal-based so far. More non-metallic sputtered materials with high conductivity and rich porosity are therefore expected in further research. Moreover, rational modification of metal-based catalyst surfaces235 and unique architecture construction236,237 (such as nanocavities under a confinement effect, which can achieve higher selectivity than their solid counterparts) are highly needed to change the binding energies of the CRR intermediates, thus controlling the selectivity of the products.
3.5. Alcohol oxidation reaction
The selective electro-oxidation of alcohols such as the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), and isopropanol oxidation is a major focus of energy and chemical conversion efforts.238,239 The development of electrocatalysts for such processes is thus necessary for piratical applications. It is known that Pt poisoning during MOR electrocatalysis is generally resolved by the addition of cocatalysts. However, the most widely used Pt–Ru system only produces a power density approximately 10 times lower than that of PEMFC when used as an anodic catalyst in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). Based on magnetron sputtering technology, a large number of combinatorial and high-throughput screening studies have been conducted to improve the activity of DMFC anodic catalysts. In Tague's work, eighteen Pt–M alloy thin film compositions were sputter-deposited via magnetron sputtering and screened toward the optimal MOR activity, where the most five active systems belong to Sn, In, Fe, Zn, and Ru.240 Besides, Ru-free Pt–M catalysts that were prepared by magnetron sputtering have also been reported. McGinn's group studied the impact of Cr incorporation into Pt–Ni and Pt–Co catalysts on their MOR performances by using a combination screening of Pt–Co–Cr and Pt–Ni–Cr catalysts.241,242 The best MOR activity and stability were observed in Pt30Co30Cr40 and Pt28Ni36Cr36, respectively. Their findings demonstrate the highly composition-dependent activity/stability toward MOR of such ternary systems. Remarkably, McGinn's group further found that alloying vanadium with Pt30Co30Cr40 can give a higher MOR activity with a Pt25Co25Cr25V25 composition.243 In another study, the effect of deposition temperatures on the MOR activity of a ternary Pt–Bi–Pb system was reported by Jin et al.244 The optimal MOR activity was achieved by a composition near PtBi0.01Pb0.53 that deposited at 400 °C. In addition to Pt–M alloy thin films, Denis et al.245 synthesised Au-based amorphous thin film by magnetron sputtering and then de-alloyed the precursor to get nanoporous gold, which revealed good MOR activity and stability. In Pan's work, Pt nanoparticles were sputter-deposited on the ITO glass substrate to study the size effect of Pt particles on electrocatalytic activity toward the MOR, and the optimal MOR performance was achieved at 5 nm in particle size.246 Furthermore, by adjusting the power of Ir and Pt targets in a co-sputtering system, Pt–Ir electrodes with different compositions were prepared to study the effect of Ir loading on the performances.247 The most efficient MOR catalysis was observed at Ir doping up to 80% due to the favourable electronic interactions between Pt and Ir atoms. Moreover, early in 2011, Dameron et al.248 and Hiromi et al.249 deposited PtRu alloy onto carbon supports for the MOR and found that the PtRu anode electrode was commercially competitive when tested in DMFC. In another work, pore-arrayed hydrogen tungsten bronze (p-HxWO3) was prepared to serve as the support of Pt nanoparticles.250 Owing to the more active sites for Pt dispersion on p-HxWO3 than ITO, the p-HxWO3/Pt electrode showed an enhanced MOR performance and anti-poisoning ability. Moreover, sputter-deposited PdO nanoflakes with a large surface area were used to support Pt nanoparticles, and the PdO/Pt electrode showed enhanced durability and activity toward the MOR due to a high CO tolerance and the large electrochemical active surface area.251 Recently, Pt-doped WOx supported by activated carbon were also prepared by magnetron sputtering. It was found that a hydrogen yield increase can be achieved by tailoring the oxide thickness, Pt content and activated carbon interlayer.252 Besides, Sung's group prepared both PtRu alloy films and PtRu-WO3 nanocomposites with selected compositions via a multi-gun co-sputtering method and investigated these catalysts for MOR.253,254 The enhanced activity of PtRu-WO3 was found to be correlated with the size effect of PtRu and spillover effect of WO3. Typically, sputtering Pt onto vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (Pt/VACNFs) can result in a significant improvement of Pt utilization, and it was found that the size of the Pt nanoparticles increased with increasing Pt loading, which can strongly influence the Pt utilization efficiency toward MOR.255 Moreover, Pt nanoparticles were sputtered on VACNFs and carbon nanowall (CNW) as catalysts for MOR, respectively. The Pt/CNW electrode showed superior MOR activity and durability compared with the Pt/VACNFs electrode since the rich defects in the CNW hindered the migration of Pt nanoparticles.256 In addition, modification of Pt with the second metal to construct heterostructures like Pd/Pt core/shell nanowire arrays as an electrode has also shown great potential for MOR.257 In another reference, PtOx layers were sputtered onto Si(100) support and oxygen-plasma etched amorphous carbon films (a-C) supported on Si(100), respectively.258 The chemical state of PtOx changed during the reaction, leading to the formation of stable Pt2+ cations within a nanostructured platinum matrix, while a reference sputtered Pt/Si catalyst with no differences during the tests showed both lower activity and selectivity for MOR. The PtOx/a-C electrode outperformed PtOx/Si, especially in its MOR selectivity exceeding 90%. In addition to Pt-based catalysts, other sputtered materials have also been prepared as MOR catalysts. As an example, Pd50Co50 thin film was sputter-deposited onto nanoporous gold (NPG), followed by chemical dealloying to dissolve the Co away.259 The Co dissolution resulted in the outward diffusion of Au to displace Pd atoms, which enhanced the MOR performance of the resultant NPG/Pd electrode. Similarly, FeRh films that were prepared via co-sputtering of Rh and Fe targets were explored as highly CO-tolerant electrocatalysts in both acidic and alkaline media, where the sputtered FeRh films were activated by cycling in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte to dissolve the Fe atoms and form a Rh-skeleton surface.260 The introduction of iron into rhodium was considered to reduce the d-band center of Rh, and Fe atom leaching further increased the surface area, giving rise to much enhanced MOR activity.
In terms of the EOR electrocatalysis, the optimum atomic composition of PtSn catalysts was established by using a sputter-deposition approach in 2007, where both Pt50Sn50 and Pt80Sn20 exhibited similar EOR performances.261 Note that earlier reports on PtSn catalysts for EOR did not conclude that optimum atomic composition within the PtxSny system since the preparation method affects the results such as impurities incorporation. Moreover, co-sputtered Pt2Si films were prepared as EOR catalysts and revealed improved kinetics compared with pure Pt.262 The incorporation of Si not only accelerated the removal of COads but also modified the electronic properties of Pt. It is known that nanoparticles need to be fixed on conducting substrates for electrocatalysis and often suffer from aggregation and leaching issues during the EOR. Lee et al.263 prepared nanoporous-AuPd thin films via magnetron sputtering and subsequent etching processes. The catalyst showed enhanced activity and stability for the EOR, attributed to the maximum number of active sites and the one-body structure in the AuPd alloy, showing that sputtering as a simple method can be extended to facilitate the design of multicomponent porous nanostructures for energy-related reactions.
It is not difficult to find that Pt-containing nanostructures are one of the most commonly used MOR catalysts. And the anodic electrocatalysts in DMFC are usually Pt nanomaterials at present. Pd-based and Ru-based catalysts also exhibit high activity for MOR, but Pd-based catalysts suffer from poor stability under working conditions.264 The high activity revealed by these noble metal-based catalysts such as Pt- and Pd-based nanostructures with special morphologies (specific crystal faces) is so interesting that it requires further exploration. Meantime, developing the nanostructures of Fe, Ni, Co, Cu with relatively low cost to replace the expensive noble metal-based catalyst Pt as an anodic electrocatalyst in alkaline media is also important.
3.6. Other half-reactions
The emerging family of magnetron-sputtered nanostructures also brings opportunities for the advancements of catalysts for other energy reactions like hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR). Searching for electrocatalysts with activity on a par with or even exceeding that of Pt toward alkaline HOR remains a challenge for the development of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs).265 And an appreciable improvement of magnetron-sputtered HOR catalysts has been made in the past few decades, such as sputtered Pt films,266 Ir/TiC-based support sublayers,267 Pt–Ru alloy films,268 and Ni–Cu alloy films.269 Montero et al.270,271 investigated the electrocatalytic properties and kinetic parameters of the sputter-deposited nanostructured iridium electrode toward the HOR and found that the HOR on Ir mainly belonged to the T-V route. Ostroverkh et al.272 prepared Pt-doped amorphous carbon films (25 nm) with a low Pt loading by magnetron sputtering of a graphite target with radially placed Pt wires. This Pt–C catalyst exhibited a reasonable bifunctional catalytic activity for the HOR and ORR in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Haslam et al.273 prepared nanostructured nickel encapsulated in carbon via magnetron sputtering of a composite nickel and graphite target. The resultant nickel-containing carbon thin film was shown to be an effective electrocatalyst towards the HOR in acidic media with no corrosion of metallic parts in the metal–carbon systems, associated with the presence of a very thin graphitic carbon layer (1–5 atom layers) encapsulating the Ni nanoparticles with a radius of 2 nm. Such a robust passivation strategy allows a new form of nickel–carbon nanostructured material made exclusively from base materials to be developed. Taking advantage of the uniform mixing of metal atoms of the combinatorial co-sputtering method, Zhuang's group synthesized both Pt–Ru alloy electrodes with 14 different compositions.268 The composition–activity relationship was revealed by a volcano plot (exchange current density (i0) and Ru atomic ratio), where the highest i0 of 2.98 mA cm2 in the HOR (two times higher, compared with pure Pt) was observed at 55.8% Ru content for Pt–Ru alloys. The improved kinetics was due to a reduction in the electronic charge density of Pt derived from Ru doping. Furthermore, the same method was also used to prepare a series of noble-metal free Ni–Cu electrodes with various atomic ratios to reveal their composition–activity relationship towards HOR.269 Interestingly, incorporating Cu into Ni improved the overall tolerance to oxidation, and the i0 of the Ni–Cu alloy with ca. 40 at% Cu was 4 times higher than that of pure Ni. Zhuang's studies show that constructing highly dispersed sputtered nanocatalysts with a well-defined structure and composition for HOR appears promising and warrants further development.
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) using cheap and stable urea is an ideal alternative to OER for water splitting because it enjoys a significantly lower theoretical potential (Fig. 3). Besides, by using direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) to generate electricity, the urea-rich wastewater can be utilized and simultaneously purified, offering double benefits.274–276 However, UOR as a complex 6e− transfer process also exhibits intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which makes it necessary to develop efficient catalysts to improve the conversion efficiency and system performance.277 By employing the magnetron sputtering technique, catalyst fabrication can be more favourable from stoichiometry and structure perspectives. As a good example, Yoon et al.278 prepared carbon paper-supported Pd–Ni thin film (500 nm) with a uniform island structure by a shadow mask-assisted co-sputtering method. Such a structure allows for a more accurate assessment of the effect of different Pd–Ni composition ratios on the UOR activity. At room temperature, the performance of constructed DUFC based on the Pd60Ni40/C anode and the Pd/C cathode was significantly improved, displaying an open circuit voltage of 0.59 V and a maximum power density of 1.12 mW cm−2. Therefore, the dominant effect of alloy composition ratios can be better evaluated by using the sputtering technique subtly to minimize structural variation.
Magnetron-sputtered nanostructures can serve as potential electrocatalysts for other electrochemical reactions such as the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HydOR).279 In a report by Luo and co-workers in 2019,280 a nanoporous nickel film catalyst was prepared via a three-step synthesis, with co-sputtering of Ni–Al precursor alloys followed by annealing and dealloying treatments. Different Ni–Al composition ratios were adjusted via fine-tuning of the Ni target sputtering power, and the best results (a current density of 21 mA cm−2 at 0.32 V vs. RHE) for hydrazine decomposition were obtained with Ni50Al50. DFT calculations suggested that the dissociative adsorption of hydrazine on the Ni(111) surface with liberation of H atoms is the rate-determining step followed by fast H atom recombination to H2 molecules. In addition to the abovementioned reactions, magnetron sputtering can serve as an effective approach to fabricate anodic catalysts for formic acid oxidation (FAO) in a direct formic acid fuel cell. The developed sputtered catalysts for the FAO have mostly focused on two aspects: (1) engineering of Pt or Pd nanoparticles by tuning the morphology to enhance the activity and stability, such as Pt/Teflon membrane,281 Pd/carbon cloth,282 and TiO2 nanotube-supported Pd catalyst;283 and (2) alloying of precious metal with other metals to improve performance and optimize their use, such as PdCu/carbon cloth.284 Moreover, a wide range of sputtered electrocatalysts, including Pt/Ti electrodes,285 RuO2 thin films,286 IrOx–TiOx coatings,287 and IrO2–SnO2 films288 have also been reported to show promising activity for the chlorine evolution reaction (ChlER).
The sputtered electrocatalysts developed for these half-reactions, such as HOR, are mostly alloys. In fact, amorphous alloys may offer us new directions in these fields, since the alloys we discussed in section 3.6 are crystals and research into amorphous alloys is rather limited. Amorphous catalysts with a highly disordered 3D arrangement present higher catalytic performance in energy electrocatalysis than their crystalline counterparts;289 rational design of amorphous alloys is therefore promising to boost the reaction kinetics.
4. Advances in energy devices
In a real energy system, more than one half-reaction is involved, which requires bifunctional electrocatalysts that are active for different reactions. Rechargeable metal–air batteries involving ORR (discharge)/OER (charge) on the cathode (air electrode) and metal dissolution and deposition on the anode are extremely attractive as candidates to power modern electronics due to their admirable theoretical energy densities.290–292
In 2013, sputtered Mg thin films with a loose and porous structure were prepared to improve the anodic efficiency of Mg–air batteries, indicating that the fine-tuning of Mg morphology can greatly improve its electrochemical performances.293 Furthermore, Li et al.294 implemented magnetron sputtering to coat carbon fibers with Au–Pd alloy (only 30 s sputtering treatment for a 1.32% loading) as binder-free cathodes for Li–O2 batteries, which can effectively promote Li2O2 formation and decomposition, giving rise to a significant reduction of the polarization voltage. These studies demonstrate the great potential of sputtered bifunctional electrocatalysts for enhancing the performances of energy devices, yet little work has been done in this field based on magnetron-sputtered nanostructures. Introducing anionic and cationic vacancies into metal oxides has been proved as an effective strategy to enhance their electronic conductivity and catalytic activity.295 Although oxygen vacancy (which bonds to oxygen and facilitates electron transfer) is effective in promoting ORR/OER kinetics, the exact mechanism of oxygen vacancy for such improvement remains ambiguous. In light of this, Long's group prepared oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4via magnetron sputtering and demonstrated the regulation of surface oxygen vacancy concentration by simply controlling the sputtering time (Fig. 10a).296 It was found that the defective NiCo2O4 with an appropriate defect concentration (10 min sputtering) enjoyed an optimized filling of eg orbital electrons as well as intense adsorption of oxygen on its surface (Fig. 10d), producing the lowest overpotential of 0.49 V and superior cycling stability among all the samples (Fig. 10b and c), whereas a continuous loss of oxygen atoms (15 min sputtering) not only led to the destabilization of the spinel structure but also hindered the decomposition of Li2O2. Long's work shows that, in addition to nanostructure synthesis, magnetron sputtering can serve as a quick and green approach for creating surface vacancies on the surface of catalysts without using chemicals or a reduction atmosphere as well.

Electrochemical overall water splitting (zero carbon emission and the ability to store intermittent renewable energy) involving HER and OER is a sustainable approach toward hydrogen production, and different electrolytes being required for the two reactions made noble metals such as Pt no longer competitive.297 Thus, exploring active, stable and affordable Pt-free catalysts that can operate in the same electrolyte remains a challenging task. Iridium (Ir) presents superb catalytic power toward the OER under acidic conditions, while the strong bonding of hydrogen to Ir atoms greatly limits the HER activity; thus the Ir-based catalysts can be regarded as the most promising candidates once their HER activity can be improved. Ren et al.298 reported the synthesis of a Si-doped Ir electrode via a co-sputtering method, where the Si doping not only improved the Ir utilization but also resulted in weak adsorption of Had. Accordingly, the Si-doped Ir electrode exhibited a Tafel slope of 36.5 mV dec−1 and an improved HER η50 of 114 mV (148 mV for Ir electrode) in acidic solution.
Among various types of potential electrocatalysts for water splitting, perovskite oxides with multimetal oxide forms are of particular interest because of their robust composition and superior stability. Particularly, reconstruction in such materials can strongly improve their catalytic activities by forming fresh compositions with unusual amorphous phases in situ.299 However, such materials, especially in the bulk phase, are hard to reconstruct. In Chen's work, amorphous SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3−δ nanofilms were deposited on Ni foam (SCFP-NF) by argon plasma sputtering of a crystalline SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3−δ target (Fig. 11a and b), which underwent a rapid structural reconstruction during the electrocatalysis since the weaker chemical bonds within the amorphous structure are easily to reconstruct. The obtained SCFP-NF catalyst displayed a HER η10 of 110 mV and an OER η10 of 310 mV, respectively (Fig. 11c and d).299 The assembled water electrolyzer easily reached 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.66 V, and exhibited a high mass activity of 1000 mA mg−1 (Fig. 11e and f). Note that the water splitting, as an intense uphill reaction, generally operates at voltages (above 1.8 V vs. RHE) much higher than the theoretical limit of 1.23 V. In addition, such a structural reconstruction provided SCFP-NF with ultralong operational stability of up to 650 h (Fig. 11g). It is interesting to find that magnetron-sputtering treatment of crystalline SCFP targets can destroy their chemical bonds and reserve the homogeneous distribution of the elements. Therefore, the sputtering method can also serve as a universal way to prepare precursors with different compositions and initial structures to accelerate the reconstruction of various types of potential electrocatalysts, leading to substantial enhancements in electrochemical properties. Table 1 compares the benchmark catalysts and recent sputtered catalysts for various half-reactions in terms of performance.300–305

5. Summary and perspectives
Magnetron sputtering is a quick, reproducible, sustainable and relatively low-cost platform for next-generation electrocatalyst synthesis and screening. In recent decades, there has been a solid increase in the utilization of magnetron-sputtered nanostructures as electrocatalysts for energy electrocatalysis. We hope that this timely and comprehensive overview of applications of magnetron sputtering for electrocatalyst synthesis will inspire further research in this area and provide references accordingly. In this article, we systematically review the important advances of magnetron-sputtered nanostructures as electrocatalysts in various half-reactions (i.e. ORR, OER, HER, CRR, AOR, HOR, UOR, ChlER) and energy devices involving their fabrication details and electrochemical properties. The effectiveness and strength of magnetron sputtering for improving the design of electrocatalysts with activity, efficiency and stability are highlighted. In comparison with nanoparticles formed via wet-chemical routes, the pollution-free growth, good uniformity, high purity, and freestanding features of magnetron-sputtered nanomaterials make them very promising electrocatalysts for a wide range of energy-related reactions. Additionally, many examples have been given to demonstrate the morphology diversity of magnetron-sputtered nanomaterials. Customized sputtered nanomaterials with well-defined stoichiometry are not only available as thin films, but also in other forms, such as hollow tubes. Note that as a thin film preparation technology that is still developing, magnetron sputtering gives great scope for catalyst design, and further processing of the electrocatalysts such as adding buffer layers between different components within the electrocatalysts can also be achieved by coupling magnetron sputtering with other synthetic techniques. Despite substantial progress in material design/synthesis and properties investigation, challenges remain in the further development of magnetron-sputtered electrocatalysts and several future trends in this field can be concluded.
(1) As aforementioned, magnetron sputtering has shown its unique superiorities in many cases like facile fabrication processes without impurities at a relatively low temperature. Yet, rarely is the application of magnetron sputtering seen in catalyst preparation for some important electrocatalytic reactions, such as NRR (nitrogen reduction reactions)306 and NOR (nitrogen oxidation reactions) for the nitrogen cycle, at present. Another example is the two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e− WOR), which is a prohibited side-reaction for energy applications in comparison with the OER, yet it also presents a quite attractive route for on-site production of H2O2 from H2O. Currently, few electrocatalysts have been explored in this area of 2e− WOR, whereas magnetron sputtering can serve as a robust platform for screening such electrocatalysts for the following reasons: (i) most electrocatalysts for the 2e− WOR are limited to metal oxides and the substrate supports for these oxide catalysts are mainly FTO, because of the relatively high theoretical potential (1.76 V at standard conditions) of the 2e− WOR;307 (ii) aside from self-supporting electrodes, most of the electrodes are prepared via spin coating followed by the annealing process, since the selectivity and activity of the 2e− WOR materials are strongly dependent on the uniformity and thickness of the coated layers.308 Therefore, we expect significantly more exploration of magnetron-sputtered nanostructures in these fields in the coming years.
(2) Some potential electrocatalysts, such as transition metal borides with attractive electrocatalytic properties,309,310 have been less explored compared with metal oxides due to the difficulty in preparation. Magnetron sputtering can theoretically prepare any nanoscale films for the evaluation of fundamental properties in a green and facile way, which may open up for such nanomaterials opportunities to expand the applications in certain types of electrocatalytic reactions.
(3) At present, many of the reports only use magnetron sputtering to prepare thin film electrocatalysts, which greatly reduces the exposure of the active sites of sputtered materials. For instance, as an extensively studied electrocatalyst, MoS2 can be easily prepared via a sputtering deposition approach, serving as a powerful HER electrocatalyst. Yet, their performances can be restrained due to the thick film structure in some reports. In order to keep the preparation process of magnetron sputtering simple and simultaneously improve active edge sites as well as surface contact areas, developing template-free sputter-deposition techniques for the synthesis of HER catalysts is important. That being said, we have also seen some sputtered electrocatalysts that were designed based on specific reaction systems and principles, with an appropriate use of magnetron sputtering technology. Thus, another point is worth noting: how to use magnetron sputtering skilfully and flexibly in the design of advanced electrocatalysts based on different specific needs. For instance, magnetron sputtering can easily create oxygen vacancies by bombarding materials with energetic particles as aforementioned, and the concentration of such defects is very important for achieving better catalytic performances.296 Hence, research should be conducted into rational development and engineering of the defects of sputtered catalytic materials. Moreover, by sputtering the active materials on carbon nanotubes, good catalytic activities can be achieved. More diverse sputtered electrocatalysts on 3D carbon materials or carbon dots to obtain good electrochemical performances are thus expected.
(4) According to the literature, the sputtering substrate is also a crucial part of the deposition preparation of electrocatalysts. Wang et al.311 also pointed out that the performances of thin film catalysts depend largely on the interface between the catalyst and the substrate since the mismatch between the active materials and the substrate can largely impair their performances. This is also the reason why some thin film catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering exhibit inferior performances. Thus, a definitive understanding of the behaviour and mechanism under reaction conditions is of great significance for the rational design of efficient thin film catalyst systems. Generally, the selection of the same catalyst on different substrates will exhibit dramatically different catalytic activity and stability, as the active and support materials possess different properties. For instance, the characteristics of the polymer substrates (PE, PTFE, …), conductive glass substrates (FTO, ITO, …), and carbon substrates (graphite paper, carbon fiber cloth, …) are different, so the circumstances in which they are applied should also be different. The choice of substrate is therefore critical to maximizing the performance of the active material, and it is also a good choice to devise a home-made substrate with unique properties for sputtering processing in order to achieve the full performance of the active material. Note that there should be corresponding optimal substrate selection for specific electrocatalytic reaction conditions, as long as the catalysts can be utilized with maximum efficiency. As another example, traditional carbon, as the catalyst substrate supporting Pt, faces corrosion problems in fuel cell applications. Luckily, such precious metal-based catalyst systems can be designed by magnetron sputtering, and the choice of substrates can be very diverse, such as oxides, carbides, and polymers. These substrates can significantly reduce the amount of platinum while giving superior durability, specific activity, and ECSA over Pt/C.83
(5) Presently, most of the reported magnetron-sputtered electrocatalysts are still confined to solid substrates. In fact, the substrates used for sputtering are not limited to a solid substrate. Liquid substrates, such as polyethylene glycol, can also be used for the sputter-deposition of small-sized (1 to 10 nm) colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of any stabilizing or reducing agents.312 Moreover, the prompt physical sputtering process can effectively eliminate chemical residuals, making it easier to synthesize a wide variety of stable, highly purified nanostructures with specially manipulated compositions. Note that such a nanomaterial colloidal synthetic approach can be also used to uncover the relationship among sputtering parameters, growth mechanisms and the properties of the corresponding materials.
(6) There are many examples of the magnetron-sputtering preparation of electrocatalysts using metal-based targets. Non-metallic targets, however, are used relatively infrequently. In fact, metal-free catalysts are also full of potential in certain energy conversion reactions, so future magnetron sputtering of thin film materials should see more metal-free cases.
(7) As some metals (like yttrium) can be easily oxidized, exposure of their alloys (Pt3Y) to air would cause the formation of an oxide layer (stoichiometric Y2O3 and substoichiometric Pt3Y-O) at the surface of the alloys, which can bring an electrochemical activity drop. Thus, unravelling the surface chemistry and structure of sputtered thin films (the exact mechanism behind the substoichiometric Pt3Y-O) can help to further improve the electrochemical activity of sputtered thin films.
(8) In comparison with catalysts prepared by other methods, the physically sputter-deposited films can serve as a robust platform for investigating the electrocatalytic activities of various active sites in the electrocatalysts, and also deeply revealing the rate-dominating step of the electrocatalytic mechanism for certain reactions.192 Based on modelling calculations and advanced characterization tools, investigations into the activity–structure–electrolyte correlations on the sputtered thin film surfaces are expected to be resolved in future studies. Moreover, the use of magnetron sputtering allows precise control over particle size without possible downside effects such as the impacts of a 3D porous support on Pt dissolution.313
(9) The thickness of the catalyst has a decisive influence on the selectivity of the ORR, as an overly thick catalyst coating can directly alter the reaction path.314 In this case, the advantages of magnetron sputtering are even more pronounced, since the thickness of the catalyst can not only be effectively controlled, but the process is also free of contaminants. And most catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering are freestanding electrodes that do not require a binder. In fact, for half-reactions with multiple products, the thickness of the catalyst is more or less influential.308 And one of the biggest advantages of sputtering is the great control over the thickness of the film. Therefore, the use of catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering can effectively improve the accuracy of determining the selectivity of the material itself.
(10) As aforementioned, despite its distinct advantages, the magnetron sputtering technology has several drawbacks (Table 2) compared with other deposition techniques. For instance, atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows layers to be deposited on way more complex 3D substrates and the prepared layers are essentially free from nanopores and defects.315 However, the expensiveness and slow deposition process make ALD less attractive.316 As another example, the sputtering energy is lower than that of the pulsed laser deposition (PLD),317 so sputtering is certainly not suitable for preparing material in all cases, even though sputtering may accomplish these preparations. To provide the reader with a more comprehensive understanding of deposition techniques, we compared the merits and demerits of various deposition techniques (Table 2),315–325 especially their degree of environmental friendliness (greenness), which is based on whether the technique is a chemical process and the amount of precursors/carrier gas residues.323–325 Therefore, magnetron sputtering should be used reasonably according to different application scenarios and requirements. On the other hand, magnetron sputtering is regarded as an industrial process that is applicable to large-area, high-quality, and high-reproducibility deposition.129,142,326–332 In view of the industrial manufacture of electrocatalysts and commercial applications, the relatively low production rate of the sputtering process compared with other methods like dip-coating deposition is another block.333–335 And the diversity and functionality of the magnetron-sputtered nanostructures still need further improvement to be considered for commercialization. Despite these and other issues, there are many companies in the world that develop and provide advanced sputtering devices and systems, as shown in Table 3. As a facile, ecofriendly, and efficient deposition technology, magnetron sputtering will get more applications and further development.

(11) As highlighted by Lagadec and Grimaud in a recent perspective paper,336 the essence of the industrialization dilemma of water electrolysis research lies in the fact that, as an open system, the water electrolysis process requires expensive auxiliary facilities. Therefore, it is equally important to advance the fundamental understanding of the complex processes occurring at the electrochemical electrode interface (long-term benefits of materials science) in designing the electrocatalysts and to develop better electrolytic water industrial components (short-term and long-term benefits of engineering). For that reason, there is an urgent need for researchers in the relevant fields, such as materials science, electrochemistry and chemical engineering, to address materials-related issues that industry has a real need to address (such as the preparation of bipolar plate and porous transport layer materials, stability testing in extreme environments, etc.). Different from tedious wet-chemical routing, magnetron-sputtering technology as a clean, quick and precise tool is well-suited to build novel electrochemical conversion systems for both laboratory and industrial scales. Also, sputtered nanostructures enjoy admirable repeatability and scalability, which can further narrow the gap between laboratory conditions and practical devices.
(12) Apart from energy electrocatalysis, magnetron sputtering has been explored in more applications for commercial use. Commercially-established applications of magnetron-sputtering coatings for biomedical use have significantly increased, showing great promise to expand and evolve the clinical applications in coming years.25 Moreover, magnetron sputtering can also be employed to design and construct flexible energy storage materials for portable and wearable devices.20 In addition, we can also see the application of magnetron sputtering in the field of sensing. Various sputter-deposited sensors have been constructed for gas sensing like NO2,337 H2S,338 and ozone sensing.339 Recently, magnetron sputtering was used to construct a three-phase catalyst for formaldehyde oxidation treatment.340 More applications based on sputtered nanomaterials are thus expected for pollution control.
