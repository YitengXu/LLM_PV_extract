    , Accepted 5th October 2010First published on 16th November 2010AbstractThe first example of a heteroarylvinylene π-conjugated quaterpyridine Ru(II) sensitizer (N1044) was synthesized and used in dye-sensitized solar cells; the dye has an effective panchromatic absorption band, covering the entire visible spectrum up to the NIR region, and superior electrochemical characteristics (HOMO/LUMO and bandgap energies) with respect to previous representative Ru(II) bi- and quaterpyridine sensitizers. A record IPCE curve ranging from 360 to 920 nm has been measured with a maximum of 65% at 646 nm and still 33% efficiency at 800 nm; this leads to substantially increased photocurrent (19.2 mA cm−2) when compared to the prototype N719 Ru(II) sensitizer.
Introduction
The need for reliable and economically viable alternative and renewable energy sources has boosted research on new materials for unconventional photovoltaics.1,2 In the field of molecular-based photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have reached the best efficiencies, approaching those exhibited by conventional systems such as amorphous silicon solar modules.3–5 The photosensitizer dye, which absorbs light from the sun and transfers an electron-hole pair at the interface with the wide-gap TiO2 semiconductor and the redox mediator, is the first device interface to the external input and thus represents one of the strategic components of these cells. Metal complex sensitizers have best performed so far, with efficiencies maximizing at ca. 11.2% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.6,72,2′-Bipyridine- (bpy) based Ru(II) complexes have been by far the most investigated and efficient systems. The most representative dye of this series is the homoleptic complex bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II), carrying 4 (N3)8 or 2 (N719)9 protonated carboxylic anchoring groups to TiO2. One of the major issues for further improvement in the DSCs is the sensitizers mismatch between the dye absorption spectrum and the solar emission, extended to the near-IR (NIR) lower energy portion of the spectrum. The design of new sensitizers having a strong panchromatic response extending throughout the visible and into the NIR is therefore of paramount importance.
Polypyridines other than bpy have been much more rarely investigated, although a series of ruthenium(II) sensitizers derived from carboxylated terpyridyl complexes of tris-thiocyanato Ru(II) (black dye) have exceeded 11.1% efficiencies.10 Currently, quaterpyridine (qpy) ligands for DSC sensitizers are largely unexplored, in contrast to the extensive studies of bpy-based dyes. This is likely due to the synthetic challenges associated to the qpy ligands and very few reports have been published on DSC Ru(II)-sensitizers based on such tetradentate ligands.11–13 Although their overall solar to electric power efficiencies were not among the highest-ranked ones, these studies have pointed out the possible panchromatic response of the corresponding complexes extending from the NIR to the UV region, rendering them as alternative promising sensitizers with enhanced solar harvesting capability over the conventional bpy-based sensitizers.
To address the general issues related to the rather weak absorption of Ru(II) dyes in the red and NIR region, a number of heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers with extended bpy ancillary ligands π-conjugated with electron-rich benzenoid cores carrying donor primary organic functionalities such as alkoxy have been introduced.14–19Ru(II) complexes based on such ligands are generally endowed with enhanced optical properties with respect to the prototypical N3 or N719 dyes, which also translate into higher photocurrents when employed in DSC devices. In particular, encouraging performances have been recently reached by using thiophene-based derivatives as electron-rich donor end-groups.20–30 We have also contributed recently to this scenario by describing the heteroleptic ruthenium complex Ru-EDOT carrying a heteroaromatic-4,4′-π-conjugated bpy [Ru(II)LL’(NCS)2] (L = 4,4′-bis[(E)-2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-bpy, L’ = 4,4′-(dicarboxylic acid)-bpy) yielding photovoltaic efficiencies of 9.1% under standard global AM 1.5 sunlight.31 With the contribution of TDDFT studies we have found that the conjugated π-excessive heteroaromatic ring 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as donor end-substituent provides directionality in the excited state, leading to enhanced oscillator strength and significantly increased short circuit photocurrent.
In order to address some of the major issues so far reported in the literature, one approach would be to synergetically combine the superior optical properties of π-donor conjugated bpy14–31 with the panchromatic response of quaterpyridine ligands.13 However, π-donor conjugated 2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-qpys have been so far scantly investigated11,12,32 and even more rarely used as DSC sensitizers. To the best of our knowledge, thiophene substituted qpy derivatives are so far unknown. We present here the first example of heteroarylvinylene π-conjugated 4,4′′′-bis[(E)-2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-4′,4′′-bis(carboxy)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine ligand, and its trans-dithiocyanato Ru(II) sensitizer, hereafter N1044 (Fig. 1), that exhibits panchromatic spectral response extending from the UV throughout the entire visible spectral region and, when inserted in DSCs, provides an enhanced incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and photocurrent density.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of the photosensitizer N1044 was accomplished starting from the ligand 1, where the two carboxylic functionalities have been protected as methyl esters (Scheme 1). Compound 1 was obtained by adapting a procedure previously reported for the synthesis of a 4′,4′′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine.13 Exploiting the symmetry of the desired compound, the qpy ligand was obtained as a pale brown solid through a convergent-like Stille cross-coupling reaction of 6,6′-dibromo-4,4′-methoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine13 with 4-[2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-2-(trimethylstannyl)pyridine (2), available through a versatile Pd catalyzed stannylation with hexamethyldistannane33 of the corresponding 2-bromopyridine precursor 3. The halopyridine was prepared by condensation of the anion of 2-bromo-4-picoline with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-2-carbaldehyde34 to afford alcohol 4, which underwent dehydration by treatment with POCl3 in pyridine and quenching with water.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of Ru(II) sensitizer N1044. 
The complex N1044 was obtained by reacting the ligand 1 with dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer and KNCS. Hydrolysis of the ester groups to COOH was accomplished by reaction with Et3N at reflux. Finally, one of the two COOH functionalities was deprotonated by treating the crude N1044 with one equivalent of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. Purification of N1044 (see Experimental section) was repeated three times to obtain the pure N-bonded isomer complex. The NMR of the three times purified compound shows the presence of only one isomer containing N-bonded NCS ligands 98.5% pure with one tetrabutylammonium cation.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis spectrum of N1044 in DMF is depicted in Fig. 2. As a result of the incorporation of the EDOT group attached to the qpy core, the absorption spectrum shows two intense bands at 298 and 400 nm, originating from intra-ligand π–π* transitions, and a broad mixed metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) feature, covering the entire visible range, with a flat maximum peaking at 615 nm, characterized by a molar extinction coefficient of 7500 mol−1 L cm−1 (Table 1). The absorption broadness, comparable to that of the so-called black dye (tris-thiocyanato-ruthenium(II) terpyridyl),10 originates from the qpy ligand which gives rise to extended π-conjugation. Even though the molar extinction coefficient of this low energy feature is comparable to that reported for terpyridine- and qpy-based Ru(II)-complexes,11,12,35 the broadness of the MLCT absorption is unprecedented. Moreover, in the visible region N1044 shows an almost constant optical response from ca. 450 to ca. 700 nm, while previously reported qpy-sensitizers showed in this region a two-band absorption profile with overall inferior light-harvesting. A stronger absorption enhancement is found for N1044 at 400–450 nm compared to previously reported qpy-sensitizers. In this wavelength region N1044 shows a molar extinction coefficient as high as 35500 mol−1 L cm−1, while the t-butyl substituted analogue exhibited a molar extinction coefficient of 10300 mol−1 L cm−1 at 395 nm.12 Such an enhanced optical response marks therefore a distinctive feature of this EDOT-substituted-qpy sensitizer compared to previously reported systems, which endows N1044 with a definitely improved light-harvesting capability.

The increased red-absorption capability of N1044 is confirmed by electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical data, collected in Table 1, show the one electron Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidation at E1/2 = + 0.29 V vs.Fc+/Fc with a quasi-reversible feature (see ESI†). This is lower than the oxidation potential of the previously reported trans-dithiocyanato-Ru(II)-qpy dye bearing tert-butyl substituents (N886 in Table 1).13 Indeed, the introduction of the electron-rich heteroaromatic EDOT substituents destabilizes the mainly highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) by ca. 0.1 and 0.2 eV with respect to the reference qpy and bpy based Ru(II) dyes, respectively (Table 1). In reduction, four subsequent peaks are observed at −1.35, −1.75, −1.99, and −2.21 V (vs.Fc+/Fc) (see ESI‡). The first peak is due to reduction of protons on the carboxylic acid function,36 whereas the three irreversible peaks are ascribed to the qpy ligand unit. The peak at −1.75 V, corresponding to the reduction of the qpy ligand, is less negative than the corresponding feature found for the qpy-based Ru(II) complex N886 (−1.92 V),13 because of the increased conjugation introduced by the vinyl-heteroaromatic moiety. The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gap is thus evaluated to be 2.04 V, comparable with the recorded UV-vis spectrum (2.02 eV).
It is therefore evident from the electrochemical data that the combination of the qpy core and the electron-rich heteroaromatic substitution simultaneously provides significant destabilization of the Ru(II) t2g ground state (higher HOMO) and stabilization of the π* orbitals (lower LUMO) with respect to the t-butyl substituted Ru(II)-qpy N886, the prototype Ru(II)-bpy N719, and our previously reported EDOT-substituted Ru-EDOT sensitizers (Chart 1). The electrochemical gap is decreased from ca. 2.5 V in Ru-EDOT and 2.3 V in N886 and N719 to ca. 2.0 V in N1044, resulting in a successful red-shift of the absorption edge of the latter.

The Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectrum of the N1044 complex was measured as a solid sample (Fig. 3). It shows a strong band at 1710 cm−1 due to v(CO) stretching of the carboxylic acid groups. The peak at 1229 cm−1 is assigned to v(C–O) stretch. The presence of a single band centred at 2098 cm−1, due to v(CN) of thiocyanate, shows that the two monodentate ligands are coordinated to the ruthenium center through the nitrogen atom in a trans configuration.37 The bands at 1598 and 1477 cm−1 are due to the ring-stretching modes of the pyridine-based ligand.38 The intense band at 1435 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the aromatic CC band, whereas other, weaker bands at 1364 and 1279 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching mode of single C–C bond and the C–C inter-ring bonds of the EDOT moiety. Some distinct bands are observed also in the range of stretching vibrations of the C–H bonds between 2800 and 3100 cm−1.39 The spectrum shows a broad band at 3371 cm−1 due to v(O–H) water molecules.40

Computational study
To gain insights into the interaction of N1044 with the TiO2 surface and to provide a rationale for the electronic transitions responsible for the broad and red-shifted absorption spectrum of N1044, we performed DFT/TDDFT calculations on the complex in solution and adsorbed onto an extended (TiO2)82 surface slab. Calculations in solution have been performed on both the protonated and deprotonated complexes. Inspection of the electronic structure for the complex in solution reveals that, as previously found, the HOMOs are a combination of metal-t2g and thiocyanate π orbitals with variable contributions. For the deprotonated species, the LUMO/LUMO+1 are π* molecular orbitals delocalized over the qpy ligand portion bearing the vinyl-heteroaromatic moiety (Fig. 4), while the LUMO+2 is a π* orbital involving the ligand portion bearing the carboxylic groups. In line with previous investigations,13 the LUMOs order is reversed in the protonated species, with the LUMO being now partly delocalized over the protonated carboxylic groups. This situation should correspond closely to that of the complex adsorbed on TiO2, whereby the positive Ti(IV) surface atoms partly saturate the carboxylates negative charge.41 This is effectively confirmed by comparison between calculated data for the protonated/deprotonated complex in solution and adsorbed onto TiO2, see below. The calculated absorption spectra for the protonated complex in solution shows red-shifted absorption features compared to the deprotonated case (see ESI†). The absorption spectrum of the deprotonated complex is in good agreement with the measured spectrum both in terms of band position and relative intensity (see Fig. 4 for a comparison between theory and experiment).
 Fig. 4  Comparison between the experimental absorption spectrum of N1044 (red line) and the calculated one for the deprotonated complex (blue line). The calculated spectrum has been obtained by a Gaussian convolution with FWHM = 0.45 eV. The intensity of the experimental spectrum has been rescaled to match that of the calculated feature of the deprotonated complex at 410 nm. 
The broad low-lying transition recorded for the complex in solution at 615 nm is calculated by TDDFT at 640 nm, i.e. only 0.08 eV red-shifted compared to the experimental data. Such transition arises from a HOMO-1 → LUMO excitation (see the corresponding orbitals in the inset of Fig. 4), thus originating from a mixed Ru-NCS antibonding orbital to a qpy π* state. The broad absorption spectrum is originated from the superposition of this low-lying transition with a second group of MLCT features in the range 450–530 nm. The two groups of transitions calculated at 400 and 340 nm give rise to the double peaked high energy π–π* feature.
The dye excited state oxidation potentials for the complex in solution have been estimated using the calculated ground state oxidation potential and the lowest TDDFT excitation energy, according to a procedure previously developed by us,41 providing values of 3.9 and 3.4 eV vs. vacuum for the protonated and deprotonated complex, respectively, i.e. ca. −0.5 and −1.0 eV vs.NHE, respectively. Thus, while the excited state oxidation potential of the deprotonated complex lies substantially above the TiO2 conduction band energy, ensuring a sufficient driving force and density of TiO2 unoccupied states for electron injection, the protonated complex shows an excited state energy almost coincident with the TiO2 conduction band edge. In analogy with the calculated data for the N719 complex,41 we expect the ground and excited state oxidation potentials for the protonated complex to be very similar to that of the complex anchored to TiO2. To check this hypothesis and to gain insight into the aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface, we further explored the adsorption mode of the monoprotonated N1044 complex on an extended (TiO2)82 model slab (Fig. 5).42
 Fig. 5  Adsorption geometry for a N1044 dimer on the TiO2 surface. The adsorption mode for the single dye has been calculated and then it has been replicated to model the dimer interaction at the shortest possible distance. 
The mono-protonated dye is adsorbed onto TiO2 exploiting the deprotonated carboxylic group binding in a bidentate bridging mode to two neighbouring Ti(IV) surface atoms, while the protonated carboxylic group binds in a monodentate fashion, with a carboxyl oxygen hydrogen bonding to the dye proton transferred to the surface, see Fig. 5. Electronic structure calculations of the dye on TiO2 and in solution performed at the same level of theory (B3LYP/3-21G*/C-PCM) revealed a difference in the HOMO energies within 0.02 eV. We were also able to calculate the lowest TDDFT excitation for a single dye on TiO2, obtaining a transition at 1.71 eV, which is essentially coincident with that calculated for the protonated complex at the same level of theory (1.70 eV). Thus, the low driving force for electron injection estimated for the protonated and adsorbed complex needs a proper design of the cell components in order to address such an issue (vide infra).
Considering the possible tendency of these molecules, showing an extended π system, to aggregate on the TiO2 surface, we exploited the geometry calculated by DFT for a single dye adsorbed on TiO2 to build the geometry of the closest aggregated possible dimeric configuration, see Fig. 5, by doubling the monomer adsorption mode at the shortest non-overlapping distance compatible with the pattern of Ti(IV) undercoordinated surface ions. The shortest dye/dye contacts, corresponding to intermolecular thiocyanate/thiophene sulfur interactions, are in this configuration about 3.5 Å. Thus the dye molecules can form rather compact molecular diagonal aggregates on the TiO2 surface (bottom of Fig. 5), with the π frameworks of different dyes partly interacting. However, a close packing between such diagonal aggregates is effectively impeded by the transthiocyanate configuration, which imposes rather long distances between molecules belonging to different “diagonals”, with about 10 Å separation between the π frameworks of the interacting belts. This aggregation pattern leaves plenty of empty space on the TiO2 surface for close approach of the species present in the electrolyte (Li+/I2/I−) to the surface, possibly impacting the overall photovoltaic performances of the corresponding devices. A proper molecular engineering of the complex ligands is therefore required to alleviate this issue.
Photovoltaic data
The photovoltaic performance of N1044 has been explored by using a double layer (20-nm particle layer + diffusive/reflective layer) photo-anode configuration of anatase TiO2. Chenodeoxycholic acid was added to the DMF solution of the dye as a co-adsorbing agent to prevent an excessive formation of dye aggregates both in solution and on the nanostructured film. As outlined in the previous paragraph, one issue is the computed low driving force for electron injection from the dye excited state to the CB of TiO2. We have therefore selected a t-butylpyridine (TBP)-free electrolyte including LiI (A6979) in order to position the Fermi-level of TiO2 adequately below the excited state of the dye and thus assure sufficient charge injection yield. Fig. 6 presents the Incident Photon-to-electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. The photovoltaic performance of N1044 is summarized in Table 2. The current–voltage characteristics at different sun intensities are depicted in Fig. 7.

 Fig. 7  Current–voltage plots of N1044 at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 sun. 
The N1044 complex delivers a maximum IPCE of 65% at 646 nm. Despite this value being lower than that reported for other Ru(II) sensitizers exceeding 90%,9,31 at one equivalent sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) N1044 delivers an excellent short circuit current density as high as Jsc = 19.15 mA cm−2 and a good fill factor of 0.67. Nevertheless, the low Voc leads to an overall power conversion efficiency of 5.7%. Such low Voc stems mainly from the composition of the electrolyte and is also possibly related to the dye adsorption characteristics discussed above. The presence of Li+ and the absence of TBP in the electrolyte was necessary in this case to achieve a good injection yield because of the low-lying excited state energy of N1044 dye, which would otherwise give rise to a poor overlap with TiO2 conduction band states.
The N1044 photovoltaic data can be compared with Jsc = 17.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 849 mV and ff = 0.73 which deliver a record efficiency at 1 sun of 11.2% for the prototype dye N719.9
In agreement with the measured high current density and broad absorption in the visible range, the IPCE curve shows a panchromatic response with a maximum of conversion obtained at 646 nm and still 33% efficiency at 800 nm, where the vast majority of dye sensitizers have zero or negligible response. It should be noted how the IPCE tail is recorded up to 910 nm, that is deeply inside in the NIR region. A bathochromic shift of about 30 nm is found as a consequence of the dye absorption onto the TiO2 surface, which entails the formation of carboxylate group as well as on the difference of solvation shell strength when using acetonitrile/valeronitrile-based electrolytes.
As mentioned above, the poor Voc can be possibly related to the dye interaction with TiO2, whereby the loose packing between dye aggregates would lead to empty spaces for oxidized species in the electrolyte (e.g. I2) to access the TiO2 surface, thus leading to increased recombination between injected electrons and the electrolyte. We can also speculate that this class of dyes might generally suffer from recombination between injected electrons and the oxidized dye cation, since the dye HOMO, localized across the metal–NCS groups, lies close to the surface with little screening from the dye aromatic ligands, Fig. 8, conversely shows what happens in N719 whereby the dye HOMO is localized opposite to the TiO2 surface, and is screened by the aromatic ligands contacting the surface, which possibly form an insulating barrier towards recombination.

Conclusions
A new panchromatic trans-di-thiocyanato Ru(II) sensitizer, coded N1044, based on a π-donor heteroaromatic substituted qpy ligand has been synthesized, characterized and tested in DSC devices. The absorption spectrum covers the UV and the entire visible spectrum, providing the new dye with an effective panchromatic response, comparable to that of the efficient black dye sensitizer. Electrochemical and computational investigations have revealed that the introduction of the EDOT-vinylene conjugated substituent on the qpy core simultaneously raises the HOMO and lowers the LUMO energy level with respect to representative bpy and qpy dyes. This in turn is converted into a significantly lower energy gap of ca. 2 eV (vs 2.3 eV of reference bpy and qpy dyes), which delivers a superior light harvesting potential at low energies of the solar spectrum.
The complex panchromatic absorption spectrum is translated into a broad IPCE curve when employed in DSCs, with good conversion efficiency throughout the entire visible range and still 33% response up to the NIR region, providing high photocurrent densities. A problem with the current sensitizer appears to be the low driving force for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band, which forced us to use a modified electrolyte composition in order to position the semiconductor conduction band edge below the excited state of the dye. This in turn leads, together with a possible non-optimal dye interaction and packing on the TiO2 surface, to decreased photovoltages which prevented us from reaching overall high solar cell efficiencies. The investigation of new qpy ligands endowed with tailored substituents to raise the dye excited state oxidation potential is in progress.

Mass spectra of N1044 were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan Advantage Max Ion Trap Spectrometer in negative ion acquiring mode. IR spectra of N1044 were recorded in a solid-phase powder using an ATR-FTIR Shimadzu spectrometer 8400. The ATR data reported here were taken with the “Golden Gate” diamond-anvil ATR accessory. Flash chromatography was performed with Merck grade 9385 silica gel 230–400 mesh (60 Å). Reactions were performed under nitrogen in oven dried glassware and monitored by thin layer chromatography using UV light (254 and 365 nm) as visualizing agent. All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers at the highest purity grade and used without further purification. Extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered before removal of the solvent by evaporation.
Synthesis


            2-(2-Bromopyrid-4-yl)-1-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)ethanol (4). 

4-Methyl-2-bromopyridine (450 mg, 2.64 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (10 mL) and the resulting mixture was cooled to −78 °C. LDA (1.76 mL, 1.8 M solution in THF, 3.17 mmol) was added dropwise and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at the same temperature. A solution of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-2-carboxaldehyde34 (500 mg, 2.94 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. AcOEt (120 mL) and water (120 mL) were added and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with water (2 × 150 mL), dried, and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. Flash chromatography of the residue (silica gel, petroleum ether/AcOEt 1:1) afforded 4 as a yellow oil (850 mg, 2.48 mmol, 94%), which was used without further purification in the next step; 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.23 (d, J = 5.0, 1H), 7.38 (s, 1H), 7.10 (d, J = 5.0, 1H), 6.29 (s, 1H), 5.18 (t, J = 6.7, 1H), 4.20–4.05 (m, 4H), 3.20–2.95 (m, 2H).



            2-Bromo-4-[2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]pyridine (3). 

Alcohol
4 (800 mg, 2.34 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (3 mL). POCl3 (327 μL, 538 mg, 3.51 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was cooled to −78 °C. Upon addition of water (40 mL) the formation of a precipitate was observed. The cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. A precipitate was obtained which was collected upon filtration and washed with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (20 mL, 1:1) affording the crude product as a yellow solid (380 mg, 1.17 mmol, 50%), which was used without further purification in the next step; mp 127–129 °C; 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.27 (d, J = 5.2, 1H), 7.51 (s, 1H), 7.34 (d, J = 16.1, 1H), 7.25 (d, J = 5.2, 1H), 6.70 (d, J = 16.1, 1H), 6.38 (s, 1H), 4.35–4.33 (m, 2H), 4.27–4.25 (m, 2H).



            4-[2-(3,4-Ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-2-(trimethylstannyl)pyridine (2). 

Hexamethyldistannane (230 μL, 365 mg, 1.11 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (20 mg, 0.017 mmol) was added to a solution of the bromoderivative 3 (325 mg, 1.00 mmol) in degassed anhydrous toluene (20 mL) and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 12 h. Water (100 mL) and AcOEt (100 mL) were added and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with water (5 × 100 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to afford the product 2 as a colourless oil (355 mg, 0.87 mmol, 87%) which was used without further purification in the next step.



            4,4′′′-Bis[2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-4′,4′′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine (1). 

            4-[2-(3,4-Ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-2-(trimethylstannyl)pyridine (2) (355 mg, 0.87 mmol) and 6,6′-dibromo-4,4′-methoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine13 (185 mg, 0.43 mmol) were dissolved in degassed anhydrous toluene (20 mL). Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (10 mg, 0.009 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture refluxed for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature a solid was obtained which was collected upon filtration and extensively washed with CH2Cl2, AcOEt, and acetone to yield the product 1 as a pale yellow powder (140 mg, 0.18 mmol, 42%); 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 9.09 (s, 2H), 8.95 (s, 2H), 8.72 (d, J = 5.1, 2H), 8.61 (s, 2H), 7.62 (d, J = 5.0, 2H), 7.55 (d, J = 16.1, 2H), 7.03 (d, J = 16.0, 2H), 6.73 (s, 2H), 4.42–4.38 (m, 4H), 4.31–4.26 (m, 4H), 4.09 (s, 6 H); HRMSm/z 759.1591 (MH+ requires 759.1578).



Trans-dithiocyanato [Ru(4,4′′′-bis[(E)-2-(3,4-ethylenedioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-4′,4′′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine)] (N1044). 
A mixture of 4,4′′′-bis[2-(3,4-ethylene dioxythien-2-yl)vinyl]-4′,4′′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine (1) (140 mg, 0.18 mmol) and dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer (56 mg, 0.09 mmol) were dissolved in argon degassed DMF (50 mL) and the resulting solution was heated at 140 °C for 4 h under reduced light. A water solution (2 mL) of KNCS (0.8 g, 8.2 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was heated for a further 6 h at 130 °C. Triethylamine (10 mL) and water (5 mL) were added and the solution was refluxed for 24 h to hydrolyze the ester groups on the quaterpyridine ligand. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was precipitated from water. The solid was isolated upon filtration, washed with water and diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum resulting in a dark green powder (0.179 mmol). The crude N1044 complex was dissolved in methanol (5 mL) containing one equivalent of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide to confer solubility by deprotonating one of the carboxylic COOH groups. After filtration through a sintered glass crucible (G4), the solution was charged onto a methanol conditioned Sephadex LH-20 column that was eluted with methanol. The main band was collected and the pH solution was lowered to 3.1 using 0.02 M HNO3 acid. The resulting solution was kept at −8 °C for 15 h and the precipitate was collected by filtration and air-dried. The isolated pure complex had very low solubility, and thus no preparative HPLC nor 13C NMR could be performed; 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 9.54 (d, 2H), 9.25 (s, 2H), 9.09 (s, 2H), 8.04–7.95 (m, 4H), 7.17–7.13 (m, 4H), 6.81 (s, 2H), 4.42–4.31 (d broad, 8H); MSm/z 948 (MH+ requires 948).

Device fabrication
A screen-printed double layer thick film of interconnected TiO2 particles on NSG10 TCO glass (Nippon Sheet Glass) was used as photo-anode. An 8-μm thick transparent layer composed of 20-nm anatase TiO2 particles has been sheltered by a more diffusive/reflective layer of ca. 6 μm thickness (Dyesol DSL 18NR-AO) which enrols small and scattering particles. Electrodes were sensitized for 12 h in a solution containing a concentration of ca. 250 μM of dye in DMF and an equivalent proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid as a de-aggregating agent. After being washed with acetonitrile and dried under an air flow, the sensitized electrodes were assembled with the counter electrode by melting a 25 μm thick Surlyn gasket. The Pt-loaded TEC15 TCO counter electrode was prepared by spreading out a drop of 5 mM (H2PtCl6) ethanolic solution and then heating the Pt-TCO at 400 °C during 15 min under air. The internal space between the working (i.e. photo-anode) and the counter electrodes was filled with volatile t-butylpyridine-free A6979 electrolyte using a vacuum backfilling system (0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile/valeronitrile 85/15% by volume). The hole, prior made by sand-blasting, was sealed with a melted Surlyn sheet.

UV-vis and differential cyclic voltamperometry

UV-vis spectra were collected on a Cary 5 spectrophotometer using a 1-cm path length quartz cell containing a 10−5 mol L−1dye concentration in DMF. Electrochemical data were recorded using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT 30. For this, differential pulse voltamperogram experiments were realized using three electrodes of Pt while ferrocene (Fc) was used as an internal reference. All of the electrochemical measurements were realized in the presence of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte support salt in DMF.
Photovoltaic characterization
A 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to provide an incident irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cell. The spectral output of the lamp was filtered using a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany). Light mismatch between real solar illumination and the simulated one was evaluated to less than 2%. Light intensities were regulated with wire mesh attenuators. The (J–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter by applying independently external voltage to the cell and by measuring the photo-generated current supplied. Incident Photon-to-current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) measurements were realized using a 300 W xenon light source (ILC Technology, USA). A Gemini-180 double monochromator Jobin Yvon Ltd. (UK) was used to select and increment wavelength irradiation to the cell.
Computational investigation
Geometry optimizations of the protonated and fully deprotonated N1044 complexes were performed in water solution by using a 3-21G* basis set. Geometry optimizations as well as TDDFT calculations were performed by the B3LYP functional.43 Solvation effects were included on both geometry optimizations and TDDFT calculations by means of the polarizable continuum model of solvation (C-PCM).44,45 For simplicity, we considered water as a solvent. DFT calculations were performed by using the DZVP basis sets46 as implemented in the Gaussian03 program package.47 DFT calculations on the adsorption of N1044 on TiO2 were performed by means of the Car–Parrinello method,48 using the PBE functional,49 a plane-wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudopotentials,50 as implemented in the Quantum-Espresso program package.50
