    , Accepted 10th February 2020First published on 11th February 2020AbstractCellulose nanopaper (CNP) was successfully demonstrated for enhanced efficiency and effective wide-angle light capturing in organic solar cells (OSCs). The highest power-conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved was up to 16.17%, which is one of the best results for natural materials for OSC use. The effective wide-angle harvesting was demonstrated in the range from −45 to 45 degrees. Importantly, when the incident angle is 45°, the JSC value with CNP was 21.18 mA cm−2, while the corresponding JSC value without CNP was only 15.11 mA cm−2: an increase of ∼40% was observed. The present PCEs were found to be enhanced from 9.12% to 12.78%.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively studied in the past two decades owing to their special advantages of being cost effective, flexible and possessing large area processability.1–4 So far, the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state-of-the-art OSCs has been demonstrated to be 17.3% at the laboratory scale.5 However, the PCEs are still less than that of the silicon and perovskite solar cells owing to the limited absorption of the active layer.6 In this regard, the development of novel materials and devices with enhanced light capturing is highly desirable.
To increase the light harvesting of the active layer, feasible strategies have been proposed including the design and synthesis of novel active-layer materials with a high absorptive coefficient,7,8 the increased thickness of the active-layer,9,10 and the introduction of light-trapped structures on the side of incident light.11,12 Among them, light trapping is thought to be an alternative promising choice owing to the intrinsically short exciton diffusion length and low absorption coefficient in these organic materials. To date, the introduction of nanostructures has been extensively investigated to increase the absorption of solar cells, including back-contact architectures,13 surface coatings,14 contact cloaking,15 and metallic nanoparticles.16,17 In particular, these metallic nanoparticles as light trapping centres are popular owing to the simple processability and the prolonged optical paths of incident light.18,19 Generally, these metallic nanoparticles will significantly improve electro-magnetic fields close to the dielectric–metal interface, forming hybridization of the cavity and Bloch modes.20 For example, Yu et al. reported a cooperative plasmonic effect for improving the performance of polymer solar cells by mixing Ag and Au nanoparticles into the anode buffer layer.21 Kim and co-workers demonstrated plasmonic metal–carbon nanotube hybrids enhanced light-harvesting and device efficiency for OSCs.22 However, the exciton generation and dissociation of the active layer were largely affected by incorporating these metallic nanoparticles into the OSCs owing to the resulting exciton quenching. Moreover, a large number of surfactants and solvents were used to avoid the aggregation of metallic nanoparticles, leading to serious environmental problems.23,24 Therefore, the development of novel light-trapping with sustainable and green materials to avoid exciton quenching is still a tremendous challenge for highly efficient OSCs.
Recently, cellulose based materials have been used in many fields of new optoelectronic devices, including the electrode,25 interfacial layer,26 flexible substrate of solar cells,27 dielectric layer,28 thin-film transistors (TFTs),29 and so on. Transparent cellulose nanopaper (CNP), prepared from agroforestry residues, is a renewable and eco-friendly material, which shows an adjustable transmission haze, high thermostability, low oxygen permeability, and preferable optical transparency.30 Furthermore, the tuneable optical haze in these cellulose nanopapers (CNPs) is beneficial to improving the light scattering and absorption, indicating the potential for the fabrication of light-trapping devices, especially OSCs. However, all of them are very sensitive to moisture owing to the hydrophilic nature of the cellulose and the porosity of CNPs, limiting their applications.31,32 On the other hand, owing to the coexistence of inherent crystalline and non-crystalline structures in the cellulose in these CNPs, it is beneficial for the harvesting of oblique incident light to achieve a wide angle absorption owing to the different refractive index of the cellulose itself.33 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few publications on the utilization of CNPs for effective wide-angle light-trapping and enhanced efficiency of OSCs.34
In this work, we demonstrate the successful use of a green, water-resistant CNP with a high transparency and haze for the optical trapping of OSCs, made of tobacco stalk from agroforestry residues. In our devices, the prepared CNP is employed as a trapped architecture on the incident light side. A blend of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl)-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6) and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno-[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo-[3,2-g] thieno[2′,3′:4,5] thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis-(methanylylidene))bis-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)) dimalononitrile (Y6) were used as the photoactive layer, the details are shown in Scheme 1. Compared to the cells without CNP (15.41%), the highest PCE obtained had a value of 16.17%, which is one of the highest efficiencies based on natural materials. Furthermore, the CNP based devices show wide-angle light capturing at the incident angle that ranged from −45° to 45°. When the incident angle is 45°, the JSC with CNP is 21.18 mA cm−2, while the JSC without CNP is only 15.11 mA cm−2, and an increase of ∼40% is observed. The corresponding power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these were found to be enhanced from 9.12% to 12.78%. The improved efficiency and capture angle are attributed to the synergy between the light-scattering and the different refractive index of the cellulose itself with the effective trapping of light. This investigation opens up a new route for the development of highly efficient and wide-angle light-capturing OSCs with eco-friendly biomaterials. Moreover, our results also exploit a novel application for the use of agricultural and forestry residues.

The CNP with effective light trapping was prepared from tobacco stalk from agroforestry residues. Tobacco stalk was cooked in a solution of ammonium sulphite (AS) (concentration: 2 wt%), then hydrolysed with formic acid (FA) and homogenized in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) to obtain cellulose nanofibrils with surface formyl groups. In the end, the nanofibrils were simply filtered in DMAc and vacuum-dried to obtain the CNP. The chemical compositions of the fabricated CNPs were fully characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a, several typical absorption peaks of cellulose were observed at ∼3400, 2900, 1720, 1640, and 1060 cm−1, which represent the stretching vibrations of the OH, C–H, CO (from formyl), adsorbed water molecular, and C–O, respectively.35,36 Furthermore, the crystallinity index (CrI) of the cellulose nanofibrils was determined using XRD to confirm the changes in the cellulose structures. Four diffraction peaks were observed at ∼14.9°, 16.3°, 22.5° and 34.5°, respectively, which are the typical patterns of cellulose I.37 According to the results of the CrI as displayed in Fig. 1a, 51.1% of the crystalline cellulose I was found in the prepared CNPs, the remaining parts were almost entirely made up of amorphous regions of cellulose, resulting in a different refractive index. This is a prerequisite for the achievement of wide-angle light trapping. In Fig. 1b, the homogeneous shape and size were observed owing to the efficient delignification, the present height of the cellulose nanofibrils is mainly around 5 nm and the length is more than 10 μm, which is beneficial to forming a scattering centre and achieving light management. To employ these CNPs for trapping on the incident light side of OSCs, their transmittance and optical haze were investigated using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometry in Fig. 1c and S1† with different thicknesses. Owing to the well-matched transmittance and haze in the CNP with a thickness of 20 μm (CNP-20), CNP-20 was chosen to study their photophysical and photochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 1c, a high haze over 75% (average value from 300–1000 nm) is seen in the CNP-20, while the corresponding transmittance is above 90%. For the optical trapping, the transmittance based on CNP-20 fitted onto the ITO glass was also investigated, it can be observed that the transmittance is slightly higher than that of the ITO glass, and the haze changes only a little with the value of ∼70%, implying an enhanced light absorption for the OSCs. Thus, an increase in the short circuit current density (JSC) will be achieved. As shown in Fig. S2,† the transmittance is significantly improved in the range from 600 to 1000 nm, which is located in the absorptive region of PM6/Y6 and will create an increased JSC on the fabricated solar cells. The angular dependence of the transmittance is also thought to be of interest for the harvesting of oblique incident light from the sun. The effect of the CNPs on sunlight transmittance with various incident light angles is shown in Fig. 1d, the transmittance changed slightly (less than 20%) as the angles change from −45° to 45°, especially in the range of 600 to 900 nm, indicating excellent wide-angle light-capturing. The corresponding transmittance of ITO glass is shown in Fig. S3.† It can be seen that the present CNP-20/ITO is much better than that of ITO glass.

The surface morphologies of CNP-20 were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 2. The topographic (Fig. 2a) and 3-dimensional (3D) (Fig. 2b) images of CNP-20 display variations in the height and with some pits of 60–75 nm, the root-means-square (rms) roughness of the CNPs is 18.6 nm and the peak to peak roughness is 180 nm, the formed structures will create effective waveguides located in the front of the solar cells.38 As shown in Fig. 2c, the phase image shows a different appearance representing the CNP-20 structures resulting from the interlaced crystalline/amorphous regions and the nanofibers. To glue the CNP-20 onto the OSCs with waterborne polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the water-resistant properties of CNP-20 were also considered to be very important and were investigated by immersing them in a water solution (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. S4,† the shape and size were found to be almost the same after 100 days. The excellent water resistance is attributed to the local swelling or partial dissolution of cellulose in the DMAc solvent during homogenization, and its regeneration by hydrogen bond re-formation in the subsequent CNP-20 fabrication (vacuum filtration and drying), which fills the voids of the dry CNP-20 and forms a compact film. On the other hand, the hydroxyls of cellulose can react with FA to generate a cellulose format during hydrolysis, thus introducing surface ester groups (formyl) on CNF-20. Therefore, the resultant CNP-20 with surface ester groups also have good water resistance, as reported previously.35 In summary, the results reveal that the prepared CNPs have potential applications in OSCs as light-trapping structures.

The conventional OSCs were fabricated with the construction of CNP-20/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Y6/PDIN/Ag by using CNP as a light-trapping layer. For comparison, cells without the CNP layer were also fabricated. The characteristics of the current density–voltage (J–V) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) are exhibited in Fig. 3, and some critical parameters for these devices are outlined in Table 1. The solar cell without the CNP-20 layer exhibits a JSC of 25.61 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 70.28%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.856 V, and a PCE of 15.41%, which is in good agreement with previous publications.39,40 By employing the CNP-20 layer on ITO glass, a positive effect on the performance of OSCs was observed. The PCE was significantly improved to 16.17% with a JSC of 26.48 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.858 V, and an FF of 71.17%, respectively. The devices with CNP as a light-trapping layer have shown an appreciable increase of JSC and a slight increase in the FF. The JSC of the cells with the CNP-20 layer is 26.48 mA cm−2, which is ∼3.4% higher than that of the devices without the CNP layer (JSC = 25.61 mA cm−2), bringing about an enhancement in the PCE values (16.17% vs. 15.41%). The improved JSC is ascribed to the enhanced light absorption by the active layer with the introduction of the CNPs, which is consistent with the results of the transmittance and haze. By introducing CNP-20 to the devices, those with high haze exhibit a better performance than that of the pristine ITO-based ones, revealing CNPs are a potential light trapping structure for OSCs. In the meantime, devices with CNP-10 (10 μm) and CNP-30 (30 μm) were fabricated, the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S5† and some important parameters are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the introduction of the CNPs is of benefit to the improvement of the JSC, which is consistent with the above-discussed results for transmittance and haze. Moreover, the device performance of CNP-20 is the best among the CNPs-based devices investigated.

The dark J–V characteristics of these devices were also studied. As shown in Fig. 3b, the dark currents of the devices with or without CNP-20 are almost the same in the reverse-biased regions, and the cells with CNP-20 show reduced currents in the forward-biased regions. In the reverse-biased regions, the same densities are due to the embedded CNPs, which do not participate in charge transfer and collection. In Fig. 3b, a higher current density is observed for the CNP-based devices, indicating the decrease of the series resistance as a result of the involved CNP layer. This means there is an increased amount of electron transfer from the active layer to the electrode interface. Although the increased number of electrons is from the improvement in the light absorption and carrier generation in the active layer. The EQE curves of the OSCs with/without the CNP-20 layer are plotted in Fig. 3c. For the devices based on CNP-20 for light-trapping, it can be observed that the EQE is higher than that of the cells without the CNP layer, indicating a highly efficient photoelectron conversion process in these devices. The calculated JSC from the integration of the EQE curves is 26.41 mA cm−2 (CNP-20/glass/ITO-based devices) and 25.51 mA cm−2 (glass/ITO-based devices), respectively, which is in good agreement with the measured JSC values from the J–V curves. The higher EQE values obtained from the devices with the CNP layer are attributed to the improved absorption produced by the promoted transmission haze of the CNP layer. A histogram of 40 cells prepared independently (Fig. 3d) exhibits excellent reproducibility with an average PCE value of 15.99% for the devices with CNP and 15.23% for the cells without CNP.
Furthermore, the J–V characteristics of the devices with different light intensities from 0.1 to 1.1 sun were also studied as shown in Fig. 4a and b, and the key parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The measured JSC in the devices with the CNP layer depends on the intensity of the incident light, and is satisfied with the formula of JSC ∝ Iβ, in which β is an exponential factor.41 Generally, the value of β is typically between 0.75 and 1, a deviation of β below unity is closely associated with non-geminate recombination in the devices.42 By fitting them with this formula, the β of the fabricated devices is 0.99, indicating more carriers are swept out prior to recombination. Likewise, the correlation between the VOC and light intensity is plotted in Fig. 4b, which is in accordance with the formula of VOC ∝ nkTln(I)/q, in which k, T, I and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in kelvin, the light intensity and the elementary charge, respectively. A slope of 1.18 kT/q is calculated for the devices by using the CNP layer as the trapping configuration. The VOC-light intensity of close to kT/q shows that the non-geminate recombination becomes the domination process in these devices.

For investigation of the wide-angle light harvesting, EQE measurements with changed angles of incident light were tested as shown in Fig. 4c. An acceptable decrease in the EQE can be observed when the incident light is altered in the range of −45° to 45°. When the incident light is transformed to 15°, the integrated JSC from the EQE curves is found to be slightly reduced by comparison with that of the perpendicular incident light. As the angle is increased to 30°, the integrated JSC is also kept at ∼93%. Even when the incident angle is enlarged to 45°, the integrated JSC from the EQE curve is still over 80% of the vertical incident light. This can be explained by the fact that the CNP can effectively reduce the reflection of incident light on the glass surface. Although the corresponding results from the pristine glass/ITO gives a gradient decrease in the EQE intensities, as shown in Fig. S6.† Similar anti-reflection phenomena are also observed in photovoltaic devices with textured surfaces or micro structure arrays.43,44 In addition, the dependence of the normalized photocurrent of the OSCs with or without CNP on the light incident angle is shown in Fig. 4d and Table S2.† For the incident light with variant angles, the photocurrent generated by the device with CNP is greater than that generated by the cell without CNP. In particular, it is worth noting that the entire photocurrent from the device with CNP is ∼18% higher than that of the cells without CNP, meaning the strong light scattering effect of the CNP gives an incident angle with a wide-angle distribution. In particular, it can be seen that when the incident angle is 45°, the JSC with CNP-20 is 21.18 mA cm−2, and the JSC without CNP-20 is only 15.11 mA cm−2, an increase of ∼40% is observed. The achieved PCE values of these are enhanced from 9.12% to 12.78%, which also shows an enhancement of ∼40% efficiency. In addition, the device performance with different incident angles and thicknesses of CNPs are also provided in Table S3.† It can be observed that the wide-angle light harvesting of CNP-20 is better than that of CNP-10 and CNP-30.
To further investigate the light scattering and wide-angle light capturing of CNP-20, Fig. 5 shows the Raman volume maps which reveal the spatial distribution of the crystalline and amorphous regions of cellulose. As shown in Fig. 5a–g in the vertical direction, the Raman images with red and green regions are from the crystalline cellulose with a high concentration, owing to the concentration dependent intensities of the Raman peaks. Likewise, similar results are observed in the cross section of the CNPs as displayed in Fig. 5h–m. Notably, the change in the crystalline and amorphous regions in the CNPs is expected to guide the propagation of light, and then gains a wide angle and improved light collection. The distribution of the crystalline and amorphous regions of cellulose appear uniform in the film of CNP-20, and the concentration of the crystalline regions of the cellulose reduced gradually as the Raman measured depth increased. Furthermore, a single cellulose with different crystalline states will effectively avoid the phase separation, while the introduction of the metallic nanoparticles into the interstitial space will certainly result in the phenomena of phase separation. On the other hand, the Raman spectra with an interval of a 2 μm depth is summarized in Fig. 5n, two characteristic peaks located at 380 and 1092 cm−1 were observed, which are from the β-glucosides and the asymmetric stretching vibration of the C–O–C glycosidic bands of cellulose I, respectively. According to the correlated equation,45 the calculated highest content of crystalline cellulose I in CNP is ∼50.7%, which is in good agreement with the results of the CrI measurements using XRD.

Conclusions
We demonstrated for the first time the successful utilization of biodegradable, renewable, and sustainable CNP for OSCs for light trapping and wide-angle capture; the CNP was made from tobacco stalks from agroforestry residues. The chemical compositions, optical properties, and surface morphologies were investigated, and the results showed simultaneously high light transmittance and haze for CNP-20 with values of ∼90% and ∼75%, respectively. Furthermore, wide-angle light harvesting was observed with this CNP. We fabricated OSCs with CNP as the light-trapping layer on the incident light side; the resulting device shows a high PCE with a value of 16.17%, which is one of the best results reported for OSCs using natural materials. Interestingly, wide-angle harvesting was observed in the range from −45 to 45 degrees. The improved efficiency and light capturing are attributed to the synergy between the light-scattering and the intrinsic different refractive index of cellulose itself. These findings are of great importance for the rational design of OSCs from light trapping and wide-angle capture perspectives. Moreover, CNP made from tobacco stalks will also enable a new era in paper photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics.
