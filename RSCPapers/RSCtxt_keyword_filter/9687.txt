    , Accepted 22nd August 2020First published on 24th August 2020AbstractMultichromophoric systems with efficient photoinduced excited-state processes are important for the conversion of solar energy in artificial photosynthesis. However, a low molecular absorption coefficient of these multichromophoric systems in the near-infrared region limits their power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells. It is critical to design molecules with a broad absorption range in the whole spectral region, to better harvest solar energy, and to reveal their important multiple-step photophysical processes for the design of organic solar cells. Here, we investigate a novel compound having three chromophores, namely two near-by N,N′-bis(1-pentyl)hexyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebiscarboximide (PDI) units linked to a zinc porphyrin core side by side (in the form of PDI–ZnPor–PDI), which absorbs solar energy ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared regions. The photophysical behavior of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in both film and solution forms, has been investigated using steady-state and transient spectroscopy measurements. Charge-transfer species and triplet excited-state species are observed, the excited-state evolutions of which are monitored using molecular vibrations as probes. These observations support the idea that PDI–ZnPor–PDI on photoexcitation generates the radical anion and triplet species of the PDI unit (PDI˙− and 3PDI*). Our results demonstrate the effect of solid film state on the photophysical properties in such multichromophoric system, and are valuable for guiding the design and utilization of novel near-infrared electron donors or acceptors for use in organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
In natural photosynthesis, chromophores absorb sunlight and then transport the solar energy to the reaction center for photosynthesis. Efficient photoinduced multiple-step processes, such as excited-state energy transfer and charge transfer reactions, are important in the photo-synthesis system.1 This has attracted great interest from researchers to duplicate these processes in artificial photo-synthesis systems.2,3 For example, multichromophoric systems composed of electron donors and acceptors have been designed to mimic the light harvesting process of photosynthesis.4–6 More importantly, these multichromophoric systems have already been reported as efficient sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells, and as electron donors or acceptors in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs).7
Pigments that perform light-harvesting and energy transduction processes are essential for artificial photo-synthesis systems. The porphyrin derivatives exhibit strong absorption, a high level of stability and sufficient solubility.8 Because of their outstanding spectroscopic properties, chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are the naturally occurring photosynthetic pigments,9 while other porphyrin derivatives have been widely used in the construction of multichromophoric systems to mimic natural photosynthesis.10 On the other hand, the perylene derivatives possess well-suited properties such as a high molar extinction coefficient,11–13 electron mobility14–17 and have been used in a variety of photoactive supramolecular systems as an electrochemical material.18,19 Particularly, the intense absorption bands of perylene derivatives are between porphyrin's Soret band and Q bands, thus they can enhance the usage of solar energy. Owing to the theoretically possible photoinduced electron transfer and energy transfer processes between porphyrin and perylene, they have been widely used in building multichromophoric systems. For example, the reported motif relies on a perylene-monoimide attached to a porphyrin via an ethynl linker.20 In most of such multichromophoric systems, the molecular components are connected by covalent linkages (usually through the meso positions of the porphyrin ring).21 A porphyrin can be strongly coupled to two perylene-monoimides via ethynl linkages.22 Recently, Lindsey and his co-workers have prepared molecules composed of two perylenes attached to a free base porphyrin.23,24 Other synthetic approaches also lead to various kinds of multiporphyrin assemblies. Their synthesis relies on a building block approach, wherein constituent chromophores are synthesized separately and then joined together.25–28 In particular, a series of multichromophoric molecules have already been developed to create materials with a broad absorption range from the UV–Visible to near-infrared spectral regions.23,24,28–31 For example, a star-shaped electron acceptor based on porphyrin with perylene bisimide as end groups exhibits complementary absorption with a red-shifted near-infrared absorption and high photovoltaic performance.30 Our co-workers have also constructed porphyrin-based small molecular near-infrared acceptors with different side groups attached to the porphyrin core to achieve optimized performance.32
Although materials based on perylene and porphyrin components with extended spectral coverage have been constructed, the low absorption coefficient of these multichromophoric molecules in the near-IR region limits their power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells. Since the near-infrared region covers more than a half of the solar spectrum, it is critical to design molecules with broad coverage with enhanced near-infrared absorption. Moreover, the photophysical behavior of these near-IR electron donor or acceptor materials are essential for the understanding and designing of organic solar cells. Pump–probe femtosecond transient infrared (fs-IR) spectroscopy is a very effective tool for monitoring structures and dynamics of molecular systems at their electronic excited states.33 The CO stretching vibration is sensitive to the structural and/or charge changes in the electronic excited-state molecular species and can be used to directly monitor ultrafast photo-physical or chemical events. Recently, the fs-IR spectroscopy has also been used to probe the excited-state dynamics of a rylene family member by using its strongly IR active CO modes.34–36
Here, we report a new material with three chromophores, where two N,N′-bis(1-pentyl)hexyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebiscarboximide (PDI) units are linked to a conjugated framework of a zinc porphyrin core (ZnPor) and form a PDI–ZnPor–PDI structure. The designed PDI–ZnPor–PDI complex in this work has a light-absorbing band expanding to 1000 nm and works as an electron acceptor with a relatively high photovoltaic performance. To understand the photophysical processes that occur in both the film and solution states of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system, we carried out experimental studies by photoexciting the PDI units of this system. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements provide information on the energy-transfer processes, via the kinetics, and on the charge-transfer processes, via the spectral evolution. The charge-transfer and triplet species of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system were observed using the femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy analyses. Furthermore, the corresponding rate constants of the excited-state processes of PDI–ZnPor–PDI were obtained both in the film and solution states. Through these experiments, we demonstrate the structural origin of the extended spectral absorption and propose a photophysical mechanism for the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system. Our results provide a deep understanding of the ultrafast excited-state energy and structural processes of such near-IR electron acceptors, and also inspire the design and utilization of multichromophoric materials in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation

N,N′-Bis(1-pentyl)hexyl-3,4,9,10-perylenebiscarboximide (PDI) and PDI–ZnPor–PDI sample were synthesized via a Sonogashira coupling reaction by using bis(3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl) zinc porphyrin and monobromo perylene bisimide as previously described.37 The reaction takes place with Pd(PPh3)4/CuI as the catalyst and THF/triethylamine as the solvent at 80 °C for 12 h. Both the PDI and zinc porphyrin solutions each at a concentration of 4 × 10−6 mol L−1 were placed in a four-way colorimeter for the UV-vis absorption measurement. The PDI–ZnPor–PDI in CHCl3 at a concentration of 5 × 10−5 mol L−1 was also placed in a four-way colorimeter for the nanosecond transient experiment. PDI–ZnPor–PDI was dissolved in CHCl3 to give concentrations: 2 mg mL−1, 10 mg mL−1 and 20 mg mL−1 for the fs-IR experiments. The PDI, zinc porphyrin and PDI–ZnPor–PDI solutions at concentrations of 4 × 10−5 mol L−1, 4 × 10−6 mol L−1 and 7 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively, were used for steady-state fluorescence measurement. For the film preparation, a 10 mg mL−1 solution of PDI–ZnPor–PDI was dropped onto a 2 mm thick CaF2 substrate. The temperature of substrate was heated to about 50 °C, and the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film sample was obtained by spin-coating the 10 mg mL−1 sample solution onto the 2 mm thick CaF2 substrate at the speed of 500 rpm. The size of the sample was about 1.0 * 0.5 cm2 and its color was dark brown. The thickness of the obtained sample was found to be about 3 μm, which was measured by using a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer.
For the steady-state and transient infrared spectroscopy measurements described below, each solution sample was loaded into a home-made IR sample cell consisting of two 2 mm thick CaF2 IR optical windows with a 200 μm thick Teflon spacer, whereas the film samples were used directly as prepared. For the steady-state UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and nanosecond transient measurements, the sample cell was 10 mm thick.
2.2. Quantum chemical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on a single PDI molecule in the implicit solvent (CHCl3) at the B3LYP level with the 6-31g* basis set using Gaussian09,38 in an effort to understand the infrared vibrational spectroscopy signature of the PDI unit. A frequency scaling factor of 0.967 was used for the calculated IR spectrum. The vibrational spectrum of the radical anion of the single PDI molecule in gas was also calculated. In addition, the infrared vibrational spectrum analysis of the excited state of the single PDI molecule was carried out using the time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31g* level.
2.3. Steady-state spectroscopy
The visible absorption spectra of the samples were measured using a U2910 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi) with a 2 nm resolution and 25 scan average. Static fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorospectrophotometer excited at 530 nm and 430 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectra were measured using a 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Electron) with 1 cm−1 resolution and 64 scan average. Both spectroscopy experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C).
2.4. Transient absorption experiments
A femtosecond (fs) visible laser pulse and a fs mid-infrared laser pulse were used to carry out the fs pump–probe experiment and collect a series of transient infrared (fs-IR) spectra.39 Briefly, an ultrafast Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, 35 fs pulse width, 3 mJ per pulse and 800 nm central wavelength, was used to pump two optical parametric amplifiers (OPA). One OPA provides a mid-IR pulse in the 1500–1750 cm−1 frequency region and was used as the probe pulse in the fs-IR experiment, while the other OPA generates a pulse at 530 nm wavelength and was used as the pump pulse. Both pulses are linearly polarized. The delay time between the pump and probe pulses is controlled by a motorized linear translation stage. The IR probe pulse was focused on the samples with a 100 μm diameter spot size, while the visible pump had a larger spot size (ca. 250 μm) on the samples. Transient IR signal was collected using a liquid N2 cooled 64-element mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) array detector equipped with an IR monochromator. The relative polarization direction of the pump and probe beams was carefully set under the magic angle (54.7°) condition for all the transient spectroscopy measurements. The pump-pulse excitation power was typically set to 0.2 mW (0.2 μJ per pulse).
Nanosecond transient absorption spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh LP-920 pump–probe spectrometer setup. The sample was excited at 532 nm and probed at 485 nm. The solution was purged using nitrogen gas prior to the transient absorption spectrum measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and steady-state spectroscopy characterization
The PDI–ZnPor–PDI system (Fig. 1a) contains two PDI groups that are conjugatively coupled to a zinc porphyrin core on each side. The steady-state visible absorption spectrum of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in CHCl3 and of the film are given in Fig. 1b, and those of PDI and zinc porphyrin solutions are also shown in Fig. 1b for comparison. For the solution (red line), four distinctive peaks are observed, of which the two strong peaks and one weak peak in the 400–600 nm region are due to the Soret band of zinc porphyrin and the PDI unit.40 The absorption spectrum of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution does not correspond to the sum of its molecular components, which indicates the relatively strong interaction between the PDI and zinc porphyrin units.32 Compared to zinc porphyrin in triethylamine, the 400–500 nm region from Soret band red-shifts and one broad weaker peak in the 650–900 nm region is observed in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution, the concentration dependence of which shows no signature of aggregation (Fig. S1, ESI†). This near-IR absorption can also be found in other perylenes–porphyrin arrays, which is due to the intramolecular charge transfer between the PDI and zinc porphyrin units.24,30

The PL spectra of the PDI–Por–PDI solution are amplified for a better view. (d) Low-frequency peak-intensity normalized steady-state infrared spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in the film state (solid) and in CHCl3 (dashed) in the CO stretching region. Two peaks in the film state are blue shifted with respect to those in solution because of the lack of solvent interaction. 
The Soret band in the film state is 8 nm red-shifted, and the red-shifted near-IR band is much enhanced in intensity compared to that in solution. Previous study of the crystalline properties of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film shows strong π–π stacking of the conjugated backbone, which is a predominant “face-on” orientation.37 These spectral changes from solution to film can be the result of the strong π–π stacking of neighboring PDI–ZnPor–PDI molecules, which become closely arranged in the film state. The intensity redistribution can also been observed in different building blocks with porphyrin and PDI chromophores in the previous studies.41–43
Steady-state fluorescence spectra of PDI, zinc porphyrin and PDI–ZnPor–PDI solutions were recorded by exciting at the corresponding absorption of their porphyrin and PDI units (430 nm and 530 nm), which are shown in Fig. 1c (solid line). The fluorescence spectrum of the PDI solution consists of the (0,0) and (0,1) bands at 550 and 580 nm, which is in an approximate mirror symmetry to its corresponding steady-state visible absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1b. The fluorescence spectrum of zinc porphyrin consists of a progression extending from near 600 nm to 750 nm, which is consistent with previous studies.44,45 However, the emission properties of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution show differences from its molecular components. The emission peak of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution with the excitation of the PDI unit is neither from the PDI chromophore nor from the isolated porphyrin chromophore. It is suggested that the PDI in the excited state may transfer the hole to the zinc porphyrin instead of returning to the ground state, which leads to fluorescence quenching.46,47 Similarly, there is no characteristic emission peak for the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution excited at 430 nm, indicating the formation of a charge transfer state with the excitation of the porphyrin unit. To elucidate the energetic conditions for electron transfer in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system, the HOMO and LUMO values of PDI and porphyrin chromophores are needed. According to the electrochemical data for PDI derivatives previously reported, the corresponding HOMO energy value of −5.97 eV and LUMO value of −3.72 eV were determined for the PDI solution.48 Because the redox mainly occurs in the imide functional group of PDI, the potential differences of these PDI-based molecules reported in the literature are slightly different.19 The zinc porphyrin unit has a reported HOMO value of −5.61 eV, and a LUMO value of −3.15 eV.49 These electrochemical data show that both the HOMO and LUMO levels of porphyrin are higher than those of PDI. Thus, these values fulfill the energetic conditions required for the proposed electron transfer from zinc porphyrin to PDI. We conclude that the charge transfer state forms after the excited singlet state, which quenched the fluorescence of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. Since the emission spectrum of PDI and absorption spectrum of zinc porphyrin overlap,45 an energy transfer process cannot be ruled out for the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution completely. The substantial energy transfer from the photoexcited perylene (1PDI*) to the ground state zinc porphyrin produces the excited-state porphyrin (1Por*). However, the luminescence of the excited-state porphyrin was not observed, which indicates that another pathway may exist after the rapid energy transfer from 1PDI* to the zinc porphyrin. The most likely process is the charge transfer from the excited singlet state of zinc porphyrin to form PDI−–ZnPor+–PDI, which quenches the fluorescence of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. This fluorescence quenching process has also been observed in previously reported studies of multichromophoric systems.49
The steady-state IR absorption spectrum of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film is shown in Fig. 1d (solid line) in the CO stretching region. Two strong peaks at 1658.2 cm−1 and 1699.6 cm−1 are observed. The calculated PDI frequency spectrum using quantum-chemistry calculation was used to assign the IR modes of CO groups in the experimental FTIR spectrum. The two low frequency modes located at 1653.8 cm−1 and 1654.2 cm−1 are due to the CO asymmetric stretching modes. In detail, the former mode is strongly IR active (as–ss), the latter is weakly IR active (as–as). The other two high frequency peaks are attributed to the CO symmetric stretching modes, which are located at 1692.3 cm−1 and 1697.0 cm−1. Same as above, the former mode is strongly IR active (ss–as), the latter is weakly IR active (ss–ss).50 Thus, the low-frequency peak in Fig. 1d is assigned to the linear combination of the asymmetric CO stretching modes of one PDI unit with those of the other (as–ss), while the high-frequency peak is due to the linear combination of the symmetric CO stretching modes of the two PDI units (ss–as). Their vibrational strengths can be traced back to the PDI monomer shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 of the ESI.† In CHCl3 solution (dashed line), the peak positions of these two CO stretching modes red shift because of solvent interactions including hydrogen bond formation; for example, the CH group in the solvent is known to be a weak hydrogen bond donor.
3.2. Transient infrared measurement of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film upon PDI's photoexcitation
Femtosecond visible-pump and infrared probe (fs-IR) spectroscopy can be used to provide information on the nature of the photoinduced excited states and to study electron transfer using a structure sensitive IR chromophore, for which the CO stretching modes were chosen in this work. Fig. 2a depicts the fs-IR spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film at several delay times upon photoexcitation of its PDI unit at 530 nm. Some negative and positive features with gradually varying peak positions and intensities are shown, which can serve as signatures of the electronic excited state evolution with increasing delay time. Because of the possible involvement of multiple excited states, spectral fitting has been used to reveal the vibrational spectral features that link to each transient excited-state species. Fig. S3 (ESI†) depicts the fitting with multi-Gaussian functions: ground state and excited-state absorption. When fitting, the profile (frequency position and width) of each IR component remains the same (Table S2, ESI†) at different delay times.
 Fig. 2  (a) Femtosecond transient infrared spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film upon excitation at 530 nm (circles connected by dashed lines), at delay times of 1.5, 10.0, 50.0, 200.0 and 480.0 ps, which are vertically displaced. (b) Vibrational characteristic dynamics (circles) of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film at a typical frequency position (1698.1 cm−1) and its fitting result (red solid line). (c) Fs-IR spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution (10 mg mL−1) at several delay times upon excitation at 530 nm. (d) Vibrational characteristic features (circles) of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution at the typical frequency position (1696.4 cm−1) and its fitting results (red solid line). The fs-IR spectra at longer delay times are amplified for a better view. Arrows show the change of peak position. 
At 1.5 ps delay time, two negative vibrational features peaked at ca. 1700 cm−1 and ca. 1658 cm−1 were identified, which are due to the electronic ground state (S0) bleaching (GSB) signal of the ss–as and as–ss CO stretching modes. This indicates that the ground state population is depleted in the PDI–Por–PDI film upon photoexcitation. In addition, new excited-state absorptions are obtained at the lower-frequency side (peaked at 1666.5 cm−1 and 1634.8 cm−1), which are assigned to the ss–as and as–ss CO stretching vibrations corresponding to the formed singlet state (S1). Here, the four-component fitting is based on the observed as–ss CO mode of the S1 state and the observed ss–as CO modes of the ground state. By fitting, the overlapping ss–as CO mode of the S1 state and the as–ss CO mode of the S0 state were reasonably identified, with the latter's peak position being in reasonable agreement with that of the as–ss CO mode in the FTIR spectrum. Moreover, their calculated IR spectra of the ground state and singlet state in the frequency range of 1450–1775 cm−1 are obtained using quantum-chemistry calculation of a single PDI monomer (Fig. S4 of the ESI†), and the calculated vibrational frequency and the transition intensity of the CO stretching modes are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The calculated CO stretching modes of the singlet excited state shift to the lower frequency side in comparison to those of the ground state.
At 10.0 ps delay time, one observes that the intensity of the S1 absorption band decreases compared to the fs-IR spectrum at 1.5 ps. The vibrational absorptions are observed at a slightly lower frequency position compared to the CO mode of the S1 state. This suggests that the S1 state relaxes to some extent and produces certain new transient species on this time scale. At a much longer delay time, such as 200.0 ps, this red-shifted pair of absorption peaks still remains and bears roughly the same CO stretching spectral signatures at 480.0 ps delay time, along with a pair of reasonably intensity-balanced CO stretching signals of the S0 state. By fitting the vibrational spectrum at 480.0 ps, the absorption peaks of the new species are found to be located at 1658.6 cm−1 and 1630.1 cm−1 (Table S2, ESI†). Since the HOMO and LUMO levels of zinc porphyrin are higher than those of PDI, we attribute this new species to the appearance of PDI˙− stretching modes. The vibrational absorptions of the CO stretching modes corresponding to the S1 state and radical anion species of PDI present very similar spectral features, while the absorption frequency position of the radical anion red-shifts relative to that of the S1 state. The calculated IR spectra of the singlet state and the radical anion species are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and a red-shifted radical anion feature can be observed in the CO stretching modes compared to the S1 state absorptions. Our IR absorptions of the singlet state and radical anion in the PDI monomer are consistent with the observation of excited-state features in terrylenediimide in the mid-IR region.51
Examining the excited-state vibrational dynamics of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system is helpful to understand the photophysical process that occurs on the ultrafast time scale. The vibrational population dynamics is extracted from the fs-IR spectral intensity of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film excited at 530 nm. The frequency position (1698.1 cm−1) was chosen mainly from the vibrational absorptions of the ss–as CO stretching mode corresponding to the ground state, and the obtained kinetic trace is given in Fig. 2b. As the delay time increases, the ss–as CO stretching intensity of ground absorption (circle) decreases in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film excited at 530 nm: two fast components are observed in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film followed by a long-lived component. The fluorescence quenching is observed upon exciting PDI, revealing the formation of charge transfer species in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system. However, we observed two rapid components in the vibrational dynamics, in which an initial process was as fast as several picoseconds, indicating another possible relaxation pathway exist after photoexcitation of the PDI unit. Since the emission spectrum of PDI and the absorption spectrum of porphyrin overlap in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film, the energy transfer from PDI to porphyrin core may occur. Thus, the rapid decay is attributed to the energy transfer to form the porphyrin singlet excited state, while the slow decaying dynamics is due to the formation of charge-transfer state from 1Por* in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film.
In order to quantitatively assess the corresponding time constants from the above vibrational dynamics, multi-exponential fitting was performed for the kinetic traces. The results of fitting are summarized in Table 1. Fitting the kinetic trace yields the rapid energy transfer to the porphyrin unit with the time constant of 5.2 ps, and a formation time (46.1 ps) of charge transfer state from 1Por* in the PDI-Por-PDI film. The direct hole transfer in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film from 1PDI* can be on a time scale of several picoseconds to tens of picoseconds, which is consistent with a previous observation.52 The PDI˙− feature decays dominantly with a time constant of 333.6 ps to form a nanosecond long-lived component, which is beyond our detection limit.

3.3. Transient infrared measurement of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution upon PDI's photoexcitation
To better understand the photophysical mechanism of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system, the femtosecond transient infrared spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution were measured with the same excitation wavelength at 530 nm for comparison. The fs-IR spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution at several delay times are given in Fig. 2c. As can be seen, the vibrational spectral features of CO stretching modes very much resemble those observed in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film. The spectrum of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution at 1.5 ps delay time is characterized by two negative (at 1652.9 cm−1 and 1693.3 cm−1) and two positive vibrational peaks (1634.7 cm−1 and 1666.4 cm−1), corresponding to the GSB signal and the CO stretching modes of the formed S1 state. Similarly, at a 10.0 ps delay time two new absorption peaks appear at the low-frequency side of those of the S1 state, which are assigned to the stretching modes of PDI˙− species. The signal of this transient radical anion increases with the decrease of the singlet state, indicating a charge transfer process in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. More importantly, at a later delay time (480.0 ps), red-shifted vibrational absorptions of the radical anion can also be seen by its CO stretches in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. However, the signal intensity of vibrational PDI˙− stretching modes in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution is not as prominent as in the case of the film.

Fig. 2d illustrates the dynamics of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution at a selected frequency (1696.4 cm−1). Similarly, the vibrational profile of the ss–as CO stretching mode corresponding to the ground absorption in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution displays an initial fast process and a long-lifetime component. The dynamics in solution occurs to give the singlet excited state of zinc porphyrin with a time constant of 7.1 ps, as shown in Table 1, which is consistent with the observed rapid energy transfer time in other multiple-chromophores systems.44 As shown in Fig. 2d, the charge transfer process is case dependent. The kinetics parameters of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film following excitation at 530 nm are distinctly different from the case of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution excited at 530 nm. Relatively slower formation of charge transfer (66.0 ps) is observed in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution in comparison to that in the film state. By examining these dynamics profiles, the decay of this radical anion formed by charge transfer in solution is much longer compared to that in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film.
Transient fs-IR spectral experiments were carried out to further examine the concentration dependence in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution sample. The intensity-normalized steady-state IR spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solutions at several concentrations (2 mg mL−1, 10 mg mL−1 and 20 mg mL−1) are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The frequency and width of the as–ss and ss–as CO vibrational absorptions are in good agreement at these concentrations, indicating no aggregation of PDI–ZnPor–PDI molecules in solution. Fig. S6 (ESI†) represents the intensity-normalized fs-IR spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solutions at the three concentrations studied at two delay times. As shown, the normalized fs-IR spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solutions at the concentrations studied do not show significant spectral changes in the CO stretching region at both delay times. Furthermore, vibrational dynamics of the CO stretching modes extracted from the fs-IR spectra at 1625 cm−1 (Fig. S7, ESI†) is also very similar at the concentrations studied. Thus, PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution does not show a concentration-dependent spectral feature and CO dynamics. The singlet fission has been found to occur in the PDI dimer or PDI film when the PDI units are held in close proximity.53 We carried out measurements at several concentrations in order to investigate the singlet fission process in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. The results show that the PDI–ZnPor–PDI cannot lead to singlet fission when PDI subunits are coupled through bonding via a large zinc porphyrin moiety. Thus, we attribute such fast signal of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution dynamics in Fig S6 (ESI†) to the intramolecular charge/energy transfer between the constituent units of the multichromophoric system.
3.4. Nanosecond visible transient absorption measurement of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution upon PDI's photoexcitation
To better understand the nature of the long-lived component in the vibrational evolution of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system, transient absorption dynamics of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI dissolved in CHCl3 was measured using nanosecond visible pump–probe spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the dynamics probed at 485 nm for PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution, and the measurement was carried out with an excitation at 532 nm. When the PDI unit was excited, a long-lifetime component was observed on the nanosecond timescale. At a longer delay time (∼300 ns), there was a dramatic decrease in the amplitude of this kinetic trace. The nanosecond transient signal in the visible region is usually characterized by a negative feature due to ground-state bleaching and a positive excited-state absorption located in the short-wavelength region. Because the triplet absorption of the zinc porphyrin unit is usually observed in the ∼630 nm and <470 nm wavelength region, the spectrum located at 485 nm is assigned to the lowest triplet excited state (T1) of the PDI unit. Moreover, ground-state bleaching of the PDI was observed, while that of zinc porphyrin was not observed in our nanosecond measurement, indicating that the formation of 3Por* is unlikely. Similarly, we do not observe the charge-transfer state absorption located at 700–800 nm;54 hence, the formation of charge-transfer species can also be excluded. Based on these results, we conclude that the PDI˙− species after the photoexcitation of PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution primarily decays to form a 3PDI*, and this triplet signal of PDI subsequently decays to the ground state with the time constant of ca. 270.9 ns.

3.5. Photophysical pathways in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system
The electronic energies of the lowest excited singlet PDI and zinc porphyrin components were estimated from the average energies of the (0,0) absorption and fluorescence bands of the two components: 1PDI* (2.47 eV) and 1Por* (2.13 eV). PDI monomers possess the lowest triplet exciton energy in the range of 1.10–1.28 eV,55 while the triplet energy of zinc porphyrin is reported to be 1.59 eV in previous studies.56 The energy of charge-transfer state is related to the oxidation and reduction potential of molecular components, and its energy is estimated as ca. 1.3–1.5 eV from previous studies.57 Using these energy levels, we are able to construct a schematic diagram in Fig. 4, which illustrates the relative energies of all the important states of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system involved in this study. Several important features emerge by inspecting this diagram. First, the energy of the charge-separated state lies between the first singlet state and the ground state, which is, however, not surprising. Second, the 3PDI* triplet state lies below the charge-separated state, while the zinc porphyrin triplet is not believed to be involved in the photo-physics, as is supported by our nanosecond measurement. The charge transfer occurs from the singlet state, and the formation of the PDI radical anion proceeds directly to the triplet excited state of PDI. This premise is supported by the observations from femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption measurements. Earlier studies of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy also confirm a similar excited-state behavior in other porphyrin-based donor–acceptor materials.44,46

The analysis of the steady-state spectra and the excited-state vibrational evolution presented in our study allows us to gain a picture of the photo-physics of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system. The ground-state bleaching signals are observed in the CO stretching region of PDI–Por–PDI upon excitation of its PDI unit. This clearly shows that the ground state population of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI molecule is depleted after photoexcitation. Since the emission spectrum of PDI and porphyrin absorption spectrum overlap in PDI–ZnPor–PDI, a rapid energy transfer from PDI to porphyrin core takes place. Furthermore, our results show that a pump laser pulse at 530 nm, that directly excites the PDI unit of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film, results in a rapid bleach and exhibits a long-lived species upon fs-IR absorption measurement. The intensity of the S1 absorption band relaxes to some extent, which then evolves to the charge-transfer state. We conclude that the PDI radical anion was formed from the singlet excited state by hole transfer upon excitation of its PDI unit. Thus, the non-emissive character of this PDI radical anion leads to negligible fluorescence in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution after photoexcitation of PDI and zinc porphyrin. The formation of 1Por* and the corresponding electron-transfer quenching process may take place, which can also be observed in other molecular systems with many chromophores.44,52 Furthermore, the radical anion of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film decay to form the triplet excited state of PDI in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film. The formation of the triplet state is supported by the observation of spectral evolution dynamics in nanosecond transient measurement. The nanosecond dynamics shows that 3PDI* decays to the ground state with a time constant of ca. 270.9 ns.
The complexes which consist of perylene units connected to one or two porphyrins on the same or opposite side via an ethynylphenyl (ep) linker have been studied previously.45,57–59 The absorption spectra of these arrays usually match the sum of the spectra of the perylene and porphyrin components, and show no near-IR band. On the other hand, the arrays made of a zinc porphyrin covalently attached to several perylene units via ethynl groups have also been investigated,22 and their near-IR spectral features are usually enhanced by the charge transfer state. As the structure of PDI–ZnPor–PDI shows similarity with those arrays containing an ethynl linker, the absorption bands red-shift and an extending near-IR band has been observed in the absorption spectrum. With an increasing number of perylenes per porphyrin, the reported arrays exhibit further redistribution of intensity and the long-wavelength absorption band reaches ∼800 nm. These results indicate that a strong perylene-porphyrin electronic interaction exists in such multichromophoric systems containing ethynl groups in terms of the intensity redistribution. Furthermore, a previous study also showed that the porphyrin dyad with the β-linkage has a longer wavelength absorption band compared to that with the meso-linkage.24 However, the PDI–ZnPor–PDI structure containing the meso-linkage gives rise to a light-absorbing band expanding to 1000 nm, which is the longest wavelength reached among those dyads. Compared to these multichromophoric systems, the PDI–ZnPor–PDI complex is constructed with two PDI units instead of perylene components. Because of the strongly electron-withdrawing nature of the PDI group, it may contribute to the red-shifted absorption in the near-IR region of PDI–ZnPor–PDI. Similarly, the near-IR band in the reported triad with one more perylene-diimide electron acceptor has shown a much longer wavelength compared to the corresponding chlorin–porphyrin tray without a perylene-diimide unit.22 Thus, we conclude that the PDI unit with an ethynl linker is the main contributer to the near-IR absorption band in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution, which is the structural origin of its broad spectral coverage.
Moreover, in such multichromophoric systems the excited-state energy transfer and electron transfer processes are usually very efficient. The lowest singlet excited state in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system can be efficiently quenched by electron/energy transfer, which shows the similar rate constants in these multichromophoric systems via ethynl or ep linkages between the perylene and zinc porphyrin components. Although the intensity of absorption redistributes differently in these multichromophoric systems, the emission spectrum of perylene and the absorption of zinc porphyrin still overlap. Thus, the energy transfer rates between the donor and acceptor show weak dependence on the linker between perylene and porphyrin components. However, the timescale of the electron transfer process in such multichromophoric systems is in the range of several picoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds. The structural effects on electron-transfer rates can be qualitatively explained by the changes in energy values. The substitution of zinc porphyrin or PDI unit in these arrays influences electronic properties and alters molecular orbital energies. This may change the localization and energy level of the lowest singlet excited state, and shift the energy of the charge transfer state. These changes in energy level finally influence the electron transfer rate between zinc porphyrin and perylene units. Although the rate constants of the photophysical processes in PDI–ZnPor–PDI are different from those in some arrays, the energy and electron transfer processes are as efficient as those reported multichromophoric systems. Most importantly, the PDI–ZnPor–PDI has more intensity in the red-most region as well as a more obvious spread of intensity across the UV to near-IR region, which will enable the design of an efficient system for use in organic solar cells.
For the bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells, the understanding of the photophysical mechanism in the film state is of great importance for the multichromophoric systems. No extra vibrational features in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film (Fig. 2) were observed compared to the fs-IR spectra in PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution, but the excited-state energy transfer and charge transfer processes are faster than those in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution. A previous study by our co-workers on crystalline properties have shown that strong π–π stacking of the conjugated backbone exists in the film,37 which is consistent with studies of other multichromophoric systems in the film state.60,61 The intermolecular distance in the film state is reduced when molecules are stacked upon each other, which enables strong intermolecular interaction. This strong interaction and the co-accompanied more effective coupling between transition dipole moments shall change the energy levels and energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. Thus, rapid photoinduced multiple-step processes due to the strong π–π stacking of the conjugated backbone are observed in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, zinc porphyrin and two near-by PDI units linked by the conjugated framework have been synthesized and its electronic excited-state photophysical events have been monitored by using the fs-IR method in this work. These investigations establish the connections between steady-state equilibrium properties and excited-state dynamical properties including the evolving spectral features and multi-scale time constants of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system. Studies are carried out to compare both the solid film state and solution phase of the system. Fluorescence quenching provides the evidence of electron transfer when its PDI unit is photoexcited. A rapid energy transfer from the PDI singlet excited state to zinc porphyrin occurs, which is supported by the fluorescence quenching and vibrational dynamics observed in the present study. Thus, the formation of a charge-transfer state is observed via the singlet excited state of zinc porphyrin or PDI. Furthermore, the charge-transfer species and triplet excited-state species of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system have been observed in the femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and the lifetime of 3PDI* is found to be as long as about 270.9 ns. The formation of PDI−–ZnPor+–PDI and the decay of this photoinduced charge transfer species in the film is faster than those in PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution, which is due to their strong π–π stacking of the conjugated backbone in the film. Our results demonstrate the structural origin of the photophysical properties, and provide an insightful understanding of the photophysical mechanism in the PDI–ZnPor–PDI system. The broadened working wavelength range achieved in this multichromophoric frame will most likely enable the design and utilization of more efficient systems for use in organic solar cells.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structure of PDI–ZnPor–PDI. (b) Ground-state visible absorption spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in the film state (black line) and in CHCl3 (red line), PDI only in CHCl3 (blue dashed), and zinc porphyrin in triethylamine (green dashed). The arrow indicates the photoexcitation wavelength used in this work. (c) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in CHCl3 excited at 430 nm (black line) and 530 nm (red line), PDI in CHCl3 excited at 530 nm (blue line), and that of zinc porphyrin in triethylamine excited at 430 nm (green line). The PL spectra of the PDI–Por–PDI solution are amplified for a better view. (d) Low-frequency peak-intensity normalized steady-state infrared spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in the film state (solid) and in CHCl3 (dashed) in the CO stretching region. Two peaks in the film state are blue shifted with respect to those in solution because of the lack of solvent interaction.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Femtosecond transient infrared spectra of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film upon excitation at 530 nm (circles connected by dashed lines), at delay times of 1.5, 10.0, 50.0, 200.0 and 480.0 ps, which are vertically displaced. (b) Vibrational characteristic dynamics (circles) of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI film at a typical frequency position (1698.1 cm−1) and its fitting result (red solid line). (c) Fs-IR spectra of PDI–ZnPor–PDI in solution (10 mg mL−1) at several delay times upon excitation at 530 nm. (d) Vibrational characteristic features (circles) of the PDI–ZnPor–PDI solution at the typical frequency position (1696.4 cm−1) and its fitting results (red solid line). The fs-IR spectra at longer delay times are amplified for a better view. Arrows show the change of peak position.
