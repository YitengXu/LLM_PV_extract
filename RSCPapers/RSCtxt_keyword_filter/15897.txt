    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 4th December 2019AbstractGreen fabrication, including green materials and green solvents, is an attractive technique in organic electronics. In particular, the application of green materials is an emerging issue for polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this study, an environmentally friendly natural polymer derivative of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is utilized successfully as an efficient cathode interfacial modifier in PSCs. The HPC shows universal properties as an interfacial modifier both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. By introducing HPC as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL), the photovoltaic performance was improved dramatically than in devices without HPC CILs. Compared to bare cathodes, the PSCs with HPC as the CIL afforded higher open circuit voltages (VOCs) and fill factors (FFs) because HPC forms a better, denser, and more uniform high-quality film on the active layer, as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. In addition, the existence of polar hydroxypropyl groups in HPC creates good contact between the active layer and metal cathodes to efficiently decrease the work functions of the cathodes, leading to lower geminate recombination and higher charge mobility than those of cathodes without CILs both in fullerene and non-fullerene systems. These findings indicate that the natural polymer HPC is a promising candidate as a CIL both for highly efficient fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest both in academic institutions and in industry due to their distinct advantages of low cost, flexible and large-scale fabrication, material diversity, etc.1,2 Through dramatic efforts worldwide, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for single-junction and tandem PSCs have exceeded 16% (ref. 3 and 4) and 17%,5 respectively; these PSCs are potentially competitive with traditional silicon- and thin film-based solar cells for commercial applications.
Generally, to achieve high-performance PSCs with versatile PCEs, two important methodologies of developing new active materials6–9 and interface engineering10–13 are utilized. To date, numerous newly synthesized electron-donating and electron-accepting polymers and small molecules have been achieved which show intriguing photovoltaic performance.14–18 However, interface engineering is another useful and feasible way to realize high-performance PSCs.19,20 It is widely known that interfacial materials can perform functions of (1) protecting the active layer from metal-based electrode diffusion in thermal deposition,21 (2) tuning the work functions of electrodes,22–24 and (3) improving the built-in potential between the active layer and electrodes.25 Hence, due to the introduction of these interfacial layers, not only are the charge carrier transport and collection enhanced, but also the interfacial recombination is efficiently restrained; ultimately, the open-circuit voltages (VOCs), fill factors (FFs) and PCEs are enhanced simultaneously.26 Among these developing interfacial materials, cathode interfacial layers (CILs) based on inorganic and organic materials have been investigated widely.27–29 Compared with inorganic CILs, organic CILs are potentially advantageous due to their solution processability, structure tunability and variability, which may be widely applicable for realizing high-performance PSCs.30
To achieve excellent organic-based CILs for PSCs, many CILs have been developed containing polymers,31 small molecules,32 conjugated electrolytes,33 and non-conjugated electrolytes.34,35 Among these, the most commonly employed and well-known CILs are amino group-anchored polymers and small molecules, such as conjugated poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)-based neutral derivatives and ammonium salts and non-conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI)-based analogues.35 Alternatively, intramolecularly cyclized cationic molecules and polymers are also efficient CILs for PSCs due to the very deep energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which facilitate electron transport and hole blocking. Although great successes has been achieved in synthesizing the abovementioned CILs, environmentally friendly materials and fabrication processes are highly indispensable in fabricating PSCs. On the other side, natural products originating from plants or animals are distinctly green materials for academic or industrial applications, such as organic electronics. Moreover, most natural materials contain polar groups, including hydroxyl, amino or carboxyl groups, which can interact well with metal electrodes and metal oxides to modify the interface and tune the work function. It has been found that natural products such as chitosan36 and chlorophyll37 derivatives can be utilized as efficient CILs for improving photovoltaic performance in PSCs. However, to use these natural products as CILs in PSCs, they must undergo complicated or contaminated chemical modifications, which is detrimental for environmentally friendly processes in PSCs.
Among these natural products, some can optimize device interfaces efficiently; however, they only work well in fullerene-based PSCs and do not show universally efficient cathode modification for both fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. Furthermore, the number of universally efficient cathode interfacial materials that are applicable for both fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs is rare, and these CILs are extremely significant for low-cost photovoltaic cells. Recently, only several chemically synthesized universal CILs have been utilized, such as PFN-Br, PNDI-FN-Br, and PDINO.38,39 Interestingly, the natural polymer derivative hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is widely used in medicine; it is extremely environmentally friendly and biocompatible for human healthcare. Due to the high ratio of hydroxyl groups anchored in HPC, it is highly soluble in polar solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. Due to this high solubility in polar solvents, HPC can be used as a CIL in PSCs without solvent mixing or destroying the active layers. In this study, we introduced HPC as a universal CIL for modifying the device interfaces of fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. The HPC could establish good contact between the active layer and metal cathodes and decrease the work functions of these cathodes efficiently, resulting in lower interfacial geminate recombination. Through utilizing HPC as a CIL, the VOCs, FFs and PCEs were improved spontaneously both for fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. Hence, natural cellulose and its derivatives are excellent candidates as universally efficient CILs for high-performance PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and solution preparation
Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were purchased from 1-Materials Company, and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6) and 2,7-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-(4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl) (IDIC) were obtained from Solarmer Incorporation. The host solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich in purities greater than 99%. The interfacial material of HPC (average Mw is ∼80000 and average Mn is ∼10000) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The interfacial layer solution of HPC was dissolved in methanol with two optimal concentrations (0.1 mg ml−1 and 0.3 mg ml−1, respectively). A total 25 mg ml−1 solution of PTB7-Th:PC71BM was prepared at fixed ratios (1:1.5) and was stirred overnight in pristine CB at 65 °C. A 20 mg ml−1 (in total) solution of PM6:IDIC was prepared at blended ratios (1:1) and was stirred overnight in mixed solvent of CB and CF (20 v%) at 50 °C before use. In addition, 3% volume ratio DIO was added to the dissolved solutions of PTB7-Th:PC71BM half an hour before spin-coating the active layer.
Device fabrication
Fullerene- and non-fullerene-based OSCs were both fabricated using indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates. The substrates were cleaned using the following sequence in an ultrasound instrument: dilute detergent solution, deionized water, and isopropanol. Then, the substrates were dried in a 70 °C oven and treated with plasma before use. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated on ITO at 3000 rpm and heated for 15 min at 150 °C. Then, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox with O2 and H2O levels <0.1 ppm. Also, the active layers of PTB7-Th:PC71BM (with a thickness of about 120 nm) and PM6:IDIC (with a thickness of about 150 nm) were spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS surfaces at the optimal speeds. After that, the cathode interface layers were formed upon the active layers by spin-coating HPC solution using the optimal speeds. The optimal concentrations and rotating speeds of HPC were 0.1 mg ml−1 (2000 rpm) and 0.3 mg ml−1 (2000 rpm) for the fullerene and non-fullerene systems, respectively. Finally, the devices were transferred into a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa and thermally deposited with 100 nm Al (or Ag) as the top electrodes.
Device measurement and characterization
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices (active area = 0.057 cm2) were measured by a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under AM1.5G simulated sunlight with an intensity of 1000 W m−2, which was calibrated by a standard silicon battery. The EQE spectra were measured using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R3011, Enlitech Co., Ltd.). Before measuring the EQE, we used a calibrated silicon detector to determine the absolute photosensitivity values at different wavelengths. The surface topographies determined by AFM measurements were carried out using a digital Instrumental multimode nanoscope (IIIa) in tapping mode. In addition, the water contact angles of the surfaces were obtained with a commercial contact angle system (DataPhysics, OCA 20) in the ambient environment. The work functions (WF) of the electrodes were measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) under a high vacuum working environment. The electron mobilities of the devices were determined by fitting the dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices to the space charge limited current (SCLC) model at low voltages. In this model, the current is given by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative permittivity of the material (about 3 for conjugated polymers), μ is the mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer (about 120 nm and 150 nm for the fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs, respectively, in this work). The relationships between JSC or VOC and light intensity in both the fullerene and non-fullerene systems were obtained by measuring the J–V curves under changeable light intensities in varying degrees by placing different attenuators between the simulated solar lamp and our devices. The exponential factor (α) can be obtained by fitting the JSC–I curves to the power law (JSC ∝ Iα). Also, the slope about kT/q was obtained according to VOCversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity by the power law of VOC ∝ nkTln(I)/q, where k, T, I and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in kelvin, light intensity and elementary charge, respectively. In the transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements, a weakened 580 nm laser pulse with a pulse width of 120 fs was used as the light source. The measuring equipment was linked to a Tektronix TDS 3052C digitizing oscilloscope with a resistance of 50 Ω. For the transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, in order to form the open-circuit conditions, the device was connected to the oscilloscope using a high resistance of 1 MΩ. To ensure a tiny variation of the laser-pulse-induced photovoltage in this test, we used 0.3 sun background illumination.
Results and discussion
Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of HPC both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs, we chose the well-known donor material PTB7-Th to match the well-studied fullerene acceptor PC71BM (blended in a 1:1.5 weight ratio with 3 v% DIO) and the efficient donor material PM6 to the match non-fullerene acceptor IDIC (blended in a 1:1 weight ratio). The conventional photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/CIL/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:IDIC/CIL/Ag for the fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs, respectively. The chemical structures of the polymers and molecules, the device structure and the corresponding energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The chemical structures of the used materials (a), the device structure (b) and the corresponding energy level diagrams (c and d). 
Through carefully modulating the thickness of HPC, the photovoltaic performance was well studied. The optimal concentrations and spin-coating speeds of HPC were 0.1 mg ml−1 (2000 rpm) and 0.3 mg ml−1 (2000 rpm) for the fullerene and non-fullerene systems, respectively. The thicknesses of the HPC layer measured by a step profiler in the fullerene and non-fullerene systems were approximately 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G irradiation and in the dark state for both the fullerene and non-fullerene systems. The resulting short circuit current (JSC), VOC, FF and PCE values, as determined from the J–V curves,40,41 are summarized in Table 1. It is interesting to note that the introduction of HPC as the CIL results in significant VOC improvements to 0.79 and 0.90 V, while the values are only 0.57 and 0.74 V for the bare cathode devices in the fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs, respectively. Similarly, compared to the initial control device, the HPC-based PSCs show FF increments from 57.51% to 70.79% in the fullerene systems and 55.73% to 64.59% in the non-fullerene systems, thus contributing to overall improvements in the PCEs from 5.33% to 9.04% in the fullerene systems and 6.69% to 9.32% in the non-fullerene systems, respectively. On the other side, the JSCs were unchanged in both the fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. These results indicate that HPC can function as an efficient universal CIL to improve the VOC and FF of both fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs with and without CIL were measured, as presented in Fig. 2(b and e). In the fullerene systems, the shapes of the EQE spectra in all devices with and without HPC as the CIL are almost identical across the entire wavelength range, which is in good agreement with published results. All the devices exhibit high EQE values, implying the potential for high JSCs in PSCs. From the EQE spectra, we can see that EQE change in the non-fullerene systems varies obviously from that of the fullerene systems; this may be because the light-harvesting properties are changed by the HPC layer.42 According to the J–V curves in the dark shown in Fig. 2(c and f), the HPC-modified solar cells show much smaller dark current densities than those without CIL-covered devices both in the fullerene and non-fullerene systems; this indicates that current leakage can be efficiently suppressed by optimizing the cathode interface contact. This shows that HPC is an excellent CIL for PSCs.
Topography
To understand the improvement in device performance upon inserting HPC as the CIL, the surface morphologies were characterized by AFM measurements under ambient conditions, as shown in Fig. 3(a–d). The surface of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film is very rough, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.75 nm. When the surface of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film is covered by HPC, it is much smoother and more homogeneous, with a RMS roughness of 3.86 nm. Meanwhile, when a PM6:IDIC blend film is covered by an HPC layer, the RMS of the active layer surface becomes 2.15 nm, which is much smoother than that of pristine PM6:IDIC film with a RMS roughness of 3.14 nm. The AFM measurements suggest that HPC effectively modifies the interface between the active layer and metal cathode, which is beneficial for forming versatile interface contact and ultimately dramatically improving the photovoltaic performance. In addition, water contact angle (θ) measurements were performed in order to study the wetting properties of HPC atop the active layers, as shown in Fig. 3(e–h). These images show the contact angles of water droplets on the surfaces of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PM6:IDIC films without a CIL and with an HPC layer, respectively. The water contact angles of the four surfaces for PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM/HPC, PM6:IDIC and PM6:IDIC/HPC are approximately 100.49°, 96.93°, 102.88°, and 85.76°, respectively. From the water contact angle data, we can see that HPC can modify the active layer interface efficiently and form uniform interfacial layers. Interestingly, the HPC layer covered on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film slightly changed the surface polarity, with a θ of 96.93°. However, the surface of PM6:IDIC/HPC is much more hydrophilic, with a θ of 85.76°; this indicates that HPC may be a more effective modifier for non-fullerene-based active layers. This difference in interfacial modification for the fullerene and non-fullerene systems may result from the different interfacial film-forming ability and matched surface tension through interfacial contact.43 The contact angle measurement results provide powerful proof that HPC has great potential to form high-quality interfacial films on the active layer both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.

Work function and electron mobility measurements
To explore the origin of the improvement in device performance, the work functions (WFs) of the HPC-modified Ag electrodes and bare ITO were measured by the Kelvin probe method, where ITO was used as an internal reference with a WF of 4.8 eV; the related mapping curves are presented in Fig. 4. After deposition of HPC with the optimal thickness on Ag and ITO electrodes, the WFs of the ITO/HPC and Ag/HPC electrodes dramatically decreased from 4.80 and 4.46 eV to 4.46 and 4.29 eV, respectively. The decreased WFs can decrease the Schottky barrier and form better ohmic contact and energy alignment with the interface to improve the electron extraction.44 This is consistent with the significant increase in electron mobility after HPC is deposited on the active layer, as presented in Fig. 5. The electron mobilities of the fullerene and non-fullerene-based active layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structures of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/CIL/Al and ITO/ZnO/PM6:IDIC/CIL/Al, respectively. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM device without an interlayer gives an electron mobility of 1.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, while the electron mobility of the HPC-modified PTB7-Th:PC71BM device improves to 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1. Meanwhile, the electron mobility of the PM6:IDIC device also improves from 1.80 × 10−5 to 2.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 after the HPC modification. Therefore, HPC as an efficient CIL significantly improves the electron mobility both in fullerene and non-fullerene systems.

Charge carrier transport and recombination properties
To investigate the charge recombination mechanisms of PSCs without and with HPC modifier, the relationship between JSC (or VOC) and the light intensity was observed both in the fullerene and non-fullerene systems; it is a valuable indicator of the charge carrier recombination process.45 From Fig. 6(a and c), the correlation between JSC and light intensity abides by the power law (JSC ∝ Iα), where α is an exponential factor.46,47 Note that when the value of α is close to 1, the photo-generated charge carriers under short-circuit conduction can be effectively extracted and collected by electrodes prior to recombination. In other words, bimolecular recombination is very weak in the photoactive layer.48–50 It is obvious that the fitted α values are 0.91 and 0.94 for the non-fullerene PSCs without and with the HPC layer, respectively; this suggests that more carriers are swept out prior to recombination in the HPC-modified device.51 Meanwhile, the fitted α values are 0.83 and 0.91 for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system without and with the HPC layer, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination dominates more than in the non-fullerene-based PSCs. However, the introduction of HPC in the fullerene system definitely suppresses the bimolecular recombination more than in that without the HPC CIL. These results prove that the bimolecular recombination is weakened and monomolecular recombination is strengthened in both fullerene and non-fullerene HPC-modified PSCs. In addition, the correlation between VOC and light intensity abides by the formula VOC ∝ nkTln(I)/q, where k, T, I and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in kelvin, light intensity and elementary charge, respectively. The investigation of VOCversus the natural logarithm of light intensity gives kT/q, which indicates bimolecular recombination in the open circuit state. If additional recombination is involved, namely Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, the slope is greater than kT/q.52,53 From Fig. 6(b), a series of slopes with 1.62 and 1.15 kT/q were obtained for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM systems without and with the HPC layer, respectively. In addition, the slopes are 1.61 and 1.32 (kT/q) for the PM6:IDIC systems without and with the HPC layer, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(d). Clearly, the HPC-modified device could effectively minimize the trap-assisted recombination in the PM6:IDIC system. Also, the trap-assisted recombination becomes very weak in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system when HPC is introduced as the CIL. Therefore, the environmentally friendly HPC can efficiently depress interfacial recombination both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.

To study the charge carrier extraction and recombination in detail, transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements of the PSCs were further performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Here, TPV was used to analyze the charge recombination lifetimes.54 The device based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with HPC as the CIL achieves a charge recombination lifetime of 1.04 μs, which is longer than that of 0.76 μs without the HPC layer, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Similarly, the charge recombination lifetime increases from 3.02 to 3.12 μs after deposition of the HPC layer in the PM6:IDIC system, as displayed in Fig. 7(c). This indicates that the charge recombination is efficiently suppressed after deposition of the HPC layer both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay was used to characterize the charge extraction dynamics in the devices. The typical TPC spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 7(b and d). The charge-extraction time of the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PM6:IDIC without the CIL are 0.35 μs and 0.28 μs, respectively. These values decrease to 0.30 μs and 0.24 μs with HPC as the CIL, respectively. Meanwhile, the amount of extracted charge carriers under an excitation laser increased from 7.19 × 10−10 to 9.26 × 10−10 C and from 4.09 × 10−10 to 7.73 × 10−10 C in the fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs, respectively. These results indicate that faster charge extraction is achieved after introducing HPC as a CIL, which is beneficial for the inhibition of charge recombination. This accelerated charge-extraction can be ascribed to the better contact and energy alignment between the active layer and electrode when the HPC is introduced as a CIL. Overall, all the above investigations reveal that the excellent photovoltaic properties with HPC as a CIL can be attributed to the better charge transport quality and simultaneously suppressed charge recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, an environmentally friendly natural polymer derivative, HPC, was successfully utilized as a CIL to visualize green processes in PSCs due to its high solubility in polar solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. HPC presented universal interfacial modification both in a PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based fullerene system and a PM6:IDIC-based non-fullerene system. The introduction of an HPC layer could form a uniform interfacial layer on the active layer and enable excellent contact between the active layer and metal cathodes to efficiently decrease the work functions of the cathodes. In addition, the HPC layer distinctly improved the electron mobility both in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. These unique functions of HPC realized lower interfacial geminate recombination, leading to simultaneous enhancement of the VOCs and FFs. As a result, maximum PCEs of 9.04% and 9.32% based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PM6:IDIC systems were achieved, respectively. All these characteristics indicate that HPC is a newly promising candidate for universal CILs both in high-performance fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs. Furthermore, if the feasible structural modification of HPC via improving the n-type semiconducting ability is promoted, more efficient environmentally friendly CILs can be created in the future. Finally, this demonstrates the enormous potential of natural polymers applied as functional materials in optoelectronic devices.55,56
