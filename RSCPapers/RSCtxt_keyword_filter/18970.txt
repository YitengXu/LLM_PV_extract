1. Introduction
Following the astonishing discoveries of fullerene and carbon nanotube (CNT) in earlier decades, the emergence of graphene nanosheet (GN, 2010 Nobel Prize for Physics) has recently opened up an exciting new field in the science and technology of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with continuously growing academic and technological impetus.1 It possesses single-, bi- or few- (no more than ten) layers of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in six-membered rings, and is the parent of all graphitic forms including 0D fullerene, 1D CNT and 3D graphite.2GN is a metal-like conductor (a zero-bandgap without semiconducting properties), but graphene nanoribbons (GNRs, a new form of GN) can generally be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their widths and edge configurations.2 For instance, GNRs narrower than 10 nm can be semiconductors due to quantum confinement of the electron wave function. However, for larger widths, the properties of the GNRs are largely dependent on the edge configurations.3 Although GN is supposed to be flat, ripples usually occur to eliminate the effect of thermal fluctuations.2 Actually, GN is not only stable but also exhibits remarkable electronic, optical, thermal and mechanical properties, including high values of its Young's modulus (∼1100 GPa),4 fracture strength (125 GPa),4 thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1),5 mobility of charge carriers (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1),6 specific surface area (calculated value, 2630 m2 g−1),2 high chemical stability and high optical transmittance, plus fascinating transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect7 and ambipolar electric field effect,8etc. Importantly, these attractive properties generate huge interest from different scientific communities in the possible implementation of GN in different application fields such as biomedicine, reinforced composites, sensors, catalysis, energy conversion and storage device, electronics and transparent electrodes for displays and solar cells.
Inspired by these particular properties and enormous potential applications, scientists have devoted their great efforts to explore new significant scientific problems about GN since its discovery in 2004.1 Actually, GN-based materials have the enormous potential to rival or even surpass the performance of their CNT-based counterparts, given that cheap, large-scale production and processing methods for high-quality GN become available. As introduced above, micromechanical cleavage from bulk graphite was initially used to produce GN, but the yield of this method is extremely low and the process is hard to control.1 Other various synthesis methods for GN have been developed, including epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and substrate-free gas phase synthesis, etc., however, these methods usually need high temperature, high-quality substrate materials and accurate control over cooling rates, which are impractical for large-scale manufacturing (producing small quantities of GN). Particularly, the strong hydrophobic nature of as-obtained GN enables it to show a strong tendency to agglomerate in solvents, which severely restrict its promising applications in many fields.9 Thus the prevention of GN aggregation in solution is of particular importance for its practical applications because most of its unique properties are only associated with individual sheets.10 Among the current methods of generating GN, solution-processed routes offer the greatest ease for functionalization and bulk-scale processing of GN to obtain stable suspensions. In this method, the primary obstacle to achieving individual or few-layer GN is overcoming the enormous interlayer van der Waals forces. Dispersing agents were usually employed as assisted components to obtain high-dispersion GN through chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) or direct liquid exfoliation strategy. Although GNs produced by the chemical route are of good quality, they are still far inferior to samples prepared by mechanical cleavage. Particularly, the presence of dispersing agents may be undesirable for many technological applications, which usually lead to poor application performance. Therefore, at present, designing or introducing new functional molecules for effectively dispersing GNs and meanwhile bringing in new or enhanced functions are highly desirable and technologically important.
Besides the great challenge on exploring effective, low-cost, reliable, mild, environmentally friendly, high-yield and high-throughput strategies for preparing high-quality GN, which are critical for progress in this research area to continue, some other important issues related to exploring its new properties, functions and applications should be taken adequately into consideration. (1) The fine structure of GNs, such as size, shape, and even type and location of defects should be accurately tuned, which is strongly driven by the requirement of revealing their new properties and functions. For instance, GNRs less than 10 nm wide have a bandgap that can be used to make room-temperature field-effect transistors,2 and graphene quantum dots (QDs) show strong fluorescent emission.11 (2) Effective molecular engineering should be further developed in order to improve or modify the property and application performance of GNs. Chemical doping of GN with foreign atoms (N and B) may an effective method for modifying the materials intrinsically, tailoring their electronic properties, manipulating the surface chemistry, and producing local changes to the elemental composition of the host material. Non-covalent or covalent strategies could also provide a good opportunity for keeping or tuning or enhancing the properties of GN for potential applications in different fields. (3) Developing effective techniques for constructing GN-based monolayer films or high-quality ultrathin films, or assembling particular architectures is strongly required for completing or enhancing the application prospects in different fields. For instance, assembling large sized GNs with minimum chemical defects into a compact monolayer over a large macroscopic area is very important for the application of this novel material as a transparent conductor in the field of solar cells. (4) Nanostructured hybrid materials have emerged with the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology as novel and promising materials. The hybridization of different types of materials is crucial for enhancing advanced functions as it can enable versatile and tailor-made properties with performances far beyond those of the individual materials. Therefore, a new class of GN-based functional hybrids is highly desirable for optimizing the optical, electrical and catalytic properties of GN and enhancing its performance in different fields such as electrochemistry and analytical chemistry. However, two important challenges for this is that GN should be incorporated as individual nanosheets, and homogeneously distributed, into various nanomatrices, and various nanomaterials on the surface of GN should be accurately tuned into the desirable architectures, which will most facilitate the performance improvement of hybrids. (5) The use of nanomaterials for applications in electrochemistry and analytical chemistry has received much attention in recent years because the unique properties of nanomaterials offer excellent prospects for designing novel electrochemical and analytical nanodevices. So the question should be asked: whether GN or GN-based nanohybrids can provide a new choice for constructing a series of electrochemical and analytical devices with high performance? Inspired by these important puzzles and challenges, the research on GN has been flourishing in the past five years, and many research papers, as well as some review papers have been dedicated to this topic.2,9,10,12–20 However, at present, the majority of reviews are centered on one or two subtopics about graphene before 2009. For instance, Kaner et al.12 gave an overview on graphene, which concentrated on the synthesis and different characterizations of graphene. Nguyen et al.9 provided an a review upon advances on some techniques for preparing stable GO, highly reduced GO, and graphene dispersions in aqueous and organic media. A review on the developments on graphene mainly before 2008, written from the perspective of a chemist, was presented by Loh et al.,19 whose topic was centered on the synthesis and functionalization of graphene. Liu et al.3 highlighted recent advances in controllable synthesis and electronic application of graphene (scientific contributions before 2009). Actually, as the hottest research field at present, the scientists from chemistry, physics, materials, biology and medicine reveal a great number of new exciting research results about graphene even every month. Thus, a comprehensive review on the latest significant developments of graphene with a particular focus on the last three years, will greatly appeal to the broad readership interested in nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials science, analytical chemistry, electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. In this critical review, we will cover recent advances (before our submission) in synthesis, molecular engineering, thin film, hybrids, and energy and analytical applications of the “star-material” GN together with discussion on the major challenges and opportunities for future GN research. However, due to the explosion of publications in this field, we do not claim that this critical review includes all of the published work about GNs. We apologize to the authors of much excellent work, that due to the large activity in this field, we have unintentionally left out.
2. Synthesis of graphene
As the first step to realize the applications, GN must be synthesized on a large scale with controlled size, monolayer and morphology, thus developing the effective strategies for controllable and scalable production of GN is of great importance for its applications in different fields. At present, some interesting methods have been designed to obtain high-quality GN, though there are still some disadvantages for each method. In this part, we will provide some recent advances on different strategies for synthesis of GN.
2.1 
          Chemical vapor deposition for graphene
The first successful method to produce both single and few-layer GN was micromechanical exfoliation of bulk graphite, in which highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) was pealed using scotch-tape and then deposited on to a silicon substrate.1 Although this method has produced the highest quality samples with dimensions in the 10 μm range, it is neither high throughput nor high-yield. Alternatives to mechanical exfoliation, a widely employed synthesis method for GN fabrication is CVD.21–29 The CVD processes generally utilize transition metal surfaces for growth of GN using hydrocarbon gases as GN precursors at the deposition temperature of about 1000 °C. Ruoff et al.21 reported a CVD method for large-area synthesis of high-quality and uniform GN films on copper foils using a mixture of methane and hydrogen as precursors. The as-obtained films are predominantly single-layer GN, with a small percentage (less than 5%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries (Fig. 1A and B). Particularly, one of the major benefits of their process is that it could be used to grow GN on 300-mm copper films on Si substrate and this GN film could also be easily transferred to alternative substrates, such as SiO2/Si or glass (Fig. 1C and D). The modification of the CVD process, which generally leads to less strict conditions, has been also utilized to produce high-quality GN films. For instance, microwave plasma-enhanced CVD has been used for mass production of GN, but this method is rather costly and unwanted carbides and amorphous carbon probably occur on certain substrates.22 Dervishi et al.23 developed a radio frequency (RF) catalytic CVD route for large-scale production of GN. The RF-CVD method significantly reduces the energy consumption during synthesis while preventing the formation of amorphous carbon or other types of unwanted products. Kong's group24 presented a low-cost and scalable technique via ambient pressure CVD on polycrystalline Ni films, to fabricate large area (∼cm2) films of single- to few-layer GN and could transfer the films to nonspecific substrates. Compared with previous ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) CVD,25 their process enables the inexpensive and high-throughput growth of GN over large areas, with properties closer to that found by microcleaving HOPG, owing to the use of ambient pressure and readily available Ni films. Furthermore, Ajayan et al.26 reported the substrate selective growth of centimetre size (∼3.5 cm × 1.5 cm), uniform, and continuous single- and few-layer GN films employing the CVD technique on polycrystalline Cu foils using a liquid precursor (hexane) instead of traditional gas precursors. And also, these GN films could be easily transferred to any desired substrate without damage. Another interesting modification is that some groups employed a low-temperature CVD process to synthesize high-quality GN films in place of traditional high-temperature (1000 °C). A typical example is from Duesberg's group,27 who demonstrated that high quality large-area GN film could be obtained through the controllable catalytic CVD strategy at temperatures as low as 750 °C using acetylene as gas precursor. It should be noted that the lower growth temperature for graphene with acetylene as the source gas instead of the above hydrocarbon gases could be probably attributed to the fact that the barrier energy for breaking the C–C bond is lower than for C–H bonds.28 Furthermore, CVD-based defect repair of GO without the need of any metal substrate is also a novel route to obtain highly conductive chemically derived GN film, in which GO was first deposited onto degenerately doped Si/SiO2 substrate, then was repaired through CVD route.29

2.2 Epitaxial growth of graphene on silicon carbide
Epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC) is a very promising method for the synthesis of uniform, wafer-size GN layers, in which single crystal SiC substrates are heated in vacuum to high temperatures in the range of 1200–1600 °C. Since the sublimation rate of silicon is higher than that of carbon, excess carbon is left behind on the surface, which rearranges to form GN.30–33 Shivaraman et al.30 reported that GN was grown epitaxially on the silicon face of a chemically mechanically polished 4H-SiC substrate by heating the substrate under vacuum condition at 1400 °C for 1 h. Whereas contrary to common belief that β-SiC was not suitable for GN growth due to its cubic lattice, Aristov's group31 succeeded in growing high-quality GN on cubic β-SiC. Furthermore, Seyller et al.32 demonstrated a method of preparing GN on SiC(0001) that results in a significantly improved film quality through ex situannealing under an argon atmosphere, which is different from the above vacuum annealing.30,31 More recently, an interesting route that employed commercial polycrystalline SiC granules instead of single-crystal SiC as substrate has been developed by Bao et al.33 to prepare high-quality freestanding single-layer GN. Generally speaking, these strict conditions for GN such as high-temperature, ultrahigh vacuum or inert atmosphere and single-crystal substrate (in most cases) will probably limit the use of this technique in large-scale practical applications.
2.3 
          Arc discharge method for graphene
The arc discharge method has been employed for the production of GN. Compared to CVD, the arc discharge method for GN has merits of good crystallinity and high thermal stability due to an in situ defect-elimination or healing effect of the high plasma temperature and the etching effect of H2 on undesirable amorphous carbon.34 Rao et al.35 reported the synthesis of GN by arc discharge in a mixed atmosphere of H2/He with graphite rods as the anode and cathode materials and a discharge current in the 100–150 A range. Then, Shi's group36 demonstrated a modified arc discharge method for obtaining GN in air instead of a mixed atmosphere of H2/He. They found that high pressure facilitated the formation of GN, but low pressure favored the growth of other carbon nanostructures including carbon nanohorns and nanospheres. More recently, Cheng et al.34 demonstrated that hydrogen arc discharge as a rapid heating method could be used to produce GN with a good quality from GO, combined with solution-phase dispersion and centrifugation techniques. The GNs obtained exhibited a high electrical conductivity and high thermal stability.
2.4 Substrate-free gas-phase synthesis of graphene
Recently, the substrate-free gas-phase strategy has become an successful method for the synthesis of high-quality GN.37,38 Compared with the above strategies for GN, which need very complex and harsh conditions, the substrate-free gas-phase method is capable of continuous GN production at ambient conditions, which involves sending an aerosol consisting of liquid ethanol droplets and argon gas directly into an atmospheric-pressure microwave-generated argon plasma. Over a time scale on the order of 10−1 s, ethanol droplets evaporated and dissociated in the plasma, forming the desired GN. For instance, Dato et al.37 presented a novel method for synthesizing GN in the gas phase using a substrate-free, atmospheric-pressure microwave plasma reactor, as shown in Fig. 2a. Using this method, the rate of producing GN was 2 mg min−1 when a mass input of carbon in the ethanol reached 164 mg min−1. Furthermore, the obtained GN was found to easily disperse in methanol during sonication, resulting in the formation of a homogeneous black suspension (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c shows typical TEM images of the obtained GN. Continuous and crumpled nanosheets are observed, indicating the feasibility of the method. Although the method could effectively prepare GN, its layer number was hard to control and few-layer GN was usually contained in the product, which was disadvantageous for electronic applications.

2.5 Chemical reduction of graphene oxide
Oxidative exfoliation of natural graphite by thermal or oxidation technique and subsequent chemical reduction has been evaluated as one of the most efficient methods for low-cost, large-scale production of GN. Another advantage of chemical reduction methods is that the produced GN in the form of a monolayer can be conveniently deposited on any substrate with simple processing, which has the potential to realize the applications for large-scale organic devices or photovoltaic cells or electrochemical devices. In this method, the heavy oxidization of graphite produces GO, which has disrupted conjugation in the plane, missing carbon atoms in the plane, and abundant functional groups such as epoxide, hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl at both the edges and in the plane.2,9 These abundant functional groups weaken the van der Waals interactions between the layers of GO and make them hydrophilic. However, because of its strong hydrophobicity, GN obtained from reduction of GO generally suffers from limited solubility or even irreversible agglomeration, thus making further processing and application difficult. Controlling some key experimental parameters is important for improving the GN solubility in the process of GO reduction. Li et al.39 demonstrated that reduced GN could be prepared by maintaining a high pH value during chemical reduction without the need for polymeric or surfactant stabilizers. However, the colloid stability of the obtained GN is relatively high and the addition of NaCl or long-term storage leads to irreversible agglomeration. Recently, amphiphilic functional molecules such as polymers and surfactant, etc. have been shown to act as agents for enhancing the solubility of GN.40–48 This is because that the hydrophobic part of amphiphilic functional molecules could form a strong π–π interaction with the chemically reduced GN whereas the hydrophilic side chains on the surface of GN prevented the GN aggregation via the electrostatic and steric repulsions. Typical functional molecules include aromatic tetrasodium 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid,40DNA,41 conjugated-polyelectrolyte (PFVSO3),421-pyrenebutyrate,43lignin and cellulose derivatives,44porphyrin,45 ionic liquid,46 nonionic polymeric surfactants,47 fluorescent coronene carboxylate,48 and cyclodextrin (CD),49etc. For instance, Mann et al.41 demonstrated for the first time the use of ssDNA in the preparation of stable aqueous suspensions of single-layer GN with concentrations as high as 2.5 mg mL−1. Our group49 demonstrated for the first time the use of CD in the preparation of stable (>6 months) aqueous suspensions of GN with concentrations >2.5 mg mL−1via a simple wet-chemical strategy. Although the as-obtained DNA- or CD-graphene hybrid nanosheets exhibited high stability in water, one key question should not be neglected is that DNA or CD would impact the whole conductivity of the hybrids. Ionic liquids (ILs) show the potential for overcoming the above mentioned issues owing to their unique properties, such as high ionic conductivity, extremely low vapor pressure, wide liquid temperature range, wide electrochemical window, good thermal stability, nonflammability, and designable properties, etc.46 Han's group46 reported an approach to disperse GN stably in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate in the presence of a polymerized ionic liquid. It should be noted that in the above chemical reduction methods, toxic substances such as hydrazine and NaBH4 were usually used to reduce GO. In view of the fact that hydrazine is toxic and dangerously unstable, it is desirable to explore a green chemistry route for the reduction of GO. Guo et al.50 demonstrated that individual GN could be readily obtained under mild conditions using ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. Meantime, Zhang's group51 reported an environmentally-friendly method to produce GN that employs ascorbic acid as the reductant and amino acid as the stabilizer. Then, our group52 developed a green and facile approach to the synthesis of chemically converted GNs using reducing sugars, such as glucose, fructose and sucrose as both reductant and protecting agent and GO as precursor. It is found that the as-obtained GN has monodisperse thickness of about 1.1 nm (Fig. 3A and B), high crystallinity, and exhibited high solubility in water (Fig. 3C). Novel dehydration or deoxygenation process also provided an effective route for obtaining GN with high stability.53,54 A stable GN suspension could be quickly prepared by simply heating an GO suspension under strongly alkaline conditions at moderate temperatures (50–90 °C) (Fig. 4).53 In the system, the higher the pH of the GO suspension is, the faster the reaction is. Alkaline-catalyzed deoxygenation reaction might play an important role in obtaining GN. Later, Loh et al.54 reported a simple, clean and controlled hydrothermal dehydration route to convert GO to stable GN solution. In this system, supercritical water (SC) could play the role of reducing agent under hydrothermal conditions and promote the recovery of π-conjugation after dehydration. Recently, Müllen et al.55 developed a UV-irradiated photochemical reduction method to reduce GO to prepare stable GN, in which H3PW12O40 was used as photocatalyst. This green-chemistry approach could greatly improve the water dispersibility of reduced GN resulting from an in situ adsorption of anionic PW12O403−clusters acting as stabilizer. More interestingly, Tour et al.56 demonstrated that environmental bacteria could be also employed as an electron donor to reduce graphene. They found that the conductance and physical characteristics of bacterially converted graphene were comparable to other forms of chemically converted graphene. The results are important for using environmental bacteria to process graphene for the purpose of bioremediation and more generally for green chemistry approaches to materials synthesis.

Dispersing GN in organic solvents is also particularly important because some important applications need to be conducted in organic systems such as catalytic reactions, and for the design of GN–polymer nanocomposites, etc. Some interesting functional molecules such as p-phenylene diamine (PPD),57ethylenediamine (EDA),58 end-functional polymers,59 and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB),60etc. have been employed to promote the dispersibility of GN in organic solvent. Ma et al.57 reported a new and simple approach to preparing GN with PPD as a reducing reagent without any other post-treatments. Surprisingly, the as-made GN is very stable in ethanol, presumably because it is positively charged due to the absorption of the oxidation product of PPD. Furthermore, Müllen's group60 described a potentially scalable and environmentally friendly method for the production of GN dispersed in chloroform using DDAB as a phase-transfer agent. Under the appropriate conditions, such as controlling the polarity of mixed solvent, GN could also be prepared and further stabilized in organic solvent.61,62 A typical example is from Ruoff's work,61 which demonstrated homogeneous colloidal suspensions of chemically modified GNs were readily produced in a wide variety of organic solvent systems. In addition, another important advantage is that some organic solvents could allow high temperature processing, which is advantageous for producing much less defective GN. For instance, Dai et al. demonstrated a solvothermal reduction route (180 °C) for more effectively obtaining a GN homogeneous suspension in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with less oxygen and defect levels and increased conjugation domains.63 Another typical example is from Gilje's work,64 which reported a solvothermal reduction method utilizing the high boiling point of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) in combination with the oxygen-scavenging properties of NMP at high temperatures to deoxygenate GO, so creating graphene dispersions.
2.6 Direct synthesis of graphene from graphite or its derivatives
Although the chemical reduction method provides a high-throughput processing route for preparing GN, the reduction cannot remove many irreversible lattice defects introduced by the oxidation process. These defects disrupt the band structure and partly degrade the electronic properties that make GN unique. Exfoliated pristine graphite or its derivatives provide enormous potential for obtaining high quality GN with high electrical conductivity because the as-prepared GN can keep the basic structure of graphite and has fewer defects. At present, three key points or skills should be adequately taken into consideration in order to effectively directly synthesise GN from graphite or its derivatives. The first is to choose good stabilizers. From the viewpoint of their chemical structures, these stabilizers normally constitute two functional groups, one for adsorption and the other for dispersion. In order to effectively keep good electronic structure of GN, the adsorption part of stabilizer ideally contains some large π–π conjugation structure. For instance, some stabilizers such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS),65perylene-based bolaamphiphile detergent,66sodium cholate,671-pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride,68 and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane,69etc. have been successfully used as promoting agents for obtaining high-dispersibility GN solution. It should be emphasized that the pyrene derivative reported by Heet al.68 not only acted as stabilizer for dispersing GN, but also nanographene molecules, to heal the possible defects in GNs during annealing. The second key skill is to use novel graphite derivatives including expanded graphite (EG, a well-known commercially available product),69,70 fluorinated graphite intercalation compound (GIC),71alkali metal GIC,72 and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG),70etc. Typical work is from Yoo's group.71Fig. 5c shows the process for preparing GN using fluorinated GIC as precursor. After the intercalation process, C2F·nClF3 has a golden color (Fig. 5a), and after the expansion process, the graphite recovered its own color (Fig. 5b). The fluorinated GIC has a more highly expanded state than commercial EG, which is very important for the direct synthesis of GN under mild conditions. The third skill is to select appropriate solvents. The key parameter for suitable solvents is that the solvent–GN interactions must be at least comparable to those existing between the stacked GNs in graphite. Some typical solvents such as ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB),70NMP,73 a mixture of sodium and ethanol (molar ratio 1:1),74 perfluorinated aromatic solvents,75 and ionic liquids,76,77etc. have been explored to directly disperse GN, which exhibited relatively high solubility. One important attempt for this aspect is that Stride et al.74 reported the direct solvothermal synthesis of a fused array of GN in gram-scale quantities using the common laboratory reagents ethanol and sodium, which are dispersed by mild sonication. However, generally speaking, direct synthesis of GN from graphite or its graphite derivatives still has some critical disadvantages: (1) the resulting colloidal suspensions of GN are still at low concentrations, which makes some important applications impractical; (2) it is difficult to obtain single-layer GN with high yield; (3) some of the solvents are expensive and require special care in handling.

2.7 Electrochemical synthesis of graphene
The electrochemical method is an effective tool to modify electronic states via adjusting the external power source to change the Fermi energy level of the materials surface. Thus, electrochemical reduction could provide an extremely rapid and mild green chemical process for synthesizing GN and thin films.78–80 For instance, our group78 and Xia et al.79 independently reported the first example of a simple, efficient, low-cost and environmentally friendly electrochemical method to produce electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ER-GO) films with a low O/C ratio. Digital camera images in Fig. 6a–c show that as the electrochemical reaction proceeds, a yellow-brown/black and approximately circular area grew around the tip of the electrode.78 This could be attributed to the electro-reduction of GO and π-network restoration within the carbon structure of the obtained GN film. SEM images (Fig. 6d–g) show the morphologies of ER-GO films are similar to that of GO films, suggesting electrochemical treatment may not change the morphologies of GO films. Furthermore, we revealed that GN films even with patterned morphology could be deposited on a variety of insulating or conductive substrate surfaces, such as flexible plastic, glass, indium tin oxide (ITO), glassy carbon (GC) and Au. In addition to electrochemical reduction of GO, electrolytic exfoliation of graphite in the presence of dispersing agents has good potential for preparing high-quality GN.81,82 For instance, Luo's group81 developed this approach for the preparation of IL-functionalized GNs with the assistance of an IL and water. Although the above electrochemical strategy provided a green route for obtaining high-quality graphene or its thin film, it is very hard to prepare graphene on a large scale by this method.

2.8 Unzipping carbon nanotube for graphene nanoribbon
Narrow GNRs of <10 nm width are semiconductors, independent of their edge patterns, and thus excellent candidates for use in electronic devices, such as field-effect transistors. At present, existing methods for making GNRs involve lithographic technique,83 chemical,84 sonochemical,85 synthetic methods,86CVD87 and micromechanical cleavage.88 However, most of the above methods produce only minute quantities of GNRs. Recently, unzipping CNTs offered the possibility of large-scale production of narrow GNRs with well-controlled widths. Some interesting unzipping methods such as oxidative treatment of CNTs,89–91plasma etching,92,93 triggered by a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip,94 electrical current and nanomanipulation,95 cut CNTs induced by transition metal nanoparticles (NPs, Ni or Co),96 and high-current pulse burning97 have been developed to effectively unzip CNTs to form GNRs. In particular, two groups have independently reported appealing methods for GNRs production with defined shape, which were both based on the longitudinal unzipping of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs).90,92 Tour et al.90 obtained oxidized GNRs by suspending MWNTs in concentrated sulfuric acid followed by treatment with 500 wt% KMnO4 for 1 h at room temperature and then 1 h at 55–70 °C. They found that KMnO4 is an unusually selective oxidant for longitudinal cleavage of MWNTs. The openings of the nanotubes are sliced either longitudinally (Fig. 7A) or in a spiral manner affording straight-edged ribbons. Actually, since the unzipping process was oxidative, the obtained GNRs possessed many oxygen-containing groups such as carbonyls, carboxyls, epoxides and hydroxyls, at the edge and surface. Therefore, before their use, an additional reduction process should be adopted to transform these nanoribbons to GNRs with lower oxygen content. Meantime, Dai's group92 also employed an unzipping approach to prepare GNRs but through the exposure of the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, etching mask)-MWNT film to an Ar plasma for various times. As shown in Fig. 7B, the widths of the obtained GNRs mostly fell into the range 7–20 nm, which is narrower than that of GNRs made by the sonochemical method.85 Later, Dai et al.93 further developed this technique to prepare aligned GNR arrays by unzipping of aligned single-walled and few-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays. Despite these endeavors, most of methods were limited to the formation of GNRs on substrates or GNRs on a small scale. Therefore, developing a method capable of producing a large amount of high-yield GNRs is necessary. Recently, Dai's group98 successfully solved this problem through developing a two-step process to unzip CNTs in the gas and liquid phases. In their method, pristine MWNTs were first calcined in air at 500 °C, followed by being dispersed in a 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) organic solution of poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene) (PmPV) by sonication, during which the calcined nanotubes were found to unzip into GNRs with high efficiency. After being centrifuged, a high percentage (about 60%) of GNRs were obtained in the supernatant. However, the study of GNRs still remains at the stage of fundamental research. In order to meet the requirement of practical application, there is still a long way to develop more effective and economical strategies for improving the amount and yield of GNRs.

2.9 Template route for graphene
The rich availability of one-dimensional metal, oxide and polymer nanobelts provide good templates for high-throughput synthesis of high-quality GNs with well-defined shape.99,100 Liu et al.99 developed a template (ZnS nanoribbon) method assisted by CVD for scalable synthesis of few-layer GNRs (FLGRs) with controlled morphologies. Fig. 8a shows a schematic diagram of the template-CVD growth of the FLGRs. The ZnS ribbons were first produced on an Si substrate by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method (Fig. 8b, c), and then served as the template and provided large surface area for GN growth (the ZnS/GN composite nanosheets are shown in Fig. 8d, e). Finally, the composite nanosheets were immersed in 0.1 M HCl for 30 min in order to remove undesirable ZnS nanobelts. Scalable samples of FLGRs (Fig. 8h) with well controlled morphologies were produced on Si substrates (Fig. 8f, g). Later, Li's group100 further described a new template strategy for producing high-quality single-layer GNs using a confined self-assembly approach within lamellar mesostructured silica. It is interestingly noted that their preparation procedure was controllable and could be used to produce GN on a gram scale. Although the above template methods provide a new alternative to the other existing methods for the preparation of high-quality GNs, the synthesis and removal of template require long times and complicated procedures. Particularly, the removal of the template may bring a negative effect to the obtained GNs, which is disadvantageous for electronic applications.

2.10 Total organic synthesis of graphene
With the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, the bottom-up method has been proven to be a much used strategy for preparing advanced nanomaterials with different size, shape, composition and architectures. Considering that graphene is composed of many interconnected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, very small two-dimensional graphene segments), organic synthetic protocols could probably provide an effective route for controllable synthesis of graphene with different sizes.101–112 At present, the design and synthesis of PAH is still a key step for obtaining high-quality graphene with high yield. Since Clar et al.101 first synthesized hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene, a small GN with 42 carbon atoms in 1958, PAH has been attracting considerable interest as a possible alternative route to graphene. Müllen and Schlüter et al. made enormous contributions to this field and wrote several excellent review articles about PAH.102–108 For instance, Müllen et al.102 proposed a successful route for synthesizing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with carbon atom number up to 222 by combining Diels–Alder reactions with the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to give planar graphene discs. In 2008, Müllen et al.104 reported an important advance on organic synthesis of linear GNRs with length up to 12 nm through two-dimensional extension towards one direction. However, in general, the increasing face-to-face attraction interactions between graphenes with increasing size usually lead to limited solubility. Recently, Li's group11,109 successfully solved this problem, reporting a stepwise solution chemistry route for the synthesis of large colloidal graphene QDs containing 168, 132 and 170 conjugated carbon atoms, respectively (Fig. 9); the as-prepared graphene QDs are the largest stable colloidal graphene QDs reported so far. In addition, another important contribution is from Wang's group,110–112 who constructed GNRs by repeating the perylene bisimides 1(PBI) unit in one dimension. However, further two-dimensional extension of the graphene molecules becomes increasingly demanding, and the organic synthetic method for graphene QDs with bigger size usually resulted in the limited solubility and the occurrence of side reactions. Therefore, it is still a significant challenge for organic chemists to synthesize big graphene molecules with well-defined shapes, sizes, and edge structures in large scale.

In summary, recent advances on various methods to fabricate GNs has been demonstrated in detail. In general, cost, throughput, size of sheets, layer of sheets, edge of sheets, quality of sheets, chemical modification, and compatibility with commercial chip fabrication process are among the most notable considerations in selecting a method to synthesize GNs for potential applications in different fields. In order to enable the reader better understand the significant developments of GN synthesis, the comparisons of different aspects among these established routes of graphene synthesis are summarized in Table 1.

3. Molecular engineering of graphene
To realize GN-based practical applications in different fields, various types of GNs with diverse properties and functions are strongly needed; thus, the modulation of its electrical, optical and mechanical properties is of great technological importance. Molecular engineering of nanomaterials (e.g.graphene), which involves forming different covalent or noncovalent bonds with other atoms or molecules on the interface of nanomaterials (e.g.graphene) results in different doping or modification of nanomaterials, is an effective route for tuning the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials (e.g.graphene). For instance, interaction of GN with electron-donor and electron-acceptor molecules can cause marked changes in the electronic structure and properties of GN.2 At present, molecular engineering of GNs by solubilization, doping and chemical functionalization plays a crucial role in tuning their properties and further exploring the applications of the resulting compounds in nanoelectronic devices, electrochemical devices and composite materials. In this section, we will provide some new advances on molecular engineering of GNs with an emphasis on covalent functionalization and doping.
One of the most important means to adjust the properties and improve the function of GN is to chemically functionalize its surfaces with different functional molecules. Nowadays, chemical functionalization of GN has focused on improving its solubility/processability in both water and organic solvents in order to tune or introduce or enhance its new function or properties. As introduced in section 2, noncovalent functionalization of GN is of interest for the solubilization of GN because it enables the attachment of molecules through π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions, while partly tuning the properties of GN. Compared with noncovalent functionalization, due to the stronger interaction between GN and molecules, covalent functionalization of GN provides more opportunities for tuning its properties and functions, thus leading to new application or enhanced application performance. At present, some typical organic reactions such as diazonium,113–115 nucleophilic ring-opening,116,117 carbodiimide-activated esterification,1181,3-dipolar cycloaddition,119amide bond formation,120in situ living free-radical polymerization,121etc. have been reported to functionalize GN. For example, Niu et al.116 reported a facile wet-chemical method to obtain polydisperse chemically-converted GNs that are covalently functionalized with IL. Fig. 10 illustrates the schematic process for the preparation of IL-functionalized GN. A nucleophilic ring-opening reaction between the epoxy groups of GO and the amine group of an amine-terminated IL, which was catalyzed by NaOH, occurred, as proved by infrared spectroscopy. The resulting GNs could be stably dispersed in water, N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Another interesting result is from Ye's work, which demonstrated a novel process for preparing “amphiphilic” GNs through in situ living free-radical polymerization between polystyrene–polyacrylamide copolymer with GN.121

On the other hand, chemical doping is also important to modulate the electrical properties of GN. Devising new doping methods for GNs will be significant for fundamental and technical studies because doped GN materials promise many fascinating properties and widespread potential applications such as field-effect transistors122 and electrochemical sensors.123 Actually, GN is readily p-doped by adsorbates, but for device applications, it would be useful to access the n-doped material for extending its electronics applications. GN with edges terminated by nitrogen species was shown to be electron-rich, leading to n-type transistor behavior.122 At present, great progress has been made for preparing nitrogen-doped GN in the past several years through some interesting routes such as high-power electrical annealing GN in NH3,122 arc discharge in the presence of H2+pyridine or H2 + ammonia,124 thermal annealing of GO in ammonia,125 direct current arc-discharge between pure graphite rods in the presence of NH3,126CVD in the presence of NH3127 and plasma treatment in N2, etc.123 A prominent example is by Dai et al.122 who reported a edge doping process for preparing individual GNRs covalently functionalized by nitrogen species through high-power electrical joule heating in ammonia gas. The obtained N-doped GN exhibited high performance for a room-temperature n-type field-effect transistor. In addition, B-doped GN have been prepared by two methods involving arc discharge of graphite electrodes in the presence of H2 and B2H6124 and by carrying out arc discharge using a B-filled graphite electrodes.2
4. Assembling graphene for functional films or architectures
Constructing 2D or 3D assembling architectures using nanoscaled materials as functional building blocks is a very exciting research topic due to their potentially enhanced functions. Particularly, effectively controlling the periodic structures of the 2D or 3D assembling nanomaterials over large areas is essential for functional nanomaterial applications that require the integration of the properties of the disparate materials. GN shows great potential as an advanced building block for developing different functional films containing polymer, metal, semiconductor, oxide, magnetic and other nanomaterials. Advances in dispersing, processing and molecular engineering of GN outlined above have facilitated the fabrication of GN monolayers, thin films and free-standing GN paper by developing advanced methods such as CVD,24spray-coating128 and vacuum filtration.129–131 In this section, we will provide some recent advances on developing new assembling techniques for accurately constructing GN-based functional films or architectures with desirable thickness and compositions.
Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a powerful and versatile means for fabricating ultrathin multilayer films at variable coverage on an arbitrary surface with controlled architecture and compositions. As introduced above, controllable molecular engineering of GN could endow it new surface properties with negative or positive charges, which provide new GN-based functional building blocks for constructing 2D or 3D assembling films or architectures. Considerable efforts have been made to fabricate different GN-based thin films through LBL techniques.132–136 For instance, Yeet al.132 constructed a multilayer film through LBL assembling two kinds of GNs modified with positive or negative polyelectrolytes by covalent binding, respectively. A novel method for constructing LBL assemblies of GN and gold NPs by vacuum filtration of a reduced GO solution and spontaneous reduction of gold ions on the GN films was reported.133 Our group succeeded in constructing a hybrid 3D nanocomposite film by alternatively assembling GNs modified by IL and Pt NPs.134 Yu et al.135 reported that alternating GN and titania (Ti0.91O2) multilayered nanosheets were fabricated using LBL electrostatic deposition followed by UV irradiation. More recently, Seo et al.136 established highly uniform in situ poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)–graphene free-standing composite films by combining an LBL assembling technique with spin-coating control. Therefore, effectively combining different functional nanomaterials with GN, new assembling architectures with different functions can be expected.

Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is another technique for constructing GN-based thin film with controllable GN alignment. It offers several advantages over related nanomaterial deposition techniques such as LBL assembly. (1) The electrophoretic deposition of GN films does not require the addition of any cross-linking molecules or binders. (2) Electrophoretic deposition can yield better packing and alignment of the GN components as compared to spray-coating techniques. (3) High deposition rate and throughput, good uniformity and controlled thickness of the obtained films should also be emphasized.137 Inspired by these advantages, several groups have employed this technique to prepare GN-based thin films.137,138 For instance, Cheng et al.137 applied the EPD technique to fabricate homogeneous single-layer GN films, and investigated the field-emission properties of these films. In their technique, charged GNs in a liquid-phase suspension are first forced to move toward the oppositely charged electrode under an electric field, and then coherently deposited onto the surface of an electrically conductive electrode. However, for this technique, a stable GN suspension is a prerequisite for obtaining high-quality GN thin films.

Directed self-assembly of nano- or microsized particles at the liquid–liquid interface is a potentially alternative approach to fabricate a particle monolayer or multilayer in a regular 2D array in a controllable manner.139 In our previous contribution,140 we have shown this technique could be used to assemble rectangular silver nanorods into a 2D film. Similarly, GN could also be assembled into an 2D ultrathin film using this technique.139,141 Drzal's group139 demonstrated this by preparing a monolayer of ultrathin sheets of highly hydrophobic GNs on a large area substrate viaself-assembly at the liquid–liquid interface. In addition, other novel techniques such as Langmuir–Schaefer,142 Langmuir–Blodgett,143 electrostatic attraction,144 and noble-metal-promoted macroassembly,145etc. have been used to prepare high-quality GN-based thin films. Here, Wang's work145 should be highlighted, demonstrating that the 3D assembly of reduced GO into macroscopic porous structures has been achieved successfully with the assistance of noble metal NPs. Fig. 11 shows that different metal NPs such as Pd, Au, Pt, Ir and Rh could promote the assembly of GN into macroscopic architectures with porous structure, indicating this is a general method for constructing GN/metal NPs composite films. Additionally, recently, a simple, one-step hydrothermal treatment of GO aqueous solution for preparing a self-assembled graphene hydrogel (SGH) was presented by Shi et al.146 The as-prepared SGH, which was composed of self-assembled graphene macrostructures with three-dimensional networks, was electrically conductive, mechanically strong, and thermally stable and exhibited a high specific capacitance.

        Graphene-based hybrids
With the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, appropriate combination of different nanoscale materials with different morphologies or shape or components may lead to the development of multifunctional nano-assembled systems that simultaneously exhibit novel optical, electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties and even have enhanced performance. In particular, at present, the synthesis and design of multicomponent hybrid nanostructures containing at least one GN component is topical owing to the particular properties of GN and synergistic properties induced by different functional nanoscale objects. However, before high-quality GN-based hybrids are designed, several key issues should be taken into consideration. (1) GN should be exist in the form of individual nanosheets in the corresponding hybrids in order to effectively enhance the function of GN. (2) Designing bifunctional linker or molecular “glue” can adhere NPs onto the surface of GNs. (3) NPs should be uniformly distributed on the surface of GNs with controllable density in order to tune the performance of hybrids. (4) Accurately controlling the size, morphology and component of nanomaterials should be also emphasized. It should be noted that graphene modified with organic molecules, polymer, ILs and POMs, etc. mentioned in sections 2 and 3, can be classified as graphene-based hybrids. However, in this section, we will mainly highlight some recent achievements on how to develop effective strategies for synthesizing high-quality GN–inorganic nanomaterials hybrids.
5.1 
          Graphene/metal hybrids
Metal NP decorated GNs are an example of emerging metal–carbon hybrid materials that currently attract special research efforts due to their good potential as enhanced materials for electrochemical and analytical applications. At present, several strategies have been developed to prepare GN/metal (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Cu or bimetallic) hybrids. For instance, the aqueous-phase route, as one of most popular strategies, has been developed to synthesize GN-based hybrids. Some typical examples include the synthesis of GN/Pd NPs hybrids through the reduction of Pd2+-exchanged chemically derived GNs;147 use of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as both surfactant and the reducing agent for the preparation of GN/Pd NPs hybrids;148 a two-step reduction strategy for GN/Ag NPs hybrids;149 the preparation of GN–metal (Au, Pt and Pd) NP nanocomposites in a water–ethylene glycol system using GO as a precursor and ethylene glycol as reducing agent;150 seed-mediated growth of GN/Au dendrites and Au nanorod hybrids,151,152etc. Furthermore, organic-phase routes could also provide a new avenue for obtaining GN/metal hybrids. A representative example is that El-Shall's group has developed a facile and scalable chemical reduction method assisted by microwave irradiation for the synthesis of metal (Pd, Cu and PdCu) NPs dispersed on GNs in a mixture of oleylamine and oleic acid.153 Despite these great progresses, the obtained GN/metal hybrids obtained through the above methods suffer from some drawbacks such as polydisperse size and non-uniform distribution in terms of the GN and hybrid nanosheet aggregation, etc. Self-assembly provides a very powerful strategy for preparing high-quality GN/metal hybrids with tunable NPs density because there are a large number of methods for synthesizing high-quality metal NPs with different sizes, components, shapes, etc.154–156 For instance, just recently, Deng et al.156 reported a general approach to prepare GN/metal (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd) hybrid nanosheets by self-assembly bovine serum albumin (BSA) protected GNs and metal NPs. It was thought that a multiple-interaction such as specific chemical bondings between BSA and metal NPs due to the presence of thiol, amine, and imidazole groups in BSA, and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions should facilitate the formation of the above hybrids. Fig. 12 shows typical TEM images of BSA–GNs and its NP assemblies. It is found that different metal NPs such as Au, Pt and Pd are uniformly distributed on the GNs, evidencing the well-behaved assembly process.

Pd NPs had a worm-like shape ∼4 nm in one dimension. Reprinted from ref. 156 with permission by the American Chemical Society. 
5.2 
          Graphene/oxide hybrids
In the past decades, oxide nanomaterials have received considerable attention due to their providing rich optical, electronic and magnetic properties and important applications in the field of biomedicine, optoelectronics, energy and sensors, etc. However, the more rapid development of these oxide materials is limited from their intrinsic properties, though effectively controlling the complex and unusual morphologies can further improve their application performance. The development of oxide–GN composites provides an important milestone to improve the applications performances of oxide nanomaterials in different fields such as energy harvesting, conversion and storage device, nanoelectronics, nano-optics and conductors, etc., because the hybrids have versatile and tailor-made properties with performances superior to those of the individual oxide nanomaterials. However, one of the main obstacles in processing GN–oxide hybrids lies in the difficulty of dispersing GN homogeneously throughout the oxide matrix since agglomeration deteriorates the electrical, optical and magnetic properties of the composite. In this section, novel methods for constructing GNs/oxide hybrids are highlighted.
In order to construct high-quality GN/oxide hybrids, three important points should be paid attention to. (a) GN should have high solubility in the solution throughout the experiments, which is important for keeping GN as individual sheets to maximize its performance in the hybrids. (b) The surface of GN should contain some oxygen-containing groups in order to promote the effective linking between GN and oxide. (c) Meantime, the morphology of the oxide should be controlled to the desirable structure in order to optimize its properties, though achieving this point is still a great challenge. Driven by these important key points, some groups have developed novel routes to synthesize GN/oxide hybrids with the oxide components being SiO2,157,158Fe2O3,159TiO2,135,160–162Co(OH)2,163SnO2,164–166ZnO,167,168Al2O3,169Co3O4,170MnO2,171Fe3O4,172,173 and clay,174etc. For example, Kamat et al.160 succeeded in carrying out UV-induced photocatalytic reduction of GO and obtaining well-separated GN–TiO2 composite sheets. Park et al.167 demonstrated that ZnO nanorod–GN hybrid architectures composed of regular arrays of ZnO nanorods could be readily obtained through a ZnO seed mediated growth process, and transferred to transparent and/or flexible substrates. Yu's group172 presented a simple in situ method to efficiently decorate GNs with magnetite NPs through high-temperature decomposition of an Fe(acac)3 precursor in polyol, which could be used as an enhanced magnetic resonance contrast agent. However, the quality of the obtained graphene/oxide hybrids is rather low. Recently, Müllen et al.157 developed a bottom-up approach to the large-scale production of 2D sandwich-like high-quality GN/mesoporous silica hybrid nanosheets in which each GN is fully separated by a mesoporous silica shell. Fig. 13 shows typical TEM images of GN/mesoporous silica hybrids at different magnifications. From the magnified image (Fig. 13b), it is found that the resulting sheets possess numerous mesopores with size of about 2 nm. Besides, our group162 has developed a novel and facile process for water-phase synthesis of high-quality graphene/TiO2 composite hybrid nanosheets on a large scale using TiCl3 as both a reducing agent and a precursor. However, at present, reports on high-quality graphene/oxide hybrids are still rare157,162 and their synthesis need be further explored.

QDs, as a new class of fluorescent probes with higher sensitivity and better photostability and chemical stability than conventional organic fluorophore markers, have been attracting wide interest due to their unique size-dependent optical absorption and potential applications in biological imaging. For this aspect of application, one needs to develop new techniques to enhance the opportunity of recombination of electron–hole species. In contrast, for optoelectronic applications, it is essential to promote the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs for improving the optoelectronic response. At present, effective strategies that have been tried include the introduction of nanomaterials with suitable band energy as efficient acceptors. The superior electrical conductivity and the flexible atom-thin 2D feature of GN would make it an excellent electron-transport matrix.175,176 Cao et al.175 developed for the first time a one-step method to synthesize GN–CdS hybrids directly from GO in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, as both reductant and precursor for S2−), where the reduction of GO and the deposition of CdS on GN occurred simultaneously. Fig. 14 shows typical atomic force microscopy (AFM, a), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, b, c) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, d) images of GN–CdS hybrids. It is observed that CdS NPs could be uniformly deposited on the surface of GN with controllable density. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of GN–CdS hybrids reveals a picosecond-scale ultrafast electron transfer process from the excited CdS to GN. Other QDs such as CdSe,177,178 ZnS179 and Au180 have also been combined with GN to prepare the corresponding hybrids. Liu et al.177 developed a self-assembly strategy for the preparation of hybrids of GN and CdSe QDs via π–π stacking of aromatic structures between GN and CdSe QDs capped with pyridine. Later, a linker-free connected GN/CdSe NPs nanocomposite was reported by Wang et al.,178 wherein the strategy of in situ growing CdSe NPs onto GNs has been adopted, while Zhang's group180 developed a photochemical method for one-pot synthesis and meantime in situassembly of fluorescent Au dots on GN, on which 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) was preabsorbed. Interestingly, the Au dots self-assembled into ordered NP chains along the 〈100〉 directions of the GN surface.

          Graphene/carbon nanotube hybrids
The unique electrical and mechanical properties as well as large surface area of GNs have enabled them be a new class of conducting materials for device, electrochemical and analytical applications. However, frequently used GN obtained from chemical reduction strategy suffers from surface defects and readily forms aggregated structures, which greatly impact their application performance. At present, improving the conductivity of GN-based films and obtaining good control of architecture/property is a very hot topic for enhancing its application prospects. The use of 1D CNTs to physically separate 2D GNs to preserve the high surface area of GN and meantime act as the conducting carrier is an attractive idea and highly desirable. Some recent attempts have been made to fabricate GN/CNTs hybrid films by spin-coating homogeneously mixed solutions of the two carbon-based nanomaterials.181,182 However, the hybrid films thus prepared still consisted of aggregated thick GN layers with relatively poor controllability. In order to overcome this, further investigation was undertaken by Dai et al.,183 who reported on the fabrication of large-area multicomponent hybrid films by sequential self-assembly of cationic poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) functionalized GNs and CNTs via electrostatic interactions onto various substrates. More recently, Kim et al.184 developed a LBL assembly technique for constructing transparent, flexible conducting hybrid multilayer thin films of MWNTs with graphene, which involves the electrostatic interactions of positively charged MWNTs and negatively charged graphene. The obtained hybrid multilayer exhibited a significant increase of electronic conductivity and could be used as a highly flexible and transparent electrode. Besides, a more accurate control of a CNT–GN hybrid film with overlapped GN and vertical CNTs was successfully developed by deposition of GO film from aqueous colloidal suspensions, followed by decoration with patterned catalyst NPs, and then CVD-assisted growth of the CNT array, which could be transferred onto flexible and/or nonplanar substrates.185 Later, Fan et al.186 further prepared 3D CNT/graphene sandwich structures with CNT pillars grown in between the graphene layers by the CVD approach. However, at present, the synthesis of a pillared GN model (proposed by Froudakis et al.)187 with rich tunable pores, which consists of parallel sheets or 'floors' of GN connected together by vertical columns of CNTs, is still very difficult to achieve.

        Graphene-based energy applications
At present, developing efficient and “clean” energy technologies is an urgent task and is crucial to the long-term energy and environmental security of our society. The novel physical and chemical properties of nanostructured materials promise many advanced applications in the development of new energy and chemical conversion technologies.188GN, an excellent 2D support, plays an important role on maximizing the activity of supported nanomaterials with different sizes, shapes, chemical compositions, and heterojunctions. Further, GN has high surface area, excellent conductivity, good stability, extremely high electron mobility, excellent optical transparency and good mechanical performance, etc. All the interesting characteristics are very important for possibly improving the activity, stability and durability for energy applications. Recently, Liet al.13 published an excellent subtopical overview on graphene nanoelectrochemistry, which gave an introduction in the aspect of graphene energy application before 2009. In order to avoid unnecessary overlap, in this section, we will provide a more systematic overview on how GNs can be applied to a new generation of chemical and energy conversion devices such as fuel cells, supracapacitors, lithium ion batteries, biofuel cells and solar cells, with a particular focus on more recent developments of graphene-based hybrids for energy applications.
6.1 
          Graphene-based fuel cell applications
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that oxidizes fuel at the anode and reduces oxygen from air at the cathode to produce electricity.189 Considerable efforts have been dedicated to the fabrication of efficient fuel cells featuring high energy densities, low operating temperatures, and low environmental impacts.189 At present, the search for excellent electrocatalysts (the most key component for a fuel cell) for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and fuel oxidation reactions, which are the two important cathodic and anodic reactions in fuel cells, is intensively pursued by scientists around the world. Carbon nanomaterial supported noble metal (particularly Pt) NPs are still the best choice as advanced nanoelectrocatalysts for fuel cells. GN as a 2D support could provide good opportunity for the dispersion of metal NPs to enhance their electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells due to its large surface area, good conductivity and excellent chemical stability.
Several groups have explored advanced techniques for preparing GN/Pt NP hybrids and further used the hybrids for enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Interesting examples include ethylene glycol as both reductive and dispersing agent for deposition of Pt NPs on GN,190 synthesis of GN/Pt NP hybrids using NaBH4 as reductant,191,192 the preparation of Pt subnanoclusters on GN using H2 as reductant,193 and a “green” electrochemical synthetic route for GN/Pt NPs hybrids,194,195etc. All contributions reveal that GN/Pt NPs hybrids exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity towards MOR than the commercial catalysts. Furthermore, bimetallic Pt/Ru196,197 and Pt–Pd NPs198 supported on GN have also been obtained for enhancing methanol electrooxidation. One interesting example is that our group198 reported a wet-chemical approach for the synthesis of high-quality 3D Pt-on-Pd bimetallic nanodendrites supported on GNs, as shown in Fig. 15. The electrochemical results revealed that the as-prepared GN/bimetallic nanodendrite hybrids exhibited much higher electrocatalytic activity and stability toward MOR than the platinum black and commercial E-TEK Pt/C catalysts. In addition, GN/Pt NPs hybrids have been applied as advanced nanoelectrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).199,200 For instance, Liu et al.199 reported that Pt NPs with the size of about 2 nm were uniformly supported on GN, which exhibited a higher electrochemical surface area and oxygen reduction activity with improved stability as compared with the commercial E-TEK C/Pt catalyst. Another important finding for GN-based catalyst is from Dai's work,201 which demonstrated that nitrogen-doped GN could act as a metal-free catalyst with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than Pt for ORRvia a four-electron pathway in alkaline fuel cells.

In addition to traditional fuel cells, the trend towards the miniaturization and portability of computing and communication devices has brought about the rapid development of biofuel cells (BFCs).202 Among the BFCs, enzyme-based BFCs by adopting enzymes as catalysts have received most interest because they can be used as an in vivo power source for implantable medical devices such as pacemakers, micro drug pumps and deep brain stimulators, etc.203 At present, nanostructured electrode materials can provide the great potential for immobilizing enzyme to enhance the electron shuttling between enzyme and electrode and meantime keeping the bioactivity of enzyme, which is paramount for improving the efficiency and stability of BFCs. GN, as an excellent candidate, has recently been employed as an enhanced material for BFC application.204,205 For instance, Liet al.204 for the first time employed GN as an electrode material for constructing biofuel cells. As shown in Fig. 16, the anode of their biofuel cell consists of a gold electrode, on which GN-glucose oxidase (GOD) was co-immobilized using silica sol–gel matrix. The cathode was constructed in a similar method except that GN was co-immobilized with bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The GN-based biofuel cell exhibited a maximum power density of about 24.3 ± 4 μW, which is nearly two times greater than that of the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) BFC. Later, Zheng's group205 further demonstrated a GN-based glucose/O2BFC with GOD as the anodic biocatalyst and the laccase as the cathodic biocatalyst. The maximum power density of this biofuel cell was about 57.8 μW cm−2. Additionally, GN/metal NPs hybrids are attractive research topics to further improve the performance of BFCs, however, the study on this aspect is scarcely developed.

6.2 
          Graphene-based energy storage application (supercapacitor and hydrogen storage)
Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, exhibit faster and higher power capability, long life, wide thermal operating range, and low maintenance cost. There are two main classes of supercapacitor based upon charge storage mechanism: electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance. EDLC generally arises from the charge separation at the electrode/electrolyte interface whereas pseudocapacitance is caused by faradaic reactions occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface.206 Nowadays, tremendous research efforts on supercapacitors are aimed at increasing power and energy density as well as lowering fabrication costs. Remarkable improvements in performance have been achieved in recent years through the development of advanced carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanofibers and CNTs. Another attractive approach is to combine a pseudocapacitive material such as redox oxides, and polymers with carbon nanomaterials. GN exhibits very large surface area, good electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, excellent mechanical properties and potential low manufacturing cost, which render it an excellent candidate for advanced electrode materials for supercapacitor.
Two GN-based supercapacitor application studies have initially been reported with the specific capacitance of 117 F g−1 in aqueous H2SO4207 and 135 F g−1 in aqueous electrolyte208 based on a multilayered GN material. However, in their experiments, multilayer or aggregated GN was used, which reduces the surface area (e.g. 705 m2 g−1208), thus leading to low specific capacitance. Later, Chen et al.209 reported the use of a gas–solid reduction process to prepare GN for supercapacitor application with an improved specific capacitance up to 205 F g−1. Furthermore, Yang et al.210 found that low-temperature exfoliated GNs demonstrated an excellent energy storage performance, and the electrochemical capacitance (264 F g−1 in aqueous solution) is much higher than that of the high-temperature exfoliated ones. Despite their good stability during the charge/discharge process, the specific capacitance of GN for supercapacitors is still low. Recently, a significant improvement on electrochemical capacitance of GN-based materials was successfully demonstrated by Fan et al.,186 who found that 3D CNT/graphene sandwich structures with CNT pillars grown in between the graphene layers could be used as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. A maximum specific capacitance of 385 F g−1 could be obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Besides, the incorporation of GN into pseudocapacitive materials such as redox oxides and polymers, etc. is a promising avenue for improving the specific capacitance because of the synergetic effect from the two kinds of nanomaterials. However, the key point for achieving high specific capacitance and stability is that high-quality GNs should be dispersed as individual nanosheets in the corresponding composites. Several groups have explored some novel strategies to synthesize GN-based nanocomposites containing polyaniline,211–217MnO2,171 and Co(OH)2,163etc. for enhancing the electrochemical capacitance. One of the very interesting examples is that Cheng et al.214 prepared a flexible supercapacitor by the use of a freestanding and flexible GN/polyaniline composite paper as electrode material, which was synthesized via in situ anodic electropolymerization of polyaniline film on graphene paper. Fig. 17 shows the typical digital camera images of graphene paper. Interestingly, these graphene papers could be freely bent and folded. This flexible composite paper exhibited high capacitance. However, the capacitance of their GN/polyaniline composite was mainly dominated by the pseudocapacitance from the polyaniline films coated on the graphene paper surface, and the electric double layer capacitance from GN was less utilized due to the agglomerated layer-like structure in the graphene paper.213 In 2010, Wu's group213 demonstrated the synthesis of GN/polyaniline composites using an in situpolymerization method, aimed at achieving a homogeneous dispersion of individual GN within the polymer matrix for further improving the specific capacitance. A specific capacitance of as high as 480 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 was achieved over a PANI-doped graphene composite. Furthermore, GN/polyaniline composites with an appropriate weight ratio prepared using in situpolymerization by Wei et al.216 exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 1046 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 due to the synergistic effect between GNs and polyaniline. In addition, recently, Wang's group163 synthesized graphene–Co(OH)2 nanocomposite and further studied its supercapacitor application. They found that electrochemical specific capacitance of the obtained hybrids reached a value as high as 972.5 F g−1, leading to a significant improvement relative to each individual counterpart (137.6 and 726.1 F g−1 for graphene and Co(OH)2). Despite the above great efforts, high-quality GN-based hybrids are still required to develop higher-performance electrode materials for supercapacitor application.

The search for new hydrogen storage materials has been attracting a great deal of interest due to their important role for clean energy techniques. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), transition metal (e.g.Pd), mesoporous materials and carbon nanomaterials, etc. are several typical hydrogen storage materials. Among them, carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and fullerene are of great interest due to their low density, chemical stability, suitability for high-throughput production, wide variety of structural forms, and the ability to modify the surface area, etc.218 As a new member of carbon nanomaterials, graphene has been explored as a new hydrogen storage material in recent years.187,218–221 In 2008, Froudakis et al.187 theoretically designed a novel, three-dimensional carbon nanostructure (parallel sheets or ‘floors’ of graphene connected together by vertical columns of CNTs). Ab initio and grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations reveals that if this material is doped with lithium cations, it can store up to 41 g H2 L−1 under ambient conditions, almost meeting the US Department of Energy (DOE) targets for volumetric hydrogen storage. Interestingly, Zhang's group221 found that Ti-anchored GO could theoretically offer a feasible solution for hydrogen storage. The estimated theoretical gravimetric and volumetric densities are 4.9 wt% and 64 g L−1, respectively. However, it is very hard for graphene-based nanomaterials to experimentally reach such high theoretical density until now. For instance, Ruoff et al.218 prepared a graphene-based powder sample by chemical reduction of a colloidal suspension of exfoliated graphite oxide with a BET surface area of 640 m2 g−1. The hydrogen adsorption capacity of the obtained graphene is only 0.68 wt% at 77 K and 1 bar.

          Graphene-based lithium ion battery applications

          Lithium-ion batteries (LIB), as power sources for mobile communication devices, portable electronic devices, electrical/hybrid vehicles, and miscellaneous power devices, have attracted special attention from different scientific communities due to their high electromotive force and high energy density.164 Many potential electrode materials (e.g., graphite, transition metal oxide, transition metal phosphide and metal, etc.) in LIB are limited by slow Li-ion diffusion, poor electron transport in electrodes, and increased resistance at the interface of electrode/electrolyte at high charge–discharge rates.222 Therefore, there has been great interest in designing and developing new electrode materials with high lithium storage capacity, coulombic efficiency and long cycling life for LIB. Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, GN holds great promise for application in LIB.223–225 For instance, Song et al.223 reported that GN exhibited a relatively high reversible capacity of 672 mA h g−1 and fine cycle performance, which has a much enhanced performance relative to graphite. Another important finding was given by Zhao et al.,225 who reported that disordered GNs could exhibited higher reversible capacities (794–1054 mA h g−1), being suggested to be ascribed to additional reversible storage sites on GN such as edges and other defects.
Another way to improve the capacity and cycle performance is to introduce GN-based hybrid nanostructured electrodes with another component being popular LIB materials such as oxide, metal and carbon, etc. At present, much research has been made to explore new GN-based composite electrode materials to enhance electron transport, reduce the volume expansion/contraction during charge–discharge period, and reduce transport length of Li ion, etc. Typical examples include GN/TiO2,222GN/SnO2,164,166,226,227GN/CNTs,228GN/Co3O4,229GN/Co(OH)2,230GN/Sn,231GN/Si,232–234 and GN/ceramic hybrid electrode materials.235 For instance, Homma et al.164 demonstrated a self-assembly strategy for constructing GN/SnO2 NPs hybrids, which exhibited a high reversible capacity of 810 mA h g−1 and better cycling performance than that of SnO2 NPs. Later, Liu et al.222 developed an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) mediated growth of self-assembled GN/TiO2 hybrid nanostructures, showing significantly enhanced Li-ion insertion/extraction in TiO2. More recently, Cheng's group229 reported a facile strategy for synthesizing GN/Co3O4 NPs hybrids as an advanced anode material for high-performance LIBs. Fig. 18a–c shows the charge/discharge profiles of GN (a), Co3O4 (b) and GN/Co3O4 composite (c) electrodes in the 1st, 5th, 10th and 20th cycles. It is observed that the first discharge and charge capacities are 2179 and 955 mA h g−1 for GN, 1105 and 817 mA h g−1 for Co3O4, and 1097 and 753 mA h g−1 for GN/Co3O4 composite electrodes. After the second cycle, however, the GN/Co3O4 composite electrode showed much better electrochemical lithium storage performance than the Co3O4 electrode. Furthermore, the GN/Co3O4 composite exhibited a much better cycling performance than GN and Co3O4, as shown in Fig. 18d. It was suggested that the synergetic effect between conducting GNs and Co3O4 NPs should be responsible for the excellent LIB performance via the maximum utilization of electrochemically active area of GN and Co3O4 NPs. Despite these successful demonstrations, there is still large scope for materials and electrochemistry scientists to explore or extend new high-quality GN-based composites with controllable assembling architectures and tunable size, shape and morphologies of NPs for LIB applications.

          Graphene-based solar cell applications
The interest in solar cells has long been motivated by the need to supplement or even replace fossil fuels with clean and renewable energy resources. Nowadays, four main kinds of solar cells (dye-sensitized solar cell, organic solar cell, QD-based and silicon-based solar cell) have received special attention. Among them, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are a very promising technology for converting sunlight into electrical energy due to their relatively high power conversion efficiencies.236GN shows the good potential for application in DSSC due to its unique physical and chemical properties. One of interesting advances is that Müllen et al.237 developed a GN film electrode with good chemical and thermal stabilities, high transparency and excellent conductivity to replace traditional ITO and fluorine tin oxide (FTO) for DSSC. GN can also be used as an advanced doped component for TiO2 photoanodes to enhance the chance of carrier separation. For instance, Lee et al.236 developed a molecular grafting combined electrophoretic deposition method for the incorporation of GNs into TiO2 NP films. The detailed preparation process is schematically shown in Fig. 19. The resulting GN/TiO2 composite film exhibited much higher conductivity and higher loading amount of dyes than the TiO2 NPs films. In particular, the power conversion efficiency for DSSC based on GN/TiO2 composite films is more than five times higher than that based on TiO2 alone, indicating that the incorporation of GN is an efficient means for enhancing the photovoltaic performance. In addition, GN could be used as good counter-electrode materials when combined with polystyreneslufonate doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-PSS), which was demonstrated by Shi et al.238 They found that the energy conversion efficiency of the cell with GN/PEDOT-PSS film as counter electrode reached 4.5%, which was comparable to 6.3% of the cell with expensive platinum counter electrode under the same experimental condition.

On the other hand, organic solar cells have also been proposed as a means to achieve low-cost energy due to their ease of manufacture, light weight, and compatibility with flexible substrates.239 At present, the great progress of GNs on organic solar cells is focused on three main aspects. One is still to develop advanced techniques for the preparation of GN-based film electrodes with high transparency and excellent conductivity to displace traditional expensive and brittle ITO and FTO in organic photovoltaics.239,240 Zhou,239 Müllen,240 and Peumans et al.,241 successfully demonstrated this point through developing GN film electrodes using an effective CVD method, a new bottom-up chemical approach, and chemical reduction method, respectively. Another important role of GN in organic solar cells is that GN could act as an excellent acceptor material for favoring more efficient electron–hole separation.242–246 Chen et al.242 presented the first fabrication and performance studies of photovoltaic devices with bulk heterojunction structure using an organic solution-processed GN material as a new electron-accepter material and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) as donor materials. This device could give a power conversion efficiency of 1.4%. Later, Zhang et al.246 demonstrated the electrochemical deposition of ZnO nanomaterials on GN and then employing these nanocomposites to fabricate inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency of 0.31% was lower than those of Chen et al.242–244 and but higher than those of other GN-based solar cells.240,247 The third important aspect is that GN-base film can be used as an efficient hole transport layer for organic solar cell applications.247,248
It should be noted that at present, GN could be also used as an efficient acceptor to enhance photo-induced charge transfer for QD or silicon-based solar cell applications.176 Through employing sequential chemical bath deposition and electrophoretic deposition techniques, Liet al.176 reported a novel layered GN/QDs nanofilm to fabricate a photovoltaic device using GN as acceptor, which exhibited the best performance in all reported carbon/QD solar cells. Quan's group249 contributed to design a macroporous Si (MPSi)/graphene heterojunction by depositing graphene on the surface of MPSi. They found that graphene could be used as a protective layer and charge collector for MPSi to improve its ability to convert solar to chemical energy.

        Graphene-based analytical applications
The rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology provides new opportunities for the sustainable progress of analytical science. The introduction of nanomaterials into analytical chemistry implants their novel functions into analytical sensing systems, resulting in many novel analytical techniques being tested and some highly sensitive and selective systems fabricated. This rapidly extending interdisciplinary area has attracted great research efforts from chemists, physicists, biologists and materials scientists. Recently, GN-based analytical systems are a very active area. In this section, we will present some recent trends on GN-based analytical applications with an emphasis on electrochemical and fluorescent sensor.
7.1 
          Graphene-based electrochemical sensors
Nanoelectroanalytical chemistry is a rising interdisciplinary field, which combines characteristics of electrochemistry (e.g., simplicity, speed, high selectivity and high sensitivity) with unique properties of nanomaterials (e.g., electronic, optical, magnetic and catalytic) to become one of the most exciting topics.250GN not only could act as an advanced support with very large surface area for immobilizing different targets, but also effectively promote the electron transfer between electrode and analytes. For example, recently, fundamental electrochemistry studies of GN and N-doped GN123,251–253 have given direct evidence that they exhibit a very high electrochemical response for different probe molecules such as Fe(CN)63−/4−, Ru(NH3)62+/3+ and Fe2+/3+, etc. Particularly, in some cases, GN-based electrodes have shown superior performance in terms of electrocatalytic activity and macroscopic scale conductivity than CNTs-based ones.254,255 For instance, Liet al.255 compared the electrochemical properties and sensitivity of reduced GO sheets with SWNTs. It is found that for two probe biomolecules (dopamine and serotonin), GN modified electrode showed greater currents at lower potentials, as well as higher electrode stability, than SWNTs modified electrodes. However, whether graphene could provide more advantages for electrochemical sensor applications is still a difficult question to answer because there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the relative performance of CNTs and graphene in biosensing, and certainly none in completely optimized systems. However, the better physical and chemical properties of GNs than CNTs suggests that graphene might have some advantages over CNTs for certain types of sensors, and thus could be used as an enhanced platform for constructing high-sensitivity electrochemical sensors.14
The direct electron transfer (DET) from redox-protein to the electrode surface is a very important subject in bioelectrochemistry, which might help us understand the mechanism of many bioelectrochemical reactions and construct biochemical sensors.256 A number of groups have employed GN or GN/metal NPs or GN/DNA hybrids as enhanced materials for completing the direct electrochemistry of redox proteins such as GOD,16,123,257–263hemoglobin,264microperoxidase-11,265cytochrome C,266 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP),267 and constructing high-sensitivity electrochemical biosensors. For instance, Lin et al.262 reported a GN–chitosan nanocomposite film, which provided a favorable microenvironment for GOD and promoted its direct electron transfer at the electrode surface. Furthermore, GN-based hybrids with another component being IL258,259 and metal NPs257,260,261,263 have also been used to complete the DET of GOD and meantime construct a higher sensitivity glucose sensor. Besides, GN/DNA hybrids have also shown good potential for the immobilization of HRP and completing its DET. Particularly, the as-prepared GN/DNA/HRP modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic performance towards H2O2 with high sensitivity, wide linear range, and good stability.
Immunosensors are important analytical tools based on the detection of the binding event between antibody and antigen. Among types of immunosensors, electrochemical immunosensors are attractive tools and have received considerable attention because they are readily prepared and are economical for mass production, they are robust, and they achieve excellent detection limits with small analyte volumes. GN has initially been used as an advanced carrier to construct high-sensitivity immunosensors.268,269–272 An interesting example is that Lin et al.268 reported an electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive detection of the cancer biomarker α-fetoprotein (AFP) based on a dual amplification mechanism resulting from multienzyme-antibody functionalized carbon nanospheres (CNs) and functionalized GNs as the sensor platform. They found that their developed immunosensor showed a 7-fold increase in detection signal compared to the immunosensor without GN modification and CNs labeling. The present immunosensor could respond to 0.02 ng mL−1 AFP with a linear calibration range from 0.05 to 6 ng mL−1. Recently, Gong et al.272 demonstrated that GNs could also be used to immobilize mediator thionine (TH), HRP and secondary anti-prostate specific antigen (PSA) antibody (Ab2) and the resulting nanoarchitecture (GN-TH-HRP-Ab2) was employed as the label for the immunosensor of PSA, which was sandwiched by GN-TH-HRP-Ab2 and primary anti-PSA antibody (Ab1)/GNs. It is interestingly found that the as-prepared immunosensor exhibited a wide range of linear response (0.002 to 10 ng mL−1), low detection limit (1 pg mL−1), good reproducibility, selectivity and stability.
Interest in GN electroanalytical chemistry has increased rapidly to detect some important biomolecules273–281 and small molecules.282,283 Our group273 employed chemically reduced GN as enhancing materials for the preparation of an advanced electrochemical sensing and biosensing platform. Fig. 20A–C shows the differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) at bare GC electrode (A), graphite/GC electrode (B) and GN G/C electrode (C) for G (blue), A (orange), T (violet), and C (magenta) at pH 7.0, respectively. It is observed that anodic potentials of the four free bases on GN G/C electrode move negatively with enhanced peak currents compared with GC and graphite/GC electrodes. Particularly, as shown in Fig. 20D–F, the GN G/C electrode could simultaneously detect four free bases (Fig. 20D) or even four bases in ssDNA (Fig. 20E) and dsDNA (Fig. 20F). Furthermore, other different kinds of important inorganic and organic electroactive compounds (i.e., probe molecule (potassium ferricyanide), oxidase/dehydrogenase-related molecules (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)), neurotransmitters (dopamine (DA)), and other biological molecules (ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA) and acetaminophen (APAP)) were also employed to study their electrochemical responses at the GN modified GC electrode, which shows more favorable electron transfer kinetics than graphite-modified graphite/GC and bare GC electrodes. The combination of GNs with inorganic NPs such as Pt or Prussian Blue NPs, leading to the development of multifunctional nanoassembly architectures, may open a new avenue for utilizing GN-based hybrid nanomaterials as enhanced elements for constructing electrochemical sensing platforms with high performance.274,275 Recently, our group274 reported a one-step, microwave-assisted route for rapidly synthesizing Pt NP ensemble-on-graphene hybrid nanosheets (PNEGHNs) with controllable Pt NPs densities. The electrochemical behavior of different kinds of important electroactive compounds (e.g., probe molecule (potassium ferricyanide), hydrogen peroxide, neurotransmitters (DA), acetaminophen (APAP) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) on PNEGHNs/GCE and GNs/GCE revealed that PNEGHNs/GCE shows more favorable electron transfer kinetics and much enhanced electrochemical activities relative to GNs/GCE. Besides, the combination of GNs with functional molecules could also be a good approach to enhance electrochemical detection of different target molecules.49,276,277 For instance, our group49 designed the synthesis of cyclodextrin (CD)–GNs organic–inorganic hybrid nanosheets with high supramolecular recognition capability (Fig. 21A). Especially, the electrochemical results on CD–GNs hybrid nanosheets revealed that they could exhibit very high supramolecular enrichment capability and showed much higher electrochemical performance toward eight probe molecules (biomolecules and drugs) than unmodified GNs and CNTs (Fig. 21B–I).

Environmental issues have become one of the most important research topics around the world because they play a vital role on human activities and health. Besides GNs-based materials could be used as effective enhancing materials for photocatalytic degradation of dyes284 and toxic arsenic removal,285 they have been also developed for environmentally electrochemical analysis of some toxic (Pb2+, Cd2+ and hydrazine) and explosive substances (TNT), etc.286–290 For instance, Wang's group demonstrated that Nafion-GN composite film/GC electrode not only exhibited improved sensitivity for metal ion (Pb2+ and Cd2+) detection, but also alleviated the interferences due to the synergistic effect of GNs and Nafion.287 In addition, electrophoretic deposited graphene film289 and graphene-IL mixed nanocomposite film290 have exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards the detection of TNT with high sensitivity.

          GN-based materials have been used to detect different gas molecules,291–294DNA,295,296 single-bacterium,295 pH,297glucose,298glutamate298 and protein299 with high sensitivity (even single molecule detection in some cases) based on different signal conversion strategies such as field effect transistors (FETs), etc. For instance, Novoselov et al.291 for the first time demonstrated the use of mechanically exfoliated GN for the detection of NO2 with single molecule detection in a high vacuum chamber. The operational principle of their GN devices was just based on changes in the electrical conductivity when NO2 was adsorbed on the surface of GN, which led to a decrease in resistance due to the p-type doping. Liet al.296 fabricated a large-sized GN field effect transistor to detect DNA with a detection sensitivity of 0.01 nM and even the ability to distinguish a single-base mismatch. Their detection mechanism was ascribed to the electronic-doping introduced by target DNAs, which were linked to the probe-DNAs pre-immobilized on GN. Furthermore, they found that decoration of Au NPs on GN could extend the upper limit of detection from 10 to 500 nM. Although the above analytical methods could enable the high-sensitivity detection of target molecules, most of them just determined the presence of target molecules amd it is more difficult to obtain a wide detection range. More recently, Chen et al.299 firstly reported on the fabrication of a highly sensitive and selective FET biosensor using thermally reduced GO sheets decorated with gold NP–antibody conjugates for the detection of protein. A schematic of the GN/gold NPs FET device and the sensor fabrication process are shown in Fig. 22a and Fig. 22b, respectively. In this sensing strategy, the Au NP-antibody conjugates were assembled onto the surface of GNs through noncovalent attachment, followed by the addition of a blocking buffer in order to prevent possible nonspecific binding events. In the presence of target proteins, the protein binding events induced significant changes in the electrical characteristics of the device, which could be studied by FET and direct current measurements. This novel biosensor without any protein engineering exhibited a high detection limit of (∼13 pM), whose performance (without optimization) is among the best of carbon nanomaterial-based FET protein sensors.

          Graphene-based fluorescent sensors

Fluorescent probes such as dyes, QDs and metal nanoclusters,300 often used in the homogeneous detection of target molecules through a fluorescent change, has motivated intense interest due to their operation convenience, rapid binding kinetics and high robustness. Graphene, as a super-quencher with a long-range nanoscale energy transfer property, can strongly quench the fluorescence of dyes and QDs when they are close to each other. Therefore, coupling GN with fluorescent probe-labeled biomolecules having high biomolecular recognition events represents a new direction in nanobiotechnology toward the development of novel sensors with powerful functions. Chen et al.301 for the first time employed water-soluble GO (actually graphene can also be used) as a platform for the sensitive and selective detection of DNA and proteins based on a signal-on fluorescent strategy. Fig. 23 shows a typical schematic representation of this new detection platform. In the first step, FAM (a fluorescein-based fluorescent dye)-labeled ssDNA was bound onto GO due to the noncovalent interaction between GO and nucleobases from DNA. Under such circumstances GO could completely quench the fluorescence of FAM. In the second step, in the presence of a target, the binding interaction between the FAM-labeled DNA and target molecule was large enough to release the FAM-labeled DNA from GO, resulting in restoration of FAM fluorescence. This fluorescence-enhanced detection was unique in terms of sensitivity and selectivity to the target molecule. Later, several groups further developed this “signal-on” technique to detect other targets through new different DNA designs. These typical targets include thrombin,301,302DNA,303,304Hg2+,303Ag+,305 single-base mismatch,305adenosine triphosphate,306etc. More recently, Juet al.307 designed a novel platform for effective sensing of different biomolecules such as DNA and thrombin, etc. based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from QDs to GO through employing an inexpensive molecular beacon (MB)-functionalized QD instead of dye-labeled MB. Furthermore, Seo's group308 reported the direct use of GO sheets as a novel fluorescent label to recognize specific DNA–DNA hybridization interaction in an array format. In their strategy, the probe DNA was first covalently linked to the surface of GO, and then hybridized with a gold NP labeled complementary DNA strand. Au NPs on the surface of GO could drastically reduce the fluorescence emission intensity of the GO array, thus forming a “signal-off” fluorescent sensor. Another interesting GN-based fluorescent sensor was demonstrated by Loh et al.,309 who reported that GO–dye complex (quenched fluorescence) could be used for optical sensing of DNA through forming unique electrostatic and noncovalent interactions between the analyte (DNA) and dye (“turn on” of the quenched fluorescence).

7.3 Other graphene-based sensors
Throughout current chemical sensor design, one can readily see the great impact of new nanomaterials. Actually, the study on GN-based sensors have also been explored in other sensing strategies.310,311 One innovative finding was given by Qu's group,310 which developed a colorimetric method for the detection of glucose using GO-COOH peroxidase-like catalytic activity, peroxidase substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and GOD. They found that the present colorimetric method was simple, cheap and highly sensitive and selective for glucose detection and has successfully been used to detect glucose in buffer solution and diluted blood or fruit juice samples. Besides, Loh et al.311 reported the ultrahigh efficiency extraction and analysis of DNA oligomers (ssDNA) using GNs as a combined extraction and analysis platform for surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Their studies showed that the lowest detection limit for ssDNA using this method was 100 fM, which was one to three orders of magnitude lower than that for the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method using a polymeric or nanodiamond platform.312,313 Despite the above achievements, it is still necessary to design new GN-based sensing concepts for the detection of different desirable targets in the near future.
8. Conclusion, challenges and perspective
In summary, the important advance on research on GN in the last several years has been reviewed. These exciting research contributions include how to find effective strategies for the preparation of high-quality GN at a large scale, molecular engineering of GN for energy band engineering and possible tunable new properties, advanced assembling techniques for GN-based 2D or 3D functional thin films or architectures, constructing GN-based nanohybrids with enhanced functions, and exploring GN-based advanced energy and analytical devices with high performance. These exciting research results reveal that GN can open many unique opportunities in an extremely multidisciplinary environment to study the phenomena, properties and applications never observed before, though there are many new aspects yet to be investigated. At present, one of the major challenges for the deeper development of GN has been lack of a scalable production method for synthesizing high-quality GN with controllable layer thickness. It is still extremely difficult to produce single layer GN at large scale. Furthermore, obtaining high-yield samples of GN with reproducibly two, three or more layers on a large scale is also very important for understanding the effects of layer numbers on properties and performance and even revealing new properties and functions; unfortunately, there are as yet no effective methods available. Another important issue is the size and shape of GN prepared are generally heterogeneous though unzipping CNTs can partly control the size and shape of GN on a small scale and low yield (the reported highest yield is about 60%), so separation methods for size or morphology-specific fractions have to be developed to narrow the size distribution of GN and improve the yield, which is important for high-performance electronic applications. More notably, all methods for GN production presented above are inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to develop a low-cost, high-throughput, environmentally friendly strategy for the preparation of GN with desirable fine structure, such as size, shape and even type and location of defects. Considering this ambitious goal, the better understanding of GN growth mechanisms may provide some new ways and opportunities. So, it is of great importance to develop in situ experimental techniques for characterizing GN and studying its formation mechanism based on different synthetic methods.
It would be of great interest to explore new properties of GN supposing that one can accurately control the fine structure of GN through different synthetic strategies or molecular engineering. Many properties of GN such as magnetic, optical, electronic and hydrogen adsorption, etc. are not fully understood, in particular magnetic properties. Two major challenges in many nanotechnology applications are the development of large-scale assembly approaches for manufacturing complex and desirable nanostructured architectures, and a precise process for large area, continuous single-layer GN film, which can be easily transferred onto the desirable substrates. Large-scale transformation of GNs to nanotubes314 would also be interesting to examine whether the carbon nanotubes obtained from GNs have new properties and functions different from other counterparts.
The incorporation of GN into nanocomposites is an efficient avenue for broadening and enhancing the function and performance of other functional nanomaterials. However, efficient methods for these GN-based hybrids are very limited because GN is very easily aggregated due to complex interactions between GN with other molecules. Particularly, an extremely difficult project is how to control the morphology and size of other functional nanomaterials on the surface of GN. The development of corresponding hybrids with well-defined morphologies is very important for enhancing their performance in energy and analytical applications. So, there is much scope, but a great challenge for materials chemists to develop novel strategies for synthesizing desirable GN-based hybrid architectures. Another interesting aspect is that for analytical chemistry, new GN-based analytical techniques need be developed to detect different targets based on different practical requirements. GN may also find applications on microchip systems to develop GN-based lab-on-a-chip devices for separation of macromolecules and cells, DNA and protein sequencing, gene expression analysis and studies of a range of intermolecular interactions, and the assay of diverse bio-targets.
Besides experimental studies, there needs a great deal of work on theoretical investigations of various aspects of GN, including electronic structure, doping effects and dependence of properties on the number of layers. A good theory may help with understanding and predicting new properties associated with GN.315 Rational design that combines theoretical modeling with advanced experimental techniques will significantly shorten the cycle of GN researches. Finally, despite the fact that scientific results show superb advantages of GNs for different application potentials, there is still a long way to go for possible exploitation of GN-based commercial products. The cost of GN-based materials prepared through different strategies is still much higher than for conventional materials. So, at present, the most essential technological challenge that graphene faces, is the hurdle of controlled production of large GNs with desirable size, shape, composition and doping in a very low-cost manner. This would be the first step towards commercially available graphene-based application devices.
