    , Accepted 22nd June 2015First published on 22nd June 2015AbstractTwo small molecular chromogenic sensors (azine MS-1 and azomethine MS-2) were synthesized for acid–base discoloration and optoelectronic investigations. It was found that the color of both sensors in solution and in the solid state changed obviously from yellow to purple and blue after treatment with acid, which could be easily detected by the naked eye. Furthermore, single-crystal conductance of MS-1 and MS-2 could be significantly enhanced after treatment with HCl gas flow. On the other hand, MS-2 showed relatively good film-forming ability and could be used as a hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.68%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of perovskite solar cells including a HTM based on a low-cost Schiff-base.
Introduction
In recent years, π-conjugated organic semiconducting compounds with well-defined structures have drawn attention as materials for a variety of electronic and optoelectronic devices such as organic and polymeric light emitting diodes,1 field effect transistors,2 and photovoltaic cells.3 Among the π-conjugated compounds, azines having N–N linked diimines (R–CHN–NCH–R) and azomethines bearing imine linkages (–CHN–) are found to be good candidates for multifunctional materials.4 Interestingly, their electron distribution can be tuned by protonation with Lewis acids and complexation with Bronsted acids. The optical properties of a molecule are strongly dependent on its electron distribution. Thus, Schiff bases containing azine or azomethine units can be used for reversible acid–base discoloration investigation.5 In most of the common designs, pH probes rely on weakly acidic dyes whose dissociated and undissociated forms have different absorption or emission maxima.6 However, acid–base discoloration based on Schiff bases has been less reported.5,7 On the other hand, azomethines exhibit high chemical, oxidative, and reductive resistance and interesting photophysical properties.8 They are also possible alternatives to butadiene linkages which could be used as cost-effective hole transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells.9
In our previous work, some azo dyes have been studied on the azo-hydrazone tautomerism, which is evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy using pH-titration.10 Furthermore, a series of thiazole-based and oligothiophene-based heterocyclic aromatic compounds with terminal thienyl, pyridyl and triphenylamino groups have been described.11 The current work is the combination of our efforts in the study of organic materials for possible applications in acid–base discoloration and organic optoelectronics, where two compounds bearing double 4-[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]phenyl terminals (azine MS-1 and azomethine MS-2 as shown in Scheme 1) have been prepared. It is found that their UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission change observably upon adding trifluoroacetic acid (p[TFA] = −logc[TFA]). It is also noted that the single-crystal conductance of MS-1 can be significantly improved from 1.64 × 10−5 S m−1 to 1.58 × 10−4 S m−1 after being treated with hydrogen chloride gas. Furthermore, the introduction of electron-donating 4-[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]phenyl groups could effectively increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of MS-2, which makes it a good candidate as a HTM for perovskite solar cells.

Results and discussion
Single-crystal structures and thermal stability
Single-crystal structures of both azine MS-1 and azomethine MS-2 were successfully obtained to fully characterize their molecular geometry. As depicted in Fig. 1, MS-1 has good molecular planarity with zero dihedral angle between two phenyl rings on each side of the azine unit because the central azine unit lies on an inversion centre. In contrast, there are two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit cell of MS-2, and the dihedral angles between two phenyl rings on each side of the azomethine unit are different at 5.9(7) and 45.3(4)°.

Thermal durability of small molecules is one of the most essential parameters for the organic optoelectronic applicability.12 In this work, compounds MS-1 and MS-2 have been checked by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, and the parameter Td10 (10% weight-loss temperature) is used to describe the thermal stability of these compounds. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), they exhibit similar TGA curves where their Td10 values are found to be 320 °C indicative of relatively high thermal stability of MS-1 and MS-2.
pH-dependent optical properties
UV-vis spectra of MS-1 and MS-2 were recorded in dichloromethane solutions with the same concentration of 1.0 × 10−5 M. Acid–base discoloration experiments were carried out by adding different amounts of TFA to their dichloromethane solutions at room temperature. Both dyes in dichloromethane solution show similar spectral behavior (black curves in Fig. 2a and b). There are three absorption peaks centered at 290, 372 and 417 nm (ε = 2.91, 3.46 and 2.77 × 104 M−1 cm−1) in MS-1, and at 299, 356 and 410 nm (ε = 3.00, 3.47 and 2.59 × 104 M−1 cm−1) in MS-2.

However, a new absorption peak centered at 520 nm is observed for MS-1 upon adding TFA, accompanying the decrease of absorption of the above-mentioned three peaks to different extents. Furthermore, the strength of this new peak at 520 nm increases with the amount of added TFA, and even overwhelms all the other three original absorption peaks when the concentration of TFA equals 0.1 M (ε = 3.14 × 104 M−1 cm−1). At the same time, the color of the solution changes remarkably from yellow to purple, which can be easily detected by the naked eye. With regard to MS-2, a new absorption peak can also be found at around 520–550 nm with weaker absorption strength. Different from MS-1 with only one isoabsorptive point at 450 nm, two isoabsorptive points are observed at 450 and 571 nm for MS-2, and they can be shifted to each other with the alteration of p[TFA] values. That is to say, the isoabsorptive point at 450 nm in MS-2 corresponds to p[TFA] > 3, while it red-shifted to 571 nm when the p[TFA] values are less than 3. Accompanied by the shift of the isoabsorptive point, the color of solution changes from yellow to purple and blue accordingly, exhibiting visualized acid–base discoloration behavior. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), the linear range of detection of MS-1 for TFA was determined to be 2.0 × 10−3 to 0.1 M with the detection limit of 5.0 × 10−4 M. With regard to MS-2, the linear range of detection for TFA was determined to be 1.0 × 10−7 to 1.0 × 10−3 M, indicating that MS-2 is more sensitive to acid than MS-1.
Considering the presence of one and two isoabsorptive points for azine MS-1 and azomethine MS-2 in their acid–base discoloration experiments as well as their molecular structures, equilibrium suppositions are given for each of them. We suggest that the visualized acid–base discoloration originated from a one-step or two-step protonation process of Schiff base units in the molecular structures of MS-1 and MS-2. It is known that Schiff bases contain available active centers for proton attacks and their electron distribution can be tuned by protonation. Accordingly, the n–π* and π–π* transitions within the molecules can be greatly influenced by the addition of TFA in this work. As illustrated in Scheme 2, three quinone structures MS-12+, MS-2+ and MS-22+ are suggested to be formed upon adding different amounts of TFA and they are in equilibrium with MS-1 and MS-2, and the two isoabsorptive points observed in the UV-vis spectra of MS-2 could be assigned to two phases (I ↔ II and II ↔ III).
 Scheme 2  Equilibrium suppositions between MS-1, MS-2 and their protonated quinone structures MS-12+, MS-2+, and MS-22+. 
In the ESI-MS spectra, MS-1 and MS-2 have the molecular ion peaks at m/z = 663 and 636 in 100% abundance, and the molecular ion peaks remain unchanged after adding excess TFA, indicating that they are stable in acidic solution. To further reveal the equilibrium supposition, comparative 1H NMR spectra of MS-1, MS-2 and their TFA adducts have been recorded, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). As to MS-1, it is found that the single peak assigned to two protons of the CHN units shifted to a higher field from 8.537 to 8.376 ppm after the addition of TFA. In addition, half of four benzene protons between the azine unit and nitrogen atoms of the terminals, which are close to the latter, are shifted to a higher field from 6.898 and 6.880 ppm to 6.850 and 6.833 ppm. In contrast, all the other four groups of protons of MS-1 are found to move to a lower field to different extents. It is worth mentioning that the change in the chemical shifts for the imine protons is the largest one for both MS-1 and MS-2 before and after the addition of TFA. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum exhibits a strong emission peak at 520 nm in the case of MS-1. This peak is red-shifted by 25 nm in comparison with a similar compound (AZ-5) reported by Ewa Schab-Balcerzak et al.7 in the absence of electron-donating methoxyl groups. It is also found that a significant fluorescence reduction is observed after the addition of TFA to the MS-1 solution (Fig. S5, ESI†), while MS-2 is found to be fluorescence inactive, by contrast.

Single-crystal conductance
Moreover, an alteration of the solid-state conductance of MS-1 before and after treatment with HCl gas flow has been made, where two ends of single-crystal samples of MS-1 and its hydrochloride adduct were covered by a pair of electrodes made of conductive silver paste. Each I–V curve was recorded between the pair of electrodes, respectively, by means of a four-probe system under the same experimental conditions. As displayed in Fig. 4, the average conductance obtained from linear fitting of the I–V curves reveal about ten times enhancement after being treated with hydrogen chloride gas, namely varying from 1.64 × 10−5 to 1.58 × 10−4 S m−1. It is easy to see that the change in solid UV-vis spectra after treatment with hydrogen chloride gas was almost the same with the experiment of acid–base discoloration in dichloromethane solution. According to the experimental results, the enhancement of conductance may be due to the formation of the MS-12+ ion in the solid state, because the hydrochloride adduct of MS-1 is a protonated species and it has better electron transmission ability than MS-1. As to MS-2, the conductance also exhibits significant enhancement from 8.96 × 10−6 to 8.06 × 10−5 S m−1 after treating with TFA (Fig. S6, ESI†). The result reveals that the variation of single-crystal conductance caused by acidification is a general character of this class of Schiff base compounds.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
To further reveal the characteristics of π-conjugated dyes, the optimized molecular structures of MS-1, MS-12+, MS-2, MS-2+ and MS-22+, together with the frontier molecular orbitals of their calculated HOMOs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), are shown in Fig. 5. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package,13 employing the DFT method with Becke's three parameter hybrid function and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient corrected correlation function (B3LYP). The fixed atom coordinates of MS-1 and MS-2, originating from the structural parameters determined by the X-ray diffraction method, were used as the input files for ground state optimization. DFT calculations manifest that the HOMOs of MS-1 and MS-12+ are located on the whole molecule skeleton, while LUMOs are located on the central azine units. Similarly, the LUMOs of MS-2, MS-2+ and MS-22+ are located on the central azomethine units. This is the same as the case of Spiro-OMeTAD, where the LUMO localizes on the central spiro-group.14 Nevertheless, the HOMO of MS-22+ is mainly located on the 4-[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]phenyl terminal away from the protonated side, which is found to shift towards the other side of the divalent cation compared with those in MS-2 and MS-2+. It is known that the introduction of electron-donating 4-[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]phenyl groups into our molecules could effectively increase the HOMO levels. Actually, the calculated hole reorganization energies (λhole) of these Schiff-base materials (170 meV for MS-1 and 203 meV for MS-2) are close to the typical HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (148 meV),15 showing potential of MS-1 and MS-2 as hole-transporting materials in perovskite-based solar cells.

Moreover, UV-vis spectra of MS-1, MS-12+, MS-2, MS-2+ and MS-22+ were calculated by using the TD-DFT method according to the above-mentioned optimized geometries (Fig. S7, ESI†). In comparison with MS-1, a new band at 800 nm is produced in MS-12+, accompanying the decrease of absorption for the other peaks between 200 and 600 nm. Analogously, a new absorption band can also be found at around 700 nm in MS-2+ compared with that in MS-2. In addition, as to the divalent cation MS-22+, the band at around 700 nm is weaker than that in MS-2+. In contrast, the band at around 400–500 nm in MS-22+ is much stronger than that in MS-2+. It can be concluded that the calculated UV-vis spectra of MS-1, MS-12+, MS-2, MS-2+ and MS-22+ are in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the equilibrium suppositions in Scheme 2 are acceptable.
Optoelectronic properties
Very recently, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, where X corresponds to halogens) have been introduced as light harvesters in low-cost solar cells.16 Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 15% have been reported when using CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the light absorber and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTM.17 Nevertheless, Spiro-OMeTAD is expensive because of its tedious synthetic methodology even if it is found to be the most effective small-molecule HTM for perovskite solar cells. Lots of efforts have been made to develop a cheaper alternative to replace Spiro-OMeTAD, such as pyrene arylamine derivatives18 and butadiene derivatives.9,19 However, effective perovskite solar cells based on Schiff-base HTMs have never been reported.
As depicted in Fig. 6, the electrochemical behavior of MS-1, MS-2 and Spiro-OMeTAD was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in CH2Cl2 solution (1.0 × 10−3 M) containing 0.1 M TBAClO4 as the supporting electrolyte. All potentials reported herein were calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard reference. Oxidation onset potentials (Eonsetox) as well as HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by the DPV and UV-vis absorption data. The onset oxidation was evaluated relative to the Fc/Fc+ couple, where an energy level of −5.10 eV versus vacuum was assumed.20 As shown in Fig. 7, the HOMO levels of MS-1 and MS-2 were estimated to be −5.38 and −5.24 from DPV measurements, respectively. Compared with AZ-5,7 the introduction of four electron-donating methoxyl groups could effectively decrease the initial oxidation potential of the compound MS-1 from 0.55 to 0.28 V. The reported HOMO energy level for CH3NH3PbI3 was −5.44 eV,18 which indicated that both the compounds have energetics favorable for the hole transfer. So the HOMO energy of MS-2 is more similar to that of Spiro-OMeTAD and it is used for perovskite solar cell fabrication. In contrast, MS-1 displays very poor film-forming ability, and it is difficult for us to get reliable and reproducible devices.

 Fig. 7  Energy level diagram of the materials used in perovskite solar cells. 
The MS-2 based device gave Jsc = 13.46 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 V and FF = 0.56, affording power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 6.68%, as can be seen in Table 1. The blank experiments using Spiro-OMeTAD gave Jsc = 18.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V and FF = 0.68, corresponding to the PCE of 10.51%. The photocurrent action spectra of the two devices are presented in Fig. 8a. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 8b. As depicted in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the device fabricated with Spiro-OMeTAD presented an obviously longer lifetime compared to that fabricated with MS-2. The result was consistent with the observed shift in the Voc value under standard global AM1.5 illumination. On the other hand, the low FF value of the device based on MS-2 can partly be explained by the high series resistance (Rs) compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, the hole mobility determined by using the space charge limited current method21 gave a value of 8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MS-2 (Fig. S9, ESI†). The lower hole mobility of MS-2 relative to Spiro-OMeTAD (2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1)21 is also responsible for the decrease of the fill factor and the PCE of the perovskite solar cell. Although the measured PCE based on MS-2 is lower than the device based on Spiro-OMeTAD, it is still valuable to the research on solar cells taking its relative ease of synthesis into account.

Experimental
Materials and measurements
All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. 4-[Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]benzaldehyde and 4-amino-4′,4′′-dimethoxytriphenylamine were prepared according to the literature methods.22,23 Elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer using a quartz glass cell with a path length of 10 mm. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AM-500 NMR spectrometer, using TMS (SiMe4) as an internal reference at room temperature. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded using a ThermoFisher Scientific LCQ Fleet mass spectrometer in the scan range of 100–2000 amu. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was undertaken using a SEIKO EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 6200 unit under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic and differential-pulse voltammetry were performed using a CHI660D instrument, using a Pt disk as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode with a porous ceramic wick, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, standardized for the redox couple of ferricinium/ferrocene. Photovoltaic measurements were recorded using a Newport Oriel solar simulator (Model 91160) equipped with a Class A xenon light source powered by a Newport power supply. The power output of the lamp was measured to be 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) using a certified Si reference cell. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of every cell were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400). IPCE measurements were performed on a Newport QE measurement system (Model 70104).

Solar cell fabrication. 
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was etched with zinc powder and diluted HCl solution, the etched substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication using decon-soap solution, deionized water and ethanol, followed by O3/UV treatment. The compact TiO2 underlayer (30 nm) was deposited by aerosol spray pyrolysis on the FTO surface at 500 °C using 6 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol) diluted in ethanol (1:39, v/v) and oxygen as a carrier gas, and sintered on a hot plate for 1 h at 500 °C. Porous TiO2 films of 200 nm thickness were deposited onto compact layer covered substrates by spin coating at 5000 r.p.m. for 30 s using a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NRD, 30 nm average particle size) diluted in anhydrous ethanol (1:3, weight ratio). After drying at 120 °C, the TiO2 layers were heated to 470 °C for 15 min. The prepared mesoporous TiO2 films were infiltrated with a solution of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (508 mg/1 mL) by spin coating at 8000 r.p.m. for 90 s and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting TiO2/PbI2 composite film was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 30 s. The resulting perovskite film was washed with dry 2-propanol and under a N2 flow, dried at 70 °C for 30 min. The HTMs were coated via a solution process by the following procedure. Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (180 mg/1 mL) and MS-2/chlorobenzene (72 mg/1 mL) solutions with additives containing 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg/1 mL) and 28.8 μL of TBP were spin-coated on a CH3NH3PbI3/mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, 65 nm of gold was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber on top of the device to form the electrode contacts. The device fabrication was carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and at a humidity of <1.0 ppm.

Single-crystal samples of MS-1 and MS-2 were covered in glue and mounted on glass fibers for data collection on a Bruker SMART 1K CCD area detector at 123(2) K, using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The collected data were reduced by using the program SAINT24 and empirical absorption corrections were done using the program SADABS.25 The crystal systems were determined by Laue symmetry and the space groups were assigned on the basis of systematic absences by using XPREP. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by the least-squares method. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined on F2 by a full-matrix least-squares procedure using anisotropic displacement parameters. All the hydrogen atoms were inserted in the calculated positions with assigned fixed isotropic thermal parameters at 1.2 times of the equivalent isotropic U of the atoms to which they are attached (1.5 times for the methyl groups) and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms. All calculations were carried out using the SHELXTL PC program package.26
Conclusions
In summary, protonation-triggered visualized acid–base discoloration studies have been described for azine MS-1 and azomethine MS-2. According to the experimental evidence and the related analyses by UV-vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy, we come to a conclusion that the protonation/deprotonation equilibria of MS-1 and MS-2 may lead to the acid–base discoloration. Single-crystal structures of MS-1 and MS-2 are included and single-crystal conductance of MS-1 and MS-2 could be significantly enhanced (∼10 times) after being treated with a flow of HCl gas. On the other hand, MS-2 can be used as a HTM in perovskite solar cells exhibiting a PCE of 6.68%. As far as we are aware, this is the first report that a low-cost Schiff base is used as a HTM in perovskite solar cells.
