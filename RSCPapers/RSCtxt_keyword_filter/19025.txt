    , Accepted 19th September 2016First published on 19th September 2016AbstractOrganic electronic materials are a hot topic of both academic and industrial studies because of their wide range of applications in various fields, e.g. displays, lighting and solar cells. In the development process of electronic materials, quinacridone (QA) and its derivatives have attracted increasing attention due to their intriguing properties, such as intense fluorescence in the dispersed state, strong absorption in the visible-light region, good carrier-transporting properties, as well as high photo, thermal and electrochemical stability.

1. Introduction
Organic electronic materials have attracted much attention because of their wide range of applications in displays, lighting, solar cells, field-effect transistors and sensors.1 Among various known electronic materials, a few π-conjugated industrial pigments/dyes that possess a rigid and flat skeleton, such as diketopyrrolopyrroles,2 isoindigos,3 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid diimides4 and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimides5 (Scheme 1), are of special interest because the high rigidity and planarity of their core structures give rise to a set of intriguing properties, e.g. efficient luminescence, high carrier mobility and strong absorption.
 Scheme 1  Core structures of a few typical organic pigments/dyes used in organic electronics. 
Quinacridone (QA, Scheme 1), which has been known since 19356 and industrially produced since 1958,7 is a high-performance pigment because of its exceptional colour and weather fastness and is widely used in industrial paints, artist's paints and printing inks.8 During the past three decades, the applications of QA and its derivatives in electronic devices have also been explored. To facilitate these applications, the electronic structures of QAs have also been studied, e.g. the electronic structure of β-phase QA featuring both the delocalized π-type and localized σ-type occupied molecular orbitals has been disclosed by Puschnig and co-workers through experimental and theoretical studies.9 Due to the five-ring-fused core structure, QAs usually exhibit efficient emission in dilute solution. For example, the N,N′-dibutyl-substituted QA shows a high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) of nearly 100%.10 This feature makes QAs potential candidates as emitters in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).11 The strong absorption of QAs in the visible-light region benefits their application in organic solar cells (OSCs).12 The planar core structure makes QAs form strong intermolecular π–π interactions that facilitate efficient carrier transport in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).13 In addition, QAs usually show good photo, thermal and electrochemical stability, which fits the fundamental requirements for applications in these three types of electronic devices. Moreover, the chemical and electronic structures of QAs, as well as their solubility, can be easily tuned through structural modification, so that the device performance can be finely tuned and the applications of QAs in both vacuum-deposited and solution-processed devices can be realized. To date, a number of QA-based electronic materials have been developed and the performance of OLEDs, OSCs and OFETs based on these materials has been gradually enhanced. QAs have become an important class of electronic materials.
To promote the further development of QA-based electronic materials, we herein review the existing knowledge about them, focusing on the synthesis, device performance and structure–performance relationships. We note that the applications of QAs in other fields, such as fluorescent sensors,14 CO2 capture,15 supramolecular assemblies16 and organgels,17 have also attracted enormous attention in recent years. In addition, QA has been very recently employed by Głowacki and co-workers as a photoelectrocatalyst with unique properties.18 However, these topics are not the concern of this review. The review will be arranged as follows: (1) synthesis of QAs, especially the structurally complex QAs; (2) applications of QAs as green-, yellow-, red- and white-emitting materials in OLEDs; (3) applications as donor and acceptor materials in organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); (4) applications as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials in OLEDs and solar cells; (5) applications as active channel materials in OFETs; and (6) conclusion and outlook.
2. Synthesis of QAs
Two representative synthetic routes, A and B, of N,N′-unsubstituted QAs are illustrated in Scheme 2.6b,8,19 For route A, the condensation of diethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedione-2,5-dicarboxylate and arylamine followed by intramolecular cyclization and subsequent oxidation readily provides QAs, while route B starting from 2,5-dibromoterephthalic acid consists of two steps of Ullmann reactions followed by intramolecular cyclization. As these procedures have been well elucidated,6b,8,19 the detailed conditions are not discussed. Compared with route B, route A has the advantages of wider applicability, higher yields and simpler purification, and it is therefore much more popular in both academic studies and industrial productions. The advantage of route B is that it could produce asymmetrically substituted QAs which are difficult to obtain through route A.
 Scheme 2  General synthetic routes of N,N′-unsubstituted QA. 
Because QA is insoluble in organic solvents due to strong intermolecular N–H⋯O hydrogen-bonding interactions between the N–H and CO groups,20 much synthetic effort has been devoted to the improvement of solubility in order to facilitate the application of QAs as functional molecules. Generally, two kinds of strategies have been adopted to achieve the goal. One is to attach long alkyloxy chains to the 2,9- or 2,3,9,10-positions of the QA core through route A (Schemes 1 and 3). For this strategy, intermolecular hydrogen bonds that can serve as a driving force for molecular aggregation/assembly can be retained.21 The other is based on the weakening/elimination of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which can be realized by the introduction of bulk substituents to the 4 and 11 positions of the QA core22 or the N,N′-dialkylation/tert-butoxycarbonylation (Scheme 4).10,23 Because QA is commercially available with a low price and N,N′-dialkylation can be easily achieved by the reaction of alkylhalide and QA under basic conditions with the product being thermally stable, N,N′-dialkylation has become the most widely used method for improving the solubility.10 Although the tert-butoxycarbonylation is also easy to perform by simply reacting QA with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, the product is not thermally stable.23 The tert-butoxycarbonyl group can be removed effectively by thermal cleavage or by the treatment of amine, resulting in the recovery of insoluble QA. However, such a feature of tert-butoxycarbonyl-substituted QA in turn enables the compound to be a so-called “latent” pigment24 that has been successfully used for coloration of plastics and other industrial products.23a

Based on the N,N′-dialkylated QA, lots of QA derivatives have been synthesized. Direct halogenation provides very useful 2,9-dibrominated/diiodide QAs,25,26 which have been successfully applied in Suzuki–Miyaura,12a Stille,13c Heck,27 Ullmann,26 Buchwald–Hartwig28 and Sonogashira29 reactions for constructing small molecules and polymers with expanded π-systems (Scheme 5).

Besides the substitution at the QA core, another strategy for constructing larger π-systems is to expand the core itself by fusing aromatic rings (Scheme 6). Through implementing general synthetic route A to 3-aminocarbazole/2-aminofluorene, indole-/indene-fused QAs with nine rings in the core skeleton have been readily synthesized.30,31 In addition, the ferric chloride-mediated cyclization has been applied to a QA derivative with four arylthienyl substituents on the QA core, and a π-extended QA derivative with a 11-ring-fused skeleton has been succesfully constructed.32

In addition to N–H and C–H bonds, CO bonds of the QA core are other sites for structural modifications (Scheme 7). The carbonyl groups undergo Knoevenagel reaction with malononitrile,33 cyanoacetic acid34 and arylacetonitrile.16d Therefore, multiple nitrile groups can be introduced to the conjugated core for large tuning of electronic structures. The carbonyl groups can also react with arylamines to generate imines35 and react with Lawesson's reagent to realize the O/S exchange.14e

3. Emitting materials for OLEDs
In 1987, the first efficient OLED device was developed by Tang and VanSlyke.36 Since then, OLEDs have attracted much attention due to their promising applications in new-generation flat-panel displays and energy-saving solid lighting sources.37 A typical device configuration of OLEDs is shown in Chart 1. Upon applying a voltage, the electrons are injected from a metal cathode (e.g. Al and Mg) and transported in the electron-transporting layer (ETL), and at the same time, the holes are injected from a transparent anode (e.g. indium tin oxide) and transported in the hole-transporting layer (HTL). The electrons and holes finally recombine in the emitting layer (EML) to form excitons, and the radiative decay of excitons produce electroluminescence (EL). The emitting materials in the EML play a key role in affecting the emitting colours, brightness, EL efficiencies and lifetimes of OLEDs. The primary technical requirement of high-performance emitting materials is that they should be highly emissive. Considering that most of the fluorescent molecules suffer from the trouble of aggregation-caused emission quenching,38 the emitting materials are usually doped in host materials and the resulting doped films are used as EMLs in OLEDs.39 In addition, the high photo, thermal and electrochemical stability of emitting materials are required for improving the device performance.40

3.1 Green-emitting materials
Considering its intense fluorescence in the dispersed state, parent QA (1 in Scheme 8) was firstly used in OLEDs as a green dopant material in 1991.41 However, the device of QA exhibited the drawback of a short lifetime. Several early studies therefore focused on the improvement of device durability. Shi and Tang11a employed N,N′-dimethyl-substituted QA derivative 2 (Scheme 8) as a dopant material and studied its EL properties using the device of [ITO/CuPc/NPB/Alq3:0.8 wt% 2/Alq3/Mg:Al] (CuPc: copper(II)phthalocyanine; NPB: N,N′-di-(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine; Alq3: tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum). The device showed good performance, exhibiting green emission from 2 with the emission maximum (λem) at 544 nm, a maximum current efficiency (CEmax) of 7.31 cd A−1 and a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 1462 cd m−2. More importantly, the half-life (the half-decay time of initial luminance) of the device was as long as 7340 h (initial luminance: 1400 cd m−2), which was impressive as the reference device using 1 as a dopant only showed a half-life of 500 h. The large improvement in durability was attributed to the effectiveness of N,N′-dialkylation in eliminating undesirable dimers or oligomers formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between N–H and CO groups. The improvement in device durability achieved by the suppression of hydrogen bonds was also reported by Wakimoto and co-workers.42 They found that the device of the isopropyl-substituted QA derivative 3 (Scheme 8) with unsubstituted nitrogen atoms exhibited a longer half-life compared with the reference device based on 1. In this case, the N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds were suppressed by the bulky substituents on carbon atoms.

By using the diethyl-substituted QA derivative 4 (Scheme 8) as a dopant material, Murata and co-workers further confirmed that N,N′-dialkylated QAs are good emitters for fabricating long-life devices.43 They fabricated a green-emitting OLED with the structure of [ITO/1-TNATA/NPB/Alq3:4/Alq3/Mg:Al] (1-TNATA: 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino)triphenylamine). The half-life of the device with an initial luminance of about 800 cd m−2 was 3200 h at room temperature, which was about 23 times longer than that of a device with TDP/Alq3 (TPD: N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine) as the organic layer. The higher durability of the device was attributed to the adoption of highly fluorescent and electrochemically stable QA derivatives, the improved hole injection from the anode to the HTL, as well as the high thermal stability of the hole-transporting materials. In addition, the EL efficiency of the device was stable up to 90 °C, without decreasing with increasing temperature. By using a mixture of NPB and Alq3 as the host material and compound 2 as the dopant, Aziz and co-workers44 fabricated an OLED device of [ITO/NPB/49.8% NPB:49.8% Alq3:0.4% 2/Alq3/Mg:Al]. They found that the device showed a long lifetime even at high temperatures. The half-life of the device with an initial luminance of ca. 1700 cd m−2 was as long as 4560 h at 22 °C, 1040 h at 70 °C, and 505 h at 100 °C. From accelerated degradation tests, a half-life of about 78500, 18700, and 8600 h was projected for devices working at 22, 70, and 100 °C, respectively, at an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2. The high durability at high temperatures benefits the practical application of OLEDs.
Simply introducing methyl/ethyl groups to the N-sites of the QA core eliminates intermolecular hydrogen bonds and thus endows 2 and 4 with good EL performance, e.g. long lifetimes, high brightness and high efficiencies. However, similar to other fluorophores with a large planar skeleton, QAs suffer from the trouble of strong aggregation-caused emission quenching.38 As such, they are usually doped in host materials at an extremely low concentration, and the EL efficiencies are very sensitive to the doping concentrations.39 These issues lead to difficulties in device fabrication and in reproducing the device performance. Therefore, a lot of work has been dedicated to the suppression of aggregation-caused emission quenching of QAs to achieve high EL efficiencies even at high doping concentrations.
Wang's group10 synthesized a tetramethyl-substituted QA derivative 6 (Scheme 9). Compound 6 and the reference compound 5 showed similar fluorescence properties in dilute CHCl3 solutions, including strong green emission with the λem at about 535 nm and high ΦF values over 0.90. However, in comparison with 5, compound 6 showed weaker π–π interactions in single crystals and a higher ΦF in concentrated solution, e.g. 0.72 and 0.48 for 6 and 5 in 2 × 10−4 M CHCl3 solutions, respectively. These results indicated the suppressed aggregation of 6 achieved by the four additional methyl groups. The highly efficient OLED devices of [ITO/CuPc/NPB/Alq3:5 or 6/LiF/Al] were fabricated. With a low doping concentration of 0.5 wt%, both 5- and 6-based devices showed green emission with the EL maxima around 540 nm, high brightness with Lmax over 40000 cd m−2 and high efficiencies with CEmax over 20 cd A−1. However, the efficiency of the 5-based device was very sensitive to the doping concentration, being largely decreased from 20.3 cd A−1 to 4.8 cd A−1 upon increasing the doping concentration from 0.5 wt% to 2 wt% (Fig. 1). In sharp contrast, the 6-based device maintained high efficiency (21.5–12.0 cd A−1) in a wide doping-concentration range of 0.5–5 wt% because of the suppressed aggregation. Inspired by the large improvement of EL performance of 6, Wang and co-workers45 subsequently introduced bulkier Schiff-base-boron and carbazole groups to the QA core by linking these groups and the QA core with alkyl tethers (7–10 in Scheme 9). In comparison with corresponding N,N′-dialkylated analogues, 7–10 showed similar fluorescence properties in diluted solutions but higher ΦF in concentrated solutions because of the suppressed aggregation in the concentrated state. However, the authors did not report the EL properties of 7–10.

Besides small molecules, several dendrimers composed of the QA core and benzyl aryl ether dendrons have been studied. McGrath and co-workers46 reported the synthesis and properties of 11–17 (Scheme 10), the 1st–3rd generations of dendrimers. With increased generation, besides the enhanced solubility in organic solvents and the sharply decreased rate of heterogeneous electron transfer in solution, the dendrimers exhibited lower tendency toward aggregation, which resulted in dramatically enhanced fluorescence in the solid state (powder and thin film). Matsui and co-workers47 also reported dendrimers 14–17 at the same time. In addition, they fabricated single-layer solution-processed OLED devices of [ITO/PVK:PBD:dendrimer/Al:Li] (PVK: poly(9-vinylcarbazole); PBD: 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) by using 14–17 as dopants. The devices showed green emission (λem = 522 nm) and moderate efficiencies. Higher-generation dendrimers exhibited stronger fluorescence in the condensed phase because of the suppressed aggregation, but weaker EL intensity under a fixed bias voltage due to a decrease in energy transfer from the host material to the dopant. Wang's group48 introduced the benzyl aryl ether dendrons to the substituted QA core and prepared the 1st and 2nd generations of dendrimers (18–21 in Scheme 10). They also found that the higher-generation dendrimer exhibited stronger fluorescence and a weaker tendency to crystallize.
 Scheme 10  Green-emitting dendrimers 11–21. 
In order to deeply understand the aggregation-caused emission quenching of QAs, Wang's group49 studied two QA cyclophanes, 22 and 23 (Scheme 11), which contain two QA cores linked by polymethene tethers. In comparison with the dialkylated reference compound with a single QA core, which showed strong fluorescence with a high ΦF of 0.99 in dilute CHCl3 solution, the cyclophanes exhibited much lower ΦF of ca. 0.60. The concentration-dependent 1H NMR spectra as well as detailed photophysical studies revealed that the π–π interactions between the two QA cores within a cyclophane were responsible for the fluorescence quenching in dilute solutions. This work clearly indicated that weakening the π–π interactions was critical for suppressing the emission quenching of QAs. With this result in mind, the same group50 reported a series of basket-shaped QA cyclophanes 24–29 (Scheme 11). Compared with the non-bridged analogue 5 showing infinite π–π interactions in single crystals, basket-shaped 28 exhibited intermittent π–π interactions to form molecular dimers, as the bridging tethers forbade further π-stacking (Scheme 12). As a result, all cyclophanes showed much higher ΦF than 5 in concentrated solutions. One of the cyclophanes was compared with 5 to illustrate the effect of suppressed aggregation on EL performance. Upon increasing the doping concentration from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%, the 24-based device had a decrease of 35% in current efficiency, while the analogous device based on 5 showed a large decrease of 75%. The improved luminescence of the cyclophanes in concentrated solutions and the applicability of high doping concentrations in OLEDs suggested that constructing basket-shaped molecules was an effective strategy for suppressing aggregation-caused emission quenching of QAs.

Despite the effectiveness of basket-shaped functionalization, there was still a large room for further suppression of aggregation-caused emission quenching of QAs. Wang's group29 subsequently reported pentaphenylphenyl-substituted QA derivative 31 (Scheme 11). Both 31 and the reference compound 30 (Scheme 11) showed similar fluorescence properties in dilute CH2Cl2 solutions (Fig. 2), exhibiting strong green emissions with λem around 540 nm and high ΦF over 0.98. However, their fluorescence behaviours were quite different from each other in the solid state. Two large propeller-like pentaphenylphenyl groups on 31 successfully eliminated π–π interactions (Scheme 12) and resulted in strong green emission with a good ΦF of 0.36 even in solid films (Fig. 2). This was in sharp contrast to the case of 30, which showed weak orange fluorescence with a low ΦF of 0.06 in solid films because of strong π-stacking. Upon doping 31 into the NPB:Alq3 host at a high concentration of 3 wt%, the green-emitting device [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NPB:Alq3:3 wt% 31/TPBi/LiF/Al] (PEDOT:PSS: poly(2,3-dihydrothieno-1,4-dioxin)–poly(styrenesulfonate); TPBi: 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole)) still showed high performance, i.e. a CEmax of 10.0 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (PEmax) of 7.1 lm W−1 and a Lmax of 23458 cd m−2 at 16.4 V. Even when using 31 as a non-doped emitting layer, the fabricated device [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/31/TPBi/LiF/Al] displayed a Lmax of 496 cd m−2 at 13 V. The enhanced luminescence properties of 31 in the solid state and in highly doped/non-doped devices well demonstrated the effect of the pentaphenylphenyl group on suppressing the emission quenching of QA fluorophores. Moreover, the pentaphenylphenyl group was easily introduced and did not change the electronic structure of the QA core. Therefore, it is very attractive to utilize the pentaphenylphenyl group on other fluorophores with a similar problem of emission quenching.

Besides the suppression of emission quenching, the enhancement of carrier-injection properties and exciton-utilization efficiencies is also very important for improving the EL performance. Wang's group51 reported a QA derivative 32 (Scheme 13) with two electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the QA core. The absorption and fluorescence properties of 32 and its analogous compound (5) without fluorine atoms on the QA core are similar to each other in dilute THF solutions. Both of them exhibited green emission with λem around 525 nm and high ΦF values over 0.90. However, the EL performance of 32 was much better than that of 5 as confirmed by the green-emitting OLED devices [ITO/NPB/Alq3:0.5 wt% 5 or 32/Alq3/LiF/Al] with 5/32 as the dopant material. The practical brightness of 100/1000 cd m−2 was realized at 3.2/4.2 V for the 32-based device and 4.7/7.1 V for the 5-based device. In addition to its better luminance versus driving voltage characteristics, the 32-based device exhibited significantly higher PEmax (15.2 lm W−1 at 598 cd m−2) than the 5-based device (PEmax of 10.7 lm W−1 at 75 cd m−2). The improved EL performance of 32 was attributed to the easier electron-injection to the EML imparted by the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms.
 Scheme 13  Green-emitting materials 32 and 33 for OLEDs. 
According to spin statistics, the ratio of electro-generated singlet and triplet excitons in OLEDs are 25% and 75%, respectively. As normal fluorescent molecules such as QA and Alq3 cannot utilize triplet excitons for producing light, the internal quantum efficiency of a fluorescent OLED is normally limited to 25%, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is limited to 5% by assuming a light-out-coupling efficiency of 20%.52,53 In order to improve the exciton-utilization efficiencies, Wang's group11b used 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN), a compound with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), to serve as the host for QAs. Because the TADF materials can utilize up to 100% of the electro-generated excitons for EL emission,53 higher EL performance can be expected when there is efficient energy transfer between TADF hosts and QA-type dopants. The devices had a configuration of [ITO/NPB/mCP/4CzIPN:0.5 wt% 32 or 33/BCP/BePP2/LiF/Al] (mCP: 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene; BCP: bathocuproine; BePP2: bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium), where 32 or 33 (Scheme 13) was used as the dopant emitter. The efficiencies of the devices using 4CzIPN as the host were much higher than those of the reference devices using Alq3 as the host (Fig. 3). The device based on 32 showed very high performance, with a CEmax of 48.9 cd A−1, a PEmax of 53.4 lm W−1 and a maximum EQE of 13.5%. Moreover, the device exhibited a low efficiency roll-off, maintaining a high EQE of 12.6% at a practical brightness of 1000 cd m−2. The device of 33 exhibited similar performance.

In overall, during the past 25 years, a large number of green-emitting QAs have been designed and synthesized in order to improve the lifetimes of OLEDs, suppress the aggregation-caused emission quenching, and enhance the charge-injection and exciton-utilization efficiencies. QAs have become one class of the most representative green-emitting materials in OLEDs, being able to realize the bright and efficient devices with good durability. Notably, the adoption of a TADF host can significantly enhance the efficiencies of OLEDs based on QAs as indicated by recent studies, which deserve more attention in the future. In addition, further studies on device lifetimes and the exploration of QA-based long-lived devices are of importance for practical applications.
3.2 Yellow- and red-emitting materials
Structurally simple QAs generally show green fluorescence in the dispersed state. In recent years, tuning of the fluorescence colours of QAs from green to deep red has been successfully achieved either by the construction of intramolecular charge-transfer systems or by the extension of π-systems.
Wang's group26 reported the 1st–3rd generation dendrimers 34–39 (Scheme 14) composed of the QA core and carbazole-containing dendrons. In comparison with the green emission of the parent molecule 5 (λem = 535 nm), the emission of the dendrimers red-shifted to the yellow/orange region (λem of 556–580 nm) in dilute CHCl3 solutions because of the extended π-systems. In addition, the aggregation of the QA core was effectively suppressed for high-generation dendrimers. 37–39 exhibited tuneable fluorescence with a λem of 559–609 nm and a ΦF of ca. 0.13 in solid films, as well as high HOMO levels and good film-forming properties. Therefore, they could be used as potential hole-transporting and emitting materials in the solution-processed OLEDs.

In order to get longer-wavelength emission, Wang's group28 recently prepared a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type derivative 40 through introducing strongly electron-donating diphenylamino groups to the QA core (Scheme 15). Because of the intramolecular charge-transfer transition, 40 exhibited red fluorescence with the λem at 602 nm and a good ΦF of 0.56 in toluene. Using 40 as a dopant material, the OLED device [ITO/NPB/Alq3:3 wt% 40/Alq3/LiF/Al] exhibited saturated red emission with the maximum at 628 nm and the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.62, 0.36) (Fig. 4). The red EL emission of 40 was impressive, as the analogous compound 5 without diphenylamino groups on the QA core only exhibited green EL emission with the maximum at 540 nm and a CIE coordinate of (0.32, 0.65) (Fig. 4). The 40-based device showed good performance, with a CEmax of 1.08 cd A−1, a PEmax of 0.85 lm W−1, and a Lmax of 6239 cd m−2 at 12.4 V. It was the first efficient and bright red OLED based on QAs.

Besides introducing electron-donating moieties, Wang's group also tuned the emission colours of QAs by fusing aromatic rings to the QA core. They initially synthesized indole-fused QA derivative 4130a (Scheme 15) with a 9-ring-fused core structure. The compound showed yellow fluorescence with the λem at 568 nm and a high ΦF of 0.91 in dilute toluene solution. With 41 as a dopant material, the OLED device [ITO/NPB/Alq3:1 wt% 41/Alq3/LiF/Al] showed an orange emission with the maximum at 588 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.56, 0.42) (Fig. 4). The device exhibited good performance, showing a CEmax of 5.5 cd A−1, a PEmax of 3.2 lm W−1, and a Lmax of 49830 cd m−2 at 14.0 V. Recently, they also reported32 a QA derivative 42 (Scheme 15) with a 11-ring-fused structure synthesized by fusing four thiophene rings to the QA core. It showed attractive deep red fluorescence with the λem at 641 nm and a high ΦF of 0.55 in dilute CH2Cl2 solution. However, the EL properties of the compound were not reported.
In summary, the studies on tuning the fluorescent colours of QAs are still limited, and only a few molecules showing yellow/orange/red emission have been reported. However, these compounds generally exhibited the attractive feature of intensive emission, and some of them displayed appreciable performance in OLEDs. The realization of excellent yellow/orange/red emitters based on QAs through finetuning of the chemical structures can be expected. In particular, the construction of TADF-type QA derivatives could be an effective strategy for achieving high-performance yellow/orange/red emitters.
3.3 White-emitting materials
The emission spectra of structurally simple N,N′-dialkylated QAs usually exhibit vibrational structures, with strong emission in the green region and weaker emission in the yellow region. For example, the emission spectrum of dibutyl-substituted QA (5) measured in CHCl3 shows the λem at 535 nm and a shoulder at 574 nm (Fig. 5).10 Due to this spectral feature, integration of QA-based fluorophores into the backbone of a blue-emitting polymer provides an opportunity for achieving white-emitting polymers. Such a strategy for white light emission has been successfully realized.
 Fig. 5  Absorption (solid line) and emission (dashed line) spectra of N,N′-dibutyl-substituted QA in dilute CHCl3 solution. 
Wang's group25 synthesized a series of conjugated polymers 43 (Scheme 16) by incorporating various contents of didecyl-substituted QA into the backbone of polyfluorene, and they fabricated single-layer OLED devices [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/43/Ca/Al] using these polymers. The devices showed wide emission with blue and greenish-yellow components from polyfluorene and QA moieties, respectively. The relative intensity of the two emission components could be finetuned by adjusting the contents of the QA unit. A white-emitting device with a balanced ratio between blue and greenish-yellow components was achieved by using the polymer with the QA-unit content of 0.03 mol%. The device exhibited CIE coordinates of (0.27, 0.35), a CEmax of 3.47 cd A−1, a PEmax of 2.18 lm W−1, and a Lmax of 9062 cd m−2. Although the device displayed white light, the white emission was not pure as the CIE coordinate deviated from the standard CIE of (0.33, 0.33) for white light. Moon's group54 synthesized similar polymers 44 (Scheme 16) by using the dithienyl-QA unit to replace the QA unit. Because the dithienyl-QA unit showed longer-wavelength emission with a bathochromic shift of about 30 nm compared to the QA unit, the 44-based single-layer device [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/44/BaF2/Ba/Al] was able to produce white light with better color purity (CIE: 0.31, 0.35). The device exhibited a CEmax of 0.50 cd A−1, a PEmax of 0.24 lm W−1, and a Lmax of 1450 cd m−2.

4. Active materials for solar cells
OSCs are an attractive technology with the potential to replace the widely used inorganic solar cells.55 Taking advantage of the strong light-absorption and high stability, QAs were initially applied in Schottky-type cells in 1984 by Yokoyama and co-workers.56 However, the fabricated devices exhibited unsatisfactory performance. Motivated by the application of QAs in solar cells, Fattori et al. studied the photoconduction properties of QA (1) by using the time-of-flight technique and observed that 1 exhibited a strong photoconductive effect in films.57 Recently, the photoconductivity was also detected for nanocrystals of 1 through a photodetector reported by Heiss and co-workers.23a Through the luminescence study of the film of 1, Rossi, Kalinowski and co-workers disclosed that an excimer state hybridized with charge-transfer states could be formed after the photoexcitation of 1 in films, and the formation of charge-transfer states was believed to be the primary step for free carrier generation.58 Based on the established knowledge, in recent years QAs have been applied in BHJ solar cells and DSSCs, which are very promising techniques for commercial applications. As shown in Chart 2, a typical BHJ solar cell consists of a transparent anode with high work function (e.g. indium-tin-oxide), an active layer composed of a blend of donor and acceptor materials, and a metal cathode with low work function (e.g. Al and Mg). The general working principle involves three steps: firstly, the excitons are generated upon photoexcitation of the active layer; secondly, the exciton dissociation/charge separation takes place at the donor–acceptor interface; at last, driven by either the built-in electric field or the charge carrier concentration gradient, the separated electrons and holes move towards the electrodes to afford the photocurrent. Based on the working principle, several basic requirements are rationally suggested for high-performance active materials (both donors and acceptors) of BHJ solar cells: (1) strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared spectral range to effectively generate excitons; (2) suitable energy levels to promote the exciton dissociation/charge separation; (3) high hole or electron mobility and good film-forming properties to readily export the photocurrent.59 The typical DSSCs possess inorganic semiconductors (e.g. TiO2) as electron acceptors, organic dyes as photo sensitizers, and electrolytes as the media for charge exchange. The ideal organic sensitizers of DSSCs should have strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, suitable energy levels, and a firm graft on the inorganic semiconductor surface.60 Moreover, because solar cells are irradiated under solar light and the redox processes take place continuously, the high photo and electrochemical stability of active materials in BHJ solar cells and DSSCs is much appreciated.

4.1 Donor materials for BHJ solar cells
Ma's group12a reported QA derivatives 45–47 (Scheme 17) as donors for BHJ solar cells in an early study. The alkyl chains were introduced to these compounds for enhancing solubility. The thiophene-containing substituents in 46 and 47 were adopted for improving light-absorption and charge-transporting properties. 46 and 47 showed smaller optical band gap values (Eoptg) of 2.09 and 1.94 eV, respectively, in comparison with 45 (Eoptg = 2.25 eV) due to the introduction of thiophene-containing substituents. The HOMO levels of 45–47 were determined to be in the range of −5.80 to −5.55 eV and the LUMO levels were around −3.3 eV, suggesting their capacity to work as donor materials when PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) was adopted as the acceptor material. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells with the structure of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/QA derivative:PC71BM (∼90 nm)/Al (100 nm)]. The device characteristics including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 1. Among these devices, the 47-based device showed the highest PCE of 2.22% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 8.87 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35%. The highest Jsc of a 47-based solar cell was derived from the best absorption feature of 47 in terms of width and intensity. This work revealed the utility of QA-based donors in BHJ solar cells. However, the devices based on 45–47 showed an unsatisfied FF of 28–40% which largely limited the PCEs. The low FF is a common problem for small-molecule donors which generally have worse film formation properties in comparison with polymers.61 Therefore, a lot of QA-based polymer donors were developed afterward.

 Scheme 17  Small-molecule donor materials 45–47 for BHJ solar cells. 
Moon's group12b reported a polymer (48 in Scheme 18) based on a small molecule 47, composed of QA and benzothiadiazole units. The Eoptg of 48 (1.92 eV) was close to that of 47. The solar cell using 48:PC71BM as the active layer exhibited good performance with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 55.8% and a PCE of 2.5% (Table 1). By replacing the benzothiadiazole unit of 48 with the quinoxaline moiety, Moon's group62 further developed a series of QA-based polymers 49–51 (Scheme 18) with small Eoptg around 1.9 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 49–51 were around −5.4 and −3.5 eV, respectively, indicating their capacities as electron donors. Based on the experiments of out-of-plane and in-plane X-ray diffraction, the edge-on π-stacking of 49 and 51, as well as the face-on π-stacking of 50, was revealed in films. The face-on π-stacking of 50 benefited the realization of large Jsc. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells using 49–51 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor (Table 1). Among them, the 50-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 2.3% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 5.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51.1%. In addition, using PFN (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) as an interlayer between the active layer and the cathode, the 50-based device exhibited an enhanced PCE of 3.6%. The improved PCE was attributed to the better interfacial adhesion and electron transport between the active layer and the cathode caused by the interlayer material.
 Scheme 18  Polymer-based donor materials 48–57 for BHJ solar cells. 
Inspired by the encouraging photovoltaic properties of 50, Moon's group63 developed a series of analogous polymers 52–55 (Scheme 18) with various alkoxy groups. From 50 to para-substituted 52 and 53 and then to meta-substituted 54 and 55, the Eoptg decreased gradually. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells using 52–55 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor (Table 1). Among them, the 55-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 2.1% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 4.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.3%. The stronger π–π stacking in 54/55 compared with 52/53, which was revealed by X-ray diffraction of solid films, contributed to the higher Jsc of the solar cells of 54 and 55.
By adopting diketopyrrolopyrrole/isoindigo as the electron-accepting moiety and the QA unit as the electron-donating moiety, Moon's group64 synthesized D–A type polymers 56 and 57 (Scheme 18). The polymers showed the HOMO/LUMO levels around −5.3/−3.7 eV and small Eoptg of ca. 1.65 eV. In addition, they exhibited face-on orientation in films. The BHJ solar cells using 56 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor (Table 1) exhibited a PCE of 1.6%, and the 57-based cell showed a PCE of 1.9%.
By using benzoxadiazole as the electron-accepting unit, Moon's group65 prepared a series of QA-based polymers 58–60 with various spacers between QA and benzoxadiazole units (Scheme 19). The HOMO levels of the polymers were around −5.3 eV, and the LUMO levels were in the range of −3.27 to −3.49 eV. The Eoptg values were from 1.77 to 2.07 eV. The HOMOs of 58 with the thiophene spacer and 59 with the thienothiophene spacer were distributed on the entire polymer backbone, while the LUMOs of them were mainly located on benzoxadiazole units. In contrast, both the HOMO and the LUMO of 60 with a bithiophene spacer were located on the benzoxadiazole–thiophene units. The separated HOMO and LUMO for 58 and 59 were believed to facilitate exciton dissociation. In addition, the higher crystallinity of 59 in solid films, as compared to 58 and 60, contributed to a larger Jsc. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells using 58–60 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor (Table 1). Among them, the 59-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 2.5% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 7.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 43.5%. In addition, an enhanced PCE of 3.6% was obtained for a 59-based device with an inverted structure.
 Scheme 19  Polymer-based donor materials 58–60 for BHJ solar cells. 
The D–A type QA-based polymers could be constructed by combining the QA unit with not only strongly electron-accepting moieties, but also strongly electron-donating moieties. Moon's group66 reported a QA-based polymer 61 (Scheme 20) exploring quaterthiophene as an electron-donating unit. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 61 were −5.10 and −2.98 eV, respectively, and the Eoptg was 2.12 eV. In addition, 61 exhibited edge-on stacking with a close π–π distance of 3.5 Å in solid film. The solar cell using 61:PC71BM as the active layer exhibited a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 7.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 43.0% and a PCE of 2.0% (Table 1). Furthermore, the device showed good stability under ambient conditions. The PCE maintained about 80% of the initial value after one month.
 Scheme 20  Polymer-based donor materials 61–63 for BHJ solar cells. 
By using bithiophene/dithienylethene as the electron-donating unit, Fu's group67 synthesized QA-based polymers 62 and 63 (Scheme 20). The HOMO/LUMO levels of the polymers were around −5.3/−3.3 eV and the Eoptg values were about 1.9 eV. The films of the polymers showed high crystallinity, possessing strong π–π interactions as well as high hole motilities of 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 62 and 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 63. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells using 62/63 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor (Table 1). The 63-based device exhibited a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 9.74 mA cm−2, a FF of 55% and a PCE of 3.90%. In comparison with the 62-based device showing a PCE of 2.71%, the higher performance of the 63-based one was attributed to the better intercalation of PC71BM into the lamellar structure of the film, which was revealed by TEM images and DFT-calculations.
In short, the BHJ solar cells using QA derivatives as electron donors show large Voc and high FF values because of their low HOMO levels and strong π–π stacking, respectively. However, the Jsc values of these devices, which are directly correlated with the absorption properties, are not satisfied. In the future, substantially enhancing the ICT transitions of D–A type QAs by precisely arranging the electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties should be a reasonable approach to achieve better photovoltaic properties.
4.2 Acceptor materials for BHJ solar cells
In general, QAs are p-type semiconductors and are commonly used as donor materials in BHJ solar cells. However, recent studies indicated that modifications of the CO moieties with strong electron-withdrawing groups can significantly lower the LUMO level and decrease the Eoptg, so that non-fullerene acceptor materials68 based on QA derivatives could be realized. Wang's group33 synthesized QA derivatives 64–66 (Scheme 21) by replacing the CO groups of the QA core with dicyanoethylene groups. In comparison with the N,N′-dialkylated QA chromophore (LUMO level of about −3.2 eV), 64–66 showed much lower LUMO levels of ca. −4.0 eV, which were very close to that of the fullerene-type acceptor PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester; LUMO level: ca. −4.0 eV). In addition, good electron motilities of about 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were determined for 64–66 based on the space-charge-limited current method. The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells by using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the donor and 64–66 as the acceptor (Table 2). Among these devices, the 66-based one with a Voc of 0.48 V, a Jsc of 5.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57% showed the highest PCE of 1.57% because of its ideal film morphology. Furthermore, in comparison with the reference device with P3HT:PC61BM as the active layer, the 66-based one showed a much stronger response to the solar light in the range of 650–700 nm due to the absorption of 66.

In a following study, Wang's group69 incorporated oligo(3-hexylthiophene) chains into 66 and got QA-based electron acceptors 67–69 (Scheme 21). Upon increasing the number of hexylthiophene units, the absorption was gradually enhanced and red-shifted while the LUMO level remained unchanged (about −4.0 eV). The authors fabricated BHJ solar cells using P3HT as the donor and 67–69 as the acceptor (Table 2). The 68-based device showed the highest PCE of 0.51% due to its desirable film morphology. In addition, the 68-based device showed a response to the solar light up to 750 nm which was longer than the response limit of the 66-based one.
Furthermore, through condensing carbonyl groups of QAs with cyanoacetic acid, two series of acceptors 70–72 and 73–75 (Scheme 21) with a six-ring-fused skeleton were readily synthesized by Wang's group.34 These compounds showed good solubilities, intense absorptions and low-lying LUMO levels of ca. −3.7 eV. BHJ solar cells were fabricated by using P3HT as the donor and 70–75 as the acceptor (Table 2), among which the 72-based one showed the highest PCE of 0.42%.
In a short summary, the study of QA-based electron acceptors opens a new path for the application of QAs. Until now, QA-based acceptors have only been combined with P3HT donors to study their photovoltaic properties. A much higher photovoltaic performance of QA-based acceptors could be achieved by rationally matching them with various donor materials and carefully controlling the morphologies of blend films. In addition, the development of new QA-based electron acceptors, including not only small molecules but also polymers, deserves more investigations in the future.
4.3 Sensitizers for DSSCs
With tunable absorption properties and energy levels, QAs can be employed as metal-free organic sensitizers in DSSCs. Kim's group70 prepared D–A type molecules 76 and 77 (Scheme 22) by linking a QA chromophore and a strongly electron-accepting cyanoacrylic acid moiety with the thiophene/benzene spacer. The oxidation potentials of these compounds were around 1.2 V (vs. NHE), which were higher than the redox potential of the iodine/iodide electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE). At the same time, the LUMO levels of them were about −1.0 eV (vs. NHE), lower than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 eV vs. NHE). The desirable energy levels made the compounds suitable for working as sensitizers in DSSCs (Table 3). In comparison with the 77-based cell showing a PCE of 2.30%, the 76-based one exhibited an obviously improved PCE of 3.86% because of its stronger and wider absorption.

Through adopting furan as the spacer and triarylamine as an additional donor, Tian's group27 developed three derivatives of 76/77 (78–80 in Scheme 22). In comparison with the thiophene and benzene spacers in 76/77, the smaller furan spacer led to a more planar skeleton of the QA-spacer-acceptor moiety. Compared with 76 and 77, 78–80 exhibited enhanced ICT absorptions, i.e. bathochromic absorption and improved extinction coefficients. Highly efficient DSSCs based on sensitizers 78–80 were fabricated (Table 3) and the 78-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 6.80% with a Voc of 0.776 V, a Jsc of 12.42 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71%. Moreover, through adding chenodeoxycholic acid which suppressed the dye aggregation, the 78-based device showed an enhanced PCE of 7.70%. Notably, the long-term stability of the 78-based DSSC with ionic-liquid electrolytes under 1000 h light soaking was demonstrated.
5. Cathode interlayer materials
CIL materials located between the cathode and the active layer have been widely used to achieve superior performance of OLEDs and BHJ solar cells through improving the electron injection/extraction and transport. Compared with conventional inorganic CIL materials, organic CIL materials possess a few advantages, such as better stability toward oxygen/moisture, suitability for spin-coating/ink-jet printing, and readily tunable structures and properties.71 As such, this class of materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Organic CIL materials are commonly composed of a π-conjugated skeleton and several polar groups such as pyridinium, ammonium, sulfonate and phosphonate. In consideration of its good semiconducting properties and high stability, the QA core has been employed as the π-conjugated skeleton to construct CIL materials.
Wudl's group72 reported a series of water/alcohol-soluble QA derivatives 81–84 (Scheme 23) with sulfonate anions and various counter cations. The performance of 81–84 as CIL materials was revealed from the solution-processed OLEDs with the structure of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV/81–84/Al], which were fabricated by sequentially spin-coating the toluene solution of MEH-PPV (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]) and the methanol/water solution of 81–84. A reference device with Ba as the CIL and another one without the CIL were also fabricated. In comparison with the Ba-based device (efficiency: 0.85 cd A−1), 81- and 82-based ones showed much higher performance with efficiencies of 1.22 and 1.65 cd A−1, respectively, at a current density of 300 mA cm−2. This result indicated the effectiveness of CIL materials 81 and 82. The 83- and 84-based devices exhibited comparatively low efficiencies of about 0.11 cd A−1, probably due to the counter cation. However, they were still effective in improving the device performance considering that the reference device without the CIL exhibited a much poorer efficiency of 0.0065 cd A−1. The comparison between the performance of 81/82 with a sodium cation and 83/84 with a tetraphenylphosphonium cation suggested that the large size of the cation suppressed the molecular aggregation and thus decreased the electron mobilities and device efficiencies.

Considering the good performance of CIL material 82 in OLEDs, the compound was further applied as the CIL in BHJ solar cells by Wudl's group.73 The PCEs of BHJ solar cells using PCDTBT:PC71BM and Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM as active layers were increased from 4.34% to 5.17% and from 2.89% to 3.23%, respectively, indicating the wide effectiveness of 82 (PCDTBT: poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]; Si-PCPDTBT: poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]silole)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]).
Wang's group74 recently reported two QA-based CIL materials 85 and 86 (Scheme 23) with pyridinium moieties and applied them in high-performance BHJ solar cells. Based on the active layer of PCDTBT:PC71BM, the solar cells with CILs of 85 and 86 showed PCEs of 6.70 and 6.96%, respectively. These PCEs were much higher than that of the device without a CIL (PCE: 5.21%) and even higher than that of the device with a classic CIL material LiF (PCE: 5.95%), which demonstrated the outstanding properties of QA-based CIL materials. In addition, the authors studied the CIL thickness-dependent PCE characteristics of 85 and 86 (Fig. 6). The 85-based solar cells showed high PCEs only in a narrow CIL-thickness range (5–15 nm), which was similar to the observations on the devices with most of the other organic CILs. In contrast, the 86-based ones exhibited high PCEs in a wide range of CIL thicknesses (5–40 nm). This improvement was attributed to the enhanced electron mobility of 86 with four strongly electron-withdrawing nitrile groups. The effectiveness of 86 as a CIL material was further demonstrated in the solar cells with various active layers, such as P3HT/PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM (PTB7: poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl})).

The study of organic CIL materials is emerging. Several water/alcohol-soluble QAs have been successfully applied as interlayer materials in OLEDs and BHJ solar cells. They are very attractive for fabricating large-area devices by spin-coating and ink-jet printing. QA-based CIL materials are very limited and should be an important topic in the future.
6. Active channel materials for OFETs
OFETs are three-terminal electronics using organic semiconductors as active channel materials and recognized to be one of the key components of modern electronics.75 The structure of a typical bottom-gate, top-contact OFET is shown in Chart 3. Upon applying a voltage between the gate electrode and the semiconductor, a thin sheet of mobile electronic charges is induced in the semiconductor. The charge density can be controlled over a wide range by tuning the applied gate voltage. As a result, the electric current between the source and drain electrodes can be efficiently modulated simply by adjusting the gate voltage. For high-performance active channel materials of OFETs, small reorganization energy and dense packing structures in film are critical factors. Basically, large π-extended molecules with a rigid skeleton are good active channel materials of OFETs.76
 Chart 3  The OFET device with a bottom-gate, top-contact configuration. 
Pentacene is a representative organic semiconductor and shows high mobility in OFET devices.77 However, the poor stability of pentacene toward oxygen seriously limits its application.78 In terms of molecular structure and size, QA is an analog of pentacene. In addition, the intrinsic stable character of QA towards air and the redox process is highly desirable for long-life OFETs. In this decade, a number of small molecules and polymers based on QA have been synthesized and applied in OFET studies.
The parent QA (1) was initially applied in OFETs by Yanagisawa and co-workers.79 Subsequently, the high stability of 1-based OFETs was demonstrated by Sokolowski's group.80 However, 1 showed a low hole mobility (μh) of 0.0015 cm2 V−1 s−1. Głowacki and co-workers13a,13b carefully studied the semiconducting properties of 1 and compared it with pentacene. Through controlling the molecule orientation, 1-based OFETs realized a much improved μh of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The device was very stable in air, with the μh maintained 80% of the initial value after 115 days. In contrast, the μh of a pentacene-based OFET deteriorated by two orders of magnitude over several days. The result suggested that hydrogen-bonded 1 supported carrier transport with the characters of outstanding stability and high mobility.
Che's group81 applied a series of N,N′-dialkylated 1,3,8,10-tetramethylquinacridone 6 and 88–90 (Scheme 24) in OFETs. All of them exhibited p-type field-effect behaviors. Among these devices, the 89-based OFET exhibited the best performance due to its higher crystallinity and a better film morphology, showing a μh of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 104 and a threshold voltage (VT) of −17 V. In addition, the device was very stable, and the μh maintained about 90% of the initial value after 100-cycles of measurements in air or two years of storage of the device in a glovebox.
 Scheme 24  Active channel materials for OFETs. 
Wang's group reported a QA derivative 91 (Scheme 24)32 with a 11-ring-fused core structure. The compound showed good solubility, as well as aggregation tendency in concentrated solutions and in thin films. The compound can be regarded as a thiophene-fused derivative of compound 66 that is an n-type material for BHJ solar cells. However, a solution-processed OFET based on 91 showed p-type field-effect behavior with a μh of 0.217 cm2 V−1 s−1, an Ion/Ioff of 2.6 × 106 and a VT of −11.0 V.
By means of copolymerizing QA units with bithiophene and terthiophene, Takimiya's group13c prepared polymers 62 and 92 (Scheme 24), respectively. The polymers formed dense π–π stacking with a short π–π distance of 3.6 Å in films. The OFETs based on these polymers showed p-type field-effect behaviors with a μh of around 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff of about 106. Interestingly, the mobilities of 62 and 92 were insensitive to molecular weights and packing structures in the films. The low-molecular-weight polymer with a randomly oriented packing structure exhibited similar mobility to the high-molecular-weight one possessing an edge-on oriented packing structure. The authors speculated that the relatively localized HOMO on the QA chromophore might hinder the charge transport along the polymer backbone, and thus the long polymer chain was not necessary to facilitate charge transport. The locally but strongly π–π interacting polymer crystallite seemed to be sufficient for the effective charge transport in the QA-based polymer system. This feature offered great interest to use the QA moiety as the building block of semiconducting polymers.
In a following study, Fu's group67 found that 63 with a vinylene linkage between neighbouring thiophene rings (Scheme 24) has an improved planar backbone. As a result, 63 showed a stronger π–π interaction with a shorter π–π distance of 3.49 Å in film and a higher μh of 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs, as compared to 62.
By copolymerizing QA units with diketopyrrolopyrrole, Takimiya's group82 synthesized polymers 93–96 (Scheme 24) with various alkyl chains. The effect of alkyl chains on the packing features of polymers was studied in detail. 93 with four linear alkyl chains formed edge-on stacking in films, while 94–96 with two or four branched alkyl chains formed face-on stacking. All the polymers showed the distances of 3.5–3.8 Å for the π–π interactions, and they exhibited moderate μh in the order of 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Fu's group83 reported two polymers 97 and 48 (Scheme 24) composed of QA and benzothiadiazole units. The comparison between 97 and 48 indicated that the additional alkoxyl chains on the benzothiadiazole unit not only enhanced solubility and molecular weight but also altered photophysical and electrochemical properties and the conformation of the polymer chain. As a result, 97 and 48 exhibited quite different aggregating structures in films and mobilities in OFETs. Indeed, 48 showed an ordered lamellar structure and a μh up to 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1, while 97 featured a disordered packing structure and a low μh of 5.77 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
The most attractive feature of QAs as active channel materials for OFETs is their intrinsic stable character towards air and the redox process, which is essential for long-life OFETs. In addition, the strong π–π interactions in films endow QAs with good hole mobility. A further improvement of the hole mobility of QA-based materials is essential and deserves more attention in the future. Moreover, several QA-based acceptor materials have been developed for BHJ solar cells, suggesting the potential of QAs to work as ambipolar and n-type semiconductors of OFETs.
7. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, QAs have shown their wide utilities in organic electronic devices. As one class of representative green-emitting materials for OLEDs, QAs are able to realize good EL performance in terms of lifetimes, brightness and efficiencies. The recent development of yellow-, red- and white-emitting QAs has enriched the roles of QAs in OLEDs. QAs have also been employed as both donor and acceptor materials in BHJ solar cells, and an encouraging device performance has already been achieved. Moreover, QAs have been demonstrated to be attractive sensitizers that can realize appreciable PCEs and stability for DSSCs. The application of QAs as CIL materials for improving the performance of OLEDs and OSCs is also of great interest although relative studies are still quite limited. As active channel materials for OFETs, QAs have shown their capability to realize good hole mobility and device stability.
In the past three decades, the studies on QA-based electronic materials have achieved considerable progress. However, they are still relatively limited in comparison with those on some other organic pigments, such as diketopyrrolopyrroles, isoindigos and perylene diimides. We believe that after further development and improvement, QA-based electronic materials will achieve much more success not only in OLEDs, OSCs and OFETs but also in new-type devices, such as memory devices, photodetectors and so on.
