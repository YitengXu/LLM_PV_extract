, Accepted 8th August 2016First published on 8th August 2016AbstractIn this manuscript, a novel hierarchical ZnO nanosheets branched electrospun TiO2 non-woven fabric film is prepared and used as a photoanode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Porous ZnO nanosheets grown on a TiO2 nanofiber are synthesized via simple hydrothermal reaction followed by a calcination process, which is proven to provide both large surface areas for QDs loading and superior light-scattering capability. Detailed photoelectrochemical measurements, including UV-vis diffuse reflectance and absorption spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), etc., reveal that, compared with a bare TiO2 nanofiber film, the hierarchical fibrous film exhibits enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, suppressed electron recombination and superior charge-collection efficiency, thus leading to both improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Therefore, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell is greatly improved from 2.37% for a bare TiO2 nanofiber film to 3.05%. A Cu2S counter electrode can help to yield a conversion efficiency as high as 4.21%.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), as low-cost and high-performance solar devices for clean energy sources, have attracted considerable attention in recent years and shown promise for the development of solar cells.1–3 Compared with organic or complex dyes, narrow band-gap semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS,4,5 CdSe,6,7 PbS,8,9 InAs,10 etc., exhibit excellent optical and electronic properties. All the advantages lead to a theoretical maximum thermodynamic conversion efficiency up to 44%.11,12 However, the conversion efficiency of liquid-junction QDSSCs still witnesses a great gap between the practical devices and theoretical models. It is believed that the inhibition of serious electron recombination in cells is vital to improve the conversion efficiencies of QDSSCs.
Apart from the effort to synthesize high-quality QDs, controlling the morphology and structure of photoanode materials was another effective way to enhance the photovoltaic performance of cells. Given the fact that QDs have a stronger extinction coefficient and larger size than organic or complex dye molecules, larger sized porous structures were usually required in photoanode films for QDSSCs. Compared to nanoparticle based films, one-dimensional (1D) or quasi-1D nanostructured films, such as nanowire, nanotube or nanorod based photoanodes, were considered as the more promising candidates, because they can not only provide sufficient interior spaces for QDs loading and electrolyte permeation, but also offer direct electron transport pathways and suppress the electron recombination. Therefore, various kinds of 1D metal oxide nanostructure have been studied in QDSSCs.13–16 It is known that 1D nanostructured photoanode always suffers from the low light-harvesting efficiency due to their low surface area, and this problem could be resolved by either increasing the QDs loading or enhancing the scattering effect of the incident light within the photoanode, thus to increase the internal surface area and light-harvesting efficiency. The enhanced photovoltaic performances have been illustrated by several groups by constructing hyperbranched three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure photoanodes which employed the secondary nanostructures grown on patent 1D matrix to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency, e.g., nanorods coated TiO2 nanowire arrays,17–19 ZnO nanorods-nanosheets composite film,20,21 branched ZnO nanowires arrays.22 In addition, it was also found that the heterogeneous hyperbranched nanostructure built by smart integrating specific semiconductors were also beneficial to photovoltaic performance of cells, for instance, ZnO nanorod/nanosheet coated TiO2 nanowire arrays,23 nanocable structure of ZnO nanorods (NRs) coated with TiO2 nanosheets (NSs),24 ZnO NRs on Si nanowires hierarchical branched structure,25 have been reported. All these hierarchical 1D nanostructures performed an enhanced light-harvesting ability thus a high photo-generated current density.
Electrospinning technique which employs electrostatic force to drive and stretch the liquid jet is a simple and effective way to continuously fabricate 1D metal oxide nanofibers. The long nanofiber and large pores in as-formed non-woven fabric film make it a promising photoanode candidate for QDSSCs, which can provide direct electron transport pathway to gain high charge-collection efficiency, and also facilitate the QDs loading and electrolyte permeation. However, little attention has been paid to electrospun non-woven fibrous film based QDSSCs partially due to the difficulty in preparing photoanode film.26–29 TiO2 is commonly used as the photoelectrode for solar cells, and ZnO is also known to have similar energy-band structure and physical properties, which exhibits unique electronic and optical properties. So the combination of ZnO and TiO2 would be a superior option for efficient photoanode with synergistic effects. In this study, we report a novel hierarchical ZnO nanosheets coated TiO2 nanofiber film as efficient phtotoanode material for QDSSCs. Electrospun TiO2 non-woven nanofiber film stuck on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate is used as the scaffold to in situ grow ZnO nanosheets branches. The long electrospun nanofiber can offer direct pathways for electron transport and suppress the charge recombination; moreover, the porous ZnO NSs consist of nanoparticles can greatly increase the surface area and light-scattering effect. Therefore, a conversion efficiency of 3.05% is obtained for the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized composite photoanode based cells, which is much higher than that of bare TiO2 fibers photoanode (2.37%) and can be improved further to 4.21% by employing Cu2S counter electrode. The photovoltaic performance and electron transport dynamics of cells are investigated in detail, which reveal that the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, the suppressed electron recombination and enhanced electron-collection efficiency of hierarchical hybrid photoanode contribute to the impressive performances.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanofiber/ZnO nanosheets (TiO2–ZnO NSs) hierarchical photoanode
First, TiO2 non-woven fibrous film was prepared using the well-established method in our lab.30 Briefly, TiO2/PVP composite nanofibers were first electrospun on FTO glass (15 Ω per square) from a precursor solution that containing tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT, 3 g), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0.8 g), acetic acid (1 g), and ethanol (5.2 g), a high voltage of 20 kV was applied over a collector distance of 15 cm, the TiO2 nanofiber films were peeled off from the original FTO glass after calcination. The thickness of fibrous film was controlled by electrospun time and film of 8 μm was selected. By using the electrospun solution as the glue layer, the TiO2 nanofiber film was adhered onto the surface of FTO glass. The thickness of adhesive layer is ∼1 μm after calcination. Then the above TiO2 film was immersed in a ZnO sol solution at room temperature for 30 min and then heated to 300 °C for 30 min, which resulted in a ZnO seed layer coating on TiO2 fibers surface. To prepare the ZnO sol, 0.6 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O was dissolved in 25 mL ethanol firstly. After stirring 2 h, 1.5 mL diethanolamine was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 2 h to obtain a clear ZnO sol solution. Finally, the ZnO seeded TiO2 films were immersed in a aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.1 M hexamethylenetetramine, and 0.01 M sodium citrate at 90 °C for 3 h, which led to the formation of TiO2–ZnO NSs hybrid architecture. The sample was calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to further improve the crystallinity of ZnO.
2.2. Electrodeposition of CdS/CdSe QDs
A two-electrode cell was used to electrodeposit QDs with the bare TiO2 or TiO2–ZnO NSs film as the working electrode and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. For electrodeposition of CdS, the electrolyte was a 1/1 (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/water solution of 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.2 M thiourea. The electrodeposition was conducted with a constant current of 0.625 mA cm−2, and it was lasted for 18 min in a 90 °C water bath. For electrodeposition of CdSe, the electrolyte was an aqueous solution containing 0.02 M of Cd(CH3COO)2, 0.04 M of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), and 0.02 M of new prepared Na2SeSO3 (obtained by refluxing 0.48 g of Se powder and 2.0 g of Na2SO3 in water at 100 °C for 3 h), and its pH was adjusted to about 7.5. The electrodeposition was performed with a constant current of 0.625 mA cm−2 lasting for 28 min at room temperature.31
2.3. Fabrication of TiO2 or TiO2–ZnO NSs photoanode based QDSSCs
The TiO2 or TiO2–ZnO NSs film were used as photoanodes for QDSSCs. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance, the photoanodes were assembled with platinum or Cu2S counter electrode in a sandwich type, and the polysulfide electrolyte was injected into the spaces between them. The platinum counter electrode and polysulfide electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M NaOH in 7:3 (v/v) methanol/water were the same as those in our previous report.13 The Cu2S counter electrode was synthesized through facile chemical bath deposition method. 0.24 g of CuSO4 was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water, and then N2 was bubbled for 10 min to prevent the dissolved oxygen in water. Then, 0.37 g of Na2S2O3·5H2O was added to the solution, forming a light-green solution, a FTO glass was immersed to the system, with its conductive surface facing down and had an angle against the wall, which was kept in a 90 °C water bath for 1 h. After that, the Cu2S counter electrode was rinsed with deionized water and dried in ambient air.
2.4. Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-6330F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL-2010 HR) were used to characterize the morphology and structure of TiO2 or TiO2–ZnO NSs film. The penetration of QDs into the photoanode was also characterized by FE-SEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry system. Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) was used to characterize the phase structure of the samples. The diffuse reflectance spectra and absorption spectroscopy were performed on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600). The photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs was recorded by a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under one sun AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) by a solar light simulator (Oriel model 91192). The intensity was adjusted by a NREL-calibrated silicon solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 380 to 800 nm by a Keithley 2000 multimeter incorporated with a Spectral Product DK 240 monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) in dark condition. The applied biases were equal to the negative value of Voc for each sample, and the amplitude was 10 mV for the bias and the frequency ranged from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. Impedance parameters were analyzed by fitting of the impedance spectra using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was carried out on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) under a modulated green-light-emitting diode (457 nm) with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The film thickness was measured by a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a and b show the morphology of the as-prepared electrospun TiO2 nanofiber film. Smooth nanofiber with diameter ranging from 400 to 600 nm while length up to millimeter scale can be clearly observed and the nanofiber film contact tightly with the FTO glass substrate, indicating electrospun non-woven fibrous film based electrode can be prepared successfully via post pasting method. The loose film was ∼8 μm in thick, its XRD pattern can be indexed to highly crystallized anatase phase without any impurity (Fig. S1,† JCPDS Card no. 21-1272). Such nanofiber structure with less surface defects may perform elegant electron transport properties. By a following hydrothermal reaction with zinc nitrate solution at 90 °C for 3 h, ZnO nanosheets (ZnO NSs) can be observed on each nanofiber, which make the nanofiber film denser, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. ZnO NSs show smooth surface with thickness of ∼60 nm. The TEM image (Fig. 1e) further confirms that the nanosheets grow uniformly on the surface of the bare TiO2 fiber backbone forming a heterogeneous shell; however, the crystallinity of ZnO NSs is a little poor with many amorphous phase exist (Fig. 1e, inset and Fig. S1†). This situation can be figured out by calcining samples at 500 °C (sample denote as TiO2–ZnO NSs-500), during which ZnO NSs are well crystallized (Fig. 1h and S1†). Interestingly, the nanosheets structure changed from smooth sheets to porous ones, which are composed of small nanoparticles with diameter of ∼20 nm, as shown in Fig. 1f and g. This structure can be confirmed by TEM image (Fig. 1h), which clearly shows nanoparticle based porous structure. The high crystallinity of ZnO nanobranches and special porous structure would be beneficial to QDs loading and electron transport. As shown in Fig. 2, after electrodeposition, an even QDs coating is formed on the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film. XRD pattern confirms the loading of CdS and CdSe (JCPDS cards of CdS and CdSe are no. 65-3414 and 65-2891, respectively). In addition, elemental mapping images measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) demonstrate that both CdS and CdSe QDs are distributed evenly across top to bottom of film (Fig. 2b, magenta square), which should be attributed to the large pore structure of non-woven fabric film. On contrast, deposition of QDs on uncalcined TiO2–ZnO NSs composite film is very difficult due to the poor crystallinity of ZnO.

Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curve of this hierarchical heterogeneous photoanode based cell. For comparison, bare TiO2 nanofiber film and TiO2–ZnO NSs film without thermal treatment based cells are also tested. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The short-circuit density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) were 13.64 mA cm−2, 511 mV, 0.44 and 3.05% for TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell, while the values for bare TiO2 nanofiber film based cell were 11.27 mA cm−2, 485 mV, 0.44 and 2.37%, respectively. The power conversion efficiency was significantly promoted due to the utilization of hierarchical structure. It should be noted that if the hierarchical film was directly used as photoanode, skip the calcination process, the obtained conversion efficiency was extremely low (0.32%). This is due to the poor crystallinity of ZnO NSs, which resulted in poor QDs loading. Therefore, calcination process is vital for the photovoltaic performance of TiO2–ZnO NSs heterogeneous structure.

Compared with bare TiO2 nanofiber photoanode, the hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film exhibited both enhanced Jsc and Voc value, thus higher η. The enhanced Jsc can be attributed to the strong light-harvesting ability of hierarchical film. As shown in Fig. 4a, both the two films exhibit strong diffused reflectance over a wavelength range from 380 to 800 nm; but the diffused reflectance ability of the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film is much stronger than bare TiO2 fiber film, due to the function of porous ZnO nanosheets. It indicates the hierarchical film can effectively prolong the optical path within the photoanode films thus utilize the incident light effectively. After loading with QDs, the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 composite film showed obvious higher absorption values throughout the visible region from the absorption spectra, indicating better light-harvesting efficiency for hierarchical photoanode (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c shows the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the two cells. For the IPCE spectra of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs, the value in short wavelength region (<520 nm) is due to the light harvest of CdS and CdSe, whereas only CdSe contributes to the long wavelength region photoelectric conversion; together a better overall IPCE response was observed.32 The TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based solar cell exhibited higher IPCE values than bare TiO2 based cell over the whole response range and a high value of ∼70% between 380 and 650 nm were obtained. The calculated current density from the area of the IPCE curve was 10.14 and 12.49 mA cm−2 for the TiO2 and TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 sample, respectively, showing the same trend as the IPCE values. According to the expression IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)φinj(λ)φregηcc(λ), where the LHE is light-harvesting efficiency, φinj(λ) and φreg are the quantum yields for electron injection and quantum dot regeneration, respectively, the ηcc(λ) is the charge-collection efficiency,33 the higher IPCE value can be attributed to the better LHE of the hierarchical photoanode. The enlargement of the surface area due to additional growth of ZnO NSs in the TiO2 fibers framework improved both the light-scattering ability and absorption values greatly, which contributed to remarkable enhancement of LHE for the hierarchical photoanode. Therefore, higher Jsc of the hierarchical photoanode based cell than that of smooth one can be rationally explained.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to further explore the improved performance of TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film based QDSSCs. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots for the cells based on bare TiO2 and hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 films at an applied bias of Voc. The first high-frequency arc (R1) was often assigned to the charge transfer resistance at the cathode/electrolyte interface. The R1 of the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell was smaller than the bare TiO2 nanofiber based cell, which was 106 Ω and 152 Ω, respectively, although the same counter electrode were used in both cell. This discrepancy may arise from the more dense structure of TiO2–ZnO NSs composite film which connected more tightly to the FTO substrate, since the charge transfer process at FTO substrate/semiconductor film interface also happened at high-frequency range.30,34–36 The larger semicircle at middle frequency region in the Nyquist plots was assigned to the charge transfer resistance (R2) and corresponding constant phase element (CPE2) across the semiconductor/QDs/electrolyte interface. The R2 of TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell was 224.8 Ω, higher than that of TiO2 fiber based cell (201.8 Ω), indicating a more serious recombination happened in the latter cell. According to the expression τm = R*2CPE2, the electron lifetime (τm) of the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell was estimated to be 186 ms, longer than that of TiO2 fiber based cell (118 ms). The extended electron lifetime may partially result from the thinner QDs layer on hierarchical photoanode film. Unlike the monolayer adsorption behaviour of the dye molecules, QDs usually enable multilayer package onto photoanode material surface. Thus, the status of the QDs layer thickness may exert more complicated influences on cell performances.37–39 According to equation Q = It, the same current density and deposition time during electrodeposition process may lead to the same charge on electrodes, which in turn resulted in the same deposition amount of QDs.40 That is, the QDs loading amount was the same for bare TiO2 and TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film since the same electrodeposition conditions were used.17 Therefore, the thickness of QDs layer was determined by the surface area of different films. To do this job, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was employed to measure the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), thus to estimate the electrochemically active surface areas of two films. The comparison of Cdl values (Fig. S2†) revealed that the active surface area of hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film is about 2 times higher than that of TiO2 film.41,42 This huge change in active surface area led to thinner QDs layer on hierarchical film, which in turn is advantageous to rapid electron injection and transport, reducing the electron recombination. In addition, the heterogeneous energy band structure between TiO2 and ZnO may also facilitate the separation of photo-generated electron and hole, leading to suppressive electron recombination reaction. Therefore, a longer electron lifetime and thus higher Voc can be observed for the hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 photoanode.

To further study the electron recombination kinetics of different photoanodes based QDSSCs, transient photovoltage measurements are conducted by monitoring the Voc as a function of time upon turning off the illumination, and the results are compared in Fig. 6. It is observed that the QDSSCs based on TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film has a significantly slower Voc decay rate than that of TiO2 nanofiber film based cell, suggesting slow recombination rate in TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 photoanode. And according to the electron lifetime τn calculation, via the equation of τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kB is Boltzmann constant and T is temperature, the TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 photoanode based cell exhibited much longer electron lifetime (Fig. 6b). The longer τn indicates more electrons surviving from the back reaction, which leads to higher Voc. So after the growth of ZnO NSs, the electron recombination was effectively reduced and enhanced Voc was obtained.

In addition, the intensity-modulated photo-current spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were introduced to investigate the electron transport dynamics in TiO2 nanofiber and TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film based cells. As shown in Fig. 7a, the electron transport time (τd) and electron lifetime (τr) derived from the IMPS/IMVS measurement are plotted as the function of incident light intensity. Here, τd or τr provide information about the time required for the injected electrons to transport through the photoanodes or recombination, respectively. The bare TiO2 fiber based cell showed lower τd and τr than hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 film based cell, indicating a faster electron transport rate but also faster recombination rate for the former cell; in other words, the introduction of the ZnO nanobranches would prolong the charge transport pathway slightly but also facilitate electron transfer and inhibit the charge recombination effectively. As discussed before, the thinner CdS and CdSe QD layer on hierarchical film may accelerate electron injection from QDs to photoanode, furthermore, the TiO2–ZnO heterojunction can effectively separate the electron and hole, thus effectively suppress the electron recombination. As a result, as shown in Fig. 7b, the ηcc of hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell is much higher than bare TiO2 fiber film based cell, especially at high irritation intensity. The enhanced ηcc also contributed a lot to the value of IPCE thus the Jsc of cells. Taking all factors into accounts, the higher Jsc of the hierarchical TiO2–ZnO NSs-500 based cell can be rationally explained by enhanced light-harvesting efficiency and superior charge-collection efficiency of the hierarchical structures, which is in good agreement of above measurements.

Generally, Pt counter electrode was the common used but not the optimal choice for QDSSCs since it usually caused higher resistance and lower QD regeneration rate due to the poor electrocatalytic activities in polysulfide electrolyte.43 Herein, a substitute Cu2S counter electrode directly grown onto FTO glass through a facile and simple one-step chemical bath deposition method was prepared. The Cu2S film was ∼150 nm in thick which consist of closely packed nanoparticles (∼40 nm in diameter, Fig. S3†). The detailed photovoltaic performance is shown in Fig. 8, an impressive η of 4.21% was achieved with Jsc of 17.15 mA cm−2, Voc of 532 mV, and FF of 0.46. All the photovoltaic parameters exhibited much higher than that of Pt based counterparts (Jsc = 13.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 511 mV, and FF = 0.44). This result is due to the superior electrocatalytic capabilities and lower charge resistance of Cu2S counter electrode.

4. Conclusions
In this study, novel hierarchical ZnO nanosheets branched TiO2 nanofiber non-woven fabric film is fabricated and used as efficient photoanode material for QDSSCs. The porous nanosheets composed of small nanoparticles can greatly increase the surface areas of TiO2 nanofiber for QDs deposition and light-scattering. Compared with bare TiO2 nanofiber film, the hierarchical fibrous film exhibits enhanced light-harvesting efficiency and superior charge-collection efficiency, thus lead to a highly improved Jsc. Moreover, thanks to the longer nanofiber structure, thin QDs sensitized layer and heterojunction structure, a suppressed electron recombination than bare TiO2 nanofiber photoanode is observed, which greatly improves the power conversion efficiency from 2.37% to 3.05%. When in situ grown Cu2S counter electrode is used, a maximum efficiency of 4.21% can be obtained under one sun illumination. These results indicate the electrospun non-woven fabric films based nanomaterials can work as excellent photoelectrode candidates for QDSSCs, or other photoelectric applications.
