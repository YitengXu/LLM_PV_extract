    , Accepted 5th December 2019First published on 9th December 2019AbstractA model fluorinated semiconductivity terpolymer, PBTA-PS-F (D1–A–D2–A), was synthesized and used in polymer solar cells (PSCs). This terpolymer possessed optimal energy levels (HOMO and LUMO, −5.48/−3.53 eV) and a complementary absorption region with small molecule acceptor ITIC. Two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray (2D-GIXD) studies indicated that PBTA-PS-F exhibits strong lamellar stacking and preferable face-on orientation in the pristine film and the film blended with ITIC. A large ground to excited state dipole moment Δμge of 1.84 D was calculated for PBTA-PS-F, which was larger than that of its counterpart copolymer PBTA-PS (0.27 D). Furthermore, ultrafast electron transfer at the fluorinated terpolymer D/A interface was found from the ground state bleach signature (GSB) and excited state absorption signature (ESA) signals. Therefore, a high power conversion efficiency of 13.48% was achieved for the optimized PBTA-PS-F:ITIC device. As a result, employing structurally similar donor moieties as modulators to construct D1–A–D2–A model terpolymers can be used to improve the performance of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) hold promise for fabricating lightweight and flexible devices via the low-cost and high-throughput roll-to-roll production process.1,2 Over the past two decades, polymer solar cells have implemented power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 17.3% in tandem cells, and an amazing breakthrough of PCEs up to 15.7% was obtained in single-junction solar cells.3,4 Great efforts have been devoted to improving the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices, including the development of novel donor materials and non-fullerene acceptors, interface engineering, and device processing technology.5–9 To seek highly efficient organic solar cells, numerous endeavors have been committed to the design and synthesis of novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for a broad photoresponse range across the visible and near IR regions. Also, large short-circuit current density (JSC) with outstanding performance was achieved in this way.10–13 However, few model polymers have kept pace with the rapid expansion of SMAs. Thus, more intensive research should focus on synthesizing new polymers with synergistic effects in their active layers to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs.
In general, most reported polymers follow a simple D–A alternating model, which has been proven to be a facile approach for the preparation of well-performing PSC materials (such as PTB7-Th and PBDB-T).14–17 In fact, most of those reported polymer donors have relatively low open circuit voltages (VOC), which can be mainly attributed to their relatively high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. Considering that random polymerization can result in a deep HOMO energy level or exhibit a broader absorption spectrum, this will lead to higher VOC and larger JSC values than those of the copolymers.18–21 Furthermore, terpolymers have emerged as a promising synthetic strategy for fine-tuning the morphology (e.g., crystallinity and orientation) and charge transport ability.22,23 Usually, in reported work, terpolymers mainly comprise one type of donor unit (D) and two different electron-accepting (A) components in the backbone or contain D and A segments with various lengths of flexible alkyl chains.24,25 The incorporation of multiple building segments in the backbone has drawn significant attention for elevating the PCE of PSCs; meanwhile, using two similar-structure donor elements to fine-tune the HOMO energy level, lamellar packing crystallinity and chain orientation has rarely been investigated. Thus, we utilized a random copolymerization approach with one electron-deficient unit, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, and two electron-rich units, 4,8-bis(4-((2-hexyldecyl)thio)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTPS) and 4,8-bis(3-fluoro-4-((2-hexyldecyl)thio)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTPSF), in equal proportion to generate a random terpolymer, PBTA-PS-F (Fig. 1).6 It has been illustrated that the PCEs of random polymers are gradually improving compared to those of traditional D–A copolymers;26,27 this result is in congruence with our expectation that the introduction of two different segments, namely, D1 and D2, will improve the PCE, especially when the fluorinated BDTPSF building block is incorporated into the backbone of the terpolymer (fluorine atom is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can help attain a low HOMO energy level and be highly beneficial for obtaining a high VOC).

In this work, the polymer structures, molecular packing morphologies and optical and electrical properties of the copolymer PBTA-PS and terpolymer PBTA-PS-F were systematically investigated. Compared with the dipole moment Δμge of PBTA-PS (0.27 D), PBTA-PS-F showed a larger Δμge of 1.84 D. This indicates that a lower Coulomb binding energy and, therefore, faster charge separation kinetics could be realized in this fluorinated terpolymer. Ultrafast (sub-30 fs) pump–probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was used to test the ground state bleach signature (GSB, negative ΔA) and excited state absorption signature (ESA, positive ΔA) when pumped at 400 and 710 nm. Ultrafast electron transfer at the fluorinated terpolymer D/A interface was found based on the GSB and ESA signals. As a result, PBTA-PS-F:ITIC demonstrated outstanding performance, with a PCE of 13.48%, compared to PBTA-PS:ITIC, with a PCE of 11.72%. From all aspects of these studies, we established a terpolymer model (D1–A–D2–A) which provides a reliable method for developing random copolymerization polymers for high-performance non-fullerene PSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
Both target copolymers, PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F, were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction. The molecular structures of the copolymers and small molecular acceptor are depicted in Fig. 1. A detailed synthetic route is provided in the ESI† and a previous literature report by our group.6 In this work, long alkyl side chains were implanted in the donor and acceptor units; therefore, the solubilities of the two target polymers are superior, and the polymers can be readily dissolved in conventional organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Thermal stability analysis (TGA) illustrated that the decomposition temperatures (Td) of the two copolymers are ca. 333 °C for PBTA-PS and 332 °C for PBTA-PS-F at 5% weight loss (Fig. S1†).
Absorption spectra and molecular energy levels
As shown in Fig. 2 and S3,† the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptor ITIC have complementary absorption ranges, which ensures maximum coverage of solar irradiation. The two polymers exhibit similar absorption onsets at around 637 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of almost 1.94 eV (Table 1). The maximum absorption coefficients of the two copolymers were measured in CB solution and are shown in Fig. 2a; the fluorinated terpolymer PBTA-PS-F shows ca. 14% enhancement of its absorption coefficient compared with that of the copolymer PBTA-PS (0.738 × 105vs. 0.648 × 105 M−1 cm−1). It can be clearly seen that the 0–0 peak of PBTA-PS-F at 576 nm is greatly increased compared to that of the non-fluorinated copolymer PBTA-PS, which indicates that the fluorinated terpolymer model introduced into the molecules strengthens the π–π stacking and thus drives the polymer to self-assemble into ordered aggregates in CB solution.

To further explore the aggregation degrees of the polymers, UV-vis absorption spectra at different temperatures were measured from 20 °C to 100 °C in CB solution (Fig. 3). Obviously, the inter-chain aggregation of PBTA-PS was broken up, while the thermal stacking morphology of PBTA-PS-F was more stable than that of PBTA-PS as the temperature increased. The 0–0 peak of PBTA-PS showed a consecutive momentum and declined from 20 °C to 100 °C; finally, the absorbance shoulder almost disappeared, indicating a more random aggregation trend between the inter-chains with variation in temperature. In contrast, the shoulder peaks of PBTA-PS-F suffered slight declines and finally remained constant, which is compelling evidence that more energetic π–π intermolecular interactions occur in the fluorinated terpolymer; also, the existence of BDTPSF segments could effectively regulate the aggregation degree and absorption in comparison with those of the copolymer PBTA-PS. This indicates that non-covalent forces such as π–π stacking (terpolymer) and dipole–dipole interactions (fluorine atoms) can be utilized to effect intermolecular interactions; these forces through supramolecular chemistry are stronger than those of molecule–solvent interactions, which prefer to aggregate and thus can result in strong aggregation. Furthermore, two-dimension grazing incidence X-ray (2D-GIXD) was used to investigate the crystalline properties of the pristine films of the polymers (Fig. S4†). From the out-of-plane profiles, the PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F films show similar (010) peaks at ∼q = 1.72 Å−1 and 1.75 Å−1, corresponding to π−π stacking spacings of d = 3.65 Å and 3.59 Å; this indicates that the fluorinated terpolymer PBTA-PS-F had tighter stacking (z direction) and preferred to adopt a face-on orientation in the neat film. This result is in accordance with the inferences from the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to calculate the energy levels of the two polymers (Fig. S2a†); the HOMO/LUMO levels of PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F are −5.37/−3.43 eV and −5.48/−3.53 eV, respectively (Table 1). A deeper HOMO energy level of PBTA-PS-F was measured in contrast to its counterpart polymer, PBTA-PS; however, it can still provide sufficient driving force for efficient exciton separation. In addition, the low-lying HOMO energy level will lead to great improvement of the open-circuit voltage in non-fullerene devices.28 Benefiting from the strong electron-withdrawing properties and negligible steric hindrance of fluorine atom, when it is attached on the main conjugated backbone (acceptor unit), the HOMO energy level of PBTA-PS will decrease. In parallel, the additional two fluorine atoms decorated on the extended side chains have more intense effects on decreasing the HOMO energy level of the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F.
Photovoltaic device properties
To obtain an intuitive understanding of the photovoltaic properties of the D1(0.5)–A–D2(0.5)–A model terpolymer, conventional spin-coated devices with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/PDINO/Al were fabricated. To obtain full spectral absorption in the active layer, the light-absorbed limited donor polymer (visible spectrum) must be complemented with a strong, broad absorption acceptor in the near-infrared region. A narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor, ITIC, was used to obtain a large JSC. The optimization process of the PSC devices is provided in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and power conversion efficiencies of the PSC devices based on the two polymers with different processing conditions are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The PBTA-PS:ITIC-based device displayed a PCE of 11.72%, with a VOC of 0.93 V, a JSC of 17.67 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.34%. The counterpart fluorinated terpolymer PBTA-PS-F showed a superior PCE of 13.48% with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 18.46 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.29% under the optimal conditions. The terpolymer PBTA-PS-F shows greatly improved photovoltaic performance compared to the non-fluorinated copolymer PBTA-PS; an obvious enhancement of the PCEs which was calculated to be about 15% was obtained under similar processing conditions.

PBTA-PS-F displayed better device performance in D1(0.5)–A–D2(0.5)–A terpolymer mode; the corresponding higher VOC of 0.97 V than of PBTA-PS may originate from the fluorinated moiety attached on the polymer chain, which can lower the HOMO energy levels. The improved JSC and FF of the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F are attributed to the higher absorption coefficient and more favorable molecular stacking orientation compared to the PBTA-PS-based device. As far as we know, the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F-based device showed one of the best performances of random copolymer-based PSCs reported to date (Fig. 4c). To guarantee the accuracy of the measured JSC, the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured and are shown in Fig. 4b.
It is worth mentioning that all the polymers exhibited well-reflected spectral responses over a wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm, in agreement with the corresponding absorption spectra of the blend films. Moreover, the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F-based device showed progressively increasing EQE values over the whole wavelength region compared to the counterpart PBTA-PS-based device, which is beneficial for producing a higher JSC value. The integrated current densities calculated from the EQE measurements are 17.09 and 18.17 mA cm−2 for PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F, respectively; this result correlates well with the JSC values measured from the solar cell devices within 5% error, which indicates that the photovoltaic results are reliable.
Morphological, charge transport and molecular dynamics analysis
Although high efficiencies were attained with the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F, the structure–property relationships of these two copolymers remained unclear. It is well established that optimized molecular structures and energy levels between the donor and acceptor as well as intermolecular interactions play crucial roles in the (1) surface and interior morphologies, (2) molecular stacking orientations, (3) generation of excitons, (4) charge transport properties, (5) charge recombination behaviors, (6) exciton and polaron kinetics, and (7) electron transfer at the D/A interface. We wished to determine how the introduction of fluorine atoms and terpolymers utilized in this work effectively enhanced the intermolecular interactions (D/A) so as to optimize the active layer morphology, charge transport and, finally, the PCEs of the PSCs.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are the most direct and efficacious methods used to investigate the surfaces and interior morphologies of the two polymer-based blend films. From Fig. 5a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 0.94 nm and 0.91 nm for the PBTA-PS (PBTA-PS-F):ITIC-based devices, respectively; the similar RMS values indicate that both polymers exhibit uniform and smooth surface morphologies. As shown in the TEM images in Fig. 5, the blend film of PBTA-PS was well mixed and uniformly distributed in the whole film, which contributes to the relatively good miscibility between PBTA-PS and ITIC. In contrast, for the PBTA-PS-F-based blend film, it was found that the aggregation was more intense compared to that of the PBTA-PS-based blend film. For the PBTA-PS-F-based blend film, appropriate aggregation and highly ordered crystallization are favorable for forming desirable phase separation; this can facilitate efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus yielding a higher JSC and FF (Fig. 6).29

For both polymers, the molecular stacking orientations in the pristine and blend films were illustrated by employing two-dimension grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD). The pristine film of the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F shows a strong ordered lamellar structure with a (100) diffraction peak at 0.23 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of d = 27.3 Å in the in-plane (Qxy) direction. The π–π stacking is highly face-on at 1.75 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction (Qz), which corresponds to a distance of d = 3.59 Å. After mixing with the acceptor ITIC, the blend film exhibits a preferential face-on orientation with a π–π peak concentrated at Qz ≈ 1.78 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to a distance of d = 3.53 Å. Obviously, the blend film exhibits a much more broad and intense (010) diffraction peak compared to the pristine film. It is interesting that the presence of ITIC could promote crystallization and facilitate ordered stacking of the polymer segments and acceptor. Improved crystallinity of the blend film as well as better-defined phase separation will lead to higher electron and hole mobilities and better FF for the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC-based device, which is consistent with the photovoltaic properties of the PBTA-PS-F-based device.30
The dipole moment from the ground state to the excited state (Δμge) is a key parameter to evaluate the charge separation kinetics in the active layer. A larger value of Δμge has a positive effect in organic photovoltaic materials; thus, a longer electron–hole separation distance and a weaker coulombic attraction and exciton binding energy can be obtained, which benefits exciton dissociation.31 Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to calculate Δμge to evaluate the photovoltaic character of the two polymers. As shown in Table 3, the Δμge values of the two repeating units in the polymers PBTA-PS-F and PBTA-PS were calculated to account for the changes of the dipole moment along each coordinate axis, as follows:Δμge = [(μgx − μex)2 + (μgy − μey)2 + (μgz − μez)2]1/2

The calculated results indicated that the repeating units in the polymer PBTA-PS-F have a larger Δμge (1.84 D) than that of PBTA-PS (0.27 D). The larger Δμge value could effectively lower the Coulomb binding energy of the exciton in the excited state and lead to fast charge separation kinetics.32 As a consequence, efficient charge dissociation and suppressed geminate recombination were obtained in the active layer of PBTA-PS-F:ITIC, resulting in an outstanding PCE (13.48%) with a large JSC and a high FF (over 75%).
As shown in Fig. S5,† we investigated the charge transport properties of the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) about the polymer:ITIC blend films via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.33 The hole mobility was measured with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, and the electron mobility was measured with an electron-only device structure, ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al. The electron mobilities calculated from the optimal devices of PBTA-PS:ITIC and PBTA-PS-F:ITIC are 3.22 × 10−4 and 3.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the hole mobilities were estimated to be 2.01 × 10−4 and 4.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The corresponding ratios of μh/μe were 0.62 and 1.14 for the PBTA-PS:ITIC and PBTA-PS-F:ITIC blends, respectively. This result indicates that the blend film of the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F has higher hole mobility and more balanced charge carrier transport than the copolymer PBTA-PS-based device. Therefore, high JSC and FF values were observed in the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC-based device.
Charge recombination behavior is a key parameter for charge yield in the nanoscale active layer. To explore this behaviors of the two polymer-based devices, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity (P) was measured and is displayed in Fig. S6.† In general, the relationship between JSC and the incident light intensity (P) can be represented by the power-law equation JSC ∝ Pα, where P is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor, and the power-law exponent α approaching 1 indicates that almost all dissociated free carriers are collected at the corresponding electrodes without charge recombination.34,35 As shown in Fig. S6a,† both of the optimized devices showed linear relationships, with slopes of 0.93 for PBTA-PS:ITIC and 0.98 for PBTA-PS-F:ITIC. This is because nearly all dissociated free carriers are collected without charge recombination in the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC-based device. The relationship between the photocurrent (Jph) and the effective applied voltage (Veff) was employed to further analyze the charge generation, transport and extraction for the PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F-based devices. Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JD and JL represent the current density in the dark and under illumination, respectively. The effective voltage was calculated as Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage.36 As shown in Fig. S6b,† the Jph of both devices reaches its saturation value (Jsat) at a low Veff, with Jsat values of 18.59 and 18.84 mA cm−2, respectively. This result indicates the low dependence of the internal electric field in the devices, which can improve the exciton dissociation and charge collection capacity. In general, the Jph/Jsat ratio is defined by the overall efficiencies of the exciton and charge collections. Under the same conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratio of the copolymer PBTA-PS-based device is 95%, while that of the fluorinated terpolymer is 98%; this suggests that the fluorinated terpolymer model in the backbone of the main polymer is necessary to improve the charge extraction and suppress the hole and electron recombination, thus leading to improved JSC and FF.
In addition to the above tests, we employed ultrafast (sub-30 fs) pump–probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the exciton and polaron kinetics of the polymers in the ground state and excited state in both the neat and blend films. TA spectra customarily comprise two main features: a ground state bleach signature (GSB, negative ΔA) and an excited state absorption signature (ESA, positive ΔA). First, we performed ultrafast TA measurements in the neat PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F pristine films. As shown in Fig. 7, the absorption modulation (ΔA/A) spectra were collected at different delay times excited under 400 nm. The spectra of both the PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F polymers exhibited negative GSB signals in the range of 500 to 610 nm, with peaks located at 533 and 580 nm, respectively. These GSB bands correspond with the static absorption spectra of the materials, which can be ascribed to the filling effect of singlet excitons excited by the pump pulse. The singlet exciton-induced ESA bands of PBTA-PS and PBTA-PS-F span a range of 650 to 750 nm, with extended polaron absorption (PA) spectra at 850 to 1000 nm. As we observed, in the case of the neat PBTA-PS film at ∼0.1 ps, the intensity of GSB is nearly 27 mOD, and the corresponding ESA and PA are ∼30 mOD and ∼6 mOD, respectively. For the neat PBTA-PS-F film, the intensity of GSB is nearly 58 mOD and the corresponding ESA and PA are ∼35 mOD and ∼20 mOD, respectively. The correlative characteristic peak intensity of the fluorinated terpolymer PBTA-PS-F is higher than that of the counterpart copolymer PBTA-PS (the two films were tested under the same conditions with consistent film thicknesses). These results indicate that the exciton concentration of the initial transient signals is higher in the PBTA-PS-F film, which is consistent with the PL signals in the neat polymers (Fig. S7†). Also, the photophysics results are identical to the DFT-calculated Δμge values. A larger Δμge value can effectively lower the Coulomb binding energy of the exciton in the excited state, which leads to faster charge separation kinetics. This can be beneficial to achieve a higher PCE. Then, TA measurements (pumped at 400 nm) were used to characterize the ΔA/A signals in the PBTA-PS:ITIC and PBTA-PS-F:ITIC blend films. Compared with the PBTA-PS:ITIC blend film, the terpolymer PBTA-PS-F:ITIC film acquired disparate spectra with initial ΔA/A characteristics, which is analogous to the superposition of the transient signals. The GSB signal of the neat ITIC film appeared at 710 nm (probed at 710 nm)37 when the PBTA-PS:ITIC blend film was probed at the same peak position, which lasted for a very short time (≈0.1 ps, beyond the resolution of the system); meanwhile, it disappeared completely in the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC film. After blending the acceptor ITIC with the polymer donor PBTA-PS or PBTA-PS-F, the ESA signal of the neat polymer PBTA-PS in the PBTA-PS:ITIC blend film persisted for a very short time of 4.95 ps. The ESA signal disappeared in the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC film; then, a characteristic GSB signal was probed spanning from 630 to 720 nm, which matched well with the GSB signal of pure ITIC. This implies that more efficient charge transfer occurred within the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC film. All the above photophysics results indicate that the electron transfer rate at the interface of PBTA-PS-F:ITIC is extremely fast38 and exceeded the temporal resolution of the pump–probe system. Thus, better performance was obtained in the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC-based device. In brief, our results show that the fluorinated model terpolymer PBTA-PS-F has better performance than the copolymer PBTA-PS.

Conclusions
Two types of polymers, a fluorinated terpolymer (PBTA-PS-F) and non-fluorinated copolymer (PBTA-PS), were designed. Compared to the copolymer, the fluorinated terpolymer PBTA-PS-F has a deeper HOMO energy level with no change in the optical bandgap. In the pristine films and blended films, PBTA-PS-F exhibited ordered molecular packing and preferential face-on orientation. This fluorinated model terpolymer could effectively lower the Coulomb binding energy of the exciton, leading to faster charge separation kinetics. In the PBTA-PS-F:ITIC blend film, TA measurements showed ultrafast electron transfer at the fluorinated D/A interface. As a result, the optimized PBTA-PS-F:ITIC PSCs device yielded a higher PCE of 13.48% than that based on the copolymer PBTA-PS (PCE = 11.72%). Our study proves that introducing a fluorinated donor as a crystalline modulator to construct a D1–A–D2–A model terpolymer can be an excellent molecular design strategy to further guide the future of high-performance photovoltaic polymers.
