    , Accepted 23rd July 2021First published on 26th July 2021AbstractIn recent years, the nickel oxide (NiOx)-based planar p–i–n perovskite solar cell (PSC) has progressed rapidly. Nevertheless, poor electrical properties of NiOx, unoptimized band alignment between NiOx and perovskites, as well as pervasive defects and unwanted chemical redox reactions at NiOx/perovskite interfaces have severely limited the device efficiency and stability. It is of particular interest to explore a facile approach to address these issues simultaneously. Herein, an effective carbon-quantum-dot-hybridized NiOx (CQD-hybridized NiOx) hole transport layer (HTL) is fabricated via hybridizing a kind of environmentally friendly CQD with NiOx. By virtue of the rich surface polar groups of CQDs, hybridization of such CQDs with NiOx can efficaciously upgrade the electrical properties of NiOx HTLs, thereby reducing ohmic loss and energy level offset at NiOx/perovskite interfaces. Meanwhile, the application of CQD-hybridized NiOx HTLs can boost the nucleation and growth of perovskite layers, thus suppressing the formation of interfacial defects/traps and reducing interface-mediated nonradiative recombination losses. Moreover, such CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL can also diminish redox reactions at the NiOx/perovskite interface, improving interface stability. Based on this CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL, a champion PCE of 20.53% with enhanced stability has been achieved. More strikingly, the optimized device delivers a Voc as high as 1.16 V, the highest Voc for CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs based on NiOx HTLs as far as we know. These results demonstrate that CQD-hybridized NiOx HTLs will be a promising candidate for efficient and stable planar p–i–n PSCs.
1. Introduction
Owing to the low processing cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have revolutionized photovoltaic technologies. The superior photovoltaic performance of PSCs is primarily ascribed to outstanding properties of metal-halide perovskites, including tunable bandgap, high light absorption, superior carrier transport, simple fabrication process and so on.1–4 So far, the certified PCE of 25.5% has already been achieved.5 As one of the most important device structures of PSCs, planar p–i–n devices have gained widespread attention because of their advantages of low cost, uncomplicated device architecture, low hysteresis, and excellent compatibility with tandem solar cells.6–10
In the planar p–i–n PSC, an efficient hole transport layer (HTL) plays a critical role to improve photovoltaic performance.9 Up to now, organic and inorganic HTLs are usually used in planar p–i–n PSCs. In comparison with organic HTLs,11–13 inorganic HTLs have drawn particular research interests thanks to the excellent stability, p-type conductive characteristics and facile solution processing. In particular, on account of the favorable energy alignment with the perovskite active layers, easy preparation and high chemical stability, the nickel oxide (NiOx) HTL has been popularly adopted in the planar p–i–n PSCs.14–18 Despite these impressive advantages, as an excellent HTL material, NiOx still faces many issues: (i) intrinsically low electrical conductivity of NiOx, (ii) unoptimized band alignment between NiOx and perovskites, and (iii) the presence of a large number of defects at perovskite/NiOx interfaces. Besides, like many other oxides (e.g. ZnO and TiO2), unwanted chemical redox reactions always occur at perovskite/NiOx interfaces. All these issues will deteriorate device efficiency and long-term stability, especially accounting for the low open-circuit voltage (Voc). To address these issues, various strategies have been adopted, mainly including doping or co-doping with metal ions,18–22 surface modification of NiOx HTLs using polymers, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) or alkali halides,15,23–26 as well as applying the hybrid Mg-organic (MgO(R)) interlayer27 or incorporating excessive A-site cations into the perovskite precursor solutions.17 Through these considerable efforts, a PCE of up to 23.07% has been achieved for planar p–i–n PSCs based on NiOx HTLs.28 Despite the encouraging progress, there is still a great challenge to mitigate these drawbacks simultaneously with a facile approach.
Currently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), a kind of nearly spherical carbon nanoparticle with the diameter in the range of 1–10 nm, have been extensively applied in several fields, such as catalysis,29 photovoltaics30–32 and light-emitting diodes (LEDs),33–35 mainly owing to their novel optical characteristics, outstanding charge transfer rate, rich surface functional groups, good dispersion in solvents, as well as nontoxicity.36 In addition, in comparison with many other environmentally friendly QDs with rich surface polar groups (e.g. InP,37,38 ZnSe QDs,39 and so on), CQDs possess supreme moisture resistance ability, as well as mature and facile synthetic protocols.36 In particular, CQDs can be prepared from green and low-cost nature carbon sources (e.g. leaves,40Solanum tuberosum,41etc.).42 Benefiting from the above excellent merits, the employment of CQDs in PSCs has drawn particular attention and it has been reported that CQDs can be successfully used as additives, interface modifiers or charge transport materials to passivate grain boundaries, facilitate charge extraction, and boost the crystal growth of perovskite films.43–45 In particular, during the preparation of this manuscript, Kim and co-workers have reported that the incorporation of CQDs in NiOx HTLs can improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, although the device only showcases a moderate Voc of 1.10 V.46 Thus, the application of CQDs in the NiOx HTL will be a promising approach to fabricate an efficient HTL for PSCs.
In this contribution, a kind of environmentally friendly CQD with rich surface polar function groups, derived from green and low-cost onions as the natural carbon source, has been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and used to fabricate an efficient CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL for a planar p–i–n PSC. The hybridization of CQDs can endow the NiOx HTL with improved electrical conductivity and optimized interface energy band alignment with perovskite active layers. Importantly, it can also enable high-quality crystal nucleation and growth of perovskite films with high crystallinity and suppressed interfacial defects/traps. In addition, the unwanted redox reaction at the HTL/perovskite interface is effectively reduced. Taking advantage of the above findings, the PCE of PSCs is boosted up to 20.53% with excellent stability and a high Voc of 1.16 V, the highest Voc for the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) PSCs (Table S1, ESI†).
2. Experimental section
Preparation of NiOx
Firstly, the 5 M of aqueous solution Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%, Macklin Inc.) was magnetically stirred for 2 h. Secondly, the NaOH (99.99%, Aladdin) aqueous solution was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the solution to 10. Undergoing another 30 min stirring, the precipitate was washed three times using deionized water. After that, the washed precipitate was dried at 100 °C for 5 h. Finally, the dried precipitate is transferred into an agate mortar for calcination to obtain NiOx powder under 270 °C for 2 h.
Preparation of CQDs
CQDs were obtained using the simple hydrothermal method by using onions as the carbon source. Firstly, 4 g onions were douched and rinsed with deionized water three times and then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for heating at 120 °C for 3 h. Secondly, after the temperature cooled down, the solution was extracted at 10000 rpm for 20 min and then filtrated to obtain the CQD solution. Finally, the CQDs were obtained by freeze-drying to remove the solvent and stored at 4 °C conditions.
Preparation of NiOx and CQD-hybridized NiOx films
The obtained NiOx powder was firstly dispersed in water. Then the filtrated NiOx aqueous dispersion was spin-coated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO, 15 ohm sq−1, Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd) substrate to form the NiOx film. For the preparation of the CQD-hybridized NiOx film, different amounts of CQDs (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 wt%) were added into the NiOx nanoparticle aqueous solution, followed by spin-coating onto ITO substrates. Finally, NiOx or CQD-hybridized NiOx films were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate.
Fabrication of PSCs
ITO substrates were cleaned using the sequential mediums of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in the ultrasonic cleaner. Then, the substrates were dried by N2 flow and treated by O2 plasma for 10 min. The hole-transport layers of NiOx or CQD-hybridized NiOx films were prepared as mentioned above. PbI2 (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) and CH3NH3I (MAI, Advanced Election Technology Co.) were dissolved in a 4:1 volume ratio (v/v) mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 1.2 M. After being stirred for 12 h, 45 μL of the perovskite precursor was added dropwise on the substrate and spin-coated at 3500 rpm with a 5 s acceleration time for 30 s. 200 μL chlorobenzene was added dropwise in the last 20 s. Subsequently, the film was transferred onto the hot plate and annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. Thereafter, the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was deposited on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by spin-coating of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, Aladdin) in methanol solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s. In the end, the 200 nm silver electrode was obtained in a vacuum chamber (<1 × 10−4 Pa). The active area was 0.115 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology and particle size of CQDs were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-FEM 2100F). Surface functional groups of CQDs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS50). The steady state photoluminescence (PL) and PL lifetime of the samples were measured using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Surface topographies were recorded using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Corporation) and field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss). The electrical conductivity and surface potential of the samples were measured using conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) with PeakForce mode with a Pt/Ir coated tip, respectively. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the samples were obtained by UV-vis spectrophotometer (LAMBDA750, PerkinElmer, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D-XRD) of the films was measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα1 (1.54060 Å) and a HyPix-3000 2D hybrid pixel array detector. The J–V curves of the devices were performed by the Agilent B2901A precision source using a solar simulator (AM 1.5G light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2) and the scan rate was set at 0.01 V s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was evaluated with QE-R (Enlitech, Taiwan) in DC mode in air. The AXIS-ULTRA DLD spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to analyze the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of the samples. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were performed by the photoelectron spectrometer (PHIQUANTERA-II SXM). The photo-induced transient photovoltage (TPV) was characterized using a light-emitting diode (LED, 520 nm) controlled by a programmable power supply. The devices were soaked under 1 sun illumination and the light perturbation pulses nanosecond PTI GL-3300 nitrogen laser was applied to perturb the open-circuited devices. The dropped voltage signals were collected by an oscilloscope Yokogawa DLM2052. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained by an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT3, AMETEK) with a 0.8 V potential at a frequency from 1 Hz to 106 Hz and the oscillation potential amplitude at 10 mV in the dark at 25 °C. The electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT30) was applied to record the capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves under the voltage range from 0 to 1.5 V with 0.05 V s−1 scan rate under dark and room temperature conditions. The voltage perturbation and frequency were 20 mV rms and 10 kHz, respectively. The devices were placed in an electromagnetic shielding box.
3. Results and discussion
In our work, environmentally friendly CQDs are synthesized by using green onions as the natural carbon source via the hydrothermal method according to the literature.47 The TEM image of CQDs dispersed in deionized water demonstrates the monodisperse spherical characteristics with an average diameter of 10 nm (Fig. 1a). Surface group species of CQDs are detected using FTIR (Fig. 1b). The broad peak at around 3430 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of O–H and N–H.48 The presence of the CO stretching from COOH of CQDs can be identified by the peak at 1626 cm−1.49 The stretching vibrations of C–N, C–C and CC are detected at 1288 cm−1, 1383 cm−1 and 1533 cm−1, respectively. It can be concluded that there exist many polar functional groups, mainly including hydroxyl, carbonyl and amidogen, on the surface of CQDs, which can endow CQDs with good stability in aqueous solutions. In addition, CQDs exhibit the typical excitation-dependent PL behavior, further confirming the presence of rich surface groups of CQDs, which introduce trap states with different energy levels (Fig. 1c).50,51 More interestingly, hybridization of such CQDs with NiOx can effectively improve the dispersion and stability of NiOx nanoparticles in the aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the CQD-hybridized NiOx sample exhibits more homogeneous dispersion in deionized water compared to the pristine NiOx sample. Moreover, the CQD-hybridized NiOx aqueous solution, which is prepared by directly adding CQDs into the NiOx nanoparticle aqueous solution, can be stored for 10 days with no obvious precipitation, showing excellent stability (Fig. 1d). Such CQD-hybridized NiOx nanoparticle aqueous solution with superior dispersion and stability will be beneficial to prepare smooth and compact films for scalable device fabrication.

The effect of CQD hybridization on the properties of NiOx films is investigated by adding various amounts of CQDs (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 wt%) into the NiOx nanoparticle aqueous solutions, which are denoted as C0-NiOx, C1-NiOx, C3-NiOx, and C5-NiOx, respectively. FE-SEM and AFM are performed to observe the film surface morphologies (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Each film is continuous, dense and flawless. The surface root mean square (RMS) is 9.87, 8.38, 6.12 and 7.86 nm for the C0-NiOx, C1-NiOx, C3-NiOx, and C5-NiOx, respectively. Apparently, in comparison with C0-NiOx, CQD-hybridized NiOx films exhibit a more uniform and smoother surface, which will favor the complete and conformal coverage of the NiOx layer and the high-quality growth of the above perovskite films, preventing interfacial recombination. Moreover, the light transmittance and crystal structure of NiOx films hybridized with various CQD contents are measured using UV-vis absorption spectra and XRD. As shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), regardless of the CQD content, all films coated on SiO2 glass exhibit high transmission ranging from 320 to 800 nm, which will minimize the light losses in planar p–i–n PSCs. Meanwhile, no obvious change is observed for the band-gap of NiOx films due to the hybridization of CQDs (inset of Fig. S2b, ESI†). Similarly, the XRD patterns of all films are almost the same (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The results indicate that the hybridization of CQDs will not change the optical properties and crystal structure of NiOx films.
Then, CQDs-hybridized NiOx films are employed as the HTLs in the planar p–i–n devices with the configuration of ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, in which all layers are fabricated via spin-coating except for the Ag electrodes. And the concentration of CQDs in NiOx is optimized by scrutinizing the effect on the PSC performance. J–V curves of the best-performing PSCs based on different HTLs are shown in Fig. 2a. Corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The C0-NiOx device achieves a PCE of 18.27% with a Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2, an FF of 79%, and a Voc of 1.11 V. Upon applying CQDs-hybridized NiOx HTLs, the device photovoltaic performance can be effectively improved, especially for the C3-NiOx case, which acquires a PCE of 20.53% with a Jsc of 21.87 mA cm−2, an FF of 81%, and in particular, an impressively high Voc of 1.16 V. It is noteworthy that applying CQD-hybridized NiOx HTLs can significantly boost the device photovoltage. Despite the fact that the PCE decreases to 19.96% when further increasing the ratio of CQDs (i.e. C5-NiOx case), it is primarily ascribed to the decreases of both Jsc and FF, whereas the high Voc (1.15 V) remains. With regard to the reported planar p–i–n CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs with NiOx HTLs, the Voc values are usually below 1.16 V (see Table S1, ESI†). Thus, as far as we know, the highest Voc is achieved for CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs based on NiOx HTLs in our present work. Moreover, the calculated series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are also listed Table 1. Noticeably, the C3-NiOx device exhibits the smallest Rs and largest Rsh among all devices. As we know, Rs is related to the ohmic loss and Rsh is associated with the defects and current leakage.52 Hence, the small Rs and large Rsh of the C3-NiOx device indicate lower ohmic loss and current leakage induced by defects. Furthermore, EQE spectra, along with the integrated Jsc, of the best-performing devices with different HTLs are shown in Fig. 2b. In comparison with the C0-NiOx device, a stronger spectral response ranging from 300 to 800 nm can be found for CQD-hybridized devices. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectra is 19.45, 19.82, 21.02 and 20.01 mA cm−2 for the C0-NiOx, C1-NiOx, C3-NiOx and C5-NiOx devices, respectively, in accordance with the value from J–V curves, further verifying the excellent performance of the devices based on the CQDs-hybridized NiOx HTLs. The above results suggest that the optimized concentration of CQDs is 3 wt% (i.e. C3-NiOx case), which is chosen for further discussion.

The hysteresis behaviors of devices with C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx HTLs are investigated. The J–V curves in forward and reverse scan directions for the best-performing PSCs with C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx HTLs are presented in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. The C0-NiOx device shows more obvious hysteresis with a hysteresis index (HI) of 8.21% according to the equation: hysteresis index = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse. On the contrary, HI is reduced to be 2.23% for the C3-NiOx device, suggesting the healing of serious hysteresis behavior via the use of CQD-hybridized NiOx HTLs. Subsequently, the statistical distribution of the PCE values obtained from C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx PSCs (30 PSCs per condition) is illustrated in Fig. 2e. The C3-NiOx device shows an average PCE of 19.90%, which is higher than the C0-NiOx device. Meanwhile, the data in the box-plot for the C3-NiOx device displays the close distribution, confirming the improvement of PCE and reproducibility of PSCs induced by CQD-hybridized NiOx HTLs. In addition, to verify the device reliability under illumination, we have plotted the stabilized photocurrent for C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices (Fig. 2f). The champion C3-NiOx device exhibits a relatively superior stabilized current density (20.70 mA cm−2) at the Vmpo of 0.95 V, exhibiting the stabilized PCE of 19.66%. However, the C0-NiOx PSC only shows the stabilized PCE of 16.61% with a low stabilized current density (18.46 mA cm−2) at the Vmpo of 0.90 V. Additionally, the electroluminescence (EL) performance is a useful metric for photovoltaic device characterization.53 Thus, the EL spectra and EQE–current density curves of the C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices are measured by operating as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) under a voltage bias in the dark (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both devices show the emission peak at 769 nm, while compared to the C0-NiOx device, the C3-NiOx device exhibits much more intensified EL (Fig. S3a, ESI†) and considerably improved EQE (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Apparently, the CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL can enable planar p–i–n PSCs with improved photovoltaic performance, especially boosting Voc.
To ascertain the underlying mechanism of the improved photovoltaic performance induced by the application of the CQDs-hybridized NiOx HTL, we first measure the electrical conductivity of C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx films using c-AFM and the captured corresponding images are showcased in Fig. 3a and b. Observably, compared with the C0-NiOx film, the C3-NiOx film exhibits a higher current signal. Subsequently, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method is employed to calculate the hole mobility of C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx films via fitting J–V curves of hole-only devices (Fig. 3c) according to the Mott–Gurney eqn (1): (1)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric permittivity of NiOx, J is the current density, μ is the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage of devices and L is the thickness of the C0-NiOx or C3-NiOx films. The hole mobility of the C3-NiOx film is calculated to be 4.15 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of the C0-NiOx film (1.68 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). Evidently, the enhanced hole mobility can be acquired in the CQD-hybridized NiOx film. In the quest for probing how CQDs affect the electrical performance of NiOx films, XPS measurements are performed to reveal interactions between NiOx and CQDs. High-resolution C 1s XPS spectra for both samples (Fig. 3d) all show three peaks centered at 284.8 eV, 286.3 eV and 288.2 eV, corresponding to C–C, C–O and CO bonding configurations, respectively.54 Compared to the C0-NiOx film, the C3-NiOx film showcases stronger C–O and CO peaks, indicating the existence of CQDs in the NiOx film. The presence of CQDs can also be confirmed by FTIR results (Fig. S4, ESI†). The typical stretching vibrations originated from the surface polar functional groups of CQDs also appear in the NiOx film hybridized with CQDs. As shown in Fig. 3e, Ni 2p3/2 peaks are split into two peaks. One peak centered at lower binding energy is ascribed to Ni2+, whereas another is attributed to the Ni-vacancy-induced Ni3+.25,55 The calculated Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of the C3-NiOx film (1.135) is higher than that of the C0-NiOx film (0.998), further manifested by the O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3f). It is well-known that Ni3+ in NiOx acts as an acceptor, which can lead to better p-type behavior.49 Thus, a higher Ni3+ ratio in CQD-hybridized NiOx films favors the improvement of electrical properties.50 At the same time, upon hybridization with CQDs, a shift to the lower binding energy of 0.3 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 peaks can be observed. The relative position shift can infer that CQDs may be chemically bound to NiOx nanoparticles and the charge transfer from NiOx to CQDs occurs, which will lead to the increase of hole concentration in the valence band of NiOx and is beneficial for boosting the hole conductivity of NiOx.56 Evidently, there exists an interaction between NiOx and CQDs, which will result in an impressive increase in the conductivity of NiOx films. Such improved electrical properties will promote hole transfer, as well as reduce ohmic loss and charge accumulation at HTL/perovskite interfaces, accounting for the improved PSC performance and suppressed hysteresis.

To investigate how CQDs influence the energy level of NiOx, SKPM is adopted to measure the film surface potentials and corresponding images are displayed in Fig. 4a and b. The surface potential of the C3-NiOx film obviously decreases, representing the increase of work function (WF). Plus, a more uniform surface potential distribution can be observed in the C3-NiOx film. The increase in WF for the C3-NiOx film also can be observed from UPS measurements (Fig. 4c). Upon hybridization with CQDs, the WF increases from 4.81 eV for C0-NiOx to 5.07 eV for C3-NiOx. Correspondingly, the valence band (VB) increases from 5.22 eV for C0-NiOx to 5.34 eV for C3-NiOx. As depicted in Fig. 4d, the increased WF and VB induced by the hybridization of CQDs will lower the energy loss at the NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, optimizing interfacial energy alignment and facilitating efficient hole extraction.

Generally, the crystal growth behavior of the perovskite film is greatly influenced by the properties of HTLs in planar p–i–n PSCs. For this sake, we prepare thin (40–70 nm) and thick (∼495 nm) CH3NH3PbI3 films on C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx using 0.12 M and 1.2 M precursor solutions, which are expected to represent the interfacial and bulk properties, respectively. Fig. 5a and b display the top-view SEM images of the thin (inset) and thick CH3NH3PbI3 films on C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx, respectively. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM images for all samples are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Both thick CH3NH3PbI3 films are continuous, smooth and dense, showing the polycrystalline film feature. However, a larger average grain size can be obtained for the CH3NH3PbI3 film on C3-NiOx (Fig. 5a, b and Fig. S5c, d, ESI†). More interestingly, different HTLs pose an important impact on the interface crystal growth of perovskite films. A great number of pinholes are found in the thin CH3NH3PbI3 film on C0-NiOx (inset of Fig. 5a), exhibiting poor coverage. Conversely, an obvious decrease in the number of pinholes with increased surface coverage is observed in the thin CH3NH3PbI3 on C3-NiOx (inset of Fig. 5b and Fig. S5b, ESI†). Moreover, the thick perovskite film on C3-NiOx shows decreased randomly oriented grains compared to that on C0-NiOx (Fig. S5c and d, ESI†). Thus, the CQD-hybridized NiOx film can facilitate the perovskite nucleation and growth, mainly profiting from the rich surface polar functional groups of CQDs and smoother surface induced by CQD hybridization. The crystallinity of the thin and thick CH3NH3PbI3 films on C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx is further analyzed via XRD measurements (Fig. 5c). Typical XRD peaks of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 are detected for all samples, including (110), (112), (220) and (310) crystal plane diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 20.1°, 28.5° and 32.0°, respectively. Observably, whether the thin or thick perovskite films, the CH3NH3PbI3 films on C3-NiOx all present narrower full width at half-maximum (FWHM) for the (110) peak and higher intensity ratio of (110) to (310), in comparison with those on C0-NiOx (Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, 2D-XRD is also carried out to confirm the more preferential (110) crystal orientation of the perovskite films on C3-NiOx in comparison with those on C0-NiOx (Fig. 5d). Clearly, the crystallinity and preferred orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 films can be boosted via the application of the CQD-hybridized NiOx film, which is in accordance with the SEM results. Accordingly, higher optical absorption can be obtained for the thick CH3NH3PbI3 film on C3-NiOx, primarily owing to the improved perovskite crystal quality induced by the CQD-hybridized NiOx film (Fig. S6). To gain a more distinct understanding of the difference in the crystal nucleation of perovskite films on both HTLs, we have analyzed the interfacial characterizations by performing XPS measurements for thin CH3NH3PbI3 films on C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx. As shown in Fig. 5e, there are two main peaks corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 in the high-resolution Pb 4f XPS spectra of both perovskite films. Notably, an obvious shift to higher binding energy can be observed for the Pb 4f peaks of the thin perovskite film on C0-NiOx. It has been reported that such a shift reveals the poor perovskite crystal growth with massive defects.57 Therefore, it can be inferred that the CQD-hybridized NiOx film can boost the nucleation and growth of perovskites by effectively suppressing interfacial defects, which will be helpful for the charge transport and extraction at perovskite/HTL interfaces.

To scrutinize how the CQD-hybridized NiOx film influences the carrier transport, extraction and recombination properties in devices, a series of optical and electrical analyses are conducted. Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) are performed to characterize carrier transfer/recombination dynamics. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), a remarkable decrease in PL intensity can be observed upon applying C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx films compared to the PL emission of the perovskite film on glass, exhibiting interfacial charge transfer across the perovskite/HTL. Such an improvement in hole extraction at the perovskite/C3-NiOx can also be assessed using TRPL (Fig. 6a). The average PL lifetime of the perovskite film on glass is 73.31 ns, which is reduced to 23.92 ns and 9.21 ns for the C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx HTLs, respectively, further demonstrating that the CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL can accelerate the hole extraction process. For a deeper investigation on the carrier recombination lifetime in completed devices, transient photovoltage decay of C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices are conducted (Fig. 6b). The decay lifetime of transient photovoltage is 229 μs and 460 μs for C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx PSCs, respectively. The longer carrier recombination lifetime indicates that the charge recombination process is actually slowed down at the perovskite/C3-NiOx interface, which will lower interfacial recombination losses, in accordance with the results of PL and TRPL. Meanwhile, the light-intensity-dependent Voc and Jsc characteristics of C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices are recorded (Fig. 6c and d). Theoretically, the ideality factor (n) can be derived from the slope of Voc as a function of light intensity, which reflects the level of trap-assisted recombination.58 And the light intensity-dependent Jsc curve is expressed as eqn (2): JSC ∝ Iα(2)where I is light intensity and α is the exponential factor. In general, when the radiative recombination pathway is dominant, n and α are closer to 1. If not, then the trap-assisted carrier recombination is dominant. The calculated n value decreases from 1.42 for the C0-NiOx PSC to 1.29 for the C3-NiOx PSC, whereas the α value increases from 0.873 (C0-NiOx device) to 0.924 (C3-NiOx device), which demonstrates that the trap-induced carrier recombination is substantially suppressed in the C3-NiOx device, signifying an increase in Voc. Furthermore, the interfacial charge-transport behaviors are characterized by measuring the capacitance–voltage (C–V) for the C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx based PSCs. Fig. 6e illustrates the C−2–V plots of both devices on the basis of Mott–Schottky law (3):59 (3)where Vbi is the built-in potential, A is the device area, Voc is the applied bias, C is the capacitance, and N is the free carrier concentration. The Vbi value of the C3-NiOx device is 1.13 V, higher than that of the C0-NiOx device (0.96 V). Correspondingly, the calculated N values are increased from 4.13 × 1016 cm−3 for the C0-NiOx PSC to 2.46 × 1017 cm−3 for the C3-NiOx PSC. The enhanced Vbi and N values for the C3-NiOx device imply that the CQD-hybridized NiOx HTL can reduce carrier recombination loss and promote hole extraction, contributing to the sharp increase of Voc in the C3-NiOx PSC. In addition, the charge transfer kinetics in both PSCs can be evaluated via EIS measurements. Fig. 6f displays the Nyquist plots from EIS for both devices. As reported, the low-frequency region indicates the interfacial recombination resistance.60 The larger Rrec (2020 Ω) of the C3-NiOx PSC is found compared with Rrec (1422 Ω) of C0-NiOx PSC, revealing that the C3-NiOx HTL can suppress charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL. Collectively, the application of CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTLs can virtually boost the charge transport and diminish carrier recombination at the perovskite/HTL, mainly due to the improved electrical conductivity, the optimized interface energy alignment and suppressed interfacial defects, accounting for the marked improvement in Voc and photovoltaic performance.

As a kind of p-type oxide semiconductor, undesirable chemical interaction always inevitably happens at the perovskite/NiOx interfaces due to the catalytic activity of NiOx,61 which will cause the decomposition of perovskites at interfaces and thereby is detrimental to device performance and stability.62,63 We then set out to assess whether the CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL can address this issue. First, we observed the “noncapacitive hysteresis” phenomenon, an identification of the electrochemical reaction between p-type HTLs and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, by determining the J–V curves in the dark (from 1.1 to −0.1 V for reverse scan and from −0.1 to 1.1 V for the forward scan at the 5 mV s−1 scan rate) for the C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices according to the literature.51Fig. 7a shows the recorded J–V curves of C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx PSCs. Distinctly, the C0-NiOx device shows an obvious noncapacitive phenomenon, which almost disappears in the C3-NiOx device. The suppression of the noncapacitive hysteresis in C3-NiOx PSC means that the CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL can eliminate the chemical reaction between NiOx and perovskite.27 Additionally, chemical reaction at the interface of NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 mainly occurs between the NiOx film and organohalide salt.17 Therefore, theoretically, the chemical reaction between NiOx and MAI can be explored to evaluate the interfacial reaction for NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3. However, the MA (the deprotonated methylammonium, the reaction product of MA+) molecule is extremely volatile, which is difficult to be detected in the XPS measurements operated under a high vacuum. Therefore, to gain mechanism assessment of the interfacial chemical interaction, FAI (formamidinium iodide), whose chemical properties are similar to MAI, is chosen and the FAI precursor solution (i.e. FAI dissolved in DMF) is spin-coated on C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx films and the reaction products are detected using XPS measurements. Obvious change can be observed in the high-resolution N 1s and I 3d5/2 XPS spectra of both films, as illustrated in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. For the N 1s signals, the deconvoluted XPS peaks at 400.2 and 401.8 eV are assigned to FA (the deprotonated formamidinium) and FA+, respectively.64 For the I 3d5/2 signals, the binding energy of 619.5 eV and 618.6 eV represent I3− (the oxidized iodide) and I−, respectively.65 The higher ratio of FA+/FA and I−/I3− can be found in the C3-NiOx case. As is reported, the existence of FA and I3− can be ascribed to the redox reaction between NiOx and FAI.17 Based on the above analysis, it is extrapolated that the CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL can indeed alleviate the interfacial redox reaction, which will boost the interface stability and is in favor of the improvement of device stability.

In the end, the stability tests for C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices without encapsulation are carried out. The moisture stability of both PSCs is first tested under 50% relative humidity (RH) at 25 °C in the dark. Normalized PCE variation curves are exhibited in Fig. 7d. The C3-NiOx PSC can maintain about 82% of the initial efficiency after 30 days. On the contrary, for the C0-NiOx PSC, the PCE reduces to 25% of the original value under the same conditions. Subsequently, the thermal stability of the C0-NiOx and C3-NiOx devices is evaluated, which is performed at 85 °C in the glove box in the dark. After 288 h storage at 85 °C, the C3-NiOx PSC can retain 97% PCE of its original value. On the contrary, the C0-NiOx PSC only retains 82% PCE of its initial value (Fig. 7e). Finally, we compare the light stability of the C3-NiOx device with that of the C3-NiOx device under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination in the glove box at 25 °C. As expected, the C3-NiOx device shows better stability in the light soaking experiment, which only suffers 7% PCE loss in 200 min. These results manifest the superior moisture, thermal and light stabilities of PSCs with CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTLs, which is mainly ascribed to higher crystalline quality of perovskite films, suppressed interfacial defect/trap formation and the eliminated chemical reaction at the NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 interface induced by the hybridization of CQDs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL is developed to boost the photovoltaic performance of planar p–i–n PSCs. Benefiting from the rich polar groups on the surface of CQDs, this CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL has been proved to exhibit higher electrical conductivity and optimized energy band alignment with perovskites in comparison with the pristine NiOx HTL. Simultaneously, employing such CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL can promote crystal nucleation and growth of perovskite films, along with the diminishment of the redox reaction at the NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. In the light of the above merits, a champion efficiency of 20.53% is achieved with a Voc as high as 1.16 V, the highest Voc for the CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs based on NiOx HTLs as far as we know. Additionally, the PSC with the CQD-hybridized-NiOx HTL shows negligible hysteresis and superior moisture, thermal and light stabilities. This work offers a facile hybrid approach to fabricate efficient HTLs for planar p–i–n PSCs.
