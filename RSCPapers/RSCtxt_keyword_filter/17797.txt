    , Accepted 21st March 2014First published on 25th March 2014AbstractFast electron transport, large specific surface area, and slow interfacial electron recombination are indispensable features for efficient photoelectrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) with advanced architecture of high surface-to-volume ratio and open-up geometry for providing direct electron/ion transport channels is applied on a flexible photoanode in this study. Because several micrometers of semiconductor are required for the diffusion of electrons, which are surrounded by electron acceptors at a distance of only several nanometers, a wide band gap barrier layer of Y2O3 is coated on TNT to retard back-transfer of electrons to the electrolyte or to the oxidized dye molecules by electrodepositing Y(OH)3 on the TNT surfaces and subsequently annealing the samples. By adjusting the charge capacity for Y(OH)3 electrodeposition, the charge recombination dynamics in the pertinent DSSC can be easily controlled. This barrier layer also enhances dye adsorption and therefore increases the volume of the optically active component due to the more basic surface of Y2O3 for more carboxyl groups in a dye molecule adsorbing onto the surface. A higher light-to-power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.52% is obtained for the pertinent DSSC compared with a reference cell with non-coated TNT (η = 5.35%), exhibiting an enhancement of 22% in η.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been researched extensively since their first innovative report in 1991.1 The challenging issues that remain are achieving high light-to-power conversion efficiency (η) and pursuing easy and low-cost manufacturing techniques. Flexible DSSCs with photoanodes composed of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) have attracted much attention because of the possibility of roll-to-roll production and features such as high surface-to-volume ratio and open-up geometry for TNT to provide higher dye-loading amounts and direct electron/ion transport channels.2–5 Nakayama et al. applied TNT as an underlayer in photoanodes to raise the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs.6 Xu et al. prepared a bilayered film with TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) and TNT as the underlayer and the overlayer, respectively, on the photoanode to realize rapid electron transfer.7 We have previously prepared a flexible photoanode with TNT as the underlayer and TNP as the overlayer on Ti foils to produce 1D electron transfer paths at the interface between the Ti foil and TNP.8 To further improve electron transfer and minimize electron–hole recombination, surface modification of TiO2 with other metal oxides, such as SrO,9 Nb2O3,10 SrTiO3,11 ZnO,12 and MgO,13 has been studied for several years.9–19 The coated metal oxides allow the photoinjected electrons to tunnel through the TiO2 core and subsequently to the conducting substrate oxide layer. Simultaneously, the coated metal oxides form an energy barrier for the recombination reactions of the injected electrons from the TiO2 core to the triiodide ions in the electrolyte, in addition to the oxidized dye molecules. This process is energetically favourable only if the conduction band of the coated metal oxides lies above both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the sensitizer and the conduction band edge of the TiO2 core.16 In addition, the surface of the metal oxide coating is often more basic, leading to higher adsorption of carboxyl groups in dye molecules and therefore to a higher volume of optically active components. Guillén et al. developed a multistep wet-chemistry route to obtain ZnO nanowire arrays coated by a ZnO nanocrystalline layer. Decreased recombination rate and improved photovoltage were obtained for the pertinent cells.20 Gao et al. fabricated SnO2/TiO2 core–shell DSSCs to obtain fast and efficient charge collection. An η of 5.11% was obtained for the core–shell DSSCs, which is about five times higher than that of the SnO2 nanotube-based DSSCs (η = 0.99%).21 Chen et al. fabricated a TNT film filled with TNP coated by a thin SrO layer and obtained an η of 5.39% for the pertinent DSSC.22 Lee et al. prepared porous TiO2 films coated with ZrO2 or Nb2O5 thin layers and reported reduced charge injection and back-electron transfer rates for the pertinent DSSCs compared with those of the cell with a bare TiO2 film.23 In this study, flexible photoanodes were prepared by anodizing Ti foils to obtain TNT on the surfaces. The TNT length was optimized in consideration of the electron transport and the specific surface area for dye adsorption. It is well known that the insulating yttrium oxide (Y2O3) has attractive features, including high-κ dielectrical value, a wide bandgap energy of 6 eV, a relatively high dielectric constant, high thermal stability, and low leakage current.24–26 Therefore, to further reduce the interfacial electron recombination, Y(OH)3 was electrodeposited on TNT, and the resulting film was subsequently annealed to obtain a thin Y2O3 barrier layer on the surface of the TNT. The charge recombination dynamics in the pertinent DSSC can be easily controlled via adjusting the charge capacity for Y(OH)3 electrodeposition. In addition, the more basic surface of Y2O3 is favourable for the carboxyl groups in sensitizer adsorbing to increase the dye adsorption. A better η of 6.52% was achieved for the DSSC with Y2O3-coated TNT (Y-TNT) on a Ti foil as the photoanode, with reference to that of a cell with TNT (5.35%). The Y-TNT film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves, and laser-induced photo-potential transients were utilized to substantiate the explanations.
Experimental section
Materials
Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetical grade) and iodine (I2, synthetical grade) were obtained from Merck. tert-Butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were obtained from Acros. Neutral cleaner, isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%) and yttrium nitride (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) were obtained from Aldrich. 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was obtained from Fluka. Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F, A. C. S. reagent) were obtained from J. T. Baker. Ethylene glycol (EG, extra pure) was obtained from Scharlau. 1-Propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) was obtained from Solaronix. The organic solvent electrolyte contains a mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in a solvent of 50 vol% MPN and 50 vol% ACN.
Preparation of photoanode/Pt counter electrode and cell assembly
Ti foils (0.4 mm thick, 99.8% purity, Fuu Cherng Co. Ltd., Taiwan) were polished to remove residual metal oxides and other adhesive substances and were sequentially cleaned with a neutral cleaner, deionized water (DI water), acetone, and IPA. Highly ordered TNT was prepared on Ti foils using an anodization method.8,27,28 The anodization process was conducted at a constant applied potential of 50 V at room temperature in an electrolyte consisting of 0.25 wt% NH4F and 1.0 wt% H2O in ethylene glycol (EG). The anodized sample sheet was ultrasonically cleaned in DI water for 1 min to remove the surface debris. Y(OH)3 was then electrodeposited on TNT using a conventional three-electrode cell in a 0.01 M Y(NO3)3 solution at deposition charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2 (eqn (1)). The potential of the working electrode was fixed at −1.2 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. TNT film without the electrodeposition of Y(OH)3 was used for the comparative purposes. TNT films with and without Y(OH)3 electrodeposition were gradually heated to a temperature of 500 °C in an oxygen atmosphere and were subsequently annealed at the same temperature for 1 h. Then, the Y(OH)3 layer coated on TNT was changed to a Y2O3 thin layer after annealing (eqn (2)). Y(NO3)3 + 3H2O → Y(OH)3 + 3HNO3(1) 4Y(OH)3 + 3O2 → 2Y2O3 + 12OH−(2)
After annealing and cooling to room temperature, a portion (0.4 × 0.4 cm2) of the resulting films was selected as the active area by removing the side portions carefully. These active films were immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of (Ru[(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine)(Ligand-11)(NCS)2]) (CYC-B11)29 in a solvent mixture of ACN and tBA (volume ratio of 1:1) at room temperature for 24 h; 20 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, ≥95%) was used as a co-adsorbent along with the dye. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was then coupled with a transparent Pt counter electrode. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering Pt on an ITO glass (ITO, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm, Uni-onward Corp., Taiwan, <7 Ω sq−1), which was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with DI water, acetone, and IPA. The sputtering was carried out for 5 s under a sputter current of 40 mA, which was the optimized condition according to our previous study,30 in consideration of the catalytic ability of Pt and its transmittance for back-illuminated DSSC. The two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm-thick gasket made of ionomer Surlyn (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) that was sealed by heating. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity.
Measurements
The DSSCs were illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) from the side of Pt/ITO (back-illumination), and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The crystalline phase and the chemical bonding state of the films of TNT and Y-TNT were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD, MO3XHF, MAC) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Theta Probe, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK), respectively. Surface morphologies of TNT films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias potential was set at the open-circuit potential of the DSSC, between the Pt counter electrode and the photoanode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model.31,32 Pulsed laser excitation was applied by a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (model Quanta-Ray GCR-3-10, Spectra-Physics laser) with a 2 Hz repetition rate at 532 nm, and a 7 ns pulse width at half-height. The average electron lifetime could be approximately estimated by fitting a decay of the open-circuit potential transient with exp(−tτe−1), where t is time and τe is the average time constant before recombination. IPCE curves were obtained at the short-circuit condition. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was moved in steps through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE(λ) as defined in eqn (3): (3)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instruments, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instruments, model 70310).
Results and discussion
Characteristics of yttrium oxide modified TiO2 nanotube arrays
Prior to deposition of yttrium oxides on the TNT electrode, the performance of the DSSCs with bare TNT photoanodes was optimized by varying the anodization time for growing TNTs. The optimization results are described in the ESI.† The best performance of the TNT-based DSSCs was obtained with 50 V and 240 min as the anodization voltage and period, respectively. Hence, for the following works, TNT was prepared under these optimal conditions.
In order to further reduce the interfacial electron recombination, post-treatment was performed with a thin barrier layer of Y2O3 coated on TNT. Fig. 1(a)–(d) show the SEM images of Y-TNT with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2, respectively. The wall thickness of the TNT slightly increases with increasing charge capacity for electrodepositing Y(OH)3 before annealing, indicating the formation of Y2O3 thin film on TNT. The wall thickness of Y-TNT with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2 were estimated to be 27, 37, 43, and 50 nm, respectively, which are larger than that of the TNT, i.e., 20 nm, as shown in the ESI.† Furthermore, the crystalline phases of the TNT and Y-TNT films were examined by XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2. Peaks corresponding to (101), (103), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (118) of the TiO2 structure associated with the anatase phase are observed in this figure for all the XRD patterns,33,34 indicating the TNT and Y-TNT are crystallized in a pure anatase phase. The peaks of Ti foil substrate are also present in this figure; however, no obvious peaks were found for Y2O3 in the case of Y-TNT. It is presumed that the Y2O3 film was too thin to be detected; therefore, EDX was applied to further investigate the composition of Y-TNT. Fig. 3(a) and (b) illustrate the EDX data of Y-TNT and TNT, respectively. Ti and O peaks are shown found in both Fig. 3(a) and (b), whereas the Y peak is observed only in Fig. 3(a), indicating the existence of yttrium element on TNT in the case of Y-TNT. In addition, the formation of Y2O3 was verified by XPS. The Y 3d and Ti 2p core-level XPS spectra of Y-TNT annealed at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. Oxide Y 3d peaks located around 161 and 159 eV, respectively, for Y 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 characterized for Y2O3 are shown in Fig. 4(a), whereas TiO2 features at 458.9 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and at 464.5 eV for Ti 2p1/2 in Fig. 4(b) reveal the presence of TiO2 in Y-TNT.35

Photovoltaic performance and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells with Y2O3-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays

Fig. 5 shows J–V curves of the DSSCs with TNT and Y-TNT obtained with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the DSSCs with Y-TNTs show higher VOC, compared with those of the cell with TNT. These increases in VOC are due to energy barrier at the interface between Y-TNT and the electrolyte or the oxidized sensitizer enabled by the presence of Y2O3, which has a higher conduction band edge by about 3.2 V; i.e., the conduction band edges of TiO2 and Y2O3 are −0.20 V and −2.58 V, respectively, vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE),36–39 as shown in Scheme 1. This energy barrier reduces the back-electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to triiodide ions or oxidized sensitizers. Moreover, with the increase in charge capacity for the deposition of Y(OH)3, i.e., with the increase of Y2O3 amount on TNT, the VOC increases considerably, indicating a more efficient reduction for the back-electron transfer with thicker Y2O3 layers.11 It is also successfully confirmed that by simply adjusting the charge capacity for Y(OH)3 electrodeposition on TNT, the charge recombination dynamics can be easily controlled. On the other hand, JSC increases with an increase in charge capacity up to 15 mC cm−2 and decreases with further increases in charge capacity. It was reported by Kay and Grätzel that Y2O3 is more basic than TiO2, i.e., the pzc are pH 9 and pH 6.2 for Y2O3 and TiO2, respectively.14 The surface of Y-TNT should be more basic than the individual structure of TiO2; thus, more acidic dye molecules can adsorb on the surface, leading to higher JSC.14 However, JSC decreases with further increases in the charge capacity for Y(OH)3 electrodeposition, i.e., 20 and 25 mC cm−2. This result may be ascribed to the significant tunnelling barrier in the case of thick Y2O3 layers, which would inhibit the electron transferring from the dye to TiO2. The best η of 6.52% was achieved for DSSC with Y-TNT obtained with a charge capacity of 15 mC cm−2, whereas the cell with TNT shows an η of only 5.35%. Fig. 5 also illustrates the current density–voltage curves of the DSSCs with TNT and Y-TNT obtained with the charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2 measured in dark. The onsets of the dark current densities for the DSSCs with Y-TNT obtained with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2 occur at 0.56, 0.59, 0.60, 0.61, and 0.54 V, respectively. These values were obtained by drawing tangent lines to the curves, starting from the potential scale, and a zero current line to the same curves and by measuring the potentials that correspond to the intersection points of the tangent lines with the zero current line. The onset of the dark current for the DSSC with TNT occurs at the lowest forward bias, indicating a more significant charge recombination in this case, whereas the forward bias for the onset of the dark current of the DSSCs with Y-TNT increases with an increase in charge capacity. These results also confirm that the charge recombination can be reduced with more Y2O3 deposition. All the onset potentials of the cells measured in dark are consist with their VOC values.

 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the energy levels of a core–shell structure on the photoelectrode in DSSCs. 

Fig. 6 shows IPCE curves of the DSSCs with TNT and Y-TNT obtained with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2. The maximum efficiency at the wavelength of 580 nm coincides with the absorption maximum wavelength of CYC-B11 dye. The IPCE for the DSSC with Y-TNTs (15 mC cm−2) at 580 nm is 89.71%, which is higher than that of the DSSC with TNT (79.43%). Moreover, the IPCE over the entire wavelength region of 400 nm to 800 nm exhibited a higher value for the former case, resulting from the more basic surface of Y-TNT for more dye adsorption, which enabled more electrons to be excited. All the IPCE values at 580 nm are consistent with the JSC value of the cells.

Transient photovoltage curves of dye-sensitized solar cells with Y2O3-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays
Transient photovoltage curves were obtained to estimate average electron lifetimes of the DSSCs with TNT and Y-TNT obtained with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7. The average electron lifetimes could approximately be estimated by fitting a decay of the open-circuit potential transient with exp(−tτe−1), where t is time and τe is an average time constant before recombination. The τe values of 13.18, 24.41, 30.65, 38.77, and 46.69 ms are obtained for the photoanodes with TNT and Y-TNT with charge capacities of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mC cm−2, respectively. The longer electron lifetime for the Y-TNT-based DSSCs is due to the Y2O3 barrier layer that inhibits back-transfer of electrons from TiO2 to triiodide ions. Moreover, the increasing electron lifetime for the photoanode with a thicker Y2O3 barrier layer also confirms that the charge recombination dynamics can be easily controlled by varying the charge capacity for electrodepositing Y(OH)3 and can be reduced with Y2O3 on the TNT surface. The longer electron lifetimes are consistent with the higher VOC value of the corresponding cells.

Conclusions
TNT obtained on Ti foils exhibits a nearly constant diameter and increasing length for longer anodization periods. The VOC value decreases and the JSC value increases for DSSCs with longer anodization periods to obtain TNT on the photoanode due to the increasing longer electron diffusion path and larger surface area. However, the JSC value decreases for the anodization period of 300 min due to significant recombination. Thin layers of Y(OH)3 were electrodeposited on TNT and the films were subsequently annealed to obtain the Y2O3 barrier layers to reduce the charge recombination. Higher VOC values were found for the Y-TNT-based DSSCs compared with those of the cell with TNT, demonstrating the reduced recombination for the former cases with the help of Y2O3 barrier layers. Moreover, the VOC value increases considerably with an increase in the amount of Y2O3 on the TNT, indicating that charge recombination dynamics can be simply controlled by adjusting the charge capacity for Y(OH)3 electrodeposition. The JSC value increases with an increase in charge capacity to deposit Y(OH)3 up to 15 mC cm−2 and decreases with further increases in the charge capacity. This result is attributed to the more basic surface of Y2O3 for more dye adsorption in addition to significant electron transfer inhibition for higher charge capacity. The best η of 6.52% was achieved for the Y-TNT-based DSSC with a charge capacity of 15 mC cm−2, whereas the cell with TNT shows an η of 5.35%. The tendency of VOC is consistent with the dark current and the electron lifetime, whereas the IPCE values show the same trend with the JSC value for all of the cells.
