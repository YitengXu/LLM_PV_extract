    , Accepted 7th December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractSeries-connected tandem organic photovoltaic devices (SCTOPVs) have been shown to provide higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than the single junction devices due to the improved light harvesting. To achieve the optimal device performance of SCTOPVs, balancing the photocurrents generated from the sub-cells is critical according to the Kirchhoff law. In this work, we demonstrate that the out-of-cell capping layer of an ITO-free microcavity SCTOPV plays an important role in manipulating the optical field distribution in the constituent sub-cells for achieving balanced photocurrents and optimal photovoltaic performance. Two mirror-like electrodes, a semi-transparent ultrathin Ag capped with a dielectric TeO2 layer and a thick Ag electrode were used to construct an ITO-free top-illuminated microcavity configuration, in which certain frequencies of solar irradiance can resonate between the reflective surfaces. As a result, a top-illuminated ITO-free SCTOPV with a comparable performance (7.4%) to the ITO-based counterpart (7.5%) was demonstrated despite the inferior transmittance of the ultra-thin Ag relative to ITO.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic devices that can efficiently convert solar radiation into electrical power have been investigated worldwide as a possible solution for sustainable energy source.1 Among all solar energy conversion techniques that have been exploited so far, organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are one of the important focuses due to their good mechanical flexibility, light-weight, and low-cost.2,3 However, for practical applications, further improvements in their device performance and reduction in production cost are critical.
Thus far, most state-of-the-art OPVs are fabricated with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures,4,5 which typically consist of an electron donor polymer blended with an electron acceptor. Limited by the low carrier mobility and high exciton binding energy of organic materials, the optimized BHJ layer thickness is usually restricted to ∼100 nm, which is not sufficient to fully absorb the solar irradiation.4 This coupled with its narrowband absorption feature thereby results in a significant transmittance loss.6 One possible approach to improve light-harvesting efficiency is to develop multi-junction tandem configurations, which are typically series-connected to prolong the light travelling pathways and to take advantage of complementary absorption from the constituent sub-cells.3,6,7
For the series-connected tandem OPVs (SCTOPVs), it is essential to obtain balanced short circuit current density (JSC) between the sub-cells for achieving the maximum power output (namely, maximum efficiency) according to the Kirchhoff law, provided that the JSC of a tandem device is governed by the smallest value of the constituent sub-cell.8 In this regard, complementary absorbing materials in different sub-cells9 or optical manipulation techniques,10 such as the plasmonic effect11 and micro-cavity effect,12 have been extensively utilized to achieve the balanced JSCs between the sub-cells for maximizing the photovoltaic performance of SCTOPVs.
Most recently, using optical micro-cavities in single junction OPVs has been found to be an effective approach to modulate the light confinement and optical field distribution in the devices.13–15 The micro-cavity configuration is generally composed of two mirror-like electrodes, such as Ag, where the resonant light would oscillate in between until fully absorbed by the photoactive materials. Although the reflective ultra-thin Ag would cause reflection loss at the light in-coming side, the conjunction with a high refractive index capping layer, like tellurium oxide (TeO2, n ∼ 2.2), can effectively suppress it and increase the light in-coupling into the device.13,16 In principle, the compromise between the reflection loss and micro-cavity enhancement determines the efficacy of this resonant cavity. It is worthy to note that the micro-cavity based devices can feature adjustable optical field distribution within their micro-cavity chambers through the careful control of the thickness of each constituent interlayer, including the capping layer, ultra-thin Ag layer, and photoactive layer.13,15–17 Therefore, the integration of the micro-cavity chamber into a tandem device can simultaneously enhance light-trapping and manipulate optical field distribution in each sub-cell for better photo-current matching. More importantly, this micro-cavity configuration can afford the ITO-free advantage, making itself more cost-effective and compatible with large-area, roll-to-roll processing. Nonetheless, this device structure is still not so commonly employed so far.18
In this work, we demonstrate a highly efficient polymer tandem solar cell based on an ITO free, micro-cavity structure (Fig. 1). Ultra-thin Ag capped with a 30 nm TeO2 thin layer was used as the transparent electrode in this structure. The device structures of ITO- and ultra-thin Ag-based tandem solar cells are shown in Fig. 1a–b, respectively. BHJ layers with complementary absorption spectra were chosen in the studied tandem architectures, where poly(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-difluoro-quinoxaline) (PIDTT-DFQT): [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) served as the BHJ of the front sub-cell while the poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-fluoro-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDT-FBT):PC71BM19,20 was used as the BHJ of the back sub-cell (Fig. 1c).

Two sub-cells were electrically series-connected via the interconnection layer (ICL) consisting of a poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/ZnO composite film. It is unveiled that the optical field distribution within each sub-cell of the ITO-based SCTOPV is not ideal, although the high transmittance of ITO allows a large portion of solar irradiation to enter the device. The solar irradiation is intensively localized in the back sub-cell and resulted in severe optical loss, leading to mismatched JSC between each sub-cell. However, for the micro-cavity based SCTOPV, the JSC of each sub-cell is more balanced and enhanced light-trapping in BHJ layers can be accomplished by fine-tuning the thickness of the employed capping layer. As a result, the JSC of the micro-cavity based device is comparable to that of the ITO-based device regardless of the inferior transmittance of ultra-thin Ag relative to ITO. Finally, an ITO-free SCTOPV with a high PCE of ∼7.4% was successfully demonstrated which is comparable to that of the ITO-based counterpart. Considering the low-cost and better mechanical properties of ultra-thin Ag, this work provides a new device architecture for making highly efficient printable SCTOPVs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Optical simulation
In order to evaluate and investigate the individual contribution of each layer within the device upon optical absorption, optical simulations based on the transfer matrix formalism (TMF) are used to calculate the interference of reflected and transmitted light at each interface within the stratified devices. The wavelength-dependent optical properties of each layer are represented by the index of refraction (ñ = n + ik) of each material, acquired by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). All the simulations are based on the assumptions of planar interfaces and total isotropy for all layers. However, the interference within the glass substrates is ignored because their thicknesses (2 mm) are much higher than the wavelengths of the simulated incident beams. The C60-self assembly monolayer (C60-SAM) is also ignored due to the ultra-thin thickness. For each device structure, the optical simulation adopts exactly the same layer thickness as those used in practical device fabrication. In addition, 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the AM1.5 intensity spectrum (ASTM G173-03) are assumed to calculate the theoretically maximum photocurrent density. In order to compensate the deviation resulting from the 100% IQE assumption, mismatch factors of 0.95 and 0.61 are applied to the PIDTT-DFQT and PCPDT-FBT based single junction solar cells. The mismatch factor of the PIDTT-DFQT based solar cell was obtained according to the fact that the measured JSC is 11.4 mA cm−2 and the calculated JSC is 12.1 mA cm−2 in single junction devices. At the same time, the measured JSC of single junction PCPDT-FBT based devices is 14.2 mA cm−2 while the calculated JSC is 23.6 mA cm−2.
2.2 Fabrication of ITO based tandem devices
ITO glass substrates were cleaned with deionised water, acetone, and iso-propanol in an ultra-sonic bath. After treating with plasma for 15 min, ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated in a glovebox and annealed in air at 130 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, C60-SAM was spin-coated on ZnO. PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM solution (1:4 wt%, o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), 3% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) was spin-coated at 800 rpm to form a ∼100 nm film (calibrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM)). After annealing at 110 °C for 5 min, the films were spin-coated with modified PEDOT:PSS in ambient air and annealed at 150 °C for 5 min. After that, highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) was spin-coated at 5 krpm and annealed in a glove-box at 150 °C for 5 min. The low modified PEDOT:PSS (4083) is used to extract the hole and block the electron from the bottom cell. The high conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) is used to form respectable electric contact to enable efficient electron/hole recombination from the sub-cells. Since these two PEDOT:PSS layers are deposited sequentially, possible intermixing between them is expected to occur. In this regard, we consider these two PEDOT:PSS layers as a whole. Following that, ZnO was spin-coated and annealed at 130 °C for 5 min in a glove-box to form a 20 nm film and assembled with mono-layer C60-SAM. PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM solution (1:2.5 wt%, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 21 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 900 rpm for 5 min and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, the substrates were transferred into a vacuum chamber to deposit 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag.
2.3 Fabrication of ITO-free micro-cavity devices
Glass substrates were cleaned with the same procedure as ITO glass. After treating in air plasma for 15 min, patterned Ag was deposited. After assembling with mono-layer 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), 20 nm ZnO and C60-SAM layers were deposited as mentioned in previous procedures. On the top of these substrates, 80 nm PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM, ICL (m-PEDOT:PSS/PEDOT:PSS-PH 1000/ZnO/C60-SAM) and 100 nm PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM films were deposited sequentially following the previous procedures. Finally, 10 nm ultra-thin Ag was deposited to complete device B and additional 30 nm TeO2 was deposited to complete device E.
2.4 Device characterization
The J–V characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon arc solar simulator with an AM 1.5 global filter operating at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate the AM 1.5 G solar irradiation for the J–V measurements. The illumination intensity was corrected by using a silicon photodiode with a KG5 color filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
2.5 Materials
All the materials are from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., and used as received without specification. The PCBM is from American Dye Corp. and the donor materials and C60-SAM in this work are home-made.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Single junction devices
To efficiently utilize solar irradiation, two conjugated polymers with complementary absorption spectra, PIDTT-DFQT21 and PCPDT-FBT,19 were used as the polymer donors in BHJ layers in this study. Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM and PCPDT-FBT:PC71M films. The PIDTT-DFQT based BHJ has an absorption band edge of ∼700 nm while the PCPDT-FBT based BHJ can absorb light up to ∼870 nm. In the tandem device structure, the higher energy photons were primarily absorbed by the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM front cell to generate large VOC, while the transmitted lower energy photons were further absorbed by the low band-gap PCPDT-FBT:PC71M back sub-cell. In such a sequence, the thermalization loss of “hot excitons” generated by higher energy photons can be effectively reduced, which is beneficial to achieve the maximum open circuit voltage (VOC) and performance of STCOPVs.

The evaluation and optimization of the single junction devices, e.g. BHJ thicknesses and interfacial layers, are critical to the photovoltaic performance of the derived SCTOPV. Therefore, single junction solar cells (device structure: ITO/ZnO/C60-SAM/BHJ/MoO3/Ag, defined as device A) were fabricated. Note that a C60-SAM layer was used to passivate ZnO surface traps and enhance the electronic coupling between ZnO and the BHJ layer.22 The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices measured under AM1.5 illumination are shown in Fig. 2b and S1,† and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. It was clearly shown the optimized PCE is achieved at a particular BHJ thickness due to the compromise between JSC and fill factors (FF) of both PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM and PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM devices. This is consistent with the prior statement that a thicker BHJ layer tends to encounter severe bimolecular charge recombination due to the space charge effect and that a thinner layer causes severe optical loss and leakage current.23

At the optimized BHJ thickness, the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM single junction device exhibited a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 11.17 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.64, and a PCE of 6.54% while the PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM device showed a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 14.12 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.60, and a PCE of 6.17%. The high VOC (0.91 V) shown in the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM device indicates its capability to reduce the thermalization loss and serve as an efficient front sub-cell in a SCTOPV. The EQE spectra of the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM device between 300 and 700 nm show a maximum value of 68%, contributing to an integrated JSC of 10.6 mA cm−2 while the EQE spectra of the PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM device between 300 and 870 nm exhibit a maximum value of 55%, leading to an integrated JSC of 13.3 mA cm−2. The complementary EQE spectra shown by these two devices, consistent with their absorption spectra (Fig. 2a), are important to achieve balanced JSC in sub-cells for SCTOPVs.
3.2 Single junction micro-cavity devices
Adopting the micro-cavity configuration in the device has been demonstrated as an effective light confinement strategy for improving the photo to electron response in single junction OPVs. To gain more insight into the micro-cavity based architecture, we have further fabricated single junction micro-cavity devices based on the configuration of glass/Ag/ZnO/C60-SAM/BHJ/MoO3/ultra-thin Ag/TeO2, referred to as device B. The optical micro-cavity chambers were formed due to the high reflectivity of the transparent ultra-thin Ag and the opaque Ag back electrode. Optical simulation was conducted to realize the optical field distribution and JSC of the devices24 (see the Experimental Section for the detailed information on optical simulation). It was assumed that the absorbed photons are fully converted into electrons in simulation, namely 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Fig. 3 shows the dependence between the JSC of device B and various thicknesses of the capping layer, BHJ layer, and ultra-thin Ag layer, (Fig. 3a–c, PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM based device; Fig. 3d–f, PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM based device). As shown, the maximum JSC of PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM devices could be achieved using a 70 nm thick BHJ layer with a 30 nm thick capping TeO2 and a 14 nm thick Ag. For the PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM system, the thickness of the BHJ layer, TeO2, and Ag for achieving optimal JSC is 80 nm, 40 nm, and 10 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Variation of JSC of the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM single junction device with: (a) thickness of the BHJ layer and transparent Ag layer, while fixing the capping layer at 30 nm, (b) thickness of the capping layer and BHJ layer, while fixing the ultra-thin Ag at 14 nm, (c) thickness of the Ag layer and the capping layer, while fixing the BHJ layer at 70 nm. Variation of JSC of the PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM single junction device with: (d) thickness of the BHJ layer and transparent Ag layer, while fixing the capping layer at 40 nm, (e) thickness of the capping layer and BHJ layer, while fixing the ultra-thin Ag at 10 nm, (f) thickness of the Ag layer and the capping layer, while fixing the BHJ layer at 80 nm. 
Here, we take the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM based device as a model to study the properties of the optical micro-cavity structure. Different to the ITO based transparent electrode, the ultra-thin Ag film is highly reflective. When the ultra-thin Ag layer was used as the transparent electrode, the high reflectivity of Ag would induce severe surface reflection loss. On the other hand, the introduction of an optical micro-cavity will significantly improve light-trapping. Increasing the thickness of this Ag layer will strengthen both effects. Fig. S2† shows the dependence of the Ag layer thickness on light intensity distribution and the simulated EQE spectra of PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM based micro-cavity devices (device B). With a 8 nm thick Ag, the simulated EQE resembles the absorption spectra of the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM film.
The effect of micro-cavities becomes stronger when the Ag thickness increases. As a result, the light absorption between 550 and 700 nm becomes stronger. However, the reflection loss from the non-resonant light also becomes significant when the thickness of the Ag layer is increased. Severe optical reflection loss is induced in wavelengths between 350 and 500 nm. As a result of balance between reflection loss and enhanced light-trapping, the highest JSC could be achieved at an optimal Ag thickness of 14 nm for PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM devices and 10 nm for the PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM devices, respectively. The variations of optimal Ag thickness for PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM and PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM devices stem from their different absorption profiles. In general, the combined thickness of BHJ and interfacial layers determines the oscillating wavelengths in the micro-cavity chamber. Fig. S3† shows the relationship between the light intensity distribution and BHJ thickness, and the simulated EQE spectra of PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM micro-cavity devices (device B). If the BHJ thickness is increased, the resonant light wavelengths will be red-shifted. For BHJ layers with distinct absorption profiles, different oscillating wavelengths are required in order to maximize the effect of light-trapping in the micro-cavity chamber, which determines the corresponding optimized BHJ thickness. This explains the observation of differently optimal BHJ thickness in PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM (70 nm) and PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM (80 nm).
Based on eqn S1–S5 in the ESI,† a capping TeO2 layer was deposited on the top of Ag to reduce the reflection loss at the light incoming side. The light intensity distribution of the micro-cavity based device with various TeO2 thicknesses is illustrated in Fig. S4.† As shown, without TeO2, the reflectivity of Ag is strong and the light intensity distribution is concentrated in the region between 550 and 700 nm, which corresponds well with the absorption peak at 630 nm in the simulated EQE. However, the device suffered a significant reflection loss in the region between 330 and 550 nm. After depositing an ultra-thin TeO2 layer (10 nm), the surface reflection loss was largely reduced, without significantly influencing the micro-cavity region (630 nm). When the TeO2 thickness was further increased, the micro-cavity induced resonance became weaker in spite of the further reduction in reflection loss. After compromising these two parameters, an optimal light utilization could be achieved if a 30–40 nm thick TeO2 capping layer was implemented for both PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM and PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM based devices to obtain the highest JSC (Fig. S4†).
Based on the optical simulations, we further fabricated the corresponding micro-cavity devices. The J–V characteristics of the single junction cells based on PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM and PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 2. The detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM micro-cavity device showed a VOC of 0.91, a JSC of 11.92 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.60, and a PCE of 6.56%, which is slightly better than that of the ITO based single junction device. Similarly, the PCPDT-DFBT:PC71BM micro-cavity device showed a better PCE (6.21%) than the ITO control device with a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 15.07 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.56.
3.3 Optical simulation of tandem devices
Optical simulation was primarily performed to evaluate the optimum conditions of the targeted tandem devices. In order to compensate the deviation between the calculated JSC and measured JSC arising from the assumption of 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE), a mismatch factor of 0.95 and 0.61 is applied to the PIDTT-DFQT and PCPDT-FBT based BHJ devices, respectively. The origin of such a mismatch factor is described in the Experimental section. In Fig. 4a–c, the green and red surfaces represent the BHJ thickness dependent JSC of the front and back sub-cells, respectively. Balanced JSC could be achieved along the cross line of the red and green surfaces. It is worthy to note that the JSC of the front sub-cell increased monotonously with the front cell's BHJ thickness while the back sub-cell showed the maximum JSC at a BHJ thickness of 70–80 nm. Fig. 4a depicts the BHJ thickness dependent JSC of the sub-cells in the ITO-based tandem solar cell (device structure shown in Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 4  The sub-cell active layer thickness dependent JSC of front and back sub-cells (green surface for the front cell and red surface for the back cell) of (a) ITO based tandem device, (b) ultra-thin Ag based top-illuminated device without a capping layer, and (c) ultra-thin Ag based top-illuminated device with a 30 nm capping layer. Light intensity distribution in (d) ITO based tandem solar cells, (e) ultra-thin Ag based tandem solar cells without a capping layer, and (f) ultra-thin Ag based tandem solar cells with 10 TeO2 as a capping layer. 
As shown, the maximum JSC could reach 8.8 mA cm−2, where the BHJ thicknesses of the front and back sub-cells were 150 and 80 nm, respectively. However, for the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM single junction cell, the increase in BHJ thickness (or the charge transporting distance) would induce severe bimolecular charge recombination due to its low carrier mobility.25 Thus, device performance would suffer a sharp drop in FF and PCE when the BHJ layer thickness is over 100 nm (Fig. S1† and Table 1). Accordingly, the optimum device performance is expected to be obtained with the front sub-cell thickness at 100 nm and back cell thickness at 80 nm, corresponding to a JSC of 7.6 mA cm−2 for the front cell and 9.3 mA cm−2 for the back cell. For the series-connected tandem solar cells, the JSC is controlled by the smaller one of the two sub-cells. Therefore, in the ITO based tandem solar cell, the maximum attainable JSC is estimated as 7.6 mA cm−2 limited by the front cell, and it creates an optical loss of 1.7 mA cm−2 for the back cell.
For the ultra-thin Ag based top-illuminated tandem solar cells without the capping layer (Fig. 4b), the maximum balanced JSC is 7.4 mA cm−2, while the BHJ thicknesses are 180 nm and 60 nm for the front and back sub-cells, respectively. Considering the optimized BHJ layer thickness (<100 nm) of the PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM device, the highest attainable JSC of this Ag based tandem solar cells without the capping layer is expected to be only 5.1 mA cm−2, where the thicknesses of the BHJ layers are 100 nm and 60 nm for the front and back sub-cells, respectively. The decrease in JSC compared to the ITO-based counterpart could be attributed to the surface reflection optical loss and unbalanced JSC between the two sub-cells. Fortunately, with the insertion of 30 nm TeO2 as a capping layer, the maximum attainable front sub-cell JSC is 7.3 mA cm−2, while the JSC of the back cell is 8.5 mA cm−2. The increase in the maximum attainable JSC of the micro-cavity tandem device could be attributed to the suppressed reflection loss at the Ag surface and the redistribution of the optical field intensity.
Apparently, similar attainable JSC relative to the ITO-based configuration but with more balanced sub-cells' JSC was obtained in the ultra-thin Ag based top-illuminated tandem device. Table S1† summarizes the simulated JSC of the front and back cells in tandem devices with different thickness of the TeO2 capping layer at fixed BHJ thicknesses in the front and back sub-cells of 100 nm and 80 nm, respectively. As shown, with the increase of the TeO2 layer, the JSC of both sub-cells increased and reached the maximum at 30 nm for the front cells and 50 nm for the back cells. This verified that the deposition of the TeO2 layer could reduce the ultra-thin Ag surface reflection loss. The JSC deviation of front and back cells also varied with the change of the capping layer thickness, suggesting the possibility of modulating the optical field distribution within the tandem device by tuning the capping layer thickness.

Fig. 4 d–f shows the optical field distribution in the tandem solar cells. In the ITO-based tandem device, the light intensity was stronger due to the higher optical transmittance of ITO substrates and was delicately located in the BHJ region. However, due to unbalanced optical field distribution in the device, the JSC of the front sub-cell cannot match that of the back sub-cell, resulting in the optical loss and imbalanced JSC. In the top-illuminated tandem cell without TeO2 capping, the optical field distribution in the tandem cell is weak due to the high reflectivity of the ultra-thin Ag layer. Moreover, the light intensity distribution is not equal in the front and back sub-cells. As a result, severe optical dissipation was created in this structure. However, through the deposition of a 30 nm TeO2 capping layer on the top of the ultra-thin Ag film, the reflection loss at the ultra-thin Ag surface was largely reduced and the optical field distribution in the two sub-cells became much balanced. With further increasing the thickness of the capping layer, the optical intensity inside the device also got enhanced, however, the center of the maximum optical intensity became gradually red-shifted (Fig. S5†). Finally, the compromise between the increased optical intensity and red-shifted maximum intensity determined that the best device performance should be achieved at 30 nm TeO2. Fig. S6† shows the simulated EQE spectra of the correspondingly constituent sub-cells. With the deposition of TeO2, the light harvesting in both sub-cells got enhanced due to the reduced reflection loss at the Ag surface and was comparable to those of the ITO-based tandem solar cells. This result further affirmed that this ultra-thin Ag based micro-cavity configuration can enable the derived tandem device having the light-harvesting efficiency as sufficient as the ITO-counterpart despite the relatively lower transmittance of the ultra-thin Ag relative to ITO.
3.4 Top-illuminated tandem solar cells
Based on the optical simulation, three types of tandem devices were fabricated accordingly with the following structures: device C: glass/ITO/ZnO/C60-SAM/PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM/m-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/C60-SAM/PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag; device D: glass/Ag/MUA-SAM/ZnO/C60-SAM/PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM/m-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/C60-SAM/PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM/MoO3/ultra-thin Ag (10 nm); device E: glass/Ag/MUA-SAM/ZnO/C60-SAM/PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM/m-PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/C60-SAM/PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM/MoO3/ultra-thin Ag (10 nm)/TeO2 (30 nm). If it is not specified, the thickness of the each layer is fixed as below: ITO: 120 nm, Ag: 100 nm, ZnO: 20 nm, PIDTT-DFQT:PC71BM: 100 nm, m-PEDOT:PSS: 40 nm, PCPDT-FBT:PC71BM: 80 nm, and MoO3: 10 nm.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of device C–E, and detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that all the VOC of the tandem solar cells were nearly the summed value of the individual single junction cells, and the J–V curve showed normal diode rectification behavior. These confirmed the efficacy of the employed ICLs. The most distinct difference of the three devices was the JSC, which is strongly dependent on the device architectures. For the ITO-based tandem devices, the high transparency of the ITO substrate allows a relatively large portion of solar irradiation to enter into the BHJ layers. Through controlling the thicknesses of constituent interlayers, the optical field can be more distributed in the BHJ layer region. As a result, device C exhibited a JSC up to 7.49 mA cm−2, which is quite close to the optical simulation results (7.6 mA cm−2). For device D, a considerable portion of light was reflected at the highly reflective ultra-thin Ag surface, and the optical loss causes a significant drop in JSC. Consequently, a JSC of ∼5.4 mA cm−2 was obtained in this structure. However, after depositing a 30 nm TeO2 capping layer, the JSC of device E significantly increased to 7.19 mA cm−2 due to both the largely reduced reflection loss at the ultra-thin Ag surface and the better balanced optical field distribution within the tandem device, consistent with the optical simulation (7.3 mA cm−2). Finally, a PCE of 7.4% comparable to that (7.5%) of ITO-based tandem solar cells was accomplished in the top-illuminated ITO free tandem solar cell.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, an ultra-thin Ag based ITO-free tandem solar cell with a micro-cavity configuration was demonstrated. Through depositing a 30 nm TeO2 capping layer on the ultra-thin Ag layer, the optical loss of the incident light at the reflective Ag surface was significantly reduced. Moreover, the optical field distribution in both sub-cells of the tandem device could also be modulated by this capping layer to result in a much balanced photocurrent between them. Finally, a PCE up to 7.4% comparable to that (7.5%) of the ITO-based counterpart was demonstrated. Due to the low cost and mechanical flexibility of ultra-thin Ag-based micro-cavity configuration, this study establishes a new feasible device architecture for the future development of efficient SCTOPVs with highly printable compatibility.
