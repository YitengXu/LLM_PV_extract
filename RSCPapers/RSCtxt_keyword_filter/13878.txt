    , Accepted 3rd February 2019First published on 6th February 2019AbstractThe search for new classes of hole transporting materials (HTMs) is a very important task on the way towards commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the synthesis and performance in PSCs of new enamine-based HTMs are presented. The synthesis scheme is very short, consisting of only one step, starting from commercially available aromatic amines. Moreover, the reaction does not require metal catalysts and is based on condensation chemistry with water as a by-product. It was shown that PSCs with such materials reach high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), with the highest PCE of 19% achieved for the V1021-based device. This work establishes enamines as a very promising class of materials for application in PSCs.
Introduction
Due to their outstanding properties, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials have shown great potential for use in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, light-emitting diodes, lasers, plasmonics, field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors.1–7 Within a few years, they have revolutionized the photovoltaic field leading to device efficiencies of more than 23%.8,9 The typical perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration consists of a multi-layered stack where the perovskite is sandwiched in between an electron-transporting layer, usually TiO2, and an organic hole-transporting material (HTM). A HTM-free device configuration has also been extensively investigated, however, it is still a subject of ongoing research and highest efficiencies of 10.49% for devices with gold electrodes10,11 and 16% for carbon electrode devices12 have been achieved. Currently, costly 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is the most widely used small molecule HTM to obtain high efficiency devices.13–15 However, the tedious synthetic procedures and purification processes of this HTM make it cost ineffective and thus limit its application and commercialization.16 Moreover, the study by Binek et al. has shown that Spiro-OMeTAD can significantly contribute to the overall cost of materials required for the manufacturing of high-performance devices.17 To engineer small molecule HTMs which are considerably cheaper than Spiro-OMeTAD, shorter reaction schemes with simple purification procedures are required. Successful examples include azomethine-18 and hydrazone-based19 HTMs, methoxydiphenylamine substituted fluorene20,21 and bifluorenylidene-based derivatives,22 spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-based materials,23–25 and methoxydiphenylamine substituted branched carbazole derivatives.26–28
Recently, we have reported a simple carbazole-based conjugated enamine named V950, which resulted in impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 17.8%29 and is comparable to the state-of-the-art material Spiro-OMeTAD in a like-to-like comparison. This new small-molecule hole conductor was prepared from commercially available 3-amino-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole in a one step synthesis without the use of expensive catalysts, column chromatography or sublimation purification, simplifying the product workup and therefore drastically reducing the preparation cost ($5.58 per gram).29
Herein, we report a synthesis of a whole series of enamine molecules based on the V950 model in order to conduct a more thorough investigation of this very promising structural concept and test the new HTMs in PSCs with the state-of-the-art perovskite composition. The influence of aliphatic substituents 9-(2-ethyl)hexyl (V1000), 9-butyl (V1013), and 9-hexyl-6-tert-butyl (V1004), and an additional enamine moiety (V1020) on the thermal, optical, and photophysical properties of HTMs bearing a carbazolyl chromophore was investigated. In addition, the enamine-based HTM V1012 bearing another, widely used for the synthesis of HTMs triphenylamine chromophore30 was synthesized and perovskite solar cells, utilizing an n-i-p mesoporous configuration with a triple-cation perovskite31 and the new HTMs, were constructed and characterized (Fig. 1).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
With the aim to investigate structural effects on the photophysical and electrical properties, as well as the performance in PSCs, a series of carbazole-based enamine derivatives V1000, V1013, V1004, and V1021 were synthesized (Scheme 1). Enamine condensation chemistry offers an extremely simple route towards extended π-conjugated molecules.32 The reaction can be performed under ambient conditions and water is the only by-product making product purification uncomplicated. A Dean–Stark trap is used to separate this water from the reaction mixture and thus the formation of the desired products is accelerated and the reaction duration reduced considerably. Initially, reactions of commercially available aromatic amino precursors 9-(2-ethyl)hexyl-, 9-butyl-, and 9-hexyl-6-tert-butyl 3-aminocarbazoles, and 4-aminotriphenylamine with 2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-acetaldehyde in the presence of (+/−) camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) were carried out and resulted in formation of the corresponding HTMs V1000, V1013, V1004, and V1012 in moderate yields (47–57%) (Scheme 1a). Column chromatography was used to isolate the above mentioned HTMs and this is the main difference of the preparation method from the one described for the model HTM V950.29 The same strategy was employed for the synthesis of the HTM possessing four enamine branches (V1021) from 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (Scheme 1b), only a double amount of 2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)acetaldehyde was used in this case. The chemical structures of the synthesized products were verified by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. All of the synthesized new enamine-based HTMs are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF, or chlorobenzene, which are typically used for deposition of the hole transporting layer in PSCs. A detailed synthesis procedure and analysis can be found in the ESI.†

Computational study
To establish the most probable molecular structure, quantum chemical simulations of V950, V1000, V1004, V1013, V1012, and V1021 were performed by means of the Gaussian 0933 package using density functional theory (DFT) method B3LYP. Optimization of the ground state geometry was done using the 6-31G(d) basis set supplemented with polarization functions (Table S2, ESI†). In Table S3 (ESI†), the dipole moments of optimized molecular structures are presented. For the materials V950, V1000, V1004, and V1013 with different aliphatic fragments, only negligible changes of the spatial orientation of the enamine-substituents take place. Generally, enamine-substituents create V-shaped spatial orientation of phenyl fragments with interfragmental angles close to 120 degrees (between the long axis of phenyl, when phenyls are non-face-to-face-oriented in pairs). Due to the possibility to obtain large conformational motion (rotating about the [N–C] junction), the definite position of fragmental substituents cannot be established. For V1012 and V1021, the same V-shaped orientation of phenyl rings is observed.
Table S4 (ESI†) gives energies of electronic excitations (S0 → Sn) and corresponding oscillator strengths fn of the V950, V1000, V1004, V1013, V1012, and V1021 compounds. Excited singlet states S1, S2, and S3 were simulated by Gaussian 09 by means of the semi-empirical time-dependent (TD) method. Transition S0 → S1 is forbidden for all carbazole-based compounds and partially-allowed for the triphenylamine-based compound (V1012). Transition S0 → S2 is partially-allowed for all compounds.
Spatial distributions of the electron density for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and next HOMO as well as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and next LUMO were obtained using the TD routine and are presented in Tables S5–S10 (ESI†). A more detailed description is available in the ESI.†
Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods (Table 1). The results are presented in Fig. 2 and the full characteristics are provided in Table 1. TGA analysis has shown that all of the synthesized compounds show good thermal stability up to ∼400 °C, which is comparable with model compound V950 (Tdec = 380 °C29) and slightly lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (Tdec = 449 °C34). The lowest 5% weight loss temperature of 370 °C is observed for compound V1004 possessing a tert-butyl group attached to the carbazolyl chromophore; however, it is high enough to signify good thermal stability, which is required for photovoltaic devices. In addition, a rapid weight loss during TGA experiments, which indicates that enamine-based HTMs undergo sublimation rather than thermal decomposition, is observed. This suggests that these HTMs could also be processed by vacuum processes which would further widen their applications.

The results of DSC analysis have revealed that V1000, V1012, and V1013, similarly to V950 and Spiro-OMeTAD, can exist both in the crystalline and the amorphous state while the others have a stronger tendency to crystallize. During the first heating, only melting is detected (Fig. 2b and Table 1). No crystallization takes place during the cooling or second heating scans. Only the glass transition (Tg) of these compounds was registered during the second heating, which is desired to form uniform HTM films in PSCs. Additional tert-butyl (V1004) and enamine moieties (V1021) affect the thermal properties of HTMs bearing the carbazolyl chromophore: during the second heating the glass transition is observed followed by recrystallization at 105 °C and 132 °C, respectively. Interestingly, the DSC curve for V1012 in the first heating reveals two peaks, corresponding to two eutectic melting points at 194 °C and 213 °C. Thus, the triphenylamine core-based enamine is distinguished by polymorphism with the predominant second crystalline phase at 194 °C.
Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption bands of the carbazole core-based enamines V1000, V1013, V1004, and V1021, and triphenylamine core-based enamine V1012 measured in THF are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of the model HTM V950 and parent compounds 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and 4-amino-triphenylamine are given for comparison reasons. As expected, the 9- and 3-alkylated carbazole core-based enamines V1000, V1013, and V1004 absorb in a similar region to V950, which consists of a weak band in the long wavelength region (∼400 nm) due to n–π* followed by a broad and intense band in the UV region (330 nm) due to π–π* transitions. The π–π* absorption bands for these HTMs are bathochromically shifted with respect to the reference 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole by 30 nm, indicating an increase in the size of the π-conjugated system due to carbazole core engineering by enamine moieties possessing 4-methoxyphenyl side arms. Obviously, this is more expressed in the case of triphenylamine core-based enamine V1012 as the π–π* absorption band is bathochromically shifted by 50 nm. Furthermore, the HTM possessing four enamine branches (V1021), as compared to V1000 possessing two enamine branches, shows both the hyperchromic effect and bathochromic shift to longer wavelengths due to the expanded conjugated π-electron system.

Photoelectrical properties
One of the important parameters of HTMs that need to be taken into consideration before constructing a device is the solid-state ionization potential (Ip), which gives an accurate estimation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of HTMs. The ionization potentials of the novel HTMs were measured by the photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) technique and the results are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 2; the measurement error is evaluated as 0.03 eV. The compounds with the carbazole core and different alkyl fragments (V950, V1000, and V1013) have almost the same Ip values of 5.01 eV, 5.00 eV, and 4.97 eV respectively. Compound V1004 possessing a tert-butyl group attached to the carbazolyl chromophore has a slightly higher Ip value of 5.08 eV. The highest Ip value was measured for the enamine-based HTM with a triphenylamine core V1012 (5.11 eV). On the other hand, incorporation of the four enamine fragments resulted in the lowest Ip of 4.93 eV for V1021. The estimated Ip values are very close to the value of the model HTM V95029 and Spiro-OMeTAD (5.00 eV)34 and are suitable for application in perovskite solar cell devices to ensure efficient hole transfer at the interface.

Another important property is the ability of the HTM to transport holes, which can be quantified by measuring the hole drift mobility. The results of measurements of hole drift mobility by means of the xerographic time of flight (XTOF) technique are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 4. At low electrical fields, all materials show hole drift mobilities of the same order of magnitude, and slightly lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. The change of the carbazole chromophore to triphenylamine in V1012 did not lead to substantial changes in the hole drift mobility, however, it is less dependent on the field strength. Incorporation of the aliphatic groups has not strongly affected the mobilities, and the mobility values μ0 are almost the same for V950, V1000, V1004, and V1013. On the other hand, enamine V1021 with four enamine branches shows the highest charge transporting ability, reaching a μ0 of 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These measurements further suggest that the materials would be able to efficiently collect charges in PSCs. While there is no strong correlation between hole drift mobility and device performance, usually higher values are required to achieve high PCE.

To evaluate the charge extraction ability of the newly synthesized HTMs, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements were conducted. All materials showed significantly reduced PL of the perovskite layer, which is commonly attributed to the efficient extraction of holes.
Perovskite solar cells
To test the operational performance of the synthesized HTMs, PSCs of mesoporous architecture (FTO/TiO2/m.p.TiO2/SnO2/Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)/HTM/Au) were constructed and investigated. The detailed fabrication procedure can be found in the ESI.† The performance of the new HTMs was compared to that of the devices with V950 and Spiro-OMeTAD.
First, we compared the performance of the new HTMs with that of the model compound V950. All devices showed good performance and weak hysteresis (Fig. S4, ESI†). For the V1021-based device, almost no hysteresis was observed. As seen from the data in Fig. 5a and Table 3, all of them have almost the same short-circuit current density (Jsc) values, which are in the range from 22.4 mA cm−2 for V1013 to 22.6 mA cm−2 for V1012. This suggests that the HTM does not strongly affect the charge collection properties of the perovskite, as can be seen from the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†). The fill-factor (FF) also differs only slightly for the majority of the devices, with the exception of V1000, for which a lower FF of 71% was obtained. However, the main variation of the performance stems from the changes in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Overall, three out of five new compounds outperformed V950, reaching 19% for V1012 and V1021, and 18.6% for V1004.

A comparison of the performance of the materials containing different aliphatic substituents has revealed that in two cases introduction of the insulating chains reduces the performance (16.5% for V1000 and 17.1% for V1013), however in the case of V1004 the performance is on the same level as the one of V950, even though the μ0 value for this HTM is the lowest among the studied materials. It emphasizes the importance of the substituent at the 6 position of the carbazole fragment. The change of the chromophore from carbazole to triphenylamine led to slightly better performance (19.0% for V1012). A slight increase was observed for all three parameters, in comparison to V950, resulting in an overall 0.6% PCE increase. It illustrates a possibility to further expand this synthetic strategy to the other photoactive fragments. Another compound, reaching 19.0%, was V1021 with double the number of enamine chromophores, mainly due to the increase in Voc. As in the case of V1004, the 6 position of carbazole is substituted, however, in this case with a redox-active moiety. Such a change in structure led to the best performance among the new HTMs. For V1021, the highest PCE coincides with the highest hole drift mobility value measured for the enamine HTMs (Table 2).
In Fig. S8 (ESI†) maximum power point tracking of the fresh devices is presented. It can be seen that the general trend in performance is preserved. In addition, the comparison of the best-performing devices is confirmed by statistical data (Fig. S6, ESI†).
In Fig. 5b, the comparison between best-performing enamine V1021 and V950, and Spiro-OMeTAD is presented. While V950 shows a slightly lower Voc (1.081 V) than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (1.125 V), an increased number of enamine moieties leads to the highest drift mobility value of μ0 = 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a higher Voc (1.118 V). This improvement leads to the same performance as the one of Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices.
Another important topic is device stability. Evaluation of the shelf life-time is presented in Fig. 6. Overall, the PCE of all HTMs increased slightly over the first 30 days. Afterward, some degradation started to occur, with the most pronounced drop in efficiency for V1000, for which the PCE reduced to 85% after 80 days. The stability of all other HTMs was comparable to that of V950 (>98% after 80 days) and was slightly better than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (95% after 80 days), which is on a par with our recent study of enamine-based HTMs.35 For V1000 the drop in performance was the most pronounced. The reason might be in the lowest Tg of V1000, which could lead to spontaneous crystallization even at lower temperatures, and as a consequence to the reduced performance.34 Interestingly, the performance of the device with V1021 was still slightly rising (in a range of ∼1%) even after 80 days, which in combination with the best performance makes this HTM very promising for further investigations.

Conclusions
In conclusion, 5 new enamine-based HTMs were synthesized by a metal-free enamine condensation reaction and tested for their performance in PSCs. The materials are thermally stable and could be deposited by a vacuum process. The HTMs have Ip in a range of 4.97–5.10 eV, which is suitable values for application in PSCs. Hole drift mobility values at low electrical fields are of the 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 order of magnitude, reaching the highest value of 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for V1021 with four enamine branches. PSCs with the new HTMs showed very good performance, the best efficiency reaching a 19.0% PCE for V1021, which is on a par with that of the state-of-the-art material Spiro-OMeTAD (19.1%). Moreover, V1004, V1012, V1013, and V1021 showed superior device stability, outperforming Spiro-OMeTAD. This work lays a foundation for further studies of enamine-based molecules, e.g. by increasing the number of enamine branches, or by the use of different central fragments (thiophene, indole etc.).
