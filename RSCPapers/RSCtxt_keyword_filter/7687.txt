    , Accepted 29th July 2014First published on 29th July 2014AbstractNew low bandgap conjugated copolymers based on isoindigo and three different chalcogenophenes (thiophene, selenophene and tellurophene) were synthesized (denoted as PIT, PISe and PITe, respectively) to investigate the effect of different chalcogenophenes on their photovoltaic properties. PISe and PITe show lower bandgaps and deeper HOMO energy levels as compared to PIT. The solar cell device based on PISe blended with PC61BM exhibits a promising PCE of 5.72% with a JSC of 10.21 mA cm−2, while PITe shows the lowest PCE of 1.16% with the lowest JSC of 2.51 mA cm−2 because of its coarse morphology although the field-effect hole mobility of PITe is the highest due to higher crystallinity than others.
Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention as a renewable energy source due to promising advantages such as low cost, light weight and flexibility.1–6 In the last decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was largely improved by development of novel conjugated polymers with high carrier mobility and broad absorption of the solar spectrum especially in the long wavelength region.7–9 One of the most effective methods to synthesize such novel conjugated polymers is to copolymerize an electron-donating monomer (D) with an electron-accepting monomer (A). Many electron-accepting monomers have been developed for D–A type low bandgap copolymers over the last decade.9–12
Isoindigo has recently been used as an A unit for D–A type copolymers, because isoindigo contains two strong electron-withdrawing lactam rings with a planar conjugated structure.13–26 It has been reported that isoindigo-based polymers exhibit a high absorption coefficient, broad absorption and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level.14–26 Since Reynold et al.13 first reported an isoindigo-based small molecule for photovoltaic application, isoindigo-based polymers have also been synthesized and used for photovoltaics.14–26 Recently, the devices fabricated from isoindigo-based polymers have achieved high PCEs up to 8.2%.15,17
It has been known that heterocyclic aromatic rings with different chalcogens (the chemical elements in group 16) show different electrical, photophysical and electrochemical properties.27 Thiophene-based conjugated polymers have been mostly used for photovoltaic applications,9–12 although other chalogenophene-based polymers also have strong potential for optoelectronic applications. Selenophene-based semiconducting organic compounds have several advantages over thiophene-based ones: (1) selenophene-based conjugated polymers have a narrower optical bandgap than thiophene-based ones,28–33 because the selenophene-based polymer backbone is better planar than the thiophene-based one due to a shorter inter-ring C–C bond between selenophene and the adjoining molecule,27,34 and (2) a selenophene-containing molecule has stronger intermolecular interaction than the thiophene-containing counterpart because the selenium atom in selenophene is more easily polarized than the sulfur atom in thiophene.27,34 Hence, it is expected from above properties that selenophene-based conjugated polymers exhibit broader photon absorption and higher crystallinity. Likewise, since tellurium has stronger polarizability than sulfur and selenium, tellurophene-based polymers show a bathochromic shift and higher crystallinity compared to that of a thiophene- or selenophene-based polymer.35–43 These advantageous properties of selenophene and tellurophene provide strong potential for use as promising building blocks for high-performance conjugated polymers.
In this study, we synthesized three isoindigo-based D–A type conjugated copolymers (PIT, PISe and PITe) with three different chalcogenophenes (thiophene, selenophene and tellurophene) and compared their photovoltaic properties. The two copolymers (PISe and PITe) containing selenophene and tellurophene show a bathochromic shift and a lower bandgap as compared to its thiophene analogue (PIT). The solar cell fabricated from the PISe:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) blend exhibits a promising PCE of 5.72% with a JSC of 10.21 mA cm−2, a high VOC of 0.95 V and a fill factor of 59%. Consequently, it is concluded that selenophene is the most promising building block among the three chalcogenophens for high performance semiconducting conjugated polymers.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa-Aesar and TCI chemicals, and used without further purification. The following compounds were synthesized according to the procedures reported previously: 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-hexyldecyl)isoindigo,21,44 tellurophene,45–47 and 2,5-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)chalcogenophene.48,49
Synthesis of copolymers
For synthesis of PIT, a mixture of (E)-6,6′-dibromo-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (150 mg, 0.173 mmol), 2,5-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)thiophene (70.7 mg, 0.173 mmol), tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tolyl)3) (10 mg) and tris(dibenzylidene acetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) (6 mg) in anhydrous toluene (4 mL) was charged in a microwave reactor vial. After the reaction mixture was heated at 140 °C for 12 h, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL) and the precipitate was collected in a Soxhlet thimble filter. The precipitate was then extracted with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated before it was precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered over a PTFE filter and dried overnight in 87% yield. PISe was synthesized by the same procedure as the method for synthesis of PIT except the use of 2,5-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)selenophene instead of thiophene analogue. PITe was synthesized by reacting isoindigo and 2,5-bis(trimethyl-stannyl)tellurophene in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4). The yields of PISe and PITe were 79% and 85%, respectively.
Characterization
The chemical structures of monomers were identified by 1H NMR (Avance DPX-300) and 13C NMR (Avance DPX-500). Mass analysis was performed on a mass analyzer (JMS-600W, JEOL). Molecular weight and their distribution were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters) equipped with a Waters 2414 refractive index detector using CHCl3 as an eluent, where the columns were calibrated against standard polystyrene samples. The optical absorption spectra were obtained by an UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile. A three-electrode setup was used with platinum wires as both working and counter electrodes. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenyl couple (Fc/Fc+). The HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset point using the equation of EHOMO = −(4.8 + Eox). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from an X-ray diffractometer (New D8 Advance, Bruker) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Thin film morphology was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, JEM1010) operating at 80 kV of acceleration voltage.
Device fabrication and characterization
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a layered structure of the ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al configuration. The ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned by stepwise sonication in acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each. After complete drying, the ITO coated glass substrate was treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO with 40 nm thickness, and the substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glove box. After a mixture of polymer and PC61BM was dissolved in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) under stirring at 70 °C for 4 h, the solution was spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Ca (20 nm in thickness) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) on the top of the active layer before Al (100 nm) was thermally deposited on the Ca layer. The active area of the cell was 4 mm2. The photovoltaic performance was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere inside the glove box. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the device was obtained on a computer-controlled Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by an Oriel solar simulator (Oriel 91160A). The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL-certified photodiode prior to each measurement. The EQE was measured using the Polaronix K3100 IPCE measurement system (McScience). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si cell. A bottom-gate/top-contact field-effect transistor (FET) was fabricated using a heavily doped Si wafer as the bottom gate electrode and 250 nm of SiO2 layer as the gate dielectric. The substrate was cleaned in piranha solution (H2SO4–H2O2 = 1:1) and then in acetone for 20 min and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 1 h. The wafer was treated with UV–ozone for 20 min, and then the wafer was immersed in 0.1 mM octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) solution in anhydrous toluene. The polymer film was deposited on the OTS treated substrate by spin-coating the polymer solution (5 mg mL−1) in CHCl3, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. After deposition of a polymer thin film, the gold top contact with 40 nm thickness was thermally evaporated under vacuum through a shadow mask. OFETs were characterized under a nitrogen atmosphere using Keithley 4200 and MST5000A.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and charaterization
PIT and PISe were synthesized via the Stille coupling polycondensation catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3, while Pd(PPh3)4 was used as a catalyst to synthesize PITe (Scheme 1). All polymers are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene due to a long and branched side chain on the isoindigo unit. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PIT, PISe and PITe were 86, 108, and 47 kDa with polydispersity indexes (PDI) of 1.55, 1.51, and 1.60, respectively, as determined by GPC.

Optical and electrochemical properties
When the UV–Visible spectra of three polymers in solution are compared, as shown in Fig. 1a, it reveals that the absorption maximum (λmax) and the absorption onset (λonset) of the three polymers are of the order of PITe, PISe and PIT, indicating that the bathochromic shift of PITe is the most prominent. The absorption spectra of three polymers in the solid state are red-shifted as compared to those in solution, as shown in Fig. 1b, while λmax and λonset of three polymers in the solid state show the same order as in solution, indicating that the substitution of sulfur in thiophene with selenium and tellurium is an effective method to extend the absorption range to longer wavelengths. Furthermore, the molar extinction coefficient of PISe (∼64000 M−1 cm−1) is larger than that of PIT (∼53200 M−1 cm−1), when the coefficient was calculated from the molarity of monomer units. When the HOMO energy levels of polymers were measured using cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO energy levels of PIT, PISe and PITe were −5.61, −5.66 and −5.69 eV, respectively (Table 1). These deep HOMO energy levels of polymers are expected to afford high open circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
The effect of chalcogen atom substitution on the photovoltaic properties was investigated by measuring and comparing the photovoltaic properties of three polymers. The J–V curves of three devices are shown in Fig. 3a, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. When the solar cell performances of three polymers are compared, the device fabricated from PISe exhibits the highest PCE value of 5.72% with a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 10.21 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59% while the device from PITe shows the lowest PCE of 1.16%, although all devices fabricated from three polymers show nearly the same VOC (0.91–0.95 V). The highest PCE of PISe arises mainly from the highest JSC, which is attributed to effective photon absorption and high external quantum efficiency (EQE), as shown in Fig. 1a and 3b. However, a comparison of the absorption spectra (Fig. 1a) with the external quantum efficiency spectra (Fig. 3b) reveals that the PITe-based device exhibits a low EQE although PITe has the lowest bandgap and thus is expected to absorb more photons at longer wavelengths than others. It should be mentioned here that higher PCE of PISe does not arise mainly from its higher molecular weight, because the PCE of PISe does not significantly depend on the molecular weight when the molecular weight exceeds 40 kDa (see Fig. S5 and Table S1 in ESI†).

Crystallinity of polymers and OFET properties
To investigate the reason for lower JSC than expected for PITe, we measured the crystallinity and charge transport properties of the polymers by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the FET method. The XRD spectra (Fig. 4) of three polymers reveal that PIT and PISe show a weak diffraction peak of (100) while PITe exhibits a strong diffraction peak of (100) along with discernible (200) and (300) peaks, indicating that PITe has the highest crystallinity. In other words, the degree of crystallinity is of the order of PITe, PISe and PIT. When the FET mobilities of three polymers were measured with the bottom-gate and top-contact configuration (Fig. 5), the FET hole mobilities of PIT, PISe and PITe were 0.003, 0.016 and 0.072 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, indicating that the hole mobility is closely related to the crystallinity. It has also been reported that the tellurophene-containing conjugated polymer has higher FET hole mobility than its thiophene analogue.46 Therefore, it is concluded that the low JSC of PITe is not related to the crystallinity and the hole mobility of polymers, because PITe has higher hole mobility than PIT and PISe, but exhibits the lowest JSC. Hence, another factor must be considered for low JSC of PITe.

Thin film morphology
Another important factor to control JSC is the morphology of active layer in PSC device. When the TEM images of three active layers are compared, as shown in Fig. 6, it reveals that the image of the PISe:PC61BM blend exhibits finer domains while the image of the PITe:PC61BM blend shows larger and coarse phase separation, which may negatively contribute to JSC, impeding effective charge carrier transport. The inferior morphology of the PITe:PC61BM film might result from excessive aggregation of PITe due to strong Te⋯Te intermolecular interactions27 and/or poor miscibility between PITe and PC61BM.50 It should be noted here that all the devices were optimized by varying the blend ratio of the polymer to PC61BM and adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Therefore, it is concluded that the highest JSC of PISe arises mainly from effective photon absorption at a long wavelength region and effective charge transport due to fibrillar morphology with finer domains whereas the lowest JSC of the PITe-based solar cell is mainly attributed to the coarse morphology with large phase separation.

Conclusions
In this study, a series of low bandgap conjugated copolymers composed of isoindigo and aromatic heterocyclic compounds with different chalcogen atoms were synthesized to investigate the effect of different chalcogen atoms on their photovoltaic performances. As the thiophene unit in the isoindigo-based conjugated polymer was substituted by selenophene and tellurophene, the bandgap and the HOMO energy level of the conjugated copolymer becomes lower and deeper, respectively, and the crystallinity of the polymer is increased. The solar cell device based on PISe exhibits the highest PCE of 5.72% with a high VOC of 0.95 V due to the deep HOMO level and the highest JSC of 10.21 mA cm−2 due to effective absorption of the long wavelength region and formation of fibrillar morphology with finer domains, whereas the PITe-based PSC shows the lowest PCE of 1.16% with the lowest JSC of 2.51 mA cm−2 due to coarse morphology with large phase separation, although the PITe thin film exhibits the highest FET hole mobility of 0.072 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the highest crystallinity.
