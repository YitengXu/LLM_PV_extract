    , Accepted 8th December 2016First published on 9th December 2016AbstractHybrid solar cells based on the pDPP5T-2 electron donating polymer, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and cadmium selenide telluride (CdSeXTe1−X) quantum dots (QDs) are fabricated and their photovoltaic performance and optoelectronic properties are investigated as a function of QD loading. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid solar cells is improved up to 5.11% for the device containing 4 wt% of QDs which is mainly due to the enhancement in short circuit current density (Jsc) resulting from increased light harvesting. A full-fledged study is performed on the microstructure, charge transfer/transport and recombination mechanisms of our ternary hybrid solar cells by employing various advanced techniques. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results reveal the non-agglomerated and uniform distribution of the CdSeXTe1−X QDs within the pDPP5T-2:PC61BM host matrix at low QD concentrations. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) showed a slower charge carrier recombination rate due to the introduction of QDs into the photoactive layer. It can be attributed to the more efficient exciton dissociation in ternary systems. These findings are consistent with the photovoltaic properties of the device.
Introduction
Organic ternary photovoltaic devices are promising competitors with silicon based solar cells, since they have the potential to be manufactured by low-cost processes in a large scale and they can offer flexibility and transparency.1 Most of these solar cells consist of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) between light absorbing electron-donating (p-type) and electron-accepting (n-type) materials. Nevertheless, organic solar cells present several dilemmas and challenges: they suffer from low mobility, low exciton diffusion lengths and incomplete harvesting of the solar spectrum.2 The last problem has been tackled by incorporating a second absorber like low band gap polymers,3–11 small molecules12–14 and dyes12,15–17 as alternatives to more complicated multi-layer or multi-cell stacks.18,19 Owing to the broader light harvesting, these ternary devices showed enhanced PCE.
Semiconductor QDs are also very promising sensitizers because of their special properties like easily tunable valence and conduction bands and band gap, versatile surface chemistry and compositional flexibility, potential multiexciton generation, small exciton binding energy, broad light harvesting and large absorption coefficients, to name a few.20,21 Importantly, by tuning their size – due to the quantum confinement effect – they can be accurately modeled to fit the complementary absorption spectrum of the polymers. Furthermore, depending on their size, QDs can reflect and scatter light and therefore increase the optical path without the need of thicker layers that would be deleterious for the charge transport. QDs such as CdSe,22–24 CdTe,25 PbS26–28 and InP29 have been incorporated into polymeric host systems to improve the final PCE of the solar cell by broadening its absorption and optimizing charge dissociation, separation and collection.30
QDs can have different chemical structures, like single-component, binary, multicomponent core/shell and alloys. The latter have attracted great attention due to the enhanced chemical stability resulting from hardened lattice structure, higher crystallinity, decreased inter-diffusion processes and higher photoluminescence quantum yields.31 Notably, the optoelectronic properties of alloyed QDs can be tuned by their composition without changing the particle size.32 Due to an optical bowing effect, the relationship between composition and absorption/emission energies is nonlinear.33 Taking the aforementioned factors into consideration, ternary alloy cadmium selenide telluride (CdSeXTe1−X) QDs can absorb at lower energies when compared with their parent binary CdSe and CdTe QDs. CdSeXTe1−X alloyed QDs with water-soluble mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) ligands were investigated in 2013 by Pan et al.30 when applied in a liquid-junction QD sensitized solar cell. Enhanced PCE of 6.36% has been reported when compared with 4.75 and 0.81% for CdSe and CdTe sensitized solar cells as a result of extended light absorption range. In this contribution, we implemented CdSeXTe1−X alloyed QDs for the first time in solid state organic solar cells. For that, we constructed an inverted architecture solar cell based on the pDPP5T-2 electron donating polymer (a thiophene derivative of diketopyrrolopyrrole, hereinafter abbreviated as DPP), [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and methylthiophenol (MTP) capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs. Recently, low-bandgap polymers based on DPP have attracted great attention in both solution-processed organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and organic thin film transistors (OTFT)33–35 due to their high charge carrier mobility, strong light absorption and enhanced stability. DPP has been also successfully utilized in ternary and tandem solar cells with polymers like P3HT or PCDTBT due to its complementary absorption spectrum which is mostly in the NIR spectral region.36,37
To study the optoelectronic characteristics of these new organic/inorganic hybrid systems as a function of CdSeXTe1−X content we combined photovoltaic device characterization with photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV), static and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) as well as the emission property of the system. PCE enhancement was observed with increasing CdSeXTe1−X QD content up to 4 wt% due to the improved light absorption and longer recombination lifetime.
Experimental
Synthesis of CdSeXTe1−X QDs
CdO 99.99%, Te 99.997% and Se 99.99% powders, 1-octadecene (ODE) (tech grade 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP) 97%, p-methylthiophenol 98%, trimethylamine 99%, hexane 99%, methanol 99.8%, ethanol 99.8%, acetone 99.9%, chloroform 99%, dichloromethane 99.8%, chlorobenzene 99.8%, and pyridine 99.8% were purchased from Aldrich. Oleic acid (tech grade) was purchased from Fisher Chemicals. All the synthetic steps were performed under an argon atmosphere.
For CdSeXTe1−X QDs, the synthesis method of Liao et al.38 and Pan et al.32 was adopted with minor modifications. 0.75 mL of 0.1 M tri-n-octylphosphine telluride (TOPTe) was obtained by dispersing 0.0384 g of tellurium in 0.75 mL of tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) and 4.5 mL of ODE at 250 °C. 4.5 mL of tri-n-octylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) 0.1 M was obtained by dispersing 0.0237 g of selenium in 0.75 mL of TOP and 4.5 mL of ODE at 60 °C. For the preparation of the cadmium precursor, 0.385 g of CdO was dispersed in 10 mL of oleic acid and 20 mL of ODE in a three-necked flask connected to a Schlenk line setup. The mixture was then heated under vacuum for 30 minutes at 90 °C. The temperature was then increased to 200 °C until the solution was of clear light yellow color. Finally the solution was cooled to 90 °C, left for 20 minutes under vacuum and refilled with argon 3 times in order to remove traces of oxygen and water. The nucleation of CdSeXTe1−X QDs capped with oleate was started by injecting the Se and Te precursors into the Cd precursor at 90 °C. The resulting molar ratio of Cd:Se:Te was 10:1:1. By heating the solution up to 320 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 the growth of the particles was enabled. After keeping the mixture at 320 °C for 15 min, the flask was cooled down in a water bath to room temperature. For the extraction of by-products and unreacted precursors the solution was transferred into a decantation funnel and 80 mL of a mixture of hexane and methanol (1:1) was added. Three purification steps were done by precipitation with ethanol, centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 seconds and re-dispersion in dichloromethane. The final dispersion was stored under an inert atmosphere. For the exchange of oleate with p-methylthiophenol (MTP), a degassed solution of MTP (chemical structure of MTP is shown in Fig. 1a) in dichloromethane (0.476 g mL−1) was mixed and stirred with a degassed solution of triethylamine (TEA) in 1:1 molar ratio. After a few minutes of stirring, the initial optically transparent solution turned into a white gel, indicating the formation of triethylammonium p-methylthiophenolate. To that gel, a previously degassed solution of CdSeXTe1−X QDs capped with oleate in dichloromethane (10 mg mL−1) was added, and left with vigorous stirring for 12 hours until the disappearance of the gel. The particles were purified by three times precipitation with hexane, centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 minutes and re-dispersion in dichloromethane. The precipitate was washed with methanol to remove the excess of triethylammonium p-methylthiophenolate and re-dispersed in a mixture of chlorobenzene and pyridine of 7:3 volume-ratio. CdSeXTe1−X QD solution was filtered using a 450 μm pore size PTFE filter before use.

Photovoltaic device fabrication
All devices were fabricated using the doctor-blade coating technique under ambient conditions with the inverted structure as shown in Fig. 1b. Pre-structured ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl bath each for 10 min, followed by drying. The substrates were coated with 40 nm of zinc oxide (ZnO) and 10 nm of Ba(OH)2 as electron transporting layers. An approximately 90 nm thick active layer based on DPP (provided by BASF):PC61BM (supplied by Solenne BV with a purity of 99.5%) (20 g L−1 solution in a mixture of chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (9:1 volume-ratio)) with and without CdSeXTe1−X QDs was coated on top followed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm of MoOx (as a hole transporting layer) and 100 nm of Ag under a vacuum of ≈2 × 10−6 mbar. For all samples the overall polymer to fullerene/CdSeXTe1−X QD ratio was 1:2 by weight fraction. The active layer thickness was approximately the same for all devices. Structural formulas of DPP and PC61BM are provided in Fig. 1a.
Measurements
FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu IR Prestige spectrometer based on the attenuated total reflection method. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a PHILIPS X’Pert Pro MPD Powder X-Ray Diffractometer (U = 40 kV, I = 35° mA, line focus 15° < 2θ < 50°, Cu Kα, 1.541 nm radiation). The J–V characteristics were measured using a source measurement unit from BoTest. Illumination was provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 1A, from Newport) with AM1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency was measured using the QE-R Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System from Enli Technology Company. Absorption measurements were done using the Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis Spectrometer. PL measurements were performed on photoactive layers, which were excited with a 405 nm laser. The PL emission of the films was dispersed using a 600 lines mm−1 grating monochromator (HRS-2) and detected using an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector (ADC 403L) through the lock-in technique. The fluorescence spectrum was corrected for the optical density of the sample at the excitation wavelength, and for the detection sensitivity of the InGaAs detector. The photoactive layers for TEM investigations were prepared as plan-view specimens. For this purpose, photoactive-layer films were deposited on PEDOT:PSS (50 nm) coated glass using the doctor-blade coating technique under ambient conditions. To float off the active layer, the sample was put into a vessel with distilled water, where PEDOT:PSS dissolved, and the photoactive layer was transferred to a Cu TEM supporting grid. The TEM investigations were performed using an FEI Titan Themis3 300 TEM with a high brightness field emission gun (X-FEG) operated at 200 kV and equipped with a high-resolution Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF Quantum). For the TAS measurements, films were excited with a laser pulse (1 kHz, 150 fs pulse width, 100 nJ for films, 200 nJ for solutions) from an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system (CPA 2101 Laser, Clark-MXR Inc.), and the excited states were probed with a second laser pulse that arrives at controllable times after the excitation pulse. In photo-CELIV measurements, the devices were illuminated with a 780 nm laser diode. Current transients were recorded across the internal 50 Ω resistor of an oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies DSO-X 2024A). We used a fast electrical switch to isolate the cell and prevent charge extraction or sweep out during the laser pulse and the delay time. After a variable delay time, a linear extraction ramp was applied via a function generator. The ramp, which was 60 μs long and 2 V in amplitude, was set to start with an offset matching the Voc of the cell for each delay time. From the measured photocurrent transients, the charge carrier mobility (μ) was calculated.10
Result and discussion
The precipitation of the QDs in hexane after the ligand exchange, qualitatively, demonstrates the efficient replacement of oleate ligands. Indeed, hexane is a good solvent for oleate capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs, but not for p-methylthiophenolate capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs. Hence a less polar solvent such as dichloromethane was used in order to re-dissolve the precipitate. For a quantitative inspection, the ligand exchange from oleate capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs to p-methylthiophenolate capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs was monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Complete oleate displacement is confirmed by the disappearance of carboxylate peaks at 1525 cm−1 and by the presence of the aromatic ring stretching of the arylthiolate at 1475 cm−1 (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
The X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) analysis revealed the characteristic peaks of zinc blende CdSeXTe1−X indicating that upon ligand exchange, the crystallinity of the pristine QDs is preserved (see Fig. S2, ESI†). These peaks are located between those of zinc blende CdTe and CdSe materials.
UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra (excitation at 450 nm) of methylthiophenol-capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The QDs exhibit the first transition located at 800 nm with steadily increasing absorption at shorter wavelengths. The emission spectrum extends from ca. 700 to 1000 nm and has a peak at 860 nm. From the TEM image (see the inset of Fig. S3, ESI†) an average QD diameter of 6.3 nm is observed.

Fig. 2a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of pristine films of DPP, CdSeXTe1−X QDs and of the combination of DPP and CdSeXTe1−X QDs (1:1 weight ratio). DPP shows three maximum absorption peaks at approximately 440, 720 and 780 nm. From these spectra it is evident that the two materials have complementary absorption spectra, i.e. photons with wavelengths lower than 600 nm are mostly absorbed by the QDs, while photons with lower energy are harvested by the polymer chain. Upon blending with the QDs, the absorption of the film is significantly enhanced below 600 nm.

As mentioned previously, QDs show an emission peak at 860 nm; however, upon blending with DPP (1:1 weight ratio), the photoluminescence spectrum revealed a quenching of 80% (see Fig. 2b) and a red shift of approximately 20 nm (see the inset of Fig. 2b). The latter is the consequence of a change in the permittivity of the QDs’ surrounding environment while the former is the evidence of hole transfer from QDs to the polymer, which is in agreement with the cascade energy level alignment of the materials (see Fig. 1c). Unlike in the case of CdSeXTe1−X QDs, DPP quenching upon introduction of QDs is low for the wavelengths higher than 900 nm (around 45%); for shorter wavelengths an emission peak at ∼880 nm is observed which matches the CdSexTe1−x emission peak. However, according to the energy level diagram of the materials, electron transfer from DPP to the QDs is favorable; thus DPP PL quenching due to the introduction of QDs was expected. Consequently, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from QDs to the DPP could be the reason for lower DPP quenching. A large overlap between the DPP absorption and the CdSeXTe1−X emission spectra indicates the possibility of FRET from CdSeXTe1−X to DPP (see Fig. S4a, ESI†). Conversely, the negligible overlap between CdSeXTe1−X absorption spectra and DPP photoluminescence does not support the hypothesis of energy transfer from DPP to CdSeXTe1−X (see Fig. S4b, ESI†). The energy level diagram of the materials also confirms the probability of charge transfer from QDs to the PC61BM supported by the strong quenching of QDs’ photoluminescence spectra upon blending with PC61BM (1:1 weight ratio, see Fig. S5, ESI†). As a result, exciton dissociation can occur at the DPP/PC61BM, DPP/CdSeXTe1−X and CdSeXTe1−X/PC61BM interfaces. This would enhance the DPP exciton dissociation efficiency in the ternary blend as compared to the DPP:PC61BM binary reference and would also allow the hole transfer from QDs to the polymer upon electron transfer from QDs to the fullerene.
The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of inverted structure devices containing different amounts of CdSeXTe1−X QDs under 1 sun AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, and these results are summarized in Table 1. (These results are the average of six cells and the box diagram of solar cell characteristics are provided in Fig. S6, ESI†.) As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3c, the open circuit voltage (Voc) remains approximately constant with increasing CdSeXTe1−X loading up to 35 wt%, while the short-circuit current density improves up to 7% (from 13.78 to 14.73 mA cm−2) with the introduction of 4 wt% of CdSeXTe1−X. As shown in the EQE spectra, the JSC improvement by introduction of the QDs is due to light harvesting enhancement on the one hand and, as mentioned before, more efficient exciton dissociation and higher charge carrier generation on the other hand. A further increase in the CdSeXTe1−X content led to a gradual reduction in JSC, although its value for the device containing up to 20 wt% QDs is still higher than that of the reference device without QDs. However, with the addition of more than 20 wt% QDs into the host matrix, the Jsc drops significantly. This result may indicate that the charge transport pathways could be severely destroyed by higher amounts of QDs. The aforementioned result is supported by FF reduction in devices containing more than 20 wt% CdSeXTe1−X. The trend in JSC at different CdSeXTe1−X concentrations is in good agreement with the EQE spectra. At low QD concentrations (≤14 wt%) the EQE is improved all over the spectra from 350 to 800 nm, especially in the UV-Vis region below 600 nm where QDs have strong absorption. Finally, the PCE also shows the same trend as JSC (see Fig. 3c), indicating that variations in JSC play a major role in the final PCE of these systems.

Photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) was measured to investigate the effect of QD loading on charge generation in detail (depicted in Fig. 3d).39,40 The photocurrent density is defined as Jph = Jl − Jd, where Jl and Jd are the current density under illumination at 100 mW cm −2 and in the dark, respectively. Veff is given by Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage measured at Jph(V0) = 0, and V is the applied voltage. For Veff < 0.2 V, a linear dependence between Jph and voltage was observed, due to the competition between drift and diffusion of photogenerated free charges to the electrodes, while for Veff >1 V Jph quickly saturates as shown in Fig. 3d. Here, the maximum generation rate of free charge carriers Gmax can be obtained according to Jsat = q·Gmax·L,41 where q is the electronic charge and L is the active layer thickness, since all generated electron–hole pairs are dissociated and collected at the electrodes at full saturation. Importantly, Gmax improves by QD loading from 1.095 × 1022 for binary devices to 1.163 × 1022 for devices containing 4 wt% QDs (see Table 1). However, on further increasing the QD content (35 wt%) Gmax decreases.
The same trend is also observed for charge carrier mobility μ measured by employing the technique of photoinduced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) (see Table 1).42 Charges are photogenerated by a strongly absorbed laser pulse and extracted after an adjustable delay time (see Fig. S7, ESI†). Charge mobility is quite similar to the reference at low QD concentrations and just drops notably at a high QD concentration of 20 wt%, which is consistent with the slightly decreased FF for the corresponding solar cell.
The dispersion of QDs throughout the matrix and the active layer morphology were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 4 shows TEM bright field images of DPP:PC61BM (a) and the films containing 4 and 20 wt% CdSeXTe1−X QDs ((d) and (g) respectively). Well dispersed QDs are observable up to the concentration of 4 wt%. On increasing the QD content, large agglomerates – responsible for lower device performance – are observed. Elemental maps based on energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) imaging of carbon (C) using the C K edge and of sulfur (S) using the S L edge were derived to investigate the DPP and PC61BM domains. The S signal is used to represent DPP, as only DPP comprises S (S in DPP = 13.8 at% and S in PC61BM = 0.0 at%). Note that the CdSeXTe1−X QDs appear bright in the S map, as the MTP capping contains S. The C signal is used to represent PC61BM because of the difference in the C content of PC61BM and DPP (C in PC61BM = 81.8 at% and C in DPP = 39.1 at%). The carbon and sulfur maps of the reference and of the film containing 4 and 20 wt% QDs reveal a similar shape and size of polymer fullerene phases. Indeed, this fact explains the slightly higher or comparable performance of 14 and 20 wt% ternary cells as compared to the control binary DPP:PC61BM blend. However, at these concentrations due to agglomerated QDs one can see a drop in efficiency as compared to the ternary device with 4 wt% QDs.

Pump–probe TAS has been utilized by many researchers to probe the kinetics of transient species including charge carriers, excitons, exciplexes, etc., in thin films.43,44 Valuable data related to the charge recombination dynamics of free carriers in organic solar cells can be obtained from transient spectra with time delays in the ps to ns regime. Shorter time delays provide insights into the charge-generation process.

Fig. 5a (top panel) shows the steady state absorption of DPP and its absorption spectrum upon spectroelectrochemical oxidation. Fig. 5a (bottom panel) indicates the transient absorption spectrum of a DPP:PC61BM film in both visible and NIR region, recorded with time delays of 2 ps upon 695 nm laser excitation with a power of 100 nJ. A negative peak in the 570 to 790 nm range with a minimum at 700 nm related to the ground state bleaching of the DPP is observed. Additionally, transient absorption signals located at 520, 850 and 1100–1300 are observed. The comparison between the transient absorption spectrum of DPP:PC61BM and the spectroelectrochemical features of DPP upon oxidation provides the evidence of electron transfer from DPP to PC61BM. The signature of the PC61BM radical anion – known to be at about 1100 nm – corroborates our findings.

Similar experiments were performed for the binary (DPP:CdSeXTe1−X, PC61BM:CdSeXTe1−X) and ternary samples (PC61BM:CdSeXTe1−X:DPP) containing 1, 4, 14 and 20 wt% QDs to investigate the changes in charge carrier dynamics upon introducing QDs. Fig. 5b (top panel) shows transient absorption measurements of a DPP:CdSeXTe1−X film in 1:1 weight ratio, and again the DPP polaron signature was detected. In control experiments, in which the CdSeXTe1−X:PC61BM film in 1:1 weight ratio was excited with a wavelength of 695 nm and an intensity of 100 nJ (see Fig. 5b (the bottom panel)), no appreciable differential absorption changes were noticed due to the negligible absorption of CdSeXTe1−X at the excitation wavelength. Therefore, charge carriers localized on DPP must stem from an electron transfer from DPP to CdSeXTe1−X rather than from charge carriers directly generated in CdSeXTe1−X.
The TA spectrum of the ternary systems shows similar trends when compared with the reference DPP:PC61BM film (see Fig. 5c and Fig. S8, ESI†). This indicates that the charge transfer from DPP to PC61BM within the ternary mixture is preserved. Time absorption profiles of the reference and ternary films were fitted at 850 and 1100 nm by two and three exponential functions, respectively (see Fig. 5d and Table 2). We ascribe the shorter lifetime DPP polarons of 0.8 ps in the reference film excited at 695 nm and evaluated at 850 nm to the geminate recombination of bound charge carriers. Charge transfer at the electron donor–acceptor interfaces is excluded since it happens in the time scale of less than 1 ps (about hundreds of fs),45 therefore, faster than the time resolution of our experimental setup.

Etzold et al. consider three mechanisms for the non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers. By the encounter of two oppositely charged free carriers at the donor–acceptor interface, a weakly bound charge transfer (CT) state with spin singlet and spin triplet (1:3 ratio) is created across the interface before the recombination. The formation of triplet CT state could also occur via intersystem crossing of CT states immediately created after singlet exciton dissociation. The latter takes a few hundred picoseconds for the PCPDTBT:PC61BM and PSBTBT:PC61BM blends as reported by Etzold et al. The third mechanism is based on the recombination of free charge carriers and collapsing into the polymer triplet state which occurs in the range of 1–10 ns as reported by Ochsmann et al. for the PTDPP-TT:fullerene blend.43 Consequently the second and third components of the time absorption profiles of our reference film which are larger than 20 and 483.7 ps, respectively, can be attributed to the non-geminate recombination through CT state and to the intersystem crossing respectively.
By introducing 4 wt% CdSeXTe1−X QDs to the DPP:PC61BM blend, the first, second and third components of the time absorption profiles increase by 45, 97 and 126% respectively to 1.16, 39.4 and 1090 ps. These observed slower recombination kinetics are responsible for the enhanced performance of devices. Indeed, the delayed recombination kinetics may be attributed to an effective larger dielectric constant in hybrid ternary blends compared to the organic binary blend. On further increasing the QD loading to 20 wt%, the recombination times decrease slightly, but still remain larger than in the DPP:PC61BM reference sample. The faster recombination can be ascribed to the unfavourable morphology induced by higher amounts of QDs.
The analysis of the PC61BM radical anions’ dynamics at 1100 nm shows a consistent trend with the DPP polarons at 850 nm.
Conclusions
In summary, hybrid ternary solar cells based on the DPP:PC61BM host matrix blended with different amounts of MTP capped CdSeXTe1−X QDs were fabricated and characterized. Solar conversion efficiency was improved upon incorporation of QDs with an optimized concentration of 4 wt%. The improvement is mainly due to the enhanced JSC resulting from larger light harvesting, facilitated exciton dissociation, and higher charge generation. In sound agreement with the photovoltaic findings, TAS measurements showed delayed geminate and non-geminate recombination times for the ternary films compared to the DPP:PC61BM reference film. Although a higher QD concentration would be, in principle, beneficial for more efficient light harvesting, the TEM results revealed that the device performance at higher QD concentrations is limited by agglomerated and improperly distributed CdSeXTe1−X QDs. This full-fledged study offers some clues as to how the efficiency of hybrid ternary solar cells can be further enhanced by designing a more appropriate ligand/ligand exchange process for the sensitizer QDs.
