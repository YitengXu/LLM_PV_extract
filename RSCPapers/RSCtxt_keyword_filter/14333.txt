    , Accepted 19th June 2023First published on 20th June 2023AbstractSpirodifluorene (SF) was originally used as the core of an X-shaped four-armed molecule, and the construction of two-armed molecules with linear large conjugated planes based on SF will greatly expand the design concept of such photovoltaic materials. Taking twisted SF as the core, four novel linear conjugated two-armed small molecule donors (SMDs), SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, were designed and synthesized successfully. Herein, a two-armed extension design strategy was employed to regulate the optoelectronic properties of the materials by introducing ethynyl as the π-bridge and carbazole units as terminal units individually or simultaneously, which is completely different from traditional X-shaped materials based on SF. Considering the molecular design, SF can not only create large conjugated skeletons via an extension strategy but also has the characteristic of “protruding out of plane” in its torsional structure. Introducing an ethynyl group reduces HOMO levels and regulates molecular geometry. Introducing carbazole as the end group prolongs the conjugated skeleton and promotes the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. As the most important result, the photovoltaic devices based on SF(DPPCz)2/PC71BM exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.12% along with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.60 mA cm−2 due to the broad and strong absorption caused by the narrow band gap molecular design, accompanied by the strongest and broadest photoelectric response in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves and the highest hole mobility value. To our knowledge, this is the highest PCE reported so far for SF-based organic SMDs. This work provides an innovative molecular design method that extends from the two arms of molecules containing X-shaped nuclei to develop novel two-armed linear SMDs.
Introduction
During the past two decades, a large number of interdisciplinary approaches have been focused on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) from both scientific and technological research viewpoints, which have led to remarkable progress and tremendous breakthroughs.1–6 The flexibility, lightness, wearability, biocompatibility, and especially the printability and other advantages of organic solar cells7–10 promise unprecedented and innovative applications, while conventional inorganic solar cells are difficult to achieve. To date, under the synergy of molecular structure engineering and device engineering, the PCE of OSCs has exceeded 19%.11,12 After the advent of promising Y-series acceptors,13–16 extensive efforts have been devoted to the research of BHJ OSCs based on the active layer of the polymer donor and Y-series acceptor. Nevertheless, many studies still focus on all-small-molecule BHJ OSCs, because small molecule donor (SMD) materials have nonnegligible advantages such as well-defined molecular structures, easy purification, and good photovoltaic performance reproducibility.17–21 Currently, the highest PCE achieved by all-small-molecule BHJ OSCs is over 15%.22 Therefore more efforts should be devoted to developing novel high performance SMDs.
From the perspective of molecular design, similar to small molecule acceptors (SMAs), the high-performance SMDs should not only contain moderately coplanar structural units to promote effective π–π stacking, but also need to incorporate some characteristic units that can help reduce molecular aggregation to achieve the fine phase separation domain. The balance between the two strategies is crucial for molecular design.23 For example, in the “star molecule” ITIC,24 the coplanar principal skeleton expands its conjugation, while the protruding alkylbenzene units are used to regulate the molecular aggregation. In addition, the promising Y-series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have also been reported to use side-chain engineering to control intermolecular packing.25–27 Inspired by the above excellent examples, the synergy between the skeleton structure of the large conjugate plane and the characteristic structural unit of the convex part is a practical strategy for molecular design. In addition to the alkyl chain, SF, triphenylamine,28,29 tetraphenylethylene,30 and other units with torsion structures have the characteristics of “protruding out of plane”. Herein, SF is one of the most interesting structural units. In this structure, the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp3-hybridized carbon atom as the center of the spiro-molecule.31SF was originally used as the core of X-shaped four-armed molecules,32–34 and the highest PCE of organic small molecule acceptor materials based on SF-like molecules was about 5%,35 while the highest PCE of small molecule donor materials based on SF as the central core of X-shaped molecules was only about 4%.36 However, it can provide important guidance for constructing two-armed molecules with linear large conjugated planes.23,31,37 Therefore, the construction of two-armed molecules with linear large conjugated planes based on SF will greatly expand the design concept of such photovoltaic materials.
In this work, a series of two-armed narrow band gap donor materials, SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, based on spirobifluorene-diketopyrrolopyrrole (SF-DPP) have been designed and synthesized successfully. The molecular design strategy and chemical structures are demonstrated in Fig. 1(a). Herein, a two-armed extension design strategy is adopted to regulate the photovoltaic properties of the material by introducing ethynyl as the π-bridge and carbazole as the terminal units individually and simultaneously. Taking into account the excellent photoelectric properties and the unique three-dimensional (3D) structure of the SF unit,31 it is adopted as the D core of the molecules designed in this paper. Instead of taking SF as the core of the X-shaped geometry (3D four-armed structure), it was taken as the central unit of the two-armed molecules so that the molecular skeleton could retain the twisted part sticking out of the plane and contribute to the formation of “slip stack”38 aided by two arms, which may be beneficial to improve the molecular stacking morphology. Furthermore, diketopyrrolopyrrole, a dye with a strong electron-withdrawing ability,39,40 was selected to construct the two-armed molecule. Thus, the first A–D–A type molecule SF(DPP)2 was successfully designed as a reference. Based on the reference molecule SF(DPP)2, the two-armed skeleton is further structurally regulated and extended. First, by introducing an ethynyl group as the π-bridge between A and D units, the first target compound SF(aDPP)2 was designed, resulting in a more favorable A–π–D–π–A electron push–pull structure. Then carbazole was added as the terminal D moiety to extend the A–D–A type structure, successfully designing the target molecule SF(DPPCz)2, which not only extends conjugation but also promotes ICT through the D′–A–D–A–D′ structure. In addition, the D′–A–π–D–π–A–D′ type molecule SF(aDPPCz)2 is designed to further extend the two arms of the molecular skeleton by introducing both ethynyl groups as the π-bridge and carbazole units as end groups. Therefore, the four compounds mentioned above have been successfully synthesized and their photoelectric properties need to be studied in detail. Due to their strong intramolecular ICT characteristics, all four compounds exhibit narrow band gaps, indicating a high absorption efficiency for sunlight. Of course, the two compounds SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 with long-arm exhibit broader and stronger optical absorption profiles. Subsequently, the photovoltaic devices using PC71BM as the acceptor and SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 as donors obtained PCEs of 3.43%, 4.96% and 4.39%, respectively. It is particularly worth mentioning that devices based on SF(DPPCz)2/PC71BM achieved a PCE of 8.12%, accompanied by a high Jsc of 19.60 mA cm−2. The results of these preliminary investigations indicate that the two-armed extension design based on SF is a promising strategy for developing novel small molecule donors.

Experimental section
Materials, synthesis and characterization
Most of the reagents used in the experiment were commercially purchased and directly used in the experiments. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) require anhydrous and anaerobic treatment before use with a schlenk line under a nitrogen atmosphere. The synthetic routes of the target compounds are outlined in Fig. 2. Four target products were characterized using 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS). 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer taking TMS as the internal standard and CDCl3 as the solvent. HRMS was determined on a Waters MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. The NMR spectra of the compounds and the synthesis of intermediates are described in the ESI.†

Measurements and calculations
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the materials in CHCl3 solution and in the thin film state were obtained using an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded on a CHI610D electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments, and conducted in a solution of 0.1 M Bu4NBF4/CH2Cl2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was selected as the internal standard. Furthermore, the Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of MeCN), platinum working electrode and platinum wire electrode were chosen as the reference electrode, working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) test was performed on a TA Instruments Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 software with the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected (B3LYP) functional and polarized 6-31G(d) basis to predict the ground state geometries, energy levels, electron-density distribution and optical absorption properties of the materials to be synthesized. The calculation is simplified by reasonably using the methyl group to replace the long alkyl chain in the molecular structure.
Device fabrication and characteristics
The conventional structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/SMDs:PC71BM (or PC61BM)/Al was employed to fabricate solution-processed BHJ photovoltaic devices, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The commercially pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was used as the anode. First, the ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with deionized water, methanol, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol in sequence and then dried in an infrared oven. Then, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass surface at 4000 rpm for 60 s. After thermal annealing at 140 °C for 20 min, the prepared substrate was moved into a glove box filled with nitrogen. The photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend chloroform solution of SMDs:PC71BM (or PC61BM) (9 mg mL−1, 1:2, w/w) on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s. For the preliminarily optimized devices, the additional step is to place the prepared devices in a CH2Cl2 atmosphere for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment of different durations. The aluminium electrode was deposited on the surface of the active layer by thermal evaporation at a vacuum of 10−4 Pa. Finally, eight individual cells were obtained, with a 5 mm2 effective area for each device.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the corresponding devices were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under the simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was tested with a QE-R solar cell omni-directional quantum efficiency measuring instrument. The hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMDs: PC71BM/Au,41 the J–V curves of which were recorded on a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit system in the dark. The hole mobility (μh) was derived by fitting the J–V curve to a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model in a double logarithmic scale according to Mott–Gurney law.42,43
Results and discussion
Theoretical calculations
To our knowledge, theoretical calculations can provide reliable reference data for the molecular design of organic photovoltaic materials.44 Herein, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to predict the ground-state geometries, energy levels, electron-density distribution and optical absorption properties of the target compounds. Based on the results of theoretical calculations, the most promising materials were screened out, and further synthesis and investigation of properties were carried out. The detailed theoretical calculation method is described in the Experimental section and a summary of the theoretical calculations and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), except for the twisted part of the SF unit, all four molecular main skeleton parts can be considered to have the characteristics of linear coplanarity, which is more conducive to π–π stacking to promote charge transfer. Compounds SF(aDPP)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 exhibit better planarity due to their rigid ethynyl group acting as a π-bridge. As shown in Fig. 3(d), for the two molecules SF(DPP)2 and SF(aDPP)2, the delocalization of electrons on the whole main molecular skeleton can be seen at the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). However, for SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, the carbazole unit does not show electron delocalization, and the difference in electron delocalization between the HOMO and LUMO precisely indicates the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics. The calculated HOMO energy levels (HOMODFT) of SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 are −4.81, −4.88, −4.58, and −4.62 eV, and the calculated LUMO energy levels (LUMODFT) are −2.67, −2.77, −2.55, and −2.65 eV, resulting in the corresponding HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (EDFTgs) of 2.14, 2.08, 2.03, and 1.97 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the insertion of an ethynyl group reduces the LUMO and HOMO, and the LUMO decreases more, resulting in a narrower band gap. However, the introduction of a carbazole unit increases the HOMO and LUMO, while the HOMO increases more, which also reduces the band gap.

 Fig. 3  Summary of the theoretical calculations of SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2. (a) Vertical view of the molecular structure; (b) lateral view of the molecular structure; (c) dipole moments of the semi-molecule models; (d) calculated energy levels and electron-density distribution; (e) predicted absorption spectra and electronic transitions. 
The theoretical predicted optical absorption profiles and electronic transitions can be obtained from TD-DFT calculations, as shown in Fig. 3(e), and the detailed electronic transition data are summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.† From the theoretical calculation results, it can be found that as shown in Fig. 3(d), each compound has a broad absorption band, especially for SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2. With the extension of the molecular skeleton, the maximum absorption peaks of the molecule (λmax) are located at 629, 647, 676, and 692 nm respectively, indicating a significant red shift, which is related to the electronic transition from the HOMO to LUMO levels of the molecule. The narrowing of the band gap caused by the extension of the molecular skeleton is consistent with our molecular design strategy. In addition, with the extension of the molecular conjugated skeleton, the optical oscillator strength (f) of SMDs (as shown in Table S1 of the ESI†) gradually increases, which brings about the hyperchromic effect. Furthermore, in order to predict the intermolecular interaction strength between the electron-donating unit and the electron-withdrawing unit, the dipole moment of the semi-molecule was calculated, which affects the stacking behaviour, morphology, and charge transfer properties of the molecules.45–47 As shown in Fig. 3(c), the semi-molecular dipole moment of SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 increases sequentially, with values of 1.52, 1.55, 2.92, and 3.12 D, respectively, indicating an enhanced ICT effect with the extension of the skeleton arms. Theoretical calculations could provide important indications for the design of novel materials, although they are not fully consistent with the experimental data.
Synthesis
The synthetic routes of SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 are outlined in Fig. 2, and the synthetic details of the intermediate are summarized in the ESI.† The designed target compounds SF(DPP)2 and SF(DPPCz)2 were obtained by Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions via compound SF1 with intermediate DPP-Br and CzDPP-Br, which gave a yield of 48% and 54%, respectively. The compounds containing π-bridge SF(aDPP)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 were synthesized by Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions via compound SF2 with intermediate DPP-Br and CzDPP-Br, which gave a yield of 65% and 64%. Intermediate DPP-Br was synthesized according to the procedures of previous reports and literature.48,49 Compound CzDPP-Br was prepared from DPP-Brvia the Suzuki coupling and bromination reaction (ESI†). Compound SF1 was obtained via Miyaura borylation of 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene] and bis(pinacolato)diboron in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and potassium acetate.50 Compound SF2 was prepared from 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-spirobi[fluorene] via the Sonogashira coupling reaction and desilylation reaction.51 The four new materials we have obtained, SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, can be easily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran, which exactly meet the preparation requirements for solution-treated photovoltaic devices.
Spectral absorption properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of this series of new materials in chloroform solution and thin film state are shown in the Fig. 4 and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. In the diluted chloroform solution, SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 exhibit similar absorption spectra, with the maximum absorption peaks located at 593, 587, 637, and 631 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 4  UV-Vis absorption spectra of SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 in CHCl3 solution at a concentration of 10−5 M and the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra in thin film states. 
Compared to SF(DPP)2 and SF(aDPP)2, the absorption spectra of compounds SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 end-capped by carbazole units exhibit a maximum red-shift of over 40 nm due to their extended conjugated backbone. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) increases as the skeleton extends. The insertion of ethynyl units as the π-bridge slightly increases the value of ε. By adding carbazole units as the terminal group, this value has almost doubled. Among them, SF(DPPCz)2 exhibits a higher ε of 1.45 × 105 M−1 cm−1, and SF(aDPPCz)2 possesses the highest ε of 1.67 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is beneficial for absorbing more photons.
However, due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π interaction in the thin film state, the absorption spectra of all four compounds have undergone a red shift. Among these four materials, SF(DPPCz)2 exhibits the broadest absorption, with the two strongest absorption peaks at 690 and 632 nm. SF(aDPPCz)2 also exhibits broad absorption with two strong peaks located at 675 and 623 nm, but the insertion of an ethynyl unit causes a slight blue shift. For the two short-armed compounds in the thin film state, the absorption peaks of SF(DPP)2 are located at 628 nm and 590 nm, while those of SF(aDPP)2 are located at 603 nm and 565 nm. Obviously, the structural design of the ethynyl group also causes a slight blue shift in the spectrum. The onset absorption band edges (λonset) of the four materials SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 are 746, 698, 839, and 810 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.66, 1.78, 1.48, and 1.53 eV, respectively, following the empirical equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry measurement was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the materials. The CV curves and data are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. The HOMOCV/LUMOCV energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox)/the onset reduced potential (Ered).52 From the energy level data, it is inferred that the weak electron-withdrawing ability of the ethynyl π-bridge leads to a slight upshift of LUMOCV and a downshift of HOMOCV. The HOMOCV energy level of SF(aDPP)2 (−5.27 eV) and SF(aDPPCz)2 (−5.07 eV) is slightly lower than the HOMOCV of SF(DPP)2 (−5.25 eV) and SF(DPPCz)2 (−5.06 eV) that could contribute to a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs.53 The apparent upshift of the LUMOCV of SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 could be attributed to the electron-donating ability of carbazole terminals. The changing trend of the electrochemical band gap (ECVg) is consistent with that of Eoptg after structural regulation. In short, the variation trends of energy levels and band gaps of the four molecules obtained from CV experiments and theoretical calculations are basically consistent, indicating that theoretical calculations can provide important help for molecular design.

Photovoltaic properties
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to investigate the thermal stability of the four photovoltaic donor materials. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) are 408 °C for SF(DPP)2, 408 °C for SF(aDPP)2, 415 °C for SF(DPPCz)2 and 300 °C for SF(aDPPCz)2, suggesting their superior thermal stability for photovoltaic devices.

Inset: The J–V characteristics in a double logarithmic scale. 
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the four donors, BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMDs:PC71BM (or PC61BM)/Al. The J–V curves and corresponding data of devices based on SMDs/PC71BM are summarized in Fig. 6(b) and Table 2, while the J–V curves and related data of devices based on SMDs/PC61BM are summarized in Fig. S11 and Table S2 (ESI†). For the devices based on SMDs/PC71BM without any optimization, compared to SF(DPP)2-based devices with a Jsc of 11.91 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.96 V and a PCE of 3.43%, the SF(aDPP)2-based devices achieved a higher Jsc of 15.46 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 1.03 V, resulting in a higher PCE of 4.96%. According to analysis, the stronger absorption of SF(aDPP)2 leads to a higher Jsc of the device, and the higher Voc matches its lower HOMO energy level. The device based on SF(DPPCz)2 with carbazole as the terminal group shows a higher PCE of 6.53% and a higher Jsc of 18.05 mA cm−2. This significantly improved photovoltaic performance is precisely due to the synergistic effect of strong absorption and the narrow band gap of this material. Furthermore, under the treatment of solvent vapor annealing (CH2Cl2-SVA) for 60 seconds, the device based on SF(DPPCz)2 achieves a significant improvement PCE of 8.12% and a relatively high Jsc of 19.60 mA cm−2. Herein, CH2Cl2-SVA treatment has been adopted to optimize the device, which has a pronounced effect on the organic photovoltaic device as reported in the literature.4,41 However, the compound SF(aDPPCz)2 also has a narrow band gap and strong absorption, but the devices based on SF(aDPPCz)2/PC71BM show a PCE of 4.39%. Moreover, the devices based on SF(DPPCz)2/PC61BM and treated with CH2Cl2-SVA also show an excellent PCE of 7.00%, with a Jsc of 17.66 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and an FF of 52.2%. However, the devices based on SF(aDPPCz)2/PC61BM after SVA treatment show a significant improvement in PCE of 6.93%, with a Jsc of 18.24 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V, and an FF of 51.3% (in Table S1 of the ESI†). From the preliminary optimized data, effective CH2Cl2-SVA processing may slightly sacrifice Voc and significantly increases the values of Jsc and FF. Herein, both the devices based on SF(aDPPCz)2/PC61BM and SF(DPPCz)2/PC61BM have increased their PCE values by nearly double after SVA treatment, which is due to the increase in Jsc and FF values. The EQE spectra of the devices based on SMDs/PC71BM are shown in Fig. 6(c). All devices exhibit a strong photoelectric response in the whole range of 300–800 nm. The profiles are basically consistent with the UV-vis absorption curves. It is particularly worth mentioning that the EQE curves of the devices based on SF(DPPCz)2 are significantly enhanced and broadened at long wavelengths after SVA treatment, which is the reason for the significant increase in Jsc and PCE.

The μh measurement of the devices was conducted by fabricating hole-only devices with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.42,43 The μh of the SMDs/PC71BM blend film was derived by fitting the J–V curves in a double logarithmic scale, as depicted in Fig. 6(d) and summarized in Table 2. The μh values of SMDs/PC71BM based devices prepared without any optimization are 3.70 × 10−5, 3.79 × 10−5, 3.07 × 10−4, and 2.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, respectively. By contrast, the devices based on SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2, which are materials with long-armed containing carbazole as terminal groups, have achieved higher μh values. Compared to their values, they are nearly 10 times higher than those of the relatively short-armed materials. It is particularly worth mentioning that the device based on SF(DPPCz)2/PC71BM optimized by the CH2Cl2-SVA process achieves a significantly improved μh value of 8.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This indicates that SF(DPPCz)2 exhibits excellent hole transport properties, which is why it shows the highest Jsc and PCE in this series of materials.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel two-armed molecules SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2 with spirobifluorene as the core have been successfully designed and synthesized to study the relationship between the molecular structure and photoelectric properties. An ethynyl π-bridge and carbazole end-groups are introduced into the molecular skeleton individually or simultaneously to extend the conjugation of the two arms of the molecules. With the benefit of the strong push–pull interaction between D and A, all four molecules possess narrow band gaps, 1.42, 1.56, 1.47 and 1.49 eV, respectively for SF(DPP)2, SF(aDPP)2, SF(DPPCz)2 and SF(aDPPCz)2. As the most important result, the devices based on SF(DPPCz)2/PC71BM exhibit the highest PCE of 8.12% under CH2Cl2-SVA treatment due to the broad and strong absorption caused by the narrow band gap molecular design, which is the highest PCE reported so far for SF-based SMDs, accompanied by the strongest and broadest photoelectric response in the EQE curve and the highest μh value. In addition, the devices based on another promising candidate SF(aDPPCz)2 reach an equally impressive PCE of 6.93% after CH2Cl2-SVA treatment. Overall, this work provides an innovative molecular design method extending from the two arms of molecules containing X-shaped nuclei to develop efficient two-armed linear small molecule photovoltaic donor materials. The research results also demonstrate that the two-armed extension design based on SF is a promising strategy to develop excellent small molecule photovoltaic materials.
