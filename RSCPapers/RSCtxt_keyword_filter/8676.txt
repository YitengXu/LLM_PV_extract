    , Accepted 20th November 2013First published on 19th December 2013AbstractThe effectiveness of the 1D nanorod (NR)-planted 3D inverse opal (IO) structure as an electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is demonstrated here. The NRs were grown on the surface of a macroporous IO structure and their longitudinal growth increased the surface area of the structure proportional to the growth duration. NR/IO electrodes with various NR growth times were compared. A remarkable JSC was obtained for the DSSCs utilizing a NR/IO electrode. The improvement of the JSC was analyzed in terms of its efficiency in light harvesting and electron transport. The growth of the NRs improved the dye adsorption density and scattering property of the electrode, resulting in an improvement in the light harvesting efficiency. Electrochemical impedance analysis revealed that the NRs also improved its electron transport properties. Further growth of the NRs tended to limit the increase of the JSC, which could be attributed to an overlap between them.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered to be the next generation of photo-electrochemical devices due to their low cost and relatively high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.1,2 A conventional electrode is typically comprised of randomly packed TiO2 nanoparticles, which possess a large specific area. This allows for a high adsorption density of the dye sensitized molecules, leading to a high photoelectron density of the DSSCs under operation.2 However, these particulate electrodes provide a random pathway with multiple instances of trapping and de-trapping, slowing down electron diffusion and resulting in the high possibility of an electron recombination reaction and the loss of collection efficiency.2,3
This has encouraged the use of high-aspect ratio morphologies such as nanotubes, nanowires, or nanofibers as an electrode material.4–10 Moreover, macroscopically ordered structures such as nanowire arrays or inverse opal structures have been used as the electrode film itself.11–15 The nanotube array electrode was found to have charge recombination 10 times slower than that of the particulate film.4 The use of nanofibers improved the electron diffusion length compared to the particle morphology.10,16 In the case of inverse opal structures, the recombination lifetime was measured to be 6 times faster.14 However, many of these studies revealed a lower photocurrent and thereby conversion efficiency compared to the particulate film, which was attributed mainly to the lower specific area of these morphologies. Recently, the combination of TiO2 nanoparticles with high-aspect ratio particles or ordered morphologies has provided a facile approach for synergy.3,17–21 For example, nanoparticle decoration on TiO2 nanotubes resulted in a high surface area on account of the nanoparticles and an enhanced diffusion coefficient on account of the nanotubes; this improved photocurrent and efficiency by up to 2 times.18,22 The location of the nanoparticle decoration has also been controlled and the top-selective decoration on the nanotube array was found to effectively enhance the charge collection efficiency.23 Our group also examined the effect of TiO2 nanoparticle deposition on the surface of IO structures and found that the photocurrent density increased by around 3 times.21
In this study, the effectiveness of the combination of 1D nanorods (NRs) and 3D inverse opal (IO) TiO2 structures as a photo-electrode for DSSCs is demonstrated. The 1D NRs were grown inside the confined geometry of the macroporous IO structure. It was found that the growth of the NRs offered a unique advantage, namely that they enhanced electron transport as well as the specific area; this is distinguishable from the nanoparticle deposition mentioned previously. A remarkable improvement of the photocurrent density to 14.84 mA cm−2 was obtained with a photon-to-electric conversion efficiency of 6.3% under 1 sun illumination.
2. Experimental
Preparation of the nanorod (NR)/inverse opal (IO) structure
Monodispersed polystyrene (PS) colloids were synthesized by dispersion polymerization, as reported elsewhere.24 Briefly, the styrene monomer (Aldrich, 99%) was polymerized using a 2,2-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) initiator (1 wt% of the monomer) and 0.25 mM polyvinylpyrrolidone (Aldrich, MW 40k), yielding latex spheres with 780 nm diameter. The PS particles were dispersed in a water–ethanol mixture (10% v/v water) and assembled onto the FTO substrate. The TiO2 aqueous colloidal suspension (average particle size of 15 nm, Nanoamor Inc.) was then infiltrated into the PS colloidal crystals. The samples were heat-treated at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the PS templates. TiO2 NRs were grown using the hydrothermal approach. A standard procedure was followed in which 0.3 M of titanium n-butoxide (Aldrich) in a mixture of 37 wt% HCl and distilled water (1:1 v/v) was prepared as a reactant. A stainless steel autoclave (110 mL capacity) with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) liner was utilized. The autoclave reactor was heated to 160 °C by placing it in a convection oven. Several reaction times were used (2 h, 4 h, and 6 h) to obtain NRs of a variety of lengths. After the reaction, the reactor was placed outside and was allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. The sample was calcined in air at 450 °C for 30 minutes.
Assembly of the DSSCs
The NR/IO films were immersed for 20 h in a dye solution containing 0.5 mM N719 dye (Dyesol Inc.) in anhydrous ethanol (Aldrich). The film was scraped to have a surface area of around 10 mm2. The counter electrode was prepared by applying a 0.7 mM H2PtCl6 solution coating in anhydrous ethanol to the FTO substrate. The NR/IO electrode was assembled with the counter electrode. The gap distance between electrodes was fixed at 60 μm using a polymeric film spacer (Surlyn, DuPont). The electrolyte solution was then injected into the gap between the two electrodes. The redox couple/electrolyte solution contained 0.05 M LiI (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M I2 (Yakuri), 0.7 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GSCN) (Wako), in a solution of acetonitrile (Aldrich) and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v).
Instruments and characterization
In order to estimate the quantity of N719 dye molecules, the dye adsorbed on the electrode was detached in 0.1 M NaOH water–ethanol solution overnight, and the absorption intensity of the dye solution was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V550). The morphologies were studied by FE-SEM (Hitachi). The photocurrent and voltage of the DSSCs were measured using a Source Meter (Keithley Instruments). These measurements were performed under simulated solar illumination produced using a 150 W Xe lamp (Peccell) and AM1.5G filters. The intensity was adjusted using a Si reference cell (BS-520, Bunko-Keiki) to a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic data were obtained by taking a representative value of three different cells. The electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded using a potentiostat (Versastat, AMETEK) under 1 sun illumination and open-circuit conditions. The frequency range explored in the impedance measurements was 105 to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show typical SEM images of the 3D IO TiO2 and NR/IO TiO2 structures. The TiO2 NRs were grown on the surface of a macroporous IO structure using a hydrothermal reaction in a titanium n-butoxide precursor solution at 160 °C. It was found that a nucleation seed was required (see Fig. 1s†), and this was obtained by treating the TiO2 IO in a TiCl4 solution for 45 min at 70 °C before growing the NRs. The inset image of Fig. 1(a) shows a seed particle deposited on the surface of the TiO2 IO structure. A confinement effect on NR growth caused by the IO structure was noted: compared to a planar substrate (see Fig. 1s†), NRs with smaller diameters were grown on the IO structure. This could be attributed to limited mass transport of the precursor solution into the porous IO structure. From Fig. 1(c), it can be seen that the TiO2 NRs grew radially from the seed. In the TEM image (Fig. 1(d)), the NRs display crystalline rutile TiO2 morphology and lattices. The inter-plane distance is 0.32 nm, which corresponds to the lattice spacing of the rutile TiO2 (110) facet.25 The growth of rutile TiO2 NRs was also confirmed by XRD measurements (Fig. 2s†).

The TiO2 NR growth time was manipulated to be 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, and the corresponding NRs are shown from left to right in Fig. 2(a), respectively. As the growth time increased, the TiO2 NRs grew longitudinally from a seed and filled up the macropores of the IO structure. The lengths of the NRs were 250 ± 20 nm for 2 h, 400 ± 15 nm for 4 h, and 600 ± 20 nm for 6 h. For 6 h, the majority of macropores were filled by NRs. The longitudinal growth of NRs appears to be superior to nanoparticle deposition. Growing nanoparticles can overlap, which tends to flatten the surface. Therefore, an increase in the surface area with increasing deposition time is ultimately limited (see Fig. 2(b)). Previously, nanoparticle growth on the IO structure not only doubled the surface area but also saturated it and so no further increase was possible;21 however, longitudinal growth is independent of the growth of neighboring NRs. Thus, the surface area can be proportionally increased with the deposition time without being limited by overlapping particles. Fig. 2(c) shows the areal density of dye adsorption for bare IO and NR/IO films with the corresponding growth times. The dye adsorption was proportional to the growth time. The NR/IO structure obtained under the 6 h growth conditions possessed a specific area 4 times larger than that of a bare IO structure. This remarkable increase in specific area can enhance the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs utilizing NR/IO electrodes.

The NR/IO structure was also used as an electrode for DSSCs. The NR/IO TiO2 film was sensitized using N719 dye, and then assembled with a Pt-coated counter electrode and an iodide electrolyte. A bare IO was also prepared for comparison. Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs under 1-sun illumination under the AM1.5 conditions. Table 1 lists the J–V parameters measured for the DSSCs, including the Jsc (short-circuit current), Voc (open circuit voltage), FF (fill factor), and the calculated overall conversion efficiency (η).

As the growth time of the NRs increased, the Jsc tended to increase, resulting in the increase in efficiency. Notably, the Jsc of the NR/IO_4 h electrode was twice as high as the bare IO electrode. This photocurrent density is the highest measured for IO-based electrodes reported so far.15,21 The efficiency of the NR/IO electrode was 6.37%, which is 170% higher than a bare IO electrode. We characterized this remarkable enhancement of the Jsc by comparing the IO and NR/IO_4 h electrodes. The Jsc is related to the efficiencies in light harvesting (ηlh), charge injection (ηinj), and charge collection (ηcc) expressed by the following equation:Jsc = qI0ηlhηccηinjwhere q and I0 are the elementary charge and the incident light intensity, respectively.26 First, ηlh was primarily determined by the dye adsorption density and the light scattering performance of the electrode film. The presence of NRs slightly improved the scattering performance in the visible light wavelength by approximately 10%, as shown in Fig. 3b. Regarding dye adsorption, the NR/IO_4 h film was found to have an adsorption density 3.1 times higher than that of the bare film. The increase in dye adsorption density moderately increases the Jsc as its loss by recombination also increases with the surface area. Previously, the incremental ratio of Jsc/surface area (or dye adsorption density) was in the range of 0.4–0.6.4 Using this ratio, the contribution of the surface area in the presence of NRs is calculated to enhance the Jsc by approximately 1.2–1.9 times. The ηinj values of the N719-sensitized NR/IO electrode and the bare IO electrode were assumed to be the same since the NR and IO have a rutile TiO2 crystallinity. This implies that the additional enhancement of the Jsc by 10–80% may be attributed to a higher ηcc.
The ηcc was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shown in Fig. 4a. The equivalent circuit developed by J. Bisquert (Fig. 4b) was used to characterize the charge transport resistance (Rt) through the TiO2 electrode, charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the TiO2 electrodes.27,28 These values are listed in Table 2. The Cμ of the NR/IO electrode was higher than the IO electrode and Cμ increased with the growth time. Since the higher Cμ implies a higher electron density in the TiO2 film, this result confirms that a longer growth time corresponds to a higher dye adsorption density for the NR/IO film.29 The ηcc was calculated using the following equation,ηcc = 1 − Rt/Rct

The resultant ηcc of the NR/IO_4 h electrode was 96%, which was around 13% higher compared to that of the IO electrode, satisfying the range of ηcc estimated above. The increase in ηcc was mainly attributed to the decrease in Rt; the Rt of the NR/IO_4 h electrode was only 16% that of the IO electrode. This implies that the NR morphology lowers the overall electron transport resistance of the NR/IO electrode. In summary, the higher Jsc of the NR/IO electrode was attributed to the synergy of the light harvesting efficiency and the electron collection efficiency facilitated by the presence of NRs.
On the other hand, the Jsc decreased for the NR/IO_6 h electrode. Comparing the NR/IO_6 h electrode to the NR/IO_4 h electrode, the dye adsorption density of the former was 130% higher and its scattering was also higher; however, as shown in Table 2, the ηcc of the NR/IO_6 h electrode decreased. Thus, the high ηlh of the NR/IO_6 h electrode was negated by the lower ηcc. The decrease in ηcc was due to the increase in Rt and the decrease in Rct. This implies that NRs grown for 6 h impaired electron transport in the NR/IO electrode. In the NR/IO_6 h film (see Fig. 2a), the NRs were fully covered and therefore overlapped one another. This could have created a defect at the overlapping areas and complicated the electron transport path.
4. Conclusion
The use of a combination of 1D NRs and 3D IO TiO2 structures for a DSSC electrode was examined. The NRs were hydrothermally grown on the surface of an as-prepared IO structure. The macropores of the IO structure provided sufficient space for the NRs to grow. As the growth time increased from 2–6 h, the longitudinal growth of the NRs effectively increased the surface area upto a maximum of 4 times the surface area of a bare IO structure, obtained under a growth time of 6 hours. The NR/IO structure was tested as an electrode for use in DSSCs. The NR/IO electrode displayed a high improvement in its Jsc; the NR/IO_4 h electrode showed a photocurrent of 14.84 mA cm−2 and a resulting efficiency of 6.38%. We analyzed the improvement of the Jsc with the growth of the NRs by characterizing the efficiency as related to light harvesting and electron transport. Compared to a bare IO electrode, ηlh was around 180% higher due to an increase in the surface area and improved scattering properties. Moreover, the ηcc was further enhanced by 13% as the NRs facilitated electron transport. We believe that the NR/IO structure could extend their applications to various photoelectrochemical materials including photocatalyst, sensor, and water splitting due to their high photocurrent generation ability. Moreover, a connected and well-defined pore network may provide advantages for the device using a solid or quasi-solid electrolyte.
