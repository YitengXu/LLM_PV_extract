    , Accepted 9th October 2013First published on 14th October 2013AbstractThe good electrical and morphological characteristics of TiO2 nanofibers and the high extinction coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite are combined to obtain a solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 9.8%. The increase of the film thickness dramatically diminishes the performance due to the reduction in porosity of the TiO2 nanofiber framework. The optimum device (∼413 nm film thickness) is compared to a planar device, where the latter produces higher Voc but lower Jsc, and consequently lower efficiency at all measured light intensities.
Introduction
Solid state perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells have invoked a tremendous amount of scientific and commercial interest as they have several advantages such as ease of fabrication, cost effectiveness, and high efficiency.1–5 Generally, a mesoscopic film of TiO2 nanoparticles (acting as an electron transporter) is used as a host to load the perovskite pigments. Other approaches employ Al2O3 and ZrO2 which primarily act as a scaffold and don't indulge in electron transport to replace TiO2 nanoparticles.4,6 Replacing TiO2 nanoparticles with one dimensional (1-D) nanostructures7 has been shown to facilitate the pore filling of viscous materials.2,8 Moreover, one-dimensional nanostructures were reported to exhibit better charge transport and lower recombination than the nanoparticles in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC).7,9,10 Electrospinning is a simple, inexpensive technique by which one dimensional nanofibers can be synthesized.10–14 Such long, interconnected nanofibers have been utilized as a substitute for the mesoporous nanoparticles in DSCs.15–17 Though the nanofibers exhibited several advantages over nanoparticles in terms of charge transport and reduced charge recombination,10,18 they suffered from being limited by the film thickness when spun directly on conducting substrates. Thicker films (>2 μm) undergo shrinkage leading to delamination from the substrate. Additionally, the formation of cracks is predominant when the composite film is sintered to remove the organic precursors and to attain the crystalline semiconductor. In contrast, DSCs with thinner electrospun films suffer from poor absorption cross-section due to the low surface area, which leads to poor light harvesting when conventional dyes with low extinction coefficients are employed.19,20 In order to satisfy the light harvesting criterion, two approaches can be employed; one is to increase the film thickness. For this purpose, several researchers employed additional steps to make pastes from the electrospun nanofibers and then obtain thick photoanodes by either screen printing or by spincoating.21 Though this method improves the light harvesting, it does not benefit from the charge transport advantages associated with the 1-D nanofibers.22 The second approach employs sensitizers with high light absorption coefficients. In this sense, CH3NH3PbI3 (an organic–inorganic halide perovskite) is a suitable sensitizer whose absorption coefficient is 1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm (an order of magnitude higher than the conventional Ru based dyes).23 Thus, coupling the high absorption coefficient of the perovskite material and the good charge transport properties and porous structure of the nanofibers is a route towards high photovoltaic performance through a non-expensive process. More recently, the implementation of the sequential deposition protocol (loading PbI2 within the pores and subsequent transformation into CH3NH3PbI3)1 results in a higher loading of the absorber. As a consequence, this ensures an increase of the light harvesting efficiency.
In this paper TiO2 nanofibers directly electrospun on TiO2 compact layer are combined with a sequentially deposited perovskite to fabricate solar cells with efficiencies of 9.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency obtained with such electrospun TiO2 nanofibers. The effect of different nanofiber film thickness is investigated in contrast to a planar device.
Experimental
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, <14 ohm per square, 2.2 mm thick) substrates were first etched with Zn powder and hydrochloric (HCl) acid (4 M) to form the desired pattern, which was subsequently cleaned with decon soap solution and ethanol, respectively. Then, a thin compact layer of TiO2 referred to as the blocking layer, which is about 80–100 nm, was deposited by aerosol spray-pyrolysis at 450 °C using ambient air as a carrier gas.24 Also, these substrates were immersed in 40 mM of TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol. Some of these substrates were used for fabricating the cells and are referred to as “planar” devices. For spray-pyrolysis a solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol) and absolute ethanol was used in the ratio 1:9 by volume. Then, the substrates were calcined at 500 °C for 30 min. For the synthesis of nanofibers (NF), a sol–gel solution comprising of 0.8 g PVP (Mw = 1300000), 4 g titanium(IV) butoxide (97%), 1.18 g acetyl acetone (≥99%) in 10 mL methanol was prepared and was electrospun at 25 kV with a feed-rate of 0.3 mL h−1 using the NANON (MECC) electrospinning setup. The nanofibers were collected on the blocking layer deposited FTO substrates which were placed on a metallic collecting plate of electrospinning setup. Then, the composite mat of nanofibers was calcined at 450 °C in a box furnace for 5 h to remove the organic components and to get crystalline TiO2 nanofibers. Then, the nanofibers were subjected to 0.1 M TiCl4 treatment for about 12 h at 40 °C followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min.
An organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3)PbI3 was deposited by a sequential method as reported in the literature.1 Lead iodide (1 M) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide overnight under stirring conditions at 70 °C and was spincoated on the planar substrates as well as on the nanofiber substrates at 6000 r.p.m for 5 s. These substrates were then dried for 30 min at 70 °C. Subsequently the films were dipped in a 10 mg mL−1 solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol for approx. 20 min. Then, the films were rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min.
An organic hole conductor, namely spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamined) 9,9′-spirobifluorene), was dissolved in chlorobenzene (120 mg mL−1) and spincoated on these substrates. Additives like Li (CF3SO2)2, N,tert-butylpyridine and FK102 dopant were added to the above solution.1,25 The masked substrates were placed in a thermal evaporator for gold (Au) deposition via shadow masking. The thickness of the Au electrode was about 80 nm and the active area was defined by the overlap of TiO2 and Au (0.2 cm2). During measurements, samples were masked using a black tape 0.25 cm2 in dimension, to prevent the stray currents generated away from the active area.
Characterization
Top view and cross-sectional images were recorded by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-7600F, 5 kV). Photocurrent–voltage measurements were measured using San-EI Electric, XEC-301S under AM 1.5 G. For light intensity dependence studies, UV Fused Silica Metallic Neutral Density Filters (Newport Corporation) were used. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using PVE300 (Bentham), with a dual xenon/quartz halogen light source, measured in DC mode and no bias light is used. Incident light intensity was calibrated using a photodiode detector (silicon calibrated detector, Newport).
Results and discussion
The device architecture of the nanofiber-based perovskite cell is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this device configuration, the mesoporous nanofibers replace the mesoporous nanoparticles used in conventional perovskite solar cells.1 The electrospinning conditions, such as solution viscosity and deposition voltage, have been carefully tailored in order to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with a suitable diameter to achieve both a good perovskite loading and optimum charge transport properties.

A diameter of 120–200 nm presents good electrical advantages10 and an excellent porous network (see Fig. S1(b)†), in contrast to smaller diameter ones which are less continuous (Fig. S1(a)†), and larger diameter ones which form more closed structures (Fig. S1(c)†) resulting in lesser absorber loading.
In addition to porosity, the total thickness of the formed film also has a critical effect on the cell performance.1,2,26 In this respect, the photovoltaic characteristics for different nanofiber film thickness are illustrated in Fig. 2 and tabulated in Table 1.

The optimal thickness of nanofiber films to achieve the best cell performance is about 413 nm. With thicker films of 844 nm and 1215 nm, Voc dropped to 0.78 V and 0.74 V, respectively. This is probably due to a higher recombination rate in the thicker films, due to the increase in surface area and the consequent increase of trap assisted recombination in TiO2 films.2,27 This higher recombination is also expressed as an early onset of the dark current for thicker TiO2 films. However, the most dramatic reduction is in the short circuit current densities, which drop drastically for increasing TiO2 thicknesses. This is in contrast to the classical DSC behavior where an increase of the film drives an increase of the current.27,28 Overlapping of the nanofibers in thicker films leads to a closure of the pores (Fig. S2†). This results in the lower loading of the perovskite within thick films, leading to significantly lower light absorption (Fig. S3†).
Given the limitation of the technique and the diameter of the optimum fibers, homogenous films thinner than 413 nm are not viable. Therefore, planar devices were fabricated to compare its performance.
When spun on the films, PbI2 adopts the nanofibers' porous and rough topography (Fig. 3(a)). The cross-section image (inset of Fig. 3(a)) reveals that the top surface with PbI2 is rough. However it is also evident from the inset of Fig. 3(a) as well as from EDX mapping (Fig. S4†), that the PbI2 has infiltrated throughout the depth of the fiber film.

The Au detachment is an after effect of the mechanical cleaving. 
In contrast, PbI2 loaded directly on top of the TiO2 compact layer to form the planar device (described in Experimental section, Fig. 3(b)), forms a smooth and compact topography. In this case, from the cross-section image which is shown in the inset, it is difficult to confirm the distribution of PbI2 on the blocking layer. When the PbI2 loaded nanofibers are immersed in CH3NH3I solution, CH3NH3I was able to seep through the pores and make contact with PbI2 leading to complete transformation to (CH3NH3) PbI3 within the photoanode. In the case of the planar device, it was observed that the formation of the perovskite is incomplete as the insertion of CH3NH3I might be hampered by the compactness of the PbI2 film (Fig. S5(b)†). This may call for the need to immerse the planar devices for a longer time in the IPA solution, but it was observed that such action only resulted in the dissolution of the lead iodide in the solution itself. This phenomenon has also been observed by Burschka et al.1
In Fig. 3(c), the cross-sectional view of the complete nanofiber device is shown, with a film thickness of 413 nm. Owing to the rough morphology of the fibers, the rough surface topography required a higher concentration of spiro-OMeTAD (120 mg mL−1) to avoid short-circuiting of the device. For comparative study, the same conditions have been followed for the planar device, From Fig. 3(c) and (d), it is observed that under similar spiro deposition conditions, the spiro overlayer thickness is different in both the nanofiber and planar devices. The thinner spiro overlayer in the case of the nanofiber can be attributed to a higher roughness and wetting, which results in a better coverage of spiro through the mesoporous nanofiber film, forming a good contact between the TiO2–perovskite–spiro interfaces.
The photovoltaic characteristics (J–V plots) of the devices fabricated on nanofiber and planar are presented in Fig. 4(a). The photovoltaic parameters as obtained are tabulated in Table 2. Clearly, the nanofiber based perovskite cell has exceedingly high efficiency (9.82%) compared to the planar (η = 3.11%) device. The 413 nm thick mesoporous nanofiber film enables more loading of the perovskite material as compared to the compact structure of the planar device. This effect is reflected in terms of the higher Jsc: 15.88 mA cm−2 for the nanofiber device while the planar device exhibits only 4.02 mA cm−2. The Voc of the nanofiber devices dropped in comparison to the planar devices. This is expected since the trap-assisted recombination will be lower for the latter, following the same trend observed in the nanofiber devices with different film thickness. Additionally, direct injection of charges from the perovskite to the compact layer can reduce the voltage drop as has been seen in non-injecting devices.29

The high Jsc of the nanofiber devices is also validated by the IPCE action spectra shown in Fig. 4(b). The Jsc calculated from the IPCE data concurs well with the Jsc calculated from the J–V plots, tabulated in Table 2, and the shape of the IPCE spectrum for nanofiber devices is in good agreement with the shapes reported for nanoparticle devices in the literature.1
However, there is a slight discrepancy with the shape of the IPCE spectrum for planar devices in the wavelength region of 350–650 nm as seen in Fig. 4(b), where there is depression instead of a peak. This depression could be due to light absorption by the untransformed PbI2 (Fig. S5(b)†). The photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, η) of the nanofiber and planar devices as a function of light intensity are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Short circuit current density showed linear dependence on light flux and this behavior is in agreement with the literature.7 The linear behavior of short circuit current density with light intensity demonstrates that charge collection efficiency is independent of light intensity.
The nanofiber devices systematically show higher short circuit current densities and higher power conversion efficiencies compared to planar devices at all light intensities. Remarkably, the nanofiber cell yielded 11.79% photo electrochemical conversion efficiency at 0.1 sun while the planar device yielded 3.03%. Further avenues to improve the efficiency could involve the use of better dopants, such as FK209, which could further reduce charge recombination.1,25
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have employed electrospun nanofibers as a photoanode for efficient perovskite solar cells. Efficiencies of 9.8% (11.79% at 0.1 sun) are obtained which to our knowledge is the first report in this configuration. The efficiencies are mainly determined by the open porosity of the electrospun nanofiber network which varies with TiO2 nanofiber photoanode thicknesses and fiber diameters. Despite the more open structure provided by the planar devices, poor PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 conversion hinders the efficiencies.
