    , Accepted 9th January 2023First published on 10th January 2023AbstractPrinting is one industrially compatible scalable method for the preparation of perovskite thin films but suffers from a low nucleation rate that causes an inferior crystal quality. In this work, we applied a slot-die coating method to deposit a MA-free perovskite thin film with a subsequently introduced FA+ replenishment to induce a second growth and prepare a FA-rich film. As a result, the inverted perovskite mini-module reached an efficiency of 17.56% with an aperture area of 60.84 cm2.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a rapidly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) have attracted enormous attention in the past decade. To date, the certified PCE of solution-processed PSCs has reached 25.7%.1–3 However, all top-performing PSCs were prepared by a spin coating method and operated on a nearly 0.1 cm2 active area, which are unsuitable for scalable module fabrication. Significant progress has been made in the high throughput continuous fabrication of perovskite thin films in recent years, and the PCEs of mini-modules are constantly being improved.4–9 Deng et al. reported a 30 cm2 mini-module with an aperture area PCE of 18.6% using blade coating, and Bu et al. obtained a PCE of 20.42% with an active area of 17.1 cm2 using slot-die coating,4,8 which suggests that a large PCE deficit still needs to be eliminated for a scalable fabrication of a perovskite module.
Anti-solvent extraction provides a picky strategy to obtain a perfect intermediate phase in the spin-coating process, where a rapid supersaturation of the precursor solution can be reached and the nucleation takes place in a very short time, providing seed crystals for the growth of a compact polycrystalline thin film with low bulk defects.10 Passivation of defects at the film surface has been proved to be quite effective when the charge recombination inside bulk is negligible.11,12 As a result, the optimization guiding direction that improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) without sacrificing the short-circuit current density (JSC) has been widely adopted to improve PSC efficiencies.13 However, in the printing counterparts, the concentration of wet film is relatively low, resulting in the minimum concentration for nucleation will take more time despite gas quenching and/or vacuum quenching process being applied. A low nucleation rate leads to an inferior crystal quality and further influences the carrier diffusion distance.14JSC will show a decline if the carriers cannot be collected effectively when the diffusion distance is smaller than the film thickness. This may be the reason why the thickness of perovskite thin films prepared by the printing method is often less than 500 nm in many reports.15,16 Therefore, the preparation of a high-quality perovskite thin film and, meanwhile, improving the JSC is crucial to achieve high efficiency printed PSCs when considered the surface defects that have already been well passivated.
As a matter of fact, the efficiency of PSCs has increased from 22% to 25.7% over the past few years, with a significant contribution coming from an increased JSC. In the early days of PSCs, the JSC rarely exceeded 24 mA cm−2 when methylamine lead halide (MAPbX3) was prevalent. Subsequently, the formamidinium cation (FA+) was introduced to partially or completely replace MA+ for the purpose of broadening the absorption spectrum and improving JSC without sacrificing VOC.13 The higher the FA+ content, the more significant the JSC increase, and can even surpass 26 mA cm−2. However, although FAPbI3 PSC possesses the highest theoretical JSC, the phase stability is poor. FA1−xCsxPbX3 was supposed to balance the trade-off between bandgap, phase stability and thermal stability, whereas FA-rich perovskites still tend to produce a impurity phase during the phase transition at a low temperature.17,18 As mentioned above, the printed perovskite thin film undergoes a long phase transition, which is not conducive to the direct preparation of high-quality FA-rich perovskite thin films.
In this work, we use FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 with a 7.5% PbCl2 addition for an initial film prepared by a slot-die coating method. Although the FA1−xCsxPbI3 (0.05 < x < 0.17) is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, it is still necessary to inhibit the formation of the photoinactive δ-phase at the beginning of the preparation, since the δ-phase perovskite reduces the film quality and is not easily converted into the α-phase even after subsequent annealing. Reducing the FA+ content and introducing PbCl2 into the perovskite precursor inks have been proved to be significantly effective.8

Fig. 1(a) is a schematic diagram of printing the perovskite inks by using a slot-die coating followed by N2 blowing for a wet film nucleation. According to the analysis of the LaMer model, the number of nuclei should be increased during a short period at the early stage of wet film drying and the crystal growth rate should be slowed down, which is favorable to prepare a uniform and dense perovskite thin film.10 However, large amounts of PbI2 are concentrated on the film surface with ternary sources from the excessive addition of Pb2+, volatilization of FACl and high temperature (150 °C) annealing. As shown in Fig. 1(c), PbI2 with a poor electrical conductivity appears bright in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image.19 The X-ray diffraction pattern shows a towering PbI2 peak located at 12.74°, a relatively low intensity peak at 14.8° that is associated to an α-phase perovskite (110) plane (Fig. 1(h)). Ever-increasing reports have demonstrated that excessive PbI2 degrades the long-term stability and also causes parasitic absorption.20 In addition, the in situ PL measurement that monitors the formation dynamic of perovskite films shows a redshift of the PL peaks of the intermediate perovskite and the difference of the PL peaks between the intermediate phase and final phase (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating the importance of growth dynamics control of the perovskite thin films as the phase transition depends on the imposition of the process conditions. In this work, we first prepared a PbI2-residual perovskite film, aiming to obtain a pure α phase perovskite without demanding conditions. Subsequently, FAI post-treatment was applied to react with the PbI2 and compensate for the component deficiencies (Fig. 1(b)). The different concentrations (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) of the FAI treatment were denoted as FAIx (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8). The diffraction peak intensity of PbI2 decreased along with the FAI concentration increase, and disappeared when the concentration was 4 mg mL−1 (Fig. 1(h)), indicating that the components in the film are close to the stoichiometric ratio. It can also be found that the perovskite film undergoes Ostwald ripening secondary growth after the FAI replenishment, with an increased perovskite diffraction peak intensity (Fig. 1(h)) and the grain size becomes larger (Fig. 1(c–g)). This can be attributed to the reaction between residual PbI2 and replenished FAI, as well as to the decrease of surface free energy due to the organic FA cation anchored to the void of the corner-sharing PbI64− octahedron.21 Lattice expansion also occurred with the formation of perovskite from the surface residual PbI2, leading to the thickness of perovskite film increasing from 360 nm to 410 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The absorbance of the film increased with the introduction of FAI, and the increase slowed down when the FAI concentration was greater than 4 mg mL−1 (Fig. 1(i)). In addition, the stoichiometric ratio tended to FA increasing in the film and the absorption edge red shifted with the replenishment of FAI, which is of benefit as it improves the JSC. We also performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to evaluate the roughness of the perovskite film surface. From the 2D tapping-mode AFM height images (5 × 5 μm) shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the FAI4 film (17.0 nm) is bigger than that of the FAI0 film (14.0 nm), which is associated to the enlarged grains.

The PSCs with FA replenishment contributed to improving the PCEs due to a significant increase in JSC, as can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (d). The improvement of JSC can be divided into four parts according to the analysis of external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2(e)): (I) in the range from 300 to 540 nm, a decrease of optical parasitism of wide-gap PbI2; (II) in the range from 540 to 700 nm, a reduction in the recombination of the internal film due to the improved film quality; (III) in the range from 700 to 760 nm, an increase of film thickness and an improvement of the back-electrode contact interface; (IV) above 760 nm, the widened light absorption range. In addition, the red shift of the interference standing wave peak also reflects the thickness increase caused by the secondary growth of the film. Finally, the optimized FAI concentration is 4 mg mL−1 after trade-off with the efficiency and phase stability. The champion device yielded a PCE of 20.17% (reverse scan), with a JSC of 22.88 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.11 V, and FF of 0.80. Additionally, the PSC shows a quite small hysteresis effect as the PCE from the forward scan is 19.25%, with a JSC of 22.73%, VOC of 1.09 V, and FF of 0.77 (Fig. 2(f)). The stabilized power output (SPO) performance of the FAI post-treated PSC was recorded at a forward bias of 0.9 V and achieved a stabilized PCE of 19.1% without an obvious decline within 500 s (Fig. S4, ESI†). We tested the thermal stability at 85 °C of the PSCs with and without FA cation replenishment. All the PSCs showed a relatively serious burn-in in the first period followed by a slow decaying period or a steady period. Specially, the PSCs with FA cation replenishment showed an enhanced thermal stability as they maintained 77.13% of their initial efficiency after heating for 1150 h while the value was 47.68% for the pristine PSCs (Fig. S5, ESI†).

In addition to the improvement of the optical properties with the FA cation replenishment strategy, the change in the electrical properties of the perovskite thin films and devices also plays a crucial role in carrier separation and transport. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out to investigate how the bands energy aligns in the solar cell. The work functions of the pristine perovskite and with FA cation replenishment show a small shift from 4.34 eV to 4.25 eV (Fig. 3(a)), while the low binding energy cut-offs shift from 1.23 eV to 1.73 eV, indicating the more n type nature of the film in combination with their band gap. By converting the EQE curves, we can obtain the bandgaps of perovskite films with different concentrations of FA cation replenishment (Fig. S6, ESI†). The energy band alignment is shown in Fig. 3(b). Despite the deep conduction band of C60 and SnO2 electron transporting bilayers,22 the highly eliminated conduction band discontinuity (ΔEC) is assumed to enhance charge transfer from the perovskite to the electron transport layer. For the perovskites, the FAI4-based perovskite thin film showed a higher PL emission intensity, suggesting a more radiative recombination in the film, which has been reported to be favorable for suppressing the charge recombination (Fig. S7, ESI†).23 As shown in Fig. 3c, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy demonstrated that the FAI4-based perovskite thin film delivered a long fast recombination lifetime (τfast) but short slow recombination lifetime (τslow), as the τfast increased from 15.56 ns to 48.68 ns and the τslow decreased from 760.59 ns to 400.61 ns. The τfast is dominated by the recombination at the surface trap states, and the τslow is governed by the free carrier recombination in the bulk. The reduced surface trap states are due to the healing effect of the dangling bond by FA cation replenishment. This is beneficial to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs whose PCE depends strongly on the surface defects. As a whole, the trap defect density is calculated from the equation Ndefects = (2εε0VTFL)/(eL2), where L and ε are the thickness and relative dielectric constant of the perovskite film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and e is the electron charge. Typical I–V curves with an ohmic current region, trap-fill limited (TFL) current region and child current region have been observed. The trap density is reduced from 0.86 × 1016 cm−3 to 0.28 × 1016 cm−3 upon replenishment of the FA cations. Therefore, the improvement in JSC can also be associated with the enhanced charge extraction effect and decreased trap state.

It has been reported that the efficiency of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) is mainly limited by the uniformity of a large-area perovskite thin film, the quality of monolithic interconnection between sub-cells and the width of dead area.24,25 In this work, we initially scaled up the printed perovskite thin films to 10 × 10 cm2; a typical photograph is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Subsequently, we fabricated the PSCs with an aperture area of 1.0 cm2 to examine the efficiency difference of the device after the area amplification, so as to further verify the uniformity of the crystal quality of the film. The champion PSC yielded a PCE of 18.89% from the reverse scan direction, with a JSC of 23.02 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.09 V, and a FF of 0.75 (Fig. S9a, ESI†). Compared with the small area device, the decrease in FF can be ascribed to the increased Rs of the device as the charge transport distance becomes longer in the ITO film for the large area PSC. Thus, the printed large-area perovskite thin film is assumed to deliver a high quality crystallization with uniformity. The corresponding SPO performance was recorded at a forward bias of 0.85 V around the maximum power point and achieved a stabilized PCE of 18.36% within 300 s (Fig. S9b, ESI†). Subsequently, the laser scribing process was carried out with the width of the dead area at 370.70 μm and the subcell width at 6 mm, leading to a geometric filling factor (GFF) of 93.8% (Fig. S10, ESI†). The 13 subcell connected PSMs gained a PCE of 17.56% with an aperture area of 60.84 cm2 (Fig. 4(a)), corresponding to an active area efficiency of 18.72%. This efficiency is among the top reports presently, especially for devices with an active/aperture area exceeding 50 cm2 (Table S1, ESI†). The PSM shows a continuous and stable output PCE of 17.49% within 1000 s, which is consistent with the J–V character (Fig. 4(b)). Furthermore, the perovskite solar module with encapsulation demonstrates only a 2% efficiency loss after continued tracking for 250 h (Fig. 4(c)), which provides a potential opportunity to satisfy the IEC61215 demands.

In summary, we developed a FA cation replenishment-induced second growth strategy to prepare a FA-rich thin film with an enlarged grain size and balanced stoichiometric ratio. The as-prepared perovskite thin film demonstrates an enhancement of the JSC without sacrificing VOC. The PCE of the printed PSCs gained a PCE of 20.17%. More importantly, we scaled up the printed perovskite thin films to 10 × 10 cm2, and the PSM yielded a PCE of 17.56% with an aperture area of 60.84 cm2, which is among the top reports so far. The present study provides a simple strategy in overcoming the inferior quality of a FA-rich thin film prepared by printing methods.
