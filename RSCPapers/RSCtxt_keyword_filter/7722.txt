    , Accepted 4th January 2021First published on 6th January 2021AbstractAn all annealing-free solution-manufacturing is regarded as a technological advancement for the development of flexible organic solar cells (OSCs), which can prevent the distortion of plastic substrates, avoid destroying the active components of the devices, and simplify the device fabrication. Here, we report an efficient all annealing-free solution-processed flexible OSC integrated on a soft polyethylene (PE) substrate. The transparent anodes, hole-transport layers, active layers and electron-transport layers are solution-processed at room temperature without thermal annealing treatments. Thanks to both the as-developed gentle superacid doping and air-drying treatments at room temperature that enable a high-merit flexible anode on the soft PE substrates, the annealing-free flexible OSCs yield a high efficiency of 14.66% along with a high power-per-weight of 6.33 W g−1, which is close to that (15.73%) of thermally annealed rigid OSCs based on indium tin oxide anodes. Due to the mild annealing-free solution-processing and the soft PE substrates having an extremely low Young's modulus of only 0.2 GPa, the flexible OSCs maintain a high flexibility in a harsh bending test.
1. Introduction
Flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) have become a popular research field owing to the advantages of low cost, light weight, ease of fabrication, wearability, portability, etc.1–17 Numerous efforts have been devoted by the flexible OSC community to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical flexibility for facilitating the commercialization of flexible OSCs. To date, several studies have demonstrated highly efficient indium tin oxide (ITO)-based rigid OSCs with thermally annealed PM6:Y6 active layers and hole-transport layers (HTLs) that exhibited a high PCE of >17%,17–20 while ITO-based rigid OSCs with annealing-free PM6:Y6 active layers exhibited a PCE of 15.1%.21 Despite the relatively low PCE of rigid OSCs with the annealing-free PM6:Y6 active layers, the exclusion of the annealing process during active-layer fabrication allows for a simple and mild solution-manufacturing.
Flexible transparent electrode (FTE) fabrications should be considered with respect to the development of annealing-free solution-processed flexible organic solar cells. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films have the advantages of low cost, high optical transparency, tunable electrical conductivity, good flexibility and high thermal stability,22–27 so the films are widely employed as transparent electrodes. Plenty of ITO-free OSCs, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells have been demonstrated through using conducting polymer electrodes.23,24,28–30 PEDOT:PSS electrodes generally require a chemical doping treatment followed by a thermal annealing at higher temperatures (e.g., >100 °C).12,22,24 However, the following thermal annealing treatments employed for drying the PEDOT:PSS electrodes, buffer layers and active layers or assisted-doping of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes might cause a distortion of thermoplastic substrates, thereby resulting in a limited flexibility and a moderate efficiency for the flexible OSCs.31 A lot of the thermal annealing treatments employed hamper the further development of the solution-processed flexible OSCs.
An annealing-free solution-manufacturing of flexible OSCs is regarded as a technological advancement for the development of flexible OSCs, because it avoids potential damage to the active components of the flexible OSCs and simplifies the device fabrication.31,32 The annealing-free solution-manufacturing is very compatible with thermoplastic substrates with a low Young's modulus and a low density. Note that (i) thermoplastic substrates with a low Young's modulus are suitable for making highly flexible OSCs, because of a low bending stress of the thermoplastic substrates under bending states which restrains the cracks and wrinkles of device components including the substrates and metal top electrodes; and (ii) thermoplastic substrates with a low density are suitable for fabricating light-weight flexible OSCs, because the device weights are mostly determined by the weights of the underlying substrates. Generally, a low Young's modulus corresponds to a low density for substrate materials, e.g., cellophane substrates with a Young's modulus of 2.2 GPa have a density of 1.26 g cm−3, lower than that (1.38 g cm−3) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with a Young's modulus of 5.2 GPa.33 The resultant flexible OSCs fabricated on soft thermoplastic substrates probably have a raised flexibility and an improved power-per-weight (P/W). Therefore, an annealing-free solution-manufacturing of transparent electrodes, HTLs, active layers, and electron-transport layers (ETLs) is desirable and vital for the realization of highly flexible, cost-effective, and light-weight OSCs.
Herein, we demonstrate an all annealing-free solution-processed highly flexible OSC with a PEDOT:PSS anode on a soft polyethylene (PE) substrate. Compared with the commonly used PET substrates that have a Young's modulus of 5.2 GPa (ref. 33) and 4.8 GPa measured here and a density of 1.38 g cm−3, the soft PE substrates have an extremely low Young's modulus of only 0.2 GPa and a much lower density of 0.91 g cm−3, resulting in the high flexibility of the plastic materials. More encouragingly, both gentle trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H) treatments at room temperature (RT) and air-drying treatment at RT are developed not only for being compatible with the soft thermoplastic substrates, but also for enabling a flexible PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) anode with enhanced conductivity and suitable work function. Note that the room-temperature 100%-concentration CF3SO3H treatment34 reported before was incompatible with the soft PE plastic substrates because the harsh treatment caused large-domain damage to most of the plastic substrates. In the device fabrication, all the functional layers (i.e., transparent anodes, HTLs, active layers, and ETLs) are solution-processed without any thermal annealing. The resultant all annealing-free solution-processed flexible OSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 14.66%, an improved P/W of 6.33 W g−1, a light weight of 2.27 mg cm−2 and an enhanced mechanical flexibility. In addition, the annealing-free solution-manufacturing is very promising for the adaptation of roll-to-roll printing, ink-jet printing, blading, and shearing technologies into solution-printed flexible OSC modules.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical and electrical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS anodes
The PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000) films were chemically doped at room temperature through using a low-concentration (i.e., 0.8 M) CF3SO3H aqueous solution. After that, the wet PEDOT:PSS films were air-dried at RT for 2 min using a hair blower. Fig. 1a shows the schematic illustration of the air-drying treatment employed for the removal of water from the PEDOT:PSS matrices. We found that the soft PE plastic substrates were corroded by the CF3SO3H treatment at a doping temperature of 80 °C and deformed after the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C, while the 0.8 M CF3SO3H treatment at RT followed by a RT air-dying process effectively avoided damage to the soft thermoplastic substrates, ensuring a high flexibility of the thermoplastic substrates as well as the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS anodes. Through using the 0.8 M CF3SO3H treatment at RT followed by the air-drying process at RT, the flexible PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) transparent anodes coated on the soft PE substrates showed a low sheet resistance (Rsh) of 46 ± 4 Ω sq−1 and an electrical conductivity of 2440 ± 200 S cm−1. The flexible PEDOT:PSS anodes coated on the soft PE substrates exhibited a good electrical stability in an air atmosphere (ESI, Fig. S1†) and a high optical transparency (T%). As shown in Fig. 1b (the inset is the photographic image of the flexible PEDOT:PSS anodes on the soft substrates), after the 0.8 M CF3SO3H treatment at RT followed by the air-drying process, T% is increased from 91.6% to 92.8% at λ = 550 nm. The flexible PEDOT:PSS anodes having high optical and electrical characteristics should be suitable for making ITO-free flexible OSCs.

2.2. Structure, morphology and work function of PEDOT:PSS anodes
The raised conductivity and transmittance accompany the evolution in crystallinity and morphology of the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) films. Fig. 1c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the PEDOT:PSS films. The as-cast air-dried films do not have any diffraction peak, demonstrating an extremely low crystallinity of the PEDOTs. However, the room-temperature CF3SO3H-doped and air-dried PEDOT:PSS films exhibit a strong diffraction peak at 13.6° and a peak shoulder at about 6.7°, demonstrating a significant enhancement in crystallinity of the conducting PEDOTs. The enhanced crystallinity of the PEDOTs can make the charge hopping easier, and it eventually results in a raised electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films. ESI Fig. S2† shows the Raman spectra of the as-cast air-dried PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) films and the CF3SO3H-doped air-dried PEDOT:PSS anodes. The strongest band between 1400 cm−1 and 1470 cm−1 originated from the symmetric CαCβ stretching vibration of the PEDOTs. As compared to that (1430.4 cm−1) of the as-cast air-dried PEDOT:PSS films, the symmetric CαCβ vibration peaks in Raman spectroscopy red-shifted to 1427.9 cm−1 in the as-doped and air-dried PEDOT:PSS anodes. The results indicate a change of many PEDOTs from benzoid structures to quinoid structures, thereby resulting in more planar backbones for the enhanced crystallinity of the PEDOTs. Fig. 1d and e show the morphologies of the air-dried PEDOT:PSS films coated on the 24 μm-thick PE substrates obtained using a scanning probe microscope (SPM). Obviously, the as-cast air-dried PEDOT:PSS films have a poor phase-segregation morphology along with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.12 nm (Fig. 1d). PEDOT-rich networks were not observed in the as-cast air-dried films. With the 0.8 M CF3SO3H treatment at RT followed by the air-drying treatment, the flexible PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) anodes exhibited a better phase separation between PEDOT and PSS along with a RMS roughness of 1.98 nm (Fig. 1e), and the PEDOT:PSS anodes showed plenty of physically continuous PEDOT-rich extended chains, demonstrating a better phase-segregated morphology. The good phase-segregated morphology is favorable for charge-carrier collection by the PEDOT:PSS anodes in OSCs, which can reduce energy barriers and cause free charge-carrier hopping.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to probe the work functions (WFs) of the as-cast air-dried PEDOT:PSS films and the room-temperature CF3SO3H-doped air-dried PEDOT:PSS anodes, as shown in Fig. 1f. Obviously, after the CF3SO3H treatment at room temperature, the WF of the air-dried PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) film was increased from 4.91 to 5.10 eV. The WF (5.10 eV) of the flexible PEDOT:PSS anodes matches well with the WF (5.05 eV)14 of the PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) HTL and the valence-band edge (5.50 eV) of PM6 for efficient hole transportation and extraction by the PEDOT:PSS anodes. The suitable WF of the room-temperature CF3SO3H-doped air-dried PEDOT:PSS anodes can lead to a small potential barrier for high-efficiency organic solar cells.
2.3. Photovoltaic performances of annealing-free rigid OSCs
On the basis of the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) transparent anodes, we first fabricated the annealing-free rigid OSCs on glass substrates. Fig. 2a presents the rigid device structure, that is, glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) anode/air-dried PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) HTL/annealing-free PM6:Y6 (ref. 21) active layer/annealing-free PFN-Br ETL/Al cathode. The energy levels of the device components are illustrated in Fig. 2b. In this work, the annealing-free OSCs were solution-processed at room temperatures of 22 ± 4 °C. The annealing-free rigid OSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS anodes yielded a high efficiency of 15.08% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 2c), which was comparable to that (PCE: 15.2%)21 of the ITO-based OSCs with annealing-free PM6:Y6 active layers, and to that (PCE: 15.73%) of the control ITO-based OSCs with the thermally annealed PM6:Y6 active layers reported here. We found that the annealing-free rigid OSCs with the PEDOT:PSS anodes exhibited a larger leakage current, as compared with the thermally annealed ITO-based OSCs (Fig. 2d), thereby leading to a slight decrease in fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC). To evaluate the carrier recombination behavior of the devices, the dependence of open voltage (VOC) on light intensity, giving a relationship of VOC ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight), was studied. The small ideality factor of n = 1.59 for the annealing-free PEDOT:PSS-based OSCs suggested that the PM6:Y6 active layer coated on the PEDOT:PSS anode modified by the air-dried PEDOT:PSS HTL could suppress trap-assisted recombination (Fig. 2e).35,36

The room-temperature CF3SO3H treatment followed by the air-drying process is also suitable for preparing larger-area ITO-free OSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS anodes. Here, we fabricated the ITO-free OSCs with a larger active area of 0.5 × 0.6 cm2. On the basis of the room-temperature CF3SO3H-doped air-dried PEDOT:PSS anodes, the larger-area annealing-free solution-processed OSCs exhibited a considerably high efficiency of 13.67% with a FF of 0.685 (Fig. 2f). Compared with the lab-scale small-size flexible solar cells (0.2 × 0.3 cm2), the larger-area devices yielded a relatively low efficiency, which was attributed to a higher internal resistance and a larger leakage current. The room-temperature low-concentration CF3SO3H treatment followed by the air-drying process did pave a way to fabricate annealing-free solution-processed OSCs.
2.4. Photovoltaic performances of all annealing-free flexible OSCs
We further demonstrated the all annealing-free solution-processed flexible OSCs fabricated on the 24 μm-thick soft PE substrates and the 200 μm-thick PET substrates (schematically illustrated in Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the cross-sectional image of the all annealing-free flexible OSCs with a structure of PE substrates/PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) anodes (∼85 nm)/air-dried PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083, ∼30 nm)/annealing-free PM6:Y6 (∼200 nm)/annealing-free PFN-Br (∼10 nm)/Al (∼100 nm). The thickness of the PM6:Y6 active layers is much lower than that (>500 nm) of perovskite layers of PVSCs. Also considering the small thickness and low density of the soft PE substrates, light-weight and high-P/W organic solar cells might be realized. We found that the 24 μm-thick PE substrates exhibited a high optical transmittance, e.g., 98% at λ = 550 nm (Fig. 3c). The optical transmittance rivals the relatively rigid PET substrates and the glass substrates used for ITO deposition.

Fig. 3d shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the all annealing-free flexible OSCs fabricated on the PE and PET substrates. The results demonstrated that the PE-based flexible OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.66% with a JSC of 23.92 mA cm−2, while the PET-based flexible devices exhibited a lower PCE of 14.42% with a JSC of 23.67 mA cm−2. The higher PCE of the flexible OSCs fabricated on the soft PE substrates may be attributed to the high optical transmittance of the soft PE substrates. Fig. 3e shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the all annealing-free flexible OSCs based on the PE substrates. The maximum EQE value reached 82.5% at 560 nm and 76.0% at 710 nm for the all annealing-free flexible devices, which demonstrated the high JSC of 23.92 mA cm−2. The integrated current density is 23.90 mA cm−2 for the flexible devices (Fig. 3e), which is consistent with the high JSC. The performance data of the OSCs are summarized in Table 1 for reference.

The all annealing-free solution-processed flexible OSCs fabricated on the soft PE substrates have a high power-per-weight. The density of the PE substrates is only 0.91 g cm−3, which is much lower than that (1.38 g cm−3) of the most commonly used PET plastic substrates. The total weight of the PE-based flexible OSCs is measured to be 9.08 mg, which is much lower than that (100.52 mg) of the PET-based flexible OSCs, and that (1111.34 mg) of the ITO-free OSCs fabricated on glass substrates (ESI Fig. S3†). Considering the extra weight (0.05 mg) of the Al films that were blocked by the masks in vacuum evaporation, the P/W is 6.33 W g−1 for the PE-based flexible OSCs and 0.56 W g−1 for the PET-based flexible OSCs. We also summarized the performances of the rigid and flexible OSCs with annealing-free functional layers reported so far (see ESI Fig. S4 and Table S1†). It's believed that the all annealing-free solution-processing is important and desirable for the low-temperature solution-printing, ink-jet printing, and roll-to-roll manufacturing towards cost-efficient flexible production.
2.5. Flexibility of all annealing-free flexible OSCs
The all annealing-free flexible OSCs fabricated on the soft PE substrates exhibit a high mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from the tetrahedral chains comprising carbon–carbon single bonds with a long bond length of 154 pm of the PE molecules, the PE substrates having low tensile strengths are mechanically compliant. In the stress–strain measurements, both PE and PET plastic substrates had been strained to fracture. We found that the tensile strength of the PE substrates was slowly increased with a broad shoulder, and it finally reached 30 MPa with a corresponding strain (ε) of 350%, while the tensile strength of the PET substrates sharply increased to 135 MPa under a tiny ε loading of 5% and it cracked under ε of 25% (Fig. 3f), suggesting a larger rigidity of the PET substrates over the PE substrates. Furthermore, the mechanical characteristics of the all annealing-free flexible OSCs were studied in harsh bending tests at bending radii (r) of 0.50 and 0.25 mm. The profiles of PCE versus bending times are plotted in Fig. 3g and h. Note that the flexible devices were bent parallel to the evaporated Ag line as an extraction electrode for an effective flexibility assessment. The active region (i.e., the Al cathodes rather than the active layers surrounding the Al cathodes) afforded the bending stresses. With 1000 cyclic bending tests at r of 0.50 and 0.25 mm, the flexible OSCs maintained 92.5% and 91.0% of the initial efficiency, respectively, while the conventional flexible devices with the PET substrates showed a large drop in PCE down to 71.0% of the initial value at r of 0.50 mm, and the solar cells failed to operate at r of 0.25 mm, which meant that the active regions of the flexible OSCs had been cracked to block the charge-carrier transport. For the extremely small bending radius of 0.25 mm for 100 cycles, the PEDOT:PSS anodes coated on the PE substrates (2 × 2 cm2; two edges were coated with Ag paste) had no visible increase in resistance; however, the PEDOT:PSS anodes coated on the PET substrates showed an increase of 36% in resistance (Fig. 3i); this implied a structural damage of the PEDOT:PSS films.
The all annealing-free flexible OSCs fabricated on the PE substrates become mechanically compliant because of a small strain in stress loading. The maximum strain depends linearly on the distance (d/2), where d is the thickness of the plastic substrates, based on the relation37 maximum ε = d/2R, where R is the radius of curvature, as illustrated in ESI Fig. S5.† For the flexible OSC devices with PET, the theoretical maximum strain is 16.7% and 28.6% in the bending tests at r of 0.5 and 0.25 mm, corresponding to the largest tensile strength of 135 MPa, while for the OSC devices with PE, the theoretical maximum strain is as low as 2.3% and 4.6% in the bending tests at r of 0.5 and 0.25 mm, corresponding to a small tensile strength of 2 and 8 MPa, respectively. The small tensile strengths contributed to the raised flexibility of the flexible OSCs.
2.6. Morphology of plastic substrates and Al cathodes

Fig. 4 shows the morphological characteristics of the plastic substrates and Al top cathodes of the annealing-free flexible OSCs in bending tests. Obviously, large-domain cracks and wrinkles were formed in the PET substrates in the 100 cycle flexing test at r of 0.25 mm (Fig. 4b and c), thereby resulting in an overall performance degradation of the solar cells. For the PET substrates, large cracks with diameters over 2 μm were caused by the tensile strains. Severe crack propagation also occurred in the Al top cathodes in the bending tests at r of 0.5 and 0.25 mm (Fig. 4e and f). Note that the PM6:Y6 active layers also suffered from fine cracks and defects, as shown in ESI Fig. S6,† while for the soft substrates of PE (Fig. 4B and C) and the top cathodes of Al (Fig. 4E and F), no large-domain cracks were generated in the harsh bending tests, which was mostly attributed to the soft PE substrates with an extremely low Young's modulus of only 0.2 GPa that enabled a physically continuous functional layer on top. The use of the soft substrates is helpful to inhibit the initiation and propagation of the cracks, thus enhancing the structural stability of the as-integrated electronics. Even with harsh flexing approaching folding, the annealing-free flexible OSCs fabricated on the PE substrates maintained a high efficiency. Considering that the thickness of plastic substrates probably affects the continuity and breaks of the substrates and Al top cathodes in bending tests, we further investigated the morphology characteristics of the 50 μm-thick PET substrates and the Al top cathodes coated on the 50 μm-thick PET (ESI Fig. S7†). Crack propagation was caused in the Al top cathodes and the 50 μm-thick PET substrates after 100 cyclic bending tests at r of 0.50 and 0.25 mm. The cracks are relatively small and dense in the bending test at r of 0.25 mm. The results demonstrated that both PET substrates even with a small thickness and Al top cathodes exhibited large-domain cracks after bending.

Scale bar: 50 μm. 
2.7. Potential applications in stretchable OSCs
We envision that there is a high probability of inventing a stretchable photovoltaic foil with waved or wrinkled configurations (ESI Fig. S8†) on the basis of the annealing-free highly flexible OSC fabrication. Stretchable devices could be demonstrated through deforming the highly flexible OSC foils on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomeric substrate. As the pre-strains to the soft PDMS elastomer were applied followed by relaxing, the solar cells became wrinkled. Through the pre-straining strategy, the stretchable types with waved or wrinkled configurations were realized. However, for making highly stretchable electronics in the future, soft PE substrates with a thickness of <5 μm are urgently needed. The highly flexible organic solar cells can be attached on the elastomer, clothes and even human skin for making wearable photovoltaics with less stiffness. Based on these investigations, efforts should be devoted to the uses of soft underlying plastic substrates with low densities, highly conductive flexible anodes with a high work function, active blends with enhanced mechanical compliance, and top cathodes such as metal alloys along with mild solution-processing, that are pivotal to the significant development of highly flexible photoelectronics.
3. Conclusions
We have demonstrated an all annealing-free solution-processed highly flexible OSC. The room-temperature CF3SO3H-doped air-dried PEDOT:PSS anode exhibits high optical and electrical characteristics (Rsh of 46 Ω sq−1 with T% of 92.8%) and a high work function (5.10 eV). The annealing-free solution-processed flexible OSCs yield a high PCE of 14.66% along with P/W as high as 6.33 W g−1. The PCE of the annealing-free flexible OSCs is comparable to that (15.08%) of PEDOT:PSS-based rigid OSCs fabricated on glass substrates, and it's close to that (15.73%) of the control ITO-based OSCs with thermally annealed PM6:Y6 active layers. Furthermore, the annealing-free flexible OSCs exhibit a high mechanical flexibility, e.g., a slight decrease by 7.5% and 9.0% in PCE in the 1000 cyclic bending tests at r of 0.50 and 0.25 mm, respectively. The annealing-free solution-manufacturing of transparent anodes, HTLs, active layers and ETLs is very compatible with soft thermoplastic substrates. It's also promising for making next-generation solution-printed highly flexible OSC products without any thermal annealing treatment in the future.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
PM6 and Y6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc., Beijing. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (i.e., Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P VP AI4083) were purchased from Heraeus, Germany.
4.2. Device fabrication
In the rigid ITO-based solar cell fabrication, glass substrates (size: 2.0 × 2.0 cm2) were cleaned through ultrasonic treatments in soap water, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and then they were processed in UV–ozone chambers for 5 min. In the flexible solar cell fabrication, the PET substrates and the soft PE substrates coated on glass were cleaned with IPA followed by baking at 50 °C for 10 min. Next, PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (PH1000) were filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) solutions were spin-coated on plastic substrates at 3500 rpm followed by air drying at room temperature for 5 min using a hair blower, and the spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS and air-drying processes were conducted again. Subsequently, the superacid treatment was conducted via dipping 0.8 M CF3SO3H aqueous solutions on the PEDOT:PSS surfaces. Upon CF3SO3H treatment for 10 min, the CF3SO3H aqueous solutions were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by air-drying treatment for 2 min. Then, the PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) HTLs were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) electrodes at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The HTLs were air-dried at RT for 2 min using a hair blower. After that, the active layers of PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 w/w, 8.7 mg mL−1 for Y6) were dissolved in chloroform with 1-chloronaphthalene (0.5%, v/v) and were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS HTLs. Then, PFN-Br in methanol (0.4 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the surfaces of active layers at 3000 rpm to obtain the electron transport layers. Finally, the cathodes of Al were thermally evaporated under a pressure of 10−4 Pa. The active areas are 6.0 and 30.0 mm2, respectively.
4.3. Characterization
Sheet resistance was measured using the van der Pauw method. Film thickness was determined using a surface profile-meter (Talysurf Series II). UV-vis spectra were recorded on GS54T spectrophotometers (Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co., China). Film morphology was examined using an SPM (VEECO Dimension 3100V). The molecule structures were studied using Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Reflex). UPS measurements were carried out using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DALD UPS system. The molecular structures were studied using Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Reflex). J–V characteristics were measured in N2-filled gloveboxes using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under the illumination of AM 1.5G, with an AAA solar simulator (Newport, model 94023A). The lamp was calibrated using a 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (KG5 filter) provided by Newport Corporation. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon detector. For J–V characteristics, two metal probes were brought into contact with Al top cathodes and the PEDOT:PSS bottom anodes, respectively. Note that the edges of the PEDOT:PSS bottom anodes were coated with Ag paste. To evaluate the device flexibility, the solar cells were bent with radii of 0.50 mm and 0.25 mm and underwent 1000 cycles of harsh bending in the N2-filled glovebox.
