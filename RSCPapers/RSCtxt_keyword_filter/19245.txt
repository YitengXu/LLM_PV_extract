    , Accepted 15th August 2019First published on 20th August 2019AbstractLead-free hybrid perovskites have attracted great attention as environmentally friendly light absorber layers. In this work, we report on Te-based double perovskites A2TeI6 (A = Tl, K, NH4, Rb, Cs, CH3NH3, and CH(NH2)2) as potential candidates for optoelectronic applications. The structural stability and electronic and optical properties of these Te-based double perovskite materials are investigated by using first-principles calculations. These Te-based double perovskites exhibit good structural stability, tunable band gap, and strong optical absorption. These Te-based double perovskites show promising optoelectronic properties, and may be potential candidates for photovoltaic applications. Our calculated results can provide a deep insight into developing lead-free perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (OIHP) have emerged as one of the most promising next-generation photovoltaic materials in the solar cell field.1–7 The record power conversion efficiency (PCE) on the lab scale has been updated to 23.2%8 since the first reported PCE of 3.8% in 2009.9 Despite the rapid progress in the record value of PCE, two key issues need to be resolved before industrial applications of OIHP materials. Most of the high-performance perovskite solar cells are based on Pb-based perovskites, which contain toxic lead, and the use of lead in devices is restricted in many countries.10,11
Great efforts have been devoted to developing lead-free perovskite solar cells. Sn has been applied to replace Pb to form nontoxic perovskites such as MASnI3 and FASnI3 (MA = CH3NH3),12–14 which yield solar cells with PCEs over 9%.15 Considering the oxidization of Sn2+ to Sn4+, this result will lead to the fast degradation of the Sn-based perovskite devices. Another suitable replacement is the Ge element. MAGeI3 was synthesized by Kanatzidis's group in 2015 and exhibited a remarkable optical absorption.16 However, the obtained maximum efficiency of MAGeI3 was only 0.2%,17 which is attributed to a larger band gap of 1.9 eV. A variety of theoretical studies have been performed to explore the electronic and optical properties of mixed Pb–Sn and Pb–Ge perovskites.18–21 The partial and full substitution of Pb2+ with other divalent metals, such as Mg2+,22 Ca2+,23 Sr2+,24,25 Ba2+,26 Mn2+,27 or Pd2+,28 has widely been investigated to understand their effects on the electronic and optical properties. It still remains a significant challenge in the perovskite materials despite considerable effort having been made to address these issues of Pb-based perovskites by exploring alternative compounds. Therefore, it has become highly desirable to explore good structural stability of possible lead-free perovskites with suitable band gaps.
Recently, halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have been proposed as stable and nontoxic alternatives to lead halide perovskites, where two toxic Pb2+ are substituted by using one monovalent M+ and one trivalent M3+ to yield the same overall charge balance as the conventional perovskites. Halide double perovskites have attracted great attention in the past three years. Double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br, Cl) have been reported to possess promising photovoltaic properties with good stability.29–31 The band gaps of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are 2.19 and 2.77 eV, respectively.30 Although these double perovskites exhibit good stability, the band gaps are too large and indirect, which is not ideal for photovoltaic applications. Apart from Ag–Bi double perovskites, Cs2InAgCl6 and MA2KBiCl6 double perovskites have been reported.32,33 They also exhibit large bandgaps of about 3 eV, which hinder their application in photovoltaic devices. Similarly, 2D hexagonal MA2AgBiI6 possesses a wide band gap of 1.96 eV.34 Cs2NaBiI6 has a low direct band gap of 1.66 eV and shows high stability. However, this compound only exhibits a PCE of 0.42%.35 In fact, the major disadvantage of the reported double perovskites is that their bandgaps are too large for use in single junction solar cells.
In the present work, we investigated a series of Te-based double perovskites by using first-principles theory. The results show that these Te-based double perovskites possess good stability, a suitable band gap, and a strong optical absorption coefficient. Our calculated results indicate that a family of A2TeI6 double perovskites may be potential candidates for lead-free perovskite solar cells.
2. Computational details
First-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).36 The exchange–correlation energy was approximated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)37 proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).38 A plane-wave cutoff of 500 eV and a Γ-centered 4 × 4 × 4 K-mesh in the Brillouin zone were employed. A denser 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh was used for the electronic and optical properties. The total energy was converged to 10−5 eV. The structural relaxations were further optimized by relaxing both cell parameters and atomic coordinates until the ionic forces were converged to 0.01 eV Å−1. The optB86b-vdW functional39 was chosen for the structural optimization.
It is important to include the effect of spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in calculations of electronic structures. For Te-based double perovskites, the band gap calculated using GGA-SOC was much smaller than the experimental value.40 The GGA has been shown to give better agreement with the experimental data.40 Therefore, the GGA functional was used to calculate the band structures of these Te-based double perovskites.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structures
The geometric structures of seven A2TeI6 double perovskites are demonstrated in Fig. 1. According to the different inorganic/organic cations at the A-site of Te-based double perovskites, these compounds adopt the corresponding structures at room temperature. Tl2TeI6, K2TeI6, and (NH4)2TeI6 perovskites possess monoclinic structures with space group P21/c.41–43 It gives rise to a tetragonal structure for Rb2TeI6.44 Cs2TeI6, MA2TeI6, and FA2TeI6 perovskites exhibit cubic phases with space group Fmm.40,45 It can be seen that the size of the A-site cation has an important effect on the structure of A2TeI6 compounds.

The Te–I bond lengths and I–Te–I bond angles of Te-based double perovskites are listed in Table 2. The results show that MA2TeI6 and FA2TeI6 exhibit significant discrepancy between short and long Te–I bond lengths. Moreover, the calculated I–Te–I bond angles in MA2TeI6 and FA2TeI6 are 176.7° and 176.3°, respectively, which demonstrate that the TeI62− octahedron is slightly distorted. For other five Te-based compounds, the discrepancy in the Te–I bond lengths is very small, and the I–Te–I bond angles are 180°.

The direct restriction factor for the development of perovskite solar cells is the structural stability. It is well-known that the structural stability of MAPbI3 is poor. The MASnI3 compound is unstable due to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.18 Previous calculations indicate that MAGeI3 is marginally stable.46 Moreover, a wide band gap of 1.9 eV for MAGeI3 is not expected to obtain good performance in perovskite solar cells.16 The experimental maximum efficiency of MAGeI3 is only 0.2%,17 which is much lower than those of MAPbI3 and MASnI3.15,47 Therefore, it is still challenging to develop stable lead-free perovskite materials with tunable band gaps and ideal optoelectronic properties for high perovskite solar cells. In order to estimate the structural stabilities of A2TeI6 double perovskites, we calculated the formation energies of these Te-based double perovskites. The formation energy of the perovskites can be expressed as follows: ΔH = E(A2TeI6) − 2E(AI) − E(TeI4)(1)where A represents a series of inorganic or organic cations. ΔH is the formation energy, and E(A2TeI6), E(AI), and E(TeI4) are the corresponding total energies. The calculated formation energies of Te-based double perovskites are shown in Fig. 2. Generally, a more negative value of ΔH indicates a more stable structure. It is observed that the calculated ΔH of our studied perovskite materials is negative, which confirms their thermodynamic stability. As compared to MAPbI3, all of Te-based double perovskites are highly stable. Moreover, Cs2TeI6 is the most stable structure among all the Te-based double perovskites.
 Fig. 2  The calculated formation energies of the A2TeI6 double perovskites. 
3.2 Electronic properties
To understand the effect of A cations on the electronic structure, we performed band structure calculations for all Te-based compounds. The band gap can represent the capability of absorbing solar energy, which is important to obtain high performance of perovskite solar cells. The calculated band structures of Te-based double perovskites are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that all A2TeI6 perovskites show indirect band gap nature, which indicates that the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are not at the same high symmetry point. The calculated indirect and direct band gaps are given in Table 3. The calculated direct band gaps of Cs2TeI6, MA2TeI6, and FA2TeI6 are 1.48, 1.39, and 1.45 eV, respectively, which are in very good agreement with the theoretical and experimental values.40,45,48 Their indirect band gaps are smaller than the corresponding experimental values. The results also indicate that the PBE method can give accurate band gaps for A2TeI6 double perovskites. The calculated direct band gaps of Tl2TeI6, K2TeI6, (NH4)2TeI6, and Rb2TeI6 are 1.53, 1.75, 1.61, and 1.60 eV, respectively, which are slightly larger than those of A2TeI6 (A = Cs, MA, FA) perovskites. For the same group space of Te-based double perovskites, the alternation on A can still influence the band structure to a certain extent. Compared to the bandgaps of A2M(I)M(III)X6 double perovskites, these Te-based double perovskites have suitable band gaps. Our calculated results indicate that these A2TeI6 double perovskites have high potential to replace unstable and toxic lead-based perovskite materials once their excellent PCE performance has been achieved.

To further understand the electronic properties of hybrid perovskites, the density of states (DOS) is analyzed. The DOS and partial DOS of A2TeI6 double perovskites exhibit similar curves, as shown in Fig. 4. The VBM of A2TeI6 is mainly composed of the I 5p orbitals, whereas the CBM is mainly composed of the Te 5p and I 5p orbitals. The inorganic and organic cations don’t contribute to the band edge states.

To gain more insight into the electronic properties, Bader charge analysis of Te-based double perovskites was performed. The results of the Bader charge analysis are listed in Table 4. The Bader charges of A, Te, and I ions fluctuate from 0.585 to 0.835 e, 0.727 to 0.820 e, and −0.330 to −0.415 e. The Bader charge analysis indicates that electrons are transferred from the A and Te cations to I anions. For K2TeI6 and Rb2TeI6, charge transfer of K/Rb cations and Te cations is apparently larger than those of other five Te-based perovskites. The Bader charges of A cations decrease gradually along Cs+ → MA+ → FA+, but the charge transfer of Te cations increases gradually in A2TeI6 perovskites.

3.3 Optical properties
The optical absorption coefficients of perovskite materials can provide important information that can be used to analyze the absorption of light for these materials. To evaluate the optical performance of Te-based double perovskites, the optical absorption coefficient of each compound was calculated. The absorption coefficient I(ω) was given as below:49 (2)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function depending on the light frequency ω. The calculated optical absorption coefficients for these Te-based compounds in the visible light region are presented in Fig. 5. It can be seen that these Te-based double perovskites possess strong optical absorption coefficients in the visible light region. The main optical absorption for all Te-based perovskite materials is observed at around 400 nm. Furthermore, the optical absorption coefficients of some materials are higher than that of MAPbI3, such as K2TeI6, (NH4)2TeI6, and Rb2TeI6. It is noteworthy that these materials can absorb light with a longer wavelength. Therefore, these Te-based perovskite materials might be strong potential candidates for solar cell applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we present a systematic theoretical study on the structural stability and electronic and optical properties of Te-based double perovskites for the first time. Our calculated results show that the lattice constants of these Te-based double perovskites are consistent with their experimental values. All of these Te-based double perovskites show good structural stability compared to MAPbI3. The calculated band gaps of Cs2TeI6, MA2TeI6, and FA2TeI6 agree well with experimental values. Moreover, the band gaps of these Te-based double perovskites are suitable for single junction solar cells. A strong absorption spectrum and a broad absorption spectrum make them great potential candidates for photovoltaic applications. We expect that this study can provide a new insight into developing stable and high-performance lead-free perovskite solar cells.
