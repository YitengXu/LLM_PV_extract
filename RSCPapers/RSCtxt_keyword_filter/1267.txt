    , Accepted 26th April 2023First published on 26th April 2023AbstractA multifunctional group molecule, namely MATC, was first introduced into a Cs/FA-based perovskite used as an additive. An impressive PCE of 21.51% was achieved for the inverted PSCs with reduced defect states and improved perovskite film quality. Moreover, MATC passivation considerably enhanced the stability of the PSC devices.
As an emerging photovoltaic technology, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting ever-increasing interests during the past decade due to their prominent photoelectric properties,1 and their highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) has risen to the certified 25.7%. Notably, the study of methylammonium (MA)-free, Cs/FA perovskites has recently aroused increasing attention.2–4 This not only can address the intrinsic thermal instability of MA-containing perovskite materials,5 but also prevent the change in the photoinactive δ phase of pure FA-based perovskite at room temperature,3,4 which may make it an ideal candidate for the commercialization of PSCs. However, at present, the performance of Cs/FA-based PSCs still needs to be further elevated.
The defects in the perovskite film originated from the processing and growth conditions are non-negligible and this is a critical factor restricting the performance of PSCs.6 Point defects such as organic cation vacancies (VMA) and halide anion vacancies (VI) are often found at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films.6 The deep level traps caused by defects perform as recombination centers for trapping charges, thereby inducing non-radiative recombination and affecting charge transport.3,4 In addition, defects as the initiation site for degradation can make perovskites active and prone to decompose,6 which impairs the device efficiency and long-term stability. Therefore, reducing the defect density in the perovskite structure and obtaining high-quality perovskite films is of vital importance for efficient and stable PSCs.
To date, a variety of strategies have been carried out to control defects in perovskites, such as process optimization,7 interfacial modification,8 and additive engineering,9etc. Among them, additive engineering has proven to be a simple and effective means to regulate the overall quality and performance of films, simply by introducing a small amount of functional substances into the perovskite layer.10–14 The organic small molecules with specific functional groups, such as –NH2 and –COOH, etc., can coordinate with perovskites based on Lewis acid-base chemistry,3,4,6 and therefore, they are often employed as an efficient perovskite additive. For instance, coumarin 343 with carbonyl groups was used to passivate Pb2+ defects,4 yielding a raised PCE to 20.9% for the inverted PSC. In particular, molecules with multifunctional groups may have more powerful defect passivation and crystal growth control.6 Zhang et al. developed a 11 maleimidoundecanoic acid (11 MA) additive and demonstrated a strong interaction of carbonyl groups (carboxyl and amide) on both sides of 11 MA with Pb2+,12 reducing the trap state density of the MA-containing perovskite. In addition, Yang et al. introduced D-penicillamine (PA) as an additive to passivate the charged traps of perovskite by interacting with –SH and –COOH groups,3 and the strong coordination forwarded the improved performance of regular (n-i-p) PSCs. Despite some progress, the more diverse and effective multiple-active-site organic additives are highly desirable, and deserve further study to maximize the potential of modulation, especially in the application of efficient and stable Cs/FA-based inverted PSCs.4,13
In this work, we developed a simple additive strategy via introducing a methyl 3-amino-2-thiophenecarboxylate (MATC) molecule with triple functional groups (amino, ester, and thiophene) into a Cs/FA-based perovskite. It is demonstrated that MATC can effectively interact with the uncoordinated Pb2+ (iodine vacancy) by coordination of functional groups, which hence suppressed the defect formation and reduced the trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, the crystallization and film quality of the perovskite were significantly improved due to the presence of MATC, which can facilitate the absorption and charge transport. The improved crystal quality and synergetic defect passivation of multiple active-sites led to a remarkably increased PCE from 19.67% to 21.51% for the inverted PSC along with negligible hysteresis. Importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with MATC showed a striking enhancement in stability under ambient air and thermal stress conditions.
Here, the perovskite of (Cs0.17FA0.83)Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 was used. To improve the quality of the perovskite film, the MATC additive was dissolved in anti-solvent and then poured on the spinning substrate during the preparation process of perovskite. As shown in Fig. 1a, the MATC molecule contains an amino group, an ester group and a thiophene group. The three characteristic Lewis-base groups with a lone pair electron on the N, O, and S atoms can interact with Pb2+,12,15 respectively, which may have a synergetic passivation effect of uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. The interaction between MATC and perovskite can be revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. For the perovskite introducing MATC, the stretching vibration peak of the CO group shifted to lower wavenumber from ∼1726 cm−1 of pure MATC (Fig. S1a, ESI†), confirming the coordination between the CO group in MATC and Pb2+ in the perovskite.4 In addition, after interaction with PbI2, the –NH2 peak occurring at ∼1586 cm−1 from pure MATC also shifted to ∼1592 cm−1 (Fig. S1b, ESI†). These interactions can effectively passivate the Pb2+ defects,16 thereby reducing the perovskite defect density. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the absorption peak of MATC at 317 nm was blue-shifted by 3 nm when small amounts of PbI2 were mixed into MATC solution, again indicative of the binding between PbI2 and the functional groups of MATC, as reported, which can affect the conjugated structure of the chromophore and result in the peak shift.17

To further investigate the interaction between MATC and perovskite, XPS measurement was carried out. As shown in Fig. S3b and c (ESI†), the peak of N 1s occurring at 399.7 eV from –NH2 and the peak of O 1s occurring at 532.4 eV from CO shifted to 400.1 eV and 532.6 eV, respectively, after interacting with PbI2. Besides, the S 2p core-level peak from the thiophene group also shifted slightly to high binding energy (Fig. S3d, ESI†). These results imply that MATC has a synergetic and more favorable interaction with the perovskite. For the Pb 4f spectrum of the pristine perovskite film shown in Fig. 1c, two shoulder peaks belonging to metallic Pb (Pb0) were detected at 141.9 and 137.0 eV, which is originated from the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects born during the perovskite formation.3 Nevertheless, the signals of Pb0 disappeared after introducing the MATC molecule, indicating that this additive can effectively inhibit the formation of Pb2+ defects.3,14 Moreover, the characteristic peaks corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 shifted to lower binding energies for the MATC-introduced perovskite, which could be explained as the result of strong coordination interaction between the Pb2+ and the functional groups in MATC.14 Noteworthily, a similar situation of peak shift was found for the I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 (Fig. 1d), demonstrating that there is an electrostatic interaction between –NH2 in MATC and iodine through hydrogen bonding.3
To gain more information regarding the passivation mechanism of MATC within the Cs/FA perovskite, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the results reveal that the binding energy of –NH2, CO and thiophene groups from MATC with Pb2+ from the perovskite surface is −0.33 eV, −0.25 eV and −0.17 eV, respectively. This suggests that compared with the interaction between the S atom and Pb2+, the –NH2 and CO are more likely to interact with the surface Pb2+ defects of the perovskite,16,18 leading to the formation of stronger coordination. In view of the interaction between –NH2 and the adjacent halide of the octahedron via hydrogen bonding, we can understand that the adsorption of CO and thiophene onto the Pb2+ defects may be further intensified according to the previous report.16
Subsequently, the XRD patterns of the as-prepared perovskite films were investigated. As shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), the typical diffraction peaks at 12.8° and 14.2° are assigned to PbI2 and the (110) plane of Cs/FA perovskite, and the imperfect phase purity may be caused by the excess PbI2 composition and the inadequate reaction of PbI2. The stronger intensity of the (110) peak accompanied by the decreased PbI2 signal can be observed for the perovskite film with MATC, implying that the introduction of MATC can promote the reaction of PbI2 and thus improve the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Besides, there is no obvious peak shift for all samples, indicating that MATC is not embedded into the perovskite lattice and just present at the surface and grain boundaries.4Fig. 2a and b show the surface SEM images of the perovskite films. The compact morphology with significantly increased average grain size from 218 to 306 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†) can be achieved for the perovskite film with MATC, which further verified the improved film quality. Besides, the absorption spectra of the perovskite film introduced with MATC showed slightly increased absorbance (Fig. S5b, ESI†), in good agreement with the results of SEM and XRD.

To assess the passivation effect, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra. It is noteworthy that the perovskite film with MATC exhibited significantly enhanced PL intensity compared to the control film (Fig. 2c), accompanied by a slight blue-shift of the PL peak, demonstrating the reduction of non-radiative recombination by defect passivation of MATC.14,16 Moreover, the TRPL spectra (Fig. 2d) further illustrated that the MATC-introduced perovskite film possessed a prolonged average carrier lifetime, which confirms that the trap states in perovskite films can be effectively passivated by MATC molecules, thereby beneficial for suppressing the nonradiative recombination and facilitating the charge transport.19 The presented optoelectronic properties look promising in respect to solar cell performance.
We then investigated the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with an inverted device structure shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). Fig. 3a plots the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on various concentrations of MATC anti-solvent, and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Obviously, the optimal device performance was obtained at the concentration of 3.5 mg ml−1 with the significantly increased PCE from 19.67% to 21.51%. A further increase in the concentration of MATC resulted in the decay of the device efficiency. The statistical parameters of PSCs with and without optimal MATC are exhibited in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The smaller deviations of key parameters for the MATC device demonstrated its good reproducibility. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b) demonstrated the integrated photocurrent densities of 22.1 and 21.0 mA cm−2 that match well with those obtained from J–V curves. Fig. S7b (ESI†) compares the hysteresis behavior of the PSCs. It was found that the MATC device showed evidently reduced hysteresis with a small H-index of 3.9% (Table S2, ESI†), which could be attributed to the effective defect passivation and mitigation of ion migration at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite.12 The steady-state output of the PSCs was measured (Fig. 3c). The device with MATC delivered a stabilized PCE of 20.9%, close to that measured from the J–V curve, whereas the control device yielded an output efficiency of only 18.8%. Fig. 3d provides the histogram of the PCE values for 20 devices with and without MATC. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with the addition of MATC and methyl anthranilate was compared (Fig. S9 and Table S3, ESI†). The higher parameters of the MATC-based PSCs further demonstrate the superiority of triple-active-site MATC in perovskite defect passivation and film quality control.

To understand the enhanced photovoltaic performance, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to examine the defect states of the perovskite (Fig. S10, ESI†). According to the J–V curves, the onset voltage of trap-filled limit (VTFL) region of the hole-only device decreased from 0.421 V to 0.271 V after introducing MATC, and the electron-only device showed a similar phenomenon, which indicated that the trap density of the perovskite was significantly reduced benefiting from the defect passivation and the improved film quality,8 agreeing well with the elevated carrier lifetime of TRPL. Fig. S11 (ESI†) displays the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the incident light intensity. The device with MATC exhibited an α value (0.988) closer to unity compared to the pristine device (0.972), meaning the negligible bimolecular recombination in the system and more free carriers can be swept out and collected.8 The signally reduced slope (n = 1.21) of the MATC device suggests that the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination caused by trap states in the perovskite was effectively suppressed,3 which is consistent with the result of VTFL analysis and jointly accounts for the higher Voc and FF of PSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Fig. 4a) revealed that there was only one arc for both devices assigned to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).18 The larger Rrec value for the MATC device suggests a lower charge recombination rate.4,16,18 Moreover, we measured the dark J–V curves of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4b, the MATC-based device has smaller reverse current density (J0), indicating that the charge recombination in the device is effectively suppressed. Besides, in principle, the high frequency region can reflect the charge transport behavior of the device,18 and the higher current of the MATC device in the high frequency region is indicative of the more efficient charge transport, thanks to the efficient defect passivation and improved crystallization of the perovskite.18,19

Finally, we checked the stability of unencapsulated PSCs under different conditions. The device with MATC retained 64% of its initial efficiency after being stored in ambient air at ∼40% RH for 500 h, whereas the control device only kept 41% of its initial efficiency, as shown in Fig. 4d. The excellent ambient stability of the MATC device could be partly attributed to the enhanced hydrophobicity of perovskite films,14 confirmed by the increased water contact angle from 48.2° to 59.3° (Fig. 4c). For the thermal stability test (Fig. S12a, ESI†), the MATC-based device retained over 90% of its initial PCE after 800 h of thermal aging at 80 °C in a N2 filled glovebox, higher than 74.9% for the control device, which means that the ion migration in the perovskite was mitigated by introducing MATC.20 Besides, the MATC device exhibited superior long-term stability during storage in a N2 environment, and still maintained about 92% of the original PCE after 1500 h aging (Fig. S12b, ESI†). These impressive results confirm that MATC can effectively improve the stability of PSCs. In addition to reinforced hydrophobicity, the conjoint effects of improved crystal quality and reduced defect density largely contribute to the enhanced device stability.3
In summary, we have developed a rational additive molecule, namely MATC, which has been demonstrated to be able to simultaneously passivate the defects and improve the crystallization of perovskite for efficient and stable PSCs. The amino and carbonyl groups in MATC were revealed to preferentially interact with Pb2+, and the chemical interaction between the multifunctional groups of MATC and undercoordinated Pb2+ contributes to the synergetic defect passivation, which significantly suppressed the nonradiative charge recombination. In addition, the improved crystallization quality of the perovskite promoted the light absorption and charge transport. As a result, the Cs/FA-based PSCs with MATC yielded remarkably improved Voc, Jsc and FF, achieving a champion PCE of 21.51% with inhibited hysteresis. MATC also considerably improved the ambient, thermal and long-term stability of the unencapsulated PSC devices.
