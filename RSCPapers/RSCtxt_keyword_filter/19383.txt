    , Accepted 11th September 2019First published on 12th September 2019AbstractAfter the development of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) in 1974, its derivatives have been widely explored for optoelectronic applications. In this review we discuss various donor/acceptor functionalized DPPs which have been recently published and systematically compare their properties. The modification of donor functionalized DPPs to tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) bridged derivatives with improved acceptor strength and absorption in the near infra-red region has shown some exciting advancement in non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells and therapeutic agents in photothermal therapy and these are also described. The optoelectronic properties in relation to structural changes such as changes of the end capping groups, donor–acceptor moieties, aromatic moiety in the DPP core and number of DPP units in the molecular structure are discussed. We are expecting that the current review will provide guidelines for the exploration of new DPP based efficient materials for photovoltaic and biomedical applications.

Introduction
Organic small molecules with near infra-red (NIR) absorption have been widely used for organic solar cells (OSCs),1 sensors,2 nonlinear optics (NLO), electrochromic devices3 and photodynamic therapy.4 Design of a donor–acceptor (D–A) type architecture is one of the most widely used approaches for developing NIR absorbing materials with a low HOMO–LUMO gap.5 The structural modification of existing chromophores continues as a hot topic of interest among researchers for practical applications. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is an 8π electron, di-lactam system which acts as an electron acceptor.6 In recent years it has been potentially used in the field of organic photovoltaics7–9 and biomedical applications.10 The substitution of the end capping group at the 3- and/or 6-position of DPP perturbs the photonic properties of DPP significantly.5 The derivatives of DPP exhibit broad absorption in the visible region and possess good thermal stability.6 In order to improve the absorption of DPP in the NIR region, it has been substituted with various donors, acceptors and spacers in symmetrical and unsymmetrical fashions.7 In this regard various design approaches have been adopted and further explained in detail, such as: (a) incorporation of tetracyano-based electron withdrawing tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) into donor functionalized DPP,11 (b) coupling more than one DPP via different spacers, and (c) use of cobalt complexes as end capping units.
The chemical structures of the small molecules based on DPP (Chart 1) are systematically arranged as follows:

The present review focuses on the progress and development of NIR absorbing small molecules based on DPP for OSCs and photothermal therapy. We have systematically arranged these molecules in Chart 1 on the basis of the donor strength and the number of end capping groups and TCBD units in the molecule. The effects of changes in the end capping donors and number of TCBD units in the molecular architecture with respect to the photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as the impact on the performance of solar cells and photothermal devices are also described. Further use of donor functionalized DPPs as donors along with PC71BM for OSCs and as therapeutic agents in photothermal therapy is described with a comparison of their device efficiencies. The development of efficient TCBD bridged non-fullerene acceptors and therapeutic agents by a simple [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction of electron-rich acetylene substituted DPP with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) is also discussed in this review. The aim of this review is to identify common aspects which may provide some guidelines to researchers in order to design efficient molecular design for OSCs and photodynamic therapy.

1. Incorporation of TCBD into donor functionalized DPP. 
TCNE is a strong electron-withdrawing unit that readily undergoes an efficient [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction with electron-rich alkynes and is widely used for the development of organic materials for optoelectronic applications.19 Carbazole, triphenylamine, and ferrocene are the most widely used donors for the [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction in the design of efficient organic materials for various material applications.
The general methodology used for the synthesis of donor functionalized DPPs and their TCBD derivatives 1–24 is shown in Scheme 1.20–22 Symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor functionalized acetylene bridged DPPs were synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of donor functionalized acetylene with mono- and di-bromo DPP. Further donor functionalized DPPs on reaction with TCNE resulted in the formation of TCBD functionalized symmetrical and unsymmetrical DPPs in good yield.23

The incorporation of TCBD into donor functionalized DPP improves the accepting ability and changes the color of the resulting derivatives dramatically. The daylight photograph of N-phenyl carbazole substituted DPPs in dichloromethane solvent is shown in Fig. 1. The incorporation of TCBD changes the colour in N-phenyl carbazole based DPPs from pink (11) and blue (12) to green (13 and 14).

The solution state electronic absorption spectra of alkylated thienyl DPP exhibit absorption bands in the range of 400 nm to 550 nm. The solid state absorption is red shifted compared to the solution state absorption due to intermolecular interactions and π–π stacking. The substitution of electron donors at the 3- and 6-positions of DPP showed red shifted absorption bands over 600 nm.
The unsymmetrical and symmetrical substitution of electron donor groups on DPP showed absorption bands in the visible region of 500–700 nm. The incorporation of electron withdrawing TCBD into donor functionalized ethyne bridged DPPs showed a red shift of around 100 nm. The TCBD incorporation resulted in broad absorption bands in the visible to NIR region in the range of 550 nm to 900 nm. The substitution at both sides of DPP at the 3- and 6-positions showed red shifted absorption due to extended conjugation compared to substitution at only one side. Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of N-phenyl carbazole based DPPs 11–14 indicating that the substitution at both sides of DPP exhibited red shifted absorption compared to substitution at one side. The incorporation of TCBD into ethyne bridged N-phenyl carbazole based DPPs exhibited a red shift of >100 nm with broad absorption bands.

The electrochemical properties of donor and acceptor functionalized DPPs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Fig. 2b shows the cyclic voltammograms for reduction processes in N-phenyl carbazole functionalized DPPs 12 and 14, which exhibit one reduction wave in the case of ethyne bridged DPP 12 and additional two low voltage reduction waves in case of DPP 14 related to di- and tetra-anion radical formation at the TCBD moiety. The electrochemical investigation in the case of ferrocenyl and triphenylamine based DPP derivatives exhibited two reduction waves for ethyne bridged DPPs and four reduction waves for TCBD bridged DPPs. The incorporation of the electron withdrawing TCBD unit into the ethyne bridged DPP, resulted in additional reduction waves in the low voltage region.
Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations supported the investigation of a red shift in the absorption with the lowering of the HOMO–LUMO gap after the incorporation of the TCBD unit into donor functionalized DPP. It also provided an idea about the localization of the electron density and the transitions in the absorption spectra. DFT investigation showed the stabilization of both the HOMO and LUMO levels after the incorporation of TCBD into ethyne bridged DPP.


2. Coupling of more than one DPP unit. 
DPP was synthesized by the condensation reaction of thiophene-2-carbonitrile with dimethyl succinate in the presence of sodium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol solvent. The Stille coupling reaction strategy was used to synthesize di-substituted DPPs 28 and 29.24 The ethene and ethyne bridged di-substituted DPPs 28 and 29 were synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of mono bromo DPP with half an equivalent of bis(tributylstannyl)-ethene and bis(tributylstannyl)acetylene.25 The triphenylamine based tri-substitution of DPP 37 was synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction of triethynyl-triphenylamine with 3 equivalents of mono-bromo DPP.26
DPP based mono-substituted DPP, di-substituted DPPs 28 and 29 and tri-substituted DPP 37 exhibited absorption bands at 551 nm, 619 nm, 584 nm and 587 nm respectively (Fig. 3a). This shows that the dimerization of DPP results in a red shift of 68 nm in ethene bridged di-DPP substituted 28 and 33 nm in ethyne bridged di-DPP substituted 29, while a red shift of 36 nm was observed after the tri-substitution of DPP with tri-ethynyl triphenylamine as the central core, 37.
 Fig. 3  (a) Normalized absorption spectra and (b) frontier molecular orbitals of DPPs 28 and 37. 
The effect of the connecting bridge between DPP units and number of DPP units in the molecular architecture indicated the DPP dimer with an ethene bridge 28 as having good communication between the two DPP units. The red shifted absorption in ethene bridged di-substituted DPP 28 indicated superior electronic communication compared to the dimer analogue with an ethyne bridge (29). The absorption values indicated that the di-substitution and tri-substitution of DPP red shift the absorption and broadening of the absorption spectra was observed in di-substituted analogues 28 and 29. The red shift of the absorption was observed after di-substitution of DPP with an ethene bridge compared to tri-substitution with tri-ethynyl triphenylamine as the central core, which was further supported by theoretical investigation.
DFT study revealed that the sp3 hybrid N atom of triphenylamine breaks the electronic conjugation between the three arms, because of which tri-substituted DPP 37 shows a red shift of only 36 nm compared to a red shift of 68 nm observed after making the dimer with an ethene bridge between two DPP units 28. The breaking of the conjugation between the three arms can also be seen from the frontier molecular orbitals, which are shown in Fig. 3b. The electron density is localized all over the molecule in the HOMO as well as the LUMO in the case of DPP and dimer 28. On the other hand, in the case of tri-substituted DPP 37, the electron density is localized on all the three arms in the HOMO, and the LUMO is concentrated only on two arms, which are also separated from each other by the sp3 hybridized N atom of triphenylamine. This indicated that the sp3 hybridized N atom of triphenylamine breaks the conjugation between the three arms in tri-substituted DPP 37.
The Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of dibromo DPP with one equivalent of N-(4-ethynylphenyl) carbazole and N-(3-ethynylphenyl) carbazole resulted in the mono-N-phenyl carbazole substituted bromo derivatives of DPP, which further on a Stille coupling reaction with 0.4 equivalents of bis(tributylstannyl)acetylene formed N-phenyl carbazole end capped di-DPP substituted 32 and 33 respectively. The presence of additional ethynyl N-phenyl carbazole as an end capping donor in ethyne bridged dimer 29 red shifts the absorption of the resulting dimer by 44 nm in para-ethynyl N-phenyl carbazole substituted dimer 32, and it exhibited an absorption band at 628 nm. The presence of meta-ethynyl N-phenyl carbazole gave less red shifted absorption compared to its para analogue; it showed only a 37 nm red shift in 33 (absorption band observed at 621 nm), which indicated para-substitution is efficient compared to meta-substitution on the phenyl ring next to carbazole.
Yu et al. prepared two dimers of DPP connected by a phenyl ring 30 and a phenyl ring with two methyl groups 31. The DPP dimers 30 and 31 were prepared by the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between phenyl boronate ester and monobromo-DPP.27 They have also prepared tri-substituted DPP 34, with a benzene ring as the core and DPP as the arms.28 The TGA and DSC analysis of 34 exhibited only one melting peak at 227 °C indicating its high purity. The thermal decomposition temperature for 34 at 5% weight loss is 394 °C, which is higher than that of phenyl bridged dimers 30 (384 °C) and 31 (391 °C) due to the extended rigidity and larger molecular weight of the additional DPP moiety. The optical absorption spectra exhibited absorption maxima at 602, 573 and 555 nm for 30, 31 and 34 respectively. The electronic absorption spectrum of DPPs recorded in the thin film state was red shifted, and broadened compared to the absorption in solution. The optical band gap values for DPPs 30, 31 and 34 are 1.75, 1.82 and 1.95 eV respectively. The energy levels were calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials from cyclic voltammetry and the values of the HOMO/LUMO for 30, 31 and 34 are −5.16/−3.52, −5.18/−3.65 and −5.22/−3.27.
Zhang and co-workers reported ethyne bridged tri-substituted DPP 35 in which the 1,3,5-positions of the benzene ring are substituted.29 DPP 35 was synthesized by the use of Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of monobromo-DPP with 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in 72% yield, and the purity was checked with elemental analysis. TGA analysis shows that 35 is thermally stable at 300 °C and no clear phase transition was observed below 250 °C in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The absorption spectra of 35 in chloroform solution exhibited an absorption maximum at 584 nm and the optical band gap was 1.83 eV. Cyclic voltammetry study exhibited three reversible oxidation waves and one reduction wave. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for 35 were investigated on the basis of its onset of oxidation and reduction potentials and are −5.24 eV and 3.43 eV respectively. The computational calculation shows that the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of 35 are delocalized on the three DPP moieties and also on the tri-ethynyl benzene core.
Zhan et al. reported star shaped molecule 36 with triphenylamine as the core and DPP as the arms by the use of the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the tri-boronate ester of triphenylamine with monobromo-DPP.30 DPP 36 possesses good solubility in organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties were studied by TGA and differential scanning calorimety (DSC) for 36, which exhibited a decomposition temperature of 400 °C at 5% weight loss and a glass transition temperature of ca. 100 °C. No melting temperature was observed between room temperature and 250 °C, which suggests an amorphous nature of 36. The electronic absorption spectrum of 36 was recorded in dichloromethane solution and the absorption maximum was observed at 596 nm and in a thin film red shifted broader absorption was observed. The optical band gap calculated from the onset of absorption was 1.85 eV. Electrochemical study on 36 was conducted in 0.1 M acetonitrile solution, which showed irreversible reduction and reversible oxidation waves. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for 36 calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction are −5.26 and −3.26 eV respectively.
The DPP derivatives 38–43 in which DPPs were attached to spirobifluorene by single bonds and triple bonds were synthesized by Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions in 40–64% yield.31 Thermogravimetric analysis exhibited thermal decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss for 38–40 of 402, 375, and 280 °C respectively, which indicated that a branched chain is useful in terms of thermal stability compared to that of a linear alkyl chain. The decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss for 41–43 are almost the same, around 300 °C. The electronic absorption spectra in dichloromethane solution show two absorption bands, one weak absorption band in the 300–400 nm region and another strong absorption band in the 450–650 nm region due to intramolecular charge transfer in the DPP moiety. The introduction of triple bonds in 38–40 blue shifts the absorption by ∼10 nm in DPPs 41–43. A similar absorption spectrum was observed for DPPs 38–43, indicating that the absorption is not dependent on the alkyl side chains. The thin film absorption spectra for DPPs 38–43 exhibited red shifts of 26–33 nm due to enhanced π–π interactions. Cyclic voltammetry study exhibited reversible multiple oxidations in DPPs 38–43 due to successive oxidations of different types of DPPs in the molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the incorporation of the triple bond has only a minor influence on the energy levels.
Bhosale et al. synthesized a highly conjugated molecule based on tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as the core and DPP as the end capping group, 44.32 The Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of TPE tetra-boronate ester with monobromo-DPP at 100 °C with Na2CO3 as a base resulted in DPP 44 with 43% yield. The electronic absorption spectrum of DPP 44 in chloroform solution exhibited an absorption maximum at 590 nm and when recorded in a thin film a red shift of 31 nm was observed. DFT study shows that the electron density was located on the whole molecule in the HOMO as well as in the LUMO. DFT study also indicated that the torsional angle between the thiophene ring planes of DPP and phenyl ring planes of TPE was ∼20°.


3. Use of cobalt complexes as linking groups to DPP. 
The NIR absorbing, organometallic cobalt dithiolene complex 45 was synthesized by the reaction of cyclopentadienyl cobalt(I) dicarbonyl and sulfur with di-ethynyl DPP.33 The electronic absorption spectra of 45 exhibited two absorption bands, one in the NIR region, which is broad with low intensity compared to the other band in the visible region, which is more intense (Fig. 4a). The broad absorption band in the NIR region was observed in the 750–1050 nm wavelength region. The functionalization of the cobalt–dithiolene moiety exhibited red shifted absorption by 16 nm in the vis-NIR region compared to substitution of the ferrocenyl moiety on DPP (21). The FMOs (Fig. 4b) show that the electron density on the HOMO is mainly located on the DPP core whereas the LUMO is located on the organometallic cobalt dithiolene complex.

Generally in DPP containing derivatives the di-lactam ring of DPP only contributes to the LUMO, indicating its acceptor nature. In cobalt dithiolene complex of DPP 45, a reverse case was observed which is due to electron deficient 16-electron complex formation in the cobalt containing moiety. This indicated the transfer of electron density from DPP to the cobalt dithiolene complex (here the DPP unit acts as the donor). On the other hand in ferrocene substituted DPP (organometallic ferrocene is an 18 electron system) the electron density in both the HOMO and LUMO is localized on the DPP core with the thiophene rings as in DPP.
The electron deficient nature of the 16 electron cobalt dithiolene complex was also explained by electrochemical investigation. Two one electron reduction waves of low intensity in the cobalt dithiolene complex were observed in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at around −1.30 to 1.55 V (Fig. 4c), which is consistent with literature values.34,35

Emission and thermal properties
The derivatives of DPP exhibit exceptional photochemical and thermal stability and hence are used as high performance pigments in paints, inks, plastics and in device fabrication. The thermal stability of materials was investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The derivatives of DPP shown in Chart 1 showed good thermal stability and it was observed that after incorporation of the electron withdrawing TCBD unit, the thermal stability was lowered in the case of triphenylamine and N-phenyl carbazole substituted DPPs. On the other hand the use of thermally stable organometallic ferrocene as an end capping donor exhibited high thermal stability and after incorporation of TCBD, the thermal stability of the resulting ferrocenyl derivatives was improved (Fig. 5a). The decomposition temperatures (Td) for 5% or 10% weight loss are in the 350–420 °C range, indicating good thermal stability, which clearly shows that these materials reduce the possibility of molecule degradation and morphology deformation for fabrication of solar cells.

DPP has gained the attention of the research community due to its application as a fluorescent probe compared to other organic dyes. The DPP derivatives exhibit excellent photostability and high fluorescence quantum yield. But the functionalization of DPP with donors results in a decrease in the fluorescent nature. Moreover the functionalization with organometallic moieties such as ferrocene and cobalt dithiolene and incorporation of TCBD units completely quench the fluorescence. The fluorescence spectra of N-phenyl carbazole substituted DPPs 11–14 are shown in Fig. 5b. The ethyne bridged DPPs (11 and 12) are fluorescent in nature but the TCBD derivatives (13 and 14) are non-fluorescent in nature. The quenching of fluorescence was observed due to self-absorption (overlap of the absorption and the emission spectrum) and quenching can also occur due to photoinduced charge transfer from the TCBD to the DPP moiety. The ethene and ethyne bridged di-substituted DPPs (28 and 29) are fluorescent in nature but additional substitution of the ethynyl N-phenyl carbazole unit in 32 and 33 leads to the quenching of fluorescence. The quenching of fluorescence is helpful in photothermal therapy, which is explained in the application section.
Applications of DPP based small molecules
DPP is widely used for various applications such as solar cells (dye-sensitized, bulk heterojunction, and perovskite solar cells), organic light emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, florescence sensors, laser dyes, photothermal therapy, bioimaging, electroluminescence and liquid crystals.6,27,36 It also used as a high performance pigment in plastics, paints and inks.37 Herein the use of donor/acceptor functionalized DPPs for organic solar cells and photothermal therapy is described.

1. Photovoltaics. 
a. As donors. 
The substitution at the 3- and 6-positions of DPP with an electron donor moiety results in D–A systems. The strong D–A interaction of adjacent thiophenes with DPP gives a low lying LUMO and high lying HOMO of small molecules based on DPP. Hence DPP derivatives have been reported with low band gaps and well-ordered structure in thin films and exhibit high current density in OSCs. The optical and electrochemical properties of di-substituted DPP with a ethene bridge 28 and acetylene bridge 29 indicated their applicability as donor materials for OSCs. When DPPs 28 and 29 were used as a donor along with the PC71BM acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, maximum power conversion efficiencies up to 5.28% and 5.52% were obtained respectively.38
In the context of improving the absorption of DPP, triphenylamine moieties were attached to DPP in symmetrical and unsymmetrical ways and the frontier energy levels suggested that molecules 1 and 2 can be used as electron donors for BHJ OSCs (Chart 2). DPP 1 and 2 when used along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor for OSCs showed PCEs of 2.23% and 3.05% respectively.39 Another donor carbazole was attached in place of the triphenylamine donor to DPP (11 and 12) and used as a donor along with the PC71BM acceptor for BHJ-OSCs, exhibiting PCEs of 4.65% and 5.73% for 11 and 12 respectively.40 Further, thermally stable organometallic donor ferrocene was employed as a donor for the synthesis of symmetrical DPP 21. The photophysical, electrochemical, and thermal properties and energy levels of 21 were studied, which showed absorption in the visible region and low HOMO–LUMO gaps, which are suitable for use of 21 as a donor for BHJ OSCs. DPP 21 has shown a high PCE of 6.44% as a donor along with the PC71BM acceptor in BHJ-OSCs,41 which demonstrated that ferrocene donors will be a useful tool for making highly efficient materials for BHJ OSCs.
 Chart 2  Chemical structures of DPP based donors used in solar cells. 
There are number of reports where porphyrin derivatives have been used as donors in organic solar cells and showed high PCEs up to 9%.42 Porphyrin is an electron rich π-conjugated moiety and its electronic distribution in the FMOs is almost the same, which is not favorable for exciton dissociation and charge generation.43 On the other hand DPP is an electron deficient moiety and combined with porphyrin makes a donor–acceptor molecular system. On this basis, Peng et al. reported various disubstituted DPP derivatives as a donor and achieved PCEs in the range of 7–9% (Chart 3).44–46 Small molecules based on a number of ethyne bridged electron deficient DPP units connected to porphyrin, DPPs 49–54, were reported for solar cells. When these DPPs 49–54 were used as donors along with fullerene acceptor PC61BM for organic solar cells, PCEs of 8.45, 6.42, 8.36, 9.06, 8.24 and 7.23% were observed respectively.47 Very recently Matsuo et al. developed tetra-DPP substituted Mg-tetraethynylporphyrin DPP 55 as a small molecule donor and used it for solar cells along with the PC61BM acceptor, exhibiting a PCE of 7.40% after solvent vapor annealing treatment.48 A variety of disubstituted DPPs linked with various aromatic moieties, DPPs 56–59, were used as small molecule donors for organic solar cells and achieved power conversion efficiencies in the range of 4–6%.49–52

b. As non-fullerene acceptors. 
The improved acceptor strength, absorption in the visible to NIR region, good thermal stability, low band gap and tunable frontier orbital energy levels matching polymer donors indicated that the TCBD derivatives of DPP can be used as a promising candidates for non-fullerene acceptors in photovoltaic devices. The triphenylamine substituted DPPs with TCBD bridges 3 and 5 were used as non-fullerene acceptors along with polymer donor P1 and achieved respectable power conversion efficiencies up to 3.90% and 4.95% respectively.53 Further, in an attempt to increase the performance, carbazole was used as an end capping donor due to its electron donating nature and good charge transport ability. The carbazole based TCBD derivatives 13 and 14 were reported as non-fullerene acceptor OSCs along with polymer donor P2. The di-N-phenyl carbazole substituted DPP 14 exhibited the maximum PCE up to 7.19%.54 The incorporation of TCBD into ethyne bridged donor substituted DPPs decreases the thermal stability in the case of DPPs with triphenylamine and N-phenyl carbazole as end capping donors.
The incorporation of TCBD into ethyne bridged ferrocene substituted DPP resulted in TCBD derivatives with improved thermal stability. The ferrocenyl based TCBD derivatives 22 and 24 were used as acceptors along with the P3 polymer donor, achieving a PCE of 6.89% for 24.55 The evaluation of the device parameters revealed that the di-substitution of DPP with end capping donors exhibited a higher PCE compared to mono-substitution of DPP. This is related to the broad absorption spectra in the NIR region and more balanced charge transport in di-substituted DPPs compared to mono-substituted DPPs. The results also demonstrate that employing thermally stable end capping donor units and incorporation of strong acceptors in DPP can provide new opportunities for designing highly efficient acceptors for OSCs and can also achieve milestones in solar cell development.
Yu and co-workers reported 30 and 31, which showed absorption bands in the visible region, good thermal stability and low band gaps, suggesting that they can be used as non-fullerene acceptors.28 They used 30 and 31 for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells as non-fullerene acceptors along with polymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.48% and 0.65% respectively. In another report, tri-DPP substituted benzene cored DPP 34 was synthesized by Brandt et al. When DPP 34 was used as a non-fullerene acceptor combined with polymer donor P3HT, a PCE of 0.54% was obtained.29 It was observed that the PCE was dependent on the processing-method. The order of PCEs for the spin-coated devices was 31 (0.65%) > 30 (0.48%) > 34 (0.31%), however the order of PCEs for the roll-coated devices was 34 (0.54%) > 31 (0.43%) > 30 (0.04%), which indicated that the molecular structure and processing method affect the performance of non-fullerene acceptors.
The non-fullerene acceptor with DPP substitution at the 1,3,5-positions of benzene via an ethyne bridge 35 was reported by Zhang and co-workers.30 The devices based on P3HT:35, adjusting the D/A weight ratio with thermal annealing (TA) treatment, showed a maximum PCE of 1.08% with high current density (Voc) up to 1.11 V, which was related to the large energy difference (1.33 eV) between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of 35.
The star shaped non-fullerene acceptor with a triphenylamine core and DPP arms 36 was developed by the Suzuki coupling reaction of the tri-boronate ester of triphenylamine with monobromo-DPP.31 The optical band gap of 36 in a film was estimated from the onset of absorption as 1.84 eV. The absorption in the visible region, good thermal stability and low band gap suggested that it can be used as a non-fullerene acceptor. When 36 was used as an acceptor along with the P3HT polymer donor, a PCE of 0.54% was obtained with a Voc of 1.12 V.
Russell et al. reported 38–43 in which DPP is used as the arms and spirobifluorene (SF) as the central core.32 The X-shaped spiro-dimer of DPP-fluorene-DPP exhibited a twisted geometry, which suppresses strong intermolecular aggregation. The alkyl chains 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl, and n-dodecyl were used to functionalize the N-positions of the DPP moiety. When 38–43 were used as non-fullerene acceptors along with the P3HT donor, different PCEs were obtained with the highest PCE of 3.63% for 38. The PCE results demonstrated that the choice of alkyl side chain substitution on DPPs plays a key role in the morphology change and device performance.
Bhosale et al. reported tetra-DPP functionalized tetraphenylethylene cored molecule 44.3344 has strong absorption in the visible region and good thermal stability and showed matching energy levels with routinely used polymer donor P3HT for organic solar cells and achieved a maximum PCE of 3.86% with a Voc of 1.18 V.
Langa et al. recently reported three molecules with DPP as the central core and dicyanorhodanine acceptors which are connected by an ethynyl bridge and a thiophene donor unit, 46 and 47 (Chart 4).56 When DPPs 46 and 47 were used as non-fullerene acceptors along with small molecule donor SMD1, PCEs of 6.28% and 7.76% were achieved. Further, they modified the structure of the DPP based acceptor by attaching additional alkyl chains on the thiophene spacer, 48, and used it as a non-fullerene acceptor along with small molecule donor SMD2, achieving a high PCE of 9.05%.57

2. Photothermal therapy. 
Xiaochen Dong and co-workers developed triphenylamine functionalized furyl-DPP 25,58 thienyl-DPP 2659 and selenophene-DPP 2760 for photothermal cancer therapy (Chart 5) and observed that D–A functionalized DPPs have shown promising performance as a therapeutic agent for photothermal therapy. When they used the triphenylamine functionalized furyl-DPP 25, thienyl-DPP 26 and selenophene-DPP 27 for photothermal therapy, photothermal conversion efficiencies of 47%, 34.5% and 37.9% were observed respectively, which indicated that the furan containing DPP exhibited higher photothermal conversion efficiency compared to the thiophene and selenophene containing DPPs.
 Chart 5  Triphenylamine and ferrocenyl functionalized DPPs for photothermal therapy. 
In order to further improve the photothermal conversion efficiency, they have chosen a furyl-DPP central core, as its steric hindrance is smaller compared to thienyl-DPP, which will result in better co-planarity, hence furyl-DPP was used over thienyl-DPP. On the other hand in the case of solar cell application thienyl-DPP is generally preferred over furyl-DPP as the band gap of thienyl-DPP is lower than that of furyl-DPP, which plays an important role in the performance of solar cells. Another component ferrocene was chosen as it is a cancer therapeutic agent itself, and also a good electron donor, which helps in quenching of fluorescence and singlet-oxygen production via the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process, which enhances non-radiative transitions. It has also been reported that nanoparticles containing iron are beneficial for applications in photothermal therapy. The TCBD unit was selected as it is a strong acceptor and its incorporation into a D–A system red shifts the absorbance toward the NIR region and promotes the PET process. On the basis of these assumptions Dong et al. synthesized molecule 19 and used its nanoparticles as a cancer theranostic agent for photothermal therapy and achieved a respectable photothermal conversion efficiency of 59.1% (Chart 5), which is higher than triphenylamine functionalized DPPs.61

Conclusions and future scope
The present review highlights various methodologies used for the tuning of absorption in the NIR region. The variation of the D/A strength resulted in the significant tuning of the HOMO–LUMO gap. The incorporation of strong cyano-based TCBD acceptor units in ethyne bridged DPP, coupling of more than one DPP unit and use of cobalt complexes as linking groups to DPP resulted in the extension of the absorption towards the NIR region. The NIR absorbing DPP derivatives have shown exciting advancement as non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs and as therapeutic agents in photothermal therapy. Further structural modification along with optimization of reaction conditions and device properties will provide the materials with tunable optoelectronic properties and give efficient materials for OSCs and photothermal therapy.
