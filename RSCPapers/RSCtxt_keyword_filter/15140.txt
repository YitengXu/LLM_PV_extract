    , Accepted 6th May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractWe have synthesized and characterized three perylene diimides, X-PDI, where X = H, F, or Br. These three compounds have been tested for the substitution of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Although the efficiency of PDI derivative-based conventional PVSCs is as high as 17.6% (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 8724), the corresponding performance of inverted PVSCs is still lagging behind and improvement is necessary. For electron accepting (from CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite) and electron transporting properties of the materials, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, direct current conductivity, space-charge limited current (SCLC) electron mobility, atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface morphology, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy gauging charge-trapping have been studied. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels are 5.94/4.00, 5.83/3.96, 6.00/3.97, and 5.48/3.73 eV for H-PDI, F-PDI, Br-PDI, and PC61BM, respectively. Direct current conductivities of H-PDI, F-PDI, Br-PDI, and PC61BM are 8.71 × 10−8, 1.18 × 10−9, 2.2 × 10−6, and 8.42 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The SCLC electron mobility of H-PDI, F-PDI, Br-PDI, and PC61BM are 1.12 × 10−4, 8.31 × 10−6, 1.08 × 10−3, and 5.00 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. PL spectroscopy of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite provides emission at wavelength of 781 nm, which is the same as for the perovskite layer covered with a thin film of H-PDI or F-PDI. However, the emission wavelength was blue-shifted to 773–774 nm when the perovskite layer was covered with a thin film of Br-PDI or PC61BM. Using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, the solubility (in chloroform) was determined as 1.2 × 10−2, 8.7 × 10−2 and >10−1 mol L−1 for F-PDI, H-PDI, and Br-PDI, respectively. In thin film state, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy indicated that the extent of molecular aggregation was F-PDI ≫ H-PDI > Br-PDI, which is consistent with the AFM-estimated root-mean-square roughness of F-PDI > H-PDI > Br-PDI ∼ PC61BM. Without the solution processed ZnO NP cathode buffer layer (CBL), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of H-PDI, F-PDI, Br-PDI, and PC61BM PVSCs is ∼1%, ∼0%, 3.2%, and 4.1%, respectively. With the ZnO NP CBL, PCE is ∼7.8%, ∼0%, 10.5%, and 11.1% for H-PDI, F-PDI, Br-PDI, and PC61BM PVSCs, respectively. Through this study, we have demonstrated that the simple mono-bromine substituted perylene diimide (Br-PDI), is solution processable and has potential for use as a non-fullerene electron accepting and electron transporting material in inverted PVSCs.
Introduction
Since 2013, there has been great development in the field of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), which have the advantages of low cost, simple fabrication and high efficiency.1–4 To date, the certified maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has reached 21.1%.5 Based on either mesoscopic or planar device architectures, PVSCs are typically composed of a light harvesting perovskite layers sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). For an inverted construction of planar PVSCs, the conventional transport layers are poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the HTL and ETL, respectively.6 In addition to the solution process compatible with perovskite materials, polymer PEDOT:PSS has been widely used as an HTL for inverted PVSCs, due to its good conductivity (0.014 S cm−1)7 and small work function of 5.0 eV. On the other hand, the C60 fullerene derivative, PC61BM, is usually chosen as the solution processed ETL because of (i) the high conductivity (0.016 mS cm−1)7 or impressive electron mobility (space-charge limited mobility 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),8 which is expected to reduce the current density (J)–voltage (V) hysteresis with respect to the scan direction because of the balanced charge carriers of the devices; (ii) a relatively deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −4.15 eV,9 which is energetically favourable for extracting electrons from perovskite excitons. Due to these good physical features, few other organic materials are better than PC61BM as ETL for inverted PVSCs. However, PC61BM is not photochemically stable and it is prone to aggregate, resulting a thin film with poor morphology that impairs the physical features mentioned above. Therefore, non-fullerene type ETLs, particularly those suitable for inverted PVSCs, are in high demand.
The perylene diimide (PDI) compounds are n-type semiconductors with relatively low LUMO energy levels in a range of 3.5–4.3 eV,10,11 due to the electron affinity of the imide portions. Their high electron mobility (space-charge limited mobility of 0.2–1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1)12–14 and conductivity (4.4 × 10−2 ∼ 3.3 × 10−3 S cm−1)15,16 originate from the rigid and planar π-skeleton, which is prone to ordered molecular packing. In addition to three reports about bis(N,N′-dimethylaminopropyl)perylene diimide (N-PDI),17 bis(N,N′-2,4-difluorophenyl)perylene diimide (dFPh-PDI),18 and N,N′-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-5,11-dioctylcoronene-2,3,8,9-tetracarboxdiimide19 as ETL in conventional PVSCs, there are only two reports about inverted PVSCs, which are more pertinent to the study herein; they are N,N-dioxide of bis(N,N′-dimethylaminopropyl)perylene diimide (PDINO)20,21 and 1,1′-di-perylene diimide (diPDI).22 The inverted configuration of PVSCs are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx/PC61BM/PDINO/Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/diPDI:DMBI/TiO2/Al, respectively. In the case of PDINO PVSC, PCE as high as 14.0% was achieved, although PDINO was actually used as a cathode buffer layer (CBL) or cathode interlayer (CIL) instead of ETL.21 In the case of diPDI PVSC, PCE as high as 10.0% was achieved, but an n-type dopant (1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole: DMBI) had to be included in the ETL. Otherwise, PCE of 7.1% was the best result without DMBI dopant in diPDI ETL.
There are a number of literature reports having ZnO as CBL or CIL in polymer-based bulk heterojunction conventional solar cells.23–25 In addition to the low cost and ambient stability of ZnO, a combination effect of hole-blocking (reducing charge recombination), enhancing electron extraction (or selection), preventing diffusion of cathode metal into the active layer through the interspace of incomplete ETL, and the optical spacer effect has been attributed to the improvement of the device performance. To our surprise, in surveying literature, only three previous reports have mentioned solution processed ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as CBL or CIL in a series of inverted PVSCs.26–28 Potentially, there could be an interdissolving problem for the perovskite material when applying ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) solution (in ethanol) by a solution process, if the ETL thin film has a low surface coverage and forms aggregates with large interspaces between aggregate domains. The solvent of ZnO NPs may leak through the ETL thin film, reaching the perovskite layer underneath, and may generate a straight up tunnel facilitating the direct contact of the deposited cathode metal.
In this report, we demonstrate two structures of simple mono-halogen-substituted X-PDI, i.e., F-PDI (X = F) and Br-PDI (X = Br), in addition to the parent H-PDI (X = H) (Fig. 1), to replace the commonly used PC61BM as ETL in inverted MAPbI3 (MA: methylammonium) PVSCs. With the addition of ZnO NPs as a CBL or CIL on the top of the ETL, we have successfully fabricated PVSCs with improved PCEs. A respectable PCE of 10.5% has been reached by Br-PDI/ZnO NP PVSC, which is comparable with 11.1% of PVSCs based on PC61BM/ZnO NP. Whereas PVSCs based on H-PDI are inferior to those based on Br-PDI, F-PDI PVSCs exhibit virtually no photovoltaic effect, regardless of the presence of ZnO NPs. We have conducted a series of experiments to find out the reasons why Br-PDI is better than H-PDI and why F-PDI is so poor for PVSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Each X-PDI was prepared consecutively in a three-step synthetic procedure (Scheme 1). The synthesis started from the imidization of a commonly available commercial product of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic di-anhydride. From the reaction with 2-ethyl-1-hexylamine under refluxing conditions in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidione (NMP), H-PDI was obtained with near quantitative isolation yields (97%). In fact, H-PDI is a known compound in literature.29–31 Following the same literature procedure, Br-PDI was afforded from a room temperature reaction of H-PDI and bromine in dichloromethane, although 34% was the best isolation yield after purification by column chromatography. F-PDI is a previously unknown compound and its synthetic procedure was modified from a literature report of a 1,7-difluoro-substituted perylene diimide derivative.32 Synthetic details and the characterization data of F-DPI can be found in the experimental section.

Absorption spectroscopic properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra for both X-PDI chloroform solution (10−5 mol L−1) and spin-coated thin film; their data are summarized in Table 1. The spectra (300–600 nm) of X-PDI in solution mainly consist of π–π* electronic transitions associated with a series of characteristic vibronic structures.33,34 They are 0–0, 0–1, 0–2, and maybe 0–3 transitions, with λmax absorptions at 520–525, 484–489, 454–459, 430–433 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of the spin-coated thin film all show broadening, splitting, and red-shifted absorption bands, for which the relative intensities of the vibronic structures are quite different from those of solution spectra. All these changes in spectroscopic features indicate a significant molecular interaction of X-PDI taking place in the solid state (as thin film). In addition, F-PDI has a most intense absorption band at around 633 nm in Fig. 2b, which can be ascribed to the strong molecular interactions (π–π, F–π, F–F interactions) of F-PDI in the solid state. Moreover, the high-rise base line observed in the spectrum of F-PDI thin film can be attributed to the scattering of near infrared and the long wavelength of visible light, which is consistent with the pronounced inhomogeneity of the F-PDI thin film. On the other hand, molecular interaction of X-PDI is also reflected in the solubility. Based on Beer's law of absorption spectroscopic measurement, F-PDI has the worst solubility (1.2 × 10−2 mol L−1), followed by H-PDI (8.7 × 10−2 mol L−1), which is relatively better than F-DPI. The solubility of Br-PDI (>10−1 mol L−1) is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of F-PDI. In this regard, F-PDI has the strongest molecular interaction in the solid state, whereas Br-PDI has the weakest molecular interaction in the solid state. The bulky bromine substituent inhibits the π–π stacking of Br-PDI in the solid state, and a higher solubility was observed for Br-PDI than H-PDI in solution. Considering the solubility and molecular interaction, the homogeneity or quality of solution-processed Br-PDI thin film should be better than that of H-PDI or F-PDI. Such speculation has been verified in the AFM study (see the following section for results and discussion of thin film surface morphology).

 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of X-PDI in chloroform solution (a) and as thin film (b). 
As can be seen in Fig. 3a, all voltammograms of X-PDI or PC61BM in dichloromethane show two reversible or semi-reversible reduction signals in the negative potential around −1.0 V, relative to the oxidation potential of ferrocene (Fc → Fc+). Based on the solution's first reduction potential (Ered11/2), all X-PDI have a slightly weaker electron affinity than that of PC61BM, indicating that the three X-PDI reported here are potential electron acceptors, like PC61BM, for perovskite material. Here, we have found that the mono fluorine or bromine substituent slightly affects the reduction potential of H-PDI. However, in the thin film measurement (Fig. 3b), there seems to be only one reduction signal for the three X-PDI and PC61BM in voltammograms at around −1.10 to −1.14 V, and they are all less negative than −1.37 V of PC61BM. Just considering the energy levels of LUMO or Ered11/2 in the solid state, all X-PDI are better electron acceptors than PC61BM for perovskite materials. Comparing solution and thin film data, it is interesting to note that the shifting of energy levels is more pronounced in HOMO than in LUMO energy levels. Moreover, the shifting of the HOMO energy level is of the order F-PDI > H-PDI > Br-PDI, which is consistent with the order of molecular interaction and solubility found for X-PDI series.
Direct current conductivity of X-PDI and PC61BM
The DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0) can be determined from the slope of the current–voltage (I–V) plot. Fig. 4 shows the I–V characteristics of ITO/X-PDI or PC61BM/Al devices. The thicknesses of the thin films are 200, 260, 250, and 280 nm for PC61BM, H-PDI, F-PDI, and Br-PD, respectively. The corresponding DC σ0s of PC61BM, H-PDI, F-PDI, and Br-PDI are 8.42 × 10−6, 8.71 × 10−8, 1.18 × 10−9, and 2.2 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. Among X-PDI, Br-PDI has the highest DC σ0, which is the same order of magnitude, compared to PC61BM. Therefore, it can be expected that the charge carriers generated in the MAPbI3 layer will be more efficiently transported through PC61BM or Br-PDI than H-PDI or F-PDI. On the other hand, among X-PDI, F-PDI has the lowest DC σ0, which can be attributed to its poor thin film morphology and the relatively low solubility.

Space charge limited current – electron mobility
The charge carrier transport of X-PDI and PC61BM ETLs was studied using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) approach. The electron mobilities determined from a series of electron-dominated devices are summarized in Table 3. The electron-dominated devices studied herein are ITO/ZnO/X-PDI (or PC61BM)/Ca/Al and ITO/ZnO/X-PDI (or PC61BM)/ZnO NP/Ca/Al, with and without ZnO NP layers, respectively.

Fig. 5a shows the J–V characteristics of electron-dominated devices of X-PDI and PC61BM without ZnO NP. The electron mobility of Br-PDI is 1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is significantly better than that of H-PDI or F-PDI, about 10 and 130 times higher, respectively. The electron mobility of Br-PDI is the same order of magnitude as PC61BM. In fact, electron mobility determined from SCLC follows the same trend of DC σ0 found for X-PDI and PC61BM. We also took the X-PDI and PC61BM in the fabrication of an electron-dominated device with ZnO NP top contact layer. As the data show in Table 3 and Fig. 5b and d, the electron mobility of X-PDI and PC61BM was improved by 1.55–17 and ∼5 times, respectively, compared to those without the ZnO NP top contact layer. Our SCLC measurements have demonstrated that the thin film electron mobility of Br-PDI is far more superior than that of F-PDI. Since the LUMO energy levels of X-PDI are not much different from each other, we ascribe the difference in determined electron mobility to the morphology of the thin film, of which the surface roughness was found to be the lowest in the case of Br-PDI (see the following AFM section). In addition, due to the improvement of electron mobility by ZnO NP, we expect that adopting ZnO NP as the CBL in Br-PDI or PC61BM PVSCs can greatly decrease the series resistance (Rs) and largely enhance the fill factor (FF).

Thin film surface morphology of X-PDI, PC61BM, and ZnO NP
To investigate the changes in morphology of X-PDI solution spin-coated MAPbI3 perovskite films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in tapping mode. A two-step sequential deposition method was used to prepare high-quality MAPbI3 perovskite film, and its preparation details can be found in our previous work.35,36X-PDI or PC61BM chloroform solution was spin-coated on the perovskite substrate. As shown in Fig. 6a–d, an inhomogeneous surface morphology with high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness, as high as 18.8 and 25.4 nm, was observed for H-PDI and F-PDI, respectively. Notably better thin films with lower RMS roughness of 9.5 and 10.4 nm were found for Br-PDI and PC61BM, respectively. A similar trend of RMS roughness was also found for ZnO NP-covered X-PDI or PC61BM thin film (Fig. 6e–h); i.e., the F-PDI sample had the highest surface roughness, whereas the surface roughness of H-PDI sample was in between, and the Br-PDI sample had the lowest surface roughness. The Br-PDI and PC61BM thin films showed the flattest surface with a height variation less than ∼50 nm, which is substantially smaller than ∼100 nm and ∼150 nm of H-PDI and F-PDI thin films, respectively. The F-PDI had the most uneven and roughest surface morphology, which may be attributed to the strong molecular interaction due to the fluorine substituent, causing a high degree of aggregation in thin film. This is consistent with what we found for the broadening and red-shifted thin film absorption spectrum of F-PDI (Fig. 2b) and its relatively low solubility in solution.

The scanning size of the images is 5 μm × 5 μm. The scale of the colour bar is 0–125 nm (for a–d) and 0–300 nm (for e–h). 
Corresponding SEM images of MAPBI3/H-PDI, MAPBI3/F-PDI, MAPBI3/Br-PDI, and MAPBI3/PC61BM are shown in Fig. 7a–d, respectively. Apparently, Fig. 7 reveals a similar trend of surface roughness in terms of the number of dark domains in the image of X-PDI or PC61BM thin films on the perovskite active layer.
 Fig. 7  SEM images (∼5 × 5 μm) of X-PDI or PC61BM thin films on perovskite active layer. 
Accordingly, it is foreseeable that Br-PDI and PC61BM thin films will have a more extensive contact or a higher surface coverage of perovskite layer, which facilitates a more effective electron transfer across the MAPbI3/ETL interface in PVSCs. Except for F-PDI, the ZnO NP CBL or CIL can further enhance such electron transfer and consequent electron transport to the cathode, because the thin film surface roughness was more or less reduced.
Charge-trap estimation of MAPbI3/X-PDI interface by photoluminescence
Photoluminescence (PL) is a simple method to study the charge- trap effect between the surface of the perovskite film and ETL. Huang and co-workers37,38 reported that the existence of surface trap states on the perovskite surface or grain boundary could cause band bending close to the surface of the film, lowering the surface bandgap more than the bulk. Therefore, we performed steady-state PL measurements to study the MAPbI3/ETL interface in devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/ETL/air. Using an excitation light of 532 nm, which has a power of penetration length shorter than 100 nm, much less than the thickness of the perovskite films (∼300 nm), we can ensure a surface probing experiment. As shown in Fig. 8a, with incident excitation light from the air side, the pristine perovskite film showed a PL peak at 781 nm, which is the same wavelength as the perovskite film covered with H-PDI or F-PDI, but not Br-PDI or PC61BM. The perovskite film covered with Br-PDI or PC61BM exhibited a blue-shifted PL peaked at 774 and 773 nm, respectively. Such PL wavelength difference did not occur if the excitation light was from the ITO side (Fig. 8b). Our PL study indicates that both Br-PDI and PC61BM passivate the trap states close to the top surface of the perovskite film. Accordingly, both Br-PDI and PC61BM have better interfacial contact (and hence more efficient electron extraction) of perovskite material than H-PDI or F-PDI.

Photovoltaic characterization
The PVSCs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/X-PDI or PC61BM/Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/X-PDI or PC61BM/ZnO NP/Ag were fabricated and characterized. The detailed fabrication procedures of these devices can be found in the experimental section. The characterization data for all PVSCs are summarized in Table 4. The corresponding current density (J) and voltage (V) plots of PVSCs without ZnO NP CBL are illustrated in Fig. 9.

 Fig. 9  
J–V characteristics of X-DPI and PC61BM PVSCs without CBL of ZnO NP under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. 
As shown by the Frontier energy levels of each layer in Fig. 1a, the stepwise alignment of energy levels from CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer to Ag cathode facilitates transport and collection of electrons. Energy wise, this is true for each X-PDI, PC61BM, and ZnO NP. Since the LUMO energy level of each X-PDI is lower than that of PC61BM, the HOMO energy level of each X-PDI is higher than that of PC61BM, and electron extraction and hole blocking are presumably better for MAPbI3/X-PDI than for MAPbI3/PC61BM. However, the molecular interaction (aggregation in solid state) and the thin film morphology have a more critical role for the ETL studied herein.
For the devices with PC61BM ETL (as the control PVSL), an average PCE of 4.13% was achieved. For the devices with X-PDI ETL, very low average PCE of 0.66% was recorded for H-PDI PVSCs and virtually no photovoltaic effect was found for F-PDI PVSCs. As evident in spectroscopic and microscopic studies, F-PDI has strong molecular interactions (π–π, F–π, F–F interactions) and hence a serious aggregation in the solid state, whereas both H-PDI and Br-PDI are less serious. The molecular aggregation causes defects in the thin film, leading to an inhomogeneous and incomplete thin film of ETL on top of MAPbI3. In this regard, Br-PDI outperforms H-PDI or F-PDI, and its device performance is comparable to that of PC61BM. Both Br-PDI and PC61BM PVSCs show more reasonable Rs, FF, short circuit current (Jsc), and hence PCE, than those of H-PDI and F-PDI PVSCs.
Attempting to improve the low PCE of X-PDI or PC61BM PVSCs, we introduce solution processed ZnO NP as the CBL to overcome or alleviate the problems associated with the ETL. In addition to the data summarized in Table 4, the J–V plots of PVSCs with ZnO NP CBL are illustrated in Fig. 10a (solar AM 1.5G irradiation with 100 mW cm−2) and 10b (dark).
 Fig. 10  
J–V characteristics of X-DPI and PC61BM PVSCs with CBL of ZnO NP under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (a) and dark (b). 
As shown by the results, whereas the performance of F-PDI devices remains very poor, PCE of Br-PDI, H-PDI, and PC61BM PVSCs with CBL of ZnO NP have notably improved to 10.50%, 7.78%, and 11.07%, respectively. The improvement is comprehensive in all aspects, including Voc, Jsc, FF, shunt resistance (Rsh), and Rs (Table 4). We can logically infer that the CBL of ZnO NP has an effective function of interspace-filling upon the aggregate domains of Br-PDI, H-PDI, and PC61BM thin films. This reduces the direct contact of Ag cathode metal with perovskite material and increases the effective contact area for electron transfer from MAPbI3 perovskite, and the electron mobility (also direct current conductivity) of ETL is also elevated. However, there was still the question of why F-PDI PVSCs did not benefit from the CBL of ZnO NP.
Inspired by the AFM image of the thin film, we have a proposal to explain why the CBL of ZnO NP works effectively for Br-PDI, H-PDI, and PC61BM, but does not work for F-PDI devices. As shown schematically in Fig. 11a and c, an interspace-filling of ETL by ZnO NPs prevents the diffusion of cathode metal (Ag) through the defects of the ETL, which will form a direct contact for MAPbI3, facilitating the undesired charge recombination process. Such interspace-filling by ZnO NPs is not effective for F-PDI. Due to the large and many interspaces between the aggregate domains of F-PDI, the solvent (ethanol) used for ZnO NPs goes through the ETL readily and washes away part of the perovskite material underneath the interspace of aggregate domains, enabling the direct contact of deposited cathode metal (Ag) (Fig. 11b), which is seriously detrimental to the performance of PVSCs.
 Fig. 11  Schematic depiction of the cross-sectional view of H-PDI (a), F-PDI (b), and Br-PDI or PC61BM (c) ETLs (yellow), as well as their interspace-filling by ZnO NPs (dark cyan), which prevent the contact of the cathode metal Ag (light gray) with MAPbI3 perovskite (red). 
The inhibited charge recombination process of Br-PDI and PC61BM PVSCs with CBL of ZnO NP gets evidence from a significantly weaker dark current density, compared to that of H-PDI and F-PDI PVSCs with CBL of ZnO NP (Fig. 10b). Moreover, the dark J–V curves shown in Fig. 10b can be modelled using the Shockley diode equation for a single junction device.39,40 The detailed modelling method can be found in the experimental section. Two key modelling parameters, the reverse saturation current density (J0) and the ideality factor (nid,dark), of all four devices (with CBL of ZnO NP) are summarized in Table 4. Much smaller values of J0 and nid,dark were obtained for the Br-PDI and PC61BM PVSCs, compared to that of F-PDI devices, whereas J0 and nid,dark of H-PDI devices are between those of Br-PDI and F-PDI. Such modelling results signify that Br-PDI and PC61BM are better materials than H-PDI, and much better than F-PDI for electron selection at the interface of MAPbI3/ETL, because of less charge recombination loss. Higher values of Voc were observed for Br-PDI and PC61BM than H-PDI and F-PDI PVSCs, which can also be explained by less interfacial trap-assisted charge recombination,41 consistent with the modelling results obtained herein.
It is interesting to know that Br-PDI PVSCs always have a higher Jsc output than PC61BM PVSCs, whether or not the devices have ZnO NP (Table 4). Considering the DC conductivity, electron mobility, photoluminescence of perovskite/ETL interface, and AFM thin film surface roughness of both materials, we can infer that the better energy alignment, i.e., lower LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Br-PDI than PC61BM (see data listed in Table 2) are a main factor. The better energy alignment enables Br-PDI to be a more effective material in electron extraction and more efficient at hole-blocking from perovskite materials. However, a larger energy difference between HOMO (of MAPbI3) and LUMO (of ETL) energy levels renders a higher Voc of PC61BM PVSCs, which offsets the Jsc deficiency of the devices. Depending on FF, the PCE of Br-PDI and PC61BM PVSCs having ZnO NP CBL are comparable.
Comparing the hysteresis of PVSCs with ZnO NP (Fig. 12), ∼3% and ∼0.5% are the degrees of the hysteresis effect for Br-PDI and PC61BM devices, respectively, based on the calculation of 2 × (FFforward − FFreverse)/(FFforward + FFreverse) with corresponding data, listed in Table 4. We are pleased to know that the hysteresis effect of Br-PDI PVSCs is just a little bit more than that of PC61BM PVSCs.

Conclusions
We have developed and demonstrated three solution processable perylene diimides, i.e., X-PDI, X = H, F, or Br, as non-fullerene electron accepting and electron transporting materials in inverted PVSCs. Whereas H-PDI or F-PDI performs unsatisfactorily, our best PVSC is based on Br-PDI exhibiting PCE of 3.23%, which is just a bit shy of 4.13% of fullerene (PC61BM) PVSCs. Through a series of physical, spectroscopic, and microscopic studies, we have understood that the low solubility of F-PDI is a major factor causing the poor quality of the thin film, rendering virtually no photovoltaic effect for F-PDI. Although the solubility is better than F-PDI, the inferior electron mobility and conductivity, compared with those of Br-PDI make H-PDI PVSCs have relatively worse performance. Having the highest solubility, electron mobility, and conductivity among X-PDI, Br-PDI-based PVSCs are almost as efficient as PC61BM-based PVSCs. Except for F-PDI, the PCEs of PVSCs based on X-PDI or PC61BM are significantly improved to 7.78%, 10.50%, and 11.07%, respectively, once solution processed ZnO NP are included in the PVSCs as a CBL. We infer that the CBL of ZnO NP has the function of interspace-filling on the defect of H-PDI, Br-PDI, or PC61BM thin film, reducing the direct contact of Ag cathode to the perovskite material. Due to the strong molecular interaction, F-PDI aggregates significantly in thin film, creating too many and too large defects to be remedied or improved with or without CBL of ZnO NP. Very poor electron mobility and conductivity of F-PDI are two other factors devastating its PVSCs.

Synthesis of ZnO NPs. 
ZnO NPs were synthesized by a solution-precipitation process according to literature procedures.43 Briefly, zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g) was dissolved in methanol (125 mL) at room temperature. A potassium hydroxide solution (1.48 g in 65 mL methanol) was then added dropwise within 30 min and stirred for 3 h at 65 °C. After cooling, the solution was then decanted and the precipitate was washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol, respectively. Afterward, ethanol was added to disperse the precipitates and produce ZnO NPs solution with a concentration of 6 mg mL−1. Before use, the ZnO NPs solution was filtered through a 0.45 mm PVDF syringe filter.

Cyclic voltammetry of X-DPI
Using an Electrochemical Analyser BAS C3 operated at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were conducted in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) supported CH2Cl2 solution containing X-PDI or PC61BM (1.0 × 10−3 M) at room temperature. The measurement was conducted with a glassy carbon rod as the working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The Ag–Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) was used as the reference electrode. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the reference to calibrate the redox potentials. Fc/Fc+ potential in our CV measurement was +0.10 V relative to Ag–Ag+. For a thin film CV measurement, X-PDI or PC61BM thin film-coated platinum electrode was prepared from a drop-cast chloroform solution. The CV of the X-PDI or PC61BM thin film was studied in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated solution of acetonitrile containing 0.10 M Bu4NPF6. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of X-PDI or PC61BM were calculated based on equations, ELUMO = −(Ered11/2 + 5.10) [eV] and EHOMO = ELUMO − Eopg[eV], where Eopg is the optical energy gap corresponding to the absorption onset wavelength of the absorption spectra; the energy level of Fc/Fc+ related to the vacuum level was 5.10 eV, based on literature reports.9,31
Determination of direct current conductivity of X-PDI and PC61BM
The X-PDI or PC61BM thin films were prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solution on an ITO bottom electrode. A layer of Al (100 nm) as the top electrode was then deposited through an area (0.2 × 0.5 cm2) patterned mask in a thermal evaporation chamber under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr). The electrical conductivity was analysed based on the current–voltage characteristics of the thin film. The DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0), which is in units of siemens per meter (S m−1), of the thin film material in such a device can be obtained by the Claude Pouillet law, R = L(σ0A)−1, where the resistance (R) of a given thin film increases with length (L), but decreases with increasing cross-sectional area (A). The σ0 is defined as the inverse of resistivity (ρ, in unit of Ω m), i.e., σ0 = ρ−1.
Electron mobility determination by SCLC
In the case of a field dependent mobility, as described by the Poole–Frenkel effect, the space-charge limited (SCL) current density (JSCL) is given by the modified Mott–Gurney equation,44JSCL = 9ε0εrμVin2exp(γV1/2L−1/2)(8L3)−1, where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1); εr is the relative dielectric constant of the thin film, which was assigned as 3; μ is the charge carrier mobility; L is the thickness of the device; Vin is the voltage drop across the sample given by Vin = V − Vbi − Vrs, where V is the applied voltage, Vbi the built-in voltage, and Vrs is the voltage drop due to the series resistance of the contacts; γ is the electric field-activation factor of mobility and accounts for the degree of disorder, particularly the energetic level distribution of the carrier hopping sites in the material. Accordingly, in the region of a logJ − logV curve having a slope of ∼2, the μ can be calculated from the intercept of a ln(JL2V−2) − (VL−1)1/2 plot (see Fig. 5b and d), i.e., μ = exp(intercept)8L(9ε0εr)−1. The expression of a field dependent SCL current (SCLC) yields a reasonably good fit to the measured J–V curves of single-carrier devices (see the fitting curves in Fig. 5a and c).45
Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultra-sonication for 20 min each, and subsequently pre-treated with UV-ozone for 60 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer (25 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface and then annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer (∼380 nm) was prepared following two-step solution deposition, as described in our previous work.35,36 Briefly, PbI2 and MAI were dissolved in DMF and 2-propanol with concentrations of 450 mg mL−1 for PbI2 and 40 mg mL−1 for MAI, respectively. Both solutions and PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min before being used. The PbI2 solution was spun on a preheated substrate (5000 rpm for 40 s) and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The MAI solution was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 film (6000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 2 h. The X-PDI solution (15 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was then cast by spin-coating (1000 rpm for 60 s) on top of the preformed perovskite layers. The thickness of X-PDI was near 200 nm. Afterward, the ZnO NPs layer (about 10–20 nm) was deposited by spin-coating ZnO NP precursor solution (3000 rpm for 60 s), then dried in ambient conditions without thermal annealing. The opaque Ag cathode (150 nm) was then deposited from a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Contributions to the Jsc from regions outside the active area were eliminated using illumination masks with an aperture size of 0.12 cm2. The bulk resistances, Rsh and Rs, of the samples, were calculated from Ohm's law, R = VI−1, with at least ten separate measurements made for each sample.
For the evaluation of the device performance, the devices were illuminated under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 by using a 150 W Class AAA solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI). The light intensity was determined by using a standard silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1133), calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1.
From the J–V characteristics of solar cells in dark circumstances, the dark current densities (JD) of a solar cell can be estimated according to the thermionic emission model,39,40JD = J0[exp(qV(nkT)−1)−1], where n is the dark ideality factor, J0 is the reverse saturation current, q is the elementary charge, and kT is the thermal energy (Boltzmann's constant and temperature). It is well known that the ideality factor of PVSC is normally between 1 and 2.41 The ideality factor is close to 1 for an ideal trap-free device, while it is closer to or larger than 2 in the case of the deep and dominant charge recombination induced by the trap.
