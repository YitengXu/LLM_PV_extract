    , Accepted 27th June 2013First published on 28th June 2013AbstractThe final device efficiencies of excitonic solar cells are strongly dependent on interface processes. However, it is still very challenging to clearly track the effects of inter-molecular processes at the mesoscopic level, while controlling the morphology and interface structure on the nanometer length scale. We report on the realization of a step-change improvement in poly(3-hexylthiophene)/ZnO-based hybrid solar cells, which is enabled by engineering the hybrid interface using a rod–coil diblock copolymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P3HT-b-P4VP), as a nanostructuring compatibilizer in the P3HT/ZnO bulk heterojunctions. Upon evaporation of the solvent, the P3HT blocks of the copolymer cocrystallize with the homopolymer P3HT chains and phase separate from the ZnO domains, resulting in the P4VP blocks sitting at the edge of crystalline P3HT microdomains, or in other words, at the interfacial region between the P3HT and ZnO domains. P3HT-b-P4VP could enhance the crystallinity of P3HT and help spontaneously assemble P3HT into nanowires, while at the same time impeding the macrophase separation of the ZnO nanoparticles by taking advantage of the coordination interaction between the P4VP block and the ZnO nanoparticles, bridging the ZnO nanoparticles and the P3HT nanowires, thereby effectively improving the power-conversion efficiency. We show that a suitable nanostructuring compatibilizer induces selective intermolecular interactions, thus creating a preferential interface energetic landscape and morphological order, which consequently drive a strong improvement in the exciton dissociation and charge transport by decreasing recombination losses.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have drawn worldwide attention due to their great promise as solution-processable, flexible, lightweight and low-cost renewable energy sources, in addition to their ease of manufacture and large surface area, which make them suitable for commercial applications.1–5 Much work has been carried out toward improving the performance of these devices, such as designing new materials,6–10 device structures11–16 and processing techniques.17,18 So far, most organic solar cells have been based on conjugated polymers, as electron-donor materials, blended with fullerene derivatives, as electron-acceptor materials. Significant attention has been given toward the use of inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) due to their high electron mobility and good mechanical robustness, compared to fullerene derivatives, as well as the attractive possibility of harvesting photons in the visible to near-infrared region of the solar spectrum.19–21 More recently, many kinds of inorganic semiconductor NPs have been adopted for the fabrication of hybrid solar cells.22 Despite continuous improvements in their efficiency, hybrid solar cells still suffer from two major drawbacks: poor control over the organic donor and inorganic acceptor domain size distributions, and the inherent instability of their morphology.
To improve the hybrid solar cell device power conversion efficiency (PCE), several design criteria have to be taken into consideration: the domain size of the organic donor and inorganic acceptor materials should be comparable to or smaller than the exciton diffusion length in order to increase the probability of exciton dissociation across the heterojunction, along with achieving high-yield and long-lived charge separation at the nanoparticle/polymer interface while ensuring a good electrical connection between the NPs in order to facilitate charge carrier transport and collection at the device electrodes.19 However, inorganic NPs tend to macrophase separate from non-polar conjugated polymers at higher loading concentrations, leading to a decrease of the interfacial area. Therefore, achieving a controllable bicontinuous percolation network and controlling the phase separation on the nanoscale remains challenging.
Various studies have been performed to control the organic donor and inorganic acceptor domain sizes and the morphology in order to improve the PCE.23–25 Kochemba et al. used pyridyl-functionalized P3HTs to ligate semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs) for the purpose of tuning the morphology of the conjugated polymer/SQD blends.26 Recently, block copolymers based on P3HT as a block component have found applications as nanostructuring compatibilizers in OPVs, resulting in improved morphologies and significant enhancements of the solar cell efficiencies.27–29 It is well known that a proper compatibilizer can reduce interfacial tension and suppress coalescence, thereby limiting organic donor and inorganic acceptor domain sizes and improving the morphological stability. There remains a need to develop a fundamental understanding of the effect that block copolymer compatibilizers have on the ability to control molecular ordering, the morphology, phase-separation and the improvement of hybrid solar cell performance.
In this study, we propose utilizing a rod–coil diblock copolymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P3HT-b-P4VP), as a nanostructuring compatibilizer in P3HT/ZnO bulk heterojunctions, in order to control the structural organization of the P3HT/ZnO blend. The effects of different amounts of the P3HT-b-P4VP block copolymer on the crystallinity and stacking orientation of P3HT, the morphology of the P3HT/ZnO blend, and the P3HT/ZnO/P3HT-b-P4VP interaction from an all-electron density function theory (DFT) simulation, have been studied and correlated to the solar cell performance. P3HT-b-P4VP could enhance the crystallinity of P3HT and help spontaneously assemble P3HT into nanowires, while at the same time impeding the macrophase separation of the ZnO NPs by taking advantage of the coordination interaction between the P4VP block and the ZnO NPs, which bridges the ZnO NPs and P3HT nanowires, thereby effectively improving the power-conversion efficiency.
Experimental section
Characterization
The structures of the synthesized products were determined with 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a 600 MHz Varian spectrometer, with deuterated chloroform as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Meanwhile, in order to investigate the nanostructure of the active layers transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F, field emission transmission electron microscope) was employed. The optical properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750) and a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-7000) with an excitation source wavelength of 460 nm. The fluorescence lifetime was determined with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a H2 gas lamp as the light source. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). All of the measurements were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the samples were carried out using a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer operating at 30 kV and 20 mA with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å) and at a scanning rate of 1° min−1. The out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) profiles were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The measurements were obtained at a scanning interval of 2θ between 2° and 30°. All the samples were spin-coated onto the silicon substrate. In order to increase the effective X-ray penetrating depth and minimize background noise from the substrate scattering, the angle between the incident beam and the film surface was fixed at 0.2°.
Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (5–8 Ω per square) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic agitation in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The cleaned substrates were then treated with plasma for 20 minutes. A blend solution was prepared by dissolving P3HT/ZnO (1:2 w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1, and the P3HT-b-P4VP copolymer was added to the P3HT/ZnO blend at different ratios of 3, 5, 10, 20 wt%. The molecular weight of the P3HT, purchased from Rieke Metals, was Mw = 40000 and this was used as received. ZnO NPs were prepared according to published procedures,30,31 and the size of the ZnO NPs varied between 5 nm to 8 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the ZnO NPs is shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†). Filtered poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP A1 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 60 s and the dried at 140 °C for 10 minutes in air. The mixed P3HT/ZnO/P3HT-b-P4VP solution was spin coated onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at a spin speed of 800 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of the top metal cathode (1 nm LiF and 80 nm Al) through a shadow mask. The final device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al, and the device area was 4 mm2.
Calculation method
Our calculations were based on the first-principle pseudo-potentials within DFT as implemented in SIESTA,32,33 which employs a localized orbital basis set for the representation of wave functions. We used the GGA method, a linear combination of the numerical atomic orbitals with double-ζ polarizations (DZP) used in the basis set to describe the valence electrons.34 Real space integration was performed on a regular grid corresponding to a plane-wave cutoff around 200 Ry, at which the structural relaxations and the electronic energies were fully converged.
Results and discussion
The synthesis procedure of the rod–coil P3HT-b-P4VP copolymer is presented in Scheme S1† and is in accordance with the previously described strategy.35,36 The obtained block copolymer was characterized by 1H NMR (Fig. S2†), showing that it contained about 60 mol% P4VP. The molecular weight of P3HT-b-P4VP was Mw = 17000 (P3HT block Mw = 13000, and P4VP block Mw = 4000) with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.32, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in tetrahydrofuran (Fig. S3†). The 1H NMR and overlap in the GPC traces indicated that the P3HT-b-P4VP block copolymer may contain some P3HT homopolymer. It is well known that the metathesis polymerization of the regiospecific 3-hexylthiophene monomer is not living, and thus 100% conversion to the block copolymer is not guaranteed. The effect of incorporating P3HT-b-P4VP as a nanostructuring compatibilizer in the 1:2 w/w P3HT/ZnO blends on the performance of the fabricated solar cells was studied. Fig. 1a and b and Table S1† show a summary of the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the P3HT/ZnO hybrid solar cells containing different weight fractions of P3HT-b-P4VP (from 0% up to 20% with respect to the total weight of the blend). A PCE of 0.67% was obtained without adding any P3HT-b-P4VP. With the addition of 5 wt% P3HT-b-P4VP, the best performance was achieved, i.e., 1.05%. Further increasing the content of P3HT-b-P4VP, however, resulted in a decrease of the efficiency, mainly due to the insulating P4VP block. It is worth noting that the incorporation of a small amount of P3HT-b-P4VP strongly improves the short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which is closely related to an increase in the shunt resistance (Rsh) and a decrease in the series resistance (Rs) (Fig. 1c). A high Rsh value is related to the minimization of leakage currents and to a low yield of charge carrier recombination, while a low Rs value is associated with a decrease of the intrinsic resistance, including the resistance at the contacts. The increased shunt resistance indicates that the P3HT-b-P4VP block copolymer might depress the local shunts and efficiently block the injection of holes into the leakage pathway, and that recombination of the charge carriers is suppressed (Fig. 1d). This outcome is further supported by a decrease in the reverse saturation current density observed in the dark J–V curves, upon addition of P3HT-b-P4VP (Fig. S4†). A decrease in leakage current indicates a reduction in charge loss by trapping and/or by charge recombination in the P3HT-b-P4VP-containing devices. The stability of the improvement in efficiency was also investigated. The evolution of the performance of the devices based on P3HT/ZnO and P3HT/ZnO with the addition of 5 wt% P3HT-b-P4VP during thermal annealing at 120 °C is shown in Fig. S5.† It was clearly shown that with the addition of 5 wt% P3HT-b-P4VP, the stability of the device improved. An increase in PCE was observed for the devices based on P3HT/ZnO with the addition of 5 wt% P3HT-b-P4VP after 30 min annealing. This increase may be related to a change in the morphological arrangement of the polymer chains adjacent to the ZnO NPs after annealing.

The physical conformation of the polymer chains can be inferred from the optical absorbance of the films. Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra showed obviously increased shoulders at 2.214 eV (560 nm) and 2.034 eV (610 nm) upon addition of P3HT-b-P4VP, indicating the formation of crystallites and more ordered structures (Fig. S6†). To further confirm the improved crystallization of the P3HT chains, the dichroism in the UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the P3HT/ZnO composite films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions were measured using light that was polarized so as to be parallel and perpendicular to the P3HT chains, (Fig. 2, S7 and S8† and Table 1). It is clear that when the P3HT-b-P4VP weight fraction is 5%, the P3HT/ZnO composite films exhibit the highest anisotropy in their optical absorption, with a characteristic dichroic ratio of 1.89 at 525 nm and two rather broad vibronic replicas centered at A0–0 = 610 nm and A0–1 = 560 nm. The intensity of the interchain absorption due to this fine structure is a measure of the degree of molecular order in a polymer film.37 The origin of the vibronic replicas in the absorption spectrum of P3HT was analyzed with the aim of understanding the correlation between the optical and structural properties of the thin films.37–40 It has been proven that the exciton bandwidth can be estimated using a weakly interacting H-aggregate model, which provides a description of the degree of crystallization and the quality of crystallites within the film. According to the H-aggregate model of Spano et al., the free exciton bandwidth within the crystalline phase (W) can be calculated from the intensity ratio (A) of the A0–0 to A0–1 absorbance bands according to:41,42  where Ep is the energy of the main intramolecular transition (assumed to be 0.18 eV, corresponding to a symmetric CC stretch). According to Clark et al.,38 a decrease in W (manifested in the spectrum as an increase in A), assuming similar interchain order, would be consistent with an increase in the effective conjugation length (more linearized and better ordered polymer chains). This indicates that adding the P3HT-b-P4VP diblock copolymer into a P3HT/ZnO blend is an effective strategy for inducing well organized crystalline P3HT domains in the blend, which is likely due to the P3HT-b-P4VP diblock copolymer self-assembly inducing an improved crystallization of the P3HT chains. Accordingly, the polarized fluorescence spectra shows the same tendency. These phenomenon further indicate that the self-assembly of P3HT-b-P4VP promotes a uniaxial alignment of the P3HT chains that is preferentially parallel to the long axis direction.

To investigate how the orientations of the polymer chains were influenced by the P3HT-b-P4VP compatibilizer and to further examine the nanoscale morphologies of the polymer chains in the P3HT/ZnO hybrids, we employed out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) (Fig. 3). The lamellar-stacking structure (Fig. 3c) of P3HT, corresponding to the alkyl side chains of P3HT oriented vertically to the substrate forming an edge-on orientation and the intermolecular π–π stacking between the thiophene rings parallel to the substrate, usually provides the (h00) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (qz) direction. The increased (100) peak intensity in the out-of-plane (qz) direction for the P3HT/P3HT-b-P4VP/ZnO films indicated that the lamellar stacking of the P3HT crystallites within the P3HT/P3HT-b-P4VP/ZnO hybrid was increased after adding P3HT-b-P4VP (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b summarizes the changes in the relative reflection peak intensities and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the (100) reflection of the P3HT crystallites. The self-assembly behavior of the P3HT-b-P4VP clearly improves the crystallinity of the P3HT thin films because the intensity and FWHM of the P3HT (100) diffraction peak become stronger and smaller, respectively. The smallest FWHM value, for the 5 wt% P3HT-b-P4VP blend, results in the film with the highest crystallinity.

(b) Variation of the XRD peak intensity and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) at (100), corresponding to the a-axis orientation of the P3HT crystallite, in the P3HT/ZnO blend films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. The relative peak intensities at (100) were calculated by setting the highest recorded intensity (the intensity at (100) in the sample with 5% P3HT-b-P4VP) as the maximum of 100. (c) Illustration showing the lamellar stacking of the P3HT crystallites with respect to the substrate surface. 
The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra of the P3HT/ZnO blend films, used to investigate the dissociation of photoinduced excitons at the P3HT–ZnO (donor–acceptor) interface,43,44 are shown in Fig. S9† and 4, respectively. Compared to the spectrum of P3HT, the P3HT/ZnO films blended with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions show a dramatic reduction in spectral intensity, especially for the film where the P3HT-b-P4VP weight fraction is 5%. Meanwhile, the PL lifetime of the P3HT/ZnO film with 5% P3HT-b-P4VP was the shortest amongst all of the samples. The fitted lifetime τ = 810 ps, 760 ps, 680 ps, 870 ps and 980 ps for the P3HT/ZnO films with 0%, 3%, 5%, 10% and 20% P3HT-b-P4VP, respectively. The faster and stronger PL decay of the P3HT/ZnO/P3HT-b-P4VP films can be attributed to the optimized morphology (vide infra) of the blends and the improved interfacial contact between P3HT and ZnO, where it is easier for the exciton to find the interface and dissociate.45,46 This is consistent with the static PL measurements. It is important to note that for any further increase in the concentration of P3HT-b-P4VP beyond 5%, the decay lifetimes for the P3HT/ZnO/P3HT-b-P4VP films were longer than that of pristine P3HT/ZnO, which was likely due to the insulating P4VP component hindering the charge transfer between the P3HT and ZnO.

In order to gain insight into the morphology of the P3HT/ZnO blend films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on films prepared following the same methodology used for the active layers of the devices (Fig. 5). Induced by the self-assembly of the nanostructuring P3HT-b-P4VP diblock copolymer, P3HT is assembled into highly ordered nanowires. Taking advantage of the coordination interactions between the P4VP block component and the ZnO NPs, the ZnO NPs were bridged onto the P3HT nanowires, especially in the films containing 3% and 5% P3HT-b-P4VP (shown in Fig. 5b and c). So far, the improved device performances and the reduced charge losses, which were observed upon the incorporation of P3HT-b-P4VP, could be attributed to the structural changes in the active layers. Owing to the chemical affinities of the two blocks with the components of the blend, it is expected that the P3HT-b-P4VP copolymer should reside at the P3HT/ZnO interface, with the P3HT block lying in the P3HT domain and the P4VP block lying in the ZnO domain. Further increases in the concentration of the P3HT-b-P4VP copolymer to 10 wt% and 20 wt%, resulted in the formation of large aggregates, which was likely due to the self-assembly of the P3HT-b-P4VP diblock copolymer. The strong interaction between the P4VP block and the ZnO NPs could make the ZnO NPs accumulate, causing a large aggregation of ZnO NPs (shown in Fig. 5d and e). Side views of the P3HT/ZnO interface and the modification of the interface due to the presence of P3HT-b-P4VP, obtained using DFT simulations at room temperature, are shown in Fig. 5f and g, respectively.

Side views of (f) P3HT/ZnO interface and (g) the modification of the interface due to the presence of P3HT-b-P4VP obtained using DFT simulations at room temperature. The inset images in (a) and (b) show schematic representations of the interface between ZnO (white spheres) and P3HT (blue lines), (a) without P3HT-b-P4VP, (b) with P3HT-b-P4VP, which enhances the crystallinity of P3HT and helps spontaneously assemble P3HT into nanowires, bridging the ZnO NPs with P3HT nanowires. 
In order to study the ZnO/polymer hybrid interface in detail, we investigated the electronic energy-level alignment at the ZnO/P3HT or P4VP interface from first principles by means of standard DFT. For ZnO/P3HT, upon structural relaxation, the vertical distance between the P3HT chain and ZnO surface is 3.9 Å, for the bare interface. In addition, the interaction energy between the P3HT chain and ZnO is only 4.43 kcal mol−1. For ZnO/P4VP, the ZnO/O-P4VP (overlap types) and ZnO/C-P4VP (cross types) interfaces have been calculated as well. As shown in Fig. 6, for both ZnO/O-P4VP and ZnO/C-P4VP, the lone electron pair of a N atom is easily coordinated with a Zn atom on the ZnO surface to a form Zn–N coordination bond that has a bond length of about 1.97 Å. The interaction energies of P4VP and ZnO are 9.56 and 13.74 kcal mol−1 for ZnO/O-P4VP and ZnO/C-P4VP, respectively. Based on the above, it is easy to see that the interaction between the ZnO and P4VP is stronger than that between ZnO and P3HT. The short bond length and strong interaction means that the main characteristic of the interaction between the P4VP molecule and ZnO surface is chemisorption. However, the main characteristic of the interaction between the P3HT molecules and ZnO is physisorption. Moreover, ZnO/C-P4VP is the most stable of the three structures. Indeed, a semi-empirical model based on the PM6 optimized structure shows that the strong interaction between ZnO and P4VP induces well organized crystalline P3HT domains when adding P3HT-b-P4VP, which is consistent with the GIXD results.

We carried out electronic structure calculations using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional to determine the energy levels and the total density of states is shown in Fig. 6. The band gaps between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for ZnO and Zn/C-P4VP and ZnO/P3HT are 3.24, 2.96 and 2.51 eV, respectively. Comparing the two heterojunctions, it is easy to see that the HOMO–LUMO gap of Zn/C-P4VP is larger than that of ZnO/P3HT. In addition, a similar trend is also observed in the Fermi energy of the calculated systems. The Fermi energies are −4.57, −4.43 and −4.29 eV for ZnO and ZnO/C-P4VP and ZnO/P3HT, respectively. The electronic charge rearrangement upon formation of the interface and the resulting electrostatic potential offset were calculated using DFT. Fig. 7a and b show that there is significant charge transfer from P3HT to ZnO and from P3HT-b-P4VP to the ZnO underneath. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the presence of P4VP segments does not obviously affect the charge transfer between ZnO and P3HT. These calculated results indicate that a small number of insulating P4VP segments will not hinder the charge transfer between ZnO and P3HT, and also that P3HT-b-P4VP can induce the formation of well organized crystalline P3HT and that P4VP just acts as a compatibilizer between the P3HT and ZnO phases.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a systematic investigation of the photovoltaic performance when a well-designed P3HT-b-P4VP block copolymer is added as a nanostructuring compatibilizer to P3HT/ZnO-based solar cell devices. By taking advantage of the self-assembly behavior of P3HT-b-P4VP and the coordination interactions between the P4VP block and the ZnO NPs, we are able to control the blend film morphology, enhance the crystallinity of P3HT and help spontaneously assemble P3HT into nanowires, bridging the ZnO NPs with P3HT nanowires. This can be translated into better charge generation and separation at the interface as a result of the enhancement of the surface contact between P3HT and ZnO. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction between the P4VP segments and ZnO is a major driving force for controlling the phase separation in the P3HT/ZnO blends, with the P4VP blocks attaching onto the ZnO surface, while the P3HT blocks enter the P3HT crystal region. This leads to an improvement in the long-range crystallinity, extending the level of order achieved at the interface to a longer range, which definitely further boosts the performance of the devices.

 	Fig. 1  Summary of the photovoltaic performance: (a) Jsc and PCE, (b) Voc and FF, (c) Rs and Rsh of the P3HT/ZnO hybrid solar cells with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. The error bars were calculated by averaging the results obtained from 8 devices. (d) Schematic drawing of the possible internal charge separation across the P4VP interfacial layer.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 2  Polarized absorbance spectra of the P3HT/ZnO blend films with 0% and 5% P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. A∥ and A⊥ are the absorbances measured using light that was polarized parallel and perpendicular to the P3HT molecule, respectively. The insets show the polarized absorption for the films at 560 nm.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Out-of-plane GIXD profiles and XRD patterns (shown in the inset of (a)) of the P3HT/ZnO films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. (b) Variation of the XRD peak intensity and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) at (100), corresponding to the a-axis orientation of the P3HT crystallite, in the P3HT/ZnO blend films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. The relative peak intensities at (100) were calculated by setting the highest recorded intensity (the intensity at (100) in the sample with 5% P3HT-b-P4VP) as the maximum of 100. (c) Illustration showing the lamellar stacking of the P3HT crystallites with respect to the substrate surface.	 

 	Fig. 4  Time-resolved photoluminescence decay spectra of the P3HT/ZnO blends with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. The fitted lifetime τ = 810 ps, 760 ps, 680 ps, 870 ps, 980 ps for the P3HT/ZnO blends with 0%, 3%, 5%, 10% and 20% P3HT-b-P4VP, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a–e) TEM images of the P3HT/ZnO blend films with different P3HT-b-P4VP weight fractions. Side views of (f) P3HT/ZnO interface and (g) the modification of the interface due to the presence of P3HT-b-P4VP obtained using DFT simulations at room temperature. The inset images in (a) and (b) show schematic representations of the interface between ZnO (white spheres) and P3HT (blue lines), (a) without P3HT-b-P4VP, (b) with P3HT-b-P4VP, which enhances the crystallinity of P3HT and helps spontaneously assemble P3HT into nanowires, bridging the ZnO NPs with P3HT nanowires.	 

 	Fig. 6  The total density of states (DOS) of ZnO, ZnO/P3HT, ZnO/O-P4VP and ZnO/C-P4VP. Insets: the molecular structure of the ZnO/P3HT, ZnO/O-P4VP and ZnO/C-P4VP heterojunctions (from a semi-empirical model based on the PM6 optimized structure).	 

 	Fig. 7  Charge transfer in (a) ZnO/P3HT and (b) ZnO/P3HT-b-P4VP, showing the electron transfer from P3HT and P3HT-b-P4VP to ZnO.
