    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 27th October 2022AbstractThe poor stability of lead (Pb)-free tin (Sn)-based perovskites under only oxygen (O2) exposure has attracted extensive research, while their stability under simultaneous light and O2 (light/O2) exposure is unexplored. Herein, we found that the (NH2)2CHSnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite degrades more severely when exposed to light/O2 than only O2, which we attribute to the superoxide generated via the reaction between O2 and photoexcited electrons. We propose the superoxide-induced degradation routes of FASnI3. Fluorescent molecular probe results indicate higher yield of superoxide in FASnI3 than in FAPbI3. Density functional theory simulation results rationalize that the formation energy of the most preferred sites (iodine vacancy, VI) for superoxide formation in FASnI3 is much lower than that in FAPbI3; meanwhile, superoxide formation at VI is more energetically favorable in FASnI3. A targeted strategy by incorporating halide-containing additives is applied to fill the VI in FASnI3 to suppress superoxide formation. Combined with superoxide yield measurement, capacitance-dominated characterization can systematically differentiate the reduction of surface and interior VI after modification. Understanding the degradation mechanism of FASnI3 upon light/O2 exposure manifests the fatal effect of superoxide on the stability of Sn-based perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
The most notorious issue of tin (Sn)-based perovskites is their high vulnerability to O2, which distracts the attention of researchers from their light/O2 stability. Learning from the process of superoxide generation in lead (Pb)-based perovskites and the organic compositions of most Sn-based perovskites, superoxide-induced degradation is very likely to occur under exposure to light/O2. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that (NH2)2CHSnI3 (FASnI3) suffers more severe degradation under light/O2 than only O2, which is caused by the superoxide generated from O2 accepting photoexcited electrons. The superoxide-induced degradation routes of FASnI3 were proposed and proved accordingly. Theoretical calculation revealed that in comparison with FAPbI3, the most preferred sites (iodine vacancy, VI) for superoxide formation are more prone to form in FASnI3, and superoxide generation is more energetically favorable at the VI in FASnI3. These shortcomings lead to higher superoxide yield in FASnI3 than FAPbI3, indicating the more negative effects of superoxide on light/O2 stability for Sn-based perovskites and solar cells. Combined with superoxide yield measurement, capacitance-dominated characterization can systematically differentiate the reduction of surface and interior VI upon the incorporation of theophylline-Br in the FASnI3 precursor, which leads to significantly enhanced light/O2 stability and device efficiency.

Introduction
Lead (Pb) halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly grown in the past decades as their certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has soared over 25%.1–5 Many attempts toward upscaling their commercialization have been made.6–8 However, two essential and practical concerns are their long-term stability and toxicity.9–11
Compared to the stability of Pb-based perovskites under conditions of humidity, heat, and light,9,12–16 their stability under simultaneous light and oxygen (O2) exposure (henceforth, light/O2) has been paid less attention.17–20 In fact, neutral O2 molecules have limited impact on Pb-based perovskite stability without illumination, as it interacts weakly with perovskites.18 Nevertheless, O2 molecules can diffuse into the perovskite lattice and then accept photoexcited electrons from the perovskite under light to form superoxide.21 The reactive superoxide (O2−) species can deprotonate organic cations of the photoexcited perovskite by breaking the inorganic Pb–I bonds, leading to the degradation of MAPbI3 into PbI2, H2O, CH3NH2, and I2, thereby causing poor device stability.17,21 Superoxide-induced degradation also occurs in mixed-cation perovskites20 and is faster than the widely studied moisture-induced degradation.22 PSCs must operate under illumination with very slight O2 concentration; therefore, suppressing the formation of superoxide is crucial to improving the light/O2 stability of Pb-based perovskites.
Sn-based perovskites have exhibited great potential owing to their alleviated biotoxicity and similar optoelectronic properties as Pb-based perovskites, as well as narrower bandgaps and higher carrier mobility.23–27 Although efficiencies of over 14% have recently been achieved,27–29 the most notorious issue of Sn-based perovskites lies in its higher vulnerability to O2, leading to easy oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor device performance.30 This conspicuous shortcoming distracts the attention of researchers from the light/O2 stability of Sn-based perovskites. Learning from the process of superoxide formation and the compositions in the most commonly used Sn-based perovskites (e.g., organic cation formamidine (FA+) in FASnI3), superoxide-induced degradation is very likely to happen under exposure to light/O2.
Encapsulation is universally applied to largely prevent O2 from diffusing into the Sn-based devices; however, a tiny amount of O2 may still remain either in the gap between the glass substrate and the cover glass, or via slow leakage from the encapsulant during operation. So far, investigation on how the superoxide potentially affects the light/O2 stability of Sn-based perovskites is lacking, and the underlying mechanism is unclear. In parallel, the corresponding remedial strategies of enhancing the light/O2 stability of Sn-based PSCs should be developed.
Herein, we found that the FASnI3 perovskite suffers from a more severe degradation under light/O2 than only O2, which is triggered by the superoxide generated from O2 molecules that accept photoexcited electrons. A higher superoxide yield in FASnI3 than that in FAPbI3 is experimentally evidenced by the superoxide fluorescent probe, which suggests that superoxide has more negative effects on the light/O2 stability for the FASnI3 perovskite. Such a superoxide can decompose FASnI3 into CH4N2, SnO2, I2, and H2O. The theoretical calculation reveals that the formation energy of the most preferred sites (iodine vacancy, VI) for superoxide formation in FASnI3 is higher than that in FAPbI3, and superoxide formation at VI is more energetically favorable in FASnI3. We then selected several additives intending to fill VI in FASnI3 by the halide and found that 8-bromotheophylline (theophylline-Br) works the best as an effective passivator. Systematic capacitance-dominated characterization has distinguished the reduction of surface and interior VI after incorporating theophylline-Br. Consequently, the excellent passivation of theophylline-Br for both surface and interior VI suppresses superoxide formation, leading to significantly enhanced light/O2 stability and improved device efficiency from 12.1% to 13.8%. Our work provides a new pathway to improve the O2-related stability of Sn-based perovskites and devices in their practical application.
Results and discussion
We prepared and tested the perovskite films by immersing the glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskites in dry toluene under a constant flow of dry O2 and illumination to create an environment of light/O2 exposure or only O2 exposure. The condition of only light exposure is excluded in our study since the FASnI3 film and device exhibit relatively good stability under only light exposure.29,31 From the photos of FASnI3 films without aging treatment and after light/O2 exposure, only O2 exposure are shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). 10 min O2 exposure without light illumination leads to the noticeable degradation of the FASnI3 film with the color changing from black to red, which is consistent with the vulnerability of the Sn-based perovskite to O2.23 In contrast, the FASnI3 film under light/O2 exposure for the same duration has much more severe degradation, and even partial film has been completely decomposed, indicating the particularly negative effect of light/O2, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†).

(e) PL intensity of DPBF/toluene solution in which the films were aged under light/O2, representing the yield of O2− formation. 
We then performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for these FASnI3 perovskite films (Fig. 1(b)). The reference FASnI3 film shows the XRD patterns with typical peaks corresponding to [100], [102], [200], [122], [222], and [213] facets at 14.0°, 24.4°, 26.4°, 33.7°, 41.1°, and 43.2°, respectively. The other three peaks belong to the underlying ITO, labeled as hash marks (#). Upon 5 min O2 exposure, the diffraction intensities of these facet series belonging to the orthorhombic FASnI3 all drop sharply. On the other hand, the diffraction peaks of these facet series belonging to FASnI3 nearly disappear upon 5 min light/O2 exposure, indicating much inferior film quality.
Observing more severe degradation of FASnI3 triggered by light in the presence of O2, we infer that O2 molecules can act as the electron scavenger to combine with the photoexcited electrons from the perovskite under light to produce superoxide anion (O2−), deprotonating the organic cation and leading to degradation.21 To confirm this, we employed a molecular fluorescent probe, i.e., 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF), to quantify the yield of O2− formation under light/O2 exposure. The DPBF delivers a characteristic intensity decrease at a specific wavelength in the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum upon exposure to superoxide radical anions.20 By monitoring the change in the PL intensity of the DPBF/toluene solution with time, the yield of O2− formation from the reaction of photoexcited electrons in the perovskite with O2 molecules can be obtained. To compare the yield of O2− formation between Sn-based and Pb-based perovskites, the FAPbI3 film was included as a control.
Both FASnI3 and FAPbI3 films were immersed in the DPBF/toluene solution to isolate moisture. Then, dry O2 was bubbled into the mixed solution under illumination to create a light/O2 condition (see details in Experimental Section). According to the PL peak intensities collected from the DPBF/toluene solutions (Fig. 1(c) and (d)), we calculated the measured increase rate of the O2− species in FASnI3 and FAPbI3 films, as illustrated in Fig. 1(e). It is evident that the FASnI3 film gives a higher yield of superoxide formation than the FAPbI3 film, which implies that superoxide formation by direct electron transfer from the perovskite to O2 is more energetically favorable in the Sn-based perovskite. The resultant degradation of FASnI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites is reflected by the color change: after 5 min light/O2 exposure, the color of the FASnI3 film turned deep red while that of the FAPbI3 film still remained black (Fig. S2, ESI†). The higher superoxide yield and more severe superoxide-induced degradation in FASnI3 suggest that the Sn-based perovskite is more sensitive and vulnerable than Pb-based perovskite to light/O2 exposure.
Extending the previous practice on superoxide-induced degradation in MAPbI3 perovskite,17 we predicted the potential routes for degradation caused by the superoxide in FASnI3 films as follows. (1) (2) 4FASnI3* + O2− → 4CH4N2 + 4SnI2 + I2 + 2H2O(3)
The resulting water as the products of the reaction (3) can then participate in further degradation pathways as follows. (4)
Finally, the reactant SnI2 that comes from both reactions (3) and (4) will be oxidized as follows. SnI2 + O2− → SnO2 + I2(5)
If these assumptions hold, the corresponding FASnI3 PSCs are bound to suffer from severe efficiency attenuation due to the deprotonation of FA+, the oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, and the escape of iodine. Under light/O2 exposure, although O2 itself may still degrade FASnI3, superoxide-induced degradation is identified as the dominant degradation process according to our above observations.
We then performed a sequence of characterizations to elucidate the degradation process and products in a combination of light and dry O2. Note that the aging period of the perovskite films is 5 min for all the film characterizations in this section, unless otherwise specified.
We firstly conducted scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements to analyze the morphological change in the aged FASnI3 films (Fig. 2(a)–(c)). In contrast to the O2-exposed film that seems to degrade from grain boundaries, the light/O2-exposed film gives overall degradation from both grain boundaries and grain interiors. The results (Fig. 2(d)) from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in Fig. S3 (ESI†) reveal that the Sn/I atomic proportion of O2-exposed and light/O2-exposed perovskite films increases to 11:9 and 11:2, respectively, from 1:3 of the fresh reference film. Combined with the degradation conditions from SEM images, we infer that a faster and overall escape of iodine components occurs in the FASnI3 film upon light/O2 exposure compared with that upon only O2 exposure. To further confirm whether the escaped component is iodine or iodide, UV-vis spectroscopy was recorded for its evolution in the toluene solution. As illustrated in Fig. 2(e), an absorption peak at 360 nm is obtained after one sample completely degrades in the toluene solution. This peak intensity is further enhanced, and the color of the solution gradually turns from faint yellow to deep yellow (Fig. S4, ESI†), as the number of aged samples in the toluene solution increases. These observations suggest that some compound or simple substance as the degradation product is dissolved in toluene, which is speculated to be iodine. After the addition of sodium thiosulfate, the deep yellow solution changes to colorless, which verifies the reduction of iodine to iodide (Fig. 2(f)).17

(i) FTIR spectra of the corresponding films. 
SnO2 as the product of superoxide-induced degradation of FASnI3 was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and EDS measurements. Fig. 2(g) and (h) show the narrow spectra of Sn of the corresponding FASnI3 films. The content of Sn4+ increases to 70.8% for the light/O2-treated film and 53.2% for the O2-treated film from 6.1% for the control film (Table S1, ESI†). Such a substantial increase in Sn4+ indicates the severe transformation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ under light/O2 exposure. To exclude the possible impact of oxygen in the substrate (ITO/glass) on the EDS measurement, a silicon wafer without silicon oxide was used as a substrate. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the distribution of oxygen presents on the FASnI3 film after light/O2 exposure. These results confirm the formation of SnO2.
The deprotonation of MA+ in MAPbI3 by the reaction between the superoxide and organic component in the perovskite has been demonstrated in a previous work.17 Similarly, it is reasonably inferred that FA+ in FASnI3 can also be deprotonated by superoxide, leading to the transformation from FA+ to CH4N2 (FA). From the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results (Fig. 2(i)), the symmetric stretching vibrations of C–N at 1040 cm−1 of the FASnI3 film are enhanced after exposure to light/O2. We infer that the N in the amino group of FA+ belongs to sp2 hybridization that can form the conjugated structure with CN, leading to weak vibration. When the FA+ is deprotonated to FA by superoxide, the conjugated structure can be broken and thus causes the noticeable enhancement of stretching vibrations of C–N. Therefore, we reasonably confirm water as another byproduct of FASnI3 decomposition under light/O2.
As experimentally analyzed above, FASnI3 has a higher yield of superoxide and consequently more severe superoxide-induced degradation than FAPbI3 under light/O2 exposure, which implies the fatal role of superoxide in stability degradation of Sn-based perovskites. Since iodine vacancy (VI) is the main defect of superoxide formation in Pb-based perovskites,21,32 it is supposed that VI tends to be easily formed in FASnI3 and binds strongly to O2 compared with that in FAPbI3. To verify this hypothesis, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Defect formation energy is directly dependent on the element chemical potentials, which determine whether FAPbI3 and FASnI3 are stable under thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions. The simulation details are described in Supporting Information. The calculated phase diagrams of FAPbI3 and FASnI3 are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. For FAPbI3, three different growth conditions marked by point A (ΔμI = 0 eV, ΔμPb = −1.96 eV, ΔμFA = −2.69 eV), point B (ΔμI = −0.49 eV, ΔμPb = −0.98 eV, ΔμFA = −2.2 eV), and point C (ΔμI = −0.98 eV, ΔμPb = 0 eV, ΔμFA = −1.71 eV) correspond to the I-rich, I-moderate, and Pb-rich conditions, respectively. Similarly, point A (ΔμI = −0.175 eV, ΔμSn = −1.16 eV, ΔμFA = −2.675 eV), point B (ΔμI = −0.465 eV, ΔμSn = −0.58 eV, ΔμFA = −2.385 eV), and point C (ΔμI = −0.755 eV, ΔμSn = −0 eV, ΔμFA = −2.095 eV) for FASnI3 correspond to the I-rich, I-moderate, and Sn-rich conditions. The red regions in Fig. 3(a) and (b) meet the thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions for both the perovskites. The secondary phase compounds will appear outside the red regions.

The regions in accordance with thermodynamic equilibrium growth conditions for both perovskites are marked in red color. (c) Formation energy of VI in FAPbI3 and FASnI3 under I-rich, moderate, and Pb-/Sn-rich conditions. (d) Formation energy of superoxide when O2 is incorporated in VI-containing perovskites, and (e) corresponding Bader charge showing the amount of electron transfer to O2. 
Using the determined chemical potentials of FA, I, and Pb/Sn in the red regions, we obtained the formation energy of VI in FAPbI3 and FASnI3 (Fig. 3(c)), corresponding to I-rich, moderate, and Pb-/Sn-rich conditions. Removing an I atom from FASnI3 consumed 0.38–0.96 eV from Sn-rich to I-rich conditions, which correspondingly increases to 1.08–2.05 eV from Pb-rich to I-rich conditions for FAPbI3. Thus, the formation of VI is much easier in FASnI3 than in FAPbI3 under all conditions, which provides more sites to bind to O2 and form superoxide. This may also suggest that excessive Sn-based additives (e.g., SnF2 and metallic Sn) could create Sn-rich condition to some degree and cause the lowest formation energy of VI in FASnI3, leading to increased possibility of accelerated superoxide formation. Further evidence is given by the smaller formation energy of an O2 incorporated into the VI-containing FASnI3 than that into FAPbI3, i.e., −2.0 versus −1.46 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The Bader charge (Fig. 3(d)) shows that O2 in FASnI3 (1.18 e) gains more electrons than that in FAPbI3 (0.77 e), which separately increases the O–O bond length to 1.49 and 1.35 Å, respectively. The longer O–O bond length causes stronger atomic fluctuations that accelerate perovskite degradation.18 Therefore, the simulation results rationalize our experimental observations that FASnI3 exposed to light/O2 degrades much faster and more severely than FAPbI3.
Based on the calculations, VI takes responsibility for the superoxide-induced severe degradation in Sn-based perovskites. We targeted several additives for FASnI3 intending to reduce VI, including 8-bromotheophylline (theophylline-Br), 8-chlorotheophylline (theophylline-Cl), choline bromide (choline-Br), and choline chloride (choline-Cl). The molecular structures of these additives are shown in Fig. 4(a), where the halide anion aims to fill VI.33,34 Hereafter, FASnI3 in the devices is doped with the commonly used ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) to achieve high-quality films.35,36 The reason why the additives containing I-site were not chosen here is that we found that the EDAI2 additive has weak suppression of the superoxide formation for FASnI3 (Fig. S6, ESI†). We then examined the superoxide yield of the modified perovskite films under light/O2 by molecular fluorescent probe DPBF as mentioned before, where the optimal concentrations of these additives were confirmed, as tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†). The superoxide yields from different samples are plotted in Fig. 4(b). All the modified samples show decreased superoxide yield compared to the reference sample, implying enhanced tolerance to light/O2 benefiting from the passivation effect of the selected halide-containing additives. Among these samples, theophylline-Br-modified FASnI3 film delivers the lowest superoxide yield, while the other three additives exhibit only moderately improved abilities to suppress superoxide formation. Hence, theophylline-Br is chosen as an additive for further device fabrication and consequent investigation of passivation mechanism.

We fabricated inverted FASnI3 PSCs with the structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/FASnI3/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing reference and theophylline-Br-modified PSCs are shown in Fig. 4(c). The statistical photovoltaic parameters of these devices under reverse and forward voltage scan are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The champion reference device has a PCE of 12.1% with a JSC of 23.8 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.72 V, and a FF of 0.71. Upon optimization, the best-performing theophylline-Br-modified device obtains an enhanced PCE of 13.8% with a JSC of 24.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.76 V, and a FF of 0.75. The integrated JSCs from their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are 22.7 and 23.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4(d)) for the reference and theophylline-Br-modified device, respectively, which are in agreement with the JSCs from the J–V measurements. The stabilized PCE at the maximum power point was recorded as 11.7% and 13.6% for the reference and theophylline-Br-modified PSCs, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Considering the fast rate of O2 diffusion into perovskite films,21 we infer that both surface and interior VI defects can be the formation sites of superoxide, which trap photo-induced electrons, followed by electron transfer and reaction with O2. More specifically, superoxide species immediately start to form at the surface of the perovskite film as O2 is reduced while occupying surface VI. At the same time, O2 diffuses into the bulk perovskite, where it occupies interior VI while being reduced, causing the overall degradation of the perovskites (Fig. 5(a)). Further, surface VI is regarded as deep-level defects, which are the main non-radiative recombination centers, leading to severe losses of charge carriers and voltage.37–39 Interior VI in the bulk perovskite belongs to shallow-level defects, which are the origins of deleterious ion migration and accumulation of charge traps.40–42 Considering the remarkably reduced superoxide yield after theophylline-Br modification and the crucial role of VI from theoretical calculation, we infer that the mainly passivated defect type by theophylline-Br is VI. Thus, we next performed a sequence of characterizations to verify and differentiate the reduction of surface and interior VI after theophylline-Br modification.

The migration of charged point defects (such as interior VI) under electric field can cause the accumulation of charged ions at the interfaces, leading to unintentional doping effects, detrimental local band bending, phase segregation, and perovskite degradation.41 The degree of migration and accumulation of charged point defects can be quantified by the hysteresis index (HI) from J–V hysteresis. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the average HI of PSCs decreases from 0.026 to 0.007 after incorporating theophylline-Br, suggesting the reduction of interior VI. On the other hand, the accumulation of ionic charges at the interface interrupts the extraction of photogenerated carriers and affects the capacitance at the interface.43 As illustrated in the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 5(b)), the slope of the fit line of the theophylline-Br-modified device is 1.5 times higher than that of the reference device, implying that the modified device has a wider depletion layer and lower carrier density at the perovskite/C60 interface.42 The consequently faster charge transfer can be attributed to the suppressed migration and accumulation of charged point defects, i.e., interior VI. This is in agreement with the EIS results that charge recombination resistance (Rrec) values are more enormous in the theophylline-Br-modified device than that in the reference device due to the mitigated interface recombination (Fig. 5(c)).
To further investigate the effect of theophylline-Br on energetic distribution, we performed thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurement. The trap density of states (tDOS) is estimated from the angular frequency-dependent capacitance using eqn (6) (6)where C is the capacitance, ω is the angular frequency, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Vbi and W represent the built-in potential and the depletion width extracted from the Mott–Schottky plot, respectively.44,45 The applied angular frequency ω defines the energetic demarcation using eqn (7) (7)where ω0 is the attempt-to-escape frequency and can be calculated from the frequency-dependent capacitance plot via the relaxation process.46 The trap states below the energy demarcation are expected to capture or emit charge carriers with the given ω and contribute to the capacitance. The tDOS spectra containing different types of traps at different energy levels are shown in Fig. 5(d). In the case of additives for vacancy passivation, the changes in the tDOS at shallow energy levels (∼0.3–0.4 eV, Band 1) and at deep energy levels (∼0.4–0.6 eV, Band 2) can represent the increase or decrease in the interior and surface VI vacancies, respectively.47,48 The tDOS of the theophylline-Br-modified PSC at both Band 1 and Band 2 is significantly lowered, suggesting its effective passivation effect for both interior and surface VI vacancies.
Drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) is another capacitance-related technique that provides well-characterized spatial distributions of carrier density (NC) and trap density (NT) in perovskite films.49–51 The depth distribution of NC and NT from DLCP helps differentiate the interior and surface vacancy changes after incorporating theophylline-Br. It is known that any traps with a trap depth shallower than the critical value that can respond to the alternating current (AC) frequency are considered for calculating the total carrier density. Moreover, the lower the AC frequency, the deeper the trap states that can be detected. Only the relatively shallow-level trap states and the free carriers can be detected at high AC frequencies. Therefore, the NT equals the total carrier density measured at low AC frequencies minus the free NC measured at high AC frequencies. Fig. 5(e) shows the depth profile of free NC throughout the perovskite layer, where the free NC at both rear and top interfaces drops after the incorporation of theophylline-Br, indicating the mitigated carrier migration and accumulation caused by interior VI. Fig. 5(f) shows the spatial distribution of NT in the FASnI3 perovskite. Compared with that of the reference device, the maximal NT at the perovskite/C60 interface (top interface) in the theophylline-Br-modified device decreases slightly from 4.7 × 1016 to 1.3 × 1016 cm−3, while that at the perovskite/PEDOT:PSS interface (buried interface) drops sharply from 6.5 × 1015 to 1.6 × 1014 cm−3, suggesting the remarkable passivation effect for the interface defects such as the surface VI. Notably, the more pronounced passivation effect at the buried interface than that at the top interface may imply that VI preferentially forms close to the HTL/perovskite interface in the FASnI3 PSCs. As the profiling position changes from the interfaces to the interior of the perovskite film, the NT in bulk perovskites is moderately reduced due to the suppressed interior VI. The overall changes of NT from DLCP are in accordance with the TAS results. The thickness of the perovskite layer in DLCP is also confirmed from the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices (Fig. S8, ESI†).
We then performed PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements to investigate the effect of theophylline-Br additives on the charge recombination behavior and dynamics in FASnI3 perovskites. As shown in Fig. 5(g), compared with the reference film, the blue shift of the PL peak from 899 to 895 nm and the enhanced PL intensity of the theophylline-Br-modified perovskite implies significantly suppressed non-radiative recombination, possibly as a consequence of reduced surface VI. Furthermore, the carrier lifetime of the perovskite films was obtained by fitting the TRPL decays with a bi-exponential function (Table S4, ESI†). It is known that the faster decay lifetime τ1 is derived from the radiative charge recombination in the perovskite bulk, while the slower decay lifetime τ2 is ascribed to the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination.52 After the passivation of theophylline-Br, the faster decay lifetime τ1 enlarged from 3.8 to 5.0 ns, which suggests improved quality of the bulk perovskite due to reduced interior VI. Meanwhile, the slower decay lifetime τ2 of the theophylline-Br-modified film is significantly prolonged from 1.9 to 10.8 ns, indicating that the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination caused by surface VI has been suppressed. Consequently, the incorporation of theophylline-Br increases the average carrier lifetime from 2.0 to 6.5 ns, indicating largely suppressed VI at the surface and in the bulk.
Finally, we aged the unencapsulated reference and theophylline-Br-modified PSCs under light/O2 environment (dry air, RH less than 1%, 25 °C). As a result of the remarkable passivation effect of theophylline-Br for surface and interior VI, the most preferred locations for superoxide formation are sufficiently suppressed. The theophylline-Br-modified device retains 86% of its initial 13.2% PCE after 500 min of light/O2 aging, while the reference device only retains 50% of its initial 11.2% PCE after 180 min of light/O2 aging (Fig. 5(i)).
Conclusion
We have revealed that FASnI3 suffers more severe degradation under exposure to light/O2 than only O2, which is attributed to the superoxide generated by the reaction between O2 molecules and photoexcited electrons. The superoxide-induced degradation routes of FASnI3 were proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The simulation results revealed that the most preferred sites (VI) for superoxide formation are more prone to form in FASnI3 than in FAPbI3; meanwhile, the superoxide formation is more energetically favorable at VI in FASnI3 than in FAPbI3. Thus, the higher yield of superoxide is more fatal to the stability of the FASnI3 perovskite and devices. Combined with the fluorescent probe results, the capacitance-dominated characterizations can systematically differentiate the reduction of surface and interior VI after theophylline-Br modification. Consequently, the reduction of surface and interior VI achieved by theophylline-Br enabled suppressed superoxide formation, leading to the remarkable enhancement of light/O2 stability and efficiency of devices.

Broader context
The most notorious issue of tin (Sn)-based perovskites is their high vulnerability to O2, which distracts the attention of researchers from their light/O2 stability. Learning from the process of superoxide generation in lead (Pb)-based perovskites and the organic compositions of most Sn-based perovskites, superoxide-induced degradation is very likely to occur under exposure to light/O2. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that (NH2)2CHSnI3 (FASnI3) suffers more severe degradation under light/O2 than only O2, which is caused by the superoxide generated from O2 accepting photoexcited electrons. The superoxide-induced degradation routes of FASnI3 were proposed and proved accordingly. Theoretical calculation revealed that in comparison with FAPbI3, the most preferred sites (iodine vacancy, VI) for superoxide formation are more prone to form in FASnI3, and superoxide generation is more energetically favorable at the VI in FASnI3. These shortcomings lead to higher superoxide yield in FASnI3 than FAPbI3, indicating the more negative effects of superoxide on light/O2 stability for Sn-based perovskites and solar cells. Combined with superoxide yield measurement, capacitance-dominated characterization can systematically differentiate the reduction of surface and interior VI upon the incorporation of theophylline-Br in the FASnI3 precursor, which leads to significantly enhanced light/O2 stability and device efficiency.
