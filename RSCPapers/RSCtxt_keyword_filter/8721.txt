    , Accepted 30th July 2015First published on 30th July 2015AbstractA fullerene end-capped polymer-compatibilizer based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was synthesized and demonstrated to have a remarkable effect on both the stability and efficiency of devices made from exemplar P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). P3HT with ethynyl chain-ends and α-azido-ω-bromo-PS were prepared via Grignard metathesis (GRIM) and atom transfer radical polymerisation, respectively. “Click” chemistry resulted in the preparation of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-ω-bromo-polystyrene (P3HT-b-PS-Br), and subsequent atom transfer radical addition chemistry with fullerene (C60) yielded the donor–acceptor block copolymer P3HT-b-PS-C60. Both P3HT-b-PS-Br and P3HT-b-PS-C60 were considered as compatibilizers with P3HT/PCBM blends, with the study detailing effects on active-layer morphology, device efficiency and stability. When used at low concentrations, both P3HT-b-PS-Br (1%) and P3HT-b-PS-C60 (0.5%) resulted in considerable 28% and 35% increases in efficiencies with respect to devices made from P3HT/PCBM alone. Furthermore, P3HT-b-PS-C60 (0.5%) resulted in an important improvement in device stability.
Introduction
Solar cells using polymers in the active layer offer considerable advantages as they are cheap, printable, near-transparent, colourful, and compatible with flexible substrates and light-weight applications. Their fabrication by high-throughput, roll-to-roll processes makes them a promising photovoltaic technology.1–5 Today, the main challenges consist of increasing stability while retaining, or better, improving device efficiencies.6,7 For cells based on bulk-heterojunctions (BHJs), it is critical to prevent charge recombination, while enhancing charge-transfer and collection.8–10 The polymer active layer should exhibit a bicontinuous network with domain widths close to the exciton-diffusion length and high donor–acceptor interfacial areas to respectively favour exciton-dissociation and charge-transport. BHJs based on the exemplar poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) give efficiencies in the range of 3–5%.11 Despite continuous improvements in efficiencies, for example by replacing P3HT with low-band gap polymers, there remain two major drawbacks: a poorly controlled electron donor (D)/acceptor (A) domain size distribution and the inherent thermal morphological instabilities. As phase separation in BHJ active layers is governed by thermodynamics, it is difficult to control experimentally, and the final structure contains phases with a distribution of sizes (due to coarsening and nucleation effects) which heavily impact the device properties.12 The BHJ may be stabilized by varying the ratios of the components, solvents, casting methods, thermal or solvent annealing, and by using solvent and molecular additives.13–20
Block copolymers have been identified as particularly promising materials for tuning microphase separation in BHJs.21–23 One block is commonly of the same nature as the donor semiconducting polymer while the second may vary with respect to desirable functionalities. Specifically, the amphiphilic nature of block copolymers and their ability to self-assemble into highly ordered and thermodynamically stable mesostructures render them attractive for tailoring BHJ morphologies.24–31 Sommer et al.,32 Sary et al.,33 and Mingu et al.34 reported an enhancement of phase separation and thermal stability, as well as increased internal quantum efficiencies, by employing rod–coil, donor–acceptor, and block copolymers as compatibilizers. Renaud et al. reported a systematic investigation of the photovoltaic performance in P3HT:PCBM-based solar cell devices when a tailored poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P3HT-b-P4VP) polymer was added as a nano-structuring agent.35 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached a plateau of 3.4% with P3HT-b-P4VP at 4% w/w without solvent or thermal annealing. After a thermal annealing treatment, the PCE increased to 4.3%. They demonstrated that improvements were due to the formation of a well-optimized nanoscale structure. Sun et al.36 showed that adding poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-polystyrene (P3HT-b-PS) to P3HT:PCBM blends increased the crystallinity of P3HT and homogenized the vertical distribution of P3HT and PCBM in the active layer. They attributed these outcomes to the favourable interactions of the P3HT block with the P3HT homopolymer and the strong affinity of the PS block toward PCBM, which led to enhanced hole-transport/charge extraction and absorption range. As a consequence, the device efficiency was improved by 35% with the addition of 5 wt% P3HT-b-PS or 7 wt% P3HT-b-PI to the active layer.36,37 Similarly, Yang et al.38 showed that adding a 5% donor–acceptor diblock copolymer based on P3HT containing C60 led to 30% higher efficiency compared with that of P3HT:PCBM alone. Such materials would be expected to considerably stabilise the active layer morphology due to increased compatibilities between respective blocks and domains. While numerous studies have looked at polymers with grafted, pendent C60, relatively few have dealt with chain-end C60.39 Facile routes do exist to the atom transfer radical addition of brominated PS to C60, as demonstrated by Li40,41 and Mathis.42,43
In this context, we compare the use of P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-C60 as additives in P3HT:PCBM blends and evaluate the improvement of both the stability and the power-conversion efficiency of P3HT:PCBM-based solar cells. The structures of P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-C60 are shown in Scheme 1. It is demonstrated that both materials, to varying degrees and in small proportions, compatibilise P3HT-blend-PCBM leading to well-organised structures that support improved device efficiencies and stabilities. It is hoped that this system will encourage further developments in analogous low-band gap polymers.

Experimental details
Materials
All solvents were used as distilled from over their respective drying agents. All chemicals were received from Aldrich and used as received unless specified. 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker® Avance 400 spectrometer at ambient temperature in CDCl3. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed using THF as an eluant at 35 °C and a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 through 4 columns [TSK G5000HXL (9 μm), G4000HXL (6 μm), G3000HXL (6 μm), and G2000HXL (5 μm)] connected to a Varian refractometer and a UV-visible spectrophotometer calibrated against linear polystyrene standards. Further equipment is detailed in the ESI.†

P3HT-b-PS-Br. 
ω-Ethynyl-P3HT (219 mg, 0.022 mmol), α-azido-ω-bromo-PS (280 mg, 0.073 mmol), CuI (40 mg, 0.210 mmol), DIPEA (diisopropylethylamine, 565 mg, 4.38 mmol) and THF (30 mL) were introduced into a 50 mL round-bottom flask, evacuated for 10 min and backfilled with nitrogen (3 cycles). Then, the reaction mixture was subjected to sonication (2 h) to aid ω-ethynyl-P3HT dissolution in THF (clear orange solution) and the flask was placed in a constant temperature oil bath at 50 °C for 5 days. The solution was passed through a neutral alumina column in order to remove copper salt. After concentration, the product was recovered by precipitation in methanol, dried under reduced pressure, and then three times dissolved in a minimum of THF and precipitated in acetone to remove unreacted PS and low molar mass P3HT. Further overnight drying under reduced pressure yielded a pure copolymer. SEC (THF, 35 °C, 254 nm) Mn = 14900 g mol−1 and Đ = 1.27. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δH: 7.52 (s, [CH]–N), 7.0–7.2 (m, Ar, PS), 6.97 (s, Ar, thiophenyl), 6.3–6.7 (m, Ar, PS), 3.74 (m, N–CH2– and –O–CH2), 2.7 (m, –CH2–), 2.54 (m, –CH2–, chain-end), 1.1–2.0 (m, –CH2–), 0.9 (t, –CH3) ppm.


P3HT-block-PS-C60. 
C60 (28 mg, 0.039 mmol), CuBr (12 mg, 0.084 mmol), 2,2′-bipyridine (26 mg, 0.017 mmol) and P3HT-block-PS-Br (91 mg, 0.0065 mmol) were introduced to a 50 mL round-bottom flask and dissolved in 20 mL of chlorobenzene (freshly distilled over CaH2). The mixture was stirred for 5 min and degassed three times by freeze–pump–thaw cycles to remove residual oxygen. Then, the reaction was performed at 110 °C for 24 h. The mixture was added dropwise into THF (200 mL) to precipitate unreacted fullerene that was then removed along with copper salts by passing the solution through a neutral alumina column. Once precipitated from THF in excess methanol, the polymer was recovered by filtration, redissolved in THF and again passed through a fresh column. This procedure was repeated three times, followed by precipitation in methanol and drying under reduced pressure at 40 °C for 3 days yielding pure C60-attached copolymer P3HT-block-PS-C60. SEC (THF, 35 °C, 254 nm) Mn = 15400 g mol−1 and Đ = 1.43. δH: 7.52 (s, [CH]–N), 7.0–7.2 (m, Ar, PS), 6.97 (s, Ar, thiophenyl), 6.3–6.7 (m, Ar, PS), 3.74 (m, N–CH2– and –O–CH2), 2.7 (m, –CH2–), 2.54 (m, –CH2–, chain-end), 1.1–2.0 (m, –CH2–), 0.9 (t, –CH3) ppm.
Other synthetic routes to the chemicals shown in Schemes 1 and 2 are detailed in the ESI† along with the relevant characterisation.
 Scheme 2  Preparation of the ATRP initiator. 

Solar cell preparation
Glass/ITO substrates were cleaned using ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, and exposed to a UV–O3 plasma for 15 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 5000 rpm and dried in an oven at 110 °C under a rotary pump vacuum for 1 h. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was 50 nm as measured by using an Alpha-step IQ surface profilometer. All procedures after PEDOT:PSS deposition were performed in an inert-atmosphere (N2) in a glovebox (O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm). Subsequently, the photoactive layer was prepared from a solution of P3HT (20 mg mL−1) and PCBM (20 mg mL−1) in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Then, the P3HT:PCBM blend with different ratios (0% to 5%) of each additive (P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-C60) was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the photoactive layer was typically in the range of 100–150 nm. The aluminium electrode was thermally deposited (100 nm) through a shadow mask with an average pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. Thermal annealing treatment was performed after aluminium electrode deposition (post annealing treatment) on a temperature-controlled hot plate at 165 °C for 10 min. Devices were left to cool down to room temperature before testing. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 4200 SCS, under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 from a KHS Solar Cell test 575 solar simulator with AM1.5G filters. Four 8.6 mm2 photovoltaic cells were fabricated on each 15 × 15 mm2 substrate. In order to check the repeatability of the characteristics, the measurements were performed on 16 different devices. Further details are given in the ESI.†
AFM and TEM characterisation
All thin films were first observed with AFM, which does not damage the samples, followed by TEM. AFM images were recorded in air at room temperature with a Nanoscope IIIa microscope operating in tapping mode. The probes were commercially available as silicon tips with a spring constant of 42 N m−1, resonance frequency of 285 kHz, and a typical radius of curvature in the 10–12 nm range. The measurements were carried out at specific positions of the sample with different scan sizes (typically 1, 3 and 5 μm). Each scanned micrograph consists of 512 lines. Images were taken continuously with a scan rate of 1.0 Hz. The preparation of the AFM samples was performed by peeling off the aluminium electrode partially covering the active layer. AFM characterization was also conducted on the areas not covered by the aluminium electrode in order to exclude any morphological damage induced by this process. Following AFM measurements, the active layer films were collected from the devices for further TEM observations. For that purpose, the devices were immersed into deionized water to dissolve PEDOT:PSS and allow the blend film to float. It was then collected and placed on a 400 square-mesh copper TEM grid (Agar Sci., Inc.). As spatial resolution obtained under focused conditions is limited,44,45 images were taken under slightly defocused (i.e., phase contrast) conditions to better visualize the fibres, rods, and networks of the constituents. For example, in bright-field TEM under these particular experimental conditions, P3HT nanorods appear bright, and PCBM-rich regions appear dark because of the lower density of P3HT crystals (1.1 g cm−3) as compared to PCBM (1.5 g cm−3).45–49
Results and discussion
Synthesis of block copolymers
Appropriately terminated P3HT, of predeterminable molecular weight, was prepared through in situ functionalization of an active GRIM chain-growth polymerisation of dibromo-3-hexylthiophene,50 to give ω-ethynyl-P3HT in high yield.51,52 The 1H NMR of ω-ethynyl-P3HT (Fig. S4†) shows the typical peaks associated with regioregular P3HT (ca. 97%) along with a minor peak at 3.52 ppm due to the ethynyl chain-ends, similarly confirmed by 13C NMR (Fig. S5†) with a small peak at 68.0 ppm. MALDI-TOF characterisation (Fig. S6†) showed, as expected,51 that a minor proportion (21%) of macromolecules carried two ethynylated chain-ends, and therefore it should be remembered in the ensuing “click” chemistry described below that a mixture of P3HT-b-PS and PS-b-P3HT-b-PS was formed. The SEC of ω-ethynyl-P3HT (Fig. 1) indicated Mn = 14000 g mol−1 and dispersity, Đ = Mn/Mw = 1.1. Given that these values are against polystyrene standards, to obtain the “real” molar mass, a coefficient of around 2 should be used,53 thus giving Mn (ω-ethynyl-P3HT) = 7000 g mol−1 (i.e., equal to ca. 40 repeating units).

To obtain a PS with the appropriate azido-group, the ATRP initiator was prepared as in Scheme 2. Synthetic details are given in the ESI.† It is worth noting that the preparation of the intermediate 3-azido-1-propanol from 3-bromo-propanol using sodium azide in accordance with a literature procedure gave low yields (15%) in our hands.54 However, performing the reaction in the presence of dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 and butanone, as suggested by Fernandez-Santana,55 increased yields to around 83% due to the improved nucleophilic activity of the azide anion.56 Furthermore, in preparing the initiator, 3-azidopropyl-2-bromoisobutyrate from our 3-azido-1-propanol, we found that the literature procedure57 gave rise to an inseparable mixture of the product and a reagent, acyl bromide, even having tried various ratios of mixed eluents of dichloromethane, toluene, ethyl acetate, hexane, or ethyl acetate with little success in our lab. We found changing down the ratio of excess acyl bromide to 3-azido-1-propanol from 1.5 equivalents to 1.1 resulted in a good yield of 81%.
α-Azido-ω-bromo-polystyrenes of various molar masses were synthesized following the protocol given in the ESI, and as indicated in Table S1.† The reaction was performed at 130 °C with a normal CuBr/bipyridine catalytic system (Scheme 1), there being no interference between atom transfer radical polymerizations (ATRP) and azide groups,58 and stopped abruptly by lowering the temperature to 0 °C. Short reaction times were preferred with low conversions in order to avoid secondary reactions and retain PS-Br chain-ends. Fig. S11 and S12† show the 1H and 13C NMRs, respectively, of α-azido-ω-bromo-polystyrenes with peaks in accordance with expectation. Infra-red spectroscopy confirmed the presence of azide groups by way of the expected absorption at ca. 2100 cm−1 (see Fig. S12†).
The synthesis of P3HT-b-PS diblock copolymers exploits robust “click” methodologies.59 The reaction between ω-ethynyl-P3HT and α-azido-PS was successfully achieved through modifying prior work.52 It is worth noting that ω-ethynyl-P3HT displayed a much lower reactivity towards “click” chemistry than P3HTs with ethynyl groups separated from the P3HT by alkyl chains, most likely due to conjugation with the main chain (see Fig. S15†). Taking inspiration from ref. 60–62 which showed that it is possible to obtain copolymers from ethynyl-conjugates by varying conditions, we optimized conditions using CuI and Hunig's base diisopropylethylamine [(i-pr)2NEt, DIEA or DIPEA] in THF at 50 °C. Sonication was found to be particularly important to ensure full solvation of the ω-ethynyl-P3HT prior to chemistry.
The diblock copolymers obtained were characterized by SEC (Fig. 1), infrared spectroscopy (Fig. S14†) and 1H NMR (Fig. 2 and S15†). The SEC chromatograms showed an increase in molar mass; however, it was a relatively small shift toward lower elution times. This would be expected due to the change in the exclusion behaviour of the macromolecules in going from rigid P3HTs to a rod-coil structure. Thus, P3HT of indicated molar mass 14000 g mol−1 and probable real mass of ca. 7000 g mol−1 with α-azido-ω-bromo-PS (Mn = 3800, Đ = 1.17) yielded the product P3HT-b-PS of indicated molar mass 14900 g mol−1 and Đ = 1.27. It is notable, however, that the SEC of ω-ethynyl-P3HT carries a small portion of P3HT with a molar mass double that of the main material. This is associated with disproportionation of the Ni catalyst through the reaction with water present in the 5 M HCl of the termination step and the coupling of P3HT chains.63 That the area of the corresponding peak increases greatly on reaction with α-azido-ω-bromo-PS confirms the presence of PS-b-P3HT-b-PS by this process and also that of the reaction of the portion (ca. 21%) of α,ω-diethynyl-P3HT in the ω-ethynyl-P3HT sample. FT-IR (Fig. S14†) confirmed the formation of P3HT-b-PS by way of the removal of the peak at 2100 cm−1 corresponding to the azide function. In the NMR the expected peaks for P3HT and PS are found, while the peak at 3.52 ppm due to the ethynyl group (see Fig. S11†) has disappeared. A new peak at 7.51 ppm corresponding to the formation of a triazole ring (proton f) demonstrates the cycloaddition in both the NMRs of P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-C60 (see Fig. S15†).
 Fig. 2  
1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) spectrum of P3HT-b-PS. 
P3HT-b-PS-C60 was prepared as shown in Scheme 1. The work by Zhou et al. on the mono-addition of PS-Br to C60 was of particular use.64 In order to reduce the possibility of bis-additions to the C60, by way of the formation of a weak PS-C60-Br intermediate, the reaction was performed in chlorobenzene with a high excess of C60. A slight increase in the Mn was found from 14900 to 15400 g mol−1 in going from P3HT-block-PS to P3HT-block-PS-C60 (see Fig. 1) in accordance with expectations. 1H NMR and 13C NMR proved not particularly useful due to the low concentration of Br and C60 at chain ends. It is interesting to note, however, that the 1H NMRs of P3HT-block-PS and P3HT-block-PS-C60 (Fig. 2 and S15,† respectively) are exactly the same, except for minor peaks appearing in the 2–3 ppm region, most likely due to methine and methylene protons at the chain-end close to C60. Clearly, diagnostic evidence for the addition of C60 was found though the UV-visible absorption spectra of P3HT-block-PS and P3HT-block-PS-C60 overlaid in Fig. S16.† Here, we find the characteristic peaks due to P3HT at ca. 520, 550 and 600 nm, and PS at ca. 260 nm,65 with a peak due to C60 only for P3HT-block-PS-C60 at ca. 330 nm.66
DSC was used to find out the effect of the attachment of C60 on the crystallization of P3HT. Fig. S13† indicates the expectedly low Tg at 88 °C for the PS given its low molar mass. Fig. S17† shows the strongly characteristic DSC thermogram of P3HT along with those of P3HT-b-PS, and P3HT-b-PS-C60. There is a clear decrease in melting (Tm) and crystallization temperatures (Tc) in that order due to the macromolecular disruption caused by the PS and then by the PS-C60, as detailed in Table 1.

Optical characterisation of thin films

Fig. 3 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of P3HT-b-PS and P3HT:PCBM (1:1) films with different ratios of P3HT-b-PS cast from o-DCB and annealed at 165 °C for 10 minutes in a glovebox. We notice two absorption bands at 263 and 330 nm that are attributed to PCBM, as observed by Urien et al.,18 while the absorption peaks at 506 and 553 nm are attributed to the absorption bands of P3HT. The intensity of the P3HT absorption band slightly increases with 1 wt% additive, indicating increasing crystallisation. This absorption decreases as the fraction of copolymer additive was further increased, indicative of a small decrease in the optical density of the film and suggests less densely packed polymer chains in the crystalline phase.67 Similarly, Fig. 3(c and d) show the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the additive P3HT-b-PS-C60 alone then as mixed with P3HT:PCBM (1:1) at varying ratios and under similar conditions. We note that the intensity of the PCBM absorption bands (260 and 340 nm) increasing with 0.5 wt% additive, indicating the presence of more PCBM domains, which in turn slightly decrease with increasing the additive concentration. This relation shows a small decrease in the optical density of the film and suggests the formation PCBM aggregates.49,67,68

AFM and TEM characterisation

Fig. 4 presents the AFM phase images showing the effect of the incorporation of various weight ratios of the P3HT-b-PS copolymer on the morphology of thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) films. The best morphology with interpenetrating nanoscale P3HT and PCBM domains has been achieved with 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS diblock copolymer, which corresponds to the positive effect on phase separation with the largest surface area. Further increases in the concentration of P3HT-b-PS copolymer beyond 1 wt% resulted in large sphere-like aggregates on the surface resembling P3HT-b-PS micelles. The strong interaction between PS block and PCBM molecules could make PCBM accumulate within the PS block,36,37 causing a large aggregation of PCBM clusters.35
 Fig. 4  AFM phase images of P3HT:PCBM blends mixed with varying wt% loads of P3HT-b-PS, (all 3 × 3 μm tapping mode of samples annealed at 165 °C, 10 min). 
The TEM images of the P3HT:PCBM films containing various weight ratios of P3HT-b-PS are presented in Fig. 5. These micrographs show that the addition of 1% P3HT-b-PS copolymer in P3HT:PCBM induces extensive crystallization and the formation of interconnected P3HT fibrils. In addition, this enhancement of crystallization of P3HT after annealing at 165 °C for 10 min leads to increased absorption and hole mobilities. This tendency was confirmed by Sun et al. and Yang et al.36,38
 Fig. 5  BF TEM images of P3HT:PCBM with 0, 1, 1.5 and 5 wt% P3HT-b-PS loads (all samples annealed at 165 °C, 10 min). 
To summarize, the AFM and TEM images suggest that the addition of 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS copolymer can control the phase separation between P3HT and PCBM and obtain a more homogeneous film at a microscopic level. Fewer PCBM aggregates are formed when a small weight fraction of the copolymer is added as well as fewer extended P3HT fibrils. These results correlate well with each other and underline the cross-correlation between the agglomeration of PCBM and the formation of P3HT crystallites.

Fig. 6 shows the assembly of four AFM phase images of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) films annealed at 165 °C for 10 minutes with various weight ratios of the P3HT-b-PS-C60 block copolymer. The best apparent morphology of interpenetrating nanoscale P3HT and PCBM domains was achieved at 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 block copolymer, corresponding to the highest interfacial areas. Furthermore, when increasing the ratio of additives (up to 5 wt%), one could observe that the crystalline structure was disrupted by the presence of large aggregates. Bulk morphologies were further investigated using bright field (BF) TEM images of thin films with various ratios of additives (Fig. 7 shows the P3HT:PCBM films with 0, 1, 1.5 and 5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 after annealing at 165 °C, 10 min). When the amount of additive was progressively increased, the nanofibrillar morphology became clear and more defined. The addition of 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 copolymer enhanced the crystallinity of the P3HT-chains in the blend and this enhancement is thought to be responsible for the increased charge transport and reduced bimolecular recombination that is detailed in the following section.20,73

Photovoltaic characterization
We characterised the effect of different amounts of P3HT-b-PS copolymer in P3HT:PCBM (1:1) blends on the performance of photovoltaic devices. The obtained characteristics are reported in Fig. 6 and Table 2 where the variations of open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are observed as the proportion of P3HT-b-PS increases. Representative current density (J)–voltage (V) curves are presented Fig. 8a, and they correspond to the data acquired for the 0, 1, 1.5, and 5 wt% copolymer “doped” solar cells.

 Fig. 8  Photovoltaic characteristics of P3HT:PCBM blended with various wt% of P3HT-b-PS: (top) J–V characteristics; (below) FF, Voc, Jsc, and PCE (%), obtained with as-cast (black) and annealed (red) solar cells. Error bars were calculated from an average over 16 devices. 
When the cells are not annealed, there is a general, if slightly erratic, decrease in cell characteristics as the proportion of P3HT-b-PS increases. However, after thermal treatment, the performance of the devices was found to depend significantly on the amount of P3HT-b-PS copolymer. Without P3HT-b-PS, a PCE of 2.9% was obtained, but with the addition of 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS, the efficiency increased to 3.1%. The best performance was achieved when 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS copolymer was added, i.e. Voc = 0.54 V, Jsc = 11 mA cm−2, FF = 0.61, and PCE of 3.7%. Nevertheless, a further increase in the proportion of P3HT-b-PS decreases efficiency. The FF and Jsc showed sensitivity to variations in the additive concentration (mainly 1 wt%), whereas Voc remained stable at around 0.55 V, as shown in Table 2. It is well known that Jsc is strongly dependent on the absorption intensity as shown in Fig. 3b, which is derived from the crystallinity of P3HT-chains, and the charge transport properties of networks in photovoltaic blend films.69–74 It is therefore apparent that it is the improvement in current with the morphological changes detailed in the prior section that drives the improved device characteristics. It should be noted, however, that many other factors, such as blend ratio, regio-regularity, molar mass, annealing conditions, and additives can strongly affect the orientation of the P3HT chains, the size of PCBM domains and the overall morphology of the thin film.
When increasing the ratio (5 wt%) of the copolymer additive in the P3HT:PCBM blend, the device performance was found to decrease, most likely due to the disruption of P3HT crystallization resulting in a decrease in the population of the face-on oriented P3HT chains.35 Also, the strong interaction between the PS block and PCBM molecules could make PCBM accumulate within the PS block, causing a large aggregation of PCBM clusters.36,37 Furthermore, the presence of insulating PS groups might hinder charge separation and transport.
Turning to P3HT-b-PS-C60, we see that the addition of C60 in the P3HT-b-PS chains permits a slight reduction in the use of additives to obtain even more enhanced results. Current–voltage (J–V) curves under illumination were measured for five photovoltaic devices fabricated from blend films as cast and annealed with different loading ratios of P3HT-b-PS-C60 diblock copolymer (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 wt%). These results are shown in Fig. 9(a and b), from which the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the Voc, the fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are tabulated in Table 3. Again, without annealing the results are not particularly clear, which confirms that the effect is morphologically based: organisation of the devices is required for the effect to be observed. It is interesting to note though that a general descent in values with increasing concentration of additive is not seen, which would tend to indicate that these materials do not contain pernicious impurities that would otherwise act as charge-traps. The performance of the annealed photovoltaic cells was, however, found to depend significantly on the amount of P3HT-b-PS-C60 copolymer dopant. The power conversion efficiency of P3HT:PCBM blends without additives (after thermal annealing) was 3.01%. After adding 0.5 wt% of the copolymer, the efficiency increased by more than 35% mainly due to a higher fill factor. Voc = 0.55 V, Jsc = 12.01 mA cm−2, FF = 0.61, and PCE of 4.01% were achieved. As in the previous PV study, we note the independence of Voc as the block copolymer additive concentration is varied.

The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) curve showing the effectiveness of the cells at varying wavelengths and amounts of copolymers is given in Fig. 10. The highest IPCE was obtained with 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 additive with a maximum IPCE of 70%, which is 5% greater than the maximum IPCE max of the P3HT:PCBM blend formulated with 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS. Both devices exhibited higher IPCEs than the standard P3HT:PCBM devices, correlating well with the JV data. The enhancements of the IPCEs on addition of the copolymers are explained by the increasing interfacial area between donor–acceptor domains leading to increased exciton dissociations and enhancement of charge carrier mobilities. The decreasing IPCEs with overly high amounts of copolymers (e.g. 5 wt%) are responsible for an increased recombination rate due to their large aggregates and a diminished crystalline structure.

Stability studies
The active layer of the organic solar cell is prone to degradation (mainly thermal- and/or photo-oxidation phenomena) and has a direct effect on the loss in both the power conversion efficiency and device lifetime. In addition, the interfacial layer of P3HT:PCBM/Al is vulnerable towards molecular oxygen and water. The primary mechanisms of photo-oxidative degradation are well understood.74,75 Due to the sensitivity of the interface of non-encapsulated normal architecture devices (ITO/PEDOT/active layer/Al) towards molecular oxygen and water, we studied the stability of our devices in a glovebox under nitrogen. After plotting all curves of the reference and formulated devices in Fig. 11 and 12, we demonstrate several interesting trends.

 Fig. 12  Decay curves under illumination of Voc, FF, Jsc and PCE (%) of P3HT:PCBM based devices with varying wt% fractions of P3HT-b-PS-C60. All performed in glove-box under nitrogen. 

Fig. 11 shows studies of the P3HT:PCBM + wt% P3HT-b-PS devices under 1 sun (AM1.5, 50 °C) with normalized values measured under illumination (100 mW cm−2). In the immediate time following illumination, the performance of devices (0 wt% to 5 wt% of P3HT-b-PS) started to decrease slowly. The device with 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS showed the slowest decrease in efficiency with only a 10% loss, whereas the device with 5 wt% P3HT-b-PS decreased by around 40%. However, after 100 h illumination, the best devices (with 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS) started to degrade more rapidly than the reference device which may be attributed to one or more degradation mechanisms taking place.
A different story appears for P3HT-b-PS-C60 as indicated in Fig. 12. After the initial burn-in of the device, we find a near flat-line stability for this material over a long period of time when using the 0.5 wt% copolymer additive. The improvement over the reference devices is derived from the C60 moiety in the additive P3HT-b-PS-C60 which allows for increased donor–acceptor interfaces and reduction of isolated domains created by the polystyrene. Clearly, the addition of small amounts of P3HT-b-PS-C60 in P3HT:PCBM active layers improves the crystallization and stability.
So, to sum up, the addition of small amounts of 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS and 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 in the P3HT:PC60BM BHJs results in an increase in the Jsc allowing the best efficiency of 3.7% and 4%, respectively, which is greater than the reference cell PCE of approximately 3% (while the Voc and FF are similar for all three devices). This can be seen more clearly in the log–log representation of the photocurrent as a function of effective applied voltage, Veff = V0 − V curves, where higher dark injection currents are observed for devices containing additives compared to the neat binary blends. Fig. 13 shows the experimental photocurrent Jph as a function of effective applied voltage (Veff = V0 − V) for P3HT:PCBM containing 0%, 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS, and 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 after 1 h and 1000 h of lifetime. The photocurrent (Jph = JL − JD) is the measured current under illumination (JL) corrected for the dark current (JD), whereas the compensation voltage V0 is defined as the voltage at which the photocurrent Jph is 0. At voltages close to the compensation voltage (V0 − V < 0.1 V), the photocurrent is observed to increase linearly with voltage. For V0 − V > 0.1 V, the photocurrent enters a regime where a square root dependence on the effective voltage is observed. Similar behaviour has been characterized in multiple conjugated polymer fullerene BHJ OPVs, where the decrease in photocurrent for V0 − V > 0.1 V is attributed to recombination effects.76–78 Specifically, the low mobilities or short lifetimes of free carriers (due to either recombination or trapping) are believed to limit the observed photocurrent in polymer solar cells. As seen in Fig. 13, after 1 h under illumination, polymer additives 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS (blue curves up triangle symbol) and 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 (magenta curves, square symbol) consistently yield higher photocurrents in the square root regime (V0 − V > 0.1 V) compared to P3HT:PC60BM reference cells (black curves, circle symbol), thus suggesting that these additives decrease charge recombination. This can be attributed to the nanostructuring of the P3HT:PCBM domain, leading to an increase of the interfacial area between the donor–acceptor phases as well as improved hole transport.
 Fig. 13  Experimental photocurrents after 1 h and 1000 h as a function of Veff for hero cells of: P3HT:PCBM reference (black curves, circular symbol); P3HT:PCBM and 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS (blue curves, triangle symbol); and P3HT:PCBM and 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 (magenta curves, square symbol). 
After 1000 h under illumination in a glovebox, Fig. 11 shows a decreased photocurrent of P3HT:PCBM + 1 wt% P3HT-b-PS over the binary reference cell. This increased charge recombination in the doped active layer is due to decreased mobility and disruption of the nanostructured morphology of the active layer. On the other hand, after 1000 h, the PSC with a P3HT:PCBM + 0.5 wt% P3HT-b-PS-C60 active layer shows a higher stability over the reference cell. This is due to the C60 grafted on the polystyrene side (P3HT-b-PS-C60) of the additives which allows an increase in the donor–acceptor interface by reducing the insulating character of the additive and inducing a preferred active layer morphology. In conclusion, this study has shown that the P3HT-b-PS-C60 copolymer additive is a good approach for obtaining a solar cell with increased performance and stability.
Conclusions
We have discussed the effect of P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 and P3HT-b-PS diblock copolymers as additives on classical P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells which can serve to synergistically improve the power-conversion efficiency and lifetime of photovoltaic solar cells. At optimal concentrations, the block copolymer additives were found to induce favorable active layer morphologies with interpenetrating nanoscale domains, enhance P3HT crystallinity and facilitate holes transport within the active layer. The AFM and TEM characterization of the films provides evidence that the PS segments' affinity with PCBM is a major driving force to control phase separation in P3HT:PCBM blends. As well, the P3HT is inherently attracted to the P3HT block of the copolymer, which leads to improvements in long-range ordering. The results show that the addition of small amounts of the P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 dopant affects the PCBM domain size. Best performances were obtained with a P3HT-b-PS and P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 concentration of 1 wt% and 0.5 wt%, respectively, which we attribute to an increase in miscibility of P3HT and PCBM driven by the copolymer additive. However, the C60 functionalization P3HT-b-PS-b-C60 was by far the most effective way to control phase separation, crystallinity, and to improve donor–acceptor interfacial area within the P3HT:PCBM blends. This resulted in both an enhancement of the performance of the BHJ PSC and an increased lifetime by stabilizing the active layer morphology.
