    , Accepted 22nd February 2016First published on 22nd February 2016AbstractA novel composite nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) based electron-transport layer (ETL) is designed by combining size blended nanoparticles (SBNP) and nanoarrays (NA) for efficient perovskite solar cell (PSC) applications. The composite nanostructured (SBNP + NA) ETL is successfully employed in hole-conductor free PSCs, there by achieving a stable device with a maximum efficiency of 13.5%. The improvement in the performance is attributed to the better charge transport and lower recombination in the SBNP + NA ETL. Despite the stable high efficiency, SBNP + NA ETL based PSCs are advantageous owing to their low cost, ease of all-solution fabrication process in an open environment and good reproducibility.
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite based all-solid solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive investigation due to their rapidly rising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 20%.1–8 In spite of the rising PCE, the low-temperature fabrication process and flexible device technology also make PSCs promising low-cost solar cells.9,10 However, PSCs are still facing challenges including low moisture resistance, thermal and light-soaking instabilities due to their instable typical organic hole-conductor materials and the decomposition of the perovskite absorbers under moisture, heat, or light-soaking environments.11–13 These drawbacks inhibit their viability of commercialization.14 Efforts have been made to solve these problems,12,15–21 the result of the hole-conductor free PSC is one of the good results that achieved a stable PCE under 1000 h light-soaking at a temperature of 80 °C.22 However, the reported PCE of the hole-conductor free PSC still has not been satisfactory (less than 15%) when compared to the typical structure of PSC.
Further, to enhance the performance of the hole-conductor free PSC, we adopted a much simpler structure of the device which employed a novel bi-layer hybrid carbon contact, replacing the porous insulation layer and the porous carbon electrode that may make the infiltration of the perovskite into the thick porous layers difficult. When optimizing the structure of this PSC, the nanostructure of the electron-transport layer (ETL) is found to be germane to the properties of the PSC, not only efficiency but stability,23–27 as the perovskite layer plays two roles of light-harvesting and hole-transport at the same time. Therefore, tailoring of the nanostructure of ETL may pave a way to fabricate high efficiency hole-conductor free PSCs. Several higher order architectures of TiO2 or ZnO nanostructures have been employed in PSCs, such as nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanowires, nanocubes nanorod arrays, etc.,23–27 which have unique advantages i.e. high porosity of nanoparticles, light-scattering of large-sized nanoparticles or electron channels of nanowires. However, a few reports have been found on the composite designs of ETL to make it a suitable one for hole-conductor free PSCs. In the present work, a unique composite nanostructure of TiO2 ETL is designed by combining size-blended (a mixture of large-sized NPs and small sized nanoparticles) nanoparticles (SBNP) and nanoarrays (NA). The composite nanostructured (SBNP + NA) ETL was successfully used in PSCs of MAPbI3 light-harvesting material, and obtained a high PCE of 13.5%. In order to demonstrate the role of SBNP + NA ETL in enhancing the performance of the devices, structural characterization including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), impedance spectroscopy (IS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was carried out. SBNP + NA ETL based PSCs showed better infiltration of MAPbI3, electron transport in ETL and longer electron life-times, which are considered to be leading the improved performance of the device. Apart from the higher efficiency, low cost and ease of all-solution fabrication process in an open environment, the high stability and good reproducibility enhance the viability of SBNP + NA ETL based PSCs for future commercial applications.
As Scheme 1 presents, a thin layer of size-blended nanoparticles (SBNP), which was prepared by mixing traditional hydrothermally prepared nanoparticles (HT) and scattering layer (SL) employed larger-sized nanoparticles, was covered on the NA layer to fabricate our composite nanostructured ETL. Hydrothermal nanoparticles (HT) are commonly used as the ETL not only for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) but also for PSCs due to their high porosity and homogeneity (shown in Fig. 1a).3,28 PSCs employ a very thin (less than 1 μm) HT TiO2 layer that has high transmissivity. Therefore, a part of the light that propagates through the film cannot be harvested by the perovskite. A TiO2 scattering layer which is commonly used in DSSCs, includes large-sized particles of a rutile phase, and is rarely employed in PSCs due to its low-electron mobility and rough surface (Fig. 1c).29 Here, we combined these two kinds of traditional TiO2 nanoparticles by mixing them in a certain ratio of mass to prepare an ETL of high homogeneity and light-scattering ability (shown in Fig. 1b). The density of light-transmission of TiO2 films gradually decreases with the increase of the ratio of the SL paste from 0 to 100%, while the density of light-scattering showed the opposite trend (Fig. 1d). This implies that the addition of SL into a typical HT paste is effective in enhancing the light-scattering of the latter. Further, the mixtures of the pastes were used to fabricate hole-conductor free PSCs using the same assembly process shown in Scheme 1 and their photovoltaic characteristics are displayed in Fig. 1e. The detailed facile method30 of fabrication of MAPbI3 based PSCs is given in the Experimental section (in the ESI†). The performance parameters including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE increase initially and then decline with the increasing mass of the SL paste. The relevant detailed data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The optimal mass ratio of HT/SL is 1:4, with which the SBNP was employed to fabricate the final composite nanostructured ETL.

In hole-conductor free PSCs, the perovskite layer not only plays the role of a light-harvesting material but also the hole-conductor layer, so the optimal thickness of the perovskite layer is found to be greater than that of a typical PSC.3,4,16,17 But the thicker perovskite layer also leads to high charge recombination in hole-conductor free PSCs. Therefore, we introduced charge transport channels by utilizing the nanoarray (NA) structure in our designed ETL.30 For a relative study, hole-conductor free PSCs employing ETL with a similar thickness (about 720 nm) based on the SBNP, pure NA and composite nanostructured SBNP + NA were fabricated. Their cross section SEM images are shown in Fig. 2a–c. The NA structure was prepared by using a simple hydrothermal process method.31 The nanoarray consisted of homogeneous TiO2 nanorods of diameter ∼53 nm with controllable lengths. Fig. 2e shows the typical current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices made up of three kinds of nanostructured ETLs and their performance parameters are listed in Table 1. The J–V plots indicate that the performance of a pure NA based hole-conductor free PSC is poor due to its low specific surface area. After combining the NA with a SBNP nanostructure, the SBNP + NA ETL based device achieved a 118% enhanced PCE from 5.79% to 12.6% (shown in Fig. 2c) when compared with NA based PSCs. This indicates that the present composite nanostructure is better than traditional nanoparticles while being used as the ETL in hole-conductor free PSCs. Compared with SBNP based devices, PSC utilized SBNP + NA composite nanostructures obtained a 12.5% improvement in PCE from 11.2% to 12.6%. The development is mainly due to 5.6% increased Jsc and 6.6% enhanced FF, and is attributed to the composite nanostructure which combines the advantages of high porosity, light-scattering and extra electron transport channels. Besides, this SBNP + NA nanostructure also facilitates PbI2 infiltration and the complete reaction of MAI with PbI2 when compared with a traditional nanoparticle based ETL. The direct evidence is the cross section SEM image of the MAPbI3 loaded SBNP + NA film in Fig. 2d and the XRD result of MAPbI3 loaded SBNP and SBNP + NA in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The SEM result visually shows a tight joint between nanostructured TiO2 and MAPbI3 which indicates that the filling of MAPbI3 into this composite nanostructure is sufficient. The XRD results, which are obtained under the same scanning conditions and with the same thickness of the SBNP and SBNP + NA film, exhibit that the MAPbI3 loaded on SBNP ETL has a low PbI2 peak at 12.6° while the PbI2 peak completely disappears in that of SBNP + NA ETL and the MAPbI3 peak at 14.1° of SBNP + NA showed higher intensity than that of SBNP. This difference resulting from the nanostructure of ETL indicates that the nanoparticle based film is too compact to impede the MAI infiltration and inhibit its complete reaction with PbI2, while the nanoarray based film is in favour of these. This signifies that the present composite nanostructure is beneficial to fabricate high-quality perovskite layers in PSCs.

After careful optimization of devices based on SBNP + NA ETL, we successfully achieved an efficient hole-conductor free PSC with a higher PCE of 13.46%, Voc of 951 mV, Jsc of 20.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.8% as shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1. The spectra of incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) has also been recorded and presented in Fig. 3b. And its corresponding integrated Jsc of 19.9 mA cm−2 was obtained which is in good agreement with the J–V result. To confirm the efficiency of our device, we measured the steady-state current output at the point of maximum power (forward bias of 0.75 V). Our hole-conductor free PSC shows a stable current density of 13.6 mA cm−2 and a corresponding PEC of 10.2% (shown in Fig. 3d). This also suggests that this PSC has good stability when working under light. In order to verify the reproducibility of our device based on SBNP + NA ETL, we fabricated and characterized 50 devices under the same conditions. The PCE distribution of the 50 devices (displayed in Fig. 3c) shows an average PCE of 11.3% (s.d. = 1.12) which implies good reproducibility. Moreover, the long-term stability of SBNP and SBNP + NA ETL based PSCs was measured respectively, when the devices were stored in a room under ambient conditions in the dark without encapsulation for 30 days. From the result shown in Fig. 3e, both of the SBNP and SBNP + NA based devices exhibit very good long-term stability. However, SBNP + NA based devices show stable PCEs even higher than the initial one (about 110%) from the third day, while PCEs of a SBNP based device are slightly lower than their initial value all the time. Therefore, it is obvious that this composite nanostructured ETL is more suitable for the system of the present hole-conductor free PSCs.

All the measurements were carried out under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 simulated irradiation with an active area of 0.068 cm2. 
To clarify the electrochemical properties of PSCs by employing traditional nanoparticles and the composite nanostructure based ETL, impedance spectroscopy (IS) of SBNP and SBNP + NA ETL based devices was carried out under one sun illumination from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with 0.88 V and 0.95 V biases respectively. The results are fitted by a simplified equivalent circuit model (shown in Fig. 4a) which is commonly used in solar cells.32–36 As presented in Fig. 4b and c, both the IS results of devices based on SBNP and SBNP + NA ETL exhibit two semicircles at high and low frequency regions respectively. For typical PSCs, the semicircle at high frequency is commonly associated with the hole-transport process (Rhole) while the semicircle at low frequency is considered to represent the electron transport and recombination process in the ETL or at the ETL/perovskite interface.33,35 However, when the measurement was made under an open-circuit voltage bias, the semicircle at low frequency represents only the electron recombination resistance (Rrec) in the ETL. The corresponding IS parameters are listed in Table 2. A SBNP + NA ETL based PSC showed a lager semicircle at low frequency, which indicates it's higher Rrec compared to SBNP. Thus, there is lower electron recombination in SBNP + NA ETL than in SBNP. This may be attributed to the nanoarray beneath the SBNP + NA that provides electron-transport channels and better contact with the perovskite.23 To support this, the electron lifetime of PSCs based on two kinds of ETLs were estimated from the following equation of the frequency of minimum Z′′ (ωmin) at the low frequency semicircles:37 (1)

As revealed in Table 2, the measured electron lifetime of PSCs based on SBNP + NA is much longer (4.24 ms) than that of the device based on SBNP (2.28 ms), which indicates that the present composite nanostructured ETL can lead to superior charge transport and lower recombination compared with a typical nanoparticle based ETL.
On the other hand, the commonly used open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement was also utilized to study the electron-life time of PSCs based on SBNP and SBNP + NA ETL. The Voc of these PSCs subsequently decay after turning off the illumination in a steady state, and their decay curves are shown in Fig. S2.† The electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated by the following function of decay rate of Voc:38 (2)where κBT is the thermodynamics constant, and e is the electron charge. The calculated electron lifetime curve (Fig. 4d) of SBNP + NA ETL based PSCs is much higher than that of SBNP. This result which is in good agreement with the IS result which proves that the designed composite nanostructure is beneficial for enhancing the charge transport and inhibiting recombination in PSCs. These advantages make our facile fabricated hole-conductor free PSC based on SBNP + NA ETL very promising for future commercial applications.
Conclusions
In order to enhance the performance of hole-conductor free PSCs, a composite nanostructured ETL, by combining a typical nanoparticle ETL, light-scattering layer and nanoarray ETL, is designed. The designed SBNP + NA ETL showed higher porosity than pure nanoarrays, and better charge transport and lower recombination than traditional nanoparticles. Using this composite nanostructured ETL, we obtained stable hole-conductor free PSCs with a high PCE of 13.5%, which can maintain over 100% initial PCE for 30 days. Furthermore, the present hole-conductor free PSCs based on the SBNP + NA ETL has advantages of lower cost, ease of all-solution fabrication process in an open environment, high thermal stability and good reproducibility. Therefore, this kind of device is believed to be very promising for future commercial applications.
