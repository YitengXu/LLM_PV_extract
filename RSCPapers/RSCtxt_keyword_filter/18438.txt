    , Accepted 9th January 2020First published on 29th January 2020AbstractWhite-light emission from the colloidal hybrid electrolyte 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (HMIMBF4)–TiO2(A) is discussed herein. The HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) hybrid electrolyte showed an increase in the lifetime as compared to bare anatase TiO2 (TiO2(A)). The blue emission at 420 nm from HMIMBF4 is attributed to the π–π* transition of the imidazolium moiety, and strong green and yellow emissions at 517 and 568 nm, respectively, are due to defect emissions of TiO2 NPs. In the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) colloidal hybrid electrolyte, the combination of blue emission from the ionic liquid and defect emission from TiO2 NPs produced intense white light. Fabricated HyLEDs showed enhanced device efficiency by the surface modification of rutile TiO2 (TiO2(R)) using HMIMBF4 ionic liquid. HMIMBF4, with a thickness of 250/850 nm, exhibited maximum current efficiency (ηc – cd A−1) of 322.22/361.53, power efficiency (ηp – lm W−1) of 6.2/7.1, external quantum efficiency (ηex – %) of 322.22/361.53 and luminance (ηL – cd m−2) of 70.14/1490.95. Spontaneously aligned dipole polarization within the ionic liquid HMIMBF4 layer reduced the electron injection barrier and led to enhanced device efficiencies.
1. Introduction
The development of optoelectronic materials with multicolor emission has received significant attention in flat-panel displays and biological labeling.1–3 White-light emission is a hot topic of research because white-light-emitting devices (WOLEDs) would drastically reduce global electricity consumption. Organic dyes, lanthanide-doped semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots,4–6 DNA,7 nano dye–polymer conjugates,8 different core–shell materials9 and ZnO NPs with graphene and GaN10 are currently used for white light emission.
Interactions of ionic liquids (IL) with nanomaterials have been widely investigated in the past decade for the development of optoelectronics, batteries, solar cells, etc.11–13 IL prevents NPs aggregation and making them suitable for device fabrication; moreover, colloidal NPs are employed as fillers for composite materials.14,15 Hybrid electrolytes consisting of TiO2 NPs in polyionic liquids show better device performance with higher stability.16 The spherically shaped TiO2 NPs in imidazolium-based ionic liquids can perturb the equilibrium between isolated and associated structures as a consequence of direct interactions of the imidazolium ring with the TiO2 surface.17–19 The synthesis of nanostructures from IL precursors has been widely studied,11,20 however, white-light generation from the anatase TiO2–IL system with higher efficiency has not yet been reported.
Efforts have been made to improve the device efficiency and lifetimes of organic/polymer light-emitting diodes.18–24 Nano ZrO2, ZnO, TiO2, HfO2, etc., are employed as carrier injection/transporting materials in HyLEDs to enhance the efficiency and stability.25–29 However, unbalanced electron–hole recombination lowers device efficiency, which needs to be overcome by reducing the Eg (band gap) through surface modification. The interfacial engineering between the organic semiconductor and inorganic electrode is critical in device efficiency. The work function between the contact layers affects the carrier injection/transportation in organic semiconductors. In HyLEDs, hole-dominated MoO3 is employed as the hole injection layer, hence, electron injection is poor, relative to hole injection, due to large energy barriers between the conduction band (CB) of ZnO (−4.0 eV)29 and the LUMO of active layer poly(phenylvinylene): super yellow (SY) (−2.7 eV),26 resulting in unbalanced charge injection and transport and inefficient electron–hole recombination. These problems lead to the lowering of the fill factor, resulting in the low power conversion efficiency of the devices. Hence, enhancing electron injection/transport at the cathode and reducing incompatibility at the organic active layer, metal oxide interfaces are essential for balancing carrier transport and also reducing the interfacial contact resistance.
The interface between electrodes and the active polymer layer have been carried out by using self-assembled dipole monolayers, lithium fluoride, cesium carbonate, conjugated polyelectrolytes, ionic polymers, etc.30,31 Although these approaches have enhanced the device efficiency, interface engineering was not optimized. Herein, we present a direct method for enhancing device efficiency [the device with HMIMBF4 interfacial layer enhanced the efficiencies: current efficiency (ηc – cd A−1) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53; power efficiency (ηp – lm W−1) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 6.2/7.1; luminance (ηL – cd m−2) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 70.14/1490.95; external quantum efficiency (ηex – %) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53] by surface modification of TiO2(A) using ionic liquid (IL), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (HMIMBF4). Also, we report white-light emission from the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) colloidal hybrid electrolyte. The TiO2(A)–HMIMBF4 shows blue emission around 420 nm due to the π–π* transition, and TiO2(A) with defect state transitions produced green emission at 517 nm; the combination of blue and defect emission results in white emission.
2. Experimental
2.1. Nanocrystalline TiO2(A)
About 1 ml of titanium tetrachloride (1 °C) was added to a flask containing 6 M HCl under stirring; the colloidal dispersion was aged at room temperature and dried at 80 °C (4 h). The colloidal TiO2(A) appeared as light green after aging at 80 °C for 1 h and changed to greenish-yellow after aging overnight at 80 °C (12 h).
2.2. Nanocrystalline TiO2(R)
About 1 ml of titanium isopropoxide in 20 ml isopropyl alcohol was added slowly to 10 ml distilled water and adjusted to pH 2 by 1 M HNO3 for acidic conditions; for basic conditions, 1 M NaOH was used to adjust the pH. The white sol–gel was stirred vigorously at room temperature (4 h) and aged overnight. The solid was centrifuged and re-dispersed in ethanol to reduce agglomeration. The resulting material was dried and calcined at 600 °C (2 h). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that high acidity [pH 2] favored rutile phase formation.32
2.3. 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid (HMIMBF4)
A mixture of 1-methylimidazole (1.92 g, 20 mmol) and 1-hexylbromide (20 mmol) was irradiated under microwave at 40 °C for 20 min; after adding sodium tetrafluoroborate (20 mmol), the resulting mixture was placed under MW at 95 °C (30 min). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and extracted with dichloromethane.33 The liquid product was washed with ether, dried under reduced pressure and characterized by NMR. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ 0.90 (t, 3H), 1.26 (m, 2H), 1.68 (m, 2H), 1.78 (m, 2H), 1.92 (m, 2H), 4.30 (s, 3H), 4.20 (t, 2H), 7.28 (s, 1H), 7.36 (s, 1H), 8.62 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ 11.8, 15.3, 18.9, 21.4, 28.9, 31.8, 32.9, 42.8, 57.0, 122.8, 124.0.
2.4. HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) colloidal hybrid electrolyte
About 0.1 mmol of cationic IL HMIMBF4 was added to TiO2(A) in the CHCl3 dispersion and sonicated for 2 h. The light yellow viscous HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) colloidal hybrid electrolyte was used for white-light generation.
2.5. Characterization methods
The powder X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded with a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα rays at 1.5406 Å with a tube current of 30 mA at 40 kV. The energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) of pristine TiO2(A), TiO2(R) and cationic IL HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) hybrid electrolyte were recorded with a JEOL JSM-5610 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a back-scattered electron (BE) detector. The sample was placed on an adhesive carbon slice supported on copper stubs and coated with 10 nm thick gold using a JEOL JFC-1600 auto fine coater prior to measurement. TEM analysis was carried out using a JEOL JEM 2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) at 200 kV. The fluorescence lifetime was measured with nanosecond time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer Horiba Fluorocube-01-NL lifetime system with nano LED (pulsed diode excitation source) as the excitation source and TBX-PS as the detector. The UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter, respectively. The absolute quantum yield (PLQY) was determined with a Model-F7100 fluorescence spectrometer. The PL quantum yield was calculated in dichloromethane with a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution of quinine (0.54) as the reference, using the following equation:  where ϕunk and ϕstd are the radiative quantum yields, and Iunk and Istd are the integrated emission intensities of the sample and standard, respectively. Aunk and Astd are the absorbances of the sample and standard, respectively and ηunk and ηstd are the refractive indexes of the sample and standard solution, respectively. The solid-state quantum yield was measured on a quartz plate using an integrating sphere.
2.6. Device fabrication
The fabricated hybrid devices have the following configuration: (i) FTO/TiO2/F8BT/MoO3/Au; (ii) FTO/TiO2:HMIMBF4/F8BT/MoO3/Au; (iii) FTO/TiO2:SADM-CN/F8BT/MoO3/Au; and (iv) FTO/TiO2:SADM-OCH3/F8BT/MoO3/Au. FTO is the transparent cathode, HMIMBF4/SADM is surface-modified layer for TiO2(A), F8BT is the emissive layer, MoO3 is the hole transport layer and Au is the anode. The TiO2 surface was modified with ionic liquid HMIMBF4. The 80 nm thick TiO2 was spin-coated at 5000 rpm onto FTO, then annealed at 100 °C (15 min). The ionic liquid (HMIMBF4) dissolved in water (0.1 wt%) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm onto the TiO2 layer, then annealed at 120 °C (20 min) to remove residual water (for comparison, the TiO2 surface was modified with 7 mM SADM in ethanol solution). The 100 nm thick F8BT emissive layer was spin-cast from 20 mg ml−1p-xylene solution onto the TiO2:HMIMBF4/SADM surface and then annealed at 165 °C (1 h) under a nitrogen atmosphere.34 The 10 nm thick MoO3 layer and 60 nm thick Au layer were subsequently evaporated on the F8BT layer to complete the device fabrication.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of nanomaterials and the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) hybrid electrolyte

Fig. 1 displays the X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of anatase (A) and rutile (R) phases of TiO2 along with the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) hybrid electrolyte. The diffraction patterns of TiO2(R) (a = b = 3.7774 Å and c = 9.501 Å) and TiO2(A) (a = b = 3.785 Å and c = 9.513 Å) match the JCPDS pattern, body-centered tetragonal structure (89-4920) and (21-1272), respectively. The XRD pattern of TiO2(R) exhibited diffraction peaks at 22.49°, 39.28°, 44.14°, 48.14°, 54.44°, 64.20°, 69.96°, 72.59° and 76.72°, corresponding to the (110), (200), (210), (204), (211), (310), (112), (311) and (202) planes, respectively, indicating the rutile phase. The XRD peaks at 25.28°, 38.58°, 48.05°, 53.894°, 55.06°, 62.76°, 68.76°, 70.31° and 75.03° indicate that TiO2 exists in the anatase phase with the corresponding (101), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (105) planes, respectively. The average crystallite sizes (L) of TiO2(R) and TiO2(A) were deduced to be 17.97 and 17.90 nm, respectively, which were obtained from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense peak using the Scherrer equation:L = 0.9λ/βcosθwhere λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, θ is the diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half maximum of the peak. The specific surface area of the nanocrystals was determined from the equationS = 6/ρDwhere S is the specific surface area and ρ is the material density. The calculated surface areas of TiO2(R) and TiO2(A) were 58.88 and 59.18 m2 g−1, respectively. The XRD diffraction peaks of the cationic HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) hybrid electrolyte were indexed to the body centered tetragonal structure (21-1272): HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) showed excellent phase purity and the broadening of peaks demonstrated the presence of small crystallites.

The transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of pristine TiO2(A) and TiO2(R) and the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) electrolyte are displayed in Fig. 2. The TEM images confirm that they are nanoparticles and are approximately spherical in shape with size of ∼18 nm [TiO2(R) and TiO2(A)] and 22 nm [HMIMBF4–TiO2(A)]. Although the particle sizes determined by TEM are slightly larger than those calculated from powder XRD, the values are in good agreement within the frame of error. The rings in the SAED image fit the tetragonal structure and the TEM image shows clear fringes with spacings of 0.29 nm and 0.31 nm corresponding to the (110) and (101) planes of tetragonal TiO2(R), TiO2(A) and HMIMBF4–TiO2(A), respectively. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of bare TiO2(R), TiO2(A) and cationic HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) are displayed in Fig. 3. The EDX spectra of cationic HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) show the presence of carbon and nitrogen and this confirms the binding of HMIMBF4 with TiO2.

The FTIR spectra of bare TiO2(A), HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks around 1115, 1481 and 1601 cm−1 are attributed to [HMIM]+ and the band at 1058 cm−1 is attributed to [BF4]−.35 The peak at around 3406 cm−1 of HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) is attributed to water molecules and the OH stretching mode appeared in the range of 3406–2987 cm−1. The weak absorption near 1650 cm−1 is associated with the deformation vibration of the H–O–H bond from physisorbed water. The peak at 1210 cm−1 is due to metal–carbonyl linkage caused by the adsorption of CO from the atmosphere.36 The broad peak in the range of 1000–700 cm−1 is due to the overlapping of the Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti stretching modes.37
3.2. Thermal and optical properties
The thermal stability of HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2 was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) over the temperature range 0–600 °C under N2, heating at 10 °C min−1. Both HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2 exhibited no weight loss below 450 °C. The weight loss was seen around 450–500 °C, corresponding to the degradation of the ionic liquid; the coordinative interactions between HMIMBF4 and TiO2 were not enough to affect the thermal stability of the HMIMBF4–TiO2 hybrid electrolyte. Literature reports37 reveal that the thermal stability of imidazolium-based ionic liquids depends more on the anion as compared to the cation, hence, weight loss was seen at around 450–500 °C. HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2 exhibited maximum thermal stability as evidenced by their decomposition temperatures (Td): HMIMBF4 – 450 °C and HMIMBF4–TiO2 – 500 °C.37 The high Td prevented the decomposition of these materials during vacuum deposition, which also indicated the high resistance of the imidazole ring to thermolysis, and this could enhance the device lifetime (Fig. 3).
The DRS of both anatase and rutile TiO2 are presented in terms of F(R) deduced from the reflectance (R) by the Kubelka–Munk algorithm [F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R]. The absorption edge of TiO2(R) was 392 nm and that of TiO2(A) was 332 nm (Fig. 4). The band gaps of TiO2(A) and TiO2(R) were larger than the reported values because of the smaller size of the nanocrystals; the quantum confinement effect increased the band gap energy.33Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of HMIMBF4 in the CHCl3 and HMIMBF4–TiO2 dispersion. The absorption spectrum of HMIMBF4 revealed that the presence of the pronounced peak at 285 nm is due to the π–π* transition of the imidazolium ring and the weak tail above 300 nm is attributed to the presence of different associated structures of the imidazolium ring whose formation is due to electrostatic interactions among the π orbitals.20,38,39 The long tail is due to the energy structure of the cation as well as the spatial arrangement of the anion. The absorption spectrum of the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) dispersion was dominated by a strong absorption of TiO2 NPs that overwhelms the IL contribution. The absorbance increased and a tail appeared in the visible region, which was expected to increase the efficiency. The improvement of the optical absorption of HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) in the visible region is associated with the synergistic effect of the two main components (TiO2 and HMIMBF4). The tail was detectable in the absorption spectra of different concentrations of solutions of TiO2 NPs in CHCl3 and can be attributed to scattering phenomena induced by the large number of inorganic nanoparticles.39
 Fig. 4  (a) DRS spectra of TiO2(A) and TiO2(R). (b) Absorption spectra of bare HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2(A). (c) Emission spectra of TiO2(A) and TiO2(R). 

Fig. 4 displays the solid-state photoluminescence spectra of TiO2(A) and TiO2(R) excited at 340 nm. The rutile TiO2 sample shows emissions at 380 and 400 nm; the former corresponds to the band gap emission and the latter is due to crystal defects. The solid emission of TiO2(R) and TiO2(A) consists of five emission bands: a strong violet emission at 415 nm (2.99 eV), a blue band at 450 nm (2.76 eV), a blue-green band at 476 nm (2.61 eV), a weak green band at 522 nm (2.31 eV) and yellow emission at 573 nm (2.14 eV). The two peaks at 476 and 522 nm are attributed to the transitions of two trapped electrons and one trapped electron from oxygen vacancies to the valence band (VB) of TiO2, respectively. The energy levels related to the two kinds of oxygen vacancies are located at 0.89 and 1.18 eV below the CB of TiO2, respectively. Because of the existence of the energy levels of oxygen vacancies, photogenerated electrons in the CB are likely to reach the oxygen vacancies through non-radiative processes and then recombine with photogenerated holes in the VB accompanied by fluorescence. The broad band in the visible region 450–476 nm (2.76–2.60 eV) is ascribed to the radiative recombination of excitons of shallow traps identified with oxygen vacancies and Ti4+ adjacent to oxygen vacancies.33
The presence of IL HMIMBF4 in the HMIMBF4–TiO2 hybrid electrolyte was confirmed by PL measurements (Fig. 4): TiO2 NPs do not contribute to fluorescence since TiO2 is a wide and indirect bandgap semiconductor that does not recombine radiatively. HMIMBF4 IL exhibited two-component emission: the imidazolium ionic liquid showed feeble emission in the range of 330–360 nm (short excitation wavelengths), whereas, when excited at higher wavelength, a second prominent emission corresponding to the tail part of the absorption appeared as a shoulder for the short excitation wavelength. The shift in the emission maximum toward longer wavelengths with the increase in the excitation wavelength is interesting. Emission was also observed when excitation was greater than 400 nm, where the absorption due to HMIMBF4 is insignificant. The earlier control experiments confirmed that (i) the imidazolium ion is fluorescent, (ii) the short wavelength emission is due to the monomeric form of the imidazolium ion and (iii) the long wavelength emission is due to its various associated forms (Fig. 5).39 However, the shift in the emission peak with excitation wavelength, called the red-edge effect, is inconsistent with Kasha's rule39 of excitation wavelength independence of emission. Although the nature of the shift may appear somewhat similar to the Raman band, the broad emission and mismatch between the shifts of the emission maximum with the excitation wavelength rule out this possibility. Therefore, it was deduced that this emission was observed when the excitation was made at the tail of the absorption band. The long tail absorption of the imidazolium ionic liquid HMIMBF4 is due to various energetically different associated species involving both the imidazolium cation and constituting anion.39

The liquid-state structure of HMIMBF4 is not fully understood, however, structures with short- and long-range spatial correlations of cation–anion and cation–cation pairs (associated forms) have been analyzed by both experimental and computer simulation studies.38,40 Anions may be located above and below the imidazolium plane; the existence of multiple structures or finding an anion in the vicinity of a cation and vice versa, are expected to broaden the energy states of the absorbing species, leading to a long tail. The computer simulation studies indicated the existence of spatially different environments in ionic liquids,38,40 which implies that the broadening of the distribution of energetically different associated species is due to this heterogeneity. Each associated species is characterized by λabs and λemi maxima; when the excitation wavelength is changed, different species are excited and the emission characteristics of that corresponding species are observed. The long-wavelength emission band arises upon the excitation of different associated structures, which comprise the long absorption tail of the ionic liquid; this also evident from the effects of dilution on the emission spectra.40
The PL spectrum of HMIMBF4 IL shows two distinct components at higher and at lower energy that can be ascribed to isolated and associated imidazolium ions, respectively:38–40 HMIMBF4 was dispersed in different polar solvents to clarify the dissociation and association forms. HMIMBF4 is completely soluble in acetonitrile but partially soluble in CHCl3 (Fig. 5). This result has also been supported by dynamic light scattering measurements (Fig. 5). DLS experiments were carried out on HMIMBF4 in CHCl3 and ACN. The average size of 18 nm was obtained from 12 replicates of HMIMBF4 in CHCl3 solution, which is consistent with the associated form in apolar solvent. No signal was detected in CAN, which implies that no associations were identified in ACN. The PL spectrum of pure HMIMBF4 IL showed emission at about 445 nm due to the isolated imidazolium ion. On dilution with ACN, the PL spectrum was dominated by isolated ions at higher energy. Such a contribution completely disappeared when HMIMBF4 IL was diluted with CHCl3, and its PL spectrum showed only the emission band at lower energy, typical of associated forms due to weak van der Waals interactions among the long hexyl chains, which led to the formation of polar and apolar domains. Such behavior could be ascribed to the affinity of CHCl3 for the apolar portion of HMIMBF4, favoring the associated structures. Hence, the ionic liquid global emission is the sum of the contribution from the isolated form and the associated/stacked form. When the associated structure of the ionic liquid does not dominate, the emission spectra reveal the presence of the isolated form. The equilibrium between the isolated and associated imidazolium structures is controlled by the molecular structure of the ions, solvents and temperature. The solvent polarity can tune the equilibrium between the isolated and associated forms. The ionic liquid in apolar solvents (chloroform) leads to the associated/stacked form of the imidazolium ring, whereas polar solvents (acetonitrile) dissociate the aggregates.40 The PL spectra at different excitation wavelengths of HMIMBF4 (CHCl3) are shown in Fig. 4. The broad emission at longer wavelength moved to lower energies on increasing the excitation wavelength. The broad band is attributed to the radiative recombination of the aggregated form in the excited state, whereas no signal was detected from the isolated imidazolium ion. The shift in the emission peak with excitation wavelength is called the red-edge effect (REE), where emission occurs from different energy levels with the fluorescence decay rate being faster than the energy transfer rate.20,38,39 In IL, REE is due to the associated structure emitting from distinct energy states. The absence of the emission peak associated with the isolated imidazolium ion is due to the chloroform medium, which promotes the associated/stacked form.39 The wide emission band of HMIMBF4 with REE was also observed in HMIMBF4–TiO2(A). The shape of the emissive peak was unmodified by NPs, thus, allowing us to rule out the alkyl chain effect. The maximum emission intensity of HMIMBF4 in the presence of TiO2 NPs was observed.
The PL decay of bare HMIMBF4 and HMIMBF4–TiO2 showed triexponential functions (Fig. 5) and average lifetimes of 8 ns and 14 ns, respectively. The average lifetime depends on the permanent time of the carriers with the number of de-excitation pathways. The energy transfer between HMIMBF4 and TiO2 may be responsible for increasing the lifetime of HMIMBF4–TiO2. Since the only photoluminescent component of HMIMBF4 is the imidazolium moiety, the modification in the PL decay was induced in HMIMBF4–TiO2, which revealed that charge transfer took place between HMIMBF4 and the photoexcited TiO2.40
3.3. White-light emission from the HMIMBF4–TiO2(A) colloidal electrolyte
To gain more insight into the mechanism of the white-light emission from the photoexcited HMIMBF4–TiO2 hybrid electrolyte, different relaxation processes and the position and distribution of the HOMO (−8.24 eV) and LUMO (−1.37 eV) of the IL HMIMBF4 are shown in Fig. 6. The three different energy states of the imidazole moiety of the ionic liquid HMIMBF4 are the non-bonding state (n), bonding state (π) and the antibonding state (π*), and there are two types of transitions, namely, n–π* and π–π*.40 However, due to the lower availability of the non-bonding electrons, the π–π* transition is more dominant. HMIMBF4 IL showed narrow emission at 420 nm when the imidazolium ring formed the associated structure.40 It is interesting to note that the photoluminescence properties of the ionic liquid are excitation-dependent and the emission band shifted towards higher wavelength on increasing the wavelength of excitation.40 In TiO2 NPs, some O2− ions that escaped from host lattice led to the formation of oxygen vacancies. This oxygen vacancy centre can trap an electron, resulting in the formation of defect states;40 the valence band (VB), defect states and conduction band (CB) are the three energy levels for TiO2 NPs. Upon photoexcitation, the TiO2 NPs created positive holes in the VB and negative electrons in the CB. The holes in the VB can be trapped at the oxygen vacancy sites. The surface-trapped hole then tunnels back into the particle to recombine with an electron to form the  centre at the surface of the particle. The recombination of this centre with an electron in the CB gave rise to trap emission of visible green light at 517 and yellow light at 568 nm.40 Therefore, the HMIMBF4–TiO2 hybrid electrolyte showed strong emission bands at 420 nm, 517 nm and 568 nm. The blue emission from HMIMBF4, and green and yellow emissions from TiO2(A) NPs were combined together to give an intense white light emission with CIE(0.47, 0.32). There was no change in the emission peak position of HMIMBF4 after the addition of TiO2(A) NPs but the peak position due to TiO2(A) NPs was found to be blue-shifted by 5 nm. This may be attributed to the modification of the surface defects of TiO2(A) NPs by HMIMBF440 (Fig. 6). Charge-transfer also occurred from HMIMBF4 to the TiO2(A) and it was confirmed by time-resolved decay time analysis of HMIMBF4.

3.4. Fabrication of devices
The hybrid devices were fabricated by the successive deposition of FTO as the transparent cathode, HMIMBF4/SADM as the surface modifying layer for TiO2(R), F8BT as the emissive layer, MoO3 as the hole injection layer and Au as the anode. HMIMBF4, consisting of a negative dipole, was used as the interfacial layer for hydroxyl-terminated metal oxides. The carboxylic acid-based SADM, consisting of negative and positive dipoles due to the electron donating (–OCH3) and electron-withdrawing (–CN) groups, was used as an interfacial modifier for hydroxyl-terminated metal oxides. A uniform SADM layer was formed on the TiO2 surface via covalent bonding of –CO2H of SADM with –OH of TiO2.
The surface analyses of the FTO/TiO2 (2.9 nm), FTO/TiO2:HMIMBF4 (4.0 nm) and FTO/TiO2:SADM (OCH3) (4.4) devices were made via topographic images (Fig. 5), which show the uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles on the FTO anode. The root mean square (RMS) showed that the monodisperse metal NPs are beneficial for OLEDs. If there is agglomeration between the nanoparticles, the absorption moves away from the visible region. The TiO2:F8BT interface has a significant electron injection barrier (1.2 eV) as compared to the MoO3:F8BT interface (0.7 eV), which leads to an unbalanced electron and hole injection. The TiO2:F8BT interface was modified by a buffer layer such as HMIMBF4 or SADM. The presence of adequate molecular dipoles at the TiO2:F8BT interface plays a key role in enhancing the charge injection. The SADM has two types of dipole moment (μ): (i) the SADM OCH3-generated dipole moment in the device points away from the TiO2 surface; (ii) the SADM CN-induced dipole moment points toward the TiO2 surface (Fig. 7). The deposition of the charged IL, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, between TiO2 and the emissive layer F8BT induced spontaneous dipolar polarization within the layer (Fig. 7), while the hydrophilic BF4− anion preferred the inorganic TiO2 interface and the hydrophobic HMIM+ cation preferred the organic F8BT interface. This spontaneous dipole polarization was stabilized by the annealing process.16,41 If the dipoles within HMIMBF4 are directed away from the TiO2 surface, there is an upward shift in the vacuum level of TiO2 and thereby, the band edge of TiO2 shifts closer to the energy level of F8BT (Fig. 7); therefore, the resultant TiO2 work function with the electron injection barrier will decrease. The SADMOCH3 modified TiO2 layer with the negative dipole reduced the electron injection barrier.11,18 The difference between HMIMBF4 and SADM OCH3 is that the self-aligned dipole polarization of the ionic liquid arises due to the self-aligned distribution of ions within the layer and the dipole polarization effect of ions on the work function of the TiO2 layer is expected to be higher than that of SADM. All the devices exhibited green emission with enhanced efficiency (Fig. 8).

The direction of the dipole moment generated by HMIMBF4 or SADM changes the work function of TiO2,17  where N is the surface density of the molecules, μn is the molecular dipole moment normal to the surface, ε is the dielectric constant of HMIMBF4 or SADM and ε0 is the permittivity of free space. The dielectric constant (μ) of aromatic molecules is assumed to be 5.3 D. The sign of μn depends on the direction of the dipole. The negative dipole (μn < 0) indicates that the dipole moment points away from the TiO2 surface, whereas the positive dipole (μn > 0) corresponds to the dipole moment pointing toward the TiO2 surface. The surface coverage (N) is also a key parameter in determining the magnitude of ΔΦ.13 A dipole moment pointed away from TiO2 would shift the band edge of TiO2 closer to the vacuum level of F8BT. The work function of TiO2 and the electron injection barrier would decrease as compared to those without HMIMBF4 or SADM interface modification. In contrast, a dipole moment pointing toward the TiO2 surface would shift the band edge of TiO2 away from the vacuum level of F8BT, leading to an increase in work function, which in turn would increase the electron injection barrier. Park et al.29 reported that negative and positive dipoles effectively lowered and raised the work function of a semiconductor, respectively. The device performances were evaluated by current density and luminance versus applied voltage (J–V–L) measurements under atmospheric conditions without further encapsulation. All the devices exhibited the original green emission of F8BT, in spite of HMIMBF4 or SADM interfacial modification. The device with TiO2/HMIMBF4/F8BT exhibited low current density (J) because of the reduced leakage current and significantly enhanced device efficiencies due to the enhanced recombination of electrons and holes inside the emissive layer.
The unmodified device with pristine TiO2 had a luminance of 1760 cd m−2, current efficiency (ηc) of 1.8 cd A−1, and external quantum efficiency (ηex) of 0.9% at 3.0 V with an optimized active layer thickness of 250 nm. The device with HMIMBF4-modified TiO2 greatly enhanced the efficiency at a low turn-on voltage (Table 1) as compared to the efficiency of the unmodified device. The device with TiO2/HMIMBF4/F8BT (250/850 nm) showed maximum efficiencies (ηc – 11/20.0 cd A−1; ηp – 6.2/7.1 lm W−1; ηex – 3.8/6.0%; L – 29960/30268 cd m−2 at 2.4 V). The low turn-on voltage of devices with the HMIMBF4 layer confirmed that the electron injection barrier was greatly reduced between TiO2:HMIMBF4. The self-assembled and permanent interfacial dipole at the TiO2:HMIMBF4 interface shifted the vacuum level at that interface.

The device with interfacial modification by the negative dipole SADMOCH3 enhanced the HyLEDs performances at low turn-on voltage, whereas the device modified with the positive dipole (SADMCN) showed significant deterioration of the device efficiency (Fig. 8). The device with the TiO2/SADM (–OCH3/–CN) layer exhibited device efficiencies as follows: ηc – 2.0/0.006 cd A−1; ηp – 0.6/0.0001 lm W−1; ηex – 1.0/0.3%; L – 20820/20 cd m−2 at 2.9/3.3 V. As observed in the J–V–L characteristics, the negative dipole reduced the injection barrier and promoted the electron transportation and injection within HyLEDs. The upper limit of ηex (5%) was calculated from ηex = ηout × ηrc × ηγ × ΦPL, where ηout is the light-out-coupling efficiency (20%), ηrc is the product of the charge recombination efficiency (100%), ηγ is the efficiency of radiative exciton production (25%) and ΦPL is the photoluminescence quantum yield (100%).42,43ηex was experimentally determined to be 6% from the TiO2/HMIMBF4/F8BT device with an active layer thickness of 850 nm. Two possible explanations for the high ηex of TiO2/HMIMBF4/F8BT are as follows: (i) ηs attributed to electrical injection was higher than 25% because of triplet–triplet annihilation44,45 and singlet formation in the cross-section of F8BT;46 (ii) enhanced light extraction.
The exciton lifetimes of TiO2/F8BT, TiO2/SADM-OCH3/F8BT and TiO2/HHIMBF4/F8BT (250/850 nm) were 1.62/1.71, 1.52/1.61 and 1.38/1.42 ns, respectively (Fig. 5). The exciton lifetime of TiO2/HHIMBF4/F8BT was significantly shorter than the control device because of high surface roughness, which caused considerable exciton quenching. The exciton lifetime increased with increasing thickness, resulting in reduced exciton quenching. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TiO2/F8BT, TiO2/SADM OCH3/F8BT and TiO2/HHIMBF4/F8BT (250/850 nm) were measured to support the reduction of exciton quenching. The EL intensities of TiO2/HHIMBF4/F8BT (850 nm) were higher as compared to other devices (Fig. 8). The EL results are in agreement with the lifetime, which supports the reduced exciton quenching. Therefore, it was concluded that the HHIMBF4 interlayer on TiO2 was effective for enhancing the electrical and optical properties of HyLEDs as indicated by the J–V–L characteristic curves, lifetime and external quantum efficiency.47
The device efficiency with the interfacial layer HMIMBF4 was enhanced. Current efficiency (ηc – cd A−1) (250/850 nm): (i) HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53; (ii) SADM-OCH3: 11.11/69.23. Power efficiency (ηp – lm W−1) (250/850 nm): (i) HMIMBF4: 6.2/7.1; (ii) SADM-OCH3: 0.6/3.5. Enhanced luminance, (ηL – cd m−2) (250/850 nm): (i) HMIMBF4: 70.14/1490.95; (ii) SADM-OCH3: 18.23/1080.86. External quantum efficiency, (ηex – %) (250/850 nm): (i) HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53; (ii) SADM-OCH3: 11.11/69.23. The interlayer enhanced the electron injection and hole blocking in addition to reducing exciton quenching between TiO2/HMIMBF4 and the emissive layer F8BT. The fabricated HyLED efficiencies confirmed that the ionic dipoles were spontaneously self-aligned at the TiO2:HMIMBF4 interface, which reduced the electron injection barrier and enhanced the device efficiencies (Fig. 9).

4. Conclusion
We have demonstrated white-light generation from the HMIMBF4–TiO2 colloidal hybrid electrolyte. Upon photoexcitation, the π–π* transition of the HMIMBF4 ionic liquid produced blue light and the transition between the electrons in the CB and holes trapped in defect states of TiO2(A) exhibited green emission. The combination of blue and defect resulted in white-light emission. We fabricated devices with increased efficiency by the interfacial modification of the TiO2 and F8BT layers using HMIMBF4 IL. Ionic dipole polarization effectively influenced the electron injection barrier between the CB of TiO2 and the LUMO of the active layer and remarkably enhanced the electron injection and transportation, leading to enhanced efficiencies. The device with the HMIMBF4 interfacial layer enhanced the efficiencies: current efficiency (ηc – cd A−1) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53; power efficiency (ηp – lm W−1) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 6.2/7.1; luminance (ηL – cd m−2) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 70.14/1490.95; external quantum efficiency (ηex – %) (250/850 nm): HMIMBF4: 322.22/361.53. Spontaneously aligning the dipole polarization with the IL HMIMBF4 layer reduced the electron transfer barrier and enhanced the device efficiencies. This interfacial engineering proposes a new design scheme for carrier injection and transfer for optoelectronic devices.
