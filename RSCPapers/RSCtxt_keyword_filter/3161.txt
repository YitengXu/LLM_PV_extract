    , Accepted 1st September 2022First published on 1st September 2022AbstractDesigning counter electrodes (CEs) with high efficiency and understanding the mechanism of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are still challenges. In this paper, we synthesized K-doped molybdenum disulfide (K-MoS2) with few layers and it has a great enhancement effect on the electrocatalytic activity compared to pure MoS2 CE and reference Pt CE. A dual electron-path model is proposed to explain the mechanism, which is supported by first-principles calculations. When an electron in MoS2 is transferred to the triiodide, the K atoms can act as an electron reservoir to provide another electron in a short time to improve the catalytic activity. So the proposed dual-electron effect in this paper is helpful to understand the charge transfer mechanism on the interfaces of these CEs and may be crucial for obtaining high photoelectric efficiencies in DSSCs.
The utilization of solar cells is a global priority to alleviate the energy crisis and reduce environmental pollution. Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1–4 have attracted much attention due to their simple and low-cost fabrication, stability and environmental friendliness, and thus exhibit high potential for industrial applications. Fig. 1 demonstrates the schematic overview of a DSSC. In the DSSC, dye molecules absorb the photon energy to transition to an excited state and inject electrons into a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, while the electrolyte is responsible for ion transmission and promoting the regeneration of the dye molecules. Besides the mesoporous TiO2 anode, dye and electrolyte, the CE is also an important component of DSSCs. The specific function of the CE in the DSSC is to collect electrons from the external circuit and transfer them to the redox couple in the electrolyte to realize the regeneration of the dye molecules. In order to achieve a high-efficiency DSSC device, the ideal CE material not only needs to have excellent conductivity, but also needs to have good catalytic activity for the redox reaction. At present, various materials have attracted extensive attention as promising CE candidates, such as platinum (Pt),5,6 carbon materials,7–10 conductive polymers,11–13 transition metal chalcogenides,14–16 oxides,17 nitrides,18,19 composite materials,20–22 alloys,23–25etc.
Although new high-efficiency CE materials are still emerging, a full understanding of the catalytic mechanisms is still lacking. For example, it is generally believed that the high efficiency of CE comes from its low charge transfer resistance (Rct ≤ 1.0 Ω cm2).9,26,27 However, contradictions are also shown in many works leading to confusion and thus a lack of consensus. For instance, some CEs have extremely low Rct but only a small performance improvement,28,29 while some have larger Rct (>10 Ω cm2) but higher catalytic efficiency.7,30–36 This shows that the low Rct cannot appropriately account for the high efficiency of the CE material. Despite these confusing behaviors of CEs, an agreement has been reached on the reduction process occurring on the electrode surface, i.e., I3− + 2e− → 3I− in the DSSC system with iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) as the redox pair.26 It is hoped that this chemical formula can offer some clues to understanding the mechanism and inspiration for the efficiency-improvement of CEs. In this reaction, the reduction of I3− requires two electrons. Thus, a catalytic site that has the advantage of offering two electrons quickly will be helpful to accelerate the reaction. As one of the typical systems, in the electron-doped CE, the doped atom may act as a high-efficiency electron donor. When an electron is lost on the surface of the CE, it can be quickly replenished from the doped atom, forming a dual-electron catalytic enhancement effect to improve the electrocatalytic activity.
Aiming at this role, we selected K-doped molybdenum disulfide (K-MoS2) few layers as the typical instance and studied the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the DSSC with K-MoS2 as its CE. In Fig. 1, we highlight the K-MoS2 CE and demonstrate the schematic diagram of the dual-electron path model to illustrate the dynamic mechanism on its interface. The proposed dual-electron model with electron injection from the doped K atoms will significantly facilitate the reducing reaction, which is also supported by first-principles calculations. Therefore, this dual-electron transfer effect is helpful to understand the catalytic mechanism on the CEs and to obtain ideal CEs with high photoelectric efficiency.
 Fig. 1  The schematic overview of a dye-sensitized solar cell. It contains a mesoporous TiO2 anode, an iodide/triiodide electrolyte and a CE. The reduction of triiodide requires two electrons in which K-doping can provide an extra electron to speed up the reducing process. 
To synthesize the CEs, K-doped few layer MoS2 was deposited on KOH-treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by sputtering a MoS2 target in pulsed laser deposition (PLD), or sulfurizing spin-coated ammonium molybdate by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S1, ESI†), compared with the FTO surface with uniform brightness (Fig. S1a, ESI†), the surface of the K-MoS2 film (Fig. S1b, ESI†) shows different contrasts with light and dark distributions. The part with rather dark area represents the existence of the MoS2 film. Besides, the morphology of the FTO substrate is still clearly visible, indicating that the thickness of MoS2 is very small. In the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, the survey spectrum of K-MoS2 illustrates that the film contains Mo, S, K, Sn, O and C atoms only (Fig. 2(a)). It is noted that Sn and O elements come from the FTO substrate, while the C 1s signal is used to correct the peaks (the charge effects). The remaining Mo, S and K elements come from the K-MoS2 film. In the Mo 3d spectrum (Fig. 2(b)), the peaks at 235.3, 232.0 and 228.5 eV correspond to Mo6+, Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, respectively. The peak at 225.8 eV was assigned to S 2s. The S 2p spectrum of the film exhibits two main peaks at 163.3 and 161.2 eV (Fig. 2(c)), which correspond to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively. In Fig. 2(d), which shows the XPS data of K 2p, they also fit well with the two peaks of K in the 2p orbit at 292.9 eV and 295.7 eV, indicating that K+ does exist on the film surface due to the spin-orbit coupling effect, indicating that K+ is incorporated into the samples. According to the peak area, the film can be measured with a molar ratio of K:Mo = 0.094:1. So far, we can determine that there is a small amount of K between the FTO substrate and the deposited MoS2 film.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that there is a MoS2 thin film grown on the FTO surface (Fig. S2, ESI†). The film thickness can be further determined by the high-resolution image (Fig. S2c, ESI†), which is about 2–4 layers. The measured interlayer spacing is 0.62 nm (inset of Fig. S2c, ESI†), which is consistent with the reported value of MoS2. Moreover, three diffraction rings can be clearly seen in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, corresponding to (101), (103) and (110) crystal planes of MoS2, respectively (Fig. 2(b)). The Raman (Fig. S3, ESI†) peak positions of raw FTO and the K-MoS2 decorated one show no significant difference. The two characteristic peaks located at 386 and 408.5 cm−1 correspond to E12g and A1g vibration modes of the 2H phase of MoS2, respectively. The frequency difference between these two vibration modes is 22.5 cm−1, which agrees well with the reported value for a MoS2 film within 5 layers37,38 and is also consistent with the above TEM results.
To study the electrocatalytic activity, the performance of DSSCs was analysed using K-MoS2 and MoS2 thin films as CE materials, separately. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curves of the solar cells synthesized by different methods, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† From Fig. 3, the open circuit voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of K-MoS2 are higher than those of pure MoS2. For the films prepared by the CVD method, the power conversion efficiency (PCE, η%) of the K-MoS2 film is 6.76%, which is 23.5% higher than that of the pure MoS2. When using the PLD method, the efficiency of the K-MoS2 film is 6.56%, which is 14.3% higher than that of the pure MoS2 film. Moreover, the photoelectric performance of the K-MoS2 CE is even superior to the reference value of a Pt CE. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the series resistance (Rs) can be deduced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S4, ESI†). The Rct values of K-MoS2, MoS2, and Pt CE are 89.03, 209.4, and 9.50 Ohm cm2, respectively, while the Rs values are 2.83, 4.28, and 2.97 Ohm cm2, respectively. Obviously, the K-MoS2 CE has smaller Rct and Rs than those of the pure MoS2 CE, showing significant advantages compared to the latter. Though the Rct of K-MoS2 (89.03 Ω cm2) is far larger than that of Pt CE (9.50 Ω cm2), the Rs of K-MoS2 CE (2.83 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of Pt (2.97 Ω cm2). Finally the K-MoS2 CE is a little superior to the reference Pt CE. All of the above results indicate that the doped K atoms in MoS2 film play an important role in the enhancement of the photoelectric activity.

To understand the mechanism of the activity enhancement, it is necessary to investigate the electron transfer dynamics on the surface of the CEs. In DSSCs, using iodide/triiodide coupling (I−/I3−) as the redox medium, the reaction on the electrode surface is widely accepted as:26 I3− + 2e− → 3I−(1)
During this process, the reduction of I3− requires two electrons. A two-step process is reasonable to assume, i.e., the I3−obtains two electrons one after the other successively. The schematic diagram is illuminated in Fig. 1. In the first step, I3− obtains an electron and generates an intermediate, most probably I2−. Then in the second step, the intermediate product obtains the second electron and generates I−. In this work, in consideration of the enhanced activity exhibited by K-MoS2, it is reasonable to believe that it is the extra electrons provided by K atoms that accelerate the reduction process via the dual-electron effect. When the first electron in MoS2 is transferred to I3−, the doped K atom in the K-MoS2 acts as a high-efficiency electron donor and provides the second electron quickly to finish the whole reaction subsequently. Therefore, this dual-electron transfer effect is helpful to understand the catalytic mechanism on the CEs and to obtain ideal CEs with high photoelectric efficiency.
To explore the reducing mechanism, first-principles calculations were carried out to simulate the charge transfer between the K atom and the MoS2 films. Fig. S6a and b (ESI†) demonstrate the top and side views of MoS2 and K-MoS2, respectively. For K-MoS2, the most stable configuration with the K atom on top of Mo is taken into consideration. The optimized structure indicates that the K is bonded with its nearest S neighbours (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S6b, ESI†). As shown by density of states (DOS) (Fig. S6c, ESI†), the MoS2 is a semiconductor with a band gap of about 1.8 eV. The band distribution of K-MoS2 around the Fermi energy (EF) has similar features (Fig. S6d, ESI†). However, the extra electrons introduced by the doped K atoms occupy the conduction band and lift up the EF level. The charge difference of MoS2 before and after electron transition is shown in Fig. 4(b). It is found that the transferred electrons mainly come from the middle Mo layer, while the differential charge density of K-MoS2 shows that K donates an electron into MoS2 after an electron is lost from the entire K-MoS2 system (Fig. 4(c)). The electrons injected from K are more distinct after K-MoS2 loses two electrons (Fig. 4(d)). Compared with Fig. 4(c), it can be seen that the K atom injects electrons into MoS2 and takes on the role of losing an electron for the whole system. In summary, the effective electron contributed by the K atom leads to a dual-electron effect in K-MoS2, which in turn accelerates the reduction process and improves the electrocatalytic activity.

Though the exact dynamic process and mechanism are still under debate, the reducing reaction (1) is widely accepted in which two electrons are needed to reduce I3−. There are also a few useful guesses raised in the previous literature that the reduction of I3− requires two electrons in a two-step process,39–42i.e., the I3−obtains one electron to produce an intermediate species and then accepts the second electron to complete the reaction. However, unfortunately, the intermediate species, most probably I2−, has not been observed, possibly due to the ultra-fast dissociation of I2−.42 The fast dissociation of this intermediate species requires that the second electron should be provided very quickly after the first electron, which will determine whether I3− can be successfully reduced to I−. Besides, the diffusion of the redox medium is very slow (∼3 × 10−7 cm2 s−140), which makes the diffusion of the intermediate negligible in a short time. The position deviation during capture of two electrons can also be ignored. So whatever, given the reaction (1), an active site with the feature that dual electrons can be lost easily and timely within a short time window is definitively helpful to improve the catalystic activity. For these reasons, the dual electron effect present in the K-MoS2 system is the typical demonstration, which may be also applicable to similar systems to greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs. For example, many reports indicate that the CEs with heterojunctions have higher activity than their counterpart films.15,43–45 The band gap alignment in these heterojunctions leads to inner electric fields helping electrons transfer to the surface of the CEs. This not only can accumulate electrons on the surface of the CE to form a layer of high-density electrons, but also facilitate the electron injection after an active site has lost an electron, i.e. the second electron can be lost quickly to facilitate the whole reducing reaction. Then the reduction of ions in the electrolyte is also accelerated to improve the PCE of DSSCs. In these heterostructure CEs, they all confirmed that the catalytic performance is related to the electron flow direction, no matter what material is used. Contrarily, the heterostructure CEs have poor activity when using the opposite film order. These results are also consistent with the mechanism in our work. They have the same feature that the second electron can be injected quickly to the active site after it loses the first one. We thus speculate that the dual electron effect is a general approach for high-efficiency CEs, which may give us some helpful inspiration for better understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism and for designing CEs with higher efficiencies.
In summary, we used CVD and PLD methods to synthesize K-doped MoS2 few layers on pre-KOH-treated FTO glass. When K-MoS2 is used as a CE material for a DSSC, the electrocatalytic activity is greatly improved compared to that of the pure MoS2 CEs. A dual-electron path model is proposed to explain this activity enhancement. In this scenario the K atom acts as an electron reservoir that can provide an electron, resulting in the enhancement of its catalytic activity. First-principles calculations prove the electron injection from the doped K atom, which facilitates the reducing reaction. The present study provides in-depth research on the I3−/I− redox procedure and gives new ideas for improving the electrocatalytic activity of catalytic materials.
