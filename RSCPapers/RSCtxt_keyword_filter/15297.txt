    , Accepted 14th February 2022First published on 21st February 2022AbstractTernary and tandem strategies are effective methods for improving the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here an asymmetric wide-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor named AITC is synthesized. AITC with a bandgap of 1.75 eV exhibits a good complementary absorption spectrum with the narrow bandgap acceptor BTP-eC9. AITC also shows good miscibility with BTP-eC9, which facilitates the formation of a stable mixing phase in blends. Moreover, the large dipole moment of AITC reinforces the molecular packing in the blend films of PM6 and BTP-eC9, thereby enhancing the photoconductivity, suppressing charge recombination and reducing nonradiative voltage loss in ternary OSCs. As a result, the ternary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9:AITC achieve an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.8%. In addition, tandem OSCs using PM6:AITC as a bottom subcell and the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 ternary active layer as a top subcell exhibit a remarkable efficiency of 19.4%, which is one of the highest PCEs in the field.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be one of the most promising emerging photovoltaic technologies because highly efficient OSC panels can be produced using a low-cost solution printing method. Recently, single-junction devices based on binary blend systems have achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼18%. The construction of ternary or tandem architecture is an effective and essential strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. However, the design and synthesis of acceptors that simultaneously meet the requirements of ternary and tandem OSCs are greatly challenging in the OSC field. Herein, we report an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor, namely AITC, which exhibited strong absorption in the wavelength region of 500–700 nm, and a large dipole moment to enhance the molecular packing of PM6 and BTP-eC9. Inspiringly, the ternary OSC based on PM6:BTP-eC9:AITC achieved an outstanding PCE of 18.8%. Correspondingly, the tandem OSC using PM6:AITC as a bottom sub-cell and the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 ternary active layer as a top subcell yielded a remarkable efficiency of 19.4%. This study indicates that introducing a large dipole moment molecule as a third component provides the potential for improving the efficiency of ternary and tandem OSCs.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention because of their light weight, good flexibility, low cost, and high-throughput solution processing.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the most critical parameter that determines the commercialization of OSCs. To improve the PCE, the light across the entire solar spectra must be effectively utilized. As a device architecture that contains three materials with complementary absorption spectra in the active layer, the ternary OSCs exhibit great potential in broadening the spectral response range. Promoted by the material innovation, energy level alignment and optimized phase structures have been realized,5–9 and the PCEs of ternary OSCs have exceeded 18%.5–10 Therefore, the material design and morphology control for ternary devices have important implications for OSCs.
In ternary OSCs, the complexity in the complementary absorption spectra, matched energy levels, and optimized morphology in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer induced by multiple components constitutes a great challenge during device optimization.10–13 The design of the third component plays an important role. Presently, materials that exhibit cascade energy levels while ensuring optimal phase separation are considered as primary third-components in ternary OSCs.5,12,14 Taking the ternary BHJ mixed with one donor and two acceptors as an example, the donor directly combines with two acceptors to generate free charge carriers. The electrons in the donor can be transferred to either the host acceptor or the guest acceptor, while all the electrons in the guest acceptor may be transferred to the host acceptor with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels prior to extraction. The formation of an energy cascade alignment is thought to be favorable for exciton dissociation.5,12,14 However, in high-efficiency binary OSCs, the lower LUMO energy level offsets give rise to the difficulty in designing and synthesizing a third component with energy level cascades.15–19 Therefore, the materials that possess good compatibility with the host acceptor to form an order mixing phase are promising for constructing high-efficiency ternary OSCs.
The formation of an order phase with close molecular packing is dependent on the intermolecular interactions.7,12,14 These interactions usually include van der Waals forces, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and dipole forces.20 However, there are only a few studies on the photovoltaic performance of ternary OSCs in terms of dipole forces. Liao et al. indicated that the compatible dipole moment between two terminals in fused-ring electron acceptors is critical for ternary OSCs. Although the dipole moment of the terminal in the third component did not affect the morphology of the ternary BHJ, the acceptor composition with a larger difference in the dipole moment of the terminal negatively impacts ternary OSC performance.21 Cho et al. designed and synthesized three nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with different dipole moment Y-Th2 (0.08 Debye), Y-BDT (0.03 Debye) and Y-CDT (5.36 Debye). Although they did not clarify the relationship between the dipole moment and photovoltaic performance, the poor compatibility and miscibility of Y-CDT with the host materials in the ternary systems decreased the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs.22 Therefore, when a large dipole moment guest acceptor exhibits good compatibility with a host acceptor to guarantee the mixing and inducing of a beneficial localized structure, it would be a promising candidate as a third component to enhance the ternary device performances.
Here, benefitting from the obvious molecular dipole moment in asymmetric NFAs,23–27 we designed and synthesized an asymmetric NFA (AITC, Fig. 1a) based on 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b]thiophene-alt-[5,6-d]thieno[3,2-b] thiophene as a fused core and thienyl-fused indanone as an end-group for efficient ternary and tandem OSCs. AITC exhibited strong absorption in the wavelength region of 500–700 nm with a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV, which is suitable for enhancing the light-harvesting of the active layer in the visible region. Furthermore, AITC exhibited good compatibility with BTP-eC9, facilitating the formation of the mixing phase. Moreover, the large dipole moment of AITC was beneficial for reinforcing the molecular packing, leading to a suppressed charge recombination, improved charge transport, and lower nonradiative voltage loss. Consequently, ternary OSCs based on an optimal blend ratio of PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 (1:0.3:1.2) exhibited an excellent performance with PCEs of 18.8% (0.04 cm2) and 16.7% (1.03 cm2). Notably, the tandem OSC with PM6:AITC as the bottom active layer and PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 as the top active layer achieved a PCE of 19.4%, which is among the highest values recorded in this field.

2. Results and discussion
The molecular structures of AITC, BTP-eC9 and PM6 are shown in Fig. 1a. The synthetic routes of AITC are illustrated in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The chemical structure of AITC was characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDITOF (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). AITC demonstrated excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), at room temperature. In addition, the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of AITC was calculated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the high ESP value of AITC suggested its excellent electron-accepting capacity. The electronic energy levels of AITC were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S5, ESI†). The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of AITC were −5.73 ± 0.01 eV and −3.77 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. The higher LUMO energy level of AITC is beneficial for achieving a large open circuit voltage (VOC) in the OSCs.
As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the AITC film exhibited strong absorption from 500 to 700 nm with a distinct absorption peak at 653 nm as well as a wide optical bandgap of 1.75 eV, which was well complementary to BTP-eC9. In the spectral range of 550–650 nm, AITC exhibited a higher absorption coefficient (1.89 × 105 cm−1) than PM6 (1.50 × 105 cm−1), which was beneficial for eliminating the negative effect of the absorption spectra overlap. As shown in Fig. 1c, the photoluminescence of AITC strongly overlapped with the absorption of BTP-eC9, favouring the energy transfer between them. As the AITC content increased in the blend, the BTP-eC9 emission continuously enhanced, while the AITC emission diminished, illustrating the efficient excitation energy transfer from AITC to BTP-eC9. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of the OSC-based AITC, BTP-eC9 and AICT:BTP-eC9 indicated that the energy transfer was a dominant work mechanism from AITC to BTP-eC9 (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). The mechanism is shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†).
The miscibility of AITC and BTP-eC9 was investigated according to the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) () via the surface free energy of each single component (γAITC and γBTP-eC9).28γAITC and γBTP-eC9 were calculated by using Wu's model with the contact angle of water and diiodomethane (DIM) determined on the films of neat AITC and BTP-eC9 (Fig. S8, ESI†). Using the parameters of AITC (contact angles are 95.8° and 38.9°; the γAITC is 43.85 mN m−1) and BTP-eC9 (contact angles are 96.9° and 34.3°; the γAITC is 41.09 mN m−1), the χ of AITC:BTP-eC9 is calculated as 0.05 mN m−1 (Fig. 1d), suggesting that it was prone to form a mixed acceptor phase in AITC:BTP-eC9 blends.7,9,12,14 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are shown in Fig. 1e. The melting point for BTP-eC9 is 303.2 °C, and the melting point for AITC is 272.2 °C. For the AITC:BTP-eC9 (0.3:1.2) mixture, a single melting point of 290.5 °C was observed. Thus, AITC in small amounts acted as an impurity and suppressed the melting point of BTP-eC9 effectively. This result confirmed that AITC and BTP-eC9 are highly miscible thermodynamically, which evidenced the formation of a stable mixing phase in ternary blends.7,12,14
The molecular geometries of AITC and BTP-eC9 were predicted by the DFT simulation. As shown in Fig. 1f, although the AITC and BTP-eC9 acceptors possessed almost planar geometry, an intense dipole moment (4.72 Debye) exists in the AITC molecule which can induce strong intermolecular interactions.23,27 In the mixing phase of AITC:BTP-eC9, the asymmetric AITC molecules with intense dipole moment can act as “glue” to enhance the close contact of molecules and form strong electronic coupling to enhance charge transfer and carrier diffusion (Fig. 1g). To test our hypothesis, we designed and synthesized a small molecule with a symmetric structure (SITC), and the molecular structure is shown in Fig. S9a (ESI†). SITC practically possessed planar geometry and a dipole moment of 0.11 Debye (Fig. S9b, ESI†), which created a strong contrast with AITC. Thereafter, we measured the viscosities of five precursor solutions at 25 °C using an Ubbelohde viscometer. As shown in Fig. S9c (ESI†), the viscosities of the precursor solutions are 0.61, 0.55, 0.77, 0.68 and 1.45 mPa·s for BTP-eC9, SITC, AITC, SITC:BTP-eC9 and AITC:BTP-eC9, respectively. Three precursor solutions for pure materials exhibited similar viscosities. However, the mixed acceptor AITC:BTP-eC9 shows a larger viscosity than SITC:BTP-eC9. The large change in viscosity was ascribed to the strong intermolecular forces such as dipole–dipole attractive forces.28 In addition, the relationship between dipole moment and molecular packing was further investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S9d (ESI†), the face-on orientations with π–π stacking peaks at 1.745 Å-1 (d-spacing: 3.599 Å), 1.740 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.610 Å), 1.763 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.562 Å), 1.744 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.601 Å), and 1.757 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.574 Å) were observed for the BTP-eC9, SITC, AITC, SITC:BTP-eC9 and, AITC:BTP-eC9 films, respectively. Compared with SITC, the introduction of AITC with a large moment reinforced the π–π stacking of the BTP-eC9 molecule. The close packing of the AITC:BTP-eC9 film was ascribed to the large solution viscosity, which enables solution shearing.30 These results confirmed that AITC with a large natural dipole moment can enhance the intermolecular forces and reinforce the molecular packing.
The structure order of the blended films was further studied. For PM6:AITC, PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9, the pronounced reflection of π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction at 1.76 Å−1, 1.74 Å−1 and 1.73 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.57 Å, 3.61 Å and 3.63 Å (Fig. 2b and Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, the crystal correlation length (CCL) of the three samples was calculated using the Scherrer equation.6 The calculation method for the CCL is provided in the ESI† (Fig. S10). The CCLs of PM6:AITC, PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6: BTP-eC9 in the π–π stacking direction are 21.10, 21.00 and 20.78 Å, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). These results were ascribed to the “adsorb-ability” of AITC with large dipole moment so that the strong interaction between the materials formed a new mixing phase with reinforced molecular packing. The more ordered AITC enhanced the crystallization of the host acceptor in the ternary BHJ film. According to the literature,6,7,12,14 the BHJ with such a morphology shows superiority in obtaining high photovoltaic performance.
The photoconductivity (σ) of pure acceptors and mixed acceptors is measured and calculated based on the I–V curves (Fig. 2c) of devices with a glass/ITO/BHJ/Ag structure under 660 nm illumination and using eqn (1). (1)where L, R, and S are the thickness of the BHJ, resistance and area of the electrode. The σ values of AITC, AITC:BTP-eC9 and BTP-eC9 were 1.12 × 10−4, 5.68 × 10−4 and 2.16 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. Moreover, we further verify the photoconductivity of the acceptor and mixed acceptor in the blend films by using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), and the diagram is shown in Fig. 2d. Under the bias laser of 660 nm illumination, the 2D C-AFM images of three BHJ films are shown in Fig. 2e. The ternary blend film shows the highest current response at an applied bias voltage of 5 V. These results indicated that the formation of high thin film crystallinity can effectively increase the photoconductivity of the acceptor.

Single-junction OSCs with a structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The detailed conditions of device fabrication are shown in Fig. S11 and Table S3 (ESI†). The binary OSC based on PM6:BTP-eC9 exhibited a PCE of 17.2% with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 26.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 76.5%, while the PM6:AITC OSC exhibited a PCE of 11.0%, with a high VOC of 1.07 V, a low JSC of 14.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.6%. In the ternary OSCs based on PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9, the VOC of the corresponding OSCs increases clearly with an increase of the AITC content. When the weight ratio of ATIC reached 30% in the acceptor, the OSC yielded a remarkable PCE of 18.8%, with a simultaneous increase in the VOC of 0.87 V, JSC of 27.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.7%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported for single-junction OSCs (Table S4, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S11 (ESI†). The integrated short circuit current density (Jcal) values are 14.2 (PM6:AITC), 26.7 (PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9) and 26.1 (PM6:BTP-eC9) mA cm−2, correlating with the measured JSC values within 3% deviation for the three OSCs.

To reveal the enhancement induced by unified molecular orientation, the distinguished behaviour of the OSC based on PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 was studied by device physics analysis. First, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) of the binary and ternary OSCs were characterized and are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S5 (ESI†). The ternary OSCs show an improved Pdiss (0.99), compared with the binary devices (0.95 and 0.96 for the devices based on PM6:AITC and PM6:BTP-eC9, respectively). Moreover, we investigated the J–V curves of the OSCs at different temperatures under low irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 10 mW cm−2, Fig. S13, ESI†), and extract the plots of JSCversus temperature. The activation energy (Ea) for geminate pair separation can be obtained using equation 2 as follows:31 (2)where J0, k, and T are the preexponential factor, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, the ternary OSCs showed the lowest Ea of 11.15 meV, compared to 12.52 meV for PM6:AITC and 19.03 meV for the PM6:BTP-eC9 binary device. The lower Ea in the ternary BHJ indicated a lower energy loss during exciton dissociation than the binary BHJs.
The charge transport properties were investigated via the photo-induced charge-carrier extraction at linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) and the voltage-dependent space charge limited current (SCLC) to determine the bulk carrier mobility, hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe). The detailed methods for the experiment and calculation are available in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the mobilities obtained by photo-CELIV were calculated to be 1.97 × 10−4, 2.41 × 10−4 and 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for the PM6:AITC, PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9 devices, respectively. As shown in Fig. S15 and Table S6 (ESI†), incorporation of AITC improved and balanced the SCLC charge mobility in the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 film, which promoted the JSC and FF.
On the other hand, the charge recombination process is evaluated by measuring the light intensity (Plight)-dependent VOC in the binary and ternary OSCs. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the ternary OSC exhibits a slope of 1.08 kT/q while those of PM6:AITC (1.15 kT/q) and PM6:BTP-eC9 (1.24 kT/q) were considerably higher. This indicated that the trap-assisted recombination in ternary cells was restrained. The deduction was supported by the charge lifetime (τ) and charge density (n) of the binary and ternary OSCs, which are obtained in transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction (CE) measurements. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the ternary OSCs present a longer τ and higher n compared to the binary OSCs. The function of τ versus n followed a power law dependence (Fig. S17c, ESI†), indicating that the nongeminate recombination was the dominating loss channel for carriers under open-circuit conditions.30,32 As a result, the ternary OSC presents a recombination order (R) of 2.12, which indicated a mechanism close to an ideal bimolecular recombination, justified by an FF of 79.7%. In addition, the non-geminate recombination rate constant (krec) can be inferred from n and τ based on eqn (3)29,31 (3)
The calculated plots in Fig. 3d illustrated that the krec in ternary cells was the lowest compared to that in the binary cells. Combining the characterization studies of Ea and the Plight-dependent VOC (Fig. S16, ESI†), we can infer that the unified molecular orientation in ternary BHJs was beneficial for restraining the geminate and bimolecular recombination.
For obtaining insight into the improved VOC in the ternary OSCs, we studied the energy loss (Eloss) using Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy EQE (EQEFTPS) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. According to the established model,33 the calculation method is provided in the ESI.† The measured EQEFTPS and EL results are shown in Fig. 3e and Table S7 (ESI†). The Eg values of the OSCs were determined to be 1.81, 1.40, and 1.40 eV from the crossing point of the EL and EQE spectra of the devices based on PM6:AITC, PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9, respectively. Consequently, the ΔE3 values were 0.32, 0.21 and 0.24 eV for the PM6:AITC, PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9-based OSCs, respectively, which corresponded to the calculated ΔE3 (Fig. 3f and Table S4, ESI†). The decrease in the ΔE3 can be linked to the high VOC in the ternary OSCs.
To understand the reduced nonradiative energy losses, we investigated the trap-state density (ntrap) in OSCs. To maximize the trap-state density in the dark, OSCs with 250 nm-thick BHJs were employed. In Fig. 3g, three regions with distinct slopes can be recognized by α = 1 (Ohmic regime), α > 3 (trap-filled limit regime) and α = 2 (Child's regime), respectively.34 We are able to quantify the ntrap in OSCs, that is, 0.35 × 1012 and 1.06 × 1012 cm−3 for the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9 based OSCs, respectively. The trap-induced recombination in the 250 nm-thick ternary device was significantly weaker than that in the binary OSCs.
Benefitting from the reduced trap-state density, improved mobility, and depressed charge recombination, the introduction of AITC was helpful for the fabrication of PM6:BTP-eC9 based thick-film OSCs. We fabricated OSCs with the active layer of different thicknesses. The J–V characteristics of these devices are shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S8 (ESI†) and Fig. 3h. It can be seen that the PCE of ternary OSCs presents a weaker thickness-dependence. Remarkably, a PCE of 18.0% was observed in the ternary device with a 250 nm thick BHJ. This is the highest value among the reported PCEs in the OSCs with thicknesses of around 250 nm.35,36 As a result, the weaker thickness-dependence in the ternary devices was beneficial for the fabrication of solution-printed large area OSCs and tandem OSCs.
To fully use the characteristics of AITC and further explore its application potential to maximize the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, we fabricated the ternary rigid and flexible OSCs with 1.0 cm2 using blade coating and slot-die coating (Fig. 4a). The diagram and real images of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 4a. The uniform and high EQE in the EQE mapping in Fig. 4b and c demonstrated the feasibility of the ternary BHJ in meniscus guided coating. Under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation, the 1.0 cm2 rigid and flexible cells yield PCEs of 16.7% and 15.8% (Fig. 4d and Table 2), respectively, which are both the highest values among the reported values to the state of the art.37–39 Furthermore, we make the statistics diagrams of efficiencies for 20 large area cells (Fig. 4e). The rigid and flexible cells show the average values of 16.3% and 15.4%, with deviations of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. In addition, the long-term stability of OSCs under continuous sunlight illumination is studied. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, 84% of the initial PCE can be maintained after 1300 hours illumination, which is much higher than in the case of the binary cell. The morphology stability of the blends was investigated. As shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†), the aggregated morphology was observed in the aged PM6:BTP-eC9 film. In contrast, the AITC incorporated blend morphology was not significantly affected by aging. These images provide direct evidence that AITC is extremely efficient in limiting the thermally induced aggregation in the blends and also reducing its phase segregation. These results were due to the strong “adsorb-ability” of AITC with large dipole moment to reinforce the molecular packing in the ternary blends. Therefore, the BHJs with close molecular packing morphologies possessed large intermolecular binding energies, which improved the morphology stability and account for the improved photostability in ternary OSCs.

Finally, we further fabricated inverted tandem solar cells with a PM6:AITC binary blend system as a bottom cell and a PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 ternary blend system as a top cell (Fig. 4g and h). As shown in Fig. 4i and Table 2, under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation, the optimal tandem OSC exhibited an outstanding PCE of 19.4%, which is one of the highest PCEs obtained for tandem OSCs (Table S9, ESI†).30,40–42 The Jcal integrated by the EQE curves (Fig. 4j) was 13.5 mA cm−2 for the bottom sub-cell and 13.5 mA cm−2 for the top sub-cell, suggesting balanced current generation in each sub-cell. These results indicated the outstanding PCE achieved for tandem solar cells by utilizing the AITC-based blend system.
Conclusions
Here, an asymmetric NFA AITC with a bandgap of 1.75 eV was designed and synthesized. AITC exhibited good compatibility with BTP-eC9, which facilitated the formation of a stable mixing acceptor. Benefiting from a large dipole of AITC, improved molecular packing is achieved in PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 blends. The enhanced molecular packing gives rise to a reduced active energy for exciton dissociation, depressed charge recombination and low nonradiative voltage loss, and the ternary single-junction OSC yielded a remarkable PCE of 18.8%. Moreover, printed rigid and flexible large area OSCs based on ternary BHJs exhibited PCEs of 16.7% and 15.8%, respectively. In particular, the cells processed by blade coating presented excellent stability. Owing to the introduction of AITC, the ternary OSC presented a weak thickness-dependence. The tandem OSC based on the PM6:AITC bottom BHJ and the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 top BHJ yielded a PCE of 19.4%, which is one of the highest PCEs in this field.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be one of the most promising emerging photovoltaic technologies because highly efficient OSC panels can be produced using a low-cost solution printing method. Recently, single-junction devices based on binary blend systems have achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼18%. The construction of ternary or tandem architecture is an effective and essential strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. However, the design and synthesis of acceptors that simultaneously meet the requirements of ternary and tandem OSCs are greatly challenging in the OSC field. Herein, we report an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor, namely AITC, which exhibited strong absorption in the wavelength region of 500–700 nm, and a large dipole moment to enhance the molecular packing of PM6 and BTP-eC9. Inspiringly, the ternary OSC based on PM6:BTP-eC9:AITC achieved an outstanding PCE of 18.8%. Correspondingly, the tandem OSC using PM6:AITC as a bottom sub-cell and the PM6:AITC:BTP-eC9 ternary active layer as a top subcell yielded a remarkable efficiency of 19.4%. This study indicates that introducing a large dipole moment molecule as a third component provides the potential for improving the efficiency of ternary and tandem OSCs.
