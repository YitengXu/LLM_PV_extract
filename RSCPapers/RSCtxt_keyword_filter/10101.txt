    , Accepted 29th February 2016First published on 1st March 2016AbstractThe grain size of perovskites was enhanced and the grain boundary was filled with sulfonate carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) during the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution spin-coating process with the incorporation of s-CNTs. The performance of s-CNT incorporated perovskite solar cells remarkably increased from 10.3% to 15.1% (best) compared with pristine CNT incorporated perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent properties such as high absorption coefficients, excellent ambipolar charge mobilities and small exciton binding energies.1–3 Moreover, the abundance of raw materials and the ability of being solution processed make methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskites more suitable for low cost photovoltaic technologies.4 The reported organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3 thin films processed by various methods show quite different device performance.5–8 Over the past five years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of both mesoporous structure devices and planar structure devices obtained by the solution process have preceded other third generation thin film solar cells, which shows their bright future applications in organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.9
One of the most crucial issues of PSCs is the morphology control of the perovskite film. The ideal morphology requires homogeneous and highly crystalline characteristics.9–12 Generally, the “island” like structures with poor crystallinity have been obtained, leading to current leakage and a negative influence on the charge dynamics of PSCs.13–15 Many innovative approaches have been used to improve the morphology of the perovskite film, such as adding additives,16,17 varying the composition,18 solvent washing19 and controlling annealing time, temperature, or atmosphere.5,20
Grain boundaries, always known for the enrichment regions of charge traps, should be eliminated across the carrier transport path. In other words, to expand the threshold thickness of the device as well as the charge mobility, perovskite crystallites with a large grain size should be formed, so that the least number of grain boundaries needs to be passed through by the carriers before being collected.21 The defects and the crystal grain boundaries of the perovskite crystallites act as the traps of carriers, which would aggravate charge recombination. The hysteresis effect, which causes inaccuracy in evaluating cell efficiency, is also believed to be related to the crystallinity and interfaces of the perovskite.22,23 Thus, the device performance strongly depends on the morphology of the perovskite film.21 Above all, technologies aiming at a dense layer with large perovskite crystallites and reduced grain boundary are highly desired.
Recently, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with excellent electrical, optical, chemical and mechanical properties have attracted great attention.24,25 CNTs can offer good durability and flexibility, ease of processing, low reflectance, natural color and stable transparency along the entire visible light spectrum.26–28 Their electrical properties also give rise to their utilization as various components in novel optoelectronic devices.29–31 Several studies on the application of CNTs in the interfacial layer and the electrode of PSCs with high performance have been reported.32,33
Herein, we demonstrate a simple approach to enhance the grain size and reduce the grain boundary of the perovskite film by the incorporation of sulfonate carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs). A high-quality perovskite film with full surface coverage and micron-sized grains was produced. Moreover, s-CNTs were filled in the boundary between perovskite grains. The perovskite solar cell with s-CNTs (the device structure shown in Fig. 1) can achieve a high efficiency of 15.1%, in comparison to the value of 10.3% based on the device with pristine CNTs. This method provides a new approach for enhancing the morphology and crystallinity by the incorporation of the template in the perovskite layer.
 Fig. 1  Device configuration of the perovskite solar cell (FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2-CH3NH3PbI3 nanocomposite layer/CH3NH3PbI3 upper layer/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag). The insets show the schematic diagrams of the incorporation of sulfonated carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) into perovskite films and the preparation of s-CNTs from pristine CNTs. 
s-CNTs were successfully synthesized using concentrated sulfuric acid treated CNTs. As a result, sulfonate functional groups were loaded on the CNTs to obtain s-CNTs.34 The formation of s-CNTs can be confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Fig. S1 (ESI†) reveals the spectral features and peak positions of S–O and C–S stretching vibrations of s-CNTs at 1012 cm−1. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of s-CNTs with the diameter range from 40 to 60 nm. Experimental details can be seen in the Experimental section in the ESI.†Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the PSC cell architecture, the device configuration is FTO/compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2)-CH3NH3PbI3 nanocomposite layer/CH3NH3PbI3 upper layer/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag. In this work, CNTs and s-CNTs were added to the perovskite precursor to study the crystallization of perovskite films with these two carbon nanomaterials. The reference precursor was PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide without any additive. The precursors were spin coated on mp-TiO2 using the fast deposition–crystallization method35 to obtain perovskite films.
Initially, SEM was conducted to analyse the morphologies of the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2, the perovskite film formed from the precursor with the addition of pristine CNTs displays a poor crystalline morphology with small perovskite crystal grain size (average 200 nm) and pin-holes between two grains. Moreover, some CNTs run through the surface of the perovskite film. The reference perovskite film fabricated from the conventional perovskite precursor exhibits full surface coverage and is composed of bigger sized grains than the perovskite precursor with pristine CNTs. The perovskite film fabricated from the precursor with functionalized s-CNTs shows enhanced micron-sized grains, especially grain boundaries filled with s-CNTs. From the in-plane grain size distributions in Fig. 2, we can find that the grain size of the s-CNT incorporated perovskite films increases up to a maximum size of 1150 nm with the perovskite thickness of about 320 nm. While the maximum grain sizes in the CNTs incorporated perovskite films and pristine perovskite films are around 300 nm and 820 nm, respectively. Therefore, s-CNTs in the perovskite precursor would assist the grain size increase but the CNTs have the contrary effect. The charge extraction process in the s-CNT incorporated perovskite films should be improved for obtaining larger grain size and filled grain boundaries. The photogenerated charges can go through grain boundaries via s-CNTs in the in-plane direction and then be collected by the electrodes.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns have been measured to confirm the crystallinity change. Fig. 3a shows the XRD results of perovskite films fabricated from the conventional precursor and with the addition of pristine CNTs or s-CNTs. Intense diffraction peaks at 14.8°, 20.9°, 24.1°, 29.2° and 32.5° can be assigned to (110), (112), (211), (220) and (312) diffractions of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 phase, respectively. The s-CNT incorporated perovskite film shows the highest diffraction peak intensity compared to those of the conventional and pristine CNT incorporated perovskite films, which illustrates that the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites possess higher crystallinity. XRD results are consistent with the SEM images. In addition, the diffraction peaks that appeared at 26.4° and 26.0° for pristine CNT and s-CNT incorporated perovskite films are the characteristic peaks of CNTs and s-CNTs, respectively, further demonstrating the presence of CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon nanotube composites.

(b and c) Absorbance and photoluminescence spectra of conventional, CNT and s-CNT incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 films. (d) Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements of conventional, CNT and s-CNT incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 films, and the films are coated on the TiO2 surface. 
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the perovskite films with and without CNTs or s-CNTs are recorded. From the UV/Vis spectra in Fig. 3b, all the perovskite films absorb above 80% of the light passing through the ITO glass in the range of 400–650 nm. The s-CNT incorporated perovskite film achieves a slightly higher absorbance between 500 and 800 nm, which ensures a considerable current density of the device performance.
The charge trap states were discovered to be greatly related to crystallinity and grain size. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) was measured to investigate the charge trap states in the perovskite film and carbon nanomaterial incorporated perovskite film. In Fig. 3c, the s-CNT incorporated perovskite film displays a strong perovskite emmision signal at 770 nm, while the pure perovskite film shows a reduced signal. When the CNTs were incorporated into the perovskite film, the signal greatly reduces. Furthermore, time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. 3d) show that the s-CNT incorporated perovskite films give an improved photoluminescence lifetime (14.8 ns) compared with control (5.2 ns) and CNT based perovskite films (3.3 ns), which is attributed to s-CNTs assisting the increased grain size of perovskites as well as filling in the grain boundary, consequently reducing the charge trap states and transporting charge effectively.
To investigate the effect of CNT or s-CNT incorporated perovskites on the device performance, the device structure illustrated in Fig. 1 (glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2-CH3NH3PbI3 nanocomposite layer/CH3NH3PbI3 upper layer (320 nm)/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag) was fabricated. The correcting device area was 0.06 cm2, by the overlap of the cathode and anode. The currents were measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the device, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a and Table S1 (ESI†), the pure CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell shows a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%, which is similar to a literature report. However, the incorporation of pristine CNTs in the perovskite precursor results in the PCE decrease to 10.3%, which demonstrates the poor performance of CNTs in the perovskite solar cell. Remarkably, the s-CNT incorporated perovskite solar cell possesses the best PCE surged to 15.1%, which shows 21% and 44% improvements in contrast to the values of both conventional and pristine CNT incorporated perovskite solar cells, respectively. Compared to conventional perovskite solar cells, all device photovoltaic parameters improve, e.g. the short current density (Jsc) increases from 19.1 to 20.8 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.95 to 0.97 V, and the fill factor (FF) from 0.68 to 0.75. Moreover, the Jsc values obtained from incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. S3, ESI†) are consistent with that of the J–V curves. In order to testify the efficiency reliability, nearly 40 devices (Fig. S4, ESI†) for each structure from more than five batches (some edge devices were discarded) have been fabricated. Fig. 4b shows the statistic PCE histogram of the devices. The device performance of CNT incorporated perovskite solar cells shows a wide distribution of PCEs (range: 5.5% to 10.3%). In comparison, the s-CNT incorporated perovskite solar cells show a narrow PCE distribution from 13.5% to 15.1%. We attribute the high reproducibility and high performance to the improved morphology and increased grain size of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite by incorporating s-CNTs. The hysteresis in the J–V curves of s-CNT incorporated PSCs has been measured. As shown in Fig. 4c, the device shows the PCE of 15.0% from the reverse scan, while the forward scan yields 13.6%. The CNT incorporated perovskite devices and the control perovskite devices have the same hysteresis (Fig. S5, ESI†). The hysteresis is commonly seen in TiO2 based PSCs.36 In order to understand the stabilized power output, the steady-state photocurrent has been measured by holding at a forward bias of 0.81 V. Fig. 4d shows the steady-state photocurrent as a function of time. The photocurrent stabilizes within seconds to approximately 18 mA cm−2, achieving a stabilized PCE of 13.9%. The increased performance of s-CNT incorporated PSCs would be attributed to the enhanced grain size and the reduced trap state. Furthermore, Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†) show the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells with different concentrations of s-CNTs. The results reveal that devices with 0.05 mg ml−1 of s-CNTs in the perovskite precursor solution could obtain high performance.

(d) Photocurrent density and PCE as a function of time for the same cell held at a forward bias of 0.81 V. 
The interaction of s-CNTs with MAI is further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the S 2p peak shift to low binding energy after the s-CNTs were doped into MAI, which reveals the interaction between s-CNTs and MAI. FTIR spectra in Fig. S8 (ESI†) also confirm the presence of S–O stretching vibration of s-CNTs coordinated to MA+ at 1012 cm−1. Probable mechanisms of the perovskite film formed from the precursor solution with the incorporation of CNTs and s-CNTs have been proposed in Fig. 5. Pristine CNTs are only dispersed in the precursor solution without any interaction with the component. When DMF solvent is extracted by chlorobenzene dripping during the perovskite precursor solution spin-coating process,35 CNTs are separated out to suppress the perovskite grain growth affording small perovskite grains. The XRD results reveal the low crystallinity of the perovskite incorporated with CNTs. The sulfonic acid (–SO3H) groups bonded to the s-CNTs have negative charge. When s-CNTs disperse in the precursor solution, MA+ in the solution will have some interaction with –SO3− (–SO3− exchanges I− from MAI). As a result, a number of MAI molecules will gather around the s-CNTs. After chlorobenzene dripping on the wet film, the perovskites near the s-CNTs are crystallized. The continuous presence of MAI would enhance the grain size of perovskites.37 Upon heating the film, the interaction between MAI and s-CNTs continues to promote the perovskite grain growth and the s-CNTs finally exist in the grain boundary.
 Fig. 5  (a) Scheme for the formation process of CNT incorporated perovskite film: (i) the addition of CNTs in the perovskite precursor, (ii) after the chlorobenzene dripping on the wet film, the induced CNTs suppressing the perovskite grain growth to form small grains. (b) Scheme for the formation process of s-CNT incorporated perovskite film: (i) except for the interaction between MAI and PbI2, a number of MAI molecules interacting with s-CNTs in the precursor solution, (ii) after the chlorobenzene dripping on the wet film, the perovskites near s-CNTs are crystallized. Upon heating the film, the interaction between MAI and s-CNTs continues to promote the perovskite grain growth. 
In summary, highly-efficient CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs based on the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials have been reported for the first time. The s-CNT incorporated perovskite film is found to have large grain size and filled grain boundary, which directly contribute to the photovoltaic performance achieving a high PCE of 15.1% compared to that of the CNT incorporated device of 10.3%. The current study not only reveals that the s-CNTs can be appropriate grain growing and carrier transporting materials for efficient PSCs, but also points out that carbon materials with high conductivity and appropriate charge will have great potential to boost the power conversion efficiency of PSCs.

(c) Forward and reverse scan J–V curves for s-CNT incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. (d) Photocurrent density and PCE as a function of time for the same cell held at a forward bias of 0.81 V.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Scheme for the formation process of CNT incorporated perovskite film: (i) the addition of CNTs in the perovskite precursor, (ii) after the chlorobenzene dripping on the wet film, the induced CNTs suppressing the perovskite grain growth to form small grains. (b) Scheme for the formation process of s-CNT incorporated perovskite film: (i) except for the interaction between MAI and PbI2, a number of MAI molecules interacting with s-CNTs in the precursor solution, (ii) after the chlorobenzene dripping on the wet film, the perovskites near s-CNTs are crystallized. Upon heating the film, the interaction between MAI and s-CNTs continues to promote the perovskite grain growth.
