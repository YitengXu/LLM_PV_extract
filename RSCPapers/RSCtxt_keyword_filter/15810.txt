Herein, the signature of photocarrier trapping associated with exciton–phonon coupling is identified by investigating the pump fluence-dependent exciton diffusion and annihilation dynamics. The kinetic fittings with the exciton–exciton annihilation model demonstrate the intensified exciton–phonon coupling under continuous photothermal stress. Then, we show that a feasible “charge bridge” approach, which enables the decoupling of exciton–phonon interactions of bulk heterojunctions, brings about an enhancement in device efficiency and photothermal stability by dredging non-radiative photocarrier trapping pathways. Experimental proof is provided by the design and fabrication of quaternary OSCs with reduced energetic disorder and the generation of trap states, where a “charge bridge” for charge transfer and transport through the interfacial region is constructed by regulating the energy landscape with the introduced polymer donor and acceptor. The revealed intensified exciton–phonon interactions after photothermal aging are suppressed by the proposed “charge bridge” strategy, giving rise to less exciton and charge trapping resulting from improved exciton–phonon decoupling. This work emphasizes the importance of tailoring exciton–phonon coupling behaviors, providing a design pathway for developing efficient and stable non-fullerene OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors have achieved remarkable progress with the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing 19%. This progress increases the commercial potential of organic photovoltaics. However, to enable the practical application of OSCs, one of the key challenges is to obtain high device efficiencies with sufficient operational lifetime. Especially, it is challenging to achieve superior photothermal stability with currently reported highly-efficient OSCs. Moreover, fundamental identification of degradation mechanisms under continuous photothermal stress is still missing. Herein, we revealed the accelerated nonradiative trapping of excitons and charge as a result of the intensified exciton–phonon interactions induced by photothermal aging with the help of the exciton–exciton annihilation approach. A feasible strategy of the “charge bridge” for charge transfer and transport through the interfacial region was proposed to dredge photocarrier trapping pathways by facilitating exciton–phonon decoupling of bulk heterojunctions. Ultimately, the “charge bridge” strategy yields simultaneously improved PCEs and photothermal stability in two types of quaternary OSCs processed from both halogenated and non-halogenated solvents. The proposed strategy of decoupling the exciton–phonon interactions provides helpful photophysical insights toward developing efficient and stable organic photovoltaic cells.

Introduction
The development and application of Y-series small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs) have led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%.1–5 Unfortunately, the thermodynamic relaxation of the fine-mixed domains within the photoactive layers degenerates the morphological stability due to the low glass transition temperatures and high diffusion coefficients of the record-holding Y-series NFAs,6,7 which has been proved to be an obstacle for developing long-term stable OSCs. In the condensed phase, this thermodynamic relaxation drastically accelerates when the kinetically unstable morphologies are under thermal stress or light illumination.8–11 This fast degradation pathway becomes the main structural origin of severe exciton and charge carrier trapping.12–14 Depending on the degraded microstructure, singlet excitons in nanoscale spatial region might control light emission and undergo a large number of non-radiative processes, such as diffusion, annihilation, localization into trap states, and dissociation into charge carriers. Quite recently, some feasible strategies such as constructing a multiple-component photoactive layer based on one-pot polymerization,15 combining NFAs with a similar structure yet different morphological features,16 designing oligomer molecules and polymer acceptors,17–19 and employing solid additives20,21 have been proposed to overcome this conundrum related to the metastable morphology. The recent progress made in revealing the degradation mechanism and improving the device lifetime of the state-of-the-art OSCs under various aging conditions is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Previously, regarding the interaction between the charge and molecular vibrations, we have elucidated the signature of transport and annihilation of polaronic states in those OSCs based on Y-series NFAs, where those highly localized trapped polarons exhibit a significantly prolonged lifetime on a nanosecond temporal scale.22,23 Invoking the concept of electron–phonon interaction and its effects on the optical and transport properties of matter, a detailed understanding of exciton trapping kinetics involving thermodynamic relaxation can guide structural design that is optimized for strengthening morphological stability.
The interpretation of exciton diffusion and annihilation dynamics is primarily according to a pump fluence-dependent exciton–exciton annihilation model that accounts for both long-range resonance interactions and collisional mechanisms.24–27 These two competitive rate-limiting processes are considered to represent the diffusion and collision of excitons and long-range resonance energy transfer among excitons, respectively.24 In previous studies of exciton diffusion, proof of migration pathways is provided by thermally activated hopping from one localized site to its neighbor.28–30 Of note is that local heating occurs at higher photon fluxes and results in larger exciton–phonon couplings in the blend microstructure. The strong interaction between exciton and molecular vibrations localizes excitons and hampers long-range exciton diffusion.31–34 This physical mechanism and microscopic interaction that influences the device efficiency in OSCs based on Y-series NFAs are preliminarily debated. For instance, Zuo et al. demonstrated that the proposed dilution effect yielded increased luminescence quantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage (VOC) by suppressing electron–vibration coupling in multiple-component organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.35 However, up to now, the evolutionary nature of exciton–phonon coupling during the thermodynamic relaxation process of the initially metastable morphology and its connection to the stability limitations of OSCs remain unclear. Moreover, effective strategies to dredge exciton trapping pathways are urgently needed toward enhancing the thermodynamic stability.
In this work, we focus on the suppression of exciton trapping induced by photothermal aging in the high-performance PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs, striving to elucidate the underlying correlation between diffusion and annihilation dynamics of excitons and their coupling interactions with phonons. An NFA L8-BO, compatible with BTP-eC9, is introduced into the binary control blend to form an alloy-like acceptor phase. Careful analysis of exciton diffusion and annihilation kinetics reveals the intensified exciton–phonon coupling in the BTP-eC9:L8-BO blend after photothermal aging. Then a strategy of “charge bridge” for charge transfer and transport through the interfacial region is demonstrated using two carefully designed quaternary mixtures of donor–acceptor components. A polymer donor PB2F and a polymer acceptor PY-IT are employed as the fourth component to form the interfacial location in the PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO ternary blend system, respectively, in which the phase separation, crystallinity and interfacial energy landscape are synergistically manipulated. Along with temperature-dependent spectroscopic investigations, we find that the “charge bridge” facilitates exciton–phonon decoupling in the aged acceptor phase to dredge exciton and charge carrier trapping pathways. Using this strategy, enhanced device efficiencies and reduced performance losses under photothermal stress are achieved in two types of quaternary OSCs processed from both halogenated and non-halogenated solvents. These improvements, especially for the photothermal stability, lie mainly in suppressed exciton and charge carrier trapping, attributed to a small increase of energetic disorder and generation of trap states. Through our approach we can effectively mitigate the influence of exciton–phonon coupling on exciton transport, suggesting a direction for further efficiency and stability improvement in state-of-the-art non-fullerene OSCs.
Results and discussion
To reveal the evolution of exciton–phonon coupling under photothermal stress and elaborate effective design rules of the “charge bridge” for optimal material combinations, we choose two polymer donors (PM6, PB2F), two small-molecule NFAs (BTP-eC9, L8-BO), and one polymer NFA (PY-IT) as the platforms of this research (Fig. 1(a)). The PM6, PB2F and PY-IT polymers possess the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 27.8, 14.2 and 3.6 kDa with polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 12.76, 1.69 and 2.00, respectively, determined by gel permeation chromatography with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). The PM6:BTP-eC9 blend was employed as the binary control system with L8-BO as the third component. Afterwards, the polymer donor PB2F and polymer acceptor PY-IT were introduced into the PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO ternary blends as the fourth components, respectively. These materials combined in two quaternary systems possess complementary absorption spectra (Fig. 1(b) and Fig. S2, ESI†), thereby contributing to improving the photocurrent. The energy levels of the quaternary materials measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy together with optical bandgaps are shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The cascaded energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can ensure efficient electron transfer and transport. Meanwhile, as evidenced by previous studies,36–38 the nearly similar energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTP-eC9, L8-BO and PY-IT do not lead to the unfavorable energy landscape for hole transfer and transport.

To figure out the miscibility and phase distribution of the quaternary materials, we calculated the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ and the wetting coefficient ω based on contact angle measurements (Fig. S4 and Tables S2, S3, ESI†). The χ values of PM6/L8-BO and BTP-eC9/L8-BO are 0.472 and 0.068, indicating better miscibility between L8-BO and BTP-eC9. The calculated ωL8-BO (−1.60) is smaller than −1 (if ωA1 < −1, the added acceptor A1 will lie in the phase of the host acceptor), which demonstrates that L8-BO is distributed into the BTP-eC9 phase to form well-mixed acceptor domains in the PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO ternary blends.39 The intermixed acceptor domains are beneficial for amplifying electron mobility and boosting more balanced charge transport. On this basis, the fourth component PB2F or PY-IT further proved to be located at the interfacial regions of PM6 and BTP-eC9:L8-BO, as manifested by an ωPB2F value of 0.71 and an ωPY-IT value of −0.98 (if −1< ωD2/A2 < 1, the added donor D2 or acceptor A2 will be distributed at the interfaces of the host donor and acceptor).40 Of note is that the interfacial location of PB2F or PY-IT can induce the formation of the additional channels for both charge transfer and transport,41,42 serving as the “charge bridge” involving multiphase morphologies in quaternary OSCs.
After interpreting the properties of these combined materials presented above, we first focus on the diffusion and annihilation dynamics of transient excitons in the BTP-eC9:L8-BO blends before and after continuous photothermal aging. The temperature of the blends was kept at 50–55 °C during measurements of photothermal stability. Fig. S5 (ESI†) exhibits the illumination spectrum of the white LEDs used in this study. Herein, the exciton–exciton annihilation method was utilized to identify long-range resonance interactions and collisional mechanisms of singlet excitons according to the results of ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy as below,24 
(1)where N is the density of excitons, G(t) is the rate of exciton generation, τ is the decay lifetime without exciton annihilation, β is the collisional coefficient involving diffusion-limited exciton bimolecular annihilation, and γ is the long-range annihilation coefficient related to resonance energy transfer. Details of this kinetic model are described in the ESI.† Fig. S6a and b (ESI†) presents the femtosecond-resolved TA spectra of the fresh and aged BTP-eC9:L8-BO blends probed in the wavelength range from 790 to 1250 nm, respectively. At a very low pump fluence, the excited state absorption (ESA) feature of singlet excitons at 880 nm displays a slow decay rate with less bimolecular exciton–exciton annihilation (Fig. S6c, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e), the enlarged pump fluence controls the decay rate of excitons throughout the BTP-eC9:L8-BO blends. We performed global fittings on a set of exciton decay traces by using the model mentioned above and the corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). With the increase of the initial exciton density, the collisional coefficient β gradually increases (Fig. 1(f)), whereas the long-range annihilation coefficient γ gradually decreases (Fig. 1(g)) in both fresh and aged blends. Together with the observed trend in β and γ, the larger order of magnitude of β relative to γ means the dominance of the collisional mechanisms in the annihilation dynamics of excitons. Meanwhile, long-range resonance interactions driven by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) also aggravate exciton trapping during the process of diffusion. Interestingly, the aged film exhibits overall greater annihilation rates and fluence dependence compared to the fresh one. Given that the higher photon fluxes can result in the emergence of local heating to strengthen the molecular vibration, we speculate that the enlarged exciton–phonon coupling is one of the primary factors for such annihilation characteristics after continuous photothermal aging.
Further analysis of the evolution of exciton–phonon coupling in both binary and quaternary blends was done by performing temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic measurements (Fig. 1(h), (i) and Fig. S7, ESI†). These PL spectra feature a gradually shifted peak position towards higher energy and spectral line broadening, with an increase in temperature. The exciton–phonon coupling interactions can be deduced from the temperature-dependent PL linewidths, which is quantitatively described by the following equation,43,44 
(2)where Γi is expressed as the inhomogeneous linewidth of the blends, a is regarded as the density of the non-radiative recombination center, Ea is considered to be the energy barrier of back charge recombination from electronic to excitonic excitations for Y-series NFAs,45 b is defined as the coefficient of exciton–phonon coupling. The detailed fitting results are presented in Fig. 1(j) and (k) as well as Table S5 (ESI†). The o-XY processed quaternary blend based on PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT displays reduced Γi and b values with respect to those of the binary PM6:BTP-eC9 film before and after photothermal aging, confirming more homogeneous morphologies and improved exciton–phonon decoupling characteristics after forming a “charge bridge”. Moreover, the enlarged Ea parameters in both fresh and aged quaternary blend films unravel the suppressed back charge recombination process from electronic to excitonic excitations with less generation of exciton-polarons.22 Hence, on the basis of the above kinetic analysis, a photophysical correlation picture between exciton–phonon decoupling and exciton and charge trapping has been well established before and after continuous photothermal aging (Fig. 1(l)). The concept and/or strategy of a “charge bridge” is successfully applicable to quaternary systems to promote exciton–phonon decoupling, which can dredge the pathways of the initial and increased exciton and charge trapping.
Then, we turn towards the analysis of the photophysical function of the proposed “charge bridge”. Steady-state PL, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and ultrafast TA spectroscopy were used to study the exciton and charge behaviors. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the BTP-eC9:L8-BO and BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT blend films exhibit a gradual decrease in the PL intensity and fluorescence lifetime relative to those of neat BTP-eC9, L8-BO and PY-IT films, indicating efficient charge and/or energy transfer between BTP-eC9 and L8-BO (PY-IT and BTP-eC9:L8-BO) in their interfacial region. Note that similar findings were also observed in the PM6:PB2F and PB2F:BTP-eC9:L8-BO blends. Next, the time evolution of exciton and charge dynamics following selective photoexcitation of NFAs in binary and quaternary blends was investigated by ultrafast TA spectroscopy (Fig. 2(a)–(c) and Fig. S9, ESI†). Fig. 2(d) and (c) displays the transient kinetics of ground state bleaching (GSB) signals at 630 nm for PM6, which reflects the population and depopulation process of the total excitonic and electronic excitations associated with hole transfer.46 The GSB features of quaternary systems take less time to reach their saturation and then exhibit slower decay rates compared to that of the binary blend, indicative of enhanced hole transfer and reduced charge recombination. The transient kinetics of excitons and polarons were analyzed by extracting the ESA signals at 880 and 960 nm, respectively. The accelerated decay of the exciton response at 880 nm within ten picoseconds (Fig. 2(f) and (g)) and the slower decay of polaron signals at 960 nm from tens of picoseconds to a few nanoseconds (Fig. 2(h) and (i)) further confirm efficient utilization of exciton and charge after forming a “charge bridge”, which is well consistent with the results of GSB features.

Based on the above observations of transient kinetics, we next explored the functional effects of the “charge bridge” on polaron trapping before and after photothermal aging. The polaron transient kinetics of both fresh and aged blend films are depicted in Fig. 2(j)–(l) and Fig. S10 (ESI†). The slower decay polaron kinetics in the aged binary film relative to the fresh one is mainly attributed to the formation of long-lived trapped polarons with enhanced charge trapping.22,23,47 Encouragingly, such severe charge trapping was substantially restrained in the aged quaternary blends. In addition, the polaron trapping and detrapping properties were further quantified through a residual charge recombination model as below,48 
(3)where n is the polaron density, N0 is the initial trapped polaron density, kT is the rate of polaron detrapping, and k is the rate of polaron recombination. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). The quaternary blends, especially for the o-XY processed films, present the less attenuated kT values together with the larger kT ratios before and after continuous photothermal aging relative to those of the binary film. These findings demonstrate that polarons can easily detrap from the shallow trap states after forming a “charge bridge” while the deep trap states induce the formation of highly localized trapped polarons in binary blends.49,50
We further examine the function of the “charge bridge” at the device level. Multiple-component OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/V2O5/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/PNDIT-F3N/Ag, where the bilayered hole and electron transport layers have already been confirmed in our previous work.22 The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), and the relevant performance parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The binary control devices based on PM6:BTP-eC9 processed by halogenated solvent chloroform (CF) present a high PCE of 18.11% with a VOC of 0.851 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.18 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.29%. As a comparison, two other binary reference solar cells based on PM6:L8-BO and PM6:PY-IT demonstrate the optimal PCEs of 18.09% (VOC = 0.860 V, JSC = 26.78 mA cm−2, FF = 78.55%) and 16.65% (VOC = 0.944 V, JSC = 23.45 mA cm−2, FF = 75.20%), respectively, which is comparable to those of previously reported studies.51,52 Moreover, details regarding the optimization of multiple-component OSCs can be found in the ESI.† The J–V curves and device parameters of the ternary and quaternary cells under various optimization conditions are shown in Fig. S11–S14 and Tables S7–S13 (ESI†). The addition of L8-BO or PY-IT gives rise to a slightly improved PCE (18.44% for PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO, 18.35% for PM6:BTP-eC9:PY-IT) for binary PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs by increasing the VOC, JSC and FF simultaneously. On this basis, a higher PCE of 18.82% (VOC = 0.862 V, JSC = 27.55 mA cm−2, FF = 79.25%) is obtained by introducing PY-IT into the optimal ternary PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO devices. Impressively, the quaternary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT present a superior PCE of 18.59% (VOC = 0.856 V, JSC = 27.43 mA cm−2, FF = 79.16%) when these cells are accomplished from the processing of the non-halogenated solvent o-xylene (o-XY). The results manifest that the “charge bridge” generated by PY-IT contributes to the improvements of PCE in the PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT cells. Notably, the high-performance quaternary OSCs based on the PM6:PB2F:BTP-eC9:L8-BO system are also achieved with superior PCEs of 18.77% (VOC = 0.863 V, JSC = 27.47 mA cm−2, FF = 79.18%) in CF and 18.56% (VOC = 0.859 V, JSC = 27.40 mA cm−2, FF = 78.84%) in o-XY, indicative of the role of the “charge bridge” constructed by PB2F in boosting the device efficiency. Besides, the statistical results further validate the efficacy of the proposed “charge bridge” approach in two types of quaternary OSCs (Fig. 3(c) and (d)).

According to the encouraging device performance, the PM6:BTP-eC9-based binary and two quaternary OSCs were chosen as the representative to investigate the origin of the elevated JSC, FF and VOC. As depicted in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results provide the intensifying spectral response in CF and o-XY processed quaternary OSCs, which is beneficial for the improved JSC values. The photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) manifests the enhanced properties of exciton dissociation and charge collection in these quaternary OPV cells (Fig. S15 and Table S14, ESI†). Together with optimal charge generation and extraction, the successful management of charge transport with enlarged hole and electron mobilities in quaternary OPV devices agrees well with the increases in JSC and FF (this will be discussed in detail in the stability part). As for the VOC increase, the Urbach energy (EU) was obtained to study the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap throughout the exponential fitting of the low photon energy region of the highly sensitive EQE curves measured by Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS-EQE).53–55 The quaternary cells present decreased energetic disorder with lower EU values compared to that of binary devices (Fig. 3(g), (h) and Fig. S16, S17, ESI†), accounting for the improvement of VOC. Additionally, the details of energy losses (Eloss) were further analyzed with a well-developed method described in the ESI.† The reduced Eloss, especially for non-radiative recombination energy loss (ΔEnonrad), echoes the suppressed energetic disorder (Fig. 3(g)–(i), Fig. S18 and Table S15, ESI†), contributing to higher VOC values of quaternary devices processed by CF and o-XY.
Considering the advantages of the “charge bridge” in boosting exciton–phonon decoupling, it is reasonable to anticipate that this approach could enhance device stability. Herein, to figure out the working conditions of the actual photovoltaic devices, we investigated the photothermal stability of OSCs under continuous illumination of a 100mWcm−2 white LED at 50–55 °C. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S19 (ESI†), a severe performance decrease is observed in binary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9, with a retention of about 53.4% of the initial average PCE values after photothermal aging for 500 h. Although the potential degradation of interface layers and change in the blend microstructure could not be excluded, the diffusion-enabled demixing of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend morphologies with unfavorable interface contact and decreased volume fraction of donor–acceptor components is mainly responsible for the FF-dominant degradation behaviors.17,18 In the case of quaternary systems, the CF processed OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT and PM6:PB2F:BTP-eC9:L8-BO maintain 65.0% and 62.9% of the initial PCE values with the same time frame (Fig. 4(a), (b) and Fig. S19, S20, ESI†), respectively. The results demonstrate that the “charge bridge” strategy could result in a better thermodynamic stabilized morphology to delay the evolution of a BHJ microstructure as discussed further on, thus enabling improved photovoltaic performance under synergistic photo and thermal stress. Interestingly, further improvements in photothermal stability were achieved in the o-XY processed quaternary OSCs, which retained 71.7% and 67.7% of their initial PCEs for PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO:PY-IT and PM6:PB2F:BTP-eC9:L8-BO, respectively. This phenomenon is possibly ascribed to the suppressed excessive aggregation and phase separation in comparison to solar cells processed from CF.56

Regarding the origin of FF-dominant performance degradation, the change in charge carrier mobilities before and after photothermal aging was quantified through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 4(c), Fig. S21 and Tables S16, S17, ESI†). Compared to the fresh binary devices, those quaternary OSCs demonstrate higher hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) as well as more balanced charge transport. After photothermal aging for 200 h, the aged binary cells present a substantial decrease in charge carrier mobilities, especially for electron mobility, indicating severe morphological attenuation. In contrast, the less degradation of both hole and electron mobilities validates the enhanced morphological stability in quaternary devices. On this basis, the energetic disorder for the hole (σh) and electron (σe) transport was evaluated through the measurements of temperature-dependent charge carrier mobilities with a Gaussian disorder model.57,58 As shown in Fig. 4(d)–(i), both fresh and aged quaternary OSCs exhibit smaller σh and σe values compared to those of binary control devices. The decreased energetic disorder for charge transport fundamentally stimulate the optoelectronic processes to yield improved device efficiency and photothermal stability in quaternary cells processed by CF and o-XY. In addition, we also investigated the information of density of states (DOS) for trap states and the related charge recombination mechanisms measured by impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 5). According to the Mott–Schottky method,59 the total density per unit volume (Nt), the energetic disorder parameter (σ) describing the broadening of DOS, and the energy center (Et) of DOS were estimated from the fitting results of the Gaussian shape distribution of DOS (Fig. 5(a)–(h) and Tables S18, S19, ESI†). The smaller Nt, Et and σ values manifest the suppressed increase of the trap density and depth as well as the broadening of trap DOS in fresh and aged quaternary cells, indicative of the application of the “charge bridge” strategy reducing charge trapping to promote an efficient photoelectric output under long-term device operation (Fig. 5(i)).

(i) Schematic diagram of exciton and charge trapping in binary and quaternary OSCs. 
Finally, to figure out the origin of improved exciton–phonon decoupling, we investigated the film's microstructure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to study the changes in the top surface morphologies of binary and quaternary photoactive layers before and after photothermal aging. As shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†), the application of a “charge bridge” helps to form more homogeneous and stable morphologies in quaternary blends by preventing the large phase separation observed in aged binary films, as evidenced by less root mean square (RMS) roughness. The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique was employed to analyze the thin-film microstructure and crystallinity. The two-dimensional (2D) diffraction patterns and one-dimensional (1D) line-cut curves are displayed in Fig. 6 and Fig. S23 (ESI†). All blends feature a preferentially face-on orientation on the basis of the dominant (010) π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and lamellar peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction. Both fresh and aged quaternary blends demonstrate higher crystallinity as revealed by larger crystalline coherence length (CCL) values (Table S20, ESI†). The results manifest that the presence of a “charge bridge” strengthens BHJ microstructural stability by optimizing intermolecular interactions with suppressed molecular vibrations. Interestingly, it is found that the o-XY processed quaternary blend retains better crystallinity than that processed from CF after photothermal aging, which is possibly ascribed to more stable donor–acceptor aggregations with decreased diffusion-enabled demixing for the films processed from high-boiling-point solvents.60

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a “charge bridge” approach for adding PY-IT or PB2F into the PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO ternary blend to dredge exciton and charge carrier trapping pathways by facilitating exciton–phonon decoupling behaviors in quaternary OSCs. Notably, desirable improvements in the device efficiency and photothermal stability were achieved in two types of quaternary OSCs made from both halogenated and non-halogenated solvents. The detailed analysis of device physics confirms that this approach restrains the initial and increased energetic disorder and density/depth of trap states induced additionally by photothermal aging with a decrease in the nonradiative voltage loss. As evidenced by a series of in-depth spectroscopic investigations, the constructed “charge bridge” gives rise to enhanced charge transfer and transport as well as reduced photocarrier recombination rates, thus utilizing excitons and charges efficiently. Furthermore, regarding the degradation mechanism, exciton diffusion and annihilation dynamics demonstrate that the collisional interactions constitute a primary trapping pathway with intensified exciton–phonon coupling properties in the acceptor phase after photothermal aging. The results from the temperature-dependent PL linewidths manifest the positive impact of the “charge bridge” on suppressing exciton–phonon coupling in quaternary systems. Such a photophysical scheme mainly comes from the optimized morphology with intensified crystallinity and suppressed molecular vibration in quaternary blends. Our findings highlight the role of exciton–phonon decoupling in controlling photocarrier trapping in high-performance OSCs based on Y-series NFAs. These insights provide helpful guidelines for further improving the operational stability of OPV devices.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors have achieved remarkable progress with the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing 19%. This progress increases the commercial potential of organic photovoltaics. However, to enable the practical application of OSCs, one of the key challenges is to obtain high device efficiencies with sufficient operational lifetime. Especially, it is challenging to achieve superior photothermal stability with currently reported highly-efficient OSCs. Moreover, fundamental identification of degradation mechanisms under continuous photothermal stress is still missing. Herein, we revealed the accelerated nonradiative trapping of excitons and charge as a result of the intensified exciton–phonon interactions induced by photothermal aging with the help of the exciton–exciton annihilation approach. A feasible strategy of the “charge bridge” for charge transfer and transport through the interfacial region was proposed to dredge photocarrier trapping pathways by facilitating exciton–phonon decoupling of bulk heterojunctions. Ultimately, the “charge bridge” strategy yields simultaneously improved PCEs and photothermal stability in two types of quaternary OSCs processed from both halogenated and non-halogenated solvents. The proposed strategy of decoupling the exciton–phonon interactions provides helpful photophysical insights toward developing efficient and stable organic photovoltaic cells.
