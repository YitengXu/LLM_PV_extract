    , Accepted 19th June 2018First published on 19th June 2018AbstractTraditional nickel/yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) electrodes have been widely used as the cathode in a solid oxide electrolysis cell due to its high performance. However, Ni/YSZ cathodes are usually considered to be easily oxidized during pure CO2 electrolysis at high temperature, so a reductive gas such as H2 or CO is mixed with pure CO2 to protect the Ni/YSZ cathode from being oxidized. The real necessity of a reductive gas has not been systematically confirmed yet. Herein, stable pure CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode is achieved at 1.5 V and 700 °C for 60 hours without any reductive gas. In situ electroreduction of the nickel oxide/yttria stabilized zirconia electrode and theoretical calculations suggest that the electrolysis voltage provides continuous electrons across the Ni/YSZ cathode and diminishes Ni oxidation in pure CO2 electrolysis. In addition, the electrochemical performance of CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode without a reductive gas is verified to be higher than that with a reductive gas. Therefore, pure CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode not only operates stably, but also possesses high electrochemical performance.
Introduction
High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have been utilized in CO2 electrolysis for at least half a century. They were first employed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to produce O2 for space missions to Mars in the mid-1960s,1,2 making use of the abundant CO2 atmosphere of Mars. In the mid-1990s, Sridhar et al.3 attempted to employ a solid oxide cell (SOC) as an energy storage and conversion device, through running the SOC in electrolysis mode to produce syngas (CO + H2) during the daylight and in fuel cell mode to generate electricity at night. Nowadays, due to the record-breaking emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere caused by increasing global consumption of fossil fuels, more and more research interest has been focused on high-temperature SOECs again for their ability to convert CO2 to CO powered by renewable energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, etc.,4–6 as shown in Fig. S1.† Therefore, SOECs can not only convert CO2 into valuable chemicals acting as a carbon-neutral technology but also provide an alternative storage method for intermittent sustainable energy.
Nickel/yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) is widely used as a cathode material of SOECs due to its excellent electronic and ionic conductivity, high catalytic activity, low cost and appropriate thermal expansion coefficient.7–11 Apart from Ni/YSZ, perovskite oxides have also been screened as cathode materials, such as (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ,12–14 La0.35Sr0.65TiO3−δ,15 La0.6Sr0.4VO3−δ,16,17 Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ18,19 and so on. Compared to the Ni/YSZ composite electrode, these perovskite oxides have relatively high mixed electronic and ionic conductivity, superior redox stability, and excellent resistance to carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning. However, the CO2 electrolysis performance of perovskite cathodes has not yet reached that of the Ni/YSZ cathode due to the limited electrocatalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Thus, Ni/YSZ is still the most practically used cathode material of SOECs for CO2 electrolysis.20–22
The Ni/YSZ cathode is usually considered to be easily oxidized to inactive nickel oxide/yttria stabilized zirconia (NiO/YSZ) by CO2, resulting in electrolysis performance degradation and even whole cell failure. Therefore, almost all of the high-temperature CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode has been performed under the protection of a reductive gas such as H2 or CO, as listed in Table S1.† Mixing a protective gas with a pure CO2 reactant not only augments the complexity of the cathodic reaction but also increases the operation cost of SOEC for CO2 electrolysis. Therefore, excluding the reductive gas from the CO2 reactant is of great significance for the development of SOEC technology. It is known that numerous electrons are conducted to the Ni/YSZ electrode continuously under the drive of electrolysis voltage to triple phase boundaries (TPBs) during CO2 electrolysis, which creates an electroreducing atmosphere at the cathode and probably could diminish Ni oxidation. Until now, only few reports have demonstrated a stable performance for pure CO2 electrolysis by coating a Pd/GDC or PdCe/GDC catalyst nanonetwork on the Ni/YSZ scaffold and using a hierarchically ordered porous cathode structure.23,24 In this work, we systematically explored the necessity of a reductive gas and the effect of electrolysis voltage on the stability of the Ni/YSZ cathode for pure CO2 electrolysis. A stable pure CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode was achieved at 1.5 V and 700 °C for 60 hours without any reductive gas. In situ electroreduction characterization of the NiO/YSZ electrode and theoretical calculations suggest that the electrolysis voltage effectively diminishes the oxidation of the Ni/YSZ cathode during pure CO2 electrolysis.
Experimental section
Material preparation and cell fabrication
Planar NiO/YSZ-supported SOECs were used for all the experiments. The cells consisted of a porous NiO/YSZ cathode support (≈650 μm thickness), NiO/YSZ cathode (≈15 μm thickness), dense thin YSZ electrolyte (≈10 μm thickness), and LSM/YSZ + RuO2 anode (≈40 μm thickness) (YSZ = 8 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2, Tosoh; LSM = (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95MnO3±δ, SOFCMAN).
Powders of NiO (Alfa Aesar), YSZ and potato starch (Macklin) were ball-milled in a weight ratio of 40:40:20 for 24 hours with appropriate amounts of ethanol. The substrate was fabricated by dry pressing 1.6 g powder mixture and then sintered at 1000 °C for 8 hours. Likewise, powders of NiO and YSZ were ball-milled in a weight ratio of 50:50 for 24 hours with desired amounts of ethanol. After drying, certain amounts of solvent (α-terpineol, Alfa Aesar), binder (ethyl cellulose, SECOMA) and dispersant (S-28000, Shanghai Kaikai chemicals) were added to the mixed powders to form a NiO/YSZ slurry by ultrasonic dispersion. The thin NiO/YSZ electrode was prepared by spin-coating the NiO/YSZ slurry onto the substrate and subsequent sintering at 1000 °C for 8 hours. YSZ powders were ball-milled for 12 hours with ethanol. After drying, proper amounts of solvent (α-terpineol), binder (ethyl cellulose) and dispersant (S-28000) were ultrasonically mixed with the ball-milled YSZ powders. The resulting suspension was spin-coated onto the surface of the NiO/YSZ electrode, followed by firing at 1300 °C for 8 hours. An LSM/YSZ slurry was prepared using the same method of NiO/YSZ slurry preparation. The mixture was screen-printed on the YSZ electrolyte and sintered at 1150 °C for 2 hours. The RuO2 infiltrated LSM/YSZ anode was prepared by impregnation of the Ru(NO)(NO3)3 (Ru 1.5% w/v, Alfa Aesar) solution into the LSM/YSZ layer to reach a RuO2 weight ratio of 4 wt%. The infiltrated electrode was finally fired at 500 °C for 1 hour. The active area of the anode is 0.5 cm2.
Physicochemical characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings were obtained on a JSM-7800F field emission scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was collected on a PANalytical X'pert PPR diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å), operating at 40 mA and 40 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using an Al Kα X-ray source and a pass energy of 20 eV. The C 1s peak located at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the binding energy position. Raman spectrum measurements were carried out on a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
The SOECs were tested on a home-made testing station, as shown in Fig. S2.† Briefly, Au meshes were adopted as current collectors for both the cathode and anode, and Au wires welded on current collecting meshes acted as the current and voltage probes, respectively. For performance and stability tests, H2 was first supplied to the cathode at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 to reduce the NiO/YSZ electrode fully at 700 °C, and then 95% CO2 + 5% N2 (CO2: 99.999%, DALIAN SPECIAL GASESCO., LTD; N2: 99.999%, DALIAN SPECIAL GASESCO., LTD. 5% N2 in the reactant gas is used to calculate the faradaic efficiency of CO as an internal standard gas) was switched to the cathode at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The anode was fed with ambient air at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1. For the in situ electroreduction experiment, the reactant gas was conducted to the cathode directly without the pre-reduction of the NiO/YSZ electrode in H2, and then different electrolysis voltages were applied between the two electrodes. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and chronoamperometry measurements were obtained using an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT 302N). The J–V curves were measured at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The AC impedance measurements were carried out at OCV or 1.5 V in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV. The stability of the SOEC was evaluated by monitoring the output current density at a cell voltage of 1.5 V. Quantification of the gas products was performed on an on line gas chromatograph (Agilent 490 Micro GC). After the stability test, the gas in the cathode of the SOEC was switched from CO2 to Ar at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 until the cell was cooled down to room temperature.
Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional25 in a plane wave pseudopotential implementation26 using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27 The Monkhorst–Pack scheme was used for sampling the Brillouin zone.28 A cutoff energy of 520 eV for the plane-wave basis set was employed. The method of Methfessel–Paxton (MP) with a smearing width of 0.20 eV was adopted for Ni bulk and surface calculations.29
For Ni bulk calculations, a face-centered cubic model, i.e. a 1 × 1 × 1 unit cell including 4 Ni atoms with a k-mesh sampling of 8 × 8 × 8 was adopted. For Ni surface calculations, we considered three typical low Miller index surfaces namely (111), (100), and (110) surfaces with k-mesh sampling of 5 × 5 × 1, 5 × 5 × 1, 3 × 5 × 1, respectively. To describe these three kinds of surfaces, 2 × 2 Ni 4-layers slabs with vacuum layers larger than 15 Å were used.
We calculated the theoretical equilibrium voltage from the Gibbs free energy through a thermodynamic relation. We calculated the free energy with the formula below:G = EDFT + ZPE + δH − TSwhere EDFT, ZPE, δH and S are the total energy from DFT calculations, zero point energy, integrated heat capacity up to 973.15 K and entropy, respectively. T is the temperature and equals 973.15 K. ZPE was calculated with the formula below:  where εi is the energy associated with the calculated vibrational frequency (νi) from DFT calculations; εi = hνi.
For gas phase species, the S and δH values were cited from the standard database.30 For other species, the entropy and integrated heat capacity up to 973.15 K were calculated with the formula below:    where kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Results and discussion
The SEM image of the NiO/YSZ cathode-supported SOEC is shown in Fig. 1A. The thin dense electrolyte layer is sandwiched between the porous cathode and anode. Fig. 1B presents the J–V curves for pure CO2 electrolysis from open circuit voltage (OCV) to 1.6 V at 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C. The OCV at 700 °C, 750 °C and 800 °C is 0.747 V, 0.724 V and 0.703 V, which is close to the calculated Nernst potential (0.749 V, 0.725 V and 0.701 V, as listed in Table S2†). At a voltage below 0.9 V, a peak arises along the J–V curve and the peak position shifts to a lower voltage with increasing the temperature, which is probably related to the activation of electrodes. At a voltage above 0.9 V, the J–V curves are approximately linear and J values at a certain voltage typically increase with temperature, as generally observed for SOECs.31,32 For instance, the current density at a voltage of 1.4 V is 0.252 A cm−2 at 700 °C, 0.526 A cm−2 at 750 °C and 0.927 A cm−2 at 800 °C for pure CO2 electrolysis, which are comparable to the results of CO2 electrolysis using CO as the protective gas reported by Ebbesen.8

EIS at different temperatures are displayed in Fig. 1C. The highest frequency intercept of the EIS on the real-axis corresponds to the ohmic resistance (RΩ) of the cell, which mainly originates from the resistance of ionic transportation in the electrolyte, while the distance between the highest and the lowest frequency intercepts corresponds to the total polarization resistance (Rp). It is worth noting that the total polarization resistance is generally associated with the charge transfer through the interface of the electrolyte and electrode, dissociative adsorption and species transfer at the triple phase boundaries and gas diffusion process.33–35 Obviously, RΩ changes slightly with temperature, while Rp significantly decreases with increasing the temperature from 700 °C to 800 °C, suggesting that high temperature is able to activate the polarization processes of electrodes and improve the electrocatalytic activity of the composite electrodes, as shown in Fig. 1B.
To investigate the stability of the Ni/YSZ cathode for pure CO2 electrolysis, chronoamperometry measurements were performed at 1.5 V and 700 °C, and the products collected from the cathode compartment were analyzed with an on line micro gas chromatograph. As shown in Fig. 1D, the current density remains stable at about 0.330 A cm−2 for 60 hours. Meanwhile, the corresponding faradaic efficiencies of the CO product fluctuate slightly around 100% during the whole stability test. The stable current density and high faradaic efficiencies prove the capability of the Ni/YSZ electrode for converting CO2 to CO with negligible degradation without the protection of a reductive gas.

Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of the Ni/YSZ electrode before and after the stability test. The NiO/YSZ electrode can be reduced to Ni/YSZ cathode under H2 atmosphere,36 and thus diffraction peaks of YSZ and metallic Ni were collected in the XRD pattern before the stability test. After CO2 electrolysis for 60 hours, no diffraction peak of NiO is observed, while the diffraction peaks of YSZ and metallic Ni remain almost unchanged, indicating that the Ni/YSZ cathode could work stably in pure CO2 electrolysis at 1.5 V and 700 °C. In order to confirm the change of the valence state of Ni, the XPS spectra of Ni 2p in the Ni/YSZ electrode before and after the stability test were obtained and are shown in Fig. 2B. The peak located at the binding energy of ∼852.6 eV is assigned to metallic Ni (Ni0),37,38 while the peaks at ∼854.1 eV and 856.0 eV are ascribed to NiO.39,40 In the Ni/YSZ electrode after H2 reduction treatment, the existence of NiO was probably due to surface re-oxidation of Ni species after exposure to air,41,42 however, the majority of Ni species remained in the metallic state with a slight decrease in the intensity of the Ni0 peak after the stability test.

Fig. 2C presents the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the Ni/YSZ electrode before and after the stability test. Before the pure CO2 electrolysis test, Ni particles are relatively uniformly distributed in the composite electrode with a particle size of 0.5–1.0 μm. However, Ni granules agglomerated to a larger particle size of 1.5–2.0 μm after the stability test. In addition, carbon deposition was not observed on the surface or cross-section of the cathode after the stability test. As shown in Fig. 2D, typical peaks of carbon deposition at 1338 (D band) and 1568 cm−1 (G band) were not detected, indicating that no carbon deposition was observed after pure CO2 electrolysis.
To further demonstrate that the Ni/YSZ cathode remains stable in pure CO2 electrolysis at 1.5 V and 700 °C, in situ electroreduction of the NiO/YSZ composite electrode was conducted. Pure CO2 was supplied to the NiO/YSZ cathode directly, while air was fed to the anode. Then an electrolysis voltage of 1.5 V was applied between the two electrodes at 700 °C, and EIS were recorded to investigate the changes of the NiO/YSZ electrode during the whole process. As shown in Fig. 3, the decrease of RΩ and Rp is distinct in the first 1000 s and slows down in the last 1200 s. Finally, RΩ and Rp are decreased to 0.164 Ω cm2 and 2.12 Ω cm2, respectively, which are in good agreement with RΩ and Rp of the Ni/YSZ electrode with pre-reduction by H2 as shown in Fig. 1C, indicating that metallic Ni is probably generated after in situ electroreduction of the NiO/YSZ electrode. To prove this assumption, XRD patterns of the NiO/YSZ cathode before and after in situ electroreduction are collected and are shown in Fig. 4A. Apparently, the diffraction peaks of metallic Ni appear and the intensity of the diffraction peaks of NiO decreases after in situ electroreduction, suggesting that parts of NiO particles are converted to metallic Ni during the in situ electroreduction process, which is further confirmed by XPS results in Fig. 4B. The show up of the Ni0 peak in Ni 2p XPS spectra proves the existence of metallic Ni in the in situ electroreduced cathode.43,44 The generated metallic Ni particles indicate that parts of NiO particles in the NiO/YSZ electrode are not stable and inclined to be electroreduced to metallic Ni in the pure CO2 atmosphere at 1.5 V and 700 °C.

As for the NiO particles that still exist in the cathode after the in situ electroreduction process, two possible explanations are proposed. One is the core–shell model. Namely, the in situ electroreduction reaction only takes place on the surface of NiO particles, so the remnant NiO remains in the core of the particle while metallic Ni occupies the shell, denoted as NiO@Ni. The other is the circuit model. That is to say, the NiO/YSZ electrode possesses two kinds of NiO particles, as shown in Fig. 4C. One is located along the yellow lines forming a connected circuit, denoted as NiO-c, so they could be electroreduced when a suitable electrolysis voltage is applied; the other is situated in the red circle surrounded by YSZ particles, denoted as NiO-s, and therefore, they would not be electroreduced or need a higher voltage.
EDS mappings are collected from the in situ electroreduced cathode, and two kinds of particles are observed in the cathode after in situ electroreduction as shown in Fig. 5. In the region where particle α exists, only a signal of Ni is examined, identifying the presence of metallic Ni in Fig. 5A. However, in Fig. 5B, signals of O and Ni co-exist in region β, which confirms that the particle β is NiO. The simultaneous appearance of Ni and NiO particles in the cathode after in situ electroreduction suggests that the circuit model is more rational. As we can see, the NiO/YSZ electrode is liable to be electroreduced to Ni/YSZ in the pure CO2 atmosphere at 1.5 V and 700 °C. Therefore, the oxidation of Ni/YSZ can be diminished during pure CO2 electrolysis at 1.5 V and 700 °C, otherwise, the generated NiO/YSZ would be electroreduced to Ni/YSZ again.
 Fig. 5  EDS mappings of the NiO/YSZ cathode after electroreduction. 
The evolution of EIS during the stability test can provide direct information on the chemical state of the Ni species. Therefore, we repeated the pure CO2 electrolysis with a new cell with the same composition and structure as that used in Fig. 1, and monitored the evolution of EIS at 1.5 V and 700 °C about every 12 hours, as shown in Fig. S3.† The current density is maintained at ∼0.356 A cm−2 during the stability test, which is close to the current density in Fig. 1D. The RΩ increased from 0.291 to 0.368 Ω cm2 after the stability test, which probably resulted from the gradual oxidation of Ni-s and the partial oxidation of surface Ni-c under CO2 atmosphere. The Rp decreased from 0.857 to 0.744 Ω cm2 after the stability test. EDS mappings of the Ni/YSZ cathode after the stability test were collected and are shown in Fig. S4.† The Ni particle marked by the rectangle remained metallic because no O signal was observed obviously, while the particle marked by the circle was oxidized to NiO as the Ni signal was overlapped by the O signal. It is noteworthy that the oxidized Ni particle marked by the circle is surrounded by YSZ particles, indicating that Ni-s was likely to be oxidized while the bulk of Ni-c remained metallic during pure CO2 electrolysis.
In order to explore the factors that make the Ni/YSZ cathode work stably in pure CO2 electrolysis, controlled experiments were conducted as follows: the NiO/YSZ electrode was first reduced in H2 for 1.5 h at 700 °C, and then pure CO2 was supplied continually to the cathode at OCV and 700 °C for 24 hours. XRD patterns and XPS spectra were collected to investigate the changes of the cathode. As shown in Fig. 6A, the NiO/YSZ electrode was reduced to Ni/YSZ after treatment in H2 for 1.5 hours. However, Ni/YSZ was oxidized back to NiO/YSZ by pure CO2 without applying an electrolysis voltage, which is also confirmed by the XPS results (Fig. 6B). Therefore, the applied electrolysis voltage is vital to stabilize the Ni/YSZ electrode in pure CO2 electrolysis. It is well known that numerous electrons are transported to the cathode during pure CO2 electrolysis, which creates an electroreducing environment45,46 to diminish the oxidation of the Ni/YSZ electrode. Moreover, the generated CO could also stabilize the Ni/YSZ electrode. Therefore, the electrolysis voltage is beneficial for the stable operation of Ni/YSZ in pure CO2 electrolysis at high temperature.
 Fig. 6  (A) XRD patterns and (B) Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra of the NiO/YSZ electrode after treatment under different atmospheres. 
To specify the electrolysis voltage above which the oxidation of the Ni/YSZ cathode could be diminished in pure CO2 electrolysis, in situ electroreduction of the NiO/YSZ electrode in pure CO2 at different voltages is conducted as shown in Fig. 7A. At the voltage of 0.5 V, 0.7 V and 0.9 V, current densities decrease with time on stream and no CO is detected. When the voltage is increased to 1.1 V, current density decreases first and then begins to increase gradually, which indicates the occurrence of electroreduction of NiO particles, but CO is still not detected until the current density reaches a relatively high value. Therefore, the Ni/YSZ electrode can maintain pure CO2 electrolysis when the electrolysis voltage is higher than 1.1 V for the Ni/YSZ-supported SOEC. To demonstrate the electrolysis voltage limit of 1.1 V, pure CO2 electrolysis over the Ni/YSZ cathode at 0.9 V and 1.3 V was performed at 700 °C, as shown in Fig. 7B. At 1.3 V (>1.1 V), the Ni/YSZ cathode showed a stable performance in pure CO2 electrolysis for 100 hours, while at 0.9 V (<1.1 V), the Ni/YSZ cathode became deactivated within 24 hours, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 7A.

The electrolysis voltage limit is further verified by theoretical calculations. As shown in Fig. 8, the blue bars represent the thermodynamic equilibrium potential calculated with HSC chemistry software for CO2 and NiO electrolysis, respectively, which decreases with increasing the cell temperature (Fig. S5†). The green bar represents the experimental potential for NiO electrolysis. Red bars stand for voltages needed for oxygen desorption on Ni(111), Ni(100), and Ni(110) surfaces under a coverage of 25% and 50%, which are obtained via DFT calculations combined with atomic thermodynamics. The thermodynamic equilibrium potential of NiO electrolysis is lower than that of CO2 electrolysis, and the experimental value of NiO electrolysis is higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium potential, indicating that NiO is more apt to be electroreduced than CO2 and that the overall electroreduction reaction from NiO to Ni is thermodynamically favored. To make this result more convincing, we considered the process of oxygen desorption from a series of low Miller index Ni surfaces, i.e. Ni(111), Ni(100), and Ni(110), as shown by the six red bars in Fig. 8. The extra Gibbs free energy for oxygen desorption denoted in green circles was converted into potential through thermodynamic relations. Under different coverages, i.e. 25% and 50%, the theoretical potential required for oxygen desorption from Ni surfaces is comparable with the experimental potentials for CO2 and NiO electrolysis, from which we can infer that the Ni surfaces could remain unoxidized when the electrolysis voltage is above 1.1 V.

The slab models used in DFT calculations are shown above the respective bars. The oxygen atoms to desorb are marked in green circles. 
Moreover, to reveal the difference between the electrochemical protection by the electrolysis voltage and chemical protection by the reductive gas of the Ni/YSZ cathode for CO2 electrolysis, pure CO2 with 5% N2, H2 or CO (50 mL min−1) was used as the reactant gas for the Ni/YSZ electrode. The electrochemical results are shown in Fig. 9. Obviously, the current density decreases with the addition of the reductive gas in the reactant, which suggests that the electrochemical performance of CO2 electrolysis protected by the electrolysis voltage is higher than that protected by the reductive gas.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated pure CO2 electrolysis over a Ni/YSZ cathode for 60 hours without a reductive gas in an SOEC. XRD and XPS results in combination with electrochemical measurements showed that metallic Ni existed in the Ni/YSZ cathode after the stability test. In situ electroreduction experiments and theoretical calculation results indicated that the Ni/YSZ cathode could work stably in pure CO2 electroreduction under the protection of an electrolysis voltage. In addition, control experiments demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of pure CO2 electrolysis was superior to that with a reductive gas. Therefore the present work not only simplifies the application of SOECs, but also increases the performance of CO2 electrolysis.
