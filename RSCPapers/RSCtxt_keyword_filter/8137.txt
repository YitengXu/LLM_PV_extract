    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 30th June 2018AbstractSupramolecular self-assembly of a novel acceptor–π–porphyrin–π–acceptor compound driven by intermolecular sulfur–sulfur interactions leads to the formation of J-aggregates composed of helical nanowire structures. These nanowires have exhibited interesting optical activity, and when utilized as a molecular electron donor with a fullerene acceptor in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, a high photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of over 8% has been achieved.
Introduction
Supramolecular self-assembly of electron donor and acceptor molecules, which leads to the formation of nanoscaled bicontinuous interpenetrated networks, has been utilized to control photogenerated charge diffusion and transport to improve the photovoltaic properties of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs).1 These donor and acceptor molecules may form J-aggregates with stacked, inline orientation of transition dipole moments.2,3 With a fullerene acceptor and an apposite molecular donor, a highly ordered composite film may result, providing efficient pathways for the diffusion, separation and transport of photoinduced excitons. This would eliminate the energy loss arising from charge recombination and high serial resistance to a great extent.4–6 They may also form H-aggregates exhibiting a columnar stacking mode with parallel transition dipole moments, leading to charge recombination complications.7 The supramolecular aggregation phenomenon would thus be expected to have a profound effect on the performance of BHJ OSCs. In the active layers of BHJ OSCs, both the H and J-aggregates can be induced under processing conditions.8,9 With suitable porphyrin derivatives as donor molecules, formation of H- and J-aggregates was also reversible, thus offering an opportunity by fine-tuning processing conditions for performance optimization.10 While manipulation of donor and acceptor aggregates via processing has been demonstrated, studies directed toward structurally induced H- or J-aggregation for OSC performance enhancement have been sporadic. This is primarily due to the complexity in the phase separation and supramolecular self-assembly behaviours of donor and acceptor molecules in the active layers, thus the difficulty in establishing a predictive structure–property correlation. Accordingly, understanding the structural effects on the supramolecular self-assembly behaviour of a specific class of donors or acceptors would be important for the development of desirable active materials for BHJ OSCs.
Intermolecular sulfur–sulfur (S–S) interactions of alkylthio substituents of organic molecules such as donor–acceptor polymers have been observed to exhibit supramolecular self-assembly behaviors in the active layer of BHJ OSCs.11,12 However, alkylthio incorporation into an acceptor–π–porphyrin–π–acceptor (A–π–porphyrin–π–A) molecular compound to induce supramolecular self-assembly for photovoltaic performance has never been explored, despite the fact that porphyrin derivatives have emerged as promising donor materials for BHJ OSCs.13–17 In view of this, we designed and synthesized two A–π–porphyrin–π–A molecules, Por-S and Por-C, with respectively 2,5-dihexylthiophenylene and 2,5-dihexylphenylene π-linkages (see Scheme 1) to study the substituent effects of π-linkages on the supramolecular self-assembly and thus on photovoltaic properties. Both Por-S and Por-C were observed to exhibit interesting ground-state helical geometries, resulting in the formation of optical active spiral nanoaggregates in their solution-processed thin films. However, only Por-S afforded predominantly J-aggregates in its pristine film or composite film with PC71BM. These results were attributed to the supramolecular self-assembly of Por-S induced by intermolecular S–S interactions of its 2,5-dihexylthiophenylene π-linkages. The ability of Por-S to undergo supramolecular self-assembly to form J-aggregates had enabled higher photovoltaic performance when it was utilized in conjunction with PC71BM in BHJ OSCs. A high photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% was achieved. The present study thus represents a pioneering exploration of the structural engineering of porphyrin active materials to induce supramolecular J-aggregation for enhanced photovoltaic properties.

Results and discussion
Two new A–π–porphyrin–π–A porphyrin derivatives, Por-S and Por-C, were respectively synthesized via condensation of respective bis(formaldehyde) intermediates, 1 and 2, with two equivalents of 3-ethylrhodanine according to Scheme 1. Details of their syntheses and characterizations are presented in the ESI.†
Molecular simulation studies were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with the molecular geometry optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09 Rev D.01 (ref. 18) to shed light on the structural conformation properties of Por-S and Por-C. Previous theoretical calculations of porphyrin derivatives using this strategy have been shown to be consistent with experimental data.19,20 The results of our simulation studies showed that both Por-S and Por-C molecules assumed a spirally twisted backbone conformation (Fig. 1). Por-S displayed a molecularly twisted structure with a relatively wide dihedral angle of 74° between its two terminal acceptor moieties, while Por-C showed a smaller dihedral angle of 54°.

In thin films spin coated from their chlorobenzene solutions, Por-S and Por-C formed nanoaggregates with distinctively different structural features. The high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that Por-S formed nanoaggregate domains of relatively uniform size with a narrow size distribution (Fig. 2a). The nanoaggregate domains of Por-C, on the other hand, varied greatly in size and were randomly dispersed in a continuous amorphous phase (Fig. 2b). In the thin films of Por-S and Por-C fabricated via drop-down coating, nanoaggregates of helical structures in the form of nanowires were observed, and this was likely driven by the spiral conformations of these compounds as revealed in the theoretical DFT simulation. The nanowires of Por-S appeared to be relatively uniform in size with an average diameter of ca. 25 nm and composed of strongly held nanoparticles (Fig. 2c). For Por-C, the nanowires varied in size from ca. 10 to 50 nm, together with some loose particle dispersions (Fig. 2d). The fact that Por-S exhibited much more orderly and uniform aggregation could be attributed to the presence of strong intermolecular S–S interactions.
 Fig. 2  High-resolution scanning electron microscope images of spin coated thin films of (a) Por-S and (b) Por-C (insert: size distribution of nanoaggregates); drop-down coated thin films of (c) Por-S and (d) Por-C; and circular dichroism spectra of thin films of (e) Por-S and (f) Por-C fabricated by drop-down (red lines) and spin coating (blue lines) methods. 
Support for the helical structures of nanoaggregates was provided by circular dichroism (CD) measurements, showing that they were optically active. Both the Por-S and Por-C thin films fabricated from drop-down coating afforded distinct optical activities with a positive peak at ∼500 nm and a negative peak at ∼540 nm (Fig. 2e and f, red lines). On the other hand, their spin-coated films exhibited optical activities in the opposite directions (Fig. 2e and f, blue lines). These results clearly supported the helical nature of the nanoaggregates as well as the sensitivity of optical activity and thus the direction of helical structures of nanoaggregates to processing conditions.
In dilute chloroform solutions, both Por-S and Por-C displayed essentially similar UV-vis spectral absorption features (Fig. 3a). Por-S showed a Soret band at 478 nm with a shoulder at 446 nm, and a Q band at 722 nm, while Por-C provided a Soret band at 474 nm with a shoulder at 442 nm and a Q band at 709 nm. In thin films spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution with 2 vol% pyridine21,22 (Fig. 3b), Por-C displayed spectral features which were quite similar to those of its solution spectrum, except slight broadening and red-shifts of absorption bands. In contrast, Por-S exhibited significant broadening and red shifts of Soret and Q bands, together with a well-resolved shoulder peak at 480 nm. This could be attributed to a significantly large extent of J-aggregation induced by strong intermolecular S–S interaction of its alkylthio side-chains since no noticeable J-aggregation was noted in the Por-C thin film.23–27

A thermally annealed composite thin film of Por-S with PC71BM (∼1:1.2 by weight) fabricated from chlorobenzene solution with 2 vol% pyridine displayed narrower absorption bands in both Soret and Q bands (Fig. 3c, blue line; TA) in comparison with its pristine film. When the thermally annealed film was exposed to tetrahydrofuran (THF) vapour for 20 s, distinct vibronic splitting peaks for both Soret and Q bands were observed (Fig. 3c, red line; SVA-TA). In addition, the intensity of their Q-band 0-0 vibrational peak was stronger than that of the 1-0 vibrational peak. The facts suggested a high degree of molecular ordering from J-aggregation in the Por-S/PC71BM composite film. In contrast, the Soret and Q bands of the Por-C/PC71BM composite film showed no visible signs of vibronic splitting even after thermal annealing and exposure to THF vapour under similar conditions, suggestive of no particular molecular ordering in the thin film (Fig. 3d).
2-D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies were conducted to gain insight into the nanostructural details of Por-S and Por-C in pristine and composite films with PC71BM under different processing conditions. For the pristine Por-S and Por-C films, two distinct lamellar peaks (100) and (200) within 10 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction, and a small π–π stacking peak (010) at ∼15–18 nm−1 in the in-plane direction were observed (Fig. 4a, d, g and j). These results were attributable to the preferential “edge-on” orientation of the porphyrin derivatives. In the thermally annealed Por-S/PC71BM and Por-C/PC71BM composite films (Fig. 4b, e, h and k), both the lamellar stacking peaks (100) and (200) and the π–π stacking peak (010) were observed in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions. In addition, additional broad scattering peaks at ∼14 nm−1 and ∼20 nm−1 arising from the amorphous domains of PC71BM and disordered porphyrin donor molecules were noted. These results clearly manifested significant disorders and random orientation of porphyrin crystalline domains in the thermally treated composite films.

When the thermally annealed Por-S/PC71BM composite film was exposed to THF vapour for 20 s, retention of lamellar scattering (100) and (200) peaks and disappearance of the π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction, with concomitant reduction of (100) and (200) peaks and the retention of the (010) peak in the in-plane direction were observed (Fig. 4c and i). These results clearly demonstrated the ability of Por-S in recovering its preferential “edge-on” orientation with significantly reduced amorphous phase upon exposure to THF vapour. In contrast, only slight changes in the scattering patterns of the thermally annealed Por-C/PC71BM film were noted upon THF vapour exposure as seen in Fig. 4fi. The results strongly supported the role of alkylthio side-chains of Por-S in molecular self-organization through intermolecular S–S interactions.
In cyclic voltammetry, the onset oxidation/reduction potentials for Por-S and Por-C were respectively at 0.48/−1.26 V and 0.39/−1.22 V (Table 1). The highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) levels of Por-S and Por-C were thus estimated to be −5.10/−3.45 eV and −5.19/−3.49 eV, respectively, and their electrochemical band gaps were, respectively at 1.74 V and 1.61 V. The results are consistent with the computed HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.09/−3.04 eV and −5.08/−3.05 eV for Por-S and Por-C, respectively. The large band-gap and low-lying HOMO energy level of Por-S would be beneficial for achieving high open-circuit-voltage (VOC) in OSCs (vide infra).

The photovoltaic properties of Por-S and Por-C as donor materials were studied in BHJ OSC devices in conjunction with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. Post-deposition treatment via thermal annealing (100 °C, 5 min) and exposure to THF vapour (20 s) were implemented to optimize the morphology of the donor/PC71BM active layer to improve photovoltaic performance.10 The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The BHJ OSC devices with the thermally annealed Por-C/PC71BM active layer gave an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 2.67%. On the other hand, the thermally annealed devices with a Por-S/PC71BM active layer afforded a substantially higher PCE of 4.13%. Subsequent exposure to THF vapour for 20 s led to a higher crystallinity and better phase-separated morphology of the Por-S/PC71BM active layer (Fig. 4 and S5†). This is beneficial for charge carrier extraction and therefore contributed to a higher JSC and FF. Also the absorption of the active layers became broadened and intensity increased which also contributed to the enhanced JSC to some extent. However, the VOC dropped somewhat possibly due to the increased phase separation and undesired charge carrier recombination at the interphase. As a whole, the photovoltaic performance of the devices was enhanced profoundly.10,28 The Por-C/PC71BM devices gave an average PCE of 5.86% while Por-S/PC71BM devices provided a high average PCE of 8.04% under similar conditions. The device performances are well consistent with their charge mobilities measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6†). The Por-S/PC71BM exhibited hole and electron mobilities of 2.31 × 10−4 and 2.26 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1, respectively. In contrast, lower hole/electron mobilities of 2.44 × 10−5/1.62 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 V−1 were found for Por-C/PC71BM. The optimal devices of Por-S/PC71BM and Por-C/PC71BM all showed a wide range of photocurrent generation from 300 to 800 nm as shown in Fig. 5b, achieving an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 72.8% at 458 nm and 56.8% at 700 nm for the Por-S/PC71BM devices, and an EQE of 63.7% at 480 nm and 53.7% at 717 nm for the Por-C/PC71BM devices. It should be noted that the EQE at 620 nm is lower than 30% for the Por-S/PC71BM devices because of the absorption shortfall of the porphyrin donor between 550 and 650 nm. There is potential to further improve the device performance by using non-fullerene acceptors with complementary absorption to porphyrin donors.

Conclusions
Two new molecular porphyrin derivatives, Por-S and Por-C, of a A–π–porphyrin–π–A structure, were developed to explore their potential for OSC applications. Por-S, which carries alkylthio side-chains in its π-linkages, manifested the ability to undergo supramolecular self-assembly to preferentially form J-aggregates in its composite film with the PC71BM acceptor. In contrast, Por-C without alkylthio side-chains, showed no preferential molecular self-assembly behaviours under similar conditions. The preferential J-aggregation, driven by intermolecular S–S interactions of alkylthio side-chain substituents, had made Por-S an excellent electron donor material for OSCs. When used as a donor with the PC71BM acceptor in BHJ OSC devices, Por-S afforded excellent photovoltaic performance characteristics with a high PCE of 8.04%. This was among the best performances for a porphyrin-based donor in BHJ OSCs.
