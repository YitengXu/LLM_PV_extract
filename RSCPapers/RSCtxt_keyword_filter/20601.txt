    , Accepted 11th December 2016First published on 12th December 2016AbstractAlthough copper sulfide and/or carbon materials have been utilized in counter electrodes (CEs) due to their good catalytic activity and conductivity, the efficiency of the assembled quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is still unsatisfactory because of the relatively low photovoltage (Voc), which is commonly less than 0.7 V. In this study, graphene hydrogels (GHs) compressed onto titanium mesh served as the CE and the assembled CdSeTe QDSCs exhibited a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.85% and a Voc as high as 0.756 V, which increased by 19.0% and 14.9%, respectively, and are higher than those of the conventional CuS on FTO. By incorporating CuS nanoparticles into GH during gelation, the as-prepared GH–CuS CEs show further improved performance and the maximum PCE and Voc obtained were 10.71% and 0.786 V, respectively. The fill factor of the cells was also continuously increased. The excellent performance of the devices could be attributed to the synergistic effects of the water-rich GH (having a 3D porous structure accompanied by good conductivity) and highly catalytic CuS, reflected from the small series resistance, high catalytic activity, small electron transfer resistance, and stability, which have been confirmed by EIS, Tafel polarization, and CV curves.
Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted extensive interest because of the relatively low-cost, high efficiency, and broad potential applications.1–5 In the last five years, record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from ∼3% to ∼11.6% have been continuously reported by exploiting the abundant QD sensitizers,6–9 electrolytes,10,11 and counter electrodes (CEs).12,13 As an important component in QDSC, CE collects electrons from the external circuit and transfers them to the catalyst to complete the reduction of the oxidized polysulfide at the CE/electrolyte interface. Thus, an ideal CE should possess high electrical conductivity and good catalytic activity, which will strongly affect the bulk resistance and photovoltaic parameters, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), that determine the PCE of the cell device.
The CE is generally composed of a conductive substrate and a catalyst film. Currently, brass foil and FTO (fluorine-doped SnO2) glass are the most widely used substrates. Although the CEs based on the former have the advantages of high conductivity, they suffer from continuous corrosion by the polysulfide electrolyte, leading to the quickly decreasing efficiency.14,15 Although there are multiple CEs based on the latter, they all have relatively poor conductivity, which reduces the PCE of the QDSCs. Moreover, most of the FTO-based CEs have been prepared via repeatedly printing the pastes containing both catalyst and organic binder, resulting in a complex procedure and high transfer resistance. Semiconducting chalcogenides, such as CoS,16,17 CuxS,18–21 PbS,22,23 Bi2S3,24 and CuxSe,25 have been commonly used as catalysts. Among the reported CEs, copper sulfide-based CEs, especially grown in situ on the brass foil, generally showed excellent conductivity as well as the highest catalytic activity towards the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in the highly efficient QDSCs. However, dominantly, for the reported QDSCs assembled with various CEs, the obtained Voc was below 0.7 V and the PCE was less than 10%.
Because of the low-cost, high stability, and good conductivity, carbon materials, including nanotubes, activated carbon, porous carbon, graphite, carbon black, graphene and carbon-containing composites, have also been exploited as catalysts in CEs with reasonable PCEs.26–30 Unfortunately, QDSCs assembled with these previously reported carbon CEs exhibited lower PCE than that of the CuxS/brass based CEs.31–33 As an important member in the carbon materials family, graphene hydrogel (GH) has been fabricated via the hydrothermal reduction of a graphene oxide aqueous dispersion at about 180 °C for several hours.34 The as-prepared three-dimensional (3D) architecture GH, sometimes called the reduced graphene oxide hydrogel, consists of a well-defined and interconnected porous network, resulting in a larger surface area, more active sites, and channels with different pore sizes that do not exist in two-dimensional (2D) graphene. Importantly, the formed 3D graphene maintains the superior properties, such as good conductivity and stability, of the 2D graphene. GH also shows several other advantages. First, the large amount of water within the interconnected nanosheets make them hydrophilic and provide a room for the aqueous reactions to take place. Second, the nanometer- to micrometer-sized channels provide fast mass transport and large surface area. Third, the channel walls are easy to be anchored by the inorganic nanoparticles, such as metal sulfides, oxides, nitrides, and carbides during gelation, resulting in the well dispersion of the catalysts and more active sites, which would be helpful to improve the catalytic activity.35–37 Large number of applications of the GH in various fields, including catalysts, sensors, energy, adsorbents, biological targeting, and especially supercapacitors, have demonstrated the unique structure and property of the GH.38,39 MoS2 nanosheets have been hydrothermally grown on the 3D graphene/FTO substrates and used as CE for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) with an enhanced PCE of 7.1% due to the synergistic effects of graphene (fast electron transfer) and MoS2 (high catalytic activity).40 The application of GH as CE in the QDSCs has rarely been reported. The only reported Cu2S microspheres wrapped by graphene prepared through a solvothermal reduction, a modified method for the fabrication of GH, exhibited better catalytic activity, improved stability, and lower charge transfer resistance. The resultant CdS–CdSe QDSC assembled with the as-prepared composite CEs exhibited an optimized PCE up to 3.85% higher than that of the conventional Cu2S microsphere CEs.41 From the view point of the requirements for CE, the unique advantages of the 3D porous structure, and excellent conductivity, a water-rich GH is potentially the most effective candidate for the CEs to assemble QDSCs, especially when combining with the highly catalytic copper sulfide catalysts.
In this study, we have exploited the GH compressed onto a titanium mesh as the CEs, and the assembled CdSeTe-sensitized QDSCs exhibited a PCE of 9.85% higher than that of pure CuS on FTO, with a 19.0% increase. By combining with CuS nanoparticles during gelation, we have obtained devices with further improved efficiency and stability. Upon the optimization of the experimental conditions, high efficiency of up to 10.71% was achieved. The Voc was as high as 0.786 V and the FF for the two CEs has also been dramatically increased. The excellent performance of the devices could be attributed to the synergistic effects of the highly catalytic CuS and GH with a 3D porous structure accompanied by good conductivity (reflected from a small series resistance), high catalytic activity, small electron transfer resistance, and stability, which have been confirmed by EIS, Tafel polarization, and CV results.
Experimental section
Synthesis of pure CuS and GO aqueous solution
A total of 10 mL aqueous solution containing 1.0 mmol of CuSO4 was added to a 40 mL aqueous solution containing 4.0 mmol of sodium thiosulfate under continuous stirring. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave followed by sealing and maintaining at 180 °C for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitates were dispersed in water and sonicated for 15 min. After allowing to stand for several minutes, the supernatant dispersion was centrifuged and purified with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, for three cycles. The obtained CuS nanoparticles were dried at 60 °C in vacuum. Graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersion was synthesized according to the modified Hummers method.42 Briefly, 3.0 g of graphite was added to concentrated sulfuric acid (70 mL) under stirring at 0 °C, and then 1.5 g of sodium nitrate was added. Under vigorous agitation, 9.0 g of potassium permanganate was slowly added to the mixture and stirred for 30 min. The temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to 35 °C and the reaction mixture was heated for 2 h. Then, 150 mL of water was added and the solution was vigorously stirred at 35 °C for another 30 min. An additional 500 mL of water was added followed by the addition of 15 mL of H2O2 (30%). The quickly formed bright yellow solution was deposited for 10 h and filtered-washed with water for several times. The obtained precipitate was redispersed in 150 mL of water and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a GO aqueous dispersion.
Synthesis of GH–CuS and GH CEs
For the preparation of GH–CuS CE, a mixture of 4 mL GO and 50 mg CuS nanoparticles was sonicated for 20 min to obtain a uniform dispersion followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 12 h. The obtained GH–CuS hybrid hydrogel was compressed using a powder compressor (FW-4A) under 7 MPa pressure to fabricate the GH–CuS CE. For the preparation of GH CE, CuS nanoparticles were not added during gelation.
Synthesis of CuS/FTO CE
As a reference, CuS/FTO CE was also fabricated. Typically, a total of 150 mg of the abovementioned dried CuS nanoparticles was added to anhydrous ethanol under sonication for 10 min, and then 0.6 g terpineol and 1.3 g of 10 wt% ethyl cellulose were added followed by further sonication for 5 min to obtain a uniform mixture. Then, ethanol was removed using a rotary evaporator. The as-prepared CuS pastes were coated on the cleaned FTO glass by the screen printing method followed by thermal treatment at 450 °C for 30 min.18 The CEs fabricated by this method were referred as CuS/FTO CEs.
Preparation of the photoanode and assembly of QDSCs
A TiO2-based CdSeTe photoanode was prepared according to the method reported in our previous study4,25 and the detailed experiments can be found in the ESI.† The QDSCs were assembled by sealing the as-prepared CEs and QD-sensitized photoanodes using a 60 μm thick scotch spacer and with a droplet (10 μL) of the polysulfide electrolyte. The polysulfide electrolyte solution consisted of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in deionized water.
Characterization
The cell performances of J–V curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel, 94022A, 150 W xenon lamp) with light power calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by an NREL standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area was localized at 0.237 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and Tafel polarization were carried out using a Zennium workstation of a complete CIMPS-2 system (Zahner, Germany). For EIS, the samples were measured at 0 V bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude over the frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz under dark conditions using the sandwiched cells composed of two identical CEs placed face to face. The active area of the studied CEs was 0.64 cm2 and the distance between the two CEs was 60 μm, which was defined by a 3 M tape. The electrolyte consisted of 2.0 M Na2S and 2.0 M S aqueous solutions. CV was obtained by the same configuration as that of the EIS with electrolyte containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M S aqueous solutions. Raman spectra were obtained using an inVia reflex Raman microspectrometer equipped with a He–Ne laser (785 nm). The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed using a NOVA Nano SEM 450 system from FEI.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology of the GH and GH–CuS
Similar to the reported methods, cylindrical GHs were prepared via the hydrothermal treatment of GO aqueous dispersion at 180 °C for 12 h. GH–CuS hybrids having the shape similar to that of the pure GH were fabricated in the presence of the pre-prepared CuS nanoparticles during the hydrothermal gelation. The crystal structures of the corresponding products are shown in Fig. 1a. The diffraction peak located at 11.0° presented the typical GO diffraction of the (001) plane, consistent with that reported in a ref. 43. After the hydrothermal reduction, the peak disappeared and a new characteristic wide peak at 25.0° appeared, suggesting the recovery of the π-conjugated structure from GO and the formation of GH with a 3D network.44 Compared to the (002) peak centered at 26.2° for the well-structured graphite (PDF 75-1621), the slight shift to a smaller angle for the as-prepared GH represented the residual oxygen-containing group and the disordered stacking along the [001] direction. When the pre-prepared CuS nanoparticles were added, the formed composite was composed of reduced GO and CuS. Compared to pure CuS, no visible shift for CuS in the GH could be seen from the XRD pattern, suggesting that when CuS was incorporated into GH, no changes in the phase structure occurred and it maintained the original hexagonal phase (JCPDS no. 06-0464) with the typical peaks well-indexed, as shown in the pattern. The existence of CuS could also be confirmed by the Raman spectrum (Fig. S1 in ESI†), in which a strong and sharp peak centered at about 475 cm−1 originated from the vibration of the S–S bond, consistent with the XRD and reported results.45 The D peak at ∼1355 cm−1 and G peak at ∼1590 cm−1 could be observed from both the GO source and GH–CuS composite. However, the intensity ratio of D to G (ID/IG) for the hybrid increased from 0.96 to 1.36, indicating the successful formation of graphene.46 From the FESEM images, as shown in Fig. 1b and c, it could be seen that the CuS nanoparticles have the rectangle-like shape with a uniform width of ∼59.0 nm, and the 3D porous GH has an apparent interconnected network composed of randomly assembled graphene sheets with the same morphology as that reported in previous studies.34,40,41 The morphologies of CuS and GH were maintained after the formation of the GH–CuS hybrid hydrogels (Fig. 1d), in which CuS particles were anchored onto the surface of the graphene sheets. Moreover, it was observed that some CuS particles were covered or wrapped by the graphene sheets, suggesting that graphene sheets could serve as a support for the CuS particles to attach well. The growth process could be reasonably expected. When added to a GO aqueous dispersion and upon ultrasonication, CuS particles could be homogeneously adsorbed on the surface of GO sheets due to the large amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups. Moreover, the homogeneous mixture could hold for a long period (Fig. S2†), whereas the pure CuS particles were easy to aggregate. After the hydrothermal reduction, the graphene sheets randomly assembled into a network with channels, resulting in the CuS particles wrapped into the walls.

Photovoltaic performance of the various CEs
The obtained GH and GH–CuS were cylindrical in shape and compressible (Fig. S2†). They were compressed with a pressure of 7 MPa onto titanium (Ti) mesh (80 mesh) to fabricate the GH and GH–CuS based CEs. For comparison, CuS/FTO (paste containing pure CuS nanoparticles was printed on FTO) CEs were also prepared. The assembled CdSeTe QDSCs with the three types of CEs exhibited different performances, with J–V curves shown in Fig. 2a and extracted parameters presented in Table 1. The reference CuS/FTO CE showed a PCE of 8.28%. Instead, when GH CEs were used, the PCE increased to a maximum of 9.85%, with an increase by 19.0%. The improved efficiency was mainly contributed by the increased Voc, from 0.658 to 0.756 V (a 14.9% increase), and the FF from 60.52 to 63.91% (a 5.6% increase). When the CuS nanoparticles were incorporated into GH with the resultant GH–CuS as CEs, the PCEs of the assembled cells exhibited the highest maximum of 10.71% and an average of 10.10% with 4.0%, 3.3%, and 8.7% growth in Voc, FF, and PCE, respectively. When comparing with the performance for CuS/FTO, we found that GH–CuS-based QDSCs showed significantly increased Voc, FF, and PCE by 19%, 9%, and 29%, respectively. For the two CE structures of GH–CuS and CuS/FTO, the conductive substrate was composed of Ti mesh and semiconductor FTO, respectively, and the catalyst was composed of GH–CuS composite and pure CuS, respectively. The conductivity of Ti is clearly better than that of the semiconductor FTO film. The role of GH and the working process have been discussed hereinafter. Note that the high Voc (up to 0.786 V) is consistent with that reported in a previous study, in which graphene organogels served as CE for an I2/I− based DSC.47 However, the dramatic difference of about 0.1 V in the Voc reported in this study could possibly be attributed to the down shift of the redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in the promoted high photovoltage.48 EIS measurements were carried out to investigate the mechanism of different CEs, curves shown in Fig. 2b and parameters in Table 1 (equivalent circuit for fitting EIS is shown in Fig. S3†). It could be seen that GH and GH–CuS CEs exhibited the smaller values of 2.83 and 2.29 Ω in series resistance (Rs), suggesting the better conductivity of the Ti mesh than that of the FTO. When comparing the value of Rct1 with that of CuS/FTO, demonstrating the charge transfer resistance between the substrate and catalyst, we found that the contact between the CE film and substrate for GH CE was similar, whereas GH–CuS CE greatly decreased to about only one half. On comparing the values of Rct2 with those of CuS/FTO, representing the charge transfer resistance between the catalyst and electrolyte, GH and GH–CuS showed higher catalytic activity than that of pure CuS at about 41.6% and 13.0%, respectively, even higher than that of the brass-substrated CuS.18 When comparing GH and GH–CuS, we could also find that all the parameters in EIS for GH–CuS were apparently smaller than those for the GH, suggesting that the most potential candidate for CE was GH–CuS. The current density in the order of GH–CuS > GH > CuS/FTO was observed from the CV curves (Fig. 2c) and further illustrated the superior catalytic activity of the GH and GH–CuS CEs, especially for the latter. Evaluating the stability is an important factor for the potential application of CEs in QDSCs. However, the conservation stability of the devices using the conditions reported in a previous study18 has not been carried out due to the leakage of the electrolyte and the unsolved sealing technique. But the electrochemical stabilities of the three types of CEs could be investigated by observing the continuous CV (50 cycles with curves shown in Fig. S4† and extracted current density dependent on the cycle number in Fig. 2d). Fig. S4† showed that there were nearly no significant or slight changes in the curve shape after 50 cycles for the GH–CuS and GH, but the plot for CuS/FTO did not overlap well under the continuous cycles. The current density (Fig. 2d) for GH–CuS was maintained at ∼90% after 50 cycles and for GH at ∼75%. However, unfortunately, the curve shape for CuS/FTO obviously changed at the fifth cycle with the current density decreasing to ∼48%, indicating the poorest stability. It is well known that the FF value is largely affected by the electrode resistance and charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. According to the EIS and CV measurements, the increased FF based on the GH/CuS CE could be attributed to the good conductivity of GH, superior catalytic activity of CuS, and the tight contact between Ti mesh and GH/CuS.

Working process of various CEs
From the results, we can conclude that when GH was compressed onto Ti mesh as a CE, it shows better catalytic activity, smaller charge transfer resistances, and higher stability as compared to those of the conventional CuS/FTO. In this case, the working process for CE is similar to that for CuS/FTO, as shown in Scheme 1, which describes the electron transfer with two or three steps in various types of CEs. The substrate of Ti first collects the external electrons (step ①), and then transfers them to the catalyst of GH (step ②), where the reduction of electrolyte takes place. The improved cell performance of the GH on Ti mesh is expected to be strongly contributed by the high conductivity and good catalytic activity of the GH due to the porous structure with a large surface area. The tight contact between Ti mesh and GH simultaneously plays an important role in the improved performance. When CuS nanoparticles were incorporated into GH, the PCE and stability were further improved. In this case, the external electrons collected by Ti mesh (step ①) are transferred to GH (step ②), and then to the catalyst of CuS (step ③), where the reduction of electrolyte occurs. Herein, the GH serves as a porter of electrons and shuttles them across the 3D network to CuS, which acts as a catalyst like that reported in the studies on the graphene–sulfide composites.49–51 On the other hand, the hydrophilic channels that exist in the porous GH tightly hold the CuS nanoparticles, offering convenience for the charge and electrolyte transport. Thus, the excellent cell performance, including high PCE and improved stability of GH–CuS CEs, are the synergistic effects of GH with good conductivity as well as a 3D porous network structure and the outstanding catalytic activity of the CuS nanoparticles.

Influence of the conditions on the performance of GH–CuS CE
The highest PCE of 10.71% for the champion cell and the average value of 10.10% that happened on the GH–CuS on Ti mesh as CEs were received under the optimized experimental conditions, including the amount of the incorporated CuS nanoparticles, hydrothermal reaction time, and compression force. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves for the QDSCs assembled with GH–CuS CEs incorporated with different amounts of CuS (the parameters are presented in Table 2). Although there were not tremendous changes in each parameter, the continuously small increase till 50 mg and decrease after that could be clearly seen, especially from the normalized parameters, as shown in Fig. 3b. When the amount of CuS was increased from 30 to 50 mg, all the parameters increased to achieve the highest values, resulting in the remarkable increase of 10.09% by ∼9.3% in the PCE. On further increasing the amount of CuS, we could find that the parameters and PCE continuously decreased. EIS (Fig. 4a with values shown in Table 2) and Tafel polarization (Fig. 4b) were carried out to investigate the mechanism. The similar change tendency of exchange current density and the reversed change tendency of Rs, Rct1, and Rct2 are consistent with those of PCE, indicating that an amount of 50 mg is optimum. It is easy to understand that the amount of CuS affects the performance of QDSCs when it serves as a catalyst. Moreover, when the catalyst was deficient, reduction of the electrolyte could not be efficiently catalyzed, whereas excess of catalysts would hardly or even negatively contribute to the catalytic activity and performance of the CEs.

 Fig. 4  EIS and Tafel polarization curves for the symmetric cells of GH–CuS prepared with different amounts of CuS. 
The level of reduction for the GH associated with the conductivity was generally affected by the reaction time during the formation of GH.34 Thus, the reaction was carried out for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h. The Raman spectra and digital images obtained from the corresponding GH–CuS are shown in Fig. 5a and S5,† respectively. The size of the gel decreased within the initial 6 h and maintained nearly constant afterwards. The intensity ratio of the ID/IG in the Raman spectra increased from 1.01 to 1.36 as the time increased from 3 to 12 h, indicating the continuously increasing reduction level of GO.52 Simultaneously, the photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 5b and Table S1,† continuously increased to 0.753 V for Voc, 20.41 mA cm−2 for Jsc, and 65.08% for FF at 12 h. The resultant PCE was greatly increased to 9.99%, 11% higher than that at 3 h. In the EIS results (Fig. 5c and Table S1†), the three parameters of Rs, Rct1, and Rct2 continuously decreased as the reaction time increased. It is very clear that the improved photovoltaic performance due to the long reaction time are strongly contributed by the enhanced electrical conductivity of GH and the decreased charge transfer resistances between the interfaces of substrate, catalyst, and electrolyte. When the reaction time was extended from 3 to 12 h, the Rct2 value dropped to only 42% (from 1.45 to 0.61 Ω), indicating the dramatically improved catalytic activity. The increased electrocatalytic activity along with the increased reaction time could also be confirmed from the Tafel and CV results, as shown in Fig. 5d and e, as well as from the enhanced peak intensity for CuS in the Raman spectra.

Similar to the previous reports, the formed GH–CuS hybrid hydrogels were also compressible and could be transferred to Ti mesh to serve as CE. However, the pressure will affect the thickness and performance of the CE. As shown in Fig. S6,† when the pressure was 5 MPa, the obtained thickness of the catalyst was ∼426 μm. On increasing the pressure to 7 and 11 MPa, the thickness decreased to 385 and 327.5 μm, respectively. Apparently, the relationship of pressure and thickness is linear, as shown in the inset of Fig. S6b,† indicating the elasticity of the GH–CuS. The optimum pressure is 7 MPa, under which the highest PCE of 10.03% was obtained with the highest parameters of Voc, Jsc, and FF, as demonstrated in Fig. S7 and Table S2.† When much lower and higher pressures were imposed, the PCEs dramatically decreased to below 96% (corresponding to 9.57% and 9.76% vs. 10.03%). Comparing the parameters from the EIS (Table S2†) results, we can see that for the case of 7 MPa, the CE has the smallest Rs, Rct1, and Rct2, indicating the best conductivity, the best contact between the catalyst and Ti substrate, and the best catalytic activity. This could be explained by the fact that when the pressure was smaller, the contact between the catalyst and substrate was poorer, whereas when the pressure was excessively high, the channels of the porous GH–CuS dramatically shrank, weakening the mass transport of the electrolyte to the reaction cites.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a hydrothermally reduced GH has been successfully extended for the utilization of CE for QDSCs, with the obtained high efficiency of maximum 9.85%. The performance of GH as CE was better than that of the conventional FTO-based CuS. When the CuS nanoparticles were incorporated during gelation, the performance of the assembled QDSCs could further be improved to the highest efficiency of 10.71%. This was strongly attributed to all the increased photovoltaic parameters, especially Voc. Moreover, the stability has also been improved. The excellent performance with high conversion efficiency and satisfactory stability was due to the synergistic effect of GH (having good conductivity accompanied by a 3D porous network structure) and the outstanding catalytic activity of the CuS nanoparticles. This study has demonstrated that graphene hydrogels and the hybrids containing highly catalytic sulfide could be potential for the utilization of CE in the QDSCs and other photovoltaic devices.
