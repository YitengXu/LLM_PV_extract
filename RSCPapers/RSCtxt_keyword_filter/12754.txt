    , Accepted 24th August 2019First published on 26th August 2019AbstractElectron selective layers are important to the efficiency, stability and hysteresis of perovskite solar cells. Photo-annealing is a low-cost, roll-to-roll-compatible process that can be applied to the post-treatment fabrication of sol–gel based metal oxide layers. Here, we fabricate an amorphous titanium oxide electron selective layer at a low temperature in a dry atmosphere using a UV light annealing system and compare it with a thermal annealing process. Active oxygen species are created by using UV light to promote hydrolysis and condense the TiO2 precursor, which removes organic ligands effectively. The photo-annealed TiO2-based perovskite solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 19.37% without hysteresis.
Introduction
Metal oxide thin films have attracted attention as charge extraction and transport layers. Wide-bandgap semiconducting metal oxides, including TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2, which have transparency and low work-functions, have been specifically investigated as electron selective layers (ESL) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1–3 Numerous fabrication techniques have therefore been developed for metal oxide thin films compatible with PSCs.4 Among them, amorphous metal oxide thin films processed at low temperatures have emerged as candidates for optoelectronic materials, not only for PSCs but also for transistors, because of their low-cost plastic substrate, optical transparency, high carrier mobility, and uniformity.5,6
Atomic layer deposition has been widely used to prepare amorphous metal oxide layers at low temperature and create highly efficient PSCs.7,8 However, the vacuum processes cannot avoid the high cost issue. So, the best alternative, and the best process is the sol–gel based solution process. Solution-based coating processes are guaranteed to meet industrial requirements such as low-cost and large-area production. However, most solution-based metal oxide thin film processes involve further temperature annealing not only to pyrolyze the remaining organic and inorganic components but also in the densification of sol–gel precursors.9–11
Photo-annealing processes have been used to fabricate sol–gel-based thin metal oxide films at low temperature.11–13 Various photo sources were used to anneal Si-based dielectrics (by vacuum-assisted UV annealing14), III–V semiconductors (by UV chemical vapor deposition15), and metal oxides (by deep UV annealing, 172 nm UV16). In recent years, photo-annealing technology has allowed for low temperature metal oxide ESL for PSCs. Huang et al. reported a 9.95% PSC using room-temperature photo-annealing.17 Ko et al. reported a 19.57% PSC by photo-annealing at low-temperatures (50 °C).18 These studies have shown that photo-annealed ESL have sufficient potential to replace conventional heat treatment. Although these studies have produced high quality TiO2 ESL at low temperatures, for those methods, pre-synthesized crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles, which are obtained through a high temperature process, are needed.
Studies have been conducted by Zhang et al.19,20 on forming metal oxide ESL by directly exposing the metal alkoxide or metal halide precursors to UV light. Zhang et al.19,20 used a special photo-annealing system with a relatively high power density (500 mW cm−2) to function as an in situ heating system because UV light annealing for sol–gel films can be more effective under vacuum conditions, resulting in a hotter and more humid atmosphere. This effort was successful for fabricating TiO2 and SnO2 with crystallinity at a low temperature (∼70 °C), a PSC of 17.03%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.21%. Recently, Zhang et al.21 attempted to make a photo annealed TiO2 ESL using the titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4) precursor under a high-power UV system without additional thermal energy, but it exhibited a PCE of only 11.58%.
We demonstrated a new strategy for forming high-performance and reliable amorphous TiO2 ESL using the low power (30 mW cm−2) UV photo-annealing system. To fabricate a conformal photo-annealed TiO2 (refer to P-TiO2), we conducted experiments using modified metal alkoxide precursors, annealing systems with two different UV wavelengths (184.9 nm and 253.7 nm), and a lower-moisture atmosphere (less than 5% relative humidity at 20 °C). There are several reasons for these experimental conditions. Rapid and even hydrolysis reactions can result in gel-collapse and an irregular Ti–O–Ti matrix, resulting in porous films.22 Therefore, we controlled the hydrolysis reaction by performing experiments under dry conditions (minimizing the effect of H2O) and using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Ti(acac)2OiPr2), referred to as TDIP. The hydrolysis reactions of alkoxy groups are irreversible23 and rapid. Once the hydrolysis reaction begins, hydrolyzed alkoxide can form a three-dimensional stable matrix, whereas the bis-acetylacetonate forms a one-dimensional matrix.24 To make pure metal oxide films, we ensured that all chelating ligands were fully removed. Then, the selected UV sources produce active oxygen species, which can promote the removal of organic ligands and the hydrolysis-condensation reaction. The hydrolyzed alkoxide films are known to effectively absorb UV light to break organic ligands within the precursor.23
Using this system, we fabricated P-TiO2 that has a conformal morphology and suitable optoelectrical properties for the extraction of electrons from a perovskite layer. We also found the photo-annealing system to be effective for minimizing surface Ti3+ defects on TiO2. Moreover, unlike high temperature annealed TiO2 (refer to T-TiO2), the P-TiO2-based PSC showed a comparable PCE. Additionally, the optimized P-TiO2-based PSC obtained a PCE over 19% without hysteresis and we succeeded in fabricating a flexible device that obtained a PCE of more than 16% with excellent mechanical durability.
Experimental
Materials
All solvents were unaltered and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents and materials were stored in an inert gas glovebox. For the precursor solution of the TiO2 thin film, 0.15 M of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TDIP, 75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in 1-butanol. The TiO2 precursor solution was refrigerated. For the perovskite layer, formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were purchased from GreatCell Solar, and lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. For the 2-step perovskite precursor solution, a solution of 1.3 M PbI2 containing 2.5 mol% PbBr2 in DMF:DMSO (8:2 volume ratio) was first prepared at 80 °C. Then, FAI:MABr:MACl = 60:6:6 mg in 1 mL 2-propanol solution was prepared at room temperature. For the hole transport layer, 70 mM spiro-MeOTAD (Luminescence Technology Corp.) in chlorobenzene was doped with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Sigma-Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Greatcell Solar), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of additives for spiro-MeOTAD was 0.53:0.03:3.26 for Li-TFSI:FK209:tBP, respectively.
Preparing the TiO2 electron selective layer
The preparation and annealing of TiO2 were performed in an argon-filled glovebox and dry room (relative humidity below 5%, 20 °C). For the TiO2 ESL, TDIP was diluted in 1-butanol solvent. The diluted precursor was stirred for one hour and stored in a refrigerator. First, the precursor solution was spin-coated on the cleaned transparent conductive layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s. After spinning, the samples were dried at 110 °C for 5 min. For the thermal annealing, soft-baked samples were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. For photo annealing, dried samples were placed under a UV light (power density: 0.03 W cm−2) for 2 h. We prepared the TDIP precursor solution weekly to prevent aging of the precursor.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The FTO-coated glass substrates (Pilkington TEC15) were cleaned for 15 min with acetone, ethanol, and DI water in an ultrasonic bath. The 0.15 M TDIP precursor was spin-coated on the FTO-coated glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 20 s, then baked at 110 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, TDIP coated samples were moved to a furnace or UV light illumination system for thermal- and photo annealing. For the optimized device, the resulting glass/FTO/photo-annealed TiO2 was immersed in a 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 15 min, rinsed with DI water, and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was coated on the prepared TiO2 following a 2-step method. The PbI2 and PbBr2 precursors were coated at 2500 rpm for 25 s. After spin coating, the prepared FAI:MABr:MACl in 2-propanol solution was immediately dropped on the PbI2 and PbBr2 films without heat treatment. After holding FAI:MABr:MACl in 2-propanol solution for 5 s, it was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the hole transport layer was formed via spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s using a prepared Spiro-MeOTAD solution. The Au electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation. All fabrication processes were performed in the dry room (temperature: ∼25 °C and relative humidity: 10–20%).
Characterization
Photovoltaic properties were measured with a solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar 3A Class AAA, 64023A) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS), which was calibrated using a standard Si photovoltaic cell (Rc-1000-TC-KG5-N, VLSI Standards) and a potentiostat (CHI 600D, CH Instruments). Steady-state photoluminescence was observed using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, HAMAMATSU) with a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, HAMAMATSU) for photoexcitation. The crystalline structure was determined with an X-ray diffractometer (New D8 Advanced, Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X-ray photoemission spectra, Sigma Probe, ThermoVG) was used to determine the chemical states of Ti, O, and C on the surface of the substrates. Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific) in the 600–4000 cm−1 range with a Ge window. The surface morphology and cross-sectional structure were examined via FESEM (JSM-7600F, JEOL). The samples for TEM were prepared using a focused ion beam (JIB-4601F, JEOL), the TEM (JEM ARM 200F, JEOL) measurements were taken, and TEM/EDX (JEM ARM 200F, JEOL) mapping was then conducted. EDX mapping was performed for an area of approximately 0.4 μm2. Valence band maxima of the layers were determined using UPS (SIGMA PROBE, VG) with a He discharge lamp. Ultraviolet UPS analysis was performed by using a He I source (21.22 eV), therefore the work function information for each film was obtained by subtracting the secondary electron cutoff energies from 21.22 eV. From the work function (Fermi level) information, the valence band maximum (VBM) for each film was obtained by subtracting binding energies. Raman spectroscopy data were obtained from LabRAM HV Evolution of HORIBA. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted using a Park Systems NX-10 instrument. QE was measured using a specially designed IPCE system (PV measurement, Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) was used as a light source for generating monochromatic beams. The EQE data were collected in the DC mode without bias light. The photocatalytic activity was measured with a potentiostat (Biologics, SP-200) and a solar simulator (ORIEL, LCS-100), which was calibrated using a silicon reference cell (Newport, 91150 V), in a three-electrode system with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 M NaCl, E° = 209 mV), TiO2 films as the working electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The photocurrent-potential measurement was conducted with a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 from −0.5 V to 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode in the electrolyte of 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH ∼ 7.0). The potential was fitted by the equation, V vs. RHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.209 V.
Results and discussion
The schematic in Fig. 1(a) shows the conventional thermal annealing and photo-annealing step for fabricating TiO2 thin ESL. The titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TDIP, (CH3)2(CHO)2Ti(C5H7O2)2) precursor in 1-butanol was used to fabricate the TiO2 film. TDIP has two isopropoxides (iPr) and two acetylacetonates (acac) bonded to Ti4+, as shown in Fig. 1(a), and is used in general TiO2 synthesis. Typically, metal alkoxide precursors are hydrolyzed (M-OR + H2O → M-OH + ROH) and condensed (M-OH + M-OR → M–O–M + R-OH or M-OH + M-OH → M–O–M + H2O) to form a metal oxide network25 after spin-coating. Most solvents and alcohol can be removed by the soft-baking process. After spin-coating and soft baking (referred to as ‘as-prepared’), the sol–gel based metal oxide film normally has an amorphous phase (see the XRD data for the as-prepared sample in ESI Fig. S1†). Next, in the conventional process, metal alkoxide precursors are completely hydrolyzed and condensed with further high-temperature treatment and physisorbed water molecules and by-product organic compounds, in this case (CH3)2CHOH and C5H8O2, are removed by thermal energy. In the photo-annealing process, on the other hand, UV light with wavelengths of 184.9 and 253.7 nm performs various functions instead of providing thermal energy, as described below.26–28 184.9 nm UV light dissociates an oxygen molecule into two oxygen atoms (2O 3P), and then ozone (O3) is formed by reaction of an oxygen atom (O 3P) and another O2 molecule. Excited singlet oxygen atoms (O 1D) and molecule (1O2) are generated by the decomposition of O3 under 253.7 nm of UV light. Another active oxygen species, OH*, comes from the reaction with decomposed O3 and hydrogen atoms. These generated active oxygens promote hydrolysis reactions and condensation of TDIP. OH* in particular radically accelerates the hydrolysis reaction and excited oxygen (O 1D and 1O2) functions as an excellent oxidizing agent for the by-product organic compound. The temperature under UV light gradually increased from 23 °C to 34 °C over 30 min, and stayed constant at ∼34 °C for 2 h. Therefore, the additional thermal treatment was excluded from the photo-annealing system.

TDIP precursor coating was repeated 20 times for FTIR analysis and FESEM images. Scale bar = 200 nm. 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis supports the photo-annealing effect by using active oxygen species. To ensure the clarity of our data, we prepared a thick film by repeating the TDIP coating and post-treatment 20 times on the Si substrate for FT-IR (Fig. 1c). As depicted in Fig. 1b, FT-IR analysis indicates that the as-prepared TDIP film had many stretching vibrations, indicating CO (1570 and 1526 cm−1), C–H (1422, 1351 and 1283 cm−1), and C–O (1025 cm−1).29–31 Those vibration peaks correspond to hydrolyzed acetylacetonate-modified titanium isopropoxide,32 indicating that the one-dimensional matrix formed by bis-acetylacetonate remains. Also, it indicates that the spin-coating and soft baking processes were not sufficient for forming well-condensed M–O–M amorphous films under dry conditions. After thermal- and photo-annealing treatment, however, carbon-related peaks had disappeared. One difference between the two methods is the broader stretching, from 2800 to 3600 cm−1, as shown in the ESI Fig. S2† and Fig. 1b. This corresponds to the –OH radical on the metal oxide thin film,33 which is found after hydrophilic surface treatment using UV light. FT-IR data indicate that photo annealing may be an alternative to thermal annealing for removing organic ligands and for surface modification. This is a favorable condition for coating a perovskite precursor solution such as DMF and DMSO. The –OH radical on the surface of TiO2 increases the wettability of the polar solvent, resulting in the enhanced coverage of perovskite films and adhesion of the interfacial contact for TiO2/perovskite.
The morphology and densification rate of films were identified with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using the same samples as with FT-IR analysis. Oddly, the FESEM images of P-TiO2 films, Fig. 1c, showed not only conformal surfaces but also a densification of the film compared to T-TiO2. The difference in densification may be due to the porosity created in T-TiO2 during crystallization. The porous structure of T-TiO2 can be clearly observed in the following HR-TEM image.
HRTEM was conducted to evaluate the crystallinity and morphology of P- and T-TIO2 thin films for perovskite devices. Fig. 2a and b show the cross sectional TEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of P-TiO2 and T-TiO2, respectively. In Fig. 2a and b, both TiO2 thin films were clearly formed, 20–80 nm thick, along the FTO surface. However, the TiO2 at the apex of the FTO substrate was not uniform. In Fig. 2b, the peak area of the FTO (the orange points) indicates the uncovered surface of the FTO. Even though the photo-annealing process revealed a high densification rate in Fig. 1c, P-TiO2 was fully covered on the FTO surface. Furthermore, the cross-sectional TEM image of P-TiO2 shows a typical amorphous phase, and T-TiO2 appears as a thin film consisting of crystalline nanoparticles.

(c) Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, (d) Raman spectroscopy, and (e) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of P- and T-TiO2. 
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Raman spectroscopy were therefore conducted to confirm the crystalline condition of P-TiO2 and T-TiO2 as depicted in Fig. 2c and d. In the case of P-TiO2, neither the diffraction pattern nor the Raman scattering was shown in the analysis, indicating an amorphous phase as predicted by the TEM image. T-TiO2 exhibited a typical anatase phase.34,35 The pinhole of T-TiO2 can be described by the thin film growth mechanism on the rough surface. In the heterogenous nucleation process on the rough surface, the energy barrier of ΔGnucleation at the concave is lower than the convex of the substrate.36,37 Thus, the nucleation of anatase TiO2 can be started from the convex site of an FTO substrate and atoms migrate to a stable site (nucleation site in the convex) by following their lattice for crystallization. Meanwhile, photo-annealing systems cannot provide sufficient energy for nucleation by crystallization and for atom migration. P-TiO2 therefore forms a dense and conformal film, even on the convex area of the substrate.
We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to identify the surface states of both TiO2. XPS peak fitting was conducted on Ti 2p3/2, which has a binding energy of 459.2 eV. After fitting, the binding energy difference of the Ti 2P3/2 and O 1s was 71.46 eV, corresponding to anatase TiO2.38 Furthermore, the surface peaks were deconvoluted by symmetric line-shapes comprised of 30% Gaussian and 70% Lorentzian functions. XPS peaks for Ti 2p and O 1s are displayed in Fig. 2e and C 1s is depicted in ESI Fig. S3.† We also observed a difference in the O 1s state on P-TiO2 compared to T-TiO2. One peak of O 1s in P-TiO2 was different at 532.93 eV. It was 2.27 eV higher than the peak of lattice O 1s, possibly due to oxygen-containing hydrocarbon contamination39,40 or surface adsorbed hydroxyls and water.41 We even observed some peaks for C 1s, which can be explained as carbon contamination;39,42 however, those peaks were also observed in T-TiO2. It is also evident that P-TiO2 has a higher O/Ti atomic concentration ratio due to surface hydroxyl species compared to T-TiO2 as shown in ESI Table S1.† Therefore the 532.93 eV of binding energy can be explained by surface adsorbed hydroxyls and water, corresponding to higher –OH stretching of FT-IR spectroscopy in P-TiO2. In previous studies, the binding energy assigned to hydroxyls and water was observed to be 1.1 eV–3.5 eV higher than the O 1s lattice energy on the surface of anatase and rutile TiO2.43
We performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy to explore the electronic structure of P-TiO2. The UPS spectra of P-TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3a. The work function (WF) is derived by subtracting the cut-off energy (21.22 eV of He I). The VBM was determined by fitting an extrapolation of the leading edge after shifting the Fermi level to O eV. The optical bandgap of TiO2 was calculated by the Tauc plot as seen in Fig. 3b. The energy band diagrams of P-TiO2 from the measured data are displayed in Fig. 3c. The CBM, VBM, WF, and optical bandgap are −3.98, −7.50, −4.18, and 3.52 eV, respectively. The photo-annealing process results in a broader energy band that is beneficial for electron extraction and hole-blocking properties in the PSCS. The energy diagram of P-TiO2 has CBM and WF values similar to the energy configuration reported for anatase TiO2 produced by thermal annealing.44,45

We fabricated PSCs using P- and T-TiO2 to ensure the ESL characterization. For comparison, we used a cation and halide (FA/MA and I/Br) perovskite layer mixed using a 2-step method. The cross-sectional SEM image of fabricated PSCs is shown in ESI Fig. S4.†Fig. 4a and b exhibit the best J–V curve and statistical PCE data according to the voltage scan direction for 20 PSCs based on P- and T-TiO2. Specific performance parameters for the 20 devices are listed in ESI Tables S2 and S3.† The highest PCEs were 18.48% and 18.93%, and the average PCEs were 17.77% and 18.09% for T-TiO2 and P-TiO2, respectively. The efficiency and hysteresis of the PSCs fabricated on different TiO2 show similar values. We also compared photoluminescence values to ensure the charge extraction properties of T- and P-TiO2. Fig. 4c and d show steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay of glass/perovskite, glass/T-TiO2/perovskite, and glass/P-TiO2/perovskite samples. The relative intensities of SSPL of T- and P-TiO2 are 31%, and 27%, respectively, compared to glass/perovskite samples. The TRPL analysis indicates a similar trend. Additionally, the TRPL in Fig. 3d with the bi-exponential fitting data of both TiO2 ESL shows a similar decay time. (The detailed fitting data are summarized in ESI Table S4†). The fast component in TRPL, attributable to the charge extraction from the perovskite to the TiO2 layer, was 8.79 ns (53.70%) and 9.50 ns (45.49%) for P- and T-TiO2, respectively. Furthermore, the average lifetimes (τave) were 656.48 ns for P-TiO2 and 767.67 ns for T-TiO2.

(c) Steady-state and (d) time resolved photoluminescence for glass/perovskite, glass/T-TiO2/perovskite, and glass/P-TiO2/perovskite. The boxes show the standard deviations (n = 20); the whiskers represent the 10/90 percentile; the small squares denote the mean, the diagonal crosses denote the 99% and 1% values, and the horizontal bar denotes the highest and lowest values. 
We also performed device stability tests under 1 sun illumination and dry air conditions with 10–20% of relative humidity. To evaluate stability, we displayed average photovoltaic values of reverse and forward scan of the J–V curve using 4 devices in ESI Fig. S5.† As shown in ESI Fig. S5a,† the PCE of T-TiO2 based PSCs dropped to 44 % of their initial values after 60min, while P-TiO2 based PSCs dropped to 70 % of their initial PCE after 60minutes. Under light soaking conditions with UV light, excess holes induced by the photocatalytic reaction of TiO2 can interact with halide ions in the perovskite layer, resulting in the degradation of PSCs.46,47 So, we compared the photocatalytic activity of both TiO2 as seen in ESI Fig. S6.† In the case of TiO2, the current density versus potential curve changed to a convex curve with a higher applied potential under chopped light illumination, indicating photocatalysis reaction, while P-TiO2 does not react with potential and light illumination conditions. Generally amorphous TiO2 has lower or negligible photocatalytic activity when compared to crystalline TiO2.48–50 These low photocatalytic properties may have resulted in the relative higher stability of PSCs. A recent report by Guo et al. indicates that the lower photocatalytic activity of the SiOx coated TiO2 film shows a higher stability of PCE, and stable Voc value compared to the TiO2 film, which has higher photocatalytic activity.51 This degradation trend of PSCs was corresponding to our results in ESI Fig. S5b and c.† Comparing these results of both TiO2 demonstrates that the photo-annealing system can be used to create alternative ESL for highly efficient PSCs.

Fig. 5 shows the performance of the optimized P-TiO2 based PSC. To enhance the PCE and reduce hysteresis, we performed additional interface treatment using low-temperature TiCl4.52 As shown in Fig. 5a, the optimized PSC obtained a PCE of 19.37%, Jsc of 22.37 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.11 V, and FF of 0.78 at the reverse voltage scan, and a PCE of 19.13%, Jsc of 22.30 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.10 V, and FF of 0.78 at the forward voltage scan with an active area of 0.14 cm2. Optimized P-TiO2-based PSCs barely showed the hysteresis phenomenon; the average value of reverse PCE/forward PCE reached 0.98 for 20 devices. All PCE and other photovoltaic performance parameters of these devices can be seen in ESI Fig. S7 and ESI Table S5.† We also investigated the steady-state current density at the 0.92 voltage point shown in Fig. 5b. The current density reached ∼99% of the stabilized current density of 20.44 mA cm−2 immediately, and maintained their values for 300 s. The hysteresis-free J–V curve and fast saturation of current density implied low density of trap sites with interface of P-TiO2 and the perovskite layer.53 The external quantum efficiency measured by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is presented in Fig. 5c. The integrated photocurrent from the EQE is 21.87 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the Jsc of the PCE shown in Fig. 5a.
 Fig. 5  (a) The J–V characteristics, (b) the steady-state photocurrent density, and (c) external quantum efficiency and integrated current density of optimized P-TiO2 based PSC. The solid purple line indicates a reverse scan and the purple dots indicate a forward scan. The steady-state photocurrent density was conducted at the same 0.92 V as the cross marked point in the J–V curve. (d) Cross-sectional SEM image, (e) J–V curve and (f) bending test of the P-TiO2 based flexible PSC. Bending radius is 4 mm. Inset image in (d) is a real image of the flexible PSC. Scale bar = 500 nm. 
All steps to fabricate a flexible device on the PEN/ITO substrate for the P-TiO2 based PSC were operated at 150 °C. Fig. 5d shows a cross sectional SEM image, obtaining thin (∼15 nm) P-TiO2 on ITO, ∼500 nm perovskite, ∼70 nm Spiro-MeOTAD, and ∼50 nm Au electrode. The photograph of the flexible PSC is shown in the inset of Fig. 5d. The performance of the flexible P-TiO2 based PSC exhibited a PCE of 16.20%, Jsc of 20.36 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.09 V, and FF of 0.73 as seen in Fig. 5e. The bending test was performed with a bending radius of 4 mm. Fig. 5f depicts the bending durability of normalized PCE, which decreased slightly to 96% and 93% of the initial PCE after 2000 and 4000 bending cycles, respectively. After 5000 cycles the bending durability decreases to less than 90% of the initial PCE.
Conclusions
This research proposes high quality TiO2 thin films created with the photo-annealing system. We suggest that minimizing other factors that can affect the annealing process, such as H2O, additional heating, or selection of a suitable precursor, is a promising strategy for making a TiO2 thin layer for ESL in PSCs. After photo annealing, TiO2 shows a uniform coated amorphous phase. Furthermore, the electronic energy configuration of P-TiO2 possesses a deep VBM for hole blocking and appropriate CBM for electron extraction. PSCs fabricated on P-TiO2 had a similar performance to T-TiO2-based PSCs. Moreover, the optimized PSC shows high PCE values of 19.37% and 16.20% for devices fabricated on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. This demonstrates that photo-annealing methods can be applied to the fabrication of metal oxide thin films at room temperature. Our work establishes the potential of photo-annealed metal oxides without further treatment as ESL in PSCs and may be applied to roll-to-roll processes for large area ESL in the commercial market.
