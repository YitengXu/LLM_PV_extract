    , Accepted 24th February 2014First published on 26th February 2014AbstractA panchromatic dye was synthesized with an isoindigo core as a linker to bridge with a bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)phenylamine donor and a cyanoacetic acid acceptor for dye-sensitized solar cells, showing a broad spectral response and a high conversion efficiency of 7.55% under AM 1.5 conditions.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been receiving increasing attention as potential next-generation renewable sources due to their low production cost and relatively high conversion efficiencies.1 Low band-gap sensitizers are recognized to be a promising strategy for development of high-performance DSCs due to their wide-band spectral response.2 In this respect, organic dyes are expected to be ideal alternatives due to their easy tuning of the band gaps and high light-harvesting ability as compared to traditional ruthenium complexes.3 Most of the organic dyes employ electron donor–π linker–electron acceptor (D–π–A) configurations, where different linkers were used to bridge a donor triarylamine and an acceptor cyanoacrylic acid unit.3 The π-conjugated linker is of paramount importance in tuning the molecular energy gap, and the electronic and steric structures, thus strongly affecting device performances.4 It has been found that a linker with electron-withdrawing properties such as benzothiadiazole,5 benzotriazole,6 quinoxaline,7 diketopyrrolopyrrole,8 squaraine,9 thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, boradiaza-indacene,10 isoindigo,11 and phthalimide,12 is ideal to construct low band gap D–π–A sensitizers for DSCs.
Isoindigo is a structural isomer of the famous pigment indigo, and is often found as an intermediate in drug development.13 Due to the electron-deficient and planar π-conjugated properties, isoindigo units were successfully combined with electron-rich units to construct low band-gap polymer semiconductors used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells.14 Recently, Hua and co-workers reported a series of isoindigo dyes for DSCs, where isoindigo was used as an auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit in combination with a triarylamine electron donor, different aromatic ring linkers and a cyanoacrylic acid electron acceptor.11
In our previous report on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes in DSCs, we demonstrated that a diphenylamine unit, directly connected to an electron-deficient DPP unit, is more favourable for electron communication in D–π–A dyes as compared to the triphenylamine unit.15 In this work, the strategy was employed to create panchromatic isoindigo dyes. Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of two isoindigo dyes (ICD-3 and ICD-4), where diphenylamine and triphenylamine units were used as donors in ICD-3 and ICD-4, respectively, and cyanoacrylic acid was used as an electron acceptor/anchoring group. In addition, two 2-ethyl-hexyl alkyl chains were specifically attached to the periphery of the macrocyclic ring to reduce molecular aggregation as well as to increase solubility.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of isoindigo dyes (ICD3 and ICD4). 
The synthetic details of the two dyes are described in the ESI.† Briefly, the 6,6′-dibromoisoindigo derivative was alkylated by 3-(bromomethyl)heptane in DMF with K2CO3, followed by a Suzuki coupling reaction with 4-formylphenylboronic acid. The resultant mono-bromo isoindigo intermediate reacted with bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl) amine and tri(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)amine, respectively. The corresponding carbaldehydes were finally converted to the target dyes (ICD-3 and ICD-4) via Knoevenagel condensation.
Their UV-Vis absorption spectra examined in dichloromethane solutions are displayed in Fig. 1, and the relevant parameters are collected in the ESI.† Both the dyes showed broad absorption spectra with two absorption bands covering the whole visible region. The first bands are attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated structures, and the second bands may be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). While the first band of both the dyes showed similar absorption regions, the second band of ICD-3 significantly red-shifted with the maximum λmax at 610 nm compared to that of ICD-4 (λmax = 565 nm), in spite of one more additional phenyl unit in the ICD-4 molecule. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficient of ICD-3 (ε = 22400 L mol−1 cm−1) is higher than that of ICD-4 (ε = 20400 L mol−1 cm−1). The results imply that the intramolecular charge transfer may be more efficient for ICD-3.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of ICD-3 and ICD-4 in dichloromethane solution and on a 2 μm thick TiO2 film. 
To investigate the molecular energy levels, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate using ferrocene as an internal standard at 0.63 V vs. NHE. The first oxidation potentials (E+/0) of ICD-3 and ICD-4 were observed to be 0.93 and 0.95 V vs. NHE, respectively. Both the potential values are substantially more positive than that of the iodide/triiodide couple redox (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the ground-state sensitizer regeneration is energetically favorable in DSCs.16 The optical transition energies (E0–0) were 1.61 eV for ICD-3 and 1.70 eV for ICD-4, estimated from the X-intercepts from the tangent of the absorption edges. The excited-state redox potentials, E+/*, determined by subtracting E0–0 from E+/0, were −0.68 eV for ICD-3 and −0.75 eV for ICD-4. Both the values are relatively negative to allow their excited state electron transfer into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE).17
For preparation of the DSCs, a double TiO2 electrode containing a 10 μm transparent layer and a 4 μm scattering layer was employed. The electrode was prepared by the screen printing method, and sintered at 500 °C in air for 30 min, followed by treatment with 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride solution and heat treatment again at 500 °C for 30 min. The prepared TiO2 electrodes were stained in the dye solution of 0.2 mM ICD-3 or ICD-4 in a mixture of acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran (1:1:0.2, v/v/v). In the solution, 20 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) was added as a co-adsorbent to prevent dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. The final devices were prepared in a sandwich-type fashion, where the dyed TiO2 electrode and a Pt-counter electrode were sealed using a hot-melt film, and filled with an I−/I3− electrolyte between them.

Fig. 2a shows action spectra in the form of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs). Both the dye-based devices exhibited a stronger and broader response in the entire visible spectral region with the highest values of 80% at 600 nm and 540 nm for ICD-3 and ICD-4, respectively, indicating that both the dyes have an appropriate energy level alignment in the devices. As compared to that of the ICD-4 based-device, ICD-3 showed much higher efficiency in the red region (570–830 nm), which is consistent with its optical absorption as shown in Fig. 1. The broad and intensive response can enhance the light absorption and thus increase photocurrent density. It should be noted that most DSCs sensitized with a single dye face a challenge to attain a broad spectral response, especially limited to the long wavelength region in the solar spectrum. A high IPCE with a broad spectral response implies an efficient charge transfer upon photo-excitation, partly due to the enhanced ICT and efficient electron communication.18

Fig. 2b shows I–V performance for DSCs with ICD-3 and ICD-4 under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The ICD-3 based-device gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 17.80 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 624 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.68, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η), derived from the equation η = JscVocFF/light intensity of 7.55%, while the ICD-4 based-device gave a Jsc of 14.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 638 mV, a FF of 0.68, and an η of 6.36% under the same conditions. The large difference in the efficiency comes mainly from the difference in the Jscs between them. There was no significant difference in the amount of the dye adsorbed on the electrode surface: 1.11 × 10−7 and 1.02 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for ICD-3 and ICD-4, respectively. The higher Jsc for ICD-3 is consistent with its higher and broader IPCE spectrum as compared with that for ICD-4. For both the devices, the values of Voc are slightly low, partly due to dye aggregation because of their large macrocyclic ring.11 Under the same conditions, the N719-based DSC gave a Jsc of 18.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 728 mV, a FF of 0.69, and an η of 9.15%.
In order to gain insight into the geometrical configuration and electron distribution of the frontier orbitals of the two dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were made at a B3LYP/6-31G level, as shown in Fig. 3. For ICD-3, the electron distribution of the HOMO is homogeneously delocalized over the diphenylamine group and the macrocyclic ring, further extending to the acrylonitrile unit, and the electron distribution of the LUMO is mainly located on the macrocyclic ring and the acrylonitrile unit. In the case of ICD-4, however, the electron distribution of the HOMO is mainly located on the triphenylamine group, slightly extending to the macrocyclic ring. It is clear that the HOMO is obstructed by the additional phenyl unit in ICD-4. For both the dyes, the electron distribution of the LUMO is mainly located on the acrylonitrile unit and the macrocyclic ring. Further investigation was made to optimize their ground-state molecular structures, and the corresponding dihedral angles are presented in the ESI.† As expected, the additional phenyl unit in ICD-4 caused an additional torsion with a dihedral angle of ≈33° between the phenyl unit and the adjacent macrocyclic ring. According to the observation, the electron communication may be more favorable between the donor and the acceptor in ICD-3, allowing an efficient electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2 electrode under light irradiation, resulting in a higher device performance, as compared with that of ICD-4.

In conclusion, two new isoindigo-based dyes ICD-3 and ICD-4 were prepared as sensitizers used in DSCs. It was found that the optical absorption of ICD-3 with a diphenylamine group as a donor was significantly red-shifted about 50 nm as compared to that of ICD-4 with a triphenylamine unit, and correspondingly ICD-3 showed much higher efficiencies in the long wavelength optical region. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the charge transfer may be more favourable in ICD-3. A power conversion efficiency of 7.55% was achieved for ICD-3 based-devices under standard AM 1.5 conditions. Considering the facile synthesis and potential stability, the isoindigo dyes would be a promising option for panchromatic sensitizers used in DSCs. The experimental results would provide valuable, basic guidelines for rational designs of D–π–A molecules for high-performance DSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
