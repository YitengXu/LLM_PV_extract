    , Accepted 1st February 2016First published on 3rd February 2016AbstractThe key requirement for efficient water splitting is to form suitable band bending at the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte. One intuitive approach is to directly induce dipoles inside photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) to render band bending favorable for water splitting. Ferroelectric materials, exhibiting spontaneous polarization, can be one promising material choice for this purpose as their polarization domains can be aligned in the desired direction by a poling process. In this work, we employed ferroelectric phase transformed Li-doped ZnO nanowires (NWs) as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and systematically investigated poling effects. Spontaneous polarization was induced in the NWs in the direction favorable for hole transfer to electrolytes, where the valence band bends upward at the electrolyte interface. Specifically, positively polarized PEC electrodes demonstrated ∼200% improved STH efficiency compared with negatively polarized ones.
Introduction
Hydrogen production by solar-assisted water splitting using semiconductor PECs has gained great attention as a clean and sustainable energy resource.1 A great deal of effort has been devoted to utilize various metal oxides as photoanodes for oxidation of water. The mainstream of research studies has been focused on improving visible absorption of wide bandgap metal oxides by introducing dopants for bandgap tuning or metal particles for plasmonic sensitization.2–6 However, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of metal oxide photoanodes is still very low due to difficulties in overcoming their innately wide-band gap and low conductivity.
ZnO with a wurtzite crystal structure has been widely studied in many fields due to its unique optical and electrical characteristics.7,8 ZnO exhibits ∼10 to 100 times higher electron mobility in comparison to TiO2, which is one of the most widely used photoanode materials.9,10 However, the STH conversion efficiency of ZnO is far less than that of TiO2 due to the high recombination rate and poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of ZnO.11–13 Thus, ZnO has not been actively investigated as a photoanode material. With recent advancements in ZnO-based piezoelectric energy harvesting devices, various methods to enhance the piezoelectric properties of ZnO have been developed.14–18 Consequently, attempts to exploit the piezoelectric potential generated in ZnO for water splitting have been made.19,20 Due to the inherently low piezoelectric coefficient of ZnO21 and its transient piezoelectric potential, it is difficult to obtain stable output performance and high STH conversion efficiency.
Recently, several ferroelectric phase transition methods for ZnO have been introduced, where ZnO is doped either with lithium or vanadium.14,22,23 Thus, spontaneous dipoles can be induced in phase-transformed ZnO and their polarization domain can be aligned by a high voltage poling process. In this way, the piezoelectric coefficient can be greatly enhanced and permanent dipole moment can be easily induced in ZnO, rendering surface band bending favorable for efficient STH conversion.19
In this work, we report ferroelectric ZnO NWs as photoanodes for unassisted photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. We investigated the surface band bending effect on the performance of photoanodes by differently aligning spontaneous dipoles in Li-doped ZnO NWs. Spontaneous polarization formed in the NW can bend the energy band of the photoanode in the direction favorable for hole transfer to electrolytes. Specifically, with positive polarization, performance of PECs was improved to ∼200% in comparison to the opposite polarization direction. Furthermore, poled NWs exhibited photoassisted water splitting in the electrolytes without external bias.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the PEC electrodes with spontaneously polarized Li-doped ZnO NWs is described in Fig. 1. First, Li-doped ZnO NWs were vertically grown on a pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass by the hydrothermal growth process as described in the previous report (see Experimental methods) [Fig. 1(a)]. Briefly, the seed layer was formed by sputtering a 100 nm-thick ZnO film on pre-cleaned ITO glass. Next, ZnO NWs were epitaxially grown on the seed ZnO layer while in situ Li doping in the solution with a Li dopant (50 mM LiNO3) and ZnO precursors (50 mM Zn(NO3)2·H2O:50 mM hexamethylenetetramine = 1:1 dissolved in DI water) was carried out. During the growth, the substrate was floated on the growth solution, facing down the seed layer to the solution. Then, the solution was heated in an oven at 95 °C for 10 h. Finally, the as-grown ZnO NWs were annealed at 550 °C for 1.5 h in an oxygen rich environment to diffuse Li ions into the wurtzite crystal structures of ZnO. Next, an electrical contact was formed on ITO using conductive adhesives and Cu wires for high voltage poling and electrochemical characterization. After the annealing process, Li-doped ZnO NWs were poled in a positive direction or a negative direction under a high electric field (100 kV cm−1). Positive (negative) poling denotes a poling direction that induces the negative (positive) charge at the end of the nanowire interface to electrolytes [Fig. 1(b)].

After poling under high electric field (E-field), induced changes in the crystal structure of the Li-doped ZnO NWs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis.24Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Li-doped ZnO NWs, where the 2θ value is in the range of 25–45°. Here, the c-axis related peaks (2θ = 34.3°) are clearly observed in all the Li-doped ZnO NWs even if they are not poled or poled under different conditions. The black line indicates the intensity of the as-synthesized Li-doped ZnO NWs, which are not poled under high E-field. For the positively poled Li-doped ZnO NWs (red line), the relative peak intensity of c-axis was significantly increased after poling under 100 kV cm−1. In contrast, the relative c-axis peak intensity was rather reduced in the negatively poled Li-doped ZnO NWs. Considering the non-perfect alignment of the NWs on the ITO surface, these changes reveal that applying high E-field can effectively deform the crystal structure of Li-doped ZnO NWs along the c-axis.

To compare light absorption properties, optical bandgaps of Li-doped ZnO NWs poled in different directions were examined. The optical bandgaps of the NWs for each case were calculated using the Tauc plot (αhν2vs. hν) from a direct bandgap transition of the transmission and absorption spectra (ESI Table S1†).25,26 All the NWs show a direct bandgap of ∼3.2 eV regardless of poling directions, which is similar to the values reported for ZnO.27,28 Therefore, the excitation energy for photocurrent generation by light absorption is expected to be similar for all the ZnO NWs.29
Electrochemical characterization was performed to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of ZnO NW PECs depending on polarization conditions. Polarization curves (J vs. V) of ZnO NWs were measured under chopped AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a 3-electrode configuration in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolytes [Fig. 3(a)].28,30 The dark current density levels were very low (below 0.01 mA cm−2) and remained constant under different biases for all ZnO NW PECs. Under illumination, the photocurrent density of positively poled ZnO NWs exhibits the highest value (0.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) compared to that of pristine ZnO NWs (0.44 mA cm−2) and negatively poled ZnO NWs (ca. 0.3 mA cm−2), corresponding to 13.6% and 66.7% enhancement, respectively. Furthermore, the electrode with positively poled ZnO NWs reaches the saturation current level at a lower potential than unpoled and negatively poled ZnO NW electrodes. The faster current saturation (i.e. better fill factor) of positively poled ZnO NWs can be attributed to dipole induced valence band bending of ZnO, where more efficient hole transfer to the electrolytes can be obtained with lower overpotential. Mott–Schottky plots of differently polarized ZnO NWs also indicate band bending effects inside ferroelectric ZnO NWs. Considerably, a low bias is required for water oxidation with positively poled Li-doped ZnO NW photoanodes since induced dipoles bend the energy band upward at the electrolyte interface, favorable for water oxidation. On the other hand, in negatively poled ZnO NW photoanodes, the valence band bend downward at the electrolyte interface, hindering effective hole transfer for water oxidation [ESI Fig. S1†].31,32

The overall PEC performance was estimated by calculating the photon-to-energy conversion efficiency of ZnO NW PECs using the following equation,  where Vapp is the applied potential versus RHE, J is the current density, and P is the power density of incident light [Fig. 3(b)]. The maximum efficiency was obtained in the positively poled ZnO electrode (ηPEC = 0.24%), exhibiting 40% and 71% enhancement, respectively, in comparison to that of unpoled (ηPEC = 0.17%) and negative-poled ZnO (ηPEC = 0.14%) at an applied potential of ∼0.7 V. Electrochemical performance in this study was examined without any co-catalyst or sensitization in order to exclusively observe the polarization effect on water splitting. Thus, we note that further improvement in Jph and Eos can be possible.
To investigate the effect of ferroelectric polarization on PEC water splitting, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were also obtained.32,33 Nyquist plots of the ZnO NW PECs with different polarization directions are described in Fig. 3(c).34 Using the proposed equivalent circuit model for the PEC [Fig. 3(c) (inset)], the electrochemical measurement data were fitted by using Z-view® to estimate the resistance parameters [ESI Table S2†]. A considerably smaller arc diameter of the photoanode with positively polarized NWs compared with that of the photoanode with negatively polarized NWs can be noticed. We note that the arc in Nyquist plots is related to charge transfer at the interface between the photoelectrode and electrolyte. Thus, the arc diameter reduction in EIS Nyquist plots indicates efficient charge transfer. Here, charge transfer resistance of the photoanode (RCT) is increased in the order of positively poled (33 kΩ), unpoled (50 kΩ), and negatively poled (100 kΩ) ZnO NW electrodes. Therefore, the results here clearly demonstrate the role of spontaneous dipoles in the NWs at the interface. Besides, relatively smaller CZnO values were measured for the samples with polarized NWs in comparison to that measured for the sample with unpoled NWs. Due to the induced internal electric field, the depletion region is expanded, resulting in lower CZnO.35 It can also be noticed that all the PECs exhibited solution resistance (Rs) around 10 Ω, indicating a good conduction of electrolytes.
Finally, the performance of Li-doped ZnO photoanodes was examined with a 2-electrode (Pt counter electrode and ZnO NW working electrode) configuration.36 Except the difference in current density, J–V curves of differently polarized ZnO NW electrodes measured in the 2-electrode configuration showed similar trends [Fig. 4(a)]. The onset potential (Eos, defined as the applied potential at Jsc = 0 mA cm−2) was increased in the order of positively poled, unpoled, and negatively poled ZnO, closely related to band bending directions. Above 0.3 V vs. Pt, the current density level is significantly distinguished between ZnO NWs with different poling conditions. Note that, unlike a 3-electrode system under applied bias, spikes are observed in 2-electrode configurations due to the accumulation of carriers at the ZnO/electrolyte interface without the assistance of a catalyst.37 Next, chronoamperometric J–t curves were measured under zero applied bias to observe photocurrents of Li-doped ZnO over a time period [Fig. 4(b)]. Using the positively poled ZnO NW electrode, Jsc instantly reached 0.4 mA cm−2 at the initial illumination but it was gradually decreased and stabilized at ∼0.16 mA cm−2 in 5 s. The STH efficiency, estimated based on the Jsc without applied bias, was about 0.2% for the positively poled ZnO NW electrode, which is higher than the values obtained from negatively poled (0.14%) and unpoled photoanodes (0.1%). Although the STH efficiency is still relatively low, the effect of spontaneous polarization direction on water splitting is systematically demonstrated and there is room for improvement by adopting better piezoelectric or ferroelectric materials with the assistance of OER electrocatalysts.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated the effect of spontaneous dipoles induced in Li–ZnO NWs on the performance of PEC water splitting. Specifically, the photocurrent of the positively poled PEC electrode was about 70% higher than that of the negatively poled one thanks to favorable band bending. Besides, the STH efficiency of water splitting is improved 200% compared with that of the negatively poled electrode. The work introduced here provides the design concepts of self-biased PEC electrodes with the assistance of internal spontaneous bias.
Experimental
Li-doped ZnO NW synthesis
The ZnO film (100 nm) was deposited onto an ITO coated glass substrate as a seed layer, using magnetron sputtering. For the growth solution preparation, the zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·H2O, Sigma Aldrich) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, Sigma Aldrich) (1:1 = 50 mM:50 mM) were first dissolved in deionized water (DI) [50 mL]. Next, 50 mM of lithium nitrate (LiNO3, Sigma Aldrich) was poured in the prepared solution as a Li-doping reagent and the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h on a magnetic stirring plate. The substrate with the ZnO seed layer was placed on the surface of the prepared solution while facing the seed surface downward. During the hydrothermal growth process, the sample was levitated in the container. Then, it was kept in an oven at 95 °C for 10 h. After the growth process, the substrate was cleaned with DI water and subsequently annealed in the furnace at 550 °C for 1 h 30 min in an oxygen ambient atmosphere. Finally, the ZnO NWs were poled at 65 °C for 20 h under a high electric field of 100 kV cm−1.
Materials characterization

Electrochemical characterization. 
For a 3-electrode configuration, the J–V curves were measured using Li-doped ZnO NWs/ITO as the working electrode, Pt meshes as the counter electrode, and the saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 5.8) as the electrolyte. For a 2-electrode configuration, the J–V curves were monitored using Li-doped ZnO as the working electrode and Pt-meshes as the counter electrode. A potentiostat (IviumStat, Ivium technologies) was used for all electrochemical characterization. A simulated solar light with an AM 1.5 filter (100 mW cm−2 intensity adjusted with 1 sun detector, Model CS-20, Asahi Spectra) was provided using an AAA solar simulator (Model HAL-320, Asahi Spectra), and the ZnO side of working electrodes faced the light source. The Mott–Schottky plot and Nyquist plot were measured under dark conditions.38


Physical characterization. 
UV/VIS was measured using a spectrometer (MC-9800, Otsuka Electronics), and the Tauc plot was calculated to estimate the band-gap of Li-doped ZnO NWs.39 ZnO NW morphologies were monitored using a scanning electron microscope (HD-2300A, Hitachi). XRD data of ZnO NWs were measured using a XRD diffractometer (D/MAX-2200, Rigaku International Corporation).
