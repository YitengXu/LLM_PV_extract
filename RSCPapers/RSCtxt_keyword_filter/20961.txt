    , Accepted 27th July 2020First published on 27th July 2020AbstractEco-friendly polymer solar cells (eco-PSCs) based on aqueous-soluble conjugated materials have recently received great research attention. In this work, we report the development of an aqueous-processable C70-based fullerene derivative (PC71BO15) for eco-PSCs processed by water/ethanol co-solvents. The desirable aggregation behavior and enhanced light absorption ability of PC71BO15 have enabled the fabrication of PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 2.51%, which is the highest value reported to date for aqueous-processed PSCs. These PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs exhibit significantly higher PCEs than those of the reference PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 devices over all device-processable water/ethanol compositions. At the optimal water/ethanol composition (v/v = 15:85), the PCE of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs is 73% higher than that of the PC61BO15-based counterparts, as a result of enhanced light absorption. Importantly, the PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs show much higher tolerance in their PCEs to the water/ethanol composition. For example, the PCEs of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs at a 30:70 water/ethanol ratio maintain 89% of the optimal performance at a 15:85 ratio, whereas the PC61BO15-based devices only maintain 45%. This large difference in terms of water-tolerant behavior is mainly related to the different aggregation behaviors between PC71BO15 and PC61BO15 in blend films, which are carefully investigated using electrical, optical and morphological characterizations. This high water composition-tolerance affords an excellent reproducibility of the PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs with eco/human-friendly aqueous processing under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention as future power sources due to their solution-processability, energy level tunability, flexibility and stretchability.1–8 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have increased rapidly above 17% due to the development of a variety of electroactive materials and the optimization of device fabrication processes.9–15 From the perspective of practical and industrial applications of PSCs, nevertheless, the use of eco-friendly processing suitable for the environmentally sustainable fabrication of PSCs is crucial and inevitable. In this context, a wide range of halogen-free solvents (e.g. xylenes, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, etc.) have been recently suggested as candidates for green solvent systems in the fabrication of efficient PSCs.16–23 However, these solvents are still not ideal choices as their toxicity presents a potential concern regarding environmental protection and human health. To realize the truly eco-friendly production of PSCs, adopting aqueous solution processing using water/alcohol co-solvents is widely considered as one of the most promising strategies.24–29 Several examples of eco-friendly PSCs have been reported with the development of water/alcohol-soluble electroactive materials containing hydrophilic ionic30–32 and non-ionic side chains.24–27,33
Recently, the meaningful enhancement of PCEs in aqueous-processed eco-friendly polymer solar cells (eco-PSCs) has been achieved by the development of polymer donors and electron acceptors containing oligoethyleneglycol (OEG) based non-ionic and hydrophilic side chains.24–27 For example, a representative eco-PSC system using poly[(2,5-bis(1,3-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)propan-2-yloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT-A) as an electron donor and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid [3,4,5]-tri(ethylene glycol)-benzoic acid methyl ester (PC61BO12) as an electron acceptor was developed.24,26 To achieve high performance for the eco-PSCs using the OEG-based materials, one of the key strategies was to utilize water/ethanol co-solvents with appropriate water/ethanol compositions to ensure the formation of desirable bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology without serious aggregation during the solution processing. However, despite the successful fabrication of eco-PSCs, the optimal BHJ morphology and their device performances can only be achieved at an extremely narrow processing window (i.e., water/ethanol composition). Accordingly, even a minimal deviation from the optimal water/ethanol ratio can cause a significant reduction in the PCEs of eco-PSCs, and it significantly lowers the reproducibility and reliability of eco-PSCs. In general, the use of co-solvents or solvent additives is often unavoidable to achieve the maximum PCEs by obtaining the optimal degree of phase separation, domain purity and crystallinity in BHJ blends.34–36 However, they often prevent the reproducible and large-scale production of the PSCs mainly due to the differences in their boiling points (especially for the solvent additive), volatility, and viscosity.37 For example, when solvent additives with high-boiling points (e.g., 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) are used, even a small change in volume fraction within 0.5–1 vol% of the total amount of a co-solvent significantly affects the formation of BHJ blend morphology and the photovoltaic performance.34,38 Therefore, for the case of the PSCs that require a co-solvent process, it is crucial to ensure a wide processing window with enhanced tolerances against different processing parameters.39 However, the systematic investigation on the effects of co-solvent composition on the morphological, electrical and photovoltaic properties of eco-friendly PSCs has rarely been reported to date.24
Herein, we report a new C70-based fullerene acceptor containing an optimal length of OEG hydrophilic side chain (PC71BO15) for efficient eco-PSCs, which has a high water composition-tolerance of device performance using a water/ethanol co-solvent system. A C60-fullerene based acceptor (PC61BO15) containing the same OEG hydrophilic side chains is synthesized to serve as a reference for the comparisons of the PCEs and water composition-tolerances of eco-PSCs with PPDT2FBT-A as the electron donor. Fabricated using an optimal water/ethanol composition (v/v = 15:85), the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs exhibit a PCE of 2.51%, outperforming the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15-based devices with a PCE of 1.45%. This is mainly attributed to both the desirable BHJ blend morphology and the enhanced light absorption ability of PC71BO15 over PC61BO15.40 In addition, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs exhibit significantly higher PCEs than those of the reference PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 devices over all the device processable water/ethanol compositions. More importantly, the PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs show much higher tolerance to the water/ethanol composition. This large difference in the photovoltaic parameters between the two types of PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) eco-PSCs depending on the water/ethanol ratio is mainly related to the phase-separated morphologies affected by different aggregation behaviors of PC71BO15 and PC61BO15. As a result, the PCEs of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs show little change against the water ratio, which maintains 89% of the optimal performance even at a 30:70 (v/v) water/ethanol ratio, whereas only 45% of the optimal performance is maintained for the PC61BO15-based devices. To understand the different water composition-dependent photovoltaic trends in these eco-PSCs based on PC71BO15 and PC61BO15, we performed detailed characterizations of the electrical, optical and charge generation properties, as well as morphological and aggregation behaviors, for the films processed using different water compositions.
Results and discussion
A series of water/ethanol soluble fullerene derivatives, named PC71BO15 and PC61BO15, were synthesized by incorporating OEG solubilizing groups into C70 and C60-based backbones, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). PCyBMs (y = 71 or 61) were converted into their respective acyl chlorides, named PCyBC (y = 71 or 61), followed by esterification with the OEG chains where terminal functionality is a hydroxyl group (–OH). Detailed synthetic routes for the aqueous-processable fullerenes are provided in Scheme S1 (ESI†). We selected the C70-fullerene core to increase the light harvesting ability of PC71BO15 compared to the C60 counterpart, and to control the aggregation behaviors in solution and the BHJ morphology of the resulting film.41 Also, to produce a domain network with tightly-packed acceptors for efficient charge transport, we firstly synthesized PC71BO12 which has shorter OEG chains than PC71BO15. However, the PC71BO12 was not soluble in water/ethanol co-solvents regardless of their composition even at an elevated temperature (Fig. S2, ESI†), which prevents its use in device fabrication. Thus, the OEG chain with a longer length was introduced to produce PC71BO15, which gives enough solubilities for device fabrication (Fig. S3, ESI†). With more than 30% water content, PC71BO15 and PC61BO15 show quite limited solubility, so we conducted experiments using water content from 10% to 30% as a means to circumvent the severe solubility issue when comparing PC71BO15 and PC61BO15. For a comparative study, the C60-based fullerene, PC61BO15, having the same OEG chains as PC71BO15 was synthesized. The UV-vis absorption of the PC71BO15 and PC61BO15 thin films processed from 15:85 (v/v) water/ethanol mixtures is shown in Fig. 1b. We denote a co-solvent system of water/ethanol with a water volume fraction of X as WATER-X. For example, the 15:85 (v/v) water/ethanol mixture is written as WATER-15. PC71BO15 shows much stronger absorption in the range between 350 and 700 nm due to the non-symmetric nature of the C70 core.42–44 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the two different fullerene derivatives were estimated from the measurements of cyclic voltammetry and the optical bandgap (Fig. S4, ESI†). The HOMO/LUMO levels of PC71BO15 and PC61BO15 are very similar as −5.69/−3.83 eV and −5.68/−3.84 eV, respectively. Thus, the PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs can harvest more photons in the visible regime compared to the PC61BO15-based devices while their open-circuit voltages (Voc) are expected to be similar.

The eco-PSCs using the water/ethanol-soluble donor PPDT2FBT-A and two fullerene acceptors (PC71BO15 and PC61BO15) were fabricated using a conventional device architecture consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/crosslinked poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (c-PEDOT:PSS)/PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61)/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al. The detailed device fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental section. In addition, the molecular properties of the PPDT2FBT-A donor used in this study are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Devices using the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 active layers exhibited a maximum PCE of 2.51% (Voc = 0.75 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) = 6.23 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 0.54), which is significantly higher than that of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 system (PCEmax = 1.45%, Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 4.06 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.49) with a similar thickness of active layer (∼80 nm) as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1.26 The improved Jsc and PCEs of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs were mainly ascribed to the enhanced light harvesting capability of PC71BO15 compared to that of PC61BO15.44 This trend was well-correlated with the changes of their spectral responses shown in both the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves and blend thin-film UV-vis spectra as shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), respectively. The PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs generated a substantially higher Jsc in the entire wavelength range of 400–700 nm, with a higher maximum EQE value of 35.3%, as compared to that (21.9%) of PC61BO15-based devices. Interestingly, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs not only showed a higher PCE, but also showed a higher water ratio-tolerance than the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 eco-PSCs when fabricated from WATER-10 to WATER-30 (Fig. 2b and Table S2, ESI†). In both eco-PSCs, WATER-15 processed devices had the highest efficiencies. However, as the water content in the co-solvent increased from WATER-15 to WATER-30, two different types of eco-PSC systems showed completely different photovoltaic behaviors. For example, the PCE of PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 at a ratio of WATER-30, which is the highest water content available for device fabrication, exhibited 89% of the optimal performance compared to PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 showing 45% of the optimal performance.

To investigate the effects of solvent compositions (WATER-X) on the charge transport properties of eco-PSCs, hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Table 2).45 Both the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blends exhibited the highest hole and electron mobilities at WATER-15 with the values of μh = 7.31 × 10−5/μe = 1.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 9.47 × 10−5/μe = 7.00 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results are well-correlated with the highest Jsc and PCE values at WATER-15 in each eco-PSC as shown in Fig. 2b and Table S2 (ESI†). In addition, as the WATER-X increased from WATER-10 to WATER-30, the μh/μe values of the PC61BO15-based devices significantly increased from 8.4 to 26.0, while the PC71BO15-based devices showed well-balanced μh/μe values regardless of WATER-X. This imbalance of charge mobilities in PC61BO15-based devices is known to deteriorate Jsc and FF values in PSCs by causing undesirable charge recombination processes.26,46,47 Therefore, the completely different trends of the μh/μe values as a function of WATER-X clearly support the dissimilar water ratio-tolerances of the photovoltaic performances.

To obtain a deeper insight into the effect of the water ratio on the charge recombination properties of the eco-PSCs, the dependences of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (P) were measured. Fig. 3a and b show Jsc values of the PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) devices plotted as a function of P on a log–log scale, by which the degree of the photocurrent loss due to bimolecular recombination can be described. In general, the relationship between Jsc and P can be expressed using a power law (Jsc ∝ Pα).48 The α value becomes closer to 1 when the photocurrent loss from bimolecular recombination is insignificant. Among the various WATER-X, the WATER-15 devices showed α values closest to 1 in both PC71BO15-based (α = 0.95) and PC61BO15-based (α = 0.93) devices, which corroborate the highest Jsc value processed from WATER-15. Moreover, the α value of the PC71BO15 device was almost maintained, while the degree of bimolecular recombination significantly varied in the PC61BO15-based device depending on the water content. The highly unchanged charge recombination properties of PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs could induce overall high Jsc and FF values in a wide range of water content, whereas a large number of free charges fail to travel to the electrodes in the PC61BO15 counterparts with an increase of water contents. These results were well-correlated with the imbalanced μh/μe and the much reduced PCE of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 device at WATER-30.

Similarly, the dependence of Voc on P was also measured for the PC71BO15- and PC61BO15-based devices (Fig. 3c and d), respectively. The slope (S) gives kBTq−1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is an absolute temperature, and q is elementary charge. The S values of the PC71BO15-based devices which were closer to 1 than the PC61BO15-based devices at all water ratios imply that the monomolecular recombination in the PC71BO15-based devices was more likely suppressed regardless of the water ratio.49,50 Notably, at a higher water content of WATER-30, the PC61BO15 blend exhibited a significantly higher S value of 1.48 kBTq−1 than that of the PC71BO15 blend (1.30 kBTq−1), reflecting the water ratio-tolerant feature of the PC71BO15 eco-PSCs.
To support the different water ratio-tolerant behaviors of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 devices, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical microscopy (OM) images were acquired (Fig. 4 and Fig. S7, ESI†). In Fig. 4a, PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 showed well-intermixed morphologies except for the WATER-30 sample where PC71BO15 agglomerates appeared. In contrast, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend films showed more dramatic morphological changes as the water ratio increased, beginning at a lower water content (WATER-20) as shown in Fig. 4b. Similar trends were also observed through the AFM measurements (Fig. 4c and d), while the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from the AFM surface topologies was relatively well-maintained for the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blends depending on the water content, as compared to that of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend films which significantly changed. For example, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend film processed with WATER-30 exhibited more than a two-fold increase (1.68 → 4.47 nm) of the RMS roughness compared to the WATER-15 sample. Since such an excessively phase-separated BHJ morphology can lead to an increase of trap sites and inefficient charge transfer/collection,51–53 these results corroborate the poor water ratio-tolerance of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 eco-PSCs.

To be more specific, the morphological changes depending on (1) the water ratio and (2) the types of fullerene acceptors can be explained by the following two aspects. First, the coarse morphologies observed at the higher WATER-X films in both fullerene systems can be attributed to the poor solubility of PPDT2FBT-A and PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) in the water-dominant solvent after the early evaporation of ethanol (Fig. S3, ESI†).24 More importantly, the more phase-separated BHJ morphology of the PC61BO15 system can be ascribed to the stronger aggregation-driven phase separation behavior of PC61BO15 than PC71BO15, which is discussed in detail in the following section.54–57 In short, (1) the differences in boiling point and volatility between water and ethanol (water: 100 °C and 2.33 kPa, ethanol: 78 °C and 5.95 kPa) in the co-solvents,58,59 and (2) different self-aggregation behaviors of PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) in each blend film have significantly affected the thin-film morphology formation and consequently the electrical and photovoltaic properties in terms of WATER-X.24
The differences of aggregation behavior of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 systems at various water ratios were thoroughly examined by monitoring the optical properties via UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 5). In line with the TEM and AFM results, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend films showed very different aggregation behaviors depending on the water content. In the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blends, the vibronic peak (∼650 nm), resulting from the aggregation of the PPDT2FBT-A donor, showed little changes with various water content and remained almost unchanged.24,26 In contrast, the vibronic peak of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend continually increased at high water content over WATER-20, implying that the PPDT2FBT-A donor became more aggregated.24 In addition, it should be noted that the distinct peak at 330 nm, which originated from the self-aggregation of fullerene cores, obviously appeared in the PC61BO15 devices processed from high water content (i.e., WATER-25 and WATER-30).26,60 Thus, the observations from the UV-vis experiment support the aggregation of PC61BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A, which likely induces severe phase separation in the morphology of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend and hinders efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer.61 On the other hand, PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blend films did not show distinct changes in the donor and acceptor peaks depending on the water content. It is indicated that PPDT2FBT-A and PC71BO15 are relatively well-mixed with suppressed aggregation, which is consistent with the better water composition-tolerant photovoltaic performances measured across a range of water/ethanol co-solvent compositions. We hypothesized that the observations mainly originated from the differences of molecular structures between PC71BO15 and PC61BO15. Thus, not only the larger molecular size of the C70-core but also the presence of isomers in PC71BO15 due to the non-symmetric shape of the C70-core could lower the tendency of self-aggregation of PC71BO15 in the BHJ blend of eco-PSCs.54,55

To further investigate the differences of morphological behaviors between the two systems processed from WATER-10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 co-solvents, charge generation and transfer properties at the PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) interfaces were examined by measuring the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency (Fig. 6).62 The excitation wavelength of 640 nm was chosen to predominately excite the PPDT2FBT-A donor (electron transfer).27 As shown in Fig. 6, the PL quenching efficiencies exhibited the highest value of 96.6% for the PC71BO15-based blend and 95.9% for the PC61BO15-based blend at WATER-15, suggesting that the WATER-15 processed active layers generate free charge carriers most efficiently at the donor/acceptor interfaces.63 Also, at all the water fractions, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blend films showed higher PL quenching efficiencies than the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blend films, which is correlated well with the higher performance of the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 devices. Importantly, while the PL quenching efficiencies for the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blend films were maintained from 96.6% (WATER-15) to 94.6% (WATER-30), those for the PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 blends dropped significantly from 95.9% (WATER-15) to 88.9% (WATER-30). This result indicates that the morphological transition of the PC61BO15-based blend toward stronger phase separation at higher water content leads to inefficient free charge generation in the blend films. Due to the lower tendency of the self-aggregation property of PC71BO15, the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 blend films have a higher degree of intermixing between PC71BO15 and PPDT2FBT-A, which is favorable for generating free charges at the donor/acceptor interfaces.57,64 The combined results from the TEM, AFM, UV-vis spectroscopy, and PL measurements clearly suggest that the aggregation behaviors of PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) significantly affect their blend morphologies with PPDT2FBT-A and consequently the water composition-tolerance in eco-PSCs.65–67 In particular, the PC71BO15 acceptor showing desirable aggregation behaviors and morphologies is expected to lead to very reproducible and tolerant PCEs in various co-solvent ratios.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized an OEG-containing C70-core based fullerene derivative, PC71BO15, which can be processed from environmentally benign water/ethanol mixtures for the fabrication of eco-PSCs. A PCE of 2.51% was achieved with the PPDT2FBT-A:PC71BO15 eco-PSCs, which was much higher than 1.45% for the reference PPDT2FBT-A:PC61BO15 devices, as a result of the enhanced light harvesting property of PC71BO15. Importantly, it was found that the PC71BO15-based eco-PSCs exhibited much higher tolerance in their PCEs against the water/ethanol composition of the processing co-solvents than the PC61BO15-based devices. These different photovoltaic behaviors depending on the water/ethanol composition for the PC71BO15 and PC61BO15-based thin films were also well-reflected on the charge mobility balance (μh/μe), exciton dissociation, charge generation and recombination. Stronger self-aggregation behaviors of PC61BO15 compared to PC71BO15 in the PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) blend films at a high water content (WATER-30) were consistently observed by a series of microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. Thus, we conclude that tuning the aggregation behaviors of the fullerene acceptors in water/ethanol-based aqueous processes has significant impacts on their BHJ blend morphologies and consequently the water composition-tolerance in eco-PSCs. Our findings in this work provide a comprehensive understanding of the fullerene aggregation-blend morphology-device function relationship, and serve as important guidelines for the design of efficient eco-PSC systems with high tolerance to processing parameters.
Experimental
Materials
Phenyl-C71 & C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM and PC61BM 99%) were prepared from Nanoholdings, Inc., and were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.5%), dichloromethane (DCM, 99.5%), toluene (99.0%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35%), and carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.0%) were purchased from Samchun Chemicals. Tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether (95%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%), p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (98%), potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 99.5%), potassium iodide (KI, 99.5%), methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (98%), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4, 2.0 M in THF), and acetic acid (99%), were bought from TCI. PPDT2FBT-A was successfully polymerized using a previously reported method.27
Characterization
The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectra could be obtained using a Bruker Autoflex mass spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). Absorption coefficients of the pristine donor polymer and PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) were obtained in the WATER-15 co-solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured using a CHI 600C electrochemical analyzer with three electrodes, comprised of a wire counter electrode (Pt), a working electrode (Pt) and a reference electrode (Ag) with a scan rate at 10 mV s−1. The fullerene acceptors were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) for the CV measurements. The solubility of PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) in water/ethanol was determined by heating the solutions to produce oversaturated solutions, followed by cooling the solutions to room temperature, and filtering through a 0.22 μm-pore polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The mass of solution which passed the PVDF filter was decided by a tared vial, followed by evaporating the solution under vacuum (<0.1 mTorr) to measure the mass of filtered PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity (Đ) of the PPDT2FBT-A used in this study were measured by size exclusion chromatography eluting with 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 80 °C (concentration: 10 mg mL−1, flow rate: 10 mL min−1). TEM was operated on a JEOL 2000FX 200 kV instrument. The TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting blend films onto copper grids attached to glass under optimized device fabricating conditions. AFM images could be obtained using a ScanAsyst mode under ambient conditions (AFM, MultiMode 8, Bruker). OM measurements were performed to analyze the morphology of active layer films processed by water/ethanol co-solvents (Nikon, Eclipse 80i). PL quenching efficiencies with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer.
Fabrication of eco-PSCs
To check the efficiency of the eco-PSCs, a conventional type device (ITO/c-PEDOT:PSS/PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61)/PFN/Al) architecture was utilized.24,68 All the active layers of the eco-PSC devices were processed in air without the use of a N2-filled glove box. Before fabrication, the ITO substrates were washed by ultrasonication using acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol solvent in a sequence. After the rinsing step, the substrate was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 20 min. After the ITO substrate was plasma-treated for 10 min, the PEDOT:PSS solution with 0.125 vol% of the thermal crosslinker (3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, GOPS) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s.68,69 Then, the substrates were thermally annealed at 165 °C for 40 min under ambient conditions to form a complete thermal crosslinked state, and to preserve the PEDOT:PSS films during the subsequent aqueous processing of the upper active layer. The blend solution for the active layers of 80 nm thickness was prepared with a donor (PPDT2FBT-A) concentration of 5 mg mL−1 and a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:2.5 (w/w). After stirring the solution at 80 °C for 1 h, it was spin-coated on the ITO/c-PEDOT:PSS substrate at 1500 rpm for 40 s. To eliminate the residual water, the active layers were dried under high vacuum conditions (10−6 Torr) overnight. The PFN polymer for the electron transporting layer was then dissolved in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1 with 0.1 vol% of acetic acid) and spin-coated on the active layer, followed by 100 nm-thick Al electrode deposition. For the water-ratio tolerance experiments, the device architecture of ITO/c-PEDOT:PSS/PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61)/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide (PNDIT-F3N-Br) (1.0 mg mL−1 in MeOH)/(Ag) was used.70
Characterization of eco-PSCs
The area of active layers was measured to be 0.164 cm2 using an optical microscope. The J–V curves were measured at AM 1.5G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2) under ambient conditions (K201 LAB55, McScience). The solar simulator meets the criterion with ASTM standard AAA rating. The calibration of the solar simulator was done using a silicon reference cell (K801S-K302, McScience). EQE was measured on a spectral measurement instrument (K3100 IQX, McScience, Inc.) equipped with a 300 W Xenon arc lamp filtered by an optical chopper (MC2000, Thorlabs) and a monochromator (Newport). The calculated Jsc values were obtained from the EQE measurements by integrating the AM 1.5G solar spectra, and the values agreed well with the measured Jsc values, within a 6% error. By using the SCLC method, the charge mobilities of the PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61) active layers were measured with a hole-only device architecture of ITO/c-PEDOT:PSS/PPDT2FBT-A:PCyBO15 (y = 71 or 61)/Au(80 nm) and an electron-only device architecture of ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO)/blend film/Ca(20 nm)/Al(80 nm). Current–voltage measurements were obtained in the range of 0–6 V, and the results were matched with the Mott–Gurney equation as follows:  where ε0 is the vacuum space permittivity, ε is the blend film dielectric constant, μ is the charge mobility, V is the potential across the device related to the loss of potential attributed to the series resistance Vrs of the electrode and built-in potential Vbi (V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi), and L is the blend film thickness.71
