The strong interaction between ZnO and the –SH group of EDT contributes to the formation of a homogeneous film of ZnO@EDT. Meanwhile, EDT could passivate the surface defects and increase the electron mobility of ZnO effectively. Compared to bare ZnO, ZnO@EDT could increase electron extraction and facilitate photoinduced carrier generation. As a result, the inverted polymer solar cell based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with ZnO@EDT as an electron transporting layer delivered an enhanced PCE of 8.0%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread attention due to their advantages of low cost, being reproducible, availability of large area devices and flexible substrate process.1 Recently, bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) PSCs with a mixture of electron donor polymers and electron acceptor fullerene derivatives have made significant progress and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 11%.2 In the last few years, the inverted architecture (transparent cathode/electron transporting layer/active layer/anode transporting layer/anode) of BHJ PSCs has been widely admired, due to its higher efficiency3 and better stability4 than the conventional structure.
In the inverted PSCs, there is always an electron transporting layer between the active layer and the ITO cathode, such as zinc oxide (ZnO),4,5 titanium oxide (TiOx),6 other n-type metal oxides7 and conjugated polymers,8 to reduce the energy barrier between the active layer and ITO. Among these electron transporting layers, ZnO is one of the most important interfacial materials, because of its high visible light transmittance and the broad bandgap. The ZnO transporting layer not only shows good photoelectricity property but also possesses excellent electrical conductivity and ease of synthesis. However, the challenges in using solution-processed ZnO films as the electron transporting layer are passivation of a large number of traps with adsorbed oxygen on the surface9–11 and a high degree of aggregation of nanoparticles in most areas.5,12
Many strategies have been developed to passivate the surface defects of solution-processed ZnO films.13 For example, depositing an interfacial dipole layer or an ionic liquid surface modifier, such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM),14,15 a polyelectrolyte (PE),16 a polar solvent,17,18 or an alcohol/water soluble conjugated polymer,19,20 on top of ZnO films can avoid the direct contact between electron transporting layers and active layers. However, the defects in ZnO electron transporting layers are not effectively passivated by these methods yet. The incorporation of a coordination polymer into ZnO to form ZnO–polymer composites is another method to achieve a modified ZnO transporting layer. Coordination polymers such as poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO),21 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),22 the non-conjugated polymer polyethylenimine (PEI)23 or conjugated polymers poly(9,9-bis-(6′-diethoxylphosphorylhexyl)fluorene) (PFEP) and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)24–26 directly mixed with ZnO nanoparticles were found to effectively passivate the surface defects of ZnO nanoparticles; as a result, the PCE of the devices was improved by introduction of these ZnO–polymer composite transporting layers.22,27 Unexpectedly, the effective passivation comes at the expense of decreased charge transport properties of the electron transporting layer, due to the existence of too much insulated polymer. According to the literature, the functional small-molecule 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) could also be applied to passivate the surface defects of ZnO nanoparticles. Bai et al. have used EDT to modify ZnO in the previous work by soaking ZnO films in an acetonitrile solution containing EDT.28 However, this treatment just provided the modification and passivation on the surface of the ZnO films, without making most use of the EDT. Therefore, a facile and general approach that can effectively passivate the defects of solution-processed ZnO electron transporting layers (ETLs) is highly desirable and critical to fully exploit their remarkable properties for inverted BHJ PSCs.
Herein, ZnO doped with EDT (ZnO@EDT) prepared by an in situ growth approach was developed as an electron transporting layer (ETL) to improve the performance of inverted PSCs. EDT was mixed with the ZnO precursor solution, ensuring that EDT could have sufficient contact with ZnO. During the in situ growth, EDT could modify the ZnO fully, not merely the surface. Compared with bare ZnO, ZnO@EDT presents more homogeneous morphology with less defects, higher electron mobility, more effective photoinduced carrier collection and a weaker bimolecular recombination. Meanwhile, the EDT doping could decrease the work function of the ZnO layer to improve the extraction of electrons from the active layer. As a result, the inverted polymer solar cell based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with ZnO@EDT as an ETL delivered an enhanced PCE of 8.0%.
Results and discussion
The procedure for the fabrication of ZnO@EDT ETLs, the inverted device architecture and the chemical structures of all materials used for device preparation are presented in Fig. 1. The ZnO@EDT composite was prepared by an in situ growth and the preparation details are described in the Experimental section. The ZnO@EDT precursor solution was prepared via adding different weights of EDT to the ZnO precursor solution. Here, ZnO@0.1% EDT, ZnO@0.5% EDT and ZnO@5% EDT representing 0.1% EDT, 0.5% EDT and 5% EDT in weight percentage were added to the ZnO precursor solution, respectively. In order to study the function of EDT in determining the morphology of the ZnO film, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the bare ZnO film shows a rough surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 2.56 nm. After treated with EDT, all the ZnO@EDT films show a homogeneous surface with lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values. Due to the strong interaction between ZnO and the –SH group of EDT, EDT could attach to the surface of ZnO to prevent the aggregation.28 Although the annealing temperature is comparatively low (200 °C), all the ZnO and ZnO@EDT films exhibited the characteristic peaks of X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†). These peaks of ZnO@0.1% EDT and ZnO@0.5% EDT are stronger than those of the pristine ZnO, indicating a better crystallinity for ZnO@0.1% EDT and ZnO@0.5% EDT.29–31 However, as the weight percentage increases further, the intensity of the peaks of the ZnO@5% EDT film becomes weaker, resulting from too much EDT that interrupted the crystallization of ZnO. In addition, the addition of EDT could affect the wettability of the ZnO film. As depicted by contact angle testing (Fig. S3, ESI†), the contact angle of ZnO@EDT improved slightly as the weight percentage of EDT increases. The more hydrophobic surface allows it to produce good contact with the upper layer.

The compositions of pristine ZnO and ZnO@EDT were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2a, the Zn 2p3/2 binding energy of pristine ZnO located at 1021.7 eV is assigned to the Zn–O bonds.5 The position of the Zn 2p3/2 peak for all the ZnO@EDT films shifts toward a higher binding energy, implying that electronic states of ZnO are different as the literature reported.32,33 This is because EDT has a doping effect on ZnO. The O 1s XPS spectrum contains two typical peaks at about 530 eV and 531.5 eV (Fig. 2b), which correspond to O2− ions in the Zn–O bonds and O2− ions in the oxygen deficient regions, respectively.34 The intensity of the peak at 530 eV for all the ZnO@EDT samples is stronger than that of bare ZnO. It can be inferred that EDT can facilitate the in situ growth of ZnO nanoparticles and passivate the defects of ZnO. At the same time, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were employed to verify the effect of EDT modification on the surface defects of ZnO nanoparticles, and the PL spectra of all the samples recorded under photoexcitation at different wavelengths are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The PL spectra recorded under photoexcitation at 325 nm are shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the narrow emission band at 373 nm is assigned to the band-edge emission. Additionally, the spectrum shows three emission bands in the blue region and the green region. The two emission bands in the blue region are attributed to transitions involving Zn interstitial defect states.35 The emission band in the green region is ascribed to surface defects.36 Obviously, the defect emission peaks of all the ZnO@EDT samples are weaker than those of pristine ZnO, indicating that EDT reduced the surface traps of ZnO. Similarly, the PL spectra recorded under photoexcitation at 310 nm (Fig. S4b, ESI†) exhibit the same tendency.

To study the effect of EDT doping on the electrical properties of ZnO, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed. The HOMO energy is determined according to the following equation:37EHOMO = hν − (EHOMOonset − Ecutoff)
where hν is the incident photon energy (hν = 21.2eV), and Ecutoff is obtained from the high binding energy cutoff of the spectrum in the left panel38 and EonsetHOMO is obtained from the right panel (Fig. 3a). The calculated HOMO energies for pristine ZnO and ZnO with 0.1%, 0.5%, and 5% EDT are −7.63 eV, −7.53 eV, −7.35 eV and −7.55 eV, respectively. By using these HOMO energies and the optical bandgap derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3b), the LUMO energy levels are −4.31 eV for bare ZnO, −4.20 eV for ZnO with 0.1% EDT, −4.00 eV for ZnO with 0.5% EDT, and −4.18 eV for ZnO with 5% EDT.39 The decreased work function of ZnO@EDT could be attributed to the surface defect passivation by EDT. Fig. 3c displays the energy level alignment of the PSC devices with ZnO and ZnO@EDT ETLs. The increased LUMO energy level of ZnO@EDT is closer to that of a fullerene acceptor, which is favorable for transportation of electrons.40

Since the addition of an appropriate weight percentage of EDT is favorable for ZnO nucleation and crystal growth, the electron mobility is expected to be improved. Therefore, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was employed to determine the change in the electron mobility of ZnO with and without doping. The curves of the SCLC model for ZnO and ZnO@EDT by using an electron-only device structure and the corresponding electron mobility values calculated using the Mott–Gurney SCLC equation are all shown in Fig. 4.41,42 The electron mobility of the device with bare ZnO is 3.26 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, ZnO@0.5% EDT shows the highest electron mobility of 6.84 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is suggested that the higher electron mobility of ZnO@EDT is due to good crystallinity and surface defect passivation.

As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the optical transmission spectra of all the samples showed similar profiles with high transmittance over 89%, which indicate that ZnO@EDT is suitable for the inverted PSCs as ETLs. The EDT modified ZnO was then employed as an electron transporting layer in PSCs, and the optimized ratio of EDT to ZnO was determined by fabricating devices based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding parameters of the devices are listed in Table 1. The device with a pristine ZnO ETL exhibits a PCE of 6.8% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.83 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 63.8%. The incorporation of 0.1% and 0.5% EDT in ZnO remarkably improves the PCE together with an improvement in JSC and FF. And ZnO with 0.5% EDT achieved the highest PCE of 8.0%, a JSC of 16.25 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.2% and a VOC of 0.73 V. There was no significant promotion in VOC. The work functions of ZnO@EDT films are all lower than 4.3 eV, which results in the Fermi-level pinning to the negative polarons of PC71BM.43 Generally, when Fermi-level pinning occurs, the work-function difference in the charge transport layer is not the main factor affecting the built-in electric field and VOC. In this case, the difference in the quasi-Fermi levels of the donor and acceptor phases plays a critical role.44 When 0.5% EDT is applied to a device, an obvious enhancement was achieved in most of the parameters except VOC. After increasing the EDT weight scale over 5%, the remarkable drop was detected in PCE. For more detailed data on the other ratios that have been investigated see Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI.† So the optimized quantity of EDT is fixed at 0.5% mass ratio. The enhancement of FF is attributed to the reduced series resistance (Rs) and the increased shunt resistance (Rsh) in the device (Table 1). As displayed in Fig. 5b, the leakage current of the devices with ZnO@EDT ETLs is lower than that of bare ZnO, implying that the recombination of charge was decreased.40,45 Moreover, the IPCE spectra in Fig. 5c are in good agreement with the JSC values. Furthermore, ZnO and ZnO@EDT were also tested in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) system (Fig. S7 and Table S2, ESI†). The long-term stability of PSCs was also investigated (Fig. S8, ESI†). The ZnO@0.5% EDT device showed the best stability, which remained 96% in a N2 atmosphere after 2 weeks. This is much higher than the pristine ZnO which is maintained at 70% in the same atmosphere. It can be proved the EDT could markedly improve the stability of devices.

In order to study the effect of EDT doping on the performance enhancement, light absorption, and the exciton dissociation process of the solar cells, the saturation current density Jsat values of the device based on ZnO and ZnO@EDT were determined. Fig. 6a illustrates the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the internal voltage (Vint) spectra of the device under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively.46Vint is calculated from Vint = VBI − Vapp, where VBI is the built-in voltage, which refers to the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vapp is the applied voltage.47 As a result, Jph increases in proportion to the voltage at low Vint, but Jph reaches the maximum at high Vint (1 V and above) where the built-in field is large enough to sweep out all carriers to the electrodes. Therefore, the saturated photocurrent (Jph,sat) is limited only by the number of absorbed photons. Thus,Jph = qLGmaxwhere q is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the active layer, and Gmax is the maximum photoinduced carrier generation rate per unit volume.48 Consequently, the value of Gmax for the device with a pure ZnO layer is 3.00 × 1026 m−3 s−1, whereas that of Gmax for the cells based on the ZnO@0.5% EDT layer increased to 3.21 × 1026 m−3 s−1. The enhancement of Gmax implies that the absorption of light improved in the cell with ZnO@EDT ETLs.49 Simultaneously, the recombination mechanism of the devices was studied by measuring JSC and VOC at various light intensities. A power law dependence of JSC upon illumination intensity is generally observed in PSCs and can be defined asJSC ∝ Iαwhere I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor. The value of α is close to unity, which is the result of a weak bimolecular recombination during sweep-out. In Fig. 6b, the data are fitted to a power law from 23 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2. The values of α for the devices with pristine ZnO and the 0.5% EDT doped ZnO layer are 0.937 and 0.970, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination decreased in the device with ZnO@EDT. On the other hand, the dependence of VOC upon light intensity is determined using the following equation:50VOC ∝ nkT/qln(P)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, q is the elementary charge, and P is the light intensity. The value of n close to unity would indicate that bimolecular recombination dominates the recombination loss.51,52 As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the device with ZnO@0.5% EDT showed a value of 1.09kT/q, while that of the device with pure ZnO is 1.59kT/q. This result implies a reduced trap-assisted recombination in the ZnO@0.5% EDT device.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated an inverted polymer solar cell with an efficiency of 8.0% by employing 0.5% EDT doped ZnO as an electron transporting layer. Compared with bare ZnO, ZnO@EDT presents a more homogeneous surface with less defects, which resulted in increased electron mobility and facilitated the photoinduced carrier generation in the device. Meanwhile, the EDT doping decreased the work function of the ZnO layer to improve the extraction of electrons. The results clearly define a promising pathway to fabricate a homogeneous solution-processed ZnO transporting layer for solar cells with high efficiency.
Experimental
Preparation of ZnO precursor solution
0.1 g of zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98%, Aldrich] was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (1 mL) containing ethanolamine (28 μL) and stirred for 12 h at room temperature. 1,2-Ethanedithiol (EDT) was dissolved in ethanol and stirred for 4 h, then added to the ZnO precursor solution as the EDT doped ZnO precursor solution. The EDT doped ZnO solution also needs to be stirred for 12 h at atmospheric temperature. All chemicals were commercially available products and were used as received.
Fabrication of solar cells
In the inverted device fabrication process, ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with acetone, detergent, deionized water and isopropanol, and dried by nitrogen flow followed by plasma treatment for 15 minutes. The prepared ZnO, ZnO@0.1% EDT, ZnO@0.5% EDT and ZnO@5% EDT precursor solutions were spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrate at 4000 rpm, and then annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air. The active layers were spin-cast in a N2 filled glove box from the blend solution of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3% volume ratio). Finally, an anode transporting layer MoO3 (7 nm) and an anode Ag (90 nm) were deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation under vacuum (<10−7 Torr). The active device section was 4 mm2.
Characterization of solar cells
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar simulator Sun2000). Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values were measured under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with an Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and the calibration of the incident light was performed using a monocrystalline silicon diode. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. A Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorophotometer was utilized for the fluorescence measurement of photoluminescence (PL) of the ZnO and EDT doped ZnO samples. The excitation wavelength was 325 nm. The crystallinity of the samples was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer operating at 30 kV and 20 mA with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scanning rate of 1° min−1. UPS and XPS measurements were carried out using an AXIS-ULTRA DLD spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd) using He(I) (21.2 eV) as a monochromatic light source. Water contact angle measurements for all samples were taken on a JC2000A contact angle instrument. The surface morphologies of the pristine ZnO and ZnO@EDT layers were characterized using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Digital Instruments Nanoscope 31).
