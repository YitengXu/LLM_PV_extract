    , Accepted 25th October 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractReducing the voltage loss is considered a promising route to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two donor polymers PT4FB and PTT4FB based on a tetra-fluorinated benzene building block are synthesized and applied to non-fullerene OSC devices, which achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC). When PT4FB is combined with IDIC, the blend exhibits large fiber-like domains (size ∼39 nm) due to the excessive aggregation of PT4FB, which results in a relatively low short-circuit current (JSC) of 14.06 mA cm−2 and a moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.81%. To weaken the aggregation of PT4FB, we replace the alkyl chains on the polymer backbone with alkylthiophene side chains to afford a novel donor polymer PTT4FB with reduced packing and crystallinity. As a result, the PTT4FB:IDIC-based blend shows significantly smaller domain sizes (24 nm) than the PT4FB-based device, contributing to a remarkably increased JSC and an overall higher PCE of 10.60%. The synergistic effects of abundant fluorination and alkylthiophene side chains can be utilized as a general method to tune the morphological and energetic properties when designing novel donor polymers to achieve both high VOC and favorable morphology for efficient non-fullerene OSCs.
Introduction
OSCs, which are considered one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies, have drawn considerable academic and industrial attention over the past few decades due to their advantages such as light weight, mechanical flexibility and low-cost processing.1–9 Rational donor polymer design, device engineering, and morphology optimization led to PCEs over 11% for fullerene-based OSCs.10,11 However, fullerene acceptors suffer from weak absorption in the visible region, limited energy level tunability, and poor device stability.12–14 Furthermore, despite a few exceptions,15–18 fullerene-based OSCs typically exhibit large voltage losses, which are normally larger than 0.7 V.8,10 Therefore, the research focus has recently shifted to non-fullerene solar cells, particularly those based on small molecule acceptors (SMAs), which are promising alternatives to fullerenes due to their strong and extended absorption range, tunable energy levels and low-cost preparation.19–31 The advances in active material exploration have boosted the PCE of SMA-based OSCs to over 14%, which enhances the commercialization of OSC technologies.28,32,33 Notably, some studies demonstrate that the seemingly inevitable voltage losses can be significantly reduced in various non-fullerene OSC systems,15,34–37 indicating prospects of a higher realizable PCE for OSCs than that estimated in the past.
Compared to the largely shifted efforts towards the design of acceptors, development of p-type polymers has become slower than before. To fully utilize high-performance SMAs, polymers with compatible properties need to be judiciously designed with a goal to simultaneously enhance JSC, VOC and FF. To elevate JSC, a complementary absorption profile to the acceptor needs to be considered during the donor polymer design. Also, a high FF could be desirably achieved by forming a nanoscale morphology with reasonably small domain sizes and high domain purity. To achieve a higher VOC, one effective way is to down-shift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of donor polymers, and one of the most promising design strategies to achieve low-lying energy levels for donor polymers is fluorine substitution due to its strong electronegativity.37–44 Through rationally controlling the number of fluorine substitutions on each polymer repeating unit, the HOMO levels of donor polymers and thus the VOC of OSC devices could be readily tuned. For example, Takimiya and coworkers manipulated the electronic properties of donor polymers and thus the photovoltaic performance by introducing two or four fluorine atoms to the donor moiety of the polymers.45 Kim and coworkers synthesized a series of wide-bandgap donor polymers with different numbers of fluorine substitution (0–4F) to investigate their potential as donors for fullerene OSCs.46 Apparently, polymers with the highest substitution of fluorine atoms are favorable for achieving higher VOC in the resulting OSCs, but these OSC systems typically exhibit poor FFs due to the terrible active layer morphology, which is caused by the over-aggregation of the polymer backbone led by excessive fluorination. As a result, few attempts have been successful on constructing promising p-type polymers with tetra-fluorine substitution on the electron-donating moiety. Instead, a moderate amount of fluorination of the polymer backbone (normally two fluorine substitutions on each polymer donor moiety) is generally preferred to balance the trade-off between VOC and FF for achieving efficient OSCs.
Following these design strategies, we synthesized two new donor polymers PT4FB and PTT4FB in this work. The large bandgap polymer PT4FB was constructed by employing tetra-fluorobenzene as the donor unit and the difluorinated benzotriazole (ffTAZ) as the acceptor unit. The introduction of four fluorine atoms to the donor part of PT4FB brings several effects. First, PT4FB exhibits low-lying energy levels, which is in favor of a high VOC. Second, fluorine atoms are believed to offer noncovalent coulombic interactions with neighboring hydrogen or sulfur atoms, contributing to the strengthened packing and high crystallinity of PT4FB, evidenced by its distinctly visible (400) peaks from X-ray scattering experiments. When PT4FB is combined with a reported SMA named IDIC,21 the bulk-heterojunction device exhibits a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 14.06 mA cm−2, and a FF 0.72, yielding a PCE of 9.81%. Morphological studies reveal that the strong crystallinity of PT4FB leads to relatively large domain sizes of 39 nm in the blend. To reduce the domain sizes and further enhance the device performance, we intentionally replaced the alkyl side chains along the polymer backbone with alkylthiophene side chains, yielding a novel donor polymer PTT4FB. The alkylthiophene side chains introduce a more twisted backbone and a larger spacing of lamellar stacking to PTT4FB, which effectively reduce the aggregation of the polymer without significantly altering its optical and electrical properties. Consequently, when PTT4FB is combined with the same acceptor IDIC, the device exhibits a higher PCE of 10.60% with a similar VOC of 0.96 V, an elevated JSC of 16.52 mA cm−2, and a slightly decreased FF of 0.67. Morphology characterization reveals reduced domain purity (0.71 vs. 1) but notably decreased domain sizes (24 nm vs. 39 nm) for the PTT4FB:IDIC blend when compared to PT4FB:IDIC, resulting in a slightly decreased FF, but a largely enhanced JSC, and an overall higher performance for PTT4FB:IDIC-based solar cells. This clear structure–property–performance relationship demonstrates that we have successfully opened prospects for the design of donor polymers that could suppress the aggregation while judiciously altering the energetics to achieve a high VOC for efficient OSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthesis routes of two novel donor polymers are illustrated in Scheme 1. The Stille coupling of monomers 1 and 2 by thermal heating at 140 °C for one day yielded the donor polymer PT4FB. The key step for obtaining polymer PTT4FB is the synthesis of chemical 4, which was prepared according to a reported procedure by Wang and coworkers.47 The Stille coupling between compound 3 and 4 yielded compound 5, whose bromination with the help of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) yielded monomer 6. Finally, the polymer PTT4FB was prepared by the polymerization of monomers 2 and 6 via the Stille coupling reaction. Both two polymers could be well dissolved in common solvents, such as toluene and chlorobenzene. The number average molecular weight (Mn) for PT4FB and PTT4FB are 56.2 and 54.1 kDa, respectively, which ensures more accurate parallel comparison of their photovoltaic properties. It is believed that fluorine atoms on the benzene unit could form noncovalent interactions with the sulfur or hydrogen atoms on the neighboring thiophene units, contributing to enhanced polymer co-planarity and aggregation. However, the backbone of PTT4FB is distorted due to the intramolecular repulsion between two electronegative sulfur atoms on the alkylthiophene side chain and the thiophene along the polymer main chain. Besides, alkylthiophene side chains are longer than alkyl chains, which may contribute to a larger spacing for the lamellar stacking of PTT4FB. Therefore, owing to the alkylthiophene side chains on the polymer backbone, PTT4FB is expected to exhibit less ordered packing and lower crystallinity than PT4FB.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PT4FB and PTT4FB polymers. 
The chemical structures of the two polymers and the acceptor IDIC are shown in Fig. 1a with their film UV-vis absorption spectra and energy level diagrams shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. PT4FB and PTT4FB exhibit similar absorption in the 400–600 nm region. The absorption onsets for PT4FB and PTT4FB are 625 nm and 620 nm, respectively, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.98 eV for PT4FB and 2.00 eV for PTT4FB. The main absorption of IDIC (550–750 nm) is complementary to those of the two polymers, which provides the active layer with a broad spectrum coverage (400–750 nm) and is beneficial for achieving high photocurrent values. The HOMO levels of two polymers are determined from the oxidation potentials from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. S1†) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PT4FB and PTT4FB are calculated from their HOMO levels and optical bandgaps. PT4FB and PTT4FB exhibit similar energy levels, revealing that the introduction of the thiophene units to the side chains has little effect on the deep HOMO level of the donor polymer, which is favorable for achieving a higher VOC in the OSCs. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the acceptor IDIC shown in Fig. S1c† are measured to be −5.62 eV and −4.04 eV, respectively.

To analyze the stacking behavior of two polymers, the UV-vis absorption of PT4FB and PTT4FB in chlorobenzene solution was measured at different temperatures (Fig. S2†). During the cooling from 100 °C to room temperature, the absorption spectra of two polymers are red-shifted and a peak at around 570 nm gradually shows up and then reinforces as the temperature decreases, indicating strong π–π stacking propensity for two polymers enabled by fluorine substitution. This phenomenon is known as temperature-dependent aggregation, which is a property reported to be advantageous for morphology control and device processing.8,48 To better clarify the degree of molecular aggregation of these two polymers, a parameter called “relative aggregation strength” is introduced to compare the aggregation tendency of the two polymers during the cooling process.49,50 During the cooling process of two polymer solutions, the second absorption peak is enhanced gradually, which is mainly ascribed to the molecular aggregation of polymer chains. Therefore, a more accurate definition of the “relative aggregation strength” is given here: the ratio of the second peak to the first peak in the absorption curves of polymer solutions at one temperature. Despite the similar trend, Fig. S2c† clearly demonstrates the stronger aggregation tendency of PT4FB. It could be interpreted that our rational design strategy, replacing the alkyl side chains with the alkylthiophene chains, effectively reduces the molecular packing and aggregation, which is well in line with the aforementioned speculation.
To study the photovoltaic performance of two polymers, OSC devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/V2O5/Al. The blend solutions of the polymer and the small molecule dissolved in chlorobenzene were spincoated onto the ZnO-coated substrate at an optimized weight ratio of 1:1.5 for both combinations. The J–V and EQE curves of PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC-based devices are shown in Fig. 2 with their device parameters summarized in Table 1. The PT4FB:IDIC blend exhibits a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 14.06 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.72, leading to a PCE of 9.81%. In contrast, PTT4FB:IDIC exhibits a higher PCE of 10.60% with a similar VOC of 0.96 V, an elevated JSC of 16.52 mA cm−2, and a decreased FF of 0.67. The high VOC values of the two blends are consistent with the low-lying HOMO levels of two donor polymers enabled by fluorination. Despite that PTT4FB:IDIC exhibits a slightly reduced FF than PT4FB:IDIC, and the JSC of the PTT4FB:IDIC blend is significantly increased, contributing to the overall enhanced device performance of PTT4FB:IDIC-based solar cells. The EQE spectra of two blends show a positive photo-response over the range of 300–800 nm and the highest achievable EQE value is up to 74% for the PTT4FB:IDIC-based device. In particular, the high EQE in the range of 600–800 nm for two blends reveals highly efficient photon-to-electron conversion by the acceptor IDIC. It could be inferred that the small HOMO–HOMO energy offset between the donor and the acceptor (∼0.1 eV) is not detrimental to charge generation. The integrated photocurrent from the EQE curves of PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC devices are 13.54 and 16.21 mA cm−2, respectively, which are within 4% mismatch with the J–V measured values.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were employed to gain deep insights into the morphology difference between PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC blends. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding 1D profiles are shown in Fig. 3. For pure PT4FB and PTT4FB films, higher order scattering peaks of even (400) are clearly visible in the out-of-plane direction, revealing an overall strong crystallization propensity of two polymers. However, a difference can be noticed when two polymers are compared. For example, the (h00) intensity of PTT4FB is weaker than that of PT4FB and the spacing of lamellar stacking for PTT4FB is larger than that of PT4FB (26.18 Å vs. 25.13 Å), indicating weaker intermolecular packing of PTT4FB in the (h00) direction. Additionally, the out-of-plane (010) and (100) coherence lengths of pure PTT4FB (35.70 Å and 115.64 Å) are smaller than those of PT4FB (40.22 Å and 169.82 Å). This shows that our design strategy of replacing the alkyl side chains with alkylthiophene chains on the polymer backbone effectively weakens the aggregation of polymers, which is consistent with the mobility of two pure polymers measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S3a†): a higher hole mobility for PT4FB (1.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) than that for PTT4FB (1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1). In neat films, although the lamellar packing occurs mostly in the out-of-plane direction, the π–π stacking for both polymers is a mixture of both “face-on” and “edge-on” orientations. However, when two polymers are combined with IDIC, both blend films show the dominant “face-on” orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport and collection in the OSC devices. Both polymers maintain their relatively strong crystallinity in the blends as shown in Fig. 3, yet PT4FB is more crystalline than PTT4FB, leading to the slightly increased FF of the PT4FB-based devices, which is further supported by the mobilities of two polymer-based blends. From SCLC measurements, the hole and electron mobilities of PT4FB:IDIC are 7.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 6.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, and PTT4FB:IDIC are 5.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 5.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively (Fig. S3b and c†). The lower crystallinity of PTT4FB leads to lower charge mobilities and partially explains the lower FF in the corresponding OSCs.

To provide more insights into the performance variation between PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC blends, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to characterize the surface morphology of two blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a, PT4FB:IDIC exhibits excessive aggregation and tends to form large fiber-like domains. Moreover, some large crystallites with a size of ∼50 nm are clearly visible in the PT4FB:IDIC blend. After the rational optimization of the donor polymer, the PTT4FB:IDIC film demonstrates much smaller domain sizes, which is attributed to the reduced aggregation of the donor polymer and more interpenetrated network formed by PTT4FB and IDIC. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) experiments were utilized to further analyze the morphology with the results shown in Fig. 4b. A peak at 0.081 nm−1 was observed for the PT4FB:IDIC blend, which corresponds to the domain sizes of ∼39 nm assuming a two-phase separated morphology. In contrast, the PTT4FB:IDIC film exhibits much smaller domain sizes of 24 nm, which is nearly the optimal length scale for exciton diffusion and charge generation. However, PTT4FB:IDIC exhibits lower domain purity than PT4FB:IDIC (0.71 vs. 1), mostly likely arising from the interpenetration of donor and acceptor materials. The lower domain purity of PTT4FB:IDIC results in a slightly decreased FF for the device, yet the reasonably small domain sizes enable a significantly higher JSC for the PTT4FB-based OSCs. As a result, PTT4FB:IDIC-based OSCs achieve an overall higher PCE value, validating that our design strategy is promising to optimize the morphology of excessively aggregated polymers to achieve highly efficient OSCs.

Furthermore, current against light intensity measurements were carried out to analyze the bimolecular recombination properties in PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC blends. The ideal relationship between current and light intensity can be expressed by the equation JSC ∝ Pα, where P represents the light intensity and α is the recombination index. Theoretically, α should equal to 1 if all the extracted free charges within the solar cell device are connected by two electrodes.51 However, the existence of bimolecular recombination in the device generally leads to certain deviation of α from 1: a stronger bimolecular recombination corresponds to a smaller α. As shown in Fig. 4c, the α for the PTT4FB:IDIC device is 0.9516, which is larger than that for the PT4FB:IDIC blend (0.9103), revealing suppressed bimolecular recombination in the PTT4FB:IDIC blend.
To further understand the molecular interpenetration between the donor polymers and IDIC, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to analyze the thermodynamic properties of PT4FB and PTT4FB-based systems. The corresponding DSC thermograms of two neat polymers and polymer-based blends are shown in Fig. 5. The pure polymer PT4FB exhibits a high melting point (T0m) of 293.38 °C with a melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of 21.44 J g−1. After PT4FB was blended with IDIC, the melting point was decreased to 285.34 °C. Similarly, the high melting point of pure PTT4FB (319.24 °C) was reduced to 285.56 °C after it was combined with IDIC. The melting point depression from the pure to the blend systems could be utilized to quantify the degree of molecular miscibility between the polymer and the small molecule by calculating the molecular interaction parameter (χ) from the Flory–Huggins approximation (more details are shown in the ESI†).42,52,53 In short, a smaller χ means a higher degree of molecular miscibility, which is typically accompanied by lower domain purity as the R-SoXS experiments revealed. The χ values are calculated to be 1.45 and 0.81 for PT4FB:IDIC and PTT4FB:IDIC blends, respectively. Therefore, the PTT4FB:IDIC blend exhibits a better molecular intermixing between the donor and the acceptor, which contributes to its smaller domain sizes and lower domain purity. These results are another piece of evidence to explain the higher JSC but the decreased FF in the PTT4FB:IDIC-based OSCs after the donor polymer modification.

Conclusions
In summary, a combined effort of ample fluorination and alkylthiophene side chains led to novel conjugated donor polymers for efficient non-fullerene solar cells. Specifically, a large bandgap donor polymer of abundant fluorination PT4FB is synthesized, which achieves high VOC in non-fullerene OSCs, but the blend shows a less-optimized morphology because PT4FB tends to over-aggregate and forms large fiber-like domains (39 nm domain sizes). As a result, we intentionally replace the alkyl chains with alkylthiophene side chains on the polymer backbone to weaken the molecular stacking of PT4FB, yielding a novel donor polymer PTT4FB. Due to the decrease of polymer aggregation, the domain sizes of the PTT4FB:IDIC blend are effectively reduced to 24 nm, a more suitable size for efficient charge generation in photovoltaic devices. As a result, the PTT4FB:IDIC-based cell achieves a PCE of 10.60% with a high VOC of 0.96 V, a significantly enhanced JSC of 16.53 mA cm−2, and a slightly decreased FF of 0.67, compared to the PT4FB:IDIC-based device (PCE = 9.81%). Overall, our design strategy provides a novel and promising approach to realize both high VOC and favorable morphology for achieving highly efficient non-fullerene OSCs.
