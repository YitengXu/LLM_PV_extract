    , Accepted 17th April 2012First published on 15th May 2012AbstractThe unique electronic properties of graphene, a one atom thick carbon layer, were reported by scientists in 2004. Since this time graphene has subsequently been found to display several more unique and fascinating electrical, optical and mechanical properties. One particular area in which graphene has reportedly made an impact is in the field of electrochemistry, such as in providing enhancements in energy storage/generation and electrochemical sensing applications. Since 2005, when graphene was shown to be fabricated by the so-called ‘Scotch tape technique’ where multiple layers of graphene are peeled from a slab of Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite using adhesive tape and transferred onto an appropriate substrate, other fabrication methodologies of graphene have emerged. In the majority of cases, graphene is produced and supplied in solution, such that graphene has to be immobilised onto the desired surface. A fabrication process where graphene is grown upon a substrate and is ready for implementation is the Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of graphene. In this perspective article we overview recent developments in the fabrication of CVD graphene and explore its utilisation in electrochemistry, considering its fundamental understanding through to applications in sensing and energy related devices.

1. Introduction
The term ‘graphene’ refers to a planar monolayer sheet of sp2 bonded carbon atoms that are densely packaged into a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice;1–3 a conceptual model is depicted in Fig. 1. In theory, as an integral part of various three-dimensional materials, graphene has been studied since the 1940s,2,4 however it was not until the recent work of Novoselov et al.5,6 and Zhang et al.7 that interest in graphene escalated due to reports of its unique properties. One of the key achievements of Novoselov et al.6 was a simple, yet time consuming methodology in which graphene could be obtained using the so-called “Scotch tape method” where commercially available adhesive (Scotch) tape is used to peel multiple layers from a slab of Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) which is then transferred by pressing the tape onto the desired substrate. Other methods have since been reported for the fabrication of graphene.8–16

It is interesting that the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene”.17 Many papers incorrectly cite the 2004 paper by Novoselov and Geim as the paper that presented the ‘Scotch tape method’ to the world. In fact, as pointed out by de Heer,18 Geim and Novoselov developed a very simple methodology (Scotch tape approach) in which to produce and observe microscopic graphene on silicon wafers, which was copied globally as a protocol to produce graphene samples for two-dimensional transport studies.18 However, this method by Novoselov et al. was not reported in 20045 but in 2005.6 In fact graphene had been identified and characterised as a two-dimensional-crystalline material in many reports prior to 2004 (see for example ref. 4 for a review).18,19 Dreyer and co-workers20 have elegantly produced a detailed account of the synthesis and characterisation of graphene; Fig. 2 shows a timeline representing the history of the preparation, isolation and characterisation of graphene as given in ref. 20. Of note is that H.-P. Boehm, who coined the name graphene in 1962,21–24 reported his observations of graphene and demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt the existence of freestanding graphene.21–24 Dreyer and co-workers pointed out that in the 1962 report, Boehm et al. isolated reduced graphene oxide with heteroatomic contamination rather than pristine graphene25 and interestingly the electrical conductance is significantly lower for this material than for graphene prepared by the ‘Scotch tape method’.23,25–27

Graphene has been shown to exhibit a unique array of physical and chemical properties:2,3,28–31 a large surface area, strong mechanical strength and excellent thermal and electrical conductivities. Note that within this review we focus solely upon the electrochemical properties and applications of graphene – for further information on the various other chemical and physical properties of graphene please refer to the following reviews: ref. 2, 3 and 32. It is the exceptional physicochemical properties that graphene has to offer that have consequently resulted in this new, novel and exciting material being subjected to an immense level of research interest, where global efforts to investigate and utilise its fundamental properties are truly underway and graphene holds great promise for future advances within many scientific fields where it has already been utilised to enhance a large number of specific technological applications.2,28,29
One area that is of particular interest to graphene research is electrochemistry.3 Carbon based electrode materials have long been utilised within electrochemistry, they have out-performed the traditional noble metals in many significant areas and are at the forefront of innovation within this field.33 This diverse and sustained success is due to carbons structural polymorphism, chemical stability, low cost, wide potential windows, relative inert electrochemistry, rich surface chemistry and electro-catalytic activities for a variety of redox reactions.3,33 Given the historic dominance of carbon materials within electrochemistry a significant degree of effort is being invested into the exploration and exploitation of graphene's fundamental electrochemical properties, the understanding and manipulation of which have the potential to result in the greatly improved performance of future electrochemical sensing and energy related devices.34–37
1.1. The synthesis of graphene
There are a large number of fabrication routes that exist for graphene; these include dry mechanical or chemical exfoliation, unrolling/unzipping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (through a variety of ways such as electrochemical, chemical or physical methods), chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or epitaxial growth, arc discharge, the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and many other organic synthetic methods.3,32,37–42 However, there are at present no single methodologies that produce graphene sheets that are suitable for all potential applications and thus each method has innate advantages and disadvantages in terms of the resultant quality, quantity and electrochemical applicability of the graphene produced.3,29,43Table 1 gives a direct comparison of selected graphene fabrication methodologies with their inherent advantages and disadvantages. For example, dry mechanical exfoliation methods involve cleaving a sample of graphite (usually HOPG) with cellophane-based adhesive tape.5 This method is ideally suited for the investigation of graphene's physical properties given that it allows the low cost isolation of single graphene sheets that are of high quality,5,38 however, disadvantages including poor reproducibility, low-yield and the labour intensive processes required result in it being difficult to scale this process for mass production and have thus led to this method being used predominantly only for fundamental studies.38 Furthermore, possible contamination of the graphene samples from the adhesive tape utilised renders this method less appealing for electrochemical investigation.

35, 57 and 58





An alternative preparative method that is commonly utilised owing to the ease of production, high yield and low cost is the chemical exfoliation of graphite, this includes applying ultrasound in both solution and intercalation steps.38 For example, one ultrasonication route entails the use of a water–surfactant solution, sodium cholate,44 which forms stable encapsulation layers on each side of the graphene sheets; graphite flakes are dispersed in the aqueous surfactant solution and transformed into monolayer graphene by the application of ultrasound.44,45 This is also possible without additives in many organic solvents that have an affinity for graphite where ultrasonic agitation is used to supply the energy to cleave the graphene precursor.11 The success of ultrasonic cleavage depends on the correct choice of solvents and surfactants as well as relevant ultrasound parameters such as sonication frequency, amplitude and time.37,46 Note however, that as with mechanical exfoliation, the quality of the obtained graphene is not always sufficient and additionally homogeneity of the number of graphene layers is often poor,38 thus graphitic impurities may potentially remain. Furthermore, note that the material produced often contains remains of the exfoliating agents, where in the case of the surfactant, sodium cholate, previous studies have shown that this surfactant can dominate the electrochemical properties and performance of the stabilised graphene, such that highly negative effects on the interpretation of data were observed.47–49
Furthermore, graphene is often synthesised through the reduction of GO.3,38 GO is produced via graphite oxide which can be fabricated via various different routes, the Hummers method for example involves soaking graphite in a solution of sulphuric acid and potassium permanganate.38,50 Stirring or sonication of the graphite oxide is then performed to obtain single layers of GO given that the functional groups upon GO render it hydrophilic, allowing it to be dispersed in water based solutions. Finally, GO can either be chemically, thermally or electrochemically reduced to yield graphene.23,38,51,52 This method has the advantages of being scalable, rapid and cost effective in addition to the beneficial handling versatility of the liquid suspension.29 However, reduction to graphene is often only partial and additional interferences may arise from the presence of reducing agents.
Note that as is the case for the majority of instances where graphene solutions are utilised, deposition of the solution upon a required surface or substrate may lead to uncertainty in terms of the quality of the graphene remaining, this is because deposition may lead to the re-formation of stacked graphene layers (viz. graphitic impurities) and as a consequence in these instances post-application characterisation of the graphene is required for clarity.29
Given the insights gained above, it is clear that preparative methods of graphene are currently a heavily researched and important issue. The search for a method that can reproducibly synthesise high quality monolayer graphene that has a large surface area and is prevalent in large production volumes is greatly sought after. Additionally, it is evident from the distinct advantages and disadvantages of the various fabrication routes covered thus far that it is the fabrication method itself that defines the quality and resultant properties of the graphene utilised and therefore graphene sheets fabricated via differing methodologies will no doubt possess and exhibit distinct properties. In these cases, the graphene is usually dispersed into a solvent which is then cast onto a suitable surface, where following evaporation the graphene left immobilised can then be used experimentally. This process, while facile, has inherent disadvantages such as surface instability, deviation from true single layer graphene and scalability for instance, yet it is an effective way to explore the properties of graphene. One interesting fabrication approach is the CVD of graphene, where graphene is grown on a metallic surface and through careful control of the experimental conditions, one can envisage large graphene surfaces which are of high quality and defect free single layered graphene with bespoke sizes, controllable orientation and no contaminants.
In this perspective article we explore the electrochemistry of graphene grown via CVD. Despite the immense interest that graphene receives, its fundamental electrochemical properties are yet to be fully understood and are thus still emerging and evolving, as are its potential applications. With this and the above insights in mind, we selectively focus upon the utilisation of CVD graphene. We first overview the inherent advantages and disadvantages of CVD fabrication methodologies, we then explore the fundamental electrochemical properties of CVD graphene before finally presenting an overview of the utilisation of CVD graphene in both electrochemical sensing and energy related applications.
2. CVD growth of graphene
Graphene synthesis via CVD appears to be ideally suited for applications within electrochemistry with regards to the prevalence of copious manufacturing volumes, large surface area, uniform graphene sheets which can be transferred to other substrates for investigation and have been reported to exhibit ‘outstanding’ electrical conductivity.53–55 CVD is a well established technique and has been widely utilised to synthesise carbon based nano-structures such as CNTs.38,56 The underlying principle of CVD is to decompose a carbon feedstock with the help of heat in order to provide a source of carbon which can then rearrange to form sp2 carbon species, accomplished over a catalyst;38 for the growth of graphene, hydrocarbon gases are generally utilised as precursors and the most successful catalysts thus far are transition metal surfaces (namely nickel and copper).57,58 Note that varying the CVD protocol utilised greatly affects the resultant quality of the graphene fabricated; Table 2 depicts a select few examples of where variable reaction conditions have been utilised and details the resultant graphene quality.

In early attempts to utilise this method, graphene was synthesised using a variety of transition metals, including iridium and ruthenium.16,59,60 However, it was not until few-layer growth of graphene was achieved upon nickel that major improvements were obtained in terms of device and application purposes, which allowed both large-area growth and the isolation of graphene from the supporting metal.59 Unfortunately, graphene growth upon nickel is often characterised by regions with large numbers of layers (see later for the electrochemical implications of this), additionally small grain sizes and its high carbon solubility limit the size and quality of the graphene sheets forming over a nickel surface.53,61 In later work concerning nickel, progress was made towards the production of graphene with fewer and more uniform layers (lateral grain sizes of up to 20 μm have been reported and layers of ∼1 to 12),61 which was accomplished via annealing the nickel substrate to create larger grain sizes or alternatively optimisation of the nickel film thickness to increase the size and quality of graphene sheet formation (altering the nickel film thickness allowed moderate control of the amount of carbon absorbed in the nickel foils over which the graphene/graphite crystals form upon precipitation).38,53,61 However, the application of CVD graphene films grown utilising nickel has remaining inherent limitations in terms of its high polycrystalline surface, small grain size (thus a large number of grain boundaries, known to create surface defects in terms of disordered, out-of-plane extrusions and multi-layered graphite ridges)62 and its high solubility of carbon which results in the production of uncontrollable single-, few- and multi-layered graphene regions.
Copper on the other hand has since been shown to be promising for producing large area graphene synthesised via CVD.38,58 Unlike nickel, copper has a very low carbon solubility and large grain size formation after annealing which enables the growth of graphene sheets over large areas.38 In contrast to the CVD growth of graphene upon nickel, which occurs via a carbon segregation–precipitation process,58 growth on copper is through a surface adsorption process which allows greater control over the formation of single layer graphene viz. a self-limiting process,58,63 where owing to coppers low carbon solubility CVD growth is a surface confined process and once the surface is fully covered with monolayer graphene its growth terminates because of the absence of a catalyst (required to decompose the hydrocarbon precursor). Conversely nickel's high carbon solubility and resultant segregation–precipitation mechanism results in additional carbon atoms being dissolved and hence it is difficult to get uniform single layered graphene films due to precipitation of additional carbon upon the surface during this step;58 control of the metal-film thickness can aid in the acquirement of single layer graphene, however because of micro-structural defects, predominantly grain boundaries, it is very difficult to fully eliminate the effect of precipitation for metals with high carbon solubility.58
Recently, great improvements in terms of the growth of large area single layered graphene have been achieved via CVD, utilising copper and beneficially exploiting its low carbon solubility. Inspired by the limited-small-sized graphene available through the exfoliation of graphite, Li et al.63 grew large-area graphene films (of the order of centimetres) on copper substrates by CVD using methane. The films were predominantly single-layer graphene and were reported to be continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries, with a small percentage (less than 5%) of the area being few-layer graphene.63 In other elegant work the CVD synthesis of graphene on copper was explored with regards to the utilisation and comparison of methanol, ethanol and propanol as precursors.64 The authors systematically investigated the quality of the synthesised graphene under various growth conditions where large area (3 × 3 cm2), high quality graphene was reported in the case of each precursor utilised:64 alcohol vapour exposure times of 5 minutes and an average growth temperature of 850 °C yielded continuous graphene monolayer films (as inferred from Raman spectroscopy) and it was reported that the oxygen moieties found in the source molecules had no measurable doping or oxidation effect on the synthesised graphene. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) acquired images of the fabricated graphene are depicted in Fig. 3 along with Raman spectra and insight regarding the apparent morphology of the graphene film. In further notable and rather groundbreaking work, single graphene crystals with dimensions of up to 0.5 mm were grown by low-pressure CVD in copper-foil enclosures using methane as a precursor.65 Low-energy electron microscopy analysis showed that the large graphene domains had a single crystallographic orientation, with an occasional domain having two orientations.65 The authors reported that Raman spectroscopy revealed individual graphene crystals to be uniform monolayers with a low D-band intensity.65 SEM images of the fabricated graphene are presented in Fig. 4 – this work was the first to report the growth of large-domain or large-grain-size single crystals.65

The small D peak (∼1350 cm−1) and the intensity of the 2D peak (∼2700 cm−1), found to be more than twice as high as the G peak (∼1580 cm−1), indicate the presence of high quality monolayer graphene.

Although some of the most exciting and promising reports on the CVD fabrication of graphene are highlighted above, bear in mind that recent studies of graphene produced by CVD on copper have shown that the majority of graphene produced is polycrystalline in nature66 (in addition to on nickel, see earlier) and that its mechanical strength is weakened at its grain boundaries with additional altered electronic properties.67,68 Furthermore, grain boundaries are the origin of surface defects in graphene (graphitic impurities, where a surface defect results in extended growth which forms graphitic/thick graphene or alternatively results in disordered and protruded growth which increases the accessibility of edge plane sites owing to favourable orientation)69 and thus in an electrochemical sense the degree of defect coverage will strongly influence the electrochemical properties of the graphene film (see later). Thus future work in this field should focus upon the use of single crystal substrates for graphene growth; this may open ways for uniform high-quality graphene over large areas that are reproducible and scalable – already (as highlighted above) work is underway using slightly modified growth methods to produce graphene with much larger grain sizes,65 many more reports are expected to emerge building upon this in the very near future. Currently however, in terms of the percentage area of single layer coverage of graphene, the average content of mixed mono- and bi-layer graphene coverage of 87% is usually reported for nickel (that is polycrystalline nickel, where in contrast to utilisation of the single crystal nickel(111) the area percentage of mono-layer/bi-layer graphene is 91%),59,69 while for copper foils an average of 95% of surfaces were covered by mono-layer graphene when grown via CVD, which appears excellent and ideally suited for electrochemical applications.
A key limitation that is present within many of the various fabrication routes for graphene is the difficult manipulation/handling of the graphene sample itself, for example where graphene is present in solution (such is the case for the majority of methods) control of graphene deposition upon a desired surface is limited with regards to the control of any specific position or alignment and in terms of the natural formation of graphite once the solvent is removed. It is here that CVD fabricated graphene has numerous advantages (even over mechanically exfoliated graphene) and comes into its own with regards to the handling and manipulation of large area, high quality uniform graphene sheets.
For the mass production of graphene there must be viable routes to large scale graphene application, where transfer of graphene after its growth from metallic substrates to more useful, insulating substrates is often necessary.59 It is not currently possible to use CVD to grow graphene upon such substrates (plastic, silicon dioxide, glass and so on) for practical applications due to the high temperatures required, which would damage the substrate and the graphene. Recently, chemical methods have been developed to separate the graphene film from the metal surface and transfer it to the required substrate. However, transferring graphene to these substrates is not so straight forward and damage to the graphene layer(s)/film(s) can occur. In the area of electrochemistry, the underlying metal may cause interferences70 and thus the transfer of graphene onto a suitable substrate is desirable: note that apart from epitaxial growth on SiC, there are very few other routes directly forming graphene on the surface of a dielectric and thus immense research efforts have been focused upon developing a method to easily manipulate the positioning of CVD graphene.38 The transfer of graphene from copper follows earlier procedures developed for the transfer of graphene from nickel.53,59 Typically, following the growth of graphene upon the copper catalyst the graphene is usually coated with a thin polymer layer such as polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA)63 or thermal release tape71 to maintain mechanical stability during the transfer.59 Following this the copper is removed by etching (with a chemical such as ferric chloride) – note that ferric chloride has been observed to contaminate the surface of graphene with iron72 which is problematic for some applications and most probably within electrochemical applications.59 Following the dissolution of copper the graphene is rinsed in water and brought into contact with the final substrate before the support layer is removed to leave single layer graphene on an arbitrary surface (PMMA is usually removed using acetone, methylene chloride or thermal decomposition).59,73–75
Many of the studies reported above incorporated transfer of the final graphene film onto more appropriate surfaces before being utilised, see for example ref. 63 and 64. In one example Li et al.55 aimed to improve the standard transfer process as stated above due to the occurrence of ‘bad’ transfers in which cracks and tears occur in the graphene sheet due to the intrinsic mechanical properties of monolayer graphene and the method of transfer initially used. The authors found that the addition of a second PMMA coating step after the graphene was placed upon the target substrate allowed the graphene sheet to obtain improved contact with the target substrate and thus a graphene film with a much lower density of cracks or tears was obtained.55 Further elegant work has been conducted by Bae and co-workers in which the authors reported the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films (grown by chemical vapour deposition onto copper substrates), where further layer-by-layer stacking was used to fabricate a doped four-layer graphene film.71 Finally, key research has been performed by Wang et al.76 towards the recyclable use of a copper catalyst for the CVD growth of graphene. The authors noted that the separation of CVD graphene from the metallic catalyst that it is grown on, followed by a subsequent transfer to a dielectric substrate, is currently the adopted method for device fabrication where most transfer techniques use a chemical etching method to dissolve the metal catalysts – thus imposing high material cost in large-scale fabrication.76 With this in mind the authors demonstrate a highly efficient, non-destructive electrochemical route for the delamination of CVD graphene films from metal surfaces.76 The electrochemically delaminated graphene films were continuous over 95% of the surface and were reported to exhibit increasingly enhanced electronic quality after several growth cycles on the reused copper catalyst, inferred by the authors to be due to the suppression of quasi-periodical nanoripples induced by copper step edges which would in turn cause surface defects upon the graphene film.76 Their electrochemical delamination process has the advantages of high efficiency, low-cost recyclability and the minimal use of etching chemicals which could contaminate the fabricated graphene and thus appears ideally suited for electrochemical applications. Note also that an alternative direct (polymer-free) transfer of large area graphene from metal substrates has been reported, the method avoids several wet chemical steps (and thus possible contamination of the sample).77
Having overviewed the synthesis of graphene via CVD it is suspected that further work on the CVD growth of graphene utilising copper will yield graphene with fewer bi-layer regions and larger grain sizes. CVD brings great promise for the commercial production (cheap, fast, straightforward and scalable process) of large-area high-quality uniform mono-layer graphene films that are readily transferable and have the possibility of being made bespoke when required in terms of controllable defect density (nickel vs. copper), the presence of specific functionalities (oxygenated species), grain orientation/size and the incorporation of impurities (dopants) to specifically tailor ones needs. For example, in a recent attempt to modify the properties of the graphene films produced, Suzuki and Hibino78 incorporated precursors containing both nitrogen and boron (although this procedure is not limited to these two dopants) into the fabrication method – also improvements need to be made in terms of fewer bi-layer regions and being able to control defect regions (see later). However, at the current time vast improvements are still required in the fabrication and transfer of CVD graphene films.
3. Electrochemical properties and utilisation of CVD graphene
3.1. Fundamentals
The choice of electrode material utilised for a specific application within electrochemistry is usually dictated by the electrode materials suitability for observing or acquiring the desired electrochemical parameter.33 In addition to physical and chemical properties,3,33 there is a wide variety of electrochemical properties and parameters, many specific to carbon, that affect the resultant electrochemical behaviour and applicability of such materials, for example heterogeneous electron transfer rates, surface coverage, surface state (the presence or absence of various moieties), redox potentials and the accessible electrochemical potential window.33,34 Therefore, prior to the potential application of a new electrode material within electrochemistry, basic electrochemical properties and behaviours should first be studied to determine the respective suitability for specific applications.34
The accessible electrochemical potential window of a prospective electrode material is an important parameter that defines the electrical energy range of anodic or cathodic reactions that can be carried out before electrolysis of the electrolyte occurs.34,79 Lim et al.79 have shown that anodised CVD epitaxial graphene (EG) exhibits a wide electrochemical potential window of ∼2.5 V in 1 M KCl, which was shown to be much larger than that of a glassy carbon (GC) and is comparable to that of a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode (which is widely recognised for its wide electrochemical potential window).79,80 Therefore graphene possesses a very useful attribute for the development of voltammetric sensors where the oxidation (or reduction) of analytes occurs at high anodic (or cathodic) potentials.34,79
To aid in the comparison of electron transfer reactivity at various carbon electrodes, simple outer-sphere redox systems that are insensitive to most surface defects or impurities are widely utilised and serve as useful benchmarks.33 Recently, Li et al.54 studied the electrochemical behaviour of individual monolayer CVD graphene sheets, the authors reported (via cyclic voltammetric measurements) that standard heterogeneous electron transfer rates, k0, of ferrocenemethanol (a simple redox molecule, one-electron outer-sphere process) at the CVD fabricated graphene electrode (k0 = 0.042 cm s−1) are more than 10-fold faster than at the basal plane of bulk graphite.54 The enhanced k0 value was attributed by the authors to likely be related to the observations that graphene has dramatically enhanced chemical reactivity when compared to the basal plane of bulk graphite,54,81 an enhancement that is generally believed to be a consequence of intrinsic corrugations in the graphene sheets that are not present in the atomically flat surfaces of bulk graphite.54,81
Note however that the improved electron transfer rates observed above at a CVD graphene electrode are rather surprising; they contradict what is expected given the fundamental knowledge of electron transfer at graphitic materials.82–84 It has been established and is well known that for HOPG the origin of electron transfer is from the edge plane like-sites/defects which have been shown to exhibit anomalously fast electron transfer rates over that of the basal plane like-sites/defects, which are in comparison relatively (electrochemically) inert.82–84 This view has recently been extended to graphene, which is anisotropic with respect to electron transfer and it has been demonstrated that the origin of electron transfer resides in its peripheral edge, as opposed to its side,85 where the former acts electrochemically akin to that of edge plane- (fast electron transfer) and the latter to that of basal plane- (slow electron transfer) like-sites/defects of HOPG. Fig. 1 indicates the respective edge and basal plane electron transfer sites for graphene. Bearing in mind the geometric structure of graphene, we have recently shown (via electrochemical analysis and density functional theory) that in terms of electrode kinetics graphene does in fact have a high electron density around its edge as opposed to its centre,86 where owing to its low portion of edge surface area (see ref. 86 and 87 for example) the pristine graphene sample studied resultantly exhibited slow heterogeneous electron transfer rates,86 particularly when contrasted to graphite.86,88 However, it was also highlighted that the coverage and orientation of graphene immobilised upon a supporting electrode substrate are highly important and need careful consideration.86
Moreover, Lim et al.79 have recently investigated the effect of edge plane defects on the heterogeneous charge transfer kinetics and capacitive noise at the basal plane of CVD EG (using inner-sphere and outer-sphere redox mediators). The authors demonstrated that the basal plane of CVD EG exhibits low heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, interestingly however, when electrochemically anodised (increasing the degree of oxygen-related edge plane defects) they found that the defects created on its surface result in the observation of superior electron transfer rates that surpass those observed for pristine graphene, GC and BDD electrodes.79Fig. 5A shows that, through analysis of the peak separation, there is indeed a direct correlation between the electron transfer kinetics of the Fe(CN)63−/4− couple and the defect density on CVD EG.79 The authors inferred that the presence of defects (such as kinks, steps or vacancies) on the basal planes of CVD EG can produce localised edge plane states, resulting in an increased electrochemical reactivity – which explains the observation that the sample with the highest defect density displayed the fastest electron transfer kinetics.79 Lim and co-authors also noted, as is evident in Fig. 5B, that graphene samples with the highest defect density displayed higher background capacitive currents associated with a non-Faradaic process, where it was believed that the presence of ionisable hydroxyl and carboxylic functionalities contributes to an increase in the capacitive charging current.79

The observations outlined above indicate that CVD graphene has enormous potential to be utilised as a beneficial electrode material. For example, where improved performance in specific sensing applications is dependent upon fast heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, modified graphene can theoretically react much faster than its counterparts, for instance GC or the basal plane of bulk graphite.54,79 However, note that the CVD graphene electrodes utilised in the above studies were fabricated ‘in-house’, which limits the quality of characterisation available and the worldwide repetition and comparison of such work which in turn makes it difficult for a unified picture and understanding of graphene's electrochemical properties to be established. If the knowledge of the fundamental electrochemical properties of CVD graphene electrodes is to develop further, standardisation must occur in terms of the fabrication and accessibility of well characterised commercially available CVD graphene, utilisation of which would allow the worldwide repetition of respective studies.
With this in mind we have previously explored and electrochemically characterised a commercially available CVD grown graphene electrode with the aim of studying electron transfer.70 The electrochemical properties of the CVD graphene were characterised with regards to the ‘outer-sphere’ redox probe,89 hexaammine-ruthenium(III) chloride, where via cyclic voltammetric analysis a well defined pair of redox peaks were evident and a k0 was found to correspond to 2.51 × 10−3 cm s−1. This is in good agreement with the limited CVD graphene literature (see above)54 and would indicate reasonably fast electron transfer at CVD graphene, which is notably contradictory to what is expected given the current ‘wisdom’ (see above).86 However, rather than consisting of a continuous single layered graphene film, analysis of Raman spectra showed that while certain areas upon the electrode surface were consistent with graphene, in other areas the spectra indicated the presence of multi-layered graphene.70 It was thus inferred that the CVD graphene surface consisted of few- and multi-layered sections of graphene, viz. effective graphitic islands, which were randomly distributed across the working surface; a schematic representation is shown in Fig. 6, in essence the CVD graphene mimics the response of a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode, in such cases the electro-active sites likely reside where deviation from true graphene exists and at graphene grain boundaries and folded edges.70 These insights were confirmed via cyclic voltammetric analysis of the commercially available CVD graphene where differing electrochemical responses were observed when utilising differing redox probes, viz. outer- and inner-sphere redox probes.70 In terms of the former, outer-sphere electron transfer probe, macro-electrode behaviour was evident where a peak shaped voltammetric response was observed due to the probe being surface insensitive and thus the edge of the graphene and graphitic islands act as a source (or sink) of electrons where all of these sites are electrochemically active and thus exhibit heavily overlapping diffusional layers which are planar in nature and give rise to a clear reversible/quasi-reversible peak shaped response.70 Conversely, in terms of the latter, inner-sphere electron transfer probe, micro-electrode behaviour was evident where a steady-state voltammetric profile was observed given that the probe was surface sensitive and as such electron transfer kinetics were greatly influenced by an electro-catalytic interaction with surface oxygenated species, thus given that only certain parts of the graphitic islands were ‘activated’ by the presence of beneficial surface groups overlap of the diffusion zones does not occur which gives rise to a steady-state voltammetric response.70 A schematic representation of the differing diffusion patterns and the resultant voltammetric responses are shown in Fig. 7 which are highly illuminating.

The above work demonstrates proof-of-concept that commercially available CVD grown graphene is not a continuous layer of graphene, but rather is heterogeneous in nature and has few- and multi-layered graphitic domains which dominated the observed electrochemical response, inferred due to graphene's relative (electrochemical) inactivity in comparison to these graphitic regions;70 note that this was further explored towards biologically prevalent molecules, namely L-ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine hydrochloride (DA), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), uric acid (UA) and epinephrine (EP), where again these graphitic islands were shown to dominate the observed electrochemical response and give rise to favourable electron transfer kinetics that are not representative of ‘true’ graphene.90 Last, another scenario can be envisaged where the graphene, assumed to be a continuous film, is in fact itself made up of discrete islands, such that the underlying metal surface is exposed to the solution. In this case, the metallic surface will dominate the electrochemical response (if discrete islands of graphene existed rather than a continuous film then the observed electrochemical response would be dominated by the material exhibiting faster electron transfer kinetics) and without recourse to pertinent control experiments70,90 (using the bare/unmodified metallic surface without graphene) the actual contribution to the electrochemical response can be wrongly attributed.
Given the insights gained throughout this section it can be inferred that fast heterogeneous electron transfer rates in addition to other beneficial electrochemical properties that may be observed at CVD graphene do not necessarily originate from the graphene itself, but rather (in some cases) from the presence of various impurities incorporated during the synthesis of the graphene, such as graphitic regions upon the electrode which exhibit an overabundance of reactive edge plane sites or the presence of functional species upon graphene's surface which can be beneficial or detrimental with regards to certain electrochemical processes. One must bear these factors in mind when assessing the beneficial or detrimental utilisation of CVD graphene within various applications and additionally in the development of improved fabrication methodologies. Note however that the presence of such impurities is not necessarily a negative factor and that CVD graphene can potentially be tailored so that its electronic structure and surface physicochemistry are beneficial with regards to various applications.
3.2. Sensing applications
The detection of various substances including heavy metals, bio-molecules, gases and various organic and inorganic compounds is of high importance due to many human and environmental health implications. Thus the development of sensitive, selective and reliable analytical sensors is of great significance. Graphene has been utilised widely as a sensor substrate within electrochemistry where it has been reported to exhibit excellent electro-catalytic behaviour towards a variety of analytes,3 and has been shown to possess great potential to aid in the development of the enhanced electrochemical sensors of the future. Here we overview the recent and emerging developments concerning the utilisation of CVD graphene within this field.
The utilisation of a CVD EG electrode modified with platinum has recently been reported by Chu et al.91 towards the detection of 1% hydrogen at various temperatures where current–voltage measurements and real-time monitoring of the current flow through the graphene/platinum device were used to confirm the presence of hydrogen gas. Although the authors compared the response observed at graphene/platinum with that at bare platinum (where it was evident that the introduction of graphene greatly enhanced hydrogen sensitivity), they did not however compare this to that at other carbon/platinum based alternatives. Further issues with this work include the ‘in-house’ synthesis of the graphene, which was multi-layered in nature.91 Note that comparable work by Wu and co-workers92 detailed the fabrication of a CVD graphene electrode (shown via Raman mapping to be predominantly monolayer graphene) that was modified with a 1 nm palladium film for its application in hydrogen sensing. The gas sensor (based on palladium-decorated CVD graphene) was subsequently utilised to detect the presence of hydrogen in air at concentrations ranging from 0.0025 to 1% (25–10000 ppm), where the authors report high sensitivity in addition to fast response and recovery at the CVD graphene–palladium electrode, which could be reused for multiple cycles.92 However, as with the former study91 a drawback with this work is the lack of appropriate control experiments in terms of the comparison of performance between the graphene based device and various other appropriate carbon and non-carbon based electrode materials and therefore the reported improved responses could have originated from graphitic or edge plane like impurities within the graphene samples utilised. Having stated this, the above studies lay down important ground work that can be built upon for the future development of sensitive hydrogen detection.
In addition to these studies, Chen et al.93 have reported the utilisation of a monolayer CVD graphene electrode towards the detection of oxygen (O2). According to the authors the electrical resistivity of monolayer graphene exhibits significant changes upon exposure to varying concentrations of O2 at room temperature, this occurs through the attachment of O2 molecules upon the graphene sheet which enhance the hole conductivity.93 A detection limit for the simple CVD graphene based O2 sensor was found to correspond to 1.25% in volume ratio,93 graphene's favourable implementation can be ascribed to its large available surface area over which interaction with the target analyte can readily occur.
Moving on from the detection of gases, Gutés and co-workers have recently developed a new approach towards the development of a single layer CVD fabricated graphene bio-sensor that is decorated with metal nanoparticles.94 Single-layer CVD graphene was fabricated using copper and decoration of the graphene was achieved by electroless deposition of gold nanoparticles using the copper substrate as a source of electrons.94 The authors then transferred the decorated CVD graphene onto a GC electrode and claimed to have offered a sensitive platform for biosensing development.94 As a proof of concept, glucose oxidase was deposited onto the surface in a Nafion matrix (to stabilise the enzyme as well as to prevent interference from AA and UA) before the sensor substrate was tested towards the detection of glucose in the presence of the common physiological interferents AA and UA.94 Amperometric measurements revealed a linear calibration response in the μM range which would suggest that the presented methodology enables highly sensitive platforms for biosensor development to be explored; the authors note that their fabricated device exhibited an enhanced reproducibility when compared to the graphene biosensors reported previously which were based on drop-casting methods of multi-layered graphene suspensions.94 This preliminary work clearly offers numerous advantages in terms of scalability for mass production and the availability of high quality graphene films, however, although characterisation of the graphene was performed and presented, this was of just one area upon the electrode surface (indicating single layered graphene) and in future work appropriate examples within a wider area should be presented to avoid the likelihood of data misinterpretation (see above where graphitic islands could be present elsewhere upon the surface and dominate the electrochemical response).
In other notable work, as stated in the above section (3.1.) Lim et al.79 have reported that anodised CVD EG exhibits improved electron transfer kinetics over that of pristine graphene. The authors naturally extended this study and demonstrated the superior biosensing ability of an anodised CVD EG electrode towards the detection of nucleic acids, UA, DA and AA. Utilising differential pulse voltammetry Lim and co-workers demonstrated that mixtures of nucleic acids (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine) or biomolecules (AA, UA and DA) can be resolved as individual peaks and that the anodised CVD EG could simultaneously detect all four DNA bases in double stranded DNA (dsDNA) without a pre-hydrolysis step in addition to differentiating single stranded DNA from dsDNA.79 Throughout their work Lim et al. contrasted the response of CVD EG to that of pristine graphene, GC and BDD alternatives where, as evident from Fig. 8 for the case of AA, UA and DA, the response of the CVD EG far surpassed and out-performed each alternative.79 Their work shows that graphene with high edge plane defects, as opposed to pristine graphene, is the choice platform in high resolution electrochemical sensing.79

It is interesting to note that in the above examples the performance of CVD graphene is compared only to alternative metallic electrodes and additionally in some cases with various other carbon forms (GC, BDD) that do not possess similar structures. This was a similar problem when carbon nanotubes were first introduced into electrochemistry and electro-catalysis was claimed when compared only to various irrelevant materials, usually GC.3 To gain further insights CVD graphene must be compared to other relevant forms of carbon materials such as the edge or basal planes of HOPG – graphenes closest counterpart. Additionally, limitations arise through the utilisation of ‘in-house’ fabricated graphene, which in contrast to the use of commercially available CVD graphene inhibits the worldwide repetition and development of such work.
With the above insights in mind we have recently explored and contrasted the electroanalytical performance of a commercially available CVD grown graphene electrode to that of edge- and basal-plane pyrolytic graphite (EPPG and BPPG respectively) electrodes constructed from HOPG for the sensing of biologically important analytes, namely NADH and UA.95 Utilising cyclic voltammetry the analytical sensitivities observed towards the detection of NADH at CVD graphene, EPPG and BPPG electrodes were 0.26, 0.22 and 0.15 A cm−2 M−1 respectively;95Fig. 9 depicts the contrasting responses. The similar responses observed at the EPPG and CVD graphene electrodes were inferred to be due to the similar electronic structures of the electrode surfaces (global coverage of edge plane sites, where similar coverages at CVD graphene and EPPG were confirmed via atomic force microscopy (AFM) given that the CVD graphene surface was highly disordered in nature with graphene orientated both parallel and perpendicular to the surface in addition to the prevalence of graphitic islands across its surface which contribute to a large global coverage of edge plane sites – Fig. 10 depicts an AFM image of the CVD graphene surface), in which case the enhanced performance of the CVD graphene over that of the BPPG electrode is as expected given the former possesses a greater degree of edge plane sites over the latter (as would an EPPG electrode), which are the origin of fast electron transfer kinetics.95 Interestingly, for the case of UA the analytical sensitivities of the CVD graphene, EPPG and BPPG electrode were 0.48, 0.61 and 0.33 A cm−2 M−1, respectively, where notably although the performance of the CVD graphene electrode surpassed that of the BPPG electrode it was inferior to that observed at the EPPG electrode, which was inferred to be due to UA's respective surface sensitivity towards the (favourable) presence of oxygenated species and thus was indicative of the differing O/C ratios at the two electrodes.95 It is clear that for the analytes studied, in the best case, the electroanalytical performance of the CVD graphene electrode mimicked that of EPPG, suggesting no significant advantage of utilising CVD graphene in this analytical context.95 This work highlights the importance of edge plane sites (or the orientation of graphene) and oxygenated species (either their absence or presence) in electroanalysis, where control of these factors has the potential to lead to the development of enhanced analytical sensors.

(B) Cyclic voltammetric profiles recorded towards successive additions of 10 μM NADH into a pH 7 PBS (10 to 100 μM) at a CVD graphene electrode.

Thus control experiments utilising EPPG and BPPG of HOPG in addition to various oxygenated or otherwise functionalised or doped forms of graphite are clearly a requirement when advantageous responses are reported using graphene.
Note, in the majority of the above literature reports these have exclusively explored the anodic potential region (typically from 0 up to +1.5 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), predominantly due to the analytes studied.70,79,90,95 Until recently a key application that had not been previously explored with CVD graphene was the sensing of heavy metals – which exclusively involves the cathodic potential region. In an attempt to further expand the horizons of CVD graphene electrochemistry we thus explored the utilisation of a commercially available CVD grown graphene electrode towards the electrochemical detection of lead(II) via anodic stripping voltammetry.96 However, owing to specific limitations that arose during the cathodic pre-treatment step, namely surface instability issues in which the nickel layer (which is the underlying support of the CVD graphene utilised) was detrimentally perturbed and thus detrimentally interfered with the subsequent electrochemical analysis, we found that the respective analytical sensitivity of the CVD graphene electrode was poor and unfavourable in comparison to the current electrochemical literature concerning the detection of heavy metals at carbonaceous electrode surfaces (particularly when contrasted to graphene modified electrodes that had been fabricated through various other means and that did not possess an underlying metal film that could detrimentally interfere with this form of analysis):96–98Fig. 11 depicts the standard response observed at the CVD graphene electrode towards the sensing of lead(II) ions in aqueous solution where the lowest ‘detectable’ addition was 400 μg L−1. Clear insights can be gained from this work, assisting those concerned with CVD graphenes generation/fabrication, in terms of the possible limitations facing the application specific CVD graphene electrodes that are supported upon metal substrates, and in these cases the commercial availability of CVD graphene upon an appropriate insulator/dielectric material should be an area of further investigation if the use of commercially available CVD graphene is to be seen within the electrochemical sensing of heavy metals in the future.

There are many encouraging examples reported for the utilisation of CVD graphene within electrochemical sensing applications where improved sensitivity and detection limits have been obtained. However, given the vital role that specific surface functionalities and edge plane like-sites/defects (graphitic impurities) have in influencing the observed electrochemistry of CVD graphene electrodes, it is clear that in future ventures appropriate control experiments with EPPG and BPPG electrodes need to be conducted to gain a clearer understanding of the observed responses. In addition to this, improved fabrication methodologies, the availability of commercially obtainable CVD graphene and the accurate control of surface defects and functionalities are required before the true implications that CVD graphene is to impose upon the development of enhanced sensing devices can be fully realised.
3.3. Energy storage and generation applications
Increasing worldwide demand for the production of energy generation and storage devices with greatly improved portability, energy efficiency and power output has resulted in the investment of immense research interest into the development of enhanced capacitors, batteries and fuel cells.36 Current devices are inundated with both environmental and performance related issues and thus the investigation of new potential electrode materials is of great significance and importance.36
Lin et al.99 have reported the utilisation of a hybrid CVD graphene super-capacitor material. The authors fabricated a CVD graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode which was reported to exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity and thus have high energy storage capabilities for application in an electrochemical double layer capacitor.99 The fabricated super-capacitor showed high performance with a high specific capacitance of 330 Fg−1 and energy densities as high as 45.8 W h kg−1.99 Furthermore, recent work by Kim and colleagues has built upon foundations of this earlier work through the fabrication and utilisation of a hybrid nanostructure composed of CNTs grown on CVD graphene layers for super-capacitor applications (note, the entire nanostructure (CNTs and graphene) was fabricated via atmospheric pressure CVD).100 Super-capacitor performance of the CNT–graphene hybrid nanostructure indicated an average measured capacitance of 653.7 μF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1,100 with a standard rectangular cyclic voltammetric curve. It was also noted that rapid charge–discharge characteristics (mV s−1) were exhibited with a capacitance of ∼75% (490.3 μF cm−2).100 The favourable super-capacitor performances observed in the cases above (which incorporate a CNT and graphene hybrid material) are likely due to the high surface area of the graphene component in addition to high porosity and interlayer spacing of the compound given that it has been established that larger capacitances at graphene modified electrodes can be attributed to a combination of capacitance due to available edge plane sites and surface area, where enhanced layer spacing results in the superior accessibility of these available components, consequently leading to the higher capacitance values observed.49 With the above studies in mind it would appear that such hybrid CVD graphene–CNT nanostructures are highly attractive materials for high performance super-capacitors and great advances in this area are expected within the future. However, one notes the clear lack of appropriate control experiments, in terms of graphite–CNT and solely CNT alternatives for example, in the above two studies.
Furthermore in terms of energy storage devices, work by Reddy et al.101 involved the CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene for potential application in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery devices. The authors investigated the reversible Li-ion intercalation properties of N-doped graphene and demonstrated that the discharge capacity of N-doped graphene was almost double that of pristine graphene which was attributed to the large number of surface defects (edge plane like-sites/defects) induced due to N-doping (see Section 3.1 for further details concerning the effects that surface defects have upon graphene), which allow favourable Li-ion interaction/storage.101Fig. 12 shows the specific capacity versus cycle number plots for the graphene and the N-doped graphene utilised – pristine and N-doped graphene showed reversible discharge capacities of 0.05 and 0.03 mA h cm−2, respectively, which for the former is comparable with previously reported values of carbon-based thin film electrodes.101 This work offers key insights into the fabrication of N-doped CVD graphene electrodes for the high performance utilisation in flexible thin film batteries. Note that such N-doped CVD graphene will be highly beneficial for various sensing applications given the fundamental understanding regarding improved electron transfer kinetics being related to increments in the degree of edge plane defect density, and additionally due to the possible alterations in the electronic structure of graphene owing to the presence of the dopant.

In terms of energy production, graphene is an attractive electrode material for use within fuel cells because of its large surface area, improved enzymatic binding ability, unique electrical conductivity, widely applicable electro-catalytic activity and low production costs.2,3,35 One notable contribution has been from Qu et al.102 who explored graphene and N-doped graphene formed via CVD towards the electrochemical reduction of oxygen (oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)), comparing it with commercially available platinum loaded carbon. Note that platinum has long been regarded as one of the best catalysts for the electrochemical ORR and is consequently widely utilised in fuel cells; however, it exhibits time-dependent drift due to the poisoning/deactivation of the platinum surface with carbon monoxide and also has the drawback of being expensive.102 Qu and co-workers have shown that N-doped graphene acts as a metal-free electrode, greatly enhancing electro-catalytic activity (likely due to the induced edge plane defects and the altered electronic structure of the N-doped graphene – see above), long-term operation stability, and tolerance to the crossover effect when compared to existing platinum materials towards the ORR (via a four-electron pathway in alkaline solutions producing water as a product).102
Furthermore, note that CVD graphene films have been explored as an advantageous transparent conductive electrode material for use in organic photovoltaic flexible solar cells with beneficial properties being expressed.103–105 In one notable example transparent CVD grown graphene conducting films were successfully incorporated into thin-film CdTe solar cells as the front electrode.105 The authors report the fabricated device to possess a carrier mobility of 550 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an optical transparency of 90.5% from 350 to 2200 nm; achieving an overall power conversion efficiency of 4.17% in the prototype device,105 which is comparable to those of alternative carbon based devices.36,104
Given the pervasive investigation of graphene in a vast degree of electrochemical areas, the utilisation of CVD fabricated graphene within electrochemical energy storage and generation applications is somewhat surprisingly limited at present. In light of the limited literature discussed above exciting future developments in this area are expected; however, caution is advised towards limitations concerning the reproducibility, scalability and characterisation of the fabricated graphene materials and comparison to other forms (such as HOPG, graphite, activated carbons, etc.) before enhanced properties of graphene are claimed.
3.4. Performance of CVD graphene versus chemically synthesised graphenes
As stated throughout the above section (3), the structure and thus quality of a graphene based electrode material is directly related to its performance in numerous sensing and energy related applications viz. how such characteristics affect graphene's fundamental electrochemical properties. For example, the density/prevalence of edge plane like-sites/defects, the presence of specific oxygenated functionalities and/or the incorporation of the graphene into a hybrid composite (or doping including metallic/organic/inorganic impurities) all have a significant effect on the resultant performance (either beneficially or detrimentally). Note that many of these factors can be inadvertently incorporated into the graphene sample as impurities during the fabrication process (see Section 1.1 and Table 1) and as a result graphene that has originated from variable sources is likely to possess variable quantities of the above impurities and thus the performance of such electrode materials is expected to differ greatly.
In terms of the analytical performance observed, examples taken from the literature indicate for instance that the electrochemical sensing of UA at CVD graphene (limit of detection (LOD) of 8.84 μM),95 pristine graphene (LOD of 11.25 μM)106 and graphene fabricated via the reduction of GO (LOD of 0.20 μM)107 varies greatly depending on the origin of the graphene, as is also the case in terms of the performance of graphene in energy storage systems.36 Note, however, that to compare the performance of CVD grown graphene to that of graphene derived from other chemical sources is largely irrelevant given the fact that alterations in the performance are due to the variable quality of the graphene and thus the content of edge plane like-sites/defects, oxygenated species and various other impurities that are incorporated to varying degrees. With this in mind the most significant factor, when contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of CVD grown graphene to that of graphene derived from other chemical sources, is the available control of such defects where they can either be beneficially introduced or minimised and where reproducibility of the given quality is of key importance. In this instance CVD grown graphene is largely advantageous over other fabrication routes given (as observed in Table 2) that the fabrication protocol can be varied which results in greatly variable degrees of graphene quality. As is shown above the performance of pristine graphene is not so beneficial in terms of sensing applications and thus doping and the manufacture of hybrid composites are of vital significance for future improvements, where the CVD process provides a favourable support structure for this to occur (see Section 2). Additional favourable performance comes in terms of being able to readily modify the graphene to be the composition that is required for optimum performance in a given device, which is nearly a realisation for CVD graphene where changing the reaction conditions can alter the orientation and thickness of graphene films (and of course the edge plane, dopant and oxygenated species content) – see Table 2. Finally, a major advantage of CVD graphene is the precise manipulation of the graphene film achievable given that it is immobilised onto a substrate and as a result the reproducibility and stability of the electrode surface is beneficial, unlike the uncertainty and instability observed in chemically derived graphenes dispersed in solvents where one cannot control the precise placement of the graphene.
Thus in terms of the potential application of graphene in various sensing and energy related devices of the future the utilisation of CVD fabricated graphene appears favourable over graphene which is derived from various other sources given the highly reproducible nature of controllable manipulation of the graphene sheets (which is essential), rendering CVD fabricated devices commercially viable.
4. Conclusions and future prospects
In this perspective article we have overviewed the fabrication of CVD grown graphene and explored both its fundamental understanding and applications in electrochemical sensing and energy storage/generation. It is clear that this is still a young field and there is room for improvement in a number of areas for the full potential of CVD graphene to be realised in the electrochemical field. In particular, the CVD fabrication of true graphene, that is, single layer graphene, grown upon catalytic metal surfaces is still yet to be fully realised and will allow not only electrochemists to fully understand its electronic properties but will also find use in a plethora of fields where true single layer graphene is required to fully determine the potential of graphene. In recent studies, as highlighted in this article, the underlying supporting material limits the application of CVD graphene in the cathodic region which is the region where gaseous species are electrochemically reduced; overcoming such difficulties would open up the fuel cell arena and more work is being conducted on the transfer of CVD graphene onto a range of substrates, greatly expanding practical applications of graphene. The electrochemical areas of energy storage where intercalation is an operating mechanism are yet to be fully realised, where the interlayer spacing is larger and more favourable than that of other graphitic materials and coupled with large surface areas of high purity graphene will allow for significant benefits to be observed. However, it is clear that the development of CVD graphene materials and their application in electrochemical sensor and energy related devices is still in its infancy and many challenges and concerns remain.
One of the biggest challenges facing CVD graphene is mass production. Developments in chemical and mechanical transfer methods need to be optimised to ensure that pristine graphene is resultantly transferred. Recently, high-quality large-scale CVD graphene has become commercially available. The company ‘Graphene Supermarket’108 has scaled their graphene production, now selling graphene sheets as large as 4′′ × 4′′. In addition, graphene films transferred onto substrates such as silicon wafers, plastics and glass are also offered. These advances will allow for enhanced research and help facilitate commercial applications of graphene.
Last, in the electrochemical applications of CVD graphene, the following points are to be noted before enhancements are conferred: (1) comparison to other graphitic forms such as edge plane- and basal plane-pyrolytic graphite, graphite, activated carbon and so on; (2) comparison to the underlying supporting metallic surface; (3) consideration of the role of oxygenated species which can be detrimental or beneficial to the electrochemical process under investigation; (4) graphitic impurities (and their orientation) need to be considered which have a strong influence on the electrochemical response; (5) where non-commercially obtained CVD graphene is procured, sufficient characterisation needs to be undertaken in terms of surface microscopy and electrochemical probes. A better understanding of the correlation between the electrochemical performance and graphene structures, properties and interactions is needed such that material scientists' and electrochemists' work in unison to prepare task-specific CVD graphene which will greatly expedite its technological and commercial use.

 	Fig. 3  (A) Raman spectra of a transferred CVD graphene film on SiO2/Si compared for growth by methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol. The small D peak (∼1350 cm−1) and the intensity of the 2D peak (∼2700 cm−1), found to be more than twice as high as the G peak (∼1580 cm−1), indicate the presence of high quality monolayer graphene. (B) SEM images of graphene on 25 μm copper foil substrates, compared for growth by (a) methanol, (b) ethanol, (c) 1-propanol and (d) gas source methane. The images show the presence of copper surface steps and graphene wrinkles which result from the difference between the thermal expansion coefficient of graphene and copper, indicating that the graphene film is continuous and uniform.

 	Fig. 9  (A) Cyclic voltammetric profiles recorded towards 100 μM NADH in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) utilising an EPPG (dashed line), a BPPG (dotted line) and a CVD graphene (solid line) electrode. (B) Cyclic voltammetric profiles recorded towards successive additions of 10 μM NADH into a pH 7 PBS (10 to 100 μM) at a CVD graphene electrode. Note, as the concentration of NADH is increased the peak potential can be observed to shift to more positive potentials, this reflects the electrochemical irreversibility of the electrochemical reaction.109 (C) Calibration plots depicting the peak height as a function of concentration, obtained via cyclic voltammetric measurements performed using an EPPG (triangles), a BPPG (squares) and a CVD-graphene (circles) electrode towards the detection of NADH.
