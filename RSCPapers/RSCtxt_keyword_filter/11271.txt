    , Accepted 13th October 2014First published on 13th October 2014AbstractA water-repellent perovskite solar cell was developed based on anti-reflective lotus leaf-inspired hierarchical pyramidal arrays with enhanced self-cleaning characteristics and was prepared by the replica molding of micro pyramid structures and Ar ion surface treatment. The power conversion efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell was improved from 13.12% to 14.01% by employing such a bifunctional polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film on the perovskite solar cell due to an anti-reflection effect. Moreover, the PDMS film adhered to the perovskite solar cell demonstrated excellent superhydrophobicity, which makes the perovskite solar cell water-repellent.
Since the first report on the solid-state perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% in 2012,1 research on perovskite solar cells has been triggered. As a result, PCEs of 15% were reported in 2013,2,3 which surpassed more than 19% in 2014.4 The PCE of 17.9% is highest among the certification values.5 The perovskite solar cell based on organometal halides has the potential for further improvement in PCE.6,7 Despite an excellent photovoltaic performance from the organometal halide perovskite materials, there are open issues to be addressed such as stability and toxicity.8 One of the critical issues is that CH3NH3PbI3 is extremely soluble in water and even in low humidity conditions. Moreover, CH3NH3PbI3 in contact with water can get converted to PbI2, which is moderately water-soluble, and its use is banned in many countries.8 Thus, protection of CH3NH3PbI3 from water is important in terms of stability and environmental concern.
Anti-reflection (AR) and self-cleaning (SC) surfaces have been studied theoretically9–12 and experimentally13–17 to develop high efficiency solar cells with self-cleaning ability. AR and SC technologies are of importance in terms of harvesting light more efficiently due to the minimization of the absorption loss by reflection and shade. In general, moth-eye inspired nano structures such as nanocone,12,18 nanopillar,19,20 nanopore21,22 or nanodorm structures23 have been employed to reduce absorption loss by enhancing the structural AR effect. These nanotextured surfaces, which have submicron structures with a compact spacing ratio, have demonstrated an appealing performance on the light trapping effect. Despite the abovementioned significant AR effect, however, simple nano-structured AR films are not sufficient for the SC property, requiring a high static contact angle (CA) (>∼150°) and low roll-off angle (ROA) (<∼10°) with long term stability. It is well established that the simple nano-structured surfaces are not capable of possessing low ROAs surfaces according to the Wenzel and Cassie–Baxter models.16 Furthermore, in terms of a fabrication process, there have been extensive efforts to make an anti-reflective self-cleaning structure using conventional fabrication techniques such as electrochemical wet etching,24 photolithography,25,26 electron-beam lithography,24 nanosphere lithography,27,28 and self-assembly approaches.21 However, with these methods, their widespread use for perovskite solar cells has been limited, since they are time-consuming and result in high-cost processes for mass production. Moreover, the additional heat and UV curing procedures of these methods could deteriorate the performance of perovskite solar cells.
We report here a water-repellent perovskite solar cell based on the robust and flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with lotus leaf-inspired dual-scale hierarchical pyramidal arrays having bifunctional roles of anti-reflection and self-cleaning. Notably, we demonstrate not only the AR effect by utilizing a micro pyramid structure but also a robust SC property with high CA (∼157°) and low ROA (∼7°) by creating hierarchical nano wrinkles on the pyramidal arrays. We fabricated the dual-roughness pyramidal structures by utilizing simple soft micromolding lithography and Ar ion surface treatment, which is a geometry-controllable, low-expertise and cost-effective route for practical applications.20,29 It was found that the light harvesting effect and the external protection from dust particles of perovskite solar cell devices were substantially improved, as evidenced by the photovoltaic and water-repellent experiments with the fabricated hierarchical pyramidal structures.
The schematic of fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1a, which comprises the PDMS replica molding, the Ar ion treatment and the fabrication of the perovskite solar cell device. The PDMS micro pyramid arrays with a dimension of 30 μm width and 15 μm height are replicated from its respective inverse pyramid polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film mold (see Experimental for details) by a heat curing process. Then, the PDMS replica is exposed to Ar ion plasma for a few tens of seconds to form nano-wrinkles on the micro pyramid arrays by varying the stiffness of a PDMS surface.30,31 Ar ion irradiation on a PDMS surface leads to the generation of a thin elastic crust layer on the top of the PDMS surface. Due to the higher stiffness (∼100 times) of the thin crust atop than the PDMS layer below, compressive stress is induced on the PDMS surface, which in turn creates nano-wrinkles, whereas no wrinkled surface is formed without the Ar treatment (Fig. S1 in ESI†). To create the dual-scale hierarchical pyramid (H.P.) PDMS arrays with enhanced superhydrophobicity, chemical deposition is conducted on the surface using octafluorocyclobutane (C4F8) gas, which is comprised of Ar ion plasma in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching system (see Experimental for details). The fabricated H.P. PDMS film is smoothly attached on the glass side (front side) of the perovskite solar cell device without covering other adhesives owing to the strong van der Waals force between PDMS and the bare glass.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fabricated bifunctional micro/nano-wrinkled pyramid arrays are shown in Fig. 1b–d. It is demonstrated that the structures have well-defined shapes with high structural fidelity and integrity. Fig. 1d exhibits the magnified SEM images of the H.P. PDMS structure, where the inset clearly shows the formation of nano-wrinkles on the PDMS surface.
We have examined anti-reflection (AR) and self-cleaning (SC) effects of the H.P. PDMS film by using the perovskite solar cell. The structure of perovskite solar cells is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1e. The perovskite solar cell is composed of a thin TiO2 layer as a blocking layer (bl-TiO2), a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer, a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film deposited on the mp-TiO2 layer by a two-step process, a spiro-MeOTAD hole transporting layer (HTM), and a gold electrode. Detailed fabrication method is described in the experimental section, and a real device is shown in Fig. S2 in ESI.† In the focused ion beam assisted cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1f), each layer is distinctly shown, and the pores of mp-TiO2 layer are fully infiltrated with the perovskite. It is clearly seen that the perovskite capping layer is formed on the top of the mp-TiO2 layer and induces heterojunction with the organic HTM layer.
We have investigated the transmittance and reflectance of the fabricated H.P. PDMS film to characterize the optical property of the pyramidal structures. Fig. 2a–b show the transmittance and reflectance spectra of three different samples, including a bare FTO glass, a FTO glass with flat PDMS and a FTO glass with H.P. PDMS. Note that both of the ‘with flat PDMS’ and ‘with H.P. PDMS’ are attached on the bare FTO glass. The laminated surface of a FTO glass with a fabricated thin and flexible H.P PDMS film is shown as an inset photograph in Fig. 2a. The average transmittance of a bare FTO glass is ∼76% in the wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm, which is insignificantly increased to ∼77% with a flat PDMS film on the FTO glass. On the contrary, the FTO glass with the H.P. PDMS film shows a substantially improved transmittance over ∼80%, which is indicative of a strong anti-reflection effect. In the same manner, the average reflectance of the H.P. PDMS film on the FTO glass is ∼5.2%, which is considerably lower than those of the bare FTO glass (∼8.6%) and with a flat PDMS film (∼6.8%).

The inset photographs represent the fabricated flexible H.P. PDMS film attached on a FTO glass, showing the visual effect of anti-reflection. (c) SEM images of the H.P. arrays with a 45° angle with the bottom edge side. The H.P. PDMS film serves as an anti-reflection layer on the perovskite solar cell device. (d) Theoretical scheme of the anti-reflection mechanism on the H.P. PDMS film. The size and color of arrows indicate the relative magnitude and direction of each light. 
First, the observed increase in the anti-reflection effect of the fabricated H.P. PDMS film results from a relatively low refractive index (n) of the PDMS (n ∼ 1.43), which is the intermediate material between air (n ∼ 1) and the FTO glass substrate (n ∼ 1.53) (see Fig. 2d). For this reason, the interfacial Fresnel's reflectance coefficient is expected to be decreased by attaching the PDMS film on the FTO glass, which causes the graded refractive index distribution of the medium along the light path (Fig. S3 in ESI†).32,33 The Fresnel's reflectance coefficient R is briefly defined as. (1)where, n1 and n2 represent the refractive index of the transmitting medium and incident substrate, respectively. It is noted that the value of R is higher at the interface between air and glass (Rag ∼ 4.3%) than those between air and PDMS (Rap ∼ 3.1%). The reflected light at the interface between PDMS and glass will be disregarded owing to the relatively small value of Rpg ∼ 0.1%. It follows that the intermediate PDMS material ensures a lower reflection at the FTO glass substrate. In addition, there is a structural double reflection effect of pyramidal structures, as shown in Fig. 2d. The detailed morphologies of the fabricated anti-reflection PDMS surface are represented in Fig. 2c, in which pyramid arrays are shown in the shape of an isosceles triangle with a 45° angle with the bottom edge side. Fig. 2d demonstrates the dynamics of incident light schematically, assuming that the direction of incident light is perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. The optical advantage of this pyramidal structure is that the first reflected light at the front surface heads for the other adjacent one again. Moreover, the second transmitting light into pyramidal PDMS is totally reflected in the interface between air and the PDMS surface. Light trapping effect in the H.P. PDMS surface induced by such a process of double reflection mechanism enhances transmittance and reduces reflectance of the FTO glass (see ESI and Fig. S4† for more details).

Fig. 3 compares current density–voltage curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, with and without the H.P. PDMS film, on the perovskite solar cell. The photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells, with and without the H.P. PDMS film, are listed in Table 1. Since our H.P. PDMS film can be easily attached on or detached from FTO glass, the same device is used to measure the current–voltage curves and EQE spectra of both the ‘bare FTO glass’ and ‘with H.P. PDMS’ samples in Fig. 3 to ensure that the performance improvement of perovskite solar cells results from the H.P. PDMS film. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is increased from 19.34 to 20.87 mA cm−2 after covering the FTO surface with the H.P. PDMS film, which results in an increase in the PCE from 13.12% to 14.01%, corresponding to a 6.8% increment. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are hardly changed, which indicates that the improved PCE is mainly due to the anti-reflection effect from the H.P. structure. The anti-reflection effect contributes to the entire wavelength range as shown in the EQE spectra in Fig. 3b, which proves that the H.P. PDMS film is effective in harnessing visible light. Integrated Jscs from EQE are calculated to be 15.95 mA cm−2 for ‘bare FTO’ and 16.49 mA cm−2 for the ‘with H.P. PDMS’ sample, respectively. The mismatch in the integrated Jscs from EQE and the Jscs from IV measurements is probably related to a charge collection rate that is slower than the detection limit in the given EQE setup.34,35

In addition to the anti-reflection effect, we further demonstrate the self-cleaning property of the H.P. PDMS film. In the outdoor environment, the harmful dust particles or rain drops could have ill influence on the performance of the perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, protection from water is important to maintain long-term stability of the perovskite solar cell. The CAs and ROAs of DI water (volume of 5 μL) on the H.P. PDMS film are compared to those of the bare FTO and the flat PDMS in Fig. 4a. The H.P. PDMS film demonstrates an extremely high CA of 157° and low ROA of 7°, which is indicative of superhydrophobicity. The flat PDMS film shows a CA of 109° higher than the bare FTO glass (CA = 48°); however, its ROA of 90° is similar to the bare FTO glass, which means that the droplet would not roll off on the surfaces for all the tested tilting angles of the substrates. The inset images show the droplet shapes placed on each surface. We also tested the long-term stability of the superhydrophobic H.P. PDMS film under ambient conditions over a time period of 1 month (Fig. 4b). The robustness of superhydrophobic characteristics using the H.P. PDMS are demonstrated without any noticeable change or degradation. The inset photograph shows the different CAs of several water droplets (coloured with red dye to demonstrate visually) on a perovskite solar cell, where a part is attached with the H.P. PDMS film. This superhydrophobicity of the fabricated H.P. PDMS surfaces leads to a definite self-cleaning effect. The self-cleaning process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4c, where the dust particles can be easily removed by rolling off a water droplet across the surface. The self-cleaning of dust is important in maintaining the performance of the solar cell or module constant, because contamination on solar panels by dust particles or dirty water would block sunlight and consequently degrade the photovoltaic performance. The self-cleaning abilities with and without H.P. PDMS on the perovskite solar cell are shown in Fig. 4d (see also video clips in ESI†). In contrast to the wetted flow on the perovskite solar cell without the H.P. PDMS film (i), the DI droplets easily and quickly roll-off with the dust particles on the H.P. PDMS patterned surface, which demonstrates the self-cleaning behavior (ii). This self-cleaning effect renders the perovskite solar cell water-repellent.

Conclusions
We presented a robust and flexible anti-reflection film with enhanced self-cleaning ability using hierarchical pyramidal arrays with wrinkled surfaces for the water-repellent perovskite solar cell. The hierarchical pyramidal PDMS film with bifunctionality was successfully fabricated by micromolding and Ar ion surface treatment, which was easily attached to the bare FTO glass surface without any additional adhesive. It turned out that the hierarchical pyramidal PDMS film enhanced the photocurrent due to an anti-reflection property for visible light and demonstrated an excellent self-cleaning behavior due to superhydrophobicity. Such a bifunctional property is highly beneficial to solar cell applications, especially ones requiring water-repellent conditions like the perovskite solar cell.
