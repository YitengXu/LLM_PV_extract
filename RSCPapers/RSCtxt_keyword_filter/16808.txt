    , Accepted 2nd October 2013First published on 3rd October 2013AbstractWe present successful scaling-up feasibility of a large-size membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) using a newly developed thin composite polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cell applications. The highly sulfonated end-group cross-linkable polymer electrolytes were synthesized and reinforced using a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (pPTFE) substrate of 15 μm thickness. Here, a lab-scale continuous caster was developed in order to fabricate thin composite membranes with a uniform thickness of 25 μm. The reinforced thin composite membranes exhibit an efficiently reduced water uptake and swelling ratio, and improved oxidative stability in Fenton's reagent compared to normal cast membranes. The optimized composite membrane was subsequently tested in a single-cell and a five-cell stack to demonstrate their feasibility for the scaled-up polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). Eventually, the composite membrane successfully performed in the stack with low scale-up losses of about 2–3%. As a preliminary investigation, an in situ accelerated degradation test (ADT) is performed to evaluate the relative chemical durability of the composite MEA in a 50 cm2 single cell (at 100 °C with approximate relative humidity of 10%), and the degradation kinetic of the MEA (1.47 mV h−1) is comparable to Nafion®212 (1.45 mV h−1) during 24 h ADT.
Introduction
As a promising alternative energy conversion device, polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have been diversely studied due to their high energy conversion efficiency and environmental sustainability.1 In conventional PEFCs, the internal resistance contributed by polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) is predominant,2–4 and a wide range of research has been conducted to develop an alternative thin membrane capable of reducing the internal resistance and membrane price.1,5 Despite of such advantages, PEFC technology still has limitations in terms of commercialization due mainly to membrane durability issues.6 As an effort to resolve this problem, many researchers have strived to develop high performance PEMs, focusing on improving the durability and conductivity of PEFCs.
The most likely method for reducing the resistivity of PEMs is thought to be the reduction of thickness as commercial membranes are continuously practiced last decade.7 Thin membranes however, readily become weak in mechanical properties. Among current alternative membranes, reinforced composite membranes are the most promising solution, since they can provide mechanical strength to a thin membrane. In addition, composite membranes have shown a high dimensional stability against water swelling; simultaneously, low fuel crossover and high chemical durability along with low resistance characteristic, thereby enhancing performances of fuel cells.8–12
In order to enhance the chemical durability of PEMs for PEFCs, several approaches have been explored by improving polymer structures.13,14 It is generally accepted that membrane–electrode assembles (MEAs) are exposed to degradable conditions due to radicals from the undesirable generation of hydrogen peroxide during the PEFC operation.15 Typically, perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) type state-of-the-art polymer structures such as Nafion® membranes and Gore PRIMEA® series are considered as a reference for durable PEFC membranes. As alternatives, various perfluorinated, partially fluorinated, and hydrocarbon-based polymers have been developed for fuel cell applications.13 In particular, sulfonated poly(arylene ether)s,16 sulfonated polyimides,16 and sulfonated polystyrene14 with a cross-linked structure have been frequently employed. In contrast, introduction of a cross-linking monomer during polymerization causes a low ion-exchange capacity (IEC) and proton conductivity due to scarification of ion-exchangeable moieties by cross-linked bridges between backbones. In the light of the cross-linked polymers, recently developed end-group cross-linkable approaches have shown distinct advantages that the membrane may possess a high IEC, reduced water swelling, and high proton conductivity without loss of IEC moieties.17–20 Furthermore, the end-group cross-linked structure based on a fluorinated aromatic poly(phenylene sulfide nitrile) backbone displayed good oxidative stability, mechanical strength, proton conductivity, and swelling ratio for fuel cell applications.17 Owing to those attractive properties, further modification and optimization have been studied by using ethynyl-terminated thermal reactions; however, no further significant breakthrough has been made possibly due to a lack of investigation into membrane durability and scaling-up.
In this study, we investigated the performance of a newly developed composite thin membrane using partially fluorinated aromatic end-group cross-linkable sulfonated poly(arylene ether) electrolytes which had been previously optimized.19 In order to enhance the oxidative durability and conductance, the synthesized polymer electrolytes were reinforced using a thin porous substrate. Specifically, the reinforcing processes were scaled-up using a lab-scale continuous caster to fabricate large-size composite membranes. The advantages of the thin composite membranes were confirmed via water swelling, water uptake, proton conductance, and a Fenton's oxidative stability analyses. Subsequently, large MEAs were fabricated and evaluated in a single-cell and a 5-cell PEFC stack in order to demonstrate their feasibility for scale-up. In addition, preliminary 24 h-chemical durability of the MEA was investigated via in situ accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) in a 50 cm2 single-cell and further potential approaches are addressed.
Experimental section
Materials
Synthetic monomers including potassium 2,5-dihydroxybenzenesulfonate (SHQ), 4,4′-biphenol (BP), and potassium carbonate were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and used after drying at 100 °C in a vacuum oven. Decafluorobiphenyl (DFBP) (Fluorochem Ltd., UK) and 3-ethynylphenol (Alfa Aesar Co., USA) were used as received. N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and benzene were purchased from Aldrich, and methanol (MeOH), sulfonic acid, and hydrochloric acid from Fisher Scientific Ltd. (Korea) were used without further purification. As a reference membrane, Nafion® 212 (DuPont, USA) was used after being treated in a 1 N HCl solution. A catalyst powder (37 wt% Pt, Tanaka, Japan), Nafion® ionomer (Aldrich, USA), and gas diffusion layer (GDL, 10BC, SGL Carbon Group, Germany) were also used in the fuel cell tests.
Polymer synthesis
The end-group cross-linkable sulfonated fluorinated biphenol (ESF-BP) based random copolymers were synthesized (SI, Scheme S1†) from SHQ, BP, DFBP, and 3-ethylnylphenol as reported in our earlier works.18–20 In this study, four types of ESFx-BP-y (where x and y indicate the degree of sulfonation (DS) and cross-linking) copolymers were prepared based on a precisely controlled DS (70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%, denoted as ESF70-BP-0, ESF80-BP-0, ESF90-BP-0, and ESF100-BP-0, respectively). The synthesized polymers were dissolved in DMAc (1 g:5 mL) for 1 day and centrifuged to remove insoluble impurities. The purified polymer solutions were subsequently dried at 40 °C for 1 day and then at 50 °C in a vacuum oven to remove any residual solvent.
Fabrication of a large-size reinforcing membrane
A porous polytetrafluoroethylene (pPTFE) film (Poreflon®, HHP-045-15, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd., Japan) was used in this study. The average pore size and thickness of pPTFE were 0.45 μm and 15 μm, respectively. In order to fabricate a pore-filled composite membrane, the ESFx-BP-0 polymers were dissolved in DMAc and MeOH (1 g:1 mL:1 mL), and impregnated into a surfactant-treated pPTFE substrate. Fig. 1(a) shows the structural concept21 of the physically reinforced composite membrane and a lab-scale continuous caster (Fig. 1(b)) which was developed for continuous pore-filling processes in order to fabricate large-size composite membranes (maximum width: 15 cm). The moving speed of pPTFE was controlled by an electric motor equipped with spur gears. Three critical operating conditions including pPTFE moving speed (1.6 cm min−1), retention time of pPTFE in a polymer solution (10 min), and the weight of a tension bar (8 g) were previously optimized for full impregnation of the polymer solution into a moving pPTFE substrate. The polymer solution completely penetrated into the micro-pores of pPTFE in the retention region, and then excess polymer solution on the moving pPTFE substrates was subsequently removed by casting the surfaces using two rod-type blades (stainless steel) in a vertical rack. Here, the distance between the two rods was precisely controlled using a micrometer (further device information and membrane fabrication are provided in Fig. S1 and S2†). The pPTFE with ESFx-BP-0 films were dried at room temperature and removed from the continuous caster. Finally, the dried membranes (ESFx-BP-0/pPTFE) were fully cross-linked (ESFx-BP-100/pPTFE) by heating at 250 °C for 5 h (ref. 19) in a furnace (heating and cooling rates were maintained at 50 °C for 30 min cycles). The cross-linked composite membranes were then treated in 1 M H2SO4 solution at 80 °C for 6 h and used after washing with DI-water.

Membrane characterization
The hydrophilic properties of the pPTFE and surfactant-treated pPTFE were examined by measuring the contact angle for a water drop using a goniometer (Model 100, Ramé-Hart Inc., USA). A 20 μL water drop was dispensed onto dried samples using a 0.2 mL micrometer syringe (GS-1101, Gilmont Instruments, USA) and a needle (LOT#409602, Hamilton, USA); the resultant contact angle was measured within 5 s.
In order to confirm the physical structure of the composite membrane, the morphologies of surface and cross-section of the membranes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S-4700, Japan). Other properties of the membranes such as in-plane proton conductivity (k), water uptake (Wu), ion-exchange capacity (IEC), swelling ratio (Sw), and oxidative stability in a Fenton's reagent were measured as reported in our earlier works,4,8,14,22 and details about characterization methods are given in the ESI.†
Single-cell test
Performances of the composite membranes were evaluated in single-cells with the active area of 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 (SI, Fig. S3†). The electrode employed in this study was fabricated as described in our previous study.8 The amount of total platinum catalyst loading on the GDL was 0.40 mg cm−2 with 0.09 mg cm−2 of Nafion® inner ionomer, and 0.27 mg cm−2 of Nafion® outer ionomer. The MEA was fabricated by sandwiching the membrane between two electrodes and hot-pressed at 80 °C for 1 h at 1500 psi (SI, Fig. S4†). Each MEA was tested under fully humidified pure hydrogen and oxygen gases under even flow at 20 mL min−1 cm−2. During the single-cell operation, a polarization curve was obtained after activation of the MEA under operation at 0.6 V for at least 6 h until a constant polarization curve was achieved.
PEFC stack test
A PEFC stack was assembled with five-cells connected in series (Fig. 2) to evaluate the practical performances of the large-size membranes (SI, Fig. S4†). Each cell has an active area of 50 cm2 with a serpentine flow field (SI, Fig. S3†), and cooling water (80 °C) was circulated at 900 cm3 min−1 along the inside of each graphite bipolar plate. The PEFC stack was assembled at the same torque (45 kgf cm−1) as a single-cell (SI, Fig. S5†), and the flow rates for fully humidified hydrogen and oxygen gases were the same at 20 mL min−1 cm−2 for each cell. The polarization curves were obtained after the activation process; operating at 0.6 V for at least 12 h and repeating polarization until a constant curve was achieved. In addition, each cell voltage was simultaneously monitored during operation.

Accelerated degradation test (ADT) in a single-cell
As a preliminary short-term investigation, simple in situ accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) were carried out in a 50 cm2 single-cell. Before operating ADTs, sample MEA was activated at 80 °C under fully humidified condition. The activated MEA was then exposed at highly degradable conditions (high temperature and low relative humidity (RH)) – 100 °C and 10% of RH – and open circuit voltage (OCV) were recorded for 24 h as a indicator for degradation.
Results and discussion
Modification of hydrophobic pPTFE surface
Complete impregnation of a hydrophilic polymer electrolyte into a hydrophobic porous substrate is crucial for pore-filling membranes,8,23 since it is difficult to penetrate hydrophilic polymer solutions into the micro-pores of hydrophobic substrates. In this regard, a porous substrate should have good affinity with the hydrophilic polymer electrolytes and solvent that dissolves the electrolyte.8 In addition, a porous substrate to be used for reinforcing ESFx-BP polymer electrolytes should be thermally stable during the ethynyl-termination (end-group cross-linking) reaction at 250 °C. Among the commercially available porous substrates, a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (pPTFE) was chosen due to its high thermal stability (decomposition temperature: lit.,24 ∼494 °C) over the cross-linking temperature.
On the other hand, pPTFE is a hydrophobic polymer and the polymer electrolyte solutions dissolved in DMAc are not readily impregnated due to the poor affinity between pPTFE and the electrolyte solution (Fig. S6†). In order to increase their affinity, the surface of the original pPTFE was modified by immersing in 10% surfactant solution for 30 min and subsequently dried at room temperature. To ensure surface modification, the water wettability and contact angle were examined. As shown in Fig. 3, the surfactant-coated pPTFE is wettable for water as the degree of contact angle for the water drop was reduced from 141° to 47°. Therefore, it is expected that the hydrophilic polymer electrolytes can penetrate into the surface modified pPTFE without any external forces.

Morphologies of the reinforced composite membranes
In order to fabricate a large-size pore-filled membrane, two parameters (concentration of polymer solutions and retention time) were previously optimized for the complete impregnation of polymer solutions into pPTFE, as provided in the experimental section. Specifically, the polymer solutions were not impregnated into the original pPTFE, whereas the surface-modified pPTFE absorbed the polymer solution within 10 min due to the increased hydrophilicity of the porous substrate (SI, Fig. S7†). The morphologies of the membranes using the continuous caster were analyzed by SEM (Fig. 4). The pPTFE pores were well filled with the polymer, and the surface of the membrane was even at the microscopic level (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The overall thickness of the swollen membrane was 25 ± 3 μm, and the average thickness of each surface dense layer was about 5 μm, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The dense layers were uniformly formed on both surfaces (top and bottom) of the membrane; these symmetric dense layers have been reported to be efficient in reducing the interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode of an MEA.2,23 Moreover, this symmetric structure implies that the lab-scale continuous caster is well designed and capable of fabricating uniform reinforcing membrane by using the precisely controlled rod-type casting blades on both sides of the membrane (SI, Fig. S2†).

Reinforcement of highly sulfonated polymer
Hereinafter, the reinforced composite membranes are referred as ESF70-BP-100/pPTFE, ESF80-BP-100/pPTFE, ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE, and ESF100-BP-100/pPTFE according to their DS. Often, a highly sulfonated polymer electrolyte excessively swells and uptakes much water and that makes membrane weak. The primary purpose of the composite membrane structure is a mechanical reinforcement of the highly sulfonated polymer electrolytes and resolve high water uptake and water swelling problems. As shown in Fig. 5, the water uptake and water swelling of the reinforced membranes were significantly reduced compared to the cast membranes which imply that the pPTFE substrate is suitable as a mechanical framework. Moreover, the swelling ratios of the composite membranes were lower than Nafion®212, which implies that the dimensional stabilities of the composite membranes are comparable to Nafion®212.

Other membrane properties are summarized in Table 1, including the thickness of the swollen membrane, proton conductivity, proton conductance, and IEC. With an increasing DS of polymer electrolyte from 70% to 100%, the IEC gradually increased from 1.45 mequiv. g−1 to 2.07 mequiv. g−1 for the cast membranes, and from 0.72 mequiv. g−1 to 1.51 mequiv. g−1 for the reinforced membranes, respectively. Although the IEC of the reinforced membranes were lower than the IEC of the cast membrane due to the weight portion of the non-charged pPTFE substrate (note that the IEC was calculated based on dried weight of the membrane samples), the IEC of the reinforced membranes were comparable to the IEC of Nafion®212.

The IEC values for ESF80-BP-100/pPTFE, ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE, and ESF100-BP-100/pPTFE were higher than the IEC of Nafion®212 however, the in-plane proton conductivities were lower than 0.089 S cm−1 obtained for Nafion®212. Proton conductivity is one of the critical parameters for a fuel cell membrane. It is generally accepted that proton conducting features could be anisotropic4 (i.e., in-plane direction and through-plane direction conductivities of a membrane could be different according to formation of ion conducting nanochannel). In general, protons transport a distance vertical to the plane of the membrane from anode to cathode. Therefore, through-plane conducting characteristic would provide better information than in-plane conductivity in estimating the performance of the membrane in a practical fuel cell. Here, the proton conductance is a useful parameter for estimating the fuel cell performance based on the in-plane proton conductivity and thickness as reported previously.8 The proton conductance of ESF70-BP-100/pPTFE (6 S cm−2) was lower than Nafion®212 (15 S cm−2) whereas, the other membranes show relatively high conductance values. Therefore, it is expected that the fuel cell performance can be improved by using any of ESF80-BP-100/pPTFE, ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE, and ESF100-BP-100/pPTFE.
In order to compare the fuel cell performance, H2/O2 single-cell tests were conducted using an active area of 5 cm2 with Nafion®212. As a result, the fuel cell performances of the three reinforced membranes were higher than Nafion®212 (Fig. 6). This fact again supports that the proton conductance of a thin membrane is an effective parameter for estimation of fuel cell performances. On the other hand, the performance of the ESF100-BP-100/pPTFE was lower than that of the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE, despite of the higher membrane conductance. The lower fuel cell performance with a high conductance membrane implies that the fully sulfonated membrane (ESF100-BP-100/pPTFE) may not hold moisture at a raised temperature even with water supply from the humidifier and reduction reaction during the fuel cell operation. Notice that the conductance was measured for the fully hydrated membrane at room temperature. Therefore, a higher ohmic resistance and mass transfer limitation may occur readily due to MEA drying problem unlike partially sulfonated membranes. Accordingly, ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE exhibited the highest maximum power density at 1.2 W cm−2 among the three membranes, and it was employed for further investigations on scaling-up performances for a large size single-cell and five-cell stack.
 Fig. 6  Polarization behaviors of the reinforced composite membranes having different DS in comparison of Nafion®212 at 60 °C:RH100 in a 5 cm2 H2/O2 single-cell (open symbols indicate I–V curves and filled symbols indicate power density). 
Large size (50 cm2) single-cell performances
To evaluate the feasibility of the scaled-up ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE large membrane in a practical system, a single-cell test was conducted for an active area of 50 cm2. The membrane performance was evaluated at the temperature from 60 °C to 90 °C for every 10 °C under fully humidified conditions in an H2/O2 fuel cell (SI, Fig. S8†). The performance of each MEA gradually increased as the temperature was increased from 60 °C to 80 °C, though decreased at 90 °C due to dry out of a membrane even under fully humidified conditions. This phenomenon became severe for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE membranes, because of a higher water uptake of the membrane (39%) than Nafion®212 (16%). Here, the highest performance was observed at 80 °C for both the MEAs comprising ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE and Nafion®212, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The maximum power density was enhanced by 18% when using the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE membrane. In addition, the MEAs were operated for 12 h at a constant current (CC) density of 1 A cm−2, and reactants were supplied at 500 ccm (cubic centimeters per minute). As shown in Fig. 7(b), a very stable energy output was maintained during the 12 h-CC operation; 0.62 V for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE and 0.60 V for Nafion®212 at 1 A cm−2, thereby confirming that the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE composite membrane is suitable for a large-size MEA of a fuel cell.

Five-cell (50 cm2) PEFC stack performances
A PEFC stack was assembled in series of 5-cell with an active area of 50 cm2 for each channel to evaluate the performance of ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE at a high power level. Fig. 8(a) shows the polarization curves for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE and Nafion®212 by operating the stack. Since the five-cells were assembled in series, the overall open circuit voltage (OCV) of each stack increased to 4.87 V and 4.85 V for Nafion®212 and ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE, respectively. The performance of the 5-cell stack was relatively coincident with the estimation from the 50 cm2 single-cell performance (SI, Table S1†); however, there were serious losses in the high current region for the both cases. In order to examine the phenomena, each channel voltage monitored during the polarization operation is provided in Fig. S9†. It is seen that the voltage of Cell-1 rapidly decreased at a high current density compared to the other cells. This drop implies that very significant mass transfer limitation (predominantly due to the water flooding) occurred in Cell-1, therefore it is possible to attribute that the dramatic voltage losses of the stack at the high current region was induced by the non-uniform water flooding problem and eventually caused uneven mass (gas and water) distribution through the five-MEAs, being frequently observed in fuel cells.25 In order to resolve the reactant distribution problem, it is hereby recommended that the flow channel be improved for uniform gas distribution and water management at a high flow rate.
 Fig. 8  Five-cell PEFC stack performances: polarization curves and 24 h – CC operation at 1 A cm−2 at 80 °C for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE composite membrane and Nafion®212 (The stack was operated under fully humidified conditions and cooling water was circulated at 80 °C during the operation). 
In addition to the polarization operation, each stack was operated at a constant current in order to confirm its practical feasibility of the large-size composite membranes. Fig. 8(b) presents the power output from the stack employing ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE and Nafion®212, respectively, which operated at CC density of 1 A cm−2. This 24 h-CC operation shows that the PEFC stack with the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE membrane stably generated 167 W, which was higher than the Nafion®212 stack (154 W). Therefore, it was confirmed that a 220 W-level PEFC stack was well developed by using the 5-MEAs of ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE composite membrane which is higher than the Nafion®212 case under the same conditions.

Table 2 shows the calculated scale-up power losses in the 5-cell stack by comparing the single-cell performance with the effective MEA area. In the case of Nafion®212, there were no significant scale-up power losses for scale-up Case-I and Case-II, whereas about 4% losses occurred at the maximum power output for Case-II. Although the scale-up maximum power loss for Nafion®212 MEA was ignorable for the Case-I, it was found to be significant for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA particularly for a high current region. From the performance values for the Case-I, it is evident that the 50 cm2 Nafion®212 MEA has been uniformly fabricated and the 50 cm2 single-cell can be used to study scaling-up effects for the sample MEAs. Unlike Nafion®212 MEA, the maximum power loss for the 50 cm2 ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA was around 27%, whereas the power loss at 1 A cm−2 was ignorable for the Case-I. This implies that mass transfer limitation (predominantly due to water flooding problem at the cathode side) become more significant for the larger MEA. Since there were no differences between the 5 cm2 and the 50 cm2 single-cells for the Nafion®212 MEAs, a lager mass transfer limitation of the 50 cm2 ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA than the 5 cm2 MEA is attributed to the binding problems (formation of interface) between the large-size membrane (non-Nafion®) and electrode (Nafion® binder) as shown in Fig. S12.†3 On the other hand, there were about 2–3% losses (Case-II) for ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA. These low scale-up losses imply that the five-MEAs were well fabricated and the large-size ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE could be used for scale-up operation.

Accelerated degradation tests (ADTs): a preliminary examination
Chemical durability of ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE was evaluated by conducting ADTs. In a previous work, the durability of the cast ESF90-BP-100 membrane was observed via a modified DOE ADT protocol (mechanical wet/dry cycle) and around 24% of OCV stability was shown compared to that of Nafion®212.19 The wet/dry cycle may represent the mechanical (or dimensional) durability of an MEA and is closely related to both the swelling ratio and the interfacial affinity between the electrode binder and membrane. In addition to the previous mechanical ADT, here we examined an ADT focusing on the chemical durability of the reinforced ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE composite membrane. Generally, an ex situ Fenton's degradation is tested to evaluate the oxidative durability of a polymeric membrane by measuring the residual weight of dried membrane during the oxidation.14,17,22Fig. 9 shows the Fenton's degradation test for the Nafion®212, ESF90-BP-100 cast, and ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE reinforced membranes, respectively. The cast membrane completely dissolved in Fenton's reagent within 3 h, whereas the reinforced membrane was more stable than the cast membrane without a support matrix. This implies that that the composite membrane structure is efficient to enhance the oxidative stability due to homogeneity of the large-size membrane that was fabricated in a continuous caster, as well as stable binding between the porous matrix and polymer electrolyte. In the case of Nafion®212, there was no significant weight change in the Fenton's reagent.

In addition, in situ ADT tests were conducted in a 50 cm2 single cell. Beyond the RH cycle, fuel cell operation at a high temperature and low humidity is a harsh operating condition that induces a high chemical degradation of a membrane.6,26–28 In order to examine this accelerated chemical degradation in a fuel cell environment, Nafion®212 and ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEAs (with active area of 50 cm2) were operated at 100 °C and 10% of RH, and the OCV decay was monitored for 24 h (Fig. 10). The accelerated voltage decay rate was extrapolated based on the OCV change during 24 h ADT operation (SI, Fig. S10†). After the ADT, polarization curves were again measured at 80 °C in order to confirm the performance drop due to the MEA degradation (SI, Fig. S11†). In these curves, the performances were significantly decreased, confirming that the conditions of ADT (at 100 °C, RH10) are effective to induce degradation of the membranes. The OCV decay rate of Nafion®212 MEA was 1.45 mV h−1 (ADT-I), whereas the decay rate of the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA were 2.44 mV h−1 (ADT-II) and 1.47 mV h−1 (ADT-III). Indeed the decay rate of the ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE MEA was inconsistent for the repeated tests, probably due to unstable binding problem of the MEA (SI, Fig. S12†). However, it is especially meaningful that the decay rate of ADT-III was comparable to ADT-I despite of poor MEA binding problem.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the high performance of a large-size MEA was developed by reinforcing highly sulfonated end-group cross-linkable polymer electrolytes using a porous PTFE substrate. Specifically, a lab-scale continuous caster was designed to fabricate uniform large-size reinforced membranes. Among the developed membranes, ESF90-BP-100/pPTFE showed the highest performance in a fuel cell tests, and its feasibility for scale-up study was demonstrated using 5 cm2 single-cell, 50 cm2 single-cell, and 50 cm2 five-cell PEFC stack tests. The resultant membrane was successfully tested in a 220 W stack, whereas Nafion®212 exhibited a 190 W under the same conditions. In addition, very stable power was generated for 1 day. As a preliminary examination, ex situ and in situ ADTs were conducted in order to evaluate the chemical durability of the composite membrane, and enhanced oxidative stability was confirmed from a Fenton's degradation test, when compared to the cast membrane with no reinforcing matrix. Moreover, an effective MEA degradation tests were established from an in situ ADT in a 50 cm2 single-cell. Although a further approach remains to be resolved regarding the MEA binding problem, it is meaningful that a comparable degradation kinetic was attained by the composite membrane.
