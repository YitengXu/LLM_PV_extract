    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 15th February 2018AbstractIn this work, we reported two wide band-gap donor–acceptor (D–A) photovoltaic materials based on asymmetric benzodithiophene units with a bare phenyl or alkoxyl chain modified phenyl group as one of the substitutions. The optical band-gaps of the two polymers are both identified above 1.80 eV. P2 (with a side chain in the phenyl group) reveals slightly red-shifted film absorption spectra compared to polymer P1 attached with the bare phenyl group, which is partly attributed to the better molecular conformations and intermolecular interactions. Polymer solar cells with different acceptor materials are fabricated to systematically evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the two polymers. The results show that P2 based fullerene and fullerene-free solar cells both show superior photovoltaic performance over the devices of P1, mainly attributed to the more favorable heterojunction morphologies and more balanced charge transport. P2 based PSCs with PC71BM as the acceptor demonstrate an enhanced efficiency (8.58%) compared to that of P1 (7.04%). Notably, low boiling point toluene was reported as an effective additive for the first time to optimize the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-free polymer solar cells. The best efficiency of the P2/ITIC based devices reached over 9%, with a VOC of 0.90 V, JSC of 16.70 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.603, suggesting the great potential of low boiling point solvents as the additive toward efficient fullerene-free polymer solar cells.
Introduction
The past few years have witnessed tremendous progress in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Massive research work has been accomplished to promote the application of PSCs due to their advantages such as low cost, low weight, flexibility and solution-processing.1–4 To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs through the elaborate design of electron donors and fullerene acceptors have reached 10%.5–12 The recent studies of small molecule fullerene-free acceptors based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT) building blocks have greatly boosted the efficiencies of polymer solar cells.13–22 Recently, Hou and coworkers reported an inspiring work with a record high efficiency of a single device reaching 13.1%, through rational molecular design and device optimization.23 It is known that the PCEs of polymer solar cells are synergistically determined by open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). According to the previous report, the maximum value of VOC appears to be limited by the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. Also, different donor–acceptor distances, morphologies of active layers and device structures could further affect VOC values.24,25 Complementary and strong absorption spectra, high and balanced charge mobilities, fine miscibility and film forming properties could probably gain high JSC values. Fill factors are influenced by multiple factors including BHJ morphology, carrier mobilities and so forth.
The main backbones of polymers determine the basic opto-electronic properties of materials including the approximate location of molecular energy levels, the ability of light-harvesting and charge transport behaviors. For example, with the classical electron-deficient unit 2, 1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) replaced by naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (NT), the resulting polymers exhibit deeper LUMO levels and greatly expanded absorption properties leading to the eventual improvement of PCE.26 Nevertheless, the side chains including flexible alkyl or alkoxyl chains and rigid π-conjugated aryl groups also play a vital role in the regulation of photo-physical and electrochemical properties, molecular orientation and compatibility with acceptor materials as well. The modulation of unconjugated alkyl or alkoxyl side chains including chain type, length, shape and branching points is a useful strategy to tune polymer packing, molar absorptivity and BHJ morphology, in addition to serving primarily as solubilizing groups.27–29 For instance, Hwang and coworkers reported a series of donor polymers with alkyl chains of varying length on the π-bridge unit to explore the influence of side chains on the degree of molecular backbone coplanarity, molecular packing and hole mobilities.30 Beaujuge's group carefully studied the types of alkyl chains (linear chains and branched chains) in benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT)–thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) based polymers (PBDTTPD). They found that substitutions of linear side chains in PBDTTPD polymers can greatly impact the polymer stacking orientation and solar cell device efficiencies.31 Rigid conjugated side groups could also be introduced to enhance the π–π stacking of polymers and effectively optimize the frontier energy levels through adjusting the ionization potential of aryl substitutions.32–34 It is known that the benzodithiophene building block serves as the star unit of the electron-donating moiety to construct donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers.35 The alkoxyl modified BDT based polymers usually show good solubility, closed stacking distance, and ordered film microstructure, which would be beneficial to charge transport. In contrast, aryl modified BDT based polymers can possess low-lying HOMO energy levels for a high VOC through decreasing the electronegativity of aryl substitutions.
In our previous work, we created a novel symmetry-breaking modified BDT moiety to combine the advantages of both one-dimension and two-dimension symmetric BDTs.36 Based on this strategy, we have reported highly efficient asymmetric donor polymers with a PCE of 9.80% in fullerene based PSCs and superior efficiency up to 10.50% in fullerene-free solar cells with low energy loss.37,38 In this work, we further designed two polymers based on asymmetric benzodithiophene units (with the bare phenyl or alkoxyl chain modified phenyl group as the two-dimensional substitution) and weak electron-deficient unit benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) to afford wide band-gap polymers. The two polymers without and with a side chain on phenyl substitution are assigned to be P1 and P2, respectively. Intensive intermolecular interactions and red-shifted absorption were caused by the introduced flexible side chain to the bare phenyl of the BDT core. As a result, the P2/PC71BM based solar cells demonstrate obviously elevated power conversion efficiencies up to 8.58%, which is higher than the optimal efficiency of P1/PC71BM based devices (7.04%). A similar tendency was also observed with the widely used fullerene-free ITIC as the acceptor. However, despite the enhanced optical current in fullerene-free solar cells, the largely weakened fill factors depressed the overall PCE to 7.64% in the P2 based devices. Additives were carefully tested to optimize the BHJ morphologies of polymer/ITIC blends. Surprisingly, we demonstrate the first example of using low boiling point toluene as the additive to tune the polymer/ITIC BHJ morphologies and increase the efficiencies of PSCs. The optimized blends produce diminished defects and more balanced hole/electron transport contributing to the improvement of fill factors, JSC and the best efficiency of the P2/ITIC based fullerene-free PSCs reaching 9.06%. Molecular conformations, photophysical/electrochemical properties, charge transport and film morphology were systematically investigated to reveal the structure–property relationships and provide a valuable experience for the design of high performance photovoltaic materials and devices.
Results and discussions
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of polymers P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme 1. Polymers were prepared by stille polymerization between 2BrBDD and BDT-1 or BDT-2 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and the detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the Experimental section. The two polymers exhibit acceptable solubility (12 mg mL−1) in heated o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB, 100 °C). The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which was performed with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as eluent at 150 °C and polystyrene was used as the standard. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1 and P2 were determined to be 55.8 kDa and 67.6 kDa, and 2.03 and 2.34, respectively, and the relevant data are collected in Table 1. The thermal properties of the two polymers were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the curves are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The decomposition temperatures (Td) with 5% weight loss for P1 and P2 are confirmed to be 433 °C and 437 °C, respectively.

Photophysical properties and frontier energy levels
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers were measured in dilute o-DCB solutions and thin films and the corresponding data are displayed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the two polymers exhibit almost identical absorption profiles with broad absorption from 300 nm to 675 nm in dilute solutions. However, when it comes to the thin films, as shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption peak of P2 possesses a slight red-shift compared to that of P1 by about 10 nm, which should be caused by the stronger intermolecular interactions of P2 in the solid state.39
 Fig. 1  (a) The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in dilute solutions; (b) the absorption spectra of P1, P2, PC71BM and ITIC measured as thin films. 
Accordingly, the optical bandgap of P2 is slightly narrowed to 1.84 eV from that of P1 (1.86 eV), calculated from the onset wavelengths of the film absorption spectra. Furthermore, the bands around 400 nm may be attributed to the π–π* transition, as shown in Fig. 1b.40 In the range of 500–700 nm, there are two distinct absorption peaks. The bands around 575 nm probably originate from an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) effect between the electron-donating BDT unit and the electron-withdrawing BDD unit, and the raised shoulder absorption feature around 620 nm was assigned as an “aggregation peak”, which has been shown to be directly correlated with polymer aggregation in solution and polymer crystallinity in the solid state.41,42 Compared to the ICT absorption peaks, the intensities of the aggregation peaks for the P1 and P2 films are calculated to be 1.12 and 1.23 fold, respectively. Thus, this also indicates that the film of P2 exhibits a relatively stronger aggregation ability than P1.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed to measure the oxidation/reduction potentials and further estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers. The CV curves of the two polymers are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Calculated from the equation: EHOMO = −e(φox + 4.8 − φ1/2,FeCp2) (eV), the HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are identified to be −5.31 eV and −5.29 eV, respectively. Based on the optical bandgaps, the LUMO energy levels of both P1 and P2 are calculated to be −3.45 eV. Compared to the analogous polymer in our previous work with a naphthyl group as the aryl substitution instead of a phenyl group,38 the elevated molecular energy levels of P1 and P2 should be ascribed to the relatively stronger electron density of the phenyl group. To further investigate the molecular conformational changes after featuring side chains of polymers, theoretical calculation was employed by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The long alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to reduce the calculation time. As indicated in Fig. 2, the dihedral angles of the two polymers between the BDT core and phenyl side groups are very close, suggesting a negligible disturbance of the side chain in the bare phenyl group. Also, the torsion angles of the backbone between the BDD core and its adjacent thiophene bridges are similar for the two polymers. Nevertheless, an obvious decrease of distortion between the BDT core and its adjacent thiophene group was found after the introduction of the side chain on bare phenyl, indicating a positive impact on molecular planarity, and this should benefit the molecular packing, as suggested from the film absorption spectra of the two polymers. Though the origin of this change is somewhat ambiguous, it indeed reveals the optimization of side chains on molecular conformations. Also, the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy values suggest little difference between the two polymers in the distribution of electron cloud and frontier energy levels, which is consistent with the results of the electrochemical studies (see Fig. S3, ESI†).

Characterization and analysis of photovoltaic performance
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/donor:acceptor/PFN/Al and measured under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. Polymer P1 or P2 was employed as the donor material. To fully investigated the photovoltaic performance of the couple donor polymers, PC71BM and ITIC were utilized as the acceptor materials to prepare fullerene-based and fullerene-free PSCs. The device structure and the corresponding energy level diagrams of the materials are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The gaps of the HOMO and LUMO levels (ΔHOMO and ΔLUMO) between donor materials and the acceptor counterpart are no less than 0.3 eV, which would help to yield an ample driving force for exciton separation from the point of view of donor/acceptor materials.43

Different donor:acceptor weight ratios (w/w) were scanned from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 and the optimal weight ratios were confirmed to be 1:1 for all devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding photovoltaic data with different w/w are summarized in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†). The optimal results are collected in Table 2 and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3c. With PC71BM as the acceptor, the polymer solar cells of P1 exhibit a maximum efficiency of 7.04%, with a VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 12.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.631. The best efficiency of the P2 based devices reveals a superior PCE of 8.58%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, improved JSC of 15.30 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.660. A similar enhancement trend was also observed in the fullerene-free solar cells, although with inferior efficiencies to those of the PC71BM devices. The P2:ITIC devices afford a best PCE of 7.64%, higher than that of the P1:ITIC devices (6.50%). From the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, as shown in Fig. 3d, the P2 based devices both exert an enhanced EQE response over those of P1, consistent with the improved JSC of the respective devices. The results of the photovoltaic studies of the two polymers indicate a promoting effect of the side chain, mainly improving the photocurrent and fill factors. Based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (see Table 2 and Fig. S5, ESI†), the P2 based solar cells possess a more balanced hole/electron mobility than that of P1, and thereby partly promote the increase of photocurrent and fill factors of solar cells.14,44,45

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to explore the stacking features in different BHJ blends. As shown in Fig. 4, four as-prepared blend films including P1/PC71BM, P2/PC71BM, P1/ITIC and P2/ITIC were characterized. Distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.91° were observed in the two P1 based blends (P1/PC71BM and P1/ITIC), indicating the formation of laminar stacking by long alkyl chains with dspacing = 17.98 Å calculated from Bragg's law. In contrast, for the two P2 based blends (P2/PC71BM and P2/ITIC), the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.91° become obscure, accompanying a slight increase of broad diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 23.5°. According to a previous report, the emergence of π–π stacking would reduce the distance of π-orbitals among polymer chains and facilitate the charge transport, leading to the enhancement of photocurrent and photovoltaic performance.

Furthermore, as shown in Table 2, the polymer/ITIC based solar cells display relatively low hole and electron mobilities and unbalanced charge transport, leading to lower fill factors than the PC71BM based devices. This unbalanced hole/electron mobility could also increase the charge recombination inside the blends and become one of the main obstacles in the achievement of the maximum JSC that can be reached. Although with higher JSC induced by the largely expanded photo-response range, the overall PCEs of the fullerene-free solar cells are less effective than the fullerene devices. To optimize the fill factors and efficiencies of the fullerene-free devices, thermal annealing and additives including 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chorolnaphthalene (CN) were carefully investigated, while the results were disappointing with PCEs that declined instead of improved (see Table S1, ESI†). However, during the course of device optimization, we surprisingly found that the addition of toluene (T) to the mixed solution is an efficient approach to enhance the fill factor and efficiencies of ITIC based devices. With the addition of 3% toluene to the processing solvent o-DCB (v/v), the best efficiency of the P1/ITIC fabricated PSCs improved from 6.50% to 7.46% with a VOC of 0.90 V, JSC of 13.81 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 0.599. As for the more efficient donor material P2, the maximum PCE boosted from 7.64% to 9.06%, with a VOC of 0.90 V, enhanced JSC of 16.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.603. The optimal J–V curves with additives are shown in Fig. 5a. Noticeably, we have presented a low boiling point (BP) non-halogenated additive (toluene) as the first example in fullerene-free solar cells, which is quite different from traditional additives including DIO and CN, which usually involve high boiling points. The effect of toluene on the improvement of photovoltaic performance is not well understood, especially considering that the traditional high BP additives usually cause an increase in extra time needed for molecular self-assembly during the process of spin-coating. We speculate that this may be related to the decrease in ITIC solubility and increase of ITIC stacking during the spin-coating when toluene was added into the DCB solution. A similar enhancement of molecular stacking of small molecule donor materials was observed in fullerene solar cells with pyridine as the additive.46 Nevertheless, from the SCLC measurements shown in Table 2, the electron mobilities of the polymer/ITIC devices with additive are both raised, resulting in more balanced hole/electron charge transport. Specifically, the hole/electron value of P2 based fullerene-free solar cells with additive reaches 1.34. The balanced mobilities would facilitate the charge transport to the anode and cathode electrodes, suppress bimolecular recombination and further maximize the fill factors and photocurrent of solar cells.
 Fig. 5  (a) The J–V curves of fullerene-free devices with additive toluene (3% T) optimization; (b) EQE response of devices with and without additive optimization. 
The EQE responses of devices with and without additive were measured and are displayed in Fig. 5b. For the P2 based device, there is an obvious rise response in nearly all measured wavelengths, consistent with the improved JSC after the addition of additive (see Table 2). Furthermore, a slight red-shift of the EQE curves for both the P1/ITIC and P2/ITIC blends was observed after the treatment of toluene. The absorption spectra of the two blends with and without additive were further measured to evaluate the influence of the additive. As shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), the two blends both reveal a red-shifted absorption by about 5 nm with toluene optimization, consistent with the results of EQE measurements. This change was possibly caused by the more orderly molecular stacking in the BHJ, especially for ITIC considering it covers most of the absorption at long wavelength.
Morphology studies
To explore the effect of the molecular structures and additive on the surface morphology of the BHJ blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements by tapping-mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were applied to study the surface morphology information and in-depth relationship of the material structures and properties. As shown in Fig. 6a, some separated light regions are observed in the P1/PC71BM blend. From the results of the respective AFM images (see Fig. S7, ESI†), we can recognize that these light regions should be some low-lying holes. These defects would play a role of charge traps, increasing the degree of charge recombination and giving rise to the decrease of photocurrent eventually.47,48 Thus, the diminishment of the defects would be fairly important to improve the photocurrent and efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6d, for the P2/PC71BM blend, we found that the defects largely shrank and nanoscale fine dispersed fibers formed. This would suggest that the introduction of flexible side chains to the bare phenyl substitutions attached to polymer helps strengthen the miscibility of the polymer and acceptor, reduce the defects and should facilitate charge transport and gain higher JSC. As for the polymer/ITIC blends, a similar tendency is obtained. Although most of the defects in the P2/ITIC blends are wiped out, the residual defects would still trap the free carriers and harm the fill factors of the devices, especially considering the lower hole and electron mobilities of the fullerene-free devices (see Table 2). The addition of toluene as additive (3%) to the mixed polymer/ITIC solutions before spin-coating obviously optimized the heterojunction morphologies. As shown in Fig. 6c, the defects in the P1/ITIC blend became smaller than the film with additive. More importantly, benefiting from the combined promoting effects of the polymer structure optimization and additive process, finely dispersed fibers formed and the defects were further swept out from the inside of the P2/ITIC blend with very few remaining, consistent with the enhancement of JSC and fill factor of the resulting devices with the PCE exceeding 9%.

Conclusions
In this work, based on two asymmetric BDT unit constructed D–A polymers, we reported two wide band-gap donor materials and evaluated the photovoltaic performance in fullerene and fullerene-free solar cells. The results show that the flexible alkoxyl chains attached onto the bare phenyl substitutions of the asymmetric BDT core enhanced the polymer intermolecular interactions and the miscibility with acceptor materials. This produced higher efficiencies of the P2 based solar cells than those of P1, blending with PC71BM or ITIC. The best efficiency of the P2/PC71BM based devices reveals a superior PCE of 8.58%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, improved JSC of 15.30 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.660. Moreover, additives were carefully investigated to improve the low fill factors and efficiencies of the polymer/ITIC based solar cells, which were mainly limited by the weak electron mobilities and unbalanced hole/electron charge transport. We surprisingly found that addition of toluene (T), which is quite different from the traditional halogenated additives, with a high boiling point is an efficient approach to enhance the fill factor and efficiencies of ITIC based devices. With 3% toluene as the additive, the electron mobilities of the fullerene-free devices are enhanced and the charge transport becomes more balanced, leading to the greatly promoted fill factors and efficiencies. Specifically, combining the side chain optimization and additive process, commendable BHJ morphology with few defects was observed in the P2/ITIC blends and the maximum PCE reached 9.06%, with a VOC of 0.90 V, enhanced JSC of 16.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.603. The optimization of photovoltaic properties by simple introduction of a side chain to the bare side substitutions is also expected in other D–A conjugated systems, as well as the attempt of more available additives with relatively low boiling points.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
Acceptor materials PC71BM and ITIC were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. All solvents and reagents were purchased from Alfa Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, and were utilized directly unless stated otherwise. 2BrBDD was prepared according to the previous report.49 BDT-1 or BDT-2 was obtained in our previous work.36
The synthetic procedure of P1 and P2
2BrBDD (0.12 mmol, 92.0 mg) and BDT-1 (0.12 mmol, 99.9 mg) or BDT-2 (0.12 mmol, 115.3 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of dry toluene (8.7 mL) and DMF (0.55 mL). The solution was purged with Ar for 30 minutes, then Pd(PPh3)4 (0.015 mmol, 17.3 mg) was added and the solution was purged with Ar for another 30 minutes. The reaction was stirred at 110 °C for 8 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting mixture was poured into methanol under stirring. The precipitates were filtered off and subjected to Soxhlet extraction successively with methanol, acetone and hexane and dichloromethane for the removal of remaining monomers, oligomers and catalytic impurities. The residue was re-dissolved in 25 mL of hot o-DCB (80 °C) and filtered to remove insoluble residue. The filtrate was then precipitated against methanol; the precipitates were filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight to obtain the polymers. P1 was collected as a purple-blue solid (114 mg, yield: 85%). Mn (GPC, TCB, 150 °C) = 55.8 kD, PDI = 2.03. Decomposition temperature (N2, 5% weight loss): 433 °C.
