    , Accepted 21st April 2023First published on 24th April 2023AbstractTheoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) are employed to investigate a series of polyoxometalate (POM)-based dyes by adopting different molecular design strategies, such as the introduction of a second donor or a change in π linker units. The π linker effects of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives such as BODIPY-dihydrofuran (BODIPY-F) and BODIPY-dihydrothiophene (BODIPY-T) were analyzed to understand their photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties. Compared to dye 1 with one triphenylamine donor, dye 2 with two triphenylamine donor groups has better harvest sunlight ability due to the broader absorption spectra. Dye 4 with the BODIPY-T π linker not only exhibits the broadest absorption spectra, largest ICT parameters due to the smallest aromaticity of BODIPY-T, largest short-circuit photocurrent density governed by the driving force for electron injection, and the largest open-circuit photovoltage connected with the electron recombination process and the energy shift of the conduction band (CB) among dyes 1–4, but also possesses the lowest interaction energy for the most stable dimer configuration resulting from the weakest van der Waals interaction, which can reduce dye aggregation. Dyes 1–4 attached to the TiO2 (101) surface were modeled to estimate the interfacial electron transfer performance of DSSCs, and dyes 2–4 could quickly inject electrons into the semiconductor CB. The qualitative structure photovoltaic property relationship thus obtained may serve as a guide to tailor-design various properties of POM-based dyes for application in DSSC devices.
1. Introduction
Global energy demand is increasing rapidly with technology growth. To solve the alarming environmental impact of fossil fuels, energy production from renewable resources is a prominent solution.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), first reported by the Grätzel group, can convert solar energy into electricity,2 which has been a hot topic due to their low fabrication cost and high cell performance.3,4 Currently, a record efficiency of 14% has been achieved by DSSCs cophosensitized with dyes ADEKA-1 and LEG4, while the efficiency still lags behind that of Si-based solar cells (25%).5 Panchromatic absorption, tapping the IR region of the sun spectrum along with the entire visible region, is an effective way to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs. Boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) can be used as strong absorption dyes owing to their easy structural modification, strong absorption in the visible region, excellent photochemical stability, and high fluorescence quantum yield.6–8 Thus, intense research on the molecular engineering of BODIPY to optimize its optical and electrochemical properties and to further improve the photoelectric conversion capability of dyes is proceeding owing to the versatility of BODIPY. The first batch of BODIPY-based DSSCs with low PCEs of 0.13–0.16% was reported by Fukuzumi et al. in 2005.6 Akkaya et al. improved the PCE by developing a series of 3,5,8-trisubstituted BODIPY-based dyes, and the best PCE was 2.46%.9–12 Afterward, a record PCE of 6.4% was achieved by inserting thiophene between BODIPY and the acceptor.13 Although BODIPY-based dyes have been extensively investigated by researchers, the low PCE below 10% limits their practical application, so there are still possibilities to improve the performance of DSSCs.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), discrete metal-oxo clusters, have been widely applied in catalysis, medicine science and analytical chemistry due to their fascinating structural and photophysical properties.14–20 Recently, POMs have been considered to be important inorganic ligands that are able to attach organic molecules, constructing inorganic–organic hybrids. The maximum absorption bands of hybrids significantly redshift compared with individual POMs and organic groups, resulting from the synergistic effect,21 which meets the requirement of long wavelength absorbed dyes.
The donor–π linker–acceptor (D–π–A) structure has been extensively investigated for tailoring dyes due to synthetic flexibility in the structural design and the efficient intramolecular charge transition (ICT) under photoirradiation. The donor part of dyes can be modified to broaden the absorption spectrum, resist dye aggregation and reduce the charge recombination effect. In addition, π linkers connecting donor and acceptor groups can be effectively used to design the electronic and photochemical properties of dyes. In this work, strategies such as incorporation of extra donors and modification of π linkers have been used to improve the performance of DSSCs, and we want to answer these questions: how does the increased donor affect the performance of DSSCs? Which π linker can exhibit the best structural and optical properties? Thus, a series of POM-based dyes with single or double electron donors and different π linkers were designed and compared to solve the disadvantage of BODIPY molecules with narrow spectral ranges. The geometrical structures, electronic properties, absorption spectra, ICT parameters and aromaticity of isolated dyes were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The structures of dye/(TiO2)48 systems and electron transfer characteristics of dyes at the TiO2 interface as well as the key parameters related to PCE, including short circuit current (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC), were predicted to evaluate the overall performance of DSSCs and to develop excellent photoelectric materials.
2. Computation details
All the isolated dyes were calculated with DFT and TD-DFT by means of the Gaussian 09 D01 package.22 The ground-state structures of all POM-based dyes were fully optimized using a B3LYP23 hybrid functional along with LANL2DZ for Mo atoms and a 6-31G(d) basis set for other atoms. The polarizable continuum model (PCM)24,25 with acetonitrile as the solvent was taken into account for the solvent effect. The long-range corrected hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP functional provides an excellent description of the charge-transfer excitations,26–28 and the absorption spectra of BODIPY dye 31 simulated by CAM-B3LYP29 (388 nm) are in good agreement with the experimental value (367 nm).30 Under the ground-state structures, the absorption spectra of the studied dyes were simulated by TD-DFT computations at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level using Gaussian functions with full width at half maximum of 0.20 eV. To investigate the charge recombination dynamics, we optimized the dye–I2 systems under the M06-2X/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level, which is linked via weak interactions. M06-2X31 has good performance for the description of noncovalent interactions.32 At the same time, the basis set superposition error (BSSE) to binding energies for the dye–I2 system interactions was determined with the counterpoise method.33 To evaluate the dye aggregation effect, 50 dimers for each dye generated by Molclus software34 were adopted as initial configurations for optimization at the B3LYP/3-21G level using the Gaussian 09 D01 package. Na+ as the counterion to eliminate the negative charge effect was introduced in the most stable dimer structures, which were further optimized under the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level, and the D3 dispersion correction was considered.35 The interaction energies of dimers were calculated. In addition, reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis36 was performed by means of the Multiwfn program.37
The photovoltaic properties of DSSCs strongly depend on the orientation of dyes on the surface of TiO2 and the reconstructions of the TiO2 surface owing to dye attachment. The (TiO2)48 cluster was used to simulate the semiconductor surface as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† the reliability of which has been proven,33 and the bridged bidentate geometric structures of dye/(TiO2)48 systems were calculated by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional38,39 of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)40 with the double numerical polarization (DNP) basis set in Dmol3 software.41 Based on the optimized geometries of dye/(TiO2)48 systems, the total density of state (TDOS) of pure TiO2 and partial DOS (PDOS) of TiO2 in the dye/(TiO2)48 systems were obtained to evaluate the conduction band energy shift (ΔECB). To quantitatively evaluate the interfacial electron transfer (IET) rate, semiclassical quantum dynamics simulations were applied for the dye/(TiO2)48 system-based semiempirical extended Hückel theory method,42,43 which has been widely applied to investigate photoinduced electron transfer across TiO2 semiconductor interfaces,44 and the details can be found in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structures
As mentioned above, modifying the molecular structures is an effective way to design excellent dyes with broad absorption. First, single or double triphenylamine groups are selected as electron donors to evaluate the donor effect based on POM dyes containing BODIPY π linkers and carboxylic acid acceptor groups, which are labeled dyes 1 and 2, respectively. Then, BODIPY-dihydrofuran (BODIPY-F) and BODIPY-dihydrothiophene (BODIPY-T) as π linkers between the donor and POM moiety are successively introduced into the dye 2 molecule, named dyes 3 and 4, respectively. The molecular structures of dyes 1–4 are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of studied dyes. 
3.2. Electronic structures
It is well known that the extrinsic properties of dyes are closely related to their inherent electronic structures, and particularly, the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital LUMO have underlying influences on the electronic-transfer characteristics and spectral properties of dye molecules. A narrow HOMO–LUMO gap (H–L gap) is beneficial to the ICT process and broad absorption spectra. The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels are shown in Fig. 2. The LUMO levels of all studied dyes lie above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (–4.00 eV), guaranteeing an efficient thermodynamic driving force for electron injection from excited dyes to the semiconductor, whereas their HOMO levels are lower than the I−/I3− redox potential of the electrolyte (–4.60 eV),45 contributing to efficient dye regeneration.
 Fig. 2  Frontier molecular orbital energy levels of studied dyes. 
For dye 1, the HOMO electron densities are localized on the triphenylamine donor and BODIPY group, and the LUMO electron densities disperse to the whole molecule (Fig. S1, ESI†), while the HOMO distributions of dyes 2–4 delocalize over the two donors, and BODIPY and LUMOs localize on POM, leading to a significantly increased HOMO and slightly decreased LUMO energies. The apparent push–pull characters in dyes 2–4 are beneficial to transfer the photoexcited electron from donor to acceptor groups and reduce the recombination of electrons and holes. In addition, the H–L gaps increase as follows: dye 4 < dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1, indicating that dye 4 with the smallest energy gap (1.32 eV) can lead to more excited electrons and thus better light absorption.
3.3. Absorption spectra
Apart from the band gap itself, the computational prediction of absorption spectra above the band gap is also highly relevant to the solar cell performance, and the central task of absorption spectra is as wide as possible. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1 (ESI†), dye 1 mainly exhibits two peaks: one is located in the range of 400–500 nm, denoted as the H–1 → L transition, and the other is located in the range of 500–700 nm, attributed to the H → L transition, while the absorption spectra of dyes 2–4 are in the ranges of 450–600 nm and 600–900 nm, indicating that introduction of the second donor group significantly redshifts the absorption spectra. Moreover, the maximum absorption bands of dyes 2–4 are in the order 2 (703 nm) < 3 (746 nm) < 4 (786 nm), confirming that the BODIPY-T π linker in dye 4 contributes to harvesting sunlight.

3.4. Intramolecular charge transfer analysis
Intramolecular electron transfer can be effectively promoted by enhancing the push–pull effect of molecules. As shown in Fig. 4, the holes of all studied dyes mainly localize on electron donor groups, while the electrons are mainly distributed on π linkers and POMs. The overlap between holes and electrons in dye 4 is the smallest, which is beneficial for efficient electron transfer. To assess the push–pull properties of dyes, the ICT parameters were calculated and are displayed in Fig. 5 (the computational details can be found in ESI†). The amount of transferred charges qCT increase was as follows: dye 1 = dye 2 < dye 3 = dye 4, and the corresponding effective charge transfer distance dCT followed the order of dye 2 < dye 3 < dye 1 < dye 4, while the t values increased as follows: dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1 < dye 4, confirming that the spatial charge separation and charge transfer character can be regulated by increasing donor groups and altering π linkers. It is apparent that dye 4 possesses the largest qCT (0.96 a.u.), dCT (4.86 Å) and largest t value (–0.02 Å) among dyes 1–4, indicating that dye 4 not only contributes to light absorption but also improves the ICT process.

3.5. Aromaticity
Understanding the physical observables in terms of aromaticity, which is one of the most fundamental concepts in heterocyclic chemistry, has been applied to dye research to reveal possible electron distribution and transfer pathways.46–48 Zhang et al. showed that the extent of charge delocalization in D–π–A systems can be increased by decreasing the aromaticity of π linkers.49 In this work, the aromaticity of π linkers in all studied dyes was estimated by virtue of the electron delocalization degree with the n-th root of the multicenter bond index (MCI1/n) based on the clockwise direction,50 and the MCI1/n values are calculated by Multiwfn and plotted in Fig. 6. Based upon the structures of dyes 1 and 2 with BODIPY, two π linkers, BODIPY-F and BODIPY-T, are introduced into dyes 3 and 4, respectively. The aromaticity values follow the order of BODIPY-F ≈ BODIPY-T > BODIPY, suggesting that there is a stronger tendency of electron delocalization in BODIPY-F and BODIPY-T than in BODIPY. Thus, it is plausible that dyes 3 and 4 may have better electron delocalization characteristics than dyes 1 and 2.

3.6. Dye aggregation effects
Dyes commonly suffer from aggregation, which is disadvantageous to electron injection, and thus decrease the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Dimer configurations of dyes were studied to explore the possibility of dye aggregation, and the most stable dimer configurations upon optimization as well as interaction energies ΔEtot for dyes 1–4 are displayed in Fig. 7.

As can be seen from the Fig. S3 in ESI,† the red and blue parts of the van der Waals surface penetrate each other in the dimer interaction regions, reflecting the complementary characteristic of electrostatic potential and the nature of dimers interaction. As shown in Fig. 8, the plots of ρ(r) multiplied by the sign of λ2versus RDG for the dimers of dyes 1–4 were created to gain more insight into the nature of the interactions, and the gradient isosurfaces with RDG = 0.5 a.u. The hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and steric repulsions are denoted as blue, green and red areas, respectively. The weak interactions on isosurfaces for dimers of dyes 2–4 are attributed to van der Waals interactions. Dye 4 possesses the smallest ΔEtot (–7.00 kcal mol−1) among dyes 1–4, resulting from the weakest van der Waals interactions, suppressing the dye aggregation process.

3.7. Factors influencing JSC
Injection of electrons from excited state dyes into the CB of the semiconductor gives rise to the photovoltage, and the consequent flow of electrons in the external circuit is called the photocurrent. Thus, the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinj) is one of the key parameters that has a direct impact on the performance of DSSCs. Dyes 1–4 all have negative ΔGinj values, implying efficient electron injection from dyes into the surface of TiO2. In addition to negative ΔGinj, the large LHE combined with small |ΔGinj + χ| can guarantee a high JSC according to the discussion in ESI.† LHE values for dyes 1–4 are in the order 1 (0.90) < 2 (0.95) = 4 (0.95) < 3 (0.97), and the values of |ΔGinj + χ| are in the order 3 (0.14) < 4 (0.17) < 1 (0.25) < 2 (0.27), indicating that dyes 3 and 4 can lead to a higher JSC due to the larger LHE and smaller |ΔGinj + χ| values (Table 1).

3.8. Factors influencing VOC
We constructed adsorption models of dyes on the surface of (TiO2)48 to better understand the interaction between dyes and semiconductors. The TDOS and PDOS for dye/(TiO2)48 systems were calculated and are presented in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface shift the CB of TiO2 toward a more negative direction with respect to the CB edge of pristine TiO2. In other words, dyes absorbed on the TiO2 surface induce ΔECB and thus further change the VOC of DSSCs. The ΔECB increases in the following order: dye 3 (0.144 eV) = dye 4 (0.144 eV) < dye 2 (0.149 eV) < dye 1 (0.152 eV), indicating that dyes 3 and 4 may obtain superior VOC.

Electron recombination is an important negative item resulting in the reduction of VOC, as it could minify the electron number in CB (nc),51,52 including the recombination between injected electrons in TiO2 with oxidized dyes and redox couples in the electrolyte. In particular, recombination between injected electrons and redox couples is the dominant recombination route.53 The special atoms in dyes, such as O and S atoms, could provide sites for dye–I2 interactions through noncovalent bonding.54 The interaction energies described in Fig. 10 indicate that the bridging oxygen atoms Ob in POMs are the main sites due to the much larger interaction energies for the studied dyes, reducing the iodine concentration in the vicinity of the semiconductor and suppressing charge recombination. At the same time, more sites in dye 4 mean a greater probability of interacting with I2, resulting in the lowest iodine concentration in the vicinity of the semiconductor and the largest nc. In short, dye 4 can obtain the largest VOC due to the smallest ΔECB and largest nc.

3.9. Interfacial electron transfer analysis
The time-dependent survival probability (TDSP) curves of dyes 1–4 for electron injection from dyes to semiconductors are employed to investigate the IET performances of DSSCs, which are affected by donor groups and π linkers (the computational details can be found in ESI†). These curves are illustrated in Fig. 11. Clearly, the photoexcited electrons concentrate on the dyes' LUMO at the beginning. After 500 fs, the electrons are injected into the semiconductor for dyes 2–4, while it will take a long time for dye 1, indicating that the increased donor could help electron transfer to the semiconducting layer. Moreover, the IET process from dye 3 to the TiO2 layer is faster than that of dyes 2 and 4. This certainly means that the BODIPY-F π linker in dye 3 could establish a better channel for electron injection; thus, dye 3 could indeed improve the electron injection process in this way, which will improve the efficiency of DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
Four POM-based dyes were investigated using DFT and TD-DFT calculations to understand their photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties. In addition to electronic properties, absorption spectra and ICT processes, the key factors affecting JSC and VOC as major factors affecting the performance of DSSCs have been taken into consideration. Dye 2 exhibits a narrower band gap and broader spectral response range than dye 1 because of the insertion of the triphenylamine donor. Moreover, dye 4 with a BODIPY-T π linker not only possesses the broadest absorption spectra, largest ICT parameters, the smallest ΔECB and the largest nc among dyes 1–4 but also reduces the dye aggregation due to the lowest interaction energy for the most stable dimer configuration, indicating that BODIPY-T can be a promising π linker for high-performance POM-based dyes used in DSSCs. In addition, from the discussion of dyes adsorbed on TiO2, these dye molecules can effectively inject electrons into the semiconductor CB. In particular, the BODIPY-F π linker in dye 3 could establish the best channel for electron injection.
