    , Accepted 11th September 2012First published on 4th October 2012AbstractThermal reactions of [60]fullerene with a series of amino acids and amino acid esters under aerobic and dark conditions have been investigated. Fulleropyrrolidines can be obtained from these reactions although an aldehyde is not added purposely. Possible reaction mechanisms involving uncommon C–N bond cleavages have been proposed to generate aldehydes, which then react with amino acids and amino acid esters to provide azomethine ylides, followed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to [60]fullerene affording fulleropyrrolidines. Control experiments support our proposed mechanisms, and elucidate the innate nature of C–N bond cleavages of amino acids and amino acid esters.
Introduction
Many years have elapsed since the discovery of fullerenes, but their chemical modifications continue to be of great appeal due to the potential applications of fullerene derivatives in many fields of life and materials sciences.1 Amino acids and their derivatives are important biological molecules. They have been utilized to functionalize [60]fullerene (C60) via the Prato reaction, i.e., 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to C60.2 Azomethine ylides are generated in situ from the decarboxylation of iminium salts derived from the condensation of amino acids with aldehydes/ketones or from the formal 1,2-H shift of imines of amino acid esters. The formed fulleropyrrolidine derivatives have recently been employed as the acceptors of photovoltaic solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 3.44% and are superior to methyl [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butylate ([C60]-PCBM) under the same conditions.3 Fulleropyrrolidines can also be further transformed to ionic fullerene derivatives and applied to supramolecular assemblies.1d
Compared to the extensive application of amino acids and their derivatives in the Prato reaction, much fewer reports on the functionalization of C60 using amino acids or amino acid esters alone have been described. Gan's group and others have disclosed a few photochemical reactions between amino acid esters and C60.4 Gan and co-workers have also investigated the reactions of amino acid esters with C60 in the presence of iodo reagents under ultrasonification.5 We have explored the reaction of C60 with amino acid ester hydrochlorides by using triethylamine (Et3N) as a base to remove HCl.6,7 We found that the reaction in CS2 at room temperature proceeded well and afforded fullerene products containing amino acid ester, thioamide and thiourea units.6 In contrast, the reaction in refluxing o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) gave fulleropyrrolidine derivatives containing the CH3CH moiety originated from an unusual C–N bond cleavage of Et3N. The fulleropyrrolidines were formed through the reaction of C60 with azomethine ylides from amino acids and acetaldehyde, which in turn were generated by the hydrolysis of the amino acid ester hydrochlorides in the presence of Et3N and by the fragmentation/oxidization of Et3N, respectively.7 On the other hand, studies on the direct thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids themselves are scarce. Gan and co-workers investigated the reaction of C60 with glycine or alanine in the presence of sodium hydroxide and obtained complex mixtures of multiadducts.8 Herein, we report the direct thermal reactions of C60 with a series of amino acids and amino acid esters in the absence of an aldehyde and under aerobic and dark conditions affording isolable monoadducts.9,10 More importantly, we have gained a mechanistic insight into these reactions deduced from the structural motifs of isolated products and control experiments.
Results and discussion
In our preliminary communication,10 we reported the thermal reaction of C60 with a few amino acids. In order to extend the substrate scope and better understand the reaction mechanism, we have extended the thermal reaction of C60 with more amino acids as well as that with amino acid esters. In contrast to the previous experimental procedure,10 and for rational comparison amongst the reactions of C60 with different amino acids and amino acid esters, the concentration of C60 was kept constant; a sealed tube instead of a conventional flask was used for the reaction to prevent any loss of the volatile starting materials or in situ generated intermediates; the reaction temperature was 180 °C and 10 equiv. of amino acid/amino acid ester were used in most cases.
We first systematically explored the thermal reaction of C60 with representative N-unsubstituted amino acids, that is, glycine (1a), alanine (1b), phenylalanine (1c) and phenylglycine (1d). Among the employed N-unsubstituted amino acids, 1a–1c are naturally occurring amino acids. To avoid the potential interference of a photochemical reaction,4 the thermal reaction of C60 was conducted under dark conditions. Intriguingly, the products from the thermal reaction of C60 with 1a–1d in refluxing ODCB in the presence of air proved to be N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines 2a–2d, instead of aminated fullerene derivatives.8 It was found that the presence of oxygen was crucial for the thermal reaction, as strict exclusion of oxygen from the reaction mixture by a freeze–pump–thaw procedure failed to provide 2a–2d.11 The reaction conditions and product yields for the reaction of C60 with 1a–1d are listed in Table 1. It should be pointed out that the reactions with both glycine and alanine were much more sluggish and required higher temperature than those with phenylalanine and phenylglycine, probably due to the lower solubility of the former two amino acids.

Products 2a–2d are known compounds, and their identities were confirmed by comparison of their spectra with those reported in the literature.12–14 The structures of adducts 2a–2d are the same as those of products formed by the Prato reaction of C60, 1a–1d and the aldehydes generated in situ from 1a–1dvia the apparent elimination of the COOH and NH2 groups. It should be noted that there are trans and cis isomers depending on the different orientation of the two R substituents when R ≠ H. Products 2b and 2c existed as a mixture of trans and cis isomers while product 2d consisted of only the cis isomer. The exact same phenomenon was also observed for the corresponding Prato reactions.13
Secondly, typical N-substituted amino acids, i.e., N-methylglycine (sarcosine) (3a), N-ethylglycine (3b), N-benzylglycine (3c) and N-phenylglycine (3d), were chosen to react with C60 in refluxing ODCB under aerobic and dark conditions. The reaction of C60 with 3b and 3c afforded two types (4b, 5b and 4c, 5c) of monoadducts, whereas that with 3a and 3d provided only one type (4a and 4d) of monoadducts. The reaction conditions and product yields for the reaction of C60 with 3a–3d are listed in Table 2.

Adducts 4a–4d, 5b and 5c also prove to be fulleropyrrolidines. Among them, products 4a,124b,154c16 and 5c17 are known compounds, and their structures are confirmed by comparison of their spectral data with those reported previously. The HRMS spectra of 4d and 5b showed correct molecular ions. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4d exhibited the signals for a phenyl group and a singlet at 5.14 ppm for the two methylene groups. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4d displayed 16 lines for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 skeleton along with a peak at 69.23 ppm for the two sp3-carbons of the C60 core, consistent with its C2v molecular symmetry. The 1H NMR spectrum of 5b gave two doublets at 4.88 and 3.98 ppm with JAB = 9.2 Hz for the CH2 group attached to the fullerene cage, two double quartets at 3.50 (J = 12.0, 7.4 Hz) and 2.73 (J = 12.0, 7.0 Hz) ppm, a triplet at 1.53 ppm (J = 7.2 Hz) for the ethyl group, a quartet at 4.02 ppm (J = 6.3 Hz), and a doublet at 1.95 ppm (J = 6.3 Hz) for the CHCH3 moiety. The 13C NMR spectrum of 5b revealed 49 peaks in the 136–157 ppm range for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 cage and two peaks at 75.89 and 69.20 ppm for the two sp3-carbons of the C60 skeleton, consistent with its C1 molecular symmetry. Adducts 4a–4d appeared to be the Prato reaction products of C60, 3 and CH2O generated in situ from 3 through the apparent extrusion of the COOH and RNH moieties. Meanwhile, 5b and 5c might be similarly formed by the reaction of C60 with 3 and R′CHO (when R = R′CH2), which was produced via an oxidative cleavage of the R′CH2–N bond of 3.
Finally, the corresponding N-substituted amino acid esters including sarcosine ethyl ester (6a), N-ethylglycine ethyl ester (6b), N-benzylglycine ethyl ester (6c) and N-phenylglycine ethyl ester (6d) were allowed to react with C60 under the same conditions as for N-substituted amino acids. Although 6c and 6d were commercially available, 6a and 6b were supplied as hydrochlorides. The in situ generation of 6a and 6b from their hydrochlorides in the presence of Et3N during the reaction with C60 may cause hydrolysis of the amino acid ester hydrochlorides.7 Therefore, 6a and 6b were prepared by the neutralization of sarcosine ethyl ester hydrochloride and N-ethylglycine ethyl ester hydrochloride with dilute aqueous solution of K2CO3 prior to use. The reaction conditions and product yields for the reaction of C60 with 6a–d are listed in Table 3.

All adducts 7–10 were identified as fulleropyrrolidines. Among them, products 7a,178a,4a94a,17 and 10c18 are known compounds, and their structures are substantiated by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature. Compounds 7b, 7c, 7d, 8b and 8c exhibited correct molecular weights in their high-resolution mass spectra and the expected chemical shifts as well as the splitting patterns for all protons in their 1H NMR spectra. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 7b–7d, there were no more than 28 peaks in the 135–154 ppm range for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 cage and one peak at ∼71 ppm for the two sp3-carbons of the C60 skeleton, consistent with their C2 molecular symmetry. In comparison, 51 lines in the range of 136–157 ppm for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 cage along with two lines at ca. 71 and 75/76 ppm for the two sp3-carbons of the C60 skeleton were observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8b and 8c, agreeing with their C1 molecular symmetry.
The reaction of C60 with amino acid esters was much more complex than that with the corresponding amino acids. Adducts 7 and 8 could be envisioned as the products from the reaction of C60 with 6 and aldehydes (EtO2CCHO and R′CHO when R = R′CH2), which were produced from apparent C–N oxidative cleavages of RNH–CH2CO2Et and R′CH2–NHCH2CO2Et (when R = R′CH2), respectively. Meanwhile, 9 and 10 might be formed from the reaction of C60 with the in situ generated aldehydes and NH2CH2CO2Et.
Primary and secondary amines can react with C60 thermally to give aminated products.8,19 At first glance, it was surprising that fulleropyrrolidines were obtained from the direct thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids or amino acid esters in the absence of a purposely added aldehyde under aerobic and dark conditions. Although the exact pathways for the observed products from the thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids 1 and 3 as well as amino acid esters 6 remain to be clarified, structural motifs of the isolated products were sufficient to allow us to deduce the plausible reaction mechanisms (Schemes 1–3). The mechanisms for the formation of all potential intermediates involving C–N bond cleavages of amino acids and amino acid esters are generalized in Schemes 1 and 2, and the subsequent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions with C60 affording fulleropyrrolidines are shown in Scheme 3.

 Scheme 3  1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition reactions with C60 affording fulleropyrrolidines. 
Electron transfer from amino acids/amino acid esters to C60 gives cation radical A and anion radical C60−˙ (step i),7,19 the latter transfers an electron to O2 to afford O2−˙ and regenerate C60 (step ii).20 Hydrogen abstraction at the α-carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group of A by O2−˙ produces iminium cation B and HO2− (step iii),4,7 subsequent proton transfer provides imine C and H2O2 (step iv). Under heating conditions, H2O2 can decompose to H2O and O2. Hydrolysis of C generates amine D and carbonyl compound E (step v).7,21 When R3 = H in E, it eliminates CO2 to give aldehyde F upon heating (step vi).22 Meanwhile, hydrogen abstraction at the α-carbon adjacent to R4 (when R1 = R4CH2) of A by O2−˙ attains iminium cation G and HO2− (step vii). Proton transfer from G to HO2− furnishes imine H and H2O2 (step viii), subsequent hydrolysis of H produces aldehyde I and amino acid/amino acid ester J (step ix).7,21
An alternative pathway leading to the formation of aldehydes R2CHO (F) from amino acids is shown in Scheme 2. Electron transfer from a zwittionic amino acid to C60 affords the cationic radical K and C60−˙ (step x),4b followed by the same step ii to form O2−˙ and regenerate C60 (step ii). Proton transfer from K to O2−˙ furnishes radical L and HO2˙ (step xi). Loss of CO2 from L gives radical M (step xii),23 from which a hydrogen abstraction by HO2˙ provides imine N (step xiii). Hydrolysis of imine N produces amine R1NH2 (D) and R2CHO (F) (step xiv).7,21
For amino acids 1a–1d, R1 = R3 = H, R2 = R, aldehyde RCHO (F′) is generated through steps i–vi and/or steps x–xiv. The 1,3-dipolar reaction of C60 with 1a–1d and aldehyde F′ leads to fulleropyrrolidines 2a–2d (step xv). We previously found that the cis/trans isomeric ratio of 2b and 2c was heavily dependent on the reaction conditions.13 The reaction of C60 with 1b and acetaldehyde in refluxing toluene (110 °C) for 27 h led to 21% of trans-2b and 5% of cis-2b, and the isolated isomeric mixture of 2b was then heated in refluxing ODCB (180 °C) for 12 h to afford a mixture dominated by the cis isomer.13 The direct reaction of C60 with 1b at 200 °C for 2 d gave cis-2b as the major product (Table 1, entry 2). When the same reaction was conducted at lower temperature (180 °C for 4 d), trans-2b and cis-2b were obtained in 8% and 6% yields, respectively. A similar behavior was also observed for the reaction with 1c. Thus, a higher reaction temperature tended to give a higher cis/trans isomeric ratio in our current cases. These experimental results support the above proposed mechanisms for the formation of aldehydes from amino acids, followed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with C60 to produce fulleropyrrolidines.13
For amino acids 3a–3d, R1 = R, R2 = R3 = H, formaldehyde CH2O is formed via steps i–vi and/or steps x–xiv, while aldehyde R′CHO (CH2O, CH3CHO and PhCHO for 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively) can be produced through steps vii–ix when R = R′CH2. The cycloaddition reaction of C60 with 3a–3d and CH2O gives 4a–4d (step xvi), while the reaction of C60 with 3a–3c and R′CHO provides 5a–5c (step xvii). In the case of 3a, product 5a was the same as adduct 4a. Therefore, more pathways leading to 4a may operate simultaneously. Similar steps vii–ix are impossible for 3d, of which the phenyl group is directly attached to the nitrogen atom. As a result, the thermal reaction of C60 with 3d afforded 4d only. It should be noted that it was possible for H2NCH2COOH to react with CH2O/R′CHO and C60 to give the corresponding N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines. However, no more than a trace amount of, if any, N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines could be isolated from the thermal reaction of C60 with 3a–3d because the in situ generated CH2O and R′CHO (I′) preferred to react with a large excess of amino acids 3a–3d rather than the relatively small amount of the in situ formed H2NCH2COOH to furnish an azomethine ylide, which then underwent [2 + 3] cycloaddition reaction with C60 to provide 4a–4d and 5b–5c, respectively.
For amino acid esters 6a–6d, R1 = R, R2 = H, R3 = Et, EtO2CCHO (E′) and R′CHO (I′, when R = R′CH2) were obtained via steps i–v and vii–ix, respectively. Substrate 6d bearing the Ph–N moiety cannot undergo steps vii–ix, and thus is unable to produce the corresponding R′CHO (I′) and NH2CH2CO2Et (J′). The reaction of C60 with 6a–6d and E′ affords 7a–7d (step xviii), and that with 6a–6c and I′ furnishes 8a–8c (step xix). For 6a–6c, C60 can react with the in situ generated J′ and EtO2CCHO or R′CHO to provide 9 or 10 (steps xx and xxi), respectively. As expected, 9 was indeed obtained in all cases of 6a–6c. However, only 10c could be isolated because much more benzaldehyde and J′ from 6c might be produced than aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) and J′ from 6a and 6b (vide infra).
To better understand the product distribution for the thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids or amino acid esters, we performed additional experiments. Control experiments showed that the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of 3a, 1 equiv. of NH2CH2CO2H and 1 equiv. of CH2O at 180 °C for 7 min gave 4a in 18% yield along with only a trace amount of 2a (Scheme 4). In comparison, the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of 3c, 1 equiv. of NH2CH2CO2H and 1 equiv. of CH2O at 180 °C for 7 min afforded 4c in 16% yield together with a very small amount of 2a (Scheme 5); meanwhile the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of 3c, 1 equiv. of NH2CH2CO2H and 1 equiv. of PhCHO at 180 °C for 7 min afforded 5c in 27% yield along with a trace amount of the corresponding N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidine (Scheme 6). These experiments indicated that the reactivity of N-substituted glycine was higher than that of glycine. Therefore, it is understandable that we could not identify the N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines from the reaction of C60 with 3a–3d after taking into account the very small amount of the in situ generated glycine relative to that of 3a–3d.

It was reported that fulleropyrrolidine 4a was unexpectedly formed from the reaction of C60 with sarcosine and gossypol.24 Product 4a was also obtained from the reaction of C60 with sarcosine and 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde25a or hydroxyacetaldehyde.25b However, the authors did not provide any explanation of how 4a was produced in their cases. Our current work shows that 4a can be formed directly from the reaction of C60 with sarcosine via the aforementioned mechanisms, thus elucidating the origin for the formation of 4a reported in the literature.24,25 Control experiments showed that the reaction of C60 with 2 equiv. of 3a under typical Prato reaction conditions (refluxing toluene, 2 h) afforded only a trace amount of 4a. The same reaction in refluxing chlorobenzene for 2 h still gave a very small amount of 4a. However, when the reaction time was prolonged to 48 h, as in the reaction of C60 with sarcosine and hydroxyacetaldehyde,25b4a was obtained in 20% yield along with 78% of unreacted C60. These results suggest that although the formation of fulleropyrrolidines from the direct reaction of C60 with amino acids under typical Prato reaction conditions is negligible, a significant amount of fulleropyrrolidines can be generated at high reaction temperature and long reaction time.
It is obvious from the above results and discussion that both N-substituted glycines (R′CH2NHCH2CO2H) and N-substituted glycine esters (R′CH2NHCH2CO2Et) could undergo C–N bond cleavage at either side of the NH group. To further explore the innate nature of the C–N bond cleavage and product distribution, we have conducted additional control experiments. We found that the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of CH3CH2NHCH2CO2H (3b), 1 equiv. of CH2O and 1 equiv. of CH3CHO at 180 °C for 6 min produced 4b and 5b in 23% and 8% yields, respectively (Scheme 7). The product ratio of 4b/5b was 3:1 and happened to be the same as that from the direct thermal reaction of C60 with 3b (Table 2, entry 2), suggesting that the same molar amount of CH2O and CH3CHO was generated from 3b. In comparison, the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of CH3CH2NHCH2CO2Et (6b), 1 equiv. of EtO2CCHO and 1 equiv. of CH3CHO at 180 °C for 10 min produced 7b and 8b in 38% and 3% yields, respectively (Scheme 8). Combined with the product yields (7b and 8b in 31% and 13% yields, respectively) for the thermal reaction of C60 with 6b (Table 3, entry 2), it could be deduced that EtO2CCHO and CH3CHO were generated in situ from 6b in a molar ratio of 1:5. Thus, the CH3CH2–NH bond was more easily to break via steps vii–ix in Scheme 1 than the NH–CH2CO2Et bond via steps i–v in Scheme 1. If 3b in its thermal reaction with C60 proceeded only via the same routes as 6b, it was expected that CH2O and CH3CHO should be formed also in a molar ratio of 1:5, in sharp contrast to the observed ratio of 1:1. Consequently, other routes, i.e., steps x–xiv, must operate and contribute to the formation of CH2O. The same processes shown in Scheme 2 should also occur for 1a–1d, 3a, 3c and 3d to provide the corresponding aldehydes.

On the other hand, the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of PhCH2NHCH2CO2H (3c), 1 equiv. of CH2O and 1 equiv. of PhCHO at 180 °C for 4 min afforded 4c in 22% yield together with a trace amount of 5c (Scheme 9), while the reaction of C60 with 1 equiv. of PhCH2NHCH2CO2Et (6c), 1 equiv. of EtO2CCHO and 1 equiv. of PhCHO at 180 °C for 3 min afforded 7c in 31% yield along with a trace amount of 8c (Scheme 10). The observation of 5c (23%) and 8c (10%) in the direct reaction of C60 with 3c and 6c (entry 3, Tables 2 and 3), respectively, suggested that the PhCH2–NH bond was much more facile to cleave than the NH–CH2CO2H and NH–CH2CO2Et bonds in substrates 3c and 6c, respectively, and thus provided significantly more PhCHO than CH2O (for 3c)/EtO2CCHO (for 6c). The reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction in step vii should follow the order of CH3–NH < CH3CH2–NH < PhCH2–NH. Therefore, more benzaldehyde is expected to form from 3c than acetaldehyde from 3b due to the more reactive benzylic position of the former. It is reasonable to assume that the amount of the in situ generated CH2O via steps i–vi is not strongly affected by the N-alkyl group of 3b and 3c. Consequently, the product ratio of 5c/4c is expected to be higher than that of 5b/4b, fully consistent with our experimental results (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). Similar to amino acids 3, the formation of EtO2CCHO via steps i–v is little affected by the N-alkyl group of 6, while the production of R′CHO via steps vii–ix should be more favorable for 6c than that for 6b, which in turn is more facile than for 6a, corroborating the observed product distribution of 8c/7c > 8b/7b > 8a/7a (see Table 3). In addition, product 10 was observed only in the case of 6c, further supporting that much more PhCHO from 6c was produced than CH2O from 6a and CH3CHO from 6b, respectively.

Conclusions
Fulleropyrrolidines are commonly obtained by the Prato reaction, i.e., the reaction of C60 with an amino acid or amino acid ester with an aldehyde. In the present work, we have demonstrated that the direct thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids or amino acid esters in refluxing ODCB without the purposely added aldehydes under aerobic and dark conditions can also afford fulleropyrrolidines. Plausible reaction mechanisms involving unusual C–N bond cleavages are proposed to explain the formation of intermediates from the employed amino acids and amino acid esters, and subsequent addition of the azomethine ylides to C60 furnishes fulleropyrrolidines. All isolated products from the reaction mixtures can be well explained by the proposed reaction mechanisms. Control experiments shed light on the innate nature of the C–N bond cleavages of amino acids and amino acid esters and support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Our current work also clarifies the origin of the unexpected formation of N-methylfulleropyrrolidine from the reaction of C60 with sarcosine and gossypol, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde or hydroxyacetaldehyde reported in the literature.
