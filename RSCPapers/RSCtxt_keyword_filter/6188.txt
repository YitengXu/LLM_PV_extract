    , Accepted 12th October 2020First published on 17th October 2020AbstractThe synthesis of novel polymer acceptors by polymerizing narrow-bandgap small molecule acceptors (SMAs) is an important strategy in the development of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Herein, a novel narrow-bandgap polymerized SMA (PSMA) PG1, based on a Y6-like building block of 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-dioctyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazo-lo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indo-le-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile copolymerized with a thienyl substituted benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) unit, was designed and synthesized. The PSMA PG1 shows a broad and strong absorption in the region of 550–900 nm with a narrow optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.42 eV, a high maximum extinction coefficient of 1.19 × 105 cm−1 and a high electron mobility of 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, benefiting from the narrow bandgap, strong absorption and high electron mobility of the SMA building blocks. Furthermore, PG1 shows an expected up-shift in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of −3.81 eV compared to the SMA building block, which is beneficial for achieving a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in all-PSCs. Upon processing with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive, the optimal all-PSC based on a blend of PBDB-T:PG1 achieved an outstanding PCE of 11.5% with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.8 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 and a low energy loss of 0.48 eV. These Voc and PCE values are among the highest of the all-PSCs reported to date. These results indicate that PG1 is a promising polymer acceptor for highly efficient all-PSCs.
Introduction
In the past few decades, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a p-type conjugated polymer (p-CP) as a donor and an n-type conjugated polymer (n-CP) as an acceptor in the active layer, have attracted tremendous research interest owing to their unique advantages of light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, excellent morphological stability and robust mechanical properties.1–12 To date, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an all-PSC has surpassed 14.0%.13 However, compared with the state-of-the-art, non-fullerene, small molecule acceptor (SMA)-based PSCs, the performance of all-PSCs still has a long way to go. The PCEs of all-PSCs are mainly limited by the development of high-performance n-CP acceptors. Therefore, the synthesis of novel, efficient n-CP acceptors is vital and urgent.
Up to now, a large number of n-CP acceptors based on perylene diimide (PDI),14–19 naphthalene diimide (NDI)20–23 and B → N-bridged bipyridine moieties24–27 have been developed for all-PSCs. Among them, the naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based copolymer, poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200), has been well studied due to its broad absorption and good electron mobility.28–34 Recently, Huang and Liu et al. increased the optimal efficiency of an N2200-based all-PSC up to 11.76%.6 However, N2200 suffers from some significant weaknesses, such as a poor absorption coefficient and excessively strong crystallinity and stacking, which lead to limited photocurrent and poor separation in the active layers.6,28,35–38 To overcome the unfavorable properties of N2200, Zhang et al. demonstrated a strategy of polymerizing SMAs, considering their advantages of narrow bandgap, strong absorption and higher electron mobility, and developed a polymerized SMA (PSMA), PZ1, in 2017. This PSMA polymer acceptor exhibited a broad absorption spectrum, a high absorption coefficient (1.3 × 105 cm−1) and promising photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 9.19% in an all-PSC with the polymer donor PBDB-T.39 By using PM6 as the donor, the PCE of the PZ1-based all-PSC was further improved to 11.2%.40
Based on this strategy, Yan and Zhang et al. developed two PSMA polymer acceptors, PFBDT-IDTIC and PN1, both of which yielded excellent photovoltaic performance with PCEs of over 10% in the corresponding all-PSCs.41,42 Recently, a novel PSMA (PJ1) based on a Y5-like SMA building block was developed by Huang et al. The polymer acceptor showed a high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) and achieved an impressive PCE of 14.4% in an all-PSC.13 Min and Zhou et al. also reported the PSMA polymer acceptors PYT and A701 from similar SMA building blocks, and the corresponding devices exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance.43,44 Du et al. developed a random ternary copolymerization strategy for further tuning the energy levels of PSMAs, and synthesized a series of PSMAs (PTPBT-ETx) based on a Y6-like SMA building block; the all-PSC based on PTPBT-ET0.3 as acceptor and PBDB-T as donor showed a high PCE of 12.52%.45 These results indicate that introducing the SMA segment into a polymer backbone is an effective and promising strategy for synthesizing high-performance polymer acceptors. Based on this strategy, herein, we designed and synthesized a new PSMA, PG1 (shown in Fig. 1), by copolymerizing the SMA segment M1 (Scheme S1 in the ESI†), which is similar to Y6, and a thienyl-substituted benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) unit.

The longer alkyl side chain in M1 is intended to improve the solubility of the PSMA. The embedding of M1 in PG1 is expected to preserve the merits of Y6, such as its narrow bandgap and high extinction coefficient. On the other hand, PG1 presents additional advantages, such as good film forming and processing properties, and long-range electron delocalization to reduce carrier recombination and tune photophysical properties from the copolymerized BDT-T unit. Therefore, PG1 exhibits a broad and strong absorption in the region of 550–900 nm, with a narrow optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.42 eV, a high maximum extinction coefficient of 1.19 × 105 cm−1, and a high electron mobility of 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, this PSMA exhibits ordered molecular packing and a preferential face-on orientation relative to the substrate. As a result, when the wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T was chosen as a donor material, the corresponding all-PSC exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.5% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.8 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 and a low energy loss of 0.48 eV.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of PG1 and PBDB-T are shown in Fig. 1a. Details of the synthesis of the monomer, polymerization, and characterizations are given in the Experimental Section in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PG1 were found to be 14.4 kDa and 2.0, respectively, which were obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 160 °C. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of PG1 revealed good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) above 341 °C under N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The thermal properties of PG1 were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry thermograms (DSC) presented in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† No obvious exothermic peak or endothermic peak was observed in the temperature range from room temperature to 280 °C.
Optical properties and electronic energy levels
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of PG1 in solution and film were measured to study its light-harvesting ability (Fig. 1a). In chloroform solution, PG1 shows a strong absorption from 300 to 900 nm. From solution to thin film, PG1 exhibits an extended absorption with red shifts of ca. 18 nm for the absorption peak, indicating the presence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state, which is helpful for improving charge transport in the film. Furthermore, the polymer in the film exhibited an extinction coefficient of 1.19 × 105 cm−1 (Fig. S3 in the ESI†), which is much higher than that of N2200 (0.3 × 105 cm−1).28 In addition, the PG1 film exhibited an absorption onset of about 875 nm, corresponding to a narrow optical bandgap of 1.42 eV. The polymer donor PBDB-T exhibited strong absorption in region from 450 to 650 nm, providing complementary absorption with PG1 to harvest more light and achieve a high Jsc in the corresponding device. The energy levels of PG1 and PBDB-T were then investigated using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV).46 As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the onset oxidation potentials (φox) of PG1 and PBDB-T are 0.95 V and 0.51 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively, while their onset reduction potentials (φred) are −0.90 V and −1.05 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Therefore, according to the equations47,48 HOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(φred + 4.71) (eV), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PG1 and PBDB-T are −5.66/−3.81 eV and −5.22/−3.66 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1c, the energy levels of PG1 and PBDB-T are well-matched with a ΔELUMO of 0.15 eV and a ΔEHOMO of 0.44 eV. The higher LUMO energy level of PG1 in comparison with N2200 (−4.12 eV)49 is beneficial for achieving a larger Voc in the devices.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of the PBDB-T:PG1-based all-PSCs was investigated using a conventional structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:PG1/zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs)/Al. Testing of the solar cells was performed under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The device performance was fully optimized in terms of processing additive, thermal annealing (TA) at different temperatures and donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratios, as shown in Fig. S5–S7 (ESI†), and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). The devices based on the optimal D:A weight ratio of 1.5:1 (w/w) obtained a moderate PCE of 7.5% with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.51. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the as-cast and the best-performance all-PSCs. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the as-cast device, the Voc, Jsc and FF of the device with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive are significantly improved (Fig. 2 and Table 1). With the addition of 4% CN, the Voc is improved from 0.87 V to 0.94 V, the Jsc is improved from 16.8 mA cm−2 to 17.8 mA cm−2, and the FF is dramatically increased from 0.51 to 0.69. As a result, the PCE is significantly enhanced from 7.5% to 11.5%. Furthermore, TA treatment was also performed, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†), and the device exhibited similar performance relative to the device without TA. Fig. S8 and Table S4 (ESI†) display the J–V curves and device parameters of the all-PSCs with 4% CN and different electron transporting layers (ETLs), including ZnO-NPs, PDIN, ZrAcac, NDIN, PFN, PFN-Br and PDINO. It was found that the device with ZnO NPs as the ETL showed better performance compared to devices with other ETLs. Notably, the PCEs of the PBDB-T:PG1-based all-PSCs were insensitive to the device area. As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S5 (ESI†), with the device area increased from 0.04 to 0.81 cm2, the devices show PCEs of over 10.6%. In addition, the PBDB-T:PG1-based all-PSCs still retained nearly 75% of the initial PCE value stored for 840 h in the N2-filled glovebox, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to confirm the Jsc of the all-PSCs, and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2b. It can be seen that both the devices without and with 4% CN treatment absorb light over a wide wavelength range of 300–900 nm. The EQE values of the device with 4% CN treatment are much higher than those of the as-cast device, across the range from 420 to 830 nm. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are 16.8 mA cm−2 and 17.8 mA cm−2 for the as-cast device and the device with 4% CN treatment, respectively, in agreement with the results obtained from the J–V measurements with a mismatch of 2.5%.
To explore the reason for the improvement in Voc from 0.87 V to 0.94 V after the addition of 4% CN in the PBDB-T:PG1-based device, we investigated voltage losses (Eloss) in the PBDB-T:PG1-based solar cells. The total Eloss value was determined by the difference between Egap and qVoc, unlike Eoptg, for which Egap values are determined from the intersection point of the emission spectra and absorption spectra of the relevant blends (as shown in Fig. S11, ESI†).50 The calculated Egap values of the blends (as-cast and with 4% CN additive treatment) are the same, at 1.49 eV. According to detailed balance theory,51–54Eloss in the blends is mainly determined by three factors: (1) ΔECT, which is the driving force for charge transfer (CT) and is determined from the difference between Egap and the energy of the CT state (ECT) in the all-PSC system; (2) ΔEr, which is Eloss due to radiative recombination of charge carriers; (3) ΔEnr, which is Eloss due to the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. The calculation results are summarized in Table 2.

Based on the Marcus theory,55,56 the highly sensitive EQE (sEQE) of both devices were measured to determine ECT (Fig. 3a). The ECT values of the blends (as-cast and with 4% CN additive treatment) were estimated to be 1.44 and 1.46 eV, respectively. Hence, the values of ΔECT are 0.05 and 0.03 eV for the blends, respectively, suggesting that both devices show rather small ΔECT values. In addition, we measured the EQE of electroluminescence (EQEEL) to evaluate ΔEnr (Fig. 3b), which could be directly obtained from the equation ΔEnr = kBTln(EQEEL−1).57,58 Finally, ΔEr was obtained by subtracting ΔECT and ΔEnr from Eloss. The results are shown in Fig. 3c. It was found that the blend films of the PBDB-T:PG1 device with 4% CN additive treatment showed the smallest ΔEnr (0.21 eV) and ΔEr (0.31 eV) compared to those of the as-cast device (0.25 and 0.32 eV, respectively). The lower ΔEnr and ΔEr of the device with 4% CN additive treatment may be caused by the decreased energetic disorder at the D/A interface, which promotes interfacial charge transfer and dissociation.43,59 As a result, the devices with 4% CN treatment exhibited significantly improved Voc.

Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
To investigate the influence of the solvent additive CN on the exciton generation and dissociation process behavior in the PBDB-T:PG1 blend-based devices, the photocurrent density Jph (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the light and dark current density, respectively) versus effective voltage Veff (Veff = V0 − Va), where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage60 curves were measured, as shown in Fig. 4. For the PBDB-T:PG1-based devices, the Jph saturates at a high Veff value of about 2 V, resulting in a saturation current density (Jsat). The Jph/Jsat ratio is determined as the exciton dissociation probability.61 Under maximal power output and short-circuit conditions, P(E, T) values were 64.2/91.4% for the as-cast device and 83.0/94.0% for the device with 4% CN treatment, respectively. These results indicate that the device with 4% CN additive has higher exciton dissociation and more efficient charge collection, which is in agreement with the photovoltaic properties discussed above.
 Fig. 4  (a) Jphversus Veff characteristics, and (b) Jscversus light intensity of the PBDB-T:PG1-based all-PSCs without or with 4% CN additive treatment. 
To investigate the charge recombination behavior in the PBDB-T:PG1-based all-PSC devices, we measured Jsc as a function of illumination intensity (Plight).62 The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ (Plight)S, where Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor. An S value close to 1 represents weak bimolecular recombination in the device.63–65 As demonstrated in Fig. 4b, the S values are 0.94 and 0.96 for the devices without and with 4% CN treatment, respectively. These results imply that the bimolecular recombination in the all-PSC devices was suppressed by the CN additive treatment, thereby enhancing Jsc and FF.
Charge transport properties
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12, ESI†), and the measured charge carrier mobilities are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). The μe value of the PG1 neat film was found to be 8.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μe and μh values for the as-cast PBDBT:PG1 blend film were calculated to be 1.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. With 4% CN additive, μe and μh were improved to 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced charge mobilities of the PBDB-T:PG1-based devices with the 4% CN additive treatment are consistent with the higher FF and Jsc in the corresponding all-PSCs.
Morphology characterization
The molecular packing of neat and blend films was measured by grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS). The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the related line-cut profiles of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) are presented in Fig. 5. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†). The neat PBDB-T film shows (100) lamellar packing in the IP direction at 0.30 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 20.9 Å, and an apparent (010) π–π stacking signal is observed in the OOP direction at 1.71 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.67 Å, indicating the preferential face-on orientation of PBDB-T with respect to the substrate. PG1 shows an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.63 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.85 Å in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 19.6 Å along the IP direction, suggesting a predominant “face-on” orientation, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport. The blend film retains the (200) scattering found in pristine PBDB-T (Fig. 5b), revealing that the packing order and orientation of PBDB-T are not interrupted by the polymer acceptor in the blend films. Most importantly, the blend film with 4% CN additive displays stronger scattering signals with much sharper OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks than those observed for the as-cast film (Fig. 5b), indicating that the additive treatment leads to significantly improved crystallinity. The predominant face-on orientation and high crystallinity of the CN-treated film is desirable for improved charge transport in all-PSCs, resulting in higher photovoltaic performance. We calculated the crystal coherence length (CCL) using the Scherrer equation from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks in the intensity profile.66 The CCL of the (100) packing plane of the as-cast film is 92.8 Å, while that of the film with the 4% CN additive is 199.2 Å. For the (010) packing plane, the CCLs of the as-cast and additive treatment blend films were 15.1 Å and 28.3 Å, respectively. The improved crystallinity, especially in the (010) direction, could lead to improved carrier transport, thus giving rise to enhanced Jsc and FF.

The blend film morphology was also characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6, the as-cast blend film exhibits a surface topography that is smoother than that of the 4% CN additive treated film. These differences can be distinguished in the surface height histograms of Fig. S13 (ESI†) extracted from the AFM images.67 Obviously, the as-cast blend film exhibits a uniform surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.68 nm, while the RMS roughness of the 4% CN additive film is 2.69 nm. Furthermore, the TEM images demonstrate that the blend films formed a fibril network structure. With the 4% CN additive treatment, the diameter and length of the fibrils are increased significantly due to the improved crystallinity. These results are consistent with the GIWAXS results. The 4% CN treatment enhanced the molecular aggregation and hence promoted the fibril nanostructure and suitable phase separation, which provided efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport at the nanoscale, thus resulting in higher Jsc and FF.68–70

Conclusion
In summary, a narrow-bandgap PSMA PG1 based on a Y6-like SMA building block was designed and synthesized. PG1 exhibits a narrow Eoptg of 1.42 eV with a strong absorption in the 550–900 nm region and a high μe of 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Notably, PG1 shows excellent light-harvesting ability with a high extinction coefficient of 1.19 × 105 cm−1 and a higher LUMO energy level (−3.81 eV), which is beneficial for achieving high Jsc and Voc. The as-cast all-PSCs based on polymer acceptor PG1 and polymer donor PBDB-T achieved a PCE of 7.5% with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.51. After 4% CN additive treatment, the blend film possesses enhanced crystalline and phase separation, and the device exhibits higher and more balanced mobilities. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 11.5% with a Voc of 0.94 V, Jsc of 17.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.69 were achieved. These results indicate that PG1 is a promising polymer acceptor for high efficiency all-PSCs.
