    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractA novel, facile and efficient one-pot, microwave-assisted method of synthesis allowing an access to a new series of 3,4-phenylenedioxythiophene derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups at the benzene ring (EWG-PheDOT) and their analogs (with an expanded side π-system or with heteroaromatic rings, ArDOT) by the reaction of 2,5-dialkoxycarbonyl-3,4-dihydroxythiophenes with electrophilic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds in dipolar aprotic solvents has been described. Its applicability over a wide range of novel functionalized ArDOTs as promising building blocks for organic electronic materials has been demonstrated. The structures of selected ArDOTs have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The electronic structure of conjugated polymers p[ArDOTs] based on synthesized novel thiophene monomers has been studied theoretically by the DFT PBC/B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. The performed calculations reveal that while the side functional groups are formally not in conjugation with the polymer main chain, they have an unprecedentedly strong effect on the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers, allowing their efficient tuning by over the range of 1.6 eV. In contrast to that, the energy gaps of the polymers are almost unaffected by such functionalizations and vary within a range of only ≤0.05 eV. Computational predictions have been successfully confirmed in experiments: cyclic voltammetry shows a strong anodic shift of p-doping for the electron-withdrawing CF3 group functionalized polymer p[4CF3-PheDOT] relative to the unsubstituted p[PheDOT] polymer (by 0.55 V; DFT predicted the decrease of the HOMO by 0.58 eV), while very similar Vis-NIR absorption spectra for both polymers in the undoped state indicate that their optical energy gaps nearly coincide (ΔEg < 0.04 eV).
Introduction
Polythiophenes are one of the most fascinating classes of conjugated polymers,1 and a large number of polythiophenes and oligothiophenes, as well as thiophene-based small molecules, have been studied and used as materials for organic electronic applications,2 including organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs),3 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),4 organic photovoltaics (OPV),5 electrochromics,6 photochromics,7 and electrode materials for batteries and capacitors,8 sensors9 and biosensors.10 Among them, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is of special interest and importance due to its high electrical conductivity, optical transparency and stability in the doped state, and it has found many applications in organic electronics.11 Apart from the electronic effect of ethylenedioxy substitution onto the thiophene moiety, an important reason for the superior properties of PEDOT is the flat structure of its backbone due to the attractive S⋯O intermolecular interactions between the neighboring EDOT moieties, which was shown by X-ray crystallography of EDOT oligomers.12–14 This attracted substantial interest in EDOT derivatives and a large number of functionalized PEDOTs have been synthesized and studied.15 However, functionalization of the EDOT monomer at the ethylene bridge does not provide the means for tuning the properties of the polymers, because substituents attached to the bridge sp3 carbon atoms are not conjugated to the thiophene ring and are directed out of the polymer plane (thereby disturbing the π–π stacking between the polymer chains).
3,4-(1,2-Phenylenedioxy)thiophene (PheDOT),16,17 a benzo-fused analog of EDOT, represents a fascinating building block for π-functional oligo/polythiophene materials with the possibility of wider functionalization (at the benzene ring). The electrochemically prepared unsubstituted PheDOT polymer, p[PheDOT], is oxidized at higher potentials (by 0.3–0.4 V) than PEDOT showing a better environmental stability of its neutral form (the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels estimated from cyclic voltammetry data are −4.33 and −3.95 eV, respectively17) and giving a slightly larger band gap (1.80 eV17 and 1.6 eV,11a respectively). In contrast to PEDOT, the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring of p[PheDOT] lie in the monomer plane, and therefore substitution should not increase the inter-chain spacing. Also, the electronic effect of substituents on the benzene ring of PheDOT is expected to be stronger because the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms should allow better coupling of substituents with the oxygen atoms of the dioxine ring via resonance. Reynolds et al. first reported a soluble electroactive PheDOT polymer with dodecyl groups, p[(C12)2-PheDOT], which showed a remarkable degree of intra- and interchain order, both in solution and in the solid state.18 Other soluble alkyl-substituted p[PheDOTs] have been synthesized.19 The polymers showed a hole mobility of 1.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 cm−1 in OFET devices and a PCE (power conversion efficiency) of up to 0.91% in OPV with PC70BM. The PheDOT building block has also been used in the design of an efficient hole-transporting material for perovskite solar cells, which showed an encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 10.64%.20 Another interesting behavior of some substituted PheDOTs has been recently demonstrated by Darmanin and Guittard: upon electropolymerization, they form well-ordered nanotubes of p[PheDOT] polymers on the surface without any template.21 Such nanotubes create parahydrophobic surfaces with extremely high water contact angles (up to θW ∼ 130°–150°) and high water adhesion, even if the nanotubes are prepared from the intrinsically hydrophilic polymers (i.e. Young's angle θY ∼ 60°). This makes them attractive materials for advanced applications e.g. in membrane design, water transport and harvesting, as well as sensor design.  

PheDOT itself and alkyl-substituted PheDOTs (in a more general case, PheDOTs with electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the benzene ring) have been prepared by a common coupling method of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene with catechols catalyzed by p-toluenesulfonic acid.16–19,21 However, synthesis of PheDOTs bearing electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) by this route is problematic because even weak EWGs drastically decrease the nucleophilicity of the corresponding catechols and the yields of PheDOTs.22 An alternative multi-step method, widely used in the synthesis of functionalized EDOTs and related thiophenes, is based on the reaction of 3,4-dihydroxy-2,5-di(alkoxycarbonyl)thiophene (1) with dihaloalkanes, followed by the removal of the carbalkoxy groups by a reaction with lithium bromide23 or by alkali hydrolysis followed by high temperature decarboxylation in the presence of copper chromite,24 copper oxide25 or silver carbonate.26 We have isolated PheDOT in a low yield by this reaction;16a however, its applicability toward a wider range of substituted PheDOTs is problematic (particularly because of the problems with purification of intermediates). Also, this method required several synthetic steps and the use of highly toxic hexamethylphosphortriamide (in the case of decarboxyethylation with LiBr) that diminished its synthetic advantages.
Here we report the facile one-pot, microwave-assisted synthesis of a wide range of substituted PheDOTs functionalized with EWGs at the benzene ring (EWG-PheDOTs) from thiophene 1. We have also successfully expanded this reaction to the synthesis of some analogue structures with pyridine (EWG-PyDOT) and pyrazine (PzDOT, QxDOT) rings, as well as polyfluorinated arylenedioxythiophenes (F4-BnDOT, F6-NaphDOT(1,2), and F6-NaphDOT(2,3)). We have analyzed the properties of the derived polymers by computational, electrochemical and Vis-NIR electron absorption methods. We demonstrate a remarkably strong effect of substituents in PheDOT and its heteroanalogs on the frontier orbital energies of derived polymers with surprisingly small influence on their band gaps.  
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic approach to the one-pot microwave-assisted (MW) synthesis of PheDOT derivatives with EWG groups at the benzene ring, EWG-PheDOT, is illustrated in Scheme 1. Double nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of the substituted benzenes 2–16 by anions generated from 3,4-dihydroxythiophene 1 by a weak base (K2CO3) led to the formation of intermediates 22 and 23, which at high temperature in the presence of lithium bromide underwent decarboxyethylation to form the target EWG-PheDOT compounds. The reaction proceeded well in dipolar aprotic solvents (generally, in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), but N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and pyridine have also been tested).
 Scheme 1  Microwave-assisted synthesis of EWG-PheDOT (the structures of reactants 2–16 and the products are shown in Table 1). 
For more detailed studies, the reaction of thiophene 1 was first tested with hexafluorobenzene (15) by monitoring with GC-MS (Table S2 in the ESI‡). No product F4-PheDOT or intermediates F4-22 or F4-23 were detected in the reaction with conventional heating in DMA even at a prolonged time at 100 °C (Table S2 in the ESI‡). Under MW-assisted conditions, heating at 220 °C showed the formation of a mixture of F4-PheDOT and an intermediate F4-23. Addition of LiBr substantially increased the rate of decarboxyethylation of intermediate F4-23, showing the yields of F4-PheDOT of ca. 10–35% (Table S2, entries 6 and 7, ESI‡). Further optimizations of the temperature, time and the amount of the solvent allowed obtaining F4-PheDOT in 30–35% isolated yields in gram-scale reactions under MW conditions (Table S3 in the ESI‡). Microwave irradiation is an important factor for the reaction: performing the reaction under similar conditions with conventional heating resulted in substantially lower yields of F4-PheDOT (0–7%, Table S3 in the ESI‡) and incomplete decarboxyethylation: apart from the target product F4-PheDOT, substantial amounts of the intermediate F4-23 were formed. We have isolated an intermediate F4-23 when the reaction was performed at temperatures of 140–160 °C, and its structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. S4 in the ESI‡).
A large series of electron-deficient aromatic compounds (3–16) have been investigated in the reaction with thiophene 1, and functionalized EWG-PheDOTs have been successfully obtained (Table 1, entries 3–15). The reaction worked well with fluoro-, chloro- and nitro-substituted aromatic compounds. While NO2 is a poor leaving group, the intramolecular nature of the second step of cyclization to form the PheDOT moiety makes the reaction efficient. It should be noted that o-chloronitrobenzene under these conditions showed a very low yield of unsubstituted PheDOT of only 2% (Table 1, entry 2), presumably due to its lower reactivity in an SNAr reaction in the absence of an additional EWG.

In the reaction of thiophene 1 with tetrafluorophthalic acid (14), spontaneous decarboxylation of CO2H groups at the benzene ring was also observed under the reaction conditions resulting in 36F2-PheDOT (Table 1, entry 13). For the reaction with octafluoronaphthalene (16), nucleophilic substitution occurred at the both 2,3 and 1,2 positions of the naphthalene moiety to form two isomers (with a total yield of 33%), symmetrical F6-NaphDOT(2,3) and non-symmetrical F6-NaphDOT(1,2) in a ratio of ca. 1.75:1 (Table 1, entry 15). In the case of dibromosubstituted 1,2-difluorobenzenes 24 and 25, we observed partial debromination in the reaction and mixtures of substituted PheDOTs were formed. The mixtures were difficult to separate, so were analyzed by GC-MS and 1H NMR, which indicated the removal of one or two bromine atoms in the products (see the ESI‡).  
After the successful synthesis of a series of EWG-PheDOTs with various electron-withdrawing substituents at the benzene ring, we expanded the reaction to other electrophiles, namely perfluorobenzylbromide (17), substituted pyridines (18, 19) and pyrazines (20, 21). The reaction worked well in these cases to give PheDOT analogs, i.e.F4-BnDOT, EWG-PyDOTs, PzDOT and QxDOT,27 correspondingly (Scheme 2 and Table 1, entries 16–20). Electron-deficient pyridine and pyrazine rings are activated for SNAr reactions and with these heterocycles the reaction worked well, even better than for EWG-functionalized benzenes, giving the target products in the yields of 17–74%.
 Scheme 2  Microwave-assisted synthesis of PheDOT analogs. 
While the obtained yields in this one-pot microwave-assisted reaction (Schemes 1 and 2) were generally moderate to low, they are comparable with the total yields of the 3-step “classical route” of condensation of 1 → hydrolysis → decarboxylation (although for the reaction of pyridine 17, we isolated 5CF3-PyDOT with a high yield of 74%). We should mention that in most of the cases we did not optimize the yields towards the reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, time, ratio of reagents, concentrations etc., so the yields can be further improved) but focused on the demonstration of the applicability of this facile and simple method for a wide range of functionalized ArDOTs. In addition, even for the low yielding reactions, the target products could be very easily separated from the intermediates, by-products and tag by column chromatography on silica gel, as they always eluted first with non-polar/modest polarity solvents (usually PE, toluene, DCM or their mixtures; see Table 1). The synthesized ArDOTs are colorless to yellowish crystalline materials (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,‡ for their UV-Vis absorption spectra), generally well soluble in common organic solvents (except of F6-NaphDOT(2,3) and F6-NaphDOT(1,2), the solubility of which is much lower than for other compounds).
X-ray crystallography of ArDOTs
For several synthesized EWG-PheDOTs and their analogs, we have confirmed their structures by X-ray crystallography. The molecular structures of single crystals for seven of the studied ArDOTs are shown in Fig. 1 (see also Fig. S3 in the ESI‡ for crystal packing).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 36F2-PheDOT, F4-PheDOT, 3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT, 56Cl2-PyDOT, 5CF3-PyDOT, PzDOT and QxDOT by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry (3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT showed some disorder of NO2/CF3 groups in a crystal and PzDOT contains two independent molecules in a unit cell). 
Planar molecules of 36F2-PheDOT in the crystal structure form typical for polycyclic aromatic compounds inclined stacks with interplanar distances of 3.437(3) Å. C(thiophene)–H⋯O contacts link the stacks in layers, while weak C(Ph)–H⋯F interactions connect the layers in a 3D framework. In contrast to 36F2-PheDOT, the molecules of F4-PheDOT are arranged in an anti-parallel mode in stacks, probably due to the presence of two additional fluorine atoms creating an area of a negative electrostatic potential. Only the heterocyclic parts of adjacent molecules are overlapped in stacks, and the shortest interatomic distance between the molecules is 3.461(2) Å. The C(thiophene)–H⋯O interactions combine the stacks into corrugated layers.
The presence of bulky EWG groups in the phenyl ring (especially, oxygen atoms of the nitro group that are stronger acceptors of hydrogen bonds than heterocyclic oxygens), drastically change the packing motif. Instead of aromatic stacks, linked by CH⋯O interactions, the packing of 3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT molecules is dominated by C(thiophene)–H⋯O(nitro) and C–F⋯O contacts. The planar moieties are barely overlapped and the adjacent layers are shifted relatively to each other forming a step-like arrangement in order to accommodate the bulky substituents.
The structure PzDOT contains two virtually identical independent molecules. These two molecules form two separate layers with a different orientation relatively to the crystallographic a-axis. The molecules are linked in layers by π⋯π interactions between the dioxythiophene fragments of the adjacent molecules and by C(Ph)–H⋯N contacts. A variety of potential acceptors of hydrogen bonds in this molecule make the pattern of intermolecular interactions quite complex. Both independent molecules are involved in a number of C(thiophene)–H⋯N and C(thiophene)–H⋯S interactions that connect the molecules of different layers into a 3D network. Interestingly, the C(thiophene)–H⋯O interactions, which are present in all other structures, are not present in the PzDOT structure.
The general packing motif of 56Cl2-PyDOT is similar: the chains of the molecules are linked by π⋯π interactions into layers. The peculiarity of the structure is the bonding between the molecules in the layer. Double C(thiophene)–H⋯N contacts are alternative to the combination of a pair of C(Py)–H⋯O interactions with another pair of C(thiophene)–H⋯Cl contacts. Weak Cl⋯Cl (and, probably, Cl⋯S) interactions exist between the layers.
The C(thiophene)–H⋯O and C(Py)⋯H⋯N interactions in 5CF3-PyDOT are far from being linear – the C–H⋯X angles are about 135°. Such a deviation from linearity is apparently caused by the presence of the non-planar CF3 substituent, similar to the structure of 3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT. The packing motif of 5CF3-PyDOT is probably better described as the layers of shifted stacks. No apparent direction-specific inter-layer contacts can be found in the structure and the layers interdigitate by the terminal CF3 groups.
The extended polycyclic structure of OxDOT augments the formation of stacks in the crystal. Slightly shifted stacks are linked together in layers by pairs of bifurcated C(thiophene)–H⋯N,O contacts. C(Ph)–H⋯S contacts exist between the layers.
Generally, the packing of PheDOT derivatives is characterized by the presence of aromatic stacks (except for the cases, where the benzene ring is carrying non-planar groups (3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT and 5CF3-PyDOT)) that are arranged in layers. The thiophene CH groups are mostly active in the formation of weak C–H⋯X contacts that mainly determine the mutual arrangement of stacks within the layers and orientation of the layers. It should be noted that the relative importance of the mentioned interactions and their role in the formation of crystal structures is impossible to estimate properly without the calculations of pair-wise energies of intermolecular interactions. The geometrical parameters of intermolecular contacts alone cannot provide the accurate description of packing motifs dominated by weak/non-directional interactions. For example, the chains of molecules belonging to adjacent stacks may also be regarded as a basic motif of the described structures.
Computational studies
We have studied the geometries and the electronic structures of conjugated oligomers and polymers derived from synthesized ArDOT monomers by the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory in the gas phase. The structures of the dimers (ArDOT)2 optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level have been used for the calculations of the polymers by periodic boundary condition (PBC) methods at the same level of theory.28 Apart from the synthesized ArDOTs, several other related molecules have also been included in these calculations to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the influence of the side arylenedioxy fragments on the structure, orbital energies and the band gaps of the polymers (namely, 4MeO-PheDOT, 4Me-PheDOT,21a4F-PheDOT, NaphDOT(2,3)17 and PyDOT).  
The optimized geometries of (ArDOT)n oligomers adopt an anti-conformation of the adjacent monomer units and in the absence of steric repulsion between the side fragments in the monomer units (that are on the same side of the backbone29). DFT calculations give planar oligomer chains (Fig. 2a) with short S⋯O contacts between the thiophene sulphur atoms and dioxine oxygen atoms (see below for more details). Small steric repulsions between the fluorine atoms in (F4-PheDOT)n makes the oligomer backbone slightly twisted (average dihedral angles of ∼6.4°), adopting a spiral conformation (Fig. 2b), although this small twisting weakly affects the total energies or frontier orbital energies of the oligomers.30 So, we have compared an evolution of the HOMO and LUMO (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) energies and the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔEHL) for planar (PheDOT)n and spiral (F4-PheDOT)n with an increase in the main chain length “n” of the oligomers.
 Fig. 2  B3LYP/6-31G(d) optimized structures of (a) (PheDOT)25 and (b) (F4-PheDOT)20. Left structures – views perpendicular to the chain, right structures – views along the chain. Average dihedral angles/S⋯O distances between the adjacent monomer units are 0.0°/2.947 Å [(PheDOT)25] and 6.4°/2.948 Å [(F4-PheDOT)20]. 
Chain length dependences of the HOMO, LUMO and ΔEHL, when plotted versus the reciprocal number of repeating units (1/n), are linear for shorter oligomers (n ∼ 3–10) with a deviation from the linearity and “saturation” for longer oligomers chains, as is commonly observed for π-conjugated oligomers (Fig. S5, S6, and S8a and Table S5 in the ESI‡).31 This results in extrapolated (to 1/n = 0, i.e. n = ∞) energy levels and the energy gaps that are substantially different (by ca. 0.2 eV) from those calculated for these polymers by the PBC method (Fig. S6 and S8a in the ESI‡). Using a function 1/(n + 0.1n2) that takes into account the quadratic dependence on the chain length for longer oligomers32,33 gives excellent linear dependences (Fig. 3 and Fig. S7 and S8b in the ESI‡). The HOMO, LUMO and ΔEHL energies extrapolated to n = ∞ nicely coincide with the highest occupied/lowest unoccupied crystal orbital energies (HOCO/LUCO) and the band gaps (Eg) for the polymers calculated by PBC (deviations are ∼5–21 meV only, Fig. S7 in the ESI‡).
 Fig. 3  Chain length dependences of (a) HOMO and LUMO energies and (b) HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, ΔEHL, for the B3LYP/6-31G(d) optimized geometries of (PheDOT)n and (F4-PheDOT)n oligomers, plotted as a function of an empirical parameter 1/(n + 0.1n2). Symbols  and  correspond to the energies (HOCO, LUCO, and Eg) for the polymers calculated by PBC. 
Considering the excellent coincidence between the oligomeric approach [linear fitting vs. 1/(n + 0.1n2)] and the less time-consuming PBC method, further calculations of the energy levels and the band gaps for polymers have been performed by PBC using the optimized dimers as the unit cells (Fig. S9 and S10 and Tables S6 and S7 in the ESI‡). For p[ArDOTs] without substantial steric repulsion in the side groups,30 planarization of the backbone is facilitated by attractive interactions between the thiophene sulphur atoms and oxygen atoms of the dioxine ring of the neighboring monomer units. This is manifested by shortening interatomic S⋯O distances, which for the studied polymers are in the range of ca. 2.9–3.0 Å (see Table S8 in the ESI‡),34i.e. substantially lower than the sum of van der Waals radii for sulphur and oxygen (1.80 + 1.52 = 3.32 Å). They are close to the experimental S⋯O distances from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures of planar EDOT–EDOT (2.91–2.93 Å),12 EDOT–thiophene (2.96 Å, 3.02 Å),13 and EDOT–thieno[3,2-b]thiophene oligomers (2.87 Å)14 where non-covalent S⋯O interactions are also supposed to be the origin of planarization of these systems.35
The energy levels calculated by PBC for the optimized geometries of the polymers, i.e. the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals (HOCO and LUCO) and the band gaps (Eg), are presented in Fig. 4.36 DFT calculations show that the functionalization of PheDOT at the benzene ring efficiently tune the orbital energy levels of the polymers. Thus, for p[EWG-PheDOT] polymers (first letter “p” designates the polymer), electron-withdrawing groups decrease the HOCO energy levels by up to 1.64 eV, from −4.374 eV for p[PheDOT] to −6.017 eV for p[45(CN)2-PheDOT] (Fig. 4a and Table S7 in the ESI‡). An intriguing feature found from these calculations is that LUCO energy levels are decreased by nearly the same magnitude (from −2.239 eV to −3.847 eV, respectively). As a result, the band gaps of the polymers remain almost the same (with variations of less than 0.05 eV) and all p[X-PheDOT] polymers lie in the range of 2.123–2.170 eV (from p[4Me-PheDOT] to p[45(CN)2-PheDOT], Fig. 4b and Table S7 in the ESI‡).37 This is in contrast to the effect of introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents in other classes of conjugated polymers when an intramolecular donor–acceptor interaction is observed. For example, an introduction of cyano-groups into poly(p-phenylenevinylenes) and their analogs38–40 or polythiophenes41 (onto vinylene or thiophene moieties, respectively) result both in the decrease of the LUMO energy levels and the contraction of band gaps.

Thus, our results demonstrate that structural variations at the benzene ring in p[PheDOT] polymers might be an efficient way of controlling their frontier orbital energies and p-/n-doping abilities without affecting the band gaps of the polymers. These findings could also be exploited in the design of novel PheDOT-based copolymers, for which fine-tuning of their energy levels would be facilitated by the functionalization of the PheDOT moieties at the benzene ring.
Although the side benzene ring in p[PheDOTs] is not in direct conjugation with the thiophene π-system, the resonance (and inductive) effects of the substituents in positions 4,5 of the benzene ring involving the oxygen atom of the dioxine ring have a strong effect on the polymer backbone. This explains the efficient tuning of the frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers (both the HOMO and the LUMO are on the main chain of the polymers). At the same time, the degree of this influence is incredibly high. For comparison: an attachment of the cyanogroups onto the main chain vinylene fragments of the (2,7-carbazolylenevinylene)–(p-phenylenevinylene) copolymer decreases the LUMO energy by 0.62 eV (with a band gap contraction of 0.10 eV).42 The effect of an attachment of one or two cyanogroups to the side benzene moiety of PheDOT (which are far from the main polymer chain and separated from it by the dioxine ring) is even more pronounced: in the series of p[PheDOT] → p[4CN-PheDOT] → p[45(CN)2-PheDOTs], the calculated LUCO values are decreased by 0.93 eV and 0.68 eV, respectively (Fig. 4a).
Electron-deficient nitrogen atoms in the side aromatic ring, i.e. pyridine and pyrazine, also lead to a decrease in both the HOCO and LUCO energies (for p[PyDOT] and p[PzDOT], and decreases in the HOCO/LUCO energies versus those in p[PheDOT] are 0.097/0.086 eV and 0.310/0.268 eV, respectively; Fig. 4 and Table S7 in the ESI‡). Again, the band gaps are only weakly affected by these structural changes: Eg = 2.135 eV (p[PheDOT]), 2.156 eV (p[PyDOT]), and 2.177 eV (p[PzDOT]). On the other hand, an expanded conjugation at the side moiety by an additional annulated benzene ring (cf.p[NaphDOT(2,3)] and p[F6-NaphDOT(2,3)]vs.p[PheDOT] and p[QxDOT]vs.p[PzDOT]) leads to more pronounced decrease in the band gaps by 79–106 meV to Eg ∼ 2.029–2.056 eV (Fig. 4 and Table S7 in the ESI‡). It has been recently demonstrated by computational methods that an extension of conjugation into the second dimension leads to materials with smaller band gaps compared to parent 1D polymers.42
Electrochemistry and Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy
To confirm experimentally the predictions of DFT studies that the functionalization of p[PheDOTs] at the benzene ring has strong effects on the HOMO/LUMO energies of the polymers while affording only minor changes in the band gaps, we have studied two polymers, p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT], by cyclic voltammetry and Vis-NIR electron absorption spectroscopy methods. The polymers were prepared by the electrochemical polymerization of the corresponding monomers to form insoluble polymer films, which were deposited onto Pt disks (for cyclic voltammetry experiments (CV), Fig. S11 in the ESI‡) or onto ITO (indium tin oxide) glass substrates (for spectroscopic studies) from the monomer solutions in DCM under potentiodynamic conditions. Previously, we have shown that the electropolymerization of PheDOT is more difficult compared to EDOT due to lower positive charge/spin densities at the 2,5 position of the thiophene, and requires high concentration of the monomer and an appropriate choice of the solvents (works better in DCM).16a The selection of 4CF3-PheDOT as an electron-deficient monomer, to compare it with PheDOT, was conditioned by DFT prediction of observable decrease of the HOMO energy level of its polymer (by 0.58 eV, Fig. 4), but still straightforward electropolymerization to form smooth and stable polymer films (Fig. S11d and S12b in the ESI‡). CV studies on the polymer films in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/acetonitrile demonstrated that both polymers are reversibly p-doped and show stable doping/dedoping on cycling (Fig. 5a; see also Fig. S12 in the ESI‡). p[4CF3-PheDOT] was oxidized (p-doped) at a higher potential than p[PheDOT], confirming its weaker electron donor ability (Fig. 5a). Its oxidation onset potential (Eox) was anodically shifted by 0.55 V (from −0.36 V to +0.19 V vs. Fc/Fc+ reference), which is in excellent agreement with DFT calculations (difference in HOCOs of p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT] from DFT calculations is 0.58 V, Fig. 4a). For p[4CF3-PheDOT], we observed electrochemically irreversible n-doping at Ered = −1.57 V (Fig. 5a). From the onsets of p- and n-doping processes, we estimated the band gap of this polymer as ECVg = 1.76 eV, which is close to the estimation of Eg ∼ 1.8 eV for p[PheDOT].17
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the properties of p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT] in films: (a) cyclic voltammograms of polymer films (7 and 3 consecutive scans, respectively, are shown) in acetonitrile and 0.1 M Bu4NPF6, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (current for p[4CF3-PheDOT], have been multiplied by a factor of ×6.5 for convenience of comparison); (b) Vis-NIR electron absorption spectra of p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT] polymer films (electrodeposited on ITO glass substrates) in the undoped state; 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/acetonitrile; potentials are vs. the Ag wire reference electrode. 
The vis-NIR electron absorption spectra of p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT] polymer films (deposited on ITO glass substrates) in undoped states were recorded in a spectroelectrochemical setup (SEC) with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/acetonitrile, with applied negative potentials of −(0.2–0.3) V, which correspond to the neutral states of the polymers. The results shown in Fig. 5b demonstrate that the Vis-NIR spectra of two polymers nearly coincide (both by the maxima of absorption and by the red edge of the longest absorption band corresponding to the optical energy gaps of the polymers). The optical energy gaps of p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT], estimated from their absorption onsets, were found to be very similar to 1.83 eV (676 nm) and 1.87 eV (662 nm), respectively.43 These results confirm that the band gap of p[PheDOT] is unaffected by the introduction of electron-withdrawing CF3 groups and confirm the results of our DFT calculations and CV experiments. As the synthesized ArDOT monomers (Table 1) do not contain long-chain solubilizing groups, their polymers are expected to be the insoluble materials (similar to p[PheDOT] and p[4CF3-PheDOT]) that limits further expansion of these studies to chemically prepared polymers and requires the synthesis of the corresponding EWG-PheDOT analogs additionally decorated with linear or branched solubilizing groups.
Conclusions
We have reported a facile and efficient one-pot, microwave-assisted method of synthesis of 3,4-phenylenedioxythiophene (PheDOT) derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing groups at the benzene rings and their analogs (with an expanded side π-system or with heteroaromatic rings) by the reaction of 2,5-dialkoxycarbonyl-3,4-dihydroxythiophenes with electrophilic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds in dipolar aprotic solvents under basic conditions in the presence of lithium bromide at high temperature. This general method provides an easy access to a wide range of novel ArDOT derivatives as attractive building blocks for conjugated molecular and polymeric materials for organic electronic applications, which are inaccessible by other current methods. The structures of eight selected compounds have been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography, shedding light on the molecular structure and crystal packing of these materials.
DFT calculations predict that the HOMO and LUMO energies for conjugated polymers derived from these monomers can be efficiently tuned by more than 1.6 eV, whereas the band gaps are expected to be nearly identical for all of the studied polymers (variations in ΔEHL are ≤0.05 eV). This paves a way for the efficient tuning of the HOMO energy levels of thiophene-based polymers in a wide range of over 1–1.5 eV without altering their band gaps.
These DFT predictions were further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and Vis-NIR electron absorption spectroscopy experiments: an anodic shift by 0.55 V for the p-doping of p[4CF3-PheDOT] compared to p[PheDOT] corresponds well with the predicted difference in their HOCO orbital energies (0.58 eV), while good coincidence of their electron absorption spectra (λmax = 616 and 609 nm, Eonset = 1.83 and 1.87 eV, respectively) is in excellent agreement with very small changes in the DFT calculated band gaps (Eg = 2.144 and 2.135 eV, respectively). On the other hand, an expansion of the π-system in the side moieties leads to the band gap contraction of the resulting polymers (an additional benzene ring decreases the Eg by ca. 0.1 eV to ≈2.03–2.06 eV).
The reported novel ArDOT molecules represent an interesting class of thiophene monomers for the design of conjugated homopolymers, with the ability to fine-tune the optoelectronic properties of materials by side-chain functionalization. New ArDOTs also represent fascinating building blocks for incorporation into conjugated systems, including small conjugated molecules, cooligomers and copolymers, for designing novel materials for organic electronic applications. The study on the synthesis of soluble conjugated oligomers and polymers/copolymers based on these ArDOTs as materials for electrochromic, field-effect transistor and photovoltaic applications is in progress and the results will be reported elsewhere.
Experimental
Microwave-assisted synthesis of EWG-substituted ArDOTs: general procedure
Diethyl 3,4-dihydroxy-2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate (1) (1.000 g, 3.84 mmol, 1.00 eq.), K2CO3 (531 mg, 3.84 mmol, 1.00 eq.), electrophilic reagent 2–21 (1.0–1.3 eq.) and LiBr (210 mg, 2.42 mmol, 0.6 eq.) were combined in a 35 mL microwave tube, and DMA (10–12 mL) was added. The tube was sealed and bubbled with N2 under stirring for ca. 5 min. The mixture was then heated under stirring in a microwave reactor (initially for 5–20 min at 80–100 °C (for dissolution and homogenization of the reaction mixture), then at 150–200 °C for 0.5–1.5 h; see Table 1 in this study). After cooling to room temperature, the dark brown mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) and extracted with DCM (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2–3 times), dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with an appropriate solvent as an eluent (PE, toluene, DCM, PE/DCM or PE/EA); for full details on the experimental procedures and characterization of novel compounds, see the ESI.‡

In PBC calculations of non-symmetrical ArDOTs from the dimers as unit cells, we used the head-to-tail (HT) connectivity of the monomer units in all the cases. In the absence of steric repulsions between the side aromatic moieties, which are on the same side of the polymer backbone (as in the case of p[4R-PheDOTs] and p[5CF3-PyDOT]), the calculations of the polymers with HT and HH-TT (head-to-head/tail-to-tail) arrangements gave very close total energies (differences are 0.00–0.39 kcal mol−1), as well as the HOCO, LUCO and Eg (differences are 0–5 meV) (Table S1 in the ESI‡). Of course, these differences are substantially higher in the case of polymers with large steric repulsion between the side moieties, i.e.p[3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT], p[3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT] and p[F6-NaphDOT(1,2)].

n

 oligomers with bulky side aryl groups, i.e.Cl4-PheDOT, 3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT, 3NO2,5CF3-PheDOT. F6-NaphDOT(1,2) and F4-BnDOT showed substantial deviation from the planarity, with large dihedral angles between the adjacent ArDOT moieties and therefore they have not been used in further calculations.
For example, fully flat conformation of hexamer (F4-PheDOT)6 has been calculated (local minimum, no frozen coordinates have been used) to have a total energy of 0.59 kcal mol−1 higher than that for the optimized spiral structure and very close frontier orbital energy levels: HOMO = −5.238/−5.236eV, LUMO = −2.580/2.562 eV, and ΔEHL = 2.658/2.675 eV for flat/spiral (F4-PheDOT)6 optimized structures.

An extrapolation of EDOT and PheDOT oligomers to the polymers limit (n = ∞) using different physical models was recently considered in:   J. Torras, J. Casanovas and C. Alemán, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2012, 116, 7571–7583 CrossRef CAS PubMed .
Similar results have been obtained by us recently for the calculations of EDOT–thieno[3,2-b]thiophene copolymers, see ref. 32b.
Basing on the computational studies, Gierschner et al. assume that short S⋯O contacts in EDOT oligomers are non-bonding and vibronically resolved absorption/emission spectra of oligo-EDOTs (as opposite to the non-resolved spectra of oligothiophenes) are not due to self-rigidification by attractive S⋯O interactions, but due to very similar out-of-plane modes in the electronic ground (S0) and first excited (S1) state, which exhibit surprisingly low frequencies:   B. M. Medina, D. Wasserberg, S. C. J. Meskers, E. Mena-Osteritz, P. Bäuerle and J. Gierschner, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2008, 112, 13282–13286 CrossRef PubMed .
In the case of monosubstituted non-symmetric ArDOTs, the polymer main chain can be arranged in HT (head-to-tail) and HH-TT (head-to-head/tail-to-tail) fashion. The total energies, HOCO, LUCO and Eg are almost the same for both regioisomers (Table S1 in the ESI‡). The values reported in the paper are for HT-p[R-ArDOT] regiosomers.
The calculated band gap for p[PheDOT] (Eg = 2.135 eV and ΔEHL = 2.120 eV) is ca. 0.3 eV higher than the experimental value for this polymer (1.8 eV [ref. 17] and 1.87 eV [this paper, see below]). However, it should be noted that the calculations have been performed for the isolated molecules in the gas phase and do not take into account the polarity of the environment and the solid state effect. Good correlations have been demonstrated between the experimental (cyclic voltammetry, Vis-NIR spectroscopy) and the PBC/B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculated frontier orbital energy levels and band gaps for structurally related polythiophenes [ref. 17], so changes in the HOMO, LUMO and Eg with the structural changes in p[ArDOTs] should be predicted by DFT with a high accuracy.

The tail absorption of p[PheDOT] in the NIR region (900–1200 nm) is presumably due to trapped charges in the polymer as is sometimes observed for low band gap polymers. This might result in somewhat higher estimation of its band gap (see e.g.ref. 32b).
