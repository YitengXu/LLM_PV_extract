    , Accepted 20th June 2011First published on 19th July 2011AbstractA novel strategy for fabricating hybrid thin film solar cell devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/indium sulfide (In2S3) nanoflake array films is presented in this paper. We take In2S3 as an example to demonstrate that a novel chalcalgenide nanoflake array structure could be in situ fabricated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates through a one-step solvothermal treatment of an indium nanocrystal layer and sulfur powder in the presence of absolute ethanol. The resulting products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and UV-vis spectrophotometry. A preliminary photovoltaic performance measurement of the fabricated device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al) shows a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.68 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.04% under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The in situ-fabricated special nanoflake array structure may provide a large interfacial surface area for the In2S3 nanocrystals and the poly(3-hexylthiophene) in such hybrid solar cell devices. This novel wet chemical strategy may remove the need for insulated surfactants, improve the stability of both the thin film and the fabricated device, and is expected to be expanded to fabricate other conjugated polymer/charcalgenide hybrid thin film solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
Since Alivisatos reported their design and fabrication of a CdSe/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid solar cell in 2002,1 much effort has been devoted to expand and optimize such photovoltaic devices so as to effectively combine the advantages of both organic polymers and inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) in such devices. Various semiconductor nanocrystals have been incorporated into conjugated polymers to form bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, which consist of a donor–acceptor (D–A) network between the polymer matrix and inorganic nanocrystals such as P3HT/PbSe,2,3P3HT/FeS2,4MEH-PPV/PbS5 and MEH-PPV/CdTe.6 In particular, in 2007, Alivisatos further developed P3HT/hyperbranched CdSe nanocrystal hybrid solar cells with a promising power conversion efficiency of 2.2%,7 which was most likely induced by the introduction of hyperbranched three-dimensional (3D) CdSe nanostructures. However, the reported organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells suffer from the following three deficiencies: first, the as-synthesized NCs will inevitably be capped with surfactant or long chain ligands that act as undesirable insulators; for example, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) was generally used in forming CdSe NCs.7,8 It is reported that only 1 nm of such an insulator may cause energy conversion efficiency to decrease by 10-times.9 Second, a mixing process of organic and inorganic components is needed followed by a spin-coating process for the formation of a hybrid film. Obviously, the spin-coated film could not be tightly attached to the ITO electrode and it is difficult to directly form a hybrid film with desirable channels for electron (or hole) transportation. Third, the use of toxic elements such as Cd or Pb remains a limitation as environmental issues need to be addressed.
With the aim of overcoming the above three problems, we firstly consider the use of in situ-fabricated special nanoflake array In2S3 as an electron acceptor for replacing the toxic species. In2S3 is an important member of the III–VI group mid-gap semiconducting sulfides, that appear to be promising candidates as solar cell materials due to their stability,10 transparency and photoconductor behavior.11 For example, indium sulfide (In2S3) was recently selected as substituted buffer layers of toxic cadmium sulfide (CdS) in CIGS thin film solar cell devices.12 Although various synthetic methods have been developed to form In2S3 thin films, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD),13chemical bath deposition,14,15 chemical transport reaction,16sputtering,13spray pyrolysis and thermal evaporation,17,18 an ideal 3D nanostructure suitable for a hybrid thin film solar cell device is difficult to control using the above methods.
In our previous studies, we have developed a direct elemental reaction route to synthesize PbI2, CuI, Ag2Se and CuSe thin films.19–22 Similarly, we present here a facile wet chemical route for constructing in situIn2S3 nanoflake array films directly on ITO glass substrates. This was simply done through a one-step solvothermal treatment of indium nanocrystals that were deposited on the ITO substrate and sulfur powder in the presence of absolute ethanol. The patterned films, composed of nanoflake arrays, were directly grown on the ITO surface, which may save the spin-coating step, on one hand, and get rid of the need for insulated surfactants, on the other. More importantly, it may improve the stability of both the thin film and fabricated devices. The improvement of the stability mainly lies in following two aspects: first, since In2S3 thin films are formed or rooted directly onto the ITO/In substrate to form a framework with firm and compact nanoflake array structures, the in situ-fabricated In2S3 thin films are mechanically very stable, meaning that they cannot be removed or damaged, even under ultrasonic cleaning treatment. Second, the subsequently constructed hybrid solar cell devices are stable in room temperature surroundings. The photovoltaic performance of the devices (without any encapsulation) did not decrease after storage in a glove box for 30 days.
After the formation of the In2S3 framework of nanoflake arrays, we spin-coated a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layer onto the framework and finally evaporated an Al electrode through a shadow mask. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the solvothermal growth of In2S3 nanoflakes directly on ITO glass and also the first report of employing these novel nanoflake arrays as a framework to fabricate inorganic–organic hybrid solar cell devices. The effects of thickness of the virgin nanoscale indium film and the reaction conditions on the synthesis of In2S3 nanoflake arrays were investigated. The performance parameters of the as-fabricated solar cells, including open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) were investigated at room temperature under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated globe sun illumination from a filtered Xenon lamp. We hope that this novel wet chemical strategy can be expanded to fabricate other conjugated polymers/charcalgenides hybrid thin film solar cell devices.
2. Experimental
Preparation of In2S3 nanoflake array films
Typically, the ITO glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω/□ was cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, a mixture of NH3·H2O:H2O2:H2O(1:2:5) and distilled water several times. To avoid local short circuits, the ITO-covered glass substrates were structured by removing the ITO on a band of the substrate using photoengraving. This procedure was finished by UV-ozone treatment for 60 min. Then, a 60 nm-thick layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P 4083, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter) was deposited on the cleaned ITO substrates by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 3 s and 2500 rpm for 40 s to act as a hole transport layer, followed by baking at 120 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 40 min to remove water in the PEDOT:PSS layer.
A 60 nm-thick indium film was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO surface by magnetron sputtering of an indium target under an Ar atmosphere at ambient temperature. The base pressure in the chamber was kept below 1.0 × 10−4 mbar and the sputter deposition was carried out under a working pressure of 5 × 10−3 mbar at a power of 1000 V A. The sample holder was rotated at a constant speed of 12 rpm during sputtering, and the distance between the target and samples was 40 mm. The final indium film thickness was detected by a film thickness monitor (FTM). In a typical synthesis, a 60 nm indium film and 0.25 mmol S powder were placed in a 28 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then, 21 mL of absolute ethanol was added, the autoclave heated at 180 °C for 12 h and then cooled naturally to room temperature. Finally, an orange yellow film could be obtained on the ITO surface, followed by washing with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and drying under vacuum at room temperature for 2 h. For comparison, a 90 nm-thick indium film was also prepared by a similar method and reacting with S powder under the same conditions.
Hybrid solar cell device fabrication
A P3HT (Aldrich: regioregular with an average molecular weight, MW = 87000) chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated (2000 rpm) onto In2S3 films under an argon atmosphere in a glovebox. Then, the aluminum top electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum at a pressure of around 9.0 × 10−5 mbar through a shadow mask, resulting in individual solar cell devices with a 0.2 cm2 nominal area.
Characterization
The as-synthesized product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Avance diffractometer) monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Digital Instruments, Nanoscope IIId) were used to characterize the morphology of the product. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the pristine P3HT film, pure In2S3 film and P3HT/In2S3 film were recorded by a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 35) from 200 to 800 nm. Labsphere RSA-PE-20 was employed as a reflectance standard. Current–voltage measurements (Keithley 2440 source meter) were obtained by using a solar simulator (Newport Inc.) with an AM1.5G filter under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
In our design strategy, we first prepared a nanoscale indium layer on the ITO surface and then transfered it to an In2S3 thin film with the desired nanostructure. X-Ray diffraction was used to characterize the phase structure of the products. Fig. 1a shows a typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared In2S3 film obtained by solvothermal treatment of a 60 nm-thick indium film and 0.25 mmol S powder at 180 °C for 12 h. These patterns match quite well with the standard diffraction data of In2S3 (tetragonal, JCPDS file no. 25–390, space groupI41/amd (141)). All other peaks of the XRD pattern originated from the ITO substrate (JCPDS file no. 6–416), which revealed that In2S3 films could be in situ-grown without damaging the ITO substrate after the solvothermal reaction. On the other hand, we also checked the resistance of the patterned ITO surface and found no obvious reduction after the solvothermal reaction.

The morphologies of the as-prepared elemental indium films the fabricated In2S3 films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Fig. 2a shows the two-dimensional AFM image of a 60 nm-thick indium film deposited on an ITO glass substrate by magnetron sputtering. The average grain sizes of the indium nanoparticles are shown to be 50–80 nm with a high density. Fig. 2b/c show typical SEM images of the as-prepare In2S3 nanocrystalline thin film obtained by solvothermal treatment of a 60 nm-thick indium film and 0.25 mmol S powder in the presence of absolute ethanol at 180 °C for 12 h. The SEM image of the In2S3 thin film at low magnification reveals that the selected area of the ITO glass is fully covered with highly intersectional sheet-like In2S3 nanocrystals. The geometric distribution of these sheet-like nanostructures (nanoflakes) is optimized in two-dimensional (2D) directions with a high density over a large area (Fig. 2b). From magnified Fig. 2c, it is estimated that the thickness of the In2S3 nanoflakes is about 10–20 nm. These in situ-fabricated nanoflakes form regular grid-shaped nanoarrays. The resulting nanopores between adjacent In2S3 nanoflakes are within 20–100 nm. A photograph of the obtained In2S3 nanoflake films (yellow region) on an ITO glass substrate is also presented in Fig. S3a (ESI†). As a comparison, when the sputtered thickness of the elemental indium nanocrystal film was increased to 90 nm, the corresponding In2S3 nanoflake array is also presented (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Fig. 2d shows the SEM image of the fabricated P3HT/nanoflake In2S3 hybrid film. As we expected, the P3HT polymer can infiltrate into the nanopores between adjacent In2S3 nanoflakes. The thickness of the fabricated P3HT/In2S3 hybrid film was also measured to be about 200 nm using cross-section SEM images of the film (Fig. S2d, ESI†). Here, we successfully constructed a novel nanostructure composed of In2S3 nanoflake arrays/P3HT conjugated polymer directly on the conductive ITO surface. The perfect grid-shaped In2S3 nanoflake arrays may provide a large interfacial surface area for the inorganic semiconductor In2S3 nanoflakes and the P3HT polymer.

In order to investigate the formation mechanism of the In2S3 nanoflake arrays, we have conducted parallel experiments at 180 °C for different reaction times. On the basis of the experimental results, we considered that the formation of the novel In2S3 nanoflake arrays mainly followed the Ostwald ripening process. (1) Firstly, the sulfur powder dissolves in absolute ethanol at 180 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and the nuclei are generated through the reaction between solvated S and indium on the surface of the ITO glass. (2) Nanoparticles are formed and spontaneously aggregate to minimize their surface area. (3) The numerous small protuberances on the surface of the film could provide many high energy sites for growth of In2S3 nanocrystals. These In2S3 nanocrystals then grow further along the preferential direction, resulting in the formation of nanoflakes around each particle (as shown in Fig. S6a, ESI†). (4) Further growth of the In2S3 nanoflakes is mediated by the flat ITO surface, which leads to a tendency to form a flat 2-D nanoflake array structures parallel to the ITO substrate (as shown in Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). (5) As the mass diffusion and Ostwald ripening process proceed, the nanoflakes further grow and most of the In2S3 nanoflakes are joined to each other to form regular nanoflake array structures (as shown in Fig. S6d, ESI†). (6) Finally, the perfect nanoflake array networks with ideal nanopores are formed over a large area at 180 °C for 12 h (Fig. S6e, ESI†). The above formation process is illustrated in Fig. 3.

The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of a pristine P3HT film, In2S3 nanoflake film and P3HT/In2S3 hybrid film are shown in Fig. 4. The pristine P3HT film exhibits a typical absorption spectrum ranging from 400 to 650 nm (λmax = 515 nm) (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b shows the absorption onset of the pure In2S3 nanoflake film at 570 nm. However, the P3HT/In2S3 nanoflake hybrid film has a red-shifted absorption edge at 650 nm, coincident with the absorption edge of P3HT. Obviously, the hybrid film shows a better absorption ability below 470 nm and above 570 nm (Fig. 4c).

In the current solar cell design, electron–hole transfer processes occurring within the P3HT/In2S3 hybrid solar cell are depicted in Fig. 5a (ITO as hole collector and Al as electron collector). Fig. 5a indicates that the energy levels of the In2S3 and P3HT are well matched for fabricating hybrid solar cells. The conduction band of the In2S3 NC is more negative than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the P3HT, while the HUMO level of the P3HT is less negative than the valance band of the In2S3 NC. In the fabricated solar cell device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al), the electrons are injected from the excited state (LUMO) of P3HT into the conduction band (Ec) of In2S3 and then reach the surface of the Al electrode, the holes at the valance band (Ev) of In2S3 transfer to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HUMO)) of P3HT, pass along P3HT chains to the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and then to the ITO electrode. Fig. 5b depicts the schematic device structure of the fabricated solar cells prepared in this way. The resulting photovoltaic region has an active area of 0.4 × 0.5 cm2 (defined by a mask during illumination). A real photograph of the fabricated solar cell devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al) is presented in Fig. S3b (ESI†).

After the fabrication of such hybrid thin film solar cells, we further conducted preliminary measurements to investigate their photovoltaic performance. Fig. 6 plots the current–voltage characteristics of the P3HT/In2S3 nanoflake hybrid devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al and ITO/In2S3:P3HT/Al) measured under simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 6b shows the photovoltaic performance of the as-fabricated device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al). A short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.68 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.29 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.23 and a conversion efficiency (η) of 0.04% were obtained under these conditions. The current–voltage characteristics of the P3HT/In2S3 hybrid device (ITO/In2S3:P3HT/Al) under simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 6a. From the I–V curves, we learn that the cell performance can be enhanced by adding a PEDOT:PSS buffer layer onto the ITO surface. However, the output was found to sharply decrease when the In2S3 nanoflake film was prepared by the reaction between an initially 90 nm-thick indium film and S powder in the presence of absolute ethanol. Although the above preliminary results indicate the conversion efficiency (η) is not high at present, we believe that a much better value could be attained based on the current nanostructures of the hybrid films with both reaction parameter and device optimization.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we developed a novel wet chemical strategy for fabricating hybrid thin film solar cell devices. An indium sulfide (In2S3) thin film composed of nanoflake arrays was prepared in situ through a one-step solvothermal treatment of nanoscale elemental indium layers and sulfur powder in the presence of absolute ethanol. The patterned In2S3 films composed of nanoflake arrays were directly grown on the ITO surface. After device fabrication, we then demonstrated a new poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/indium sulfide (In2S3) nanoflake array hybrid solar cell. The photovoltaic performance of the different as-fabricated devices, including ITO/PEDOT:PSS/In2S3:P3HT/Al, ITO/In2S3:P3HT/Al and ITO/In2S3:P3HT/Au, were investigated in this paper. This green wet chemical strategy may remove the need for undesirable insulated surfactants, improving the stability of both the hybrid thin film and the fabricated device, and is expected to be expanded to fabricate other conjugated polymer/charcalgenide hybrid thin film solar cell devices.
