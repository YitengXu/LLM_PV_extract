We use commercially available non purified nanotubes dispersed in water by ultrasonication and drop cast on stainless steel substrates. When implemented on a ruthenium based DSSC we obtain a high short circuit current density (Jsc= 9.21 mA cm−2), a good open circuit voltage (Voc = 0.660 V) and a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.92%. The above cited values are measured under a light flux of 100 mW cm−2 generated by a solar simulator equipped with a filter AM 1.5. The obtained results are comparable to those attained using a stainless steel counter electrode sputtered with a 2 μm thick platinum film (Jsc 10.92 mA cm−2, Vmax = 0.66 V and η = 4.5%, AM 1.5).IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high solar energy conversion efficiency, simple fabrication and low cost.1 DSSCs (see schematic representation in Fig. 1) consist of a high porosity nanocrystalline photoanode made of TiO2 semiconductor nanoparticles (15 to 20 nm diameter, Egap = 3.2 eV), deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass support and sensitized with a self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules anchored to the TiO2 surface. When illuminated, the dye molecules capture the incident photons generating electron/holes pairs. The resultant electrons, at excited states, are immediately injected (within 100 fs) into the conduction band of the TiO2 and transported to the electron-collecting counter electrode, the cathode. Regeneration of dye molecules is accomplished by capturing electrons from a liquid electrolyte (iodide/iodine solution), sandwiched face-up on the cathode, that catalyses the reduction of tri-iodide. Currently, DSSCs cathodes are made of platinum layers deposited on transparent glass which are, in turn, coated by a conductive layer such as Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) or Indium Tin Oxide (ITO).2 These latter materials are the most expensive components of a DSSC cell (about 57% of the total cost). Moreover, glass is brittle and has shape limitations, while platinum is a rare and expensive material. Furthermore it tends to degrade over time when in contact with an iodide/iodine liquid electrolyte, reducing the overall efficiency of DSSCs.3 During the last few years strong efforts have been directed towards the replacement of such elements with low cost and more versatile materials. Metal sheets or foils are flexible substrates with excellent electrical and thermal conductivities.4 On the other hand, carbonaceous materials feature good catalytic properties, electronic conductivity, corrosion resistance towards iodine, high reactivity, abundance and low cost.5,6 In 1996 Kay et al. demonstrated the importance of the high surface area introducing carbon black powder in graphite counter electrodes to enhance its catalytic activity.7 Since then, other research groups have employed different carbonaceous materials such as graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, fullerene, hard carbon sphere, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene.8-17 Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) are made by rolling up a single graphene sheet18,19 with a fullerene like end-cap.20 Their electronic properties are described by a pair of integers (n, m), the chiral indices, that determine univocally their semiconducting or metallic nature.21 Multi-Wall nanotubes (MWNTs) consist of multiple concentric SWNTs with random chirality, making them metallic on average.22 Carbon nanotubes combine advantages such as high electrical conductivity, chemical stability and high surface area with good electrochemistry and catalytic properties making them suitable for applications in many energy conversion technologies such as catalytic counter electrode materials in DSSCs.23 In particular, CNTs are efficient to catalyze the tri-iodide reduction and, thus, are good candidates to replace Platinum in DSSCs. The excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of stainless steel sheets, combined with the chemical stability and high surface area of SWNTs, make them excellent candidates as catalytic counter electrodes in DSSCs. In this study we introduce a novel cathode type in DSSCs, based on the combination of SWNTs as catalysts and stainless-steel foils as conductive substrates, comparing the solar energy conversion efficiency and other parameters connected with the current–voltage (I–V) curve of these cells with the corresponding parameters of standard cells employing Pt and FTO as catalyst and conductive substrate, respectively. Fig. 1  Scheme of a DSSC with SWNT deposited on a stainless-steel substrate as counter electrode. ExperimentalMaterialsThe conductive glass plates (FTO glass, fluorine-doped SnO2, sheet resistance 15 Ω/cm2), the Pt catalyst T/SP and the Ti_nanoxide (T) paste were purchased from Solaronix SA and used as supplied. All the solvents and chemicals employed for the experiments were reagent or spectrophotometric grade. CarboLex AP-grade SWNTs produced by arc discharge were purchased by Aldrich (part 519308, lot 05224EC). The sample purity is declared to be 50–70%. Nominal diameters and lengths range between dt = 1.2–1.5 nm and L = 2–5 μm, respectively. For optical characterization, SWNTs were individualized in water–surfactant solution (Sodium cholate, Aldrich, Cat: 27,091-1), by ultrasonication followed by ultracentrifugation.24 For cathode preparation SWNTs were dispersed in water by ultrasonication without any further pre-treatment. The stainless-steel sheets and foils were purchased from a shop specializing in metals and sized in our laboratory, the chemical composition of the metallic sheet is the following: 18–20% Cr, 8–12% Ni, 1% Si, 0.030% S, 0.045% P, 2% Mn, 0.08% C as reported from the American Iron Steel Institute (AISI) and the metallic sheets are classified as AISI 304 (or X8 CN1910 according to UNI 4047).Preparation of the dye–sensitizer solutions and photoanodeThe synthetic dye [Ru(II)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic-acid)2(NCS)2], called N3, was synthesized and purified following the procedure reported in the literature.25 N3 standard solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of the inorganic complex in 50 mL of ethanol. The corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectrum and the molecular structure are reported in Fig. 2. The photoanodes were prepared by depositing TiO2 films on FTO conducting glass. First, two edges of the FTO glass plate were covered with four layers of adhesive tape (3M Magic) to control the thickness of the film and to mask electric contact strips. Then the TiO2 paste was spread uniformly on the substrate by sliding a glass rod along the tape spacer. The resulting mesoscopic oxide film was 12–14 mm thick and transparent, presenting negligible light scattering. After drying the TiO2, the covered glass plates were sintered in air for 30 min at 450 °C, cooled to about 80 °C and soaked in N3 dye solution overnight. Excess dye was removed by rinsing with ethanol.25 Fig. 2  (a) UV-Vis Absorption spectrum of the ruthenium complex in acetonitrile @ RT. (b) 3D Molecular structure of the ruthenium complex (N3). Preparation of the electrolyteThe electrolyte solution was obtained by dissolving 1.673 g of LiI and 0.3172 g I2 in 25 mL of acetonitrile (AN) to obtain a solution of 0.5 M LiI and 0.05 M I2 respectively. For the long term (24 h) test, we used a different composition based on dimetil-propyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII) and AN. Furthermore in order to increase the efficiency 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) 0.5 M was added to the electrolyte solution.Preparation of counter electrodesThe investigated counter electrodes were prepared according to the following procedures.Sample P1: the Pt catalyst T/SP paste was spread on FTO glass and heated at 450 °C for 30 min. Sample P2: we used a Pt mirror (350 nm thick) obtained by thermal vapor deposition (or sputtering) of Pt onto FTO conducting glass. Sample P3: analogous to P2 except for the substrate that in this case was a thin (2 mm) stainless steel sheet. Sample C1: we drop cast bundles of Carbolex SWNTs dispersed in water onto a FTO conducting glass substrate. 2 mg of nanotubes powder were dispersed in 10 ml of water by ultrasonication at 200 W for 2 h. Nanotubes were then dropped cast onto the substrate, whose temperature was set to 150 °C. Sample C2: same procedure of sample C1, but exploiting a thin (2 mm) stainless-steel sheet as substrate.26Preparation of the SWNTs solutions for optical characterizationAs-purchased SWNTs powders consist of bundles and ropes of nanotubes with random chiralities,27-29 losing their specific mechanical, thermal and optical properties.30-33 For optical characterization (determination of transition energies, chiralities, diameter distribution, etc.) of the SWNTs samples, a procedure for debundling and individualization is needed.24,34-37 Ultrasonication in water–surfactant solutions was used to disaggregate the nanotube bundles.24 The presence of the surfactant molecules guarantees the encapsulation of individual tubes, preventing re-aggregation phenomena due to the strong surface forces (van der Waals).28 Large impurities were removed by filtration. A final ultracentrifugation step permitted to separate the supernatant, rich of individual nanotubes and small bundles, from large residual bundles and insoluble materials.24,38-40 We dispersed 2 mg of Carbolex SWNTs in 10 ml of de-ionized water with 0.2% w/v sodium cholate added as surfactant. The mixture was ultrasonically treated in a horn sonicator at 200 W, 20 kHz for 90 min in an ice bath in order to prevent heating effects. A filtration step was accomplished with cellulose acetate membrane filters (Minisart, 0.2 μm pore size). The resultant dispersion was ultracentrifuged at 50 k rpm for 2 h. The average gravitational acceleration along the centrifuge tube was ∼ 241000 g. In Fig. 3 we report a picture of the nanotubes soot and the sample after each debundling step. Fig. 3  Pictures of SWNTs powder and dispersions after the different debundling and individualization steps. Processing and testing apparatusUltrasonic treatment was carried out with a Branson 250A horn sonicator (250 W, 20 kHz), equipped with a 4.6 mm diameter microtip. Ultracentrifugation was accomplished with a Beckman Coulter L80 apparatus mounting a SW55ti swinging bucket. Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (OAS) was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda LS 50B. Raman spectra were carried out using a homemade micro-Raman experimental setup equipped with a HeNe laser (633 nm), a Jobin-Yvon HR460 spectrometer and a LN-cooled CCD detector.41 Current–Voltage curves were recorded by a digital Keithley 236 multimeter connected to a PC and controlled by homemade software. Sunlight irradiation was provided by a LOT-Oriel solar simulator (Model LS0100-1000, 300 W Xe Arc lamp powered by LSN251 power supply equipped with AM 1.5 filter, 100 mW cm−2). The cell active area ranged from 0.35 to 0.85 cm2. The photoanode and the counter-electrode were assembled and clipped in an open sandwich-type arrangement with the electrolyte solution placed in between (see Fig. 4). A mask was also later clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cell. Incident irradiance was measured by means of a radiant power meter equipped with a thermopile detector.

Results and discussionOptical characterization of the nanotubesOptical absorption spectroscopy on nanotube dispersions reveals various properties of SWNTs, such as energy levels,24 bundling status,24,44,47 and concentration.24,42,43 In OAS, the absorption peak position gives the energies of the excitonic transitions.44-47 The broadening and red-shift of the absorption peaks, when the same solvent–surfactant combination is used, may be used as a signature of the presence of bundles,48,49 assigned to the reduced strength of the effective Coulomb interactions due to inter-tube screening.50,51Fig. 5a shows the OAS spectrum of the Carbolex nanotubes dispersed in sodium cholate–water solution. We observe a structured band in the 1.0–1.4 eV range (1st band), together with two other sets of weaker features in the 1.55–1.97 eV (2nd band) and 2.09–2.81 eV ranges (3rd band). The latter are superimposed to a broad background, scaling as 1/λ with the wavelength, due to scattering and absorption from carbonaceous impurities such as graphitic particles, large aggregates of bundles still present in the dispersion, highly defective nanotubes.39 For small diameter SWNTs (d < 1.0 nm),52 peaks in the 1st and 2nd spectral zones correspond, respectively, to the first (eh11) and second (eh22) excitonic transitions of semiconducting nanotubes (s-SWNTs),24,53,54 while features in the 3rd zone are due to the first excitonic transitions (m11) of metallic nanotubes (m-SWNTs).24 For the Carbolex, large diameter nanotubes, used in this study we take advantage of the Kataura plot55 to assess the bands origin. We use the modified version of the Kataura plot accounting for many-body effects56,57 and for the corrections to the eh33 and eh44 optical transitions,58 as reported in Fig. 5b (re-adapted from57). Hollow circles correspond to the calculated energy transitions of s-SWNTs, full circles to the ones of m-SWNTs. We can observe (red dashed area) that the 1st band in the OAS spectrum corresponds to the eh22 transition of s-SWNTs with dt = 1.3–1.8 nm. The 2nd zone (blue dashed area) corresponds to the m11 transition of m-SWNTs having dt = 1.3–1.7 nm. The 3rd band (green dashed area) comprehends the third and fourth excitonic transitions of s-SWNTs with dt = 1.3–1.8 nm. To support this conclusion and further look after the presence of small diameter nanotubes, we carried out Raman spectra of Carbolex powders. Raman spectroscopy with multi-wavelength excitation is exploited to quantify the presence and determine the diameter and chirality distribution of SWNTs samples.59,60 The main features of the Raman spectrum of SWNTs are the radial breathing modes (RBMs) in the 100–400 cm−1 region, the D peak at ∼1300 cm−1, the G band in the 1500–1600 cm−1 region and the 2D band at around 2650 cm−1. The Raman emission in carbon nanotubes is a resonant process.59 Therefore, combining the information given by the RBMs peaks energies with the resonance energies found in the ‘Kataura plot’, it is possible to retrieve the SWNT electronic nature (semiconducting or metallic) and their chirality.61,62 For this purpose the low-frequency region, where the radial breathing modes (RBMs) occur, is particularly important.63 The RBM energy is approximately inversely related to the tube diameter as ωRBM = c1/dt + c2.59 Different values have been found for the c-coefficients, depending on the physical status of the nanotubes.59,61,63-65 In the following we will use c1 = 239 cm−1 nm and c2 = 0 cm−1 valid for bundled nanotubes.64 The D peak is due to LO phonons around the K point of the first Brillouin zone,66,67 is active by double resonance68,69 and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to the Kohn Anomaly at K.70 The G peak in the 1500–1600 cm−1 region, consisting of the G+ and G− bands, is due to the bond stretching of all pairs of sp2 atoms in both rings and chains.71 In s-SWNTs, both bands are sharp with Lorentzian profile. They originate from the longitudinal (LO) and tangential (TO) modes, respectively, derived from the splitting of the E2g phonon of graphene.72,73 In m-SWNTs, the assignment of the G+ and G− bands is the opposite, and the G− width is larger and down-shifted.73 The 2D peak is the second order of the D peak. Although a large number of excitation wavelengths are necessary for the complete characterization of the SWNT samples,59,65 some information can also be derived using only few excitations, especially when Raman is used to check the evolution of the starting material subject to corrosive agent or doping effect. Raman spectra at 633 and 514.5 nm excitation wavelengths (1.96 and 2.41 eV, respectively) are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b. The first spectrum shows three peaks related to RBM modes at 147, 164 and 186 cm−1 corresponding to nanotubes with diameters peaked, respectively, at 1.66, 1.47, 1.25 nm. According to the ‘Kataura plot’ in Fig. 5b (red horizontal line) the 1.66 nm diameter tubes can be assigned either to s-SWNTs resonantly excited in their E33 transition, or to metallic tubes such as (19,4) and (18,6) with diameters of 1.67 and 1.69 nm, respectively. The 1.47, 1.25 nm tubes are of metallic nature (excitation resonant with the m11 transition). The abundance of the m-SWNTs detected in the RBM region is also confirmed by the G band shape (Fig. 6a, inset). Indeed, the spectrum shows a sharp G+ band (∼ 1586 cm−1) and a broader G− band (with bumps at 1540 and 1560 cm−1). The peak @ 1586 cm−1 is attributed to a combination of the TO mode of s-SWNTs. The peak at 1540 cm−1, according to Fig. 19 of ref. 73 is attributed to the LO mode of metallic tubes with d = 1.4 nm. Finally, the peak of 1560 cm−1 is attributed to a combination of s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs with d = 1.2 nm and d = 1.4 nm, respectively.73 The position of G+ and G− peaks is diameter dependent and the splitting between these two peaks increases with decreasing nanotube diameter.73 The 514.5 nm excitation RBM spectrum (Fig. 6b) consists of a broad band peaked at 166 cm−1 which, according to the Kataura plot (green horizontal line) corresponds to emission from s-SWNTs having diameter d = 1.26–1.74 nm. Optical characterization shows that the SWNTs starting material is composed by a mixture of m- and s-SWNTs with a diameter range of 1.25–1.8 nm.

Red and green solid lines represent the excitation energies used for the Raman measurements.  Fig. 6  Raman spectra of Carbolex nanotubes powders acquired at 633 nm (a) and 514.5 nm (b) excitation wavelengths in the RBM and [inset of (a)] G band spectral regions. The relation ωRBM = 239/dt is used to calculate the diameters from the RBM frequencies. Cell operation and testingFor DSSC testing we selected a high corrosion resistance set of different stainless steel sheets with low Nickel content (< 12%). We did not observe any corrosion effect on the stainless steel sheets conductivity after their immersion in the electrolyte solution. This confirms that stainless-steel foils are suitable as substrates for DSSCs.23,74 In Table 1 are reported the parameters obtained by I–V measurements: fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion energy efficiency (η). The best solar energy conversion efficiency (η = 4.5%) was achieved with the P3 method (Pt mirror/stainless steel cathode) and it is comparable to the one reported by Fang et al.4 using a metal sheet as counter electrode. Metallic platinum based counter electrodes (P2 and P3) act as light reflectors and highly efficient conductors, remarkably improving the efficiency of the solar cells with respect to P1, C1 and C2. The lower efficiency obtained on P2 with respect to P3 is due to the higher resistance of the FTO glass substrate. We argue that the difference in performance between samples P1 and P2 is because in the latter the metallic mirror acts as a light reflector. The efficiency difference between C1 vs. C2 is related to the different conductivity of the employed substrates. However, the catalytic effect of SWNTs (C1) is slightly higher than platinum in the transparent cathode (P1). Concerning the SWNTs based cathode the best value was obtained with the C2 (3.9%), combining the high surface area of SWNTs with the high conductivity of the metal sheet. This result is comparable to the sample P2 and to the data reported on purified SWNTs by Suzuki et al.12 In order to check possible alterations of the SWNTs coating due to corrosion during the cell operation, we carried out Raman spectra on a nanotube coated steel counter electrode prior and after usage in a DSSC module. Monitoring the evolution of the D peak and its overtone, the 2D band, we verified possible damage due to corrosion by the iodide/tri-iodide electrolyte. In Fig. 7 we show a zoom of the Raman spectra in the Radial Breathing Modes (left plot), the G-peak (central plot) and the 2D-peak (right plot) regions. Although a small decrease in the I(G)/I(D) ratio is seen in the Raman spectrum after their use in the solar cell with respect to the starting material, the spectral profiles do not show any other differences such as destruction of particular tubes or a change in the metallic vs. semiconducting ratio. This demonstrates the high resistance of the nanotubes towards the iodide/tri-iodide corrosion in the solar cell. Furthermore we performed long term stability tests under solar simulator conditions (AM 1.5) and @ 25 °C. A sealed cell was prepared using surlyn polymer foil as the spacer. A few drops of low volatility electrolyte solution (DMPII+AN) were then introduced into the cell via the vacuum side through the injection hole, subsequently sealed with surlyn and a microscope cover glass. The stability test (see Fig. 8) showed no significant change in the fill factor (FF), the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion energy efficiency (η) within 1000 h (corresponding to 41 days). The advantage of using non purified Carbolex nanotubes relies on their low cost and the richness of the metallic fraction when compared with CoMoCAT tubes.75 Moreover the possibility of using a water based dispersion of SWNTs reduces pollution from the use of other kinds of solvent. Thus our work, suggests a relatively simple procedure to fabricate SWNTs-based stainless-steel counter electrodes that reach similar performances with respect to platinum sputtered cathodes, at a lower cost, and with an increased overtime stability towards electrolyte corrosion.

ConclusionWe demonstrated the preparation of a DSSC based on a novel stainless-steel cathode coated with commercial low cost non purified SWNTs. Measurements on 0.52 cm2 test cells showed an efficiency of 3.92%. We achieved with the SWNTs based cathode on stainless steel (C2) a solar energy conversion efficiency which is higher than the one obtained with Pt-transparent/FTO counter electrodes (P1), and is comparable to the one obtained with Pt mirrors (P2 and P3). Stainless-steel foils as substrates coated with commercial low cost SWNTs are innovative, original, stable, cheap and highly efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs. Indeed the combination of SWNTs and stainless steel opens up new industrial opportunities for large area, long term stability and low cost DSSCs.
