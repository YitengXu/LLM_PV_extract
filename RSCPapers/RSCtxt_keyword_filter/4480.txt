    , Accepted 7th August 2021First published on 9th August 2021AbstractIn this work, ten metal-free organic dyes based on the 4,4′-dimethoxy triphenylamine donor and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor were designed and computationally studied for their potential in DSSC. The different π-spacers employed for the comparative study are benzothiadiazole (TC1), quinoxaline (TC2), benzotriazole (TC3), phenathrothiadiazole (TC4) and dihexylcyclopentadithiophene (TC5). The 4,4′-dimethoxy triphenylamine donor was paired with the π-spacers via single-bond/double-bond joints. This computational work mainly aims at determining the impact of the π-spacer on the geometrical and optoelectronic properties using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent-DFT approaches. Our studies revealed that all of the designed dyes have strong absorptions in the range of 560–700 nm with satisfactory oscillator strengths and light-harvesting efficiencies (LHE). Several other photovoltaic parameters, such as absorption maximum, driving force for dye regeneration (Greg), energy level alignment, chemical reactivity parameters, reorganization energy, and dye adsorption energy (Eads), were measured to determine the role of heterocyclic π-spacers in improving the efficiency of a solar cell. Based on the above parameters, the dye with benzothiadiazole spacer was identified to be the most promising candidate among those studied. These findings provide valuable hints for the fast screening of π-spacers for the efficient molecular engineering of organic sensitizers.
1. Introduction
Ever since the first pioneering work by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have drawn considerable attention as a way to produce cost-effective and clean renewable energy in comparison to inorganic semiconductor-based photovoltaic systems.1 In essence, DSSCs consist of a photo-anode and a cathode filled with an electrolyte. The photo-anode is comprised of immobilized dye molecules on a semiconductor metal oxide substrate, which converts light energy into electrical energy. At the heart of DSSCs are light-harvesting sensitizers, and their advancements have played a dominant role in the progress of DSSC. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been expended in modifying the sensitizers to improve the efficiency from 7.1%1 in 1991 to 14.3% in 2015.2 To date, the representative/well-known first-generation metal-based sensitizers are built from metal complexes, primarily Ru polypyridyl complexes and zinc porphyrin systems, which show excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 11.5% and 13%, respectively.3,4 However, because of their limited resources, heavy metal toxicity, high cost, and difficulty in purification, metal-free organic dyes have been gaining significant attention. Their advantages include high molar extinction coefficient (ε), eco-friendliness, low cost, facile synthetic approaches and flexibility in molecular tailoring. Hence, a large number of metal-free organic dyes with architectures such as D–π–A, D–A′–π–A, D–D′–A, D–A–D–A, A–π–D–π–A, D–π–D′–A have been explored for DSSCs.5–10
Among the many kinds of metal-free organic sensitizers, triphenylamine (TPA) donors constitute excellent dye-stuffs due to their propeller-shaped structure, enhanced light absorption and high molar extinction coefficients. The non-planar geometry of TPA offers resistance to dye aggregation, which in turn reduces the vibrational energy loss and is thus explored in great detail for DSSC applications.11–16 It has also been employed as the hole transport material in perovskite solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes.17 Kitamura et al. published the first report on a TPA sensitizer in 2004 with an efficiency of 5.5%.18 There are plenty of dye structures with TPA as the donor in DSSC and recently, Yiming et al. reported the improved performance of TPA derivatives with up to 13.1% efficiency with the model dye Y123, which has substituted TPA as the donor, dihexylcyclopentadithiophene π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor.19 It is clear from the literature that the substituted-TPA (4,4′-dimethoxy TPA) as a donor is superior to the simple TPA analogue due to the presence of electron-rich auxiliary methoxy units. This approach led to an improvement in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and in turn boosted the photovoltaic performance.20
One of the major disadvantages of organic dyes is their sharp and narrow absorption bands in the visible region, limiting their ability to harvest light. Hence, a low energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is desirable to red-shift the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) towards near-infrared regions to maximize the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE). One effective method is to raise the energy of HOMO by electron-rich donors and minimize the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (EH–L) by lowering LUMO via electron-deficient planar π-spacers. Hence, the rational and judicious modifications of donor, linker and acceptor moieties are required to determine the best dye architecture. The π-spacer is one of the key factors for panchromatic absorption and can be constructed more flexibly in the D–π–A dye design. It has two main roles. Firstly, it adjusts the EHOMO of the dye molecule, which in turn influences the driving force for the dye regeneration. Secondly, it affects the LUMO energy (ELUMO) of dyes, thereby charge injection into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, the absorption window and molar extinction coefficient. Mainly three types of investigation have been carried out in the π-spacer, namely, the length of the π-spacer, type of π-spacer, and the rigidity and planarity of the π-spacers.21–23 Thiophene and its derivatives are among the most widely studied π-bridge segments in the D–π–A design to date due to the rigid conjugation and facile incorporation of alkyl chains.24–27
To put the required properties into the design of a sensitizer, a series of ten metal-free dyes (named TC1–TC5 and TC1′′–TC5′′) were designed and compared with the experimentally reported sensitizer L105 (named TC5 in our study).28 The reference dye (TC5) has 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA, dihexylcyclopentadithiophene and cyanoacrylic acid as the donor, π-spacer and acceptor, respectively, and an efficiency of 7.32%. Concerning the π-spacer in the TC5 dye, we have chosen four more heterocyclic π-conjugated bridges, namely benzothiadiazole (TC1), quinoxaline (TC2), benzotriazole (TC3), and phenathrothiadiazole (TC4) to design dyes with better performance. According to Pei et al., the order of electron-withdrawing ability of the three linkers is benzothiadiazole > quinoxaline > benzotriazole.29 The electron deficient, [1,2,5]thiadiazole unit is attached to a phenanthrene group which makes rigid and planar unit. The electron-rich 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor,30 which have already been proven to be suitable choices for the donor and efficient acceptor, respectively, are retained for all the dyes.31 The dyes studied here are coded as TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4 and TC5, respectively, and are shown in Fig. 1. Though these electron-deficient rigid heterocyclic π-spacers/linkers have already been used in other dye architectures, we intend to carry out a systematic comparison of their optoelectronic properties in the D–π–A design using two modes of joints (single-bond/double-bond). The simple donor-π bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) is the most studied push–pull system and can generate a unidirectional electron flow, which can enhance the cell performance.

It is undeniable that computational studies will be the best method for the fast screening of new efficient dyes and to optimize the best structural motifs to save on synthetic problems, time and economic issues.32–36 Important parameters such as absorption spectra, light-harvesting efficiency, energy gap, electron injection energy, dihedral angle, driving force for dye regeneration, dye adsorption energy and were investigated to study the π-spacers to identify potential sensitizers. Density functional theory (DFT)/time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) research were executed on the various π-spacers for 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA-based sensitizers to understand how structural modifications affect the electronic, spectroscopic and energetic properties.
2. Computational methods
DFT calculations have been conducted to optimize the geometries of the ten designed dye structures using the Gaussian 16 suite.37 Since it is a difficult task to find a suitable functional for a specific class of organic molecules, which can produce relatively good results close to the experiment values, various hybrid functionals such as B3LYP,38 CAM-B3LYP,39 M06-2X,40 PBE1,41 TPSSh,42 M06, and ωB97X-D,43 together with the different polarized spilt-valence basis44,45 sets, such as 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-311+G(d,p), have been screened for optimization of the dye structure in the dichloromethane (DCM)46 solvent phase. Ground state optimization plus frequency calculations have been performed to ensure that the optimized structure corresponds to the global minima on the potential energy surface (PES). The obtained results are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be inferred from the table that the results from B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) are well in agreement with the experimental results of the model dye (L105/TC5). Moreover, it has been mentioned in the literature that the elongation of π-conjugated bridges or an increase in the electron richness of the donor does not always lead to better performance. Rather, the dye must be rationally constructed by balancing the light-harvesting capability with suitable energy level alignment and smooth electronic communication to ensure unimpeded charge separation and transport.28
The structures of dyes were drawn using the visualization program GaussView 6.047 and the excited state properties of the dyes were investigated using the GaussSum 3.0 software.48 Solvation effects of absorption spectra were included by the conductor-like integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM). The absorption spectra were simulated by TD-DFT with different sets of functionals and basis sets and a close match was obtained at M06/6-311G(d,p) with the experimental absorption maximum (λmax) values (Table S2, ESI†).
The first-principles calculations were performed to comprehend the interaction at the dye/TiO2 interface using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP)49,50 code by using Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the exchange–correlation functional.51 The pseudopotential was implemented based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, which includes the valence electron configurations of atoms.52,53 The Monkhorst–Pack scheme was employed for the Brillouin zone and k-point sampling. The slab of anatase-TiO2(1 0 1) surface calculations used 1 ×2 × 1 k-points with a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 520 eV and the energy convergence of 1 meV per atom. The anatase TiO2(1 0 1) surface with 200 ‘O’ and 100 ‘Ti’ atoms was selected after consulting the DSSC literature. An inter-dye distance of more than 10 Å was ensured to avoid the interaction between periodically repeating dyes in any direction.54
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optimized dye structures
The molecular structures and codes of the designed dyes (TC1–TC5 and TC1′′–TC5′′) with different π-spacers, which are derived from TC5, are shown in Fig. 1. Five different π-spacers such as benzothiadiazole (TC1, TC1′′), quinoxaline (TC2, TC2′′), benzotriazole (TC3, TC3′′), phenanthrothiadiazole (TC4, TC4′′) and dihexylcyclodithiophene (TC5, TC5′′) were connected to the 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA donor and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor via single-bond and double-bond linkages. The dye design follows a unidirectional and simple rod-like configuration. All dyes are non-planar at the donor part, which can help to effectively inhibit intermolecular π–π aggregation. The chemical structures of the dyes were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level (Fig. 2). The dihedral angle (φ) is measured for the optimized geometry of dyes to understand the effective electronic communication between the donor–π–spacer-acceptor (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Since the double bond π-bridge between the electron donor and acceptor is relatively planar, rather than twisted, electron migration from the donor to the acceptor can be facilitated. The φ of the donor part and the single-bond joint linker lie in the range of 141.91°–154.57°, which deviates from planarity and in turn hinders the smooth electron flow. The order of φ w.r.t donor and spacer in the case of single-bonds follows the order of TC3 > TC5 > TC1 > TC4 > TC2. It is expected that the single-bond joint benzotriazole offers the best planarity in the dyes. The φ at the linker-acceptor joint retains the planarity for all ten dyes.

3.2 Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) diagram
The FMO diagram can provide a qualitative representation of the electron density distribution of the dyes at their respective donor, acceptor and linker moieties. The HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 energy levels are shown in Fig. 3 and 4 using the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) method. For the entire family of dyes studied here, the HOMO is a π-like orbital concentrated primarily at the 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA unit with a little contribution from the π-spacer. Similarly, the LUMO lies on the other end of the molecule mainly at the cyanoacrylic acid group along with substantial electron delocalization towards the π-linker. The significant electron delocalization in the π-linker reveals its electron accepting nature. The HOMOs and LUMOs are well separated, which ensures efficient ICT from the donor to the acceptor and further from the LUMO to CB of TiO2. The electronic delocalisation along the π-spacer guarantees a certain continuity between the ground and excited charge-transfer states, which is necessary to achieve good ε.55

3.3 Projected density of states (PDOS)

Table 1 quantifies the FMO diagram and depicts the extent of electron density distribution at various parts of the dye, such as the donor, acceptor, and π-linker from HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 levels. It can be seen from the table that the major transition occurs from HOMO to LUMO. The electron density distributions for the donor, linker, and acceptor moieties in the HOMO are 73–92%, 6–20%, and 0–5%, respectively, while the LUMO amount is 0–12%, 42–63% and 25–56%. The calculated PDOS data can provide relative electron density information to understand the FMOs and also to demonstrate that photoexcitation primarily occurs at the 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA donor.

3.4 Electrochemical properties and energy level alignment
One of the basic requirements for a sensitizer is that it has HOMO and LUMO energy levels that match with the redox electrolyte and the CB of the TiO2 semiconductor. The FMOs energy level diagram, having the CB band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, is shown in Fig. 5 for the ten designed dyes. The calculated energies of HOMO (EH), LUMO (EL), (EH–L), ΔGinjand ΔGreg are tabulated in Table 2. The available experimental data for the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TC5 are −5.08 V and −3.19 V (in parentheses), respectively. The HOMO levels of all the dyes under study (ranging from −5.34 to −4.97) lie below the redox potential of I−/I3− (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum), indicating that the oxidised dye can be efficiently regenerated by the redox couple during the dye regeneration process. Their LUMO energy levels (ranging from −2.95 to −3.46 eV) lie above the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum), which guarantees that the excited state electrons can be readily transferred during the charge injection process. A narrow EH–L causes the absorption of longer wavelength photons, which excites the electrons from the HOMO to LUMO. This should improve the current density (JSC) and increase the PCE of solar cells.

The best electron injection and dye regeneration were obtained when the LUMO and HOMO levels had optimum values w.r.t the CB band of TiO2 and redox potential of the electrolyte, respectively. Molecular systems with smaller EH–L provide substantial ICT from the donor group to the acceptor unit through π-conjugated bridges, broadening the absorption spectra toward longer wavelengths. The calculated EH–L value of the reference dye (TC5) was 2.12 eV and TC1 and TC1′′ dyes had the lowest values. As expected, the double bond linker minimized the energy gap when compared to the single bond joint, which was expected to produce robust photovoltaic performance. The reduction in EH–L values was in the order of TC3′′ > TC5′′ > TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC1′′ and TC3 > TC5 > TC2 > TC4 > TC1 for single-bond and double-bond linkers, respectively. Thus, according to the energy level diagram and EH–L values, TC1′′ was expected to have more beneficial ICT features, which will be further verified in the following discussion.
3.5 Simulated absorption spectra
To gain insight into the excited state properties, we carried out TDDFT calculations at the M06/6-311G(d,p) level using the IEPCM model in DCM solvent. We first performed a functional test at the TD-functional/6-311G(d,p) level to determine the appropriate functional as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). However, the choice of the hybrid functional is system-dependent. The λmax values obtained from the B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, ωB97X-D, TPSSH, PBE1, M06 and M06-2X functionals with 6-311G(d,p) were 669 nm, 403 nm, 387 nm, 837 nm, 598 nm, 568 nm, and 410 nm, respectively. From this exercise, M06 was found to be the best suited for our study since the λmax computed (568 nm) matched closely with the experimental results of the TC5 model dye (553 nm) reported in the literature, with a small difference.28 As a result, the absorption spectra of all organic dyes in this work were determined using the TDDFT M06/6-311G(d,p) method combining the IEFCPCM model in DCM solvent. The simulated absorption spectra with the 20 lowest singlet–singlet transitions are displayed in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the energy gaps using the above functional provided a good prediction with the experimental data of the model dye TC5. The computed absorption maxima (λc), oscillator strengths (f), and major transition and dipole moments are tabulated in Table 3.

All of the dyes showed good ICT absorption in the visible and near IR region (568–690) with adequate oscillator strength (0.066–1.3197). The results showed that for almost all the dyes (TC1–TC3 and TC1′′–TC3′′), the HOMO → LUMO (transition with highest absorption wavelength) is a significant transition with large oscillator strength, except in the case of TC4–TC4′′ and TC5–TC5′′. The TC4 and TC4′′ dyes showed better oscillator strength for the HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 transition with absorption maximum around 396 nm and 427 nm, respectively. The HOMO–LUMO+1 transition had the best oscillator strength for TC5 (380 nm) and TC5 ′′(428 nm) dyes. It can be seen that the π-linkers had a substantial influence on the λc values, and the electron transfer probability with the longest λc is related to the HOMO–LUMO transition state. The addition of a double bond linker to the sensitizer can thus lead to the broad and red shifted absorption maximum and enhanced the oscillator strength. Such a bathochromic shift of λc and higher f values are desirable for harvesting the solar energy/spectrum. The increasing order of the shift in the absorption maximum for the sensitizers was TC1′′ > TC3′′ > TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC5′′ and TC1 > TC2 > TC3 > TC4 > TC5 for double-bonded and singly-bonded linkers respectively. TDDFT calculations showed that the benzothiadiazole-based linker (TC1 and TC1′′) had highest absorption maxima. Hence, an excellent correlation was observed between the calculated EH–L gaps with the spectroscopic data, showing a red shift of the λc of ICT on going from TC5′′ to TC1′′ and TC5 to TC1. The calculated ground state dipole moments of the dyes in DCM solvent at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory are included in Table 3. The dipole moments of the double-bond spacers are higher as compared to the single-bond spacer. The sequence of dipole moments was as follows: TC1′′ > TC3′′ > TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC5′′ and TC3 > TC1 > TC5 > TC2 > TC4 for double-bond and single-bond linkers respectively. It was reported in the literature that electron-withdrawing substituents show higher dipole moments56 and the best value of 16.2 Debye was obtained for the TC1′′ dye with benzathiadiazole as the spacer. In addition, the calculated dipole moments for a series of dyes derived from TC5 correlate well with the observed strong absorption bands of their electronic spectra.
3.6 Charge density difference calculation
The charge density differences (CDD) for all the molecules are represented in Fig S3 (ESI†). In all the molecules there is heavy charge distribution around the acceptor–TiO2 interface and there is no charge distribution at the TiO2 surface other than interaction sites. CDD data confirmed the presence of ICT up to the semiconductor CB via the acceptor.
3.7 Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
NBO analysis was performed to quantify the amount of charge transfer that occurred in the organic dyes from donor to acceptor on the optimized structure in the ground state obtained at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level. Table 4 displays the calculated NBO charges on the donor, acceptor and linker moieties for each dye. As expected, the donor part of all dyes has a positive value, whereas the acceptor part has a negative value. The more positive charges and negative charges indicate the electron richness and electron-accepting nature of the donor and acceptor units. The π-linkers have the positive values, except in the case of benzothiadiazole (TC1) and dicyclohexyldihtiophene spacers (TC5); the negative value obtained could be due to the electron-withdrawing ability of the linkers. It is clear that the double-bonded linker added electron richness to the overall dye architecture, which is evident from the increase in the amount of charge in the donor, π-linker and acceptor units, respectively. NBO analysis further confirmed that the direction of ICT was from donor to acceptor.

3.8 Adsorption energy calculation/dye adsorption onto the TiO2(1 0 1) surface
The proper adsorption mode of an anchoring group is required to ensure the efficient electron injection from the acceptor group to the CB of TiO2. There are mainly six different modes of adsorption reported for a dye onto the TiO2 surface:57 (1) direct covalent bond attachment via chemisorption, (2) coulombic or electrostatic interaction by ion-pairing or acceptor–donor interactions, (3) non-covalent bond via hydrogen bonding, (4) self-assembly of hydrophobic interactions, (5) van der Waals interactions via physisorption, and (6) physical entrapment.
It has been stated in the literature that the majority of the adsorption of carboxylic acid anchoring groups onto the TiO2 anatase occur through chemisorption.58 It happens via the dissociation of hydrogen from the –COOH group, and subsequent bond formation occurs between the oxygen atoms of carboxylate and the Ti atoms of TiO2. The chemisorption binding can be of different forms, such as bidentate bridging, or bidentate chelation, or the monodentate ester form. The bidentate bridging adsorption of carboxylic acid was found to be the most significant binding mode as it is more energetically favourable than the monodentate mode.59
The geometry optimization was performed on the TiO2 anchored dye mode shown in Fig. 7, which uses bidentate bridging. Table 5 tabulates the computed distance between Ti and O, O and H and the adsorption energy. All ten dyes can be vertically adsorbed on the TiO2 surface via the formation of two new Ti–O bonds between 5 coordinated Ti atoms and oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group. The adsorption energy (Eads) is defined in eqn (1). The negative Eads suggests the chemical bond formation between the TiO2 surface and dye, implying that there would be greater electron injection ability to the CB of the TiO2 from the LUMO of the dye. Eads = E(dye+TiO2) − Edye − ETiO2(1)ETiO2 and Edye denote to the total energy of the TiO2 and isolated dye molecule, respectively, and E(dye+TiO2) represents the total energy for the adsorbed dye onto the TiO2(101). All ten dyes had a sufficiently negative adsorption energy value. Moreover, the double-bonded linkers showed higher Eads than a single-bond linker, except for TC3. The increasing order of Eads was TC3 (−0.131) > TC4 (−0.102) > TC2 (−0.046) > TC5 (−0.014) > TC1 (−0.004) and TC4′′ (−0.132) > TC2′′ (−0.107) TC5′′ (−0.085) > TC1′′ (−0.047) > TC3′′ (−0.039). TC1 dye exhibited the least Eads and TC4′′ showed the highest Eadsamong the dyes studied. These findings showed that all of the dyes could be closely adsorbed to the semiconductor's surface, which could be conducive to improving the efficiency of the photovoltaic performance.

3.9 Density of states (DOS) at dyes on TiO2

Fig. 8 shows that the total density of states (TDOS) of the dye@TiO2 (Fig. 8b and c) and the pristine TiO2(101) (Fig. 8a) surface slab (along with PDOS of Ti4+ and O2−). This has two main zones: an upper CB zone and a lower valence band (VB) zone. The CB is dominated by the contribution of Ti, while the VB is dominated by the contribution of O. In general, the contribution of Ti in the CB through the 3d orbital and contribution of O to the VB through the 2p orbital were clearly seen. Fig. 8(b) and (c) shows the TDOS of the dye and dye@TiO2 for the set of single-bond dyes and double-bond dyes.
 Fig. 8  Partial density of states of TiO2 and density of states of dye@TiO2. 
The bandgap of the TiO2 surface was lowered subsequent to the dye adsorption with a concomitant lowering of the TiO2 CB. This can be explained in terms of the generation of a favourable dipolar field at the interface to tune the band energy levels of the surface TiO2, which is due to charge transfer between TiO2 and the dye molecules. This bandgap reduction for the TiO2 surface should facilitate electron transport, as well as afford an increased gap between the LUMO of the dyes and the CB of TiO2, which leads to an increased driving force for charge injection at the interface.
In both single- and double-bonded dyes, there was a shift in the spectrum due to dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2. The energy bandgaps of dye-adsorbed TiO2 are listed in Table 5. The bandgap of TiO2 decreased upon dye adsorption.
3.10 Reorganization energy and chemical reactivity parameters
The reorganisation energy (Λtotal) in the excited state is a measure of the amount of energy required for the structural relaxation of dyes from the excited to the ground states. According to the Marcus electron transfer theory,60 as stated in eqn (2), (2)All the parameters on the right-hand side of eqn (2) are constant, except for the reorganization energy (Λtotal). The Λtotal can be obtained by calculating the sum of the hole (Λh) and the electron (Λe) reorganization energies, using the following eqn (3)–(5): Λe = (En− − Ea) + (E0a − En)(3) Λh = (En+ − Ec) + (E0c − En)(4) Λtotal = Λe + Λh(5)Small Λtotal values imply relatively minimal structural relaxation in the excited state, which favours increments in the short circuit current densities of the sensitizers.61 The calculated reorganization energies for Λe, Λh and Λt at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level are tabulated in Table 6. Generally, the reorganization energy is classified into two types: external reorganization energy (Λext) and internal reorganization energy (Λint). Here, we focus mainly on Λint, which refers to the geometric changes in the molecules in neutral, anionic and cationic states. In the case of double-bonded linkers, Λtot was significantly lowered, hence it is assumed that the short circuit current density can be improved for them. Additionally, the Λe and Λh values of TC4 and TC4′′ were found to be the least among those of the designed dyes TC1 to TC5 and TC1′′ to TC5′′, implying that TC4 has better hole and electron mobilities. For the 10 investigated dyes, the λ values increased (and thus the hole transfer decreased) in the following order: TC2 = TC3 > TC1 > TC5 > TC4; TC3′′ > TC2′′ = TC5′′ > TC1′′ > TC4′′ for single-bonded and double-bonded linkers, respectively. For all the dyes, Λh was smaller than Λe, and these dyes showed better hole transport performances.

The chemical reactivity parameters such as electronegativity (χ), chemical potential (μ), electrophilicity index (ω) and chemical hardness (ξ) were determined by neutral and ionic molecular energies (in eV) for the description of molecular properties of the system (Table 7).62 Chemical hardness (ξ = (IP − A)/2) is a term that describes resistance to the intramolecular charge transfer; therefore, a lower chemical hardness (ξ) is preferred.63 The double bonded linker showed a lower ξ as compared to the single-bonded linker. It is suggested in the literature that the best current density (JSC) is obtained when ξ and ΔGinject are smaller.64 The low ΔGinject value corresponds to EL closer to the TiO2 conduction band, which means efficient overlap of orbitals for the conduction of the electrons. Herein, TC1′′ dye has the lowest ξ and closest LUMO energy level to TiO2.

The chemical potential (μ) is the escaping tendency of an electron cloud from a system at equilibrium, whereas χ is the electron-accepting ability of the molecule (eqn (6) and (7)) μ = (IP + A)/2(6) χ = −(IP + A)/2(7)The greater the electrochemical potential, the more reactive is the compound. Hence, sensitizers with higher μ and χ values are likely to be preferable candidates for DSSC. The chemical potential of TC1′′ is 4.295 eV. This is the highest value among all the dyes. The μ and χ parameters do not have a significant variation except in the sign. The double-bond-linked spacers have slightly increased μ and χ values than the single-bonded linkers except for TC4′′ and TC5′′
The electrophilicity index (ω) values were obtained by eqn (8). ω = μ2/2ξ(8)According to Parr et al., ω measures the stabilization energy of the system owing to the utmost electron flow from the donor to the acceptor units.65 As we have seen in the case of μ and χ, double-bonded linkers showed better ω than single-bonded spacers. Of all the dyes, TC1′′ had a greater electrophilicity index and this was also supported well by the electronegativity and chemical potential, which are higher as compared to other systems. Therefore, TC1′′ has the best stabilization energy and electron-withdrawing ability, implying that it has the best charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO; therefore, we expect to have good JSC values. Finally, χ and IP were already incorporated to obtain the rest of the chemical reactivity parameters and were redundant.
3.11 Theoretical background and photovoltaic parameters
The PCE of the DSSC can be computed using the following formula: (9)where FF is the fillfactor and Pin represents the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2).
The maximum voltage that can be obtained under open-circuit conditions from a DSSC is known as the open-circuit voltage (VOC). It is expressed by the energy gap between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 CB and I−/I3− redox couple under illumination.66 It can be determined using the empirical eqn (10): (10)The constant value 0.3 is ascribed to the voltage loss arising from the quasi-Fermi energies of electrons and holes within the HOMO and LUMO of the donor and acceptor moieties of the dye.67 It is also noteworthy that all VOC values are positive, which implies that electrons will be readily transferred from dyes to the CB of TiO2. As a result, all the designed dyes can be used for sensitization.68 The increasing order of the predicted VOC of the investigated dyes are TC1 > TC3 > TC2 > TC4 > TC5, respectively, for single-bonded spacer dyes, while the order of double-bonded spacer dyes is TC1′′ > TC3′′ = TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC5′′. All of the designed dyes TC1–TC4 and TC1′′–TC4′′ have larger predicted VOC values as compared to that of TC5.
The JSC can be evaluated using the following expression:69 (11)The factors affecting JSC are light-harvesting efficiency (LHE(λ)), relative photon flux density (ϕph.AM.1.5G(λ)) and electron injection (ϕinj), dye regeneration (Greg), electron collection (ηcoll) efficiencies, respectively. It is reasonable to assume that ηcoll is the same for the fabricated DSSCs with only different dyes.70
The first factor LHE, which influences JSC, can be obtained using the formula LHE = 1 − 10−f(12)Generally, The LHE value of sensitizers should be high and close to unity for efficient photovoltaic performance. The LHE values are in the following order: TC3′′ > TC1′′ > TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC5′′ and TC3 > TC1 > TC2 > TC4 > TC5. As shown in the table, LHEs for all the dyes are significantly better as compared to TC5, which is exciting because the designed dyes have better light-harvesting capability across the solar radiation spectrum. It is worth noting that the LHE of the sensitizers increases with an increase in the redshift of the absorption, as shown in Table 6. As expected, the incorporated double-bonded linkers showed better light-harvesting properties, with the dye architecture having the best value of 0.952 for the TC3′′ dye.
(ΔGreg) is another parameter that can quantitively determine the efficiency of regeneration of dyes via the redox electrolyte. The ΔGreg can be calculated using the following equation: ΔGreg = EI−/I3− − EHOMO(13)where EI−/I3−is the redox potential of the redox electrolyte (−4.8 eV). The EHOMO of all dyes were found to be lower than that of EI−/I3−, guaranteeing sufficient thermodynamic driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye after the photoexcitation of electrons into the LUMO level of the dye.71 As shown in Table 6, the ΔGreg values are in the range of 0.17–0.54 eV with a maximum driving force for the TC1 dye.
Another factor that affects.is inj, which can be correlated with the thermodynamic driving force (ΔGinj) for the injection of an electron from the LUMO level of the dye into the CB of TiO2; generally, a higher ΔGinj leads to a greater ϕinj.
ΔGinj can be estimated using the following relation: (14) is the CB energy level (−4.0 eV),  represents the excited state oxidation potential of the dye and is obtained using the relation (15)Islam et al.72 have shown that ΔGinj must be greater than 0.2 eV for the oxidized dye to guarantee effective electron injection. Results show that all the dyes exhibited bare minimum Ginject values in the range of 0.5–1.1 eV, and are capable of injecting electrons into the CB of TiO2 from ELUMO of the dye. The calculated Edye* follows the sequence TC1 > TC2 > TC3 > TC4 > TC5 and TC1′′ > TC3′′ > TC2′′ > TC4′′ > TC5′′. The larger  leads to a stronger driving force for electron injection. Among all the dyes, TC1 and TC1′′ have maximum ΔGinj of −0.56 and −0.52 eV, which promote their efficient electron injection into the TiO2 surface. It is clear from the table that ΔGinj becomes more negative in the case of single-bond-linked spacers than the double-bonded linkers.
The excited-state lifetime (τ) of the dyes can be obtained by the following equation, and they are inversely related to the oscillator strength and excitation energy of the first excited state (E, cm−1). The obtained results show that single-bonded linkers exhibit a higher lifetime than double-bonded π-spacers.  where τ is inversely related to f and E.73
The exceptionally high values of the excited state lifetimes for TC5 and TC5′′ are due to their poor oscillator strengths. According to reports, increasing the excited state lifetime will reduce charge recombination and improve the efficiency of solar cells.74 The reduced lifetime of double-bonded linkers as compared to single bond linkers could be the reason for the lower VOC of these dyes.75
Bar diagrams representing the trends of dyes based on the summary of important parameters to anticipate the best dye in the set TC1–TC5 and TC1′′–TC5′′ are shown in Fig. 9. TC1 and TC1′′, having benzothiadiazole, exerted positive impacts such as high values of λc, LHE, f, ΔGreg, ω, μ and dipole moment properties, and low values of EH–L and ς. As a result, the benzathiadiazole spacer is expected to show enhanced photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a series of 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA-based sensitizers with five different π-spacers were investigated by the DFT/TD-DFT approach in DCM solvent. The satisfactory agreement between the experimental and calculated efficiency parameters of the TC5 reference dye led to a detailed analysis of the optoelectronic properties of a series of different π-spacers. The findings revealed that the choice of π-linkers had a remarkable effect on the lowest-energy optical absorption properties, energy level alignment and other electronic properties, and was rationalized by DFT/TD-DFT methods. All designed dyes showed better photoelectric properties as compared to the model compound TC5. The absorption spectra covered the 560–690 nm region with adequate oscillator strength and LHE. As compared to the π-linker in the model TC5 dye, all of the spacers displayed red shifts in the absorption maxima and improved the f value and hence LHE in the designed sensitizers. The heterocyclic molecules introduced as π-spacers had more positive effects on the TPA dyes, such as reduced EH–Lgap, red shift of the solar spectrum, and improved LHE, VOC and Ginj. The double bond-joined linker had a positive impact on many of the properties, including λc, f, LHE, Λtotal, ω and EH–L, thus boosting the photovoltaic properties. The calculated dipole moments for the dyes correlated well with the observed absorption bands of the UV-Vis spectra and the best value was that of the TC1′′ dye. The dye/(TiO2)100 anatase surface systems were also simulated to find the dye adsorption energy. The negative adsorption energy ensures the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption of dyes onto the TiO2(1 0 1) surface.
Although the nature of the relationship between the theoretically determined properties and structure of dyes is inherently multifaceted, TC1 & TC1′′ dyes with the benzothiadiazole spacer exhibited a good balance in many of the properties. Our results provide useful theoretical guidance for future molecular design of 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA-based organic dyes for further DSSC optimizations without sacrificing many resources.
