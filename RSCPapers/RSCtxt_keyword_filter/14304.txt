    , Accepted 13th November 2017First published on 13th November 2017AbstractIt is of great practical significance to realize the efficient treatment of wastewater and the comprehensive utilization of chemical energy from wastewater. Therefore, a WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O nanowire arrays (NWAs) visible-light response dual-photoelectrodes solar-charged photoelectrochemical wastewater fuel cell (scPEWFC) was constructed for efficient hydrogen production based on the promotion of phenol oxidation at the anode. The hydrogen production reaches as high as 93.08 μmol cm−2 by the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of phenol (TOC removal rate reached 82.12%) of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs under visible light irradiation for 8 h without additional bias, which is 3.02 times higher than that of pure photocatalytic water splitting. The excellent photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to the less endergonic process of phenol oxidation compared to water oxidation, which indicated that phenol oxidation can promote the hydrogen generation at the cathode. Isotopic labelling experiments show that protons were derived from the splitting of water rather than phenol. Interestingly, WO3 (with great electrons storage property) and photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) were combined to construct a scPEWFC, the hydrogen production (4 h to produce 7.50 μmol cm−2) was still carried out at the cathode under the dark owing to the stored electrons of WO3 under the light, which realized the ideal effect of full-day and high-efficiency hydrogen production. Besides, the mechanism of scPEWFC operation was investigated in detail. This paper provides a new research idea for scPEWFC wastewater treatment, energy recovery, electron storage, and simultaneous full-day hydrogen production.
1 Introduction
With industrialization, globalization and manufacturing expanding at an alarming rate in the past decades, a large amount of organic chemicals have been discharged into water bodies causing serious environmental pollution, especially low concentrate and highly toxic pollutants that seriously threaten human health and social development. Therefore, the development of highly efficient methods of purifying water pollutants is the focus of research and attention from both industry and academia.1–7 In fact, researchers have found that wastewater containing high levels of organics is an excellent electron donor, which could be an ideal available energy source.8–10 In addition, traditional wastewater treatment technologies, such as activated carbon adsorption, membrane separation, Fenton and ozone oxidation technology,11 have obtained excellent treatment results. Unfortunately, the separation, enrichment, degradation and destruction of pollutants were main strategy of traditional wastewater treatment, which focused on efficient treatment of wastewater, not comprehensive utilization of wastewater and ignored a huge amount chemical energy in the wastewater. Therefore, a prominent topic is how to efficiently process wastewater and to reuse the electrons produced by wastewater oxidation.12
A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a kind of device that utilizes microorganisms to convert chemical energy from organic matter directly into electrical energy, and has wide application prospects in wastewater treatment and new energy development.13–19 However, due to the relatively low current efficiency, the electrons are difficult to store, thus researchers have switched to producing hydrogen with MFCs combined with electrocatalysis or photocatalysis effectively. Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) and MFCs were combined to achieve electricity or hydrogen generation, using wastewater and solar light as the only energy sources in previous research.20 A self-biased solar-driven microbial photoelectrochemical cell that coupled a bacterial-colonizing bioanode with a semiconductor nanowire cathode to achieve the goal of microbial electricity generation was also reported.21 However, it is difficult to deal with some persistent and biodegradable organic matter with MFCs, such as azo dyes, due to its biological tolerance. In addition, the performance of MFCs are still limited by the internal resistance of proton mass transfer and oxygen reduction kinetics. The harsh conditions of microbiological culture, enrichment, training and operating environments, low efficiency of electronic transmission and the complex research mechanism have limited MFCs actual large-scale applications.22–24
PECs provide a powerful means of harnessing solar energy for the production of clean hydrogen fuels by photoelectrochemical reactions, without additional energy input.25–27 The early studies focused on single semiconductor electrode PECs.28 Subsequently, researchers have proposed a Z-scheme type dual photoelectrode photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC),29–32 which was mainly composed of n and p-type semiconductors as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively. The Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor was more negative than that of the p-type semiconductor, an interior bias can be produced to drive the electrons to combine with the holes of the photocathode from the external circuit from photoanode.33 A visible-light responsive photocatalytic fuel cell was constructed based on WO3/W or TiO2/Ti photoanode and C/Cu2O photocathode for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation by simulating the Z-scheme system.22,34 Early research was mainly used to treat wastewater and electricity production, but because of the unstable energy output it cannot be utilized directly. A solar-driven photocatalytic fuel cell with a dual photoelectrode for simultaneous wastewater treatment and hydrogen production was constructed in our previous study.8 In addition, the influencing factors of PECs such as electrode materials and target pollutants were investigated. The Z-scheme structure of the simulated dual photoelectrode can effectively separate electrons and holes for the simultaneous degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production to achieve the effective utilization of electrons from pollutant oxidation in the wastewater under light and without an additional power supply, and accordingly hydrogen production efficiency was also significantly greater than MFC.35–37 As previously known, this construction of heterostructures can effectively facilitate the charge separation and transfer, shorten the radial transfer path, and effectively reduce the charge recombination. Highly efficient photocatalytic H2 generation under visible-light was investigated based on MoS2/CdS nanosheets-on-nanorod and MoS2/CdS nanodots-on-nanorods, which exhibit an excellent H2 evolution rate and apparent quantum yield.38,39
Although an excellent performance was achieved in PEC applications, the formed electrons and holes must be consumed immediately and require continuous illumination to ensure the photocatalytic reaction can be carried out throughout the reaction period. Therefore, the biggest limitation of the traditional photocatalysts is the need for continuous light energy input. In reality, however, the photocatalytic efficiency is closely related to the solar intensity of the day, while the light is not always present, and the electrons cannot be stored. So we envisioned the simultaneous collection and storage of solar energy for using in the dark. If the excited photogenerated electrons can be stored under light illumination, it can not only reduce the recombination of the photogenerated carriers, but can also continue to release the stored electrons for hydrogen production in the dark to convert solar energy into chemical energy, to enhance the efficiency of solar energy conversion, and further expand the application of solar energy in a certain extent.
Recently, the applicability of solar energy was extended to the dark stage by integrating light harvesting and the energy storage system. A self-photorechargeability of the WO3 film was fabricated under visible light irradiation,40–43 which can store and release on-demand.44 Photocatalysts with storage capacity such as WO3 or MoO3 have been developed, and photoelectrons of TiO2 can be transferred and stored in the conduction band of WO3 or MoO3 under UV irradiation and then the stored electrons are released from WO3 or MoO3 for specific reactions in the dark.45 In most research work, TiO2 and WO3 were combined into a composite photoelectrode.41,46–49 The electrons in the TiO2 conduction band were implanted and stored in the WO3 framework under UV irradiation, and then the stored electrons were released from WO3 to reduce oxygen to H2O2 and H2O in the dark. Similar charge storage phenomena have been reported in the dye-sensitized TiO2–WO3 system. Upon illumination, excited electrons in the dye are injected into TiO2 and WO3 for electron storage. A solar rechargeable battery (solar water battery) was reported based on photoelectrochemical water oxidation, which is environmentally friendly and can provide an alternative to conventional photoelectrochemical water splitting.50 The TiO2 acting as a photoelectrode was excited and generated an electron–hole pair. Then the photogenerated electrons in the TiO2–PE were transferred to the WO3–SE through an external circuit and stored in situ and then released electrons to the Pt–CE for the reduction of hydrogen production in the dark. Dye-TiO2/electrolyte/Ni/WO3 dye-sensitized solar rechargeable batteries were constructed by the sol–gel method, which possessed a higher energy density than similar materials.51
Therefore, in our work, a solar-charged photoelectrochemical fuel cell (scPEWFC) was constructed for phenol oxidization and hydrogen production and simultaneous electrons storage, which were performed in a single chamber photoelectrochemical cell quartz reactor. Visible light response WO3 NFs, C–Cu2O nanowire arrays (NWAs) were used as photoanode and photocathode, respectively. The potential of the WO3 NFs photoanode was higher than that of the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode, resulting in the potential difference to spontaneously drive the photogenerated electrons of the WO3 NFs photoanode to the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode from the external circuit to combine with the holes at the photocathode under the light, the holes of the photoanode and electrons of the photocathode can therefore be released for organics degradation and water reduction. At the same time, the remaining photogenerated electrons were stored in the framework of WO3 NFs structure for continuous discharge and hydrogen production throughout the day.
2 Experimental section

The tungsten foil (99.95%, 0.05 mm thick) and copper mesh (100 mesh, 0.11 mm dia wire) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (China) Chemical Co., Ltd. Sulphuric acid (AR, 98%), sodium hydroxide (AR, 99%), sodium fluoride (AR, 99%), sodium sulfate (AR, 98%), ethanol (AR, 99.5%), acetone (AR, 99.5%) and isopropanol (AR, 99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd., SCRC, China. Phenol (D6, 98%) was purchased from CIL Cambridge isotope laboratories Inc.
2.2 Preparation of WO3 NFs photoelectrode
WO3 NFs photoanode was prepared by anodizing according to the literature.44 The tungsten foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%, 0.05 mm thick) was cut into 1.5 × 5.0 cm pieces and then polished to a mirror with 180 Cw, 300 Cw, 600 Cw and metallographic sandpaper to remove rust and oxide on the surface, rinsed with distilled water, and ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water, acetone, ethanol, isopropanol and distilled water for 10 min, respectively. The anodizing device is composed of two electrode systems with a platinum foil as the counter electrode (cathode) and the tungsten foil as the working electrode (anode); the distance between the cathode and the anode was kept constantly at 2 cm. The tungsten foil was anodized at a constant potential (+50 V) using a DC power supply (Sovotek, E5200-3 75v/2A DC Power Supply, Da Hua Electronic, China) for 70 min (50 min, 60 min, 80 min, 90 min) under controlled magnetic stirring at a temperature of 15 °C and the electrolyte solution containing 1 mol L−1 H2SO4 and 0.5 wt% NaF. After the anodization process, the samples were soaked in distilled water and ethanol for 30 min, then rinsed with distilled water, and dried in air. Afterwards the WO3 films were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air atmosphere, the rate of heating was maintained at 2 °C min−1 and they were naturally cooled to room temperature.
2.3. Preparation of C/Cu2O NWAs photoelectrode
Copper mesh (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 0.11 mm dia wire) was cut into pieces about 1.5 cm × 5 cm and sonicated in acetone, deoxygenated deionized water and absolute ethanol for 15 min and dried in air. The Cu(OH)2NWs were prepared by the constant current anodic method in a conventional three electrodes system using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc., USA) with the electrolytes solution containing 3 mol L−1 sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature.52 Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and the copper mesh as the working electrode. Cu(OH)2 NWs were produced by anodizing at a constant current of 10 mA cm−2 for 30 min, and the electrode potential was stabilized at −0.24 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the initial stage. When the potential changed suddenly, it was considered that the anodizing has been completed. The prepared Cu(OH)2NWs were rinsed with deionized water, dried in a vacuum and then immersed in a glucose solution at a concentration of 3 g L−1 for 1 min, then taken out and dried at room temperature. The glucose-loaded Cu(OH)2 NWs were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in N2 atmosphere, the rate of heating was maintained at 4 °C min−1, finally at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and then decreased to room temperature to obtain the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode.
2.4. Materials characterization
The detailed morphology and microstructure features of the samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM2100, JEOL, Japan, using a JEM-2000EX electron microscope operated at 200 kV). The composition and structure of the samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Germany), using a Cu target: λ = 1.540598 Å; tube voltage 40 kV; tube current 60 mA; scanning speed 2° min−1. The composition, structure and bonding conditions of the samples were characterized and tested by Raman spectroscopy (514 nm laser with RM100). UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS, Avantes, Netherlands) was used to determine the optical absorption properties of the sample electrodes.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical properties of the sample electrodes were tested on a CHI660C electrochemical station (CH Instruments Inc., USA) by using a conventional three-electrode system at room temperature, the sample electrode, Pt, Ag/AgCl electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. PEC is achieved using a two-electrode device. A 300 W high voltage Xe lamp (Changtuo, China) was used as a simulated solar light source (wavelength range of 420–800 nm, light intensity of 100 mW cm−2) in a single chamber photoelectrochemical quartz reactor. No further description was obtained, all experiments are carried out under the AM1.5 filter. The photoanode and photocathode working area was 2 cm2, with moderate agitation and no external voltage. Before the test, it was necessary to continuously pass nitrogen into the electrolyte for 30 min to remove other impurities such as dissolved oxygen in the solution. The I–V characteristic curve was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a sweep speed of 0.02 V s−1. The power density (P) is calculated as follows: P = I × V. Under the irradiation of AM 1.5, the degradation of the organic compound was carried out in a quartz reactor. Phenol (20 mg L−1) was used as the target organic compound with the electrolytes solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. The removal rate of phenol total organic carbon was monitored by the N/C3100 TOC/TNb analyzer (Analytikjena, Germany). The total hydrogen amount produced was calculated by multiplying the hydrogen content in a 1 mL gas sample by the headspace volume of the PEC reactor (200 mL). Hydrogen was qualitatively measured by gas chromatography (GC 7900, Techcomp, Shanghai, China), with N2 as the carrier gas, a TCD detector, a column temperature of 80 °C, a detector temperature of 150 °C, an inlet port temperature of 130 °C and sample volume of 1 ml. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Agilent 6890/5973 N, Agilent Co) was utilized to detect the D2, DH and H2.
3 Results and discussion
3.1. Anode oxidation for phenol efficient conversion
As shown in Fig. 1A, the TOC removal rate of phenol of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs was 82.12% in the first 8 h under AM 1.5 illumination, which is higher than that of WO3 NFs–Pt (TOC removal rate 52.5%). The reason for this efficient oxidation is similar to that reported in the literature. Under such conditions, a simulated Z-scheme type dual photoelectrode scPEWFC was constructed. Due to the presence of the Fermi level difference, the photogenerated electrons of the photoanode were migrated to the photocathode to combine the holes at the photocathode, so that the photogenerated electrons and holes were difficult to recombine, the catalytic oxidation efficiency of phenol has been greatly improved. After illumination for 8 h, the whole system was kept in the dark for 8 h. The TOC removal of phenol did not changed whether the photoanode and photocathode were disconnected or not. It is speculated that in the absence of a light source, holes were produced in the anode, the entire anode lacks the oxide species, so the phenol will not be further removed in the dark.
 Fig. 1  The TOC removal rate (A) of phenol (20 mg L−1) for scPEWFC under light illumination and dark. The I–V characteristic curve (B) (red) and power density curve (blue) of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs scPEWFC. The I–V curves were performed by linear sweep voltammetry with a two electrode system in one typical cycle. The scan rate was 0.05 V s−1. The photocurrent density (C) and the open-circuit voltage (D) of the WO3 photoanode and C/Cu2O photocathode were measured in the dark and under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The I–t characteristics curves (E), LSV (F) were recorded with no external bias from the scPEWFC using two electrode configuration under AM1.5 illumination in the 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution containing 20 mg L−1 phenol (the red solid line) and without phenol (the black solid line). The amount of hydrogen production and TOC removal rate (G) were recorded in the 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution containing different concentration phenol. The deuterium-labelling phenol (D6, 20 mg L−1) and no-labelling phenol (H) were performed to prove the source of hydrogen. 
In Fig. 1C, it is also shown that the photocurrent of the single WO3 NFs photocathode is very small, but the photocurrent density of C/Cu2O NWAs can reach 0.37 mA cm−2, and the short circuit current (JSC) of scPEWFC is 0.42 mA cm−2, which is greater than the sum of the two, and these values are also larger than those reported in the literature.34 Therefore, it can be inferred that the cathode and anode of the constructed scPEWFC have a synergistic effect, which confirm that the cell performance of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs is superior.53,54 In such a simulated Z-scheme system, the electron/hole pairs were separated effectively at the two photoelectrodes. The holes of WO3 NFs photoanode and the electrons of C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode can be released for the oxidation of the phenol and the reduction of the proton to produce hydrogen, respectively. In addition, after five cycle tests of dark and light, the photocurrent density almost remains stable, which indicated that the WO3 NFs photoanode has a good photoelectrochemical response, photocurrent stability and anti-corrosive properties. However, when Pt foil is the cathode, the photocurrent is relatively low, due to the cell being constructed without a Z-scheme. At the same time, the photovoltage was also measured. As shown in Fig. 1D, the photovoltage of WO3 NFs photoanode is almost low, and exhibits a relatively slow photoresponse. However, the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode displays an excellent photoresponse (photovoltage increases instantly to 0.15 V and remains stable). The open-circuit voltage (VOC) of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs scPEWFC is 0.26 V. In other words, WO3 NFs photoanode provide a negative bias for the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode, while the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode offered a positive bias for the WO3 NFs photoanode. As the WO3 NFs photoanode Fermi level is more negative than that of the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode, an interior bias can be produced to drive the electrons of WO3 NFs to a C/Cu2O NWAs electrode without the external conditions.
The Mott–Schottky curve of the WO3 NFs photoelectrode is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which illustrates the relationship between 1/C2 and the applied potential. The WO3 NFs electrode is characterized by a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plot, which means the sample is an n-type semiconductor material. The tangent portion of the curve intersects with 1/C2 = 0 at the flat potential EFB of the WO3 NFs photoelectrode and it can be estimated that the EFB of WO3 NFs is 0.30 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a Na2SO4 solution. Meanwhile, the WO3 NFs electrode photocarrier density can be calculated and presented with ND values of 4.47 × 1020 cm−3. Compared with other materials, WO3 NFs have a higher carrier concentration.55 The results show that the WO3 NFs photoelectrode has a very high photocatalytic oxidation ability, excellent photoresponse and a rapid charge transfer rate.
3.2 Cathode reduction for sustainable hydrogen production
In the system, the oxidation of phenol was performed at the anode, meanwhile efficient hydrogen production was operated at the cathode. Many of the studies in the literature reported that the hydrogen production efficiency of the cathode is limited by anodic oxidation,54,56,57 in other words, the whole system, the oxidation of the anode phenol is the rate-limiting step.
From the thermodynamic point of view, the oxidation potential of lots of organic pollutants is lower than that of water. Therefore, phenol was selected as a representative organic pollutant to study the degradation performance of the scPEWFC. In fact, we are also very interested in studying the effect of different pollutants oxidation on the hydrogen production of the cathode, and the relevant work was also carried out. In the previous work, two classes of typical pollutants, phenols and alkylbenzenes, were treated using a self-biasing PEC cell to reveal the intrinsic relationships between the redox properties of the pollutants and hydrogen production.58 The photocatalytic oxidation of phenol and simultaneous hydrogen production were studied by using phenol as the oxidizing substrate and the WO3 NFs electrode as the photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs as the photocathode. The i–t curve was determined in the two-electrode system in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution containing 20 mg L−1 phenol under the AM1.5 filter irradiation (100 mW cm−2), without an external bias as shown in Fig. 1E. With the prolongation of illumination time, the photocurrent density tends to increase gradually. In the initial absence of light, the photocurrent density was almost zero, and then the light was applied, the photocurrent density increases slowly with time, then gradually stabilized and remained at 0.523 mA cm−2 after 4 h operation. For comparison, the system was tested without phenol and was added into the 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Correspondingly, the photocurrent density was significantly lower than with the presence of phenol. After keeping in the dark for 8 h, the photocurrent was measured again, a similar result occurs. In the test for hydrogen production, it was notable that the amount of hydrogen production was about 30.74 μmol cm−2 in the absence of phenol. In contrast, in the presence of phenol (20 mg L−1), the amount of hydrogen production reached 79.58 μmol cm−2 as seen in Fig. 1G. Some literature studies also reported that the nature of the pollution as well as its concentration also had a great influence on the performance of PEC hydrogen production from the biomass derivative and water.57 With the increase of pollutant concentration, the hydrogen production effect was obviously enhanced. This also illustrates that the oxidation of phenol at the anode did play a decisive role in the hydrogen production of the cathode, the electrons of the anodic oxidation transferred to the cathode to raise the photocurrent density, and accordingly enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production. Therefore, the oxidation reaction of the anode was easier to proceed, and the efficiency of hydrogen production was more obvious.
In order to understand the effect of phenol and optimize the scPEWFC activity for phenol oxidation over the WO3 NFs photoanode, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the as-prepared photoanode were performed in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution containing 20 mg L−1 phenol, whether with illumination or not. As shown in Fig. 1F, the WO3 NFs showed a higher current density in the phenol solution (0.09 mA cm−2) than that of without phenol (0.04 mA cm−2) under dark conditions at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). When the surface of the electrode was irradiated with simulated sunlight, the current density of the WO3 NFs photoelectrode was significantly increased to 0.92 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The results indicated that phenol was more easily oxidized under simulated solar excitation, and the oxidation potential was 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (lower than water oxidation), which explained the reason for the phenol oxidation at the anode to promote cathode hydrogen production at the cathode.
In addition, it is possible that hydrogen can be derived from the splitting of water or degradation of phenol, so a comparative experiment was carried out using deuterium-labelled phenol (D6, 20 mg L−1) to prove the source of the hydrogen. Using GC-MS analysis, only H2 is detected and no DH or D2 is detected during the photoelectrocatalysis experiment (as shown in Fig. 1H), so it can be illustrated that hydrogen is derived from the water splitting.
3.3 The relationship between electrons storage of WO3 and hydrogen production
In Fig. 1E, when the cathode and anode were disconnected and remained in the dark for 8 h, and then connected to the cathode and the anode again, it was apparent that the photocurrent was observed significantly, and higher than the initial dark current. WO3 NFs photocharging characteristics are reported in many studies in the literature, so it can be speculated that part of the excited electrons were stored within the WO3 NFs electrode in the system (the shaded area below the discharge curve corresponds to the total stored charges) and were discharged in the dark. Therefore, it was concluded that when the WO3 NFs were used as scPEWFC anode material, the characteristics of light-charging remained and the mechanism is explained as follows: WO3 + hν → WO3(h+ + e−)(1) Cu2O + hν → Cu2O(h+ + e−)(2) WO3 + xNa+ + xe− → NaXWO3(3) C6H5OH + H2O + 28h+ → 6CO2 + 28H+(4) e− + h+ → hν(5) 2H+ + 2e− → H2(6) NaXWO3 → WO3 + xNa+ + xe−(7) 2H+ + 2e− → H2(8) C6H5OH + 11H2O → 6CO2 + 14H2(9)
Fig. S2 (ESI†) describes the schematic plots of photocharging and discharging processes of WO3 NFs during light and dark conditions. The photogenerated electron–hole pairs were formed under simulative solar light illumination. When the WO3 NFs were excited (eqn (1)) the part of the photo-excited electrons can be neutralized by the intercalation of the existing Na+ in the electrolyte solution in the form of NaXWO3, which was stored within the WO3 framework in situ (eqn (3)). The phenol molecules adsorbed on the electrode surface were oxidized to CO2 by the holes generated on the WO3 electrode (eqn (4)). The carbon-coated C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh also generated electron–hole pairs under the simulative solar light illumination (eqn (2)). The n-type semiconductor WO3 NFs (Eg = 2.75 eV), p-type semiconductor C/Cu2O NWAs (Eg = 2.4 eV), and the relative band positions for the WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs visible-light response dual-photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). According to the principle of energy level matching, the Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor WO3 NFs was higher than that of the p-type semiconductor C/Cu2O NWAs. Accordingly, the potential of the WO3 NFs photoanode was higher than that of the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode under AM 1.5 illumination, and the interior bias was generated and drives the electrons of WO3 NFs photoanode to combine with the holes of the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode from the external circuit (eqn (5)). The holes of the WO3 NFs photoanode and the electrons of the C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode can be released for the oxidation of the phenol at the anode and the reduction of the proton to produce hydrogen at the cathode (eqn (6) and (8)). Afterwards, Na+ de-intercalate from the WO3 NFs structure (eqn (7)), then stored electrons were released and transferred to the C/Cu2O NWAs counter electrode to produce hydrogen (eqn (8)). Meanwhile, the structure of the Z-scheme is more favorable for the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and enhances the efficiency of the photoelectrocatalysis conversion.
In order to prove that Na+ was embedded into the framework of WO3 NFs under AM 1.5 illumination, XRD was used to characterize the variety of WO3 NFs frameworks before and after charging and discharging process in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution containing 20 mg L−1 phenol, as shown in Fig. 2A. The three peaks of 2θ = 23.119°, 23.586° and 24.380° corresponding to the (002), (020) and (200) planes are characteristic peaks for the monoclinic phase of WO3. After performing three charge–discharge cycles, the characteristic peaks shift to a lower 2θ value, which is associated with the structural change of a tetragonal structure and which is related to the embedding of the alkaline cations as discussed in the literature.59,60 Therefore, the results further demonstrate the presence of trapped alkali cations in the framework of WO3 NFs in situ. Raman spectroscopy was also used to study the structural variety in a higher symmetry caused by intercalation of the alkaline cations. Fig. 2B shows the Raman spectra of the WO3 NFs photoelectrode after the three charge–discharge cycles in the Na2SO4 electrolyte containing 20 mg L−1 phenol. The Raman shift peaks at 807 cm−1 and 714 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching modes arising from the W–O framework in monoclinic WO3.61,62 It is possible to determine initially that the electrode was in a monoclinic phase γ-WO3. The peak at 807 cm−1 is hardly altered by the phase transition, while the mode at 714 cm−1 is highly sensitive to the embedded ions, which reflects the structural changes caused by the embedded ions. When the WO3 NFs were irradiated for 8 h, the peak intensity at 714 cm−1 decreased, which is associated with the changes in the WO3 host (to a more symmetrical structure (tetragonal)) and is ascribed to the symmetrisation of W–O bonds along the a–b plane of the WO6 octahedron.59,63,64 When the WO3 NFs were discharged for 4 h, the intensity of the peak at 714 cm−1 is restored to the original state. Therefore, the greater the decrease in the Raman intensity of the 714 cm−1 peak, the more trapped alkali cations are stored within the WO3 structure, and the more electrons stored.

The mechanism of scPEWFC photo-charging and discharging (Na+ intercalation and deintercalation from the WO3 framework) was studied using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 2C depicts the CV response of WO3 before and after 10 min illumination. A significant oxidized peak (0.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl) was presented under the visible irradiation for 10 min, which was attributed to the phenol oxidization at the photoanode. The presence of other anode peaks (0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl) may be caused by the localised oxidation of W4+ to W5+ or W5+ to W6+, and was related to the photo-charging phenomenon, which reflected the discharging of stored electrons and simultaneous de-intercalation of alkali cations.65Fig. 2D is a UV-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of the WO3 NFs photoelectrode. It shows that the prepared WO3 NFs absorption band edge can reach about 450 nm, barely entering the visible light response range. The bandgap of 2.75 eV was calculated according to the formula, which is the same as that reported in the literature.66 While the absorption band is clearly redshifted to 550 nm and the absorption band of the visible light section is present, causing speculation that Na+ in the electrolyte solution were intercalated into the WO3 structure in situ in the form of tungsten bronze.
In addition, it can be speculated that the Na+ has been successfully embedded into the structural framework of WO3 after 10 min light from the EDS energy spectrum (as shown in Fig. 4H), which can explain the charge–discharge principle of the WO3 NFs electrode to a certain extent.
When the charges are being stored at the anode, the hydrogen is also being produced at the cathode simultaneously. The research method of the hydrogen production process is the same as the TOC removal. The amount of hydrogen production was 79.58 μmol cm−2 and showed a significant linear increase for 8 h under the AM 1.5 illumination. The anode and cathode were disconnected and kept in the dark for 8 h, and then connected to the cathode and the anode again, the hydrogen production increased to 12.5 μmol cm−2 for 4 h gradually as shown in Fig. 3A. In contrast, the dark process was not disconnected for 8 h, it can show that the amount of hydrogen were maintained at about 10 μmol cm−2 for 4 h without any change as shown in Fig. 3B. Considering the variety of TOC, it can be speculated that the main reason is that the photoelectrons of the WO3 NFs photocathode were separated from the holes after the illumination, and some of the photoelectrons of WO3 NFs photoanode were driven to combine with the holes of C/Cu2O NWAs photocathode from the external circuit to increase the utilization of the cathode photogenerated electrons. The other part of the photoelectrons was stored in the lattice of the anode WO3 NFs in situ. If the anode and cathode were not connected in the dark for 8 h, then the electrons stored in the WO3 NFs will be transferred to the cathode for hydrogen production in situ, which has been stored in the reactor all the time, so the amount of hydrogen essentially remained stable when it was detected. On the contrary, if the dark process was disconnected for 8 h, it can be seen that the amount of hydrogen production increased gradually after connecting the two electrodes. During the process of disconnection, the electrons at the anode have been stored without discharging, then the electrons stored on the anode will be transferred to the cathode through the external circuit after the reconnection, so that the stored electrons can continue to be utilized for hydrogen production under dark conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the photoelectrons can be introduced into the cathode to combine with the holes on the C/Cu2O NWAs; meanwhile, the photoelectrons were stored in situ to achieve the purpose of hydrogen production throughout the day even in the absence of light, and the utilization rate of stored electrons was 98.23%.

Therefore, it can found that the construction of csPEWFC can not only provide efficient oxidation of phenol, storage of electrons, but can also obtain hydrogen, with great significance for the environment and energy. The part of the photoelectrons generated by WO3 under photoexcitation was stabilized by the alkaline cations and stored within the WO3 framework in situ, and these changes of light-induced storage were utilized subsequently under dark conditions in a controllable manner. Therefore, the factors that affect the directional movement of alkaline cations can affect the WO3 NFs charging and discharging capacity, such as the type of alkaline cation, the size, the concentration of electrolyte, the surface resistance of the semiconductor WO3 NFs photoanode. The properties of the interface between the scPEWFC electrode and the electrolyte solution were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). First, the morphological structure of WO3 were studied by adjusting the anodizing time (50 min, 60 min, 70 min, 80 min and 90 min) to obtain the different structures of WO3.
Fig. S4 (ESI†) is the Nyquist curve of the WO3 photocathode prepared at different anodizing times. As can be seen from Fig. S4 (ESI†), the WO3 photoanode exhibits the minimum diameter of the semicircle under the conditions of 70 min, which indicated the optimal conductivity and fast electron transfer process occurred at its surface. This can also be speculated from its appearance as shown in Fig. 4. When the anodizing time was 50 min (Fig. 4A), WO3 was mainly composed of a broken nanotube network structure, and the pore structure was very obvious, but the nanotube fracture was severe, so its impedance increased evidently. When the anodizing time increased (60 min Fig. 4B), the morphology of the nanoflower was gradually displayed. Under the anodic conditions of 70 min (Fig. 4C), a dense nanostructure was formed, the surface was uniform and the resistance became smaller. The reason for this is that the nanotube had a high specific surface area that can generate more photogenerated carriers and adsorb more contaminants on the surface. At the same time, the petal structure was also more conducive to the absorption and utilization of light energy. Whereas, with the extension of the anodizing time (80 min Fig. 4D), the nanoflower structure became scarce. The possible reason is that the anodizing time was too long, and the existing nanoflowers were further etched, the lower part of the pipe network has been blocked. After increasing the anodizing time to 90 min (Fig. 4E), the nanostructure disappeared completely, while the underlying pipe network structure completely blocked, resulting in its increasing impedance. Fig. 4F and G are the SEM and TEM image of C/Cu2O NWAs, respectively. The diameter of C/Cu2O NWAs was about 500 nm, and it had smooth surfaces with no obvious fractures, the nanowires are densely grown on the Cu mesh surface, which greatly increases the surface area of the electrodes. The performance tests of the scPEWFC were carried out by using a two-electrode system. The I–V characteristic curve was measured by LSV with a sweep speed of 0.02 V s−1. The power density (P) is calculated as follows: P = I × V.
 Fig. 4  (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) are the SEM image of WO3 NFs at the time of anodization 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 min, respectively. (F and G) are the SEM and SAED spectrum of C/Cu2O NWAs. (H) is EDS elemental analysis of WO3 NFs after 10 min charging. 
In Fig. 1B, when the current density is 0.10 mA cm−2, the power density reaches a maximum (Pmax) of 0.015 mW cm−2. The fill factor (FF), which is also an important indicator of output characteristics of a photoelectrochemical cell, can be calculated based on these parameters using the following equation:  where Pmax and JSC × VOC represent the actual maximum power density and the theoretical maximum power density, respectively. JSC is the short-circuit current density and VOC is the open-circuit voltage. Table S1 (ESI†) lists the battery properties of WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs scPEWFC prepared at different anodizing times. These results also demonstrate that JSC exhibits a maximum value with the increase of anodic time. The removal of TOC and the amount of hydrogen production follow the same trend. The WO3 electrode (anodized for 70 min) gives the best performance, which can also be attributed to its surface microscopic structure.
The factors influencing the charge and discharge properties of WO3 were also investigated. As can be seen from Table S2 (ESI†), the electrolyte concentration is not larger when the charge and discharge performance is better. When the electrolyte concentration is 0.1 mol L−1, the optical photocurrent density reached the maximum. It is also indicated that WO3 stores more charge in a 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution and the amount of hydrogen in the dark also reached the maximum. To some extent, the charge stored in WO3 can be used efficiently for hydrogen production in the dark. It is speculated that the main reason for this is that the size of the alkaline cations themselves are different, so the rate of intercalation and de-intercalation of Na+ is different, so that the charge and discharge capacity is different. While the discharge speed will directly affect the dark current. Therefore, due to the different discharge speeds, the demand for alkaline cations concentration is different, as for Na+ itself, 0.1 mol L−1 is the optical concentration.
It can be found that the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production systems remained stable in the scPEWFC by performing three cycles testing of the hydrogen production and TOC removal (as shown in Fig. 5). The WO3 electrode was illuminated under the simulative solar light for 4.2 h and then discharged in the dark for 4.2 h. After three cycles, the electrodes showed good stability and recyclability for all three cycles.

5 Conclusions
In summary, a visibly responsive dual photoelectrode based on WO3 NFs–C/Cu2O NWAs scPEWFC was constructed for the simultaneous treatment of wastewater and hydrogen production. The scPEWFC performance parameters, the ability to deal with pollutants, hydrogen production and the mechanism of scPEWFC charging–discharging were systematically investigated. In the work, the hydrogen production of scPEWFC based on phenol oxidation is 3.02 times higher than that of pure photocatalytic water splitting, which indicated that the oxidation of phenol could effectively promote the hydrogen production. In addition, it was also shown that WO3 NFs still retains its photo-charging characteristics after visible light irradiation, and efficient and sustainable hydrogen production (7.50 μmol cm−2 in 4 h) in the dark (which realized the desired effect without external power supply), full-day efficiency and sustainable hydrogen production. The research work has extended the new application of scPEWFC for simultaneous wastewater treatment and hydrogen production in the dark, and provided some theoretical guidance for developing a novel, sustainable and green energy production route in the environmental and energy field.
