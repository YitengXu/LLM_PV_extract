The absorption, transmission, electrochemical, thermal and film properties were studied. The compounds showed panchromatic absorption in the spectral range of 300–1000 nm. Moreover, they also exhibited semi-transparent property in the visible region (400–700 nm). Small molecule photodetectors (SMPDs) based on M1 and M2 were fabricated and studied. For the SMPD with BCP as the hole blocking layer (HBL), a detectivity of 5.0 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm at −0.1 V was obtained, which is among the highest detectivities reported for NIR SMPDs. With a sufficiently thin silver electrode, visibly transparent PDs with an average transmittance of 45% in the visible region were obtained for the first time. The transparent PDs exhibited fairly constant and high detectivity between 1011 and 1012 Jones over a broad spectral range of 300–900 nm. In addition, side chains of the compounds exhibited a great influence on the device performance, which could be assigned to their film absorption coefficient, molecular packing and active layer morphology.
Introduction
Detection of optical signals in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) to near-infrared (NIR) spectral region or panchromatic detection is critically important for a variety of applications, including image sensing, remote control, environmental monitoring and night surveillance.1–3 Organic photodetectors (PDs) are being explored as attractive candidates for panchromatic detection, which attract increased interest and extensive advances for their many advantages such as large-area detection, room-temperature operation, low noise current, low-cost fabrication and flexible substrates.4–8 One of the main challenges currently is to find organic materials photovoltaic to the NIR light. At present, low-bandgap polymers and small molecules are often used as electron donor materials in organic NIR PDs. Polymer PDs have been explored for more than a decade and received much attention for some important breakthroughs in the past five years.6,7,11–14 For optoelectronic device applications, polymers should have key properties consistent from batch to batch and should be free of impurities such as residual metal catalysts and reagents.15,16 In comparison, small molecules can be readily obtained in high purity, have well-defined chemical structures and are usually processable using common organic solvents. For example, solution-processed small molecule solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) have recently been demonstrated.17,18 Regarding small molecule PDs (SMPDs), metal complexes and ionic dyes such as metallophthalocyanines, porphyrins and squaraines are often used for device development.8–10 Nevertheless, SMPDs with ionic dyes could only show spectral responses at certain wavelengths and are not suitable for panchromatic detection. In addition, the SMPDs based on ionic dyes tend to have high dark currents, due to the trapped charge carriers. At present, the SMPD performance falls far behind its polymer counterpart, especially in terms of high detectivity in a broad spectral region.8–10
Visibly transparent organic solar cells are unique concept devices and can be envisioned for use as integrated building materials (e.g., windows).19,20 Conceivably, visibly transparent PDs are “see-through” devices and thus may find some unique and covert applications. However, convention wisdom tells us that a compound which is photovoltaic at a given wavelength should also be able to absorb photons at the same wavelength. Most organic and polymer photovoltaic materials, such as a blend of P3HT and PCBM,21,22 are highly colored and only allow transmission of a small part of the visible light. In other words, a material with high light transmittance would absorb a small number of photons, thus resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE). Therefore, there must be a compromise or trade-off between the captured photons and the visible transparency of photovoltaic films.20,23 As reported herein, by using suitable low-bandgap organic materials, a balance between the visible transparency and satisfactory photovoltaic properties can be realized with organic PDs for panchromatic detection.
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type compounds M1 and M2 containing bis(2-thienyl)-N-alkylpyrrole (TPT) as the donor and thieno[3,4-b]thiadiazole (TT) as the acceptor (Scheme 1). These two compounds have suitable band gaps and are visibly semitransparent, i.e., have strong absorption in the UV and NIR region, but weak absorption in the visible region. The photodetectors based on these new compounds exhibited high specific photodetectivity (D*) of 5.0 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm at a bias of −0.1 V. By reducing the thickness of the silver electrode, the photodetectors become visibly transparent and still perform well with the D* value being fairly constant between 1011 and 1012 Jones in the spectral range of 300–900 nm.

Experimental
Materials
All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without any purification. Solvents for chemical syntheses were purified by distillation. Chemical reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. 1,4-Bis(2-thienyl)butane-1,4-dione (1),24 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-alkyl pyrrole (2),25 2-tributyl-(2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-alkyl pyrrole)stannane (3)13 and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene26 were prepared according to literature methods.
Methods

1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer using deuterated chloroform as the solvent. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal reference for NMR analyses. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was obtained from Bruker Daltonics Autoflex III TOF/TOF. Elemental analysis was performed on a FlashEA1112 Elementar Analysis Instrument. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660b electrochemical workstation in a solution of n-Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) in dry dichloromethane with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at rt under argon. A Pt disk (2 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The redox potentials were calibrated by using ferrocene as an internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Thermal Analysis Instruments Pyris Diamond TG from 50 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a continuous nitrogen flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA-DSC Q100 (TA Instruments from 20 to 200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a continuous nitrogen flow). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPA 300HV with a SPI 3800N Probe Station, Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan) studies were carried out in room-temperature air. The probes were FORTA probes from Applied Nanostructures, which have a silicon cantilever of nominal spring constant of 2.0 N m−1, a nominal resonance frequency of ∼70 kHz, and were tuned to a RMS cantilever oscillation amplitude of ∼1000 mV. Acquired images of 2 μm were taken with a scan frequency of 0.8 Hz. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a D8 Focus diffractometer at a scan rate of 2° min−1 in the 2θ range from 5° to 35° with graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). The films were prepared by drop casting dichloromethane solutions (10 mg mL−1) onto glass substrates.

As shown in Scheme 1, detailed syntheses are given below. The NMR and MS spectra are provided in the ESI.†

2,5-Di(2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-hexyl pyrrole)-3,4-dinitrylthiophene (4). 
PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.02 g, 0.03 mmol) was added to a solution of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene (1.0 g, 3.5 mmol) and 3 (4.47 g, 7.4 mmol) in THF (100 mL). The mixture was refluxed in an argon atmosphere for 18 h in the dark. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was diluted with aqueous KF solution and then extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with brine and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent dichloromethane–hexane, 1:2 v/v) to afford compound 4 as a dark red solid (2.30 g, 82% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.55 (d, 2H), 7.33–7.38 (m, 2H), 7.07–7.14 (m, 6H), 6.47 (d, 2H), 6.36 (d, 2H), 4.19 (t, 4H), 1.61 (m, 4H), 1.10–1.30 (m, 12H), 0.82 (t, 6H).


2,5-Di(2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-hexyl pyrrole)-3,4-diaminothiophene (5). 
Compound 4 (2.0 g, 2.5 mmol) was suspended in a solution of 50 mL of ethanol and 35 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid solution. With vigorous stirring, 6.8 g of SnCl2·2H2O was added in three portions within 1 h. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 20 h under argon atmosphere and then poured into 100 mL of aqueous NaOH solution (25 wt%). After extraction with dichloromethane several times, the extracts were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give compound 5 as a dark red solid, and it was used immediately without further purification.

Crude diamine 5 (2.0 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (20 mL) under argon. The solution was warmed to 60 °C and then PhNSO (0.56 g, 4 mmol) in 5 mL of pyridine was added. After stirring in 70 °C for 3 h, 1 mL of Me3SiCl was added. The mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred overnight. After removal of most pyridine in vacuum, the residue was chromatographed on silica gel (dichloromethane–hexane 1:3 v/v as eluent) to give compound M1 as a dark green solid. Recrystallization from hexane several times afforded dark green crystals (1.07 g, 52% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.57 (s, 2H), 7.30–7.37 (m, 2H), 7.02–7.16 (m, 6H), 6.45 (b, 2H), 6.36 (d, 2H), 4.22 (t, 4H), 1.64 (t, 4H), 1.10–1.35 (m, 12H), 0.81 (t, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 100 °C) δ (ppm): 156.8, 135.6, 135.1, 134.4, 129.7, 128.4, 127.4, 126.3, 126.2, 125.5, 125.2, 112.4, 111.6, 111.3, 45.7, 31.2, 29.7, 26.2, 22.4, 13.84.

Device fabrication
A mixture of M1/M2 and (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methylester (PCBM) in a weight ratio of 1:3 was dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at rt for more than 12 h. Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned, sequentially, by ultrasonic treatment in detergent at 60 °C for 2 h, washed with de-ionized water, blow dried with nitrogen, and then dried in an oven at 110 °C for 0.5 h. After UV–ozone treatment for 15 min, the ITO-coated slides was spin coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) at 3500 rpm for 60 s, followed by heating at 120 °C for 30 min, forming a film of about 30 nm thickness. The active layer in 80 nm thickness was deposited by spin-coating of the solution at a speed of 800 rpm for 60 s. BCP and Ag were deposited by thermal evaporation. The active device area is defined by a shadow mask to be 16 mm2. The six devices were prepared with a configuration as follows:
(a) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M1:PCBM (80 nm)/Ag (100 nm).
(b) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M2:PCBM (80 nm)/Ag (100 nm).
(c) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M1:PCBM (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm).
(d) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M2:PCBM (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm).
(e) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M1:PCBM (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (8 nm).
(f) ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/M2:PCBM (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (8 nm).
Photodetector characterization
All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions. EQE measurements were done using a tungsten lamp (250 W) and a monochromator chopped at 160 Hz with a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) to eliminate background noise. The reference was a calibrated Si photodiode (S1337-1010BQ, Hamamatsu, calibrated by the National Institute of Metrology of China) with known EQE spectra. Reverse bias on the device was provided by a Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. For the dark current measurement, current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 236 source measurement unit. The devices were shielded in a metal case to prevent electrostatic interference. If we assume that the shot noise from the dark current is a major contributor or factor,6,12,27 the specific detectivity (D*), one of the most important figures of merits for PDs, is expressed as:D* = R/(2qJd)1/2 = (Jph/Jlight)/(2qJd)1/2 (Jones),where R is the responsivity, a ratio of photocurrent (Jph) to incident-light intensity (Jlight), q is the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 Coulombs), and Jd is the dark current density (A cm−2).
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
The donor–acceptor approach, in which alternating electron-enrich and electron-deficient moieties are used to construct the π-conjugated backbone, is one of the most commonly used strategies to obtain low bandgap polymers and small molecules. This method has proved efficiently valuable in the synthesis of broad absorption optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications and related areas. The dual-band absorption spectrum is an important characteristic for this kind of materials. The absorption peaks and coefficients seem related to the selectivity of the electron donor and acceptor moieties.28–30 Based on the consideration given above, we design and synthesize the compounds with absorption from the UV-Vis to NIR spectral region, and with low absorption (e.g., the valley between the two absorption bands) in the visible region. To design the panchromatic compounds, bis(2-thienyl)-N-alkylpyrrole (TPT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiadiazole (TT) are selected as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively (Scheme 1). TPT is a strong electron-donating unit and has been incorporated in many compounds that show promising applications in organic solar cells and PDs.13,14 TT is a structural analogue of the widely used electron acceptor benzothiadiazole (BT), but has received less attention than BT.31–35 TT is more electron deficient than BT, making the corresponding D–A chromophores with even lower bandgaps or longer absorption in the red to NIR region. Furthermore, the intermolecular S–N interaction are expected to improve the structural order and enhance the charge transport between adjacent molecular chains.36,37
Accordingly, two compounds, M1 and M2, with different side chains were synthesized. The dinitro compounds were readily synthesized by the Stille-coupling reaction of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene and the monotributyltin product of TPT. Reduction of the dinitro compounds and subsequent cyclization with PhNSO finished the construction of the final product. The compounds were soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and chloroform.
Absorption and transmission properties
The absorption spectra of M1 and M2 in dichloromethane and as films spin-coated on quartz substrate are presented in Fig. 1. These two compounds exhibited nearly the same absorption spectra in solution. However, the low-energy absorption peak of M1 film is located at 782 nm, while that of M2 film is centered at 770 nm. A small red shift of 12 nm in absorption indicates a slight difference in the molecular packing for M1 and M2 in the solid state. Moreover, the absorption coefficient of the low-energy peak of M1 (4.95 × 104 cm−1) is higher than that of M2 (3.52 × 104 cm−1), which again is due to its more ordered structure, as confirmed by the wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) analysis (Fig. S9†). It is also worthwhile to mention that the absorption of M1 and M2 from 500 to 700 nm is fairly weak, as compared to their absorption in the NIR region.12Fig. 2 shows the transmission property of the pristine M1 film (80 nm) spin-coated on glass–ITO substrate. It is clear that the transmittance of the thin film of M1 is quite high (maximum > 70%) in the visible region, especially in the wavelength of 500–700 nm, which is well consistent with the absorption spectrum. Thus, they can be considered as panchromatic but visibly semitransparent.38,39

Electrochemical and thermal properties
The electrochemical properties of the compounds were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 3, they are all electrochemically active and undergo a quasi-reversible redox reaction. From the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of M1 are calculated to be −4.80 eV and −3.65 eV, respectively, and the corresponding bandgap of 1.15 eV is in good agreement with the optical band gap (1.26 eV). M1 and M2 have similar energy levels (Table S1†) and their LUMO levels with regard to that of PCBM (−4.2 eV) are adequate for exciton dissociation.40 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, see the ESI†) of these compounds in N2 reveals that the onset temperatures for 5% weight loss (Td) are above 300 °C, which is adequately stable for device fabrication and evaluation.

Photodetector performance
The SMPDs based on M1 and M2 in a few different device configurations were fabricated and tested for PD performance. The first one is called a basic SMPD device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (80 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (device a and b in Table 1). Silver is used as an electrode material for its low resistivity and good ductibility. It is also a preferred choice of metal for making a transparent/semitransparent electrode, due to the high optical transparency and easy fabrication.41,42 Using a silver electrode with a thickness of 100 nm, the above device is not transparent to human eyes. The active layer was comprised of M1/M2 and PCBM in an optimized weight ratio of 1:3.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the basic device with M1 in the dark is shown in Fig. 5c. The current behaviors under reverse and forward biases indicate that the devices appear to have asymmetry characteristics. The absorption profile of the films (Fig. S3†) and the EQE curves (Fig. S5†) confirm that the photons absorbed by the small molecules in the visible to NIR region contribute to the generation of photocurrent. Responsivity and the corresponding D* of the device based on M1 at a bias of −0.1 V are presented in Fig. 4a, while those of M2 are shown in Fig. 4b. These devices exhibited a photovoltaic response from 300 to 1000 nm. The basic device using M1 showed better performance than the one with M2. D* of the basic device based on M1 (device a in Table 1) is calculated to be 1.7 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm under a bias of −0.1 V, being comparable to previously reported ionic SMPDs.8–10

To further decrease the dark current and achieve higher detectivity, a 10 nm layer of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) was introduced as the hole blocking layer (HBL), which is known to block the holes injection from the cathode.43,44 In comparison with the basic devices, the optimized (non-transparent) SMPD devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (device c and d in Table 1) exhibited a much lower dark current (Fig. 5c). Schematic energy-level diagrams of the materials in the device are shown in Fig. 5b, the relatively lower HOMO energy level of BCP can block hole injection in the optimized devices sufficiently.3,43 In addition, the R value also decreased by about 20%. Hence, the device optimization brought about 3-fold increase of D*, as in the case for the optimized device based on M1 (Fig. 5d). It seems that not only the dark current, but also the photocurrent can be blocked by the BCP layer. Fortunately, the blocking of dark current is more effective than the photocurrent. Additionally, we have tested the transient response of devices c and d at −0.1 V under 0.1 MHz modulated 550 nm monochromatic illumination (Fig. S8†). The devices show a fairly fast response. The rise and fall times are both around 1.2 μs, which is comparable or even better than previously reported results.7,43

When the Ag cathode is sufficiently thin (8 nm), SMPDs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (80 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Ag (8 nm) (devices e and f in Table 1) are visibly transparent. Fig. 6a displays the transmission spectra of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (M1 and PCBM, 80 nm) and the complete SMPD device based on M1. The transparent SMPD exhibits an average 45% transmission of visible light from 400 to 700 nm and a maximal transmission of 51% at 540 nm. As shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, the CIAC logo with different colors can be seen clearly. The dark J–V characteristic of the visibly transparent device (ESI†) is basically the same as those of the non-transparent PD devices with a 100 nm thick Ag electrode. R and the corresponding D* values based on M1 are presented in Fig. 6b. In comparison with a non-transparent device, the R value of the transparent device was about 30% lower, due to the relatively smaller numbers of the absorbed photons and thus lower photocurrent.45 As a result, device c based on M1 achieves the best performance, as D* is calculated to be 5.0 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm at a bias of −0.1 V and remains at the same level between 1011 and 1012 Jones from 300 to 900 nm, which is among the highest detectivities reported to date for SMPDs and comparable to that of polymer PDs.7,12,14

Side chain influence
Compounds M1 and M2 are structurally analogous, with the only difference at their side chains. With regard to EQE and the dark currents, device a, c and e based on M1 (hexyl side chain) exhibit better performance than device b, d and f based on M2 (dodecyl side chain). The devices based on M1 also show higher R values than those based on M2. A significant influence of the molecular side chains on the device performance has been reported before.45 In our case, one possible reason for the higher EQE of M1-based devices could be attributed to the higher absorption coefficient of M1 than M2, as shown in Fig. 1b. With the same thickness, the M1 film is able to absorb more light; therefore, more photocurrents are generated and the EQE increases.46 Generally speaking, highly ordered donor molecules are expected to afford high hole mobilities, which is a necessary condition for the generation of significant photocurrents.47,48 The XRD data (ESI†) indicate a more ordered molecular stacking of M1 than M2. As a result, the enhanced charge mobility and optical absorption coefficient in spontaneously separated phases could be expected for M1-based devices.
Since film morphology can greatly influence the device performance,16,17 morphology of the blend films of M1 and M2 with PCBM was characterized by AFM. The images in a tapping mode (Fig. 7) reveal that the M2/PCBM film exhibits a smooth and featureless surface with poorly defined domains and un-optimal phase segregation of the BHJ components. Thus, poorly formed percolation pathways lead to limited charge separation and/or transport processes within the active blends, as confirmed by the low EQE. On the other hand, the surface morphology of M1:PCBM film is significantly different with finer nanostructures and proper nanoscale phase separation, reflected in the enhanced photocurrent and reduced dark current.49 Accordingly, the EQEs of the SMPDs based on M1 are higher than those of M2 (ESI†). The results indicate that fine tuning of the molecular structure is critical, in order to have the desired film morphology and optimize the photodetector performance.50,51

Conclusions
The two low-bandgap compounds M1 and M2 absorb broadly in the spectral region of 300–1000 nm, but weakly in the visible region. Due to these unique spectral features, the SMPD with M1 shows a photovoltaic response from 300 to 1000 nm and the D* value of 5.0 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm at a bias of −0.1 V. By reducing the thickness of the silver electrode, the SMPDs become visibly transparent and still exhibit fairly constant D* values between 1011 and 1012 Jones over the spectral range of 300–900 nm. The side chains of M1 and M2 can influence the film absorption, molecular packing and morphology, which in turn affect the performance of small-molecule photodetectors.
