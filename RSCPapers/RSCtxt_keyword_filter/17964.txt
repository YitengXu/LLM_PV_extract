1. Introduction
As a mainstay of next-generation optoelectronic devices, organic semiconductors (OSCs) have been arousing continuous attention for decades due to their unique properties such as mechanical flexibility and chemical versatility.1 Structurally, organic semiconductors based on π-conjugated systems can be easily modified to tune multi-level self-assembled structures with optimized optical and electronic properties via rational molecular design. Such features make them promising candidates for many applications, for example, as charge-transporting semiconductors in organic field effect transistors (OFETs),2 as light-harvesting dyes in organic solar cells (OSCs),3 as photon-generating agents in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),4 and as chromophores or probes in detectors5 and sensors.6 Various theories of molecular design were established and permitted efficient screening of a structural series for particular properties or applications with the desired criteria.7
An OFET is responsible for charge transport of active semiconductors between source and drain electrodes. To date, significant progress has been achieved since the first p-channel (hole-transporting) OFET in 19868 with a mobility of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to present organic single crystals with a mobility of up to 15–40 cm2 V−1 s−1.9 Different from the scarcity of relatively high electronic performance and air-stable n-channel (electron-transporting) semiconductors, p-channel counterparts (hole-transporting) dominate the best-performance lists.10 This is primarily ascribed to (1) their synthetic accessibility; (2) the ambient stability of organic radical cations in a conductive channel; and (3) the alignment between the work function of metal electrodes (Au, ca. 5.1 eV) and the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO energy level) for efficient injection of holes in most of the p-channel materials.
In addition to device physics including device configuration and interface engineering, etc., the intrinsic electronic properties of semiconductors as active layers are most decisive for the ultimate performance of OFETs. Principally, the mobility of semiconductors relies on the efficiency of charge transport from one molecule to another.11 This in turn means that maximizing the overlap of π molecular orbitals (face-to-face contact) with strong electronic coupling between the adjacent molecules will facilitate the carrier pathway in such solids. Hence, the packing mode of organic semiconductors becomes critical so as to achieve high carrier mobility characteristics. Efforts to promote face-to-face contact (π–π stacking) have focused on the integration of functional groups expected to induce prerequisite packing. The successful implementation of this strategy has involved the bulky groups12 and halogen-substitution13 at the peri-position of acenes by blocking the edge-to-face interactions with favourable packing arrangement, improved ambient stability, and excellent carrier mobilities.
Heteroannulation, on the other hand, becomes an effective way to generate non-bonding intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonds, halogen–halogen interactions or chalcogen–chalcogen interactions, which leads to the increase of effective dimensionality of the electronic structure and thus enhanced transporting character. Especially, sulfur-decorated organic semiconductors have been proved to be one of the most valuable semiconductors for use in OFETs. Compared to the corresponding all-carbon based materials, the sulfur-decorated species benefit from more planarity and stronger donating ability. Besides, they are less aromatic, albeit their similar six π electrons as in a benzene ring, thus resulting in a higher oxidation barrier and larger band gap. It is envisioned that they possess higher oxidative stability. Hence, S atoms are capable of introducing S⋯S, S⋯H, and S⋯π intermolecular interactions originating from the high polarizability of sulfur atoms, which is not only preferred for charge transport, but also largely changes the packing motifs of such systems.14 Additionally, nitrogen- and other chalcogen-decorated derivatives have also attracted a great deal of attention.
Taking into consideration the large number of high performance heteroarene semiconductors published to date, little effort has been devoted to reviewing salient features of their unique packing mode and excellent transporting performance, and systematically exploiting the structure–property relationship established by the presence of heteroatoms. Certainly, organic single crystals induce the intrinsic electronic properties on account of the highly ordered structures, minimized traps and being free of grain boundaries, thus favoring the elucidation of the correlations between the electronic structure, the crystal packing, and device performance.9 Particularly, 1D single-crystalline nano- or microstructures based on heteroatom annulated OSCs by predominantly self-assembling through strong π–π stacking are expected to be preferred for realizing high performance organic electronics. This review will mainly investigate the heteroarenes, including linear heteroacenes and heteroatom annulated polycyclic aromatics (PAHs), and also gives a general overview of their practical synthesis, takes a close look at their tunable self-assembled packing arrangement by the synergistic effect of multiple heteroatom–heteroatom interactions and π–π interactions, as well as their excellent electronic performance.
2. Heteroacenes
Generally, acenes adopt an edge-to-face herringbone packing arrangement with minimal π–π stacking in the solid state. Furthermore, a higher acene with an extended π system suffers from the disadvantages of oxidative instability and decreased solubility.15 For example, tetracene and pentacene OFETs have received extensive attention since they have shown hole mobilities of up to 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the instability upon illumination and low solubility in organic solvents strongly limit their further applications. In this section, we mainly summarize the synthesis, photophysical properties, solid state packing and high performance transistors of linear heteroacenes, in particular chalcogenoacenes. In this molecular system, a variety of intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals interactions, weak hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, and S⋯S or Se⋯Se contacts, could be formed. Furthermore, these compounds with fused rings have more rigid structures, better conjugation, larger band gaps and higher stability with more efficient π orbital overlap than oligo- and polythiophenes.
2.1 Chalcogenoacenes

2.1.1 Chalcogenotetracenes. 
Tetracene possessing a HOMO energy level of −5.40 eV and an Eg of 2.25 eV is one of the most investigated acenes used as a p-channel semiconductor applied in single crystal devices to afford hole mobilities as high as 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.16 First example of chalcogenotetracenes (1) replaced by one thiophene ring was synthesized by a Diels–Alder reaction and a subsequent reduction step in high yield by Bao and co-workers.17 Asymmetric thienotetracene 1 had a larger band gap of 2.51 eV than that of tetracene, but exhibited a thin film mobility of only 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to its large grain boundaries in films. A four-thiophene fused system, tetrathienoacene (TTA, 2), was reported by oxidative ring closure.18 It is interesting to note that another TTA (3) has a fully planar geometry but a nonlinear molecular shape, and was prepared by cyclization of 10H-bisthienodithiocin-10-one up to gram-scale (Fig. 1).19
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of chalcogenotetracenes. 
A series of aromatic or aliphatic substituted benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (BTBT) or benzoselenopheno[3,2-b]benzoselenophene (BSBS) derivatives were prepared by Takimiya and co-workers.20 The phenyl end-capped derivatives (DPh-BTBT and DPh-BSBS, 4a and 4b) displayed their HOMO energy levels of −5.60 eV and −5.38 eV, and energy gaps of about 3.20 eV and 3.86 eV, respectively. Vacuum evaporated films based on 4a showed a reproducible mobility of up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of larger than 107 with excellent stability. In contrast, OFETs of 4b thin films show p-channel characteristics with a mobility of about 0.31 cm2 V−1 s−1. The alkylated BTBTs (Cn-BTBTs, 5a) containing two solubilizing long alkyl groups in the molecular long-axis are expected to facilitate lateral intermolecular interaction. All of their spin-coated films showed decent FET characteristics with mobilities larger than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the derivative with C13H27 alkyl chains provided the highest electrical performance up to 2.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off ratios as high as 107. A higher mobility of 3.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved using vacuum evaporated C12-BTBT film based devices on ODTS-treated substrates. Even the inkjet printing of C8-BTBT single crystals yielded thin-film transistors with the average carrier mobilities reaching 16.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the maximum value as high as 31.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with on/off ratios in the range of 105–107.21 This notable feature of the electronic performance of Cn-BTBTs is attributed to cooperative intermolecular interactions characterized by a herringbone structure consisting of C–H⋯π interactions, S⋯S interactions, and hydrophobic interactions of stacked long alkyl chains for 2D carrier transport. For single crystals of C8-, C10-, and C12-BTBT, a network of intensive S⋯S contacts shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of sulfur atoms (3.70 Å) exists in an edge-to-edge manner between π-stacks and a face-to-edge manner in the π-stacks, and the molecules are characterized by a lamella-like alternating structure of alkyl and BTBT core in a herringbone arrangement. On the other hand, the selenophene analogues (Cn-BSBS, 5b) had the face-to-face π-stacking structure with an interplanar distance of 3.54 Å. Only edge-to-edge Se⋯Se short contacts (3.54 Å) are observed between π-stacks. The shorter d-spacings of their thin films corresponded to larger inclination of the molecules on the substrates. This less effective electronic structure led to inferior carrier properties of 0.066–0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 than those of Cn-BTBTs.


2.1.2 Chalcogenopentacenes. 
Pentacene crystallizes in the triclinic P1 space group with a 52° edge-to-face angle, and the band gap determined from the absorption onset is about 1.85 eV (670 nm).22 Great effort has been focused on the development of functionalized pentacenes for lowering HOMO levels, broadening band gaps and optimizing packing arrangements. Asymmetric linear thienopentacene 6 had a larger band gap of 1.96 eV, and showed a thin film mobility of 0.47 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparable to that of pentacene under similar conditions (0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1).17 Another isomer, anthra[2,3-b]benzo[d]thiophene (ABT, 7), has an interesting nonlinear molecular shape. Compared with its linear analogues and pentacene, ABT exhibited remarkable differences both in electronic properties and solid state structure due to its asymmetric structure and greater loss of aromaticity. It possessed a lower HOMO energy level of −5.35 eV and a larger band gap of 2.50 eV. Crystal structure of ABT stacked in a herringbone geometry similar to that of pentacene but the presence of short C–H⋯π and S⋯π contacts (3.35 and 3.37 Å) between the neighboring molecules induced a two-dimensional face-to-edge electronic structure for carrier transport. It has been demonstrated that a mobility of 0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1 and good air stability for months were achieved in its thin film FETs (Fig. 2).23
 Fig. 2  Chemical structures of chalcogenopentacenes. 
Two thienopentacene isomers, i.e., anti- and syn-bis(benzo[4,5]thieno)[2,3-b:3′,2′-d]thiophenes (BBTT, 8 and 9), were in depth reported by Hu,24 having their band gaps of 3.77 and 3.46 eV, respectively. Both of them possess similar HOMO energy levels lower than −5.60 eV. However, the sickle-like syn-isomer shows a higher LUMO energy level compared with the linear anti-isomer, meaning that the configurational difference remarkably affected the LUMOs. Furthermore, the anti-isomer formed a herringbone packing structure similar to that of pentacene. There was an extensive network of C–H⋯π and S⋯π interactions within the a–c plane of the crystal. While the syn-isomer packed along the a-axis closely with a π-separation of 3.53 Å by self-assembling into one dimensional single crystal ribbons. In both molecules, no S⋯S contacts are observed. The first attempt to apply the anti-isomer (8) in thin-film transistors afforded a mobility of up to 0.51 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio larger than 106 at optimized film substrate temperature. On the other hand, its single crystals demonstrated mobility as high as 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 as a result of the molecules adopting a typical herringbone packing. However, OFETs of the syn-isomer (9) exhibited a mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for single crystals. The differences were ascribed to the change in crystal packing and intermolecular interactions due to the subtle tuning of the molecular structures (Table 1).

Pentathienoacene (PTA, 10), which is the thiophene equivalent of pentacene, has been synthesized by Zhu and co-workers through oxidative ring closure under CuCl2.25 This procedure leads to relatively low yield of desired thienoacene, probably due to the low solubility of the sulfide precursor. Almost at the same time, an improved synthetic process of PTA and extension of the series have been reported through protodesilylation by the Matzger group.26 X-ray crystallographic analysis of PTA showed that it is arranged in the desired face-to-face π–π stacking motif at a distance of 3.52 Å. Dense S⋯S contacts of 3.49–3.55 Å are observed between the neighboring columns. And it features a low-lying HOMO of −5.33 eV and larger band gap (ca. 3.29 eV from electrochemical data and 3.20 eV from the onset absorption). The PTA molecules formed highly ordered films stacked in layers with their long axis upright from the substrate due to the large π-conjugated and planar molecular structure. Employing PTA as an active semiconducting layer in thin-film transistors yields the best mobility of 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Packing structures of pentacene (A), 7 (ABT, B), 8 (anti-BBTT, C), 9 (syn-BBTT, D), 10 (PTA, E), and 11 (HTP, F). 
The molecular packing of sulfur-exocyclic acene, hexathiapentacene (HTP, 11), features π⋯π stacking in two directions with an intermolecular distance of 3.54 Å. The very short S⋯S contacts in the range of 3.37–3.41 Å are found between the central S atoms and the outermost S atoms of neighbours probably due to its unique zwitterionic structure. HTP remains very stable even in solution, although it has a narrower band gap of 1.61 eV as determined from the onset absorption. It is worth emphasizing that the mobility of HTP single-crystal nanowires (0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1)27 is over six times greater than that of vapour-deposited HTP thin-film transistors (0.005–0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1).28 The relatively low mobility of HTP may be speculated that the charge carriers are trapped in the dipolar field of the zwitterions.
Thienopentacenes with alkyl end-capped chains are also widely studied. Müllen et al. reported the facile synthesis of hexyl-substituted dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (C6-DTBDT, 12) with a larger band gap of 3.36 eV. These thienoacenes with five-units showing low-lying HOMO levels and larger band gaps indicate higher oxidative stability than parent pentacene. The molecules of C6-DTBDT packed in a shifted cofacial arrangement with an interplanar separation of 3.63 Å along with S⋯S contacts (3.73 Å), promoting a two-dimensional charge-carrier transport. A mobility of 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of up to 107 have been produced from dip-coating films.29
Similar to trialkylsilylethynyl acenes,12 thienoacenes substituted by such bulky groups at the peri-position have also been investigated. This strategy can not only block the edge-to-face interactions and enhance π-stacking in crystals, but also improve ambient stability and increase the solubility of the materials. Bao et al. synthesized a class of trialkylsilylethynyl thienoacene derivatives from their quinone precursors. Among them, vacuum deposited films of asymmetric TIPSE-thienopentacene (13)30 showed mobilities as high as 1.25 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was attributed to its 2-D bricklayer structure with the aromatic backbones separated by 3.40 Å similar to that of TIPSE-pentacene (3.43 Å).12 Furthermore, inseparable mixtures of syn- and anti-TESE-thienopentacene (14a)31 and its fluorinated derivative (14b) have been synthesized by Anthony. The crystal of 14a also adopted a 2-D π-stacking, but for a decrease in π-separation of ∼3.25 Å, indicating a more compressed packing arrangement. The devices based on its drop-casted films yielded hole mobilities as high as 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an excellent on/off current ratio of 107. While replacing with fluorine atoms, F⋯S contacts as close as 3.16 Å were observed in such crystals of 14b. The subtle modification in molecular structure did not induce significant change in solid state arrangement, but resulted in enhanced intermolecular interactions that afforded an improved spin-coated film performance of up to 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.32 Moreover, single crystal transistors based on 14b were also fabricated and exhibited mobilities as high as 6 cm2 V−1 s−1 with on/off ratios of 108.33 While isomerically pure syn-material (syn-14b) gave a comparable mobility of 1.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 in its single crystal transistors.34 Anthony also reported amide functionalized TESE-thienopentacene (14c) and successfully employed the syn-isomer in bulk-heterojunction solar cells as an active acceptor with a power conversion efficiency of up to 0.80%.35


2.1.3 Higher chalcogenoacenes. 
In addition, more efficient synthetic protocols for the preparation of higher chalcogenoacenes have been established. With the introduction of heteroatoms, these higher chalcogenoacenes with rings of even up to nine units still showed much better stability than the benzene-based analogues and excellent device performance. The dibenzotetrathienoacenes (DBTTAs) have been achieved by superacid-induced intramolecular cyclization of reaction of aromatic methyl sulfoxides. Both of the six-numbered thienoacenes (DBTTAs) with centrosymmetry have good thermostabilities above 340 °C. The linear ladder-type derivative (L-DBTTA, 15) shows a red-shift of 54 nm relative to that of S-shaped one (L-DBTTA, 16, λmax = 312 nm), which indicates that the linear isomer has better conjugation. Compared with compound 8 with the same linear hetero-structure, the decreased energy gap determined from optical and electrochemical characteristics suggests extension of the π-systems effectively. Employing them in OFETs produced mobilities of 0.15 and 0.047 cm2 V−1 s−1 for L- and S-DBTTA, respectively. The results also demonstrated that the linear one is better than the kinked one for charge transport (Fig. 4).36
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of higher chalcogenoacenes. 
Furthermore, dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT, 17a) with six fused aromatic rings and its selenophene analogue (DNSS, 17b) were developed as stable π-extended thienoacenes similar to DPh-BTBT and DPh-BSBS. The parent DNTT (17a) molecule featuring a herringbone arrangement in the solid state exhibited a mobility of up to 2.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 107 from its vapor-deposited films. Further investigation on its single crystal FETs gave mobilities as high as 8.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of up to 109.37 The same authors presented selenium-decorated hexacene (17b) as a p-channel transporting material with a high film mobility of 1.9 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similarly, electrical performances of alkylated DNTTs (17c) have been investigated. Vapor-deposited devices were reported to have insufficient solubility at room temperature compared with highly soluble BTBT counterparts, although the maximum mobility of 7.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for vapor-deposited polycrystalline films of C10-DNTT. Subsequently a new hot-solution processing technique has been used to fabricate highly-ordered crystalline thin films of C10-DNTT on a flexible substrate, thus resulting in mobilities as high as 11 cm2 V−1 s−1. Even further extension of this series with eight units, dianthra[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DATT, 19) is quite stable with an ionization potential (IP) of 5.10 eV. The vapor-deposited thin film of 19 also produced mobilities of up to 3.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.20
In general, the unsubstituted fused-ring thienoacenes show low solubility in common solvents at ambient temperature with increasing fused units owing to their rigid structures and strong intermolecular interactions. Yamaguchi et al. obtained dibenzopentathienoacenes (18a and 18b) with seven fused rings by intramolecular triple cyclization of bis(o-haloaryl)diacetylenes and subsequent dechalcogenation.38 They displayed their absorption maxima at 385 nm and 404 nm in THF upon heating due to their very poor solubility. OFETs based on 18a for an individual single crystal showed a mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 together with excellent device stability, while the selenium-decorated analogue (18b) exhibited a mobility of 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, twice as high as that of the corresponding sulfur-decorated one.39 Whereas, crystalline nanoribbons of a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis[b]benzothiophene derivative (20) formed through slow solution self-assembly exhibited excellent performance with a mobility of 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.40

2.2 Oligomers of thienoacenes
Annulated oligothiophenes (AOTs) have been known over 50 years,41 which represent another form of carbon sulfide with the formula (C2S)n. All AOTs contain isomers owing to the different coupling positions. Among these isomeric AOTs, the quasi-linearly α-annulated oligothiophenes are the most versatile and effective systems for organic functional materials,42 while β-annulated species are usually chosen as building blocks to construct helicenes.43 Commonly, there are two synthetic approaches based on route (i) or (ii) for α-annulated oligothiophenes, and route (iii) or (iv) for β-annulated ones (Fig. 5).

Studies on α-linked oligomers of thienoacenes are mostly focused on thienothiophene (TT) and dithienothiophene (DTT). They are either substituted by an aryl group or alkyl group for the purpose of extending their conjugation or improving their solubility and stability, thus enhancing the molecular self-assembly. The “dimerization” linked by a single bond was usually carried out through oxidative coupling of the parent thienoacene using ferric acetylacetonate as the oxidant, like compounds 21a.42 While the hexyl-substituted bisDTT (21b) was synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed bis(tri-n-butyltin)-mediated homo-coupling of mono-bromo DTT derivatives.44
Very recently, we performed an Ullmann coupling reaction by copper from mono-bromo β-fused DTT to afford the desired dimer (23).45 Asymmetric dimer 25 was prepared by Stille coupling reactions between bromo- and stannyl thienoacene.46 Furthermore, a series of vinylene-bridged dimers 22 and 24 containing alkyl and aryl groups were achieved by low-valence titanium-mediated McMurry coupling of aldehyde derivatives.47 However, the asymmetric vinylene-bridged dimer 26 was synthesized by Wittig reaction (Fig. 6).46
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of oligomers of thienoacenes. 
According to our reports, all of bisDTTs as well as their derivatives are thermally stable, at least up to 320 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The HOMO energy levels estimated from the oxidation onsets vary from −5.30 to −5.50 eV and the HOMO–LUMO gaps calculated by absorption onsets in THF solution are in the range of 2.60 to 3.20 eV.
Crystallographic analysis of single bond linked bisDTT (21a) showed that the molecules possess a unique π–π stacking feature with interplanar contacts as short as 3.56 Å, and intensive S⋯S contacts as close as 3.39 Å (Fig. 7), indicating a very compressed molecular structure and strong intermolecular interactions.42 Whereas, the β-fused bisDTT (23) adopted a sandwich-herringbone arrangement with an antiparallel dimer separated by 3.48 Å.45 Similarly, the crystal structures of vinylene-bridged dimers 22 and 24a with different fused rings are distinctive. The molecules 22 crystallized in the P21/n space group and packed along the b-axis with an interplanar distance of 3.51 Å. Strong S⋯S interactions (3.35–3.43 Å) and short C–H⋯π interactions (2.37–2.86 Å) are responsible for their compressed π–π stacking with the likelihood of a “staircase” structure.46 This arrangement is strikingly different to that of 21a by replacing a vinylene unit. But the molecular packing of 24a is characteristic of condensed herringbone mode with its β-fused DTT units distorted in an arc-shape due to the multi-dimensional S⋯S interaction networks. In the molecular system, S⋯S contacts as short as 3.34 Å are found between the outmost S atoms along the long molecular axis of neighbouring molecules. Another type of S⋯S interactions of 3.56 Å also exists in the central S atoms of neighbouring molecules along the short molecular axis. Together with C–H⋯π and C⋯S interactions, the molecules 24a formed an extraordinary 3D network, probably providing a new compressed packing mode for efficient charge transport.45
 Fig. 7  Packing structures of bisDTTs. 
The phenyl-substituted derivative (24d) has a similar herringbone geometry to that of unsubstituted 24a. However, the intermolecular interactions between the molecules have been significantly affected by the incorporation of phenyl substituents at both ends. No S⋯S interactions exist. Instead, strong phenyl–phenyl contacts and phenyl–DTT are observed between the neighbouring stacks. Importantly, more compressed packing along the b-axis of 7.36 Å has been achieved for 24d compared to 7.62 Å for 24a and 7.79 Å for pentacene, promising for high carrier mobility in OFETs. In contrast, the crystal structure of 24e adopted slipped π–π stacking in two different directions with separation distances of 3.48 and 3.34 Å, respectively, well within the van der Waals radius of carbon atoms (3.40 Å). Moreover, multi-dimensional S⋯S interactions in the range of 3.36–3.58 Å combined the adjacent stacks tightly for affording a 3D electronic coupling in the solid state (Table 2).47

It is therefore important that in another part of our work we have fabricated exceptional high performance thin film p-channel devices based on these bisDTTs. According to previous literature, diDTT 21a42 and its dihexyl substituted derivative (21b)44 all exhibited hole mobilities in the range of 0.03–0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1, but with impressive on/off current ratios (108). Our results are in good agreement with experimental details reported by Holmes. However, compound 23 featuring a sandwich herringbone packing motif just showed the mobility of 0.002–0.005 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was one order lower than that of the α-fused derivative (21a). On the other hand, the vinylene-bridged α-fused bisDTT (22) exhibited the best mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 1.9 × 103 and a threshold voltage of −14 V at a substrate temperature of 20 °C.46 Whereas, the β-fused one (24a) exhibited impressive mobilities as high as 0.89 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off ratios of larger than 107 by using a two-stage film deposition process (100/27 °C), in which the film consisting of larger crystalline grains with good connectivity is formed.45 The much better FET performance demonstrated the compressed packing mode combining multiple intermolecular interactions in compound 24a.
The appropriate substituents are capable of providing efficient molecular packing arrangements for high carrier mobility. We have investigated four molecules substituted by alkyl or aryl groups in thin film transistors fabricated in top-contact configuration. Firstly, the introduction of hexyl groups largely lowered the device performance (0.038 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to its parent (24a). Furthermore, the molecule 24c with two perfluorohexyl groups still showed p-channel characteristic with very poor performance on the order of 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The phenyl-substituted derivative (24d) demonstrates the most remarkably high thin film FET performance, with an increasing mobility as high as 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of up to 108 by using the two-stage deposition process (100/27 °C). In addition, the devices show good environmental stability, even after storage in air for seven months. In sharp contrast, the thienyl-substituted derivative (24e) just showed mobilities of 0.002 cm2 V−1 s−1. The values are more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent, due to the amorphous films and random orientations resulted from too much multiple intermolecular interactions in the molecules of 24e.47
3. Heteroatom annulated polycyclic aromatics
Linear heteroacenes have exhibited excellent charge transport performance, which can be attributed to the beneficial charge transporting packing arrangements partially by the incorporation of heteroatoms. To enhance the face-to-face contacts along the molecular π–π stacking direction, molecules with an extended π-surface resulting from reduced C–H⋯π interactions have been utilized to produce low-dimensional crystals, which show highly anisotropic electronic properties. Specially, polycyclic aromatics (PAHs) with a “zigzag” periphery are appealing candidates for construction of new five- or six-membered heterocycles in the bay-regions.48 Not only the electronic properties can be improved significantly by the annulation of heteroatoms into the framework of PAHs, but also the dimensionality of transporting the carrier of the corresponding heteroatom annulated systems will be enhanced. However, these heteroatom annulated PAHs have been conventionally prepared under extreme conditions such as flash vacuum pyrolysis (FVP) with quite poor yields.
3.1 Synthesis
Over the ensuing decades, there has been continuous interest in exploiting novel heteroatom annulated PAHs, particularly in the establishment of efficient and practical synthetic protocols. Triphenylene is a star molecule in the family of PAHs and possesses C3-symmetrical geometry with three bay regions. One sulfur mono-bridged triphenyleno[1,12-b,c,d]thiophene (TPT, 27) has been firstly produced by direct addition of crystalline triphenylene or dodecahydrotriphenylene to a heterogeneous catalyst in a stream of hydrogen sulfide at high temperature (ca. 550 °C).49 While at an increased flow rate of hydrogen sulfide gas, the same procedure as used could afford the di-bridged triphenyleno[1,12-b,c,d:4,5-b′,c′,d′]dithiophene (TPDT, 28) in quite low yield (2.5% maximum). Meanwhile, Swedish scientists showed that the synthesis of a mixture of triphenylene, mono-bridged (27) and di-bridged species (28) could be attempted in one pot by reacting dodecahydrotriphenylene with elemental sulfur at a temperature above 400 °C successfully.50
The bowl-shaped tri-bridged molecule, triphenyleno[1,12-b,c,d:4,5-b′,c′,d′:8,9-b′′,c′′,d′′]trithiophene (TPTT, 29), has been investigated, the electronic structure of which is regarded as a highly symmetrical trithiasumanene. Although its synthesis is relatively difficult presumably due to the strained structure and was not found in the above-mentioned procedures. The molecule has been eventually synthesized based on a key step of tribenzannulation of benzotrithiophene by a FVP method. However, the harsh conditions carried out in these procedures resulted in poor yields of the materials, undesirable byproducts, ultimately difficulty in scale-up and further investigation of their electronic properties.51
Real progress has been made in the development of more mild synthetic methods and applicable optoelectronic materials. Kawashima reported an intramolecular sila-Friedel–Crafts reaction for the synthesis of trisilasumanene (TSS, 30) starting from an isomeric mixture of tribromotriphenylene. This reaction was very sensitive to the choice of oxidant and base, and the combination of Ph3CB(C6F5)4 as the oxidant and 2,6-lutidine as the base significantly increased the conversion yield of the desired heterocyclic product under such room temperature conditions.52 Another kind of successful heterocyclic resultants based on triphenylene is 1,5,9-triazacoronenes (TACs, 31), an azaanalogue of coronene. The six-membered heterocyclic species was obtained from trinitrotriphenylene using a two-step sequence including reduction to triamine, and a tandem three-fold Pictet–Spengler triannulation reaction followed by oxidative aromatization under mild conditions. The emergence of these practical procedures not only allows for increased solubility and further functionalization for creating new heteroatom annulated PAHs, but also permits further elaboration of their optoelectronic properties and molecular structures (Fig. 8).53
 Fig. 8  Chemical structures of heteroatom annulated triphenylenes. 
Similar to triphenylene, perylene has been extensively investigated due to its extraordinary properties and easy functionalization in its bay-regions and peri-positions. Heteroannulation into its skeleton featuring “zigzag” periphery with two bay regions is an intriguing target. The first example of heteroatom annulated perylenes (HAPs) is sulfur-annulated benzoperylene, namely thiacoronene (TC, 32), an analogue of coronene, which was synthesized in 1973 from 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene as the starting material in an eight-step reaction.54 An alternative route to this compound is based on the Diels–Alder addition of maleic anhydride to the dehydrohelicene furnishing a mixture of anhydride which was directly decarboxylated with soda lime.55 However, it is surprising that little effort has been devoted to exploring its electrical property and further confirmation of its molecular structure. On the other hand, its nitrogenated analogues, such as 1,2-diazabenzoperylene (33), 1,2-diazacoronene (34) and 1,2,7,8-tetraazacoronene (35), were directly obtained by the Diels–Alder reaction of perylene with diethyl azodicarboxylate and maleic acid anhydride at 350 °C, subsequent hydrolysis and decarboxylation as early as in 1982.56 Obviously, the harsh reaction conditions have limited the further investigation of these interesting compounds (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of heteroatom annulated perylenes (HAPs). 
Our practical strategy for the preparation of HAPs stemmed from the practical preparation and successful application of perylo[1,12-b,c,d]thiophene (PET, 37).57 The magic molecule was first synthesized from 3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride by Rogovik in 1974, which undergoes decarboxylation in the Cu–quinoline system at reflux temperature.58 Later, its preparation was attempted by several groups under harsh conditions such as FVP, resulting in long reaction sequences, poor yields, and even irreproducibility (Fig. 10).59
 Fig. 10  Approach to chalcogen-heterocyclic annulated perylenes. 
To figure out these problems confronted by synthesis of HAPs, we are expected to seek for more chemical synthetic approaches. Stimulated by previous preparation of the regiospecific mononitration of perylene at the bay-region in the literature,60 we have achieved a practical synthetic route towards 1-nitroperylene up to gram-scale successfully in a modified nitration process.61 The foregoing reports gave an unsatisfactory yield and irreproducible reaction process. In terms of sulfur cyclization from the nitro group by reacting with the sulfur atom, we carried out the key step of 1-nitroperylene reacting with sulfur powder in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) at 180 °C to afford the PET molecule as a bright yellow needle in a yield of 70%. This is a great breakthrough in the synthesis of HAPs resulting in such a high yield by a surprisingly simple one-pot procedure.
Consequently, as another member of chalcogens, selenium is also chosen to be incorporated into the perylene skeleton to give the selenophene analogue, perylo[1,12-b,c,d]selenophene (PESE, 38) in about 65% yield, as yellow-brown needles. Furthermore, dithioperylene (DTP, 39) was obtained via three-step reactions in about 8% overall yield involving effective regiospecific mononitration of PET at the free bay region, sulfur cyclization from the nitro group by reacting with the sulfur atom, and copper-mediated dechalcogenation.62
The nitrogen-annulated perylene (NP, 36) was synthesized by J. J. Looker in 1972 when he firstly examined the nitration reaction of perylene.60 We have shown that our chosen synthetic approach to NP derivatives opens up the possibility of a wide range of further modifications of the chromophores, in particular at the nitrogen-position and at the peri-position. We developed a new efficient synthetic method toward processable bis-N-annulated quaterrylenes (42, BNQs)63 and tri-N-annulated hexarylenes (44, TNHs)64 based on N-annulated perylenes (NPs), which is conducted by DDQ/Sc(OTf)3 oxidative coupling and ring fusion. Furthermore, Wu synthesized a series of ladder-type NP-fused near-infrared dyes, in which either a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core (41, NP-B),65 dicarboximide substituents (43, BNQD),66 or porphyrin units (45, 47)67 was integrated into the NP system. Besides, the first D–A copolymer (46, PPTT) based on NP, being the excellent building block, has been explored (Fig. 12).68
The heterocirculenes with heteroatoms especially on the periphery of the circulene core are molecular structures of considerable importance because they involve the radialene framework that has been a theoretical and experimental matter of concern with regard to exocyclic double bonds, aromaticity, and π-conjugation. They are also expected to pave an effective way to design low dimensional semiconductors decorated with multidimensional interactions, which can provide effective pathways for carrier transport. The representative molecular systems are chalcogen-containing octahetero[8]circulenes (Fig. 11), which were synthesized by treating tetrathiophene with an excess of lithium diisopropylamide and chalcogen (S or Se powder), followed by acidification with HCl to completely convert to polythiol. Then the vacuum pyrolysis process has been carried out in the mixtures to enable ring closure by eliminating excess chalcogen. Octathio[8]circulene (sulflower, 48) was obtained by repeated vacuum sublimation in overall yield of 80% as an insoluble dark red powder,69 while the target tetraselenotetrathio[8]circulene (selenosulflower, 49) was separated to afford an insoluble white-creamy powder in 50% yield.70

3.2 Electronic properties
The photophysical properties of some heteroatom annulated PAHs are summarized in Table 3. Some examples are rarely further investigated for their electronic properties because of the difficulty in the establishment of efficient and practical synthetic protocols. All of the UV-vis absorption spectra show well-defined vibronic π–π* transition absorption bands, and match the profile of all-carbon parent very closely. Generally, a longer conjugation length for a particular compound will show a bathochromic shift in the absorption maximum. And the incorporation of a heteroatom into an aromatic π-electron system will lead to modification of its π-electronic structure because of efficient delocalization of the heteroatom electrons of the bridging cycles into the π-system of the core. For example, the absorption maxima of trithia- and trisilasumanene (29, 30) are red-shifted from that of sumanene itself (λmax = 278 nm).51,52 The azanalogues of coronene, TACs (31), are significantly red-shifted compared to their all-carbon parent, 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexamethoxycorornene (HMC, λmax = 325 nm). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these TACs estimated by the oxidation and reduction onsets were around −6.00 eV and −3.00 eV, which are much lower than those of HMC (−5.50 eV), agreeing well with their π-deficient feature owing to the electron-poor pyridine rings.53

All of the typical absorption spectra of HAPs (36, 37, and 38) can be seen at longer wavelengths relative to their corresponding parent benzoperylene (λmax = 404 nm), reflecting the electronic effect of replacing the heteroatoms on the π-electron density of the system. Although their absorption peaks reveal slight blue-shifts of 13–26 nm, the vibronic absorption bands closely resemble that of perylene (λmax = 438 nm), indicating a similarity in electronic structures of the chromophores. Moreover, dithioperylene (DTP, 39) possesses a blue-shift of 23 nm relative to PET (37), and 49 nm compared to perylene as a reflection of the extended aromatic core along the short molecular axis. The optical energy gaps estimated from the absorption edges of the solution are generally decreased by extending the π-electronic system. In addition, the absorption maxima of the nitrogen-decorated derivatives shifted to a lower energy position relative to chalcogen-decorated species owing to the stronger electron-donating character of the nitrogen atom. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method demonstrated that the calculated electronic structures and photochemical properties of the synthesized S-, Se-, and N-heterocyclic annulated perylenes were in good agreement with the experimental results.71 In addition, the O-, C-, Si-, and B-heterocyclic annulated perylenes, namely OP, CP, SiP, and BP respectively, were also theoretically designed. The electrochemical value of DTP in film showed a quasi-reversible oxidation with a relatively high onset potential at 0.92 V, indicating a HOMO level of about −5.72 eV. These estimated HOMO levels are suggested to be typical hole-transporting characteristics.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed under nitrogen flow revealed that the decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss are 312, 309, and 343 °C for PET, PESE, and DTP, respectively. The exceptional thermal and chemical stability permitted them to be applicable in organic electronics.
Theoretically, these NP-based dyes have a remarkable fluorescence compared with weak fluorescence of poly(peri-naphthalene) (PPNs) due to the introduction of the nitrogen bridges at the bay regions, which leads to the changes in the charge distribution at the frontier orbitals. The attachment of the terminal groups onto the NP skeleton has proved to be effective in promoting the absorption and emission to the far-red and even to the NIR spectral region, thereby leading to tunable HOMO–LUMO energy levels. Furthermore, the BODIPY- or porphyrin-fused NPs (41, and 45, 47) exhibit enhanced NIR absorption and emission. Another type of ladder-type NP-fused dyes (42, BNQs, and 44, TNHs) displays a drastic bathochromic shift compared with that of their monomer, reflecting an intensive planarity and large delocalization of electron wave functions like reported PNs. However, the more extended π-systems led to strong aggregation and increased instability upon long-term exposure to air and light. In contrast, the novel A–D–D–A NIR dye combining the BNQ unit and the electron-withdrawing dicarboximide substituents (43, BNQD) shows excellent solubility, NIR absorption and emission with high molar absorptivity, even high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.55), and increased photostability in comparison with the electron-rich analogue. Remarkably, the BNQ core with flexible alkyl chains successfully yielded one-dimensional liquid crystalline supramolecular lamellar assemblies by the combination of the intermolecular π–π interaction of the aromatic core and the nano-segregation of the building blocks, as demonstrated by two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D WAXS) structural analysis in the solid state.72
3.3 Crystallographic packing motifs
The packing mode of the organic semiconductors becomes very important for the analysis of the charge transport between molecules. It is generally recognized that there are four basic structural packing motifs for PAHs according to Desiraju and Gavezzotti. The majority of PAHs tend to assemble in an edge-to-face fashion with minimal π–π overlap in the solid state. The annulation of heteroatoms in the bay regions of PAHs increases the C/H ratio, generates heteroatom–heteroatom interactions, thus promoting π–π stacking in the solid state. Furthermore, the heteroatom annulated PAHs form one dimensional crystals by predominantly self-assembling through synergistic interactions such as π–π interactions and heteroatom–heteroatom interactions. These one dimensional crystals are preferred for revealing the intrinsic properties of the materials, favouring the study of structure–property relationships, thus realizing high performance organic electronics.
Triphenylene crystallizes in the monoclinic P2 space group with four molecules per unit cell. Like most unfunctionalized PAHs, it adopts an edge-to-face herringbone packing pattern in the solid state. Unlike triphenylene, TPTT (29) is a yellow fine needle and crystallizes in a very rare manner which belongs to the hexagonal crystal system.51 Interestingly, no S–S contacts are observed, and instead the molecules are stacked in a concave–convex fashion along the c-axis with a unique bowl-shaped structure (bowl depths of 0.65 Å), which is shallower compared with parent sumanene with bowl depths of 1.11 Å.73 The difference between the bowl depths is owing to the larger covalent radius of the sulfur atom than that of the carbon atom. The introduction of trisilicon-bridges into the triphenylene skeleton leads to a significant change in structural shape and arrangement. The crystal structure of TSS (30) shows an almost planar molecular core with the phenyl groups flipping up and down.52 Another heterocyclic-annulated resultant based triphenylene, the parent TAC (31), shows a slightly bowl-shaped core with the fused pyridine rings of the rim bending out of the central ring plane by 4.15°, due to the undersized NC bonds in the pyridine rings. And this special structure provides the molecule a rough C3 symmetry with chirality in the solid state (Fig. 13).53
 Fig. 13  Top view and side view of the crystal structures of 29 (a and d), 30 (b and e), and 31 (c and f). 
Perylene crystallizes in a monoclinic P21/a space system. The crystal arrangement of perylene is described as “sandwich-herringbone” packing with respect to the unique [010] axis. In this kind of motif, the two molecules possess strong π–π stacking with an intermolecular distance of 3.47 Å.74 The nitrogen-annulated resultant (NP, 40) shows a sandwich-herringbone packing, while the dimers adopt an antiparallel manner due to the presence of the strong N–H⋯π interactions (2.50–2.76 Å) and possible effects on lowering molecular symmetry. The two molecules recline to around 73.7° relative to the adjacent dimers, and the minimal intermolecular distance between the NP dimers is 3.48 Å, slightly larger than that of parent perylene.
Compared to nitrogen-annulated perylene, the chalcogen-annulated perylenes display drastic difference in the crystal structure. Both the sulfur- and the selenium-annulated perylenes (37 and 38) exhibit slipped π–π stacking arrangement, which are regularly stacked along the b-axis nearly with the same interplanar distances of 3.47 Å.75 Remarkably, marked S⋯S or Se⋯Se short contacts are observed between molecules in the adjacent stacks, which render this kind of chalcogen-annulated perylenes unique with double-channel superstructure. In addition, the distance of Se⋯Se interactions (3.49 Å) in PESE is shorter than that of S⋯S interactions (3.51 Å) in PET molecules, indicating that PESE has a more compressed packing structure (Fig. 14).61
 Fig. 14  Crystal structures of perylene (A) and 36 (NP, B). 
The integration of a second sulfur bridge into the bay-region of perylene leads to a more compressed highly ordered packing mode that enforces cofacial π-stacking with multi-channel for hole transporting directed by S⋯S interactions. The crystals of DTP (39) pack into columns along the b-axis, and strong intermolecular π–π interactions could be found in the stacked columns with the decreased interplane distance of about 3.42 Å. Most importantly, the columns formed through face-to-face π–π slip-stacks and linked by S⋯S interactions (3.45 Å) to form a two-dimensional charge transporting layer. In addition, the tilt angle along the columns is about 38.5° for DTP, while a slightly larger angle of about 39.8° is found in PET stacks. These are characteristics of more overlap of π stacks and the short S⋯S contacts provide another transport pathway which facilitates carrier mobility (Fig. 15).62

3.4 Transistor applications
Due to unique nanostructures and synergistic effects directed by multi-interactions, such as π–π interactions and chalcogen–chalcogen interactions, these HAPs featuring slipped π–π stacking are expected to behave as active layers in OFETs. Successive investigation of well-defined packing arrangement and related nanostructures has led to a unique approach toward high performance organic semiconductors. We have developed a molecular and crystal engineering strategy to control the organization of HAPs in the solid state that enforces cofacial π-stacking with channels for hole transport directed by chalcogen–chalcogen interactions. The double-channel 1D charge transport superstructures induced by marked chalcogen–chalcogen interactions have been successfully achieved involving PET and its selenophene analogue (PESE) as a result of the integration of one sulfur or selenium atom into the perylene skeleton. Single crystalline micrometer sized ribbons of PET were prepared by physical vapor transport techniques. The mobility was in the range of 0.3–0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1. An on/off ratio of 1.7 × 103 and a low threshold voltage of −6.0 V based on these single crystalline microribbons have been achieved. Furthermore, the shelf-life test for one selected transistor under ambient conditions in one week demonstrated the good stability of the PET-based devices, the mobility of which decreased only by 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the on/off ratio was almost the same (Fig. 16).57

Succeedingly, we have prepared single crystalline microribbons of PESE both by drop-casting and physical vapor transport techniques. The transistors based on solution-processed microribbons just displayed a moderate mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The highest mobility approached 2.66 cm2 V−1 s−1 for single crystalline transistors of individual PESE ribbon fabricated using a gold layer glue technique. All examined devices exhibited mobility larger than 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the mobility of more than 90% of the devices exceeded 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is undoubtedly suggested that the shorter Se–Se contacts (3.49 Å) are favorable for efficient carrier transport, i.e., for high mobility.76
Quite recently, we have demonstrated that arrays of single crystal transistors fabricated directly by spin-coating the suspension of DTP nanoribbons in THF–methanol produced excellent mobilities as high as 2.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of up to 106. The calculation and the electron diffraction data indicate that the crystal grew along the [010] direction (i.e., b-axis) due to the optimized π–π stacking of the aromatic plane. In addition, we predicted the room temperature hole mobility in crystals of DTP and PET by a first-principles calculation based on the hopping model coupled with a Random-Walk simulation. The predicted mobility can reach 29.52 and 23.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DTP and PET, respectively. Both the experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the more uniform symmetric molecular structure decorated by two sulfur atoms of DTP directs a two-dimensional transport pathway for holes with the likelihood of multi-channel superstructure.62
4. Conclusions
Detailed and careful investigation of heteroarenes by many groups in the past years has brought about significant progress in the field of high-performance organic semiconductors. Regioselective annulation of heteroatoms into the skeleton of PAHs leads to reduced C–H⋯π interactions and enhanced π–π interactions together with tunable chalcogen–chalcogen interactions. Single-crystalline OFETs based on the related molecules have revealed informative correlations between structural parameters at micro/nano scales and charge transporting properties. However, in-depth understanding of the relationship between molecular structures, packing arrangements, and electronic performances remains challenging. At the same time, scale-up synthesis and excellent processability, especially in non-chlorinated solvents, are also crucial for practical applications.
