    , Accepted 5th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractThe passivation of defects at perovskite grain boundaries (GB) is crucial in achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Unlike the widely used additive passivation method where a mixture of additives and perovskite precursor is used for preparing perovskite films, we herein developed a new defect post-healing method via dip-coating trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) ligands on pre-fabricated carbon-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (MPSCs). Since perovskites have formed before post-healing, TOPO ligands are selectively adsorbed onto the exposed perovskite surface and hence have little influence on charge extraction of interfaces. The defects are post-healed via O atoms in PO bonds coordinated to halide-deficient sites, leading to an enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 11.0% to 12.8%. Moreover, due to the three hydrophobic long chain alkyls in TOPO, the humidity stability of the device has also been improved simultaneously.
Organic/inorganic trihalide lead-based perovskites have been recognized as prominent light harvesters in solar cells due to their special optical and electronic properties, such as tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, long diffusion length, etc.1–5 In the past few years, the PCE of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% in 2009 to over 22% in 2017, especially with the emergence of all solid state MPSCs reported by Grätzel and Park in 2012.3,4,6 One limitation of PSCs is the defects at the perovskite GB, which are always electron trap states and the easiest degradation sites due to their high activity and diffusivity.7–12 So defect passivation is crucial for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs. To date, defect passivation has mainly been achieved by additive passivation methods in which various additives, such as Lewis bases, halogen-related molecules, or electron/hole transport materials, are added during the growth process of perovskite crystals.13–23 For example, Snaith's group reported that Lewis bases of thiophene and pyridine can effectively passivate the trap states of a perovskite via binding to under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and obtained 34% enhancement of the PCE in 2014.13 Subsequently, other Lewis bases, such as π-conjugated IDIC and bifunctional urea, were developed.14–17 Simultaneously, halogen-based additives, such as PbI2, Cu(thiourea)I and quaternary ammonium halides, were also found to be efficient for trap state passivation in PSCs.18–20 Huang et al. first demonstrated that a fullerene electron transport material deposited on a perovskite can effectively suppress trap state recombination.21,22 Moreover, Han and co-workers directly integrated fullerene into the perovskite layer gradually to expand the extent of trap state passivation and obtained a certified PCE of 18.21% with an aperture area of 1.022 cm2 in 2016.23 The unavoidable disadvantage of the above approach is that the additives will form organic molecular layers at the interfaces of the hole transport layer, perovskite film, and electron transport layer due to the airtight sandwich structure of most PSCs.24–28 Therefore, the reported efficient additives were always organic small molecules. For organic long chain molecules, these molecular layers will seriously influence the charge transfer and extraction due to their poor conductivity, which is similar to the case of ligand-capped quantum dot sensitized solar cells.29–34
Hole-conductor-free fully printable carbon-based MPSCs are special due to the nonocclusive perovskite absorber in the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon triple-layer mesoscopic scaffold.35–38 This will give us a new opportunity to avoid the demerits of additive passivation methods and give full play to the advantages of long chain molecular stability. Herein, we developed a defect post-healing method for carbon-based MPSCs via TOPO ligand coordination. TOPO ligands are selectively adsorbed onto the exposed MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite surface via the binding of O atoms in PO bonds with the uncoordinated Pb (Fig. S1†), leading to an enhancement of the PCE from 11.0% to 12.8%. Simultaneously, due to the three hydrophobic long chain alkyls in TOPO, the humidity stability is also significantly improved.
The fabrication process of TOPO capped carbon-based MPSCs is shown in Fig. 1a. Mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon films were screen-printed onto a FTO glass substrate layer by layer. Perovskite is filled into the triple mesoscopic layers directly by a simple precursor solution dip-coating method (step 1). Then TOPO is infiltrated into the perovskite via a post-treated dip-coating method (step 2). Digital images of the triple-layer scaffold at different stages and the optimization of TOPO concentration in chlorobenzene solution are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† From the cross-sectional images in Fig. 2a and b, the mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2, and carbon layers are found to have a thickness of ∼0.6 μm, ∼2 μm, and ∼12 μm, respectively. The MAPbI3 perovskite (mapping of Pb and I) is distributed uniformly in the well-bedded triple-layer scaffold (mapping of Ti, Zr and C) (Fig. 2c). TOPO has a good penetration in the perovskite active layer of ZrO2 from the top carbon electrode and a gradually decreased distribution in the TiO2 layer due to its much denser structure (P mapping). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the chemical states of the TOPO capped MAPbI3 film deposited on mesoscopic TiO2 without the carbon electrode (Fig. S4 and S5†). The weak absorption appearing at 132.5 eV is the characteristic peak of P 2p3/2 in TOPO, which indicates that TOPO adsorbs onto the perovskite crystal surface.39,40 This is further confirmed by the enhanced signal intensity of C 1s and O 1s, and the decreased signal intensity of N 1s, I 3d, and Pb 4f because of the surface sensitivity of XPS. The binding energy peak of Pb 4f7/2 has a slight 0.17 eV energy red-shift from 137.92 to 137.75 eV. This should be attributed to an increased electron shielding of the Pb atomic nucleus and supports the view that TOPO coordinates to the perovskite surface via a shared electron pair. The charge recombination process for MPSCs without TOPO treatment is shown in Fig. 1b. Electron extraction from MAPbI3 to TiO2 (process 1) and hole collection from MAPbI3 to the carbon layer (process 3) can be accomplished. Meanwhile, partial charges will also combine via the electron trap states induced by the halide deficiency in the perovskite (process 2), leading to direct energy loss in devices. After dip-coating TOPO into the perovskite, the TOPO will coordinate to the uncoordinated Pb atoms and then passivate the defects, which can effectively suppress charge recombination via reducing trap states and improve the charge extraction from perovskite to TiO2 (Fig. 1c).

The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the carbon-based MPSCs with/without TOPO treatment are shown in Fig. 3a. The PCE of the TOPO-capped MPSCs is 12.8%, which is higher than that (11.0%) of the pristine SCs. Specifically, the enhancement of short-circuit current (Jsc) from 17.75 mA cm−2 to 18.69 mA cm−2 is in agreement with the enhanced incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the range of 360–770 nm (Fig. 3b). The integrated Jsc from the IPCE for devices without/with TOPO post-treatment is 17.75 and 18.69 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with that (16.17 and 18.16 mA cm−2) derived from J–V curves. This indicates superior charge extraction after TOPO coating. Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured to investigate whether the TOPO coordinated to the halide-deficient site in the perovskite (Fig. 4a and b). The stretching vibration of the PO bond shifted to a lower wavenumber (1105.4 cm−1) for the MAI·PbI2·TOPO adduct, compared with the bare TOPO at 1145.8 cm−1. The red-shift of the PO frequency is due to the decreased force constant according to the harmonic motion of a diatomic model, which is well consistent with the binding of TOPO to the perovskite surface Pb through the O atom in the PO bond.41,42 This also verifies the above XPS results. As to the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. 4c, the equivalent circuit with two RC elements was adopted due to perovskite acting as both the light harvester and hole transporting material (Fig. S6†).43,44 The transfer resistance (Rtr) at high frequency (inset with high magnification) is associated with carrier transport in the selective contact perovskite/carbon. From the fitting results in Table S1,† the similar Rtr value indicates that TOPO has little influence on the contact of perovskite/carbon after TOPO post-treatment due to it being selectively adsorbed onto the exposed perovskite surface. The interfacial recombination resistance (Rrec) value in the low frequency region was found to be 826.8 Ω after TOPO post-treatment, which is larger than that of the pristine devices (383.6 Ω), indicating that charge recombination is effectively restricted by the TOPO coordination. This is consistent with the enhancement of open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.8607 V to 0.9163 V. From the normalized Voc dependence on light intensity in Fig. S7,† the TOPO capped devices have a smaller slope, which indicates prominent trap-assisted recombination.45,46 After the post-treatment of the MAPbI3 film deposited on TiO2 with TOPO, there were no observable differences in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S8†) and the enhancement of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 4d) by a factor of two also confirms the fact that TOPO can suppress the non-radiative recombination via reducing the trap states induced by the uncoordinated Pb atoms. This is further confirmed by the increase in the average lifetime from 57.3 ns to 158.8 ns calculated with a biexponential decay function in the time-resolved PL due to the suppressed fast trap state recombination process (Fig. S9 and Table S2†).47,48 Due to the negligible solubility of the TOPO precursor solution in the perovskite, the surface roughness has been improved simultaneously (Fig. S10 and S11†).

Defect passivation by TOPO can not only suppress the charge trapping, but also decrease the activity and diffusivity of the perovskite GB. Moreover, the long chain alkyls in TOPO are hydrophobic. All of this is beneficial for the humidity stability of the device. The results of humidity stability tests at a relative humidity (RH) of ∼75% for 48 h are shown in Fig. 5a and b. After TOPO post-treatment, the devices can retain 36% of PCE, which is greater than the reserved 0.09% of PCE of pristine devices. Furthermore, the humidity stability of the bare perovskite film was also tested. The films with TOPO exhibited a much lower degradation rate than the pristine film when they were exposed to the RH = 50% environment for different periods of time (Fig. 5e). The hysteresis is negligible for the TOPO capped devices (Fig. 5c) and the photocurrent is quickly stabilized when the light is turned on, which confirms the hysteresis-free behaviour of our devices (Fig. 5d).

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new defect passivation strategy for fully printable carbon-based MPSCs via a simple TOPO post-treatment. The defects at the perovskite GB were healed via coordination between the O atom in TOPO and uncoordinated Pb in perovskite, which boosted the PCE from 11.0% to 12.8%. Moreover, due to the hydrophobicity of the long chain alkyls of TOPO, the humidity stability of the device is also simultaneously improved.
Experimental
Materials
PbI2 (99.9%, Aladdin), TOPO (98%, Alfa Aesar), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (99.5%, Kelong), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.5%, Kelong), TiO2 (Degusssa P25, 20–50 nm), ZrO2 (<100 nm, Aladdin), terpineol (99%, Macklin), ethyl cellulose (EC) (99%, Aladdin), ethanol (99.7%, Kelong), acetone (99.5%, Kelong), chlorobenzene (CB) (99%, Sinopharm), and diethyl ether (99%, Kelong) were purchased. MAI was synthesized according to the literature.35 Perovskite precursor: 1 mmol PbI2, 1 mmol MAI and 1 mmol DMSO were dissolved in 1 ml DMF and stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. TiO2 (or ZrO2) paste: 8 g TiO2 (or ZrO2) and 4 g EC were added into 30 ml terpineol and 15 ml ethanol, followed by stirring using ball milling for 2 h. Carbon paste: 2 g carbon black power was mixed with 6 g graphite powder in a 30 ml terpineol solution, and then 1 g ZrO2 powder (in order to improve the mechanical strength and bonding performance of the carbon electrode) and 1 g EC were added into the solution, followed by stirring using ball milling for 2 h.
The fabrication of fully printable carbon-based MPSCs
The FTO glass substrates (NSG) were etched with a laser and cleaned by ultrasonication with detergent, DI water, acetone and ethanol. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the patterned substrates by aerosol spray pyrolysis of titanium diisopropoxide-bis-(acetylacetonate) solution at 450 °C. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the TiO2, ZrO2, and carbon films were screen-printed on the substrates layer by layer. The TiO2 and ZrO2 layers were sintered at 450 °C for 40 min, and the carbon layer was sintered at 350 °C for 1 h, forming the mesoporous triple-layer-based scaffold. The resulting films were infiltrated with 4 μl perovskite precursor solution via dip-coating and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The fabricated MPSCs were stored at RH 45% and 25 °C for 48 h to stabilize their efficiency. For the TOPO post-treatment, 4 μl 1 mM TOPO CB solution was dripped onto the carbon electrode for a certain time (∼30 s) to infiltrate the perovskite and then the excess solution was removed at 4000 rpm for 20 s.
The fabrication of MAPbI3 perovskite film
The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the FTO glass at 4000 rpm for 25 s and 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was slowly dripped onto the rotating substrate in 10 s before the surface changed to become turbid, caused by rapid vaporization of DMF. The transparent film was heated at 65 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 2 min in order to obtain a dense MAPbI3 film. The TOPO post-treatment is similar to that adopted for the carbon-based perovskite solar cells.
Characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu 3600 UV-vis near-infrared spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set to 450 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was performed on an FLS 980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Inc) with an excitation wavelength of 510 nm. XRD investigations were carried out using a D/max-2500/PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). FTIR spectra were collected using a VERTEX 70 from Bruker Company. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI550 spectrometer with Mg Kα excitation (1253.6 eV). The binding energy calibration was based on SiO2 at 103.0 eV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a BioScope Resolve in the tapping mode. The SEM and mapping tests were performed on a field-emission SEM (FEI Inspect F50). For current–voltage measurements, a solar simulator (model 66902) from Newport, which has a 300 W xenon lamp with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (equivalent to one sun at AM1.5G) at the surface of the solar cell, was used. A black mask with a circular aperture (0.08 cm2) smaller than the size of the device active area (0.64 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. EIS measurements were carried out by applying a 10 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions at open circuit voltage by using an electrochemical workstation (CS350, CorrTest). The IPCE was measured with a 300 W xenon lamp and a lock-in amplifier (Oriel) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm.
