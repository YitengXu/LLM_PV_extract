    , Accepted 25th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractFormamidinium (FA)-based perovskite materials show an extended absorption spectrum to 840 nm, which enables high power conversion efficiencies of over 20% compared with normal-structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is rarely possible to obtain high performance in inverted-structure PSCs owing to the unbalanced electron–hole transport properties. To achieve desirable electronic qualities in a FA perovskite film, it is necessary to substantially improve the crystallinity of the perovskite films. A new perovskite growth method is presented here using methylammonium chloride (MACl) to assist vertical recrystallization in a formamidinium perovskite film. The obtained film consists of highly crystallized vertically-orientated grains, which minimize the vertical grain boundary and trap site in the films, and later contribute to a power conversion efficiency above 20% in inverted-structure PSCs. Most importantly, the highly crystalline, phase-pure morphology and low MA content in formamidinium perovskite films can contribute to the light-soaking stability and thermal stability up to 500 h in solar-cell devices.

Broader context
Mixed-cation formamidinium perovskite with high crystallinity was realized by a new method, namely “vertical crystallization”. This method can achieve inverted-structure perovskite solar cells with an efficiency as high as 20.6% and light soaking and thermal stability as long as 500 h in perovskite solar cells.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted extensive attention as light absorbers in solar cells due to their excellent photovoltaic properties, which have enabled a boost in power conversion efficiency to 22% based on a low-cost fabrication process.1–5 The rapid progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has involved advances in device structures, typically of normal structures (with the electron-transporting layer at the front) or inverted structures (with the hole-transporting layer at the front).6 It is worth noting that most of the certified PSC efficiencies of over 20% have been achieved on normal-structured mesoporous-TiO2-based devices.7–9 In contrast, inverted-structure devices have exhibited many advantages such as simple device fabrication, small hysteresis, and high stability, prompting considerable debate about which structure would be most promising for future large-scale application.10–13 Therefore, it is highly desirable to further improve the performance of PSCs with inverted structures.
Among the perovskite materials used in PSCs, formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite materials have broader light absorption spectra, extending to 840 nm,14–16 which enables high efficiencies of over 20% on normal-structure PSCs.17–19 However, it is relatively difficult to obtain high efficiencies with FA-based inverted-structure PSCs. Previous studies have indicated that the photo-excited electrons are generated near the hole-transporting layer owing to the large light absorption coefficients. This results in a longer diffusion path of these photoelectrons in inverted-structure PSCs, and thus the electron collection efficiency is poorer in comparison with that of normal-structure PSCs.12 Recently, we proposed a heterojunction engineering method to form a graded heterojunction to overcome this shortage and realize an efficiency of 18.2%.12 This has encouraged more efforts to further improve the device performance of inverted-structure PSCs. In fact, it was noted that the high crystalline quality of perovskite films is a prerequisite for desirable optoelectronic qualities in FA-based PSCs.20 Some efforts have been made in FA perovskites, such as adding acid (HI, HCl),21–23 polymer (poly(methyl methacrylate); PMMA),24 small molecules (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester; PCBM)25 or organic halides (methylammonium chloride or fluoride; MACl or FACl),26–28 to form intermediate adducts with Pb2+ to slow down crystal growth to increase the grain size and crystallinity. However, these additive methods usually trigger uncontrollable nucleation sites and quantities in the film, which results in a limit in the improvement in perovskite grain growth and crystallinity. Hence, a simple and effective method for substantially increasing the crystallinity of FA perovskites is highly desirable for inverted-structure PSCs.
In this work, we propose a new method, namely “vertical recrystallization”, to prepare FA-based perovskite films with high crystallinity, achieving stabilized high efficiency in inverted-structure PSCs. Unlike conventional methods involving the introduction of additives in precursors, we control the recrystallization process of the pre-deposited yellow δ-phase FAPbI3 film by deposition of a certain amount of MACl on top to trigger homogeneous nucleation. Upon annealing, MACl vertically diffused into the δ-phase FAPbI3 films to realize the phase transformation to black α-phase FA perovskite. Via the present facile vertical recrystallization process, we obtained compact FA-based perovskite film with large grains and high crystallinity. As a result, the FA-based inverted-structure PSCs exhibit higher photocurrent and photovoltage output, owing to a reduced carrier recombination in the perovskite layer. The device achieved a photon-to-current conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.65%, with high stability under a 500 h light soaking and thermal aging test, which is the highest performance in an FA-based inverted-structure PSC to date.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the step-by-step process of the vertical recrystallization method. A mixed FAI/PbI2 precursor solution was spin-coated on pre-spray NiOx fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. A yellow δ-phase of FAPbI3 was quickly produced at room temperature, as indicated by the peak at 11.8° in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, corresponding to the typical P63mc with a hexagonal non-perovskite structure (Fig. 1b). A volatile methylammonium halide (MACl) was selected to avoid additional halide in the FA perovskite film and also for control over the MA content in the FA perovskite film. The MACl in isopropanol solution was coated on δ-FAPbI3 film. Once the MACl was coated on the δ-FAPbI3 film, we found that the yellow film turned light-brown. We deduced that the MACl had started to react with the surface of the δ-FAPbI3 and assist the phase transition of FAPbI3 from its δ-phase to the α-phase at the film surface. During annealing at 100 °C, diffused MACl accelerated downward into FAPbI3, and the film gradually turned dark brown, which was an indication of the formation of a black α-phase, which was also verified by XRD measurements (Fig. 1c). The films were further annealed at 140 °C for 20 min to decompose MACl residues in the film, since the film would degrade quickly if Cl ions were to remain in the film.29

The cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows the morphology of the perovskite films (Fig. 1e), and reveals that a compact film with single grain in the vertical direction was formed after MACl treatment. This result can be attributed to the unique film growth process, which we describe as a “vertical recrystallization process”. In this process, MACl would first migrate into the δ-phase FAPbI3 film, and then assist the recrystallization of FAPbI3 to the black α-phase. Since the recrystallization process is initiated from the top to the bottom within the film, the resulting vertical morphology was found to be based on single, large-sized crystallites, supporting our claims. In contrast, without MACl treatment, the grain size of the δ-FAPbI3 film was relatively small (Fig. S1, ESI†). After annealing, the small grains maintained in the FAPbI3 film and several perovskite grains were packed in the vertical direction indicating that no vertical recrystallization was involved, as shown in Fig. 1d. This vertical recrystallization process is very different from the previously reported approaches that obtain perovskite films from a mixture precursor of MACl:FAI and PbI2. In these reported approaches, the crystal nucleation started randomly inside the film, and the films always showed small grains with poor crystallinity. To reproduce these results, we fabricated perovskite films using the reported methods and, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), there are no signs of vertical recrystallization, and the morphology is consistently poor as in previous reports,26 and played a limited role in improving the efficiency of the device (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To further explore the importance of the MACl on the quality of the final treated FA perovskite film, we examined the effect of different MACl solution concentrations. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of a FA perovskite film treated with several MACl concentrations. Without MACl treatment, the FAPbI3 film consists of small crystallites (100–300nm in size). After treatment with 1mg ml−1 MACl, the grain size of the FA perovskite film becomes larger. We also observed that small crystallites existed near the grain boundary. This may be because a small concentration of MACl is not sufficient for completing the phase transition of FAPbI3, which will be discussed later. When the MACl concentration increased to 5mg ml−1, compact grains up to the micron size were found in the FA perovskite film. With further increases of MACl concentration up to 10mg ml−1, the morphology of the FA perovskite film was generally the same as the film treated with 5 mg ml−1 MACl. However, the grain sizes were smaller (around 500 nm) because more nucleation would likely be formed on top of the δ-FAPbI3 film at a higher MACl concentration. Nevertheless, the average particle size became clearly bigger by MACl treatment, as compared with the untreated samples. Such dramatic morphology changes suggest that this simple post-growth treatment with MACl molecules vertically diffusing into the pre-cast δ-phase FAPbI3 film can effectively recrystallize and reconstruct perovskite thin films in a favorable way in the device fabrication.

Fig. 3a shows the MACl concentration effect on the recrystallization of the FAPbI3 film. Since a peak of 13.8° observed in the XRD pattern was assigned to the α-phase of the perovskite crystal, the intensity could be used to estimate the crystallinity. Although a sample treated with 1mg ml−1 MACl showed three-times higher intensity compared with the untreated one, a small peak at 11.8° corresponding to the δ-phase of FAPbI3 was still observed in the XRD pattern, confirming that the phase transition of FAPbI3 was incomplete when treated with 1mg ml−1 MACl. When the concentration increased to 5 mg ml−1 MACl, the XRD intensity for the α-phase was about 20 times greater compared with the untreated FAPbI3 films. It is important to note the intensity peak of δ-phase disappear, suggesting a complete phase transformation from the δ-phase to the black α-phase. On further increases in MACl concentration, the X-ray intensity remained as strong as in the 5 mg ml−1 sample. The significant change in the intensity after the 5 mg ml−1 MACl treatment corresponds to the grain size greatly increasing, as shown in the SEM images. Such dramatic change in crystallinity suggests that this MACl recrystallization method can effectively yield a desirable highly recrystallized perovskite film for fabricating devices with optimized efficiency and stability.

(d) Lattice parameter of FAPbI3, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3/MACl film. The red line is linear fitting of the lattice parameters. The lattice parameter is calculated from Bragg equation: 2dsinθ = nλ (λ = 1.54056 Å). 
The light absorption properties of FA-based perovskite films with MACl concentration are shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S5, ESI.† The absorbance of the FAPbI3 film at a visible wavelength is lower than the FAPbI3/MACl films due to the incomplete phase transformation in the pristine FAPbI3 film. When treated with 1 or 5 mg ml−1, little blue shift of edge (less than 2 nm) in the absorbance spectrum was observed. When treated with a high concentration MACl of 10 mg ml−1, a blue shift (10 nm) in the absorbance occurred, which would lead to an unnecessary decrease in the corresponding photocurrent. Through this phenomenon, we deduced that there was a competition between FA and MA cations under heating at 140 °C, and a noticeable quantity of MA cations were incorporated into the perovskite crystals and replaced FA. To determine the stoichiometry in the FAPbI3/MACl recrystallization film, elemental analysis was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The signal of Cl in the perovskite films treated by MACl at 10mg ml−1 was not detected, indicating that the Cl− had been removed during the annealing process due the volatile nature of MACl,28 since the MACl would easily decompose to MA and HCl, and HCl could be released from the film (Fig. S6, ESI†).
On the other hand, the MA content in the perovskite film can be determined from the peak shift at (110) of the perovskite film in the XRD pattern,9,30 as shown in Fig. 2c. The pseudocubic lattice parameters calculated from the XRD peaks are 6.368 Å, 6.357 Å and 6.336 Å, for a perovskite film fabricated using 1, 5 and 10 mg ml−1 MACl treatment respectively, as summarized in Table S2, ESI.† As indicated in Fig. 2d, the lattice parameters can be assigned as x = ∼0.05, x = ∼0.14 and x = ∼0.38. Thus, the ratio of the MA/FA compositions in the FAPbI3 film treated with 1, 5 and 10 mg ml−1 MACl were MA0.05FA0.95, MA0.14FA0.86 and MA0.38FA0.62, respectively.30 These results suggest that the MA cations have a strong interaction with the FA perovskite materials and are left in the FA perovskite lattice. Compared with existing methods that need a large quantity of MA cations to stabilize the FAPbI3 perovskite phase (in this case, 70% of the total cations),31,32 this method can produce high-quality FA-based perovskite films at a much lower MA ratio. In the optimal case where MACl was at 5 mg ml−1 concentration, we obtained the phase-pure crystallites with minimal MA impurity content below 20%, while the phase-pure mix-cation FA crystallites can only be obtained when the MA content reaches 70% using the currently existing methods.31,32 This largely reduced MA ratio in the FAPbI3 film could lead to greatly improved thermal stability of the perovskite film, as revealed by the thermal aging testing at 100 °C for 100 h in a glove box (Fig. S8, ESI†). A strong peak at 12.6° assigned to the PbI2 was observed for the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 film fabricated by the reported method after thermal aging testing at 100 °C for 100 h in a glove box, indicating that the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 film underwent a certain degree of decomposition.31,32 By contrast, only a low PbI2 peak was observed in the XRD spectrum of the FAPbI3/MACl film, showing that the reduced MA ratio in the FA perovskite film favors better thermal stability.
To examine the effect of high crystallinity on device performance, we used the FAPbI3/MACl films to fabricate inverted-structure PSCs (FTO/NiOx/FAPbI3/PCBM/TiOx/Ag). Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves for cells based on the FAPbI3 films with and without MACl treatment. The pristine FAPbI3-based PSC displayed a low PCE of 13.24% with JSC of 19.57mAcm−2, VOC of 0.91V and fill factor (FF) of 0.741. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows data for the PCEs of the pristine FAPbI3-based PSC from several batches, with PCEs around 9–14%. With the 1 mg ml−1 MACl treatment, the device efficiency slightly increased to 15.72%. In the case of 5 mg ml−1 MACl treatment, a largely improved device performance was obtained, achieving JSC of 23.09 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.10V and FF of 0.814, and a PCE of 20.65%, which is 56% higher than that of the pristine FAPbI3-based PSC cell. The J–V curves of forward and reverse scanning for FAPbI3 or FAPbI3/MAPbI3 PSCs show a small hysteresis, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4b) show that the average EQE is about 10% higher than that of pristine FAPbI3-based PSCs, indicating enhanced charge collection at both electrodes, contributing to the improvement of JSC. The large enhancement of VOC in this cell is mainly due to the reduced recombination loss.

(g) Stability data of pristine FAPbI3-based PSC and FAPbI3/MACl (5 mg ml−1)-based PSC, aged under continuous AM 1.5 light soaking (square dot lines, at maximum power point, temperature of ∼25 °C), or aged at 85 °C (triangle dot lines, at dark). 
To confirm the importance of crystallization on the electronic properties of FAPbI3 films, we performed photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TPL) measurements to study the carrier transport and recombination of the perovskite layer. We deposited the FAPbI3 layer with and without MACl vertical recrystallization on bare glass and performed the PL and TPL measurement illuminated from the perovskite surface side, as shown in Fig. 4c–e. As a result, Fig. 4c shows the PLQE and PL spectra (excited by 532 nm light) of the two types of film. For the control film (FAPbI3 without MACl recrystallization), the PLQE rises with increasing excitation fluorescence, which is attributed to the filling of the trap states. Compared with the control film, the PLQEs of the FAPbI3/MACl film were almost the same at all excitation intensities, and the values were higher than those of the control film, suggesting a significantly reduced nonradiative electron–hole recombination within the FAPbI3/MACl perovskite film, contributing to the high photocurrent output of PSCs. Moreover, a small blue shift can be observed for the PL peak of the MACl recrystallization sample, as shown in Fig. 4d, indicating that the FAPbI3/MACl film has a reduced band edge traps state. Fig. 4f shows TPL decay for the two samples. The decay can be well fitted with exponential components. Longer decay lifetimes were used as indicators of better material quality and optoelectronic performance. The FAPbI3/MACl film showed a considerably longer lifetime (τ, 274.5 ns) than that of the pristine FAPbI3 film (τ, 77.3 ns). The results indicate that improved crystalline quality can significantly reduce the defects and associated charge recombination in the perovskite layer, which enables the observed open-circuit voltage from the corresponding solar cells.
To understand the recombination of the photogenerated carriers during device operation, the dependence of the open-circuit voltage (Vλ) on light intensity was studied, as shown in Fig. 4g. At Vλ, there is no flow of current, which means that all the photogenerated charge carriers could recombine in the perovskite film. The relationship between Vλ and light intensity is shown in the equation: (1)where Vλ is the open-voltage at different light intensities, Vs is the open-voltage at standard light (1 Sun), Pλ is different light intensities, Ps is one standard light intensity (1.5 M 100 mW cm−2), n is an ideal factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge.
By linearly fitting VOCversus log-scaled light intensity, we obtained an n-value of 1.85 for a low crystallinity device (pristine FAPbI3-based PSC) and a smaller n-value of 1.26 for the high crystallinity device (FAPbI3/MACl-based PSC). The corresponding charge carrier recombination process is reflected by the value of “n” derived from the slope of the VOCversus incident light intensity .33 Ideally, in the case of a device without trapping of charge carriers, the n-value would be equal to unit. When n approaches 2, trap-assisted recombination dominates in the device, which suggests a trap-assisted recombination dominates in the device.34 In pristine FAPbI3-based PSC, the n-value is 1.85, approaching 2, indicating trap-assisted recombination dominates in device. This could be a result of the low crystallinity and increase in grain boundaries that would cause a higher electronic disorder in the pristine FAPbI3 film. In contrast, the n-value of FAPbI3/MACl-based PSC is 1.26, approaching 1, suggesting a free carrier recombination dominated in the device, similar to that observed in high-quality MAPbI3 devices.33 This further confirms that at AM 1.5 intensities, the current is dominated by the diffusion processes and does not affect the charge transport, enabling us to achieve high VOC and high PCEs of over 20%.
It should be noted that if we treated FAPbI3 film with a higher MACl concentration (10 mg ml−1), the photocurrent was reduced as compared with the samples obtained by the 5 mg ml−1 MACl treatment, since more MA cations were left in the film and the absorption spectrum was narrowed. The EQE spectrum narrowed by about 10 nm when MA ratio was increased to 38% (in 10 mg ml−1 MACl treated samples), as shown in Fig. 4b. In the case of the 1 and 5 mg ml−1 MACl treated sample, the MA ratio was less than 20% and the EQE spectrum edge showed negligibly small change in the infrared region. Hence, we could obtain a high-quality FA perovskite film without sacrificing the light absorption and photocurrent by controlling the MACl concentration. By the vertical recrystallization method, the cells also showed excellent reproducibility in that the statistical PCE of devices showed narrow PCE distribution of FAPbI3/MACl-based inverted-PSCs (Fig. S7, ESI†).
We further examined the device stability of the inverted-structure PSCs. Fig. 4f shows light-soaking stability, where the photovoltaic performance of pristine FAPbI3-based PSC and FAPbI3/MACl-based PSC was measured every 100 h, aging under white light illumination (100 mW cm−2) at the maximum power point. The FAPbI3/MACl-based PSC showed excellent stability, with less than 15% degradation after 500 h illumination, while the pristine FAPbI3-based device quickly decayed in the first 100 h. The FAPbI3/MACl-based devices showed enhanced light stability in ambient conditions by attributing to its high crystallinity and improved phase stability against the light.20 Furthermore, the thermal stability of the pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3/MACl cells was measured at 85 °C (Fig. 4f). It is interesting that both the pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3/MACl-based cells showed excellent thermal stability, with less than 10% degradation after 500 h, indicating that FAPbI3/MACl-based device had an excellent thermal stability similar to that of pristine FAPbI3-based devices. Concluding from above, by suppressing the content of MA, the device obtained by the MACl recrystallization method did not suffer major degradation in the thermal stability.
Conclusion
We propose a vertical recrystallization method to prepare high-quality FA-based perovskite film, in which a phase transformation from the δ-phase to α-phase occurred and resulted in a compact and vertically-orientated single-grain-like morphology inside the film. The obtained films exhibited high crystallinity and fewer MA cations in comparison with other methods, contributing to a wide absorption spectrum and the high thermal stability of the perovskite film, in comparison with similar MA/FA perovskite films obtained by existing methods. When applied to the high-quality FA perovskite film in inverted-structure PSCs, a PCE of >20% is achieved, attributed to the reduced vertical grain boundary and trap site in the perovskite films. The feature of highly crystalline, phase-pure morphology and low MA content in the formamidinium perovskite film can contribute to the light-soaking stability and thermal stability up to 500 h in solar-cell device. Thus, the present vertical recrystallization method provides an easy strategy for developing high performance, FA-based inverted-structure PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were commercially available and used as purchased, including PbI2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), HC(NH2)2I, CH3NH3Cl (>98%, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Japan), nickel acetylacetonate (95%, Sigma-Aldrich), PC61BM (99.5%, Lumtec Co., Taiwan). Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (99%), lithium acetate (99%) and super dehydrated solvents of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), toluene, chlorobenzene, acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol were all purchased from Wako Co., Japan.
Solar cell fabrication
Devices with an FTO/NiOx/FAPbI3/PCBM/TiOx/Ag structure were prepared as follows: FTO glasses were put in detergent, deionized water, ethanol and acetone successively, and thoroughly washed using ultrasonic cleaners. The cleaned FTO glasses were placed on a hotplate at a temperature of 500 °C. To deposit the NiOx layer, 30 ml of an acetonitrile/ethanol (with 95:5 volume ratio) solution of nickel acetylacetonate (with 15 mol% magnesium acetate tetrahydrate and 5 mol% lithium acetate, totally 0.02 mol l−1) was sprayed, and an NiOx layer with a thickness of approximately 30 nm was obtained. Doping of 5 mol% Li+ into the NiO film was performed to increase the p-conductivity, and doping of 15 mol% Mg+ into the NiO film was performed to adjust the valence band (EVB). The optimization of the NiOx layer with Li+ and Mg+ doping can be found in previous work.10 After spraying, the film was further annealed at 500 °C for 15 min to promote NiO crystallization. After cooling, the NiO-coated FTO glasses were transferred to the N2-filled glove box.
The method for perovskite layer deposition was modified from a previous report:10 first, an 80 μl 1.2 M DMSO/DMF (1:5) solution of PbI2/FAI (1:1) mixture was spread onto FTO glass; then, the spin-coater was started at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for another 30 s. 100 μl chlorobenzene (CB) was drop-cast quickly at 10 s after the 5000 rpm spin-coating started. Then 20 μl of different concentrations of MACl solution (0, 1, 5 and 10 mg ml−1, isopropanol) were spin-cast on the top of the film at 5000 rpm. The perovskite films were formed by heating at 100 °C for 10 min and further annealing at 140 °C for 20 min. After cooling, the PCBM solution (20 mg ml−1 dissolved in CB) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then, 100 μl TiOx precursor solution, containing titanium isopropoxide (with 5 mol% niobium ethoxide, diluted in methanol with a volume ratio of 1:500), was drop-cast onto the surface of the PCBM layer at 6000 rpm. The film was then dried at 70 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. To promote hydrolysis of the deposited titanium isopropoxide and to form the TiOx layer, 150 μl of the H2O/methanol (1:99) mixed solution was drop-cast slowly at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, an Ag film with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited under high vacuum (<3 × 10−4 Pa) in the evaporator chamber. To seal the solar cells, the edge of cavity glass was smeared with UV glue, and covered on the top of the FTO glass with active films in-between. The UV glue was solidified by exposure to 300 W UV light for 15 s. The sealing process was performed in a glove box. All the J–V parameters were obtained using these sealed devices.
Characterizations
Current–voltage characteristics were measured with voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 50 ms using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2 under standard air mass 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan). Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki). SEM images (top-view SEM and cross-sectional SEM) were obtained using a JSM-6500F field-emission SEM. The XRD pattern was measured using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The UV-vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV/Vis 3600 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. The steady-state photoluminescence spectrum and quantum efficiency were measured by absolute quantum yield measurement system equipped with a 532 nm continuous wave (CW) laser excitation source, an integrating sphere and fiber-coupled detector (Ocean Optics MayaPro). Time-resolved photoluminescence decay was acquired using a time-correlated single photon counting setup, excited by a 405 nm pulse laser with an excitation energy of 100 μW and repetition rate of 5 MHz. The XPS were performed in a Kratos Ultra Spectrometer (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W) using monochromatized Al Kα X-ray photons (hv = 1486.6 eV for XPS) and an HeI (21.2 eV for UPS) discharge lamp. The light-soaking stability was tested in a solar-cell light-resistance test system (Model BIR – 50, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD), which was equipped with a Class AAA solar simulator; <420 nm UV light was cut off with an optical filter. Thermal stability was tested under controlled temperature at 85 °C in an electronic constant temperature/humidity chamber (THR030FA, Advantec Co., Ltd).

Broader context
Mixed-cation formamidinium perovskite with high crystallinity was realized by a new method, namely “vertical crystallization”. This method can achieve inverted-structure perovskite solar cells with an efficiency as high as 20.6% and light soaking and thermal stability as long as 500 h in perovskite solar cells.
