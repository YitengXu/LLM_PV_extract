    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 15th January 2020AbstractInverted structure ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) are designed by blending J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 as the donor and Y6 as the acceptor. J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films can replenish the weak absorption of PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films at medium wavelengths and broaden near-infrared wavelength absorption windows. At the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2, J61/Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2/Y6 triple interface, the more efficient exciton dissociation is formed in the ternary photoactive layers due to the good compatibility among J61, PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6. Simultaneously, effective hole transport occurs at the blend donors due to the similar highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of both J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2. Optimized ternary PSCs have a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.88%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.04 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V and a fill factor (FF) of 70.4%. Approximately 10.9% and 15.7% PCE improvements are obtained compared to J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs, respectively, as a result of the simultaneous increase of the JSC and the FF of the optimized ternary PSCs. The broad and weak crystallinity peak and high crystallization temperatures of the optimized ternary photoactive layer are beneficial for better thermal stability. After a thermal annealing treatment of optimized ternary PSCs at 80 °C for 20 hours, 79% of the initial PCE was observed compared with only 72% and 70% of the initial PCE for J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs, respectively, under the same thermal stress conditions.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a binary photoactive layer containing a blend of a polymeric donor (D) and a fullerene acceptor have dominated the research on PSCs.1,2 However, the major challenges of fullerene-acceptor-based binary PSCs are the weak long wavelength and near-infrared wavelength absorption performance of the fullerene acceptor (the absorption peaks are located at 240 nm and 380 nm for PCBM and PC71BM, respectively) and the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (the LUMO energy levels are −4.1 eV and −3.9 eV for PCBM and PC71BM, respectively).3,4 To overcome these challenges, fullerene-free acceptors have recently been vigorously developed to replace common fullerene derivative small molecule acceptor materials for high-performance PSCs; these new materials play an important role in adjusting the LUMO and HOMO energy levels to match the donor energy levels and red shifting the absorption peaks and broad absorption windows to match the light spectrum of an AM 1.5 G solar simulator.5–7 The Yingping group first reported non-fullerene PSCs with Y6 as the acceptor and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7%.8 The Qiang group reported further improved photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene binary PSCs with Y6 as the acceptor and the PCE is 16.35%.9 The Erjun group synthesized new polymers PE2 and PE63 as donors and Y6 as the acceptor and achieved a better photovoltaic performance.10,11 The Jianhui group synthesized chlorinated low bandgap acceptor BTP-4Cl by replacing the halogen atoms of the fluorinated nonfullerene acceptor Y6 and achieved the highest PCE for single-junction PSCs.12
To further broaden absorption windows and adjust energy levels, the ternary strategy, in which another donor or acceptor is introduced into the binary photoactive layer, has been employed to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Recently, ternary PSCs with a second donor as third component materials (D1:D2:A) have received considerable interest due to their long wavelength and near infrared region (NIR) absorption windows for non-fullerene acceptors and the overlap of the medium and long wavelength absorption region of the donor blend (adjusting the ratio of D1:D2).13–15 The use of wide- or medium-bandgap (Eg ≥ 2.0 eV) donors in narrow-bandgap (Eg ≅ 1.4–1.7 eV) donors extends the light absorption of the ternary photoactive layer to cover the range from visible light to the near-infrared region and enables the utilization of medium wavelength, long wavelength and near-infrared photons.16 Simultaneously, the LUMO levels and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the two donors are different, and introducing charge trap centres at the D1/D2 interface is inevitable. Because the excitons generated in D1 and D2 by absorbing incident light must first be separated at the D1/A and D2/A interface, electrons are collected at the cathode via an acceptor channel in the acceptor, whereas holes are collected at the anode via a hole channel in D1 and D2. In the ideal case, efficient exciton dissociation and electron transport are expected when the two donors and one acceptor have a cascading alignment of LUMO levels, whereas the similar HOMO levels of the two donors for efficient hole transport between D1 and D2 are not strongly affected by the alignment of the HOMO levels of the two donors due to the absence of an energy barrier caused by HOMO level differences between the donors.
Thus, the second donor should facilitate the requirement of avoiding the formation of deep charge traps, and there should be good compatibility among the three materials in addition to the large energy level offset between the donor and acceptor and the complementary absorption peaks of the ternary photoactive layer materials.24,31 Here, recent progress in ternary OSCs with donors as third component materials is summarized in Table 1. Ternary OSCs based on Y6 as the acceptor have aroused considerable interest due to the higher photovoltaic performance of Y6-based binary OSCs. The recent progress of ternary OSCs based on Y6 as the acceptor is listed in Table 2.

Considerable photovoltaic performance progress has been made in the development of ternary PSCs, and improving thermal stability is of vital importance to guarantee a long operational lifetime.32,33 The thermal stability of the photoactive layer and the lifetime of PSCs are governed by the choice of the photoactive layer materials, and morphological instability and material aggregation/crystallization of the ternary photoactive layer under thermal stress.34,35 In addition, achieving a high photovoltaic performance under a continuous thermal annealing treatment remains a major challenge due to difficulties in maintaining an optimally blended morphology.22,36,37 Based on these insights, we used two donors with high crystallization temperatures, identical HOMO levels, a cascading alignment of LUMO levels, and complementary absorption. To address the interconnected challenges related to photovoltaic performance and thermal stability, we report a highly efficient non-fullerene ternary PSC based on non-fullerene Y6 as the acceptor and a blend of J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 as the donor (J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 are defined as the first and second donor materials, respectively), which is complementary to the absorption region of the binary photoactive layer and has similar HOMO energy levels. J61, PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6 exhibit a cascading alignment of LUMO levels (the LUMO values of −3.08, −3.90 and −4.1 eV correspond to J61, PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6, respectively), whereas the HOMO values of both J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 (5.32 and 5.33, respectively) are similar, which helps to optimize exciton dissociation at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2/Y6 interface and avoid the formation of deep hole traps at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface.38,39 Additionally, J61 exhibits remarkably blue-shifted absorption peaks relative to PffBTT2-DPPT2 (the two absorption peaks of PffBTT2-DPPT2 are located at 724 and 795 nm, and the two absorption peaks of J61 are located at 546 and 601 nm), which helps to harvest medium wavelength photons. The J61:Y6-based binary PSCs achieve a PCE of 13.51% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.6 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 67.8% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V. PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 12.99%, a JSC of 22.62 mA cm−2, an FF of 69.2% and a VOC of 0.83 V. At a ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 of 0.7:0.3, the optimized PCE was achieved, with a PCE of 14.88%, a JSC of 25.79 mA cm−2, an FF of 70.4% and a VOC of 0.82 V. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimized ternary PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability. The chemical structure of the materials used (J61, PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6) and the schematic diagram of the device structure are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Photovoltaic performances and optical properties
To evaluate the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2, we fabricated J61:Y6- and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs with a donor and acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.3 and J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based ternary PSCs (the ratio of the blend donor and acceptor is 1:1.3). The inverted PSCs had a configuration of ITO/ZnO/J61x:PffBTT2-DPPT21−x:Y6/MoO3/Ag (where x is the concentration parameter selected from 1, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65 and 0). The average photovoltaic parameter was obtained from ten OSCs fabricated in parallel. Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of J61:Y6- and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs and optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based ternary PSCs, and the dependence of the four parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) of all the PSCs on the ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 is summarized in Table 3. The J61:Y6-based binary PSCs exhibited a PCE of 12.51%, an FF of 67.8%, a JSC of 22.78 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.81 V. For the PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs, the PCE, FF, JSC and VOC were 11.99%, 68.2%, 20.88 mA cm−2 and 0.83 V, respectively. Although the PCE of PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs is lower than that of J61:Y6 binary PSCs, the photovoltaic performance is significantly enhanced by incorporating appropriate PffBTT2-DPPT2 content in J61:Y6 binary films. When the blend donor replaced the neat donor, it improved the photovoltaic parameters and enhanced the photovoltaic performance. The optimized ternary PSCs with a J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 ratio of 0.7:0.3 had a PCE of 13.88%, an FF of 70.4%, a JSC of 24.04 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.82 V, an enhancement of 10.9% and 15.7% compared with the J61:Y6- and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs, respectively. Compared with J61:Y6 binary OSCs, the JSC and FF of ternary PSCs first increased and then decreased along with the increase of the PffBTT2-DPPT2 content. The JSC and FF are markedly increased to 24.04 mA cm−2 and 70.4% when the ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 is 0.7:0.3. The VOC value monotonically enhanced along with the increase of the PffBTT2-DPPT2 content and achieved the highest value for PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs. The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) are summarized in Table 2 (details on the calculation of RS and RSH are shown in the ESI†). The optimized ternary OSCs displayed the minimum RS and maximum RSH compared to the other PSCs, which is further consistent with the highest FF value of optimized ternary PSCs.21,40,41Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs shown in Fig. 2a. The calculated JSC values from EQE curves are 22.09, 23.19 and 20.43 mA cm−2 for J61:Y6-based binary PSCs, optimized ternary PSCs and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs. The average errors of both the measured JSC values (22.78, 24.04 and 21.18 mA cm−2 for J61:Y6-based binary PSCs, optimized ternary PSCs and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs, respectively) and the calculated JSC values are lower than 5%. It clearly illustrates the agreement with the higher JSC of the PSCs mentioned above. For this improvement in the photovoltaic performance and the EQE curve with PffBTT2-DPPT2 concentration, the enhancement in optical absorption should not be the only reason and the charge carrier dynamics play an important role.

Both J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 exhibited dramatically different absorption spectra. The extinction coefficients of neat materials and blend films are shown in Fig. S1a and b.† In the neat film absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 3a, the neat J61 displays two absorption peaks at 546 nm and 601 nm, which correspond to an optical bandgap of 2.24 eV and demonstrate the typical wide-bandgap property of the J61 polymer. Both J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 exhibited similar light absorption intensity for the different absorption peaks, while the light absorption intensity of Y6 is significantly decreased. The neat PffBTT2-DPPT2 exhibited two absorption peaks at 724 nm and 795 nm, which correspond to an optical bandgap of 1.43 eV and belong to the narrow-bandgap property of the PffBTT2-DPPT2 polymer, showing a blue-shift of around 10 nm compared with that of neat Y6 (the absorption peak is located at 806 nm). The PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films show efficient light absorption in the long wavelength and NIR regions, whereas the J61:Y6 binary films show strong absorption peaks in the medium-long wavelength region and dramatically narrow absorption peaks in the long wavelength and NIR regions (as shown in Fig. 3b). The narrow absorption peaks in the long wavelength and NIR regions for J61:Y6 binary films compared with those of PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films are attributed to the negligible light absorption of neat J61 molecules in the long wavelength and NIR regions and only Y6 absorbs in this region. Thus, both the PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 and the J61:Y6 binary films show unbalanced light absorption in the visible light wavelength and NIR regions. However, when the blend acceptor with an appropriate ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 replaced the neat J61 or the neat PffBTT2-DPPT2, there was significantly enhanced absorption intensity in the medium wavelength region covering the whole visible light to NIR region compared with PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 and J61:Y6 binary films.

2.2. Exciton dissociation, charge transfer and recombination
To determine the exciton dissociation and energy transfer at the D1/D2 and D/A interfaces, we conducted photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. In the binary PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 and J61:Y6 films, exciton dissociation should occur at the PffBTT2-DPPT2/Y6 and J61/Y6 interface.26,42 However, the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 binary films must be investigated and analysed to determine whether they are qualified for exciton dissociation and energy transfer at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface. As shown in Fig. 4a, the J61 neat film exhibits a strong and broad PL emission and a PL peak at 652 nm when excited at 550 nm. The relatively weak PL emission of the neat PffBTT2-DPPT2 film is achieved with one emission peak at 808 nm (the excitation wavelength is 750 nm). It is apparent that the 652 nm PL peak is almost quenched (corresponding to neat J61) and the 808 nm PL emission intensity (corresponding to neat PffBTT2-DPPT2) is markedly increased, which should be attributed to the efficient energy transfer from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2.43 Interestingly, compared with neat J61, incorporating PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6 into neat J61 results in significant PL quenching. The J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films exhibited stronger PL quenching compared with J61:Y6 and J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 binary films. This observation clearly demonstrates a Förster resonance energy transfer from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2 due to the LUMO offset between J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 even though PffBTT2-DPPT2 isn't an electron acceptor. From Fig. 4b, the dependence of PL spectra of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 blend films on the ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 was measured to further investigate the dynamics process between J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2. The emission peaks are gradually blue-shifted in the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 blend films along with the PffBTT2-DPPT2 content increase. The PL peaks for J61 are quenched and the intensity of PffBTT2-DPPT2 peaks gradually enhanced along with the PffBTT2-DPPT2 content increase, suggesting the energy and charge transfer process from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2. From Fig. 4c, a significant spectral overlap is observed between the absorption spectrum of the neat PffBTT2-DPPT2 film and the PL spectrum of the neat J61 film, which further demonstrates energy transfer from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2.44,45

To further determine whether exciton dissociation occurs at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface, we probed the J–V characteristics of a sandwich device (without Y6) with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J61 or PffBTT2-DPPT2 or J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 (0.7:0.3)/Ca/Al under AM 1.5 G illumination. Upon irradiation of the ITO surface with light, exciton dissociation may occur at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface due to the LUMO offset between J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2.46,47 From Fig. 4d, after incorporating 30% PffBTT2-DPPT2 into J61, a higher JSC value was achieved (1.45 mA cm−2) compared with that of the neat J61 and neat PffBTT2-DPPT2 devices (0.93 and 0.60 mA cm−2, respectively), which further demonstrates that the photogenerated charge carriers can be dissociated into free charge carriers at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface to produce a higher photocurrent.48,49 To further clarify the exciton dissociation at the binary and ternary films, TRPL measurements were employed on the films with a pulsed laser at 550 nm, and the emission lifetime (η) was calculated. The TRPL curves are shown in Fig. 4e. The η values of the neat J61, J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 and J61:Y6 binary films and the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films were determined to be 4.31, 2.35, 1.75 and 1.36 ns, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4c, most of the PL spectrum of J61 was overlapped by the absorption spectrum of PffBTT2-DPPT2, which suggests the existence of energy transfer from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2, according to Förster energy transfer theory (FRET).50–52 The efficiency of energy transfer is calculated using:51,53  where τBlend and τD are the PL lifetimes of the blend donor (Blend) and pristine J61, respectively. The energy-transfer efficiency was estimated to be ∼45.5% from J61 to PffBTT2-DPPT2. This indicates fast and efficient charge transfer at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface, which is consistent with more efficient photovoltaic performance. The lifetime of the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films was the shortest relative to the other three films, suggesting that the fastest exciton dissociation occurred at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2, J61/Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2/Y6 interfaces, which also agrees with the photovoltaic performance and PL quenching measurements.
To elucidate the origin of the high FF, a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was employed to measure the charge carrier mobility and the balance of electron and hole transport. The SCLC characteristics of the electron- and hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively, and the calculated electron mobility (μe), hole mobility (μh) and ratio of electron to hole mobility (μe/μh) are summarized in Table 4. All of the binary and ternary blended films have a remarkably changed μe from 2.82 to 4.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a moderate μh in the range of 8.16 to 8.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 (0.7:0.3:1.3) SCLC ternary device has a similar μh (8.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) to the other four SCLC devices, but the μe of the optimized ternary SCLC device has the highest value (up to 4.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, the optimized ternary SCLC device shows a more balanced charge carrier mobility than the other four SCLC devices (the μe/μh is 0.524).

To investigate the recombination mechanisms of the binary and ternary systems under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions, the dependence of the J–V curve on the light intensity was employed (as shown in Fig. S2a–c†), and the VOC and JSC values were extracted from the J–V curve as a function of the light intensity for the J61:Y6- and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary PSCs and the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based ternary PSCs (as shown in Fig. 6a and b). Assuming that all the photogenerated charge carriers can be recombined under open-circuit conditions, the charge-carrier recombination mechanism (a single bimolecular recombination or a combination of trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination) is expressed using54–56  where k is the Boltzmann constant and n is the slope of the plot of VOCversus the light intensity (I). The interfacial defects and/or impurities within the photoactive layer and the incompatibility between each component may have formed the electron and hole recombination centres, which is defined as trap-assisted recombination.57 The slope of the plot of VOCversus the light intensity (I) is used to investigate the trap-assisted recombination intensity within the photoactive layer. The value of n should be 1 when bimolecular recombination is the single form within the photoactive layer and there is some trap-assisted recombination if n is greater than 1. Under short-circuit conditions, a maximum number of photogenerated charge carriers could be collected at the individual electrode, where bimolecular recombination is the exclusive recombination form, and the bimolecular recombination intensity is expressed using58,59JSC ∝ Iαwhere α is an exponential factor. The value of α should be 1 when bimolecular recombination does not occur within the photoactive layer, and there is some bimolecular recombination if α is smaller than 1. The optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs exhibited n and α values (1.05 and 0.982, respectively) closest to 1 compared with the J61:Y6 (1.09 and 0.971, respectively) and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 (1.25 and 0.954, respectively) binary PSCs. This result indicates that trap-assisted recombination is effectively suppressed under open-circuit conditions and bimolecular recombination is almost neglected under short-circuit conditions within the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary photoactive layer, which supports the high FF and JSC values.60,61 However, the n and α values of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs significantly deviated from 1 and strongly deviated from 1, respectively, indicating that strong trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination occur within the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary photoactive layer.59,62

The high FF value of PSCs exhibits an efficient charge carrier transport and collection and suppression of the charge recombination. From Fig. 6c, the optimized ternary PSCs exhibited the highest FF value under all the light intensities (from 100 mW cm−2 to 5 mW cm−2) relative to J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary OSCs, which indicates the suppressed charge recombination and more efficient charge collection between the ITO cathode and Ag anode.63,64 Stimulatingly, the optimized ternary PSCs exhibited a significantly enhanced FF value with a decrease of light intensity compared with J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6-based binary OSCs, which indicates the weak effect of charge carrier loss and charge carrier recombination within the photoactive layer at the maximum power point.
Simultaneously, after incorporating third component materials into the binary photoactive layer, charge recombination centres may form due to the energy level differences. To avoid or reduce charge recombination centres at the component materials interface, it is important to decrease the HOMO energy level difference between the two donors.65,66 The HOMO levels of J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 are similar (−5.32 and −5.33 eV, respectively), which is beneficial for more efficient hole transport and collection and effective suppression of hole recombination at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface.67,68 To confirm our hypothesis, we fabricated a hole-only device with the traditional sandwich configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 (0.7:0.3, without Y6)/MoO3/Ag, with ITO and Ag films as the anode and PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 as the hole extraction layer. From Fig. 6d, the hole-only device exhibited a nearly symmetric current shape for 8 V of positive applied voltage and −8 V of negative applied voltage, which is attributed to the similar HOMO energy levels of the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface and similar energy barriers and hole transport abilities of both PEDOT:PSS and MoO3.69,70 Thus, the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary photoactive layer is beneficial to the suppression of hole recombination.
To gain more insight into photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge collection in the binary and ternary photoactive layers, the plots of photocurrent density versus the effective voltage (Jph–Veff) of all the PSCs are shown in Fig. 7, and the saturation current density (Jsat, the applied voltage is 2.5 V), maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), photocurrent density (Jph) and Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions were calculated according to the following formulas and are summarized in Table 5:71,72Jph = JL − JD,Veff = V0 − Va,Jsat = qLGmax,where JL and JD are the current densities under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator and under dark conditions, respectively, and Va and V0 are the changing applied voltage and the applied voltage at Jph = 0, respectively. For the high applied voltage conditions (the Veff is 2.5 V), the largest amount of excitons are dissociated into the free charge state and then extracted from the photoactive layer to achieve the Jsat value, which is dominated by the number of harvested photons of the photoactive layers.73–75 The optimized ternary PSCs have the highest Jsat value (26.53 mA cm−2), which is higher than the 25.44 mA cm−2 of the J61:Y6 binary PSCs and the 23.74 mA cm−2 of the binary PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 PSCs, demonstrating the more efficient photon harvesting of the optimized ternary photoactive layers. Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions and maximum power output conditions gives the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll).76,77 The optimized ternary PSCs have the highest ηdiss and ηcoll values (97.2% and 82.5%, respectively), indicating a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency relative to J61:Y6 binary PSCs (96.7% and 81.9%, respectively) and binary PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 PSCs (95.3% and 80.4%, respectively), which is consistent with the highest FF and JSC values for the optimized ternary PSCs.78–80

2.3. Film morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and the crystallinity of the binary and ternary films, respectively (as shown in Fig. S3†). The surface morphology of the three fresh blend films (J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films and optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films) had similar RMS roughness values of 2.40 ± 0.25 nm (the RMS roughness values were 2.18 nm, 2.65 nm and 2.35 nm, respectively), indicating a minimal effect on the interfacial contact and a high compatibility between each component.81
The AFM investigation was limited to the surface morphology of the binary and ternary blend films. To obtain a better understanding of whether PffBTT2-DPPT2 is contained in the molecular packing and crystalline structures of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 films and optimized ternary J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 films, XRD measurements were employed, and the XRD curves are shown in Fig. S4.† The J61:Y6 binary film reflections of J61 are at 0.4 Å−1 and 1.64 Å−1, respectively. Thus, the alkyl-to-alkyl distance in J61 is 2.3 nm and the π–π stacking distance is 0.45 nm. When PffBTT2-DPPT2 is added to the J61:Y6 binary films, it readily crystallizes and forms its own domain. The optimized ternary film reflections of the blend of J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 are at 0.43 Å−1 and 1.75 Å−1, and a new peak at 1.35 Å−1 was found. The π–π stacking distance is 0.43 nm. Thus the high crystallites of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 blend films and two peaks for Y6, which is beneficial for hole and electron transport.24,82 The improved molecular arrangement of the blend donor and the decrease of the molecular distance between the two donors in the optimized ternary films could reduce structural defects and enhance charge transport, consistent with the high electron mobility and photovoltaic parameters (mainly including the FF and JSC values) of the optimized ternary PSCs.
2.4. Thermal stability
The ternary PSCs have the advantages of a high photovoltaic performance and good thermal stability. The above measurements and characterization of the binary and ternary PSCs indicate that J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs are favourable for a high photovoltaic performance. We investigated the thermal stability of the binary and optimized ternary PSCs. The photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of the binary and optimized ternary PSCs under a thermal annealing treatment in a glove box were measured (the thermal annealing temperature was 80 °C and the time was 20 hours). The dependence of the photovoltaic parameters on the thermal annealing time is shown in Fig. S5,† and all the normalized parameters are shown in Fig. 8. After thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for 20 hours of the three PSCs, different change trends were observed for the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs and the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs. The normalized PCE values of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs were only 72% and 70% of the initial PCE values after the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for 20 hours, respectively, and the PCE values of the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs were approximately 79% of the initial PCE values under the same thermal stress conditions. All the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs are higher than those of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs for the entire thermal annealing treatment time.83

Fig. S6† shows the AFM images of the J61:Y6 binary films, optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films and binary PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 films under the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for 20 hours. The RMS roughness values of the fresh J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films and the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films are 2.18 nm, 2.65 nm and 2.35 nm, respectively. After the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for 20 hours, the RMS roughness values of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary films are significantly enhanced to 6.8 nm and 7.4 nm, respectively, while the RMS value of the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films is slightly enhanced to 3.2 nm. The high RMS roughness value does not favour interfacial contact between the binary photoactive layer and the modified electrode layer and leads to a number of charge recombination centres.42,63 The smooth surface of the optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films favours efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier extraction and collection even under long time thermal annealing treatment.84
We have investigated the miscibility of PffBTT2-DPPT2 with the J61 films to have a full understanding of domain compositions in the blend films. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†) were employed to infer the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) of the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 (details on the calculation of χ are shown in the ESI†). Both PffBTT2-DPPT2 and J61 have a similar molar mass (the molar mass values of PffBTT2-DPPT2 and J61 are 1320 and 1289), and we use m1 = 1 and m2 = 1 here. The absolute temperatures of neat J61 (T0m2) and blend J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 (Tm2) are 227 °C and 220 °C, and the enthalpy of fusion of J61 (ΔH2) is ∼23.0 J g−1. The χ value is 2.3 for J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 blend films, which indicates that PffBTT2-DPPT2 might be miscible with J61 and leads to the suppression of the crystallization of J61 under higher thermal annealing treatment.85 The DSC curve of the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2 blend films revealed that the thermal behaviour of the ternary films was easily influenced by adding PffBTT2-DPPT2 to the J61 films to form stable crystallites in the blended ternary films even under the high-temperature thermal annealing treatment, which is consistent with the better thermal stability measurement of the optimized ternary PSCs and the AFM images of the optimized ternary films.
3. Conclusion
In summary, binary PSCs with J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 films as the photoactive layer and ternary PSCs with J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 as the photoactive layer were fabricated with dependence on the ratio of J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2. Compared with the two binary PSCs, the J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 (0.7:0.3:1.3)-based ternary PSCs had the highest PCE values even under long time thermal annealing treatment, which is attributed to the complementary light absorption advantages of J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2, efficient exciton dissociation and smooth hole transport at the J61/PffBTT2-DPPT2 interface and stable crystallization for optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary films. The PCE of the optimized ternary PSCs is 14.88%, which is an increase of 10.9% and 15.1% compared to that of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs, respectively (the PCEs of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs are 12.51% and 11.99%, respectively). The normalized PCE value of optimized J61:PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 ternary PSCs is almost 80% of the initial PCE value after the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for 20 hours, and is significantly higher than that of the J61:Y6 and PffBTT2-DPPT2:Y6 binary PSCs. The PCE improvement is attributed to the following factors: (i) complementary absorption spectra of the three kinds of materials and a balance of photon harvesting from the visible light to near infrared range; (ii) cascading LUMO energy level alignment between J61, PffBTT2-DPPT2 and Y6 to provide effective exciton dissociation and electron transport channels; (iii) similar HOMO energy levels for both J61 and PffBTT2-DPPT2 to provide efficient hole transport channels and hole recombination suppression; and (iv) weak crystallinity peak and high crystallization temperatures for a high photovoltaic performance despite long thermal annealing treatment times. This work indicates that it is a smart strategy to fabricate highly efficient and stable ternary PSCs.
