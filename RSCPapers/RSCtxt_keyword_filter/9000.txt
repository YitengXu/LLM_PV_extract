    , Accepted 9th June 2011First published on 3rd August 2011AbstractA novel photovoltaic–thermoelectric (PV–TE) hybrid device composed of a series-connected dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a solar selective absorber (SSA) and a TE generator is created. The conversion efficiency of the DSSC was enhanced significantly by using the SSA and TE generator to utilize residual sunlight transmitted through the DSSC. The hybrid device comprising a DSSC as a “top cell” for high-energy photons and an SSA coated TE generator as a “bottom cell” for low-energy photons gave rise to an overall conversion efficiency larger than 13%. Although our hybrid device was not yet optimized but served as proof-of-principle for harvesting electricity from solar light and heat simultaneously with high conversion efficiency by a single device, this study would give some enlightenment for the development of high-performance PV–TE hybrid devices.

Broader context
Solar energy harvesting includes photoelectric and photo-thermal methods. Combining the two ways in one cell, in a hybrid device, is a promising approach to fully utilizing solar energy. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), with the advantage of low production cost, has experienced 20 years of development and is still under intensive research due to its great potential in real applications. Bi2Te3 thermoelectric (TE) generators have excellent performance at the low temperature range, RT to 100 °C. The article focuses on utilizing the transmitted sunlight through the DSSC by the TE generator and increasing the overall solar energy conversion efficiency. Based on this idea, we present a novel photovoltaic–thermoelectric hybrid device composed of a DSSC, solar selective absorber (SSA), and a thermoelectric generator (TE), which achieved an overall cell efficiency of 13.8%. The high solar energy conversion efficiency is because the DSSC/SSA/TE hybrid structure fully utilizes the sunlight. Although our hybrid device is not yet optimized, it serves as a proof-of-principle for harvesting electricity from solar light and heat simultaneously with high conversion efficiency by a single device. This study would give some enlightenment for the development of high-performance photovoltaic hybrid devices or other energy conversion hybrid devices.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention since they were first reported in 1991.1–9 DSSCs are promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices due to their low production cost and high efficiency for energy conversion. Generally, DSSCs consist of three main components: a dye-adsorbed porous nanocrystalline TiO2 film on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-coated glass substrate, an iodide/triiodide redox couple electrolyte, and a platinized TCO-coated glass substrate as a counter electrode. The main role of the dye is to absorb sunlight and to generate excited electrons. However, typical dyes only absorb part of visible and infrared light.10 Hence, lots of sunlight is wasted, which is the main reason for the low conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
One method to improve the conversion efficiency is to combine two different types of DSSC into a hybrid cell. Dürr et al. prepared a hybrid DSSC with two different sensitizer dyes (N3 dye and Black dye) and realized a 10.5% conversion efficiency.11 Murayama et al. prepared a similar hybrid cell with a Pt-mesh sheet cathode and achieved a conversion efficiency above 4.7%.12 Yanagida et al. prepared DSSC (N719 dye)/DSSC (Black dye) hybrid cells with a 10.6% conversion efficiency,13 and Nattestad et al. recently proposed a novel p-DSSC/n-DSSC hybrid cell, which realized a 2.42% conversion efficiency.14
Herein, we present a novel method to improve the energy conversion efficiency. Namely it is to combine a transparent DSSC, a solar selective absorber (SSA) and a thermoelectric (TE) generator into a hybrid device. TE generator is a well-known solid-state device which can convert heat directly into electricity by the Seebeck effect. Great efforts are being made to apply TE generators to harvest electricity from renewable energy, such as solar heat,15 as well as waste heat discharged from various systems, such as industrial furnaces, incinerators, vehicles, etc.16
As for solar thermoelectric generation (TEG), Weidenkaff's group has been developing a TEG system for direct TE conversion driven by concentrated solar radiation into electricity based on high-temperature TE oxide materials.17 Zhang's group has also designed a concentration solar TEG system and reported the possible conversion efficiency of 10–14% depending on the materials and solar concentration ratio.18 Guo and Chang designed solar TEG systems with the output power of DSSC increased by 11.2% and 2.87%, respectively.19,20 Amatya proposed that a TEG with high-performance modules can be a cost-effective alternative to solar photovoltaics for micropower generation.21 Van Sark presented a careful simulation work on the performance of the Si-solar-cell/TE hybrid device and demonstrated its usefulness for energy harvesting in the world sun-belt area if the TE materials with ZT, a dimensionless figure of merit, higher than 2 or even 3 at 300–500 K become available.22
Solar hybrid generation system has been proposed in the Japan–China collaboration research project.23 This hybrid system consists of a Si solar cell and a TE generator separately placed. Sunlight collected by a lens is separated into two beams, and UV-visible light is absorbed by a solar cell and infrared light is absorbed by a TE generator to harvest electricity. Such pioneering work recently done has inspired us to develop a hybrid device composed of a series connection of a transparent DSSC, a SSA, and a TE generator to fully use the solar energy to harvest electricity with high conversion efficiency.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic illustration and photograph of the novel PV–TE hybrid device. A DSSC and a TE generator are the top cell and “bottom cell”, respectively, while a SSA is placed in between the DSSC and TE generator. The electric connection of the DSSC and TE generator are in series, the cathode and anode of the hybrid device are the cathode of the DSSC and the anode of the TE generator respectively. According to the transmittance spectrum of the glass sheet coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and the DSSC cell shown in Fig. 2(a), the DSSC absorbs part of the sunlight, which is converted into electricity. A relatively high transmittance from a wavelength of 600 nm to 1600 nm can be observed from the spectrum, which suggests that this part of the illumination energy is not utilized by the DSSC cell. On the other hand, it is shown in Fig. 2(b) that the SSA has a markedly low reflectance in the wavelength range from 600nm to 1600nm. This means the transmitted sunlight through a DSSC can be well absorbed by the SSA. Then the SSA converts the residual sunlight transmitted through a DSSC into heat energy. This heat is further converted into electricity by the TE generator using the Seebeck effect.24 The hybrid device as a whole can absorb a wide wavelength range of incident sunlight, and hence, should lead to a higher energy conversion efficiency.

A series of measurements with hybrid device samples have supported the concept with evidence. The results from Table 1 and Table 2 show a positive influence of the hybrid device to the overall energy conversion efficiency. To understand the output contributions of the TE and DSSC parts in the hybrid device and to make comparisons, one component was short-circuited (s/c) in a particular measurement, i.e. the results for DSSCs/c/TE were measured with the DSSC part short-circuited. We also set up a system for each voltammetry measurement (see Fig. 3). To maintain the cold side temperature at a stable level, an iron heat sink and a glass container with the mixture of ice and water was used on the back side of the hybrid device during each measurement. Each voltammetry measurement was carried out under standard illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at ambient temperature. Although the same conditions were set, different structures resulted in different temperature distributions (see Table 3).

In Table 3, T1 is the temperature of the hybrid device's surface against the illumination. T2 and T3 is the temperature of the hot side and cold side of TE part, respectively. Theat sink is the surface temperature of the iron heat sink. The ΔTover TE is the temperature drop over the TE generator, it varies with or without the existence of an SSA. Tambient is the temperature of the environment near the system.
The photocurrent density–voltage characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 4. Some results for photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), maximum output power density (Pmax), fill factor (FF), and corresponding photoenergy conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The FF and η of the DSSC and the hybrid devices were calculated using the following equations: (1) (2) where Pin is the incident light power, and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output in the J–V curves, respectively. Note that the η of DSSCs/c/TE and DSSCs/c/SSA/TE is not listed in Table 1 and Table 2, because the real heat flow going through the TE module is hard to measure. Indeed, we emphasised the contribution of the TE module to the efficiency of the hybrid device.
 Fig. 4  Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the DSSC/TE hybrid devices and the devices with either part short-circuited (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). 
As for the DSSC/TE hybrid device, its Voc is equal to the sum of the Voc values of the DSSC/TEs/c and DSSCs/c/TE due to the series-connection. The overall Jsc of the DSSC/TE hybrid device depends on the lower current density, Jsc of DSSC/TEs/c, which is also due to the series-connection, but is slightly higher than that of DSSC/TEs/c. The top substrate of the TE generator is a silicon wafer, and thus, the transmitted sunlight can be reflected effectively by the silicon wafer as a back reflector. The back reflector can enhance the light harvesting efficiency of DSSC, and hence, contribute to the enhancement of Jsc, from 19.2 mA cm−2 to 19.8 mA cm−2 as shown in Table 1. Table 1 indicates that the conversion efficiency of 12.8% for the DSSC/TE hybrid device is much higher than the efficiency of a DSSC, and the enhanced efficiency of a DSSC/TE hybrid device results from the contribution of the open-circuit voltage by the TE module. These results firmly suggest that the combination of the DSSC and TE generator can realize full utilization of the solar spectrum, which should significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of a DSSC.
Employing SSA further increases the overall efficiency of the PV–TE hybrid device to 13.8%. Reflectance spectrum of the commercial SSA, shown in Fig. 2(b), shows that the absorbance and thermal emittance of the SSA are about 95% and 5%, respectively. The temperature drop over the TE generator can be further elevated from 4.9 K to 6.2 K (see Table 3) by inserting a SSA into the gap between the DSSC and the TE generator. Table 2 showed that the Voc of the TE module is increased obviously by SSA, due to the increased temperature drop, which results in the increase of Voc of the DSSC/SSA/TE hybrid device, and further enhances the overall efficiency of the hybrid device. Our work strongly suggests that the SSA is an effective means to increase the photoenergy conversion efficiency of a hybrid device.
In summary, a highly efficient photoelectric conversion is anticipated for a novel PV–TE hybrid system composed of a DSSC, SSA, and TE generator. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid system can effectively increase the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a DSSC and is a promising configuration for realizing very high conversion efficiencies. Meanwhile, there is still large room for further improvement in photoenergy conversion efficiency of this hybrid system by further optimization.
Experimental
The following procedure was used to prepare the hybrid device. First, a DSSC is constructed from a dye-coated TiO2 film (about 6.5 μm thick) electrode, transparent Pt counter electrode, polyethylene spacer (about 50 μm thick), and iodide-based liquid electrolyte.25 Then a dye-coated TiO2 film electrode is prepared by immersing the TiO2 film in a 3 × 10−4 M ethanol solution of N719 dye (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] (Bu4N = tetrabutylammonium and dcbpy = dicarboxylbipyridine) (Solaronix Co., Ltd., Switzerland) for 15 h. The electrolyte composition is 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The active area of the DSSC is about 6.25 mm2. Then a commercial solar selective absorber substrate (BLUE CORETM Al-Absorber, Dezhou Jinheng New Energy Co., Ltd., China) is pasted onto the counter-electrode side of the DSSC. Next, the DSSC with SSA is connected by a thermal silicone paste to a commercial TE generator (MPG-D602 from Micropelt Co. ltd., Germany). The MPG-D602 TE generator has an active area of about 6.25 mm2 with 450 pairs of p–n junctions. The Net Seebeck Voltage at 23 °C is 100 mV K¬1.
Simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G) was irradiated using a solar simulator with a Xe lamp (calibrated with a standard Si-based solar cell), and the current–voltage (I–V) curve was recorded by a CHI-660 electrochemical work station (CH Instrument Corp., USA). The photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and corresponding photoenergy conversion efficiency (η) were calculated from the obtained I–V curves. The temperature measurements were recorded by a 607-CF Probe Thermometer (APRESYS inc. USA).
