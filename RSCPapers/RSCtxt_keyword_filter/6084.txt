    , Accepted 19th September 2017First published on 19th September 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have greatly improved through optimizing the morphology and charge extraction of the perovskite film. To increase the efficiency, we have developed a new method of adding NiO nanotubes (NTs) to the perovskite precursor solution. The NiO NTs promoted the growth of perovskite grains during annealing and facilitated charge extraction. The increase in the grain size improved the crystallinity of the perovskite film and reduced the grain boundaries that could trap charge. Additionally, the NiO NTs located between the grain boundaries transferred holes, which prevented charge recombination. The efficiency of the PSCs increased due to the improved crystallinity and charge extraction of the perovskite film. Devices incorporating the NiO NTs exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 19.3 and 12.82% for planar-type and carbon-based PSCs, respectively.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are of great interest due to the unique properties of perovskites, which include high absorption coefficients, excellent charge carrier mobilities, long diffusion lengths, low charge recombination rates, and bandgap tunability.1–7 PSCs consist of an electron transport layer, a perovskite layer, and a hole transport layer as main components. These devices are divided into planar and mesoporous types depending on the presence or absence of a mesoporous layer in the electron transport layer. Various studies have reported ways to improve the efficiency of both types of PSCs, e.g., by the formation of perovskite films free of pinholes or other defects.8–15 Other approaches have focused on replacing or eliminating costly materials to aid commercialization of highly efficient PSCs. For example, carbon-based PSCs are being considered as a way to eliminate costly hole transport materials and to replace gold electrodes with carbon electrodes.16–19
The control of the morphology and the grain size in perovskite layers is central to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE, η).20–23 A homogeneous and highly crystalline perovskite layer with a large grain size provides enhanced light harvesting. On the other hand, poor crystallinity leads to current loss, resulting in poor device performance. Furthermore, a large perovskite grain size reduces grain boundaries, which are charge trap sites that obstruct charge transfer. The grain boundaries and defects in perovskite films enable charge recombination. The hysteresis problem is also related to the crystallinity and interfaces of a perovskite.24,25 Thus, a perovskite film with high crystallinity and a large grain size is required to achieve high device performance.24,26 Many researchers have attempted to increase the efficiency by controlling the morphology and crystallinity via changes in the annealing conditions, solvent choice, moisture content, and composition and use of additives. Forming perovskite films by spin coating, dip coating, and doctor blading has also been investigated.27–29 Incorporation of additives in a perovskite layer is a simple and efficient way to enhance the quality of a perovskite film. Additives such as N-doped graphene, sulfonate-carbon nanotubes (NTs), potassium chloride, hydriodic acid, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) have been used to enhance the crystallinity and morphology, leading to high-performance PSCs.10,13–15,30–32
In this study, we successfully introduced NiO NTs as an additive to improve the quality of the perovskite film and investigated the influence of NiO NTs on device performance. The NiO NTs having a uniform diameter were synthesized by electrospinning. They were incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to increase the perovskite grain size and enhance the crystallinity, thereby improving the PCE. The NiO NTs were also located within the grain boundaries, which facilitated charge extraction. Furthermore, when the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite layer was applied to carbon-based PSCs, the NiO NTs bridged the perovskite film and the carbon electrode, resulting in an increase in efficiency. Planar-type and carbon-based PSCs containing the NiO NTs achieved high PCEs of 19.3 and 12.81%, respectively, which were higher than the PCEs of 17.5 and 10.42% for pristine planar-type and carbon-based PSCs, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PSCs containing NiO NTs having perovskite films of improved morphology and crystallinity.
Results and discussion
The PSCs in this work had a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO2/NiO nanotube-perovskite (NiO NT-MAPbI3)/spiro-OMeTAD/gold structure (Fig. 1a). Unlike typical planar-type PSCs, the NiO NTs were added to the perovskite precursor solution to investigate the changes in the perovskite film. The NiO NTs were fabricated via electrospinning and calcination. The NiO precursor solution containing PVP and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was electrospun onto the collector at a constant voltage, and then calcined at 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 1 h. The prepared NiO NTs had a diameter of about 50–60 nm and a length of 1 to 3 μm confirmed by FE-SEM and TEM images (Fig. S1†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the NiO NTs indicated the formation of a pure phase (Fig. S2a†). The perovskite precursor solution was composed of PbI2 and CH3NH3I dissolved in the dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent to which the NiO NTs were added. Fig. 1b shows the energy bandgap diagram of the PSCs with NiO NTs and includes a possible mechanism for charge transport. The NiO NTs had a wide bandgap of 3.6 eV with a valence band (VB) of −5.3 eV, which is between that of perovskite (−5.4 eV) and the work function of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.2 eV).9,33,34 Thus, the NiO NTs could act as hole transfer agents in the perovskite layer. Fig. 1c shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the NiO NT-incorporated PSCs. The thicknesses of the compact, NiO NT-perovskite and hole transport layers was about 50, 600, and 200 nm, respectively, when stacked by the spin-coating method. The gold electrode was produced by thermal evaporation to form a 60 nm-thick film. The yellow dotted line in Fig. 1c indicates the NiO NTs, which were distributed across the perovskite layer and not embedded in it. The cross-sectional SEM-EPMA elemental mapping displays the NiO NTs in the perovskite film (Fig. S3†). The improved perovskite film using the NiO NTs likely enhanced charge extraction.

The photovoltaic properties of the perovskite films were studied. Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of these films that were formed in the absence (a and c) and presence (b and d) of NiO NTs in the precursor solution. The concentration of NiO NTs was 0.75 mg mL−1 in NiO NT/precursor solution. Both types of perovskite films were uniform and composed of crystalline perovskite grains. The NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film contained larger perovskite crystal grains than the pristine film. The average crystal grain diameters were ca. 700 and 1100 nm in the control perovskite film and NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film, respectively. Fig. S4† shows the SEM images of PSCs prepared with 0.75 to 1.5 mg mL−1 of NiO NT/precursor solution. The perovskite grain size decreased once the optimal amount of NiO NTs was exceeded. The NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film showed an enhanced grain size as well as NiO NTs between the grains. These NiO NTs acted as electrically active additives that recrystallized the grains and passivated the grain boundaries and interfaces, permitting effective charge generation and separation in the perovskite layer.10,35 In addition, the NiO NTs served as a framework for perovskite crystal formation. The NiO NTs in the precursor solution likely controlled the crystal grain size development during annealing. The main role of NiO NTs was to improve the quality of perovskites by enhancing the grain size. Charge extraction in the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite layer was enhanced by the micron-size of the grains and the presence of NiO NTs between the grain boundaries. The existence of NiO NTs between the perovskite grains can be confirmed through the SEM-EPMA elemental mapping images of the NiO-perovskite film (Fig. S5†). The generated charge could transfer to the grain boundary via the NiO NTs and be collected by the hole transport layer and the electrode.

The PSCs were fabricated using a NiO NT-perovskite layer prepared from 0.5 to 1.25 mg mL−1 of NiO NT/precursor solution to investigate the effect of the amount of NiO NTs on the performance of the devices. Fig. S6† shows the current density–voltage curves (J–V curves) of these NiO NT-incorporated PSCs. The highest PCE was exhibited for the 0.75 mg mL−1 NiO NT concentration. Once this optimal concentration of NiO NTs was exceeded, the grain size decreased. Therefore, the NiO NTs incorporated at higher than 0.75 mg mL−1 decreased the PCE of the PSC. The J–V curves of the reference and NiO NT-incorporated PSCs displayed hysteresis (Fig. 3a and b). The PSCs containing the NiO NTs exhibited an enhanced photocurrent density (Jsc) of 22.4 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency (η) of 19.1%. These photovoltaic parameters were higher than those of the reference cell (Jsc = 21.6 mA cm−2 and η = 17.5%). Furthermore, the hysteresis of the device based on the NiO NTs was improved by the enhanced crystallinity and charge extraction, as shown in the forward and reverse scans. With forward scanning, the NiO NT-incorporated PSCs had Jsc = 22.4 mA cm−2 and η = 18.0%. The control cell displayed more hysteresis during forward scanning (Jsc = 21.6 mA cm−2 and η = 15.7%). The superior quality of the perovskite film could cause the reduction of hysteresis. The larger perovskite grains reduced the total number of grain boundaries, leading to more efficient charge transfer. Encountering fewer boundaries also enhanced the fill factor (FF).22,36 The increased Jsc was also in agreement with the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 3c). The calculated photocurrent densities from the IPCE spectra were 21.2 and 22.0 mA cm−2 for the reference and NiO NT-based PSCs, respectively. The enhancement of light-harvesting properties was attributed to the large perovskite grains and the hole transport ability of the NiO NTs. The steady-state photocurrent at a forward bias of 0.92 V demonstrated the stable power output of the NiO NT-based PSC (Fig. 3d). The steady-state photocurrent stabilized in seconds to ca. 20.2 mA cm−2, leading to a stabilized η of 18.6%. These values coincided with the J–V curve shown in Fig. 3b. Therefore, the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite layer could effectively facilitate charge transfer and passivate charge trap sites, thereby reducing charge recombination and accumulation.

The photovoltaic parameters were measured for 15 devices to investigate the reliability of the NiO NT-incorporated PSCs (Fig. 4). The average values of the parameters were similar to those of Fig. 3a and b, i.e., η = 19.02%, Jsc = 22.5 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 1.11 V and FF = 0.75. Correspondingly, the control device had η = 17.48%, Jsc = 21.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V and FF = 0.73. These data indicate that the control and NiO NT-based PSCs were reliable. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curve of the best-performing planar-type PSC with NiO NTs present in the perovskite layer. The photovoltaic parameters of this device were Jsc = 22.4 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.12 V, FF = 0.752 and η = 19.3%. The long term stability was characterized under ambient conditions (in air, 20% humidity) and the cell was measured every 12 hours. Fig. S7† shows the long-term stability of PSCs with and without NiO NTs in the perovskite layer. The improved quality of the perovskite film via NiO NTs could enhance the stability of PSCs. After 250 hours, the PCE was maintained at 85%, which indicated the long-term stability of PSCs.

The perovskite films were characterized using various analytical tools (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a displays the XRD patterns of the control and NiO NT-incorporated films. The main diffraction peaks at 14.9 and 29.3° were assigned to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the tetragonal lattice of CH3NH3PbI3. The main peaks of perovskite films were too large to distinguish the other peaks. To observe the NiO NT peaks, we extended the XRD patterns from 30 to 50° (Fig. S2b†). From the results, the peak of 32.5° was found in both perovskite films, assigned to the (312) crystal plane of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 phase. It was still difficult to distinguish the peaks of NiO NTs in the NiO-perovskite film due to the small amount of NiO NTs. The NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film had more intense diffraction peaks, which indicated higher crystallinity. The enhanced grain size improved the degree of crystallinity. When the concentration of NiO NTs exceeded 0.75 mg mL−1, the crystal size decreased and the intensity of the XRD peaks decreased (Fig. S2c†). We further investigated the size of the perovskite crystal using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) at a 2θ of 14.9°. We calculated the average crystallite size using the Scherrer equation.D = Kλ/βcosθ(D: crystallite size, K: Scherrer constant, λ: wavelength of the X-rays, β: FWHM of the diffraction peak, and θ: diffraction angle).

(d) Electrical impedance spectra (EIS) of pristine perovskites and NiO NT-incorporated PSCs under illumination at a bias of 0.8 V. 
The calculated crystallite sizes of the control and NiO NT-incorporated perovskites were 1022 and 678 nm, which were similar to the grain size obtained from the SEM images. The ultraviolet-visible spectra of the control and NiO NT-incorporated films revealed differences in their optical properties (Fig. 6b). The NiO NT-incorporated film absorbed light more strongly than the control. The introduction of NiO NTs in the perovskite solution enhanced the perovskite grain size, thereby improving the light-harvesting capacity of the film. Fig. 6c shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decays of the perovskite films: glass/pristine and NiO NT-perovskite/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Compared with the control, the PL decays were slower for the perovskite films containing NiO NTs due to its increased perovskite grain size. The superior quality of the perovskite film increased the charge life time. The charge generated in the perovskite may be partially quenched by NiO NTs, but the PL decay is longer due to the increase of the charge life time due to the qualitative improvement of the perovskite film. In order to investigate the improvement of charge extraction by NiO NTs, we further measured the time-resolved PL decays for the glass/perovskite layer/hole transport layer. Fig. S8† exhibits the time-resolved PL decays for the perovskite film with the hole transport layer (spiro-OMeTAD). The generated charge from the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite films was quenched by the hole transport layer more quickly than the control film. From these data, it could be deduced that the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite layer had improved charge extraction. This result demonstrated that the addition of NiO NTs in the perovskite film reduced the number of charge trap sites and assisted efficient charge transfer. Electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were measured to further investigate the kinetic characterization of charge transfer. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of the control and NiO NT-incorporated PSCs under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination and at a bias of 0.8 V. The NiO NT-incorporated PSCs had lower resistance than the control. This indicated that the NiO NTs in the perovskite films reduced the number of trap sites and resistive loss. The grain boundaries were reduced by the incorporation of the NiO NTs, which resulted in reduced recombination. This improved charge extraction and recombination reduction led to better device performance.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) identified the binding energies of the perovskite core level peaks for the control and NiO NT-incorporated perovskite films. All samples were prepared by perovskite coating on FTO substrates. The core level peaks of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, lead, iodine, and nickel are shown in Fig. 7. The C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Pb 4f, and I 3d binding energies were similar for the control and NiO NT-based perovskite films (Fig. 7a–e). The small amount of NiO NTs did not affect the binding energies of the perovskite film.10,37Fig. 7f highlights the Ni 2p binding energy peak. The peak at 874.7 eV for the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film was attributed to NiO NTs on the surface of the perovskite film. From the XPS data, the NiO NTs were present between the perovskite grains without interfering with perovskite formation.

We used the NiO NT-incorporated perovskite film to construct carbon-based PSCs. Carbon-based PSCs are particularly attractive due to their low cost; they can replace expensive materials such as hole transfer materials and gold electrodes.16–19 Additionally, the absence of a thermal deposition process means that the process cost is lower, and the carbon electrode provides moisture stability. In our case, we removed the hole transport material (spiro-OMeTAD) and replaced the gold electrode with a carbon electrode. Fig. 8a illustrates the carbon-based PSCs with incorporated NiO NTs having the structure FTO/compact TiO2 layer/mesoporous TiO2 layer/NiO NT-perovskite layer/carbon electrode. The carbon electrode was fabricated using a printing method and not by thermal evaporation, leading to cost savings. Fig. S9† shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the carbon-based PSCs containing the NiO NTs. The thicknesses of the compact TiO2 layer, mesoporous TiO2 layer, and NiO NT-perovskite layer were ca. 50, 250, and 300 nm, respectively; these were fabricated by spin-coating. The 50 μm-thick carbon electrode was formed using commercial carbon paste by a print-screening method. The energy bandgap diagram corresponding to the carbon-based PSCs containing NiO NTs, including the charge transport mechanism, is shown in Fig. 8b. The charge transport mechanism of carbon-based PSCs is similar to that of planar-type PSCs. The generated hole in the perovskite moved to NiO NTs or the carbon electrode directly due to the absence of spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 8c shows the J–V curve of the carbon-based PSCs with and without the NiO NTs. Those containing the NiO NTs displayed an enhanced Jsc = 18.71 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.01 V and η = 12.81% (Fig. 8c inset). These values were higher than those of the control (Jsc = 17.54 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and η = 10.42%). The NiO NTs acted as hole transport materials and enhanced the perovskite grain size in the carbon-based PSCs, thereby improving the efficiency via facile charge transfer.

Conclusions
In summary, NiO NTs were incorporated into perovskite films and their effect in PSCs was examined. The NiO NTs increased the perovskite grain size and enhanced the light-harvesting and charge generation properties of the perovskite film. Moreover, the NiO NTs present in the grain boundaries behaved as a p-type semiconductor, which enabled hole transfer. The NiO NTs enhanced the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film and charge extraction, which resulted in improved device performance. Planar-type and carbon-based PSCs with NiO NTs exhibited a significant PCE enhancement from 17.5 and 10.42% to 19.3 and 12.81%, respectively. Our approach of incorporating NiO NTs in perovskite films is a new method that can improve the performance of PSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of NiO nanotubes (NTs)
A poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw 1300000) and poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN, Mw 150000) mixed solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of PVP, 1 g of PAN, and 0.5 g nickel acetate in 10 mL of DMF for 6 h with stirring. Then, the mixed solution was injected into electrospinning equipment using a syringe and syringe pump at 10 μL min−1. The needle with 0.1 mm diameter was linked to the positive terminal of a power supply to provide a voltage of 15 kV at 15 cm from the collector. The collected nanofibers were heated at 600 °C for 1 h to convert into crystalline NiO nanotubes.
Assembly of NiO NT-incorporated perovskite solar cells
The patterned fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) glass was cleaned by sonication with deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 60 min, separately. Then, O2/Ar plasma was treated on FTO glass for 5 min. The compact layer with 50 nm thickness was coated on FTO glass with TiO2 nanocrystal solution with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) using a spin-coater with 4000 rpm for 45 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. The preparation of CH3NH3I powder has been published elsewhere.8,9 The dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (ratio 10:1) solution with a 48 wt% mixture of CH3NH3I:PbI2 at a ratio of 1:1 was prepared for the control perovskite layer. To prepare NiO NTs incorporated precursor solution, the NiO NTs were dissolved in DMF solution using the sonication method with respect to concentration 0.5–1.25 mg mL−1. The rest of the procedure is the same as for the control solution. The prepared perovskite solution was cast onto the substrate by consecutive two different rate spin coating at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and 40 s. At 4000 rpm step, diethyl ether (150 μL) was dripped on the FTO substrate to obtain the MAI-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase film. Then, the prepared films were annealed at 25 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 60 min to form the perovskite films (CH3NH3PbI3). To obtain a large grain size, the solvent annealing method was used.23 The perovskite film was covered with a Petri dish during the 100 °C annealing process, and 5 μL of DMSO was added inside at the edge of the Petri dish. The hole transfer layer was spin-coated by using 10 μL of spiro-MeOTAD solution with 3500 rpm for 45 s. The spiro-MeOTAD solution consisted of 1 mL chlorobenzene, 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl)imide salt/acetonitrile solution. Finally, an Au counter electrode was formed by thermal evaporation. In the case of carbon-based PSCs, the process of washing FTO and coating the compact layer was the same as for the planar type. Then, a mesoporous layer was spin-coated on the compact layer at 3500 rpm for 30 s, and calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to give the film crystallinity. The perovskite layer was also coated by the same process as the planar type. Without a hole transport layer, a carbon electrode was screen-printed on the perovskite layer using carbon paste, mixing 2 wt% carbon black and FTU-16 paste to improve the contact between the carbon electrode and the perovskite layer. The FTU-16 paste was purchased from Asahi Chemical Research Laboratory with ≤20 Ω sq−1. The carbon electrode was cured at 100 °C for 20 min. The active area was 0.108 cm2. Our experimental process was carried out in air with 20% humidity.
Characterization
The TEM and FE-SEM images were measured with a JEOL JEM-200CX and JEOL JSM6700-F. The SEM-EPMA elemental mapping images were measured by JXA-8530F which is installed at the National Center for Inter-university Research Facilities (NCIRF). X-ray diffraction measurements were taken with a M18XHF-SRA (Mac Science Co., Yokohama, Japan) with a CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 300 mA (12 kW). UV-vis spectra were determined by a Lamda 35 (Perkin-Elmer). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were obtained by an AXIS-Hsi. The EIS spectra were measured by a Zahaner Electric IM6 analyzer from 0.1 Hz to 250 kHz under a light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs were measured using a 500 W xenon lamp (XIL model 05A50KS source units). The incident photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) was measured from 300 nm to 850 nm (PV measurement. Inc., Boulder, CO). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were obtained with a 405 nm pulse laser (PicoQuant).
