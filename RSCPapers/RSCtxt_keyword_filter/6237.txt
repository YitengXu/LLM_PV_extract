    , Accepted 4th January 2014First published on 6th January 2014AbstractHighly efficient plasmonic Ag rear electrodes in top-illuminated PSCs employing MoO3/Ag (13 nm)/MoO3 stacks as top transparent electrodes were successfully demonstrated, resulting in the significant enhancement of solar cell performance with a PCE of up to 7.18%. The hemispherical Ag nanostructured arrays effectively concentrate incident light within the photoactive layer in addition to contributing to extended stability with a robust structure.
Due to their low manufacturing cost and the possibility of fabrication in lightweight flexible plastics, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received significant research attention as potential next-generation solar energy-harvesting devices.1 However, PSC performance is currently below commercial requirements, limiting their potential for use in environmentally renewable energy systems.2 Therefore, intensive research effort has been devoted to enhance their efficiency by increasing light absorption within the photoactive layer. Several absorption enhancement strategies have been proposed, including ray-optical regimes3 photonic crystals,4 optical cavities,5 and plasmonic nanostructures.6
Among the proposed enhancement methods, the surface plasmon approach, in particular, has attracted considerable attention due to its unique tunable optical resonance feature and near-field concentration for enhancing light trapping and absorption. It has been reported that a considerable efficiency enhancement of Si,7 dye-sensitized,8 and organic9 solar cells is possible by employing metallic nanostructures within the devices. This efficiency enhancement is generally attributed to increased light absorption in the photoactive layer arising from surface plasmon resonances that lead to a strong near field enhancement as well as highly efficient light scattering.10
However, the surface plasmonic approach has suffered several drawbacks, including an intrinsic weakness of charge trapping,11 exciton quenching,12 modification of the active layer morphology by the incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs),13 a risk of short-circuiting,14 long-term instability caused by the aggregation of NPs,15 and the functionality of recombination sites for NPs blended in a polymer host.16 In fact, a majority of the surface plasmon techniques used for enhancing cell performance have been employed by encapsulating NPs within the active layer or the interfacial layer, which most efficiently exploits the near field enhancement. However, exploitation of the surface plasmons in solar cells has been intensively investigated by incorporating nanostructures such as gating and NPs into the electrode as one part of the electrode, namely, a nanostructured electrode, in order to prevent the embedded NP system problem. This incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures into electrodes for light trapping offers an attractive solution to realize higher-efficiency PSCs with PCE > 10%.17
In the case of a surface plasmon based nanostructured electrode, the metallic nanostructures are preferably positioned on the rear side of the solar cell, mainly due to the fact that they can give rise to destructive Fano interference at the front of the cell and would parasitically reflect and absorb a significant amount of incident light before it reaches the active layer.18 However, it is very difficult to place the nanostructures at the rear side of PSCs since the fabrication process of the PSCs typically begins with a transparent electrode such as commercial ITO glass, such that nanostructure formation is followed by the deposition of an organic active layer. This is a significant problem since organic materials are readily damaged by the harsh processing conditions often involved in nanofabrication or nanopatterning. Therefore, it is very important to design a newly optimized surface plasmon system with compatible geometry enhanced light absorption within the active layer. This can be achieved by locating the plasmon inducing nanostructures (NPs, grating) below the active layer. Simultaneously, the active layer should not suffer from any damage during the nanostructure fabrication process, thus creating high performance plasmonic PSCs with long-term stability.
In this work, we developed a new surface plasmon assisted top illuminated PSC by employing plasmonic hemispherical Ag nanostructures on the back of the active layer. Our fabrication process begins with the nanostructured rear electrode, in contrast to the conventional surface plasmonic electrode processing step that starts with the ITO transparent electrode. The plasmonic hemispherical-shaped isolated Ag nanostructured array was preferentially fabricated onto glass substrates through the utilization of a simple surface-tension-induced agglomeration method. An additional thick Ag film, electron transportation layer, active layer, and top transparent electrode were progressively built for the completed devices. The power conversion efficiency of the resulting top illuminated PSCs with a dense hemispherical Ag nanostructure was significantly increased from 5.75% to 7.18%, due to powerful light-trapping via the surface plasmon and scattering effect. Moreover, our device exhibits long-term stability and an extended lifetime in comparison with common cell devices. Our method has several advantages over existing surface plasmon approaches: (1) detrimental effects on the absorption are avoided by changing the geometry of the system such that the hemispherical Ag nanostructures are on the rear of the device. Importantly, contamination on the active layer can be prevented due to the preceding nanostructure manufacturing process in advance of the active layer coating; (2) the formation of random arrays of Ag nanostructures with diameters of 80 ± 20 nm and hemispherical shapes (difficult to achieve with standard photolithography techniques) is well suited for light trapping;19 (3) the non-contact method guarantees zero-risk of depositing debris on the surface; (4) nanostructure fabrication employs the surface-tension-induced agglomeration method, which is inherently simple due to the lack of requirements for the positioning and removal of a mask. Therefore, the simple and rapid surface-tension-induced agglomeration method is compatible with large photovoltaic module production which requires inexpensive and scalable techniques for the fabrication of metallic nanostructures in a controlled method.
Top illuminated PSCs with a nanostructured Ag rear electrode were fabricated (Fig. 1). This was done to prevent contamination of the active layer during the embossing step, which can lead to Schottky barrier formation at the organic/metal interface. First, an 8 nm thick Ag film was deposited onto cleaned glass substrates using thermal evaporation (Fig. 1a and b). They were then heated at 300 °C for 30 minutes under an N2 atmosphere to generate isolated Ag nanostructured arrays from flat Ag films on the glass substrate (Fig. 1c). It has been well reported that thin Ag films break up under surface tension during heat treatment and agglomerate into a random array of nanostructures on glass substrates.19 An additional 100 nm thick Ag film was then deposited on the hemispherical Ag nanostructured arrays on the glass surface in order to achieve an opaque rear electrode with a hemispherical Ag structural array. In fact, the formation of random arrays of nanostructured Ag with diameters of 80 ± 20 nm and a hemispherical shape is ideal for improving light absorption capabilities in the active layer (Fig. 1d).20 PFN (poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))) was uniformly spin-coated on the rear electrode as an electron transportation layer (Fig. 1e). PFN can provide efficient electron injection in most noble metals with a high work function by lowering the effective work function.21 The 5 nm thick PFN layer is thin enough for the photoactive layer to benefit from light concentration in the vicinity of the electrode due to plasmonic effects.22 It is also thick enough to prevent exciton quenching by the electrode.23 An active layer consisting of an approximately 80 nm thick blend of the low-bandgap semiconducting polymer poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b] as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as an electron acceptor was spin-casted on the PFN layer (Fig. 1f). Instead of a commonly used ITO transparent electrode, we used a MoO3(40 nm)–Ag(13 nm)–MoO3(10 nm) stack (MAMS) as a transparent electrode (Fig. 1g) due to its relatively high conductivity and low extinction coefficient in the visible range.24

The formation of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode for the PSCs was determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig. 2). In the reference cell without Ag nanostructured arrays, the 110 nm thick Ag rear electrode is very flat with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.53 nm (Fig. 2a). After thermal annealing of 8 nm thick Ag films on the glass, hemispherical-shaped Ag nanostructured arrays were uniformly distributed on top of the glass substrate and ranged in diameter from 60 to 100 nm with an RMS roughness of 14.7 nm (Fig. 2b). After thermal evaporation to produce an additional 100 nm thick Ag film, the surface morphology of the Ag nanostructured array was almost retained with a slight reduction of the RMS roughness from 14.7 to 11.2 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c. The inset figure represents the surface profile of a single hemispherical nanostructure. The three dimensional SEM image of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode also shows that the electrodes are remarkably robust towards aggregation during solution processing, having an average diameter of 80 ± 20 nm and a surface coverage of 35 ± 5% of the Ag nanostructure (Fig. 2e). After spin-coating of the electron transportation PFN layer, the surface morphology was still maintained to an acceptable degree due to the features of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode (Fig. 2d). Therefore, the protrusion of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode would result not only in a greater absorption of light, but also in electrical enhancement via a larger surface area.

To illustrate the effects of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode on the performance of PSCs, the current density versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 illumination as shown in Fig. 3a. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the short current density (Jsc) of the devices was enhanced from 12.11 to 13.47 mA cm−2 after the incorporation of the plasmonic Ag nanostructures on the rear electrode, with the enhancement ratio reaching as high as 11.23%. In addition, the series resistance (Rs) of the device decreased from 7.39 Ω cm2 to 3.81 Ω cm2 due to the increased interfacial area of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode. Furthermore, an increase of the parallel resistance from 645.99 Ω cm2 to 790.51 Ω cm2 contributes to the higher fill factor (FF). The overall power conversion efficiency was significantly increased from 5.75 to 7.18%, mainly due to the improved photocurrent density, as a result of enhanced absorption of the photoactive conjugate polymer due to the high electromagnetic field strength in the vicinity of the excited surface plasmons. To the authors' knowledge, the 7.18% efficiency of the PSCs with hemispherical Ag nanostructures on the rear electrode exhibits one of the best cell performances among ITO free PSCs reported in the literature to date.

In order to elucidate the light trapping nature of the top illuminated PSCs with hemispherical Ag nanostructured arrays, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device in the presence and absence of hemispherical Ag nanostructured arrays was measured (Fig. 3b). The variation in the EQE indicates an increase in the number of carriers generated and/or an improvement in the charge collection efficiency at a particular wavelength.25 The EQE of the top-illuminated PSC with Ag nanostructures was significantly enhanced over the wide spectral region, and the maximum EQE was increased from 41.03% to 57.51% at approximately 400 nm. The EQE enhancement ratio in the presence and absence of the nanostructured Ag rear electrode is plotted in Fig. 3b in order to determine which spectral region contributed to the EQE enhancement. It is shown that the EQE enhancement covers a broad spectral region from 350 nm to 750 nm, although a particularly significant enhancement was located at around 400 nm, 550 nm, and 720 nm.
The diffuse reflectance measurement of the top illuminated PSCs with and without the nanostructures further verifies the relationship between the nanostructure of the rear electrodes and the EQE enhancement (Fig. 3c). It is shown that reflectance of the PSCs with nanostructures was significantly lower than that of the reference device in the region of significant light absorption (350 nm < λ < 750 nm). Since the intensity of reflectance is proportional to the number of unabsorbed photons, a lower reflectance indicates stronger absorption.26 Therefore, the lower reflectivity of the top illuminated PSCs with the nanostructured Ag electrode means that a larger fraction of incident photons are absorbed. As a result, the hemispherical Ag nanostructured arrays play a significant role in the EQE enhancement for 350 nm < λ < 750 nm.
In addition, the authors discovered that the long-term stability of the top-illuminated PSCs is considerably improved when using dense hemispherical Ag nanostructures on the rear electrode. The stability of top illuminated PSCs with a nanostructured Ag electrode was investigated in air under ambient conditions. As presented in Fig. 3d and S1,† top illuminated PSCs with a nanostructured Ag rear electrode exhibited superior air stability, almost retaining all of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after exposure to ambient conditions for an extended period of over 7 days. In contrast, the PCE of the conventional device with the Al top electrode was reduced to less than half of its initial efficiency after one day and entirely degraded after four days.27 This may be attributed to a consequence of the result that two MoO3 layers sandwiching a central Ag film can saturate and stabilize the inner and outer metal surface, passivating it against most degradation mechanisms.28 The hemispherical Ag nanostructures supported at the rear electrodes also contributed to enhancement of the stability and lifetime of the PSCs, compared to devices that embed NPs in the photoactive layer,29 while light absorption in the photoactive layer can be greatly increased by the surface plasmon effect. Thus, top illuminated PSCs with a nanostructured Ag rear electrode can be greatly stabilized by introducing MoO3 oxide layers at both the Ag top electrode and securely anchoring the hemispherical Ag nanostructures to the rear electrode.
We conducted 3D finite-difference time domain (FDTD) numerical simulations of the optical effects of PSCs with nanostructured Ag rear electrodes and a reference PSC in order to understand the surface plasmon behavior originating from the protrusion of hemispherical Ag nanostructures in the completed devices. The configuration of the Ag nanostructure was approximated using a hemispherical shape with a diameter of 80 nm. The distance was calculated to be 120 nm according to the surface coverage of nanostructures in the SEM image (Fig. 2e). The input source was a monochromatic wave with a wavelength of 400 nm and 550 nm, at which the EQE was considerably enhanced through the surface plasmon effect. Field snapshot images of the simulation results are presented in Fig. 4, showing strong field intensity enhancements near the nanoparticles at the wavelengths of 400 nm and 550 nm. Therefore, those multiple enhancement peaks (EQE) can be explained by surface plasmon resonance which strongly confines the electromagnetic field within the active layer by largely increasing the scattering cross-section (Fig. S2†). Further investigation of the near-zone field intensity vs. time was performed and the plots were obtained at a fixed location in the simulated domain. As described in Fig. S3,† compared to the reference device, the field intensity near the protrusion of the Ag nanostructures was increased by less than twice at a wavelength of 400 nm. The near-field intensity plots for the various locations within the photoactive layer prove that the field enhancement is more effective on the nanostructured Ag rear electrode. The pointed edge configuration of the hemispherical Ag rear electrode can generate plasmonic field enhancement due to the resonant oscillation of the plasmon wave.30 In contrast, the reference device did not produce significant plasmonic field enhancement. Therefore, a nanostructured Ag electrode with a hemispherical shape on the back surface of the photoactive layer can couple sunlight into the SPP modes supported at the metal–semiconductor interfaces as well as guided modes in the semiconductor slab, whereupon the light is converted to photo-carriers in the semiconductor.22 Consequently, we are therefore able to demonstrate and explain the EQE enhancement both experimentally and theoretically.

The magnitude of the enhanced electric-field intensity E is indicated by the color scale. 
To conclude, in this paper, highly efficient plasmonic Ag rear electrodes in top-illuminated PSCs employing MAM as the top transparent electrodes were successfully fabricated. Significant enhancement of the solar cell performance with a PCE of up to 7.18% was demonstrated. The presence of hemispherical Ag nanostructures on the back of the active layer not only improves light harvesting via the surface plasmon and scattering effect, but also greatly contributes to the stability and lifetime of the PSCs by anchoring the hemispherical Ag nanostructures to the rear electrode. The enhanced light absorption based on the surface plasmon and scattering effect, which effectively increased the short-circuit current density of the device, was experimentally and theoretically interpreted. The new approach serves as a surface plasmonic procedure for enhancing the performance and stability of plastic solar cells.
Experimental section
Fabrication of Ag nanostructured arrays
Soda lime glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by sonication in detergent, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. They were then dried under a N2 stream. Ag films with a thickness of 8 nm were deposited onto cleaned glass substrates using thermal evaporation. The samples were then annealed at 300 °C in an ambient atmosphere of N2 for 30 minutes for Ag nanostructure agglomeration.
Device fabrication
PTB7 and PC70BM were supplied by 1-material, Chemscitech Inc. The bottom 110 nm and 100 nm Ag cathodes were deposited on bare soda glass substrates and nanostructured Ag modified soda glass substrates, respectively. The interlayer material was dissolved in methanol in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid. The solution was spin-coated on top of the Ag cathode to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm. Photoactive layers with a thickness of 80 nm were obtained by spin-coating a mixed solvent of dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3% by volume) on the PFN interlayer.23 10 nm of MoO3 was thermally deposited as a hole transportation layer under a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr with a deposition rate of 0.2 Å s−1. 13 nm of Ag was subsequently deposited as a top electrode at a rate of 2 Å s−1. A 40 nm capping layer of MoO3 was deposited on the Ag electrode at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1.
Characterization
The AFM images in scan mode were taken on a Veeco multi-mode AFM with a nanoscope III controller. The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were tested in air using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a 150 W solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter from Newport Corporation at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. All data related to the device performance presented in this article were averaged over at least 10 devices from repeated experiments. The series resistance and parallel resistance were calculated from the inverse of the slope in the J–V curve at 0.8 V and 0 V, respectively.
Optical simulation of nanostructures
A finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation was performed by calculating the monochromatic wave irradiation on the top-illuminated PSCs with a nanostructured Ag rear electrode embedded with the nanostructure arrays. The input source was a monochromatic wave with a wavelength of 400 nm and 550 nm, at which the EQE was significantly improved by embedding the Ag nanostructured arrays.
