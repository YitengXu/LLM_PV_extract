Introduction
The motivation to control interfacial interactions on the nanoscale leads to a new class of materials known as nanocomposites.1–4 The idea is to co-assemble organic and inorganic precursors into a nanocomposite material with molecular level control over interfaces, structure, and morphology.5,6 The designed structures may exhibit properties and functions unattainable in the individual components. Harnessing the advantages of organic–inorganic nanocomposite materials requires fine-tuning of the sizes, topologies, and spatial assembly of individual domains and their interfaces. Furthermore, in order to exploit the full potential of the technological applications of the nanomaterials, it is very important to endow them with good processability,7–20 which has ultimately guided research towards using polymers as one of the components resulting in a special class of hybrid materials: polymer nanocomposites.
Depending upon the nature of association between the inorganic and polymeric components, nanocomposites can be classified into two categories: one in which the inorganic material (nanocrystals, colloids, polyoxometalates) is embedded in a polymeric matrix,21 and the other where the organic polymer is confined into an inorganic template.22 In the first case, inorganic-in-organic composites, the good processability and low density of the polymer component, in combination with the high mechanical durability and well-defined optoelectronic properties of the inorganic component, are harnessed. This allows the combinations of the advantages of the rapidly developing field in opto-electronic technology23 with attractive properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). Optical properties of this class of lumophores are determined by the quantum confinement effect, so that their emission color and the electron affinity can be finely controlled, not only by the material choice, but also by size within a single synthetic route. State of the art syntheses, which can be carried out either in organic solvents or in water, provide a broad palette of II–VI, III–V and IV–VI NCs with variable size and a narrow size distribution leading to narrow emission spectra—25–35 nm full width at half maximum in solution—tuneable from the UV to the near-infrared spectral region.24,25 Proper surface passivation leads to improved chemical stability and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of >50% for so-called core–shell NCs like CdSe/ZnS26 or CdSe/CdS,27 where the large bandgap semiconductors (ZnS or CdS) epitaxially overgrow the core material (CdSe) and the band edges of the core material lie inside the bandgap of the outer material (type I structures). Variable surface chemistry of NCs allows for the ease of their processability from different solvents and for their incorporation into different organic matrices. The basic idea behind NC based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to achieve full color tuneability in a single host material. Organic semiconductors such as conjugated polymers represent large polymer chains that are soft and flexible. On the other hand, semiconductor NCs as inorganic species are robust. Inorganic semiconductors are well known to change their emission color over a very wide spectral range, while in organic semiconductors this effect is less pronounced and often goes in hand with changed electrical properties. Although organic molecules span the entire visible spectrum in terms of emission wavelength, a change of material required to tune the color of emission can result in a dramatic modification of the charge transport properties and thus of the device characteristics. A key goal of research into hybrid NC-based OLEDs is therefore a separate optimization of charge transport and emission properties, which can be achieved in certain hybrid devices.6 Whereas organic semiconductors are typically hole transporting materials, NC solids generally display strongly n-type behavior,28i.e. in most cases preferentially conduct electrons, which make the two classes of materials a natural choice of partners. Therefore, combination of both components within nanocomposites enhances the range of potential optoelectronic applications.
Photodiodes based on organic polymers rely on the presence of a second component facilitating charge separation, with fullerenes being a typical example.29 An alternative way to achieve efficient charge separation is to combine polymers with inorganic semiconductor NCs (i.e. based on cadmium chalcogenides or on lead chalcogenides). Size- and material-dependent energy levels of a semiconductor NC allow for an elegant solution in adjustment of their electron affinity, favoring charge separation at the interface with polymers. The charge transfer rate can be remarkably fast in the case of polymers chemically bound to NCs, allowing a high percentage of excitons generated in polymers and/or NCs to dissociate at the interface. Chemical bonding of the NCs and polymers naturally overcomes problems related to purely defined morphological issues of hybrid photodiodes. Furthermore, quantum confinement leads to an enhancement of the absorption coefficients of NCs compared to the respective bulk materials, making them efficient absorbers even in relatively thin devices.30 The performance in such devices is strongly dependent on the local and long-range film morphologies. Such molecular and mesoscale structural features can in many cases be modified by incorporation into a suitable polymer host matrix to form a composite material.
In this Feature Article, we describe examples of general principles of device operation, followed by selected examples on the design and synthesis of conjugated polymers and organic compounds and inorganic semiconductor NCs, and material choices for devices based on combinations of polymers with NCs.
Organic LEDs
OLEDs based on charge-transporting and light-emitting organic molecules or polymers31–33 have been gaining much interest in both academic and applied research. In organic optoelectronic devices there is much room to tailor both the devices and the materials designs.
The first conjugated polymer LEDs appeared in their simplest form and consisted of ∼100 nm of a PPV polymer film sandwiched between two electrodes: indium tin oxide, ITO (for hole injection and transparency), and a lower work function metal (for electron injection)34,35 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic energy band representation of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PPV/Ca LED, showing the basic processes leading to electroluminescence. 
Even in these single-layer and single-material LEDs one can consider all the basic processes which have to be optimized in any LED. The processes leading to electroluminescence (EL) in OLEDs, when a positive bias is applied, can be divided as follows: charge injection and charge transport followed by charge recombination to form excitons (singlets and triplets) and subsequent radiative recombination of some of the singlet excitons leading to light emission. The enormous improvement of the performance of OLEDs over the last two decades has been achieved by the optimization of the introduced processes leading to light emission. The hole injection can be improved by introduction of conducting polymers (such as PEDOT)36 as well as by engineering the interface using monolayers that introduce a graded bandgap or electric dipole.37,38 The electron injection and the balancing of electron and hole injection was largely done through systematic modifications of the polymer structure and the resulting electronic properties.39,40 The exciton recombination and the maximum quantum efficiency seemed to be elusive for some time as it was believed that the maximum EL efficiency was limited to 25% due to the formation of non-emissive triplets. However, in recent years the use of triplet emitters41,42 paved the way to significantly higher efficiencies by placing the theoretical limit at 100%.14,43 At the same time it also became apparent that the 25 : 75 singlet to triplet ratio is not so general and ratios closer to 50 : 50 were reported for polymers.44,45
This field has been rapidly progressing23,46 so that the currently available OLEDs for color application are highly advanced in terms of lifetime (100000 h), operation voltage (below 5 V) and efficiency (above 20 lm W−1), and most of these record performances are being reported by commercial companies.47–49
Organic photovoltaics
The constraints in the use of organic semiconductors in photovoltaic applications are very much determined by the fact that the excited states produced by photon absorption are usually excitons that have relatively high binding energies and do not dissociate to give electrons and holes.32 Exciton ionization in the bulk is therefore not a promising method to follow. However, it is known that exciton dissociation is efficient at interfaces formed between materials with different electron affinities and ionization potentials, where the electron is accepted by the material with larger electron affinity and the hole by the material with lower ionization potential.50 The built-in potential in a single-layer organic photodiode, which results from the difference in work function of the cathode and anode, is usually insufficient to induce efficient charge separation. Therefore, in order to obtain free charges in a conjugated polymer, a more effective exciton dissociation mechanism is required and is typically manifested in the form of a junction. The simplest structure is that of a bilayer heterojunction, formed by a layer of a hole-accepting material and a second layer of an electron-accepting material. It has been shown that if the energy discontinuity at the junction is sufficiently large exciton dissociation (charge generation) is efficient.51,52 The intensively studied bilayer device is fabricated with a layer of conjugated polymer and a layer of buckminsterfullerene, C60, where the achieved external monochromatic quantum efficiency values are about 9%.53,54

Fig. 2 schematically illustrates how exciton dissociation and charge collection can be improved by using a polymer blend as the active layer in photodiodes. In this way, when an exciton is created in the film after light absorption it is easier for it to find an interface where dissociation may occur. The free charges obtained are afterwards transferred to the appropriate phase of electron acceptor or hole acceptor. Subsequently, they are driven by the electrical field to the electrodes. Very recently, such devices have been reported to top 5% power conversion efficiency.55–57
 Fig. 2  Cross section of a hetero-junction photovoltaic device with a conjugated polymer for hole transport and C60fullerene for electron transport (redrawn according to ref. 17). Phase separation increases the number of active interfaces in the device, improving exciton dissociation. Optimized phase separation may also improve charge transport in the device. Holes are collected at the anode and electrons are collected at the cathode. 
Synthesis of conjugated polymers
Since the discovery of electroluminescence from conjugated polymers by Burroughes, Friend, Holmes and coworkers,58 there has been considerable industrial and academic interest in semiconducting polymers as the active material for EL applications. There is a passionate pursuit of the design and development of materials that meet application criteria such as desired emission colors with high emission intensity and efficiency, and good environmental stability. In particular the control of the emission color, of charge-accepting and -transporting properties, which are important for optimizing device efficiency, and of electrical and optical stability, which are vital factors in determining device lifetimes, must be addressed. In light absorbing applications there is a stronger focus on a broad spectral response to the absorbed light, the charge transport and the morphological behavior of the conjugated polymers such as phase separation and charge transport within the respective domains on a mesoscopic level (nm–µm). Some of the most common methods to address the above-mentioned issues will be briefly discussed in the following sections.
Methods of synthesis
A large variety of homo-,59–62 co-,59,60,62–65 block co-,66–71 dendritic72–83 and end-group functionalized semiconducting polymers84–87 has been synthesized, mainly stimulated by the developments in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This becomes obvious when looking at the enormous amount of scientific publications coming close to 15000 and in the numerous review articles dealing with these classes of polymers.59,60,62,88–108 Most of the articles describing synthetic procedures deal with derivatives of semiconducting polymers of the poly(arylene vinylene) (PAV),58 poly(arylene ethynylene) (PAE),109 and polyarylene (PA)40,60,62,94 families. Large numbers of derivatives have been synthesized to optimize absorbing and emitting behavior, charge accepting or transporting properties as well as the long-range assembly phenomena.
Main synthetic procedures for poly(arylene vinylene)s
Widely used in the poly(arylene vinylene) (PAV) (for some representatives see Fig. 3) synthesis are the quinodimethane polymerization reactions such as the Wessling–Zimmerman route,110 and modifications like the Vanderzande route,111 the Gilch route112 or the Hörhold route.113 PAVs are also available viapolycondensation reactions such as the Witting–Horner reaction.114 Furthermore, there are transition-metal-mediated reaction methods to obtain PAVs. Prominent is the Heck coupling reaction,115 and the Stille coupling reaction.116Metathesis polymerization procedures also lead to PAVs. Famous are the Csanyi route117 and the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reaction118 by Grubbs.
 Fig. 3  Some main representatives of poly(arylene vinylene)s: poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV), methyl ethylhexyl poly(phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV), dihexyl cyano poly(phenylene vinylene) (CN-PPV). 
The structure–property relationship in PAVs regarding the emission color is mainly affected by two structural elements: the effects of the substituents and the degree of conjugation along the backbone.
In EL devices balanced charge injection is a fundamental prerequisite for high EL quantum efficiencies. PAVs represent the most promising class of polymers with respect to the fabrication of such EL devices and consequently the optimization of the structure–property relationship is mandatory. Hole and electron transporting moieties can be connected to the polymer backbone inducing improved charge transport. On the other hand, the presence of meta-linkages or silicon atoms119 effectively reduces the π-conjugation length of the polymer main chain. As a direct result the emission wavelength is shifted to the blue region.97
Main synthetic procedures for poly(arylene ethynylene)s
The poly(arylene ethynylene) (PAE) (for a representative structure see Fig. 4) synthesis15,109,120,121 has been mainly developed based on procedures of the so-called Hagihara–Sonogashira coupling122 and by a metathesis procedure developed by Bunz.109 The structure–property relationship of PAEs is given by their more rigid backbone than that of PAVs, so that they show a greater tendency to strongly aggregate which leads to a strong red-shift of their emission in the solid state.
 Fig. 4  Main structure of poly(arylene ethynylene): poly(phenylene ethynylene). R represents some oxyalkyl chains. 
Due to their rigid nature the PAEs are applied in nanotechnology as “molecular wires” or as “molecular alligator clips” in between two gold electrodes. Another use of these polymers resulting from their structure–property relationship is in sensing applications104 basically due to their high PL quantum efficiencies that can be efficiently quenched.97
Main synthetic procedures for poly(arylene)s

          Polyarylenes (PAs) (for some structures see Fig. 5) are accessible via the oxidative coupling of arenes,123 but also via the reductive coupling of arenes which is namely the coupling according to Yamamoto.124 Transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions are also paving the way to PAs: namely the Suzuki polycondensation,125 McCullough126 and Rieke routes,127 as well as the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) method.128 The structure–property relationship of PAs is largely structure dependent. The nature of the arene units strongly affects the emission. Therefore a facile copolymer design allows tuning of the emission color of PA polymers. Furthermore, the planarity of the PA system does affect the emission color additionally: the more planar the system is, the better the conjugation and thus the smaller the bandgaps. Substituents also affect the color as steric interactions can produce out-of-plane twisting of the polymer backbone leading to blue-shifted emission. Since aggregation can lead to red-shifts in emission, or enhance non-radiative pathways, attaching bulky side groups to increase interchain separation can be used to control the emission color and to enhance the PL efficiency. The charge accepting and transport properties can be influenced by introducing suitable units in the main chain, or in the side chain.
 Fig. 5  Some representative structures of poly(arylene)s. Shown are poly(phenylene) (PP), poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT), poly(fluorene) (PF) and poly(carbazole) (PC), where R represents an alkyl chain. 
The regular alternation of electron-rich and electron-deficient repeat units induces a high planarity of the conjugated backbone with intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in low bandgaps.97meta-Linkages129 or the presence of silicon atoms,119,130 amongst others,131–133 are known to effectively reduce the π-conjugation length of the polymer main chain, also for PAs. As a direct result the emission wavelength is shifted to the blue region97 making them attractive matrices for triplet emitters14 or semiconductor NCs.61 In particular polyfluorenes40,62,94 became very prominent as host polymers in light-emitting diodes, because of their wide bandgap and good conducting properties. Through their modification with hole- or electron-conducting moieties, efficient charge transport materials hosting other fluorophores can be designed.14,43,61,134 Introducing a silicon atom in the 9-position130 allows them to be made stable against oxidation in the 9-position that causes an undesired green emission band.130 For photodiodes and sensor applications on the other hand, poly(thiophene)s emerged to become a very important class of polymers.60 PAs are basically applied in all fields of polymer (opto)electronic research.

Conjugated polymers used in light-emitting devices
The use of semiconducting, conjugated polymers has a long tradition in light-emitting diodes.16,58,135 All UV-Vis colors could be achieved.60,65,97 Furthermore, low bandgap polymers64 have been designed for emission in the NIR region.90,136 To achieve such low bandgap semiconducting polymers,90,92,137–140 potential excited state electron donor and potential excited state electron acceptor units are copolymerized (for the excited state electron donor–excited state electron acceptor principle in order to achieve low bandgap polymers see Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Principle of lowering the optical bandgap in low bandgap polymer composites. Absorption takes place from the donor's highest occupied molecule orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecule orbital (LUMO) of the excited state electron acceptor moiety. Typical excited state electron donor moieties are thienyl derivatives and typical excited state electron acceptor moieties are quinoxalines, benzothiadiazoles or thienylpyrazines. 
Electron and hole transporting functionalities have been introduced into semiconducting polymers as well as emissive units tuning the respective emission color. Recent development to enhance the device efficiency involves the use of triplet emitters for enhanced efficiency (theoretically 100%, 25% singlet and 75% triplet excitons that combine for the internal light emission efficiency).43 Such systems usually consist of a fluorescent donor and a phosphorescent acceptor. Possible triplet emitters making all emission colors possible are mostly metal complexes of platinum141 and iridium.14,43,142 Such phosphorescent small-molecule OLEDs reveal external efficiencies of about 22%,14,43 while internal efficiencies of organic only polymer LEDs are about 15–20%.143

Conjugated polymers used in photovoltaic devices
In bulk heterojunction solar cells102,144–146 traditionally two types of conjugated polymers102 are widely used, namely derivatives of poly(phenylene vinylene) PPV147–150 and polythiophenes. With poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO PPV) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (C60-PCBM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (C70-PCBM) efficiencies of around 3% could be achieved.151 With poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)152 as hole transporter and C60-PCBM as electron transporter 5% efficiency has been reported for optimized cells.153 Many other conjugated polymers have been tested, but none of them could thus far (used solely) top the 5% of P3HT, a regio-regular polythiophene with good stacking behavior. To date, many efforts have been focused on the design of conjugated polymers utilizing the donor–acceptor approach90,137 (Fig. 6) in order to achieve low bandgap polymers for tuning the absorption over the 300–1500 nm spectral range; 2.4% efficiency has been reported combining a low bandgap polymer with PCBM,154 and it is currently an active matter of research to reach the targeted 6–8% efficiency of this kind of materials being announced.155 By an elegant blending approach utilizing alkanedithiols, introduced by Heeger and coworkers,55 the efficiency of such solar cells using low bandgap polymers can be dramatically increased to 5.5% through altering the film morphology. The Heeger team furthermore showed an improvement by changing the solar cell architecture to a tandem cell achieving 6% efficiency.56 To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency to date reported for organic polymer photovoltaics. These recent and very promising developments give realistic hope that the targeted efficiencies will be achieved by further tailoring the low bandgap polymers and by optimizing the morphologies of the polymer solar cells.
Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals
The availability of reliable colloidal syntheses leading to semiconductor NCs being uniform in composition, size, shape, and surface chemistry is crucial both for the study of their size-dependent properties and for further use in different applications. Briefly describing the state of the art in the semiconductor NC area we outline the challenges as well as the flexibility in defining the NC structures (organic passivation, core-only NCs, type I and type II core–shell NCs) and hence their properties (tuneable energy levels and emission spectral range). A typical semiconductor NC, which can also be thought of as a colloidal quantum dot, consists of an inorganic core, which is comparable to or smaller in size than the Bohr exciton diameter of the corresponding bulk material, surrounded (“passivated”) by an organic shell of ligands (Fig. 7). The choice of a suitable capping ligand (“stabilizer”) can be considered as a key point in an advanced colloidal synthesis of semiconductor NCs. Stabilizers regulate the growth rate and the size of NCs, prevent them (to a greater or lesser extent) from (photo-)oxidation and provide a dielectric barrier at the surface thus eliminating (partially) surface traps. Importantly, stabilizers, being organic molecules with free functional groups, make NCs stable as colloidal dispersions in different solvents and allow their further handling (attachment to different surfaces, covalent coupling with each other and with other molecules, etc.). A very convenient and generally applicable liquid–solid–solution (LSS) synthesis approach was recently introduced allowing the synthesis of numerous NCs, including TiO2, CuO, ZrO2, SnO2, CdS, Ag2S, ZnS, PbS, MnS, ZnSe and CdSe.156

(b) Schematic representation of a NC consisting of a semiconductor core coated by trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) molecules (c) which is one of the organic molecules typically used as a ligand. (d) Schematic representation of a water-soluble CdTe NC coated by short-chain mercapto-acid molecules, another typical organic ligand. 

Nanocrystals for applications at visible wavelengths
The synthesis of CdSe NCs by the reaction of dimethylcadmium with trioctylphosphine selenide in a trioctylphosphine oxide–trioctylphosphine (TOPO–TOP)157 or TOPO–TOP–hexadecylamine (HDA)158 mixtures of coordinating solvents at 250–300 °C allows the preparation of NCs with sizes from ∼1.7 to 15 nm soluble in a variety of organic solvents like toluene, n-hexane, chloroform, etc.
Type I core–shell nanocrystals
A large step towards the preparation of robust highly luminescent NCs was the passivation of their surface with an inorganic shell of a semiconductor with wider bandgap (usually ZnS or CdS)26,27 in analogy with the well developed techniques for the growth of type I quantum wells (Fig. 8). The lattice mismatch between the CdSe core and the ZnS or CdS shell is small enough to allow epitaxial growth, if the shell thickness is low.159 In type I core–shell NCs the large bandgap semiconductor forms a closed outer shell and the band edges of the core material lie inside the bandgap of the outer material. The outer inorganic shell efficiently passivates core surface states and considerably improves the chemical stability and photostability of the NCs, resulting in high PL efficiency. Using CdSe core NCs of different sizes for growing the core–shell particles, a series of colloidal solutions emitting from blue to red with the emission band as narrow as 25–35 nm (FWHM) and room temperature PL quantum yield as high as 50–80% can be synthesized (Fig. 9).

 Fig. 9  Size-dependent change of the emission color of colloidal solutions of CdSe/ZnS core–shell nanocrystals. The particles with the smallest (∼1.7 nm) CdSe core emit blue, the particles with the largest (∼5 nm) core emit red (reproduced with permission from ref. 24, Copyright 2004 Wiley). 
Type II core–shell nanocrystals
A type II colloidal heterostructure consists of semiconductor materials where both the valence and conduction bands in the core are lower (or higher) than in the shell. As a result, one charge carrier is mostly confined to the core, and the other to the shell (Fig. 10). For CdTe/CdSe NCs, the hole wave function is predominantly located in CdTe core, and the electron wave function in the CdSe shell; for CdSe/ZnTe NCs the electron–hole localization is vice versa.160 Emission from type II CdTe/CdSe, or CdSe/ZnTe NCs originates from the radiative recombination of the electron–hole pairs across the core–shell interface, and the emission energy is determined by the corresponding band offset. As a result, typeII core–shell NCs emit at lower energies than corresponding core-only materials, covering the spectral range from 700 to 1000 nm depending on core size and shell thickness.160

Nanocrystals for near-IR applications
In contrast to the cadmium chalcogenide NCs absorbing and emitting in the visible spectral range, the fabrication of near-IR nanocrystalline materials has only relatively recently been explored.156,161–174 The use of IR emitting colloidal NCs for telecommunications has been the subject of several reviews.175,176 In what follows, we provide some examples of IV–VI and III–V IR active NCs; the interested reader is referred to a recent review for details.177
PbS and PbSe nanocrystals
PbS178,179 and PbSe180 NCs are of great potential interest due to their bulk unique properties. Bulk PbS and PbSe materials have a cubic (rock salt) crystal structure, a narrow direct bandgap (0.28–0.41 eV at 300 K) and a large exciton Bohr radius (for PbSe 46 nm, about eight times larger than that of CdSe).167 As a result, size quantization effects are more pronounced in PbSe than in cadmium chalcogenides, and the value of the bandgap energy makes the PbSe nanocrystals interesting as emitters in the near-IR region.
Lead chalcogenide semiconductor NCs were first generated inside polymer and oxide glass hosts over a decade ago.180,181 A more versatile liquid-phase synthesis for PbSe colloidal NCs was first reported by Murray et al. in 2001.161 In the following year, the groups of Guyot-Sionnest164 and Krauss170 reported simultaneously similar methods to prepare PbSe NCs. Very small PbSe NCs (2–3 nm in diameter)162 as well as larger PbSe quantum wires, rods, and cubes163 have also been successfully synthesized. High quality PbSe NCs were synthesized from lead oleate and trioctylphosphine selenide in the diphenyl ether–TOP medium at 90–220 °C.161 The isolated monodisperse PbSe NC fractions sized from ∼3 nm to 15 nm exhibit a pronounced quantum size effect resulting in a shift of the first absorption maximum from ∼1200 nm for 3 nm particles to 2200 nm for 9 nm NCs. The best reported values for PL efficiency of PbSe nanocrystals were as high as ∼60%.182 The passivation of the PbSe NC surface via the epitaxial growth of a PbS shell resulted in an improvement of both PL efficiency and NC stability.162

          InP and InAs nanocrystals
A first step towards controllable synthesis of III–V NCs was made by Micic et al. who adapted the Well's dehalosylilation reaction for the synthesis of nanocrystalline InP colloids.183 Alivisatos et al. have extended this approach to InAs.184 The luminescence properties of as-prepared InP and InAs NCs are rather poor as compared to those of II–VI compounds. The growth of an epitaxial shell of a higher bandgap II–VI or III–V semiconductor on the core InAs NCs184 or photochemical etching of InP NCs185 increases their PL efficiency.
Semiconductor nanoparticles synthesized in aqueous medium
Various II–VI NCs have been prepared in aqueous solutions using different thiols as stabilizing agents: CdS,186CdSe,187CdTe,188CdxHg1−xTe,189 and HgTe.190 As in the non-aqueous syntheses mentioned above, the entire spectral range from 500 nm to 2000 nm is available by varying the size and composition of the nanoparticles. In particular, the luminescence spectra of HgTe NCs of different sizes cover the spectral region between 1000 and 1800 nm. The luminescence quantum yields of CdTe, CdxHg1−xTe and HgTe NCs as synthesized in water routinely reach values of up to 40–50%.173,188
Design of conjugated polymers used in organic–inorganic devices
The charge transport properties of NC-only films are poor,191 and it is difficult to achieve an electrical contact to single NCs because of their small size. Taking these aspects together, these particularities of NCs make them attractive materials for fabrication of hybrid semiconductor NC/organic devices as described below. The organic/inorganic compatibility depends on the versatile chemistry of the host polymer. Hence, the polymers are designed to attain both the optoelectronic properties desired for the specific application in mind, and chemical compatibility providing organic/inorganic homogeneous mixtures.
In analogy to the already very successful donor/acceptor approach for phosphorescent systems,14 wide bandgap semiconducting polymers are used as donor hosts for semiconductor NCs.61 In such blend systems, efficient energy transfer from host (polymer) to guest (NCs) takes place when the donor and acceptor moieties are in close spatial proximity and have a sufficient spectral overlap.181,192,193 Energy and charge transfer from the polymer to the NCs requires an energy band offset at the organic/inorganic interface. To date, conjugated polymer hosts used in hybrid device technology include mainly the commercially available p-type wide bandgap polymers. MEH-PPV is the most common polymer used as host in hybrid light-absorbing or -emitting devices.194–198 Some authors reported yellow-PPV,198 CN-PPV199,200 or methyl-substituted ladder-type poly(para-phenylene) (MeLPPP)201 as hosts (Fig. 11). Polyfluorene (PF) (n-type polymer),61 and several PF copolymers such as PF-co-PPV202 and 9,9-dialkylfluorene-benzothiadiazole (FxBT; x = 6 or 8)203,204 were also recently used as polymer matrices in hybrid LEDs (Fig. 11).

Hybrid solar cells comprise mainly MEH-PPV195,197,205,206 or p-type semiconducting polymers of the polythiophene family such as P3HT205,207,208 or poly(3-octyl-thiophene) (P3OT).209 A recent example of a red PF is also available.210

Mixing NCs into commercially available cationic PF-based polyelectrolytes (Fig. 12) resulted in improved NC stability, and reduced polymerinterchain interactions.204 These effects are both desirable in hybrid LEDs as they enhance the device stability and device efficiency by reducing non-radiative losses. A competitive approach to suppress polymer hostinterchain interaction is the introduction of linear84,85,211,212 and side-functional,87,213 or dendritic capping ligands.214–216 Blending the NCs with polymers was also shown to result in enhanced energy transfer from the polymer to the NCs.214 In Fig. 13, some of the end-group functionalized oligomers are shown.86,217

 Fig. 13  Structures of end-group functionalized oligomers: P3HT,86 OPPE(SH2)217 and PPV-SH87 as well as OPPV-PO.211 In the composites the endgroups are connected to NCs. 
In addition to the already shown polymer blends and surface functional oligomers, functionalized semiconducting polymers have also been designed in order to specifically modify the NCs.85 A direct method is shown in Fig. 14.

Another approach for polymers uses the side chains, introduced in thienyl monomers, in order to design materials that can be grafted onto the surface of CdTe NCs (Fig. 15).218

Therefore 2,5-dibromo-3-[(tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-ylidene)methyl]thiophene has been prepared and was subsequently copolymerized in a nickel-catalyzed C–C coupling procedure. The surface active side chains of the polymer were utilized in order to trap the NCs via a ligand-exchange reaction. Furthermore, thiophene dendrimers synthesized in a convergent approach were used in order to modify the NC surface with polymeric organic materials as shown in Fig. 16.215,216

Visible LEDs based on nanocrystal–organic compound composites
The first paper on hybrid NC/polymer LEDs from the Berkeley group appeared in 1994219 and reported on a bi-layer device comprising a thin (few tens of nm) layer of CdSe NCs deposited on a conducting support with the help of a bifunctional linker hexane dithiol, and a 100 nm thick layer of a soluble PPV derivative. The structure was sandwiched between an ITO-coated glass and an Mg/Ag electrode, which functioned as anode and cathode, respectively. The device with a hole transporting PPV layer close to the ITO, with electrons injected into a layer of NCs and holes injected into a layer of polymer (forward bias), exhibited an emission characteristic of the CdSe NCs at an operating voltage of only 4 V, with an EL band tunable from yellow to red by changing the NC size.
A subsequent paper from two MIT groups220 reported on a single-layer device where CdSe NCs were homogeneously distributed within a polymer layer (70–120 nm thick) of polyvinylcarbazole as a hole conducting component, which additionally contained an oxadiazole derivative (butyl-PBD) as an electron transporting molecular species. The resulting volume fraction of CdSe NCs in a film sandwiched between ITO and Al electrodes was 5–10%, below the percolation threshold for charge transport to occur between the NCs. The PL and EL spectra of the devices were reasonably narrow (<40 nm FWHM) and nearly identical, and were tunable from 530 to 650 nm by varying the NC size. Subsequent papers reported on bi-layer devices based on core–shell NCs221,222 and showed sufficient improvements over the core-only CdSe-based devices, namely a factor of 20 increase in efficiency and a factor of 100 in lifetime.
Tri-layer hybrid NC/organic molecule LEDs with a single monolayer of CdSe/ZnS NCs sandwiched between two organic thin films have been introduced recently by two MIT groups.223 In these devices the external quantum efficiency exceeded 0.4% for a broad range of luminance. At 125 mA cm−2, the brightness of the three layer device was 2000 cd m−2 (i.e. 1.6 cd A−1), which constitutes a 25-fold improvement over the best previously reported visible NC-based LEDs.221
The first hybrid NC-based LED made by layer-by-layer assembly was reported in ref. 224 It was built up from 20 alternating double layers of a precursor of PPV (pre-PPV) and CdSe NCs capped by thiolactic acid, followed by thermal conversion of pre-PPV to PPV. The device emitted white light originating mainly from recombination through NC trap sites, with a turn-on voltage of 3.5–5 V and an external quantum efficiency of 0.0015%.

        EL of different colors (from green to red) was obtained from layer-by-layer assembled LEDs based on thioglycolic acid capped CdTe NCs of different sizes and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA).225 In spite of the use of an insulating polymer, external quantum efficiencies of 0.1% were achieved. Light emission was observed at current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and at exceptionally low onset voltages of 2.5–3.5 V (i.e. only just above the bandgap of the CdTe NCs).
Near-infrared LEDs based on nanocrystal–polymer composites
Because of the limited choice of polymers and organic dyes emitting in the range of telecommunications windows (1.3 and 1.55 micron), the use of the near-infrared emitting NCs in hybrid organic–inorganic LEDs provides a particularly attractive alternative. The first paper on such LEDs appeared in 2002 and reported on single-layer blend devices.203 The devices showed broad emission in the range of 1.3 microns, which was attributed to the inhomogeneously broadened spectrum of the ensemble of differently sized NCs, with a rather high turn-on voltage of 15 V and a remarkably high external quantum efficiency reaching 0.5% at high operating voltages.203,226
In subsequent reports, EL spectra of single-layer devices based on mixtures of PbS NCs with MEH-PPV or poly(2-(6-cyano-6′-methylheptyloxy)-1,4-phenylene) (CN-PPP) were shown to be potentially tunable across the range of 1000 to 1600 nm.181,227,228 Internal quantum efficiencies of 1.9% could be achieved in such diodes with MEH-PPV and PbS nanocrystals.196 Other reports on HgTe201 or PbSe198 based LEDs showed relatively poor EL efficiency probably due to non matched properties of the NCs and the organic molecules/polymers hosting them.

Nanocrystal-based photovoltaic devices
Semiconductor NCs have recently been incorporated into conjugated polymers to create hybrid photovoltaic cells, aimed at achieving ease of processing, low cost, substrate flexibility, large area coverage and, from a longer term perspective, enhanced efficiency. A particular noteworthy example is the hybrid NC/polymer photovoltaic device consisting of a blend of CdSe nanorods (7 nm × 60 nm) with P3HT, which showed a solar conversion efficiency of 1.7% (under air mass (AM) 1.5 global solar conditions).30 The superior efficiency of this device over net-polymer-based ones arises from the fast charge separation at the NC/polymer interface and the enhanced electron transport in the structure due to the relatively high intrinsic carrier mobilities in inorganic semiconductor NCs. The performance of such cells assembled from solution can attain external quantum efficiencies of over 54% and a monochromatic power conversion efficiency of 6.9% (under 0.1 mW per square centimeter illumination at 515 nm) in optimized devices tuning the composite morphology by introducing large polymer/NC interfaces upon thermal treatment.229 End-functionalized polymers in the hybrid solar cells86 provided the power conversion efficiency (AM 1.5) of 1.5%, being attached to CdSe nanorods of about 7 nm in diameter and 30 nm in length.86
The first proof-of-principle photovoltaic device with dendritic structures built from thienyl moieties79,82,83,215,216 appeared and showed promise due to the favorable assembly behavior of the thienyl dendrons used.215 Simple, not yet optimized devices resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 0.29%. The importance of the morphology optimization in such devices in terms of creating large interfaces becomes furthermore apparent when looking at multi-armed CdS nanorods in MEH-PPV.230 After thermal treatment the reorganization of the inorganic NC/polymer interface leads to an increase of exciton dissociation efficiency in the system, providing photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies of up to 1.17% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2).
The use of metal–ligand complexes collecting the triplet excitons from the conjugated polymers was also found to enhance efficiencies in composite structures for solar cell applications.231 The system investigated was P3HT/CdSe doped with 10% of Ir(mppy)3. In such devices the short-circuit current was found to increase by 100% revealing a much increased population of triplet excitons.
A major drawback of the above mentioned devices utilizing cadmium chalcogenides is that both the NCs and the introduced polymers absorb light in the visible part of the solar spectrum (below 800 nm), leaving a considerable amount of near infrared solar energy (800–2800 nm) unused.
To generate photocurrent from low energy photons, narrow bandgap NCs have been used in NC/polymer composites to extend the photovoltaic response into the infrared.195 In this study, PbS NCs were incorporated in the polymer matrix of MEH-PPV, and NIR activity was demonstrated. Subsequently, a single and double layer structure based on PbS or PbSe NCs has been described and demonstrated spectral coverage up to ∼1600 nm and power efficiencies up to 0.14%.232 The reason for the relatively low efficiency at NIR wavelengths is directly related to the low absorption cross section of the NCs that becomes comparable to that of conjugated polymers only at about double or triple the energy of the NC bandgap.198 Furthermore, it has to be mentioned that the mobility of holes and electrons is equal in PbS NCs, which is different to typical electron acceptors such as fullerene or CdSe.233,234 Charge transport in semiconducting polymer/PbS composite structures is still a matter of active research.234 On the other hand, simply by changing the hole conductor from MEH-PPV to P3OT sufficient improvement in simple bilayer devices exceeding the external quantum efficiency of 1% has been achieved.209 This may be determined by rapid extraction of holes at the interface from the NCs into the surrounding polymer, which is due to the favorable alignment of the heterostructure band offsets between the polymer P3OT and the quantum-confined states of PbS NCs.209 Introducing octylamine ligands to the PbS NCs combined with the MEH-PPV hole transporting polymer may be another reason for the drastic improvement of these devices. PbS NCs used were either oleic acid or octylamine capped. The octylamine-capped NCs allowed over two orders of magnitude more photocurrent under −1 V bias; they also showed an infrared photovoltaic response, while devices using oleic acid-capped NCs did not. Further improvement in the photovoltaic performance of devices based on octylamine-capped PbS NCs occurred upon thermal annealing: This simple procedure led to a 200-fold increase in short circuit current, a 600-fold increase in maximum power output, and an order of magnitude faster response time.
These already very promising developments in hybrid photovoltaic devices become apparent in many patent applications filed recently.235–238 Novel approaches can further improve efficiencies by e.g. taking advantage of multiphoton excitation239,240 in composite NC-based systems.
Conclusions
Hybrid structures consisting of semiconducting polymers and strongly luminescent semiconductor NCs offer favorable perspectives through highly saturated tunable emission as well as tunable absorption features, which are of importance for several high-tech applications such as hybrid organic–inorganic light-emitting diodes and solar cells. The combination of organic and inorganic components in hybrid materials offers advantages that are not accessible with solely one of the materials classes. Hybrid structures created by combination of inorganic and organic components merge advantageous optical and conducting properties with robustness and flexibility. The field of research, highlighted with selected examples in this publication, will rapidly develop in the near future, ideally leading to a new generation of organic–inorganic LEDs and photovoltaic devices.

Elisabeth Holder	Elisabeth Holder studied chemistry at the Eberhard-Karls Universität in Tübingen, Germany and received her Ph.D. in 2001 in the laboratory of Prof. E. Lindner. Thereafter, she had the benefit of a postdoctoral stay in Baltimore, USA at the University of Maryland in the Center for Fluorescence Spectroscopy with Prof. J. R. Lakowicz. Subsequently, she pursued a postdoctoral stay at the Technischen Universiteit Eindhoven in the Netherlands in the laboratory of Prof. U. S. Schubert. Since April 2006 she has led the “Functional Polymers Group” at the University of Wuppertal in Germany and there she belongs also to the directorial board of the Institute of Polymer Technology. From 2006–2007 she was a visiting scientist at the Technischen Universiteit Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Her research interests are in the synthesis and characterization of new functional and macromolecular materials involving metal–ligand complexes, organic–inorganic hybrid materials and composites for applications in light-emitting devices, solar cells and sensors, with a focus on materials development for engineering energy and electron transfer processes.
Nir Tessler	Nir Tessler received his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. from the Electrical Engineering department at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. In 1995 he joined, as a postdoctoral fellow, Prof. Sir Richard Friend's group at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, UK and in 1996 he demonstrated the world's first optically pumped conjugated polymer laser. In 1999 he left his advanced EPSRC fellow position at the Cavendish to head the Organic Materials & Devices Laboratory at the Electrical Engineering Department, Technion, Haifa, Israel. He is a member of the Microelectronic and Nanoelectronic Centers as well as the Russel Berry Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion. His research interests are in the field of conducting, semiconducting and light emitting organic materials. This includes photophysical processes (including laser action and microcavities), transport of charges and of electron–hole pairs (executions), processing of devices and circuits (diodes, transistors, detectors), and also the combination between synthetic and natural (biological) polymers as a tool to extend the understanding and scope of each separate system. He is furthermore interested in new device structures and processing procedures.
Andrey L. Rogach	Andrey Rogach received his PhD in physical chemistry on synthesis and properties of silver nanoparticles in 1995 from the Belarusian State University in Minsk. From 1995 to 1996 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Hamburg (Germany) with Prof. H. Weller, where he also worked in 1997–2002 as a visiting scientist, Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellow, and finally as a staff scientist. Since 2002 he has been a senior staff scientist heading the Chemistry and Microstructuring Labs at the Photonics & Optoelectronics group of Prof. J. Feldmann at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in Munich, Germany. He is a member of the Center for NanoScience (CeNS) and a Principal Investigator of the Excellence Cluster “Nanosystems Initiative Munich” at the LMU. He was holder of the Walton Award of the Science Foundation Ireland at Trinity College Dublin (Ireland) in 2005–2006. His research interests are in the areas of chemistry and physics of nanometer-sized materials, with an emphasis on the synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, spectroscopy and applications of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. His recent research activities address the formation of hybrid nanocrystal structures, energy transfer in composite nanocrystal-based systems, nanocrystals for photovoltaics, and the use of water-soluble semiconductor nanocrystals as luminescent markers in biological systems.
