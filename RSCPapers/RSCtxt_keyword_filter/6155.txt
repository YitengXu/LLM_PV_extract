    , Accepted 11th December 2021First published on 27th December 2021AbstractLiterature studies on the effects of alkyne functionality in manipulating the optical properties of donor-π-acceptor-type molecular scaffolds have been scarce compared to those on the alkene functional group. Here, two structurally isomeric donor–acceptor (D–A) dyes were synthesized to study the positional effect of alkyne functionality (triple bond) on their optical, electrochemical and charge generation properties in order to design efficient dyes for possible application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These dyes, named CAPC and PACC, contain carbazole and cyanoacrylic acid as the donor and acceptor units, respectively, and the π-conjugation length within the molecules was controlled by the introduction of an alkyne group. The D-π-A design was followed in designing CAPC with the alkyne serving as the π-spacer, while in PACC, alkyne was placed on the donor, which was directly in conjugation with the acceptor. This rendered equal conjugation lengths within the designed dyes. With the help of photophysical characterizations, it was concluded that CAPC featured better characteristics for a DSSC dye than PACC. Our conclusions were further supported by the results of transient absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical analysis, fluorescence lifetime studies and density functional theory.
Introduction
Among the organic small molecule scaffolds, the donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) systems have received tremendous attention from the scientific and industrial communities largely due to their well-proven potential for optoelectronic device applications.1–4 One area in which D-π-A systems have been immensely explored is dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).5–8 Over the last two decades, DSSCs have also captured the interest of green energy scientists as a means of cost-effective solar energy conversion.9–11 Since the pioneering work of Grätzel and co-workers, extensive endeavors have been made to increase the power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs.12–14 Mathew et al. achieved a record breaking power conversion efficiency of 13% utilizing a porphyrin-based system and N3 dye.15 Very recently, Zhang et al. also achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 13.6% through D-π-A molecular design.16 In DSSCs, the electron is injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor from the photoexcited dye.17 The power conversion efficiency of DSSCs depends on the efficiency of electron injection from the dye and the reverse electron transfer from the semiconductor. Interfacial electron transfer dynamics have been widely investigated in various dye–semiconductor systems.1,5,18–22 Vast knowledge has been extracted about the physics of electron injection and charge recombination by focusing research on both organic and inorganic dye/TiO2 heterojunctions.1,17 Literature reports evidence that inorganic complex-based (Ru(II)-based polypyridyl complexes) solar cells always show higher power conversion efficiency compared to organic material-based solar cells due to a lower rate of reverse electron transfer.15,23–25 However, the high cost, low synthetic yields and concerning environmental hazards have restrained the bulk use of these metal-containing dyes in solar cells. Organic dyes have been able to attract much attention owing to their economic viability, higher molar extinction coefficient, vast library of organic dye designs and facile synthesis processes with high yields.26–30 Donor-π-acceptor-based (D-π-A) molecular designs of organic dyes provide an electron-rich aromatic architecture, along with suitable intramolecular charge transfer transitions which enhance photo-absorption, photoelectron generation and electron injection into the metal anode.31,32
The chemical structures of dyes play an important role in tuning the dye performance in terms of efficiency.11,33–39 Hence, studying the impact of chemical functionalities and their position in the designed molecular backbone on the efficiency of DSSC devices is an active field of research seeking to understand the fundamental aspects of structural requirements.2,7,40–42 It has been reported by several research groups through structure–property relationship studies that the photophysical properties of a molecular scaffold can be altered through rational structural engineering for the benefit of device efficiency.43–45 In this regard, a small change in functional group position in a set of isomers often substantially affects the optical properties of molecular dyes.44,46 Among various structural engineering studies, the impact of alkene functionality on the tunable π-conjugation of a molecular scaffold, including the length of π-conjugation, has been well documented in literature.47–49 In this particular aspect, the donor-π-acceptor system has been the choice of chemical architecture for studying the effect of alkene functionality-driven tunable π-conjugation.50–52 Although the effect of the alkene unit in tuning the photo-physical properties of a donor-π-acceptor-type molecular scaffold has been well investigated,34,53 the impact of the position of an alkyne unit within the molecular system has not been well explored.47,48,54
In this article, we discuss our recent experimental observations on the impact of the position of alkyne functionality of a donor-π-acceptor system on its photophysical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the optical properties of alkyne-based D–A designs have been studied and the impact of the positional effect of the alkyne unit assessed. To complete our study, we rationally designed and synthesized a set of two structural isomers in which the alkyne unit is placed at different locations in the molecular scaffold (Fig. 1). The alkyne unit connects the donor and acceptor units (as a π-spacer) in compound CAPC and is placed on the donor unit in PACC. The lengths of the molecular backbone in both compounds are equal. Various steady state and time resolved spectroscopic techniques were used to understand the photophysics of these systems and to advance dye-designing strategies involving an alkyne/triple bond. Our results established that CAPC with a triple bond as the π-spacer might be a better dye than PACC for DSSCs owing to its enhanced optical absorption, faster charge separation and slower charge recombination properties.

Results and discussion
To study the impact of the position of the triple bond in the molecular design on optoelectronic properties, we designed two isomeric compounds (CAPC and PACC, Fig. 1) which differ in the position of the triple bond unit in their designs. The molecular architecture of CAPC, one of the isomeric compounds, follows a D–π–A design, while in PACC, the triple bond containing unit (phenylacetylene) was present as a substituent on the donor and the design thus could be referred to as a donor–acceptor (D–A) type. The detailed synthesis protocols to obtain CAPC and PACC are shown in Scheme 1. In short, CAPC was synthesized in 2 steps, starting from N-hexyl-3-iodocarbazole (2) which was synthesized by N-alkylation of 3-iodocarbazole (1). The π-spacer unit (4-ethynylbenzaldehyde, 5) was incorporated into 2 using Sonogashira coupling to give 6 which was subjected to Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to give CAPC. On the other hand, 2 was subjected to formylation followed by Sonogashira coupling to give 8 which finally gave PACC after condensation with cyanoacetic acid. The triple bond containing compound 5 was synthesized using ethynylation of 4-bromobenzaldehyde with ethynyltrimethylsilane under Sonogashira coupling followed by removal of the trimethylsilane group under basic condition. The structural integrities of CAPC and PACC were confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C) and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). The complete details of synthetic procedures and characterization data are provided in the ESI†.

The optical properties of these dyes (CAPC and PACC) were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. In pure dichloromethane solvent, both dyes exhibited absorption maxima (λmax) in the visible region with peaks around 402 nm and 396 nm for CAPC and PACC, respectively (Fig. 2). The absorption onsets were calculated to be 461 nm and 443 nm, which provide optical gaps of 2.69 eV and 2.80 eV for CAPC and PACC, respectively. The absorption profiles for CAPC compared to PACC indicated that the triple bond facilitated better absorption of light when present as a π-spacer between the donor and acceptor units. This could be due to the planarity induced by the triple bond spacer between the donor and acceptor which essentially strengthens the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions in the molecule.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of synthesized compounds (a) CAPC and (b) PACC in DCM solution (5 μM, black line) and on TiO2 film (red line). CAPC–T and PACC–T represent dye adsorbed TiO2 films. 
The high molar absorption coefficient for CAPC (ε = 31353 M−1cm−1) compared to that for PACC (ε = 23458 M−1cm−1) also supported the presence of efficient ICT transitions in CAPC which is highly suitable for DSSC applications. Further, the absorptions of both compounds were compared with those of their thin films on TiO2 substrate (CAPC–T and PACC–T; T = TiO2-coated quartz). When the dye molecules were adsorbed onto the nano-crystalline TiO2 surface, bathochromic shifts of 11 and 17 nm from their solution state absorption were observed for the peak absorptions of CAPC and PACC, respectively, (Fig. 2). Although the absorption maxima were bathochromically shifted for the dyes compared to their absorption in dichloromethane (DCM), the absorption profiles were broad and tailed up to 700 nm (Fig. 2). This signified the existence of charge transfer into the conduction band of TiO2 through the interaction of the carboxyl functionality with TiO2.34,55,56 The bathochromic shift in UV-vis absorption on TiO2 might be accredited to the J-aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.34,56
Further, the UV-vis absorption spectra were collected in various solvents to assess the effect of solvent polarity on the absorption behavior of the compounds (Fig. S1, ESI†). In general, both compounds showed negative solvatochromism; however, the highest blue shifts in absorption were observed for DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) solution compared to DCM solution. The observed blue shifts were 32 and 46 nm for CAPC and PACC compounds, respectively. This could be attributed to the basic nature of DMF resulting in the deprotonation of the acid group (COOH) and leading to the formation of carboxylate anion.34
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded for DCM solutions of dyes and it was observed that CAPC showed a broad peak with a maximum around 590 nm while PACC showed weak and structured emission around 435 nm with a shoulder peak at 455 nm. The large Stokes shift for CAPC could be attributed to its efficient intramolecular charge transfer process. To assess the effect of solvent polarity, the PL was also studied in various solvents (Fig. S2, ESI†). CAPC showed negative solvatochromic behavior with the increase in solvent polarity from DCM (590 nm), THF (565 nm), ACN (539 nm) to DMF (514 nm), while the emission maximum in DMSO solution was observed at 527 nm. The observed blue shift in PL is similar to that observed in the UV-vis absorption profiles due to the formation of an anionic compound.34,55–57
The electrochemical properties of the CAPC and PACC dyes were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3) and the corresponding ionization potential (Ip) and electron affinity (Ea) values were calculated. Under the applied potential window, the CV curves showed quasi-reversible oxidation peaks for both compounds. The oxidation onset potentials for CAPC and PACC are 1.15 V and 1.27 V which yielded Ip= 5.7 eV and 5.62 eV, respectively.58 The electron affinity Ea was assessed after subtracting the fundamental gap Ef (= optical gap (Eo) + exciton binding energy (Be)) from Ip (see ESI† for more details).59 Thus, the obtained Ea values are 2.28 eV and 2.05 eV for CAPC and PACC, respectively.

To get insight into the geometry and electronic structure of the synthesized molecules, geometry optimization and molecular orbital calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT).60 In the absence of crystal structures for both dyes, the structural aspects were explored using the optimized geometries and both molecules showed planar configurations. As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMO of CAPC was distributed along the molecular backbone from the carbazole unit to the phenylacetylene and to a small extent on the acceptor unit, but its LUMO was mainly centered at the phenylacetylene–cyanoacrylic acid unit. The LUMO electron density is sufficiently increased on the cyanoacrylic acid group due to the electron accepting nature of this group. Further, the localization of LUMO electron density on the cyanoacrylic acid unit could be beneficial for efficient electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 layer. Similarly, the HOMO of PACC is distributed along the phenylacetylene–carbazole units, while its LUMO is mainly concentrated over the cyanoacrylic acid unit (Fig. 4). For deeper insight into the charge transfer from dye to TiO2, the ionization potential (Ip) and electron affinity (Ea) were also computed. The calculated IP values were 5.43 eV and 5.56 eV for CAPC and PACC, respectively, while those for Ea were 2.68 eV and 2.41 eV. The lower Ip of the dye is accredited to its higher electron-donating ability, whereas the higher Ea reflects the better electron injection capability of the dye.61CAPC had a lower IP than PACC and, thus, the release of electrons and creation of holes are much easier in the former than the latter. Similarly, the higher Ea value of CAPC indicates the possibility of easy electron injection from CAPC to TiO2.

The lifetime of a DSSC device depends on the thermal stability of its active material. Therefore, dyes used in DSSC should possess high thermal stability. To investigate the thermal stability of our compounds, TGA experiments were carried out (Fig. S3, ESI†). The extrapolated onset temperatures are considered to be the decomposition temperatures of the materials. CAPC and PACC exhibit decomposition temperatures (corresponding to a 5% weight loss) of 297.3 °C and 271.6 °C respectively. Because of such high decomposition temperatures, the synthesized molecules could be potential candidates for thermally stable DSSCs.
To understand the possible charge transfer from the excited state dye to TiO2 NPs, fluorescence measurements were carried out in the presence and absence of TiO2. Fig. 5(a) shows the fluorescence spectra of CAPC in the absence and presence of TiO2 NPs in which the fluorescence intensity of CAPC decreased on TiO2 NPs. Similar quenching of fluorescence was also observed for PACC on TiO2 (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The observed quenching of fluorescence emission could be due to the photoinduced transfer of electrons from the dye to TiO2.62 To further investigate the photophysics behind this charge transfer interaction between the dye and TiO2, time resolved fluorescence measurements (Fig. 5b and Fig. S4b, ESI†) were carried out. The fluorescence decay traces of both the dye films and the dye–TiO2 films were fitted using triexponential functions. The fluorescence lifetime components obtained from the fitting are given in Table 1. The average lifetime was determined from the relation (1)where fi indicates the contribution of the ith component and τi the fluorescence lifetime.

The average fluorescence lifetime of CAPC was found to be 2.6 ns and decreased drastically to 0.72 ns in the presence of TiO2 NPs (CAPC–T). The decay of both emission intensity and lifetime suggests that the excitons were transferred immediately into the TiO2 layer. The emission decay profiles were also recorded for PACC and its TiO2 film (Table 1) and confirmed the decrease in fluorescence lifetime from 2.75 ns (only PACC) to 0.88 ns (for PACC–T). The emission of the dye could be quenched either by energy transfer or photoinduced electron transfer. The energy level diagram (Fig. 5(c)) demonstrates that the LUMO level (LUMO = −Ea) of CAPC lies above the conduction band of TiO2 NPs. Therefore, the most likely reason for the observed fluorescence quenching is electron transfer from the excited dye to TiO2 NPs. Both CAPC–T and PACC–T possess the energy level alignment of a type II semiconductor heterojunction (Fig. 5(c) and Fig. S4(c), ESI†) which beneficially forces the electrons generated after the photoexcitation of dyes to transfer into the underlying TiO2 film by separating them from the dye cations.
The possibility of electron injection from the dye molecules to TiO2 NPs was predicted by computing the Gibb's free energy change of electron transfer (ET) reactions (ΔGinject). The free energy for injection can be estimated as the difference between the reduction potential of the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 and the oxidation potential of the excited state of the dye (Edye*), i.e., ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB,63 where Edye* is calculated by subtracting the vertical transition energy (λmax) from the redox potential of the ground state of the dye (Edye), i.e., Edye* = Edye − λmax. According to Koopmans' theorem, the ionization potential (IP) is equal to the negative of the valance band energy (ECB) of the TiO2 which is 4.2 eV.64 The estimated values of ΔGinject for the different dyes are listed in Table 2. The negative values of ΔGinject suggest that electron transfer from both dyes to TiO2 NPs is energetically favorable from the thermodynamic point of view.

Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for the investigation of the dynamics of electron injection and recombination, particularly for dye-sensitized semiconductor systems.65 TA spectra of CAPC dye were measured in the 400–700 nm region after excitation with 360 nm light. The TA spectra of CAPC at different pump–probe time delays are shown in Fig. 6(a). CAPC dye on quartz substrate exhibits two absorption bands: a negative absorption band at 480 nm and a positive absorption peak at 540 nm. The steady state absorption spectrum of this dye is extended to 550 nm. Therefore, the negative band in the TA spectra could be assigned to ground state bleaching (GSB). The positive absorption band in the TA spectra arises due to excited state absorption (ESA). Hence, the positive band with a peak at 540 nm could be attributed to excited state absorption of CAPC. The presence of an isosbestic point in the TA spectra further supports that the positive band is due to the excited state of the dye. Next, we did a global and target analysis of the TA spectra of CAPC (Fig. 6(a)) and the species associated difference spectra (SADS) are shown in Fig. 6(b). The estimated population time profiles of each state are presented in Fig. S5(a) (ESI†). SADS1 could be assigned to the vibrationally hot excited state of CAPC with a positive peak at 545 nm and a negative peak at 480 nm. SADS2 represents the thermally relaxed excited state of CAPC with a relatively narrow and blue shifted positive peak at 540 nm. SADS2 decays to the ground state of CAPC and the lifetime of this state is 120 ps. SADS3 corresponds to the residual relaxed excited state of CAPC after 550 ps. On the other hand, the TA spectra of CAPC–T (Fig. 6(c)) exhibit two absorption bands: a negative absorption in the 375–485 nm wavelength range with a peak at 425 nm suggesting the occurrence of an S0 → S1 transition and a positive absorption band in the 485–680 nm wavelength range with band maxima at 530 nm. Interestingly, no isosbestic point is present, which suggests that the positive band may not be due to excited state absorption of the dye. Nonetheless, the decay of the positive band is much slower in CAPC–T than in the dye only. Three states sequential target analysis of the TA spectra of CAPC–T yielded three SADSs (Fig. 6(d)) and population profiles of the respective states (Fig. S5(b), ESI†). SADS1 can be attributed to the hot excited state of CAPC with ESA at 535 nm and GSB at 420 nm. The lifetime of SADS1 is 1 ps and, hence, SADS2 represents the relaxed excited state of CAPC. SADS2 decays to SADS3 with a time constant of 170 ps. It should be noted that while SADS2 is almost decayed within 550 ps for CAPC, it decays a relatively small amount in CAPC–T. Moreover, the lifetime of SADS2 in CAPC–T is greater than in CAPC. Therefore, SADS3 could be associated with the long-lived charge species generated due to electron transfer from the excited dye to TiO2 NPs. However, we cannot present a complete time evolution of the charge species from the spectral data because we recorded TA spectra only up to 550 ps.

Further, we measured the TA spectra of CAPC–T under 360 nm excitation in the 475–780 nm wavelength region. In addition to the positive peak at 530 nm, another broad positive absorption band is apparent at 750 nm in the TA spectra depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†). According to previous reports, the positive absorption bands in this wavelength region could be due to excited state absorption of the dye or dye cation or electron in the conduction band of TiO2.66,67
We measured the TA kinetics of CAPC dye and CAPC–T at different probe wavelengths. Fig. 7(a) shows the comparison of TA kinetics measured at 530 nm for CAPC and CAPC–T. There is no change in the decay kinetics of the dye in the presence of TiO2, suggesting that this band at 530 nm is dominated by excited state absorption of the dye. The normalized TA kinetics at 725 nm for CAPC and CAPC–T are shown in Fig. 7(b). The rise kinetics are the same, but the decay kinetics differ after 1 ps. It is observed from Fig. 7(b) that the TA kinetics of CAPC–T decay more slowly than those of CAPC. Therefore, the origin of the positive signal is different for CAPC–T. In order to discover the origin of the positive bands in CAPC–T, we calculated the absorption spectrum of the cation of CAPC using TD-DFT. Our simulated absorption spectrum of the CAPC cation (CAPC+) shows a band at 740 nm (Fig. S8(a), ESI†). Based on our theoretical calculations, the 750 nm band of CAPC–T is assigned to the absorption of the dye cation.

Similarly, the TA spectra of PACC–T were measured up to 780 nm at different time delays and are shown in Fig. 8a. PACC–T exhibits a positive absorption band in the 480–780 nm wavelength range with peaks at 525 and 750 nm. Like CAPC-T, the positive band at 525 nm in the TA spectra of PACC-T is dominated by excited state absorption of the dye. Fig. 8(b) depicts the normalized TA kinetics for PACC and PACC–T measured at 725 nm. While the TA kinetics of the PACC dye decay to zero within 9 ns after photoexcitation, the TA signal for PACC–T only halves within the same time. The reason for the longer survival of the TA signal for PACC–T at 725 nm could be photoinduced electron transfer from the dye to TiO2, forming a dye cation and free electron in TiO2.

Further, we simulated the absorption spectrum of PACC dye cation using TD-DFT. The spectrum consisted of a peak at 725 nm (Fig. S8(b), ESI†). Thus, we assigned the positive peak around 750 nm in the TA spectrum of PACC–T to the cation of the dye PACC. The prominent signature of dye cations in dye–TiO2 films reveals that photoexcited electron transfer takes place from the dye (CAPC or PACC) to TiO2 NPs, suggesting that the synthesized dyes could be used as sensitizers for TiO2-based DSSCs.
We compared the TA kinetics corresponding to dye cations for CAPC–T and PACC–T (Fig. S7, ESI†). The faster decay of the TA signal suggests that photoinduced charges survive longer in CAPC–T than in PACC–T. We fitted the TA kinetics with triexponential functions and the results are presented in Table 3. As the TA signals are not entirely from charged species, it is difficult to determine unique times for the recombination of charges. However, the long decay component of TA signals could be assigned to charge recombination time. It is clear from Table 3 that the recombination times for charges are 1.5 ns and 766 ps in CAPC–T and PACC–T, respectively. With a longer charge recombination time, carrier loss via recombination is highly reduced which is beneficial for DSSCs applications. Therefore, of the two synthesized dyes, CAPC dye is better for DSSCs applications.

Conclusions
We report our recent study on the effect of alkyne functionality (triple bond) on the optoelectronic properties of light absorbing dye molecules. Two structurally isomeric triple bond rigidified dyes, CAPC (D-spacer-A) and PACC (spacer-D-A), having similar conjugation lengths along the molecular backbone except for the varied position of alkyne function, were designed and synthesized. It was found that the molecules having a D-spacer-A configuration showed an enhanced optical cross section for visible light absorption and molar absorptivity compared to those with the spacer-D–A design. The electrochemical and theoretical studies signified a favorable band position to facilitate easy electron injection from the synthesized dye molecules to a TiO2 anode. While time resolved fluorescence measurements reveal electron injection from the excited dyes to TiO2 NPs, transient absorption studies suggest relatively long back electron transfer time in PACC dye. Our results revealed that while designing alkyne-based D-π-A systems, it is possibly more beneficial to use an alkyne functional group as a linker to connect donor and acceptor rather than placing it on the donor. This study suggests that the triple bond/alkyne functionality could be beneficial in designing dyes for DSSC applications.
