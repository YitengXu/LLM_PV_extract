    , Accepted 17th November 2014First published on 21st November 2014AbstractThe electronic and optoelectronic properties of tin selenide nanostructures are of great interest for application in energy conversion and storage devices. Despite the great progress achieved in nanoparticle synthesis, controlling the crystal phase in tin selenide nanostructures remains a challenge. In this article, we present a simple solvothermal approach for the phase controlled synthesis of SnSe and SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures (HNs) for the first time. SnSe HNs have been prepared by reacting SnCl4 and SeO2 under solvothermal conditions using oleylamine as solvent. By adding a calculated amount of 1-dodecanethiol (1-DDT) to the reaction mixture the crystal phase can be tuned from SnSe to SnSe2. The obtained HNs were composed of single crystalline thin nanosheets with thickness in the range of 7–12 nm. A possible mechanism has been proposed for the phase controlled synthesis of tin selenides. The obtained SnSe and SnSe2 HNs showed good electrocatalytic activity in the redox reaction of the I−/I3− shuttle. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) employing SnSe and SnSe2 HNs as counter electrodes showed photovoltaic performances similar to the device made with a conventional platinum (Pt) counter electrode.
1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, nanostructures of semiconductor chalcogenides have been extensively studied, because of their potential application in optoelectronic devices.1–3 In the case of IV–VI chalcogenides, most of the studies have focused on PbS and PbSe nanocrystals since their band gaps can be tuned across the infrared and visible spectrum by varying the nanocrystal size.4–6 On the other hand, relatively less attention has been paid to the synthesis and studies of tin based chalcogenides such as SnS, SnSe and SnTe. Amongst tin chalcogenides, tin selenides are important narrow band gap IV–VI semiconductors having a wide range of applications such as solar cells, supercapacitors, infrared optoelectronic devices, memory switching devices and anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.7–12 Tin selenide materials exist in two stoichiometric phases in the form of tin monoselenide (SnSe) and tin diselenide (SnSe2). SnSe is a p-type semiconductor with a narrow band gap (~0.90 eV indirect and ~1.30 eV direct), which adopts features of an orthorhombic layered structure that facilitates two-dimensional growth.13 However, SnSe2 is an n-type semiconductor which has a layered CdI2-type structure, in which each layer of Sn atoms is sandwiched between two layers of hexagonally close-packed Se atoms, and the adjacent selenium layers are connected by weak van der Waals interaction.
Recently, several research groups have reported the colloidal synthesis of tin selenide nanomaterials of diverse sizes and shapes such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, and nanocolumns.14–18 Most of the synthetic methods involve the use of trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) as a selenium source. However, phosphines are expensive, toxic and highly sensitive to air. In addition, controlling the composition or phase of the final tin selenide has been a big task, since the Sn2+ in the precursor is often oxidised to Sn4+ and results in a final composition of SnSe2 instead of SnSe.12 Jang et al. proposed a solution to control the phase by synthesizing a single source precursor containing Sn and Se atoms and decomposing in oleylamine.18 Although this method was successful, the synthesis of the precursor is more laborious and needs dry reaction conditions. Besides the phase controlled synthesis, shape controlled nanomaterials synthesis is another important aspect due to the fact that many physical properties of nanomaterials are highly shape dependent. In recent years, hierarchical nanostructures consisting of interconnected small nanoscale building blocks such as nanorods or nanosheets have received great research interest. Hierarchical nanostructures can provide high surface areas and good particle stabilities as well as better carrier transport capability.19,20 Hierarchical nanostructures have shown improved performance in various devices. In particular, when used in counter electrodes of DSSC, hierarchical nanostructures exhibited higher efficiencies than nanoparticle counter electrodes.21–23 Thus, developing simple and facile synthetic approaches that yield tin selenide nanostructures with precise control over the chemical composition and shape is highly desirable for both fundamental studies and practical applications.
Here, we report a facile solution method for the phase-controlled synthesis of 3D hierarchical tin selenide nanostructures that are assembled by thin single-crystal nanosheets. The synthetic method involves the solvothermal reaction between SnCl4·5H2O and SeO2 in oleylamine using 1-dodecanethiol as surfactant. The salient features of our synthetic method are as follows: (1) toxic, expensive and air-sensitive precursors such as bis-(trimethylsilyl)selenide and TOPSe have been replaced with inexpensive and air-stable SeO2. (2) Phase pure SnSe or SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures can be synthesized by controlling the reaction parameters. (3) Nanosheet thickness in SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures can be tuned by using selective surfactants. To the best of our knowledge this the first report on phase controlled synthesis of 3D hierarchical tin selenide nanostructures. The possible application of tin selenides as prominent alternatives to platinum free counter electrodes in DSSC has been demonstrated for the first time. The DSSC device with a SnSe2 HN counter electrode exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 5.60% comparable to that of the device using a Pt counter electrode (5.74%).
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of SnSe hierarchical nanostructures
In a typical synthesis, 0.2 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O, and 0.2 mmol of SeO2 were added to 17 mL of oleylamine in a clean 50 mL flask at room temperature followed by heating at 70 °C for 30 min to get a transparent solution. Then, the obtained transparent solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon lined autoclave and heated to 180 °C for 24 h in an electric oven. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the supernatant was decanted, and the resulting precipitate was washed with a toluene and ethanol mixture (1:2) three times, and dried under vacuum.
2.2. Synthesis of SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures
200 μL of 1-dodecanethiol was added to 17 mL of oleylamine followed by the addition of 0.2 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O, and 0.2 mmol of SeO2. The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 30 min and clear yellow colour solution was obtained. The obtained mixture was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon lined autoclave and heated to 180 °C for 36 h in an electric oven. When the reaction was finished, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the supernatant was decanted, and the resulting precipitate was washed with a toluene and ethanol mixture (1:2) three times, and dried under vacuum.
2.3. Fabrication of CEs and DSSCs
The reference Pt CE was prepared by deposition of 50 μL of H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution (3 mM) on FTO glass followed by 500 °C heat treatment for 30 min in air. SnSe and SnSe2 CEs were prepared by deposition of 50 μL toluene dispersions (10 mg mL−1) on the FTO glass followed by 500 °C heat treatment for 30 min in N2 atmosphere.
TiO2 paste was prepared according to reported literature procedures.24 TiO2 paste was coated on conducting glass with a F:SnO2 film (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1, Aldrich) using a doctor-blade printing technique. After printing, the electrode was dried at 70 °C and then was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. After sintering at 450 °C, the TiO2 films were treated with 40 mM TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into a dye solution (N719, Solaronix, 0.5 mM in ethanol), and kept at room temperature for 21 h. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and counter electrode were stacked and sealed with a sealant (Surlyn, 60 mm-thick, Meltonix) at 100 °C for 15 s. The electrolyte solution with a composition of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.05 M LiI in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85/15, v/v) was injected into the cell through a hole and end sealed.
2.4. Characterization
The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex II), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800 UHR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Multilab ESCA 2000). Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-3600 Shimadzu UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution were determined using an ASAP-2420 accelerated surface area and porosimetry system (Micromeritics, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 by using a BAS100 B/W electrochemical analyzer. Platinum served as a CE and the Ag/Ag+ couple was used as a reference electrode. Solar energy conversion efficiency was measured using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A Solar Simulator, 94063A, Newport Stratford Inc.) under a simulated standard solar light, i.e., 100 mW cm−2; AM1.5G checked with an NREL-calibrated Si-solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of SnSe hierarchical nanostructures
The crystallinity and crystal phases of the SnSe HNs were characterized by X-ray diffraction studies. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared SnSe HNs. All of the observed diffraction peaks can be indexed to orthorhombic-phase SnSe (JCPDS no. 89-0236, Pnma). No other additional phases were observed, which further confirms the purity of the SnSe nanostructures. The oxidation states of Sn and Se in SnSe HNs were investigated by XPS. The Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 orbital peaks were observed at 494.1 and 485.7 eV, respectively, and the Se 3d peak was located at 53.5 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†). This confirms the +2 and −2 valence states for Sn and Se in SnSe HNs.18 The purity of the SnSe HNs was further confirmed by EDS analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†). The observed Sn/Se ratio of 1:1 is in accordance with the stoichiometry of SnSe.

The morphologies of the SnSe were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, b, the prepared SnSe possesses hierarchical flower-shaped morphologies. The SnSe hierarchical nanostructures were nearly uniform in size with an average diameter of 1.5–2 μm. Interestingly, it was observed that the flower-like nanostructures are composed of individual thin nanosheets as “petals” connected to a central core. The TEM image in Fig. 2c is in full consistency with the FESEM observations in terms of shape and size of the nanostructures. The thickness of an individual nanosheet was found to be 12 nm (Fig. 2d). The HRTEM analysis (inset in Fig. 2d) shows clear lattice fringes and the calculated interplanar distance between the two adjacent lattice planes was 0.302 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of the orthorhombic phase SnSe.

In order to study the formation process of SnSe hierarchical nanostructures, time dependent experiments were carried out. XRD patterns of the SnSe nanostructures at different reaction times are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All of the XRD patterns matched well with orthorhombic phase SnSe. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of SnSe HNs synthesized at different reaction times. When the reaction time was less than 12 h, no solid products were obtained and the reaction mixture was turbid yellow in colour. After 12 h of reaction time, sheet-like SnSe forms as a general morphology due to its layered structure. The formation of nanosheets can be explained by a nanoparticle aggregation mechanism which is well studied.16 In the earlier stage of the reaction, individual nanoparticle seeds are formed and as the reaction time increases these nanoparticles start to coalesce and form the initial nanosheet structure. Besides acting as a reducing agent, oleylamine could coordinate to the Sn2+ ions to form complexes in solution, which decreases the free Sn2+ concentration in solution and results in the slow generation of SnSe nanoparticle seeds. These nanoparticle seeds are assembled on the surface of the preformed nanosheets and coalesce to increase the number of nanosheet layers. When the reaction time was increased to 15 h, flower-like morphology begins to emerge, as the nanosheet “petals” protrude from the nanosheet assemblies. With the increasing reaction time, the Ostwald ripening process occurs, the crystal core with a higher density dissolves and transfers to the outer nanosheets with a lower density by a dissolution–recrystallization process, and these nanosheets continue to grow in size to become the final flower-like petals.

3.2. Synthesis of SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures
SnSe2 HNs can be readily obtained by adding a certain amount of 1-dodecanethiol to the reaction system used for SnSe HNs. Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern of the products obtained with different amounts of 1-DDT at 180 °C for 36 h. When 50 or 100 μL of 1-DDT was added, the obtained products were a mixture of orthorhombic SnSe and hexagonal SnSe2. Phase pure hexagonal SnSe2 HNs were obtained when 200 μL of 1-DDT was added to the reaction mixture. In addition, XPS spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†) showed Sn 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 orbital peaks at 495.8 and 487.5 eV, respectively, and a Se 3d orbital peak at 54.9 eV, which further confirms the formation of pure hexagonal SnSe2.17 The chemical stoichiometry of the obtained SnSe2 HNs was investigated by EDS analysis. EDS spectra in Fig. S5 (ESI†) show a measured Sn/Se ratio of 1:2.1 which agrees well with the stoichiometry of SnSe2.
 Fig. 4  (a, b) XRD patterns of the products obtained with different amounts of 1-DDT. 
As can be seen from the FESEM images shown in Fig. 5, both mixed phase SnSe–SnSe2 and pure SnSe2 have hierarchical flower-like morphologies. This is similar to the results obtained for SnSe nanostructures. The average size of the SnSe2 HNs was 3–4 μm (Fig. 5c, d), which is two times larger than the SnSe nanostructures. It is interesting to observe that the added 1-DDT only influenced the crystal phase of the tin selenides and did not have any significant effect on the morphologies of the products.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of the products obtained with different amounts of 1-DDT: (a) 50, (b) 100, and (c, d) 200 μL. 

Fig. 6 shows the TEM characterization of the SnSe2 hierarchical nanostructures. Flower-like morphology of SnSe2 nanostructures can be clearly seen in Fig. 6a, and the thickness of the constituting nanosheets was about 7–10 nm (Fig. 6b and Fig. S6 (ESI†)). Fig. 6c shows the TEM image of a single nanosheet. The nanosheet is hexagonal in shape and has a diameter of about 1 μm. In HRTEM analysis on the single nanosheets (Fig. 6d), the (100) set of planes with a 0.330 nm interplanar distance was predominantly observed. In addition, the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) shows the spot pattern consistent with the single crystal nature of the nanosheet (inset in Fig. 6d).

On the basis of the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for the formation of phase controlled tin selenide HNs can be proposed. Fig. 7 shows the schematic for the formation of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs. Before transferring to the autoclave, the reaction mixture was heated at 70 °C for 30 min to completely dissolve SnCl4 and SeO2 in oleylamine. In the absence of 1-DDT, the added Sn4+ ions were reduced to Sn2+ by oleylamine which further reacts with Se2− to produce SnSe HNs. On the other hand, in the presence of 1-DDT, Sn4+ first reacts with 1-DDT to form a Sn4+-dodecanethiolate complex. This stabilizes the Sn4+ ions in the oleylamine medium, which later react with Se2− to form SnSe2 HNs. Phase pure SnSe2 HNs were obtained only when 200 μL of DDT was used. This gives a mole ratio of nearly 1:6 between Sn4+ and 1-DDT, which means that for each Sn4+ ion there are six 1-DDT molecules available to form a Sn4+-dodecanethiolate complex. Since dodecanethiolate is a monodentate ligand, a minimum of four molecules of 1-DDT are required to effectively stabilize one Sn4+ ion. Hence, 200 μL of 1-DDT is sufficiently enough to stabilize Sn4+ ions in the reaction mixture and form pure SnSe2 HNs. On the other hand, when 50 or 100 μL of DDT was used, the mole ratio between Sn4+ and 1-DDT decreased to 1:1.5 and 1:3, respectively. Sn4+ ions cannot be completely stabilized with these concentrations of 1-DDT and resulted in a mixed phase of SnSe and SnSe2 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, with 1-DDT the reaction mixture changed from colourless to bright yellow after stirring at 70 °C for 30 min. This further confirms the formation of a Sn4+-dodecanethiolate complex. SnSe2 HNs were formed only after 36 h, which is a relatively longer reaction time than that of SnSe HNs (24 h). This can be attributed to the stability of the Sn4+-dodecanethiolate complex which slowed down the formation of SnSe2 nuclei. In order to further support this mechanism, we carried out similar experiments with oleic acid instead of 1-DDT. Different amounts of oleic acid (100, 300 and 500 μL) were added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was performed at 180 °C for 36 h. Oleic acid can react with Sn4+ ions and form a Sn-oleate complex. XRD patterns in Fig. S7 (ESI†) show that pure SnSe2 phase was obtained only when a certain amount of oleic acid is present in the reaction medium. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the SEM images of SnSe2 HNs synthesized with oleic acid. The morphology of the HNs is slightly different from those obtained with 1-DDT. The constituting nanosheets have an average thickness of 20 nm.

3.3. Optical properties of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs
Diffuse reflectance data were obtained to study the optical properties of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs. Samples were prepared by drop-casting concentrated toluene dispersions of tin selenides on glass substrates. Onset absorption was found to be near 1200 nm for SnSe HNs and 1000 nm for SnSe2 HNs (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Kubelka–Munk transformations were performed to determine the indirect and direct band gap values.16 The indirect band gaps of the SnSe and SnSe2 HNs were determined to be 1.01 and 1.28 eV, and the direct band gaps were 1.36 eV for SnSe and 1.42 eV for SnSe2 HNs. In addition, we have measured the optical properties of SnSe nanostructures as a function of reaction time. The diffuse reflectance spectra are provided in Fig. S11 (ESI†) and the calculated direct and indirect band gap values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The direct band gap values decrease with increasing reaction time, whereas the indirect band gap values increase with increasing reaction time. We have also measured the optical properties of SnSe/SnSe2 composite nanostructures synthesized using 100 μL of 1-DDT. The indirect and direct band gap values were determined to be 0.97 and 1.29 eV, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†).
3.4. Photovoltaic application of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs
The photovoltaic potentials of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs were assessed by employing them as counter electrodes in DSSCs. SnSe and SnSe2 CEs were prepared by deposition of 50 μL toluene dispersions (10 mg mL−1) on the FTO glass followed by 500 °C heat treatment for 30 min in N2 atmosphere. The textural properties of the annealed SnSe and SnSe2 HNs were obtained through N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and details of the data profiles are given in Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs were measured to be 3.9 and 5.2 m2 g−1, respectively. These values are higher than the reported surface area for SnSe2 nanostructures.25 Both the HNs possessed a mesoporous nature with pore size distribution around 10–40 and 5–10 nm for SnSe and SnSe2 HNs, respectively. The morphology of the annealed films was characterized using SEM analysis. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), both the films were dense and uniform without any major cracks. No obvious change in the flower-like morphology was observed. This shows the structural stability of tin selenides at high temperatures. The thickness of the films was measured from the cross-sectional SEM images of the films. SnSe and SnSe2 HN films have an average thickness of 7.5 and 9.5 μm (Fig. S16 (ESI†)). We also characterized the films using XRD before and after annealing at 500 °C. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S17 and S18 (ESI†). No additional peaks or changes in the XRD pattern were observed after annealing at 500 °C. The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CEs was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode system. Fig. 8a shows the CV curves for the I−/I3− redox couple on Pt, SnSe, and SnSe2 CEs. For all the three electrodes, two pairs of redox peaks were observed in the cyclic voltammograms. The left redox peaks correspond to eqn (1) and the right redox peaks correspond to eqn (2). Both the SnSe and SnSe2 CEs show similar redox peaks compared to Pt, indicating that tin selenides are effective in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide to iodide. I3− + 2e− → 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−(2)

Fig. 8b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of N719-sensitized solar cells assembled with various CEs under a standard simulated AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with SnSe2 CE yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.60% (short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) = 10.71 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) = 0.747 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.70), while the DSSC with SnSe CE produced a PCE of 5.52% (Jsc = 10.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.760 V, FF = 0.70). These results were comparable to the performance of the reference DSSC device using the conventional Pt CE with a PCE of 5.74% (Jsc = 10.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.756 V, FF = 0.69). These results suggest that the synthesized SnSe and SnSe2 HNs are promising candidates to replace the precious Pt metal as an efficient electrocatalyst in DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a facile solvothermal method has been developed for phase controlled synthesis of SnSe and SnSe2 HNs in oleylamine. The added surfactant 1-DDT plays a key role in controlling the crystal phase of the tin selenides. It is believed that 1-DDT stabilizes Sn4+ ions by forming a Sn4+-dodecanethiolate complex and produces SnSe2 HNs, whereas in the absence of 1-DDT, Sn4+ ions are reduced to Sn2+ by oleylamine and SnSe HNs are obtained. The obtained HNs have flower-like morphologies composed of thin nanosheets of thickness 7–12 nm. When SnSe2 HNs are used as the counter electrode of DSSC, a power conversion efficiency of 5.60% is achieved, which is comparable to that of a conventional Pt counter electrode (5.74%). These results showed that SnSe and SnSe2 HNs are promising candidates to replace the precious Pt metal as an efficient electrocatalyst in DSSCs.
