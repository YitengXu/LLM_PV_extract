    , Accepted 24th January 2013First published on 29th January 2013AbstractTiO2 nanotube arrays loaded with carbon quantum dots were used as a photoanode for efficient hydrogen generation under visible light.
Solar water splitting for clean and cheap hydrogen production has attracted considerable attention due to the energy crisis and environmental issues. TiO2 is regarded as one of the most popular photoanode materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting devices owing to its high resistance to photocorrosion, physical and chemical stability, ease of availability and low cost.1–9 Notably, one dimensional nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrodes such as nanotubes,2,9 nanorods3,4 and nanowires5–8 have been demonstrated to be efficient in PEC cell and photovoltaic cell applications for the reason that they can enhance the charge separation, charge transport, light absorption and decouple the directions of light absorption and charge collection. However, both the bulk and nanostructured photoanodes of pure TiO2 materials still suffer the major limitation of weak responses (or nonresponse) to the visible spectrum owing to their large band gap (about 3.2 eV). To date, a variety of strategies have been utilized to improve TiO2 PEC performance, such as doping with C, N, Sn, Sr, Nb,2,6–9 coupling with secondary semiconductors and photosensitization of dyes.10–15 Compared with the doping strategy, other approaches with dye-based compounds12–15 or narrow band gap semiconductors16–20 as sensitizers are convenient, and have tunable structures and properties. This system has also achieved a certain degree of success in broadening the absorption spectrum to the visible and near infrared (NIR) region, and therefore enhancing the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of the PEC cells.13,16–20 However, the dyes and semiconductor quantum dots are often inconvenient to synthesize, unstable in water under irradiation, and toxic to organisms which made them difficult and uneconomical to employ in a wide range of practical applications. Therefore, it is urgent and challenging to search for a low cost and nontoxic material to serve as the sensitizer for the PEC system.
For efficient hydrogen generation under visible light, a good sensitizer should meet several criteria as described in the following.10 First, it must be able to enhance the absorption of the solar spectrum for the host materials. Second, it should own suitable energy levels so that the photoexcited electrons in the HOMO level or conduction band can be efficiently injected into the semiconductor acceptor's conduction band, and simultaneously the holes in the LUMO level or valence band can oxidize the reducing substances in the electrolytes. Third, it is favorable to contain some specific functional groups on their surfaces which can make them easy and stable to attach to the semiconductor acceptors' surfaces. Fourth, it should be resistant to corrosion or degradation under the practical operation conditions of PEC cells over a long term.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are generally defined as small carbon nanoparticles with excellent properties such as broadband optical absorption, strong photoluminescence (PL) emission, chemical stability, nontoxity and easier large-scale production with low cost. Based on those novel properties, in our previous work, CQDs have been coupled with semiconductor nanoparticles such as TiO2, Ag3PO4, and Fe2O3 to improve their photocatalytic abilities.21–24 In this report, CQDs were used as an alternative sensitizer for the PEC cells based on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs). Under simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the photocurrent density of the CQD sensitized PEC cell is four times larger than the unsensitized one at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The corresponding hydrogen production rate was determined to be about 14.1 μmol h−1 for a CQD sensitized TiO2 nanotube array (CQDs/TiO2 NT) photoanode (about 0.78 cm2) with a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%.
In our experiments, the CQDs were synthesized through an electrochemical etching method reported by our group.22 Two clean graphite rods (99.99%, Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd, 13 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter) were perpendicularly inserted in a 600 ml beaker containing 550 ml ultrapure water (18.4 MΩ cm) and used as both anode and cathode with a separation of 7.5 cm. A static potential of 60 V was applied between the two electrodes using a direct current (DC) power supply for seven days with intense magnetic stirring. Afterward, the solution was filtered with slow-speed quantitative filter paper, and then the filtrate was centrifuged at 22000 rpm for 30 minutes to separate off the large graphite particles. Finally, the solution of carbon quantum dots was concentrated to 0.1 mg ml−1 by rotary evaporation at 80 °C. As seen from Fig. 1a, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the synthesized CQDs are graphitic nanocrystals with an average size of 4 nm and a narrow size distribution. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (insert of Fig. 1a) of the CQDs shows that the lattice spacing is about 0.23 nm, which can be ascribed to the (100) facet of the graphite. From the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Fig. 1b), we can see that there are a large number of carbonyl, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the CQDs' surfaces. Especially, the CQDs show a strong and broad absorption of sunlight in the ultraviolet, visible and NIR region according to the ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) spectrum (Fig. 1c). The wide spectral absorption range of the CQDs endow it with an advantage in serving as a photosensitizer. Fig. 1d exhibits the down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence (PL) spectra. These kinds of PL properties, i.e. the excited electron of a sensitizer molecule or cluster relaxing to ground state through a relatively slow process such as fluorescence or phosphorescence emission rather than thermal relaxation, would be beneficial for the excited electrons to transfer to the acceptor in contact with the sensitizer directly or indirectly.25,26

To demonstrate the successful loading of the CQDs on the TiO2 nanotube arrays, we carried out electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopic studies. TiO2 NTs were fabricated by a two step process, electrochemically anodizing titanium foils in the fluorine-containing ethylene electrolyte with further optimazation.27 The SEM images revealed the growth of dense and vertically aligned TiO2 NTs on the titanium foil substrate, with tube radius of ∼100 nm and tube length of ∼13 μm (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b is a cross-sectional SEM image which shows the morphology of the TiO2 NTs after electrodeposition of the CQDs. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (shown in Fig. S2†) indicated that the relative amount of the carbon element of the CQDs/TiO2 NTs (63.71 at%) is much higher than that of the primitive TiO2 NTs (11.73 at%), which confirms that the CQDs were loaded on the TiO2 NTs successfully. Fig. 2c shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the TiO2 NTs loaded with CQDs. The HRTEM image shows that the CQDs (lattice spacing 0.23 nm) were in close contact with the TiO2 nanoparticles with the (004) crystal plane exposed (lattice spacing 0.24 nm) which constitutes the tube wall of the TiO2 NTs. These results also further confirmed that the CQDs were successfully loaded onto the TiO2 NTs' surfaces. Seen from the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 2d, four obvious characteristic peaks centered at 146 cm−1, 396 cm−1, 519 cm−1 and 639 cm−1 can be ascribed to Raman active modes of pure anatase according to the symmetry group analysis. However, two additional D-band and G-band peaks centered at 1357 cm−1 and 1593 cm−1 respectively can be observed in the CQDs/TiO2 NTs' spectrum, which are the Raman-active modes of the CQDs. This result also shows that the CQDs were electrodeposited on the surfaces of TiO2.

In our further experiments, electrochemical measurements were performed to investigate the PEC properties of the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode. The TiO2 NTs were fashioned into a photoanode by securing a copper wire onto the back side of the substrate with silver conducting paint. The substrate was then sealed on all edges and the back side with epoxy resin except for a working area. The TiO2 NT photoanodes were sensitized with CQDs by a pulse electrodeposition method which was performed in a two-electrode mode with a coiled Pt wire as the counter electrode. The positive and negative pulse voltage was +1 V vs. Pt and −0.2 V vs. Pt, respectively. The recorded I–t curve of the electrodeposition process of CQDs is shown in Fig. S1.† All PEC characterizations were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell in a stirred solution bubbled with nitrogen, with a coiled Pt wire as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference. The electrolyte is a mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solutions with the pH adjusted to ∼9.5. Fig. 3a shows the representative chopped-light current density versus time (J–t) curves of the TiO2 NT and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes which were measured under the illumination of simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. From the results one can see that there is a four-fold enhancement of the stable photocurrent density of the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode (1.0 mA cm−2) over the unsensitized one (0.25 mA cm−2). Fig. 3b shows a set of linear sweep voltammograms recorded from these TiO2 NT photoanodes in the dark and under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). Both the TiO2 and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes showed a small dark current density, on the order of 10−3 mA cm−2 from −0.9 to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. However, the pure TiO2 NT photoanode showed remarkable photoresponse under light illumination, and the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode exhibited substantially enhanced photocurrent compared to the pristine TiO2 NTs sample. The photocurrent enhancement observed in both the J–V and J–t curves can be attributed to the improved light absorption by the CQDs which can be concluded from the diffused reflectance UV-VIS spectra shown in Fig. 3c. By analyzing the UV-VIS spectra, it was found that the reflectivity of the CQDs/TiO2 NT anode is lower than the unsensitized anode from 410 nm to 900 nm. This result is good evidence for the additional absorption of the light due to the photosensitization by the CQDs. In addition, the light absorption of the TiO2 NTs at the visible and NIR regions is not consistent with the optical response behavior of pure TiO2 such as P25 (shown in Fig. S4†). The enhanced absorption (>410 nm) is possibly caused by impurities such as fluorine-doping or carbon-doping (shown in Fig. S2†) because the TiO2 NTs are fabricated in a fluorine-containing organic electrolyte.28–30 However, the additional absorption by the carbon or fluorine impurities cannot contribute to the light-to-electricity conversion, which can be concluded by comparing the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) data (Fig. 3d) between TiO2 NTs and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes. As seen from the IPCE spectra, both the two kinds of photoanodes showed distinct IPCE peaks centered at 390 nm but only the CQD sensitized TiO2 NT photoanode exhibited a positive IPCE value in the visible regions. This result is excellent evidence for the above conclusion that the enhanced light absorption of the CQDs can effectively contribute to current while the light absorption of the impurities cannot. Based on the above results and analyses, it can be concluded that CQDs can broaden the photoresponse range of the TiO2 to visible and NIR regions and enhance the light-to-electricity efficiency of the TiO2 photoanodes.

It is important to check the amount of hydrogen for the PEC hydrogen generation because it is not always ensured that the observed photocurrent is due to the hydrogen evolution.31 Therefore, a hydrogen generation test was carried out using a CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode to examine whether the observed anodic photocurrent was mainly due to the hydrogen generation process. Under simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), gas production can be observed at the photoanode with an applied bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Also, we carried out the gas content testing every 0.5 h using a gas chromatograph with nitrogen as the carrier gas during the gas collection process. Fig. 4a shows that the amount of hydrogen generated exhibited a linear relation with the illumination time in every 2 h measurement, suggesting the hydrogen evolution is persistent during continuous operation. The hydrogen production rate was estimated to be 14.1 μmol h−1 for a CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode (about 0.78 cm2) measured at an applied bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Fig. 4b shows the measured photocurrents for the CQDs/TiO2 NTs are stable during the hydrogen collection tests. Based on the stable photocurrent and the hydrogen evolution amount in Fig. 4, the Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution was estimated to be nearly 100% within experimental error, indicating the observed anodic photocurrent was completely due to the hydrogen evolution reaction (for a detailed calculation, see the ESI†).

(b) The corresponding time-dependent photocurrent profile obtained for the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode during the gas collection cycles. 
To further illustrate the sensitization of CQDs on TiO2 NTs, we compared the hydrogen production of TiO2 NTs and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes in the ultraviolet and visible regions respectively. When irradiated with a 300 W Cermax PE300BUV Xe lamp (26.3 mW cm−2 at 250–380 nm), both photoanodes showed similar hydrogen evolution rates (Fig. 5a). This result is consistent with the similar IPCE spectra (Fig. 3d) of TiO2 NTs and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes at the excitation wavelength of λ < 410 nm measured under the same conditions. A possible reason for the negligible sensitization effect of CQDs on TiO2 in the ultraviolet region is that the light absorption capacity of the CQDs is negligible compared with that of TiO2, which can be concluded from Fig. 3c. However, hydrogen production could only be observed for the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode when the two photoanodes were illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp with an L42 cutoff filter (a filter that only transmits light in the visible and near-IR regions). This is good evidence that hydrogen evolution in the visible and near-IR regions is mainly due to the contributions of the CQDs deposited on the TiO2 NTs. Combined with the IPCE spectra in Fig. 3d, it can be concluded that the enhanced visible and NIR photoelectric response of the CQD decorated TiO2 could effectively be used to produce hydrogen.
 Fig. 5  Comparisons of the hydrogen production efficiency between the TiO2 NTs and CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes (a) irradiated with a 300 W Cermax PE300BUV Xe lamp (26.3 mW cm−2 at 250–380 nm) and (b) illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp with an L42 cutoff filter. All measurements were performed at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. 
Here, we should point out that, in the present system, the enhanced photocurrent after the CQDs were deposited on the surface of TiO2 is not due to the TiO2 being excited by the CQDs' upconverted PL emission. This conclusion was confirmed by the different IPCE results obtained by performing tests in different electrolytes. As seen from Fig. 6a, no positive IPCE value can be observed with an excition wavelength over 410 nm for the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoelectrode in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The reason is that the holes in the HOMO level of the CQDs are not able to realize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while they can be consumed by the hole-scavenger in a sacrificial electrolyte such as Na2S/Na2SO3 aqueous solution. And if the positive IPCE values over 410 nm observed by performing the measurement in the Na2S/Na2SO3 aqueous solution were due to the upconverted fluorescence of the CQDs, one should also be able to observe a positive IPCE value over 410 nm in the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Therefore, a sensitization mechanism was proposed to illustrate the role of the CQDs in the PEC cells (Fig. 6b). A photon with adequate energy can excite an electron in the HOMO level, transferring it to the LUMO level of the CQDs. Afterward, the excited electrons in the LUMO level of the CQDs are transferred to the conduction band of the TiO2 NTs in contact, and then transported to the counter electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction along the TiO2 NTs axial direction. The holes left in the HOMO level of the CQDs can oxidize the sacrificial reagent to complete a whole galvanic circle.

Based on all of the above experiments and analyses, it can be expected that several further works could be carried out to optimize the PEC hydrogen production efficiency of the CQDs/TiO2 system. For example, one can design more efficient structures of TiO2 to improve the absorbance of CQDs and the charge carrier transport. On the other hand, CQDs can be modified by doping with S, N and P to further enhance the light-harvesting ability, quantum efficiency and the chemical reaction kinetics. Also, surface treatments of CQDs may be favorable for stronger anchoring on TiO2 and higher photogenerated charge carrier separation efficiency.
Conclusion
In summary, CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanodes were designed and fabricated, and their PEC properties and the sensitization mechanism were systematically studied. The CQDs that were electrodeposited on the TiO2 NTs can significantly broaden the photoresponse range of the TiO2 NTs to the visible and NIR regions. What's more, the enhanced optical absorption in both regions can be effective in improving the light-to-electricity efficiency. Under the illumination of simulated sunlight, the photocurrent density of the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode is four times larger than the TiO2 NT photoanode at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The obtained hydrogen evolution rate was 14.1 μmol h−1 for the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode. Also, the CQDs/TiO2 NT photoanode is stable for long term operation and can drive the hydrogen evolution reaction with a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. Even though the enhancement of the power conversion efficiencies in this work is limited due to the unoptimized conditions, we believe that the excellent properties of CQDs such as broadband optical absorption and stable reaction kinetics can make CQDs very promising sensitizers in enhancing the power conversion efficiency of TiO2 photoanodes.
