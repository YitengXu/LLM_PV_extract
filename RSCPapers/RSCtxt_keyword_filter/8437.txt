However, previous researches mainly focused on small-area PSCs, which do not meet the demand for large-scale production and commercial applications. Commonly used spin coating in small-area PSCs is not suitable; whereas meniscus coating is becoming the most promising scalable technique for fabricating large-area PSCs due to its special advantages. In this review, we first introduce the structure and advantages of meniscus coating. In particular, we explain the nucleation and crystal growth process of perovskite during the meniscus coating process. Then we systematically analyze the key factors for improving the photovoltaic performances and stability of large-area PSCs. With an understanding of the key factors, we summarize a number of strategies for fabricating large-area PSCs with high efficiency and stability based on meniscus coating. The strategies include optimizing the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films, use of additives, chemical composition engineering of perovskite, interfacial engineering, use of 2D perovskite, optimization of the charge transport layers, barrier designs and encapsulations. We believe that meniscus coating will be the most important and efficient approach for fabricating large-area PSCs and pave the way to commercialization of PSCs in the future.Ziyi WuZiyi Wu received his bachelor's degree in materials science and engineering from Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in 2018.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaics has been considered as one of the most prominent ways to utilize clean, environment-friendly, and inexhaustible solar energy. Among all the photovoltaics technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently emerged as so-called “third-generation solar cells” which have been greatly promoted as an environmentally and economically viable alternative to the traditional silicon solar cells.1 Perovskites have tremendous potential due to their intense light absorption, high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, tunable bandgap, small exciton binding energy, low fabrication cost, and simple solution processing,2–6 resulting in a rapid increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 3.8% to 25.5% in the past decade.7 The history of PSCs dates back to 2009, when Miyasaka and co-workers initially introduced organometal halide perovskites, i.e., CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3, as visible-light sensitizers for photoelectrochemical cells, which attained PCEs of 3.13% and 3.81%, respectively.8 However, the pristine PSC was extremely unstable due to the liquid electrolyte, which limited the interest and development at that time. In 2012, Park et al. reported a solid-state PSC by replacing the liquid electrolyte with the solid-state hole transporting material 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene to overcome the instability of previous PSCs, which realized a PCE of 9.7% and long-term stability of 500 h in air at room temperature without any encapsulation.9 Since then, more and more researchers have paid attention to this excellent photoelectric material. In 2013, Snaith et al. fabricated a simple planar heterojunction structured PSC incorporating vapor-deposited perovskite as a light-absorbing layer, which achieved a PCE of up to 15.4%.10 In 2015, Seok et al. reported an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI3 films by a direct intramolecular exchange of dimethyl sulfoxide with FAPbI3. PSCs with high-quality perovskite layers attained a maximum PCE of 20.1%.11 In 2017, Seok et al. introduced additional iodide ions into the precursor solution to form dense and uniform perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, which effectively decreased the concentration of deep-level defects and enabled PSCs with a certified PCE of 22.1%.12 In 2019, You et al. introduced phenethylammonium iodide to passivate the surfaces of perovskite films, resulting in a highly efficient PSC with certified PCE of 23.32% by reducing defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination.13

However, most research has mainly focused on small-area PSCs (<1 cm2), which do not meet the demand for industrial production and application. The development of large-area PSCs is one of the most crucial steps of the commercial road of the booming perovskite photovoltaics technique. Fig. 1a shows the efficiency map of large-area PSCs and modules related to active area in the past five years. Though the term “large area” is not clearly defined, it is generally accepted as an area larger than 1 cm2.14 Spin coating is the most commonly used technique of fabricating small-area PSCs due to its simple operation and solution-processing-friendly feature. However, spin coating is not suitable for large-area one with an area of much larger than 1 cm2, because the films produced by spin coating are inhomogeneous over such large areas, and spin coating may lead to enormous waste of raw materials.15 Therefore, several scalable fabrication methods, such as blade coating,16,17 slot-die coating,18,19 screen printing,20,21 spray coating,22,23 inkjet printing,24,25 vacuum deposition,26,27 bar coating,28,29 soft-cover deposition,15,30 and brush-painting,31,32 were utilized to deposit large-area perovskite films and charge transportation layers. In addition to monolithic large-area PSCs, perovskite solar module (PSM) is another effective way to construct photoelectric devices (Fig. 1b). The basic structure diagram (including the interconnections between sub-cells) of a PSM is shown in Fig. 1c. According to the opinions of Green and co-workers, modules should have areas of over 800 cm2, and the sub-modules should have areas of 200–800 cm2.33 However, only a few reported PSMs have areas larger than 200 cm2, which means that there is still a long way to go.34 To date, Panasonic holds the world record for PSMs, with a highest PCE of 17.9% for a sizeable area of 804 cm2.35
Three critical challenges have to be overcome for large-area PSCs or PSMs before their large-scale industrial manufacture. First, large-area high-quality perovskite films without pinholes, cracks, or poor coverage are difficult to obtain (Fig. 2a and b). Much previous work has demonstrated that the film morphology and crystalline quality of perovskite are quite important to device performances.79,80 Second, large-area perovskite films are always accompanied by lots of grain defects, bulk defects, and interface defects,81 leading to non-radiative recombination and huge losses of photovoltaic performance (Fig. 2c). Third, multiple degradation mechanisms of large-area PSCs and PSMs drastically influence their stability. The device degradation can occur in the perovskite layer, charge transport layer, and electrode under illumination, oxygen, and moisture conditions (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, each type of degradation of the functional layers can affect the long-term stability of PSCs, impairing their outdoor application.82,83

Although many reviews of scalable fabrication of large-area PSCs have been published before, few of them focused on meniscus coating of PSCs. In this review, we firstly introduce the structure and the advantages of meniscus coating and the processes and mechanisms of nucleation and crystal growth during the meniscus coating process. To figure out the best ways of obtaining devices with high efficiency and stability, mechanisms of improving the photovoltaic performances and stability are introduced. We then summarize several specific strategies and devices based on these approaches for improving the efficiency and stability of meniscus-coated large-area PSCs or PSMs, including optimizing the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films, use of additives, chemical composition of perovskite, interfacial engineering, use of 2D perovskite, optimization of the charge transport layers, and barrier designs and encapsulations. We believe that our work may interest many readers, especially those interested in industrialization of PSCs.
2. Meniscus coating
Meniscus coating refers to a scalable fabrication process involving the formation of a meniscus-shaped liquid edge of precursor solutions to spread a liquid film across a substrate (Fig. 3a).56,84 When the coating head moves on the substrate, the solutions spread under the surface tension and shear force produced by the coating head, forming the meniscus liquid shape. The forming meniscus can be divided into advancing meniscus and receding meniscus. The advancing wetting meniscus is valuable to study as it is the first contact location between the coating solutions and the substrate, and the wetting dynamic plays a vital role in limiting the coating speed.84 And the receding meniscus has various flows that significantly influence the coated film quality, which has been well investigated by researchers.85,86 Commonly used meniscus coating methods include blade coating, slot-die coating and bar coating.

Blade coating, also called “doctor-blading”, is a simple but versatile scalable fabrication method which has been widely used to fabricate large-area films in thin-film solar cells.87,88 In 2015, Deng et al. firstly introduced blade coating into PSCs to fabricate a large-area light-absorbing perovskite layer with a domain size range of 80–250 μm. By controlling the stoichiometry and thickness of the perovskite films, PSCs with PCE of 15.1% in an area of 0.0725 cm2 were achieved.89 It is generally believed that the most successful scalable fabrication method for large-area PSCs is blade coating, which has been used for deposition PSMs with PCEs of more than 15% and active areas of more than 50 cm2.47
Slot-die coating, invented in 1951, is a highly efficient solution-processed method for the deposition of large-area uniform films.90 Slot-die coating has been extensively used for large-area fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs),91,92 which is also expected to be successfully used for PSCs due to the similar device structure to that of OSCs. In 2015, Vak et al. developed a 3D printer-based slot-die coater to fabricate large-area PSCs by slot-die coating for the first time, achieving a highest PCE of 4.57% in an active area of 47.6 cm2.93
Bar coating, also called “D-bar coating”, has been known as a very simple but efficient coating technology for depositing large-area thin films in optoelectronic devices.77,94 Jeong et al. used D-bar coating to fabricate perovskite films based on precursor solutions prepared via gas-mediated solid–liquid conversion. The deposited perovskite films exhibited high quality and highly preferred orientation, resulting in a highest PCE of 17.82% with an area of 0.125 cm2.77
2.1. Structure of meniscus coater
As the structure for blade coating is very similar to that for slot-die coating, we take slot-die coating as an example to show the structure of the meniscus coater. A typical slot-die coater consists of a slot-die head and a solution reservoir. The slot-die head contains two metal blocks which are very close to each other, forming a slit (also called a lip) that allows the precursor solution (ink) to pass through. The cavity and channel inside the head are precisely designed to make sure the ink's property is unchanged during the whole coating process.95 The ink reservoir can be either inside the slot-die head or outside the head as an independent tank. If the reservoir is inside the slot-die head, a metal plug is generally used to squeeze out the ink from the vacuum reservoir into the slit (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, if the reservoir is outside the slot-die head, a syringe pump is commonly used to transfer the precursor solution into the slot-die head (Fig. 3c). When the ink passes through the slit, it is possible to form a continuous solution meniscus between the substrate and the slot-die head (Fig. 3a). Comparing to the slot-die coater, a blade coater commonly does not have a solution reservoir, so that the precursor solutions are spread on the substrate to form wet films (Fig. 3d). Once the solution meniscus is formed, a uniform film is deposited on the substrate with pre-designed thickness.96,97 Unlike blade coating and slot-die coating, the bar coater is a movable bar wound with a thin metal wire (from dozens of microns to a few millimeters). The solution is filled in the gap between the metal wires and the substrate and then spread into wet films during the bar moving process (Fig. 3e).
To show the progress of meniscus coating, we summarize the photovoltaics parameters of several representative works concerning large-area PSCs or PSMs fabricated by blade coating, slot-die coating and bar coating (Table 1).

2.2. Advantages and disadvantages of meniscus coating
It is generally considered that meniscus coating may be the most promising and applicable technology for the fabrication of large-area PSCs due to its notable merits.98–100 First, meniscus coating is a universal technology adaptable to various inks with different viscosity. Second, the deposited dry film thickness can be easily and precisely controlled within a few nanometers or up to tens of microns by adjusting coating parameters, such as ink feed rate, solution concentration, viscosity, coating speed, the gap between the doctor (slot-die head) and the substrate, length of the meniscus, and coating temperature.95–97,101 Third, the meniscus coating process has very low evaporation loss and ink waste on the substrate compared with other deposition methods such as spin coating or spray coating, which is beneficial for cost-saving industrial production of large-area PSCs.95,97 Last but not least, meniscus coating is compatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing (Fig. 3f), which not only has the potential to fabricate flexible devices, but also offers the possibility of high-throughput and mass-production manufacturing at a quite high speed.97,102,103
However, meniscus coating is generally difficult to begin with, due to the more complicated fluid dynamics compared to spin coating. Researchers may need to carefully design the fluid flow motion, without which they cannot fabricate smooth and dense thin films by meniscus coating. One of the most important failure mechanisms is the “low-flow” limit, where the breakup of the downstream meniscus causes discontinuity in the wet film.104 Besides that, “bubbles” and uncoated areas are always found within the wet films due to the breakup of the upstream meniscus.97
2.3. Understanding of the nucleation and crystal growth process
After the wet films are deposited on the substrate by the meniscus coater, the volatile solvents start to evaporate. The solute gradually precipitates in the form of crystal nuclei on account of the supersaturation status. The crystal nucleation and growth proceed simultaneously.

2.3.1. Nucleation. 
There are two types of nucleation: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The distinction between them depends on the site at which nucleation occurs. For homogeneous nucleation, nuclei form uniformly throughout the liquid phase; whereas for heterogeneous nucleation, nuclei form preferentially at structural inhomogeneities, such as surfaces, insoluble impurities, grain boundaries, dislocations, and so on.106,107
For the sake of simplicity, we discuss the mechanism of homogeneous nucleation. The Gibbs free energy change is defined as: (1)where r is the radius of the nucleus, γ is the surface free energy, which is positive, and ΔGV is the volume free energy difference between the solid and the liquid phases, which is negative. ΔGV is defined as: (2)where Lm is the latent heat of fusion, Tm is the equilibrium solidification temperature, and ΔT is the degree of supercooling (ΔT = Tm − T). GV and γ are constant values at a certain temperature, so the total free energy change (ΔG) is a function of radius (r). Schematic curves for volume free energy and surface free energy contributions to total free energy change are shown in Fig. 4a. The total free energy change first increases, passes through a maximum where = r*, and finally decreases as the radius increases. When the nucleus radius r < r*, the crystal growth will increase the total free energy, which is in an unstable state and finally shrink and redissolve. When the crystal reaches a size corresponding to the critical radius r*(r ≥ r*), the growth will continue with the accompaniment of a decrease in free energy. That is to say, the critical radius is the minimum size of a nucleus that can continue growing. The critical nucleation energy ΔG* is defined as: (3)
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic curves for volume free energy and surface free energy contributions to total free energy change. (b) Schematic curve for nucleation rate versus temperature. (c) Schematic curve for solution concentration versus distance x. (d) Schematic diagram of LaMer model of the nucleation and growth dynamics. 
The nucleation rate Ṅ (which has units of nuclei per unit volume per second) is defined as: (4)Here K is the proportionality constant, ΔG* is the critical nucleation energy as is mentioned above, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Qd is the activation energy for diffusion. Schematic curves for the nucleation rate (Ṅ) versus temperature (T) are shown in Fig. 4b. For the right-hand region of the curve (a dramatic increase in Ṅ with decreasing T), ΔG* is greater than Qd, which means the first term in eqn (4) is much smaller than the second term. The reduction of the nucleation rate with increasing temperature can be ascribed to the small activation driving force. With a reduction of temperature (i.e., the increment of the degree of supercooling), there comes a point at which ΔG* is smaller than the temperature-independent Qd. With decreasing temperature, the nucleation rate reduces on account of low atomic mobility at a lower temperature.106 According to eqn (3) and (4), the nucleation rate is strongly dependent on the surface free energy and the temperature. Therefore, the nucleation rate can be accelerated by lower surface free energy and higher temperature.


2.3.2. Crystal growth. 
According to classical nucleation and growth theory of nanocrystals, the crystal growth process can be divided into two parts: diffusion-controlled growth (when the concentration of the particles is lower than the minimum concentration for nucleation, the growth continues and nucleation stops) and surface-controlled growth (when the particle diffusion rate from the bulk to the surface is quite quick, the growth is controlled by the surface process).59
When the crystal growth is controlled by the diffusion mechanism, the growth follows the classical Fick's first law: (5)where J is the total flux of particles passing through a spherical plane, r is the particle radius, D is the diffusion coefficient and C is the concentration of particles at a distance from the surface (x). For the growth of nanoparticles within the solution, Fick's first law can be expressed as: (6)where Δx is the distance from the solid/liquid interface to the bulk; Cb is the bulk concentration at a distance of Δx; and Ci is the concentration of the solid/liquid interface (the surface of the nanoparticles), as shown in Fig. 4c.59
When the crystal growth is controlled by surface reaction, the total flux of the nanoparticles is equal to the reaction consumption rate, which can be expressed as: J = 4πr2k(Ci − Cs)(7)where k is the surface reaction rate and Cs is the solubility of the particles. Due to the Gibbs–Thomson effect, larger particles have lower solubility, so they grow faster than smaller ones.107


2.3.3. LaMer model. 
To solve the problems of fabricating large-area uniform perovskite films, we need to determine the perovskite nucleation and crystal growth kinetics during meniscus coating. Therefore, we introduce the LaMer model, which can depict the change in concentration of perovskite during the nucleation and crystal growth processes. A classical LaMer model typically consists of three stages, as shown Fig. 4d. In the first stage, the concentration of perovskite in the solutions increases due to solvent evaporation. When the concentration reaches a critical point of minimum supersaturation limit , it goes into the second stage (nucleation stage), where perovskite starts to nucleate. It goes to the peak concentration Cmax due to the balance between the supply rate of the precursor solute and the reaction consumption rate of nucleation and growth. Then the curve starts to decline owing to the increasing consumption for the growth of the newly generated nuclei until it reaches the critical point  again. Nucleation is terminated when the concentration is lower than the critical concentration. Subsequently, it goes into the third stage (growth stage), where the concentration continues to decline due to the growth of generated nuclei without any re-nucleation. Eventually, the crystal growth will be finished when the concentration decreases below the solubility CS.59,108–110
Inspired by the LaMer model, fast nucleation and slow crystal growth are the key to form large-area high-quality perovskite films. During the large-scale meniscus coating process, gas quenching, hot casting and gas pumping are effective approaches to accelerate the evaporation process, which shorten the time to reach the critical point of minimum supersaturation limit . That is to say, these methods lead to much higher nucleation rate. Besides that, a strong Lewis base such as DMSO can be added into the perovskite solutions to form intermediates, slowing down the crystal growth rate and improving the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Based on the Weimarn theory, both nucleation and growth are dependent on the degree of supersaturation. The competition between nucleation and growth decides the average size of perovskite crystals.111

3. Mechanisms for improving the efficiency and stability of large-area PSCs
3.1. Key factors for improving the photovoltaic performances
The photovoltaic performances relate to many aspects, especially the bandgap of perovskite and the non-radiative recombination loss in devices. The bandgap of the light-absorbing material limits the theoretical efficiency of solar cells, explained by the detailed balance limit (Shockley–Queisser limit).112 The non-radiative recombination, either through trap-assisted recombination in the perovskite layer or via minority carrier recombination at the perovskite/transport layer interfaces, predominantly limits the performances.113

3.1.1. Appropriate bandgap of perovskite. 
The energy of sunlight incident on solar cells cannot be completely absorbed, which depends on the bandgap of the light-absorbing layer.114 Only photons with energy higher than the bandgap can excite the electrons in the valence band to the conduction band. However, extra energy exceeding the bandgap will be transmitted in the form of heat energy. Therefore, moderately regulating the bandgap of perovskite can realize a balance of light absorption and open-circuit voltage. According to previous research, the theoretical efficiency limit of about 33.7% comes with a bandgap of about 1.34 eV,112,115 which means that adjusting the bandgap of perovskite to an appropriate one can effectively improve the photovoltaic performances of PSCs (Fig. 5a). The bandgap of perovskite can be easily adjusted by changing the chemical composition of it. For example, the incorporation of bromine (partially substitutes iodide) can widen the bandgap as a result of the increase of bromine.116

3.1.2. Decrease non-radiative recombination loss. 
An important reason for the disparity between the theoretical and empirical efficiency is the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes, which cannot be avoided. Electrons and holes may recombine inside the perovskite crystal (bulk recombination), near bulk impurities, in grain boundaries, or at the interface between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layer. In the recombination process, part of the solar energy turns into heat. Because a defect energy level deep in the bandgap facilitates the recombination, it is significant to reduce various defects.112,117,118
3.1.2.1. Improve crystallinity and quality of films. 
As typical kinds of defects, grain boundaries can be reduced by regulating the crystallinity and quality of films. When the grain size becomes larger, grain boundaries are decreased, which makes the carriers move more freely. Therefore, it is imperative to produce large grains and avoid dendrites.119,120
3.1.2.2. Interface defects. 
The recombination at interfaces also has a great influence on the performances of PSCs. Interface defects include anion defects, cation defects, interface mismatches, and dislocations. From this perspective, modulating interfaces, such as introducing extra interface layers or using interface modification reagents, is a reasonable way to reduce interface defects.113,121 Interface modification reagents can react with defects such as Pb2+ vacancies or I− vacancies and passivate them, namely reduce the defect levels deep in the bandgap of perovskite.122

3.2. Degradation mechanism of large-area PSCs/PSMs
Though PSCs have been rapidly developed in the past decade, they still face major instability issues, which severely hinder their road to large-scale commercial applications.45,123 Perovskite, the pivotal material of light absorption, is prone to interact with internal defects or external factors, such as light, oxygen, temperature, electric field, and humidity.124–128 These interactions may induce phase changes by altering the structure or induce chemical reactions that potentially cause irreversible degradation.129 In addition to the perovskite material, more complex degradation mechanisms occur in charge transport layers, electrodes, and the interfaces between them. One of the most severe instability issues can be attributed to ion migration, especially iodide.126,130,131 Chemical reactions occur between I− and the charge transport layer or electrode (usually Ag) when I− diffuses from the perovskite layer, leading to a significant decomposition of perovskite structure and a fast decline in device performance.124,127 Besides that, high temperature accelerates various degradation mechanism kinetics and leads to strain changes due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion of different layers of PSCs.129
Unlike small-area PSCs, large-area PSMs have poorer stability due to their more complex degradation mechanism. Generally, highly efficient PSMs contain several serially connected sub-cells fabricated by a laser-scribing pattern.132 Perovskite film is directly exposed in the air due to the P3 scribe of the modules, which means H2O and O2 can be more prone to degrade the light-absorption layer. Besides that, the P2 scribe provides a direct contact of the top electrode (usually Ag) and perovskite layer, leading to extra channels for iodide diffusion in PSMs (Fig. 5b). To improve the stability of PSMs, two major iodide diffusion channels need to be suppressed. The first one is the vertical iodide diffusion that is also commonly observed in small-area PSCs or other perovskite optoelectronic devices.125,133 The second one is the horizontal diffusion that occurs between the sub-cells or other pixel array devices at the interconnections, causing more serious stability problems on the module scale.130,134
Introduction of 2D perovskites, interfacial engineering, modified transport layer, and module structural design are utilized to improve the long-term stability of large-area PSCs under the influence light, oxygen, and water. Grancini et al. reported a 2D/3D perovskite junction, which formed an exceptional gradually organized multi-dimensional interface. PSMs based on 2D/3D interfacial engineering achieved 11.2% efficiency with an area of 47.6 cm2 stable for >10000 h with zero loss.45
4. Strategies for improving the efficiency and stability of meniscus-coated large-area PSCs
4.1. Optimizing the crystallinity and quality of the perovskite film
Researchers have tried many methods to improve the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer. Spin coating is the most common fabrication method for small-area PSCs. Anti-solvent engineering has been widely used in the spin-coating process to form smooth and pinhole-free perovskite films. An anti-solvent needs to be miscible with the common perovskite precursor solvent, but the perovskite itself should not be soluble in the anti-solvent. Perovskite ions can rapidly nucleate in a supersaturation status on account of the addition of anti-solvent.101
However, anti-solvents have been deployed only with spin coating, and they are difficult to implement in a scalable deposition. Unlike spin coating, most scalable fabrication processes do not have a similar drying process with the high-speed rotation of the substrate. Due to the slow-drying process, perovskite precursor ions can migrate in low-viscosity solutions, resulting in uncontrolled numerous pinholes in the perovskite film.70,96 Scalable coating typically generates a relatively low degree of supersaturation due to the slow evaporation speed of the solvent, resulting in a low density of heterogeneous nuclei. On the other hand, the crystal growth rate is relatively fast, leading to rapid solute precipitation at regions with high surface energy. The imbalance between nucleation and growth rate accelerates the formation of dendritic perovskite structures,107 as shown in Fig. 6a. So, many researchers have developed several physical and chemical strategies to optimize the crystallization and growth processes of perovskite.

4.1.1. Physical approaches. 
Physical methods of optimizing perovskite film morphology include gas quenching, hot casting, and gas pumping. All these methods aim to accelerate the evaporation of the precursor solvent, while not changing the perovskite's chemical composition. Fast solvent evaporation can create many uniformly distributed nuclei and induce fast crystal growth.96 The perovskite film will become smoother and pinhole-free after efficient physical treatment.
4.1.1.1. Gas quenching. 
Gas quenching, also called “air blowing” or “air-knife-assisted process”, is one of the easiest ways to accelerate solvent evaporation and improve film quality. High-speed inert gas (usually N2) is blown onto the wet film through a specific slot, uniformly taking the solvent away and expediting the perovskite's crystal growth. Many researchers have used gas quenching as an effective way in the large-area fabrication of PSCs due to its simplicity and high reproducibility.43,59,136–139
In 2014, Huang et al. introduced gas-assisted preparation of lead iodide perovskite films for the first time. They found that the gas-assisted process changed the kinetics of nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite during spin coating, which led to quite uniform perovskite films.139 However, they used the gas-assisted technique in the traditional spin-coating process, which is not beneficial for large-area production. After that, other researchers have tried to introduce gas quenching into the scalable fabrication process. Hwang et al. attached another slot-die head to the original slot-die coater. The second head was connected to high-pressure nitrogen gas to accelerate the evaporation of solvent during the slot-die coating process, resulting in a more dense and uniform film (Fig. 6b).67 Zuo and Gao demonstrated R2R compatible air-blowing-assisted slot-die coating to prepare MAPbI3 films of PSCs on glass and flexible substrates, achieving record PCEs of 15.57% and 11.16% with an area of 0.1 cm2, respectively.71
4.1.1.2. Hot casting. 
Hot casting, also called “hot-substrate method”, is a simple but effective method to accelerate solvent evaporation and crystal growth of perovskite films during the meniscus coating process.140 Deng et al. reported that high deposition temperature could effectively guide the nucleation and grain growth process in a simple and low-cost blade coating process of large-area PSCs. By controlling the stoichiometry and thickness of the perovskite layer, a highest efficiency of 15.1% with an area of 0.0725 cm2 and long carrier length of perovskite film (beyond 3.5 μm) were achieved due to the large-sized grains formed by the blade coating method.89
Many research groups also combined gas quenching and hot casting methods in the scalable fabrication of PSCs, achieving better device performances than that of devices without the physical dying method.69,70 Cotella et al. combined gas quenching with hot casting in the slot-die coating process, leading to rapidly dried perovskite film with evidently reduced roughness. They found that the horizontal growing vector became predominant since the vertical one is drastically reduced due to the temperature gradient caused by hot casting (Fig. 6c). The perovskite roughness was further reduced after introducing a cold air flow, due to the cold air flow taking a large amount of thermal energy and creating an even stronger temperature gradient, bringing a better crystallization process of the perovskite film (Fig. 6d). Devices that combine substrate heating and air knife achieved a PCE up to 9.2% with an area of 0.0625 cm2.141
4.1.1.3. Gas pumping. 
Gas pumping, also called “vacuum flash” or “vacuum-assisted process”, can remove the solvent rapidly at relatively low pressure. Researchers always used a home-made sealed chamber connected to a vacuum pump, which can keep a relatively low pressure (Fig. 6e). Unlike the gas-quenching method, gas pumping has an intrinsic advantage of not generating airflow that may influence the film uniformity and intactness during the scalable fabrication process.
Some researchers introduced a gas-pumping system after spin-coating perovskite films to accelerate solvent evaporation.14,142,143 Ding et al. introduced a simple but effective gas-flow-induced gas pump approach combined with gas quenching and gas pumping for fabricating large-area, dense and uniform perovskite films at a pressure of 100–1500 Pa with a gas flow of 360 L min−1 within 5 s (Fig. 6f), which offered high manufacturing efficiency and a wide process window. The solvent evaporation rate would be accelerated by this method, resulting in an ultra-fast nucleation rate of perovskite film. Large-area PSCs achieved a highest PCE of 17.03% and an average of 15.63 ± 0.80% with an area of 1.1275 cm2.144
Due to its convenience and efficiency, the gas-pumping method can also be used in scalable processing.145 Xu et al. transferred wet perovskite films into a homemade vacuum chamber to undergo a vacuum-flash process, which involved pumping from atmospheric pressure to ∼100 Pa within 20 s and maintaining the pressure for 2 min. During the vacuum-flash process, the substrate gradually changed color to brown. The blade-coated large-area (16 cm2) four-cell modules achieved a best efficiency of 15.79% with an area of ∼8 cm2, with better long-term stability of 1000 h.146 Cai et al. put slot-die coated perovskite films into a sample chamber connected to a gas pump system, which maintains the pressure at 100 Pa. Pinholes and local structural defects are eliminated by the gas-pumping method. Large-area PSMs reached a PCE of 10.6% with an area of 17.3 cm2.147


4.1.2. Precursor solvent engineering. 
Nonvolatile precursor solutions that contain polar aprotic solvents with high boiling points (such as DMSO or DMF) can be used for the spin-coating process because the solvents can be easily removed by centrifugal force while the substrate is rotated at high speed.101 However, scalable fabrication processes do not have an intrinsic drying mechanism like spin coating. Nonvolatile precursor solvents with lower evaporation speed always affect the resulting morphology of the perovskite films (Fig. 7a). For instance, the commonly used DMF solvent with a low vapor pressure (0.49 kPa at 25 °C) and a high boiling point (152–154 °C)148 was found to result in rough and rod-shaped perovskite film due to the slow evaporation speed.47 The rate of solvent evaporation strongly depends on the vapor pressure of the solvent, a lower value of which results in a higher boiling point and lower evaporation speed. Fig. 7b shows the vapor pressure of several commonly used solvents. Highly volatile solvents with higher evaporation speed are more suitable for the scalable coating process of large-area PSCs or PSMs, resulting in a rapid crystallization of perovskite film.149 Recently, 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) was reported to be one of the suitable solvents for large-area scalable coating processes136,150 due to its high vapor pressure (0.83 kPa at 20 °C) and low boiling point (124–125 °C).151 Besides that, many researchers have adopted acetonitrile (ACN) as the solvent of perovskite ink for meniscus-fabricated devices.72,149,152,153 ACN has many desirable advantages, such as low boiling point,153 low viscosity,154 long-term stability155 and low surface tension156 compared to the commonly used DMF and DMSO solvents, which demonstrated that ACN was better suited for fast scalable fabrication as an effective precursor solvent.152,157

However, from a material growth kinetics point of view, rapid crystallization caused by fast evaporation generally leads to low crystallinity, high defect density, and small grains, which are detrimental to both efficiency and stability of PSCs.153 To solve this problem, researchers added some nonvolatile solvents with high boiling points, such as CHP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone)76 and NMP,44 to introduce an intermediate phase of perovskite, resulting in high-quality perovskite films with a large-area scale. Lim et al. reported a perovskite mini-module with excellent photovoltaics performances by introducing the Lewis base hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). It is found that HMPA, with higher donor number than DMSO, contributes to form a stable adduct intermediate phase to form dense, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films. As a result, a mini-module with an active area of 18.66 cm2 based on D-bar coating demonstrated a highest PCE of 17.01%.78
Combining volatile and nonvolatile solvents is an effective approach to realize smooth, pinhole-free and uniform perovskite films with high crystallinity. Deng et al. combined volatile, noncoordinating solvents (VNCS) and nonvolatile, coordinating solvents (NVCS) as precursor solvents to achieve both fast drying and large perovskite grains at room temperature (Fig. 7c). About 98% (volume) of the mixed solvents are VNCS (i.e. 2-ME and ACN), which has relatively high vapor pressure and evaporates quickly during the blade coating process. However, the VNCS formed a smooth perovskite film at a high speed but resulted in small grain size and poor contact to the substrate. To improve the perovskite crystallinity, they introduced ∼2% NVCS (i.e. DMSO) into the precursor solvents, which would stay temporarily in the as-coated film in the form of an intermediate phase. The NVCS slowly released during the following annealing process, giving enough time and lower energy barrier for the perovskite crystalline grains to grow into large sizes and form good contact to the substrate (Fig. 7d and e). High-quality perovskite films were deposited using the mixed precursor solvents, yielding PSMs with a certified PCE of 16.4% with an aperture area of 63.7 cm2.153 Liu et al. designed a new low-boiling-point precursor solvent consisting of methylamine in ethanol (ME) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) for large-area blade coating of MAPbI3. The THF-ME solvent evaporated rapidly and increased the nucleation and crystallization rate of MAPbI3. Therefore, high-quality, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite films were deposited by the blade coating process.158

4.2. Additives
Organic or inorganic halide additives, such as chlorides and bromides, are commonly used to improve the morphology of perovskite films. On the one hand, they can partially replace MA+ or Pb2+ due to the similar ionic radius so that they can regulate the structure and optoelectronics of perovskite. On the other hand, they play an important role in modulating the crystallization kinetics.159 Moreover, it is generally believed that halide ions compete with I− to coordinate with Pb2+, suppressing the formation of Pb–I–Pb plumbates and nuclei in the solution, resulting in uniform perovskite films with larger grain size.160,161 Zuo et al. used ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as an additive while preparing MAPbI3 films. They found that device performances improved apparently after using NH4Cl, which will improve the light absorption, crystallinity, and grain size of MAPbI3. PSCs on glass and flexible substrates based on slot-die coating attained record PCEs of 15.57% and 11.16% with an active area of 0.1 cm2, respectively.71 Similarly, Dai et al. also introduced NH4Cl into perovskite precursor solution to retard nucleation and prevent void formation at the interface of perovskite and glass (Fig. 8a). In addition, NH4Cl suppressed the formation of PbI2 and reduced the trap density of states (tDOS) in perovskite films (Fig. 8b). Flexible PSMs based on high-quality perovskite films with the addition of NH4Cl obtained a record aperture PCE of 15.86% with an area of 42.9 cm2.51 Many researchers have introduced (MACl) into perovskite precursor solvent to improve the morphology, phase crystallinity of perovskite and passivate defects at grain boundaries (Fig. 8c and d).44,60,162–167 Wu et al. reported the incorporation of 0.83 mol% phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) into the precursor solution of FA-based perovskite. The PEACl molecules modulated the crystal growth, enhanced the phase stability, passivated ionic defects at the surface or grain boundaries, and enhanced the moisture stability of perovskite films, leading to highly efficient PSCs with notable optoelectronic properties.168 Xu et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of Br-containing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) into the perovskite precursor could effectively improve the crystallization and large-area film uniformity during the blade coating process (Fig. 8e). PSMs based on TBAB attained a better reproducibility and a highest PCE of 15.79% with an area of ∼8 cm2. In addition, devices with surficial modification of the alkylammonium cations achieved a long-term stability with >89% of the initial PCE after 1000 h.146

In addition to halide additives, acids and their salts, such as acetate salts, can be used as additives to deposit uniform perovskite films.169,170 Acetate or acetate salts can significantly retard the crystallization process of perovskite, leading to a low nucleation rate and larger grains of perovskite. And strong hydrogen bonding can be formed between MA+ and O in acetate salts, leading to more stable intermediate phase and also retarding the crystallization process.171,172 Lee et al. mixed lead acetate (PbAc2) and PbCl2 with MAI to fabricate PSCs via slot-die coating. Lead acetate induced fast crystallization by forming an unstable organic by-product, methylammonium acetate (MAAc).173 PbCl2 was added along with PbAc2 to retard the rapid crystallization of perovskite, avoiding the formation of voids in the active layer. Perovskite films exhibited well-grown and uniform morphology, leading to improved device performance and reproducibility. Large-area modules based on mixed PbAc2 and PbCl2 achieved a PCE of 8.3% with an active area of 10 cm2.137 Lee et al. reported stoichiometric addition of PbAc2 into a precursor solution consisting of MAI and PbI2 in 2-ME (Fig. 8f), leading to MAPbI3 and by-product MAAc, which increased the crystallization rate due to its high volatility.174 Devices with addition of PbAc2 achieved an average PCE of 15.14% with an area of 0.125 cm2, almost 6 times higher that that without PbAc2.136 Kamaraki et al. also fabricated lead acetate-based flexible PSCs with a highest PCE of 6.5% with an area of 0.1 cm2 by one-step slot-die coating. The adoption of lead acetate led to fast crystallization of perovskite, without additional annealing step, demonstrating a rapid and low-temperature process.175 Li et al. introduced poly(acrylic acid) molecules to connect wide gaps between the large domains and passivate defects in the bladed perovskite films. Smooth, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films were obtained by this additive-assisted strategy.176
Wu et al. incorporated bilateral alkylamine additive (BAA), i.e., 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP), 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,8-diaminooctane, into MAPbI3 film to improve device performance by passivating defects at the perovskite grain surface. In addition, BAA additives tended to anchor onto the perovskite grain surface with both –NH2 tails, which exposed the linking hydrophobic carbon chain and formed a moisture-repelling barrier on MAPbI3 grains (Fig. 8g). Therefore, BAA effectively improved the device moisture stability to >1000 h and light stability to >500 h, with 90% of the initial PCE (Fig. 8h).61
Chang et al. reported printable inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs realized via blade coating SnO2, CsPbI3, and spiro-OMeTAD layers in ambient conditions. Multifunctional molecular additive Zn(C6F5)2 was introduced to improve the film quality and photovoltaics performances of the blade-coated CsPbI3 films. The presence of Zn(C6F5)2 does not influence the crystal structure, but chemisorbs on the perovskite surface, leading to the formation of energy gradients and a better energy band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, as well as suppression of trap formation within the perovskite film. The combined benefits significantly enhanced the PCE to 19.00% with an area of 0.09 cm2 for a printable CsPbI3 PSC, maintaining 98% of the initial PCE after 700 h in air conditions without encapsulations.177
4.3. Chemical composition engineering of perovskite
Methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) has been widely used as a light absorber in PSCs since Miyasaka et al. firstly fabricated perovskite-sensitized solar cells in 2009.8,179,180 Recently, other researchers partially replaced methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) with formamidinium (FA, CH3(NH2)2+) due to its more optimal bandgap, better thermally stability and broader light absorption spectrum.181–183 Moreover, alkali metals (Cs or Rb) were incorporated into perovskite to improve the phase stability of FA-based perovskite.5,184,185

4.3.1. Cation (A-site in ABX3) composition. 
In 2015, Jeon et al. fabricated a high-efficiency PSC based on (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 light-absorption layer. They demonstrated that the incorporation of MAPbBr3 in FAPbI3 improved the stability of the perovskite phase, resulting a highest PCE of 18.4% with an area of 0.096 cm2.186 Turren-Cruz et al. fabricated MA-free and Br-free PSCs by incorporating rubidium and cesium cations, which enables high crystallinity and improves the thermal stability of the perovskite layer. Devices based on the MA-free perovskite light-absorption layer achieved an efficiency of 20.35% with an active area of 0.1024 cm2, one of the best for MA-free perovskites.182 Deng and Huang first introduced mixed-cation (MA and FA) perovskite into the blade coating fabrication process. Mixed-cation perovskite was chosen due to its lower bandgap and extended absorption onset to 850 nm. It is well known that FAPbI3 is thermodynamically stable in δ-phase (yellow, non-perovskite phase) at room temperature, and stable in α-phase (black, perovskite phase) at a higher temperature (Fig. 9a).187 MAPbI3 was introduced to improve the phase stability and film coverage of mixed-cation perovskite (Fig. 9b and c). The doctor-bladed FAPbI3 films were in the desired α-phase without any additional annealing process because the precursor solution and the substrates can be easily heated during the blade coating process. Devices based on mixed-cation perovskite with PCE of more than 18% and stability longer than 20–30 days in air were fabricated by the scalable doctor-blade coating method.187

4.3.2. Iodide and bromide (X-site in ABX3) composition. 
Tang et al. introduced small amounts of Cs+ cations (less than 5%) and Br− anions (2.5 mol%) into (MAPbI3)0.6(FAPbI3)0.4 mixed precursor solution for blade coating MA0.6FA0.38Cs0.02PbI2.975Br0.025 perovskite films with improved phase purity at a lower temperature of 120 °C. The device performances were significantly enhanced after the incorporation of Br− (Fig. 9d), which can be ascribed to Br− improving the phase purity and stabilizing the black phase of FAPbI3 films.60 Tang et al. systematically investigated the solidification process during blade coating of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskites in situ using time-resolved grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). They found that the introduction of Br− suppressed the non-perovskite 2H phase and promoted the 3C perovskite phase of FAPbI2.55Br0.45 (Fig. 9e and f). Through the introduction of MA+, Cs+, and Br− into perovskite formulation, they fabricated a highly efficient blade-coated PSC with a highest PCE of 18.20% with an area of 0.09 cm2; whereas pristine FAPbI3-based PSCs only yielded 12.35% under similar conditions.188

4.4. Interfacial engineering
According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, the theoretical PCE of a single-junction solar cell based on an organic–inorganic lead iodide perovskite with a bandgap of 1.34 eV is 33.7%.112 The large gap between the theoretical limit and actual PCE is ascribed to the recombination that occurs at grain boundaries, interfaces, and ion defects. Trap-assisted recombination (also called Shockley–Read–Hall recombination) at interfaces is the dominant loss mechanism.101,189 Interface engineering can effectively mitigate carrier recombination and increase carrier collection, leading to high-performance and high-stability PSCs. Interface engineering includes self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), interface buffer layers, etc.190,191
Gu et al. modified PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL) with 3-aminopropanoic acid as a self-assembled monolayer (C3-SAM) to improve the crystallinity and coverage of perovskite film. Besides that, the modification with the C3-SAM led to a better energy band alignment by lowering the work function of PEDOT:PSS by 0.2 eV. Slot-die roll-coated PSCs exhibited an enhanced PCE from 3.7% to 5.1% with an area of 0.5 cm2, which showed the feasibility and superiority of SAMs in interfacial modification engineering.192
Wu et al. introduced an inter-layer of phytic acid sodium (PAS) between NiOX HTL and perovskite layer in PSCs prepared by blade coating. There are six phosphate groups (PO43−) in each PAS molecule (Fig. 10a), and the P–O bond in each phosphate group may react with Ni and Pb metal atoms. During the complexation between PO43− and Ni, O–Ni bonds were newly formed to enhance the contact between the HTL and the PAS inter-layer; similarly, O–Pb bonds were formed to improve the contact between the PAS layer and perovskite layer (Fig. 10b). Therefore, the FF of devices with PAS was increased from 52.96% to 60.82% on account of the better interfacial contact. Moreover, the lower VB value of PAS-modified NiOX film was −5.3 eV, which enabled the device to fit the energy level effectively and facilitated the extraction of holes. PSCs fabricated by blade coating achieved a higher PCE of 13.19% with an area of 1 cm2, an approximately 30% increase compared with devices without PAS-modified NiOX.193

4.5. 2D perovskite
Recently, low-dimensional perovskites, especially 2D perovskites, have attracted more attention due to their advantages of high environmental stability, thermal robustness and the possibility of fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties through compositional engineering.194–199 The general formula of 2D perovskites is R2An−1PbnX3n+1, where R is an organic cation (such as aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium) between the inorganic sheets200–202 and n defines the number of inorganic sheets. When n = 1 (R2PbX4), the organic cations isolate a single layer of the inorganic framework in the pure 2D perovskite form. And when increasing the number of layers (n > 1), the pure 2D perovskites gradually transform into “quasi-2D perovskites” and finally into 3D perovskites when n = ∞ (Fig. 10c).194,199,203 However, 2D perovskites generally have a wider optical bandgap of at least 2.5 eV, which restricts photon conversion to less than 500 nm,204,205 and have a larger exciton binding energy of ∼300 meV (10–50 meV for 3D perovskites),204 which restricts the light absorption and photovoltage output (Fig. 10d).197 To solve this problem, 2D–3D hybrid perovskites are one of the most effective solutions.185,206
Hu et al. reported a 2D/3D heterojunction via in situ growth of a thin-layered 2D perovskite enabled by organic cation S-benzyl-L-cysteine by one-step blade coating. The functional groups of amine and carboxyl in the spacing molecule of the 2D perovskite passivated the surface defects of the 3D perovskite, resulting in significant suppression of nonradiative recombination (Fig. 10e and f) and a quite high VOC of 1.20 V.17
Zuo et al. reported a facile, scalable drop-cast method and slot-die coating to deposit highly oriented, uniform Ruddlesden–Popper 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 for the first time, yielding PSCs with a certified PCE of 14.33 ± 0.34% in an area of 0.078 cm2. PSCs with 2D perovskite layers deposited by slot-die coating on a glass substrate or R2R slot-die coating on a flexible substrate produced PCEs of 12.5% and 8.0% with an area of 0.1 cm2, respectively.68 Almost all of the 2D perovskite films were prepared by spin coating, which may lead to randomly oriented perovskite crystals, resulting in poor device performances.199 It was demonstrated that scalable deposition is a promising direction for mass production of large-area 2D perovskite films with high orientation and better reproducibility.
2D perovskites have emerged as some of the most promising materials in PSCs due to their excellent stability. Considering the relatively wide bandgap of the 2D perovskites, they may not be the ideal light-absorption materials for single-junction perovskites. But they can be good wide-bandgap candidates for tandem solar cells with high efficiency and good stability. On the other hand, 2D/3D hybrid perovskites have shown similar efficiency but better environmental stability compared to pure 3D perovskites.207 Therefore, the key development of 2D perovskites is to strike a balance between high efficiency/poor stability (3D perovskites) and low efficiency/better stability (2D perovskites). This needs appropriate choice of the organic cations and optimization of film processing to obtain well-oriented 2D/3D perovskite films with high charge extraction ability and defect-free grains.208 To date, the most common 2D/3D hybrid perovskites are focusing on phenylethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium (BA).13,209 And we are looking forward to fabricating new phase-pure and highly oriented 2D perovskites for 2D/3D mixed perovskites in the future.
4.6. Optimization of the charge transport layers

4.6.1. Most common charge transport layers. 
A typical PSC consists of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite layer, HTL, and top electrode. ETLs play an important role in extracting and transporting the photogenerated electrons from the perovskite layer to the electrode. In addition to that, the ETL can also block photogenerated holes and suppress charge recombination. Inorganic ETLs, such as TiO2,210–213 SnO2,214,215 and ZnO,216,217 are commonly used in conventional PSCs due to their excellent electronic properties, superior device performance, and remarkable stability.218 Inspired by OSCs, fullerene and its derivatives, such as C60 (ref. 219) and PCBM,220,221 are mostly used as ETLs in inverted PSCs. Organic ETLs are suitable for electron extracting and transporting on account of their low-temperature fabrication, suitable energy level alignment, and high electron mobility.222,223
As for HTLs, most of them are organic materials, including spiro-OMeTAD,224,225 PTAA,226,227 P3HT28,228 and other small molecules.229 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is considered as the most successful HTL due to its good conductivity, proper energy level, solution-processability and relatively simple recipe.230 To enhance the electrical properties of spiro-OMeTAD, some additives, such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), are added into pristine spiro-OMeTAD. However, spiro-OMeTAD and other organic HTLs face serious stability issues so that inorganic HTLs, including NiOX,231–234 CuSCN235,236 and CuO/Cu2O,237,238 are applied in highly efficient PSCs. Inorganic ETLs are attracting more and more attention due to their high stability, high hole mobility, and low fabrication cost.239


4.6.2. Meniscus coating of charge transport layers. 
Spin coating is still the most commonly used method to coat the charge transport layer. However, scalable fabrication, especially the meniscus coating of charge transport layers, is the future direction for large-scale preparation of PSCs and PSMs. Inspired by meniscus coating of charge transport layers in OSCs,240,241 some researchers have tried to introduce slot-die coating to deposit ETLs or HTLs in PSCs.
Bu et al. used slot-die coating to fabricate high-quality SnO2 film for a high-efficiency flexible PSC (Fig. 11a). They introduced universal potassium cations to passivate the interface and facilitate the growth of perovskite grains (Fig. 11b and c). The addition of K+ in the interface formed KBr that passivated the surface defects, which suppressed the hysteresis phenomenon and promoted the photovoltaics performances (Fig. 11d–f). Flexible devices achieved a highest PCE of 17.18% for 0.16 cm2 and 15.22% for 30 cm2.242

Spiro-MeOTAD has been commonly used in small-area spin-coated PSCs as an effective HTL. However, spiro-MeOTAD is incompatible with most scalable fabrication processes, resulting in a severe reduction in device performances. This could be ascribed to the poor wettability of spiro-MeOTAD, especially in scalable fabrication with a slow drying process.67 To solve this problem, Qin et al. applied twisted but fully π-conjugated 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl)amine-9,9′-bifluorenylidene (Bifluo-OMeTAD) (Fig. 11g) into slot-die coated devices as an HTL. Via molecule design, Bifluo-OMeTAD achieved better film-forming properties than spiro-MeOTAD and effectively suppressed crystallization during the slot-die coating process. Fully slot-die coated devices based on Bifluo-OMeTAD achieved a highest PCE of 14.7% with an area of 0.0672 cm2, which showed the attractive potential of Bifluo-OMeTAD for large-scale roll-to-roll production.18
Commonly used ETL phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) faces serious challenges in scalable fabrication of PSCs due to its aggregation behaviors, which affect the photovoltaics performance and stability. Angmo et al. investigated the potential of non-fullerene indacenodithiophene-based molecules (ITIC) as an effective ETL in low-cost inverted PSCs. They demonstrated that ITIC is a better alternative to PCBM due to its nanofibrillar structure and non-aggregation properties, which lead to highly uniform film formation, especially in the slot-die coating process (Fig. 11h and i). Though the PCE of the ITIC-based spin-coated devices is similar to that of PCBM-based spin-coated devices, the PCE of the ITIC-based slot-die-coated devices is 17.3% higher than that of PCBM-based slot-die-coated devices, which can be ascribed to the nanofibrillar morphology of ITIC that enables improved mechanical integrity and stability of ITIC-based PSCs.243

4.7. Barrier designs and encapsulations
According to the degradation mechanisms mentioned in Section 3.2, component volatilization, ion diffusion, and their induced reactions are the major degradation pathways of perovskites and other functional layers (Fig. 12a).244 In addition to perovskite composition engineering and dimensional engineering mentioned before, reasonable structural design, such as barrier designs and encapsulations, can effectively improve the long-term stability of large-area PSCs and PSMs.

To date, many kinds of barriers have been built within PSCs to shield the volatile perovskite components, block the ion diffusions between functional layers, eliminate metal reactions, avoid interface failure, and block moisture/oxygen from the external environment, which further improve the long-term operating stability of PSCs under a harsh environment (Fig. 12a).244 Bi and Han introduced zero-dimensional Al2O3 nanoparticles, one-dimensional polydimethylsiloxane and tri-s-triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as three kinds of diffusion barrier layers (DBLs) to block iodide diffusion channels and improve the stability of high-efficiency PSMs (Fig. 12b). In addition, the DBLs suppressed charge recombination and offered rapid interfacial charge transfer. PSMs, maintaining 95% of initial PCE after 1000 h under heating aging test, exhibited good light stability with 91% of the initial PCE after 1000 h aging test (Fig. 12c and d). The findings provided excellent solutions for highly efficient and stable large-area PSMs.130
Besides the integration of effective barriers into PSCs, encapsulation has been recognized as one of the easiest but most effective approaches to improve the stability of large-area PSCs or PSMs. The commonly used encapsulation approach is based on glass–glass encapsulation, where the PSC is sandwiched between two pieces of glass.245 Sealants, mainly polyisobutylene246 or UV epoxy adhesives,247 are filled in the glass edges to hold the two glass pieces tightly together with the PSC, preventing moisture and oxygen from infiltrating through the lateral direction. The glass–glass encapsulation approach is simple but extremely effective since glass is the best transparent moisture- and oxygen-blocking material without sacrificing light absorption. Liu et al. used parylene as an encapsulation material of PSMs to resist water and oxygen and to prevent leakage, which favored the enhancement of PSM stability. A cover glass was further sealed on the top of the parylene film to provide mechanical protection. The encapsulated PSMs, which showed similar efficiencies to the unencapsulated ones (16.6% with an area of 22.4 cm2), retained approximately 86% of their initial PCEs after continuous AM1.5G light illumination of 2000 h.248 Fu et al. found that the typical encapsulants for silicon and thin-film solar cells, such as polyolefin or ethylene vinyl acetate, were not suitable for encapsulations of PSCs due to the high processing temperature (>130 °C), which may cause the degradation of the perovskite layer. Therefore, they used polyurethane with relatively low temperature of 80 °C to encapsulate printable perovskite solar submodules, which maintained 97.52% of their initial PCEs after 2136 h under outdoor conditions.249 Another widespread encapsulation approach is based on polymers, such as PTFE250 and PMMA,251 which are also suitable for flexible PSCs. The polymer-based encapsulation materials can effectively prevent the invasion of water and oxygen due to their intrinsic benefits, including hydrophobicity, low ion diffusion coefficient and good adhesion.245 Jiang et al. reported that PSM encapsulation based on epoxy resin reduced the Pb leakage rate by a factor of 375 compared with that based on a glass cover with an ultraviolet-cured resin at the module edges. The epoxy resin encapsulation much reduced the Pb leakage due to its optimal self-healing characteristics and increased mechanical strength.252
5. Summary and outlook
In this review, we introduced three kinds of meniscus coating methods, namely blade coating, slot-die coating and bar coating, which have been considered as the most promising coating techniques for large-scale fabrication of PSCs and PSMs. Those meniscus coating methods have similar film formation processes due to the similar meniscus-shaped liquid edge of precursor solutions during the coating process. To determine the nucleation and crystal growth processes of perovskite during the meniscus coating, we introduced the LaMer model, which depicts the change in concentration during the nucleation and crystal growth processes. Inspired by the LaMer model, we concluded that fast nucleation and slow crystal growth are the key to form large-area high-quality perovskite films. However, there are three critical challenges for the large-area fabrication of PSCs via meniscus coating. That is to say, poor crystallinity and film morphology of perovskite films, nonradiative recombination and poor carrier transportation caused by defects in bulk, surface and interface, and instability issues, especially in large-area cells or modules, still need to be solved before extensive application.
To solve these problems, we demonstrated the key factors for improving the photovoltaics performances and stability of large-area PSCs. Based on an in-depth understanding of the key factors, several strategies for improving the efficiencies and stabilities of large-area PSCs, including optimizing the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films, additives, chemical composition engineering of perovskite, interfacial engineering, 2D perovskite, and meniscus coating charge transport layer, have been proposed. Among all the strategies, 2D perovskites are considered one of the most effective due to their excellent stability and outstanding photovoltaics performance. A lot of work that incorporated 2D and 3D perovskites has made great progress. Due to the slow drying process of the precursor solutions in scalable fabrication, it is of great importance to keep a balance of NVCS, such as DMF, DMSO or NMP, and VNCS, such as 2-ME or ACN. Some physical approaches, such as gas quenching, gas pumping and hot casting, are recommended to accelerate the drying process. In addition to this, interfacial engineering has been demonstrated for suppressing nonradiative recombination and reducing interface defects, resulting in both high efficiency and stability of large-area PSCs.
Recently, more and more researchers have shown an interest in fabricating large-area PSCs or modules via meniscus coating. However, there is a long way to go before complete commercialization. Despite significant progress on scalable coating perovskite films having been made, only a few researches have been focused on meniscus coating for charge transport layers or electrodes. However, low-cost and all-scalable are the inevitable trends of industrial manufacture; whereas the spin coating used in the laboratory will not be suitable. Driven by cost factors, some effective but expensive materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD or PCBM, have to be removed. In contrast, some cost-effective materials with similar or slightly lower performance are preferred. Another serious issue with PSCs is the poor stability comparing to the mature crystalline silicon or other thin-film solar cells. Encapsulations (including barrier designs) and 2D perovskites are proved to be quite effective approaches to improve the stability. Moreover, some organic materials in PSCs lack stability, especially in ambient atmosphere. Inorganic oxides or inorganic perovskites are optional substitutes due to their excellent water resistance and illumination stability. We believe that more interesting researches of meniscus coating will be proposed in the near future, accelerating the development of large-area PSCs, and making PSCs one of the most competitive alternatives to silicon solar cells.
