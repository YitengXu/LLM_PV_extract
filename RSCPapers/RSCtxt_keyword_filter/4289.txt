    , Accepted 12th November 2013First published on 20th November 2013AbstractOriented attachment, as aggregation based crystallization, is one of the most promising approaches in designing novel nanostructures. A two-step solvothermal method is reported in this work to synthesize TiO2 nanochains with one-dimensional single-crystalline nature, which is formed by oriented attachment and with tunable length. We achieved selectively reducing the stereo-hindrance effect at (001) surfaces and making the processes of Ostwald ripening and oriented attachment asynchronous. By virtue of the 1D single crystalline nature, the conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell was improved. This approach opens the door for controllable oriented attachment, and it is meaningful for designing novel nanoarchitectures.
Introduction
Morphology of nanocrystals is critical for their properties and controlling the growth of nanocrystals is an art of architecture in nanoscale. Oriented attachment/aggregation (OA) provides an aggregation based crystallization model for designing novel morphologies.1–5 Understanding its underlying mechanism will enable us to build novel architectures in bottom-up approaches, and make it possible to design functional materials based on these nanostructures. In the past decade, efforts have been devoted to investigating the kinetic process of this mechanism.6–9 However, two issues remain in having a further understanding in wet chemistry. Firstly, the processes of OA and Ostwald ripening (OR) always occur simultaneously, making it difficult to investigate the OA process independently. Secondly, the organic ligands with long hydrocarbon chains strongly hinder the collision and fusion of primary nanoparticles, thus blocking the occurrence of OA. In this respect, surface capping species with shorter ligands would decrease the distance between primary particles.10,11 More recently, as a new sort of surface capping agents, atomic-ligands showed a better effect in decreasing the interparticle spacing.12 Monovalent inorganic halide anions are believed to bind to the cations on the surfaces of nanoparticles.13,14 As for TiO2 nanocrystals, fluorine ions can remarkably reduce the surface energy of the (001) face.15–18
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a hot topic in the study of material and energy fields. However, the photoconversion efficiency is limited by charge transfer and collection in the photoanode. 1D metal-oxide nanostructures with a highly crystalline nature have the effect of improving electron transport and collection compared with polycrystalline nanostructures, leading to reduced charge recombination.19–21
Previously, in the study of shape evolution of TiO2 nanobipyramids we found that at relatively high temperature, 3–4 primary nanoparticles would spontaneously fuse in the [001] direction via the OA mechanism.22 We considered this synthetic method a good starting point to prepare anatase TiO2 nanochains and study the mechanism of OA. In this paper we improved the previous method and report a two-step solvothermal method for synthesizing anatase TiO2 nanochains with a variety of lengths. The first step and the second step are dominated by OR and OA respectively. The use of organic ligands and atomic-ligands can selectively reduce the stereo-hindrance effect on (001) surfaces, which facilitate the occurrence of OA. We studied the influences of numerous synthesis components and kinetic conditions on the formation of anatase nanochains in the second step. We found that, by varying the addition of H2O, the length of the nanochains could be controlled. Furthermore, the performance of DSSCs was improved by the virtue of the 1-D structure of anatase nanochains.
Experimental section
Materials
Titanium butoxide (99%, Acros), oleic acid (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium fluoride (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), NaF (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), deionized water, ethyl cellulose (Aladdin), α-terpineol (≥98%, Aladdin), di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719 dye, Dyesol), redox electrolyte for DSSCs is composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in dried acetonitrile, Surlyn hot-melt gasket (DuPont).
TiO2 nanochains synthesis
In a typical synthetic procedure, the anatase nanochains were prepared via a two-step solvothermal method. In the first step, 13.5 mmol TNBT and 1.2 mmol sodium fluoride were mixed in 120 mmol OLA and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 h to form an orange yellow solution. Then the raw material solution was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and held at 200 °C for 24 h. At this stage the product isolated was anatase nanoparticles. In the second step, 84 mmol H2O was added into the autoclave and the solution was stirred for 6 h. Then the autoclave was sealed and kept at 300 °C for another 24 h. After the synthesis, the anatase nanocrystals were precipitated upon addition of ethanol, separated by centrifugation. Then, the resulting products were easily redispersed in chloroform.
TiO2 paste preparation and DSSC fabrication
The TiO2 paste was prepared according to the reported literature.23,24 Nanocrystal suspensions were stirred at 60 °C for 6 h with ethylcellulose previously dissolved in toluene. And then the paste was obtained by rotary evaporation. Finally, the paste had the following composition in weight percentage: TiO2 18%, organic capping residuals: 10%, ethylcellulose: 7%, α-terpineol: 65%. The as-prepared paste was sprayed onto the FTO substrate via the doctor-blade method. The TiO2 films were scratched into 5 × 5 mm squares and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air. After the films were cooled to 80 °C, they were soaked with a solution of 0.3 mM N719 in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (v/v, 1:1) and kept at room temperature for 24 h to complete the dye loading. The DSSCs were assembled by placing a platinum-coated conducting glass (counter electrode) on the dye-sensitized photoelectrode. And they were assembled by a 60 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt gasket. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the inter-electrode void space through a hole on the back of the counter electrode. The holes were sealed up using the Surlyn hot-melt film and a cover glass.
Characterization
TEM was conducted at 80 kV (JEM 1230; JEOL). High-resolution TEM images were acquired at 200 kV (Tecnai G2 F20; FEI Co.). All samples were redispersed in toluene and drop-casted on copper grids with carbon coating. Powder XRD date were collected using a diffractometer (PW1050; Philips) with Cu Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out by using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer. The IR transmission mode was measured on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10, using KBr pellets. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley unit (model 2400 source meter). A Zolix AM 1.5 solar simulator (model Solar S 150) equipped with a 150 W xenon arc lamp served as a light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Si solar cell as reference. To estimate the dye adsorption on the TiO2 film, the sensitized electrode was separately immersed into 10 ml 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (water:ethanol = 1:1), which resulted in the desorption of N719. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured by a UV–vis spectrometer (U-4100; Hitachi). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TiO2 films were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4500; Hitachi).
Results and discussion
In a typical synthesis, titanium butoxide (TNBT) was employed as a Ti precursor, oleic acid (OLA) served both as the capping agent and solvent, and fluorine as another capping agent was introduced by the addition of sodium fluoride (NaF). In the first step, the raw solution composed of OLA, TNBT and NaF was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and gradually heated to 200 °C and held for 24 h. In the second step, H2O was added into the reaction solution and the autoclave was heated to 300 °C and held for 24 h. The oriented attachment occurred during the second step, and our studies on the controlling of oriented attachment were mainly carried out in this step. (Details for the Experimental section are presented in the ESI†).

Fig. 1 shows the characterization of the nanochains obtained by using 84 mmol H2O at 300 °C for 24 h in the second stage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals the formation of TiO2 nanostructures with a chain-like morphology with a well-defined 1-D structure (Fig. 1a–c). As is shown in Fig. 1b, a typical nanochain is aligned by 16 uniform primary nanoparticles. High-resolution TEM highlights the single-crystalline nature of primary nanoparticles and provides more detailed structural information on the joint site (Fig. 1c). The morphology of building blocks is truncated nanobipyramids and the size in the long axis direction is about 16 nm. The well defined lattice fringes in position I (the interior site of primary nanoparticles) are spaced at about 0.478 nm, corresponding to the (001) planes of anatase TiO2, which indicates that this 1D structure is along the [001] crystallographic orientation. However, in position II (the joint site of primary nanoparticles) the spacing of double planes is measured to be 1.08 nm, slightly dilated than the twofold of 0.478 nm. This distortion at the particle interface could be attributed to the lattice deformation during the fusion of primary nanocrystals. The surface of connective particles are not atomically flat, thus, defects like dislocations or slight misorientations can be generated at the interface when adjacent particles fused by oriented attachment.25,26 The OA mechanism is a multistep process and has an intermediate state, in which the crystallized link between primary particles is not fully established.27–29 XRD pattern for nanochains (Fig. 1d) could be indexed to the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS no. 21-1272). The average size was estimated from the (101), (001) and (200) peaks using the Scherrer formula to be 10.4 nm, 14.1 nm and 12 nm. There is an inconsistency between the value calculated from the (001) peak and the TEM observation. This could be attributed to the fact that the lattice distortion at the particle interface damaged the periodicity of the crystal in the [001] direction, while one precondition for the Scherrer equation is no mechanical distortion.

To shed light on the underlying formation mechanism of nanochains, the crystal growth was studied by a time-based experiment, and the shape evolution process was monitored by TEM observation. As is shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), isolated anatase nanoparticles (primary nanoparticles) were generated from the first step, and the morphologies are mainly truncated nanobipyramidal with a size of about 14–16 nm. XRD characterization shows that the phase of the primary nanoparticles is anatase. In the following step, the products were harvested at different intervals. In Fig. S1b,† after 3 h synthesis, the primary nanoparticles could be observed starting to fuse, and some quasi-nanochains were formed. When the reaction time was extended to 8 h, the vast majority of he primary nanoparticles aligned into nanochains (Fig. S1c†). Fig. S1d† is a HRTEM image taken from the 3-h sample showing that the joint site at the end of a nanochain was not entirely fused. These observations confirm that the nanochains were formed by the OA mechanism.
In hot organic solvent, the adsorbed species on the nanoparticle surface play an important role in the crystal growth and have the capability to control the self-assembly model among the primary nanoparticles.30,31 Thus Fourier transform IR (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to analyze the surface capping species and the binding state. The sample for characterizing was processed by extensive washing with chloroform, alcohol and deionized water seven times. As is shown in Fig. S2a,† the FTIR spectrum of the primary nanoparticles is similar to that of OLA molecules adsorbed on inorganic nanocrystals.32,33 In detail, the transmission bands at 2923 and 2853 cm−1 are assigned to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methylene (νas(CH2), νs(CH2)) of the oleic acid molecule. The peak at 3007 cm−1 can be assigned to the ν(C–H) stretch. And the peaks between 1400–1600 cm−1 correspond to the ν(CO) stretch. Surfactants such as OLA molecules adsorbed on colloidal nanocrystals always plays an important role in the self-assembly of nanocrystals,29 and OLA is also the origin of the “steric-hindrance effect” for the occurrence of OA. Fig. S2b† shows the wide-scan XPS survey of the primary nanoparticles. And in the inset, the spectrum for F 1s core electrons shows that the measured binding energy (BE) is 685 eV, which is typical for fluorinated TiO2 systems such as Ti–F species on the TiO2 crystal surface. The high-resolution spectra of the oxidation state of the Ti element (Ti 2p3/2, binding energy 458.8 eV; Ti 2p1/2, binding energy 464.3 eV) can be assigned to that of bulk TiO2. It can be deduced from the above results that OLA and fluorine acted as two distinct surface capping agents in our synthesizing system. OLA molecules selectively adsorb onto the surfaces of (101) or (011) of TiO2 nanocrystals, thus these nanocrystals tend to grow along the [001] direction and eventually form nanorods.34,35 Fluorine ions as atomic surface capping agents would selectively adsorb onto the (001) surface and alter the relative surface free energy of (001) and (101), and cause the exposure of (001) surfaces in the crystal growth. The preferential adsorption of OLA molecules and fluorine onto the exposed (101) and (001) crystal surfaces not only induced the formation of truncated nanobipyramidals during the growth of primary nanoparticles, but also influenced their assembly model.
Accordingly, we propose the following formation process for the TiO2 nanochains (Scheme 1): step 1 is dominated by the OR mechanism. During the stage of B–C1 or B–C2, increased by Brownian motion, the nanoparticles would move and collide with each other. The primary nanoparticles were enclosed by (101) and (001) facets, thus they would collide in forms of C1 (collide with 001 facets) and C2 (collide with 101 facets). The distance between the nanocrystals is determined by the layer of surface surfactants around the nanocrystal core. Thus the steric-hindrance effect in the case of C1 is weaker than C2. Straight after the C1, driven by minimizing the total surface energy, the colliding nanoparticles would fuse with each other in [001] direction and form secondary particles (stage D). As the reaction went on, more particles attached to one another and the nanochains were elongated in the stage D to E.

To understand which factors facilitate the OA is still a challenge. In this study, we find that hydroxyl groups are very important for controlling the oriented attachment of anatase nanochains. Fig. 2a–f shows the TEM images for representative samples, illustrating the dependence of the length of anatase chains on the amount of H2O. When no H2O was added, the products were found to be unattached (Fig. 2a). As trace water was added, as shown in Fig. 2b, a portion of epitaxially attached particles (constituted by two or three primary nanoparticles) were observed. With further increase in the amount of H2O, the length of the nanochains was gradually elongated, as is shown in Fig. 2c and d. When the addition of H2O increased to 67.2 mmol, as is shown in Fig. 2e and f, a large quantity of nanochains with lengths of about 20 monomers can be clearly observed. And due to the relative high aspect ratio (length to width ratio), the nanochains in Fig. 2e self-assembled into a bundle structure with side-by-side alignment. Phenomenally, it clearly shows that increasing the addition of H2O increased the length of the nanochains, and H2O seems to be a key factor to accelerate the occurrence of OA. Yang and co-workers illustrated that Ti–O–Ti linkages could be formed via condensation between Ti–OH on the (001) surface.36 The dissociative adsorption induces hydroxyl groups on the (001) surface, and they provide a potential active site for particle attachment.37,38 In order to further confirm the effect of hydroxyl groups, we replaced H2O with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and n-propanol (C3H7OH). Fig. S3† shows that when the H2O was replaced by ethanol or n-propanol, nanochains also formed. This demonstrates the hydroxyl group is the critical factor for controlling the length of the nanochains. The morphology of primary nanoparticles is another factor that influences the occurrence of oriented attachment. Anatase nanorods and quasi-spherical nanoparticles (as is shown in Fig. S4†) were also utilized as primary nanoparticles in this research. However, the event of OA was not observed under TEM characterization. The exposure of flat (001) facets is essential for the occurrence of OA in this case.

The porous photoanode is a key component for highly efficient DSSCs, and it serves as the loading site for the dye and the vehicle for the transport of electrons.39 In the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the selection of components and the design of photoanode structures. The electron transport in the photoanode is determined by trapping/detrapping events.40 The existence of a large amount of grain boundaries would greatly increase the electron scattering and limit the power conversion efficiency. To enhance the electron transport properties is an important topic in the research of DSSCs. 1-D nanostructures with a single crystalline feature are regarded as a solution to this problem. The electron transport inside the particle is faster than the interparticle transport, and the e−/h+ recombination would be reduced.21 However compared to typical nanoparticles, the dye adsorption site in the 1-D single crystalline structure is reduced resulting in a decreased photocurrent density.41 In this research, we combined the advantages of particles and nanochains together to produce a nanochain–nanoparticle based photoanode. The TiO2 nanocrystals in the paste were compounded with nanoparticles (prepared in the absence of water after step (1) and nanochains (prepared with 67.2 mmol H2O after step (2), and the mass percent of nanochain in the photoanode was defined as a variable X (from 0% to 100%). The paste was deposited on to the cleaned FTO-coated glass by a doctor-blade method. Then TiO2 electrodes were sintered in air at 500 °C for 30 min. All the photoanodes have a thickness of 17 μm and have an active area of 0.25 cm2.
The performances of DSSCs were examined under standard illumination test conditions. Fig. S5† displays the relevant photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the as-fabricated cells. The fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuits current density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (η) are shown in Table S1.† And the conversion efficiency (η) versus composition (X) is depicted in Fig. 3. Compared with the pure nanoparticle-based cells, a remarkable enhancement in the conversion efficiency (from 4.20% to 7.46%) was observed in the cell when 30% of nanochains were added. A photoanode made by Degussa's P25 TiO2 nanoparticles was fabricated as a reference, and the conversion efficiency was 5.20%. The charge collection in the photoanode is highly dependent on the morphology of TiO2 nanostructures. Nanochains in the photoanode decreased the electron scattering in boundaries, and limited the recombination on the grain boundaries. Thus the electron transport inside the 1-D nanochain was faster than the interparticle transport. The PL emission spectra in Fig. S6† shows the TiO2 films with nanochains have weaker emission, which indicates the decrease in the recombination rate of electron and hole during the electron transport. Scheme 2 illustrates the electron transport of nanoparticle-based and nanochain–nanoparticle based DSSCs respectively. The 1-D nanostructure gives a shorter average pathlength before collection for photo-generated electrons. It has been reported that the dye loading on 1-D nanocrystal based photoanodes is lower than particle based ones because of the lower surface area.42–44 The UV–vis spectra also show less adsorbed dye molecules on TiO2 films containing nanochains (Fig. S7†). In line with this, we observed that further increase in the nanochain content resulted in a decrease in the conversion efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that length tunable anatase nanochains can be produced via a two-step strategy. We investigated the kinetic conditions, synthesis components and the morphology of primary nanoparticles to study the factors that facilitate oriented attachment. The key parameter for controlling the length of nanochains is the amount of H2O added in the OA process. Furthermore, by virtue of their single-crystalline nature, nanochains could enhance the electron collection property for dye-sensitized solar cells. We believe that, this approach opens a door for controllable oriented attachment, and it is meaningful for designing novel nanoarchitectures.
