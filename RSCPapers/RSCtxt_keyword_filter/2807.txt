    , Accepted 15th December 2020First published on 16th December 2020AbstractIn Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 photovoltaic devices, the exceptionally high density of 2CuZn + SnZn donor defects may induce bandgap fluctuations and thus limit Voc and PCE enhancement. We have previously reported that the partial substitution of Ag for Cu in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 provides a promising way to effectively suppress CuZn defects and considerably enhance the cell performance for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 photovoltaic devices. However, the bandgap fluctuations and detrimental band tailing fundamentally still limit cell performance. On the basis of a Ag-substituted CZTSSe system, in this paper, we demonstrate that partially substituting Zn with Mn could be a feasible tactic to pronouncedly decrease the bandgap fluctuations and prevent detrimental band tailing. Our in-depth investigation reveals that Mn substitution could increase depletion width, decrease the defect densities of the CuZn acceptor and 2CuZn + SnZn donor, and enable grain boundary (GB) inversion in a (Cu,Ag)2ZnSn(S,Se)4-based cell. As a result, an impressive PCE of 11.81% was achieved when the Mn substitution level was 10%, with a Voc of 478 mV, a Jsc of 37.89 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.23%. This is so far the highest efficiency among Mn-substituted CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices. By thoroughly understanding these photoelectric properties of the CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices, we believe that the breakthrough in device efficiency will come soon through our continuous efforts.
1 Introduction
Kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films are promising absorber materials for semiconductor photovoltaic devices.1–7 In comparison with other competing photovoltaic materials, such as silicon (Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS),8–12 CZTSSe absorber materials exhibit various intrinsic advantages, such as low toxicity, low cost, and earth abundance. However, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved for a CZTSSe-based photovoltaic device was only 12.62% in 2019.13 While its counterpart, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), frequently broke the PCE record of 20% in the last few years.14–16 This performance disparity could be attributed to several factors, including high concentrations of antisite defects and defect complexes,17–21 associated bandgap fluctuations and bandgap tail states,19,22–24 and less passive grain boundaries,25–27 among others. All of these cases often lead to high carrier recombination losses and eventually result in lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) and PCE of the photovoltaic devices.
Extensive process optimization efforts have been made to improve the performance of CZTSSe solar cells, such as isoelectronic cation substitution,5,24,28–44 gradient structure formation,30,45,46 and addition of alkali impurities.25–28,47,48 Specifically, theoretical and experimental studies show that distant cation substitution, such as substitution of Ag for Cu,24,28–33 Ba for Zn,22,34–36 Cd for Zn,37–40 and Mn for Zn,41–44 can effectively reduce the density of CuZn antisite defects. However, the SnZn antisite defects and the associated defect clusters have rarely been considered in these studies. It is well established that these SnZn antisite defects and the associated defect clusters may be the primary reasons why CZTSSe-based devices have not yet achieved their upper limit.49 Therefore, seeking a versatile approach for suppressing the SnZn defects and the associated defect clusters as well as alleviating the current limitation of CZTSSe-based absorber films is especially important for further improving the photovoltaic performance of CZTSSe devices.
We have previously performed a series of experiments to investigate the role of Ag substitution in CZTSSe-based solar cells.29–31 The results proved that the incorporation of Ag into CZTSSe-based devices could suppress the formation of CuZn defects as well as significantly improve the device performance. Nevertheless, SnZn antisite defects and the associated defect clusters were not considered in these reports.
In this paper, the transition metal element Mn was introduced into a Ag-based CZTSSe system to partially substitute Zn and form the (Cu,Ag)2(Zn,Mn)Sn(S,Se)4 (CAZMTSSe) alloy. Among the promising +2 valence cations, such as Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn, the Mn element exhibits several intrinsic advantages, such as earth abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness, in addition to being the most stable at oxidation state +2.41–43 By employing a series of characterization methods, such as SIMS, TEM, ICP-OES, XPS, XRD and Raman, we proved that Mn2+ was incorporated into the host lattice of CAZTSSe by substitution of Zn2+ and the valence state of Mn was +2. When the ratio of Mn/(Zn + Mn) is 10%, the photovoltaic device achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.81%, with a Jsc of 37.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 478 mV, and an FF of 65.23%. In-depth analysis results show that Mn substitution can effectively decrease the bandgap fluctuations and reduce the detrimental band tailing, which can be mainly ascribed to the decreased defect densities of the CuZn acceptor and 2CuZn + SnZn donor. Additionally, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements suggest that Mn substitution enables grain boundary (GBs) inversion, leading to the collection of the electrons toward the GBs and thus improving the collection efficiency of photo-generated electrons. Our results provide a new view to suppress bulk defects and the associated band tailing as well as change the transport path of photon-generated carriers for multinary compound semiconductors by cation substitution.
2 Experimental methods
2.1 Materials
Tin(II) acetate (C4H6O4Sn, ≥98.5%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Copper(I) acetate (C2H3O2Cu, 99.99%), zinc acetate (C4H6O4Zn, 99%), silver acetate (C2H3O2Ag, 99.95%), manganese acetate (C4H6O4Mn, 98%), selenium (Se), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), thiourea (NH2CSNH2), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), carbon disulfide (CS2), 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2), and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%) were purchased from Aladdin Co.
2.2 Preparation of precursor solutions, thin films and photovoltaic devices
The precursor solutions were prepared according to the procedure described in another publication.29 It should be noted that thioglycolic acid was excluded from the solution system in this work. The other solvents and the corresponding feeding ratios were the same as before.29 On the other hand, Cu-poor and Zn-rich stoichiometries, (Ag + Cu)/(Zn + Mn + Sn) = 0.80 and (Zn + Mn)/Sn = 1.22, were employed as in our previous reports.29–31 To investigate the effect of Mn substitution on the performance of photovoltaic devices, precursor solutions with Mn/(Zn + Mn) ratios of 0 at%, 5 at%, 10 at%, 15 at%, 20 at%, and 25 at% were prepared.
The preparation and selenization processes of the absorber thin films were consistent with our previous reports.29 It is worth noting that, in this work, a precursor thin film with a thickness of ∼1.2 μm was obtained by repeating five spin-coating/sintering cycles. Additionally, the photovoltaic devices were fabricated according to the standard structure as published previously.29–31
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), current density–voltage (J–V) curve measurements, external quantum efficiency (EQE) analysis, capacitance–voltage (C–V) curve measurements, capacitance-mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were all performed as described in our previous papers.29–31 In addition, the elemental distribution across the CAZTSSe-based films was measured using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Titan G2 60-300) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system.
3 Results and discussion
Recently, we reported a facile and feasible strategy to significantly enhance the crystallinity of (Cu0.95Ag0.05)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 CAZTSSe thin films by employing acetate starting materials.29 On the basis of our previous studies, we herein explore the influence of Mn substitution on CAZTSSe absorber surface electrical characteristics, defect formation and subsequent device properties. A relatively high substitution content of Mn was reported to be able to increase the non-radiative electron–hole recombination,41 and thus in this paper, the CAZTSSe-based devices with Mn/(Zn + Mn) ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 were investigated. For the sake of discussion, the corresponding thin films and solar cells were then labelled S-Ref, S-5, S-10, S-15, S-20, and S-25, respectively.
To examine the effect of Mn substitution on the photovoltaic performance of (Cu0.95Ag0.05)2(Zn1−xMnx)Sn(S,Se)4 solar cells, photovoltaic devices with the standard structure of soda-lime glass/Mo/CAZMTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag were prepared. The statistical distributions of the photovoltaic performance characteristics for (Cu0.95Ag0.05)2(Zn1−xMnx)Sn(S,Se)4 solar cells with Mn content varying from 0 to 0.25 are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table S1.† The results are the average values obtained from 20 solar cells with standard deviation. The highest efficiency in this study was yielded at x = 0.10 ((Cu0.95Ag0.05)2(Zn0.90Mn0.10)Sn(S,Se)4). It was noted that as the Mn content increased from 0 to 0.10, the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE increased monotonically. However, when the Mn content increased from 0.10 to 0.25, all device parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, decreased abruptly instead of increasing. The reduction in device performance for a relatively high amount of Mn substitution may be ascribed to the increase of non-radiative recombination and the decrease of carrier lifetime, which have been mentioned in a previous publication.41 Hereinafter, we focus on the comparison of properties by comparing the 0% (S-Ref) and 10% (S-10) Mn-substituted CAZMTSSe thin films and solar cells to better understand the origin of the improvement in Jsc and Voc.

Fig. 2a and b show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) top-view and cross-sectional images of the as-prepared CAZTSSe-based thin film. It can be observed that a smooth and extremely uniform precursor thin film with a thickness of ∼1.2 μm was obtained after repeating spin-coating/sintering cycles five times. This is relatively thinner than the absorber films in our previous work (∼1.5 μm),29 which originated from the further optimization of the thickness of absorber films in this experiment as mentioned in the Experimental section. It is noteworthy that the selenized S-Ref and S-10 samples show similar SEM top view (Fig. 2c and e) and cross-sectional images (Fig. 2d and f). Both samples demonstrate a closely packed and crack-free surface topography with a grain size of up to ∼2 μm, and the grains extend throughout the whole absorber layer thickness without voids. This result explicitly indicates that Mn substitution has no significant effect on the morphology of the CAZTSSe-based thin film in this study.

The elemental depth profiles of the selenized CAZTSSe-based thin films were obtained using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3a and b. SIMS results revealed that the Mn element homogeneously distributed in the whole absorber layer, and it has a similar depth profile to other elements, such as Cu, Ag, Zn, and Sn. Moreover, the intensity of the depth profiles for Cu, Ag, and Sn elements has not shown significant change in all of the samples. But for the Zn element, the intensity demonstrates a slight decrease in the S-10 sample compared to the S-Ref sample, which may be ascribed to the partial substitution of Zn with Mn in the S-10 sample. The CAZTSSe-based thin films were further characterized by HR-TEM measurements to study the Mn distribution in more detail along the thickness, as displayed in Fig. 4. It is clear that for the reference sample (positions I and II, Fig. 4b and c), the space of the lattice line was measured as 0.330 nm. However, for the Mn-substituted sample, the value was about 0.339 nm (positions III and IV, Fig. 4e and f). The increase of d-spacing in the Mn-substituted sample was ascribed to the partial substitution of smaller Zn2+ (rZn2+ = 0.074 nm) with larger Mn2+ (rMn2+ = 0.080 nm).44 In addition, the TEM/EELS results (Fig. S1†) also demonstrated that the Mn element is homogeneously distributed in the whole absorber bulk.

ICP-OES analysis, as exhibited in Tables S2 and S3,† was carried out using the selenized S-Ref and S-10 samples shown in Fig. 2 to explore the complete chemical compositional ratio of the final CAZTSSe-based absorber thin films with and without Mn substitution. It can be observed that all of the samples produced similar Cu-poor and Zn-rich results, that is, the constituent element ratios of (Cu + Ag)/(Zn + Mn + Sn) and (Zn + Mn)/Sn for the two samples are about 0.81, and 1.24, respectively, while the Mn/(Mn + Zn) ratio in the S-10 sample is 0.100. These results indicated that the real composition ratios in the resulting absorber films are consistent with the corresponding feeding ratios in the precursor solutions as mentioned in the Experimental section.
The valence states of the CAZTSSe-based thin films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 3c–g. As expected, the typical Mn 2p peaks of the Mn-substituted thin films appear at 641.8 eV (2p3/2) and 652.2 eV (2p1/2), confirming that Mn ions are incorporated into the CAZTSSe-based thin film lattices and the valence state of Mn is +2.50–52 In addition, Fig. 3d–g clearly show that the Cu 2p, Ag 3d, Zn 2p, and Sn 3d peak positions of the S-Ref sample and S-10 sample are allocated to +1, +1, +2, and +4 states, respectively.29
The phase structure of the CAZTSSe-based absorbers was determined by XRD, and the results are displayed in Fig. 3h. It was noted that the diffraction peaks of the Mn-substituted film match well with those of the reference sample. Peaks located at 29.66° should be related to the residual selenium on the surface of the films,31,53 and the peaks at 40.12° correspond to the Mo back contact.29,53 In addition, the other four peaks can be assigned to the (112), (204)/(220), (312)/(116), and (008) lattice planes of the kesterite CZTSSe tetragonal phase (JCPDS 26-0575),29–31,53 respectively. The inset of Fig. 3h shows the enlarged view of the (112) lattice planes for the CAZTSSe-based samples, and it is clear that the peaks slightly shift toward smaller diffraction angles from 27.27 to 27.19°. This result can be attributed to the replacement of smaller Zn2+ (rZn2+ = 0.074 nm) with larger Mn2+ (rMn2+ = 0.080 nm),44 thereby leading to the expansion of the crystal lattice. In order to verify this, the lattice constants a and c were derived from the XRD data (using JADE software) in line with the literature method,54 as displayed in Tables S4 and S5† (five samples for each group). It is evident that the lattice constants of the Mn substituted sample (a = 5.687 Å and c = 11.328 Å) are slightly larger than those of the reference sample (a = 5.667 Å and c = 11.317 Å), which proves the existence of Mn ions in the CAZTSSe host lattices. These results are consistent with previous studies of Mn-substituted CZTSSe-based thin films.41 Consequently, both the XPS and XRD results demonstrate that Mn ions are successfully incorporated into the CAZTSSe lattice by replacement of Zn2+.
Furthermore, Raman scattering with the excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm was conducted as an auxiliary method to further detect the purity of the obtained absorber thin films. As displayed in Fig. 3i, the main Raman peaks located at 172, 197, and 234 cm−1 should be attributed to the kesterite-based CZTSe composition,29–31 while the other peak, located at 329 cm−1, was related to the kesterite CZTS phase.29–31 Additionally, no other peaks appeared in the two samples.

Fig. 5a and Table 1 show the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimal photovoltaic devices with and without Mn substitution, labelled the S-10 sample and S-Ref sample, respectively. The Mn-substituted device yielded the highest efficiency of 11.81% (1.36% higher than that of the reference device), with improvements of Jsc from 36.34 mA cm−2 to 37.89 mA cm−2, Voc from 451 mV to 478 mV, and FF from 63.73% to 65.23%. The enhancement in device overall performance may be primarily ascribed to the reduced cationic disorder in Mn-substituted CAZTSSe-based devices. The detailed explanation will be given in the following sections.

To elucidate the loss mechanisms of the champion photovoltaic device, the diode parameters, such as series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh), diode quality factors (A), and reverse saturation current density (J0), were extracted from the dark J–V curves (Fig. 5a) using the Lambert-W function fitting method.55 The detailed calculation process is shown in Fig. S2,† and the results are listed in Table 1. It was noted that for the S-10 device, all the diode parameters were superior to those of the S-Ref sample. The relatively small Rs and comparatively large Rsh could be a result of decreased carrier recombination and reduction of defect density in the S-10 device. These enhancements in Rs and Rsh eventually result in the enhanced Jsc, Voc, and FF. Additionally, compared with the S-Ref device, the S-10 sample shows relatively small A and J0. This indicates relatively low recombination in the space charge region (SCR), which thereby facilitates the enhancement of the Voc and FF of the photovoltaic device.
As evident from the EQE plots presented in Fig. 5b, the EQE absorption exhibits an overall enhancement in the whole absorbing region, which explains the increase in Jsc. Meanwhile, in comparison with the reference CAZTSSe sample, the Mn-substituted sample exhibits a relatively enhanced response at short wavelength (<600 nm). This result is consistent with that reported in the recent publication.41–43 Additionally, the EQE spectrum shows a relatively sharp cut-off in the region between 1100 and 1200 nm for the Mn-substituted device compared to the S-Ref sample. This steeper transition suggests better band-edge absorption of photons, which can be realized by decreasing the band tailing.35 In order to analyse the band tailing for these samples, the Urbach energy tail (EU) was plotted from the EQE curves by mapping ln(−ln(1 − EQE)) vs. E − Eg.24,37 From Fig. 5c, it is evident that the EU of the Mn-substituted sample is smaller than that of the reference sample. These results imply that the Mn-substituted sample shows a lower level of band tailing than the reference sample. Presumably, the Mn substitution discourages the formation of Mn-related defects, thereby leading to the relative decrease of band tailing in the S-10 sample.
The calculated Jsc values from the EQE plots were 36.01 and 37.26 mA cm−2 for the S-Ref sample and S-10 sample, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the values of the light J–V curve. In terms of bandgap, the Mn-substituted sample (1.059 eV) in this article is similar to the control sample (1.053 eV), as illustrated in the inset figure of Fig. 5b. This result is in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results reported elsewhere.42,56Fig. 5d displays the bandgap fluctuations of the CAZTSSe absorbers, which were characterized using data extracted from EQE curves, following the methods described in detail by Mattheis et al.37,57 It should be noted that for the Mn-substituted sample, the standard deviation (σEg) of the bandgap fluctuation is relatively narrow, with widths of 54 meV for the S-10 sample versus 75 meV for the S-Ref sample. The smaller bandgap fluctuations in the Mn-substituted sample than those in the reference sample may be ascribed to the decrease of defect densities induced by Mn substitution. Hereinafter, we will discuss the defect-related problem caused by Mn substitution in detail.
Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were carried out at room temperature on the CAZTSSe-based samples to further analyze the influence of the Mn substitution on the optoelectronic properties, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6a. The depletion width (χd) and the apparent carrier concentration (Nc–v) were obtained accordingly based on the formula described in detail previously,30,31 as shown in Fig. 6b and Table 2. The Mn-substituted device exhibits a boosted depletion width but a slightly depressed apparent carrier concentration. As it is evident from the data, the depletion width is increased from 219 nm (S-Ref sample) to 263 nm (S-10 sample). In general, a wider depletion region is more beneficial for photo-generated carrier separation in the long wavelength region.58,59 This result corresponds well with the EQE measurement shown in Fig. 5b, and compared with the reference sample, the Mn-substituted sample demonstrates a relatively strong absorption spectrum within the scope of 800–1040 nm. Therefore, it can be concluded that Mn substitution in the absorber bulk of the device can effectively suppress carrier recombination and eventually improve the Voc and FF of the photovoltaic devices. Additionally, the apparent carrier concentration does not change significantly for the S-Ref device (4.21 × 1016 cm−3) and S-10 device (3.99 × 1016 cm−3). These values are in full compliance with the requirements for efficient CZTSSe-based solar cells.60

Capacitance-mode deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) for the champion CAZTSSe-based devices is used to explore the effect of Mn substitution. C-DLTS has been used widely to detect the existence of defects in semiconductors, and the experimental results generally agree well with the theoretical calculation.18,61,62 The measurement was performed in the temperature range of 160 to 380 K, as displayed in Fig. 7a. The reverse bias (VR), pulse voltage (Vp), and pulse width were, respectively, set as 0.2 V, −0.4 V, and 10 ms, in line with our previous experiences.29–31 Three peaks, one located at 200 K (named H1), one located at 260 K (named H2), and the other located at 320 K (named E1), were clearly observed in C-DLTS curves for the two samples, manifesting that three main defects appeared in the test range. Additionally, three narrower peaks were presented in the Mn-substituted sample compared to the reference sample, which hints at a comparatively fast emission rate from the defect centers.62

The corresponding Arrhenius curves were derived from C-DLTS spectra to further obtain the detailed parameters of defects, that is, activation energies (Ea) and trap density (NT), as displayed in Fig. 7b and Table 2. It is reported that the Ea values of 0.10–0.18 eV are always directly related to the CuZn antisite acceptor defects,18,30,62 the Ea values of 0.25–0.38 eV are connected with CuSn antisite acceptor defects,18,62 and the Ea values of 0.20–0.4 eV corresponded well to 2CuZn + SnZn donor defect clusters.17,18 It is well known that these defects are all deep defects,18,62 which are detrimental to the photovoltaic device efficiency. Apparently, for these three types of defects, the defect activation energies of the Mn-substituted device are smaller than those of the reference device. Additionally, for the CuZn antisite acceptor defects, the S-10 sample exhibits lower defect densities than the reference sample. This can be attributed to the larger atomic radius of Mn (0.8 Å) than that of Cu (0.74 Å) and Zn (0.74 Å),44 which discourages the formation of CuMn defects in the Mn-substituted sample and facilitates the reduction of defect density for the CuZn acceptor. As for the CuSn acceptor defects, the defect density is nearly identical for the two samples. This suggests that Mn substitution in the CAZTSSe absorber has no effect on CuSn related defects. Importantly, the 2CuZn + SnZn donor defect clusters are also observed in the two samples. It is distinct that the defect density of 2CuZn + SnZn defect clusters in the Mn-substituted sample is 3.15 × 1013 cm−3, which is almost nine times smaller than the value of the reference sample, 2.82 × 1014 cm−3. These results indicated that the 2CuZn + SnZn defect clusters are suppressed to a larger extent in the Mn-substituted sample than in the reference sample. It is reported that a high concentration of this type of defect will either act as more effective recombination centers for photo-generated carriers18,58,62 or cause a relatively large bandgap fluctuation,17,18 both detrimental to the photovoltaic efficiency. At the same time, it can also explain the relatively narrow bandgap fluctuation of the S-10 sample compared to the S-Ref sample shown in Fig. 5d. Both the decreased defect densities of the CuZn acceptor and 2CuZn + SnZn donor can be ascribed to the incorporation of Mn2+ into the host lattice of CAZTSSe by substitution of Zn2+. As a consequence, a higher device performance is expected. Thus, we can conclude that the Mn ion is responsible for the enhancement of device performance.
Generally, the process of photo-generated carrier recombination has a direct and significant effect on the performance of photovoltaic devices.29,30 In order to evaluate the carrier recombination process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark were designed, as illustrated in Fig. 7c. It is distinct that the main arc of the impedance plot increases for the S-10 sample compared to the S-Ref sample, indicating that the recombination resistance Rct of the Mn-substituted sample is obviously larger than that of the reference device. This is a consequence of the decrease of defect densities. Additionally, the Mn-substituted sample shows a smaller series resistance Rs (corresponding to the intercept of the x-axis) than the reference sample. The increased Rct and decreased Rs eventually reduce the carrier recombination process in the Mn-substituted device.
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a convenient and effective tool for the analysis of the surface potential distribution of thin films,63,64 was carried out on samples with and without Mn substitution. Fig. 8a and e present the surface morphology of the reference sample and the Mn-substituted sample, and show similar results and the results are the same as in Fig. 2. Fig. 8b and f show the surface potential. Apparently, the potential contrast between grain boundaries (GBs) and intragrains (IGs) is larger for the Mn-substituted sample. Fig. 8c and g present the surface potential profiling, which was obtained from the area marked using white lines in Fig. 8a, b, e and f. It is apparent that the average surface potential of GBs in the Mn-substituted sample has a relatively large drop (130 mV) compared to the control sample (105 mV), suggesting a more efficient carrier separation process of the Mn-substituted sample. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that Mn substitution changes the polarity of the electric field at the GBs. That is to say, as occurring in high-efficiency CIGS devices,64–66 in the Mn-substituted sample, a downward band bending-like band structure forms at the GBs and electrons are collected toward the GBs (Fig. 8d). In contrast, for the reference sample, an upward band bending-like band structure forms at and near the GBs (Fig. 8h), and a current path forms along the IGs as holes are collected toward the GBs. The collection path along the GBs in the Mn-substituted sample improves the collection efficiency of photo-generated electrons and consequently restrains the carrier recombination process. These results can also be interpreted by the diode parameter analysis of devices with and without Mn substitution (Fig. S2†). The J0 of the Mn-substituted device is over three times less than that of the reference sample, indicating reduced recombination in the Mn-substituted sample. Meanwhile, the A is decreased from 1.81 to 1.53 after Mn substitution, further confirming the enhanced diode quality.

4 Conclusions
To conclude, we have demonstrated that Mn substitution of Zn in CAZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices has a significant effect on the photovoltaic performances and photoelectric properties. Using a facile precursor solution approach, a series of CAZTSSe-based solar cells with Mn/(Mn + Zn) ratios of 0–25% were fabricated. The highest efficiency of 11.81% was obtained when the Mn substitution level was 10%, which was accompanied by the increase of Voc, Jsc, and FF. The enhancement in overall device performance can be primarily ascribed to the decreased defect densities of the CuZn acceptor and 2CuZn + SnZn donor. Furthermore, the Mn substitution also effectively decreased the bandgap fluctuations and reduced the detrimental band tailing, which may originate from the decreased defect densities in Mn-substituted devices. Interestingly, Mn substitution inverted the electric field at the grain boundaries. The inversion facilitated charge transportation along the GBs, thereby enabling the carrier collection to be enhanced, which in turn resulted in the enhancement of the PCE. Our results indicated that the lower defect densities, smaller bandgap fluctuations and preferable grain boundary properties of the Mn-substituted Ag-based CZTSSe material made it a potential element for high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.
