    , Accepted 11th February 2019First published on 11th February 2019AbstractHole-transport materials (HTMs) play an important role in the most highly performing perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, for the first time, an efficient cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene-based dopant-free D-A-D type hole transport material (HTM) YN3 is developed for application in organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performance. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSCs devices based on YN3 as a dopant-free HTM render very impressive PCEs of 18.84% and 12.05%, respectively. The obtained PCE values of YN3-based PSCs outperform most dopant-free HTMs based on small organic molecules reported so far. More encouragingly, the YN3-based PSCs without encapsulation display good long-term stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have proven to be an attractive alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells owing to their great photo-physical properties, low-cost production, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–6 The recorded PCE of PSCs over 23.2% have been achieved by employing a fluorene-terminated hole-transport material up to now.7 One of the key points resulting in the dramatic development of PSCs is the presence of hole-transport materials (HTM) in the devices, because they can efficiently facilitate the photo-generated holes transport from the perovskite absorber to the back metal electrode, which significantly improves the performance of the devices.8–14 So far, extensive research work has been drawn toward the development of new efficient HTMs for PSC applications, including inorganic semiconductors,15–19 polymers,20–23 and small organic molecules.24–30 Among these materials, PSCs based on small organic HTMs hold the highest device performance. However, most of the organic HTMs in their pristine form reported for perovskite solar cells suffer from unsatisfactory charge transport ability and, therefore, they need to be doped with chemical dopants or additives, such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), thus improving their charge transport properties and device performances. Unfortunately, Li-TFSI has a hygroscopic nature and the tendency to attract moisture from air, leading to quick decomposition of the perovskite film.31–34 On the other hand, t-BP could interact with PbI2 and therefore also accelerate the perovskite decomposition.35–37 Moreover, the aforementioned doping strategy requires much optimization of the doping conditions, which increases the total cost of the PSCs device fabrication. Based on those reasons above, it is highly desirable to develop efficient dopant-free HTMs for the long-term stability of PSCs.
Donor (D)–acceptor (A)–donor (D) type functional materials have been extensively used in organic field-effect transistors and organic solar cells owing to their facile synthesis procedures, low-lying HOMO energy levels, and impressive hole-mobility.38–40 Therefore, D–A–D organic small molecules are appropriate choices as HTMs for PSC applications. Recently, our group devised a new D–A–D HTM YN2 featuring an electron-withdrawing thienopyrazine unit (TP) as the core structure; YN2-based PSCs achieved PCEs of up to 19.27%.28 To date, a number of highly planar π-conjugated HTMs have been reported in PSCs, and these studies have proved that HTMs with planar cores are more helpful for enhancing the hole transporting capability and photovoltaic performance in PSCs in comparison to HTMs with non-planar cores.41–43 Thus, the aforementioned results show that the D–A–D molecular system with a planar configuration could be a promising strategy for designing new dopant-free HTMs.
Cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene comprises a large planar aromatic π-conjugation structure, which can be advantageous for the intermolecular π–π interactions that lead to ordered morphology in solid thin films, thereby enhancing charge transporting.44–46 Additionally, cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene is a molecular fragment of C70 and behaves similarly to fullerenes in exhibiting high electron affinities.47,48 Thus, cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene as an electron-acceptor can endow the HTM with a low-lying HOMO energy level,49 which is beneficial for achieving a high Voc in PSCs. Inspired by these findings, we introduce cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene as the core to construct a new dopant-free D–A–D type HTM (YN3), which features a cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene core as the acceptor and bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine as the donor. The YN3-based HTMs exhibit good conductivity and hole-extraction/transport ability, making the material suitable as an efficient HTM for PSCs. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSC device based on YN3 as a dopant-free HTM renders a very impressive PCE of 18.84% with small hysteresis, which is higher than that of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based reference device (18.41%) under the same working conditions. The CsPbI2Br solar cell based on YN3-HTM showed a PCE of 12.05%, exceeding the reference Spiro-OMeTAD-based cell with a PCE of 11.51%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-spiro-type dopant-free HTM showing superior performances to that of Spiro-OMeTAD in both organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic PSCs (Fig. 1).

Results and discussion
The synthetic procedure for YN3 is shown in Scheme S1.† Briefly, 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)aniline was coupled with 2,7-dibromocyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene in a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction to obtain YN3 in 90% yield and very high purity. The HTM YN3 exhibited good solubility in general organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, THF and chlorobenzene.
The UV-vis spectra for YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding photophysical data are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of YN3 exhibits a maximum absorption peak at 645 nm, which can be attributed to the introduction of the strong electron-withdrawing cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene group into the molecular backbone, leading to an enhancement of the intermolecular charge transition (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor. On the other hand, the UV-vis spectrum of the YN3 thin-film is redshifted by 52 nm in comparison to that of YN3 in solution, suggesting that YN3 has good capability to form intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid-state thin film through the π-conjugated backbone of cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene, that leads to favorable enhancement of charge transporting.50 The structure of HTM YN3 was further analyzed by density functional theory (DFT). As depicted in Fig. 2b, the electron density distribution at the HOMO of YN3 is predominantly delocalized across the whole molecule, while that of the LUMO is localized on the acceptor moiety. It is clearly shown that the well-delocalized orbital overlap between the HOMO and LUMO suggests that YN3 may have a good hole-transfer transition.25,51,52 The calculated hole reorganization energy (ER) of YN3 is 242 meV, which is lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (495 meV), indicating that YN3 as a HTM may show faster hole-transport ability in PSC devices.

Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTMs are crucial parameters for PSCs applications, differential pulsed voltammetry was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of YN3 (Fig. 2c), the data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3b, the HOMO–LUMO levels suggest that YN3 as a HTM should work well in PSCs. The HOMO energy level of YN3 is determined to be −5.31 eV, which is much more positive than that of perovskite material (−5.65 eV), allowing effective perovskite-generated holes transfer from the perovskite layer into the HTM YN3 layer. Encouragingly, YN3 shows a fairly low-lying HOMO level, which is beneficial for achieving high Voc in PSCs, because the Voc of solar cells is theoretically proportional to the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in the TiO2 and the HOMO energy level of the HTM.11,25 Besides, the LUMO value of YN3 (−3.77 eV) is sufficiently higher than that of perovskite (−4.05 eV), which should guarantee blocking of the undesired electron transport from perovskite to the Au counter electrode, thus reducing the carrier recombination rate.11,53,54

Hole-mobility and conductivity are very important parameters for a new HTM applied in PSCs. Here, the hole-mobility of the YN3 was measured by a space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) analysis and its conductivity was investigated by a four-contact electrical conductivity setup (Fig. 4).11 The relevant data are collected in Table 1. Obviously, the hole-mobility and conductivity of dopant-free YN3 were 2.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.98 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, which are higher than that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD (1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.78 × 10−4 S cm−1). The higher mobility and conductivity of YN3 should be ascribed to the introduction of the cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene unit expected to enhance the backbone π-coplanarity, leading to more efficient intermolecular π–π stacking in YN3-based HTM films. Therefore, these results clearly indicate that YN3 may be a suitable candidate HTM for PSCs.

The device architecture (FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au) is schematically depicted in Fig. 3a. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs based on YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic characteristic data are tabulated in Table 2. The solar cell based on YN3 as a dopant-free HTM produced a PCE of 18.84% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.43 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75. Under the same working conditions, the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based cell exhibited a slightly lower PCE of 18.41% with a Voc of 1.11 V, Jsc of 22.41 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.74, whereas the dopant-free Spiro-OMeTAD-based cell showed an inferior PCE of 9.34% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 20.64 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.54, which is mainly ascribed to the low intrinsic conductivity and high charge-transport resistance of the non-doped Spiro-OMeTAD film. As expected, YN3 yields a higher PCE than doped Spiro-OMeTAD which is mainly ascribed to the higher Voc and FF. The slightly higher Voc of YN3-based devices should be attributed to the much deeper HOMO energy level, and the higher charge-carrier mobility and conductivity of YN3 are responsible for its higher Jsc and FF. The superior PSCs efficiency indicates that YN3 is a promising candidate to replace Spiro-OMeTAD in high-performing perovskite solar cells with eliminated hysteresis (Fig. S6†). The integrated photocurrent densities derived from the IPCE spectra are 21.51 mA cm−2 and 21.22 mA cm−2 for YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 5b), respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the experimental J–V curves. In addition, the stabilized photocurrent density of 21.34 mA cm−2 and 21.03 mA cm−2 were recorded for YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively (Fig. S7†), confirming the reliable high PSC device performance. Moreover, the stability PCEs of 18.26% and 18.03% for PSC devices based on YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, were measured at the maximum power point (Fig. S8†). The histograms of PCEs and the statistical average of parameters are displayed in Fig. S9,† which demonstrated a good reproducibility for those PSCs using YN3-based HTM.

Subsequently, we also fabricated all-inorganic PSCs based on YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD with a device configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/HTMs/Au. Their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5c. The YN3-based device yielded a PCE of 12.05%, with a Jsc of 14.94 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.12 V and a FF of 0.72. These values are superior to the device prepared using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM: a PCE of 11.51%, with a Jsc of 14.61 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V and a FF of 0.71 were achieved under the same conditions. Moreover, the champion YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based CsPbI2Br PSCs showed stabilized PCEs of 11.87% and 11.13%, respectively. The integrated current densities estimated from the IPCE spectra presented in Fig. 5d are 13.91 mA cm−2 and 13.48 mA cm−2 for YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which match well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. Fig. S10† provides the histogram of PCEs. All-inorganic PSCs based on YN3 as a HTM exhibited excellent reproducibility. Clearly, our present results demonstrate that the HTM YN3 exhibited good photovoltaic performance in PSCs.
To study their capability to efficiently extract holes at the materials interface, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed on the glass/perovskite/YN3 architecture. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, it is quite clear that the PL emission of the bare perovskite layer was significantly quenched when the YN3 was deposited onto the top of the perovskite film. And dopant-free YN3, doped YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD show quenching values of 91%, 93% and 88%, respectively. The result reflects that the dopant-free YN3 HTM layer has much more efficient hole-extraction and transfer capabilities than Spiro-OMeTAD. To further understand the charge-transport kinetics in the PSC devices based on the different HTMs, the transient photocurrent decay was measured by applying a small-modulation of light intensity (100 mW cm−2) onto the PSC devices under the short-circuit condition, and then recording the photocurrent decay time. Considering that the different PSC devices only differ in HTM layers, the photocurrent decay kinetics can provide direct information on the charge-transport capacity of the HTM film.55,56 As shown in Fig. 6b, YN3-based devices exhibit a faster photocurrent decay response than those of doped Spiro-OMeTAD and non-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, demonstrating more efficient charge-transport capacity in YN3-based devices, which can be related to the resulting better performance in PSCs.

Long-term stability is a vital issue for the PSCs. Fig. 6c shows the stability test of the PSCs based on YN3 and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs (humidity of about 40–45% and temperature of 25 °C). After 300 hours, the PSCs employing YN3 as a dopant-free HTM all exhibit good stability. The PCEs of the YN3-based hybrid organic–inorganic and all-inorganic PSCs were operational with 92% and 97% performance retention, respectively. In the same working conditions, the devices based on doped Spiro-OMeTAD kept around 57% of the initial efficiency. Therefore, it can be concluded that YN3-based cells exhibited better stability than that for doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which most likely can be attributed to the absence of additives (Li-TFSI and t-BP) and the smooth HTM-YN3 film formation acting as a moisture and oxygen barrier (Fig. 6e). It is noted that some particles are visible in the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM layer (Fig. 6f), leading to the formation of some pinholes in the Spiro-OMeTAD thin film, which is not beneficial for the long-term stability and performance of Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. However, YN3 produces an extraordinarily homogeneous HTM layer on the surface of the perovskite without any observable particles, validating its excellent film-forming capability. These results demonstrate that it is highly desirable to develop efficient dopant-free HTMs for the long-term stability of PSCs.
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a D–A–D type small-molecule material as a dopant-free HTM for organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. The YN3-based HTMs exhibit good conductivity and hole-extraction/transport ability, rendering the material suitable as an excellent HTM without doping for PSCs. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSC devices based on YN3 as a dopant-free HTM achieve very impressive PCEs of 18.84% and 12.05%, respectively, both of which are much higher than that of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based reference devices (18.41% and 11.51%) under the same working conditions. Moreover, the YN3-based PSCs without encapsulation display good long-term stability. Our present work provides new insights into further optimizing D–A–D type dopant-free HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs in the future.
