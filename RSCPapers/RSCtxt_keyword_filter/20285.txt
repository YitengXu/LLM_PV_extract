    , Accepted 18th March 2019First published on 19th March 2019AbstractThe possibility to employ carbon nanodots (CNDs) in solar devices was exploited by combining them with a fulleropyrrolidine derivative (FP2). The interaction between the two species was promoted by the presence of opposite electrostatic charges on CNDs (negatively charged) and FP2 (positively charged). The supramolecular dyad CNDs/FP2 generation was induced at the air/water interface of a Langmuir trough: water soluble CNDs were dissolved in the subphase and FP2 chloroform solution was spread on the subphase; the electrostatic interaction promoted the formation of the supramolecular adduct FP2/CNDs, which was then transferred onto solid substrates. Photo-induced charge transfer was promoted in the FP2/CNDs dyad and we demonstrated that the presence of CNDs increased the short-circuit current density, under light illumination, of a porphyrin–FP2/CNDs thin film by about 300% when compared with a more traditional porphyrin–FP2 solar device.
Introduction
Several studies carried out on carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene sheets,1,2 onion-like carbon,3,4 nanodiamonds,5,6 carbon nanotubes,7,8 fullerenes9,10 and carbon nanodots (CNDs)11,12 have highlighted their multifaceted properties, proposing them as possible candidates for a wide variety of applications.13 Among them, CNDs with tuneable fluorescence emission14 have attracted the attention of many researchers since they allowed to propose such a material for bioimaging and biosensing applications. Tuneable fluorescence is a common characteristic of CNDs and of the well-known semiconductor quantum dots such as CdSe, CdTe and PbS.15 In contrast to inorganic quantum dots, CNDs are not dangerous to human health and the use of heavy metals is not required for their production.16–19
Moreover, the possibility to employ CNDs as a hole transporter material in solar cells was evaluated.20 CNDs showed interesting properties as electron donors and electron acceptors, which makes them suitable for photocatalysis applications and sensing device preparation21 as well as photoabsorption agents, sensitizers and transport layer material in silicon-based hybrid solar cells,22 and also, in combination with TiO2,23,24 in the presence of inorganic quantum dots,25 dyes26 and organic polymers27 in solar devices.28,29
In the present work, the formation of a supramolecular adduct between a double positively charged fulleropyrrolidine derivative (FP2) and negatively charged CNDs was promoted both in solution and at the air–water interface in a Langmuir trough.30 The supramolecular adduct was transferred by the Langmuir–Schaefer method30 employing the electrostatic interaction between the amphiphilic FP2 and the water soluble CNDs. The dyad fulleropyrrolidine derivative/carbon nanodots was characterized in solution by UV-Vis, FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Also, the dyad's floating films were studied using surface pressure vs. area per molecule Langmuir isotherms, reflection spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy. Afterwards, films of the dyad samples were transferred to diverse solid substrates for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission investigations. Finally, the photo-induced charge transfer phenomenon in the Langmuir–Schaefer FP2/CNDs dyad was studied using a home-made ITO/(active layer)/I−, I3−/Pt-ITO cell. The presence of CNDs improved the charge transfer efficiency and the short-circuit current density under light illumination of a porphyrin–FP2/CNDs thin film is enhanced by 300% if compared with a more traditional porphyrin–FP2 solar device.
Methods
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without purification. Milli-Q grade (18.2 mΩ cm resistivity) water was used in all the Langmuir experiments. The commercial porphyrin derivative 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine (referred to as TPyP hereafter) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification (the chemical structure is reported in Fig. S1†). A double positively charged amphiphilic fulleropyrrolidine (referred to as FP2 hereafter) was synthesized in accordance with the procedure reported by Mateo-Alonso and co-workers31 and its chemical structure is reported in Fig. S2.†
Synthesis of carbon nanodots
CNDs were prepared according to the method reported by Dong and co-workers:32 3 mL of ethanolamine were mixed with 4.5 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide and the solution was heated at 250 °C in air for 7 min. Because of the oxidant action, the colour of the ethanolamine solution changed from colourless to bright yellow after the addition of H2O2. The reaction product was cooled at room temperature and dispersed in 200 mL distilled water. The CND solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PETE hydrophilic filter, centrifuged at 8000 rpm (9900 rcf) using a Hettich Mikro 120 Benchtop Centrifuge for one hour and the supernatant was recovered thereafter. The solution was stored in the dark at 4 °C for further use.
Carbon nanodot characterization
CNDs, TPyP and FP2 were characterized by FTIR, UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. Infrared characterization was performed using a PerkinElmer Spectrum One instrument in the ATR (Attenuated Total Reflection) mode and 64 scans were acquired in the range of 4000–800 cm−1 for each sample.
A Varian Cary 5000 instrument was used to record the UV-visible spectra of the species both in solution and thin films on solid quartz substrates.
Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Horiba FluoroLog instrument.
ζ-Potential measurements of samples dissolved in ultrapure water were performed using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; also known as Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis, ESCA) was performed using a SPECS SAGE HR 100 system equipped with a 100 mm mean radius PHOIBOS analyzer with a MgKα X-ray source. To carry out the XPS investigation, CNDs were deposited on titanium coated glass substrates. Finally, the XPS spectra were analyzed and deconvoluted by using the CasaXPS software.
Low-magnification TEM analysis of CNDs and FP2/CNDs dyads was performed using a JEOL JEM-1011 instrument (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 100 kV and equipped with a CCD camera (Gatan Orius 831). FP2/CNDs dyad samples for investigation were deposited via a LS procedure employing carbon-coated Cu grids as collecting substrates. Subsequently, the specimens were dried at 60 °C overnight before analysis.
Langmuir trough experiments
The supramolecular dyad FP2/CNDs was assembled at the air/aqueous subphase interface. A NIMA trough apparatus (area of 415 cm2) was used in the Langmuir experiment. Amphiphilic and pseudo amphiphilic species, FP2 and TPyP respectively, were spread from a chloroform solution onto the surface of the subphase using a gas-tight syringe. After the solvent evaporation, in a typical Langmuir experiment,33 two Teflon-made barriers that graze the subphase surface were moved at a speed of 7 cm2 min−1 in order to reduce the area occupied by the floating film. During the barriers’ motion, the surface pressure of the floating film was recorded by means of a paper-made Wilhelmy plate, and the so-called surface pressure vs. area per molecule Langmuir isotherm was obtained.34
A NIMA Langmuir trough is equipped with a Brewster Angle Microscope (BAM), which allows monitoring the floating film morphology during its formation, promoted by the barriers’ movement. Furthermore, the same Langmuir trough is equipped with two optical fibers to perform reflection spectroscopy.35 According to previously reported results,36 TPyP was dissolved in chloroform at a molar concentration of 1.6 × 10−4 M and transferred at 18 mN m−1 through a Langmuir–Schaefer method, whilst FP2 was dissolved in chloroform at a final concentration of 1.2 × 10−4 M and transferred, according to the method of ref. 37, at 18 mN m−1.
Quartz and ITO substrates were hydrophobized, before carrying out the deposition, by overnight exposure to 1,1,1,6,6,6-hexamethyldisilazane vapours in a desiccator.
As detailed above, all the Langmuir films were transferred by means of the Langmuir–Schaefer (LS) technique, the horizontal variation of the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method, since this one did not allow to obtain uniform films and very low transfer ratios were recorded.30
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoactivity of the LS layers was monitored using a home-made ITO/(active layer)n/I−, I3−/Pt-ITO cell.38 The ITO substrate (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, 8–12 Ω sq−1), herein used as a counter electrode, was drilled to create a 1 mm diameter hole to allow the injection of the electrolyte. Then, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the ITO glass, by casting a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg Pt in 1 mL of ethanol), and heated at 400 °C for 15 min. The working electrode based on ITO and active layer and the Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket (of 25 mm thickness) made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). The used photoactive film area was 0.3 cm2 and a drop of the electrolyte was injected from the back side of the ITO counter electrode. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M) and I2 (0.01 M) was employed as the electrolyte. Finally, the hole in the counter electrode was sealed using the hot-melt Surlyn and a cover glass. A Keithley 2400 multimeter and a PGSTAT100 Autolab potentiostat were utilized for recording the JV curves. A 1.5 AM LOT-Oriel Solar S class A solar simulator was used for the illumination. The IPCE was calculated using the following equation: IPCE (%) = 124 000 · I/(λ·f(λ)), where λ is the light wavelength (measured in nm) selected by means of an Omni-λ 1509 monochromator in steps of 20 nm, I is the photocurrent density (A cm−2) and f(λ) is the incident-light power density at a wavelength λ (W cm−2) calibrated using a radiant-power/energy meter before each experiment.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the synthesized carbon nanodots
The CND formation was monitored by ATR-FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 1, boxes a and b, respectively). Fig. 1a reports the FTIR spectra obtained for ethanolamine (black line), synthesis intermediate-products (red line) and CNDs (blue line), respectively. The ethanolamine spectrum is dominated by the C–O stretching modes and in particular by the C–O–H signal located at about 1031 cm−1.39 Upon reaction progress, this component progressively reduces until it completely disappears in the CND spectrum (blue line). Further confirmation could be obtained by observing the strong reduction of the O–H stretching mode region at high wavenumbers (3600–3150 cm−1).39 A similar rationale can be proposed about primary amine group vibrations, whose signals almost disappeared. Indeed, the CND spectrum lacks the NH2 bending modes located in the region between 900 and 700 cm−1, the corresponding stretching modes, the asymmetric and the symmetric ones at 3760 and 3290 cm−1, respectively, the 3200 cm−1 signal due to the Fermi resonance, and the intense overtone located at about 1600 cm−1.39 The almost complete lack of OH and NH2 signals, together with the strong reduction of the CH bending modes (1470–1200 cm−1),39 clearly confirmed the successful occurrence of the oxidation process. In fact, the intermediate spectrum (red line) clearly shows the presence of the typical vibration modes of an oxidized amidic group, and in particular, the bands due to CO stretching (1660 cm−1), to N–H bending (1570 cm−1) and, at about 1380 cm−1, to N–O symmetric stretching modes are evident.32 The presence of the amidic group is in perfect agreement with the reaction progress, which involves a first step of polymerization among ethanolamine and its oxidative products upon H2O2 action, inducing the formation of amidic bonds as crosslinkers.32 Then, carbonization takes place and those signals almost completely disappear, and the FT-IR spectrum of CNDs (blue line) is dominated by the CO stretching mode (1660 cm−1)39 and the C–O stretching mode of the aryl ether (C–O–C–, 1067 cm−1) bands.40 The development of ether polar functional groups promotes the solubility of CNDs in water.40 The CNDs’ surface electrostatic charge was measured by the ζ-potential method and a −22 mV negative charge was recorded in Milli-Q grade water.

UV-Vis spectroscopy characterization confirmed the results obtained by FT-IR characterization. The presence of CO and NO functional groups during the polymerization phase was attested by the presence of the absorption peak located at 280 nm, which is normally assigned to the n–π* transition of CO or NO,41,42 in the spectrum of the intermediate product (red line, Fig. 1b). This peak intensity decreased during the carbonization step with the formation of the CNDs (blue line, Fig. 1b). A broad weak absorption peak is centred at nearly 370 nm, assigned to energy trapping states located on the particle surface, which can lead to the noticed fluorescence of carbon dots (Fig. 1b).13 XPS analysis was carried out to investigate the surface groups of the prepared CNDs. Fig. S3a† reports the obtained XPS survey spectrum, showing that CNDs are composed of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen with an atomic percentage of 60.21, 23.69 and 16.11, respectively. The high resolution C 1s spectrum in Fig. S3b† could be deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 285, 286 and 287.8 eV, which are assigned to the C–C, C–O/C–N and CO/CN groups, respectively.43,44 The O 1s spectrum (Fig. S3c†) reveals the presence of CO at 531 eV and of C–OH/C–O–C at 532.2 eV.45 The presence and dissociation of these oxygenated functional moieties lead to the negative surface charge of the CNDs,46 according to ξ-potential analysis (−22 eV). Finally, the N 1s spectrum (Fig. S3d†) was deconvoluted into a main peak at 399.3 eV, which can be ascribed to pyridinic nitrogen groups; the other peak shown at 401.9 eV represents the N–H group.32
Fluorescence emission property analysis is a key characterization technique for CNDs.47 In fact, changes in the emission frequency as a function of the excitation wavelength are a rather common finding for CNDs.48,49 A typical experiment was carried out by analysing the emission spectra of a 0.05 mg mL−1 CNDs aqueous solution while changing the excitation wavelength from 320 nm to 460 nm with a step of 20 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, a maximum emission at about 460 nm was recorded upon 380 nm excitation. The CNDs' emission intensity enhanced, if the excitation wavelength is increased from 320 nm to 380 nm.49 The maximum emission wavelength shifted to lower energy values with a simultaneous decrease of the fluorescence intensity when excitation wavelengths higher than 380 nm were used.49 Such an effect is usually attributed to the influence of energetic defects on the CND surface on the energetic levels,32,42,50 as well as the size and the size distribution can influence the recombination processes, even among different CNDs, strongly affecting the emission features.51

FP2/CNDs supramolecular dyad characterization
The interaction among the doubly-charged fulleropyrrolidine derivative and the CNDs was evaluated by monitoring the fluorescence emission variations of CNDs in the presence of FP2. In a typical titration experiment, different volumes of a 1.4 × 10−3M FP2 solution in ethanol/water 50/50 (vol/vol) were added to CNDs aqueous solution at a fixed concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1. Fluorescence emission was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an evident quenching of the fluorescence intensity is obtained as the FP2 concentration increases (Fig. 4a). The absorption of FP2 at 380 nm can be neglected and the total photons incident on CNDs can be considered a constant (Fig. S6†). The rationale is an energetic and/or electronic intercommunication that takes place between the two species.56 As a further confirmation of this rationale, the up-conversion emission of CNDs was monitored while increasing the FP2 concentration (Fig. S7†). The communication between the two species and the up-conversion of the energy of the absorbed photons act as competitive mechanisms: the charge transfer from CNDs towards FP2 reduces the electrons available to relax at the fundamental level and, of course, the up-conversion efficiency. Furthermore, experimental data graphed in the Stern–Volmer plot (Fig. 4b) could not be fitted by a linear relationship, suggesting that a combined effect of dynamic and static quenching could rule the CND fluorescence decrease.57 According to the results reported by Das and co-workers about the graphene quantum dot fluorescence quenching promoted by single walled carbon nanotubes,58 CND fluorescence quenching was fitted with a compressed-exponential growth curve, as follows:  where I0 represents the maximum fluorescence emission without a quencher, I the fluorescence intensity in the presence of FP2, and b and a are two constants.

The fitting of the experimental data provided a = 1.643 and b = 0.018, two values indicative of an unusually high fluorescence quenching when compared with the modified Stern–Volmer equation where a is equal to 1.57 This outcome can be explained as a consequence of the strong interaction between FP2 and CNDs during the formation of the supramolecular adduct.58
FP2/CNDs dyad floating film formation
The possibility to promote the carbon nanodots/fulleropyrrolidine derivative supramolecular adduct formation was evaluated using a Langmuir trough. Several examples of supramolecular adducts have been promoted and studied at the air/water interface.59,60 Chelation,61,62 electrostatic interaction63,64 and other supramolecular interactions65,66 between a water dissolved species and a floating amphiphilic (or pseudo-amphiphilic) molecule can be used as driving forces to induce the formation of host–guest adducts. The Langmuir method, even though not particularly suitable for the deposition of large area solid films, appears particularly interesting for promoting self-aggregating supramolecular structures. In fact, the possibility to use the minimization of free energy of the molecules at the air–subphase interface allows to obtain very appealing supramolecular adducts that show unique characteristics67–69 and, as reported in the present case, it is possible to promote the formation of supramolecular dyads and triads with substances soluble in different solvents. Furthermore, the accurate control of the deposition parameters allows to transfer solid films with a very high reproducibility.
CNDs were dissolved, at different concentrations, in ultrapure water and the carbon nanodot solutions were used as the subphases in the Langmuir experiments. Three different concentrations of CNDs in water subphase were selected in order to check the effect of carbon nanodot concentration on the supramolecular adduct FP2/CNDs formation. In particular, concentration values of 0.05 mg mL−1, 0.15 mg mL−1 and 0.44 mg ml−1 were used as subphase with a practical focus on the first one, which was selected as it corresponded to the amount used in the PL quenching experiments. We observed that CND concentrations higher than 0.2 mg mL−1 significantly and negatively affected the uniformity of the deposited FP2/CNDs films. Hence, air/subphase experiments were carried out by evaluating 0.05 mg mL−1 and 0.15 mg mL−1 CNDs concentrations solely.
An amount of 120 μL of FP2 chloroform solution (1.2 × 10−4 M) was spread, by means of a glass syringe, on the aqueous subphases and the surface pressure vs. area per molecule Langmuir isotherms were recorded. FP2 molecules were spread on the ultrapure water subphase (blue line in Fig. 5), as already discussed in a previous study,37 suggesting the formation of a stable Langmuir monolayer at the air/water interface. The presence of the two positive electrostatic charges on the fulleropyrrolidine molecules inhibits the tendency of the C60 derivative to aggregate. Nevertheless, BAM images of FP2 films floating on ultrapure water showed, even at low surface pressure values, the formation of bright spots as a clear consequence of small FP2 aggregates (Fig. 6a). The presence of CNDs in the subphase, at both 0.05 and 0.15 mg mL−1 concentrations, brings about a shift toward larger areas per molecule. In particular, this shift was recorded to be from 90 Å2 to 120 Å2 for the subphase containing 0.05 mg mL−1 CNDs (black line in Fig. 5) and up to 160 Å2 for the 0.15 mg mL−1 carbon nanodot subphase (red line in Fig. 5). Also, the slope change of the Langmuir isotherm is recorded at 28 mN m−1 when 0.05 mg mL−1 CNDs subphase is used and at about 38 mN m−1 in the case of 0.15 mg ml−1 CNDs subphase. The smoother phase transition observed in the case of the FP2 Langmuir film spread on the aqueous subphase containing 0.15 mg mL−1 CNDs is a consequence of a less rigid FP2 floating film: CNDs work as a spacer between FP2 molecules, allowing the re-arrangement of the C60 derivative floating molecules under the barriers’ effect. These observations further confirm the interaction among water dissolved species and floating molecules.
 Fig. 5  Surface pressure vs. area per molecule Langmuir isotherms of FP2 spread on the air–subphase interface of the pure water subphase (blue line), and 0.05 (black curve) and 0.15 mg mL−1 (red line) CNDs subphases. 
 Fig. 6  BAM pictures of FP2 Langmuir films formed on ultrapure water (column a), on 0.05 mg mL−1 CNDs subphase (column b) and on aqueous subphase containing 0.15 mg mL−1 solution of carbon nanodots (column c) acquired at different surface pressures. 
Brewster angle microscopy confirmed that the presence of CNDs dissolved in the subphase influences the FP2 floating film formation (Fig. 6b and c). When the FP2 was spread on the ultrapure water subphase, in fact, the simultaneous presence of non-covered areas of the subphase and Langmuir film regions was monitored; in contrast, when carbon nanodots are in the subphase, an almost complete coating of the interface was reached at 4.5 mN m−1. The rationale is that under the barriers’ motion, the presence of CNDs ensures the formation of thicker floating films as highlighted by higher brightness of the floating film recorded by BAM.
Floating films were further characterized by reflection spectroscopy at the air/subphase interface (Fig. S8†). Reflection variation ΔR for thin films is directly proportional to the absorbance of the floating film; therefore, the reflection spectrum provides the same information that can be obtained from an absorption spectrum.63 Typical fulleropyrrolidine thin film reflection spectra were recorded even though it is relevant to observe that a well-defined reflection band appeared at 425 nm; the nature of this peculiar band will be discussed in the next paragraph.
FP2/CNDs adduct transfer on solid substrates
The LS method was used to transfer the FP2/CNDs adduct generated at the air/subphase interface. The LS method was used since the FP2 floating film appeared to be too rigid to be transferred by the usual LB approach;30 indeed, very low deposition rates and non-uniform solid films were obtained when the traditional vertical deposition method was adopted. The LS method allows the formation of self-promoted supramolecular adducts and the simultaneous transfer of two species with very different solubilities. The opposite electrostatic charges present on the two species are the driving force that promotes the formation of supramolecular adducts, giving the molecules the possibility to minimize their free energy during the formation of the dyad. The UV-visible spectrum of the film obtained by transferring FP2 from the water subphase and containing CNDs with a concentration of 0.15 mg mL−1 evidences the peculiar presence of an absorption band centred at 427 nm (Fig. 7a). The intensity of this absorption band is proportional to the number of performed LS runs (Fig. 7b) and, interestingly, this band has not been observed in the visible spectrum of the FP2 LS films (Fig. 7c) or in the spin coated film of the mixture FP2/CNDs (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, it is worth observing that this new band is barely visible when FP2 Langmuir films are transferred from the water subphase containing CNDs at a concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1 (Fig. 7d).
 Fig. 7  (a) Visible spectra of the FP2/CNDs thin films of increasing numbers of layers (the dyad was transferred from a water subphase containing 0.15 mg mL−1 CNDs). (b) The relationship between the absorption intensity recorded at 427 nm and the number of LS layers confirms the good repeatability of the deposition process. (c) Absorption spectra of LS films of FP2 (blue line), spin coated films of FP2/CNDs (black line) and CNDs cast films (grey line). (d) Visible spectra of Langmuir films transferred from the water subphase containing CNDs at a concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1. 
All these lines of evidence prove that both the concentration of the carbon nanodots in the subphase and the film transfer method are crucial for originating and transferring the supramolecular adduct FP2/CNDs. A possible rationale of this new absorption band could be proposed by considering the opposite electrostatic charges of FP2 and CNDs. The interaction between the floating molecules and the CNDs dissolved in the water subphase probably induces a partial neutralization of the positive charges on the fullerene derivatives. This allows the formation of FP2 aggregates promoted by the significant van der Waals forces that rule the aggregation phenomena in C60 and its derivatives.69–71 In this view, the appearance of absorption bands between 400 and 500 nm in the visible spectra of C60 derivatives is usually attributed to aggregation forms of fullerene,72 in particular when these are transferred to solid films.73 The absence of the absorption band at 427 nm in the spectra of the FP2/CNDs spin-coated film could be attributed to a phase separation occurring between FP2 and CNDs because of the low mutual miscibility of both solutions. Consequently, the electrostatic repulsion generated by the positive charges on the fulleropyrrolidine functionalization reduces the π–π interactions among the FP2 molecules.
Just one LS run of the dyad FP2/CNDs was carried out by transferring FP2 from the water subphase containing CNDs with a concentration of 0.15 mg mL−1 directly on Cu TEM grids to morphologically characterize the deposited adducts (Fig. 8 and Fig. S9†).
 Fig. 8  TEM picture of 1 LS run of the FP2/CNDs dyad obtained by transferring FP2 from a water subphase containing 0.15 mg mL−1 of CNDs. 
The picture shows that the substrate is not homogenously covered and segregated and distributed domains of organic material, presumably FP2, are clearly visible. It is worth underlining that CNDs, which appear as black spots, are not spread on the surface, but embedded into those islands of organic materials, confirming the success of the deposition procedure, which ensures the formation of a stable supramolecular adduct and the subsequent transfer to solid supports.
Photoinduced phenomena in the FP2/CNDs supramolecular adduct
The FP2/CNDs dyad was transferred directly to ITO substrates and a home-made electrochemical cell was assembled as reported in the Experimental section. JV characteristics acquired using the supramolecular adduct as the active layer showed the typical diode profile and photoactivity can be observed when the device was illuminated with an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Fig. S10†). Although very low, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of about 13.5 μA cm−2 has been measured. It can be supposed that a charge transfer phenomenon from CNDs towards fullerene derivatives occurs.58,72 This rationale is also corroborated by the already observed fluorescence quenching.
A low photoactivity of FP2 LS films (Fig. 9a) has been noticed as a consequence of the electron transfer after the photon excitation between fullerenes73,74 and fullerene aggregates.75 The well-known behaviour of the carbon nanodot films as hole transporter material enhances the electron–hole separation and the charge transport and, consequently, the short-circuit current (Fig. 9a).76

(c) Fluorescence quenching of TPyP in the presence of FP2 (black spectrum) and FP2/CNDs (red spectrum) when transferred to the quartz substrate. 
The efficiency of photocurrent generation was further improved by adding, to the FP2/CNDs layer, a light harvesting molecule. Porphyrin derivatives are a class of compounds widely used as a photon harvesting material capable of transferring one (or more) electrons to suitable materials.76–78 TPyP (see the Methods section) was used as a light antenna and an electron donor species. It is well known that porphyrins can transfer, under illumination, electrons towards fullerene derivatives and other allotropic forms of the carbon. Therefore, it has been argued that the presence of TPyP should increase the photocurrent values when one layer of porphyrin was transferred to each layer of FP2/CNDs (inset in Fig. 9b). The porphyrin derivative was in the past characterized at the air/water interface36 and transferred at a surface pressure value of 18 mN m−1. According to the results reported in ref. 36, a surface pressure value of 18 mN m−1 is compatible with a model of the spread molecules where the porphyrin rings lie on the subphase surface in a playing card arrangement.79 The porphyrin derivative Langmuir film was then transferred to the ITO solid support by the LS method and then the FP2/CDNs adduct obtained at the air/subphase interface of another Langmuir trough was transferred to the TPP LS layer. This configuration was adopted in order to maximize the interface between the electron donor species (TPP) and the electron acceptor supramolecular adduct (FP2/CNDs). The Langmuir–Schaefer technique allowed to transfer the TPyP layer without affecting the supramolecular dyad's layer while ensuring the control of the deposition parameters of the TPyP LS film. The procedure was repeated 8 times and eight alternate layers of TPyP-FP2/CNDs were transferred and the absorption (in Fig. S11,† the absorption spectra of 8 LS layers of FP2-CNDs and TPyP/FP2-CNDs are reported) and fluorescence emissions (λexc = 440 nm) were monitored. As reported in Fig. S12,† even though TPyP is transferred to the FP2/CNDs layer, the reproducibility of the deposition process is not affected and the linear correlation between the TPyP maximum absorption and the number of LS layers confirms the reproducibility and accurate control of the deposition procedure. The presence of the supramolecular FP2/CNDs dyad partially quenches the porphyrin derivative fluorescence (Fig. 9b) and light-assisted enhancements of the short-circuit current of about 160% (compared with FP2/CNDs) and 290% (compared with TPyP-FP2) have been obtained (Fig. 9a) as a consequence of the increased light harvesting induced by the presence of the porphyrin derivative layer. It is worth observing that the TPyP fluorescence quenching is similar in the case of FP2 (black spectrum) and in the presence of the supramolecular dyad FP2/CNDs (red line). This line of evidence suggests that the light induced charge transfer from porphyrin takes place exclusively towards FP2. Nevertheless, it is relevant to observe that the JSC value recorded for the TPyP-FP2/CNDs, that is, 21.8 μA cm−2, is equal to the sum of the short-circuit currents of FP2/CNDs and TPyP/FP2 (7.5 μA cm−2), suggesting that probably two different charge transfers take place in the triad TPyP-FP2/CNDs: one from the porphyrin to the fullerene and the other one from the CNDs to the fullerene.
Photoaction spectra of only 8 alternate layers of the TPyP/FP2 dyad and 8 alternate layers of the TPyP/FP2-CNDs triad were recorded in the presence of a monochromatic light (see the Photoelectrochemical measurements section). Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) shows a maximum for both the systems centred at the Soret band of porphyrin derivatives, suggesting that the predominantly active component is TPyP. Furthermore, an increase of the IPCE value is observed at low wavelengths, confirming a charge transfer from CNDs toward the fulleropyrrolidine derivatives. The maximum IPCE for both the systems is about 0.35%.
The device stability to different on–off cycles was verified by illuminating the TPyP-FP2/CNDs for 5 s and recording the current density (Fig. S13†) and no relevant variation in the short-circuit current density was observed during 50 cycle.
Finally, TPyP-FP2/CNDs LS films were stored in the dark at room temperature and their photo-responses were checked over 16 days. After each experiment the substrates were washed three times with ultrapure water in order to remove the electrolyte and then dried under nitrogen flux. A worsening of the current density was observed after the fifth day, reasonably because of a partial desorption of the active layers during the substrate washing steps (Fig. 10).

Conclusions
Herein, negatively charged water soluble carbon dots were synthesized and used to promote a supramolecular adduct with a doubly charged fulleropyrrolidine. Fluorescence quenching of CNDs, graphed according to the Stern–Volmer plot, in the presence of FP2 follows a compressed-exponential growth curve, confirming the strong interaction between the two allotropic forms of carbon. FP2/CNDs adducts formed at the air/subphase interface were characterized by Brewster angle microscopy and reflection spectroscopy and by recording the surface pressure vs. area per molecule Langmuir isotherms. The floating film was transferred to ITO solid substrates by the Langmuir–Schaefer method.
The photoresponsivity of the FP2/CNDs dyad was evaluated by assembling a thin film solar cell and a photoinduced charge separation was demonstrated in the carbon dots/fullerene derivative composite film. The performances of LS TPyP-FP2 and TPyP-FP2/CNDs have been analyzed. An enhancement by about 160% of the short-circuit current under illumination when compared with FP2/CNDs and 290% when compared with TPyP-FP2 has been obtained, opening interesting scenarios for improving the charge separation in light harvesting and solar energy conversion systems.
