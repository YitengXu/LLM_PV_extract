    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractA series of low energy gap polymers comprising 2,7-linked carbazole or fluorene units flanked by thiophene or selenophene repeat units as alternating donor units and benzothiadiazole with or without alkoxy substituents as alternating acceptor repeat units is reported. The effects of replacing thiophene with selenophene in this series of polymers on their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic device performance when fabricated into bulk heterojunction solar cells using PC70BM as an acceptor are investigated. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) ranging from 3.34 to 5.41% are obtained with these systems. Thiophene-based polymers are found to have higher efficiency compared to comparable selenophene-based polymers. We tentatively explain such differences on the basis of reduced molar absorbance and reduced charge-carrier mobility in the selenophene-based polymers.
Introduction
The development of new conjugated polymers for application in plastic solar cells is attracting much research interest for their potential as a low-cost system for renewable energy generation. The design and synthesis of electron-donating polymers for such applications requires the simultaneous optimisation of electronic and physical properties, including electronic energy-gap, LUMO level (permitting them to act as efficient electron donors to electron-accepting fullerene derivatives) and charge-carrier mobility. It is also important that when blended with a fullerene acceptor, a nanoscale morphology is formed permitting efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction.1 Several approaches exist for synthesising conjugated polymers with lower optical band gaps in order to efficiently harvest sunlight. One such approach is the replacement of thiophene units with selenophene repeat units, as in conjugated polymers this generally lowers the electronic band gap and results in deeper (further away from the vacuum level) LUMO levels. This is because the HOMO level (in thiophene or selenophene based systems) has no coefficient on the sulfur or selenium heteroatoms whereas the LUMO has a significant contribution.2 As an example, regioregular head-to-tail poly(3-hexylselenophene) (P3HS), which is the analogous polymer to regioregular head-to-tail poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), shows a marked reduction in its band gap from ca. 1.9 eV for P3HT to 1.6 eV for P3HS.3 While both P3HS and P3HT have similar HOMO levels (∼−4.8 eV) (resulting from a small difference in the electronegativity of sulfur and selenium), the LUMO level of P3HS is deeper by 0.3 eV as a result of the higher polarisability of selenium vs. that of sulfur. Studies on other polymers where thiophene repeat units have been replaced by selenophene units – such as poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2′,2′′-biselenophene) and poly(3,3-didodecylquaterthiophene) – reveal similar effects.4
In other classes of polymers however, such as cyclopentadithiophene-alt-bithiophene (CPDT-T2) and cyclopentadithiophene-alt-biselenophene (CPDT-Se2),5 the selenophene based polymers have reduced optical energy-gaps compared to their thiophene counterparts; however, the difference between their energy-gaps is only about 0.1 eV. While their HOMO levels are comparable, the LUMO levels of the selenophene derivatives are about 0.1 eV deeper than those of the thiophene derivatives with branched alkyl substituents and at the same level for polymers with linear alkyl substituents. Alternating donor–acceptor copolymer systems comprising benzodithiophene units have shown great promise for their application in bulk heterojunction solar cells, with relatively high PCEs reported.6 Replacement of sulfur with selenium atoms in these polymer systems have led to polymers with lower band gaps and improved charge carrier mobility and enhanced PCEs.7,8 Other studies have also shown larger charge carrier mobility for selenophene-based oligomers9 or polymers10–12 compared to their thiophene based counterparts as a result of enhanced interchain-interactions.
Polymers comprising benzothiadiazole acceptor repeat units with a range of donors have attracted a special interest and have shown great promise.13–18 Most recently, donor–acceptor polymers with alternating carbazole repeat units and benzothiadiazole acceptors flanked by dithienyl or diselenophenyl units have been described.19,20 In this work, we report the preparation of donor–acceptor polymers comprising alternating dithienyl-benzothiadiazole or diselenophenyl-benzothiadiazole repeat-units with 2,7-linked carbazole or fluorene repeat units. The electronic, photophysical and photovoltaic properties of the materials are analysed and we compare the properties of changing thiophene with selenophene repeat units along the polymer backbone.
Results and discussion
In previous work, we have reported the preparation of efficient low band gap donor–acceptor alternating carbazole based-polymers comprising benzothiadiazole repeat units. The polymers provided solar cells with high open circuit voltages (up to 0.96 V) and good power conversion efficiencies (up to 4.22%) when blended with fullerene derivatives as electron acceptor molecules.21 In order to further explore derivatives of this class of polymer, we have investigated the effect of replacing thiophene with selenophene repeat units. We have also explored replacing the carbazole repeat units with 9,9-dioctyl-fluorene in order to probe the effects on intramolecular charge transfer and to investigate the change in the HOMO and LUMO levels. A number of polymers have been synthesised, all of which were prepared using Suzuki cross-coupling reactions as shown in Scheme 1. The structures of the polymers are shown in Chart 1. The known polymers PCDTBT22 and PCDTBT-821 were prepared according to an earlier study and their properties are discussed here to enable a direct comparison with those of the selenophene analogues PCDSeBT and PCDSeBT-8.

 Chart 1  Structure of the polymers. 
The GPC and UV-vis data of all polymers are outlined in Table 1. Polymers with dithienyl-benzothiadiazole and diselenophenyl-benzothiadiazole repeat units such as PCDSeBT, PFDSeBT and PFDTBT display low solubility and only the toluene fractions of these polymers separated by Soxhlet extraction could be successfully used to create films that are thick enough for subsequent use in solar cell device studies (Table 1). This effect is mainly due to the limited number of alkyl substituents along the polymer backbone that limits their interaction with solvent molecules and consequently leads to aggregation. Synthesis of this series of polymers did, however permit the comparison of the properties of materials with thiophene repeat units to those with selenophene repeat units. Larger yields were obtained during the preparation of polymers where the benzothiadiazole repeat units were substituted with octyloxy groups (polymers PCDSeBT-8, PCDTBT-8, PFDSeBT-8 and PFDTBT-8), due to the introduction of more solubilising substituents along the polymer backbone. All polymers in this series were soluble enough to be extracted by Soxhlet extraction using toluene, rather than requiring chloroform or chlorobenzene. To correlate the properties of these polymers, the toluene Soxhlet fraction was used wherever possible. Note however that the chloroform fraction of PCDTBT and PFDTBT-8 was used in photovoltaic devices.

Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the polymer films are displayed in Fig. 1. Solution absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The values of their absorption maxima and optical energy gaps as determined from their onsets of absorption in films are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the energy band gaps of polymers with selenophene repeat units are generally lower than the corresponding polymers with thiophene units. As an example, PCDSeBT has a λmax of absorption in films at 596 nm while the equivalent polymer with thiophene repeat units (PCDTBT) has a λmax at 570 nm. From the onset of the absorption, the energy gap of PCDSeBT is determined to be 1.82 eV while PCDTBT is 1.88 eV. The same trend is observed for selenophene-based polymers PCDSeBT-8 and PFDSeBT-8 by comparison with their respective thiophene counterparts PCDTBT-8 and PFDTBT-8 (Table 1). This trend is not replicated for PFDSeBT and PFDTBT (9,9-dioctylfluorene based copolymers), where the selenophene based polymer PFDSeBT has a similar band gap to its thiophene analogue PFDTBT and its absorption maximum is in fact lower when cast into a film. We attribute this effect to a higher degree of aggregation in the thiophene-based polymer, as the absorption maximum of the selenophene-based polymer is higher in solution (575 nm for PFDSeBTvs. 549 nm for PFDTBT).
 Fig. 1  UV-vis spectra of polymers as thin films. 
A comparison of the absorption spectra of the octyloxy functionalised benzothiadiazole polymers (PCDSeBT-8, PCDTBT-8, PFDSeBT-8 and PFDTBT-8) with those of their polymer counterparts without such substituents (PCDSeBT, PCDTBT, PFDSeBT and PFDTBT respectively) confirm the results of our previous work.21 Here, the larger energy-gaps and lower degree of electronic delocalisation of polymers PCDSeBT-8, PCDTBT-8, PFDSeBT-8 and PFDTBT-8 most probably result from reduced intramolecular charge transfer along polymer chains caused by the weaker electron accepting properties of octyloxy substituted benzothiadiazole repeat units.
Electrochemical properties
Investigation of the electrochemical properties of the polymers was undertaken using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on drop-cast polymer films in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as an electrolyte. The CV measurements of all polymers are shown in Fig. 2 with their redox potentials, as well as their respective HOMO and LUMO levels (vs. vacuum), shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the HOMO levels of selenophene-based polymers are slightly deeper than the corresponding thiophene based polymers but such differences are never greater than 0.11 eV. These findings are in line with results from other studies which recorded similar HOMO values for analogous selenophene and thiophene based polymers resulting from the small difference in electronegativity between sulfur and selenium.2–5 The LUMO levels (as determined from CV measurements) of all selenophenyl based polymers are about 0.2 eV closer to the vacuum level than those of the thiophene equivalent polymers. This result is surprising given that the selenophene-based polymers have lower optical energy band gaps. Polymers with or without octyloxy substituents on benzothiadiazole repeat units display similar HOMO levels. As an example, the HOMO level of PCDSeBT is at −5.46 eV while PCDSeBT-8 is at −5.47 eV. This reinforces the observed trend that varying the electronic properties of the benzothiadiazole electron accepting repeat units has little bearing on the HOMO levels of this series of polymers. The LUMO level of all polymers with octyloxy functionalised benzothiadiazole repeat units are about 0.15 eV closer to the vacuum level than corresponding polymers without these substituents, as observed for example by comparing PCDSeBT-8 and PCDSeBT (−3.09 eV vs. −3.25 eV respectively) or PCDTBT-8 and PCDTBT (−3.27 eV vs. −3.42 eV respectively). A similar LUMO energy difference is observed in fluorene polymers PFDSeBT-8vs.PFDSeBT or PFDTBT-8vs.PFDTBT. This observation is most probably explained by the reduced electron-accepting properties of the alkoxy substituted benzothiadiazole repeat units.

Photovoltaic device characterisation
Photovoltaic devices were made using blends of polymers:PC70BM in weight/weight ratios of 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. The device structure was based on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS anode, the polymer active layer (deposited by spin-casting) and a bilayer calcium/aluminium cathode. The results from the best devices obtained in these studies are outlined in Table 3 with the J–V curves shown in Fig. 3. Note that devices using PCDTBT and PCDTBT-8 have been further optimised by using a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) anode buffer layer to improve hole extraction. Although this improvement is only marginal for PCDTBT-8, PCDTBT displays a more significant increase (through increased Voc) but all comparisons with this polymer still hold. Our studies reveal that the most efficient devices were obtained from blends based on polymer:PC70BM weight/weight ratios of 1:3 or 1:4. A number of different solvents were explored to cast each blend film, with the optimum casting-solvent being detailed in Table 3. We have comprehensively explored the effect of film thickness on device efficiency, and find that devices utilising selenophene-based polymers necessitate the use of slightly thinner active layers to maximise device efficiency. For example, active layer thickness in optimised thiophene-based polymer PFDTBT devices is 70 nm, compared to 50 nm in selenophene-based polymer PFDSeBT devices. As we argue below, this results in slightly less efficient light harvesting in these devices and thereby contributes to reduced short-circuit current in selenophene-polymer based devices. We have also explored the effect of thermal annealing at 80 °C to improve device efficiency (post cathode deposition). This was only found to improve – albeit marginally – the performance of devices based on polymers PCDTBT and PFDTBT-8. Polymer PCDTBT-8 has been previously shown to have an optimised thermal annealing temperature of 120 °C that increased device performance from 3.35% to 4.22%.21

 Fig. 3  
J–V characteristics of devices of polymers blended with PC70BM. Devices with PCDTBT and PCDTBT-8 as the active layer utilise an anode buffer layer of thermally evaporated molybdenum oxide (MoOx) whereas all other polymers use a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS. All devices have a cathode of Ca/Al. 
All polymers in the series had reasonably good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) ranging from 3.34 to 5.41%. A comparison of the photovoltaic performance of the different polymers indicates that, for the majority of polymers, the thiophene-based polymers have relatively higher PCEs than their selenophene counterparts. As an example, the selenophene based polymer PCDSeBT had a PCE of 3.34% while the thiophene equivalent PCDTBT had a PCE of 5.10%. Similarly, the thiophene based polymer PFDTBT had a PCE of 5.41% while the selenophene equivalent polymer PFDSeBT had a PCE of 4.03%. For polymers with octyloxy substituents on benzothiadiazole repeat units, the PCE of the polymers in the fluorene series display a similar trend, with PFDSeBT-8 exhibiting a lower PCE than PFDTBT-8 (3.45% and 4.94% respectively). In all of these cases, the lower PCE values primarily result from a reduced short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, PCDSeBT-8 and PCDTBT-8 based devices had similar performance, despite the introduction of selenophene (4.35% and 4.41% respectively) with PCDSeBT-8 displaying an enhanced Jsc. It can be seen in Table 3 that changes in the open circuit voltage (Voc) are minimal. This is in good accord with the small differences observed in the values of the HOMO level. The fill factor (FF) values from devices using PFDSeBT and PFDTBT as well as those using polymers with octyloxy substituents are relatively low in comparison with those from devices using PCDSeBT and PCDTBT. This suggests that charge transport and extraction from devices using these polymers might be less efficient than in the case of devices using PCDTBT perhaps as a result the formation of a micro/nano structure that effects efficient exciton dissociation and extraction of photo-generated electrons and holes. The fill factors (FF) are slightly reduced in the selenophene-based polymers. These small discrepancies account only marginally for the observed differences in the PCE values. We conclude therefore that the short circuit current makes the largest contribution to the reduced PCE in the selenophene-based polymers. To further understand whether effects contribute to the lower Jsc (except in devices based on polymer PCDSeBT-8) we measured the molar absorption coefficients of these polymers and investigated their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and charge mobility (as determined in OFET devices).
Measurements of the solution molar absorption coefficients ε of the polymers in the series (detailed in Table 4) indicate that apart from carbazole-based polymers PCDSeBT-8 and PCDTBT-8 in which the thiophene derivative PCDTBT-8 has a molar absorption coefficient that is 15% lower than that of selenophene polymer PCDSeBT-8, (49666 L mol−1 cm−1 for PCDSeBT-8vs. 42310 L mol−1 cm−1 for PCDTBT-8), all other thiophene polymers have higher molar absorptivities than their selenophene analogues. Specifically, the molar absorptivity of selenophene polymer PCDSeBT is 9% lower than that of PCDTBT, that of PFDSeBT is 13% lower than that of PFDTBT and remarkably, that of PFDSeBT-8 is 35% lower than that of PFDTBT-8.

Measurements of PLQY (Table 4) were performed on pristine polymer films, with the solvent used to cast the films based on the optimised conditions used to fabricate each equivalent device. The results indicate that each of the selenophene-based polymers had a lower quantum yield of fluorescence. For example, the introduction of selenophene in PCDTBT (namely PCDSeBT) resulted in the largest decrease in the PLQY (92.5% decrease) which interestingly is correlated with the largest decrease in Jsc (32% decrease). We speculate that the reduced PLQY may result from enhanced intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold as a result of the heavy atom effect of selenium. This process may deplete the singlet-exciton population available for dissociation, thereby contributing to the reduced Jsc. Work is currently underway to test this hypothesis.
OFET charge-carrier (hole) mobilities measurements were also performed on pristine polymer films (also shown in Table 4). The solvent used to cast each film was again based on results from device optimisation studies. It can be seen that the selenophene-based polymers are characterised by lower hole-carrier mobility compared to their thiophene analogues. However the difference in hole-carrier mobility is not as pronounced in selenophene polymer PCDSeBT-8 when compared to its thiophene analogue PCDTBT-8 and where the differences are minimal. This observation may explain why the performance of devices based on PCDSeBT-8 is similar to those based on PCDTBT-8. It appears therefore that devices utilising selenophene-based polymers in many cases require the use of slightly thinner active layers to optimise charge extraction; an effect that results in some sacrifice of light harvesting ability and thus a lower Jsc.

Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled over sodium-benzophenone under inert nitrogen atmosphere. Toluene was dried and distilled over sodium under an inert argon atmosphere. Acetonitrile (High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade) was dried and distilled over phosphorus pentoxide under an inert argon atmosphere, then stored over molecular sieves 3 Å.
Measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker 250 MHz, AMX400 400 MHz or DRX500 500 MHz NMR spectrometers at 22 °C in chloroform-d solutions with TMS as the internal standard. Polymer solutions in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 100 °C were used as samples for GPC analysis. The GPC curves were obtained by the RI-detection method, which was calibrated with a series of polystyrene narrow standards (Polymer Laboratories). Elemental analyses were carried out by the Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyser for CHN analysis and by the Schöniger oxygen flask combustion method for anion analysis. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured by Hitachi U-2010 Double Beam UV/Visible Spectrophotometer. The absorbance of polymers was measured in solution in chloroform (spectrophotometric grade) at ambient temperature using rectangular quartz cuvettes (light path length = 10 mm) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Samples of pristine polymer thin films for UV-visible absorption spectra measurements were prepared by dip coating quartz plates into 1 mg cm−3 polymer solutions in chloroform (HPLC grade); and the measurements were carried out at ambient temperature. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research Model 263A Potentiostat/Galvanostat. Measurements were carried out under argon at 25 ± 2 °C. 10 ml of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate solution in acetonitrile (0.1 mol dm−3) was used as the electrolyte solution. A three electrode system was used consisting of an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (silver wire in 0.01 mol dm−3 silver nitrate solution in the electrolyte solution), a platinum working electrode (2 mm diameter smooth platinum disc, area = 3.14 × 10−2 cm2), and a platinum counter electrode (platinum wire). Polymer thin films were formed by drop casting 1.0 mm3 of polymer solutions in chloroform (HPLC grade) (1 mg cm−3) onto the working electrode, then dried in air. Ferrocene was employed as a reference redox system according to IUPAC's recommendation.26
Organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated on a glass substrate with a pre-patterned ITO anode (20 Ohms per square) purchased from Ossila Limited. The substrates were cleaned and a 20–30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (HC Stark Clevios P VP AI4083) was spun in air which were then subjected to a 150 °C thermal bake prior to transferring to a nitrogen filled glovebox. Whilst inside the glove-box, the substrates were baked at 150 °C for a further 15–30 min to remove any moisture. For devices using a molybdenum oxide buffer layer in place of PEDOT:PSS, a ∼10 nm layer was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber kept at a pressure below 10−7 mbar. Each polymer was subjected to an optimisation process that investigated the effects of various solvents (chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene (DCB)), blend ratios (1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 with PC70BM) and active layer film thickness. The active layer was spun from a concentration ranging from 12–20 mg cm−3 (depending on blend ratio) to give an optimum film thickness between 50 and 85 nm. The cathode (a bilayer of calcium and aluminium) was then thermally evaporated within a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 10−7 mbar. Devices were finally encapsulated in the glovebox using a UV-treated epoxy and a glass slide. Device performance was tested under AM1.5 at 100 mW cm−2 in air using a Newport 92251A-1000 solar simulator with NREL certified silicon reference cell.
OFET device fabrication and testing was performed by Ossila Limited. The semiconductor layer was spin coated on a bottom gate OFET architecture. A silicon substrate with a 300 nm silicon oxide (SiO2) layer was used for the gate electrode and insulator respectively. The substrate was cleaned and a gold source drain was thermally evaporated with channel dimensions of 50 μm × 20 mm. An octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) surface treatment was performed before the organic semiconductor later was spun inside a nitrogen filled glovebox. The polymer solutions were based on the best results from OPV device optimisation for each polymer system.
Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was performed using a ND:YAG laser tuned to 440 nm. A 442 nm bandpass filter was to reduce laser power together with a neutral density filter. Data was acquired with an Andor Shamrock 303 imaging spectrograph with an Oriel iDus CCD detector cooled to −40 °C. An exposure time of 0.05 s and a grating slit size of 30 μm was used. 1000 accumulations were taken due to the low PLQY of the polymers.
Conclusions
In this study, we have developed a range of donor–acceptor low energy gap polymers comprising 2,7-linked carbazole or 2,7-linked fluorene moieties positioned between either selenophene or thiophene rings as donor repeat units and benzothiadiazole alternate repeat units with or without alkoxy substituents as acceptor repeat units. The polymers were prepared in quantitative yields using Suzuki cross-coupling methods and were fully characterised. The solubilities of polymers that do not possess alkoxy substituents on their benzothiadiazole repeat units (PCDSeBT, PCDTBT, PFDSeBT and PFDTBT) are much lower than that of polymers that possess these substituents (PCDSeBT-8, PCDTBT-8, PFDSeBT-8 and PFDTBT-8). The selenophene polymers have lower optical band gaps when compared to their thiophene analogues. The HOMO levels of analogous selenophene and thiophene based polymers are similar while their LUMO levels appear to be closer to the vacuum level (as determined from their onset of reduction using cyclic voltammetry). Photovoltaic studies of this series of polymers in bulk heterojunction solar cells using PC70BM as an acceptor produced devices with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 3.34 to 5.41%. The short-circuit current of devices using selenophene polymers (except PCDSeBT-8) exhibit reduced values. We believe there are three origins for this effect; firstly selenophene polymers have a strongly reduced photoluminescence quantum yield, which we speculate may originate from the heavy atom effect from selenium that causes increased inter-system crossing. This process may result in a smaller population of singlet excitons that are able to undergo subsequent dissociation into charge-carriers. Secondly, the molar absorption coefficient (determined in solution) of the thiophene-containing polymers is in most cases larger than that of selenophene-polymers, limiting the ability of devices based on selenophene-polymers to harvest sunlight. Thirdly, selenophene polymers have a relatively reduced hole-carrier charge mobility, necessitating the use of active layers in devices having reduced thickness in order to optimise both device fill-factor and power-conversion efficiency. It is clear that for the majority of selenophene based polymers in this series (apart from the carbazole polymers PCDSeBT-8 and PCDTBT-8), the use of active-layers having reduced film thickness coupled with reduced molar absorption coefficient contributes to reduced short-circuit current. For this reason, we find that devices made using selenophene-based polymers have a comparatively lower PCE than analogous thiophene-based polymers.
