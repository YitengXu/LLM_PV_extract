    , Accepted 12th March 2013First published on 13th March 2013AbstractRegeneration and recombination kinetics was investigated for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using a series of different cobalt polypyridine redox couples, with redox potentials ranging between 0.34 and 1.20 V vs. NHE. Marcus theory was applied to explain the rate of electron transfer. The regeneration kinetics for a number of different dyes (L0, D35, Y123, Z907) by most of the cobalt redox shuttles investigated occurred in the Marcus normal region. The calculated reorganization energies for the regeneration reaction ranged between 0.59 and 0.70 eV for the different organic and organometallic dyes investigated. Under the experimental conditions employed, the regeneration efficiency decreased when cobalt complexes with a driving force for regeneration of 0.4 eV and less were employed. The regeneration efficiency was found to depend on the structure of the dye and the concentration of the redox couples. [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+, which has a driving force for regeneration of 0.25 eV for the triphenylamine based organic dye, D35, was found to regenerate 84% of the dye molecules, when a high concentration of the cobalt complex was used. Recombination kinetics between electrons in TiO2 and cobalt(III) species in the electrolyte was also studied using steady state dark current measurements. For cobalt complexes with highly positive redox potentials (>0.55 V vs. NHE) dark current was found to decrease, consistent with electron transfer reactions occurring in the Marcus inverted region. However, for the cobalt complexes with the most positive redox potentials an increase in dark current was found, which can be attributed to recombination mediated by surface states.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted a lot of attention because of their low cost manufacturing, beautiful colours that can be incorporated into the design of the solar cell and relatively high energy conversion efficiency obtained at diffuse light intensities. In a DSC sunlight is converted to electricity through light absorption by a dye molecule, anchored to a mesoporous semiconductor. After electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor, the oxidized dye molecules are regenerated by a redox mediator in the surrounding electrolyte.1–3
Until recently, iodide/triiodide has been the choice of redox couple for high efficiency DSCs. However, since we reported on high efficiency DSCs using cobalt bipyridyl redox couples in combination with organic dyes,4 it has become apparent that one-electron couples are more promising. The best energy conversion efficiency of 12.3% is nowadays obtained for co-sensitized DSCs using the cobalt tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) redox couple.5 The main advantage of using cobalt redox couples instead of iodide/triiodide is that the driving force needed for dye regeneration can be significantly less, and a higher voltage and higher power conversion efficiency can therefore be obtained.6–8 In addition, cobalt polypyridine redox couples have a lower extinction coefficient than iodide/triiodide and the use of cobalt redox couples opens up the opportunity for new materials in the design of DSCs.9–12
In order to achieve high efficiency DSCs the structure and the energy levels of the semiconductor, dye and redox mediator must be tuned to minimize energy losses in the system. By tuning the coordination sphere of the cobalt polypyridine redox couples open circuit voltages of over 1 V and an overall conversion efficiency of over 10% have been obtained, despite a driving force for regeneration of only 0.25 eV.7 Using the Nernst equation, the difference between the formal oxidation potential of the dye and the redox potential of the electrolyte can be calculated to be at least 0.18 V in order to keep 99.9% of the dye in neutral (non-oxidized) form. Attempts have been made to determine the minimum driving force needed for dye regeneration in real devices by changing the HOMO level of different dyes,13,14 but few reports have systematically varied the redox potential of the redox mediators in order to determine the driving force needed for dye regeneration. In a recent publication on ferrocene redox couples it was found that quantitative regeneration yields are obtained for ferrocene derivatives with driving forces for dye regeneration in between 0.2 and 0.25 eV, taking the concentration of the ferrocene derivatives into account.15 In our recent work we found that a driving force of 0.39 eV for cobalt polypyridine redox couples is sufficient to regenerate more than 80% of the dye molecules, using the triphenylamine-based organic dye D35, and that the regeneration efficiency decreased with a lower driving force for regeneration.6
Here, we have extended our study to include 13 different cobalt redox couples (Fig. 1), with redox potentials ranging between 0.34 and 1.20 V vs. NHE, and 4 different dyes (Fig. 2) to investigate how the structure of the dyes and the redox couples influence the regeneration rate. Concentration dependent regeneration studies have also been performed. Marcus theory has been applied to describe the rate of electron transfer and to calculate reorganization energies for the different dyes. One of the most interesting predictions of Marcus theory is the existence of an inverted region, where the electron transfer rate decreases with an increase in driving force.16 The inverted region has been observed experimentally for electron transfer from conduction band electrons to oxidized redox species using a homologous series of one electron outer-sphere redox couples on single crystal ZnO electrodes,17 and by changing the driving force for recombination in response to pH on ZnO interfaces.18 Recombination of photoinjected electrons to oxidized dye molecules anchored to mesoporous semiconductors has also been found to be in the Marcus inverted region.14 No evidence for a Marcus inverted region for electron transfer from reduced redox species to oxidized sensitizers has to our knowledge been found. Marcus theory has also been applied here to describe the recombination rate using steady state dark current measurements.

Experimental section
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise noted. L0, D35 and Y123 were prepared according to the published procedures.19–21 Z907 was purchased from Dyesol. The ligands bpy-pz and py-pz were synthesized as described elsewhere.7,22,23 The synthesis of [Co(Mepy-pz)3(PF6)2]n+ and [Co(Me2pz-py-pzMe2)2(CF3SO3)2]n+ can be found in ESI.†
Synthesis of cobalt complexes
The cobalt complexes [Co(ttb-terpy)2(PF6)2]2+, [Co(dm-o-b)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(dmb)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(terpy)2(PF6)2]2+, [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(phen)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(Cl-phen)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(Me2bpy-pz)2(PF6)2]2+, [Co(NO2-phen)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(bpy-pz)2(PF6)2]2+, [Co(Mepy-pz)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(py-pz)3(PF6)2]2+, [Co(Me2pz-py-pzMe2)2(CF3SO3)2]2+, [Co(Cl-phen)3(CF3SO3)2]2+ and [Co(NO2-phen)3(CF3SO3)2]2+ were synthesized as described elsewhere.24–26 Briefly, 1 equiv. of CoCl2·6H2O and 3.3 equiv. of the polypyridine ligand were dissolved in a minimal amount of an appropriate solvent to give a brown-yellow solution. The solution was stirred at reflux for 2 h and an excess of the appropriate counter ion, and if needed diethylether, was added to the solution to precipitate the compound. The product was then filtered, washed with methanol, ethanol and diethylether, dried under vacuum and used without further purification.
Oxidation of the cobalt(II) complexes to cobalt(III) was performed by either adding a slight excess of NOBF4 to a solution of the complex and then by removing the solvent by rotary evaporation, or by adding H2O2 (30%) and HCl dropwise to the solution. The complex was then either redissolved in the solvent or used directly and a large amount of the appropriate counter ion, and if needed diethylether, was added to the solution to precipitate the compound. The final product was washed with diethylether, filtered, dried under vacuum and used without further purification.
Solar cell preparation
TiO2 electrodes were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC15). The glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath overnight using (in order) ethanol, water and ethanol. The glass substrates were pre-treated by immersing in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, washed with water and dried. Mesoporous TiO2 films with an area of 0.25 cm2 were prepared by screen printing 2 layers of colloidal TiO2 paste (60:40 Dyesol 18NR-T:(10:90) ethyl cellulose:terpineol). A light-scattering TiO2 layer (PST-400C, JGC Catalysts and Chemical LTD, gratefully received from JGC Catalysts and Chemical LTD) was deposited on top of the mesoporous TiO2 film. The thickness of the films was measured using a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 3) and was about 13 μm. The electrodes were sintered in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P320) in an air atmosphere using a temperature gradient program with four levels at 180 °C (10 min), 320 °C (10 min), 390 °C (10 min) and 500 °C (60 min). Prior to use, the electrodes were given an additional TiCl4 treatment as described above, followed by another heating step (500 °C (60 min)). When the temperature was cooled to about 90 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM D35 in ethanol and left overnight. The films were then rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dye.
Solar cells were assembled, using a 50 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame, with a platinized counter electrode (TEC8), which was prepared by depositing 10 μl cm−2, 4.8 mM H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol to the glass substrate followed by heating in air at 400 °C for 30 minutes. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through two holes pre-drilled in the counter electrode and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass cover slip. Unless otherwise noted, the electrolyte consisted of 0.2 M Co(L)n(PF6)2, 0.05 M Co(L)n(PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile, where L ascribes the different ligands.
For the dark current measurements electrodes were prepared with TiCl4 pre- and post-treatment by screen printing one layer of Dyesol 18NR-T paste and one light-scattering layer on top, or with a compact layer of TiO2 prepared by spray pyrolysis27 and one layer of 60:40 Dyesol 18NR-T:(10:90) ethyl cellulose:terpineol paste screen-printed on top. The surlyn frame was 25 μm thick and the electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M Co(L)n(PF6)2, 0.025 M Co(L)n(PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile.
Solar cell characterization
Current–voltage (IV) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) giving light with AM 1.5G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 1000 W m−2.
Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a computer-controlled setup consisting of a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110) and a multimeter (Keithley 2700), calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). Electron lifetime measurements were performed using a white LED (Luxeon Star 1W) as the light source.28 Voltage traces were recorded with a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board (National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570) and a custom made system using electromagnetic switches. Electron lifetimes were determined by monitoring photovoltage transients at different light intensities upon applying a small square wave modulation to the base light intensity. The photovoltaic responses were fitted using first-order kinetics to obtain time constants.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements
TiO2 films for TAS measurements were prepared by doctor blading colloidal TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T) diluted 60:40 by weight with isopropanol on microscope glass slides. The film thickness was about 4 μm. The electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing either 0.2 mM of the triphenylamine-based organic dyes, L0, D35 and Y123, in ethanol or 0.3 mM Z907 in 50:50 acetonitrile:tert-butanol. The electrolyte was sandwiched between the sample and a glass cover slip. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M Co(L)n(PF6)2, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert butylpyridine (TBP) in 60:40 acetonitrile:ethylene carbonate.
TAS measurements on a nanosecond timescale were performed on an Edinburgh Instrument LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer using a near-infrared LED (Osram SHF 484, λmax 880 nm, FWHM 80 nm) or a laser diode (780 nm) as probe light and an amplified Si photodiode (Thorlabs PMA10A) as the detector (system response time ∼1 μs). Laser pulses were generated using a frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelight II, 10 Hz repetition rate, pulse width 10 ns) in combination with an OPO (Continuum Surelight), tuned to 480, 500, 580 and 610 nm for L0, Z907, D35 and Y123 sensitized TiO2 films, respectively. The pulse intensity was attenuated to 0.1 mJ cm−2 per pulse by a system using a movable λ/2 plate and a fixed polarizer in combination with a 10% transmittance filter (Thorlabs). The laser intensity was kept low so that only one or a few electrons were produced per TiO2 particle upon pulse irradiation. A cut off filter (Newport, FSQ-RG710) was placed before the detector to block scattering light from the laser. Kinetic traces were obtained at a wavelength of 780 for L0 and Z907, and 880 nm for D35 and Y123 using 640 averages in order to monitor oxidized dye concentrations.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry were performed on an Iviumstat XR potentiostat using a three-electrode setup, with a dye-sensitized TiO2 film on conducting glass as the working electrode, graphite as the counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The electrolyte solution was 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. The reference electrode was calibrated versus ferrocene (+0.63 V vs. NHE).
Results and discussion
The recombination and regeneration rates for the different dyes by the cobalt polypyridine redox couples were measured using transient absorption spectroscopy performed on a nanosecond laser setup. Photoinduced absorption spectroscopy was in addition performed under conditions similar to operational conditions of the DSC to obtain the spectra for the oxidized dye molecules (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). The transient optical signal recorded at 780 or 880 nm after laser pulse excitation for the different dyes is caused by absorption of the oxidized dye molecules, and to a lesser extent the adsorption of electrons in the TiO2. The decrease in absorbance signal in the presence of the inert electrolyte shows the recombination of conduction band electrons with the oxidized dye molecules (k′rec). When cobalt polypyridine electrolyte is added the decay of the signal accelerates, indicating that the cobalt redox couples regenerate the dye molecules (k′reg). Transient absorption traces are shown in Fig. S1 of ESI.†
We will use Marcus theory to analyze the observed electron transfer processes. The rate constant for electron transfer ket is given by eqn (1), where HAB2 is the electronic coupling, λ the reorganization energy and ΔG0 the reaction free energy. (1)
Electron recombination to oxidized dye molecules
The ground state oxidation potentials and the recombination half times for the different dyes are listed in Table 1. The ground state oxidation potentials of the dyes (E0′) were determined on dye-sensitized TiO2 films using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry (Fig. S2 in ESI†). L0 has a significantly more positive E0′ value, 1.28 V vs. NHE, than the other dyes, which have values close to 1 V vs. NHE. The driving force for electron recombination to the oxidized dye is given by the potential difference between the conduction band edge (EC) and E0′ of the dye, and is in the order of 1.5 eV for D35, Y123 and Z907 and about 1.8 eV for L0. It is assumed here that the different dyes induce negligible shifts in the conduction band edge, which is located at about −0.5 V vs. NHE for TiO2 (anatase).

The recombination kinetics is expected to lie in the Marcus inverted region, as the driving force for recombination is larger than the expected reorganization energy of the process for the different sensitizers attached to TiO2. Reorganization energies of about 1 eV have been calculated using DFT methods for dyes structurally similar to D35 and Y123 in solution.29 Binding the dye to TiO2 will lower the reorganization energy.
The differences in recombination half times found for the dyes do not seem to be attributed to differences in the driving force for the reaction, but rather on structural differences between the dye molecules. Clifford et al., found the recombination rate of photoinjected electrons with oxidized ruthenium-based dyes to depend on the spatial separation of the dye HOMO levels and the TiO2 surface, rather than on the driving force for the reaction.30 An exponential dependence of the recombination rate on the spatial separation of the donor and acceptor states (r) was found, in agreement with the typical exponential dependence found for electron transfer reactions with a tunnelling distance, eqn (2), ket ∝ exp(−βr)(2)in which β is a measure of the barrier height. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the logarithm of the inverted recombination half times for the different dyes investigated versus the spatial separation between the location of the positive charge in the oxidized dye and the TiO2 surface. For the oxidized triphenylamine-based organic dyes the positive charge is assumed to be located on the nitrogen of the triphenylamine group, whereas for oxidized Z907 it is assumed to be analogous to N719, for which it has been calculated to be located on both Ru and the NCS ligands.30 The recombination rate decreases with spatial separation between the positive charge in the dye and the TiO2 surface. The decrease is roughly exponential in agreement with the results from Clifford et al.30 Deviations from the exponential behaviour are likely due to differences in the nature of the linker separating the electron and the hole. The effect of the differences in the driving force for recombination and the reorganization energies for the different dyes on the distance dependence of the recombination rate is expected to have a minor impact on the result and is therefore not taken into account in the above analysis. It can be concluded that the distance between the positive charge in the dye and the TiO2 surface is a main factor affecting the recombination rate to the oxidized dye molecules.

Dye regeneration kinetics
Marcus theory was also applied to describe the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules by cobalt(II) complexes. Fig. 4a shows a semi-logarithmic plot of the inverse of the regeneration half times as a function of the driving force for regeneration of the L0, D35, Y123 and Z907 dye. The drawn lines are fits to the Marcus equation, using the rough approximation that HAB2 and λ are equal for all the cobalt complexes. The driving force for regeneration was calculated from the difference between the formal potential of the redox couple and the ground state oxidation potential of the dye.

The drawn lines are a fit according to Marcus theory. In (b) bidentate ligands are marked as circles and tridentate ligands as squares. 
Most of the cobalt complexes are in the Marcus normal region where −ΔG0 < λ and the regeneration rate constant increases with an increase in the driving force for regeneration. The regeneration rate constant reaches a maximum value when the activation energy (ΔG‡) is 0 and −ΔG0 = λ. Further increase of the driving force for regeneration leads to decrease of the electron transfer rate constant as the Marcus inverted region is reached, where −ΔG0 > λ and an energy barrier for the process again appears. The activation energy is given by eqn (3). (3)
Because of the lack of cobalt complexes of similar structures with lower redox potentials, it is, however, not straightforward to demonstrate whether the Marcus inverted region or the diffusion-limited region is reached. As outlined by Daeneke et al., a second order diffusion limited regeneration rate constant, kD (M−1 s−1) can be estimated using a modified model for diffusion-controlled reaction, which describes the reaction of a mobile sphere (the redox couple) with an immobilized hemisphere (the dye) fixed on a plane, by eqn (4),15,31 (4)where D (cm2 s−1) is the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple and rredox and rdye (cm) the radius of the redox couple and the dye, respectively. A lower limit for the diffusion coefficient of the cobalt complexes of 1.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 was estimated from results reported by Cameron et al.,32 who found this value for [Co(dbbip)2]2+ in a 40:60 acetonitrile:ethylene carbonate solvent mixture (whereas 60:40 is used here). By estimating the radius of [Co(bpy)3]2+ from crystallographic data to about 6.5 Å and the radius of D35 to be about 10 Å, an upper limit for the half time for regeneration in the diffusion limit of about 5 ns is calculated. Pseudo-first order reaction kinetics (t1/2 = ln(2)/kD[Co2+]) was assumed in the calculation above, since [Co2+] ≫ [D+] (only one or a few dye molecules are excited per TiO2 particle) and the concentration of Co2+ can be considered constant in the measurements. As we have found half times in the μs range for dye regeneration by the cobalt complexes, the diffusion limitation is not reached in our experiments. Even though Nelson et al. determined that the diffusion of cobalt complexes is about 9 times slower inside the dyed TiO2 films compared to in the bulk electrolyte,33 diffusion limitation of the regeneration rate is expected on a much shorter time scale than the experimentally found regeneration kinetics for the cobalt complexes. We can therefore attribute the obtained trends in the regeneration rate vs. driving force (Fig. 4a) to the kinetics of the electron transfer only and can therefore use the Marcus theory. The levelling off of the rate constants for dye regeneration is a clear indication that the Marcus inverted region is reached for the cobalt complexes that have high driving forces for dye regeneration.
The regeneration half times for the different dyes are nicely fitted to the Marcus equation, giving λ values of 0.70 eV (L0), 0.68 eV (D35), 0.63 eV (Y123) and 0.59 eV (Z907), respectively. In this more comprehensive study a slightly lower reorganization energy for D35 was obtained compared to our previous results (0.8 eV).6 The electronic coupling parameter was found to decrease in the order L0>Z907>D35>Y123. As expected, the electronic coupling decreases with the spatial separation of the donor and acceptor, according to eqn (2).34 The faster regeneration rate found for the L0 dye can be explained by its small size, which makes the access for regeneration by the cobalt redox couple easier. It is important to match the electronic configurations of the dye and the redox mediator in order to obtain a good electronic coupling and a fast regeneration rate. Interestingly, the regeneration kinetics for a ferrocene derivative was not found to depend on the structure of the dye, for a series of carbazole dyes.15
De Angelis and co-workers calculated the reorganization energies for regeneration by a series of cobalt complexes and a number of dyes. Using an equilibrium solvation assumption, they determined λ-values of about 0.6 eV for regeneration by cobalt complexes in the low spin state, and about 1.4 eV for the high spin state (an additional 0.6 eV increase in λ was calculated for non-equilibrium solvation).35 They found, moreover, that the regeneration mainly proceeds via a low spin pathway and that the main contribution to the system reorganization energy comes from the cobalt complexes. Based on their results, our assumption of equal reorganization energies for all the cobalt complexes seems to be justified. The system reorganization energy for dye regeneration determined here, 0.6–0.7 eV, is in excellent agreement with the calculated results reported by De Angelis et al.,35 although it must be noted that higher values are expected when solvent reorientation takes place.

Fig. 4b shows the inverse of the regeneration half time as a function of the driving force for regeneration of the D35 dye separately. Bidentate ligands are marked as circles and tridentate ligands as squares in the figure. The structure of the cobalt redox couples does not seem to influence the regeneration rate constants significantly, which is in good agreement with the assumption of equal reorganization energy for all the cobalt complexes. Slightly higher regeneration rates were, however, found for [Co(terpy)2]n+, in agreement with expectations from De Angelis et al. who calculated a slightly lower reorganization energy and a low spin as the low lying spin-state for [Co(terpy)2]n+.35 The regeneration half times and the regeneration efficiencies for the D35 dye are shown in Table 2.

Regeneration efficiency
The regeneration efficiency gives the fraction of oxidized dye molecules that are regenerated by the redox mediator and is estimated from the half times of the transient absorption signals, t1/2redox in the presence of a redox mediator and t1/2inert in the inert electrolyte, using eqn (5). k′reg and k′rec are pseudo-first order rate constants for regeneration of the sensitizer by the redox mediator and the back electron transfer rate constant from the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band to the oxidized dye molecules, respectively. (5)
A plot with the regeneration efficiencies for the different dyes versus the formal potential of the cobalt complexes is shown in Fig. S3 in ESI.† The regeneration efficiency is in general high for all the different dyes using cobalt complexes with driving forces for regeneration of above 0.4 eV. The regeneration efficiency decreases, however, for cobalt complexes with a driving force for regeneration in between 0.2 and 0.4 eV and then levels off when the driving force for regeneration is less than 0.2 eV. This is in agreement with the result for ferrocene redox couples, where it was found that a driving force for regeneration of above a threshold of 0.2 eV was necessary to regenerate the dye molecules, and that the maximum regeneration rate was obtained when a ferrocene derivative with a driving force for regeneration of above 0.35 eV was employed, as the diffusion limited region was reached.15,36 A slightly higher driving force for regeneration seems, however, to be needed for cobalt polypyridine redox couples (0.4 eV compared to 0.35 eV for ferrocene) because of the slower electron transfer kinetics expected as a result of the change in spin when going from Co2+ to Co3+. Since most of the other Co2+ complexes exist in the high spin state, the subsequent conversion from high to low spin is expected to result in an additional potential loss. The regeneration efficiency was still, however, relatively high for the Y123 dye even for cobalt complexes with a low driving force for regeneration, since the regeneration efficiency also depends on the recombination rate constant of the dye. It is therefore very important to tune the structure of the dye to retard recombination to the oxidized dye molecules, when working with redox couples with a low driving force for regeneration.
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of the cobalt complexes was measured to correlate the trend in regeneration efficiencies found with the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage characteristics for D35 sensitized DSCs employing some of the cobalt complexes with more positive redox potentials. The open circuit voltage of the DSCs is shown to increase with the redox potential of the cobalt complexes, in agreement with previous results,6 and the highest VOC of 1.02 V was obtained for [Co(bpy-pz)2]n+. A linear increase in VOC with increasing redox potential was, however, not found, which is likely a result of a negative shift in the Fermi level because of increased recombination to cobalt complexes with more positive redox potentials, as discussed in ref. 6. The VOC decreases again for cobalt redox couples with more positive redox potentials than [Co(bpy-pz)2]n+, as a result of enhanced recombination, because of the slow regeneration kinetics found for these cobalt complexes. Table S1 in ESI† shows the current–voltage characteristics for the different devices.

The current and the IPCE (Fig. 5b) decrease, as the regeneration efficiencies decrease, with the more positive redox potential of the cobalt complexes. Table 2 shows the regeneration efficiencies and the maximum IPCE values obtained at 460 nm for D35 sensitized DSCs employing the different cobalt redox couples. For the sake of comparison of all the different cobalt complexes, IPCE values for DSCs with a low concentrated electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M Co(L)n(PF6)2, 0.025 M Co(L)n(PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile were listed in the table. Electrodes were prepared with one layer of Dyesol 18 NR-T paste and one scattering layer.
The IPCE is determined by several factors: the light harvesting efficiency (ηLHE), the injection efficiency (ηinj), the regeneration efficiency (ηreg) and the collection efficiency (ηcc), see eqn (6). IPCE = ηLHEηinjηregηcc(6)
The lower IPCE values found compared to the regeneration efficiencies indicate that the solar cells are also limited by any of the other three parameters. The light harvesting efficiency and the injection efficiency are, however, not estimated limiting factors, since high IPCE values were obtained for the cobalt complexes with the less positive redox potentials. Solar cells using the cobalt complexes with more positive redox potentials are therefore suggested to be limited by a low regeneration efficiency and a low charge collection efficiency. From a normalized plot of the IPCE spectra in Fig. 5b (see Fig. S4 in ESI†) it is evident that the charge collection efficiency decreases with the redox potential of the cobalt complexes. In our recent publications we reported regeneration efficiencies similar to the maximum IPCE values.6 The regeneration efficiencies were, however, lower in that report and it should be noted that the electrodes were prepared in a different way, which is likely to influence the result.
Concentration dependent regeneration kinetics
The effect of cobalt(II) complex concentration on the regeneration kinetics was investigated for two cobalt complexes. For the measurements using [Co(Cl-phen)3]2+ electrolyte the regeneration was fast and the amplitude of the signal decreased significantly when the more concentrated electrolyte was added. For [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ regeneration was sluggish in comparison (see Fig. S5 in ESI†). Fig. 6 shows a plot of the observed regeneration rate constant k′regversus the concentration of the redox couples for the two cobalt complexes (the calculation of k′reg for ns-transient absorption traces is described in ESI†). The dye regeneration becomes gradually faster with higher Co(II) concentration. The regeneration rate for oxidized dye molecules by cobalt redox couples is expected to be of the form: rate = k′reg[D+] = kreg[D+][Co2+](7)where kreg is the second order rate constant for dye regeneration. A linear relation between k′reg and Co(II) concentration is expected and indeed found in Fig. 6. A regeneration rate constant of 1.5 × 105 M−1 s−1 for [Co(Cl-phen)3]2+ and 2.4 × 104 M−1 s−1 for [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+, is determined from the slopes. O'Regan and coworkers found a similar trend in the regeneration rate for [I−] and determined a second order rate constant of 7.8 × 105 M−1 s−1 for [I−] by measuring the short circuit current as well as the transient absorption kinetics.37 Nusbaumer et al. found, above a threshold concentration of 10−2 M, a linear increase in the regeneration rate with a concentration of N719 sensitized DSCs using [Co(dbbip)2]n+, and determined a kreg of 2.9 × 106 M−1 s−1.38
 Fig. 6  Observed regeneration rate constants as a function of the concentration of [Co(Cl-phen)3]2+ (blue squares) and [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ (green circles). 
The regeneration efficiency increased for [Co(Cl-phen)3]2+ to 99% and for [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ to 84% by using a four times higher concentration than in the initial measurements. A driving force for regeneration of 0.25 eV for [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ is therefore sufficient to regenerate 84% of the D35 dye molecules when a higher concentration of the redox couple is used.
Recombination of electrons in TiO2 with cobalt(III) complexes
Dark current measurements were performed to investigate the effect of the driving force for recombination on the recombination rate. The net flux of electrons from the conduction band to randomly dissolved acceptors in a solution is given by eqn (8), under the assumption that the current density (J) is first order dependent on the concentration of acceptor species [A] and the electron concentration at the surface of the semiconductor (ns). J(E) = −qket[A]ns(8)E is the applied potential and q is the elemental charge of an electron. If this assumption holds true, the rate constant for recombination of conduction band electron with oxidized redox species (ket) is directly proportional to the steady state dark current, and the Marcus equation can be applied to describe the dark current density as a function of the driving force for recombination. Here, we will compare dark currents at a fixed quasi-Fermi level in the TiO2 so that we can make qualitative comparison of the rate constants even if the current densities do not scale linearly with concentration of conduction band electrons.

Fig. 7a shows the current density measured at an applied potential of −0.2 V vs. NHE to the mesoporous TiO2 electrode as a function of the formal potential of the different cobalt redox couples. Complete dark IV curves are shown in Fig. S6 in ESI.† For comparison DSCs without a sensitizing dye and with spray pyrolyzed underlayers were included in this study, to investigate the blocking effect of the dye and to prevent electron transfer from the substrate. The lower dark currents observed in the presence of the D35 dye compared to the bare TiO2 film illustrate that recombination is significantly slowed down by using a dye with steric substituents. A further significant decrease of the dark current densities occurs when a spray pyrolyzed TiO2 underlayer is used, indicating that electron recombination from the FTO substrate may not be neglected. The overall trend in dark current densities is similar for all the devices investigated, showing a maximum dark current for [Co(terpy)2]n+.

The line in (b) is a fit according to the Marcus equation. Blue circles and green triangles symbolize TiO2 electrodes prepared using TiCl4 pre-and post-treatment, and red squares symbolize TiO2 electrodes prepared using spray pyrolyzed underlayers. 
For the three cobalt complexes with the most negative formal potential, recombination appears to be in the Marcus normal region: the current increases with increase in driving force. For cobalt complexes with the higher driving forces for e−(TiO2) to Co(III) recombination, the reaction appears to be in the Marcus inverted region, as the dark current decreases. Interestingly, the dark current increases again for the cobalt complexes with the highest driving force for recombination. Hamann and coworkers measured recombination from TiO2 electrodes to two different outer sphere redox couples ([Co(Me2bpy)3]n+ and [Ru(bpy)2(MeIm)2]n+). They found that the main recombination pathway to [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+ was from electrons in the conduction band, while recombination from surface states played a significant role in the recombination to [Ru(bpy)2(MeIm)2]3+, which had a more positive redox potential.39 The recombination from conduction band electrons to [Ru(bpy)2(MeIm)2]3+ was suggested to be in the Marcus inverted region and significantly slower compared to recombination from an exponential distribution of surface states and monoenergetic surface states. The higher dark current obtained for the cobalt complexes with the most positive redox potential in our study is therefore likely a result of increased recombination from surface states.
The dark current densities for the D35 sensitized DSCs employing the different cobalt complexes were well fitted to the Marcus equation shown in Fig. 7b. The cobalt complexes with the highest driving force for recombination were not included in the modelling because of increased recombination from surface states. The driving force for recombination of conduction band electrons to the redox mediator is given by the difference between the conduction band edge in TiO2 and the formal potential of the redox couple. Using this approach, a reorganization energy of 1.05 eV is obtained, which is somewhat higher than the reorganization energies found in the regeneration reaction. Since recombination to most of the cobalt complexes occurred in the Marcus inverted region, recombination losses to the Co(III) do not increase with increasing redox potential of the cobalt complexes, if quantitative regeneration is obtained. Recombination to cobalt complexes with redox potentials above 0.85 V vs. NHE is, however, significantly enhanced because of increased recombination through TiO2 surface states.
The electron lifetimes of D35 sensitized DSCs employing the different cobalt redox mediators were also investigated by studying the photovoltage response to a small amplitude light modulation. Fig. 8 shows a semi-logarithmic plot of the electron lifetimes as a function of the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 for D35 sensitized DSCs employing cobalt polypyridine redox couples. Electrodes with spray pyrolyzed underlayers were investigated to avoid electron shunting from the substrate. The same trend as in the measurement of the dark current is observed, i.e. that the electron lifetime decreases for the three cobalt redox complexes with the lowest driving force for recombination, and then it increases and starts to decrease again for the cobalt complexes with a higher driving force for recombination. The exponential dependence of the electron lifetime with light intensity is explained using the multiple-trapping model, in which recombination occurs from the conduction band after the electrons have been thermally excited from trap states.40 The electron lifetimes are indeed linear in a semi-logarithmic plot of the electron lifetimes for the cobalt complexes with the lowest driving force for recombination, but deviates from linearity for the cobalt complexes with a higher driving force for recombination. The same trend was found by Hamann and coworkers, where the electron lifetime for [Ru(bpy)2(MeIm)2]n+ had a parabolic shape, because of a significant recombination via surface states.39 The longest electron lifetime is, in contrast to the results of the dark current measurements, observed for [Co(bpy)3]n+, indicating that under the experimental conditions employed, the performance of DSCs using cobalt complexes with higher redox potentials is limited by the slow regeneration kinetics, which increases recombination losses.

Conclusions
Marcus theory was successfully applied to describe the regeneration and recombination rate for DSCs employing a series of different cobalt polypyridine redox couples, with redox potentials ranging from 0.34 to 1.2 V vs. NHE. The regeneration by most of the cobalt complexes occurred in the Marcus normal region, where the regeneration rate increases as the driving force for regeneration increases. The regeneration efficiency for all dyes investigated under the experimental conditions employed was high for cobalt complexes with a high driving force for regeneration, but decreased when a cobalt complex with a driving force for regeneration of 0.4 eV and less was employed. The regeneration rate increased, however, with the concentration of the cobalt complexes, and [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+, which has a driving force for regeneration of 0.25 eV, was found to regenerate 84% of the D35 dye molecules, when a highly concentrated electrolyte was used. Steady state dark current measurements revealed that the recombination for cobalt complexes with E0′ higher than +0.5 V vs. NHE occurred in the Marcus inverted region, where the recombination rate decreases with an increase in driving force for recombination. Recombination from surface states significantly contributed to the overall recombination rate for cobalt complexes with the highest driving force for recombination.
Our hope is that these results will help in the design of new redox couples for DSCs. Regeneration and recombination aspects need to be studied carefully when working with redox shuttles with high redox potentials in order to minimize energy losses in the system. We have shown that high regeneration efficiencies can be obtained using redox mediators with a low driving force for regeneration by tuning the structure of the dyes to retard recombination to oxidized dye molecules, and by increasing the concentration of the cobalt complexes. It is also important to have a good electronic coupling between the dye and the redox mediator in order to obtain fast regeneration rates, and more research has to be focused on matching the electronic configuration of the dyes and the redox mediators. Since recombination of electrons in TiO2 to most of the cobalt complexes occurred in the Marcus inverted region, this recombination is relatively slow. For the cobalt complexes with the highest redox potentials, however, recombination mediated by surface states becomes important.
