This can be related to the respective aromaticity and antiaromaticity of the reduced forms of 9,9′BF or 4,4′BP. The OPV device fabricated using P3HT and 9,9′BF exhibited a PCE of 2.28% with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 5.04 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.42.Fullerene derivatives are currently widely used as n-type semiconductors in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells because they have high electron affinity and good electron transporting ability.1 However, they also have some drawbacks as electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) such as weak absorption in the visible region, and difficult synthesis and purification. To solve these problems, new electron accepting materials with high absorbance in the solar spectrum, facile synthesis, and controllable frontier orbital energy levels are needed for OPV applications. Recently some non-fullerene type electron accepting materials have been reported for BHJ PSCs including fluoranthene-fused imide,2 diketopyrrolopyrrole,3 benzothiadiazole,4 bifluorenylidene derivatives,5 and others.6 Among the reported non-fullerene acceptors, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (9,9′BF) derivatives have attracted much scientific attention since the first report by Wudl and co-workers. They conjectured that 9,9′BF derivatives could easily accept one electron from a donor polymer because the reduced form would acquire more aromaticity by fulfilling Hückel's requirements.5,7–10 Several 9,9′BF derivatives have been reported as electron acceptors for OPVs, but to date only one, 12-(3,6-dimethoxy-fluoren-9-ylidene)-12H-dibenzo[b,h]fluorene (D99′BF), has shown a reasonable photovoltaic effect (1.7% PCE).5,11 Moreover, the photo-physical properties of 9,9′BF and its application to OPVs have not been reported yet.In this study, we chose to compare the photo-physical properties of 9,9′BF and 4,4′-bicyclopenta[def]phen-anthrenylidene (4,4′BP) as electron acceptors for OPVs because 9,9′BF forms a 4n + 2 aromatic system while 4,4′BP forms a 4n anti-aromatic system when they accept one electron. The chemical structures of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP are shown in Fig. 1. The UV-visible absorption spectra of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP solutions in chloroform and solid thin films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Both 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP showed three main absorption bands. Fig. 1  Chemical structures of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP, and their reduced forms. The first and second bands correspond to the π–π* transitions of the fluorene in 9,9′BF or phenanthrene units in 4,4′BP, while the last band corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated bifluorenylidene or phenanthrenylidene structures. In the thin film, 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP showed similar band shape but the edge wavelength of the film moved slightly to a longer wavelength region than those of the corresponding solutions. The optical band gap energy (Eoptg) of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP were determined to be 2.14 and 1.99 eV, respectively, according to the onset absorption wavelength. To investigate the charge transfer characteristics between poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the acceptors (9,9′BF and 4,4′BP), the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was performed. The PL spectra of the P3HT solution in chloroform were measured at different acceptor concentrations. The pure P3HT solution showed peak emission at 579 nm, and the PL intensity of the P3HT solution decreased upon increasing the concentration of both 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP. Especially the PL intensity was dramatically decreased by adding very low concentration of 9,9′BF. To investigate the quenching efficiency of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP we used a Stern–Volmer quenching plot.12Φo/Φ = 1 + Ksv[Q]where Φo and Φ are PL quantum efficiencies in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively, Ksv is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the concentration of quencher. The obtained Stern–Volmer plots of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP are shown in Fig. 2. The plots show a linear regime in the quencher concentration range 0 to 10−4 M. The obtained Stern–Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) values for 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP were 3.21 × 105 and 3.17 × 104 M−1, respectively. The higher Ksv value can be correlated with a higher binding affinity between the fluorophore and quencher, thus indicating that 9,9′BF can accept electrons more easily than 4,4′BP. PL quenching spectra of the donor–acceptor blend films with the same composite ratio and thickness were also measured to observe the PL quenching effect in the solid state. The PL emission spectra of the P3HT, P3HT:9,9′BF (1:0.7), and P3HT:4,4′BP (1:0.7) films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The PL was almost completely quenched in P3HT:9,9′BF (1:0.7) while the PL was only partially quenched in P3HT:4,4′BP (1:0.7) films. Fig. 2  Stern–Volmer quenching plots for (a) 9,9′BF and (b) 4,4′BP; PL quenching spectra of P3HT:quencher in CHCl3 with increasing concentration of quencher (10−4 M). The electrochemical properties of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the onset of the first reduction (Eonsetred) of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP are at −1.06 and −1.20 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The Eonsetred wave of the 9,9′BF was lower by 0.14 eV than that of 4,4′BP, suggesting that 9,9′BF can be more easily reduced than 4,4′BP. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP were measured to be −5.62/−3.48 and −5.33/−3.34 eV, respectively.For further understanding of the molecular structure, we performed theoretical calculations by density functional theory (DFT).13 The top and side views of optimized structures for 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The dihedral angles (θ) between the two fluorene and the two cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene units attached to the core double bond were found to be 30.0 and 27.5°, respectively, in the ground state geometry due to the steric hindrance between neighboring hydrogen atoms. The central 6-membered ring of phenanthrene moieties in 4,4′BP generates some additional strain so that the phenyl rings on both ends are pulled backward. Therefore, the steric hindrance between facing subunits in 4,4′BP is expected to be less significant than that in 9,9′BF, leading to a smaller torsional angle. Despite the smaller torsional angle, the distances between the facing C atoms of each phenanthrene units in 4,4′BP are indeed longer than those of fluorene in 9,9′BF. For example, in the case of 4,4′BP, the distance between facing C atoms next to the ring junction is computed to be 3.28 Å, while that between corresponding C atoms in 9,9′BF is calculated to be 2.88 Å.Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using P3HT as the donor and 9,9′BF or 4,4′BP as the electron acceptors with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor/LiF/Al. To find the optimum blend ratio we used four different donor to acceptor composite ratios (1:0.5, 1:0.7, 1:1, and 1:1.2) for each active layer, and the spin-coated active layers were annealed at different temperatures (70, 90, and 150 °C) for 10 min. The devices fabricated using 4,4′BP did not show any detectable photovoltaic effect. The most efficient devices fabricated using 9,9′BF were achieved at a blend ratio of 1:0.7 and film thickness of 100 nm. The power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of the optimized device was 1.07% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.28 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.31, respectively. The Voc values of the device fabricated using 9,9′BF were much higher than those of P3HT:PC60BM devices (∼0.65 V).14 This high Voc of the P3HT:9,9′BF device could be due to the higher LUMO energy level of 9,9′BF than that of PC60BM.13 Interestingly, the performances (Voc, Jsc and FF) of the devices were improved after thermal annealing. The device fabricated using the 1:0.7 blend ratio annealed at 70 °C for 10 min exhibited the highest PCE of 2.28% with a Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 5.04 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.42, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The performances of the devices were slightly decreased after thermal annealing at temperatures higher than 70 °C (90 and 150 °C) as summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The photovoltaic parameters of the devices fabricated using the P3HT:9,9′BF active layer after thermal annealing are summarized in Table 1.

The maximum EQE of the device fabricated using P3HT:9,9′BF (1:0.7) annealed at 70 °C was 30.2% at 560 nm. The Jsc values of the fabricated PSC devices were well matched with the integrated Jsc obtained from the EQE spectrum.To measure the charge carrier mobilities of P3HT:9,9′BF and P3HT:4,4′BP blend films we fabricated hole-only and electron-only devices. The hole and electron mobilities of P3HT:9,9′BF and P3HT:4,4′BP (1:0.7) active layers with different annealing temperatures were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4  Field-dependent electron mobilities of (a) P3HT:9,9′BF (1:0.7, w/w) and (b) P3HT:4,4′BP (1:0.7, w/w) blend films (pristine and after annealing) calculated from the electron-only devices by fitting J–V curves in the SCLC regime. The hole mobilities of both the P3HT:9,9′BF and P3HT:4,4′BP blend films were similar (∼9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) at an electric field of 500 (V cm−1)1/2, and gradually increased upon thermal annealing up to 150 °C (∼5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). This could be attributed to the increased crystallinity of P3HT in the active layer after thermal treatment. The electron mobility of the pristine P3HT:9,9′BF active layer was measured to be 1.62 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, and was increased to 4.73 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing at 70 °C. However, the electron mobility of a P3HT:9,9′BF film decreased after thermal annealing at temperatures higher than 70 °C. This result is consistent with the Jsc values of the OPV devices fabricated using the P3HT:9,9′BF active layer after thermal annealing. The device fabricated using P3HT:9,9′BF after thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min showed the highest Jsc. The electron mobility of the pristine P3HT:4,4′BP film (1.74 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1) was much lower than that of the P3HT:9,9′BF, and gradually increased after thermal annealing but the absolute value was very low even after thermal annealing at 150 °C (3.47 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1). These low electron mobilities of the P3HT:4,4′BP active layer could be the main reason for the negligible photovoltaic effect of the fabricated OPV devices. The hole and electron mobilities of P3HT:9,9′BF and P3HT:4,4′BP are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†).Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows AFM images of pristine P3HT:9,9′BF films (1:0.7, w/w) and after thermal annealing. In the AFM images, the brighter islands correspond to the P3HT domains and darker valleys to the 9,9′BF segment. Better heterojunction morphology and phase separation was readily observable after thermal annealing. The surface root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the pristine P3HT:9,9′BF active layers, annealed at 70, 90, and 150 °C were 6.00, 7.45, 7.93, and 9.77 nm, respectively. In general, annealed P3HT films show a rougher surface than the corresponding pristine films due to a higher degree of P3HT self-organization.15 Among the AFM images, P3HT:9,9′BF blend films annealed at 70 °C showed better phase and aggregation than that of the pristine film. However, the same film annealed at 90 °C exhibited somewhat enlarged 9,9′BF domains and phase separation. In addition, it could be observed that the active layer annealed at 150 °C exhibited much larger phase separation and domain size than those of the other annealed films. The large phase domains would lead to a smaller interfacial area, which is unfavorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.In conclusion, we have investigated 9,9′BF and 4,4′BP as electron acceptors for P3HT-based bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells. 9,9′BF effectively quenched PL of P3HT. Furthermore, 9,9′BF showed two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility than 4,4′BP. The OPV device fabricated using 9,9′BF showed 2.28% of PCE which is the highest value reported so far for devices fabricated using 9,9′BF derivatives while the device fabricated using 4,4′BP did not show any photovoltaic effect. We conclude that the aromaticity of the reduced form of 9,9′BF derivatives appears to be important in determining their electron-accepting and also charge-transporting abilities, which is consistent with the original hypothesis of Wudl.This work was supported by a grant (No. 2012055225) from the Center for Advanced Soft Electronics under the Global Frontier Research Program of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Korea, a National Research Foundation (NRF) grant (No. 2011-0011122), and a NRF grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) through GCRC-SOP (No. 2011-0030013).Notes and references
