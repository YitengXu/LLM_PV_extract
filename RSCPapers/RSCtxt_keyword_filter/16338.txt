    , Accepted 24th January 2017First published on 25th January 2017AbstractOne-step solution fabrication of high-performance Sn-including perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is very challenging due to the rapid crystallization of the Sn-based perovskite layer, leading to a poor film morphology and low surface coverage. In this work, a well-controlled one-step method, assisted by a multi-step solvent treatment, is developed for the growth of a high-quality CH3NH3Pb(1−x)SnxI3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskite film on a planar PEDOT:PSS substrate. The CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films consisting of densely packed and uniformly distributed large crystal grains were obtained using sec-butyl alcohol solvent engineering and N,N-dimethylformamide solvent annealing under an N2 atmosphere. The CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.08% and an average PCE of 11.01% were obtained. The PSCs also exhibit excellent performance reproducibility, good air stability and weak hysteresis behavior. The enhancement in the performance of the PSCs is attributed to the well-crystallized CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3 film, resulting in simultaneous improvement in charge–carrier transport properties and reduction in charge–carrier recombination, a very promising approach to obtain high performance Sn-including perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted considerable attention because of their low-cost solution fabrication process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–6 So far, a highest PCE of >22% has been achieved.7 More impressively, a PCE of 18.2% for perovskite–fullerene graded heterojunction-based PSCs, with a large active area of 1 cm2, was confirmed.8 To date, almost all of the PSCs with high PCE have been based on Pb halide perovskite materials.1–8 Compared with the progress made in Pb-containing PSCs, the performance of Sn-including PSCs is less than satisfactory.9–16 It is known that Sn-including perovskite materials have unique advantages over the Pb-based perovskite materials, such as broader spectral response covering from the visible light to near-infrared region,17,18 much higher charge mobility,19,20 and being more eco-friendly.21 These merits suggest the great potential of Sn-including perovskite materials as efficient light absorbers for developing commercially available PSC technology. The relatively low PCE of Sn-including PSCs is one of the challenges, which is primarily due to the poor morphology and coverage of the perovskite film and the oxidation of Sn2+ ions.10,11,13–16 In order to obtain high-quality Sn-containing perovskite thin films, various methods had been attempted. A PCE of 10.1% for an inverted planar PSC with a CH3NH3Sn0.15Pb0.85I3−xClx absorber was reported,13 due to the improved perovskite film coverage upon addition of the Cl element. Lately, a PCE of 10.25% was achieved using a planar perovskite solar cell with a CH3NH3Sn0.1Pb0.9I3 layer prepared via a two-step solution process with thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing.14 An enhanced PCE of 13.6% was observed in an inverted planar cell employing a Pb-assisted two-step method to fabricate a high-quality CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite film.15 More remarkably, CH3NH3Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite-based inverted PSCs with a maximum PCE of 14.12% were realized via a two-step solution process by dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) solvent engineering.16
Usually, perovskite films can be deposited on substrates through in situ reactions of precursors via one- or two-step methods.1,2,22,23 Compared with the two-step spin coating process, one-step spin coating is simpler and faster, and thus more favorable for the development of high performance PSCs at low cost. However, it is very challenging to obtain a homogeneous nonporous planar perovskite film by direct spin-coating of the precursor solution of blended composition.23,24 Especially, the fabrication of Sn-including perovskite films could face a larger challenge because the Sn-perovskites tend to quickly crystallize even at room temperature, which leads to uncontrollable crystal growth.11,13,14 It is reported that the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite film fabricated via the traditional one-step method displayed larger roughness and lower surface coverage than that fabricated via the two-step method, hence leading to very poor cell performance with a PCE of merely ∼1.1%.15
In this work, a one-step solution process that involves a combination of sec-butyl alcohol solvent engineering and a DMF solvent annealing step under a N2 atmosphere was developed successfully to obtain high-quality Sn-including perovskite films. As a result, CH3NH3Sn0.25Pb0.75I3-based planar heterojunction PSCs, with a cathode-buffer-free device structure, having an encouraging maximum PCE of 12.08% and an average PCE of 11.01%, were demonstrated. The PSCs also exhibit excellent performance reproducibility, good air stability and weak hysteresis behavior.
2. Experimental
Preparation of MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films
The MASnxPb(1−x)I3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite precursor solution was formulated by dissolving a mixture of SnI2 (99.999%, Alfa Asear), PbI2 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and CH3NH3I (MAI, 99%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) in a molar ratio of x:(1 − x):1.1 in a mixed solvent prepared using DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide, 99.5%, Aladdin) and DMSO (99.5%, Aladdin) at a volume ratio of 10:1. The MASnxPb(1−x)I3 thin films on the surface of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) substrate were formed by spin-coating the precursor solution at 6300 rpm, and after 5–13 s of delay time the rotated wet films were washed with sec-butyl alcohol (99%, Aladdin) to promote fast nucleation and crystal growth. After the rotation stopped, the films were transferred onto a hot plate for annealing at 100 °C for 25 s, followed by soaking in sec-butyl alcohol for 8–10 s to remove excess MAI. Subsequently, the films were dried by spinning the substrates at 6300 rpm for 35 s. Finally, the films were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 35 min under a N2 atmosphere and subsequently solvent annealed in a DMF atmosphere at 100 °C for 35 min to assist the growth of crystalline domains. The film processes were conducted in a nitrogen-purged glove box with oxygen and moisture levels below 0.1 ppm. A schematic illustration of the fabrication steps of MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films is described in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
Fabrication of MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells have the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MASnxPb(1−x)I3/PC60BM/Al. Prior to the cell fabrication, the pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each. Next, the aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 (Heraeus) was spun onto ITO as a hole transport layer at 3000 rpm for 35 s in air, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Sequentially, MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films with a thickness of about 300 nm as an absorber were formed on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. Then, a chlorobenzene solution of [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM, 99.5%, Solenne), with a concentration of 20 mg ml−1, was spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer as an electron-transporting layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the device was obtained by thermal evaporation of an Al (150 nm) electrode.
Characterization
The surface morphology of the films was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The crystallinity of the perovskite films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the films were measured using an UV-Visible spectrometer with an integrating sphere (Shimadzu UV-2600). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all cells in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination were measured using a programmable SourceMeter (Keithley 2400), with forward and backward scan rates of 0.08 V s−1. The illumination was provided by a Sun 3000 Solar Simulator from ABET Technologies. The illumination power was corrected to 100 mW cm−2 using a standard Si solar cell (certified by NREL). For the J–V measurement, a black mask with an aperture (0.16 cm2) was used to define the active area of the devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength was recorded using ZOLIX CSC1011 with a short arc xenon lamp source (Ushio UXL-553). The spot area of the incident beam is about 0.07 cm2. A Si photodetector model (certified by National Institute of Metrology, China) with known EQE was used to determine the spectral response of PSCs. All measurements were performed without encapsulation.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a champion MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSC, with a PCE of 12.08%, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.00 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68%, measured under forward voltage scan with a scan rate of 0.08 V s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding PSC is shown in Fig. 1b. The calculated JSC from the EQE spectrum is 24.95 mA cm−2, which is well consistent with that obtained from the J–V measurement, indicating the authenticity of the measured JSC.25 As shown in the top-view SEM image in Fig. 1c, the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite layer formed on the surface of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate possesses a very good coverage and high uniform morphology, consisting of densely packed large crystalline domains across the film. Especially, one can see from the cross-sectional SEM image of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite film, displayed in Fig. 1d, that the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 film shows film-through large grain distribution, which leads to the high performance of PSCs because the charges could be transported and collected through a single grain without encountering grain boundaries and charge traps.

The photocurrent hysteresis behavior of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs was measured under forward and backward voltage scans with a scan rate of 0.08 V s−1, as shown in Fig. 1e. It is clear that the PCE of 11.63%, VOC of 0.79 V, JSC of 20.96 mA cm−2, and FF of 70% obtained for the cells under forward voltage scan are very close to those, i.e., a PCE of 11.99%, VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 21.12 mA cm−2, and FF of 71%, measured for the cells under the reverse voltage scan, indicating a weak hysteresis in our MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs. The steady-state measurement of JSC and PCE is performed according to the reported method26 at a fixed bias voltage of 0.57 V and under continuous light illumination for the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSC, as displayed in Fig. 1f. It is observed that the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSC shows the steady-state outputs of a JSC of 19.65 mA cm−2 and PCE of 11.21%, which confirms the accuracy of our efficiency characterization and also verifies the weak photocurrent hysteresis in our devices.
In order to investigate the effect of Sn content on the performance of PSCs, the performance of the MASnxPb1−xI3-based PSCs, with x over the range from 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35 to 1 in MASnxPb1−xI3, was analyzed. All MASnxPb1−xI3 PSCs were prepared using the same fabrication processes. The statistical cell parameters averaged from at least ten measurements for each type of PSC are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is observed that the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs yield the highest performance parameters, with an average PCE of 11.24%, an average VOC of 0.80 V, an average JSC of 21.03 mA cm−2 and an average FF of 0.67. While more or less content of Sn inside the perovskite films leads to a notable drop in the performance of cells. Especially pure Sn halide perovskite does not show photovoltaic properties due to short-circuit behavior.11,18,27Fig. 2a and b shows J–V curves and EQE of the best performing devices with different Sn contents, e.g., x = 0, 0.25, 0.35 and 1 in MASnxPb1−xI3. It is observed from Fig. 2a that compared with the MAPbI3 device, JSC and FF of the Sn-including device obviously increase while VOC decreases. The increase in the JSC is mainly due to the smaller optical band gaps of Sn-including perovskite materials and their wider light response relative to MAPbI3. As reflected in Fig. 2b, the EQE spectra gradually extend from 800 nm to 990 nm with a red-shift of almost 190 nm as the Sn content increases from 0 to 35%. As deduced from the EQE data, there is an obvious decrease in the band gap of MASnxPb1−xI3 with an increase in the Sn content, e.g., 1.55 eV for MAPbI3, 1.26 eV for MASn0.25Pb0.75 and 1.25 eV for MASn0.35Pb0.65, similar to the previous results reported for MASnxPb1−xI3.17 Meanwhile, it should be noted that JSC of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 PSC is higher than that of the MASn0.35Pb0.65 PSC though these two types of perovskite materials have similar band gaps. This discrepancy might be ascribed to the better carrier transport and collection due to the film-through single-grain distribution in the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 film. In addition, the decrease in the VOC of the MASnxPb1−xI3-based cells is probably associated with their lower energy band edge compared to that of MAPbI3.28 Our results reveal that the VOC of MASn0.15Pb0.85I3 PSCs is lower than that of MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 PSCs, which might be related to other loss mechanisms, such as trap density, which has a great impact on VOC.29,30 The trap density increases in the MASn0.15Pb0.85I3 film because the decrease in the grain size could result in a larger electron/hole recombination rate and hence lower VOC.

Inset of (d) and (e): The enlarged Bragg diffraction peaks at 14 degree and the enlarged UV-vis absorption spectra at the long wavelength region for MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films. 
In order to further understand the effect of Sn content on the performance of PSCs, the morphologies of perovskite films with different Sn contents were analyzed by SEM measurement. At the same time, the average contents of Sn and Pb in the films are confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). EDS elemental mapping (see Fig. S3, ESI†) indicates that the Sn:Pb molar ratio is 0.132:0.868, 0.255:0.745 and 0.375:0.625 successively, which is well consistent with that in the precursor solution, which unquestionably demonstrates that the target perovskite films are obtained. Fig. 2c displays the top-view SEM images of MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite films with different Sn contents and the grain size distribution of the corresponding films. From Fig. 2c one can clearly see the morphological evolution of MASnxPb1−xI3 films with the change in x. The pure lead perovskite films (i.e. x = 0) contain some large grains but more small grains with an average grain size of 477 nm. With the increase of x from 0.15 to 0.35, the crystal grain size becomes large with an average grain size of 794 nm for x = 0.15 and 860 nm for x = 0.35. Especially when x = 0.25, the perovskite film exhibits the best morphology, showing very densely packed crystalline domains with an average grain size of 870 nm, which is highly desirable for high performance cells. The crystallinity of MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite films was further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as shown in Fig. 2d. It is observed from Fig. 2d that the prominent Bragg diffraction peaks of all MASnxPb1−xI3 films with different Sn contents are located at about 2θ = 14°, 28° and 32°, which are ascribed to the (110), (220) and (310) lattice planes, respectively, indicating that all MASnxPb(1−x)I3 films have similar crystal units with a tetragonal structure in the space group I4cm.17 But it should be noted that the Bragg diffraction intensity, e.g. at 2θ = 14°, first increases and then decreases as the x value increases and reaches the largest value when x = 0.25, implying that the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films have best crystallinity, in good agreement with the SEM images shown in Fig. 2c. The well-crystallized MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films have low trap density, and hence exhibit the highest VOC among all Sn-including PSCs (see Fig. 2a). The low trap density of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films also directly leads to the low leakage current in the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 PSC, as reflected in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 2e shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite films. It is observed that all Sn-including perovskite films show a significantly extended solar absorption range even upon incorporating a slight Sn content, indicating that the solar cells using MASnxPb(1−x)I3 (x ≠ 0) as an absorber could utilize more sunlight than that with MAPbI3. The absorption onset gradually red-shifts as the Sn content in the film increases, in agreement with the change in the corresponding EQE spectra. The above investigations indicate that the prominent performances of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs are attributed to the highly uniform morphology and large crystal grain formation of the perovskite films.
Next, we focus on the effect of the fabrication technique on the quality of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 film. Compared with the numerous studies on the morphological control of the MAPbI3 film,1–8,22–24,31–33 there are not many reports on the growth of Sn–Pb binary perovskite films. In this work, a multi-step solvent treatment assisted by a one-step spin-coating method is adopted to obtain high-quality MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films, including sec-butyl alcohol solvent washing and soaking steps, and the subsequent DMF solution annealing step under an N2 atmosphere. To study the effect of the sec-butyl alcohol solvent washing step on the crystallization of perovskite films with 25% Sn content, we fabricated two samples of MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate with and without the sec-butyl alcohol washing step, but with the same sec-butyl alcohol solvent soaking step and the DMF solvent annealing step. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 samples without the sec-butyl alcohol washing step are shown in Fig. 3a and b. As displayed in Fig. 3a, the morphology of the films fabricated without the sec-butyl alcohol washing step presents many irregular cracks. From Fig. 3b, one can observe that the film is composed of many small loose grains, exhibiting a very poor crystalline structure. By comparing with the densely arranged large grains shown in Fig. 1c and d, it is observed that the sec-butyl alcohol solvent washing technique can effectively modulate the kinetics of growth for Sn-including perovskite films, which is also further confirmed by XRD patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 3c and d. The larger grain films show a stronger Bragg diffraction peak and a slightly higher light absorption ability.

(c) XRD patterns and (d) UV-vis absorption spectra of MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films prepared with and without the sec-butyl alcohol solvent washing process. Inset of (d): The enlarged UV-vis absorption spectra at the long wavelength region for MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films with and without the sec-butyl alcohol solvent washing step. 
Then, we investigated the role of the DMF solvent annealing step under an N2 atmosphere in facilitating the grain growth of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite. Fig. 4a shows the morphology dependence of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films on solvent annealing by SEM, where all films were prepared on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates with the same sec-butyl alcohol washing and soaking steps but with various annealing steps, which are thermal annealing plus DMF solvent annealing under an air atmosphere at 100 °C for 25 min, and only thermal annealing under an N2 atmosphere at 100 °C for 25 min, respectively. It is observed from Fig. 4a that whether DMF solvent annealing occurs under an air atmosphere or DMF-free annealing occurs under an N2 atmosphere it induces the formation of very small perovskite crystallites with grain sizes of about 340 nm and 357 nm, respectively. By comparing with that shown in Fig. 2c, it is observed that DMF solvent annealing under an N2 atmosphere is crucial for facilitating the growth of large grains of MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films, which is also further confirmed by the XRD patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively. Upon DMF solvent annealing under an N2 atmosphere, the intensity of the Bragg diffraction peaks measured for the MASn0.25Pb0.75 films increases significantly and their band-edge absorption is strengthened.

The annealing steps include thermal annealing plus DMF solvent annealing under an air atmosphere, and only thermal annealing under an N2 atmosphere. For comparison, those with the optimal annealing step, i.e. thermal annealing plus DMF solvent annealing under N2 atmosphere, are shown in (b)–(e) as well. Inset of (b) and (c): The enlarged Bragg diffraction peaks at 14 degree and the enlarged UV-vis absorption spectra at the long wavelength region for MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 films with different annealing steps. 
In the following, we further probe the effect of DMF solvent annealing on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MASn0.25Pb0.75I3/PCBM/Al were fabricated by three various annealing steps for comparison. Fig. 4d shows the typical J–V characteristics measured for different cells. The results of the cell parameters averaged from ten measurements are also listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It should be noted that as ascribed to the large crystal grain formation induced by the optimal annealing step (i.e. thermal annealing plus DMF solvent annealing under an N2 atmosphere), all parameters of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are improved. The performance of PSCs obtained by DMF solvent annealing in air is very poor with an average PCE of 0.37% due to the oxidation of Sn2+.29,34 The PSCs prepared by thermal annealing under a N2 environment show only mediocre photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 8.14%. The effect of DMF annealing on the cell performance can also be indicated by the change in the dark current of PSCs, shown in Fig. 4e. It should be noted that the dark current density under reverse bias from the PSC prepared by an optimal annealing step is smaller than that of other sample devices, suggesting that large crystal grain formation can reduce efficiently the leakage current because of the less trap states present in the perovskite film. The fewer trap states there are the smaller the electron–hole recombination loss, contributing to more effective carrier collection and increased JSC in the PSC obtained by the optimal annealing step, as reflected in Table S2 (ESI†). According to eqn (1),35 (1)where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, and J0 is the reverse dark current density at reverse bias. The lower the J0, and the higher the JSC, the higher the VOC. Therefore, the PSCs obtained by the optimal annealing step possess higher VOC values than other devices (see Table S2 of ESI†).
Next, we check the reproducibility of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs. The histograms of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE measured for 30 independent cells, fabricated using identical procedures, are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The cells thus made have a JSC of 21.61 ± 0.94 (mA cm2), VOC of 0.79 ± 0.02 (V), FF of 0.65 ± 0.04, and PCE of 11.01 ± 0.63%, indicating that the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films, formed by our proposed multi-step solvent-assisted one-step spin-coating process, have a very good reproducibility.
To evaluate the air-stability of the device performance, we measured the evolution of the J–V characteristics and the PCE of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs as a function of storage time under ambient conditions, the results are presented in Fig. S6 and Table S3 (ESI†). It is observed that the performance of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3-based PSCs degraded gradually with the increase in storage time. The MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 PSCs still yield a PCE of 8.35% after they were exposed to air for 15 h, which might be ascribed to the compact large crystal grains in the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite film preventing the encroachment of moisture and oxygen.
4. Conclusion
Promising and reproducible MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite films are fabricated using a commercially viable solution fabrication process. Using a one-step spin-coating process with sec-butyl alcohol solvent engineering combined with a DMF solvent annealing step under a N2 atmosphere, high-quality MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films, with densely packed and uniformly distributed large grains across the films, are obtained. The champion PSCs with an inverted planar heterojunction structure yield a promising PCE of 12.08% and an average PCE of 11.01%, measured under AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, showing excellent performance reproducibility, weak hysteresis in photocurrent–voltage and good air-stability. The improvement in the performance of the Sn–Pb binary PSCs is attributed to the highly homogeneous and perfect crystalline nature of the MASn0.25Pb0.75I3 perovskite films. This study opens a new avenue for developing high-efficiency Sn–Pb binary perovskite devices.
