, Accepted 26th July 2013First published on 29th July 2013AbstractIn this work, we investigate the multifaceted properties at the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/ZnO interface functionalized by a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of the fullerene derivative C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (C60-PTA), using a model sandwich structure which allows better mechanistic understanding in comparison to using a more complicated bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Results show that the C60-PTA modification induces fibril-like P3HT nanodomains at the interfaces which were not seen or reported before, yet the increase of work function on the modified ZnO surface is not pronounced. Besides, the quenching efficiency of the P3HT photoluminescence of the modified sample is nearly 7-fold higher than that of the unmodified one, leading to a more efficient exciton separation after the C60-PTA modification. Thus, we believe that the change in P3HT morphology at the interface might have contributed significantly to the substantially improved exciton separation efficiency observed, which was neglected in similar fullerene modified conjugated polymer/metal oxide systems previously. We further investigate the charge transport and recombination as well as the photovoltaic (PV) response in the C60-PTA modified BHJ sample based on vertical ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs). Results indicate that the mechanistic understanding underlying the model sandwich structure is also applicable in the buried BHJ interfaces. The present study provides a new insight into the origin of the boosted exciton separation in the conjugated polymer/metal oxide heterojunction modified by fullerene molecules, which might be useful for rationally designing three-dimensional organic–inorganic heterojunctions with enhanced splitting capability of photo-excited excitons from the aspect of interfacial morphologies.
1. Introduction
The incompatible conjugated polymer/metal oxide interface remains one of the critical obstacles to achieving high performance devices or systems in the applications of excitonic solar cells,1,2 photo(electro)catalysis3 and photosensitive transistors4 etc., where fast and thorough splitting for photo-generated excitons in the interfacial regions is required. For example, in hybrid solar cells (HSCs) the organic component provides a series of advantages such as solution processing, high absorption coefficient and the potential for realization of flexible devices and rapidly, easily scalable manufacturing, while the inorganic counterpart offers high charge mobility, chemical and mechanical stability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the conducting polymer/metal oxide based photovoltaic (PV) device is still far from the requirements for commercialization. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiencies of the solar cells based on the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/ZnO constitution in different hybrid forms5–8 are usually within the scope <1%; while a highest PCE of ∼2% was reported by Janssen et al.9 in 2009, which was not exceeded until today. Since the photo-exited charge carriers have to escape from the heterointerface and experience transport processes before being collected by respective electrodes, the totally different surfaces of polymer/metal oxide would definitely cause inefficient charge transfer and subsequent charge recombination, which hinders further improvement of the PCE of the hybrid PV cells. Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the essential factors affecting the issues of charge transfer and recombination at the metal oxide/polymer interface, and find relevant methods to enhance the device performance.
To this end, many efforts have been made to improve the charge coupling characteristics between metal oxides and conjugated polymers by using organic molecule functionalization of the heterointerfaces.10–16 Recently, fullerene or its derivatives with anchored groups were also reported17–19 to be carried out to modify the surfaces of ZnO, in order to ameliorate the poor electron communication between it and the conjugated polymer, which resulted in greatly enhanced PV response. For example, Chen et al.17 employed a C60 layer to modify the ZnO nanorod/polymer interface, obtaining improved device performance; by probing the carrier dynamics and surface properties of ZnO nanorods, they further contributed the PCE enhancement of the solar cells to the assisted exciton separation, passivation of the ZnO surface as well as the improved interfacial charge transfer. Vaynzof19 improved the performance of the P3HT/ZnO bilayer solar cells by using a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) to functionalize the interface; they pointed out that the used modifier induced an interfacial dipole moment, which caused enhanced exciton dissociation and reduced recombination loss.
While it was noted that C60 and its covalent derivatives as interface modifiers could greatly improve charge transfer properties, previous studies mainly concentrated on the electronic and electrical properties in the modified polymer/metal oxide systems, and there is not yet a systematic study about the influence of fullerene molecule modification on the multifaceted properties of the P3HT/ZnO interfaces. For instance, the P3HT morphology and crystalline properties were verified to have great impact on the mobility20 and lifetime21 of carriers, charge transport,22 electronic orbital levels of P3HT23 and light absorption.24 In fact, the aforementioned elements influenced by interfacial polymer geometry would affect the open-circuit voltage (Voc)25 and the short-circuit current density (Isc)21 of the HSCs. Besides, there were few reports concerning the charge transport and recombination in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) system based on fullerene modified conjugated polymer/metal oxide interfaces. Since the understanding of the fullerene modification at metal oxide/polymer interfaces is still rather poor, a more comprehensive study is called for to identify the causes of the success in such functionalized configurations at the nanoscale.
In this paper, we first discuss the complex interfacial issues by investigating the P3HT/ZnO interfaces modified by a new self-assembled C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (C60-PTA) molecule using a layered configuration. Such a model sandwich heterojunction allows us to probe in-depth the impact of C60-PTA modification on not only the microstructures of P3HT by affecting the chain alignment at the interfaces, but also on the electronic and charge transfer properties of the heterojunction. Then we investigate the charge transport and recombination in ordered BHJs, with the purpose of building correlations between two- and three-dimensional systems.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
P3HT (Mw = 50000, 95% regioregularity) was purchased from Reike Metals, Inc. and used without further purification. C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as received. Indium tin oxide (ITO, 15 Ohm/square, Wuhan Geo Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., China) conducting glasses were also commercially obtained. Other analytical grade chemicals were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China, and used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of ZnO thin films and nanorod arrays
Glass substrates or ITO glasses were cleaned by first scrubbing with detergent, rinsed by water, followed by sequential sonication in DI water, acetone and ethanol for 10 min. After that, the substrates were dried by a blower, and kept in an oven at 100 °C for 2 h. A sol–gel process was carried out to deposit ZnO thin films onto the substrates.26 Briefly, 0.4 M zinc acetate dihydrate in a mixed solution of 2-methoxyethanol and monoethanolamine was first spin-coated onto the substrates at 3000 rpm for 20 s, followed by a sequential heat treatment at 200 °C and 500 °C for 20 min and 1 h, respectively. The ZnO film thicknesses were adjusted by repeating the former steps for varied cycles. Vertical ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) were grown by immersing the seeded ITO substrates into unstirred aqueous solution of 0.025 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 0.025 M hexamethylenetetramine at 95 °C for different durations producing nanorods with desired lengths. The as-prepared ZnO NRAs were then rinsed by DI water for several times, before being transferred into an oven at 180 °C for about 1 h.
2.3 Fabrication of the layered and bulk heterojunction
5 mg C60-PTA was first dissolved in 100 ml tetrahydrofuran, and ultrasonically treated for 3 h before next-step use. Subsequently, the ZnO film or NRA samples were immersed into the solution for 30 min. Then the samples were removed from the solution and thoroughly rinsed by tetrahydrofuran to remove any excess unbound molecules, died by using a blower and left in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h to improve the bond connection. The P3HT was dissolved in chlorobenzene and continuously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Two P3HT solutions with different concentrations of 5 mg ml−1 and 30 mg ml−1 were prepared and spin-coated onto the bare (or modified) ZnO thin films and ZnO NRAs, respectively, to fabricate the layered and bulk heterojunction samples. After that, the as-prepared samples were annealed at 200 °C for 10 min, prior to be stored in a drying box overnight. Finally, 100 nm silver top electrodes were evaporated onto the BHJ samples at 10−6 Torr.
2.4 Characterization and measurements
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra and the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) were measured on a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO-570) and a photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog), respectively. Morphology of the samples was characterized by using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Veeco Nanoscope III a). The crystalline property of the P3HT was characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) (D/max 2400). The applied X-ray radiation source was Cu-Kα (40 kV, 100 mA), the theta angle was fixed at 1°, and the scanning speed was 2°/min at a step of 0.02°. Water contact angle (CA) was measured by using an optical contact angle meter system (OCA-20). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) experiments were carried out in an integrated ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system with multichamber (SPECS, Germany). XPS measurements were carried out with the Mg-Kα line (1253.6 eV, 20 mA emission current), while UPS measurements were performed by using the He I photon line (21.22 eV). The morphologies and cross-sections of the as-prepared ZnO NRAs were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-6390A, JEOL Inc., Japan) The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured by using the scratched samples of the bare or modified ZnO nanorods dispersed in 5 mg ml−1 P3HT solution of cholorobenzene. The fluorescence of P3HT was excited by femtosecond laser pulses centered at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and pulse width of 65 fs, due to two-photon absorption effect. The emitted spectra were measured using a commercial optical multi-channel analyzer (OMA) system with a 2 ns gate width. The TRPL spectra were recorded by varying the delay time between the triggering pulse of the OMA system and the exciting pulse. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using a Corrtest Electrochemical Workstation, all in dark, at varied positive bias, with a magnitude of the alternative signal of 10 mV and the frequency ranging from 105 to 100 Hz. Dark current–voltage (I–V) curves of the BHJ samples were recorded by using a Keithley SMU 2400 Source Measure unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in the wavelength between 300 and 800 nm using a QE/IPCE measurement system (Newport, USA).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 (a) schematically shows the molecular structures of the employed modifier C60-PTA and the conjugated polymer P3HT. It can be observed from Fig. 1 (b) that the bare and the C60-PTA modified ZnO NRAs are easily identifiable due to the color variation. To highlight such difference, ZnO NRAs as long as 2 μm are used as the scaffold for surface modification here.

To examine the microstructures of P3HT in the polymer/ZnO interfacial areas, we have fabricated layered samples on glass substrates with an ultrathin P3HT layer of 20 nm and the ZnO film thickness of 26 nm, and characterize them by AFM, UV-vis spectra and XRD. The ultrathin P3HT film is used in this study in order to probe the P3HT structure at the interface with ZnO. Fig. 2 show the AFM images of the morphology of the P3HT thin films atop the bare and modified ZnO/glass substrates, with both samples calcined at 200 °C for 10 min. It is surprising to observe from Fig. 2 (b) that there are many fibril-like domains in the modified sample, with the sizes ranging from several to several tens of nanometers; which are absent in the P3HT deposited on unmodified ZnO as shown in Fig. 2 (a). As shown in the top insets of Fig. 2, the contact angle (CA) of the bare ZnO substrate would increase from 19.02° to 74.82° after the deposition of the C60-PTA molecules. According to Young–Dupré equation,27 the work of adhesion between the substrate and the water should be greatly reduced upon the C60-PTA modification. Thus, the interfacial modification by fullerene molecules could be used to reduce the high surface energy of the ZnO and improve the compatibility between the inorganic substrate and the conjugated polymer. The conformational mobility of P3HT chains on top of the modified ZnO during drying or annealing would also be improved greatly, inducing ordered packing of the polymer chains and thus the appearance of the preferentially oriented P3HT fibril-like nano-domains.21,28–30 Our observation was also theoretically supported by the computer simulation results in the TiO2/4-mercaptopyridine/P3HT system,31 where the authors found that energy barrier for P3HT migration on the modified TiO2 surface was much smaller than that on the bare TiO2; because the calculated results showed that the electrostatic energy landscape was smoother and the local charges were smaller for the modified case.

The UV-vis absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 3 exhibit well-defined vibronic peaks at around 525, 550, 605 nm, characteristic of pure P3HT in solid state, for all the bare and modified P3HT/ZnO samples. From Fig. 3, it can be observed that the as-spun P3HT thin film on ZnO (P3HT-ZnO RT) already shows good crystalline property. However, after heat treatment at 200 °C the absorption of the unmodified sample (P3HT/ZnO 200 °C) shows a slight blue shift and the peak intensity at 605 nm has a visible decrease, which indicate that the annealing at present conditions would reduce the ordering of the polymer chain alignment at the interfaces. When C60-PTA is used to modify the interface (P3HT/C60-PTA/ZnO RT), the absorption peak intensity at 605 nm would have some increase as compared to that of the unmodified samples. With further annealing the sample (P3HT/C60-PTA/ZnO 200 °C), the peak intensity would continue to increase as compared to the as-prepared one, which is very different from the phenomenon in the unmodified configurations. This UV-vis spectroscopy results are also well consistent with the discussions in the last paragraph about the AFM experiments. The modification already has impact on the flow and crystalline characteristics of the P3HT chains during the drying process at the room temperature. However, this influence during high-temperature annealing is much more pronounced, which is reflected in the bigger difference of the gaps of peak intensity at 605 nm. Thus, from Fig. 3 it verifies that fullerene molecule modification would cause the easy mobilization of P3HT chains and re-arrangement to ordered tiny areas. In a previous report,13 Tai et al. also observed the ordering change of polymer chains at the TiO2/P3HT interfaces upon a co-modification of the ruthenium dye and 3-phenylpropionic acid by UV-vis spectroscopy. Here, we found that the annealing process could enlarge this variation of P3HT chain alignment at the heterointerfaces as well, which could enrich our understanding about the origin of the ordered areas as discussed in the AFM part. Besides, the annealing at 200 °C will be compatible with that in our BHJ sample processing, which will allow us to better know the influence of modification in the three-dimensional configuration.

Furthermore, the P3HT chain alignment in the bare and modified samples is directly examined by XRD in a thin-film mode. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen that a peak at 2theta = 5.4° assigned to the P3HT (100) reflections normal to substrates appears for both samples, indicating that an edge-on configuration of the chain ordering exists at present conditions.32 However, the peak intensity shows obvious enhancement for the modified sample as compared to that for the pristine one, proving that C60-PTA can significantly improve the P3HT chain alignment in the edge-on direction. Together with the AFM observation it also reveals the great impact of the self-assembled C60-PTA molecules on the morphology and chain alignment of the upper interfacial P3HT films. Thus, the C60-PTA functionalization can obviously induce a better P3HT chain ordering at the interfaces for more favorable charge transport. It should be mentioned here that the reason we chose the annealing conditions at 200 °C for 10 min is due to the fact that P3HT could completely fill into small nanochannels under present conditions,33,34 and we would thus treat the BHJ samples in the same way thereafter. Our finding based on a series of characterization techniques undoubtedly provide solid evidences that the C60-PTA molecule have significant impact on the ordered packing behavior of conjugate polymers at the organic/inorganic interfaces. The intermolecular interaction between C60-PTA and the atop P3HT might also play an important role in the chain orientation of P3HT; for example, the π–π* intermolecular interaction between the modifier with a conjugated structure and the conjugated polymer was reported to influence the self-assembly process during the film solidification.35 Interestingly, Sun et al.35 found crystalline property of P3HT could also be improved by introducing TiO2 nanorods with precisely tailored shapes, which provides a guidance for us to further optimize the crystallinity of P3HT on top of the C60-PTA modified ZnO substrate.

XPS and UPS measurements were performed based on the 26 nm ZnO/ITO substrate. Fig. 5 (a) shows the Zn2p peaks and C1s peak (inset) of the XPS spectra of the bare and C60-PTA modified ZnO films on ITO substrates. Although the C1s signals cannot be distinguished for both samples as shown in the inset of Fig. 5 (a), the attenuation of the Zn2p signals (peak binding energies centered at 1022 eV for Zn 2p3/2 and 1045 eV for Zn 2p1/2) indicates that a thin layer of C60-PTA molecules forms on top of the ZnO films. Considering that the escape depth of ZnO in the XPS measurements was reported between 3 and 10 nm,36 the thickness of the C60-PTA layer can be estimated to be in a range of 0.6–2 nm in terms of intensity reduction of the Zn2p signals. Hence, the aforementioned results also support that a C60-PTA SAM have been obtained at present conditions, because the C60 bucky ball has a diameter of about 1 nm.37 From the UPS results as shown in Fig. 5 (b), it can be seen that the work function of the ZnO/ITO substrate increases slightly from 3.60 eV to 3.75 eV upon C60-PTA SAM deposition, that is, a shift of about 0.15 eV. Such phenomenon related to work function change was also observed in the PCBA-modified ZnO system,19 in which however a more pronounced increase of work function as high as 0.5 eV was reported. We believe that the smaller variation of work function here is also due to ground electron transfer from the ZnO to the C60 ball, leading to formation of interfacial dipole pointing away from ZnO.

The photo-generated charge transfer properties at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces are examined by the steady-state PL as shown in Fig. 5 (c). The steady-state PL experiments (excited at 500 nm) are carried out by using layered samples based on a structure of 40 nm P3HT/50 nm ZnO/glass. It can be seen from Fig. 5 (c) that the PL of the pristine P3HT on a glass substrate is approximately in the range of 625–770 nm, with two peaks centered at 655 nm and 725 nm. After introduction of the acceptor materials of ZnO or C60-PTA modified ZnO, the P3HT PL shows the quenching behavior, while the PL peak positions remain unchanged. Through integration of the areas below the normalized PL spectra, the quenching efficiency of each sample can be calculated as follows: 0.244 (P3HT/C60-PTA/ZnO) and 0.034 (P3HT/ZnO). On the hypothesis that only radiative recombination happens (i.e., every photogenerated exciton recombines with releasing a photon) and the exciton diffusion length is 10 nm,38 the value of 0.244 for the P3HT/C60-PTA/ZnO sample means a nearly 100% PL quenching efficiency or exciton separation efficiency within the exciton diffusion length range. This means that, as schematically shown in Fig. 5 (d), in the 10-nm region close to C60-PTA/ZnO (Area II) almost every exciton has a chance to be splitted, whereas those excitons in the area further away from the interface (Area I) experience the luminescence process due to recombination. However, on the unmodified ZnO, only a small portion of photo-induced excitons within the 10 nm region near the P3HT/ZnO interface can be dissociated, which is evidenced by the low PL quenching efficiency of 0.034.
Such differentiation of exciton separation efficiency in the bare and modified P3HT/ZnO layered configurations might be partially caused by the interfacial dipole as claimed by Vaynzof.18 Electrons in the ground state spontaneously transfer from ZnO to C60 ball due to the great electron-accepting capability of fullerene, resulting in a depletion zone, i.e., band bending in the ZnO subsurface. Thus, the electric field induced by interfacial dipole might contribute to the enhanced charge transfer at the modified P3HT/ZnO interface. However, we believe that, because of the relative small increase of work function (0.15 eV) in this study as shown in Fig. 5 (b), the formation of the interfacial dipole cannot account for the sharp enhancement of exciton separation as shown in Fig. 5 (c–d); while in the previous report19 the authors observed a great increase of work function as high as 0.50 eV in a PCBA modified P3HT/ZnO configuration, and thus they completely attribute the great improvement of the PV performance to the formed interfacial dipole. In fact, as seen in Fig. 2, C60-PTA modification has induced significant changes of polymer morphology at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces, that is, formation of nanofibrils comprising of more ordered chains of polymer molecules. These domains of aligned P3HT chains might prolong the lifetime and improve the mobility for the separated charge carriers within the 10-nm interfacial region (Area II) as shown in Fig. 5 (d), which would reduce the recombination and thus greatly enhance the exciton separation efficiency at the P3HT/ZnO interface. Therefore, in addition to the effect of interfacial dipole, the favorable P3HT morphology on the modified ZnO should have played a more significant role in reducing the change recombination due to better charge transport characteristics of P3HT layer near the interface. We believe this discussion is highly significant because all previous reports on fullerene molecule modified metal oxide/conjugated polymer attribute the increase in charge separation efficiency solely to electronic property change.
To investigate the charge transport and recombination underneath the buried BHJ structure, ZnO NRAs with a diameter of about 80 nm and a height of 245 nm were fabricated on ITO as shown in Fig. 6. The normalized TRPL experimental results as shown in Fig. 7 provide further insight into the BHJ, showing the occurrence of faster interface charge transfer for the C60-PTA modified ZnO nanorods/P3HT configuration; because it can be observed that the P3HT PL decays more quickly for the modified sample than that for the bare one (4–10 ns).

 Fig. 7  Normalized TRPL experimental results of the bare and modified ZnO nanorods dispersed in 5 mg ml−1 P3HT solution of cholorobenzene (the range between 4–10 ns shows the decay process). 
For electrical measurements, a dense ZnO compact film with a thickness of 70 nm is used as the hole-blocking layer, while a P3HT overlayer with a thickness of 260 nm is employed as the electron-blocking layer. The recombination property of the P3HT/ZnO NRAs based BHJ samples is further investigated by the EIS and dark I–V measurements. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) show the EIS Nyquist spectra (at a bias from 0 to 0.3 V) of the bare and modified BHJ samples, respectively. By using a proper equivalent circuit,39 several parameters related to the charge transport and recombination across the buried P3HT/ZnO interface can be fitted, including the interface capacitance (C), recombination resistance (R) and recombination time constant (τ). Among the fitted parameters, the recombination time constant can be obtained by using the following equation: 
τ = 1/2πωmax
(1)where ωmax represents the frequency at the top of the semicircle of the Nyquist spectra as shown in Fig. 8 (a,b). Fig. 8 (c–e) shows the correlation between the extracted parameters (C, R, and τ) and the applied bias. First, it can be observed from Fig. 8 (c) that the capacitance at the nanostructured interfaces between ZnO NRAs and P3HT has a small decrease (about 10%) upon C60-PTA SAM modification, implying that less interfacial charge accumulation occurs for the modified sample. Besides, as seen in Fig. 8 (d) the recombination resistance increase by between 30% and 70% (depending on varied bias) for the modified sample as compared to that for the unmodified one, indicating that the employed C60-PTA SAM can effectively retard back recombination at the P3HT/ZnO NRAs interfaces. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8 (e) the derived recombination time constant is significantly longer in the modified system, which gives an indirect proof on role of the used C60-PTA SAM. It is currently difficult for us to directly observe the transient charge transport and recombination at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces, because the magnitude of the time resolution of this process was reported very small (in the picosecond regime).20 However, the EIS results can still give useful information on the charge transfer process at the interfaces.

Fig. 8 (f) shows the semi-logarithmic plots of the I–V characteristics of the model BHJ sample under dark conditions. The dark saturation current density (I0) can be obtained by fitting the low and medium-bias part between 0.2 and 0.4 V of the dark I–V curves, in terms of the diode equation depicted as:40 
Id = I0(eqV/kT − 1)
(2)where Id is the dark current density of the sample as a function of the applied bias V. The obtained I0 values of the bare and modified BHJ samples are 3.48 × 10−3 Acm−2 and 6.02 × 10−4 Acm−2, respectively. The modified system has a one order of magnitude low dark saturation current. On one hand, the net current density (I) of a real PV device under illumination is affected by the dark saturation current density in a relation as follow: 
I = Isc − Id
(3)
Hence, it is evident that decreasing I0 could improve the photogenerated current density. On the other hand, the Voc of a PV device can also be influenced by the I0 in a way as below: 
Voc = kT/q ln(Isc/I0 + 1)
(4)
Thus, the C60-PTA modification can effectively suppress the recombination and thus improve the exciton separation at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces, and have potential applicable in hybrid BHJ solar cells based on conjugated polymer/metal oxide. Furthermore, the PV responses of the model BHJ samples are evaluated by measuring the EQE curves as shown in Fig. 9. A significant increase of EQE is observed as shown in Fig. 9 from a maximum value of 2% at a wavelength of 510 nm for the unmodified sample to 9% for the C60-PTA modified one. Herein, the outstanding performance enhancement of the nanostructured sample is mainly attributed to the boosted exciton separation at the ZnO/P3HT interface upon C60-PTA SAM modification and thus the reduced back recombination, based on the above investigations of the interface issues. However, as we discussed the enhanced exciton separation and retarded back recombination at the C60-PTA modified P3HT/ZnO interfaces might be greatly induced by the morphology and crystalline change of the conjugated polymer in the interfacial areas, since we have proved that the work function of the employed ZnO material only has a very small shift after modification as shown in Fig. 5 (b), indicating that the energy barrier for electron back recombination changes in a small range. Wu et al.41 recently found that the PV device performance could be enhanced as high as two times by using CdS to modify the P3HT/ZnO nanofiber interfaces, which was attributed to the cascade energy band positions facilitating charge transfer as well as the reduced recombination centers on the ZnO surface. In our study, the aforementioned factor related to band positions might also have some influence on the exciton separation; but this impact was not yet shown as the dominant one based on our current experiments. Besides, we could eliminate the factor of covering the recombination centers on the ZnO surface after C60-PTA deposition, because we found there was not a decrease of the PL intensity at the ZnO defect emission (not shown here). As compared with the EQE values of other BHJ PV cells based on conjugated polymer/metal oxide as shown in Table 1, our model BHJ sample only exhibits a modest efficiency (9% at 510 nm), which needs to be improved in the future work. However, it is already demonstrated here that the PV response of our BHJ sample indeed has a remarkable enhancement due to the C60-PTA modification.

4. Conclusion
We have systematically studied the effects of C60-PTA SAM modification on the multiplex properties at the P3HT/ZnO interfaces by using a model layered heterojunction structure. We have discovered that the great enhancement of exciton separation efficiency at the C60-PTA modified P3HT/ZnO interfaces might be significantly induced by the formation of interfacial P3HT nanofibril domains comprising of ordered polymer chains, which would improve charge transfer and reduce recombination. The charge transport and recombination as well as the PV response of the BHJ samples are further investigated, verifying that the mechanistic understanding obtained from the sandwich configuration can be implemented into the BHJ system. Therefore, fullerene molecule functionalization of the organic-inorganic heterointerfaces should be a promising route to be applicable in solar cells, photo(electro)catalysts and transistors etc.
