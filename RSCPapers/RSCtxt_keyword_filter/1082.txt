MoO3 exhibits a suitable work function, adjustable electronic structure, favorable ohmic contact with organic materials, remarkable stability in the presence of water and oxygen, and excellent solution processing properties, making it an ideal anode buffer layer (ABL) for OPVs. This review analyzes the photoelectric characteristics of MoO3 based on the crystalline structure and its fundamentals as an ABL in OPVs. To simplify the fabrication procedure, AHM, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3 powder are used as precursors for solution processing MoO3 buffer layers, and the attempts are still ongoing. Strategies of composite/hybrid formation, modification and doping are utilized to optimize the MoO3 ABL to obtain more efficient and stable OPVs. Combining the optical and electronic properties of MoO3, diverse applications are introduced in inverted, semi-transparent devices and tandem architectures, showing the wide applicability of MoO3 in OPVs. This review draws the outline of the relationships between the composition, structure and processing method of MoO3 and device performance, and further studies to fully understand it at a deeper level are highly needed, which is beneficial to improve the performance of OPVs and the research for solar cells with a similar structure, such as perovskite solar cells.Yongshuai GongYongshuai Gong received his bachelor's degree from the College of Materials Science and Engineering of the Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2015.

1. Introduction
OPV cells have the advantages of low cost, easy processing, and environmental friendliness. Since the first double-layer OPV cell reported by Dr C. W. Tang in 1986,1 great progress has been made after decades investigating them. Especially in the past 10 years, the development of new types of donor and acceptor materials and further understanding of the mechanism, together with the advancement of device engineering, have greatly promoted the research of OPVs.2–12 At present, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached an extremely remarkable level, with 17.3% for tandem OPVs13,14 and over 16% for ternary devices and even some single-cell systems,15–19 making their commercialization possible.
Limited by the lifetime and diffusion length of photo-excitons,20 a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is currently the most efficient structure in OPV cells.21 In general, devices with inverted architectures are more stable than those with conventional architectures, making the inverted structure an important choice for commercialization.8 In order to make full use of the energy of sunlight with different wavelengths, devices with ternary or tandem architecture OPV cells have also been developed.22 At the same time, due to the characteristics of organic materials, it is possible to produce semi-transparent or flexible devices, which is the most unique feature of OPV cells compared to other types of solar cells, so they can have broad application prospects in specific fields.23,24 All the above mentioned technologies, including inverted devices, ternary devices, tandem devices, semi-transparent devices and flexible devices, are the fields researchers investigating the most.
Interface engineering of OPV cells plays an important role in the improvement of the device performance.25,26 Firstly, by selecting an appropriate interface material, the resistance of the device can be reduced, and light harvesting ability and carrier transport capability can be improved, thereby improving PCEs. Secondly, appropriate interface materials can isolate the active layer from water, oxygen and other disadvantagous components of the external environment, thereby greatly improving the stability of the device. Finally, appropriate interface materials need to meet the requirements of commercialization of OPVs to simplify processing technology, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost.
MoO3 is one of the most widely used ABL materials in OPV cells. As a typical high work function metal oxide, MoO3 and some non-stoichiometric derivatives, namely MoOX (X = 2–3) have an adjustable electronic structure and photoelectric properties and can also be widely used in the fields of energy storage and conversion,27–29 gas sensing,30,31 catalysis,32–34 transistors,35 various solar cells,36–47etc..48,49 Because of the good matching of MoOX with organic optoelectronic materials, it was first used in organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices as a hole injecting layer (HIL) material,50–53 and then introduced into OPV cells as an anode buffer layer material,54 including the areas that need special requirements such as tandem OPVs and transparent and flexible OPVs,23,55–58 making MoO3 a common choice as the ABL in the research of new materials and mechanisms for OPV cells.48,49
In view of the wide application of MoO3 in OPV cells, there is no literature reviewing this theme specifically. Therefore, we hope to combine the fundamentals, newly developed solution processing methods and optimization strategies of MoO3 in OPVs, outline the relationships between the composition, structure, processing methods and device performances (Fig. 1), provide support for a new breakthrough in solving the problem of OPV interface materials and facilitate the commercialization procedure of OPVs. In this review, we first analyze the photoelectric properties of MoO3 and its application mechanism in OPVs, and then mainly introduce the main solution processing methods and optimization strategies of MoO3 ABLs, and typical applications and optimizing strategies in semi-transparent devices, tandem devices, inverted devices and other aspects are also summarized. Finally, through a brief discussion, we try to figure out the current problems and future research directions.

2. Photoelectric properties of MoO3 and its application fundamentals in OPV cells
2.1 Electronic structure and application mechanism of MoO3
MoO3 has three common crystal phases, namely the thermodynamically stable orthogonal α-phase (α-MoO3, space group Pbmn),59 the metastable monoclinic β-phase (space group P21/n), and the hexagonal h-phase (space group P63/m).60 α-MoO3 is the most commonly used one, and its crystal structure is very special. A [MoO6] deformed regular octahedron is connected in a plane to form a sub-layer and two sub-layers are then stacked in the [001] direction to form a crystal of MoO3, and the two sub-layers were only connected by van der Waals force.61
A suitable work function (WF, 6.9 eV)62 and conductivity (about 1.2 × 10−7 S m−1)63 are the most important bases for using MoO3 in OPV cells. Yuzheng Guo et al.64 revealed the features of the work function by calculation. In α-MoO3, three different states of O atoms are connected to 1, 2, or 3 Mo atoms, respectively, that is, O1, O2, and O3, where O1 is located on the outermost side of the crystal structure (Fig. 2). This structure makes the internal potential lower. Moreover, due to the formation of dipoles between the two layers of MoO3, a large potential step is formed between the O1 sites and MoO2 planes, which leads to a higher work function of MoO3. O vacancies have a close relationship with the high conductivity of MoO3. It is found that61 the amount of O vacancies varies with different positions, because the formation energies are different in different positions, but the neutral formation energies are large at all vacancy positions in oxygen-poor conditions, the resulted oxygen vacancies make it easier to display a metal-like conductivity. MoO3 was originally thought to be a p-type doped structure material, but an in-depth study revealed that the formation of O vacancies makes MoO3 an n-type doped metal oxide based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.65 Due to the complex electronic properties and n-type doping of MoOX, it can be used in devices with various electron donor materials.66 Its conduction band (CB) position (2.3 eV) is higher than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of most acceptor materials, so MoO3 can effectively shield electrons and excitons, and people can use it as an ABL in inverted devices to realize a higher fill factor (FF).67 For conventional devices, it can improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices and optimize the surface morphology as well.54,68 These early studies have demonstrated the superior performance and potential application of MoO3 as an ABL in OPVs, and people can adjust the electronic structure to achieve better performance (Table 1).

As a buffer layer, the contact of MoO3 with other components in OPVs is an important factor affecting the device efficiency. Mark T. Greiner69 and Lothar Ley70 theoretically demonstrated that MoO3 can effectively improve charge transport in OPV cells, and also revealed the existence of an energy level alignment mechanism between metal oxides and organic molecules. After thermal evaporation of MoO3 on the active layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), it can be found that MoO3 infiltrates into the bulk heterojunction and forms a dipole with the organic components (Fig. 3a). When MoO3 had a thickness of about 3 nm, the strength of the dipole reached a maximum of 2.2 eV, making the electronic structure of MoO3 change to facilitate the transfer of charge (Fig. 3b). Of course, the optimum thickness of MoO3 will vary depending on the used active layer.96 Moisture is often present under the working conditions of solar cells. When the MoO3/polymer interface is exposed to a high moisture content, water molecules can be attracted to the interface by diffusion, but the water molecules have opposite dipoles versus the MoO3/polymer interface, which will reduce the charge transfer across the MoO3/polymer and affect the charge transport across the interface, and this mechanism explained the necessity to control the content of moisture in the environment during the fabrication of OPV cells.97 At the interface between metal and MoO3, Mo6+ will be partially reduced, thereby reducing the work function of the MoO3 film (Fig. 3c and d). Therefore, when selecting different metal electrodes, it is necessary to change the thickness of the MoO3 film according to the nature of the active layer and the selected metal electrode, so that MoO3 can demonstrate the best electronic state.98

2.2 The influencing factor of MoO3 as an ABL in OPVs
Apart from the above-mentioned moisture, active layer and metal electrode, the performances of MoO3 in OPV cells are affected by many other aspects such as the device structure, processing conditions, and working environment (Fig. 4). Different from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is the most commonly used ABL on indium tin oxide (ITO), MoO3 was mainly used in inverted architecture devices on the top of the active layer at an early stage. P. Morvillo and co-workers found that in poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl]:[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PBDTTT-C:P70CBM) based cells, denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C:PC70BM/Ca/Al and ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag, the inverted architecture showed better performance in terms of current output, because of more photon absorption in the blend film of the inverted architecture. And the inverted structure had higher values for the interface trap time constant and the density of interface states, both conducive to maintaining the effectiveness of charge collection.99
 Fig. 4  Summary of the influencing factor of MoO3 as an ABL in OPV cells. 
When MoO3 is used as a hole transport layer (HTL), there are certain requirements for the processing conditions like the thickness, annealing method, and synthesis method of the MoO3 film. In an inverted device with TiOX as the electron transport layer (ETL), MoO3/Ag as the anode, and P3HT:PCBM as the active layer, the thickness of MoO3 can be 1–15 nm, and the solvent annealing method is more favorable for the improvement of device performance.100 When MoOX is processed by the solution method as the HTL, higher annealing temperature may cause PCBM aggregation near MoOX, which leads to the generation of an S-type current density–voltage (J–V) curve, and thus particular attention is required to be paid to the choice of materials and preparation processes when preparing BHJ OPV cells.101
It is an important interface optimizing method to incorporate nanoparticles (NPs) into the MoO3 buffer layer to enhance the performance of OPV cells by using their surface plasmon effect (Fig. 5).102–110 The most commonly used metal nanoparticles are Au and Ag. Wang et al.111 used AgAl instead of Ag to generate surface plasmon resonance effects, and the formation of AlOX inhibited the diffusion of Ag atoms into the MoO3 layer, thereby improving the efficiency and stability of the device. Similarly, it is also applicable in small molecular organic solar cells (OSCs). For example, in 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane:C70 (TAPC:C70) small-molecule BHJ OPVs, Ag NPs are thermally evaporated on MoO3 as the ABL, and MoO3 can avoid the exciton quenching caused by Ag NPs, while Ag NPs increase the conductivity of the film, benefiting from the enhanced photon absorption caused by the surface plasmon effect, and short circuit current density (JSC) and FF are improved, and great improvements in device efficiency can be achieved.112
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the light trapping schemes for solar cells using surface plasmons: front, embedded and rear cases. 
To a certain degree, temperature and light conditions will affect the efficiency of OPV cells, and the use of MoO3 can play a positive role in maintaining device efficiency. Yongju Park et al.113 compared PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 ABLs of OPVs under different temperature and light conditions and found that MoO3 can maintain more stable performance. In planar heterojunction (PHJ) cells of small molecule boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)-C60, because of the formation of a Schottky junction at the MoOX–SubPc interface, it can have a higher VOC at lower temperature than the device without the MoOX layer.114 These characteristics make MoO3 have obvious advantages in application. However, in some systems, we also need to pay special attention to the interaction between MoO3 and the active layer. For example, in an organic cyanine dye (1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-ylidene)-propenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indolium hexafluorophosphate, Cy3-P) donor/C60 acceptor heterojunction architecture, a photochromic reaction occurs when the contact between MoO3 and the active layer is under illumination. Mo6+ will be partially reduced, and the formation of Mo5+ will adversely affect the device behaviour.115
2.3 The effect of MoO3 on the stability of OPV cells
Stability is one of the most important reasons for using MoO3 as the ABL because it can offer a more stable interface between MoO3 and the active layer, lower activation energy and more stable carrier recombination mechanism.113 When using MoO3, no matter how you make it, by thermal evaporation,116,117 or a solution method,76,118,119 or just directly adding NPs into commonly used PEDOT:PSS,120 improved stability could be achieved.
Analysing the degradation mechanism helps us to develop wise strategies to increase the stability of OPV cells. The degradation mechanism of OPV cells depends heavily on the materials, structures, processing methods, environmental conditions and so on.25 It is believed that, in OPV cells with MoO3 as the ABL, the change of the interface between MoO3 and the active layer or metal is one of the main causes of degradation.76,121 Comparing the life time of OPV cells with PEDOT:PSS or MoO3 as the ABL, the latter can keep a comparatively higher PCE over a longer period.122 Because MoO3 is inert and noncorrosive by nature, it can prevent the influences of moisture and oxygen,123 and the deterioration of MoO3, which mainly reflected in the oxidation state and WF, is the main factor for reduced PCEs. However, the corrosive PEDOT:PSS will affect the ITO electrode and cannot prevent the influences of moisture and oxygen, so the PCEs decrease faster. The interaction between MoO3 and the metal electrode is also an important factor responsible for the device degradation.124 In ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag/Al cells, the diffusion of Al during aging formed intermetallic compounds with Ag and reduced MoO3, resulted in the decrease of the reflectivity of the anode and the JSC value, so that the PCEs decreased by 50% in the first 100 h of aging.
Operating temperature also affects the device stability.125 Comparing the degradation phenomenon of PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 as HTLs at different temperatures, it is found that, unlike PEDOT:PSS cells, whose PCEs decrease gradually from the beginning of heating, MoO3 cells' PCEs rapidly decrease at the beginning of heating, and then remain relatively stable. The reason for the decline is that the diffusion phenomenon at high temperatures causes a rapid drop in the FF value.
S. Y. Chiam and coworkers126 explored the mechanisms of how MoO3 enhanced the efficiency and stability of OPV cells, they found a Mo–Mo dimer with +4 valence Mo in the MoO3 film treated by vacuum annealing. The new formed σ bonds were more stable, so the devices can keep stable under exposure to air or after plasma treatment reoxidation (Fig. 6). These defects formed on the surface of the MoO3 film can facilitate the transport of holes and improve the device performance.

The second and third rows show the generation of defects by sputtering and annealing respectively. The overlays in the valence plot of the sputtered and annealed samples show the valence band after atomic oxygen plasma treatment. Their corresponding Mo 3d is also shown to the right of the valence plot as indicated.126 Reproduced from ref. 126 with permission from Elsevier. 
3. Solution processed MoO3 as an ABL in OPV cells
The development of solution-processable interface materials can simplify the fabrication process of OPV cells,127 thereby reducing the production cost and facilitating the manufacture of large-area modules, and thus has become a research hotspot. In terms of the electron transport layer (ETL), solution processed TiOX,128 ZnO,129,130 polymers,131–138 small molecules139–143etc. have been extremely successfully used in OPV cells.144 As for the ABL, since the acidity of PEDOT:PSS is bad for realizing more stable and higher efficient OPVs, alternative materials have been developed, such as solution processed conjugated polymers,127,145 small molecules146 and various metal oxides or sulfides: NiO,147 RuO2,95 MoSX,89,148 VOX,84,149–151 WO3,94 CrOX,92 CuOX,152–154 ReOX,90etc. In general, MoO3 as the ABL in OPV cells is prepared by thermal evaporation, so it is quite attractive to develop solution-based technology to simplify the processing.
At present, the fabrication of MoO3 ABLs by the solution processing method is still mainly used in conventional architectures. The currently developed solution processing methods, as we summarized in this section, always produce water during processing or require a relatively high temperature, or plasma treatment etc., which is too drastic, and thus can adversely affect the efficiency and stability of the devices when applied on the active layer. This is a problem that people are trying to solve. Here in this section, we mainly summarize the methods of processing MoO3 ABLs with different precursors, the main performances of which are listed in Table 2, and hope to help develop a more convenient and greener solution processing method for MoO3 ABLs.

3.1 Ammonium heptamolybdate precursor
Recently, Hou Jianhui's group obtained a stable MoOX buffer layer by using an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM, also denoted as NMo in the reference) as the precursor, which was insensitive to thickness and easy to process. This is mainly due to the partial reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+ by the addition of vitamin C (VC, the obtained product denoted as H:V–Mo, while pristine MoOX as H–Mo)63 or ethylene glycol (EG, the obtained product denoted as EG:Mo),72 thereby improving the conductivity of the interface layer. The results make it possible for fabricating large-area OPV cells by printing (Fig. 7) and show the possible prospects of processing MoO3 ABLs with the AHM precursor.

In XPS spectra, the circles are experimental spectra, the solid gray lines are the fitting spectra, and the solid orange and solid purple lines are the decomposed Mo (VI) and Mo(V) spectra, respectively. All the films were spin-coated and annealed at 200 °C for 20 min. For EPR measurements, H–Mo and H:V–Mo powders were used, which were scraped off from their films.

As far as we know, Liu et al.77 first used AHM as the precursor to prepare a MoOX film by the solution method, which was used to replace PEDOT:PSS and thermal-evaporated MoO3 as OPV ABLs, and obtained equivalent device performance. Similar to thermally evaporated MoO3, solution processed MoO3 is also affected by the environmental conditions, such as air, light and water, among which water can destroy the link between MoO3 particles during the process of dehydration, or separate them from the ITO surface, or reduce conductivity, and thus lower the PCEs, making it the most unfavorable factor.155 Packaged devices with optimized pH and annealing temperature have an improved lifetime, which is an important attempt for the commercialization of OPVs.76
Various methods have been used to optimize the preparation and processing technology, and further understand how MoO3 works in OPVs. Based on Liu's method, Wong et al.75 added 10% isopropanol to water, optimized pH and concentration of the solution, and annealed under nitrogen protection to obtain MoOX with some Mo5+ or Mo4+ (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b and c show the differences in energy level structures and resulting absorption spectra, and thus superior device performance can be realized through the optimized electron transfer (Fig. 8d), which indicated that the presence of a certain number of oxygen vacancies is advantageous for improving the performance of OPVs. Using a MoOX film processed by further optimizing the ratio of isopropanol to water and the annealing conditions, Liu et al. found that thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):PC71BM cells with MoOX as the hole extraction layer (HEL) showed superior performance, especially under a low light illumination intensity, and the carrier transport and collection mechanism of MoOX/ITO anode was bimolecular recombination under open circuit conditions and weak bimolecular recombination under short circuit conditions.73 This group applied this method to devices with poly[4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2(2′-ethyl-hexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C-T):PC71BM as the active layer, and better light stability was obtained because of the energy level match of MoOX and the donor material.161

The addition of other ingredients to the solution also optimizes the preparation process. For example, adding a small amount of acetylacetone (AcAc), nitric acid and 0.5% PEDOT:PSS to 0.01 M AHM solution, the annealing temperature for MoOX film can be reduced from 250 °C to 150 °C, and the PCEs of the devices were also greatly improved.157 Qiu et al.156 added a small amount of H2O2 as an additive to react with the polymolybdate ion to form a peroxidized derivative. The film's WF reached 5.62 eV, which was applied to different systems to improve the PCEs. A small amount of PEDOT:PSS was added to the heated and diluted precursor solution, applied P3HT:indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as active layer to fabricate FTO/s-MoO3/P3HT:ICBA/LiF/Al cells, in which the MoO3 films were treated by UV annealing, achieving 5.40% PCEs and better stability, due to the absence of low valence Mo in MoO3 films after UV annealing.160 Yi et al.171 developed a polymer-assisted deposition (PAD) to prepare a MoOX ABL.
They added a mixed solution of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the AHM solution as a precursor solution, and a MoOX film was obtained after heating in air at 500 °C for 10 min, which has good transparency and better stability than PEDOT:PSS. Li et al.172 added a small amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution and adjusted the pH to about 3 with hydrochloric acid to obtain a CTAB-modified MoO3 precursor solution, spin-coated in air, and annealed in a glove box, and they achieved PCEs of 5.80 ± 0.13% in P3HT:ICBA cells and 8.34 ± 0.13% in PTB7:PC71BM cells.
Besides the above-mentioned methods, by changing the solvent or adding some ingredients to simplify processing and improve PCEs, other efforts were also made to reach the goals. Wang et al.78 directly prepared a MoO3 ABL by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) instead of water as a solvent to reduce the impact on the active layer, and they can also get MoO3 films after annealing at 170 °C for 30 min in air. Wan Jae Dong et al.74 used a laser-assisted method to treat AHM solution to obtain a hydrogenated molybdenum oxide HyMoO3−X film (Fig. 9). By controlling the energy of the KrF laser (λ = 248 nm), the work function and the electron mobility of HyMoO3−X reached the optimum state at 240 mJ cm−2, so that the performances of PTB7:PCBM cells were optimized. Since the laser processing time is only 30 ns, it saves a lot of time compared to the thermal evaporation method.

3.2 MoO3 powder precursor
In the early stage, another effective solution processing method for preparing MoO3 films is to treat MoO3 powder by certain methods and then spin coat them to form a film.
As we know, moisture is unfavorable for OPVs, so the researchers disperse or dissolve MoO3 powder in an organic solvent before use. Jens Meyer et al.71 dispersed crystalline MoO3 in xylene, using 1 wt% unknown block copolymer as a stabilizer, and the spin coated film was treated with O2 plasma to remove the dispersant. The comparison of sMoO3 treated at different temperatures and eMoO3 showed that some changes had taken place in the energy level structure, which proved the nature of n-type doping caused by oxygen vacancies in MoO3 (Fig. 10), indicating the possibility to apply them in organic electronic devices. Li et al.79 dissolved MoO3 in a solvent of ethylene glycol and isopropanol with a volume ratio of 1:9, and then a small amount of 30% H2O2 was added to the precursor solution to fabricate HTLs for P3HT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM cells. The PCEs and stability were both increased due to topography optimization (Fig. 11), a higher rectification ratio, and lower leakage current brought about by the optimized HTL. Using isopropanol as the single solvent to dissolve MoO3 to a concentration of 1 mg ml−1, followed by air plasma treatment to modify the ABL, inverted cells can be manufactured by the solution method. It is found that the pressure of the chamber, treatment intensity and time spent during plasma treatment have enormous influences on the processing results.166

Certainly, MoO3 powder can also been treated in water. For example, Claudio Girotto et al.173 dissolved MoO3 in an excess of 30% H2O2, and converted it to MoO2(OH)(OOH) by refluxing at 80 °C for 2 h in air, and after cooling to room temperature polyethylene glycol (PEG, average Mn 400) and 2-methoxyethanol were added with a ratio of 1:0.25:6.25, and then refluxed to adjust the viscosity and concentration of the solution before using. The film annealed at 275 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, which matches with the thermodynamic analysis of the film transition, had the best performance. To simplify the procedure, researchers directly dissolved MoO3 powder in deionized water, the production can be used as precursor solution. The additional trap state present at the interface between the annealed spin-coated sMoO3 HTL and active material made the interface more stable and significantly improved the stability of OPV cells. The relationship between the trap density (NT) and differentials of Fermi level (EF) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level EHOMO is presented in Fig. 12.164 Evidence also showed the change in the electronic structure of Mo due to the interaction between water and MoO3.165

3.3 MoO2(acac)2 precursor
In many solution-based methods for preparing MoO3 thin films, water is often present as a reactant or solvent or product, which is bad for OPV devices. To solve this problem, Heeger's group dissolved bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum (VI) dioxide (MoO2(acac)2) in methanol to form the precursor solution, and a smooth MoOX film can be obtained after spin-coating and annealing under anhydrous or ambient conditions (Fig. 13a and b).82 They also pointed out that the density of Mo5+ will affect the performance of P3HT:PC61BM cells, and only when it is minimized can the cell performance reach an equivalent level to that of the cells using PEDOT:PSS. P3HT was found to be strongly adsorbed to the anode at a critical concentration to provide a suitable electrical path, which helped to realize better device performance.167

The assignments of the major vibrational bands are included. Underlying contributions from less dominant vibrations are omitted for clarity, but are described within the main text.

Researchers also use other alcohols in place of methanol. Kirill Zilberberg et al.80 dissolved MoO2(acac)2 in isopropanol containing 0.1% moisture, but to work as a HTL in OPVs, the spin-coated films needed be heated at 130–150 °C in air for 1 h. Tan et al.168 also dissolved MoO2(acac)2 in isopropanol and spin-coated on treated ITO glass, and the annealing time was shortened to 10 minutes in air at 150 °C, and the cells can achieve high transparency and improve the stability of the device while improving PCEs. Yun-Ju Lee et al.163 dissolved MoO2(acac)2 in n-butanol, sealed and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere, and heated to 200 °C with microwaves to obtain npMoOX, and then 30 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution was added to form a stable suspension of ultra-small MoOX nanoparticles, which can be directly spin-coated on the active layer to form the HTL without further purification or heat treatment. In order to solve the wettability problem of the MoOX precursor solution on the active layer for use in inverted devices, Qiu et al.119 used a mixed solution of isopropanol and n-butanol, and then added diluted Nafion before directly spin-coating, and the cells demonstrated significantly improved stability while keeping relatively high PCEs.
3.4 Other solution processing methods
In addition to the above three commonly used precursors, other methods have also been used to prepare MoO3 ABLs by using solution processing technology. For example, Scott R. Hammond et al.86 dissolved molybdenum tricarbonyl tripropionitrile (Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3) in acetonitrile with oxygen isolation, and a MoOX film was processed by spin coating and oxygen plasma treatment.
It is also a method to prepare MoOX for solution processing directly using Mo as the precursor. Cao Yong's group dissolved Mo in H2O2, and then the purified and dried product was added to methanol as the precursor solution for processing, and the obtained S-MoOX had a matched energy level with poly[benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien) naphthothiadiazole] (PBDT-DTNT), so the cells had equivalent PCEs to the ones with PEDOT:PSS.83 For better heat dissipation, the experimental apparatus could be set in an ice bath when H2O2 was added to Mo powder. When the color of the solution turned yellow, acetic acid was added, stirred in a water bath at 40–60 °C, and finally distilled to obtain s-MoOX gel (Fig. 14). The gel is dissolved in ethanol to obtain the precursor solution, and after spin coating, an ideal MoOX film can be obtained. Since the MoOX xerogel has high solubility in alcohol solvents, it can be conveniently used for solution processing. At the same time, the treatment at about 100 °C can make s-MoOX possess a more suitable electronic state (Fig. 15), so that it can be used as an interface layer in OPV cells to achieve higher PCEs and remarkably enhanced stability.85

Another approach to avoid the large amount of heat during the reaction of Mo and H2O2 is to slow the reaction rate in the presence of ethanol, and after spin coating and heat treatment, the obtained film with a small number of oxygen vacancies has high film quality and desired electrical properties.82 Zhang et al.87 used this method to prepare a HTL with a solution-processed molybdenum trioxide (s-MoO3)/Au NPs/s-MoO3 (MAM) structure to replace PEDOT:PSS. The use of Au NPs is to improve the adhesion between the two s-MoO3 layers at the MAM pore contact. The MAM can enhance charge extraction by inhibiting bimolecular recombination and reduce leakage current by improving contact performance.
In general, preparing MoO3 films by a solution method is an important attempt to solve the problem of solution processing in OPVs. However, no method is universally suitable for conventional and inverted structures, because of the presence of moisture, or excessive heat treatment temperature, or unfavorable severe post-treatment. Thus, at present, it is extremely necessary to develop a new solution processing method, in which high temperature heat treatment and water should be avoided, so that an ideal MoO3 ABL could be obtained, which can be used directly on the active layer to simplify the fabrication procedure. What can be predicted is that solving this problem requires interdisciplinary efforts, are needed from the fields of chemical, materials science and device physics.
4. Optimization strategies for MoO3 ABLs
Direct use of MoO3 as the ABL in OPVs has a limited effect on device performance improvement due to the limitation of conductivity, and generally the thickness needs to be controlled at 15 nm or less, which is not conducive to large-scale manufacturing. Thus, researchers tried different methods to optimize the MoO3 based buffer layer to improve the device performance. According to the characteristics of different methods, they can be mainly divided into three categories including composite or hybrid formation, modification and doping.
4.1 Composite or hybrid formation
The concept of composite formation in the area of OPVs is incomprehensibly confusing to some extent. So, here we note according to the classical concept that composite or hybrid formation of MoO3 with other materials generally means the combining of two materials to change the electronic properties of the formed film while maintaining their own characteristics, thereby exerting certain influences on the properties of the film, to meet the needs of enhancing cell performance.
Based on MoO3, the addition of metal particles through some methods can improve the optical and electronic properties of MoO3, enabling more optimized applications. Liu et al.174 co-deposited a MoO3–Al composite membrane as the cathode buffer layer and double-layer MoO3/Al as the anode, which provided a simplified and economical design for inverted OPVs. By changing the Al content in the MoO3–Al composite film, as shown in Fig. 16a, the work function of the film can be adjusted. When the Al content reaches 55% (Fig. 16b), the work function can reduce 4.09 eV, matching that of the active layer materials while maintaining high transparency to meet the requirements of the cathode buffer layer for semi-transparent devices. Pan et al.175 prepared a MoO3–Au composite film as an ABL by co-evaporation. When Au was used in the composite film at 30% by weight, root mean square roughness (RMS) reduced from 4.08 nm to 1.81 nm, which brought about reduced bias-dependent carrier recombination and larger shunt resistance, which improved the FF, PCEs, and stability in air.

As we mentioned in 2.2, Ag NPs can be incorporated into MoO3 to construct a MoO3/Ag NPs/MoO3 structure as an ABL. To take full advantage of the backscattering and surface plasmon effects of Ag NPs, it is used as the rear electrode to enhance the trapping effect, and the JSC is improved, together with the maintained high VOC and FF, and improved device performance can be achieved.176 Jung et al.177 obtained precisely controlled Ag NPs by aerosol deposition on a ITO surface at room temperature and vacuum evaporated MoO3 to form a nanobump assembly (NBA) structure, and then a corrugated active layer was formed. Due to the strong forward scattering effect of the NBA structure (see Fig. 17), the poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):PC70BM cells realized remarkably increased JSC and PCEs.

A solution-processing method can also be used to prepare such a metal–metal oxide composite film. Li et al.178 prepared a hydrogen molybdenum compound (HxMoO3),84 and then dissolved it in isopropanol for spin coating. About 4 nm Ag NPs were firstly prepared and separated, and then dispersed them in hexane, followed by diluting in isopropanol. The film was obtained by spin-coating the precursor and treating in a vacuum at room temperature, thereby becoming suitable for the fabrication of an inverted device. Vacuum treatment can introduce oxygen vacancies into the molybdenum oxide film and change its WF to function as an effective HTL.
The combination of MoO3 and the most commonly used PEDOT:PSS is an important way to optimize ABLs. For example,120 by incorporating WO3 or MoO3 NPs into PEDOT:PSS, the obtained film shows different specialties due to the band structure of the two nanoparticles, in which WO3 NPs act as a hole blocking layer, while MoO3 NPs contribute to hole transfer, and the addition of an appropriate amount of nanoparticles can improve device performance. Also by using MoOX nanoparticles directly, Du et al.179 solved the problem of protonation of the PEDOT:PSS interface and aggregation of MoOX nanoparticles during coating by simply blade coating a mixture of PEDOT:PSS and MoOX nanoparticles as a HTL. A vertical component gradient was found for MoOX and PEDOT components, which brings about more MoOX nanoparticles on the top surface, while more PEDOT on the bottom surface, and PSS vertically evenly distributed. The composite hole transport layer m-HTL can also satisfy all requirements of tandem OPVs for the intermediate layer, namely high charge carrier recombination efficiency, high transparency and high physical robustness.
Other groups use MoO3 in combination with PEDOT:PSS after the synthetic step. Wang et al.180 dispersed Mo powder in ethanol and added H2O2 solution to prepare MoO3 powder, which was then dispersed in ethanol to obtain a suspension, and mixed with PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution to prepare mixed MoO3:PEDOT:PSS ink. The mixing with PEDOT:PSS inhibited the aggregation of MoO3 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 18a. The hydrophilic PSS chain was preferentially bonded to MoO3 and passivated. The stronger adhesion between MoO3 nanoparticles and the photoactive layer made the MoO3:PEDOT:PSS mixed ink possess an improved film-forming ability, so that it can be deposited on a hydrophobic photoactive layer without any surface treatment, together with the weak dependence of PCEs on the HTL's thickness, making it suitable for roll-to-roll printing processes. Shao et al.158 formed MoO3in situ in a PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion. The MoO3–PEDOT:PSS composite film utilized the high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and the environmental stability of MoO3 (Fig. 18b–g), thus having a smooth surface and a significantly decreased hygroscopicity. When the cells are stored in ambient air for 10 days in the dark, PCEs can retain 80% of their original value. Lee et al.159 dissolved AHM in water to obtain a solution of MoOX, added 5% isopropanol and mixed with PEDOT:PSS in a certain ratio, processed in an ambient atmosphere and heat treated in a glove box for P3HT:ICBA cells, and considering that PEDOT:PSS:MoOX had a water vapor transmission rate of 0.17 g per m2 per day, which was much lower than that of PEDOT:PSS, it was better to protect the active layer from moisture and thus increase the lifetime. Chen et al.181 prepared an aqueous solution of MoO3 by a reported method,77 and then added 5% isopropanol, and mixed it with PEDOT:PSS in a certain ratio for spin coating ABLs. The MoO3 in the mixed film formed small “islands”, which extended the interfacial contact area between the active layer P3HT:PC61BM and PEDOT:PSS, and facilitated hole collection and prevented electron transport at the anode, and the PCEs and stability were both significantly improved.

MoO3 is also used in combination with other organic materials as an ABL. Shi et al.182 co-evaporated MoO3:4,4′-N,N′-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP:MoO3) as a hole extraction layer (HEL) in P3HT:PCBM inverted OSCs. When the thickness of the HEL is no more than 20 nm, CBP:MoO3 can realize an equivalent JSC and improved FF compared to MoO3, and bring about higher PCEs. More commonly, this idea is applied in small molecule OSCs. Guan et al.183 incorporated MoO3 into 3,4,9,10-isobutylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) (molar ratio 1:1) as a buffer layer for copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60 PHJ OSCs, which extended the lifetime by four to five times due to greatly improved surface topography. Mixing MoO3 in CuPc as a buffer layer in CuPc/C60 heterojunction OSCs can also make the ITO surface smoother and improve the stability.184 Lou et al.185 doped MoO3 into pentacene to serve as a buffer layer at the anode of a pentacene/C60 PHJ OSC and a multi-charge separation layer between pentacene and C60. The JSC and VOC of the device were simultaneously improved, due to the effective charge transfer between the MoO3 and pentacene and the improved surface morphology.
4.2 Modification
Here, the method of modification generally means inserting another layer between MoO3 and the electrode or active layer to improve its contact interface with the electrode or active layer, thereby improving the performance of the device in terms of PCE and/or stability.
One method is to insert an organic layer between MoO3 and the active layer in a conventional structure to optimize the interface between the ABL and the active layer. Zheng et al.186 thermally evaporated poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl))diphenylamine)] (TFB) on a MoO3 layer to fabricate a bilayer HTL for application in P3HT:PCBM cells. Since the addition of TFB improves the interface morphology and makes the energy levels more compatible, JSC and PCE were significantly improved while maintaining 90% transparency in the visible region. Cheng et al.187 inserted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) between MoO3 and P3HT:PCBM, in which MoO3 enhanced the effectiveness of extracting holes, prevented exciton annihilation, and reduced interface resistance due to energy level alignment; CuPc, on the other hand, optimized the device performance by further expanding the visible absorption spectrum range. Inserting pentacene between MoO3 and CuPc/C60 can prevent moisture and oxygen from diffusing into the active layer, thereby increasing VOC, FF and lifetime.188
A similar strategy can also be used for inverted structures. Li et al.189 spin-coated a layer of PEDOT:PSS dissolved in isopropanol between the active layer and MoO3 to reduce charge recombination. The incorporated PEDOT:PSS electrolyte can improve the interfacial contact between PTB7:PC71BM and the electrode by establishing a composite PEDOT:PSS/MoO3 HTL (Fig. 19). The composite interface layer can optimize the boundary morphology and adjust the anode energy level alignment (Fig. 19d–f), thus forming a uniform and ordered hole transport channel, eliminating defect states and interface barriers and enhancing the JSC, VOC and FF of the device. Wang et al.190 introduced a 3 nm rubrene layer between MoO3 and PTB7:PC71BM, and the PCE can be improved by 12% (from 7.2% to 8.1%). The insertion of the rubrene layer can inhibit exciton quenching and improve exciton dissociation, resulting in more efficient charge carrier collection and weaker charge recombination to improve device performance. Li et al.191 inserted (N,N′-diphenyl)-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB) between MoO3 and the active layer as a double buffer layer, because NPB can effectively prevent charge recombination at the interface of the MoO3 HEL, reduce the interface resistance caused by the formation of the ohmic contact, and form a NPB/PCBM dissociation interface to enhance the dissociation of the excitons, thereby obtaining improved performance. Subbiah et al.192 thermally evaporated 4,4′,4′′-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino] three aniline (MTDATA) at the anode as an ABL together with MoO3, and higher PCEs were obtained due to improved hole extraction ability resulting from the occurrence of band bending (Fig. 20).

Furthermore, inserting a suitable material between MoO3 and the electrode can also enhance the performance. For example, thermally evaporating poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) between ITO and MoO3 to form a two-layer interface dipole can increase the surface WF of the ITO anode, contribute to the extraction of holes and suppress the carrier combination at the interface, bring about a significant improvement in both FF and PCE values compared to devices using PTFE or MoO3 or PEDOT:PSS.193 Qin et al.194 spin-coated ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) between thermally deposited MoO3 and Ag to construct a MoO3/PEIE/Ag structure as a HEL to improve the performance of inverted OSCs. The PEIE intermediate layer can separate MoO3 from Ag, thereby suppressing the reduction of MoO3 to low oxidation state Mo by gaseous Ag and consequently decreasing the WF, to significantly reduce the anode resistance of the inverted device.
Inorganic materials can also be used to modify MoO3. Schulz et al.195 inserted solution-processed sNiOX between ITO and MoO3 to form a two-layer HEL. This double-layer anode combined the hole extraction and electron blocking capabilities of the two components, and there existed a small energy barrier between the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MoO3 and the valence band maximum (VBM) of sNiOX, so energy level alignment occurred between MoO3 and sNiOX, which allowed efficient charge transfer at the interface. In contrast, cells built with this double layer show superior performance to single oxide layer cells. Liu et al.196 spin-coated oleylamine-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) onto the active layer, and then thermally evaporated MoO3 and Ag to form an anode electrode in an inverted OPV. Since oleylamine-functionalized GO had a shallower conduction band energy level (ECB) and a higher valence band energy level (EVB), it enhanced the ability of transport and collection of charge carriers and avoided single molecule combination between the active layer and HEL. Li Qi et al.197 prepared an Al2O3 film on the active layer by spin-coating precursor solution and low-temperature annealing before thermal evaporation of MoO3, and the obtained Al2O3/MoO3 composite ABL enhanced the ability of the anode to collect holes in inverted OPVs, and passivated the active layer of the cells, thereby improving the photovoltaic performance and stability.
In small molecular OPV cells, CuI is often used to modify MoO3.198 In CuPc/C60 PHJ OSCs, using MoO3/CuI as a double-layer ABL can significantly improve the cell performance, wherein CuI improved the absorbance of the CuPc film by a specific molecular order, and prevented the formation of a leak path of the OSC device. Jean Christian Bernede et al.199 used a mixed anode buffer layer in a small molecule device with thienylenevinylene-triphenylamine with peripheral dicyanovinylene groups (TDCV-TPA) as the donor and fullerene C60 as the acceptor. MoO3/CuI combined the advantages of both to improve the conductivity of the TDCV-TPA film, reduced the leakage current, greatly improved the hole collection ability, and significantly improved the cell performance. A similar strategy was applied to SubPc/C60-based planar OSCs. The insertion of CuI improved the hole mobility and caused a significant increase in JSC, and also made the SubPc film more uniform and smoother.200
4.3 Doping
In the field of materials science, doping often means that some elements need to be added to the structure of the material by some methods. Therefore, for MoO3, it is common to introduce some elements during the preparation process to obtain doped MoO3, thereby improving or changing certain properties of the film to meet the needs of the device.
Wang et al.162 dispersed the prepared Yb/Er-doped MoO3 in ethanol and deposited it on ITO as a HEL by the doctor blading method. The MoO3 nanoparticles doped with Yb3+ sensitized Er3+ can be excited with a 975 nm laser diode, so the composite film showed strong up-conversion emission under illumination, and its emission band matched well with the absorption of P3HT, making it suitable for using in OSCs to improve the near-infrared and infrared sensitivity. Marchal et al.201 used a solution-processing method170 to prepare a MoOX ABL, and zirconium and tin additives were introduced to optimize the MoOX layer. Since the additive did not affect the molybdenum oxide composition or the electron band structure, the dopant effect, which meant different chemical properties caused by fundamentally different structural properties, was not observed when the hetero atom and the molybdenum oxide were formed. Since the crystallinity was lowered, the surface roughness was improved at the time of film formation, and remarkable improvement of the device performance followed. In the solution-processing procedure to prepare MoO3,202 Chang et al.203 added different proportions of ammonium metavanadate to acquire a vanadium-doped MoOX film as a hole transport layer (HTL). V0.05MoOX had the smallest band offset between its valence band edge and P3HT HOMO, and exhibited the lowest resistivity among all the (V) MoOX films, which was beneficial for hole transport from P3HT to the ITO anode, so devices with this HTL can reach optimum performance. Tan et al.169 also employed a similar approach, unlike the step-by-step strategy,195 and introduced a small amount of p-type NiOX into n-type MoO3 in one step. Since MoO3:NiOX was highly transparent and had a conduction band of 3.25 eV and a WF of 5.10 eV (Fig. 21), it can effectively block electron transport while enhancing charge collection, and the electronic lifetime of PBDB-T:IT-M (chemical structure shown in Fig. 21h) based devices was also extended from 0.63 to 5.05 μs, and all of these contributed to the improved device performance.

Unlike the doping of metal elements as described above, Qin et al.204 proposed using S-doped p-type MoOX as an ABL. Using MoS2 as a target, they prepared a sulfur-doped molybdenum oxide (S-MoO3) film on a glass substrate coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) by magnetron sputtering. The control of the oxygen flow ratio can adjust the doping amount of sulfur in MoO3, thereby controlling the composition ratio of Mo4+/Mo5+/Mo6+, the Fermi level, electron affinity, the ionization energy of the valence band and the band gap (Fig. 22). The sulfur doping brought about a Mo5+ and Mo4+ occupied Mo 4d band, which was the main factor affecting the valence electron structure of S-MoO3. These orbital overlaps promoted the valence band close to the Fermi level of S-MoO3, which finally constituted the unique p-type MoO3.

As we mentioned above, MoO3 has an adjustable electronic structure, and in extreme situations, adding an appropriate amount of Cs to MoO3 can adjust the work function making it suitable for use as a cathode buffer layer (CBL). Xu et al.205 incorporated MoO3 into an aqueous solution-treated Cs2CO3 film as a CBL, thereby improving the VOC of the device, while JSC was not affected, and therefore improved device performance of P3HT:IC60BA cells was achieved. Hou and CH Choy et al.206 used the solution-processing method reported by their group84,178 to prepare MoOX as a HTL, and to incorporate with Cs as an ETL. Controlling the degree of Cs incorporation can adjust the WF of the film. And because of its processing feature, it can be applied to both conventional and inverted devices as a HTL or ETL to meet the needs of different structural devices, which was helpful for fabricating large-scale and low-cost devices.
In this section, we can conclude that many strategies can be applied to adjust the electronic structure or optimize the contact of MoO3 with active materials or electrodes. However, the strategies are mostly limited to some specific systems, which obviously severely limits its universality.
5. Other applications of MoO3 in OPVs
In order to meet the requirements of the application of OPVs in PCEs and stability and in the meanwhile to make the most use of organic materials with flexibility and light transmission, people have developed inverted devices, tandem devices, flexible devices, semi-transparent devices and so on. MoO3 has a wide band gap (>3.0 eV),207 so there is almost no absorption in the visible-infrared region60 and is essentially transparent in the visible-infrared region. The use of MoO3 in transparent and tandem OPV cells gives a combination of excellent optical transmission and excellent charge transport performance. Due to its excellent optical transmission and stability in the device, MoO3 can also play an important role in these new or functional devices.
5.1 Inverted OPVs
To a certain extent, inverted architectures can protect the active layer from water and oxygen in the environment and avoid the problem of unstable low-work-function metal cathode and ITO/PEDOT:PSS anode interfaces, and thus can significantly improve the performance of OPV cells, becoming a commonly used structure in various fields of OPVs.6 An inverted device can also be optimized with MoO3 by the three ways described above to achieve better performance.118,119,158,174,179,190,204 When the researchers exploring the performance of new active layer materials and their application characteristic,208 or fabricating large-area modules,209etc., most of them will chose MoO3 as the first option for ABL material.
Through the combination of experiment and calculation, it is pointed out that the optical properties and interface characteristics of an inverted structure can make the performance more superior.99 Kyaw et al.67 first used thermally deposited MoO3 as the ABL of P3HT:PCBM BHJ. Due to the blocking effect of MoO3 on electrons/excitons, it can be applied to inverted devices, and showed larger VOC and FF. When Ag was used as the metal electrode, the devices can achieve the highest PCEs, while Al can make MoO3 reach the thickest (5 nm) due to the generation of MoO2 at the interface between MoO3 and Al, which has no influence on the transfer of charges.210 William Greenbank et al.208 also found that when MoO3 and silver were used as HTL and electrode materials respectively, the device performed poorly under hot conditions, which proved that Ag was not heat resistant. The optimal thickness of MoO3 as a HTL is similar to that in previous studies on inverted devices. In P3HT:PCBM cells, it is generally about 5 nm,211,212 but also had something to do with the thickness of the active layer as shown in Fig. 23.212 Researchers also studied P3HT:PC71BM cells and found that the optimal thickness is 2 nm.213
 Fig. 23  (a–c) The I–V characteristics of inverted devices with P3HT:PCBM: (a) 85 nm, (b) 140 nm, and (c) 205 nm, and different thicknesses of the MoO3 layer under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. (d–f) The normalized simulation of the optical field distribution (for 520 nm illumination) as a function of the distance from the ITO/P3HT:PCBM interface in these inverted cells: (d) 85 nm P3HT:PCBM, (e) 140 nm P3HT:PCBM, and (f) 205 nm P3HT:PCBM. These cells have the structures of ITO/Ca (0.5 nm)/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3(x nm)/Ag(100 nm) with x = 3, 5, 7.5, and 10. The ultrathin Ca is neglected in the simulation.212 Reproduced from ref. 212 with permission from Elsevier. 
An inverted structure can also be combined with the other properties of OSCs to meet different needs, such as the fabrication of semi-transparent and flexible devices. Xu et al.214 used an anode of WO3/Ag/MoO3 structure in an inverted device, where MoO3 acts as a light coupling layer to enhance the transmittance of the device under visible light conditions. Under the optimized thickness of 40 nm, optimal PCEs are achieved with 80% transmittance. MoO3/Metal/MoO3 is a commonly used inverted device anode electrode structure. Cho et al.215 found that in ITO/Cs2CO3/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag/MoO3 structure cells, the thickness of the internal MoO3 layer has a greater impact on performance than the external MoO3 layer. The best performance was observed using this dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) multilayer anode with a thickness of 6/10/40 nm. However, Li et al.216 believed that in a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag/MoO3 device, the device performance had significant dependence on the thickness, resistivity and light transmission of the outer layer MoO3 in the MoO3/Ag/MoO3 structure. When light was incident from the top electrode, 20 nm was the best thickness for the largest PCE value, and when light was incident from the bottom electrode, 80 nm was the optimal thickness. Shunjiro Fujii et al.217 prepared a semi-transparent inverted BHJ solar cell with a device structure of glass/ITO/poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Au/MoO3, which showed 44% transparency when the incident light is 550 nm, and two stacked cells can show 17% transmittance at 550 nm. Such an electrode structure can also be applied to flexible devices. For example, Leonat et al.55 used paper as a substrate to fabricate a flexible inverted device, and the MoO3/Ag/MoO3 structure was applied as a semi-transparent top electrode, which shows an interesting application possibility (Fig. 24). Of course, a flexible device can also be fabricated using a MoO3/Ag top electrode, similar to a general inverted structure without modification.57

5.2 Semi-transparent OPVs
Semi-transparent OPVs (STOPVs) are currently attractive as the most prominent component of integrated photovoltaic power generation218,219 and potential OPV greenhouses.220,221 In STOPVs, transparent electrodes are a very important component. Because MoOX films have good transmission in the visible range, they are widely used in STOPVs.222 In semi-transparent and tandem devices, MoO3 can be used alone as an ABL,223,224 and can also be used together with metals225 or other materials226 as electrodes.
The most straightforward way is to use MoO3 in combination with other transparent electrode materials to achieve light transmission. For example, in P3HT:PCBM inverted cells, MoO3/ITO works as a transparent electrode, and the MoO3 layer prevents the active material from damage during the ITO sputtering process, and achieves a high transmittance of 80% in the red region of the visible spectrum.227 Yin et al.228 used a transparent ZnMgO modified cathode in combination with a thin MoO3/Ag anode and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM as the active layer. The obtained devices had high PCEs with adjustable average transmittance for visible light and good color perception close to white light (Fig. 25). The combination of a ZnMgO modified cathode and MoO3/Ag anode brought about a great extension of the lifetime of the device due to the blocking effect on oxygen and water. Shi et al.229 used 1 nm thick MoO3 as a nucleation layer to thermally evaporate ultra-thin silver to obtain a transparent electrode. In the presence of a MoO3 nucleation layer, Ag formed a porous film and achieves a smooth distribution. The increased deposition rate can significantly improve the surface morphology and electrode properties of the Ag film. The optimized semi-transparent OSC exhibits an average transmittance of 38% in the visible range.

The dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) multilayer structure is a commonly used transparent electrode structure, and MoO3 can function as a dielectric. Due to the good optical properties of MoO3 and Ag, MoO3/Ag/MoO3 (MAM) is the most commonly used transparent electrode. Dong Chan Lim et al.230 introduced MAM as a transparent top electrode to prepare a high performance STOPV. The conductivity of the electrode was controlled by the intermediate Ag layer sandwiched between two MoO3 layers, so the PCE value also depended on the thickness of the intermediate Ag layer. By controlling the thickness of the Ag layer, a PCE value of 4.5% to 9.1% can be obtained when the maximum transparency in the visible light region was from ∼50% to ∼5% as shown in Fig. 26b and c. Tao et al.231 used MAM as a transparent anode, and an ultra-thin internal MoO3 layer as a buffer layer to improve the hole collection ability, and the external MoO3 layer worked as a light-coupling layer to enhance the optical transmittance of the device, whose thickness had a significant effect on the device performance, and the direction of the incident light will also bring about different PCE values. Nicholas P. Sergeant et al.232 fabricated and optimized a MAM anode to have a sheet resistance lower than that of ITO. The OSCs based on these electrodes were spectrally tuned to create an optical cavity that enhanced the absorption of the photoactive layer in the weaker spectral region, making the OPVs based on the MAM electrode reveal excellent optical and electrical properties. Zhang et al.233 used a MAM multilayer film as a transparent anode in PTB7:PC70BM cells, and a short-pitch Ag grating was applied to the cathode to improve the absorption of the active layer, and the absorption was enhanced by more than 500%. MAM can also be applied in small molecular devices. Kao et al.234 applied UV ozone treatment in the preparation of a MAM structure, after the evaporation of the underlying MoO3, and thus a highly continuous and smooth silver (Ag) film can be obtained as a transparent electrode. UVO treatment can oxidize and modify the surface of non-stoichiometric MoO3 (or MoO3−X), further increase the MoO6+/Mo5+ composition ratio and the WF of MoO3−X, effectively improve wettability of Ag on MoO3, and bring about the enhanced lateral growth of the Ag film. The MAM multilayer electrode after 3 minutes UVO treatment on MoO3 had the best optical and electrical properties in CuPc/C60 PHJ OSCs. Tian et al.235 used a MAM grating as a transparent anode and patterned CuPc/C60 as an active layer. This one-dimensional (1D) grating with a core–shell structure achieved broadband omnidirectional light absorption enhancement, which was an improvement of 178.88%, 19.44% and 99.16% in the wavelength range from 400 to 900 nm under normal incident transverse magnetic (TM), transverse electrical (TE) and TM/TE mixed polarized light respectively. L. Cattin et al.236 uses a MoO3 (45 nm)/Ag (x nm)/MoO3 (37.5 nm) structure as a transparent anode of PHJ CuPc/C60, and the transmittance of the structure decreased with the increase of the thickness of silver. The best Ag thickness was 10 nm, and under these conditions, the resistivity of the anode was 8 × 10−5 Ω cm, and the transmittance at around 600 nm was 80%. Their study also showed that when the anode of the cell was an ITO film, the introduction of a thin (3 nm) MoO3 layer at the anode (ITO)/organic electron donor (CuPc) interface can reduce the energy barrier caused by the difference between them, to achieve high hole transport efficiency between CuPc and the anode.122

A new transparent electrode can also be prepared by changing any layer of the DMD structure. Jung et al.237 changed the inner dielectric in contact with the active layer, which proved that bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag/MoO3 can be used as a transparent cathode for high-efficiency OPVs (Fig. 27d–f). When an Ag layer was sandwiched between high-refractive BCP and MoO3 layers, BCP/Ag/MoO3 can realize optimal zero-reflection conditions, resulting in high optical transmittance (75.5%) and low sheet resistance (8.6 ohm sq−1), suitable for general transparency of flexible organic optoelectronic device cathodes. There are multiple options for changing the outer dielectric layer (not in contact with the active layer). Shen's group constructed a MoO3/Ag/WO3 high transparent anode.238 In inverted OPVs, the inner MoO3 layer served as a buffer layer to improve hole collection, while the outer WO3 layer was used as a light coupling layer to enhance the optical transmittance of the device, and the thickness of the outer WO3 layer has a significant influence on the device performance, and a semi-transparent inverted OPV with a 40 nm thick outer WO3 layer can achieve a high 90% transmittance. They also replaced WO3 with V2O5 to construct a MoO3/Ag/V2O5 transparent anode. When the thickness of V2O5 was 40 nm, the maximum transmittance from 400 nm to 700 nm was obtained as 90%.226 Hyung Woo Choi et al.239 directly deposited on a glass substrate by a combination of radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) sputtering to obtain a ZnO/Ag/MoO3 (ZAM) multilayer electrode, which was used for BHJ OPVs. It can exhibit very low sheet resistance without post-annealing, but MoO3 had low transmittance after deposition, so the PCE is lower than that of OPVs on ITO. Alexander T. Barrows et al.240 used MAM and TeO2/Ag/MoO3 (TAM) as none-indium electrodes of PCDTBT:PC70BM cells, and TeO2 seed layer electrodes promoted the growth of a more continuous silver layer at a low film thickness, thereby enhancing optical transmittance and reducing surface resistance. Juyoung Ham et al.241 changed the outer dielectric to non-conductive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which was easy to process and reduced the reflection loss caused by contact with air due to its flexibility, thermoset and low refractive index.

Using different intermediate metals can have various effects. V. V. Travkin et al.242 tested eight metals as intermediate layers in a MoOX/metal/MoOX composite electrode, using ultra-thin transparent electrodes with a fixed thickness deposited on glass through thermal vacuum evaporation. Comparing the optical transmission and surface resistance of the electrodes as the key parameters of photovoltaic applications, it was found that electrodes with noble metal (Au and Ag) interlayers have better conductivity, and their average transparency in the visible and near-infrared ranges was similar to that of electrodes with reactive metals (Al, Mg, and Yb). Md. Maniruzzaman et al.58 prepared a MoO3-PEDOT:PSS composite layer for using in a MoO3/Au/MoO3-PEDOT:PSS multilayer electrode. The electrode with a structure of MoO3 (30 nm)/Au (12 nm)/MoO3-PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PEDOT:PSS had 7% higher optical transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm than that of MoO3 (30 nm)/Au (12 nm)/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm). Since the acidic PEDOT:PSS on the multilayer electrode inhibits the dissolution of MoO3, the JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of the device were significantly improved. This group243 also inserted an Al2O3 protective barrier layer (1 nm) on the MoO3/Au/MoO3 electrode, effectively protected MoO3 from acidic and water-dispersed PEDOT:PSS and reduced the WF of the PEDOT:PSS film. The MoO3/Au/MoO3/Al2O3/PEDOT:PSS electrode had a maximum optical transmission of 66% at a wavelength of 550 nm.
5.3 Tandem OPVs
Compared to single junction OPVs, tandem OPVs typically contain two or more (normally two) sub-cells, aiming to improve the device photoresponse by synergistic interaction of different sub-cells to capture a wider range of the solar spectrum.13 Tandem OPVs can make full use of solar energy,244 and thus improve the efficiency of the device.14 In tandem OPVs, the intermediate layer connects two sub-cells, so it needs to possess both charge transfer and light transmission characteristics. From the processing point of view, the intermediate layer should not affect the active layer of the front sub-cell, and protect it from damage during the subsequent processing,245 and it is essential to be processed in a simpler manner.246–249 So we can say that the intermediate layer plays a key role in making full use of solar energy, improving cell efficiency and reducing manufacturing costs. Based on the good optical transmission, suitable electronic properties and potential of solution processing exhibited by MoO3, it is also widely used and researched as a very important component in the intermediate layer.250,251
At present, most of the tandem OPVs are connected in series, in which VOC approximates to the sum of the sub-cells’ VOC values, while JSC is determined by the lower JSC of the sub-cells, and they can also be divided into conventional and inverted according to the structure geometries of the cells. In conventional structures, MoO3 usually works as an ABL of the upper sub-cell, and cooperates with other transparent materials, which act as electrode or CBLs, such as Al, Ag, Au and so on. In the early stage, Zhao et al.252 designed an ITO/PEDOT (40 nm)/P3HT:PCBM (120 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (1 nm)/MoO3 (15 nm)/CuPc (7.5 nm)/CuPc:C60 (12.5:12.5 nm)/C60 (27.5 nm)/bathophenanthroline (BPhen, 8 nm)/Ag (80 nm) structure for conventional tandem OSCs, with Al and MoO3 as the intermediate layer, and the optimized thickness is 1 nm and 15 nm, respectively, and electrical connection was achieved in series due to the high transparency (up to ∼98% in the range of 350 to 900 nm) and efficient charge collection. The thick MoO3 provided complete protection of the previously deposited polymer layer from being dissolved during the top cell polymer coating, thereby achieving a solution treated polymer tandem cell with a high PCE. Similarly, Ca/Al/MoO3, Ca/Ag/MoO3 and Ca/Au/MoO3 can also be used as an intermediate layer, and evidence demonstrated that Ag and Au showed better performance than Al.253,254 Cr/MoO3 was also used as the intermediate layer of tandem devices and showed 80% transparency at incident light wavelengths above 375 nm, and brought about a relatively higher PCE value.255 Theoretical simulations revealed the changeable WF of MoO3 on graphene (Fig. 27).256 Liming Dai's group used graphene oxide in the middle layer of a series OPV with two PCDTBT:PCBM as active sub-cells, in GO-Cs/Al/GO/MoO3, and MoO3 was used as an ABL of the top cell, and the addition of GO is beneficial to increase JSC and VOC, thereby improving the efficiency of the cells.257
Due to the rapid development of inverted OPVs, inverted tandem devices have also been extensively studied. In inverted tandem OPVs, the structure of the intermediate layer is contrast to that of the conventional devices, in which MoO3 works as an ABL of the bottom cell, and the electrode and CBL are on the top of it. Yang Yang's group258 used MoO3/Al/ZnO as the intermediate layer to achieve good electrical and optical coupling of two sub-cells. The intermediate layer was visible, and the absorption in the near infrared spectrum was negligible, so that the device can take full advantage of the sub-cells, which have a complementary absorption spectrum, to increase the photo-generated current of both the single cell and the series cell, and the stability was improved as well. In their later work,259 they replaced Al with modified PEDOT:PSS and tandem devices with two poly[2,7-(5,5-bis-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-5H-dithieno[3,2 b:2′,3′-d]pyran)-alt-4,7-(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothia diazole)] (PDTP-DFBT):PC71BM sub-cells achieved a PCE of 10.2%. Zhao et al.260 prepared an inverted tandem OSC with MoO3/Ag/Al/Ca as the intermediate layer and MoO3 as the ABL. MoO3 prevented exciton quenching and charge loss on the anode side, which might result in an increase in interface resistance. The increase in the thickness of MoO3 might result in a decrease in VOC, but had little effect on the FF, and the device PCE was optimized when the thickness was 5 nm. Liu et al.261 used MoO3/MoO3–Al as the intermediate layer in inverted series OPVs, and MoO3 was first vapor-deposited and MoO3–Al was co-deposited therewith, wherein MoO3 worked as the HTL of the previous cell, and MoO3–Al as the ETL of the rear cell. Tan's group used MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br as the intermediate layer combining 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (PBDTBDD):PC70BM and PTB7-Th:2,2'-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′] dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl)) bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F) sub-cells to build an ITO/TIPD/PBDTBDD:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Al inverted tandem OPV. The device exhibited a strong and broad photo-response at wavelengths between 300 and 1000 nm.262
Rare but significant, MoOX can also be used in a parallel tandem OPV. Lee et al.263 used a MoOX/Ag/MoOX (MAM) three-layer electrode as the intermediate layer, to connect sub-cells of solution-processed poly{2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione} (PBDTT-DPP):PCBM and thermal evaporated C70:TAPC, and studies showed that the photo-generated current of the front sub-cell depended on the thickness of the two MoOX layers, and that of the rear sub-cell depended mainly on the thickness of the adjacent MoOX layer. Based on the combination of experimental and simulated methods, the modified PEDOT:PSS (m-PEDOT:PSS, 5 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/Ag (8–10 nm)/Au (1–2 nm)/MoO3 composite layer acted as the intermediate layer, and PTB7-Th:ITIC as the active layer of two sub-cells to form a parallel tandem device, and an improved photon-electron response in the range of 450 to 800 nm was exhibited, along with a high JSC (Fig. 28). Due to reduced recombination loss under dilution light intensity, the sub-cell also showed a high FF, resulting in a device with a total PCE of more than 10%, which with 4TIC as the acceptor material can reach about 11.08%.264

6. Conclusion and prospects
For more than ten years, MoO3 has been widely studied in the field of OPVs. Due to its suitable photoelectric properties, excellent environmental stability, good interface properties with the active layer or electrode material, and simple and effective processing and optimization method, MoO3 can satisfy various needs of interface materials in OPVs, and can be widely used to explore new materials, develop highly efficient or stable devices, and research flexible or semi-transparent devices, etc., showing good development prospects and commercialization potential. There's no doubt that the processing procedure has significant impacts on the electronic structure of MoO3, and when optimization methods are applied, great improvement can be achieved.
To further improve the performance of MoO3 in OPVs and meet the requirement for commercialization, some considerations for MoO3 ABLs are listed as follows:
From the perspective of processing technology, a universal solution processing method is needed to be developed. Some of the solution processing methods known at present are not suitable for inverted devices, because of the participation or production of water, while the other methods can be applied to inverted devices, but for the currently most researched conjugated polymer high-efficient active layer materials, they fail to meet the usage requirements in devices. Therefore, developing a broadly suitable preparation method from the perspective of chemistry and materials science may be an effective way to solve the problem.
From the perspective of commercial application, it is necessary to increase the thickness of MoO3 as an effective interface material. Due to the limitation of the charge transport capability of MoO3, it is generally required to control the thickness of the film to about 10 nm or less as a buffer layer. Such a small thickness is not conducive to a simple processing method such as doctor blading and is disadvantageous for commercialization. Therefore, the development of new technology for solution-processing MoO3, especially applying on inverted devices to make a thicker and more efficient buffer layer, needs to be continuously explored in theory and practice.
Last but not least, it is necessary to fully understand the relationship between the composition, structure, processing method and device performance of the MoO3 buffer layer. At present, we know that materials can be composited or doped to change the composition of the material, thereby changing the electronic structure, and materials with specific structures and compositions can be obtained by different processing methods, thereby improving the device performance. However, due to the complex physical processes in the photoelectric conversion process of OPVs, it is still very difficult to fully understand how MoO3 affects the final performance of the device, which requires more detailed experimental analysis and in-depth theoretical research, which is also beneficial for the application of MoO3 in other kinds of solar cells and the study of new buffer layer materials.
