    , Accepted 21st September 2022First published on 24th September 2022AbstractExtensive research on the synthesis and application of triazine derivatives for electroluminescent devices, phosphorescent emitters, hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells, and TADF materials has been published recently. This review covers article data on the modern trends in design of functionalized triazines obtained within the period 2010–2021. Star-shaped aryl(hetaryl) and arylvinyl derivatives of 1,3,5-triazine, their photoluminescence and application for fluorescent sensors to nitro-containing explosives or proton-controlled optical sensors are discussed. Examples of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives exhibiting two-photon absorption, two-photon excited fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties are reviewed. Hyper-branched and linear polymers for multilayer data storage application are reported. The future development of 1,3,5-triazine-based functional materials is undoubtedly related to the creation of more advanced molecules for PhOLEDs, highly effective organic chromophores with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials as well as ones for energy storage.Emiliya V.

1. Introduction
π-Conjugated compounds based on the 1,3,5-triazine core have been studied as attractive molecules for functional photoelectric materials due to the intriguing structural and electronic properties of the s-triazine moiety.1
1,3,5-Triazines may be considered as triaza-analogs of benzenes with three alternate carbon atoms replaced by nitrogen atoms. s-Triazines possess high affinity for electrons and good thermal stability, so they can serve as effective electron acceptors in the design of donor–acceptor systems.2,3 In addition, the structural symmetry and the spatial coplanarity make s-triazine attractive for functionalization with a variety of structural (electron-donating) units. Moreover, s-triazine in many cases would improve the electron-injection and electron-transportation abilities of its conjugated derivatives.4,5
Within the whole catalogue of organic (semiconductive) materials, 1,3,5-triazine derivatives have become a focus due to their exceptional properties derived from their unique structure combining strong electron-accepting ability and high symmetry. Consequently, introducing a 1,3,5-triazine unit into the backbone of conjugated molecules would influence the electron-injection and electron-transportation abilities of such molecules as well as increase their heat resistance. Undoubtedly, from the point of view of optoelectronic material applications, organic molecules possessing both good electron-injection and/or transportation ability along with high (thermo)stability are highly desirable. Thus, in recent years, one can observe an increasing interest in the synthesis and investigation of the chemical/photophysical/electronic properties of s-triazine-based π-conjugated small molecules and oligomers/polymers.
Two types of 1,3,5-triazines for possible application in optoelectronic devices can be outlined: s-triazines, containing donor moieties at all three positions (2, 4 and 6) of the triazine core, and 2-aryl-subsituted s-triazines, bearing one donor and one acceptor substituent at 4- and 6-positions of a conjugated system; the first type of star-shaped molecule is more widely used.
In most small molecule-based OLEDs, the emitter layer includes a phosphorescent dye that is doped into the host material to avoid concentration quenching and to optimize the charge balance. Efficient energy transfer from the host molecule to the phosphorescent dye molecule is required. To meet this requirement the energy of the triplet state of the host should be higher than that of the guest energy, and for the blue phosphorescent emitters the triplet energies exceed 2.8 eV. Organic molecules containing aromatic amine or carbazole fragments possess significantly high hole conductivity, while electron-deficient heterocycles such as s-triazines exhibit good electron conductivity. For this reason, s-triazines are used as electron transport layers in OLEDs, while the hole conductivity of the most of s-triazines is insufficient for their application as host materials. s-Triazine derivatives represent effective building blocks for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules.6–8 Thus, various 9H-carbazol-9-yl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives have been prepared and are widely used as high triplet energy host materials for the blue TADF OLEDs.9,10

s-Triazine-based push–pull systems have found application as fluorescent sensors11 or probes12 for nitro-containing explosives. Recently, the nonlinear optical properties of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives have been systematically studied.13,14 Finally, the s-triazine unit is remarkable for other reasons, such as supramolecular interactions with applications in host–guest chemistry, anion recognition, sensors, electronics, and magnetism.15
2. Synthesis and photophysical properties of aryl- and heteroaryl-1,3,5-triazines
A common approach to symmetrically substituted, i.e., containing three identical aryl moieties, 2,4,6-triaryl-1,3,5-triazines 2 is based on the acid-catalyzed trimerization of the corresponding aromatic nitriles 1. Thus, 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine 2а (TRZ) was obtained by means of cyclotrimerization of benzonitrile in the presence of combined catalyst PCl5–HCl,16 and 2,4,6-tris(4-bromophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine 2b was prepared by trimerization of 4-bromobenzonitrile in the presence of CF3SO3H (Scheme 1).17

s-Triazine 2a represents a promising acceptor core in star-shaped chromophores due to its dendritic framework, rigid skeleton, and good electrical conductivity. However, the application of 2a is still limited due to its poor performance in devices.1
Shin et al. studied the electroluminescent devices of four-layer structure (ITO/hole transporting layer (HTL)/emitting layer/Al), in which s-triazine 2a was introduced as dopant into the poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVC) (Fig. 1a). The highest luminescence of devices (778 cd m−2) was observed at the concentration of 10 wt% 2a in the PVC layer (Fig. 1b).18

Much effort has been made to improve the properties of s-triazine-based materials, mainly by introducing aryl residues of different nature into the s-triazine core. Thus, (bromophenyl)substituted triazine 2b was chosen as the key intermediate to synthesize aryl, naphthyl and pyren-1-yl substituted triazines 3a–evia Suzuki coupling reactions (Scheme 2).19
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of substituted triazines 3a–e. Reagents and conditions: (i): Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3, benzene/ethanol mixture. 
According to CV measurements, the reduction potentials of 3a–e were from −2.09 to −2.14 V (vs. Fc/Fc+), and the electron affinity of the s-triazine core was affected slightly by the terminal groups attached to the phenylene spacer. 1-Naphthyl derivative 3c (Tg 133 °C) was proved to be the only compound in these series to exhibit glass transition. Ishi-i et al.19 concluded that the combination of the star-shaped core of 2,4,6-triaryl-1,3,5-triazine and the bulky 1-naphthyl group is important to prevent crystallization and to form an amorphous film. As a result, 2,4,6-tris[4-(1-naphthyl)phenyl]-1,3,5-triazine possesses high electron drift mobility of 8.0 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 25 °C (3.8 × 105 V cm−1).19
Incorporation of an electron-donating diphenylamino (DPA) residue represents a common approach for designing luminophores. Zhang et al. described the synthesis and photophysical studies of 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives containing varying numbers of diphenylamino fragments.20 Thus, s-triazine 4, bearing the NPh2 residue only in one phenyl ring, was obtained via Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 2-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine with diphenylamine in 98% yield.21 Suzuki cross-coupling of 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine with 4-diphenylamino-phenylboronic acid22 or its pinacol ester20 afforded 4 in 84% and 80% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). An effective approach based on Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 3) was developed to prepare s-triazine 5, containing diphenylamino moieties in two phenyl rings.20,23,24 2,4,6-Tris((4-diphenylamino)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine 6 can be obtained in two ways (Scheme 3): (1) via direct cyclotrimerization of 4-(diphenylamino)-benzonitrile in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as a catalyst (in 43% yield);23 (2) via Suzuki cross-coupling of cyanuric chloride with 4-diphenylaminophenylboronic acid24 or its pinacol ester20 (in 60% and 55% yields, respectively).

Star-shaped compound 6 exhibited strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and emission solvatochromism (Fig. 2a and b).11 This triazine demonstrated the ability to detect selectively picric acid in an aqueous medium in trace amounts (Fig. 2c and d) with a quenching constant of KSV 3.53 × 10−5 M−1 and detection limit of 0.37 nM.11

Zhang et al. compared the photophysical properties of compounds 4–6 and analysed the performance of the phosphorescent OLEDs based on them in detail.20 All the s-triazines exhibited fluorescence emission in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature as well as phosphorescence emission in toluene at 77 K. Moreover, they showed high fluorescence quantum yields in films (0.79–0.88) (Table 1). It was shown that the optical and electrical properties of donor–acceptor molecular systems 4–6 can be adjusted by varying the number of diphenylamino groups; several phosphorescent OLEDs were constructed based on s-triazines 4–6 to study their electroluminescent (EL) properties. The derivative 6 demonstrated the highest ET value (2.73 eV), and its unique photophysical properties allowed the authors to fabricate blue, green, and red PhOLEDs, as well as a high-performance white PhOLED. All the devices showed external quantum effects (EQEs) of more than 20%. These results indicated that the energy transfer between DPA and s-triazine units was efficient and the exciton confinement was effective.

Typical phosphorescent properties of emitters 4–6 are presented in Fig. 3 to confirm the effectiveness of energy transfer. It is noteworthy that the efficiency roll-offs of these blue, green, and red PhOLEDs were relatively small. High EQE values were recorded at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2. Excellent device performances were due to the ambipolar carrier transporting properties as well as suitable energy levels of all the studied compounds. The emitting layer of the white PhOLEDs employed three primary color structures to cover the whole visible spectrum sufficiently (Table 1). The maximum EQE, PE, and current efficiency (CE) of the optimized device reached 20.4%, 56.6 lm W−1, and 55.6 cd A−1, respectively, with a slight efficiency roll-off.20

Molecules including highly π-conjugated systems and stronger electron-donating groups compared with 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (TRZ) were designed to improve the OLED device performances. Thus, 2,4,6-triaryl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives, containing an electron-donating component such as triphenylamino (TPA) residue with additional substituents, were described.25,26 Chromophores 8a–c in which the bis-tBu-TPA moiety is located at the para or meta position in one phenyl substituent of triphenyltriazine (8a, 8b) or bound with TRZ through a propylene bridge (8c) were synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 4).25 Compounds 8a–c exhibited triplet energy values of ET = 2.5, 2.7 and 3.0 eV, bathochromic shift of fluorescence band upon the increase in solvent polarity, as well as phosphorescence at 77 K. Wang et al. observed the formation of charge transfer complexes (CTCs);25 both intra- and intermolecular charge transfer processes were considered to explain the formation of CTCs with all three molecules. para-Substituted derivative 8a was shown to be the most susceptible to CTC formation in both solution and thin films. As a result EQE in PhOLED was reduced despite the better balance between charge flows in the emitting layer. meta-Substituted molecule 8b demonstrated the highest EQE due to the compromise between balanced charge flows and CTC formation. The smallest CTC formation in the case of compound 8c was beneficial for placing most singlets and triplets due to its relatively high ET value. In addition, this triazine provided the best morphological stability of the desired glassy emitter layer, which in general is promising for fabrication of excellent PhOLEDs.

Star-shaped compounds 9, 10 (Fig. 5) of donor–π-acceptor (D–A) type, in which 1,3,5-triazine and dimethoxytriphenylamine moieties are bound through thienylene or phenylene spacer, were synthesized as hole transport materials (HTM) for perovskite solar cells.26 These compounds were prepared in ∼50% yield by means of Stille cross-coupling reaction of cyanuric chloride with (tributylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl or (tributylstannyl)phenyl derivatives of dimethoxytriphenylamine. Both molecules exhibited fluorescence emission in chlorobenzene at λem = 502 nm (9) and 558 nm (10). The corresponding HOMO levels of −5.04 eV (9) and −5.11 eV (10) were calculated according to CV values. Devices based on compounds 9, 10 were created, their characteristics were obtained and compared with those of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), representing the best HTM at that time. Although the photophysical properties of the two HTMs (9, 10) were similar, the photovoltaic performance was quite sensitive to the structural modification of the peripheral substituents. In particular, the compound 10-based device demonstrated Jsc = 19.14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V and ΦF = 0.61, affording PCE = 10.90%. Under similar conditions, the PV cells based on compound 9 and spiro-OMeTAD exhibited Jsc of 20.74 and 21.37 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 and 0.94 V, and ΦF of 0.66 and 0.67, as well as conversion efficiency of 12.51 and 13.45%, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Chemical structure of compounds 9–11. 
The perovskite-based cell containing 9 as HTM showed a photovoltaic performance close to the spiro-OMeTAD-based cell. In addition, this cell demonstrated good stability for 250 h.
Functionalized tris(aryl)triazine 11, in which triphenylamine is attached to the triazine core through meta-phenylene spacer, was synthesized as a possible candidate possessing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).6 2,4,6-Tris(3-bromophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine was subjected to the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with (4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)boronic acid; the obtained compound 11 exhibited fluorescence at λem = 458 nm and a quantum yield of 17.6% in toluene. Moreover, passing nitrogen through the solution (to suppress triplet states quenching by oxygen) led to a higher quantum yield value of 44.2%. The results show that 11 can emit more delayed fluorescence and is promising for future applications as a TADF material.6 To confirm the TADF behavior of 11, the prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out in toluene, and the lifetime values of 12.47 ns and 166 μs were determined. The time-resolved photoluminescence and phosphorescence spectra were recorded for compound 11 in solid films with 100 ms delay at 77 K, and the energy gap between the singlet and triplet states of 0.18 eV was evaluated.
Based on star-shaped compound 10 two dendrimers 12, 13 containing N-hexylcarbazole/tricarbazole moieties as peripheral dendrons were synthesized (Scheme 4).7
 Scheme 4  Synthesis routes of dendrimers 12, 13. Reagents and conditions: (i) BBr3, DCM, 0 °C, 24 h; (ii) RBr, CsCO3, DMF, 120 °C, 24 h. 
Dendrimers 12, 13 were prepared via demethylation of methoxy groups in compound 10 by using BBr3 and the subsequent O-alkylation with 9-(6-bromohexyl)-9H-carbazole/tricarbazole in 65 and 55% yields, respectively. Both dendrimers were compared with the starting compound 10. 1,3,5-Triazines 10, 12 and 13 demonstrated high thermal stability with Td = 437, 388, 427 °C, respectively. All three compounds exhibited bright yellow fluorescence with λem at 590–594 nm in dichloromethane, λem 541–553 nm in films and Φf values of 44 (10), 56 (11) and 71% (12).
For all the compounds 10, 12 and 13 quantum-chemical calculations and CV studies7 were carried out, and the corresponding HOMO, LUMO, S1, T1 and ΔEST energy values were estimated (Fig. 6a). It was demonstrated that the incorporation of an extra phenyl bridge to increase the distance between donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in the emission core of 10 represents a promising route to achieve both the small singlet–triplet energy splitting and enhanced PL quantum yields (PLQYs) simultaneously. Analysis of experimental data for the compounds 10, 12 and 13 showed that the introduction of non-conjugated aliphatic chains in the carbazole dendrons can not only maintain the small ΔEST and the core emission, but it can also enhance the PLQYs. Thus, the peripheral dendrons can efficiently encapsulate the core 10 to decrease the triplet–triplet annihilation. To confirm the TADF nature of compounds 10, 12 and 13, decay curves of the transient photoluminescence in pure films were obtained. The results showed double exponential decay with short and long lifetimes of 16 ns and 0.4 ms for 10, and long lifetimes of 0.5 ms and 0.8 ms for 12 and 13, respectively. Undoped OLEDs were created using dendrimers 12 and 13 as the radiating layer, and the parameters of non-doped solution-processed OLEDs were obtained. A schematic energy level diagram of the devices is shown in Fig. 6b.

The electroluminescent peaks of 12 and 13 were similar to that of 10 (550 nm and 546 nm, respectively), indicating that emissions occur due to the TADF event (Fig. 6c). The devices based on 12 and 13 exhibited quite low turn-on voltages at the luminance of 1 cd m−2 (Von 2.6 and 2.4 V). However, a yellow device based on 12 with emission centered at 546 nm showed a current efficiency of 39.0 cd A−1, a power efficiency of 40.8 lmW, an EQE of 11.8% and a maximum luminance up to 23.145 cd cm−2.
Meng et al. described 1,3,5-triazine derivatives 14–16, in which from one to three triphenylamine groups were attached to the 1,3,5-triazine core through arylethene spacer (Fig. 7).27 These fluorophores exhibited absorption at 418–430 nm in chloroform, and fluorescence with λem = 552–555 nm with Φf values of 47–49%. In addition, these molecules showed large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections and strong two-photon fluorescence (λmax = 576–578 nm). For the most representative tri-branched molecule 16, TPA cross-section was as large as 1.64 × 10−20 cm4 GW−1.

Fluorene derivatives as hole-transporting units were incorporated into the 1,3,5-triazine moiety as electron-transporting unit.5,28–33 9,9-Diphenyl- and 9,9-dimethyl-containing 1,3,5-triazines 17, 18 (Fig. 8) were presented as new bipolar host materials.28 These compounds were prepared in 66% and 45% yields via Suzuki reaction starting from 4,6-diphenyl-2-chloro-1,3,5-triazine and the corresponding fluorene-boronic acid pinacol ester under microwave irradiation. Derivatives 17, 18 showed fluorescence in diluted THF at λem = 382 nm (17) and 385 nm (18) and phosphorescence in 2-MeTHF at 77 K at 491 and 527 nm (17), 487 and 524 nm (18). The triplet energy values (ET), calculated from the highest energy phosphorescence peaks, were of 2.63 and 2.64 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Chemical structure of compounds 17, 18. 
Green phosphorescent OLED devices based on 17, 18 were fabricated, and these devices demonstrated the EQE values of 14.52 and 14.30%, respectively. Such improved performance of these devices is attributed to the balanced charge flux and exciton confinement within the emitting layers.
Zhong et al. synthesized and studied 9,9-diethylfluorene-substituted 1,3,5-triazines, in which the fluorenyl group is either directly attached to the s-triazine cycle (19), or separated from it by a phenylene bridge (20), or contains a terminal phenyl substituent (21) (Fig. 9).5,29 Compound 19 was directly prepared from cyanuric chloride and 9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl magnesium bromide through Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction.29 Compounds 20, 21 were obtained by the cyclotrimerization reaction of 4-(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)benzonitrile or 9,9-diethyl-7-phenyl-9H-fluorene-2-carbonitrile, respectively, in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in anhydrous CH2Cl2.5 Star-shaped molecules 19–21 exhibited an intensive blue photoluminescence, and the emission maxima were observed in solution in the following order: 19 (385 nm) < 21 (412 nm) < 20 (424 nm). In the solid state a slight red shift of the emission band was observed, and the emission maxima followed the order: 19 > 20 = 21, which indicates a partial π-stacking in all three compounds. However, the degree of π-stacking in 20 and 21 was lower than in 19.
 Fig. 9  Chemical structure of compounds 19–21. 
Electroluminescent devices with the configuration ITO/NPB/Alq/1,3,5-triazine/LiF/Al were fabricated based on these 1,3,5-triazines, and the performance was studied.5 The maximum luminance was less than in the control device Alq/Alq; however, maximum current efficiencies of the devices containing 19, 20 or 21 were remarkably improved from 3.1 cd A−1 for the reference device to 4.5, 4.0, and 4.9 cd A−1, respectively. These results indicate that the application of compounds 19–21 enables the devices to improve the balance between the hole and electron transporting.
Phosphorescent light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs) with the configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV/hole-blocking layer/LiF/Al were fabricated. The comparative device was based on poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV), and the maximum luminance of devices based on 19, 20 and 21 was promoted from 1358 cd m−2 to 2683, 2327, and 2871 cd m−2, respectively. Furthermore, devices 19, 20 and 21 showed maximum current efficiencies of 0.97, 0.97, and 1.37 cd A−1, respectively, which were more than four times higher than 0.25 cd A−1 of the MEH-PPV-based device. These results suggest that the abovementioned s-triazine derivatives possess excellent hole-blocking capacity.
New 1,3,5-triazine chromophores 23a–c, containing 9,9-dialkylfluorenyl fragment with terminal diphenylamino group, were synthesized by the routes shown in Scheme 5.30 Thus, the lithiation of (7-bromo-9,9-dialkylfluoren-2-yl)diphenylamine and the subsequent interaction with cyanuric fluoride led to s-triazines 23a–c in 51–60% yields. Compounds 23a and 23c were obtained as crystalline substances, while derivative 23b as a mixture of stereoisomers was isolated as an oil, which converted to a glassy solid during storage. Derivatives 23 exhibit absorption at 410–415 nm in THF solutions and fluorescence at λem = 500–518 nm with quantum yields of 47–48%. Chromophores 23 showed a two-photon absorption (TPA) property. Derivative 23a demonstrated the largest TPA cross-section value (39500 GM), as determined by the nonlinear transmission method in the nanosecond scale at 800 nm.

The combination of an electron-deficient 1,3,5-triazine core and three fluorene arms, substituted with diarylamino or carbazolyl electron donors was demonstrated.31 Star-shaped fluorophores 24a–d (Fig. 10a), exhibiting electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL), were synthesized by means of trimerization of 7-brom-2-cyano-9,9-diethylfluorene and the subsequent Pd-catalyzed amination of tribromo-substituted fluorenyl-s-triazines under the action of diarylamines or carbazoles.

Derivatives 24a–c demonstrated absorption maximum in a visible region at λabs = 418 nm, whereas 24d absorbed at 370 nm. These compounds exhibited intensive photoluminescence with λem = 562–565 nm (24a–c) and λem = 505 nm (24d) with Φf values of 81–85% (for 24a–c) and 70% (for 24d). In organic solvents these derivatives demonstrated strong fluorosolvatochromism. Thus, the emission band for compound 24b underwent a red shift from 428 nm in hexane to 575 nm in DMF. Cyclic voltammetry studies of derivatives 24a–c showed that the reduction occurred as single-wave one-electron transfer, while the oxidation showed one peak of three successive one-electron transfer processes to afford a trication. The carbazole-containing derivative 24d underwent a subsequent rapid chemical reaction to form a dimer after oxidation.
Chromophores 24а-с proved to be good candidates for ECL generation due to their high PL quantum yields and stable ion-radical species; light was produced during annihilation between the cation radical and the anion radical. In addition, these compounds generated a strong CL observed with the naked eye. The maximum in the ECL spectrum appeared at 574–575 nm and was red-shifted relative to PL by 10–13 nm (for example, Fig. 10b). For the ECL chromophores 24a–c up to 50% quantum yields were measured. In contrast, derivative 24d exhibited only weak ECL, but in the case of using benzoyl peroxide as a co-reactant, strong ECL was observed.
Kukhta et al. studied the influence of the linker type between 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine and fluorenyl fragments in derivatives 25а–с on the properties.32s-Triazine 25а was obtained by means of the electrophilic cyclization of the aromatic precursor 26 (Scheme 6), and the chromophore units in the compound 25а were connected via single C–C bonds. Derivative 25b with 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine and dialkylfluorene moieties attached via the ethynyl-containing linkers was obtained by means of Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between the iodo-derivative and 9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2-ethynyl-9H-fluorene 27 (Scheme 6). Compound 25с with 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine and dialkylfluorene moieties attached via the ethenyl-containing linker was prepared by the Wittig–Horner reaction of ylide 28 and 9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-fluorene-2-carbaldehyde (Scheme 6). All three compounds possessed high thermal stability with onset temperatures of thermal degradation around 400 °C and glass formation ability with close glass transition temperatures (56–61 °C).
 Scheme 6  Synthetic routes of triazines 25a–c. Reagents and conditions: (i) CF3SO3H, CHCl3; (ii) tris-2,4,6-(iodophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, PPh3, CuI, iPrA; (iii) 9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-fluorene-2-carbaldehyde, iBuONf, THF. 
Compounds 25a–c exhibited strong fluorescence in THF solutions at λem = 425–469 nm with Φf values of 50–70%, and among them the derivative 25b demonstrated the highest quantum yield. In the film the emission band underwent blue-shift of 8 nm for derivatives 25a,b and red-shift of 14 nm for 25c. The compound with 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine and 2-[9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-fluorene] moieties bound through ethenyl-containing linker exhibited the best charge-transporting properties; the hole mobility of the amorphous layer reached 1.9 × 10−3 cm V−1 s at an electric field of 1.15 × 106 V cm−1.
Wang et al. investigated the impact of the mutual arrangement of s-triazine (T), spirofluorene (F) and triphenylamine (T) units in star-shaped D–π-A molecules 29–31 (p-TFT (29), mp-TFT (30), m-TFT (31), Fig. 11) on the color adjustment from dark blue to green.33 The synthesis of compounds 29–31 was carried out starting from bromo derivatives 33a,b (Scheme 7).
 Fig. 11  Chemical structure of compounds 29–31. 
 Scheme 7  Synthetic routes of triazines 29–31. Reagents and conditions: (i) 2 M K2CO3, Pd(PPh3)4, THF, 85 °C, 24 h. 
Compounds 29–31 exhibited fluorescence both in organic solutions and in neat films. In dichloromethane solutions their emission spectra were substantially different (Fig. 12a), while in the film the spectra were quite similar (Fig. 12b). The observed quantum yields values of compounds 29, 30, 31 in dichloromethane were 27, 15 and 11%, respectively. It should be noted that the ratio of high-energy emission bands (454 nm and 474 nm) and low-energy emission bands (627 nm and 629 nm) in the spectra of compounds 29, 30 varied depending on the nature of the solvent from dichloromethane to toluene, which confirms their pronounced emission solvatochromism. All the compounds exhibited strong phosphorescence in toluene at 77 K. For compounds 29, 30 and 31 the triplet energy values evaluated from the onset of the phosphorescent spectra were 2.41 eV (29), 2.46 eV (30) and 2.58 eV (31), respectively.

Devices based on compounds 29–31 as dopants were fabricated by means of a solution-processed approach, and their electroluminescent characteristics were measured. Electroluminescence (EL) spectra and chromaticity coordinates are shown in Fig. 13.

Thus, the maximum CE and EQE of the OLED based on 29 are 6.2 cd A−1 and 2.3%, respectively. The EQE of the device based on 29 was 2 times and 4 times higher than EQE of 30- and 31-based devices, respectively. Wang et al. concluded that isomers 29–31 can exhibit tunable emission colors from deep blue to green in solution owing to a different degree of their π-conjugation.33
A series of star-shaped oligomers 34a–c containing 1,3,5-triazine core and one to three 9,9-dioctylfluorene bridges between triphenylamine and the s-triazine cycle (Fig. 14) was synthesized and studied.4 The synthesis of compound 34a was carried out by means of trimerization of 7-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2-carbonitrile. Similarly, oligomers 34b,c were obtained from carbonitriles with two or three fluorenyl groups.
 Fig. 14  Chemical structure of compounds 34a–c. 
Oligomers 34a–c were thermally stable with decomposition temperature 433–439 °C. Upon single-photon excitation these oligomers exhibited an intense fluorescence both in solutions and films. In addition, oligomer 34a showed well-pronounced fluorosolvatochromism. Thus, the change of solvent from cyclohexane to DMF results in the bathochromic shift of the emission maximum from 435 nm to 574 nm (Δλ = 139 nm). For oligomers 34b,c the influence of the solvent polarity on their photophysical properties was significantly lower, and the observed Δλ were of 24 nm (34b) and 29 nm (34c). The observed quantum yields in toluene for oligomers were 83% (34a), 93% (34b) and 99% (34b). The nonlinear refractive index and two-photon absorption properties of the oligomers were measured using Z-scan methods. Compound 34а showed a high nonlinear refractive index of 4.14 × 10−12 esu in THF solution with an excitation wavelength of 800 nm, and exhibited a large two-photon absorption cross-section of 234 GM. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) spectra of oligomers 34а–с were recorded in THF solution at room temperature (Fig. 15). Upon the laser pulse excitation at 800 nm with a pulse width of 140 fs, all oligomers exhibited extensive frequency up-converted fluorescence with the maximum TPEF wavelength (λmaxTPEF) at 527 nm for 34a, 514 nm for 34b, and 470 nm for 34c. Ren et al. demonstrated the linear dependence of the peak fluorescence intensity on the square of the input laser intensity power, which indicates the occurrence of two-photon absorption (TPA).4 Derivative 34a showed the strongest nonlinear TPA ability.

OLED devices were constructed by using spin-coated films of oligomers 34а–с as an active layer, and they showed intensive blue electroluminescence with a maximum luminance up to 3093 cd m−2 at a current efficiency of 1.47 cd A−1 (in the case of 34a as the emitting material).
Along with triphenylamine and fluorene, carbazole is widely used as donor component in s-triazine-based push–pull systems. Su et al. described 2,4,6-triphenyltriazine derivative 35 containing three carbazole substituents as host material for PhOLEDs (Fig. 16a).34 The compound was prepared by Pd-catalyzed amination of tribromo-substituted triphenyltriazine with carbazole. Derivative 35 demonstrated fluorescence in the film with λem = 467 nm. The values of ES = 2.66 eV, ET = 2.52 eV and ΔEST = 0.14 eV were determined from the photoluminescence spectra recorded at 4.2 K. The compound was characterized by HOMO energy levels of 6.18 eV and LUMO of 3.23 eV (Fig. 16b). It showed a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 162 °C and a melting point of 323 °C.

Su et al. studied the interactions between 35 and several triplet emitters based on Ir(III) complexes both in photo- and electroluminescence processes. During transient PL measurement of Ir(PPy)3:35 films a shoulder at 565 nm was observed with a lifetime of about two times longer than that of Ir(PPy)3 triplet excitons. According the authors, this observation can be attributed to the triplet exciplex formed between Ir(PPy)3 and 35.34 A multi-emitting-layer white OLED was fabricated by applying FIrpic and tris(1-phenylisoquinolinolato-C2,N)iridium(III) (Ir(piq)3) as the complementary triplet emitters and 35 as the host.
In the carbazol-3-yl derivative 36, obtained by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, the carbazole moiety is bound to 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine by another way than in carbazol-9-yl triazine derivative 35 (Fig. 16a).6 As a result, fluorophore 36 demonstrated shorter-wavelength fluorescence in solutions of λem = 407 nm (in hexane) and 503 nm (in DMF). According to the results of phosphorescence measurements at 77 K, this fluorophore possesses TADF properties, and the value of ΔEST = 0.24 eV was obtained.
Matulaitis et al. presented the synthesis and studies of star-shaped derivatives 37a,b, in which the di-tert-butylcarbazole moiety (D) is attached to the s-triazine cycle (A) through para- (37a) or meta-phenylene (37b) bridges (Fig. 16a).35,36 Both compounds were prepared by the reaction of 2,4,6-tris(m- or p-iodophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine with 3,6-di-tert-buthylcarbazole in o-dichlorobenzene in the presence of K2CO3 and Cu. Derivative 37a proved to be more thermally stable (Td exceeded 514 °C), for 37bTd = 447 °C.
Comparison of the experimental and calculated absorption spectra showed that the first electron transitions of compounds 37a,b coincide with maxima of the lowest energy bands in experimental spectra of solid solutions in Zeonex. para-Conjugation in derivative 37a is responsible for a significantly higher oscillator strength (0.73) of the first transition compared with meta-derivative 37b (0.008). Both derivatives exhibited fluorescence in solutions and phosphorescence at 77 K. Matulaitis et al. investigated the influence of donor fragments on the TADF properties of chromophores 37a,b. Thus, compound 37a exhibited higher fluorescence quantum yield in the film (33%) compared with 37b (5%). To evaluate the contribution of delayed fluorescence, the PLQYs of the evaporated layers were measured in ambient and degassed atmospheres. As a result, the 5 times increase of the PLQY for 37b (from 5 to 25%) was observed compared with 37a (from 33 to 35%), which indicates the more prominent contribution of the delayed component to total emission in the case of 37b. Thus, the meta-linkage results in a stronger charge transfer as well as higher triplet energy, and, most probably, this last is due to the partial loss of the π-conjugation. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were conducted, and it was shown that the decay transients of both compounds dispersed in PMMA exhibited a fast prompt and a slower delayed fluorescence component. Experiments at different temperatures revealed that while the prompt fluorescence is more intense for 37a, TADF is more prominent and is observed at lower temperatures for 37b. Finally, a blue OLED with EQE value up to 9.5% was fabricated from 37b; its emission originated mostly from TADF.
In addition, the fluorescence properties of compounds 37a and 38 bearing a different number of tert-butyl groups in the carbazole moiety were compared.36 Both derivatives exhibited intense fluorescence in hexane with λem = 398 nm, Φf = 83% (38) and λem = 407 nm, Φf = 76% (37a), while in films the quantum yield decreased to 29–33%. The compounds were characterized by a pronounced positive fluorosolvatochromism with a red-shift of emission band maxima of 36–182 nm upon the increase of the solvent polarity, and, thus, the solution colour could be adjusted from blue to yellow. The PL decays of the dilute solutions of the compounds were described by single-exponential fits, whereas fluorescence decays in neat films were described by biexponential fits. The emission of 38 in film had dominant τ = 1.05 ns (67%) and exhibited fluorescence of long-lived excited state species with τ = 4.70 ns. For the neat film of 37a short-lived (τ = 1.29 ns) and long-lived (τ = 5.27 ns) excited state species were observed. The hole drift mobility of compounds had the magnitude of 2.5 × 10−3 (38) and 7.5 × 10−3 (37a) cm2 V−1 s−1 at high electric fields. The selected compounds were tested as light-emitting materials in host–guest OLED systems. The brightness maxima of 1342 (38) and 1221 (37a) cd m−2 were observed at 18 V for devices, with the maxima of current efficiency in the range of 0.1–0.55 cd A−1.
Liu et al. described multifunctional fluorophores 39–41 (Fig. 17), in which the N-phenylcarbazole unit is attached by its various positions to the diphenyl-s-triazine core through an anthracene linker.37 The compounds were prepared by Suzuki cross-coupling between (bromanthracenyl)diphenyltriazine and the corresponding carbazole boronic acid.
 Fig. 17  Chemical structure of compounds 39–41. 
In dichloromethane solutions compounds 39–41 demonstrated fluorescence with λem = 534–582 nm with low Φf of 2–8%, while in films a blue shift of the emission band to λem = 492–516 nm along with a significant increase in Φf to 45–47% were observed.37 The fluorescence studies in various THF–water mixtures showed that the increasing of water fractions to 90 vol% led to a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 18a), which confirms aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behaviour for 39–41. Most probably, upon photoexcitation the transition from the ground to the excited state occurs, and the dihedral angle between the anthracene fragment and the conjugated aromatic system decreases. Due to the twisted conformation, intermolecular interactions are weakened, and no concentration quenching was observed; radiation-free transition from excited state was blocked due to the formation of aggregates.

For all the s-triazines 39–41 a reversible piezofluorochromism (PFC) was observed: the samples emitted blue light in a pristine state, and yellow or yellow-green light after rubbing (Fig. 18b and c). s-Triazine derivative 39 possessed a freer molecular package, with weak intermolecular CH–π-interactions and twisted conformation, and this compound demonstrated the largest shift of ΔλPFC = 66 nm. s-Triazines 39–41 were used as emitters in undoped blue devices with λEL at 475–488 nm. The devices rendered the maximum CE, PE, and EQE values of 13.34 cd A−1, 11.59 lm W−1, 5.44%; 11.19 cd A−1, 9.25 lm W−1, 5.54% and 8.74 cd A−1, 6.44 lm W−1, 4.71% for 39, 40 and 41 respectively.
An important approach to improve the applicability of s-triazine derivatives as carrier transport materials for PhOLEDs was demonstrated for the compounds 42a,b (Fig. 19a). Introducing a methyl substituent into the phenylene spacer between 9-phenylcarbazole and diphenyltriazine residues resulted in distortion of the molecular structure, decrease of the conjugation degree and increase in the triplet energy of the carrier material.38 Compounds 42 were synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyltriazine and the corresponding carbazole-boronic acid. Frontier molecular orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) were calculated (Fig. 19b), and the triplet state energy values of 2.86 eV (for 42a) and 3.05 eV (for 42b) were determined. Derivative 42b exhibited fluorescence at λem = 415 nm in solution at room temperature and λem = 445 nm at low temperature, and triplet energy of 2.79 eV was determined. The OLED device was fabricated based on compound 42b, and after the optimization of the structure of the device the maximum quantum efficiency of 16.4%, current efficiency of 32 cd A−1, and a power efficiency of 21.5 lm W−1 were achieved.

Park et al. reported the targeted synthesis of s-triazine derivatives 43, 44 (Fig. 19a) containing a benzocarbazole moiety as a hole conductive unit, attached to diphenyl-s-triazine core as an electron conductive unit through meta- or para-phenylene spacer. Compounds 43, 44 were synthesized by Pd-catalysed amination reaction between monobrominated triphenyl-s-triazine and benzocarbazole, and thus obtained products exhibited excellent thermal stability (Td > 400 °C).39 Both compounds exhibited blue fluorescence in solutions (λem = 447 nm for 43 and 431 nm for 44 in THF) and phosphorescence with a triplet energy value of 2.52 eV, as well as promising ambient carrier transport properties.
Park et al. fabricated red phosphorescence OLEDs based on s-triazines 43 or 44 as active layers doped with iridium complex. Better performance was observed for the device based on 44 compared with the 43-based device: EQE values were 24.8% vs. 23.7% and phosphorescence lifetime values were 1.16 μs vs. 0.84 μs.
Braveenth et al. reported triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives 45, 46 (Fig. 20) containing dibenzocarbazole moiety as a carrier material for high-luminescence green and yellow PhOLEDs.40 The target compounds were prepared via Pd-catalysed amination reaction between monobrominated triphenyltriazine and dibenzocarbazole. The obtained compounds exhibited good thermal stability (Td = 437 and 448 °C for 45 and 46, respectively), intensive fluorescence in toluene (λem = 458 nm (45) and 453 nm (46)) and low-temperature phosphorescence (at 77 K) with calculated triplet energy values of 2.58 and 2.71 eV, respectively. In addition, these compounds exhibited positive fluorosolvatochromism with emission band shift of 74–77 nm.
 Fig. 20  Chemical structure of compounds 45–47. 
Yellow PhOLEDs, fabricated on the basis of compounds 45 or 46 as emitting layer with addition of bis[2-(2-pyridinyl-N)phenyl-C](acetylacetonato)iridium(III) (Ir(tptpy)2(acac)), exhibited stable emission at λmax = 561 nm, excellent current efficiency of 71.4 cd A−1, and the external quantum efficiency of 25.4% (45) and 22.4% (46). Due to the higher triplet energy of 2.71 eV the compound 46 was successfully used as host material for green PhOLED, and the fabricated green phosphorescent OLED exhibited excellent current efficiency of 75.9 cd A−1 and excellent quantum efficiency of 24.7%.
Triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivative 47 containing 12,12-dimethyl-11,12-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]carbazole was prepared and investigated as a host material for green PhOLEDs.41 The compound possessed high thermal stability and high glass transition temperature, good hole and electron transport properties, and exhibited intense fluorescence in solutions with a pronounced solvatochromism. Low-temperature phosphorescence at 77 K with triplet energy value of 2.79 eV along with small singlet–triplet energy gap (0.18 eV), which is beneficial for the efficient reverse intersystem crossing from triplet to singlet, were observed.
For the OLED device fabricated with compound 47 as the host and three green phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes as emitters, the electrophosphorescent properties were investigated. The green PhOLED based on 5 wt% bis(4-methyl-2,5-diphenylpyridine)Ir(III) acetylacetonate [(mdppy)2Iracac] exhibited the best performance, such as high PE of 92.3 lm W−1, high EQE of 23.6%, current efficiency roll-off as low as 5.5% at 5000 cd m−2.
Triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivative 50, containing phenanthrene and carbazole moieties, was synthesized via Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 8).42 The compound exhibited good thermal stability (Td = 423 °C), green fluorescence in dichloromethane solution with λmax = 490 nm and low-temperature phosphorescence at 77 K with triplet energy value of 2.42 eV. In addition, positive solvatochromism was confirmed: the increase in the solvent polarity in a row from hexane to dichloromethane resulted in the redshift of the emission band by 50 nm. Based on derivative 50 as host material and Ir(ppy)3 as emitter the PhOLED device, exhibiting typical green electroluminescence at 512 nm and EQE of 9.9%, was fabricated. For the red PhOLED device prepared with the same carrier material and another emitter (Ir(pq)2acac), an electroluminescence with a maximum at 600 nm and higher EQE (14.1%) were observed. Both devices demonstrated low-efficiency roll-off.

Lv et al. presented a series of highly twisted 4,6-diphenyl-s-triazine derivatives 51–53 (Fig. 21) containing one indolinospirobifluorene donor in the ortho position.8 The compounds were prepared via Ullmann reaction from 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-s-triazine and the corresponding indolinospirobifluorene. It should be noted that in these structures spirobifluorene could be attached to the indoline moiety via various positions, such as 1,2 (51), 2,3 (52) and 3,4 (53) to influence the degree of steric hindrance and conjugation, which dominate in the excited state levels (singlet and triplet). Due to such geometry the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in these molecules proceeds as simultaneous charge transfer via coupling (TBCT) and charge transfer via space (TSCT). To estimate the TSCT/TBCT ratio contributed to the S1 states DFT calculations were performed, which revealed the value that TSCT/TBCT ratio contributed to the S1 states as 96.8%/3.2% (53), 79.4%/20.6% (52), and 68.0%/32.0% (51). The values of ΔESTs between S1 and T1 states were estimated as 0.08 eV (51), 0.09 eV (52) and 0.22 eV (53). In toluene solutions all the compounds exhibited green fluorescence with λem of 479–491 nm, and the absolute quantum yields in films were estimated as 92% (51), 86% (52) and 65% (53). All the compounds exhibited low-temperature phosphorescence at 77 K. In addition, derivatives 51 and 52 showed dual emissions with LE (local excited) and CT (charge transfer) features in different solvents, whereas 53 possessed single emission from TSCT (96.8%) that contributed to the S1 state. The transient photoluminescence decays of 51–53 in polymer matrix were measured, and the prompt fluorescence lifetimes (τp) were estimated as 2.5, 8.3, and 15.6 ns, and the delayed lifetimes (τd) were estimated as 4.6, 4.3, and 8.2 μs for 51–53, respectively. In addition, for all three derivatives TADF properties were observed. As a final step, OLED devices based on the compounds 51, 52 as emitter layers were fabricated, and EQE values of 22.4% and 19.6%, respectively, were determined.
 Fig. 21  Chemical structure of compounds 51–53. 
In reported dendrimeric star-shaped compounds 54, 5536,43 (Fig. 22) the carbazole or bicarbazole moiety was attached to triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine via ethynyl moiety as a rigid linker. Both compounds were obtained by Pd-catalyzed Hagihara–Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction from 2,4,6-tris(p-iodophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and the corresponding ethynylcarbazole. Dendrimer 54 was thermally stable (Td = 467 °C); it exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 400 nm in hexane solution with Φf = 82%, green fluorescence with λem = 514 nm in film with Φf = 20%, as well as hole conductivity 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ET value of 2.38 eV. This compound was further tested as light-emitting material in an OLED device, which showed ELmax = 515 nm, brightness maxima of 1221 cd m−2 at 18 V along with the maxima of current efficiency of 0.46 cd A−1.
 Fig. 22  Chemical structure of compounds 54, 55. 
For the derivative 55 bearing bicarbazole groups the characteristics were similar to those of compound 54. Thus, compound 55 exhibited higher thermal stability (Td = 472 °C), red-shifted fluorescence in hexane (λem = 429 nm) with Φf = 78%, similar fluorescence in film with λem = 513 nm and Φf = 22%, similar ET value of 2.37 eV, and lower hole conductivity (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Unfortunately, the OLED devices based on the derivative 55 were not described.43
Zeng et al. described non-conjugated triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives 56 and 57, in which the electron donor bicarbazole moiety was attached to the s-triazine core through a flexible aliphatic linker (Fig. 23).44 These compounds were obtained via Pd-catalysed cross-coupling reaction between 2,4,6-tris(p-bromophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and p-bromophenylbutyl-substituted bicarbazole. Thermal, morphological, electrochemical, fluorescence, and phosphorescence properties of the compounds were studied. The advantages of this type of material include easier solution processing into amorphous (more soluble) films with elevated glass transition temperatures, stability against phase separation and crystallization. The decomposition temperatures at a weight loss of 5% were estimated as 399 and 403 °C for 56 and 57, respectively. The obtained products exhibited blue-to-green fluorescence in films with emission maxima at 450–550 nm and low-temperature phosphorescence at 77 K with triplet energy values of 3.03 eV (56) and 2.75 eV (57). The energies of HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated as −5.8 eV (for 56) and −2.6 eV (for 57). Both compounds were used as carrier materials of the emitting layer, doped with green-emitting tris(2-(p-methylphenyl)pyridine)iridium, Ir(mppy)3 to fabricate bilayer PhOLEDs. These devices demonstrated green electroluminescence with a noticeable decrease in control voltage upon an increase in the fraction of s-triazine fragment in the molecule. For the device based on triazine 57 the current efficiency reached a maximum of 32 cd A−1.
 Fig. 23  Chemical structure of compounds 56, 57. 
1,3,5-Triazine-triphenylsilyl derivatives were described as materials for phosphorescent OLEDs.45–47 Compound 58 (Fig. 24) with triphenylsilyl residue bound to the s-triazine unit through biphenyl spacer demonstrated both hole and exciton-blocking properties.45 Synthesis of compound 58 was carried out by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction between triphenylsilylphenyl-boronic acid and 2-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine.45
 Fig. 24  Chemical structure of compounds 58, 59. 
According to the CV data of 58, its HOMO energy level was quite low (6.5 eV), while the electronic mobility was estimated as 5.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an applied field of 1.0 MV cm−1. Fluorescence spectra in dichloromethane and film at room temperature, as well as phosphorescence spectra at 12 K were recorded. In the film of compound 58 two emission peaks were observed, namely the most intense peak at 400 nm, which was red-shifted by 40 nm compared with emission in solution, and an extra emission peak at 550 nm, which was not observed in the solution. The triplet energy value of compound 58, estimated from the phosphorescence peak, was 2.44 eV, and the observed results indicated that compound 58 could serve as a hole-blocking material. The phosphorescent OLEDs fabricated using 58 as the hole- and exciton-blocking layer showed very high efficiency. A maximum EQE reached 17.5% with a maximum power efficiency of 47.8 lm W−1.
Jung et al. developed an electroplex material as a mixture of hole-transport and electron-transport types of compounds, with high radiation energy for application in high-efficiency pure blue PhOLEDs with long service period.46 In this material compound 59 (Fig. 24), bearing triphenylsilyl blocking group and carbazole substituent in s-triazine core served as electron carrier, while 3,3-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (mCBP) was used as the hole-transport material. Trisubstituted s-triazine 59 was synthesized by reaction of 2-phenyl-4,6-dichlorotriazine with bromine-substituted tetraphenylsilane and subsequent substitution of chlorine atom with carbazole moiety. Compound 59 exhibited photoluminescence with emission band at 400–470 nm in solution and in film, as well as low-temperature phosphorescence at 77 K (Fig. 25a). The estimated values of the singlet energy (3.23 eV) and triplet (3.10 eV) energy were high enough to transfer energy to pure blue fluorophore with triplet energy of ∼2.80 eV. A device based on m-CBP:59 mixture (50:50%) as a host material, doped with pure blue-emitting Ir(cb)3 was fabricated, and its characteristics were measured. The electroplex formation in the mixed material was identified based on the red shift in device electroluminescence (EL) spectra in the case of mixed material as the emitting layer (Fig. 25b).

The achieved maximum characteristics of this device were as follows: external quantum efficiency of 27.6%, the device life more than 10000 hours at 100 cd m2, and pure blue coordinates of (0.12, 0.13). Jung et al.46 demonstrated that an electroplex host can be the best host for high EQE and long lifetime in pure blue PhOLEDs.
Oner et al. presented a series of bipolar chromophores 60a–c (Fig. 26) with an increasing number of electron donor carbazole groups (D) attached to electron-acceptor s-triazine (A).47 The tetraphenylsilane moiety was introduced to the molecule in order to interrupt the π-conjugation between D and A and to provide a large band gap and high triplet energy. Compound 60a was synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between {4-[[4-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole-9-yl)phenyl](diphenyl)silyl]phenyl}boronic acid and 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine. Derivatives 60b and 60c were prepared by using Stille coupling reactions. All compounds exhibited blue fluorescence in toluene solutions with λem 429, 440 and 430 nm and Φf 47.2, 75.7 and 59.4% for compounds 60a, 60b and 60c, respectively. In addition, strong fluorescence was observed in films of 60a–c, and for the films dropcast from toluene solutions a higher fluorescence intensity was observed compared with those obtained from chloroform. However, the observed quantum yields, such as 8.2% (60a), 36.4% (60b) and 9.7% (60c), were significantly lower compared with those measured in solutions.
 Fig. 26  Chemical structure of compounds 60a–c. 
For all the compounds 60a–c high triplet energy values (>2.9 eV) were observed. To control the balance of charges in the molecules, OLED devices based on 60a and 60c were prepared, and it was shown that the hole conductivity increased with an increase in the number of carbazole groups, while the electron conductivity decreased. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that derivative 60b possessed the weakest intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), while the luminescence quantum yield and charge balance were the highest ones.
Recently Cai et al. presented narrow-band TADF materials with emission maximum of more than 560 nm, based on the targeted design of frontal molecular orbitals.48,49 A multiplet-resonance (MR) skeleton with attached electron donor and acceptor was applied; as a result, significant redshift in the emission of target molecules was achieved. 4,6-Diaryl-s-triazine derivatives 62a–c were synthesized based on the core of 61a whereas compounds 62d,e were formed from 61b (Scheme 9). The application of skeleton 63 allowed 4,6-diphenyl-s-triazine derivative 64 (Scheme 10) to be obtained. The desired products 62a–e and 64 were obtained in two stages: the synthesis of pinacol esters of skeletons 61a,b or 63 and the subsequent Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling with 2-chloro-4,6-diaryl-s-triazine (62a–d, 64) or 2-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-s-triazine (62e) (Schemes 9 and 10). The incorporation of alkoxy-aryl groups into the s-triazine core of derivatives 62b,c significantly improved the solubility of these compounds.

 Scheme 10  Synthetic route to triazine 64. Reagents and conditions: (i) dtbpy, Ir(COD)(OMe)2, B2pin, THF; (ii) 2-Cl-4,6-diphenyltriazine, K2CO3, Pd(PPh3)4, THF, H2O. 
Quantum-chemical calculations showed that the introduction of the 1,3,5-triazine cycle into the para-position of β-substituted phenyl ring in the derivatives 62a–c, 64 led to electron density dispersion, inhibition of the condensed and localized LUMO population, thereby an increase in ICT power and generation of red-shifted radiation. Di(t-butylphenyl)amino derivatives 62a–c and 64 exhibited bright orange fluorescence (λmax at 618–629 for 62a–c and 624 nm for 64) with narrow bands in toluene solutions (Fig. 27) with absolute fluorescence quantum yields of 94–95%. Some other photophysical properties were as follows: optical gap value 1.98–2.01 eV, energy level values ES1 = 2.15–2.25 eV, ET1 = 2.08–2.20 eV and ΔEST = 0.05–0.09 eV.48t-Butyl carbazolyl derivatives 62d,e demonstrated perfect green fluorescence (λem 501–521 nm, Φf 94–97%, ΔEST = 0.11–0.18 eV); 62e-based OLED possessed pure green emission with CIE coordinates of (0.23, 0.68), a remarkable maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6%, and relatively low efficiency roll-off.49

The presence of a rigid skeleton structure contributes to a slight structural relaxation of the excited state, prompting a small Stokes shift (43–49 nm) and a small half-width of the emission bands (45–47 nm). Notably, the starting compound 61a emitted at λem = 566 nm, whereas a red-shift to λem = 629 nm was observed for s-triazine derivative 62a (Fig. 27).
The decay profiles of the transition photoluminescence of the films doped with derivatives 62a–c and 64 were studied; biexponential decays, consisting of a rapid fluorescence component with a lifetime in the nanosecond mode and a delayed fluorescence component with microsecond-scale lifetime, were observed. The delay component demonstrated that triplet excitons can be up-converted via S1 → S0 transitions, which indicates a typical TADF characteristic. Cai et al.48,49 concluded that these properties of MR-TADF materials have great advantages for obtaining highly efficient OLED displays with ideal colour purity.
Geng et al. presented organic emitters 65–67 (Fig. 28) of D–σ-A type, in which the σ group allows control of intramolecular distance to some extent.22 Compounds consist of s-triazine acceptor, and dihydroacridine and tetramethylcarbazole or triphenylamine as donors, while hexafluoroisopropylidene was used as a σ-bridge. DFT calculations were carried out, and three-dimensional geometry and FMO energy levels were evaluated. According to the single-crystal X-ray analysis data, derivatives 65 and 67 possessed twisted configuration.
 Fig. 28  Chemical structure of compounds 65–67. 
Сompounds 65–67 exhibited bright photoluminescence in toluene solutions with wide and structureless emission bands, indicating that the nature of emitting excited states S1 was ICT, and low-temperature phosphorescence was observed in the toluene matrix at 77 K. The emission maxima of derivatives 66, 67 exhibited blue shifts compared with that of 65 because of their lower electron donor capability. The values ΔEST of 0.06, 0.07 and 0.18 eV for the compounds 65, 66 and 67, respectively, were elucidated from spectral data. Quantum yields (PLQY) below 10% were observed for all three molecules in toluene solutions before degassing, with a lowest value of 1.6% for compounds 65 and 66. At the same time in oxygen-free toluene the PLQY values were dramatically increased, reaching 70, 36, and 20% for 65–67, respectively, which is a common observation for TADF molecules. In the profiles of transitional PL decay of compounds 65 and 66 in oxygen-free toluene three decay components with different times were revealed (Fig. 29). Two TADF components were identified: one with a very short lifetime of 200–400 ns and another one with a longer TADF lifetime of microseconds order.

Geng et al.22 concluded that due to the weakly bound state of intramolecular charge transfer in the structure D–A, the transition from the localized excited triplet state (3LE) and the triplet charge transfer state (3CT) to the singlet charge transfer state (1CT) occurred with small activation energy and high quantum photoluminescence efficiency. Despite the weakly bound intramolecular charge transfer state, these materials achieved high PLQY values due to their rigid molecular structures. The authors suggested the most probable double TADF mechanism.
2,4,6-Triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine derivatives 68–70 (Fig. 30) with various electron donor fragments on the periphery were synthesized by means of Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction.50
 Fig. 30  Chemical structure of compounds 68–70. 
The obtained compounds form molecular glasses with glass transition temperatures in the range of 148–235 °C. s-Triazines were thermally stable, Td exceeded 390 °C. Fluorenyl and carbazolyl derivatives exhibited intense blue fluorescence in THF solution with λem = 424 nm and Φf = 76% for 68, λem = 470 nm and Φf = 73% for 69. In the polymer matrix they underwent a hypsochromic shift of the emission band to 415 nm (68) and to 419 nm (69) but maintained high (74% for 68) or slightly increased (82% for 69) quantum yields. In the THF solution phenothiazinyl derivative 70 emitted in the red region with λem = 624 nm and smaller quantum yield of 25%, while in the polymer matrix it emitted green fluorescence with λem = 511 nm and higher Φf = 50%. This derivative exhibited pronounced fluorosolvatochromism in solutions. Photophysical studies of compound 70 in media of varying rigidity and polarity showed the twisted ICT nature, and films of compounds 68–70 exhibited significant fluorescence quenching. Electrochemical study of derivatives 68–70 showed that the nature of the donor fragment can significantly affect their redox properties. Investigation by cyclic voltammetry revealed that the synthesized compounds 68–70 can be used as monomers to high dimensional conjugated polymers prepared by electropolymerization. Spectroelectrochemical investigation of electro-oxidation products suggested the formation of charged species like polarons or bipolarons.
Tanaka et al. and Hu et al. synthesized and investigated chromophores containing one (71) or three (72) phenoxazinyl donor fragments and exhibiting TADF properties (Fig. 31).51,52 According to the XRD data, the dihedral angle between the donor and acceptor planes in monosubstituted s-triazine 71 was 74.9°, which coincided with the theoretically calculated value (74.8°). In addition, the value of ΔEST = 0.07 eV was calculated. Compound 71 exhibited green fluorescence in toluene solution with λem = 545 nm and Φf = 14.5%, and the Φf value increased to 29.5% in deoxygenated toluene. The decay profile of the transition fluorescence in toluene showed two components: one with a lifetime of 19 ns for the prompt component and another with a lifetime of 0.676 μs for the delayed component. The obtained data confirmed that derivative 71 possesses TADF properties, and the OLED, based on compound 71 as an emitting layer, demonstrated green emission with a maximum of EQE = 12.5%.
 Fig. 31  Chemical structure of compounds 71, 72. 
The trisubstituted derivative 72 was selected as a model system to study the ICT process in solvents of different polarities using stationary, femtosecond as well as nanosecond spectroscopy.52
This chromophore demonstrated fluorescence with a red shift of the emission band in solutions, and the Stokes shift values increased with an increase in the solvent polarity. Thus, in toluene and in dichloromethane λem = 573 nm and λem = 651 nm were observed with Φf value decreased from 21% (in toluene) to 1% (in CH2Cl2). A weak blue band shift by 16 nm occurred in absorption spectra when going from toluene to CH2Cl2. The calculations showed a significant change in dipole moment (Δμ = 23.3 D) during excitation. The fluorescence decay profiles of derivative 72 in toluene and THF were analysed. Two components were identified in toluene: the first one at 17 ns, related to rapid fluorescence, and the second with a lifetime of about 1 μs, was attributed to a delayed fluorescence. In contrast, in THF the slow decay component disappeared. These data and additional studies suggested the formation of a polar-dependent ICT state. This ICT state resulted in strong interactions between the solute molecules and the surrounding solvents, which induced a solvation process. The solvation process was much stronger in polar solvents than in non-polar ones upon excitation, but the intersystem crossing (ISC) process was weaker in polar solvents than in non-polar ones. Based on this study, Hu et al.52 suggested relaxation models of derivative 72 in toluene and THF.
Pang et al. presented synthesis and photoluminescent properties of di-2-pyridylamino derivatives of 1,3,5-triazine 73 and 74 (Fig. 32).53 Derivative 73 was obtained from 2,4,6-trichlorotriazine and di-2-pyridylamine in the presence of base, and compound 74 was synthesized using copper-mediated Ullmann condensation from 2,4,6-tris(p-bromophenyl)triazine and di-2-pyridylamine. The structure of derivative 74 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray data. Both compounds emitted in CH2Cl2 in the blue region at λem = 433 nm (73) and 440 nm (74) with quantum yields of 43 and 78%, respectively. Devices, based on these derivatives as emitter layer, demonstrated blue electroluminescence, but rather poor efficiency.
 Fig. 32  Chemical structure of compounds 73, 74. 
Matsushima et al. described 2,4,6-triphenyltriazine derivatives 75, 76 (Fig. 33) containing pyridyl residue at the periphery.54 These compounds exhibited fluorescence with λem at 410–420 nm in films. Based on derivatives 75, 76 several electronic devices, including OLED ones, were fabricated to investigate the characteristics of electron injection and transfer.
 Fig. 33  Chemical structure of compounds 75, 76. 
It was shown that films of derivatives 75, 76 exhibited very good electron mobilities of 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (75) and 8.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (76) at electric field of 5.0 × 105 V cm−1. The OLED with the compound 75 as electron-transport layer demonstrated the lowest driving voltage of 5.2 ± 0.1 V, the highest power conversion efficiency of 1.88 ± 0.18 lm W−1, and the longest half lifetime of 4200 h at a current density of 50 mA cm−2.
Liu et al. synthesized a series of dyes 78a–c, 79a–c (Scheme 11) of D–π-A type, containing 1,3,5-triazine as π-spacer, and studied their photovoltaic performance.55 Cyanoacetic or rhodanin-3-acetic acids were used as acceptors in these push–pull systems. Compounds 78, 79 were prepared by Knoevenagel reaction from the aldehyde 77 and the corresponding acid (Scheme 11). Chromophores were characterized by spectral methods, including X-ray analysis, and compound 79b was chosen as an example.
 Scheme 11  Synthetic route of triazines 78, 79. Reagents and conditions: (i) cyanoacetic acid; (ii) rhodanine-3-acetic acid. 
In the absorption spectra of chromophores 78, 79, two peaks were observed at 374–403 nm (ε = 23.170–78.940 M−1 cm−1) and 290–308 nm (ε = 28.780–41.250 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The electrochemical properties of 78–79 were studied, and DFT calculations were carried out. It was shown that the HOMO orbital is mainly localized on the triphenylamine moiety, while the LUMO orbital is localized on the cyanoacetic or rhodaninic acid fragment. The LUMO energy levels of these compounds were higher than the energy level of TiO2 conductivity zone, which suggests that these dyes introduce electrons into the conductivity zone of the TiO2 electrode. Sandwich-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on compounds 78, 79 were fabricated and their characteristics were measured. The highest overall efficiency of the conversion of photons into electrons was 1.8%, which was achieved by 78a-based DSSC. This value turned out to be lower compared with known compounds, despite the narrow intensive absorption bands of derivatives 78 and 79.
3. Synthesis and photophysical properties of hetаryl-substituted 1,3,5-triazines
In this section we are going to discuss 1,3,5-triazine derivatives in which the heterocyclic moiety is directly attached to the s-triazine cycle via C–N or C–C bond. Yang et al. and Li et al. reported s-triazine chromophores 80, 81 (Fig. 34) containing 4,6-bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl) as an electron donor component.55–57 Derivative 80 was obtained by reaction of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole potassium salt with 2,4-dichloro-6-methoxy-1,3,5-triazine in dioxane upon heating.56 Compound 81 was prepared similarly using 2,4-dichloro-6-(p-diethylaminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and THF as a solvent.
 Fig. 34  Chemical structure of compounds 80, 81. 
Both derivatives were used as tridentate ligands for the Eu(III) complex capable of sensitizing the lanthanide ion luminescence.56,57 DFT methods as well as 2D site and 3D cube representations were used to study the photophysical properties of derivative 81.58 A change in the dipole moment for the first excited state was established, and the calculated value (Δμ = 6.40 D) was consistent with the experimental one (Δμ = 6.90 D). Large changes in dipole moment and polarizability during excitation showed that the S1 state exhibited a large nonlinear optical (NLO) effect, which contributes to effective two-photon absorption.
Konno et al. prepared symmetrical 2,4,6-tris(carbazolyl-9′-yl)-1,3,5-triazine 82 (Fig. 35) via the reaction of cyanuric chloride with carbazole in the presence of n-BuLi, and thus obtained compound 82 was used as a carrier material for OLEDs.59s-Triazine 82 exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 392 nm in solution, demonstrated Tm = 430 °C and ET = 2.81 eV. The green electroluminescence OLED device was fabricated based on Ir(ppy)3-doped compound 82; this device showed electroluminescence with a maximum at 512 nm and EQE = 10.2%.

Later,60 the same team analysed the charge-transport characteristics of derivative 82. Four types of OLED displays (A, B, C, D) were made using 82 as a carrier material with different ratios of hole-transport [((1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino)biphenyl (α-NPD)] and electron-transport [tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (Alq3)] layers: 2.3:1.0 (A), 1.0:1.0 (B), 1.0:0 (С), 0.9:1.0 (D). The EL spectra were analysed, and it was shown that depending on the structure of the devices their charge-transport characteristics change significantly. A schematic view of the device D, based on 82, is shown in Fig. 36a, and the relative intensity of the hole and electron current for devices based on 82 are presented in Fig. 36b. Devices based on tricarbazole derivatives of benzene, pyridine and pyrimidine were analysed for comparison, and the most balanced bipolar characteristics were shown for devices based on derivative 82.

Asymmetric carbazolyl-substituted 1,3,5-triazines 83–88 (Fig. 35a) represent promising materials for blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLED).61 The compounds were prepared by means of substitution of one (at 0 °C) or two (at 35 °C) chlorine atoms in cyanuric chloride with phenyl, 2-thienyl residues or NPh2 group under the action of phenylmagnesium bromide, thienylmagnesium bromide and lithium diphenylamide, respectively. To replace the remaining one/two chlorine atoms, the reaction was carried out with lithium carbazolide in the presence of [Pd(PPh3)4] as a catalyst.
D–A type fluorophores 83–88 possess good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene, which is important for practical application, and, as a next step, their properties were compared with those of 2,4,6-tris(carbazolyl)-1,3,5-triazine 82. Thus, in chloroform derivatives 83–88 exhibit blue emission (λem 447–480 nm), and in the film the emission spectra were characterized by blue-shift up to 63 nm, which is, possibly, due to the better stabilisation of the ground state (S0) than the excited state (S1) by the solvent effects in a whole push–pull system. The low fluorescence quantum yield (<10%) of compounds 83–86 was due to the intermolecular aggregation of their flat structures. For non-planar compounds 87, 88 higher quantum yield (35%) was observed, which allows application of these compounds as potential blue emitters for OLEDs. The triplet state energies corresponding to T1 → S0 transition of compounds 83–85, 87, 88 (ET = 2.94–3.00 eV) exceed the value of the compound 82 (2.81 eV) and indicate the prospects of using the abovementioned s-triazines as materials for PhOLEDs. Electroluminescent devices based on FIrpic-doped s-triazines 83, 87, 88 surpass the device fabricated with symmetric s-triazine 82 in brightness, current efficiency, performance and external quantum efficiency.
Derivatives 89, 90 (Fig. 37) with higher triplet state energy than FIrpic energy and with the value ΔE(T1–S0) > 2.8 eV were found among phenoxy-substituted s-triazines.9 Such molecules are promising as host materials in the emission layer of phosphorescent OLEDs. Compounds 89, 90 were synthesized by means of ipso-substitution of chlorine atom in cyanuric chloride with carbazole, 3-methylcarbazole, phenol and 3,5-dimethylphenol (Fig. 35). These compounds were characterized by decomposition temperatures of 310–386 °C and exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 350–390 nm, as well as phosphorescence in films. Two samples of OLED devices were fabricated based on derivative 89 (R, R1 = H) and one of the devices showed a maximum brightness of 6900 cd m−2, EQE = 10.2% at 22 cd m−2.

Liu et al. synthesized and characterized s-triazine derivatives 91, 92 containing N-phenylcarbazol-3-yl residue (Fig. 37).62 In solution these compounds exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 401 nm (91), 416 (92), as well as phosphorescence at 77 K, and the values of ET = 2.86 eV (91), 2.78 (92) were estimated. Blue and green PhOLED devices were fabricated based on these compounds doped with FIrpic or Ir(ppy)2acac. The blue device based on 92 achieved high maximum current efficiency (CE) of 27.4 cd A−1, high maximum EQE of 14.4% and maintained high efficiencies of 22.7 cd A−1 and 11.9% even at high luminance of 10000 cd m2. Green PhOLEDs based on compounds 91, 92 showed similar electroluminescent performance. Thus, the 92-based device showed maximum CE of 65.7 cd A−1 and a high maximum EQE of 21.2%, 91-based PhOLED demonstrated CE of 64.8 cd A−1 and a maximum EQE of 20.8%.
Carbazole possessing hole-transport properties and s-triazine with electron-transport properties are bound in compounds 93a,b (Fig. 38a) through a fully aromatic but non-conjugated meta-biphenyl bridge.63 Compounds were prepared by Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction starting from 2,4-bis(carbazolyl-9-yl)-6-chlorotriazine and the corresponding 3-(carbazolyl-9-yl)-3′-biphenylboronic acid ester. Both derivatives possessed good thermal stability; the decomposition temperature was observed at 445 °C (93a) and 475 °C (93b). In compound 93b the phenyl moieties in the biphenyl unit are twisted due to two methyl groups in 2- and 2′-positions, which leads to higher triplet energy (2.81 eV) compared with 93a (2.70 eV). Compounds 93a,b exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 431 nm (93a) and 440 nm (93b) in cyclohexane; a bathochromic shift of the emission band of 28 nm was observed in films for 93a, whereas λem of 93b practically did not change (441 nm). Low-temperature (at 5 K) phosphorescence spectra were recorded in films, and ET values were determined. PhOLED samples were fabricated using 93a,b as bipolar carrier material and doped with FIrpic, and the emission of λem = 473 nm was observed with maximum EQE of 6.2% (for 93a) and 7.0% (for 93b).

Chang et al. described dicarbazole-s-triazine molecule 94 (Fig. 38) as bipolar carrier material for high-efficiency green PhOLED.64 The compound was prepared by means of reaction between 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine and 3-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-9H-carbazole in the presence of NaH in DMF at room temperature. Compound 94 possessed sufficient rigidity and steric hindrances, showed exact glass transition temperature (Tg = 134 °C) and good thermal stability (Td = 425 °C). Green photoluminescence (λem = 526 nm) was observed in dioxane, and the ET value of 2.67 eV was calculated from low-temperature phosphorescence experiments at 9 K.
Chang et al. fabricated several triple-layer devices based on chromophore 94 with the following architecture: ITO/TAPC (40 nm)/CzT doped with 8 wt% of iridium complex (20 nm)/TmPyPB (50 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (150 nm). Di-[4-(N,N-ditolylamino)-phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC)and 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB) were introduced as hole-transport layer (HTL) and electron-transport layer (ETL), respectively. PhOLED based on the yellowish-green luminescent bis[2-tolyl-pyrimidinato-N,C][acetyl-acetonato]iri-dium(III) (TPm)2Ir(acac) complex exhibited an electroluminescence with the CIE coordinates of (0.38, 0.59) at 102 cd m−2, and possessed the best characteristics.64 The maximum external quantum/luminance/power efficiencies of this device were up to 20%, 75.7 cd A−1, 71.3 lm W−1, respectively (Fig. 38b).

s-Triazine derivative 95 containing two bicarbazole donor fragments (Fig. 38a) was patented as an emission-layer material for OLED. The application of this compound allowed the recombination of holes and electrons over the entire surface of the radiating material layer, thereby increasing the light yield and the service life of OLED.65
Modification of the N1-position of carbazole, incorporated into 1,3,5-triazine, was performed to synthesize new compounds 96–99 (Fig. 39).66 All the compounds were prepared by means of Pd-catalysed reaction between (9-phenylcarbazolyl)-substituted carbazole and 2-chloro-4,6-diphenyltriazine in the presence of NaH or tBuONa. Derivatives were characterized by a glass transition temperature in the range of 120–128 °C and high thermal stability. In solutions they exhibited fluorescence with λem at 470 nm (for compounds 96, 97, 99), and at 501 nm (for 98). The ET values of these push–pull molecules defined from phosphorescence spectra were varied from 2.55 to 2.69 eV. The triplet energy of these materials was higher than that of green light-emitting Ir(ppy)3 (2.40 eV). Green phosphorescent OLEDs were fabricated by using 96–99 doped with Ir(ppy)3 as host materials, and high quantum efficiency above 20% was achieved using the same host materials; compound 97 showed the highest quantum efficiency of 24.5% in these OLEDs. According to the authors, optimization of the device structure could provide high power efficiency of 104 lm W−1 in the 97-based device.

2-Biphenyl-4,6-bis(12-phenylindolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11-yl)-1,3,5-triazine 100 (Fig. 40a) was reported as a carrier material for the phosphorescent OLEDs with low control voltage.67,68 According to X-ray data, the dihedral angle between the indolocarbazole unit and the 1,3,5-triazine ring in this compound was 44.0°, and this twisting provides the reduction of the π-conjugation between the donor and acceptor units. Based on DFT data, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were mainly located around donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were 5.37 and 2.56 eV, correspondently (Fig. 40b). Triplet energy for derivative 100 (2.55 eV) was higher than that of green-emitting Ir(ppy)3 (2.40 eV), and this compound possessed very low ΔEST = 0.11 eV.

A three-layer device of structure ITO glass/100 (as host material) (2 nm)/Ag (150 nm) was fabricated with Ir(ppy)3 as a guest. As a result, a very low onset voltage of 2.19 V was achieved even without p- or n-doping, with a maximum current and power efficiencies of 68 cd A−1 and 60 lm W−1, respectively. Also, there was no significant roll-off of current efficiency in the luminance range from 1000 to 10000 cd m−2. Thus, Zhang et al.68 demonstrated that low-voltage efficient LEDs without p- or n-doping can be realized by using host materials with sufficiently small ΔEST.
Phosphorescent OLED with the emitter layer containing 2-(4-(4-(diphenylamino)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-9H-xanten-9-one (p-XanCarDipha) as a double host, and indolocarbazolyl derivative of s-triazine 101 (ratio 1:1) doped with 12 wt% Ir(ppy)3 as guest material, reached the EQE value of 20.93% and current efficiency of 77.40 cd A−1.69 Compared with the single-host EQE (16.86%) of p-XanCarDipha, the efficiency of this double-host device was improved significantly. According to Xu et al.,69 the main reason for that was the combination of p-XanCarDipha and compound 101 (Fig. 40), which improves the carrier balance in the EML of a double-host system.
Li et al. described derivative 102 (Fig. 40) of D–A–A structure with carbazole unit as a donor and s-triazine and phosphinoxide as acceptors, representing an advanced host material for blue PhOLED.70 This compound was obtained by the interaction of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(carbazol-9-yl)triazine with diphenylphosphine in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 in DMF under heating. Compound 102 exhibited blue fluorescence at λem = 420 nm in solution and phosphorescence at 77 K with triplet energy value of 2.93 eV and ΔEST = 0.27 eV. Films of 102 in bis(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)ether oxide (DPEPO) matrix were prepared by vacuum evaporation. Their wide radiation shifted to 434 nm and was characterized by a photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%. Analysis of the time attenuation curve showed that the characteristic radiation of TADF 102-based film consisted of rapid fluorescence with a lifetime of 45 ns and delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 8.6 μs. The host characteristics of 102 were further improved due to diphenylphosphine oxide group with large steric hindrance for suppressing intermolecular interaction-induced quenching. Compound 102 successfully realized the 100% host–dopant energy transfer efficiency by adopting bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato)tetrakis((1-pyrazolyl)borate)iridium(III) (FIr6) as dopant. Blue PhOLED based on 102 with FIr6 as a dopant demonstrated an EQE value of 22.7% and very low control voltage.
Kumar et al. described s-triazine derivative 103 (Fig. 41) of A–D–A structure with phenothiazine donor and s-triazine and benzoannelated benzimidazole acceptor units as blue emitter.71 The compound was obtained in two steps: via the reaction of 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxytriazine with 3-formylphenothiazine and subsequent reaction with 9,10-phenanthrenquinone and aniline under heating in acetic acid. The structure of s-triazine 103 was confirmed by X-ray data. In solution the derivative emitted at 400 nm, while in solid form this compound was characterized by wide emission band with a maximum at 430 nm. According to CV data, it exhibited Eg = 3.27 eV. The OLED devices doped with 1 wt% to 5 wt% of molecule 103 showed deep-blue emission at brightness of 100 or 1000 cd m−2. The device with 3 wt% dopant exhibited an EQE of 1.6% and CIE (0.16, 0.09).
 Fig. 41  Chemical structure of compounds 103–106. 
Novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives 104 containing disubstituted phenothiazine moiety and alkoxy groups were reported72 as promising substances for a buffer layer capable of reducing the polarity difference between the photoactive layer and the electron transport layer in the device, thereby improving the performance.
The phenoxazine derivative of 1,3,5-triazine 105 was reported as a radiant layer material in OLED. Its application promotes the recombination of holes and electrons over the entire surface of the emitting layer, which allows an increase in the light yield and the service life of the OLED.65
In s-triazine derivative 106 with 9,9-dimethylacridane fragment attached to the fluorenylalkene moiety a free pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom at position 10 in acridine was involved in the conjugation. The total mobility of the group was relatively limited due to the rigid flat condensed ring structure. As a result, the glass transition temperature of the derivative was effectively increased, which is favorable for film formation. It should be noted that the synthetic method for the preparation of the target compound was simple, and the starting reagents were readily available. The derivative 106 was incorporated into the OLED device as a base material, so that the light yield of the device was sufficiently improved, and the drive voltage of the device was further effectively reduced. Thus, the acridane-s-triazine derivative 106 represents a promising OLED material with excellent performance.
Directly attached to the s-triazine core, the thiophene fragment in many cases acts as a bridge between the donor and acceptor, and such push–pull systems were investigated for their possible application as dyes for solar cells.73s-Triazine derivatives 107a–d, 108a–c with aryl or arylethynyl groups attached via thiophene spacer (Fig. 42) were prepared by means of the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of 2,4,6-tris(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine and arylboronic acids (107a–d) or via Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction with arylethynes (108a–c).74 All the obtained s-triazine derivatives exhibited blue-green fluorescence in toluene with λem 440–497 nm and quantum yield of 51–83%. Red shift of the emission band by 20–43 nm was observed in chloroform. All the compounds exhibited two-photon absorption at 720–880 nm and showed large two-photon absorption cross-sections (793–1233 GM for 107a–d, 879–1508 GM for 108a–c).
 Fig. 42  Chemical structure of compounds 107–110. 
Ooyama et al. described the synthesis and photophysical studies of fluorescent dyes 109 and 110 of D–π-A and (D–π-)2-A structure (Fig. 42).75,76 In molecules 109 and 110 donor diphenylaminocarbazole and acceptor 1,3,5-triazine units were thienylene-bridged. Both compounds were characterized by an intensive absorption at λabs = 428–434 nm (109), λabs = 428–435 nm (110); the molar absorption coefficient was considerably higher for 110 (ε 78500–85100 M−1 cm−1 (110) vs. 34500–37200 M−1 cm−1 (109)). Derivative 109 exhibited intense fluorescence in solution with λem at 516–638 nm, Φf = 57–63% (dioxane or THF) and Φf = 2–6% (acetone or DMF). Disubstituted s-triazine 110 possessed emission in solution with λem at 509–665 nm, the decrease in Φf from 86 to 9% was observed upon the increase in the solvent polarity. A pronounced fluorosolvatochromism of compounds 109 and 110 with Δλ up to 90–194 nm was demonstrated.
The photovoltaic properties of dye 109 were studied.75 The absorption spectrum of the film of compound 109 adsorbed on the TiO2 surface proved to be similar to that in dioxane solution. However, a broadening of the peaks was observed due to the formation of dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface. The adsorption states of 109 on TiO2 nanoparticles were studied, and it was shown that dye 109 interacts with the TiO2 surface through the formation of s-triazinium ion at the Brønsted acid sites on the surface. The DSSC based on 109 was fabricated by using the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode (9 mm), Pt-coated glass as a counter electrode, and an acetonitrile solution with iodine (0.05 M), lithium iodide (0.1 M), and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M) as an electrolyte. The amount of dye 109 adsorbed on TiO2 was determined, and the following DSSC characteristics were obtained: the short-circuit photocurrent density (2.00 mA cm−2) and solar energy-to-electricity conversion yield (54%). The performance of this DSSC was lower than that of similar devices, based on dyes bearing pyridine and pyrazine acceptors.
1,3,5-Triazine-containing push–pull systems 111–114 (Fig. 43) with different lengths of conjugated chain and substituents at the position 6 of the s-triazine core were obtained as potential DSSC sensitizers.77 2,4-Bis(5-(bromomethyl)thiophen-2-yl)derivative of 1,3,5-triazine was chosen as the key intermediate; its reaction with triethyl phosphate and subsequent interaction with aldehyde-containing donor led to dyes 111–114.
 Fig. 43  Chemical structure of compounds 111–114. 
Dyes 111–114 were characterized by broad absorption bands with λmax at 451–498 nm and high molar absorption coefficient (ε = 49260–81340 M−1 cm−1) in solutions. Absorption spectra in TiO2 films exhibited two maxima at 400 to 650 nm. Derivatives containing additional thiophene or furan cycle showed red shift of the absorption band. To study the photovoltaic properties, sandwich-type DSSC cells were fabricated, and their characteristics were obtained. Analysis of the data showed that dyes 111 bearing a terminal hydroxyl group demonstrated lower photovoltaic performances (1.20–1.55%) compared with carboxy- or dicarboxyphenyl derivatives 113, 114 (1.97–2.77%).
Compounds possessing nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were found among the series of aryl(heteryl)ideno-substituted s-triazines. Devi et al.78 synthesized compounds 117, 118, in which 4-aminoantipyrine and 4-methylacetophenone fragments acted as donors, while (2-thienyl)–CHN–, (3-indolyl)–CHN– and (4-nitrophenyl)–CHN– groups were electron acceptors (Scheme 12). All the obtained derivatives proved to be thermally stable up to 160 °C.
 Scheme 12  Synthetic route to triazines 117 and 118. Reagents and conditions: (i) EtOH, reflux, 8 h; (ii) EtOH, reflux, 6 h. 
All the compounds exhibited blue fluorescence with λem = 372–410 nm in dichloromethane solutions. The behaviour in solvents of different polarities was studied, and it was shown that derivative 117b exhibited more positive solvatochromism than s-triazines 117a and 118. 1,3,5-Triazine 117b demonstrated the best NLO properties due to more efficient π-electron flow from the most delocalized donor to acceptor parts. The efficiency of second harmonic generation for this compound was as high as 118 mV.78
4. Synthesis and photophysical properties of alkenyl- and alkynyl-1,3,5-triazines
According to the literature data, alkenyl-substituted 1,3,5-triazines are less promising candidates in terms of their application in electronic device materials compared with aryl- or hetaryl-substituted derivatives of s-triazines. However, the synthesis of such derivatives is widely presented, and some photophysical properties have been revealed. Thus, mono-, di- and tris(arylethenyl) derivatives of 1,3,5-triazine 119–121 (Fig. 44), containing electron donor substituents in the aryl fragment, were synthesized and studied.79–81 All the compounds were obtained by means of aldol condensation reaction between 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine and the corresponding arylaldehyde.
 Fig. 44  Chemical structure of compounds 119–121. 
The structures of compounds 119а and 120а were confirmed by X-ray data.79 Linear and non-linear optical properties of compounds 119–121а were analyzed, and all the collected photophysical data indicated that incorporation of more branched substituents into the s-triazine ring leads to significantly enhanced linear and nonlinear optical responses. The spectral behavior of 120а was closer to that of 121а, while it was different from that of 119а. The spectral positions (λmax) of the linear absorption (from 410 to 430 nm), the single-photon excited fluorescence (SPEF) (from 492 to 522 nm) and the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) (from 499 to 522 nm) showed redshift of the emission when the branch number increased from 119a to 121a. Some parameters were increased significantly when going from 119a to 121a: the spectral intensities of linear absorbance (εmax) 3.6-fold, the two-photon absorption cross-section (σ) from 240 to 671 GM, the SPEF 120-fold and the TPEF intensities 9-fold. The planar three- or two-branched s-triazines 121a, 120a proved to be more promising than one-branched compound 119a with respect to TPA and TPEF properties. The compound 119a was second harmonic generation (SHG) active in the crystalline state.
Structures of compounds 119b,c and 120c were also confirmed by X-ray data.80 In all these derivatives the styryl moiety was conjugated with the s-triazine ring to result in a planar conformation of a whole molecule. Compounds 119b,c–121b,c also exhibited NLO properties, and they demonstrated the same “structure–photophysical properties” relationships as those for compounds 119a–121a. In the absorption spectra the red shift of the absorption maxima was up to 18 nm, while in the SPEF band it was 30–42 nm and in the TPEF band it was 35–45 nm. The two-photon absorption cross-section (σ2PA) increased significantly as the branch number increased, with the ratios of σ2PA between one-, two-, and three-branched compounds being 1.0:3.3:7.0 for series 119d–121d and 1.0:3.7:7.0 for series 119c–121c, respectively, indicating remarkable cooperative enhancement.
Meier et al. described an extended series of derivatives (121b,e–g, Fig. 44).82 Alkoxy- or dimethylamino groups at the peripheral benzene rings, which acted as electron donors, and the central 1,3,5-triazine ring acting as an electron acceptor resulted in the efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The push–pull effect in these compounds became evident by the polarization of the olefin-based bridges, which was expressed by the considerable differences in the chemical shifts observed in 13C and 1H NMR spectra. Protonation of the 1,3,5-triazine core enhanced the effect, as was demonstrated by a bathochromic shift; a secondary protonation of dimethylamino groups, however, led to the hampering of ICT. Thus, upon the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, the yellow compound 121b changed its color to violet, and it then became colorless.
Push–pull systems of the series 119d–121d, like in previous series, exhibited linear and NLO properties. The maximum of SPEF band demonstrated red shift from 490 nm (119d) to 510 nm (121d) and the quantum yield increased from 5 to 20%, respectively. Derivatives 120d and 121d showed sufficiently high σ2PA values (240 and 175 GM). Systems 119–121d were studied as initiators of two-photon induced polymerization (2PP), which represents the basis of 3D printing as a powerful micro-production tool. Specialized two-photon initiators (2PIs) are essential components of applied photosensitive polymerizable compositions. All studied systems showed a remarkable increase in sensitivity, i.e. threshold values for the fabrication of ideal structures as well as thermally induced degradation of the composition were decreased. The performance of the 2PIs based on compounds 120d and 121d at 800 nm was similar to the well-established quadrupolar ketone-based 2PI reference, but derivative 121d exceeded it by a significantly lower manufacturing threshold at extremely high recording speeds of up to 200 mm s−1 and a wider gap for ideal processing parameters.
Compound 121f (Fig. 44) with a terminal methyl group was chosen as key intermediate for the synthesis of derivatives 122 (Fig. 45).82 Meier et al. converted 121f into the triphosphonate by a Wohl–Ziegler bromination with NBS and a subsequent Arbusov reaction with triethyl phosphite. The Wittig–Horner olefination of the triphosphonate with the corresponding hexyloxy-containing aldehydes gave the target compound 122. The push–pull character of compounds 122 was evidenced by the polarization of the olefin-based bridges observed in 1H, 13C NMR and UV/Vis spectra. Extension of the conjugation in the series of these derivatives led to a systematic bathochromic and hyperchromic effect. The protonation of the alkoxy-substituted compounds 122 with TFA took place solely at the central 1,3,5-triazine ring. The bathochromic shifts varied from 82 to 91 nm, and then remained constant upon further addition of TFA to the CH2Cl2 solutions.
 Fig. 45  Chemical structure of compounds 122, 123. 
2,4,6-Tristyryl-1,3,5-triazines and their higher homologues bearing oligo(1,4-phenylenevinylene) [OPV] chains (123, Fig. 45) were synthesized by the aldol condensation between 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine and the corresponding aldehyde.83 Notably, the introduction of hexylamino groups provided good solubility of the target products. These derivatives exhibited a strong push–pull effect. Thus, compounds 123 absorbed in a wide range from 350 to 600 nm, and all the spectra lacked fine structure and were highly dependent on the concentration.
Unlike alkoxy-substituted s-triazines 122, protonation in a series of amino-substituted compounds 123 proceeded both at the amino group and at the s-triazine cycle. Upon increasing the concentration of trifluoroacetic acid the solution of 123a exhibited first a strong red shift and then blue shift (Fig. 46а) of the absorption, and this significant change in solution color could be observed by the naked eye (Fig. 46b). The homologues compounds 123b and 123c behaved oppositely. Initial protonation provoked a blue shift and further protonation a red shift; this unexpected result was due to different protonation sites. Whereas 123a, possessing the strongest push–pull effect, was first protonated at the s-triazine ring (this site was confirmed by 1H NMR), 123b and 123c were first protonated at the NR2 group. Unfortunately, other photophysical properties of 122 and 123 were not discussed in the literature.

Chromophores 124 bearing fluorene fragments (Fig. 47) were synthesised by means of condensation reaction between 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine and 7-bromo-9,9-dimethyl-2-formylfluorene under alkaline condition and subsequent Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction with diamine.84 Their linear photophysical and two-photon absorption (TPA) properties were investigated by absorption, fluorescence, and nonlinear transmission method, respectively. Both compounds absorb in the visible range at 429 and 403 nm, respectively, and they exhibited fluorescence at λem = 554 nm and Фf = 36% (124а), 440, 554 nm and Фf = 25% (124b). The compound 124а (206.3 GM) exhibited larger TPA cross-section than 124b (57.8 GM) in the femtosecond regime at 800 nm.
 Fig. 47  Chemical structure of compounds 124, 125. 
Liu et al. investigated the photophysical properties of s-triazine derivative 125 (Fig. 47) bearing terminal pyrrole groups.85 This chromophore was prepared via Knoevenagel coupling. The derivative was characterized by an absorption band at λmax = 401 nm in THF, then underwent red shift to 490 nm upon addition of CF3COOH (TFA), which results in change of solution colour from yellow to red. The colour of protonated solution could be returned to its original form by means of titration with TEA, and this reversible colour change could be observed many times. In solution derivative 125 demonstrated fluorescence with λem at 490 nm and Φf = 5%. Upon adding of TFA the emission quenching was observed along with bathochromic shift of the band to 553 nm. NMR spectroscopic study demonstrated the protonation of s-triazine upon CF3COOH addition, and the protonated molecule retained the C3h symmetry. These results indicated that the protonation of the N atom of the s-triazine moiety in molecule 125 could enhance the pull–push effect. Chromophore 125 exhibited TPA properties, and the TPA cross-section enhanced with increasing the amount of TFA in THF. Liu et al. concluded that such chromophores can be used as proton-controlled optical sensors.85
Cai et al. investigated novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives 126a,b, 127a,b, containing one or two A–π-D–π-A quadrupolar branches (Fig. 48).86s-Triazine and benzazole were used as acceptors, dimethoxyphenylene was the electron donor moiety, and the linkage was achieved via the ethene moiety. Chromophores were synthesized by condensation of 2,4,6-trimethyltriazine with the corresponding aldehydes in alkaline medium.

Two bands in absorption spectra were observed at 341–348 nm and 418–436 nm; the latter was of considerable charge transfer character. The position of this band practically did not change in different solvents. Upon the increasing of the number of branches, λmax was bathochromically shifted (to 10 nm), and absorption coefficients also increased. All these compounds exhibited strong single-photon excited fluorescence (SPEF) in THF (from 420 to 630 nm) with λmax at 482–502 nm and Фf = 48–94%. A considerable decrease in quantum yield was noticed when going from mono- to di-branched derivatives (from 126 to 127), and for compounds 127 this effect was also caused by increased polarity of solvent. Chromophores 126 and 127 exhibited NLO properties. Thus, upon excitation by 800 nm laser (a pulse width of 80 fs), all these compounds emitted intense green up-conversion fluorescence, and two maxima were observed in the spectra: main at 478–484 nm and a shoulder at 493–496 nm. The two-photon absorption cross-sections (σ) were 80, 48, 502, and 362 GM for 126a, 126b, 127a and 127b, respectively. The σ of 126a and 127a were 67% and 39% larger than those of 126b and 127b, respectively, because benzothiazole end-group has a stronger electron-accepting ability compared with benzoxazole, which enhances the delocalization of electrons.
In the next article from the same team87 three new A–π-D–π-A branched compounds with s-triazine and benzimidazole units 128–130 (Fig. 49) were described. Their photophysical properties such as linear absorption, single-photon excited fluorescence, fluorescence quantum yield, two-photon absorption, and frequency of up-converted fluorescence were investigated.
 Fig. 49  Chemical structure of compounds 128–130. 
When the number of branches increased, the band positions of the linear absorption (421, 431 and 435 nm in THF for 128, 129 and 130, respectively) and SPEF (483, 490, 493 nm in THF for 128, 129 and 130, respectively) showed small red shifts. The SPEF quantum yield in THF decreased when going from the derivative 128 to 130: 92% (128), 46% (129) and 38% (130). In these compounds λabc did not change upon an increase of the solvent polarity, while λem showed red shift (15–17 nm), and Φf was in the range of 87–92% for 128 and greatly decreased for 129 and 130 (to 1–3%). Under excitation by 800 nm laser (a pulse width of 80 fs), all these compounds exhibited intense green frequency up-converted fluorescence, and TPEF spectra differed from SPEF (Fig. 50). The two-photon absorption cross-sections were 210, 968, and 1613 GM for 128, 129, 130 respectively. According to the authors, this result showed that significant enhancement of the two-photon absorption cross-section can be achieved by sufficient electronic coupling between the strong charge transfer acceptor–donor–acceptor quadrupolar branches through the s-triazine core.

Cai et al. presented new branched fluorophores 131–133 of A–(π-D–π-A)1–3 structures containing 2- or 4-pyridinyl moieties as terminal acceptor units (Fig. 51) and displaying high two-photon absorption.88 Their linear and NLO properties in different solvents were studied. It should be noted that the structure–property interactions found in these series were similar to those for s-triazine derivatives 128–130 bearing terminal benzimidazole acceptor units. With an increase in branching of the structure, a red shift of linear absorption λmax, SPEF λmax was observed; ε value increased, and SPEF quantum yield decreased. The increase in solvent polarity caused red shift of SPEF λmax and a significant decrease in SPEF quantum yield in the range of derivatives 132 and 133. All these compounds demonstrated intense green frequency up-converted fluorescence (λmax at 508–546 nm) with a red shift of 30–45 nm compared with SPEF λmax. The authors investigated the effects of excitation wavelengths (690–890 nm) and pump powers at optimal excitation wavelengths on the TPEF intensity (Fig. 52).

In THF solutions the two-photon absorption cross-sections of fluorophores were estimated as 236, 1149, 2250 GM for 131a–133a and 207, 1015, 2028 GM for 131b–133b, respectively, which exceeded those of many known D–π-A tri-branched compounds.
Liu et al. described and studied tri-branched chromophore 134, based on 1,3,5-triazine core and bearing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene electron-donating end-groups, in comparison with TFA-analog 135 (Fig. 53).89 Derivative 134 exhibited better two-photon absorption cross-section (247.8 GM) compared with chromophore 133, an intense blue-shift of λmax in UV spectra (409 nm), single-photon excited fluorescence spectra (λmax = 546 nm) and two-photon excited fluorescence spectra (λmax = 546 nm, λex = 800 nm).
 Fig. 53  Chemical structure of compounds 134, 135. 
Cai et al. presented a series of novel asymmetric single-branched (136, 137), double-branched (138, 139), and triple-branched (140, 141) compounds with 1,3,5-triazine core (Fig. 54);90 carbazole (or phenothiazine) and pyridine (or benzimidazole) were selected as the peripheral electron donor and acceptor, respectively, and the electron-donating methoxy groups were introduced in the middle of the branch as the auxiliary donors. All derivatives were obtained by sequential condensation of 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine with corresponding aldehydes; photophysical properties, including linear absorption, one-photon excited fluorescence (OPEF), two-photon absorption, and frequency up-converted fluorescence, of compounds 136–141 were studied in different solvents.
 Fig. 54  Chemical structure of compounds 136–141. 
Compounds 136–141 proved to exhibit OPEF in solution with λmax at 435–594 nm. It should be noted that in THF single-branched phenothiazine-containing derivative 136 emitted yellow-orange light, whereas the carbazole-containing counterpart 137 emitted blue light, and all other derivatives emitted green light (Fig. 55a). With an increase in the solvent polarity from toluene to DMF, red shift of OPEF band maximum by 28–46 nm was observed for all compounds, and the Stokes shift increased, while the linear absorption wavelengths changed slightly (bathochromic shift by 4–6 nm). Under excitation by 690–930 nm fs laser pulses, all compounds demonstrated frequency up-converted fluorescence with the maximum TPEF wavelengths at 471–561 nm (toluene) and 496–575 nm (THF). Two-photon absorption cross-sections of the compounds 136–141 in THF under different excitation wavelengths were obtained (Fig. 55b). Their two-photon response was found to be nearly additive with respect to the number of branches. Derivative 141 demonstrated the highest value σ = 2072 GM.

Obtained results90 allowed the authors to conclude that the compounds 136–141 do not exhibit a strong cooperative effect associated with the non-additive enhancement of σ. Based on the σ values of 139 and 141 (787–2072 GM), which are much larger than those of the analogous compounds 138 and 140 (328–844 GM), it seems reasonable to infer that the benzimidazole acceptor could be a very useful TPA structural unit.
Push–pull systems 142–146 (Fig. 56 and 57), containing 1,3,5-triazine as an acceptor core and various terminal electron donor groups attached through triple CC bond as π-conjugated bridge, were synthesized, and their photophysical properties were studied.91 Fluorophores were divided into symmetrical star-shaped molecules 142, 143 (Fig. 56), unsymmetrical V-shaped 144, 145 and star-shaped molecules 146 (Fig. 57). The synthesis was carried out by means of sequential reaction of cyanuric chloride with corresponding arylethynylzinc chloride in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4. The photophysical properties were evaluated as a function of electron-donating group nature, the dimensionality of the system (quadrupolar or octupolar) and the symmetry type. In symmetric derivatives the substitution of TPA group with carbazole led to a hypsochromic shift in single-photon absorption maximum (441 nm for 142 and 406 nm for 143), a large blue shift in emission maximum (549 nm for 142 and 475 nm for 143), a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield (52 and 46%, respectively), as well as an increase in two-photon absorption cross-section (916 and 937 GM, respectively).
 Fig. 56  Chemical structure of compounds 142, 143. 
 Fig. 57  Chemical structure of compounds 144–146. 
For unsymmetrical V-shaped compounds 144, 145a emission maximum at 548–553 nm and Фf = 50–53% were observed; derivative 145b exhibited the shift of λem to 483 nm and Фf = 58%; star-shaped molecule 146 demonstrated λem = 550 nm and Фf = 75%. Zhang et al.91 concluded that in unsymmetrically branched molecules the emissive state was invariably localized on the branch with the largest intramolecular charge transfer effect. The two-photon absorption cross-section value of the asymmetric star-shaped compound 146 was 1117 GM. The authors noted that for both symmetric and asymmetric fluorophore, сhanging the donor group nature in branched molecules increased the nonlinear absorption, maintaining a high TPA cross-section.
Gao et al. presented the series of V-shaped alkynyl-1,3,5-triazines 147–151 (Fig. 58).92 2,4-Dichloro-1,3,5-triazine derivatives were selected as starting reagents. Sequential substitution of chlorine atoms using the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction resulted in desired symmetric or asymmetric products in good yields. The X-ray diffraction analysis of 147a confirmed a coplanar position between the phenyl group and the 1,3,5-triazine moiety. Intermolecular π–π interactions were observed between two s-triazine units. Linear derivatives 147a–d, 149a–e exhibited fluorescence at λem = 425–461 nm, whereas V-shaped compounds 150а–с and 151b exhibited λem = 421–448 nm. Unfortunately, other photophysical properties were not described.

5. Synthesis and photophysical properties of bis-, oligo- and polymers containing substituted 1,3,5-triazines
The series of bis-s-triazines 154а–е was synthesized for the first time by means of Ni-catalyzed Ullmann self-coupling reaction of monochloro-s-triazines 153, which were easily prepared by the reaction between cyanuric chloride and Grignard reagents (Scheme 13).29 The structure of bis-s-triazines was confirmed by X-ray data for the compound 154a; two s-triazine and four benzene rings proved to construct a plane, suggesting that the compound is conjugated. Derivatives 154b–e exhibited fluorescence at λem = 473–501 nm with quantum yields of 0.3–7.8%. Electron transport properties of derivative 154a were improved compared with the triphenyltriazine derivative.

Derivative 155 (Fig. 59), in which two s-triazine fragments were bound through the biphenyl moiety, was synthesized as electron transport material (ETM) for OLEDs.93 This compound demonstrated an electron mobility of ∼7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a field of 8.00 × 105 V cm−1, which was 10-fold greater than that of for AlQ3. An OLEDs device based on 155 as an electron transport layer exhibited a ∼1.7–2.5 V lower driving voltage and a significantly increased efficiency, compared with those with AlQ3.
 Fig. 59  Chemical structure of compounds 155–157. 
1,3,5-Triazine ether 156 (Fig. 59) was used as an ETM for Alq3-based OLEDs.1 Amorphous films of 156 with Td = 115 °C were obtained by means of vapor deposition. Cyclic voltammetry of 156 revealed a reversible reduction with an EA of 2.48 eV. In 156-based OLED devices an ETM EL from Alq3 with a brightness of ∼1000 cd m−2 was achieved, and a modest improvement in device efficiency by factors of 2–3 was noticed.
Amorphous poly(1,3,5-triazine) ethers 157a–d (Fig. 59) were obtained.94 These polymers exhibited good thermal stability (Tg = 186–247 °C) and sufficient solubility in organic solvents (THF, NMP, and cyclohexanone) to spin-coat thin films. The electrochemical measurements of model s-triazines revealed the values of EA of 2.47–2.86 eV and IP of ∼6.16 eV, suggesting that polymers 157a–d possess good hole-blocking properties. Using 157d as the ETM, a bilayer PPV LED was fabricated, and this device exhibited a brightness of 50 cd m−2 at 22 V, compared with ∼1 cd m−2 for the single-layer PPV LED. The overall low performance of bi- and poly-s-triazines 156, 157 as ETMs for OLED, despite their high EA, suggested that they probably possessed quite low electron mobility.
Bis-s-triazine derivatives with carbazole moiety as a bridge (158) or substituents (159) (Fig. 60) were synthesized later; no improvement in photophysical properties was noticed.9,28 Their characteristics were comparable to those of closely related mono-s-triazine derivatives.
 Fig. 60  Chemical structure of compounds 158–161. 
Lee et al. synthesized bis-s-triazines 160 (Fig. 60), in which the carbazole cycle is connected to the s-triazine one through an ortho-phenylene bridge, while two s-triazine cycles were connected through a para-phenylene bridge.95 These compounds were studied, and their properties were compared with the closely related mono-s-triazine derivatives 161.96 Like bis-s-triazines 160, compounds 161 exhibited TADF properties; meanwhile, compounds 160 demonstrated a significant increase in absorption coefficient and luminescence quantum yield (16.7% for 161a, 78% for 160a). The blue TADF device was fabricated on the basis of derivative 160a, and this device exhibited an EQE value of 15.2%, which significantly exceeded the value for the 161a-based device (9.3%). Thus, the transition from mono- to bis-s-triazines was accompanied by a significant improvement in photophysical properties.
Fang et al. described the good optical properties of some supermolecules containing 1,3,5-triazine units, promising as materials for optoelectronic devices. The synthesis of 1,3,5-triazine 164 containing poly(arylene-ethynylene) units was carried out according to Scheme 14.97 This polymer with an average molecular weight of 8100 possessed good solubility in common organic solvents. It exhibited fluorescence with λem at 479 nm in chloroform with fluorescence quantum yield of 21%, while in solid state this polymer demonstrated a red shift of photoluminescence to 509 nm. In addition, this polymer was electrochemically active.

Chen et al. presented a novel organic conjugated polymer 165 (Fig. 61), bearing a star-shaped s-triazine-functional triphenylamine framework, as cathode of a Li-organic battery.24 The polymer was prepared by means of chemical oxidative polymerization in chloroform using ferric chloride as an oxidant. In a powder form polymer 165 exhibited high specific surface area (∼930 m2 g−1) and double porous distribution characteristic. As a Li-ion battery cathode material, polymer 165 presented the charge–discharge process characteristics of both the free radical redox of triphenylamine unit and the bipolar redox of s-triazine unit in the polymer, which made it present a multistage discharge voltage plateau during the charge–discharge process. Chen et al.24 concluded that due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the s-triazine unit to triphenylamine moiety, the corresponding discharge plateau for the part of triphenylamine unit in the discharge curve was obviously improved.
 Fig. 61  Chemical structure of polymer 165. 
The Suzuki cross-coupling reaction was used by Lee et al. for the synthesis of hyper-branched emitting polymers 166 (Fig. 62), consisting of s-triazine as an electron-conducting group, polyalkylfluorene of various lengths and terminal hole-conducting groups.98 At the ratio of s-triazine:fluorene:end group = 1:15:10, products 166 with n = 5 were obtained, at the ratio of 1:27:10 products 166 with n = 9 were isolated, and the latter were superior in terms of decomposition temperature by 8–19 °C. The polymers exhibited blue photoluminescence with λem = 418 nm in cyclohexanone solution, whereas in solid λem = 428–450 nm was observed. The fluorescence quantum yield varied in solution in the range of 27–32%. Derivatives 166 proved to be electrochemically active with an Eg value within the range 2.87–2.92 eV. The electronic device based on 166 was fabricated, and this device exhibited blue electroluminescence with λem at 453 nm (n = 5) and at 443 nm (n = 9). Device characteristics were collected, and it was shown that for polymer 166b (n = 9) bearing tetraphenylsilane end-cap group, brightness and effectiveness as high as 1702 cd m−2 and 0.72 cd A−1, respectively, were achieved.
 Fig. 62  Chemical structure of polymers 166a,b. 
Ren et al. synthesized star-shaped oligofluorene-linked oligomers 167a–c (Fig. 63) by means of cyclotrimerization of aromatic nitriles bearing one, two or three fluorene fragments and TPA terminal group. The starting nitriles were prepared from 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene in a sequence of several steps.4 Compounds 167a–c were thermally stable with Td = 433–439 °C. In toluene solutions all the obtained oligomers exhibited bright fluorescence with λem at 431–465 nm (Φf = 83–99%). For the derivative 167a bearing the shortest fluorene linker a well-pronounced fluorosolvatochromism was observed. Among all the oligomers studied, the compound 167a showed the highest nonlinear refractive index of 4.14 × 10−12 esu in THF solution upon the excitation at 800 nm. In addition, 167а exhibited the largest two-photon absorption cross-section of 234 GM and a frequency up-converted two-photon excited fluorescence with λmax = 527 nm under laser irradiation at 800 nm with a pulse duration of 140 fs. OLED devices fabricated on the spin-coated films of 167a and other oligomers as active layers showed an intensive blue electroluminescence with a maximum luminance in case of 167a of 3093 cd m−2 at a current efficiency of 1.47 cd A−1.
 Fig. 63  Chemical structure of compounds 167a–c, 168a–e. 
Idzik et al. synthesized a series of oligo-tri(heteroaryl)-1,3,5-triazines 168 (Fig. 63) by means of electrochemical polymerization.99 The starting monomers were obtained by the palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction of 2,4,6-tris(4-bromophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine with 2-(tributylstannyl)arylenes. In electrochemical oxidation conditions the monomers showed different behavior depending on the nature of the heterocyclic moieties. Thus, dominant dimerization reactions were observed for the monomers 168b,d,e. In the case of monomers 168a and 168c the oxidation successfully led to the electrodeposition of the corresponding electroactive material on the electrode surface. To collect more data on charge carrier type within the film the redox behavior of the obtained polymer film of 168c was studied by means of spectroelectrochemistry. These experiments confirmed a reversible redox behavior of the polymer of 168a upon oxidation switching between all redox states from one to even tetra-cation. In dichloromethane solution all the monomers 168а–с exhibited fluorescence with λem at 415–450 nm and Фf = 36–42%.
Zou et al. synthesized hyper-branched polymers 169 (Fig. 64) by means of Suzuki cross-coupling reaction.100 By varying the ratio of fluorene derivatives (М1, М2) and 2,4,6-tris(4-bromophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (М3) the authors obtained a series of target products 169a–d with average molecular weights over ∼104 Da with molecular weight polydispersity (Mw/Mn) between 2.5 and 3.8. Polymers containing a low number of 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine units (169a–c) exhibited absorption maxima around 385 nm with shoulders at 425 nm. The increase in molar ratio of the 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine unit enhanced the charge transfer band at 425 nm which became dominant for 169d. These polymers showed dual emission, with a structured band in the blue region (410–440 nm), attributed to the polyfluorene, and a broad band in the red region (470–500 nm) associated with the charge transfer state. All the polymers exhibited two-photon absorption (TPA) activity in the range of 660 to 900 nm. The TPA cross-sections values varied from 1000 to 5000 GM, following the 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine/fluorene ratio.
 Fig. 64  Chemical structure of compounds 169a–d. 
Zou et al. reported linear π-conjugated polymers 170а–с (Fig. 65), prepared via Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between 2,4-bis(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-6-thiophen-2-yl-1,3,5-triazine and the corresponding diethynyl aromatic compounds.101 The synthesis of target polymer 171 was performed by means of Suzuki reaction. All the obtained polymers showed good thermal stability with Td = 357–429 °C, tunable fluorescence with λem from 465 to 509 nm and Фf = 25.4–45.5% (for 169а–с) and up to 80.7% (for 171). According to the authors, all the polymers exhibited LUMO levels of −2.86 to −3.06 eV.
 Fig. 65  Chemical structure of compounds 170a–c, 171. 
In the next work102 the same team studied the photophysical properties of polymers 170а,с and 171. It was shown that polymers exhibited both one- and two-photon excited fluorescence at 499 nm (170а), 460 nm (170с), and 474 nm (171) with quantum yields of 25, 35, and 71%, respectively. They also demonstrated two-photon absorption with λmax at 745 nm (170а), 715 nm (170с), and 740 nm (171) and TPA cross-section value (σ2) 5000, 10400, and 6930 GM, respectively. The polymer 171 was intrinsically the best two-photon excited fluorophore due to its larger emission quantum yield; the effective TPA cross-section per monomer unit (σ2f/n) decreased in the following order: 171 (490 GM) > 170c (304 GM) > 170a (157 GM). The two-photon absorption cross-section in linear polymers 170c and 171 was shown to be higher than in the octupolar counterparts 169.
Despite a very bright fluorescence of polymers 170с and 171 in organic solutions their poor water solubility restricts their further application in aqueous media. To overcome this limitation, these polymers were incorporated into silica-protected nanoparticles, prepared by solvent displacement-induced precipitation and subsequent in situ silica polymerization. Nanoparticles n170с and n171 demonstrated good water solubility, their absorption bands appeared slightly broader and with blue-shifted maxima, and their emission was red-shifted compared with the corresponding polymers (Fig. 66). The energy and shape of the TPA spectra in the nanoparticles were similar to that of the isolated polymers, while the two-photon absorption cross-section was reduced by about a half compared with the polymer.

Optimized two-photon absorbers are used as nonlinear NIR-antennas, and task-specific on-demand functional materials such as sensors and biologically active units can be created by combining chromophores with active units.103 Thus, a strategy based on a successful combination of NIR-antenna and photochromic units led to multilayer data storage applications. Thus, push–pull oligomer 171 was designed as nonlinear near-infrared antenna for two-photon activated volumetric optical memories.13 This polymer has a maximum TPA cross-section of 6930 GM at 740 nm, and emission centered at 520 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of 70%, and exhibits efficient up-conversion of the excitation energy into fluorescence emission. Due to its high two-photon absorption the polymer represents promising material for nonlinear NIR-antenna. Multilayer data storage was demonstrated by using the composite films with polymer 171 incorporated into photochromic 1,2-bis(2-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)hexafluorocyclopentene (PC) (Fig. 67).
 Fig. 67  Chemical structure of compounds PC, 170. 

PC(o) absorbed in the UV range with absorption maximum of 260 nm, while PC(c) exhibits absorption in the visible range at 525 nm. Colorless solutions/films of PC(o) turned red upon irradiation with UV light (≤300 nm) due to the presence of PC(c). The two-photon excitation of the polymer 171 triggered a unidirectional isomerization of the PC molecules (a cyclo-reversion process from the closed isomer into the open one) via Förster resonance energy transfer. An efficient FRET process was expected to quench the emission of the TPA polymer 171 in the presence of PC(с). Once PC(с) was converted into PC(o), the emission of the TPA polymer was recovered. Data recording with as little as 1 ms of exposure time and 1 mW of 740 nm radiation was accomplished.
6. Conclusions
In this review we have demonstrated that 1,3,5-triazine-based systems display a wide set of promising chemical, supramolecular, linear and nonlinear optical, as well as redox properties, which makes these heterocycles attractive candidates for various practical applications.
The intriguing structural and electronic properties of the s-triazine moiety, its structural symmetry and the spatial coplanarity allow us to obtain linear, quadrupole and octupole push–pull systems, oligo- and polymers based on this heterocycle.
Some general important tools for tuning the photophysical properties and practical usability of s-triazine-based molecules/materials were applied: incorporation of amino-derived, π-rich heterocycles as electron donors, extension and branching of the π-system, and introduction of long alkyl chains to provide good solubility of the chromophore.20,70 The transition from mono- to bis-s-triazine derivatives was also accompanied by a significant improvement in photophysical properties.95
Star-shaped s-triazine derivatives are widely used as host materials for high-efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with EQE > 25% and a wide color gamut.20,40,47 In this regard, it should be noted that 1,3,5-triazine triphenylsilyl derivatives represent a mixture of hole-transport and electron-transport material types for application in high-performance clear blue long-life PhOLEDs.46
Much attention has been paid to the design of carbazole-substituted 1,3,5-triazine-based TADF emitters, and a new strategy based on hyperconjugation for advanced TADF materials was developed via introducing the nonconjugated aliphatic chains into carbazole dendrons. This not only can maintain the small ΔEST and the core emission, but also enhance the PLQYs because of their rigid molecular structures.22
One can see a growing number of works on the design of 1,3,5-triazine-based nonlinear optical functional materials. Thus, enhancement of the two-photon absorption cross-section reached 6930 GM by sufficient electronic coupling between the strong charge transfer acceptor–donor–acceptor quadrupolar branches through the s-triazine core,88 and due to larger emission quantum yield (71%) in the range of fluorophores with different 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine/fluorene ratio.100,102 Optimized two-photon absorbers are used as nonlinear NIR-antennae and combined with active units to perform specific tasks upon demand.103 Multilayer data storage is demonstrated in composite films of photochromic compound 1,2-bis(2-methylbenzo-[b]thiophen-3-yl)hexafluorocyclopentene (PC) doped with water-soluble nanoparticles of 2,4,6-tris(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazine/fluorene polymer.13
1,3,5-Triazine-based polymer 165 was reported as a cathode material of Li-ion battery and demonstrated the charge–discharge process characteristics of both the free radical redox of triphenylamine unit and the bipolar redox of triazine unit in the polymer, which made it present a multistage discharge voltage plateau during the charge–discharge process.24
Among 4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine molecules, a series of highly twisted derivatives with indolinospirobifluorene donor was described; for these structures simultaneous intramolecular charge transfer through a bond (TBCT) and charge transfer through a space (TSCT) in one molecule were observed.8 Novel TADF materials with tunable TBCT and TSCT states exhibited high quantum yield (up to 92%) and TADF properties.
Good candidates for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation were obtained by combination of an electron-deficient 1,3,5-triazine core with three fluorene arms substituted with diarylamino or carbazolyl electron donors; compounds demonstrated high PL quantum yields and exhibited stable radical ion species; light was produced during recombination between the cation radical and the anion radical.31
Based on all the above, in our opinion, the future applications of 1,3,5-triazine-based scaffolds should be focused on creation of more advanced materials for PhOLEDs, highly effective organic chromophores with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials as well as ones for energy storage.
