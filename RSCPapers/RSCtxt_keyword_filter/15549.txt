    , Accepted 26th July 2016First published on 28th July 2016AbstractAlternative high-performance electrocatalysts for triiodide (I3−) reduction of low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are urgently sought after. To address the concerned issues, we report a facile strategy for engineering the nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene (NPG) via an efficient ball-milling process, followed by a simple thermal annealing approach utilizing melamine (C3H6N6) and triphenylphosphine ((C6H5)3P) as the N and P source, respectively. When employed as the counter electrode (CE) in DSSCs, such a metal-free material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the I3−/I− redox reaction. Dual-doping of N and P heteroatoms can markedly enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by a synergistic effect and a high conversion efficiency of 8.57% is achieved, which is superior to Pt CE, and much higher than that of the single-component N- or P-doped graphene electrodes. In addition, the NPG CE also shows an outstanding electrochemical stability. The present results demonstrate that the NPG as a low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for reduction of I3− will be one of the promising CE materials in DSSCs.
Introduction
Since the significant breakthrough in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained popularity due to their high conversion efficiency, ease of fabrication, low production costs, and environmentally friendly nature.2–4 Typically, a DSSC device consists of a dye-adsorbed nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode, triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) electrolyte, and counter electrode (CE).5 The CE plays a vital role in catalyzing the reduction of the I3− to maintain a steady power output.6–9 Noble metal Pt is extensively utilized as the ideal material for CE because of its extraordinary electrocatalytic ability.10,11 However, Pt is precious and its electrochemical stability in the corrosive I3−/I− electrolyte is also unsatisfactory. In this case, the exploration of low-cost and high-performance alternatives to replace Pt is extremely urgent.12,13 Graphene, an inexpensive two-dimensional atomically thick carbon nanomaterial, has been demonstrated to possess outstanding properties, including good electrical conductivity and high specific surface area,14 which makes it a promising candidate of CE for DSSCs.15–20 Nevertheless, the catalytic activity of graphene is still needed to be further improved for catalyzing the reduction of I3−.21 Thus, how to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of graphene and maintain its excellent electrical conductivity turns out to be a key issue needed to be tackled with when employing graphene as CE.
Both theoretical calculations and experimental results have proved that the intentional incorporation of heteroatoms into the graphene crystal lattices could effectively tailor its chemical and electronic properties.22,23 For instance, nitrogen (N), boron (B), or phosphorus (P) atoms doped into graphene can present better performance as CE in DSSCs than that of the pristine graphene because the heteroatoms within the graphene frameworks can induce charge redistribution, creating more catalytic active sites, thus being favorable for the reduction of I3−.24–28 Most recently, it is also found that dual-doping with two elements, one with higher and one with lower electronegativity than that of C (χ = 2.55), for example, N (χ = 3.04) and P (χ = 2.19), can create a unique and synergistically enhanced electronic structure for the carbon matrix. In this case, much more active sites are produced in comparison to that of single atom-doped graphene catalysts.29–35 Nitrogen and phosphorus are in the same family, whereas the latter has higher electron-donating ability and exhibits stronger n-type behavior.36 Theoretical studies have predicted that defects induced by nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doping can result in the presence of a highly localized state close to the Fermi level, particularly attractive for electrocatalysis.37 However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene (NPG) as a metal-free electrocatalyst in DSSCs has never been explored.
In this study, ball-milling was carried out to mix graphene oxide (GO) with melamine (C3H6N6) and triphenylphosphine ((C6H5)3P) adequately, followed by thermal annealing, producing NPG. When the NPG was employed as the CE for DSSCs, a remarkable performance with a conversion efficiency of 8.57% and high electrochemical stability can be achieved, which is superior to Pt CE and much higher than single-component N-doped (NG) or P-doped (PG) graphene electrode.
Experimental
Preparation of materials
Pristine graphite oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite flakes using the modified Hummers’ method. The GO powder was collected by lyophilization for further doping procedure. NPG was synthesized by ball-milling of melamine (C3H6N6) and triphenylphosphine ((C6H5)3P) with an initial GO powder (mass ratio is 10:10:1) at 400 rpm for 12 h, followed by annealing of the mixture in Ar at 900 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. For comparison, NG and PG were also prepared by mixing the GO powder with melamine or triphenylphosphine under the same conditions, respectively.
Fabrication of the CEs
A 10 mg sample and 0.1 mL binder containing ethyl cellulose, terpineol, and ethanol in a mass ratio of 1:8:9 were ground in a mortar for 30 min, yielding five kinds of slurries. The obtained slurries were coated on the FTO glass by doctor-blading with a surface area of 150 cm2 and ca. 10 μm of thickness on average, forming different CEs (ca. 200 μg cm−2 of loading) on FTO, and then heated in a tube furnace at 500 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 30 min. The Pt electrode was purchased from Dalian Heptachroma SolarTech. Co., Ltd, China.
Assembly of DSSCs
DSSCs were fabricated according to our previous work.38 Briefly, the dye-coated TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by immersing a TiO2 film (Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd, China) in a 0.5 mM N719 (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) ethanol solution for 24 h, and then assembled with the NPG, NG, PG, G, and Pt counter electrodes. The electrodes were separated by using a 45 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd, China) and sealed by hot-pressing. The cell internal space was filled with OPV-AN-I type electrolytes (Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd, China). The sealed cells were used for the photocurrent–voltage test with an active area of 0.16 cm2.
Characterization of materials
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were conducted on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2400, RIGAKU, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a DXR Raman microscope (Thermo Scientific, US). The morphologies of the samples were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI, NOVA NanoSEM 450) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, TF30), respectively. The BET specific surface areas were measured by N2 adsorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, US). The chemical composition was recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Al Kα X-ray radiation (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also used to study the surface properties and structures of the samples.
Electrochemical testing
The J–V characteristics of DSSCs were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter equipped with an AAA solar simulator (94032A, Newport, US) under AM 1.5 and 100 mW cm−2. A conventional three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out by taking the as-made CEs as the working electrodes, Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode, respectively, in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 utilizing an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660d, Chenhua, Shanghai). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) spectra were recorded by using Multichannel Potentiostats (VSP, Bio-Logic, France) based on a dark symmetric dummy cell. Tafel polarization curves were obtained by using an electrochemical workstation system (CHI660d, Chenhua, Shanghai) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the same symmetrical dummy cell.
Results and discussion
The synthetic strategy for NPG is illustrated in Scheme 1. The typical XRD patterns of a series of samples are shown in Fig. 1a. The peak at a lower 2θ = 10.6° for GO is due to the accommodation of various oxygen-containing groups and water molecules during the oxidation process of graphite.39 After annealing, this peak completely disappears, suggesting the successful reduction from GO to graphene.40 It is also noted that compared with NG or PG, the peak of NPG at 25.7° indexed to the (002) plane of graphite is slightly weak, indicative of a low graphitization degree to some extent. This implies that more defects are produced in the NPG matrix, which is also confirmed by the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 1b. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) in NPG is relatively high in comparison to other samples and increases from 0.94 for GO to 1.19, revealing more defects within the NPG matrix. These existing defects are derived from the N and P species within the graphene matrix, which are also favorable for the reduction of I3−. Fig. 2a and b show the typical SEM and TEM images of the as-made NPG sample. It can be noted that the features of the two-dimensional structure of graphene with a highly wrinkled structure are clearly observed, which is attributed to the ball-milling process and the relatively large P–C bond length (1.77 Å) compared with the C–C sp2 bonds (1.42 Å).41 Such a highly wrinkled structure is favourable for the formation of an open structure within the NPG matrix, of which the specific surface area is 325 m2 g−1, being slightly higher than that of the other samples (Fig. S1 and Table S1†). In the case of the simple-component NG and PG samples, the wrinkled structure is also present (Fig. S2†), which is similar to that of the as-made NPG sample. The ball-milling process should be responsible for the highly wrinkled structure, where high energy shear force can mechanically peel apart layered materials.42 The resulting loosely crumpled structure will facilitate the easy access of electrolytes to the catalytic surface.29 The elemental mapping of the corresponding NPG sample (Fig. 2c–f) confirms the presence of N and P atoms in NPG, indicative of a uniform distribution of C, N, and P atoms throughout the graphene nanosheets. It is noted that P's signal is relatively weak due to its low doping concentration (Table S2†), which is in agreement with the results in the literature.43

In order to further confirm the N and P doping and investigate their bonding configurations in NPG, XPS measurements were performed, of which the detailed results are shown in Fig. 3. The five characteristic peaks at ca. 285, 532, 400, 134, and 190 eV, corresponding to the C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, P 2p and P 2s, respectively, are observed in Fig. 3a. For the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of the as-made NPG (Fig. 3b), through peak fitting, the asymmetric peak could be divided into four peaks, which correspond to the carbon with the C–C bond (284.6 eV), C–P (CN, C–O) bond (285.4 eV), and CO (C–N) bond (286.3 eV).21,27,44 The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3c) can be deconvoluted into three different peaks at 398.1, 399.3, and 400.8 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively.6,21 The high-resolution P 2p XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 3d and the peaks located at 135.1 and 134.2 eV can be assigned to the P–C and P–O bonding,45,46 respectively. These results strongly support that the N and P atoms are successfully incorporated into the graphene matrix through a thermal annealing process.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with different CEs are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic and electrochemical parameters for these CEs are summarized in Table 1. It is noted that of the CEs adopted, the NPG CE possesses a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), and an 8.57% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved. And the different Voc values are delivered for a series of CEs. It is well known that the Voc might be considerably affected by the different potentials of I3−/I− redox, which should arise from different catalytic activities of the CEs. Moreover, the PCE of NPG CE is higher than that of the single-component NG (7.94%) and PG (7.69%), and commercial Pt CEs (7.58%), indicative of the synergistic effect of N and P species towards the reduction of I3−, and great potential for Pt replacement. The CV curves of the as-made CEs are shown in Fig. 4b and Table S3,† where two typical pairs of redox peaks (Aox/Ared and Box/Bred) can be clearly observed, representing two reactions (I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−, 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−). It can be noted that the NPG CE has a relatively high Ared peak current density and low Epp (the separation between Aox and Ared peaks), revealing that the as-made NPG have better electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− than the other samples.38,47 To further elucidate the electrochemical characteristics of the NPG and Pt CEs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were performed using symmetrical dummy cell fabricated with two identical electrodes, and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. The detailed parameters obtained by fitting the plots with the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table S3.† Three semicircles can be observed for the as-made NPG in Fig. 4c according to Aksay and co-workers’ theory.48 The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the pore diffusion resistance (Zpore), which indicates the Nernst diffusion impedance resulting from diffusion through the electrode pores. The middle semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), in connection with the electrocatalytic activities of CEs. The low-frequency semicircle is determined by the bulk Nernst diffusion (ZN), while the high-frequency offset determines the serial resistance (Rs) for both NPG and Pt. In the case of Pt, the two semicircles are observed, different from that of the as-made NPG. The reason for this is that Zpore is invisible in the Pt dummy cell due to its nonporous surface. Moreover, we measured the impedance spectra of the NPG symmetric cell at various potentials, and the corresponding curves are shown in Fig. S3.† It is also noted that the Rs of NPG is smaller than that of NG, PG, G and Pt, demonstrating that the bonding strength between NPG and the FTO glass substrate outperforms the other samples, revealing a better conductivity.49 And also, the Rct of NPG is much lower than that of NG, PG, G and Pt, indicative of superior electrocatalytic activity of the CE towards the I3− reduction due to the synergistic effect of the N and P atoms. The high conductivity of the as-made NPG would be attributed to the existing N and P species within the graphene matrix. Fig. 4d shows the Tafel polarization curves recorded by the dummy cells used in the EIS experiment. It can be seen that the NPG CE has a relatively large slope for the anodic or the cathodic branch in comparison to that of the Pt CE, implying a high exchange current density (J0). The high J0 corresponds to low Rct, which is in accordance with the EIS's results.

For practical application of DSSCs, the electrochemical stability of CE materials is also a key issue. We further evaluated the electrochemical stability of the as-made NPG and Pt CEs, and the detailed results can be obtained in Fig. 5. The Rct of the NPG dummy cells scarcely changes after fast CV followed by repeated EIS measurements in comparison to Pt. This indicates that the as-made NPG owns a better electrochemical stability. Besides, we also explored the influence of annealing temperature on the performance of NPG CEs, of which the results are shown in Fig. S4.†

The electrochemical tests were repeated ten times. (c) Rct changes of NPG and Pt CEs versus the EIS scan number. 
Conclusions
In summary, nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene was successfully synthesized via a ball-milling process, followed by thermal annealing approach using C3H6N6 and (C6H5)3P as the N and P source, respectively. It is noted that N and P atoms have been incorporated into a graphene framework via covalent bonds and more defect sites are produced derived from N and P. We have employed NPG as the CE material for the first time and such a metal-free material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the I3−/I− redox reaction. Dual-doping of N and P heteroatoms can synergistically enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs and a high conversion efficiency of 8.57% is achieved, which is superior to Pt CE, and much higher than that of the simple-component N- or P-doped graphene electrodes. Besides, the NPG CE also shows outstanding electrochemical stability. The present strategy provides a simple method for configuring a low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for reduction of I3− in DSSCs.
