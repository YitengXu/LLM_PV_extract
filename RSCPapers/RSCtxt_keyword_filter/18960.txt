In recent years, progress in manufacturing and functionalizing carbon nanotubes has been made to achieve the control of bulk and surface properties including the wettability, acid–base properties, adsorption, electric conductivity and capacitance. In order to gain the optimal benefit of carbon nanotubes, comprehensive understanding on manufacturing and functionalizing carbon nanotubes ought to be systematically developed. This review summarizes methodologies of manufacturing carbon nanotubes via arc discharge, laser ablation and chemical vapor deposition and functionalizing carbon nanotubes through surface oxidation and activation, doping of heteroatoms, halogenation, sulfonation, grafting, polymer coating, noncovalent functionalization and nanoparticle attachment.

1. Introduction and scope of this review
Since Iijima found that either multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) or single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were generated during the synthesis of fullerenes by arc discharge,1,2 carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have undoubtedly become one of the headlines of nanotechnology due to their fascinating properties that contributed to various applications such as polymer reinforcements, energy storage materials, gas storage materials, sensors, electronics and catalysis.3,4 Besides arc discharge,1,2 a number of laboratorial and industrial synthesis methods including laser ablation,5 chemical vapor deposition,6,7 flame synthesis,8–10 pyrolysis,11,12 electrolysis,13 electron or ion beam irradiation,14,15 template methods16 and solar approaches17 are employed to manufacture CNTs. Both the microstructures and macrostructures of CNTs can be well-designed. For instance, in addition to MWNTs and SWNTs, a carbon nanobud, a novel material for excellent field emitters, is formed by covalently bonding fullerene to the external walls of CNTs.18 The fullerene buds serve as molecular anchors that prevent the slipping of nanotubes in composites. Carbon peapods,19,20 with interesting magnetic properties21 and oscillator applications,22,23 consist of fullerenes trapped inside the channels of CNTs. The cup-stack CNTs which contain stacking structures of graphene layers is a newly created semiconductor material.24 Graphenated CNTs are hybrids of exfoliated graphite or graphene grown along the sidewalls of CNTs, enhanced super capacitor performance can be obtained due to the large surface area and high charge density provided by the graphene edges.25–28 In terms of macroscopic shaping, CNT balls are synthesized by emulsion methods and demonstrate better super capacitor performance than CNT films.9 Buckypapers are produced by self-supporting entangled assembly of CNTs where sizes and shapes are easily controlled.29 As the catalyst support, the high external surface area and absence of internal pores of buckypapers largely improve the diffusion of reactants and products, and subsequently increase the catalytic activity and selectivity.
The application of CNTs as a catalytic support in heterogeneous catalysis dates back to 1994.30 CNTs demonstrate great capabilities to serve as substitutes for conventional catalyst supports owing to their considerable advantages: (a) high electrical conductivity,31 impressive mechanical32,33 and thermal stabilities;34 (b) tolerance against poisoning effect;35,36 (c) flexibility of modulating the specific surface area, 50 to 500 m2 g−1 for MWNTs and their internal diameter from 5 to 100 nm;37 (d) possibility of shaping the macroscopic morphology of the support;38,39 (e) possibility of changing their chemical composition (nitrogen-doped or boron-doped CNTs);40–42 (f) possibility of fine-tuning the specific metal–support interactions;43,44 (g) flexibility of functionalizing the surfaces and thus to change the hydrophilicity, pH, electron donor–acceptor properties and specific chemical properties of the surface;45 (h) more resistant to changes by aqueous hydrolytic effect compared to other conventional support materials such as silica. Currently, a large number of transition metals and metal oxides have been coated onto the CNT surfaces to form catalysts for various catalytic reactions. The wetness impregnation method is the most widely used technique, which comprises the deposition of a liquid precursor of the coated material, followed by calcination and/or reduction to prepare the catalysts. The electrochemical coating method is commonly used for electro-catalytic applications.37 The catalytic activity significantly depends on the particle sizes and size distributions of the active phases. Additionally, the identity of the support, whose main role is to disperse and immobilize the active phases and control the sizes of active phases, is of paramount importance in determining the catalytic performance. The chemical state and electron density of the active phases may be influenced by the interaction between active phases and catalytic support. Moreover, the catalytic selectivity is also affected by the nature of the support such as the acid–base properties.46
Functionalization is a useful means to modify the interactions between the support and the active phase as well as the interactions between guest molecules and catalysts.47 Functionalization is also capable of fine-tuning the various properties of the catalytic support including electron donor–acceptor properties, conductivity, acid–base properties, interfacial properties and so forth. Therefore, the development of surface functionalization procedures makes it possible to fabricate versatile catalysts and obtain the optimal catalytic behavior according to the demand. The commonly used methods for functionalization include surface oxidation, grafting of organic groups or macromolecules, doping of heteroatoms, chemical or electrochemical coating of polymers or nanoparticles, irradiation functionalization, plasma activation and so forth.
In this review, recent synthetic methods for manufacturing CNTs and the major developments concerning functionalized CNTs as a support for catalysis are presented, focusing on: (a) the various strategies employed to functionalize CNTs and their impact on properties; (b) effectiveness and efficiency of the applications of functionalized CNTs, especially for catalysis; (c) the catalytic performance of these catalysts based upon CNTs with or without functionalization; and (d) characterization techniques for detecting the properties of the pristine and functionalized CNT based materials.
2. Synthetic methods of CNTs
2.1 Arc discharge
The arc-discharge technique is used in the presence of an electric arc between two closely spaced carbon electrodes distanced 1 mm apart under an inert ambience of helium or argon,48 at reduced pressures ranging from 50 to 700 mbar. A direct current from 50 to 120 A driven by a potential of around 30 V generates a high-temperature (>3000 °C) plasma within the space between the two graphite electrodes48 and sometimes the electrodes are made of graphite powders mixed with catalysts.49 In this plasma region, the graphite electrodes gradually vaporize and rapidly condense to grow CNTs along with some other carbonaceous by-products. The simplest setup for the arc discharge technique is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Simplest set up of the arc discharge technique for CNT synthesis, adapted from ref. 48, permitted by Springer-Verlag, copyright 1998. 
The temperature in the plasma region is extremely high and thus the carbon is vaporized and the electrode is eroded and consumed. Then the anode requires to be continuously translated in order to keep a constant distance between the two carbon electrodes. Through controlling the voltage between 30 and 35 V and the separation of the two electrodes, it is possible to decrease the fluctuations of the plasma. Either evaporation of pure graphite or evaporation of graphite with metal is applicable.48
There are recent studies on non-vacuum local arc discharge using a liquid substance such as ethanol50 or deionized water51 as the medium. Stainless steel electrodes, silicon substrate, nickel mesh catalyst were employed for growing CNTs using ethanol as the carbon precursor (Fig. 2). The as-grown CNTs were filled with linear nickel which may have potential to be applied as a significantly improved magnetic force microscopy probe.50 A multi-electrode arc discharge system without catalyst immersed in deionized water was developed for the formation of CNTs. The yield of MWNTs using the multi-electrodes system was reported to be 320% higher than that of single plasma electrodes, and the purity has been improved as well.51 Liquid nitrogen was also utilized as the plasma medium surrounding the graphite electrodes for the synthesis of CNTs.52,53

2.2 Laser ablation
The principle of the laser-ablation technique is similar to arc discharge. A laser source is utilized to create high temperature on a carbon target. The sublimed carbon is rapidly cooled down in an inert gas stream such as helium or argon to generate CNTs and other carbonaceous by-products.54 Laser ablation enables the defined chirality (10,10) structure of high-purity CNTs.
The arc discharge and laser ablation techniques have the advantage of growing CNTs with superior quality in contrast to the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The general descriptions, conditions, advantages and disadvantages of these three processes are summarized in Table 1. However, arc discharge and laser ablation methods are confronted with limitations in the scale-up of CNTs production due to their harsh reaction conditions. For instance, vacuum conditions are required at high temperature in arc discharge and laser ablation, making them difficult and expensive to scale up. Moreover, the graphite electrodes and targets have to be continuously replaced during the synthesis, and thus the laser ablation and arc discharge techniques could not be operated continuously.

2.3 Chemical vapor deposition
CNT mass manufacture is mainly through the CVD method using transition metal catalysts,55e.g., Fe, Ni and Co to crack the gaseous hydrocarbon feed into hydrogen and carbon, followed by the carbon dissolved into metal nanoparticles until the carbon-solubility reaches the limit and the as-dissolved carbon precipitates and extends outside in the form of a crystallized cylindrical network.56 During the growth of CNTs, the metal particles may be rooted at the tip (tip growth)57 (Fig. 3(a)) or at the base of CNTs (base growth) (Fig. 3(b)),58 determined by bulk diffusion or surface diffusion, respectively. It is also dependent upon the strength of metal–support interactions: CNTs generally grow via the base-growth mechanism due to a strong metal–support interaction, or via the tip-growth mechanism because of a weak metal–support interaction. Iron and alumina usually have high bonding energy between each other. Nevertheless, detachment of iron and alumina was observed by Qian et al., indicating other reaction parameters, such as hydrocarbon presursor, catalyst, temperature, pressure, gas-flow rate, deposition time and reactor geometry, may influence the growth mechanism of CNTs.59 There are also other mechanisms to explain some outstanding observations including the endothermic decomposition of CH4 and the “Y” junctions of carbon fibers.56,60–62 Formation of SWNTs or MWNTs is determined by the size of the metal catalyst. With particle size around a few nm, SWNTs are formed and the particles larger than 10 nm favour the formation of MWNTs.63

Many CVD alternatives have been established, including fixed beds,64–68 fluidized beds,7,69–73 aerosols,74–76 floating catalysts,77–79 and combination methods80–84 such as plasma-enhanced80,81 and laser-assisted CVD techniques.82–84 The hybrid systems combining CVD, laser ablation and arc discharge are capable of improving the quality and yield in contrast to conventional CVD techniques.85–87 However, they obfuscate the fundamental scale-up and hence the hybrid reactor systems are confronted with the same scale-up problems which restrict arc discharge and laser ablation methods. Moreover, the hybrid synthetic techniques bring in several new parameters such as laser power, ion strength and type of plasma to the pre-existing parameter variables. The simplest form of schematic diagram for the experimental synthesis of CNTs by the CVD method is shown in Fig. 4.

The typical catalysts for the CVD process are prepared on a substrate using sol–gel methods,88 impregnation techniques,89 metal–organic CVD approaches,73 or co-precipitation90 methods. There are also in situ methods, such as the substrate-free decomposition of volatile metal–organic compounds within the reactor, which is known as the floating catalyst method.91 The catalyst precursors may be in the form of solid, liquid or gases, which can be suitably located in the reactor or alternatively fed from outside. Generally, the substrate-supported catalysts are located in the high-temperature zone of the furnace to catalyze the CNT growth.92 Metal nanoparticles have also been used directly in the reactors to synthesize CNTs.93 The reaction of CNT synthesis is initiated by introducing a hydrocarbon gas feed stock, usually at temperatures from 500 to 1000 °C. CNTs grown on the catalyst are collected after cooling the reactor to room temperature. When using liquid hydrocarbon such as benzene and alcohol as the carbon source, the liquid feed stock is heated and purged by an inert gas flow which carries the hydrocarbon vapor into the reaction zone. In the case of solid hydrocarbon as the CNT precursor, it is directly located in the low-temperature zone of the reactor. Volatile materials such as camphor, naphthalene and ferrocene can directly convert from solid to vapor, and subsequently undergo the CVD process while passing through the catalyst in the high-temperature zone.92
The most commonly used carbon sources are methane,94–96 ethylene,93,97 acetylene,98,99 benzene,100 and xylene.101 Tian et al. reported the pyrolysis of benzene at 700 °C to synthesize CNTs,100 whereas Li et al. reported the growth of CNTs using the pyrolysis of both acetylene and xylene at 800 °C.101 Iron-based catalysts were employed in those cases. Meanwhile, CNTs were also produced from other precursors such as cyclohexane.102 SWNTs were first made by Dai et al. from carbon monoxide at 1200 °C using molybdenum as the catalyst.103 Afterwards, SWNTs were also grown from benzene,104 acetylene,105 ethylene,106 methane,66,107 fullerene108 and so forth. A low-temperature synthesis of ultrapure SWNTs from alcohol catalyzed by FeCo/zeolite has been investigated,109 and since then, alcohol has become one of the most popular CNT precursors in the CVD method.110,111 The advantage of ethanol as a precursor for CNT is that it makes CNTs free of amorphous carbon due to the etching effect of the hydroxyl radical.112 Subsequently, vertically-aligned SWNTs were synthesized using MoCo/quartz and MoCo/silicon as the catalyst.113,114 Maruyama's group also reported that the intermittent stock of acetylene can assist ethanol in preserving the catalytic activity and hence improving the growth rate of CNTs.115 Using water-assisted CVD synthesis, the ethylene grown SWNTs on Si substrates can be free of impurities.116 Appropriate supply of water steam in the reactor can serve as a weak oxidizer which selectively gets rid of amorphous carbon without interrupting the growth of CNTs. To prolong the lifetime of the catalyst, it is essential to control the content of ethylene and water. The molecular structure of the carbon feed stock plays a critical role in the morphology formation of the CNTs. Linear hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethylene and acetylene) thermally decompose into atomic carbon or linear C2 or C3 forms, and then generally grow into straight hollow CNTs. Whereas, cyclic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, xylene, cyclohexane and fullerene) grow into relatively curved CNTs often with bridged structures inside the tube walls.117,118 These studies substantiate that the CNT precursor plays a vital role in CNT synthesis. Consequently, appropriate selection of the CNT precursor and reaction conditions can increase the lifetime of catalysts, CNT-growth rate, quality and yield.
During the CVD synthesis of CNTs, the most widely-used catalysts are iron, cobalt and nickel owing to the high solubility of carbon atoms in these metals as well as the high diffusion rate of carbon in these metals at high temperatures. Moreover, both the low equilibrium vapor pressure and the high melting point of these metals enable a wide temperature range of CVD for a large variety of CNT precursors. Other considerations include the strong adhesion of Fe, Co, and Ni with the growing CNTs (compared with other transition metals), which leads to high efficiency in the formation of low-diameter and high-curvature CNTs such as SWNTs.119 Solid organometallocenes (i.e., ferrocene, cobaltocene and nickelocene) are also frequently used as CNT synthesis catalysts since they release metal nanoparticles without a support, making the metal particles entirely exposed to feed stock and increasing the catalytic activity. Generally, the diameter of CNTs can be controlled through tuning the size of metal nanoparticles.120 Catalysts coating on substrates acts as a good technique to afford uniform CNT arrays.121 Other metals such as Cu, Mn, Mo, Cr, Sn, Mg, Al, Ag, Au, Pt and Pd were also reported to catalyze the decomposition of a wide range of hydrocarbons for CNT growth.122,123 The transition metals are not only efficient catalysts in CVD but also in arc-discharge and laser-ablation methods. Noble metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt and Pd) possess low carbon solubility, but can effectively dissolve carbon for CNT growth when the particle size is less than 5 nm.124,125
The morphology and surface textural properties of support materials largely influence the quality and yield of the as-grown CNTs. Catalysts located inside zeolite nanopores lead to narrow diameter distribution and high yields of CNTs.126,127 As a catalyst support, alumina was reported to be better than silica due to the strong metal–alumina interaction which enabled high metal dispersion and prevented metal nanoparticles from agglomeration,128 resulting in graphite particles and defective MWNTs.129,130 There were also metal-free catalysts for CNT growth including nano-diamond,131 oxides132,133 and semiconductors (e.g., Si, Ge and SiC).134,135
The CVD process is conducted at a wide range of temperatures, i.e., from 500 to 1200 °C. The feed stock does not decompose below 500 °C. When the temperature reaches 550 °C, short tubes evolve at a remarkably low growth rate, which would abruptly increase at 600 °C. TEM observation reveals that the CNT diameters increase as the temperature increases. Clean CNTs free of metallic impurities are produced at 750 °C, indicating that the catalyst–support interaction is strong enough to keep the metal particles affixed to the support, and the CNTs growth is mainly through the base-growth process. At higher temperatures, the CNTs gradually incorporate more metal particles, usually encapsulated at CNT tips, implying the presence of both the tip-growth and base-growth at critical temperatures due to the inhomogeneous dispersion of metal particles. Larger metal clusters may leave the support with the growth of CNTs. When the temperature is above 750 °C, the CNTs diameter and diameter-distribution increase radically since the metal atoms aggregate into larger clusters, resulting in thicker CNTs at high temperature; the higher carbon precursor decomposing rate also leads to thicker walls at this temperature. From 850 °C and onward, SWNT forms more rapidly as the temperature increases with the existence of MWNTs formation. High temperature favors SWNTs indicating the high formation energy due to its small diameter, high curvature and high strain energy. In contrast, low temperature favors the formation of MWNTs with the optimized temperature value being 650 °C for the FeCo/zeolite catalyst. Such a low temperature leads to CNTs almost free of metal impurities. On the other hand, the optimized temperature for the formation of SWNTs is 900 °C on the FeCo/zeolite catalyst.126 The pressure of gaseous carbon precursor can be directly controlled by the gas flow rate.136 In the case of liquid hydrocarbon, the vapor pressure is controlled by heating at a certain temperature before it is pumped into the reactor.137 For a solid hydrocarbon precursor such as camphor, the vapor pressure is controlled by optimizing three parameters of camphor mass, vaporizing temperature and the flow rate of carrier gas.126

2.3.1 CVD in fixed-bed reactors. 
The most traditional and simplest mode for CNTs synthesis via CVD is the fixed-bed reactor using a horizontal furnace with a cross-flow setup as shown in Fig. 4. Typical investigations use less than 1 g of catalyst. Using more catalyst, concerning the fixed surface area of the boat-shaped quartz holder, would deepen the bed depth, resulting in diffusion limitations and hence decreasing the activity of the catalyst. Kathyayini et al. have discussed this issue,138 where the amount of CNTs produced using 1 g of catalyst was similar to that acquired using 0.5 g of catalyst. Zeng et al.139 observed that the CNTs yield increased over 3 times by using two quartz boats loading the catalyst same as a single quartz boat, doubling the contact area of the catalyst with the same amount of catalyst. Therefore, larger contact areas facilitate better yields in most heterogeneous systems. With increased contact surface area, sufficient mixing can be achieved to eliminate diffusion limitations. As a consequence, fluidized-bed reactors, which can satisfy all these requirements, have been explored for the CNT mass production. Parameters and results of CNTs synthesis by fixed-bed CVD methods in some investigations are summarized in Table 2.64–67,138,140–143

2.3.2 CVD in fluidized-bed reactors. 
The fluidized-bed CVD occurs in a bed of particles mixed with a continuously upward-flowing fluidizing gas. Fluidized-bed CVD operation is the most widely used commercial manufacture of CNTs because of its advantages, i.e., good energy, mass transfer, ability of handling particles continuously and efficient scale up over traditional process such as the fixed-bed CVD reactors. Freestanding CNTs possess essential applications in the fields of composite materials, electronics and energy-storage devices. Fluidized-bed CVD reactors make the CNTs mass production cost effective. Besides, owing to the similar advantages, fluidized beds have many other applications in industry such as chemical waste incineration,144 power plant boiler systems,145 biomass gasification,146 and solids drying system.147 The sufficient mixing in well-designed fluidized-beds facilitates the system to be close to homogeneous throughout, without a stagnant area. Consequently, the entire surface areas of catalyst particles are exposed to feed gas and participate in the reaction, leading to a higher yield per unit weight of the catalyst superior to the fixed-bed reactors. Meanwhile, a uniform temperature distribution is attainable in a fluidized bed reactor for the good heat transfer, which is vital for the CNT quality control.148 A schematic diagram of a typical fluidized-bed CVD setup is demonstrated in Fig. 5. The system consists of a cylindrical fluidized-bed reactor fixed inside a furnace, with temperature and pressure control and a data-logging system. The off-gas scrubbing setup is employed for the environmental impact mitigation system as well.

In most heterogeneous reactions, the higher contact area between the catalyst and reactants is more beneficial to chemical reactions, affording higher overall efficiency, which is also applicable during CNT synthesis. Larger surface areas are obtained by using nanoparticles, and thereby, nanoparticle fluidized beds have been extensively investigated. However, the fluidization of particles smaller than 1 μm is far more complicated than those larger than 100 μm. The high surface area and mobility of nanoparticles result in increased cohesion between particles. Hence, the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate in order to diminish the overall surface energy. In general, nanoparticle fluidization is achieved with the presence of such agglomerates. External forces such as vibration, ultrasonic or acoustic waves, and direct stirring have been employed to disintegrate nanoparticle agglomerates in order to assist in fluidization.149 However, these assisted techniques have not been employed in CNT synthesis. Formation of nanoparticle agglomerates has been undoubtedly observed during CNT synthesis in fluidized beds. It was reported by Wang et al. that the CNT agglomerates were in the form of loose agglomerates.150 Hao et al. observed an increase of agglomerate size with reaction duration in the CNT synthesis, from 125 μm at 9 min to 497 μm at 195 min.151 This observation is in agreement with Wang et al.,150 when investigating SiO2 nanoparticle fluidized beds. Another interesting observation by Hao et al. is that during the CNT synthesis with nano-agglomerate catalysts, the early CNT growth breaks the agglomerates and tears them apart; further CNT growth expands the agglomerate structure. The agglomerates sized between 400 and 500 μm were observed to be stable under fluidization conditions.151 The presence of large, loose and light nanoparticle agglomerates is essential to nanoparticles fluidization as well as the scale-up and synthesis of CNTs using a fluidized bed CVD method. The fluidized bed CVD conditions and results obtained from some studies are summarized in Table 3.59,93–99,151–155

2.3.3 Laser-assisted CVD. 
Laser-assisted CVD is usually applied to synthesize high-purity CNTs. There are many kinds of laser source. Infrared laser heating has been developed for synthesis of uniform CNTs. By adjusting laser power and focused beam spot, local illumination and heating to high temperature are enabled for CNT growth in the reaction zone. Prompt synthesis of MWNTs is successfully achieved. The infrared laser-assisted CVD method affords uniform temperature distribution which does not require overall heating as in conventional CVD methods and it prevents many of the devices from being damaged by overheating. The as-grown uniform and foam-like CNTs possess potential in sensor applications.84 Recently, continuous wavelength CO2 laser-assisted CVD has been frequently used to synthesize CNT films on a silicon substrate.156 This process may have beneficial applications in fabricating CNT sensors on integrated circuits for improved performance.83


2.3.4 Plasma-assisted CVD. 
In recent years, the plasma-assisted CVD approach has caught great attention. It is an efficient technique to synthesize CNTs and causes little damage to devices.157 A wide range of plasma sources including microwave discharges, hot filament, dc-glow discharges, RF capacitive coupled plasmas and RF inductively coupled plasmas have been used to assist the typical CVD synthesis of CNTs from feedstock mixtures such as CH4 or C2H2.158 The microwave-assisted CVD was developed to fabricate vertically-aligned SWNTs on a silicon substrate with pulsed arc plasma together with a Co–Ti electrode.159 An enhanced microwave plasma-assisted hot filament CVD gives higher density SWNTs with high purity, and plasma-enhanced thermal CVD can lead to CNT arrays as long as 0.3 mm with the diameter from 3 to 5 nm.160 Large area aligned CNT arrays were synthesized by RF plasma-enhanced CVD161 and inductively coupled plasma-enhanced CVD techniques.162 Another RF plasma-enhanced CVD process using gaseous methylene and hydrogen was applied for the synthesis of vertically aligned hydrogen-functionalized CNTs.163 The comparisons among different plasma sources and conditions for plasma-enhanced CVD synthesis of CNTs have been summarized.158


2.3.5 Aerosol-assisted CVD. 
Aerosol-assisted CVD uses catalysts prepared by aerosol methods. For example, ferrocene dissolved in toluene was nebulized and vaporized using an injection generator to form aerosol at a constant aerosol injection rate and introduced by argon flow into the tubular reactor in the ambience of gaseous CNT precursor and hydrogen.164 The growth of CNTs in the gas phase possesses an advantage of continuous formation of high-purity CNTs. Nevertheless, these gas-phase grown CNTs were highly agglomerated due to the high reaction rate. They have broad size and length distributions because of the continuously changed size and shape of catalytic particles in the gas phase. Thus, controlling the diameter of gas-phase formed CNTs via controlling the size of the injected catalytic particles is a critical challenge. Moon et al. reported a combination of spray pyrolysis and thermal CVD method via firstly ultrasonically nebulizing the dissolved catalytic precursors with a rapid supply of the nitrogen carrier gas, followed by passing it through a silica-gel-assisted drying process and then mixed with hydrogen gas flow to decompose the metal precursor into metallic catalyst nanoparticles upon heating. These sprayed catalyst nanoparticles were introduced into the high-temperature reaction zone for the decomposition of acetylene to form CNTs. This method leads to highly pure length-controlled CNTs without agglomeration.76


2.3.6 Floating catalyst CVD. 
In a floating catalyst CVD method, the catalyst can be driven into the hot reaction zone using a syringe after the catalyst dispersed in carbon feed stock or by vaporization of the catalyst at high temperatures or even by using a gaseous catalyst source such as Fe(CO)5.165 Eliminating the presence of a catalyst support promotes the direct and sufficient contact between the catalyst and the CNT precursor in the gas phase in order to obtain higher reaction activity of the precursor decomposition to grow CNTs. These floating catalysts usually include organometallic compounds especially metallocenes such as ferrocene and metal–CO complexes such as Fe(CO)5.165


2.3.7 Environmentally friendly CVD. 
Besides the commonly used hydrocarbons mentioned above as carbon precursors, CNTs can also be produced from other carbon-containing compounds such as carbon dioxide, polymers and camphor. Using carbon dioxide helps reduce the greenhouse effect, while using plastic waste and camphor waste favors the waste recycle, atom economy and energy efficiency, especially camphor as a regenerative carbon feed stock from tree products.
Supercritical CO2 was successfully employed as a CNT precursor in the presence of magnesium at 1000 °C and 10 kbar.166 Alkali metals (e.g., Li and Na) were used as the reducing agents for the CO2-grown CNTs at 600 to 750 °C. CNTs with different morphologies including double helical, rope, porous, and bamboo structures were observed with different reducers.167 In the presence of sodium borohydride as a reducing agent, it formed conventional CNTs at 600 °C, while the Y-junction CNTs were formed at 700 °C.168 The hydrogen was found to be vital for the structural formation of Y-junction CNTs.169 Reduced metallic bearing ferrites have been investigated by Khedr et al. for CO2 reduction to form CNTs during the re-oxidation of different freshly reduced ferrites with oxygen deficiency.170–173 Some transition metals such as iron have been employed to catalyze the CO2-growth CNTs under a H2 atmosphere.174
A large amount of the waste produced all over the world consists of polymers from plastics. Catalytic pyrolysis of polymers such as polypropylene,175 polyacrylonitrile176 and poly-furfuryl-alcohol177 was reported to synthesize CNTs. Vertically aligned CNTs synthesized by a two stage polypropylene pyrolysis were reported by Yang et al.178 In this particular process, 0.1 g of ferrocene was located in a quartz reactor and gasified, followed by 2.0 g of polypropylene already located in a different part of the reactor pyrolyzed at 450 °C. Eventually, the temperature was elevated to 800 °C for the growth of a CNT array in the CVD zone. Gaseous argon and hydrogen (50:3 vol%) were pumped into the reactor. The as-synthesized CNTs were scraped off for further investigation. In another study, polypropylene pyrolysis not only produces CNTs but also hydrogen. In this two-step process shown in Fig. 6, polypropylene was first pyrolyzed in a screw kiln reactor catalyzed by HZSM-5 zeolite before the condensed liquid products from the resulting vapors decomposed in a moving-bed reactor catalyzed by nickel.175 Several polymer precursors, affixed to commercially-available Al2O3 templates with certain pore size, have been carbonized at 400 to 600 °C to obtain MWNTs of desired diameter without catalysts.179 As for SWNT, carbonization of tripropylamine within the channels of aluminophosphate crystals afforded the smallest nanotubes with a diameter of 0.4 nm.180 Pyrolysis of other organic compounds such as amino-dichloro-striazine on cobalt-patterned silica substrates provided high-purity CNTs.181

High yield of CNTs was produced from camphor, a regenerative agricultural product. Reaction conditions for this environmentally friendly source of carbon have been investigated for MWNTs183,184 SWNTs,185 and aligned CNTs on Si and SiO2 substrates186 catalyzed by ferrocene. High-yield mass production of CNTs was attained by camphor pyrolysis CVD catalyzed by a FeCo/zeolite catalyst.187 MWNTs were obtained at a low temperature of 550 °C, while SWNTs were obtained at a high temperature of 900 °C. Because of the significantly small amount of catalyst required for camphor pyrolysis, the obtained CNTs are least metal contaminated and the oxygen atoms in camphor favor the oxidization of amorphous carbon. These characteristics of camphor attracted considerable attention. Andrews et al. investigated the effect of the molecular structure of camphor on the CNT growth.188 Researchers also investigated different ways of catalyst feeding in camphor CVD; and discussed the catalyst activation and deactivation during the highly-dense aligned CNT growth.189 Tang et al. prepared tree-like multi-branched CNTs through camphor CVD and studied the impact of temperature, Ar flow rate and catalyst amount on the structure of carbon nanotrees.190 Musso et al. optimized the CNT growth parameters and obtained a millimeters-thick large area of CNT mats.191 Due to all these merits, camphor CVD has already been successfully scaled up for industrial manufacturing of MWNTs in Meijo Nano Carbon Co. Ltd, Japan. A quartz tube, with a length of 2 m and a diameter of 0.25 m, installed in a well-designed rotary kiln is employed as the CVD reactor. Catalysts with zeolite and camphor are, respectively, fed into the reactor from the right and left sides, simultaneously via two speed-controlling feeders. The reactor is slightly inclined and revolved about its axis in order to make the zeolite powder on the right end slide down the slope until it arrives at the left end of the reaction zone. Consequently, CNTs would grow on the zeolite powders. The freshly produced CNTs fall into a reservoir at the left side. This camphor CVD system runs continuously with an average production rate of around 1 kg h−1 and a purity of MWNTs of around 90%. Concerning the extremely low price of camphor of $10 kg−1 and the high price of CNTs of $100 kg−1, the production cost is low accompanied with high profit. Therefore, camphor turns out to be a promising and the most efficient CNT precursor. Furthermore, it opened up a new prospect of exploring many other botanic products for the synthesis of CNTs.92
Green grass is another interesting CNT precursor in the CVD process. Grass consists of vascular bundles in the branches and stems, mainly comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Prompt heat treatment at 600 °C under a well-controlled O2 atmosphere can dehydrate and then carbonize the vascular bundles into CNTs.192 Therefore, it is nearly possible that any carbon-containing substance may be a CNT precursor under appropriate conditions. The experimental conditions need to be changed according to the component of raw materials. The impurity elements would contaminate CNTs and consequently these novel and interesting precursors including garbage materials for CNT production will remain long-term challenges.

3. Functionalization of CNTs
3.1 Surface oxidation
Oxygen-containing groups, such as ketone, phenol, lactone, carboxyl group, ether, acid anhydride, etc., are usually introduced on CNT surfaces by controlled oxidation (see Fig. 7).197 These oxygen-containing groups can improve the hydrophilicity or wettability of CNT surfaces in polar solvents including water. On the other hand, these oxygen-containing groups can serve as anchoring sites for subsequent functionalization by covalent, electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. In the field of composites, appropriately oxidized CNTs play a better role as mechanical reinforcements due to the more sufficient dispersion and enhanced interface interactions by the surface oxygen-containing groups compared to the pristine CNTs.198,199 Considering electrochemical applications, oxygen-containing groups such as quinone and hydroquinone are redox active sites, affording larger capacitance of CNTs.200 Additionally, appropriate amounts of oxygen-containing groups such as carboxylic acids are important to the electrochemical performance of CNTs due to lowering of the activation energy and facilitating electronic transfer on surfaces. Excessive oxidation has a negative effect on CNT conductivity.201 The extent of oxidation is determined by the strength of oxidants and oxidation conditions. Common oxidants include nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, permanganate, hypochlorite, persulfate, hypochlorite, chlorates, dichromate, oxygen, ozone and nitric oxide.202–205 The oxidation conditions must be appropriately controlled in order to prevent corrosion and structure disruption of the CNTs backbone. A mild oxidant makes it possible to adjust the surface properties.206 Different types of oxidants or different oxidation conditions introduce surface oxygen groups with different population. For instance, air oxidation generates more phenol and less lactone or anhydride groups,207 while gaseous nitric acid oxidized CNTs possess more CO than liquid nitric acid oxidized CNTs.208 Nevertheless, these oxygen-containing groups are unstable at high temperature. The amount of oxygen-containing groups obviously decreases with the increase of temperature,200 releasing CO2, CO and H2O molecules, which can be examined by temperature programmed desorption (TPD).209 Heat treatment favors the decrease of surface acidic groups (such as carboxylic acid, lactone and phenol) and increase of surface basic groups (such as chromene, pyrone, quinone and hydroquinone), since the basic groups are formed as a result of the decomposition of acidic groups under an inert atmosphere at high temperature.210
 Fig. 7  Schematic diagram with possible surface oxygen-containing groups on an oxidized surface layer of CNTs. Adapted after Fanning et al.197 
The most widely used oxidant for carbon materials is either concentrated or diluted aqueous nitric acid,204,208–214 which is also a useful method for CNTs purification as it removes amorphous carbon and metallic impurities.200 Nitric acid is an efficient and controllable oxidant for the formation of surface groups, simply by controlling the temperature, acid concentration and oxidation duration. Thus, this oxidation process has also been employed for surface functionalization of CNTs, generating oxygen-containing groups especially carboxyl groups and surface charge.208–211 Nevertheless, excessive oxidation results in structural degradation and oxidation debris which is known to influence dimensions of CNTs, surface properties as well as chemical and biological dispersion and stability.215 In the case of long CNTs, the oxidation debris might bring about bundling of CNTs by sticking CNTs to each other, and removal of the debris would favor the dispersion of the tubes. For short CNTs, oxidation debris are likely to favor sufficiently dispersed, micelle-like structures in various media.216
Oxidized CNTs are usually adopted as purified catalytic supports,200 providing oxygen-containing groups as anchoring sites of functionality immobilization during further surface functionalization.211 The presence of oxygen-containing groups facilitates the dispersion of smaller metal nanoparticles, enhances the metal–CNT interactions, enlarges the electrochemical active surface area and therefore achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, in comparison with the surface group-eliminated CNTs support.200 However, compared to oxidized CNTs support, the promoted CO electro-oxidation activity in CO stripping voltammetry is determined by the high conductivity of the pristine CNT support, implying that oxygen-containing surface groups may hamper the electro-oxidation of CO molecules and lead to higher potential for CO oxidation.200,217
3.2 Doping heteroatoms
An efficient approach to dope heteroatoms such as boron and nitrogen on CNTs is usually accomplished during the one-step CNT synthesis. In the case of synthesizing N-doped nanotubes, the mixture of hydrocarbon and ammonia218 or hydrocarbon and organic amine219 or simply pure organic amine220 is adopted as the carbon and nitrogen source, slowly flowing with argon into a heated quartz tube furnace with a quartz or ceramic boat inside which is filled with an iron-containing catalyst.218–220 For the synthesis of B-doped CNTs, organic borane is used instead of organic amine, following the same CVD process as the synthesis of N-doped CNTs.219 The P-doped CNTs are synthesized via the same CVD method using organic phosphine as the phosphorous source instead.221 Similar CVD methods are reported for sulfur doping on CNTs surface as well.222 A detonation-assisted CVD technique is also adopted to prepare compartmentalized bamboo-like N-doped CNTs using CNTs as the catalyst. A mixture of CNTs, picric acid and melamine is put in a sealed stainless steel pressurized vessel, followed by the detonation induced by external heating to 310 °C, occurring on a microsecond shock wave at 40 MPa pressure and 900 °C temperature.223 Nitrogen plasma deposition is also employed as a technique to generate N-doped CNTs.224–226 Arrays of aligned N-doped CNTs can grow vertically on Si(100) facets via the aerosol-assisted catalytic CVD (CCVD) method. A quartz tube inserted into a heated tubular reactor is filled by nitrogen gas; the silica substrate is located in the center part of the tube. The mixture of ferrocene, and metal carbonyl dissolved in acetonitrile is injected into the quartz tube. The pyrolysis is performed under a nitrogen flow and aligned N-doped CNTs are formed vertically on the Si substrate.227 In addition to Si, alumina can serve as the substrate for growth of aligned N-doped CNTs as well.228 Besides, graphene can also be utilized as the substrate for synthesizing arrays of aligned N-doped CNTs, using reduced graphene oxide supported Fe3O4 as the catalyst instead of the ferrocene, and metal carbonyl.229
Doping heteroatoms is an efficient method to fine-tune the structural and electronic properties of nanotubes.230 Nitrogen atoms can contribute additional electrons and fast electron transfer, leading to the easy occurrence of protonation of nitrogen. The protonated nitrogen can induce negative charges on adjacent carbon atoms, thus enlarging its electrode capacitance that makes N-doped CNTs an excellent material for super-capacitors.227 The enhanced electron density endows N-doped CNTs good field emission characteristics for field emitters.231 Besides improving the conductivity and electron transfer rate, nitrogen doping can also increase the electrochemically active surface area of CNTs for usage as electrodes in thermo-electrochemical cells232 and fuel cells.233 Nitrogen doping and its disruption of the carbon lattice impact the electronic properties and, as a result, the concentration of nitrogen atoms greatly determines the electro capacitance, conductivity, density of state and morphology of the N-doped CNTs.234 The pristine, N-doped and B-doped CNTs possess different surface vacancies and different interactions with gas molecules which can be applied for gas sensing detectors.219,235 The heteroatoms also cause some defects and active sites onto the surface of nanotubes, resulting in greater reactivity than that of pristine CNTs.230 The N-doped CNTs were utilized for immobilizing hemoglobin, and the functionalized electrodes exhibited favorable bio-electro catalytic activities for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide236 and oxidation of glucose.237 Additionally, N-doped CNT modified glassy carbon electrodes have been proved to show promising electro-catalytic performance for the oxidation of dopamine and ascorbic acid.238 The nitrogen- and phosphorous-doped CNTs are active metal-free catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane due to the expedited electron transfer between graphitic sheets and reactive radical sites in the presence of n-type dopants such as N or P functionalities. However, boron performs in contrast because of its electron-deficiency.221 Moreover, the N-doped CNTs demonstrate remarkable basic properties attributed to the pyridinic nitrogen, although there are many other nitrogen types such as oxidized pyridinic nitrogen, quaternary nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, making N-doped CNTs metal-free catalysts for Knoevenagel condensation,41 acetone aldol condensation, acetic acid decarboxylative condensation, hydrogen sulfide selective oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction.239 For catalyzing oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, graphitic nitrogen plays a paramount role in improving CNTs activity through facilitating the activation of oxygen and diminishing the total activation energy of the reaction.240 Doping sulfur via the CVD method forms distorted sidewalls on CNTs, since sulfur favors the generation of pentagon and heptagon carbon rings. Sulfur dopants create more active sites on CNT surfaces for catalysis. In addition, sulfur dopants can improve the nitrogen-doping content on CNTs, as a result of heterocyclic rings, which facilitate the enhancement of nitrogen-doping. The magnetic property of CNTs is also enhanced by sulfur-doping, attributed to the improved encapsulation of ferromagnetic species, and the enhanced soft magnetic property of CNTs is promising for applications in the fields of magnetic data storage and electromagnetic wave-absorbance.222 Doping sulfur and/or selenium in the nitrogen-doped graphene–CNT composite also affords metal-free catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Particularly, the additional selenium-doping exhibits significantly enhanced oxygen reduction activity with high methanol tolerance as well as durable stability in acid media in contrast to Pt/C.241,242
As a catalytic support, both the N- and B-doped CNTs are favorable to metal precursor adsorption on their surface with different mechanisms. Dopant nitrogen atoms enhance metal adsorption via activating carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen atoms, as a result of the strong electron affinity to nitrogen. In contrast, the improved metal adsorption on boron-doped CNTs is primarily ascribed to the strong hybridization between the metal d-orbital and the boron p-orbital, causing direct bonding between the metal and boron atoms.243 The platinum adsorbed on the N-doped CNT surface presents promising catalytic performance for methanol electro-oxidation.244 N-doped CNT-supported iron is an excellent Fischer–Tropsch catalyst with high selectivity for short-chain olefins, decreased chain growth probability, and superior long-term stability.245 Moreover, the nitrogen species on CNTs can act as anchoring spots for the immobilization of highly dispersed bimetallic particles. It is substantiated by the nitrogen-doped CNTs as a favorable support of the PtRu/N-CNT catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation owing to the better dispersion of bimetallic nanoparticles and the excellent electrochemical properties of N-doped CNTs.224 Metal particles supported on N-doped CNTs possess a higher catalytic activity than CNTs. The general order of catalytic support efficiency is ranked as N-doped CNTs > CNTs > conventional supports. N-doped CNTs enhance the electron density, meanwhile increase the basicity and the presence of CNT-N + :H protonated sites. The expedited electron transfer from N-doped CNTs to metal particles leads to metal activation and the formation of metal–support bonds. Besides, the CNT-N + :H protonated sites can serve as immobilization spots for metal particles.246
3.3 Alkali activation
Activation via heating with alkali or CO2 is used to change the texture of carbonaceous materials, increasing the specific surface area and pore volume.247–251 This method is also adopted to activate CNTs. The mass ratio of KOH and CNT was set at 4:1, activating at 600, 700 or 800 °C under nitrogen flow for 1 h. The activated CNTs were rinsed by diluted HCl aqueous solution to remove alkali species prior to the filtration, followed by drying at 100 °C. The as-prepared activated CNTs provided a larger specific surface area and pore volume, and enhanced hydrogen storage capability and hydrogen migration property.252 In addition, the conductivity and electrochemical performance of alkali activated CNTs are proved to be superior to that of pristine CNTs as electrode materials for supercapacitors.253
3.4 Sulfonation
Carbon materials functionalized with sulfonic acid have been developed to be environmentally friendly solid–acid catalysts for esterification, rearrangement, dehydration and condensation reactions.254,255 Sulfonation of CNTs can replace liquid acids in certain catalytic reactions, capable of being reused several times. The sulfonation is conducted by allowing the carbon materials to come into contact with the vapor from 5 mL of 50 wt% SO3/H2SO4 at 60 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave, then washed with hot deionized water (>80 °C) to remove all species that are physically adsorbed until the sulfate ions are no longer detected in the filtrate.256 Another technique of sulfonation is through reacting CNTs with ammonia sulfate. An ammonia sulfate solution was agitated with an appropriate amount of CNTs, prior to heating at 235 °C for 30 min. Decomposition of ammonia sulfate generates SO3 which forms surface –SO3H groups.257,258 The sulfonated Pt/CNT catalyst displays better electro-catalytic performance than the unsulfonated counterpart, indicating that sulfonation is an efficient way to improve the performance of Pt/CNT-based electrodes.258 The surface sulfonation increases the proton conductivity as a result of the decrease in charge transfer resistance in the oxygen reduction reaction.259 Besides, some organic sulfonic acid functionalized CNTs possess well-tuned interfacial properties, which eliminates aggregation and assists the incorporation of CNTs into a PbO2 film, affording high electro-catalytic activity and prolonged electrode life span.260
3.5 Halogenation
Surface fluorination was attempted to promote the hydrophobicity of carbon surfaces. Fluorine was functionalized onto carbon surfaces via a variety of methods.261–263 Fluorinated CNTs were directly synthesized using an appropriate amount of CNTs at 350 °C in a fluorine gas atmosphere for 12 h.264 Another fluorination method is preloading CNTs on a nickel boat in the fluorination reactor and degassed at 200 °C for 2 h, followed by injecting the argon diluted fluorine gas flow into the fluorination reactor for 10 min at 30 °C.265,266 Moreover, fluorination can also be achieved by coating fluorocarbon monomers (e.g., CF4 and C3F8) onto CNT surfaces in a microwave plasma reactor.267 Fluorination makes the CNT surface hydrophobic enough to be adhesive and dispersed in an epoxy matrix. Fluorinated CNT as a cathode largely improves the performance of Li–O2 batteries compared to the unfluorinated CNTs, which is attributed to the dual reactions at the electrode and the presence of the defects on the fluorinated CNTs, thereby enlarging the surface area and the amount of catalytically active sites for oxygen reduction.264
Bromination of CNT is a useful method to generate anchoring groups on CNT surfaces for the subsequent substitution of a number of nucleophiles such as alcohols, amines, anilines and thiols, etc. Halogenation with bromine is through direct treatment of CNTs with bromine at high temperature over Lewis acid catalysts.268 The highest bromine intercalation yield was found in the presence of aluminum bromide in di-n-hexyl ether at 200 °C for 2 h, intercalating between 10 at% and 22 at% total Br on CNTs,268 which can be compared to the plasma bromination method where 15 at% Br was introduced.269
3.6 Grafting
A broad range of surface functional groups can be introduced onto CNT surfaces through the post grafting approach (Fig. 8). In many of these methods, the CNT surface already possesses certain surface functionalities, which can be further substituted by other organic groups. The pre-existing functionalities are usually formed by oxidation of CNTs via boiling with nitric/sulfuric acid. Functional groups can also be bonded directly onto CNT surfaces.
 Fig. 8  Grafting reactions to functionalize CNTs surface via covalent bonds. See the context and specific references for more details. 

3.6.1 Grafting via oxygen-containing groups. 
On oxidant-treated CNT surfaces, carboxyl groups react with thionyl chloride to form acyl chloride groups, which is a versatile intermediate for a wide range of organic groups. The acyl chloride can react with cysteamine by amidation, grafting thiol groups. In coordination with thiol groups, metal particles can attach onto the sidewall of CNTs, serving as sensors and catalysts.270 Another example of using acyl chloride is to graft chitosan on CNT surfaces to afford a novel CNT–chitosan composite which shows potential for application in bone tissue engineering. First, 0.5 g of degraded chitosan was reacted with 0.02 g of K2S2O8 for 20 h before adding 0.0555 mol of lactic acid for another 2 h. The reaction was then quenched by adding 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran followed by freeze-drying. The dried sample was rinsed with methanol and the as-prepared product was reacted with the acyl chloride pre-treated CNTs in acetic acid at 75 °C for 24 h under vigorous stirring before rinsing with acetic acid to remove unreacted chitosan.271L-Lysine can react with acyl chloride via amidation to form lysine or poly-lysine grafted CNTs, which is proved to have enhanced wettability to deposit and disperse titanium dioxide nanoparticles; the resulting composite afforded improved photo-catalytic activity for the methyl orange degradation reaction.272 Besides the amidation reaction, metal organic salts can react with acyl chloride groups. For instance, the reaction between magnesium chloride dithiopropanoate and acyl chloride groups on CNT surfaces leads to the formation of CNT chain-transfer agents that can be applied in reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization.273 Taking advantage of the esterification based on the carboxyl groups on CNT surfaces, a number of groups can be grafted. For instance, the imidazolium functionalized CNTs have been prepared and the obtained nanohybrid composites containing organometallic complexes are highly efficient and effective heterogeneous hydrogen transfer catalysts for the cyclohexanone reduction in the presence of 2-propanol as the hydrogen source.274
The hydroxyl groups formed from oxidatizing CNTs can be employed to graft silane onto CNT surfaces. Aminosilane, especially the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, is a frequently used modifier, capable of improving the modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break of CNT reinforced composites.275–278 The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized CNTs were also reported with promising CO2 absorption capacities and selected as the CO2 adsorbents for the study of cyclic CO2 capture.279,280 A certain amount of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane dissolved in acetone was mixed with oxidized CNTs dispersed in water at 80 °C for 30 min under vigorous stirring. The silane-functionalized CNTs were separated by filtration using distilled water and acetone before drying overnight.275,276 In addition, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane has been bonded onto CNT surfaces via a post-synthesis method for further loading of Pd nanoparticles, which affords the improved catalytic performance in the solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol using O2.281 Silanes such as 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane282 and γ-glycidyloxypropyltrimethylsilane283 are adopted as coupling agents for good dispersion, interfacial interaction and reinforcement effect of CNTs in nano-composites.282,283 Moreover, the well-dispersed Pt and Pt–Co alloys on silane-modified CNT surfaces exhibit good electrochemical catalytic activity as cathodes in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell.284
Besides reflux with oxidants, the oxygen-containing groups on CNT surfaces can be created by air or O2 plasma.285–287 O2 plasma is effective for CNT surface modification without causing any severe CNT structural damage by tuning the plasma treatment conditions.285 These introduced oxygen surface groups are employed to immobilize bio-macromolecules such as enzymes, antibody and deoxyribonucleic acid for sensing and catalysis applications.286,287


3.6.2 Grafting via diazonium compounds. 
Diazonium compounds have been attempted for directly grafting aryl or aryl derivatives onto CNT surfaces. It is a versatile grafting approach by using diazonium compounds.288 In a typical aqueous solution-based grafting process, the reaction between diazonium salts and CNTs is a free radical chain reaction primarily initiated by the diazoanhydride homolytic decomposition and partly through direct oxidation of CNTs by diazonium compounds. Aryl radicals can be covalently bonded to CNTs once they are formed. In an experiment investigating the reaction mechanism, a diazonium compound was dissolved in water before adding it into an aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of SWNTs in a quartz cuvette at 27 °C. The system as monitored by visible and near-infrared spectroscopies simultaneously.289 Nevertheless, the diazonium salts were unnecessarily prepared prior to the functionalization since the in situ generation of diazonium compounds during CNTs functionalization can be achieved via the simple one-pot reaction of CNTs, aniline derivatives and nitrite.288,290–295 For example, heptadecafluorooctyl phenyl group functionalized CNTs were prepared following these procedures: 460 mg of heptadecafluorooctyl aniline was dissolved in 50 mL of acetonitrile; 250 mg of CNTs were dispersed in 50 mL of DMF and subsequently mixed these two suspensions together, followed by heating to 60 °C under vigorous stirring then adding 2 mL of isoamyl nitrite. The reaction continued at 60 °C overnight, followed by vacuum filtration and rinsing by DMF and methanol.292 The as-synthesized heptadecafluorooctyl phenyl functionalized CNTs possess promising suitability for sensing applications.292
In other cases, functionalization using diazonium compounds undergoes the following electrochemical methods. CNTs act as the working electrode and diazonium compounds are dissolved in the KCl and HCl aqueous electrolyte.296–299 The functionalized CNTs via electrochemical diazonium grafting enhance the ionic diffusion of the CNT membranes.298,299 Diazonium salt functionalization favors the electron transfer kinetics across a wide range of potentials. Through adjusting the electrochemical conditions, applied potential as well as the type of diazonium salt, it is possible to get an electrochemical charge transfer rate over metallic SWNTs 104 times higher than that of semiconducting SWNTs.297 Application of diazonium salts in spinning of CNTs is assisted by adding a surfactant to form a negatively charged CNT surface for great interaction with the positively charged diazonium.300,301 The CNT yarns with diazonium salt functionalization demonstrate better tenacity and strength compared to the untreated CNT yarns.300 Additionally, the diazonium salt grafted carboxyphenyl groups can react with multifunctional reactive compounds such as hexa(methoxymethyl) melamine, constructing highly crosslinking polymerization within the yarns, enabling higher tensile strength, Young's modulus and therefore load transfer efficiency.301


3.6.3 Grafting by Prado's reaction. 
Prado's reaction, briefly the 1,3-dipolar cyclo-addition of the azomethine ylides forming pyrrolidine rings, has been reported to be an interesting functionalization process on surface of carbonaceous materials based on the stable bonding of functional groups with carbon surfaces.302–305 The formed pyrrolidine rings consist of two covalent C–C bonds belonging to the carbon surface. This technique was also applied for CNT functionalization.306–311 In a typical reaction, CNTs were dispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Under an argon atmosphere, 3-thiophenecarboxaldehyde was added to the mixture, followed by addition of a calculated amount of N-methylglycine extremely slowly. After adding N-methylglycine, the reaction was left to continue for another 24 h before cooling, filtration, washing and drying.307,310 The as-prepared functionalized CNTs are often used in surface polymerization307,310 or are incorporated into a composite matrix.309 The Prado's reaction functionalized CNTs with specific organic groups have particular applications. For instance, zinc porphyrins covalently grafted to the side walls of SWNTs via Prado's reaction favoring the efficient intramolecular charge separation and intermolecular electron transfer and therefore lead to applications in solar energy conversion.311


3.6.4 Other grafting methods. 
Although several grafting approaches have been studied for CNT surface functionalization, there are still some other grafting methods usually performed on carbon surfaces and can be attempted to functionalize CNT surfaces. Direct functionalization of carbon materials is achieved via a one-step reaction. Activated carbon was mixed with amines, alcohols or thiols for a solvent-free reaction under microwave irradiation, and the organic groups directly linked to the double bonds. The microwave-assisted reactions were carried out under moderate conditions since the duration was less than 100 min and temperatures below 200 °C.312 Cyclic nitrones can be covalently bonded to the CNT surfaces via the cycloaddition reaction between cyclic nitrons and CNTs under sonication,313 as shown in Fig. 8. Carbon black was directly functionalized with phenyl, nitrophenyl and phenylazoaniline by reacting with aniline precursors, nitrite and acid.314
A number of methods are capable of generating amine-functionalized carbons for subsequent formation of amide linkages through an amidation reaction or modification of surface properties. Amino groups can be introduced via reduction of carbons pre-treated by nitrate together with acetic anhydride, sulfuric acid and fuming nitric acid.315 The reduction forming amino groups from the nitro groups was realized by adding ammonia and sodium hydrosulfite. Diamines treatment can efficiently afford the amine-functionalized CNT surfaces as well, using a microwave-assisted approach316 or by reacting diamines with pre-existing acyl chloride groups as mentioned previously. It has also been reported that nitric acid pre-treated carbon fibers can be grafted with amine groups via reaction with tetraethylenepenatamine, forming single or multiple bridges on carbon surfaces.317
Surface acidic groups can be converted into basic surface groups such as amine and pyridine groups via high-temperature treatment under the anhydrous ammonia atmosphere. This procedure resulted in corrosion of carbon surface as well. In the case of carbon fibers, samples burdened the weight loss while the nitrogen content, specific surface area, pore volumes and pore diameters have been enlarged. A direct reaction between ammonia and phenolic fiber precursors is possible, proving the ammonia-etching effect on the carbon fiber surfaces.318
Free radical reactions initiated by UV exposure are also applied for covalently grafting functional groups onto carbon surfaces. This UV-initiated free radical reaction undergoes in hydrogen plasma when carbon with alkene attached to C–H terminated carbon surface under the extended exposure under UV light.319 In a practice of this technique, a thin carbon film was grafted with trifluoracetic-acid protected 10-aminodec-1-ene and the functional groups were used as anchoring sites for DNA after removing the protecting groups.319 This approach provides a covalently stable functionalized interface.
Electrochemical grafting of functional groups onto carbon surface is possible in the cases of diaryliodonium compounds, besides diazonium compounds mentioned perviously. Taking glassy carbon electrodes for example, the functional groups can be grafted via this process include both electrophilic and nucleophilic groups such as carboxylic acids, nitro, chlorine, bromine, hydrogen and methyl groups.320 Another grafting method has also been established for glassy carbon associated with the electrochemical functionalization using 4-aminobenzoic acid.321 Functionalization of hydroquinone onto CNTs through the phenol electro-oxidation method was reported. Upon the nitric acid treatment of CNTs, this material was affixed to the working anodic electrode and immersed into the liquid mixture of phenol and phosphate buffer solution. Then it was cycled with the potential ranging from −0.2 to 0.6 V at the rate of 50 mV s−1 for twenty cycles using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. After rinsing and moving to another fresh pH 7 phosphate buffer solution for the stabilization via potential cycled 20 times from −0.2 to 0.6 V using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, the surface coverage of hydroquinone was determined by the integrated peak area of the corresponding surface-confined redox peak in the cyclic voltammogram.322 Although experimental details of these grafting methods highlighted above may be different for the cases of CNTs, the mentioned examples could provide good inspirations for covalent grafting of organic groups or organic metal complexes on CNTs.

3.7 Polymer coating
An enormous number of polymers have been coated on CNT surfaces. By coating CNT surfaces with polymers, the surface properties can be significantly tuned in order to modify the wettability, conductivity, electron capacitance, adsorption properties, etc. Moreover, the formed CNT–polymer composite may drastically improve the mechanical strength of the material.
For graphitic carbon materials, grafting polymers onto surfaces is through carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups that serve as anchoring sites, bonded at the corners and edges of the poly-condensed aromatic rings on graphitic layers or onto carbon atoms at defect positions. This process is also applicable for CNT functionalization with the pre-existence of oxygen-containing groups or defects on CNT surfaces. In cases of carboxyl groups, dendrimer-functionalized CNTs have been reported based upon the presence of carboxyl groups transformed to the acyl chloride groups through thionyl chloride treatment before the subsequent acyl chloride groups reacted with terminal amino groups of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) (Fig. 9(a)). Another study about the functionalization of CNTs is via lipophilic and hydrophilic polymers with a typical amidation or esterification reaction (Fig. 9(b)). The lipophilic oligomer-functionalized CNTs can be dissolved in hydrocarbon or weakly polar organic solvents, whereas the polyethylene glycol grafted CNTs can be dissolved in either organic solvents or aqueous solution.323,324 Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-grafted CNTs were formed through a reaction between surface carboxyl groups and PVA along with a condensing agent such as N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Fig. 9(c)). The PVA-functionalized CNT composite films are reported to afford great optical quality.325 The grafting of CNTs using amino-containing polymers reacting with acyl chloride on CNT surfaces, similar to organic groups functionalization in the presence of acyl chloride mentioned previously, has been investigated.326 The amino polymer-grafted CNTs consequently prepared are soluble in common organic solvents and in water. The poly(m-aminobenzene sulfonic acid) (PABS) has been grafted onto CNTs by reacting CNTs with the pre-existing acyl chlorides (Fig. 9(d)). The as-prepared PABS-grafted CNT displays an improved electrical conductivity.327 Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-grafted CNTs have been synthesized by reaction of acyl chlorides on CNT surfaces with the monoamine-terminated PEO (Fig. 9(e)).328 The long alkyl chain grafted onto CNTs has been obtained by the reaction between acyl chloride groups and long chain aliphatic amine (e.g., octadodecylamine and 4-dodecylaniline) (Fig. 9(f)).329

Besides, the poly-condensed aromatic rings of pristine CNTs act as radical scavengers and therefore the grafting of polymers onto CNT surfaces can be accomplished via the strong radical trapping effects.330 This involves a change of the hybridization form from sp2 to sp3 and meanwhile results in a loss of π-conjugation on CNT surfaces. The polymer radicals generated via the decomposition of polymer initiators such as azo polymers or peroxy polymers can be trapped by the graphitic sheets of CNT surfaces (Fig. 10).330 Living polymer radicals generated by the thermal decomposition of corresponding TEMPO end-capped polymers lead to well-controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution of the polymer grafted on CNTs (Fig. 11).331 The γ-ray radiation formed polymer radicals are reported to successfully graft onto carbon surfaces which may be available for CNTs as well (Fig. 12).332 In addition to the radical initiated surface polymer grafting or polymerization, the ring-opening polymerization is another facile approach for polymer grafting onto CNT surfaces. For example, the p-dioxanone ring-opening polymerization is commonly initiated by metal–alkoxide complexes (e.g., tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct)2)). Accordingly, the biodegradable poly(p-dioxanone) grafting on the surfaces of CNTs is carried out by ring-opening initiated surface polymerization (Fig. 13).333

Electrochemical polymerization is also a readily available approach for polymer-functionalization of CNTs. For instance, the electro-polymerization of aniline in HCl solutions with SWNT films as the working electrode and the potential ranges between −200 and +700 mV was carried out. Polyaniline covalently functionalized SWNTs can be obtained by two successful methods. One is the electrochemical polymerization of aniline directly onto the SWNT working electrode in an aqueous HCl electrolyte. The other is using the aqueous ammonia post treatment on polyaniline-functionalized SWNTs, which involves a redox reaction of polyaniline (emeraldine base) with SWNTs, converting the polymer from the semi-oxidized state to a reduced state.334 Preparation of the polyaniline–MWNTs composite through direct aniline oxidation polymerization has also been reported.335
Functionalization with polymer grafting onto CNTs is for the sake of application in composites,336,337 fuel cell electrodes, super capacitors,338,339 catalysis340 and so forth. In composites, polymer functionalization is aimed to alter the interfacial interactions and dispersion of CNTs in polymer matrices, improving the mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of composites.336 For fuel cells,340 polymer-functionalized CNTs have been attempted as electrolyte materials. For example, polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) have been found to be excellent due to their high proton conductivity without humidity. Because of the strong interaction between PBIs and CNTs, PBIs can uniformly cover the surfaces of CNTs, which makes them promising for composites, and additionally the PBI-functionalized CNT surfaces can serve as effective anchoring sites for platinum nanoparticles (Fig. 14). This Pt/PBI/CNT electro-catalyst has been used for membrane electrode assemblies of either proton-exchange or anion-exchange fuel cells.340

3.8 Non-covalent functionalization of CNTs
To preserve the sp2 CNT structures and thus their electronic characteristics, non-covalent functionalization methods have been employed, usually based upon the π–π interactions between CNTs and guest molecules containing aromatic rings341,342 or unsaturated bonds.343 Chen et al. reported the CNT sidewall functionalization with protein simply by the π–π stacking. The CNTs were firstly functionalized with 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimidyl ester utilizing the strong π–π interactions between CNTs and the pyrenyl group. Then the nucleophilic substitution of N-hydroxysuccinimide through an amine group on the protein took place, resulting in the formation of an amide bond.341 Pd nanoparticles modified with benzyl mercaptan groups were mixed with a CNTs–toluene suspension by ultrasonication during which the aromatic rings were firmly stacked on the CNT surfaces.342 This method was proved to be an effective approach to prepare highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles on CNTs.342 The poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) functionalized CNTs were prepared by untrasonication of the mixture of aqueous PDDA and CNTs, forming a π-stacking structure of the unsaturated double bond onto CNT surfaces. The π–π interaction between PDDA and the CNT helps functionalize the CNT surfaces with the positively charged polyelectrolyte, leading to not only the electrostatic repulsion force between any two tubes, but also increased CNT hydrophilicity and the adhesion to specific substrates such as Au and Si owing to the electrostatic interaction with the Au–O- and SiO-groups.343 Similarly, macromolecules containing π electron systems such as poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene) (PmPV),344 polybenzoxazole,345 maleimide polymers346 and π-electron multi-functional dendrons347 can also be successfully functionalized on CNTs surfaced via physical adsorption or wrapping derived from π–π interactions.
3.9 Metal or metal oxide nanoparticles attachment
In addition to functionalize CNT surfaces using organic molecules, a broad range of approaches have been established to functionalize CNT surfaces with nanoparticles. These techniques can be mainly classified into four categories: nanoparticle dispersion on functionalized CNTs, physiochemical approaches, electrochemical deposition and electroless deposition.348

3.9.1 Deposition on functionalized CNTs. 
Incorporation of nanoparticles on CNTs can be defined as a method of functionalization. Introducing nanoparticles favors the extension of the CNT applications and presents new features such as electrochemical and catalytic activities. Metal oxides and mixed metal oxides are formed by precursors bound on CNTs in the presence of surface functional groups for anchoring metal ions or metal nanoparticles.348 This method is also named as impregnation, a simple and inexpensive methodology, where the most commonly utilized functional groups on CNTs are carbonyl and carboxyl groups. Without surface functional groups as anchoring sites, the nanoparticles formed on perfect CNT surfaces through the impregnation process merely have the particle–support physical interaction which may easily result in leaching and loss of the nanoparticles. Taking MnO2 as an example, the CNT was oxidized with nitric acid, functionalized with oxygen-containing groups. 0.5 g of functionalized CNTs dispersed in 50 mL of toluene and a calculated amount of manganese(II) acetylacetonate dissolved in 50 mL of toluene were separately refluxed at 110 °C for 5 h with a nitrogen flow to remove moisture before the two slurries mixed in a larger flask and refluxed at 110 °C overnight. The slurry was cooled to room temperature, filtered, rinsed and dried followed by annealing under a nitrogen atmosphere at 400 °C for 6 hours.211 These manganese oxide functionalized CNTs are applied as promoted catalytic supports for palladium catalysts in aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol.211 CeO2 and CuO mixed metal oxides were deposited on CNTs pre-treated with nitric acid. CNTs were refluxed in a concentrated nitric acid at 140 °C for one day. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (2 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.5 mmol) and pre-treated CNTs (0.08 g) were dispersed in pyridine (30 mL), sonicated for 30 min. The suspension was transferred into a Teflon-liner autoclave (50 mL), and then placed in an oven at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, it was rinsed several times before drying at 100 °C for 12 h and annealing at 200 °C for 2 h. As a catalyst, the CeO2/CuO/CNT nanowires have a remarkably higher catalytic activity for the CO oxidation than that of either CeO2/CNT or CuO/CNT nanowires.349 Highly dispersed RuO2 nanoparticles on CNTs were prepared via impregnation method with the assistance of NaOH to maintain a stable pH at 7 (Fig. 15). 10 mg of nitric acid pre-treated CNT was suspended in 30 mL of water and treated by sonication for 3 h. An appropriate amount of RuCl3·3H2O was dropped onto the CNT suspension. NaOH was added to maintain the pH value of the suspension stable at 7 followed by refluxing the mixture at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling, the suspension was filtered, rinsed, dried, and then calcined at 150 °C for 6 h under an inert atmosphere. The as-prepared highly dispersed RuO2–CNT composites are applicable as superior electrode materials as well as super capacitors.350 The deposition of metal nanoparticles such as palladium can also be realized in similar ways with the annealing step replaced by the hydrogen gas reduction treatment.211

3.9.2 Physiochemical approaches. 
There are various physical methods to prepare nanoparticle-deposited-CNTs. The physical techniques include evaporation deposition, sputtering deposition and ion and electron beam irradiation deposition. These techniques possess control over the size, shape, dispersion and uniformity of the nanoparticles. Evaporation deposition is carried out by impregnating the CNTs in an aqueous solution containing a metal precursor prior to the removal of water by evaporation, the solid sample is obtained after drying at 100 °C for 12 h. Calcination of the solid sample at arround 400 °C for 4 h or in air yields nanoparticles attached on CNTs.351 Sputtering deposition affords uniformly dispersed metal nanoparticles by choosing appropriate metal cathodes, monitoring the electric current and sample exposure duration. Ion or electron beam irradiation deposition is performed under γ-irradiation and electron beam irradiation to disperse nanoparticles homogenously.348 Metal organic vapor deposition is another solvent-free methodology applied to attach nanoparticles directly onto surfaces of CNTs. The deposited nanoparticles are evenly dispersed with sizes in the range of 2 to 4 nm. A volatile salt of metal catalyst mixed with CNTs forms a homogeneous mixture.352 This mixture placed under an inert atmosphere is then heated until the salt decomposes and allows the metal nanoparticles to deposit onto CNT surfaces.353 Since the metal organic vapor deposition method includes fewer steps, this technique can be applied to form homogeneously dispersed metal nanoparticles on CNTs.


3.9.3 Electrochemical deposition. 
Electrochemical deposition enables the synthesis of metal nanoparticles attached onto CNTs via reduction of metal complexes such as auric chloride acid, platinic chloride acid and ammonium platinic chloride by electrons on cathodes.348 The CNTs act like conducting wires and supports for metal nanoparticle deposition without reactivity with the metal precursors. Changing the parameters including the content of metal precursors, nucleation potential and process duration favors the variation in the size and the uniformity of the metal nanoparticles on the surfaces of CNT.348 Electrochemical deposition possesses the advantage of generating extremely pure metal nanoparticles functionalized on CNTs with strong metal–support interactions, within a short process duration.354 In contrast, the disadvantage of the electrochemical deposition methodology involves the formation of large metal nanoparticles on CNT surfaces, usually ranging from 10 to 100 nm.355 Preparation of nickel nanoparticles on CNTs has been reported. Nickel loading was carried out on functionalized and pristine CNTs through electrochemical deposition, and nickel–CNT hybrids synthesized from functionalized CNTs by acid treatment exhibited a more uniform dispersion of nickel particles than those on the surface of pristine CNTs.356 Altering deposition duration and electric current has a significant effect on the morphology of nickel oxide on CNTs, and homogenously dispersed nickel oxide particles with size ranging from 15 nm to 30 nm on CNTs have been reported.357


3.9.4 Electroless deposition. 
Electroless deposition of nanoparticles on CNTs depends on a chemical reduction process in the presence of reducing agents. Direct reduction takes place between the metal precursors and CNTs during the electroless deposition process.348 However, the application of electroless deposition is restricted by the principle that redox potentials of metal ions have to be higher than that of CNTs and thus can be reduced to nanoparticles on CNT supports.358 This drawback has been overcome by a substrate-enhanced electroless deposition procedure which involves supporting CNTs with a metal substrate possessing a lower redox potential than the targeted metal precursors.348 A Pt/Ru/Mo/graphene–CNTs catalyst has been synthesized via chemical reduction of metal precursors using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent at room temperature.359

4. Characterization
4.1 Bulk characterization

4.1.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
High-resolution solid-state 13C NMR has been well developed to monitor coals and activated carbons. Liquid state proton NMR (1H NMR) was frequently used for detecting either soluble CNTs or insoluble CNTs in suspensions. 2-Azaxanthone functionalized CNT dissolved in [D6]DMSO was monitored by 1H NMR and the anisotropy introduced by CNTs led to changes in characteristic signals of azaxanthyl groups compared with its precursor, implying the successful surface functionalization of CNTs with azaxanthyl groups.360 Thiol-functionalized CNTs suspended in CDCl3 were monitored by proton NMR in order to confirm the surface groups covalently bonded by the successful thiolation reaction.361 Organometallic salt-functionalized CNTs were analyzed by 1H NMR for the shifts of corresponding signals compared with the organometallic precursors, proving the successful surface functionalization.362 Polymer-functionalized CNTs were frequently characterized by 1H NMR363,364 and 13C NMR365 for the confirmation of surface groups. 29Si NMR and 11B NMR were attempted for characterizing Si(B)CN–CNT dissolved in C2D6. The detected signals of Si using the liquid state NMR can be different from the one using solid state NMR for the same sample as a result of the change in the Si magnetic environment caused by long range coupling, possibly due to the presence of B–C or B–N chemical bonds formed by the B-based functional groups.366 Solid state NMR, for instance, the solid state 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR was also employed to detect the CNT channels enriched with benzene in the absence of phenol since phenol was expelled out of the CNT channels. This approach is applicable for the substantiation of the benzene hydroxylation reaction inside the confined CNT channels which demonstrate its feasibility in separating products from reactants.367


4.1.2 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. 
FTIR spectroscopy has been commonly used for determination of surface functional groups on CNTs as well as the CNT based composites. To substantiate the success of surface functionalization, comparison between the spectra of functionalized and non-functionalized CNTs is expedient, according to the appearance or disappearance of characteristic signals of functional groups. For example, the characteristic absorbance bands of benzene rings and sulfonic groups emerged in the FTIR spectrum after surface sulfonation of CNTs.258 1-Octadecanol treated CNTs gave rise to CH2 stretching of the long alkyl molecule at 2920 cm−1 and ether signals at 1473, 1458, and 1068 cm−1 formed from 1-octadecanol reacted with carboxylic groups.368 Surface functionalization of CNTs with polymers such as polyaniline generates FTIR absorbance bands similar to the pure polyaniline.369 The phenol electro-oxidation method can functionalize CNTs with hydroquinone surface groups, whereas the IR bands were similar to the phenol data and it is difficult to decide whether it is phenol or hydroquinone that has been functionalized onto the CNT surface.322 For composites such as the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) functionalized CNTs, the surface groups on CNTs were also characterized by FTIR. The spectrum showed a peak at 1132 cm−1, attributed to the –O– bond inside the PMMA molecule. Additionally, the peak at 1384 cm−1, ascribed to the –OH bond, affirms the presence of PMMA.370 In another case of the CNT-based composite, the FTIR spectra of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) functionalized CNT composite exhibited the signals of phenyl and Ar–O–Ar groups, indicating the presence of PPO.371 As for metal particle (i.e., Au) functionalized CNTs, the FTIR spectrum displayed the characteristic peaks of hydroxyl, carboxyl, acyl chloride and amide groups resulting from the MWNT–COCl connected with the cysteine capped gold nanoparticles.372 FTIR is a convenient approach and has been widely applied for the detection of surface groups, polymers and chemical bonds. However, in the cases of carbonaceous materials, spectra are often of inadequate quality with low signal-to-noise ratios and different background features. This is mainly because of its strong electronic adsorption and the light scattering effects. Therefore, in order to minimize uneven light scattering, the smallest possible particle sizes of samples are required. When samples are mixed with KBr and pressed into pellets, the ion exchange with KBr should be circumvented. There are techniques to improve the spectra quality including attenuated total reflectance and diffuse reflectance methods.47 Assignment regions of several commonly known functional groups detectable by the FTIR technique are listed in Table 4.

Raman spectroscopy is a complement to FTIR since some vibrations that are not detectable by IR can be active in Raman. Most of the Raman characterizations of carbon materials are aimed to determine the proportion of graphitic and disordered carbon, according to the G and D bands centered at or nearby 1590 and 1330 cm−1, respectively.313,369,371 In a typical spectrum, there are three main characteristic bands (D, D′, and G modes) in the region between 1000 and 2000 cm−1, and the overtone and combination bands in the region from 2400 to 3400 cm−1 (G′ = 2D). The G mode (E2g symmetry) is ascribed to the sp2 graphitic structure, whereas the D and D′ (A1g symmetry) modes are caused by the Raman double resonant scattering from nonzero-center phonon modes which are originated from amorphous disorder and defects within the carbon lattice. Consequently, the intensity ratio of ID/IG is frequently calculated as a measurement of the crystallite and amorphous site density.313 The radial breathing modes (RBM) usually range from 100 to 350 cm−1, which are associated with the radial expansion–contraction of the CNTs. Therefore, the frequency of RBM largely depends upon the diameter of nanotubes. The larger the diameter, the lower the frequency will be.377,378

4.2 Surface characterization

4.2.1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). 
XPS can verify the presence, status and amount of oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, sodium, carbon groups, metals such as Pt, Pd and many other components on the surface of carbonaceous materials.373,379 It measures the surface composition of CNTs by determining the binding energy of the ejected photoelectrons from CNTs irradiated by X-rays. Moreover, the surface sensitivity of XPS is determined by the small (less than 10 nm) rigid mean free path of the emitted photoelectrons. Therefore, the elemental composition of the near surface region can be quantified, except hydrogen atoms. Besides the compositional analysis, XPS can also provide information of the chemical environment of surface elements according to the peak-fitting of X-ray photoelectron spectral envelopes, based on the fact that the binding energy of the photoelectron is not only determined by the element itself but also influenced by the chemical environment.373Table 5 lists the binding energies of representative functional groups on CNT surfaces.

4.2.2 Secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). 
SIMS is a surface-sensitive analytical technique. The typical process of SIMS includes a bombardment of samples using high-energy ions, leading to the ejection of neutral species and ions. These species and ions are determined by the nature of surface functional groups. Generally, the static time-of-flight SIMS (ToF-SIMS) only detects the first atomic layer: SIMS is only sensitive toward the few nanometers of the sample surface, whereas XPS probes slightly deeper of the near-surface region than SIMS. The surface sensitivity and selectivity toward large organic ions increase with the increase of cluster ions (e.g., Bi3+, more cluster ions than monatomic; Ga+, monatomic ions). Additionally, ToF-SIMS illustrates more information about surface chemistry,380 especially organic surfaces381 compared to XPS. However, SIMS has the drawback such as the strong matrix effect accompanied with difficult quantitation. The combination of SIMS and XPS measurements can provide more detailed information about surface functional groups.382


4.2.3 Chemical derivatization (CD). 
CD techniques can also be attempted to measure the concentration of some functional groups. CD techniques have been used early for plasma-treated polymer surfaces.383 In recent years, CD has been developed to measure the content of functional groups on carbonaceous surfaces such as CNTs.384,385 In a typical CD measurement, the targeted oxygen-containing surface group reacts stoichiometrically and selectively with a particular derivatizing reagent that has a unique chemical tag. Following the derivatization reaction, the concentration of the chemical tags grafted onto the surface is quantified. Accordingly, the content of the targeted surface functional group is calculated based on the nature of the chemical reaction between the targeted surface functional group and the corresponding derivatizing agent. XPS or other techniques such as fluorescence are usually employed to determine the concentration of the chemical tags. XPS and CD approaches are usually combined, and fluorine atoms are frequently adopted as the chemical tags since F is not seen on the CNT surface. Moreover, F(1s) core level transition possesses a high XP cross-section. However, CD is limited by the size constraints and not all the functional groups can be successfully labelled.


4.2.4 Chemistry titration. 
Accessible surface acid or basic sites are amenable to characterization by chemical titration and acid–base depletion. The oxygen-containing groups on CNTs, usually the protic functional groups, such as ketone, phenol, lactone, lactol, carboxylic acid, and carboxylic anhydride, are neutralized with various base solutions such as NaOC2H5, NaOH, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3, followed by the back-titrating the bases with typical strong acid. Since the acid dissociation constants (pKa) of these protic functional groups differ from each other by several orders of magnitude, titration with bases can help determine the concentration of surface acidic groups with the reference of the specific pKa or pKb data of the corresponding acid or base from titration data.373 Mass titration or electrophoresis is also able to determine the surface charges and isoelectric points of carbon materials.386 Calorimetric measurements of heats produced from the reaction can complement this information.387 Titration is usually accompanied with other characterization techniques such as FTIR. In addition, carboxylic groups can also be assured by chemical-detection methods such as esterification or formation of acyl chlorides using thionyl chloride.386


4.2.5 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reduction (TPR). 
Surface functional groups that release gas-phase products via decomposition at specific temperatures can be characterized by TPD techniques using a differential scanning calorimeter and a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (DSC-TGA) combined with a mass spectrometer (MS).387 Oxygen-containing groups decompose within a certain range of temperatures to form CO, CO2 or H2O. Accordingly, the relative concentrations of oxygen can be calculated through deconvolution of these gas desorption peaks.387 The decomposition activation energies of surface groups can be calculated from the decomposition rates.388 TPR is aimed to study the reactivity of surface groups upon heating by a similar process to that of TPD under a hydrogen atmosphere.389 Reduction takes place on surface complexes which desorb afterwards, leaving active carbon sites exposed to hydrogen for further reaction. It is feasible to determine the identity and amount of surface functional groups from TPR and TPD data.390


4.2.6 Gas sorption isotherm. 
Gas sorption characterizations are usually performed for the measurement of pore texture including surface area, pore size distributions and pore volumes under nitrogen, carbon dioxide or argon atmosphere.47 For CNTs, the nitrogen sorption isotherm is mainly aimed to measure the surface area in order to compare the diameter, length and the dispersion of CNTs, whereas the high-pressure CO2 adsorption–desorption and dynamic sorption determine the gas sorption capacity and structure of CNTs.391


4.2.7 Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). 
The elemental composition of CNTs can be investigated using EELS through measuring the energy loss by incident electrons interacting with CNT atoms, leading to an absorption edge at element-unique energies due to the core–shell ionization events. Therefore, the elemental composition of CNTs can be deducted through analyzing the energy levels and relative intensities of the different adsorption edges. The combination of EELS and imaging techniques can derive the elemental maps of CNT samples. For instance, locations of sulfur atoms were displayed in maps of MWNT after thiolation.392 The combination of EELS and NEXAFS with a tunable X-ray source is commonly used. The NEXAFS can give detailed information about the local bonding environment related to different elements via monitoring the yield toward electrons as the function of incident photon energy. Analogous to EELS, each element generates a variety of energy absorption edges due to core–shell ionizations. Furthermore, the structure of each edge reflects comprehensive structural information about the elemental local bonding environment. Routine usage of NEXAFS is limited by the requirement of a tuneable X-ray source, usually a synchrotron facility. In addition, the NEXAFS spectrum can merely be reliably analyzed under the condition that several chemical states of an element do exist. Thus, when large numbers of species exist, an explicit fitting of any edge spectrum would be extremely difficult as a result of the vicinity of the numerous peak positions.373


4.2.8 Imaging methods. 
Imaging of functional groups on CNTs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is possible only when surface functionalities, such as nanoparticles, are large enough to be resolved. For TEM observation, the target functional group should possess enough contrast against the CNT background. By using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) or electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is possible to map out the chemical composition of the sample surface exposed to the electron beam.
TEM requires a high-energy electron beam to observe CNTs on the basis of electron transmission. The length, diameter and dispersion of CNTs are commonly assessed by TEM at low magnifications. Whereas at high magnifications, TEM is utilized to count the number of walls, measure the lattice distance, evaluate structural integrity and detect structural changes of CNTs.373

5 Performance of CNTs or functionalized CNTs for catalysis
Due to the chemical stability, electronic conductivity, thermal stability, capability to functionalize with chemically or electrochemically active species, CNTs are promising materials for application in catalysis. A large number of reactions have been catalyzed by CNT-supported mono- or multi-component nanoparticle catalysts. Nowadays, the human society is facing the grim challenges brought by the approaching energy crisis along with severe environmental problems. It is the scientific community's responsibility to develop clean and sustainable energy resources as well as environmentally friendly techniques that can ease the current difficult situation. As part of the solutions, state-of-the-art technologies, such as heterogeneous catalysis, photo-catalysis and photo-electrochemical catalysis, and many other strategies have been developed and thoroughly studied. At present, CNTs are playing more and more important roles in relevant research fields. CNTs alone or their composites can be developed into various efficient catalysts that are suitable for diversified sustainable energy and environmental engineering applications. Alternatively, CNTs can also be used as scaffolds or structural supports in the development of other catalyst candidates. At the current stage, it is also important to review the milestones achieved by using CNTs in these promising research areas.
5.1 Heterogeneous catalysis

5.1.1 Hydrogenation reactions. 
CNTs and functionalized CNTs themselves are remarkable non-metallic heterogeneous catalysts for some hydrogenation reactions. For example, the H2O2 functionalized CNTs exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and some substituted nitroarenes, surpassing the catalytic performances of the nitric acid oxidized CNTs.395 In the hydrogenation reactions over CNT supported catalysts,396–404 the advantages of CNT supports include eliminating the inner diffusion resistance of reactants and products,396 the strong metal–support interactions,396 π–π interaction between CNTs and aromatic reactants200 and enhanced reducibility of the catalysts.405 Functionalization of CNTs has a significant impact on the catalytic performance. After the nitric acid treatment of CNTs, surface oxygen-containing groups may retard the reduction of platinum nanoparticles supported on pre-oxidized CNTs, where the surface oxygen-containing groups strongly stabilized the cationic platinum species.406 Removal of oxygen-containing species from CNTs suppresses acid-catalyzed side reactions and expedites electron transfer between CNTs and platinum nanoparticles, consequently improving both the activity and selectivity in cinnamaldehyde (CALD) hydrogenation.200 Whereas, further functionalization with iron and cobalt nanoparticles on CNT surfaces after removing oxygen-containing groups leads to a metal–metal synergic effect and therefore elevates the activity and selectivity in CALD hydrogenation.200 CNT surface functionalization with silica layers via the hydrolysis of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane improves the durability of the Ru/CNT catalyst during the recycling tests of hexane hydrogenation.407 Polyaniline (PANI) functionalized CNT supported palladium nanoparticles are uniformly distributed with remarkable stability due to the Pd–N interactions. The Pd–PANI/CNT catalyst displays high activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of phenol toward cyclohexanone, since the catalytic activity is associated with the conductivity of PANI/CNT, while the selectivity toward cyclohexanone is attributed to the nitrogen-containing basic sites of PANI/CNT. In addition, the strong adsorption of phenol in a “nonplanar” fashion over nitrogen-containing basic sites leads to the active and selective phenol hydrogenation toward cyclohexanone.408


5.1.2 CO/H2 conversion. 
CNTs have been investigated for CO/H2 conversion reactions such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis,409–423 methanol synthesis424 and higher alcohol synthesis.425–428 In contrast to conventional support materials such as silica and alumina, CNTs as catalytic supports remarkably reduce the duration of the induction period, improve the reducibility of the active phase and promote the catalytic activity and stability for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.409,411 Compared to activated carbon and MgO, CNT-supported cobalt affords the highest CO conversion and Co/CNTs–MgO enhances the selectivity toward C5+, the most valuable Fischer–Tropsch synthesis products while it reduces the selectivity toward CH4, the most unwanted product.423 Compared with activated carbon-supported Fe catalysts, Fe/CNT catalysts possess lower selectivity toward methane and high selectivity to olefins.429 The selectivity of the Co/CNT catalyst can be greatly changed if a manganese promoter is applied. The C5+ selectivity is significantly higher while the methane selectivity is diminished and a higher olefin-to-paraffin ratio is obtained compared to Co/CNT without a promoter at 1 bar operational pressure. The manganese promotion effects are dependent upon pressure, since the change in selectivity can be less pronounced or reverted at a pressure as high as 30 bar.430 CNT surface functionalization of oxygen-containing groups through acid treatment opens up the caps, enlarges the BET surface area and introduces defects and acidic functional groups which facilitate diminished cobalt particle size and size distribution and enhance the dispersion of cobalt nanoparticles. Furthermore, the reducibility of the catalyst increases by 10% and 50% upon acid treatment at 25 °C and 100 °C, respectively, and most of the nanoparticles have been homogenously dispersed inside the nanotubes since the cobalt precursor can be introduced into the tubes by capillary forces of CNTs after acid treatment. The Fischer–Tropsch activity and CO conversion efficiency both strongly increase after the acid treatment of the CNT support.431 Acid treatment of the CNT support also improves the catalytic performance of Fe/CNT catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis ascribed to the similar reasons.416
Confinement of cobalt nanoparticles inside CNTs hinders deactivation caused by sintering and cobalt oxidation. However, confinement of reactants or intermediates inside the tubes may increase the contact time between the catalyst and the reactant, incurring the formation of longer-chain hydrocarbons.412 The Co-in-CNT catalyst possesses a selectivity to C5+ of 15.7% and 23% after hydrogen treatment at 300 °C and 400 °C, respectively, whereas the Co-on-CNT catalyst shows a selectivity to C5+ of 31.5% and 26% with the hydrogen pretreatment at 300 °C and 400 °C, respectively. At 300 °C, sintering of Co does not occur either on the surface or inside the CNT channels. However, Co sinters on the surface of CNTs while the Co inside the channels resists sintering at 400 °C.414 A micro-channel reactor system is fabricated based on the aligned CNTs with CoRe/Al2O3 integrated inside the micro-channels of CNTs. This reactor displays an improvement of Fischer–Tropsch activity that is four times higher than those obtained with a similar catalyst system yet without CNT arrays.432 For Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, the activity and selectivity toward C5+ over Fe/CNT catalysts are remarkably higher than over Co/CNT, with Fe/CNT showing selectivity of 40 to 45% while the Co/CNT showing 10 to 20%.433 When iron is encapsulated within CNTs, the Fischer–Tropsch activity is notably improved and the yield toward C5+ obtained over the confined iron is twice that of the iron particle on CNT surfaces. The reducibility of the confined iron catalyst is remarkably enhanced relative to iron on CNT surfaces. Fischer–Tropsch reaction expedites the formation of iron carbide species with significantly higher catalytic activity whereas cobalt cannot form carbide. The trapping of reaction intermediates in CNTs channels may prolong the contact time, leading to the growth of heavier hydrocarbons.434
CNTs have been attempted to promote the catalytic performance of the Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 catalyst for methanol synthesis. This catalyst, containing 10 to 15% CNTs, gives rise to a significant increase in the formation rate of methanol compared to the Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 catalyst without CNTs. The role of CNTs can be attributed to (a) the presence of CNTs allowing a considerable increase in Cu surface area and (b) the function of CNTs for hydrogen storage.424 It is proposed that high concentration of hydrogen species on CNT-based catalyst facilitates hydrogenation for higher alcohol synthesis. In CO hydrogenation to form C2–8 oxygenates over a Co–Cu catalyst, an improved CO conversion has been obtained.427 The strong influence of CNTs on chemical states of metal nanoparticles through the interaction between the CNT support and the Ni–Mo component leads to an increase of the percentage of Mo4+/Mo5+ and NiO(OH), which are two types of catalytic species associated with the selectivity toward C1–3 alcohols, as well as the apparent decrease of the percentage of Mo0 and Ni0, which are two types of catalytic species for selective generation of hydrocarbons, especially methane. Furthermore, the sp2-C sites on the CNT support can contribute to the hydrogen adsorption and activation. These factors give rise to an increase in selectivity toward C1–3 alcohols.426,428 The Ni-functionalized CNT supported Ni–Mo–K catalyst has even better catalytic performance than the CNT supported Ni–Mo–K catalyst in the synthesis of C1–3 alcohols from syngas. Appropriate functionalization of the CNTs with nickel nanoparticles increases the hydrogen adsorption over CNTs, further enhancing their promoter effect.425


5.1.3 Dehydrogenation reactions. 
Metal-free CNTs and functionalized CNTs themselves are effective heterogeneous catalysts for some dehydrogenation reactions.435–437 Zhang et al. demonstrated the high catalytic activity over the short and thin-walled CNTs for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, implying great potential in the styrene industry due to the stable and coke-free catalytic performance of CNTs.435 The activation of C–H bonds on the ethyl group is postulated by the ketonic carbonyl group on CNTs, an appropriate amount of surface oxygen on CNTs favors the activity and alkene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as butane. Further functionalization with phosphorus increases the alkene yield and the catalytic stability far surpasses those of metal oxide catalysts which work well only in the presence of excess oxygen. Functionalization with phosphorus occupying the surface defects suppresses the generation of electrophilic oxygen species and therefore affords a lower overall activity but a significantly better selectivity.436 In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the adsorption of the reactant on the reduced catalyst surface, which is harmful for propene selectivity, can be effectively alleviated by functionalization with an appropriate amount of boron oxide.437
CNT supported catalysts have also been investigated for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, a number of valuable reactions in chemical industries and hydrogen fuel production. Compared to carbon black, activated carbon, graphite, and carbon nano-fibers, CNT supported platinum exhibits the highest yield toward H2 in the microwave-assisted decalin dehydrogenation, due to the relatively small platinum nanoparticles formed on CNT surfaces as well as the high temperature attained by the system during the microwave-assisted dehydrogenation.438 Acid-treated CNTs possess a number of defects and oxygen-containing groups. The defects have been proved to be responsible for the improvement of the platinum catalytic activity in the ammonia borane hydrolysis instead of oxygen-containing groups. After acid treatment followed by an inert atmospheric heat annealing of CNTs, the defect-rich CNT-supported platinum has high catalytic activities, with an exceptional H2 generation turnover frequency as high as 567 molH2 molPt−1 min−1 at 30 °C, significantly higher than those of alumina, ceria or activated carbon supported platinum.439 Because of the electronic properties of the CNT as well as its less acid sites, Co/CNT has higher selectivity to cyclohexanone than Co/activated carbon in cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. Adding K appropriately improves the catalytic performance, due to the electronic promotion effect.440 Nitrogen doping CNTs can efficiently enhance the catalytic performances of CNTs. The N-doped CNT catalysts with an appropriate amount of nitrogen are stable and active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The graphitic nitrogen plays a crucial role in elevating the catalytic activity via lowering the activation energy and accelerating the oxygen activation.240 Surface curvature enhances the CNT electronic properties and leads to electron and charge transfer from CNTs to nanoparticles, which promotes catalytic activity. Oxygen-containing functional groups on CNTs introduce active sites where dehydrogenation occurs, leading to a metal–support synergetic effect. Metal nanoparticles supported on N-doped CNTs have superior catalytic performance to those supported on pristine CNTs, due to the enhanced electron density, basicity and the existence of CNT-N + :H sites. The accelerated electron transfer from N-doped CNTs toward metal nanoparticles facilities the metal activation and the formation of chemical bonds between metal nanoparticles and support.246


5.1.4 Oxidation reactions. 
CNT-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for oxidation reactions. Yu et al. reported the high catalytic activity of CNTs for selective oxidation of cyclohexane and improved catalytic activity was achieved by using N-doped CNTs.441 Pt,442–444 Ru,444,445 and Cu444,446 supported on CNTs have been employed to catalyze the oxidation of aniline and phenol.447 When the oxidation proceeds at a high temperature, the Co/CNT catalyst possesses better conversion than Co/activated carbon for CO oxidation at 250 °C, due to the high thermal stability of nanotubes.448 CNTs have also been applied to support Cu–Zn bimetallic catalysts for partial oxidation of methanol at 260 °C to produce hydrogen.449 CNTs induced growth of vanadium oxide nanorod–CNT composites which are catalytically active for n-butane partial oxidation toward maleic anhydride.450
Surface-functionalization of CNTs can highly promote the catalytic performance of CNT supported catalysts for oxidation reactions. Homogeneously dispersed manganese oxide on CNT-supported palladium catalysts was developed via an impregnation method, and showed improved catalytic performance in aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The role of manganese oxides was implied in three respects: (a) favoring the interfacial electron transfer between Pd and manganese oxide; (b) promoting the oxygen activation via transferring lattice oxygen to the active sites; the oxygen vacancies in manganese oxide were quickly replenished with molecular oxygen; (c) manganese oxide played a significant role in stabilizing palladium ionic species, and preventing agglomeration of metal nanoparticles.211 The CeO2 functionalized CNT supported Pt catalyst possesses superior catalytic performance including both catalytic activity and selectivity for CO oxidation at low temperatures (CO conversion 80% at 350 K) compared to Pt/CNT and Pt/AC. The favorable role of CeO2, as a reducible oxide, has been implied as the result of a reaction mechanism alteration from a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism (CO and O2 molecules compete for active sites on noble metal surface) to a free-competition dual-site mechanism (CeO2 favors the increase of oxygen supply on the metal–support interface, and therefore promotes the CO oxidation) as suggested by Mars et al.451,452 There are other applications of inorganic nanoparticles as functionalities on catalytic supports, where the roles of the functionalities includes to stabilize active phase, modify the electronic properties, enhance metal–support interactions, alter the surface acid–base properties and so forth in order to promote the performance of the corresponding catalysts.453–455 In addition, organic surface functional groups are promising promoters for CNT-based catalysts as well. Sulfur-functionalized CNT supported Pt displays excellent catalytic performance in methanol oxidation, enabling high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles smaller than 3 nm without deteriorating the intrinsic conductivity of CNTs.456 The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane has been reported as superior surface functional groups for CNT supported palladium catalyzed solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol using O2 as the oxidant, along with the high catalytic activity and benzaldehyde selectivity, ascribed to the appropriate enhancement of surface basicity, electron density, metal–support interactions and diminished particle size and size distribution of the palladium nanoparticles as well.281


5.1.5 Ammonia synthesis and decomposition. 
The usage of Ru/C catalysts for ammonia synthesis is an alternative to replace conventional iron-based catalysts used at high temperature and high pressure. Nevertheless, plenty of studies demonstrated the Ru/activated carbon deactivation after a long reaction duration, as a result of metal sintering and leaching. CNTs show a higher thermal stability than activated carbon and Ru/CNT was investigated in ammonia synthesis.457–460 Promising activities have been observed when using Ru–K/MWNT and Ru–K/MgO–CNT catalysts.457,458 The high-extent graphitization of the CNT support is postulated to explain the resistance against the methanation effect of carbonaceous supports.
The ammonia decomposition to produce H2 without CO for fuel cells has attracted great attention, which is more economical than methanol decomposition. Ru is also employed for this particular reaction, and the application of CNTs to support the metal has been studied.461–466 The order of catalytic activities is Ru/CNT > Ru/MgO > Ru/TiO2 > Ru/Al2O3 > Ru/ZrO2 > Ru/AC.464 Highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles with a particle size of around 2 nm have high catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition owing to the basic and conductive CNTs as the catalytic support. Using various basic surface functionalities can further enhance the conductivity and catalytic activities in the order of RuK > RuNa > RuLi > RuCe > RuBa > RuLa > RuCa > Ru.462 Employing conductive supports enables electron transfer from functionalities or support to Ru, facilitating the recombination and desorption of nitrogen atoms,464 which is the rate-determining step. Accordingly, the nitrogen-doped CNT support leads to excellent Ru dispersion and the increased conductivity also contributes to the improved catalytic performance in ammonia decomposition.467 On the other hand, the catalytic performance can be improved by removing electron-withdrawing species.464 In addition, the impact of graphitic structure of carbonaceous supports on the catalytic activity ranged in the order of Ru/graphitic carbon > Ru/CNT > Ru/carbon black > Ru/AC.466 These results have indicated the significance of the conductive carbonaceous graphitic structure which facilitates metal–support electron transfer.


5.1.6 CNT synthesis. 
One vital issue associated with the CNT synthesis over conventional catalysts at industrial scale is the purification step to eliminate the catalysts from the final CNT product. The use of CNT-supported catalysts to produce CNTs has been explored in order to avoid the costly purification step. Besides noble metal catalysts such as Pd or Os which are rarely used in CNT synthesis,468 iron, cobalt and nickel are the most frequently used catalysts supported on CNTs for CNT synthesis.469–473 Fe, Co and Ni supported on SWNTs for acetylene decomposition to grow MWNTs via the CVD method have been investigated.469 The Fe–Mo catalyst supported on CNTs is catalytically active for the high conversion of methane decomposition to produce CNTs of highly ordered morphology.470 Acid pretreatment of the CNT support facilitates higher metal dispersion of Ni–Al catalysts, higher specific surface area and hence enhanced catalytic activity for propane decomposition to synthesize CNTs.471 Nitric acid treatment of CNT as the catalytic support plays a crucial role in nickel deposition and has a positive influence on the performance of the nickel catalyst in CNT synthesis.472 Besides metallic nitrates as metal precursors, ferrocene is also attempted as an iron catalyst supported on CNTs through in situ pyrolysis. This catalyst demonstrates feasibility in a floating catalytically CVD method for CNT synthesis in a nano-agglomerate fluidized bed reactor.473


5.1.7 Dehalogenation reactions. 
For dehalogenation reactions, CNT-supported Pd catalysts were frequently employed to catalyze the hydrodehalogenation of aryl halides, one of the most persistent toxic pollutants because Pd stimulates the cleavage of the carbon–halogen bonds and enables hydrogenation.474–476 The high external surface area of CNTs and the absence of micropores which eliminates mass transfer limitation contribute to the remarkable catalytic activity of Pd/CNTs in the bromobenzene hydrodehalogenation reaction.474 Another method to prepare the Pd/CNTs catalyst for hydrodehalogenation of aryl halides or substituted aryl halides was established on the basis of thiol-functionalized CNTs firmly anchoring with the palladium precursor, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) [Pd2(dba)3].475 Oxidative functionalization of CNTs by concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid under ultrasonication which generates surface oxide groups can favor the dispersion of Pd particles. A higher ratio of H2SO4/HNO3 leads to more amount of surface oxide groups which facilitates higher Pd dispersion, showing a remarkably better catalytic performance in the hydrodehalogenation of bromobenzene.476

5.2 Photocatalysis
In modern chemistry, though constantly debated, photocatalysis is usually defined as a chemical process in which the photo-induced reaction is accelerated in the presence of a certain catalyst.477 Over the past few decades, this topic has attracted tremendous attention from different research fields, including wastewater treatment,478–480 solar water splitting,481–484 photocatalytic disinfection,485–487 self-cleaning coatings488–490 as well as countless other applications. Semiconductor materials, for example TiO2, ZnO, CdS, GaP, Cu2O, Fe2O3, etc., play central and irreplaceable roles in photocatalysis, owing to their unique electronic band structure, which is characterized by an electron-filled valence band and an empty conduction band.491 When these semiconductor materials are hit by photons with energy (hν) equal to or exceeding their band gap energy (Eg), electrons can be promoted from the valence band into the conduction band, leaving electron vacancies, known as “holes”, behind. Along with this process, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs may undergo recombination that converts the input energy into heat, get trapped within metastable surface states, or further interact with surface-adsorbed species. In photocatalysis, the electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band can function as effective reductants and oxidants, respectively, to carry out desired redox reactions in solutions. Furthermore, these charge carriers may react with dissolved oxygen molecules and hydroxide ions to produce superoxide (O2−) and hydroxyl (OH˙) radicals that can be involved in subsequent chemical reactions.491 It is a more recent achievement to introduce CNTs in photocatalysis, such as TiO2-based photocatalytic systems.492 The astonishing mechanical properties of CNTs493 make them ideal candidates to support various photocatalysts. In addition, their large specific surface area494 may provide abundant sites where reactants can adsorb, hence drastically enhancing the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the surface properties of CNTs can be tailored through functionalization, as discussed in previous chapters. These functional groups, such as ketone, alcohol, phenol and acid moieties, may improve the adsorption of specific species, which in turn improves the selectivity of photocatalytic reactions.492
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most thoroughly studied photocatalysts among the numerous reported semiconductor materials, owing to its abundance, ease of synthesis, excellent stability and well-recognized biocompatibility.495 Different polymorphs of TiO2, primarily based on rutile and anatase, have been extensively studied in varied photocatalytic systems to meet distinct purposes, such as degradation of hazardous organic wastes in water or air, production of H2 as next-generation fuel and inactivation of bacteria or viruses. However, the efficiency of pure TiO2 crystals in photocatalysis is significantly limited by their poor visible-light absorption capability, due to their relatively large band gaps (>3.0 eV). In order to produce effective electron–hole pairs, TiO2 has to be activated using ultraviolet (UV) light, which takes up only ∼5% of the total solar spectrum. On the other hand, the chemical interaction between charge carriers and adsorbed pollutant species generally takes place at timescales of 10−8 to 10−3 s, apparently longer than the typical charge recombination timescale, which is on the order of 10−9 s.491 Many different strategies, such as doping with metal/non-metal ions, sensitization with organic dyes, coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors, incorporation of electron acceptors, etc., have been utilized for tuning the properties of TiO2 to extend its visible light response as well as to retard the recombination process.496
The combination of TiO2 and CNTs may provide promising solutions to address the aforementioned issues in photocatalysis, and their mixtures and composites have received considerable attention in recent years. These functional materials have been employed for photodegradation of phenol,497,498 acetone,499 benzene,500 azo dye,501,502 or dyes,503–507 oxynitride,508,509 other organic pollutants,510 photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water511 and water–alcohol mixtures,512 and carbon dioxide reduction with water.513 TiO2–CNT composites can be prepared by sol–gel,511,513 hydrothermal methods,513 or ultrasonic irradiation.499 CNTs in the system make it possible to obtain a higher surface area than that of TiO2 powders, avoid agglomeration of TiO2 and obtain strong interface interaction facilitating adsorption501 and electron transfer. The reported optimal content of CNTs in the composite is from 10% to 20% in order to obtain good catalytic efficiency.497,499 Over the critical value, the photo-catalytic activity declines, as a result of the higher absorbing and scattering of photons by the CNTs in the photo-reactive system.
Woan et al. have summarized some possible mechanisms of photocatalysis enhancement brought about by CNTs, as shown in Fig. 16.492 The first one is a modified version based on the mechanism proposed by Hoffmann et al.,491 in which the enhancement is attributed to the preferable electronic properties of CNTs (Fig. 16(a)). It has been reported that CNTs have large electron-storage capacity (up to 1 electron per 32 carbon atoms),514 which may function as electron sinks that accept electrons from TiO2, thus extending the lifetime of charge carriers. Upon illumination, the photo-excited electrons will be transferred from the space-charge regions into CNTs. Meanwhile, the holes retained on the surface of TiO2 may participate in the follow-up redox reactions. Wang et al. proposed a different mechanism, that is CNTs may function as sensitizers to enhance the visible light absorption capability,515 which resembles the roles reported for narrow-band gap semiconductor sensitizers (Fig. 16(b)). Under visible light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons from CNTs can be injected into the conduction band of TiO2, hence inducing the formation of highly reactive superoxide radicals. At the same time, the positively charged CNTs may withdraw electrons from the valence band of the TiO2, leaving holes that can further react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals. Pyrgiotakis et al. suggested that the enhancement might proceed through more complicated mechanisms (Fig. 16(c)).516 They found that the titanium–oxygen–carbon (Ti–O–C) bonds formed between TiO2 and CNTs could extend the light absorption of the composite to longer wavelength, similar to the photocatalytic enhancement found in carbon-doped TiO2. The electronic configurations of CNTs can also play critical roles in promoting the photocatalytic activity of CNT–TiO2, evidenced from the comparison between the nanocomposites prepared using different synthetic strategies. However, it is still a major challenge to dig out the exact underlying mechanisms of the photocatalytic enhancement in CNT–TiO2 systems.492

Furthermore, CNTs have also been utilized to improve the performance of other commonly used photocatalytic materials through similar enhancement mechanisms. These novel photocatalysts have been exploited in different applications, including photocatalytic degradation, water splitting and microorganism inactivation.

5.2.1 Photocatalytic degradation. 
It is well-known that industrial effluents, which contain harmful substances, may cause a severe adverse impact on ecosystems. Discharged wastewater from textile and relevant manufacturing industries carries a significant amount of non-fixed dyes, particularly azo dyes, which are harmful to microorganisms, aquatic life as well as human beings.517 Compared to conventional wastewater treatment technologies, photocatalysis may provide an efficient and cost-effective solution to address this problem. In the future, CNT-modified photocatalysts should play more important roles in removing dyes as well as other pollutants from wastewater.
Yu et al. reported the enhancement of adsorption and catalytic activity of CNT–TiO2 for the photodegradation of azo dye.518 The functionalized multiwall CNTs (MWNT) were prepared through catalytic decomposition of acetylene (C2H2), followed by boiling in nitric acid to gain oxygenated functionalities on their surface. P25 (∼80% anatase, 20% rutile) were directly mixed with functionalized CNTs or active carbon (AC) to prepare the photocatalysts. Photodegradation of triazine-azo dyes, including Procion Red (PR-MX5B, PR-HE3B) and Procion Yellow (PY-HE4R), was performed under UV (365 nm) irradiation using different photocatalysts to investigate the enhancement effects of CNTs. The dye degradation rate follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the concentration of the remaining dye in the solution (C), and the relationship can be further expressed as:  where C0 is the initial dye concentration, and Kapp is the apparent reaction rate constant. Fig. 17(a) illustrates the kinetics of PY-HE4R degradation using different photocatalysts and without photocatalysts, and the Kapp of different catalysts can be directly calculated from the slope of their corresponding plots. The results show that the performance of P25 can be apparently increased when they are mixed with CNTs, although CNTs exhibit negligible activity per se. By using different characterization techniques, it was concluded that the incorporation of functionalized CNTs with TiO2 could greatly improve the dye-adsorption capability. On the other hand, the strong interaction between CNTs and TiO2 also allows the migration of electrons from P25 to CNTs, which in turn reduces the chance of electron–hole recombination while accelerates the formation of reactive radical species (Fig. 17(b)). These two factors concurrently contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic activity observed in the mixture of P25 and CNTs. Meanwhile, the same group also reported the modification of mesoporous TiO2 using functionalized CNTs, which showed similar enhanced photocatalytic activity.519

Wang et al. have reported CNT–TiO2 composite catalysts for the degradation of phenol under visible light irradiation.515 MWNTs were prepared using a catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) method followed by purification using a standard acid washing process. A modified acid-catalyzed sol–gel method was employed to synthesize the CNT–TiO2 composites. Fig. 18(a) shows a typical TEM image of the as-synthesized CNT–TiO2 composite (16.4 wt%), in which TiO2 nanocrystals are visible over the MWNTs. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DR UV-vis, Fig. 18(b)) of P25, pristine TiO2 and different MWNT–TiO2 composites suggest that the visible light absorption of the composites can be greatly enhanced with increased MWNT contents. Visible light-activated phenol degradation tests were performed using the CNT–TiO2 composites, and their corresponding kinetic plots are illustrated in Fig. 18(c). The optimum weight ratio of MWNT/TiO2 was found to be 20%, by which the complete degradation (>95% conversion) of phenol could be achieved within 5 hours. In comparison, pristine TiO2 could only convert 40.6% phenol under the same reaction conditions. The photocatalytic enhancement observed in these composites was ascribed to the role of MWNT as a photosensitizer rather than an adsorbent or a dispersing agent. Behaving like a small band gap semiconductor, the charge carriers generated in MWNTs upon illumination trigger the formation of highly reactive radicals, which are responsible for the photocatalytic phenol degradation (Fig. 18(d)). Visible light active CNT–TiO2 nanocomposites can also be prepared using other methods such as supercritical fluid deposition,520 solvothermal,521 evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA)522 and biomimetic mineralization523 for photocatalytic degradation applications.

Among the many different strategies that have been developed so far, the sol–gel method is the most commonly used approach to synthesize CNT–TiO2 binary nanocomposites. However, the heat-treatment required for a sol–gel process may lead to phase detachment at the interface between TiO2 and CNTs. In addition, high-temperature treatment could also cause the agglomeration among the neighboring CNT–TiO2 strands as well as the non-uniform pore size distribution. To simplify the synthesis of the CNT–TiO2 nanocomposite, a facile one-pot chemical approach was developed by Liu and Zeng.524 In a typical synthesis, 15 mg MWNT was added to 20 mL 0.04 M TiF4 solution, followed by heating in an oven at 60 °C for 20 hours. By employing this simple surfactant-free method, [001]-oriented petal-like anatase TiO2 mesocrystals could be grown on the surface of CNTs uniformly. Degradation of methyl orange was performed under UV irradiation to investigate the activity of this catalyst, and the results indicated that the as-synthesized CNT–TiO2 nanocomposites are highly active and stable for photocatalytic applications. The excellent catalytic activity was attributed to a number of factors, including the high specific surface area, through-porosity, minimized reflection and suppressed recombination. Owing to the simplicity and mild reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve large-scale production of CNT–TiO2 composite catalysts using this synthetic strategy.
It has been reported that the confinement environment provided by CNTs could significantly enhance the activities of catalysts inside the well-defined nano-sized channels.525–529 CNT-confined TiO2 photocatalyst has been developed by Chen and co-workers using a restrained hydrolysis method (Fig. 19(a)),530 in which titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), as the precursor of TiO2 particles, was introduced into the CNT channels through the capillary force of the nanotubes under a N2 atmosphere. The neatly aligned TiO2 nanoparticles with an average crystal size of ∼4.6 nm inside the nanotubes were confirmed by TEM and XRD measurements. From the Raman spectra, a 4 cm−1 Eg(1) mode upshift of the Ti–O band was observed in CNT-confined TiO2, compared to the sample with TiO2 on the outer surface of CNTs. The authors attributed this phenomenon to the interaction between the interior walls of CNT and TiO2 nanocrystals, which subsequently introduces oxygen vacancies into TiO2. To further reveal its electronic structure, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements were performed. Fig. 19(b) shows the magnetization (specific mass) curves of different samples by applying external magnetic fields (H) from −50 to 50 kOe, and the inset displays the temperature-dependent magnetizations obtained at constant magnetic field. The significantly paramagnetic behavior and much larger magnetization value suggest that there are numerous unpaired electrons in CNT-confined TiO2, most probably due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies may in turn lead to the formation of reduced TiO2 (or Ti3+ species),531 which could extend the photoresponse of TiO2 to the visible light region. Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) was performed to investigate the performance enhancement. By applying CNT-confined TiO2 as the photocatalyst, ∼70% and 97.8% of the initial dye (MB) could be decomposed after 15 min and 90 min of irradiation, respectively. In addition, the reaction rate constant of CNT-confined TiO2 is more than 10 times the values of pristine TiO2 and P25, showing a drastic improvement in photocatalytic activities.

Apart from the extensively investigated CNT–TiO2 systems, micro- and nanocomposites that combine CNTs with other materials, including ZnO,532–536 ZnS,537 CdS,538–540 AgBr,541 WO3,542 graphene,543 C3N4,544etc., have also been developed as advanced photocatalysts for the decomposition of dyes as well as other hazardous organic contaminates. In addition, functionalized CNTs alone can also be used as photocatalysts, for instance, the metal-free C3N4 functionalized CNTs can perform as photocatalysts for efficient methylene blue degradation.544


5.2.2 Photocatalytic water splitting. 
Solar water splitting is a promising renewable energy technology that has attracted extensive attention, since the pioneering work done by Honda and Fujishima.545 Our planet receives a steady energy influx of 4.3 × 1020 J from the Sun in each hour, which is even more than the total global energy consumption in one year. At the same time, water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Based on these facts, it is believed that efficient and economical water splitting would be the key technology component for solving the forthcoming energy crisis.
In photocatalytic water splitting systems, three essential requirements have to be met to improve the overall efficiency.546 Firstly, the system must be capable of absorbing solar illumination to generate sufficient excitons, namely electrons and holes. Secondly, the photoinduced electron–hole pairs must be separated efficiently with low energetic loss to prevent their recombination. Thirdly, the photoinduced electrons and holes must be able to carry out the desired chemical reactions. Under solar irradiation, the photoinduced electrons can reduce water to generate H2, while the holes can oxidize water to generate O2. The generated H2 can be collected and utilized to produce electricity in hydrogen fuel cells, or directly served as a fuel for transportation with zero pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions.
The advantageous mechanical and electronic properties of CNTs may benefit the accelerated development of materials for photocatalytic water splitting. A composite catalyst comprised of MWNT, TiO2 and metallic Ni (MWNT–TiO2:Ni) has been developed by Ou and co-workers for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation.547 NiO–TiO2, as a support to direct the surface growth of MWNTs, was synthesized using the polymerized complex method (PCM). Subsequently, a modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was employed to prepare the MWNT–TiO2:Ni composites with varied MWNT contents. Photocatalytic water reduction tests were carried out using an inner irradiation-type quartz reaction cell under visible-light irradiation, with 1 g of photocatalyst dispersed in a mixture of methanol and water (Vmethanol/Vwater = 1/50). As shown in Fig. 20(a), the amount of H2 evolved on MWNT–TiO2:Ni increases steadily with increasing reaction time. By comparing the samples with different MWNT/TiO2 weight ratios, it was found that the maximum H2 evolution rate is ∼38.1 μmol h−1 g−1 at a MWNT content of 4.4%. Further increment in the MWNT content led to a decreased photocatalytic activity, possibly due to the attenuated visible light absorption. In this system, MWNTs function as photosensitizers that absorb photons and generate electron–hole pairs (Fig. 20(b)). The strong interphase interaction between MWNTs and TiO2 can accelerate the injection of photogenerated electrons from MWNTs to the conduction band of TiO2. On the surface of TiO2, the Ni nanoparticles function as co-catalysts to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Li et al. reported the photocatalytic H2 production using dye-sensitized MWNT–Pt composite under visible light irradiation.548 MWNTs were functionalized through refluxing in nitric acid solution with different concentrations. The introduced surface functional groups, such as –COOH and –OH, could apparently improve the water dispersibility of MWNTs, as well as provide substantial anchoring sites for photosensitizers. The catalyst solution was prepared by an in situ photoreduction approach, in which Eosin Y (2′,4′,5′,6′-tetrabromofluorescein) was used as the photosensitizer and aqueous H2PtCl6 was added as the precursor to grow nanoparticulate Pt co-catalyst. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in the solution of triethanolamine (TEOA), which functions as the hole-scavenger. From the results, the authors noticed that dilute HNO3 treated MWNT is more preferred for the photocatalyst preparation, since concentrated HNO3 may destruct the surface structures of MWNTs.549 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra suggest that the presence of MWNT can effectively suppress the charge recombination, by transferring the photo-generated electrons from Eosin Y to MWNTs. The optimized catalyst, prepared using an Eosin Y/MWNT mass ratio of 5/4 with 1% Pt loading, can generate H2 at 3.06 mmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum yield of ∼12.14%. In addition, the photocatalyst also demonstrated excellent stability with retaining 70% of its initial activity over 100 hours after 10 consecutive tests.
CdS–CNT hybrid photocatalysts have been reported and compared by Kim and Park for photocatalytic H2 production from water.550 To functionalize the CNTs, two different approaches were employed, namely heat treatment (annealing at various temperatures from 100 to 500 °C) and acid treatment (reflux in aqua regia for 30 min at room temperature). CNT loaded with different metal catalysts, including Pt, Ru, Cu, Pd, Ni, Ag and Au, were prepared by a chemical reduction method, in which NaBH4 was added to reduce the metal precursors, and CdS particles were further introduced into the hybrids after the sequential addition of Cd(CH3COO)2 and Na2S. Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a 35 mL Pyrex-glass reactor, in the presence of sacrificial agents (0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M Na2SO3). For the binary hybrids of CdS–CNT without metallic co-catalysts, the results show that the photocatalytic activity of heat-treated CNT (annealed at 500 °C) is better than that of the crude and acid-treated ones owing to the greatly improved purity and the suitable work function achieved after the heat treatment. However, when loaded with metallic Pt, acid-treated CNTs showed a much better performance compared to crude and heat-treated CNTs, due to the abundant binding sites formed during acid treatments. CdS–CNT hybrids loaded with different metallic catalysts were also compared, and showed varied photocatalytic activities in the following order: Pt > Ni > Ru > Pd > Au > Ag > Cu. Fig. 21 shows the schematic illustration of the hydrogen evolution on a CdS/CNT/M photocatalyst upon visible light irradiation. The excellent performance achieved by CdS/CNT/M can be partially ascribed to the suitably positioned work functions that can facilitate efficient charge transfer across the different components. On the other hand, other factors, including proton adsorption/desorption kinetics, intrinsic charge transfer rates, effects of particle size, etc. are all critical in determining the overall efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting systems.

Platinum (Pt) and other noble metals are considered as the most effective co-catalysts towards the H2 evolution reaction in photocatalysis. However, their practical application potential is limited by their scarcity and expensiveness. Recently, the solid solutions of Cd1−xZnxS have been thoroughly studied and have been proved as efficient photocatalysts for solar water splitting. Yu et al. have reported the fabrication of a noble-metal-free CNT–Cd0.1Zn0.9S composite, using a simple one pot hydrothermal approach, for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production.551 The content of incorporated CNT is significantly correlated with the photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalyst. Optimized CNT/Cd0.1Zn0.9S (0.25 wt% CNT) produces H2 at a rate of 1563.2 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation, which is more than three times higher than the value obtained from Cd0.1Zn0.9S alone. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of CNT/Cd0.1Zn0.9S can be attributed to the roles that CNTs played as an electron acceptor and transporter, which greatly reduce the recombination of photo-excited charge carriers.


5.2.3 Photocatalytic inactivation of microorganisms. 
From the European outbreak of the Black Death in the 14th century to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa today, the widespread and invasion of pathogens is one of the major threats to our health and wellbeing. Pathogenic microorganisms and viruses can be destroyed by various strategies, including pasteurization, UV irradiation, antibiotics and chemical oxidation. Herein, another important and novel application of photocatalysis is that it can be utilized to remove biological and viral contaminants in water or air streams with the power of sunlight, and this method is known as the solar disinfection (SODIS) process.477 The earliest demonstration of this concept can be dated back to three decades ago, when Matsunaga et al. first reported the photocatalytic sterilization of microbial cells by TiO2 nanoparticles.552 Upon irradiation, the strong oxidizing hydroxyl radicals generated on the surface of TiO2 could effectively kill the neighboring microbial cells, by destroying their membrane structures.553 More recently, increasing numbers of publications suggest that the incorporation of CNTs into certain photocatalysts would further improve their performances in solar disinfection applications.492
Lee et al. reported the inactivation of bacterial endospores using a novel biocidal photocatalytic nanocomposite comprised of MWNTs and TiO2.554 Chemical oxidation was performed in nitric acid to functionalize the MWNTs. A layer of anatase TiO2, with a thickness of a few nanometers, was then deposited onto the surface of MWNTs via a sol–gel method followed by heat treatment. BET measurements show that the specific surface area of the TiO2–MWNT composite is three times larger than that of commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25). Suspensions of bacterial endospores (Bacillus cereus) and their mixtures with different photocatalysts (3 mg P25 and 0.8 mg TiO2–MWNT nanocomposites) were exposed to 350 nm UV lamps (92 W m−2). The UV-irradiated suspensions were sampled every 30 min, and the survival ratio of B. cereus spores was analyzed correspondingly. The performances of the nanocomposite and P25 were studied based on the exposure time required to achieve 90% inactivation (LD90) of the endospores as well as the decimal reduction time (D-values). Compared to experiments carried out with UV alone or with P25, the utilization of TiO2–MWNT nanocomposites could effectively reduce the LD90 and D-value by factors of 1.8 and 2.3, respectively, suggesting a dramatically improved biocidal efficiency. Since the experiments were performed on equal surface area basis (based on BET measurements), the photocatalytic enhancement achieved on the TiO2–MWNT composite should be mainly attributed to the retardation of charge recombination.
Akhavan et al. synthesized TiO2–CNT heterojunction arrays for the photoinactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) under visible light irradiation.555 Well-aligned MWNT arrays were grown vertically on Ni-coated Si(001) wafers through plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 650 °C. The diameter of the as-synthesized CNTs was around 90–250 nm and their length was within the range of 2–4 μm, as shown in Fig. 22(a). Thin films of anatase TiO2 were deposited onto the MWNTs using a dip-coating sol–gel technique followed by a post annealing process. XPS analysis revealed that carbonaceous bonds, including Ti–C and Ti–O–C, could be formed at 400 °C, but not at 100 °C. To study the antibacterial activities, a diluted saline solution containing cultured E. coli was spread on the surface of different samples and irradiated with visible light (λ > 400 nm) at room temperature. Bare MWNT arrays showed poor antibacterial activity, since E. coli could even slightly breed on them, possibly due to presence of amorphous carbon and the structural disorders in the MWNTs. The TiO2/MWNTs annealed at 400 °C showed greatly enhanced visible light-induced antibacterial activity compared to the samples annealed at 100 °C and pure TiO2 films with 94 ± 2% of the bacteria killed within 1 hour (Fig. 22(b)). The authors attributed the excellent performance of TiO2/MWNTs to the carbonaceous bonds formed at the heterojunction, which significantly improved the visible light absorption as well as the charge transfer between MWNTs and TiO2. As a consequence, hydroxyl radicals, that are responsible for bacterial disinfection, can be formed much more efficiently. Through similar mechanisms, MWNT–ZnO nanocomposites were also demonstrated as effective photocatalysts for bacterial disinfection, owing to the formation of Zn–O–C carbonaceous bonds.556

5.3 Photoelectrochemical cells
Since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect in the early 1970s,545 photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting on semiconductor materials has been extensively studied for solar energy harvesting and conversion. In a broad sense, PEC water splitting offers an efficient and environmentally-friendly method to produce hydrogen from water using solar light. A typical PEC cell comprises a working photoanode (usually made of an n-type semiconductor film) that absorbs light to oxidize water and produces oxygen gas, protons, and photo-excited electrons. The photo-excited electrons (e−) are collected and transported to a counter cathode (usually made of a metal or a p-type semiconductor) via an external circuit. In the cathode, gaseous hydrogen is produced to complete the overall water splitting process.557 Even though enormous efforts have been devoted to experimentally maximize the energy conversion efficiency of the PEC water splitting reaction, the reported efficiency of the single-junction cell is still far from satisfactory for practical applications.558 The slow progress can be attributed to the lack of suitable photoelectrodes with wide-range light absorption, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetime, and excellent stability.559 On the other hand, it should be pointed out that, in many cases, recombination significantly reduces the amounts of photogenerated charge carriers for surface chemical reactions. Thus, it is highly desirable to modify the photoelectrodes with appropriate additives to facilitate the charge separation, transport and surface reactions.
CNT – an typical non-metal-oxide one-dimensional (1D) material, can provide a convenient way to direct the flow of photogenerated charge carriers because of their electron-accepting and -transporting properties, thereby increasing the lifetime of electron–hole pairs generated by semiconductors under light irradiation.518,554,560–562 Therefore, the integration of CNTs with semiconductors in an appropriate fashion could contribute to enhanced PEC water splitting performances. In this section, the latest developments of CNT–semiconductor hybrid nanocomposites as photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting were summarized and future perspectives were tentatively discussed.

5.3.1 Photoelectrochemical water splitting. 
5.3.1.1 Carbon–CNT nanocomposites. 
Carbon allotropes including fullerene (C60) and graphene have been utilized to modify CNTs to reinforce the electronic properties of CNTs. In particular, three-dimensional fullerenes have been well established to show peculiar electron transfer (ET) properties. Over the past few years, intensive research on the exploitation of photovoltaic systems utilizing fullerenes and their derivatives as acceptors has been carried out, in which the small reorganization energy of fullerene in ET could promote remarkable acceleration of photoinduced charge separation as well as deceleration of charge recombination.563–566 Inspired by these observations, Imahori's group designed a novel strategy to wrap fullerene molecules on the external surface of single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) via a facile chemical modification approach, by which efficient transportation of charges in C60–SWNT supramolecular based PEC and photovoltaic devices was realized.567 More specifically, the composite film exhibited an incident photon-to-current efficiency as high as 18% at λ = 400 nm at an applied potential of 0.05 V vs. SCE. The photocurrent generation efficiency is the highest among CNT-based photoelectrochemical devices in which CNTs are deposited onto electrodes electrophoretically, electrostatically or covalently.568 Furthermore, the highly aligned structure of C60 molecules on SWNTs can rationalize the efficient photocurrent generation. Analogous examples have also been reported in previous studies regarding fullerene-encapsulated SWNTs.569–571 These studies signify the synergistic interaction of carbon allotropes with CNTs for promising PEC or photovoltaic applications.
Recently, the graphene–CNT nanocomposite has gained increasing attention in various energy devices (e.g. highly conductive free-standing film) owing to the synergistic effects of these two carbon materials on the structural, conducting, and textural properties of hybrid films.572 It has been demonstrated that self-assembled graphene–CNT composite films possess an interconnected network with a well-defined nanoporous carbon structure and, moreover, they exhibit a small square resistance and high transmittance relative to pure carbon materials.573,574 Consequently, the intrinsic properties of graphene–CNT composite films are highly desirable for constructing photoelectrodes of PEC cells. For example, as carried out by Lee's group,575 the graphene–CNT hybrid film with 3D-like carbon structure was constructed as the conducting scaffold for efficient charge transfer from Fe2O3 particles to a transparent conducting oxide substrate in PEC water splitting cells. The thus-constructed Fe2O3–CNT–graphene composite photoanode showed a photocurrent increase of 530% as compared with the bare Fe2O3 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while the increase was only 200 and 240% for Fe2O3–CNT and Fe2O3–graphene photoanodes, respectively. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting the PEC cell efficiency based on the synergistic interaction of CNT and graphene. In another work, single-walled CNT (SWNT) thin films, containing a high density of semiconducting nanotubes, were prepared by a gel-centrifugation method and directly applied in PEC devices.576 The results indicate that photocurrent generated by semiconducting SWNT films are significantly higher than those by conventional unsorted SWNT films owing to the reduced recombination channels afforded by the removal of metallic nanotubes. This work indicates the great potential of semiconducting SWNTs for improving the photocurrent generation in PEC devices.
5.3.1.2 Semiconductor–CNT nanocomposites. 
The unique electronic and electrical properties, wide electrochemical stability window, and high surface area render SWNTs as ideal scaffolds to anchor light-harvesting assemblies especially the semiconductors. The electron-accepting ability of semiconducting SWNTs offers an opportunity to facilitate electron separation/transport and increase the photoconversion efficiency of nanostructured PEC cells. For example, as performed by Kamat's group,578 the SWNT architecture was employed as a conducting scaffold in a TiO2 based PEC cell, which remarkably boosted the photoconversion efficiency by a factor of 2. The interplay between the TiO2 and SWNTs of attaining charge equilibration has been established to be the important factor for improving PEC performance of TiO2. Apart from TiO2, CdS nanoparticles were also deposited on SWNTs. Upon excitation of CdS nanoparticles, charge injection from excited CdS into SWNTs occurs which gives rise to significantly enhanced photocurrent under visible light irradiation.579 Analogously, pronouncedly enhanced photocurrent was observed in an assembly that consists of CdS nanoparticles linked to a gold electrode by CNTs, and the enhanced photocurrent could be attributed to the effective transport of conduction-band electrons from CdS nanoparticles through the CNTs to the electrode, a process that competes with electron–hole recombination in CdS nanoparticles.580 Alternatively, as reported by Prato's group,577 thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped CdTe nanoparticles could be linked to SWNTs and MWNTs to improve the charge separation. Both kinetic and spectroscopic measurements evidenced a partial transfer of charge density between CdTe and CNTs with rapid formation of microsecond-lived radical ion pair states. Moreover, it was found that photocurrents were generated through the implementation of CdTe and SWNTs or MWNTs (see Fig. 23), which served as excited-state electron donors and acceptors, respectively. In another similar work,581 ZnS-capped CdSe quantum dots containing amine terminal groups (QD–NH2) were conjugated with acid-treated MWNTs ranging from 400 nm to 4 μm in length using ethylene carbodiimide coupling, thus resulting in MWNT–QD heterojunctions with promising PEC performances. Based on all above studies, it can be concluded that the CNT architecture is able to provide a nanowire network to disperse semiconductor nanoparticles, from which an increase of photoconversion efficiency (IPCE) as a result of the beneficial role of the CNT as conducting scaffold to facilitate charge collection and charge transport in nanostructured semiconductor films is realized, thereby the nanowire/nanoparticle architecture plays an important role in improving the efficiency of nanostructure-based water photoelectrolysis.

5.3.1.3 Metal nanocrystal–CNT nanocomposites. 
In recent years, the synthesis of CNT–metal nanocrystal heterostructures has received ever-increasing interest. To date, a number of different strategies have been put forward for the fabrication of CNT–metal nanocrystal nanocomposites which can be divided into two basic classes. One main approach involves the prior synthesis of metal nanoparticles which are then subsequently attached to functionalized CNTs via either covalent (i.e. organic or biomolecular linkers) or noncovalent interactions. The second key approach involves direct deposition of metal nanoparticles onto the surface of CNTs, either through in situ formation of metal nanoparticles, a reduction reaction, or an electrodeposition process using CNTs as templates. Of which, the integration of CNTs with different types of metal nanoparticles through electrostatic types of interactions offers a facile and general approach.582 As carried out by Yoo's group, Pt and Pd nanocrystals were evenly distributed onto the CNT framework by an in situ reduction method, thus giving rise to metal (Pt and Pd)-decorated CNT nanocomposites. Moreover, it was revealed that the PEC cell using n-type TiO2 and metal-decorated CNT as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibited larger photovoltage as compared with a conventional PEC cell with a Pt cathode due to p-type semiconducting properties of CNTs. In addition to noble metal nanoparticles, other metal counterparts such as Cu nanoparticles were also utilized to modify CNTs for PEC applications. For example, Scarselli and co-workers showed that the Cu metal nanoparticle–MWNT assemblies could act as a new hybrid photoactive layer in PEC devices.583 More specifically, the Cu–MWNT composites were formed by a controlled thermal deposition of copper, which produced crystalline Cu nanoparticles localized on the outer walls of CNTs. It was found that the IPCE of the nanocomposite was closely related to the nominal thickness of Cu nanoparticles and its increase was interpreted as the result of remarkable charge transfer between the Cu metal nanoparticles and the CNT due to the formation of a strong ionic bond at their interface.
5.3.1.4 Polymer–CNT nanocomposites. 
It is well known that CNTs are insoluble in most organic solvents, the solubilization of CNTs via a covalent or non-covalent method is considered to be an efficient strategy to overcome this problem.584–588 Several attempts have been made to improve the solubility of CNTs in organic solvents. Of which, functionalization or incorporation of CNTs into a polymer backbone is the most frequently used.589 Among different polymeric materials, the conducting polymers (CPs) are one of the most attractive classes due to their optical and electrical properties and applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.590 For example, Bertoncello and co-workers functionalized MWNTs via oxidative polymerization of 3,3-(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) using the Langmuir–Schaefer (LS) technique.591 It was found from the I/V characterization that the conductivity of the PVK–MWNTs was significantly increased as compared with the blank PVK. Moreover, these nanostructured PVK–MWNT films showed an increase in the current density under illumination. In another work, SWNT–polypyrrole nanocomposites were fabricated by a simple and straightforward in situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole monomer mixed with SWNTs.592 Alternatively, CNT–semiconductor can also be used as the substrate for the construction of CNT–semiconductor–polymer ternary nanocomposites. For example, as reported by Tagmatarchis's group,593 CNTs noncovalently modified with a block copolymer (poly[sodium(2-sulfamate-3-carboxylate)isoprene-bstyrene] – abbreviated as CSI) were used for the construction of CdS–CNT–polymer nanohybrids. It was found that the CdS nanoparticles were preferentially sitting on the surface of the CNTs due to specific interactions with the polymer chains. In these ternary nanohybrid materials, photoinduced electron transfer was found to occur from the photoexcited CdS nanoparticles to the nanotubes evidenced by the efficient fluorescence emission quenching of CdS nanoparticles. Moreover, the ITO/CNT/CSI/CdS electrode exhibits an incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 7% at an applied bias of +0.2 V vs. SCE in a standard three-compartment electrochemical cell. Direct electron injection from the reduced nanotubes to ITO electrode after the photoinduced charge separation was found to be responsible for the photocurrent generation.


5.3.2 Dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been shown as a viable, low cost method of producing solar electricity based on a mesoporous layer of a semiconducting charge collector with a sensitizing dye, a redox mediator and a Pt catalyst.594 It has been reported that the most efficient DSSCs can reach power conversion efficiencies of over 11%,595 which were achieved by depositing platinum on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate as the counter electrode. However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt limit the wide application of DSSCs. In this regard, tremendous efforts have been devoted to searching for suitable replacements for the Pt catalyst used in DSSCs with low cost materials.596–599 Among which, CNTs with defect sites, good structural integrity, stability, and catalytic activity make it a promising alternative for the conventional Pt in DSSCs.600 Thus far, various CNT or CNT-based nanocomposites have been developed to serve as efficient counter electrodes for DSSC applications. Manca's group developed a novel free-standing and flexible counter electrode for DSSCs by conveniently transferring a vertically aligned CNT forest onto an oxygen-plasma-treated flexible, free-standing and conductive nanocomposite foil. Such a carefully engineered counter electrode was able to guarantee a fast and effective reduction of the iodide-based electrolyte, rendering a solar conversion efficiency that is comparable with a typical Pt/TCO-coated rigid counter electrode. A photocurrent density higher than 13.0 mA cm−2 along with a solar conversion efficiency of 7.26% has been reported based on a vertically aligned CNT counter-electrode implanted onto a conductive nanocomposite plate.601 Alternatively, 3D CNT frameworks have also been applied as the counter electrode for DSSCs. For example, Chen and co-workers synthesized sponge-like CNTs through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a quartz substrate, which had homogeneous nanoscaled structure and high porosity. It was shown that the CNT-sponge was highly catalytically active in the reduction of I3− in the DSSC electrolyte and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6.21% was achieved. Compared with previous carbon-based counter electrode materials for DSSCs, the CNT sponge retains high flexibility and good mechanical strength, thus making it possible to directly transfer onto a substrate to make DSSC devices.602
On the other hand, CNT-based hybrid nanostructures have also been extensively explored as counter electrodes for DSSC applications. For example, graphene functionalized MWNT nanocomposites were synthesized as counter electrodes, for which the graphene–MWNT nanocomposites deposited onto fluorinated tin-oxide-coated glass showed improved catalytic behavior and power conversion efficiency (7.55%) beyond the use of the MWNTs (6.62%) or graphene (4.65%).603 More recently, a new core–shell heterostructure of MWNT@reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (MWNT@rGONR) was prepared by modified microwave-assisted synthesis followed by a chemical reduction. The core–shell heterostructure of MWNT@rGONR was found to be able to act as a catalytic film for I3− reduction in DSSCs. Owing to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the MWNT@rGONR, a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 6.91% was achieved using the YD2-o-C8 porphyrin dye, which is significantly higher than the efficiencies of 4.48% and 5.93% for the DSSCs using bare GNP and pristine MWNT as the counter electrodes, respectively. The performance of the cell using MWNT@rGONR is comparable to that of the cell with a sputtered Pt (7.26%).604 Most recently, as carried out by Cao's group, a Pt nanoparticle-adsorbed CNT yarn made by solution adsorption and yarn spinning processes, with uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles through the porous nanotube network, was prepared and used as a counter electrode for DSSCs. It was found that adsorption of Pt nanoparticles within a porous nanotube yarn resulted in a significantly enhanced Pt-electrolyte interfacial contact area and remarkably reduced charge-transfer resistance across the electrolyte interface as compared to a pure nanotube yarn or Pt wire, thus giving rise to a power conversion efficiency of 4.85% under standard illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) which is comparable to the same type of fiber cells with a Pt wire electrode (4.23%), as shown in Fig. 24. This work signifies that porous Pt–CNT hybrid yarns have the potential to reduce the use of noble metals, lower the device weight, and improve the solar cell efficiency.605

5.4 Electrocatalysis
The term electrocatalysis can be defined as the relative capability of different catalytic materials, when used as electrode surfaces, to modify and increase the reaction rate of certain electrochemical processes. Over the past few decades, the rapid development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts have greatly benefited the advancement of emerging technologies including fuel cells,606,607 batteries,608,609 artificial photosynthesis,546,610,611 carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction,612 biosensors,613,614etc. The unique structural and electrical properties of CNTs make them increasingly important in these popular topics.615
It was proposed that aligned CNTs could be used as the membrane materials for electrochemical energy storage and production during the Rice University Workshop in 1997.616 Later, Martin's group demonstrated the potential of applying free-standing nanoporous CNT membrane in lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells.617 The highly ordered CNTs were synthesized via chemical vapor deposition inside the pores of alumina membrane. During the CVD process, surface carbon films with thicknesses of ∼20 nm, which covered both faces of the alumina membrane, were also yielded. These surface films played important structural roles to hold the CNTs together in aligned fashion even after the dissolution of alumina templates in hydrofluoric acid (HF, 46%). Catalytic metal nanoparticles were synthesized inside the nanotube by immersing the CNT/alumina membrane into the precursor solution containing desired metal ions, followed by a heat treatment at 580 °C in the presence of flowing H2. Fig. 25(a) shows the SEM image of the membrane prepared using this method, which indicates that the open-ended CNTs packed within the membrane are well aligned. They also found that Fe-catalyzed CVD may lead to the formation of inner nanotubes within the outer template-synthesized tubes, resembled a tube-in-tube structure (see Fig. 25(b)). To investigate the possibility of using these CNT membranes as electrodes in Li-ion batteries, cyclic voltammetry and constant-current discharge were performed to study the reversible Li+ intercalation. As illustrated in Fig. 25(c), the cyclic voltammograms suggest the nanoporous CNT membranes can intercalate Li+ in a reversible fashion. Moreover, the Fe-catalyzed tube-in-tube membrane (Fig. 25(b)) could achieve a two times higher Li+-intercalation capacity, which can be associated with the presence of highly ordered carbon618,619 within it. This was the first demonstration of using CNT membranes as electrodes to carry out reversible Li+ intercalation. The group further explored the application potential of these membranes in fuel-cell technology. O2 reduction reactions were carried out in 0.05 M O2-saturated H2SO4 solutions. As shown in Fig. 25(d), Pt-loaded CNT membrane could produce a very large O2 reduction wave, which is 20 times higher than the currents obtained using Nafion-coated Pt electrode with equivalent geometric surface area. Analogously, Pt/Ru-loaded CNT membranes also showed pronounced performance in the methanol oxidation reactions (see Fig. 25(e)). The authors attribute the catalytic enhancements to the higher electrochemically active surface area achieved using the CNT membranes. Since then, CNT-based electrodes have been developed and thoroughly studied by many different groups: Britto et al. constructed microelectrodes for ORR using multiwalled CNT, and performed ab initio density-functional-theory (DFT) as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the microscopic mechanism of electron transfer on the tubes.620 Li et al. prepared multiwalled CNT-supported Pt nanocomposites using different approaches and compared their performances, and they found that the morphology and dispersion of Pt in the nanocomposite played important roles in ORR activity enhancement.621 Matsumoto and co-workers experimentally proved that the usage of Pt in fuel cells can be greatly reduced by using CNT as the catalyst support.622

The considerable usages of CNTs as catalyst supports in anodes or cathodes for methanol oxidation (in direct methanol fuel cells), oxygen reduction, CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation (in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells) have been extensively investigated. Platinum is the most frequently used metal, with the Pt–Ru alloy in the second place. Other platinum-containing bimetallic (Pt–Ru,623–626 Pt–Pd,627 Pt–Sn,628 Pt–Fe,629,630 Pt–Co,629,630 and Pt–Ni629,630) or multimetallic (Pt–Ru–Ir631) systems have been studied. In these studies, highly dispersed metallic particles have been observed. Since origins of the CNTs are different, there is difficulty in comparing all these studies, implying the crucial importance of CNTs standardization. However, the general conclusions include that electro-catalysts based on CNTs are more active and have higher resistance in some cases against poisoning than conventional carbon supports such as carbon black XC-72.570 It is possible to achieve similar or even better performance with significantly lower Pt loadings.632,633 In contrast to the carbon black support, CNTs possess a power density enhancement up to 68%,634 and electrocatalytic activity enhancement up to 102%,635 or even higher efficiency.636 Different types of CNTs have been systematically compared in several previous studies. Considering electronic conductivity and surface area, the supports range in the order of SWNTs > double-walled CNTs > MWNTs > carbon nanofibres. The advantages of CNTs as electrocatalytic supports in fuel cells can be ascribed to the feasibility of accessing high metal dispersion and hence high electro-active surface area, the three-dimensional network which improves mass transfer and their promising electronic conductivity expediting electron transfer. However in the cases of carbon black XC-72 or activated carbons, the metal particles may sink inside the micropores, decreasing the electro-catalytically effective surface area.
More recent research efforts suggested that the utilization of modified CNTs might not only reduce, but also replace the usage of noble metals in fuel cells. It was a breakthrough when Dai's group reported the fabrication of vertically aligned nitrogen containing CNTs (VA-NCNTs) that possess high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction in 2009.637 The VA-NCNTs were synthesized by pyrolyzing iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) inside a quartz tube furnace at 800–1100 °C in the presence of flowing gas mixture, which contains 48% Ar, 28% H2 and 24% NH3. Fig. 26(a) shows the SEM images of the as-synthesized VA-NCNTs on a quartz plate. The zigzag-like morphology formed along the entire length of the nanotubes could have resulted from the integration of nitrogen into the graphitic structure, which in turn altered the surface geometry of the tubes.638 XPS measurements were performed to confirm the incorporation of structural nitrogen atoms, with an N: C elemental ratio of ∼4 to 6%. The electrodes were purified using electrochemical oxidation in neural phosphate buffer to remove the residual Fe catalyst, and the aligned structure remained nearly unchanged after the process. The TEM image (see Fig. 26(b)) reveals the bamboo-like morphologies of the NCNTs, with length and outer diameters of 8 μm and 25 nm, respectively. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammograms were obtained to gain insight of the electrocatalytic activity of VA-NCNTs. Fig. 26(c) compares the RRDE steady-state voltammograms for ORR in air-saturated 0.1 M KOH recorded using different materials, namely carbon supported-Pt (Pt–C, curve 1), vertically aligned nitrogen-free CNTs (VA-CCNTs, curve 2) and VA-NCNTs (curve 3), supported on glassy carbon electrodes. The half-wave potential observed on VA-NCNT/GC was comparable with that of Pt–C/GC (−0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Compared to the Pt–C/GC electrode, VA-NCNT/GC showed significantly improved steady-state diffusion current over a wide potential range, suggesting that VA-NCNT/GC is much better than the Pt–C/GC to catalyze ORR in alkaline electrolytes. DFT calculations indicate that the carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen dopants bear a much higher positive charge density to counterbalance the electronic affinity of the doped atoms. This nitrogen-induced charge delocalization could alter the chemisorption mode of oxygen molecules on CNTs, while creating substantial metal-free active sites for electrochemical reduction of O2. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning of a noble-metal electrode is a major concern in designing fuel cells. Fig. 26(e) compares the chronoamperometric (i–t) responses of Pt–C/GC and VA-NCNT/GC before and after the addition of CO, and the results show that Pt–C/GC was deactivated rapidly upon the addition of CO, while the metal-free VA-NCNT/GC was insensitive towards CO poisoning. The stunning ORR catalytic activities of N-doped CNT in alkaline electrolytes have been further confirmed by other groups,639,640 however, its performance falls short in acidic media. To address this issue, Li et al. have developed an ORR electrocatalyst based on CNT–graphene complexes, which showed excellent performance in both alkaline and acidic media.641

Surface functionalization of CNTs enables improvement of CNT supported electrocatalysts. Mild nitric acid treated CNTs supported platinum can offer better electrocatalytic performance than pristine CNTs in the oxygen reduction reaction.642 Nitrogen-doped CNTs supported PtRu is much more active than acid-treated CNTs supported PtRu and the commercial PtRu/C catalyst in methanol electrooxidation.224 When using N-doped CNTs, cheap metals such as Co can be good alternatives to replace noble metals. In the oxygen reduction reaction, the CoO/nitrogen-doped CNT catalyst outperforms Co3O4/graphene and commercial Pt/C as well.643 The metal oxides supported on CNT have been found to be better than the graphene counterpart considering active sites and charge transfer.643 Another case for cheap metal as an electrocatalyst on functionalized CNTs is the CoMn2O4 supported on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) functionalized CNTs (PDDA-CNTs). PDDA-CNTs can enable intimate coupling of nanocrystals onto CNTs without loss of the CNTs intrinsic properties. The excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance and high durable stability are ascribed to the presence of a crystal-support synergetic effect, high electronic conductivity and durability of the composite. CoMn2O4/PDDA-CNTs is an excellent alternative to replace platinum for oxygen reduction catalysis under basic conditions or neutral pH and may prevent corrosion hence can act as a protective cathode in fuel cells.644 CNTs functionalized with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) supported platinum is surprisingly highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction due to the high dispersion and the large electroactive surface area of platinum nanoparticles. It also possesses an improved electrochemical stability owing to the structural integrity of the functionalized CNTs.645
The utilization of CNTs and CNT-modified materials also lead to many exciting advancements in electrochemical energy storage applications, such as lithium ion batteries646–652 and supercapacitors.653–657 Reddy et al. demonstrated the template-assisted fabrication of coaxial manganese oxide (MnO2)/CNT array electrodes for high performance lithium batteries.658 To prepare these composite nanotubes, MnO2 nanotubes were firstly prepared using a vacuum infiltration method into the pores of a commercial alumina membrane. The alumina membrane filled with MnO2 was then placed in a tube furnace for the CVD growth of CNT at 650 °C using acetylene (C2H2) as the precursor. A thin film of gold (Au), functioned as the current collector, was coated onto one side of the template by sputtering. After that, the MnO2/CNT coaxial nanotubes were obtained by dissolving the alumina templates inside 3 M NaOH aqueous solution. Fig. 27(a) shows the SEM image of a single coaxial nanotube, from which the MnO2 shell and the CNT core can be clearly identified. The electrochemical properties of the electrode can be readily tuned by modifying the structure of the coaxial nanotube, such as the shell thickness and the tube length. To assess the performance of this novel electrode, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out at a constant rate of 50 mA g−1 between 3.2 and 0.02 V vs. Li/Li+ (see Fig. 27(a)). The MnO2/CNT showed a first irreversible discharge capacity of 2170 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of ∼500 mA h g−1 after 15 consecutive cycling tests, with a similar charge–discharge profile to the one obtained using pristine MnO2 nanotubes. The large irreversible capacity observed during the first cycle could be caused by the decomposition reactions took place in the electrolyte and the formation of a solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the electrode surface.659 The authors also compared the cyclic stability of MnO2/CNT with CNTs and MnO2 nanotubes (see Fig. 27(c)), and figured out that the reversible specific capacity achieved on the hybrid electrode was enhanced by an order compared to the pristine MnO2 nanotubes after 15 cycles. The apparently improved performance of the MnO2/CNT coaxial nanotube array can be attributed to the extraordinary electrical properties of CNTs, which greatly facilitates the electron transport to the active MnO2 shell. On the other hand, the incorporated CNTs may also introduce additional lithium storage sites, triggering a dual mechanism of lithium storage that drastically expands the reversible capacity of the MnO2–CNT hybrid electrode.

As mentioned earlier, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting are important technologies to produce hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to power the future world. Meanwhile, development of electrocatalysts, which drive efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution, are of equal importance to realize our dream goal of achieving practical artificial photosynthesis. Toma et al. have successfully developed an efficient oxygen-evolving anode using polyoxometalate clusters, M10[Ru4(H2O)4(μ-O)4(μ-OH)2 (γ-SiW10O36)2] (M101, M = Cs or Li), and MWNTs.660 The MWNTs were functionalized using polyamidoamine (PAMAM) ammonium dendrimers (MWNT-dend) to anchor the negatively charged polyanionic ruthenium-containing cluster 1. The composite catalyst 1@MWNT was formed through an electrostatic scavenging process, as illustrated in Fig. 28(a), simply by mixing Li101 and water-soluble MWNT-dend in a water solution at pH 5, and subsequently stirred overnight. To investigate the OER performance on different materials, electrochemical tests were carried out using a water-splitting electrocatalytic cell as shown in Fig. 28(b). They found that the nanostructured 1@MWNT anodes could perform efficient water oxidation, with appreciable catalytic current and remarkable turnover frequency numbers. They attributed the enhanced performance of 1@MWNT to the incorporation of functionalized MWNTs, which increased the electrochemical active surface area while it improved the electrical contact between the redox-active center of the cluster and the surface of the electrode. In addition, the network provided by MWNTs could funnel the sequential electron transfer to the electrode, hence relieving the catalytic fatigue.

5.5 Other reactions
CNT supported palladium catalysts have shown excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for Suzuki C–C coupling reactions.295,661–663 CNTs functionalized with in situ-generated alkynylated diazonium cations are efficient platforms for 3 nm sized palladium particles, leading to efficient catalytic performance for the C–C Suzuki coupling reaction, which can run up to four cycles.295 Comparison among amine-containing functional groups formed by hydrazine hydrate oligomerization on CNTs, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine turned out to be more efficient in immobilizing the palladium nanoparticles than simple amine functional groups for Suzuki coupling reactions and can be recycled over seven times.663
The solid-acid metal-free catalyst behavior of CNTs functionalized with sulfonic groups or sulfonic derivatives can catalyze esterification, rearrangement, dehydration and condensation reactions (mentioned in Section 3.4). In addition, as a catalytic support, functionalized CNTs can offer versatile possibilities and promising improvement. The imidazolium-functionalized CNTs prepared through appropriate hydroxyl group end-capped imidazolium compounds immobilized via the carboxyl groups. Afterwards, the imidazolium functionalized CNTs were utilized to prepare nanohybrids with iridium N-heterocyclic carbene type complexes with efficiencies up to 95%. The CNT-supported iridium–N-heterocyclic carbene materials displayed high catalytic activity in the heterogeneous cyclohexanone hydrogen-transfer reduction reaction, with a turnover frequency up to 5500 h−1 (Fig. 29).274 The Ru–carbene complex immobilized on an imidazolium funcitonalized CNT support has been studied for recyclable ring-closing metathesis. The imidazolium CNT-supported Ru–carbene complexes possess highly active catalytic performance for ring-closing metathesis of several dienes, and the catalyst can be recovered and reused 10 times.664 In another study on Ru–carbene complex related bi-function catalysts supported on imidazolium functionalized CNTs, Ru–carbene complex and palladium nanoparticles have been anchored onto the same imidazolium-functionalized ionic CNTs. The supported di-function catalysts exhibited exceptional catalytic performance for tandem metathesis or hydrogenation reactions with conversion of ring-closing metathesis up to 96% and conversion of hydrogenation reaction higher than 99% in an ionic liquid environment and these di-function catalysts can also be recovered and reused four times.665 For the above catalysts, the surface functional groups are indispensable for the covalent bonding with active species in order to form high-performance catalysts.

Apart from the aforementioned applications, CNTs have also been utilized for the desulfurization of diesel fuel,666 oil hydrocarbons aerobic oxidation,557 hydrodesulfurization process667,668 and so forth.
6. Concluding remarks
In spite of the enormous progress already achieved in functionalization of CNTs with various methodologies, challenging opportunities for optimized and novel functionalization process of CNTs still remain to be grasped for specific applications. In catalysis, roles of more functional groups or surface functionalities are required to be explored for better understanding and applications. In this review, an overview of various methods and synthesis of functionalized CNTs has been made, and the properties and applications of the as-prepared materials are illustrated. Acid treatment is not by far the most frequently studied method, which may be ascribed to the simplicity of oxidation procedures. Oxidation treatment of CNTs was generally the first treatment before further functionalization or merely for the deposition of nanoparticles to form heterogeneous catalysts. Heteroatom-doped CNTs can provide additional active sites meanwhile with the change in electronic, interfacial, sorption and acid–base properties. Super hydrophobic properties are obtained via fluorination. Surface bromine, carboxyl, hydroxyl, acyl chloride and amino groups can be starting points for further functionalization with organic or polymer groups. Sulfonation provides CNTs with the role of solid-acid while diazonium-functionalization can covalently graft aryl derivatives onto CNTs surface. Polymers can be grafted onto CNTs via free-radical reactions including polymer radical attaching and surface polymerization, or the direct polymer reacting with surface active groups on CNTs. Nanoparticles deposition on CNTs can be realized by impregnation, electrochemical deposition, physiochemical deposition and electroless deposition. All these functionalization approaches above can fine-tune the surface properties of CNTs, which favors the versatile usages.
Applications in catalysis are based on the modification of wettability, electrophilicity, acid–base properties, adsorption, electric conductivity and capacitance and therefore their effect on particle size and dispersion, metal–support interactions, energy band, charge transfer, oxygen activation, adsorbing and releasing certain molecules and the specific roles of surface functionalities in targeted reactions. These properties also determine the applications in composites, supercapacitors, fuel cells, electronics, sensors, sorbents and so forth.
CNTs and functionalized CNTs have been considerably utilized and investigated in numerous reactions including hydrogenation, CO/H2 conversion toward hydrocarbons or alcohols, dehydrogenation, oxidation, amino synthesis and decomposition, CNTs synthesis, photocatalytic reactions, C–C coupling reactions and so forth. More applications in catalysis still remain to be explored in width and depth with the promising intrinsic properties of CNTs and functionalized CNTs.
In the future, we may see further designed functionalized CNTs supported catalysts with high performance in environmentally friendly processes such as the plastic degradation for fuel, cellulose conversion to ethanol, waste water treatment, treatment of air pollution, conversion of renewable energy and so forth in order to solve environment and energy problems, which still remain challenging topics nowadays.
