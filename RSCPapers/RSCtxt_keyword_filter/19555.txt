    , Accepted 3rd February 2021First published on 4th February 2021AbstractThe synthesis and application as a cathode interfacial material (CIM) for organic solar cells (OSCs) of a fluorene-based conjugated small molecule (3FPy) with pyridyl functional side chains are presented. 3FPy is soluble in MeOH containing trace AcOH due to the interaction between pyridyl and AcOH, offering opportunities to fabricate multilayer OSCs by orthometric solution methods. When 3FPy was introduced into the conventional OSCs of both poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl-altethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM systems, significant simultaneous improvements in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) were achieved. It was found that pyridyl groups could lessen the cathode's work functions by interfacial dipoles, subsequently enlarging the built-in potentials and Voc. For the FF enhancements, the working mechanisms for 3FPy consisted of suppressing the devices’ dark currents, reducing the charge transport loss by n-doping PC71BM, and optimizing the contacts at the active layer/cathode interfaces. Therefore, this kind of novel small molecule is a promising CIM for high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) possess several advantages, including that they are low cost, light weight, have good mechanical flexibility and can be prepared using low-temperature solution processing technologies for large-area devices. Thus, OSCs have become one of the most promising technologies for renewable energy source conversion. The best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have surpassed 18%1 to date, the combined results of active layer engineering,2 interface engineering3 and device engineering.4
At present, the frequently used cathodes are Al, Ag, indium tin oxide (ITO) and so on, which have high work functions (WFs) to maintain the ambient stability of OSCs. However, it is difficult for these high-WF materials to form ohmic contacts directly with the electron acceptor, leading to low built-in potentials (Vbi) and high energy barriers for charge extraction and transport across devices. In order to improve OSC performance, it is crucial to employ cathode interfacial layers (CILs) to optimize the acceptor/cathode contact. These cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) can be divided into inorganic and organic compounds. LiF,5 Cs2CO3,6 ZnO,7 TiO2,8etc. are the common inorganic CIMs; nevertheless, they sometimes show disadvantages such as incompatibility with organic active materials, absorption towards oxygen on the surfaces, and sensitivity to moisture and UV irradiation.9 However, organic CIMs include small molecules and polymers, between which polymeric CIMs exhibit some intrinsic drawbacks (mediocre purity and batch-to-batch variations in molecular weight and polydispersity) that reduce the repeatability of device performance. Conversely, small organic molecules with well-defined structures, molecular weights and purity may be more promising candidates for CIMs.
For organic CIMs, the most common functional groups are amino groups, which can reduce the cathode's WF by interfacial dipoles, decrease the charge transport loss by n-doping acceptor, and thus improve the device performance.10 These working mechanisms are mainly attributed to the electron-donating abilities of amino groups. Similar to amino, pyridyl groups also have lone-pair electrons within the sp2 hybrid orbitals of N atoms; hence pyridyl also displays electron-donating effects. However, CIMs with pyridyl as functional group have been rarely studied and reported. In previous work, we replaced amino with pyridyl as the modificatory group to develop a class of polyfluorene CIMs, and the conventional and inverted OSCs’ performance was successfully improved by these CILs.11 It was demonstrated that pyridyl groups are very promising building blocks for effective CIMs, showing similar modifying mechanisms to the amino groups.
In this work, a fluorene backbone-based conjugated small molecule (3FPy) with pyridyl functional groups in the side chains is presented. As compared to the polyfluorene modifying materials,11 this 3FPy compound exhibits certain structure and molecular weight. Besides this, the synthesis of 3FPy is uncomplicated, resulting in low preparation costs. 3FPy can be dissolved in MeOH in the presence of trace AcOH due to the interaction between the pyridyl groups and AcOH, which offers opportunities to fabricate multilayer OSCs by orthometric solution methods. As a result, when 3FPy was inserted as CIL into the conventional OSCs of poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl-altethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) system, significant performance improvements could be achieved. In detail, the 3FPy-modified OSCs realized an optimal PCE of 7.16%, which was obviously better than those of the pristine (PCE = 4.41%) and MeOH-washed (PCE = 5.47%) ones, due to the increases in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). It was found that the pyridyl groups in 3FPy can decrease the cathode WFs by forming interfacial dipoles, subsequently increasing the Vbi and Voc values. 3FPy may prevent cathode atoms from diffusing into the active layers during evaporation of the cathodes, and thus suppress the dark currents in the conventional devices. The other working mechanisms for 3FPy are composed of reducing the charge transport loss by n-doping PC71BM, improving the contact between the active layers and metal cathodes, and so on. On the other hand, the modifying performance of 3FPy for the conventional OSCs based on poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM system also proved excellent. Therefore, this kind of organic small molecule is a promising CIM candidate for high-performance OSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for 3FPy is shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 112 and 311 were prepared according to the literature. Compounds 2 and 3 reacted under common Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction conditions and generated 3FPy. 3FPy is readily soluble in organic solvents of medium polarity, such as THF and chlorobenzene, but is insoluble in low-polarity solvents such as toluene and hexane. Interestingly, it can also be dissolved in MeOH with trace AcOH, leading to its application potential as CIM in multilayer OSCs by orthometric solution processing without interfacial erosion.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 3FPy in THF and in film are exhibited in Fig. 1, while the photophysical parameters are summarized in Table 1. 3FPy displayed a single absorption peak at about 356 nm in dilute THF solution, yet the band showed a bathochromic shift to 367 nm in film state. These absorption signals were caused by the π–π* transitions in the conjugated backbones. For the PL spectra, the dominant peak was located at 396 nm in THF, which was close to the highest peak of 402 nm in solid state. It is worth noting that the absorption and PL profiles were broader and red-shifted in the film compared to those in THF, resulting from the intermolecular aggregations in solid. The optical band gap (Eoptg) was estimated to be 2.99 eV from the absorption onset in film.

Electrochemical properties
In order to study the energy level structure of 3FPy, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve was measured, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Under the same experimental condition, the oxidation potential (E1/2) of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was first tested as 0.45 V, with the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. Therefore, the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) could be calculated with the empirical equation: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.80 − 0.45) eV, where Eox is the oxidation potential onset of the material.13Eox was observed to be 1.13 V in film state, and EHOMO was estimated as −5.48 eV. The LUMO energy level (ELUMO) could be calculated to −2.49 eV according to the equation: ELUMO = Eoptg + EHOMO.

Photovoltaic performance of the PTB7:PC71BM system
To investigate the cathode modification properties of 3FPy, conventional OSCs with device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/CIL/Al were fabricated and characterized under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Control devices without any CIL and with MeOH (containing trace AcOH) depositions on top of the active layers were also tested for comparisons. Fig. 3a exhibits the energy level diagram of OSCs, while Fig. 3b and c show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF and PCE estimated from J–V curves are summarized in Table 2. The pristine OSCs showed a maximal PCE of 4.41%, with Voc of 0.56 V, Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 50.8%. These data are close to the reported photovoltaic parameters in previous papers.14,15 In regard to the MeOH-treated devices, performance improvements could be observed compared with the pristine devices. The MeOH-deposited optimal device displayed a Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2, FF of 55.1% and PCE of 5.47%. Previous studies have proved that MeOH washing can improve the Voc and FF of OSCs, which should be due to the enhancement of Vbi as a result of trap passivation and subsequent charge density improvements on the surfaces.15,16 It is worth noting that 3FPy could further increase the OSCs’ efficiencies. After introducing 3FPy CIL, the performance was enlarged significantly, with a Voc at 0.75 V, Jsc at 15.4 mA cm−2, FF at 62.0% and PCE at 7.16%. The Rs values decreased and the Rsh values increased in the order of pristine, MeOH-treated, and 3FPy-modified devices, suggesting that the ohmic contacts could be optimized by 3FPy. The EQE spectra for these devices exhibited similar skeleton maps over the entire wavelength range. The integral photocurrent densities were 15.1, 14.9 and 15.2 mA cm−2 for the bare-Al, MeOH-washed and 3FPy-modified devices, respectively, which were close to the Jsc values estimated from the J–V curves.

Cathode WFs
In order to study the influence of 3FPy on the cathode interfacial properties of PTB7:PC71BM OSCs, the WFs of ITO and Ag electrodes after different treatments were measured by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), as shown in Fig. 4a. The tests towards Al electrodes were not performed, as Al is easily oxidized during measurements. From the pristine, MeOH-washed, to 3FPy-modified ITO electrodes, the WFs reduced from 4.85, 4.80 to 4.33 eV. For the Ag samples, the same trend could be observed; that is, from the pristine, MeOH-treated, to 3FPy-modified Ag electrodes, the WFs diminished from 4.68, 4.64 to 4.21 eV. It could be seen that MeOH washing would not drastically change the WFs of cathodes. The significant WF reductions by 3FPy are probably attributed to the directed dipoles that were built at the cathode/CIL interfaces.17 Dipole interactions might also exist between Al and 3FPy, resulting in the shrinkage in Al WF and formation of ohmic contacts at the cathode sides (Fig. 4b), thereafter leading to enhancements in Vbi, Voc and FF of the modified devices.18

Photovoltaic performance in the dark
To acquire more insightful understanding about the working mechanisms of the 3FPy CIL, the J–V characteristics of PTB7:PC71BM OSCs were recorded in the dark, as shown in Fig. 5. Under reverse bias, the 3FPy-modified device showed lower reverse dark current compared with the bare-Al and MeOH-washed devices. The restrained reverse dark current would be conducive to the enhancements in Voc for the 3FPy-modified devices.19 Under the low forward bias, the decreasing trend for dark current was found to be the same as above. One reason for the lowest dark currents under both reverse and forward bias was probably that the 3FPy CIL acted as a protective layer to reduce the diffusion of Al atoms into the active layer during Al evaporation in vacuum, leading to the best active film quality and charge selectivity for the 3FPy-inserted device.20 In comparison with no and MeOH treatments, 3FPy modification best inhibits the reverse and forward dark currents, generating the highest Rsh, FF and Voc values for the 3FPy-incorporated devices.

N-Doping effects
To investigate the n-doping effects from 3FPy to PC71BM at the PTB7:PC71BM/3FPy interfaces, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy tests were carried out in the dark, as shown in Fig. 6. The PC71BM solution and 3FPy solution (both in THF) were mixed together, then the solvent was distilled, producing the PC71BM/3FPy solid sample after drying. In Fig. 6, no [PC71BM]− absorption signal was detected for the pure PC71BM sample. However, diagnosable anionic PC71BM absorption peaks could be observed for the PC71BM/3FPy compound. These phenomena signified that the electron transfer interactions from the pyridyl groups to PC71BM were objective, ensuring efficient conductive pathways and low charge transport loss, which could decrease Rs and increase FF for the 3FPy-modified devices.11,21

Electron mobility
The J–V characteristics of electron-only PTB7:PC71BM devices were measured, and the results were fitted with a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, so as to evaluate the apparent charge transport properties of OSCs subjected to different treatments.22 The structure for electron-only devices was ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The spin-coating conditions for these films were the same as those of the OSC fabrications. It was estimated that the pristine, MeOH-washed and 3FPy-modified devices showed apparent electron mobilities of 9.11 × 10−4, 9.50 × 10−4 and 9.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, it could be found that the electron mobility of OSCs was slightly increased by MeOH and 3FPy, in agreement with the close Jsc values for these three OSCs.23

Electrochemical impedance spectra
The transport and recombination resistance values within different PTB7:PC71BM OSCs were also extracted from the Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), as shown in Fig. 8. The extracted transport resistance (Rtrans) values were 17.4, 14.7 and 11.2 Ω for the bare-Al, MeOH-washed and 3FPy-modified devices, respectively, accompanied by an increase in the recombination resistance (Rrec) from 1800, 1810 to 1910 Ω. The reduced Rtrans and enhanced Rrec values suggested that improved charge transport properties and suppressed recombination rates could be achieved in the modified devices, leading to higher FF values.

Water contact angles
In order to study the influence of 3FPy on the compatibility between the PTB7:PC71BM active layers and cathodes, static water contact angles for different surfaces were recorded, as shown in Fig. 9. The PTB7:PC71BM active layer exhibited a contact angle of 105.6°, indicating a hydrophobic trait. MeOH washing mildly reduced the contact angle to 102.9°, probably due to the slight MeOH residue on the surface. Besides, after spin-coating 3FPy on top of PTB7:PC71BM, a more hydrophilic surface with a contact angle of 98.2° could be achieved, possibly resulting from the high polarity of pyridyl groups. Therefore, it was suggested that 3FPy CILs could build good contacting “bridges” between the active layers and Al cathodes, thus optimizing Rs and FF values of the modified OSCs.24

Morphologies
To investigate the influence of 3FPy deposition on the morphologies of underlying PTB7:PC71BM active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to analyse the surface morphologies of PTB7:PC71BM films subjected to different treatments, as shown in Fig. 10. The pristine active film showed a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.13 nm. After spin-coating MeOH on top, the RMS roughness was decreased to 1.40 nm. Moreover, the PTB7:PC71BM/3FPy surface was tested to be smoother, with an RMS roughness at 1.37 nm. In brief, 3FPy could homogenize the active films, which was beneficial for the interfacial contacts with cathodes.

Photovoltaic performance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system
Conventional OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system were also fabricated and measured, so as to verify the 3FPy performance. The device architecture was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/CIL/Al, and the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 11 and Table 3, respectively. The pristine device had a Voc of 0.58 V, Jsc of 16.4 mA cm−2, FF of 54.9% and PCE of 5.22%. After MeOH washing, the parameters changed to 0.65 V, 16.4 mA cm−2, 58.9% and 6.28% for the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values, respectively. Lastly, 3FPy modification better enhanced the performance, with a Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 16.4 mA cm−2, FF of 70.1% and PCE of 9.08%. Therefore, 3FPy could significantly improve the OSC performance by increasing the Voc and FF values.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel fluorene-based conjugated small molecule named 3FPy, with pyridyl functional groups incorporated into the side chains, was designed and synthesized. 3FPy was employed as CIM for high-efficiency conventional OSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM system. As a result, simultaneous improvements in the Voc and FF values could be realized, and the PCEs were increases from 4.41% (without CIL) and 5.47% (MeOH-treated) to 7.16% (3FPy-modified). It was verified that 3FPy could lessen the cathode WFs by directed dipoles and subsequently optimize the Voc. For the improvements in FF, the mechanisms were composed of restraining the devices’ dark currents, n-doping PC71BM through the electron transfer interactions from pyridyl to PC71BM, optimizing the contacts at the active layer/cathode interfaces, and others. Moreover, 3FPy also showed excellent modifying performance in conventional OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system. Therefore, this novel small molecule is a high-performance CIM for fabricating OSCs that show high efficiency.

General measurements and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR were tested on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. APCI-MS analyses were performed using an Acquity Waters UPLC equipped with a Waters Acquity TQ detector (Thermo Finnigan LCQ Fleet system). Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded on an Instaspec IV CCD spectrophotometer (Oriel Co.). CV curves were characterized on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode cell based on a Pt wire counter electrode, Pt working electrode and SCE reference electrode, and the tests were done within a 0.1 mol L−1 nitrogen-saturated and anhydrous tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphates solution in acetonitrile.
OSC fabrication
The anodes employed patterned ITO-coated glass substrates. After the substrates were cleaned carefully, dried and plasma-treated with oxygen, PEDOT:PSS films of 40 nm thickness were spin-coated on top to modify the ITO anodes, followed by baking at 200 °C for 10 min. Then, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled dry glove box, and the 80–100 nm blended active layers of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) or PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) were spin-casted from their solutions comprising a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (97:3, v/v). Subsequently, the 3FPy CILs were spin-coated from their 0.5 mg mL−1 solution in MeOH (with trace AcOH) at 2000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, the Al cathodes of 100 nm thin layers were thermally deposited through a shadow mask (defined active area of 0.16 cm2) in a chamber.
OSC characterization
The thickness of organic layers was estimated using Profilometry (Veeco Dektak150). A Keithley 236 source meter was used to measure the J–V curves. The spectral responses were recorded on a commercial photo-modulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel). The photosensitivity was determined with a calibrated Si photodiode. The photovoltaic performance was measured under an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). The sun simulation power was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell before the tests.
