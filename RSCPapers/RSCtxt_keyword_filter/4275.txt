    , Accepted 6th October 2017First published on 7th October 2017AbstractFullerene-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) represent one of the current state-of-the-art organic solar cells. Nonetheless, most of these devices still suffer from adverse performance degradation due to thermally induced morphology changes of active layers. We herein demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance stability of BHJ-OSCs can be profoundly enhanced with an appositely functionalized 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile. The latter, through charge transfer (CT) interactions with a donor polymer, enables the formation of a “frozen” 3-dimensional mesh-like donor polymer matrix, which effectively restrains free movement of embedded fullerene molecules and suppresses their otherwise uncontrolled aggregation. 9-Fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives with multiple CT interaction sites are particularly effective as preservation of a power conversion efficiency of over 90% under severe thermal stress has been accomplished. The generality of this novel strategy has been affirmed with several common donor polymers, manifesting it to be hitherto the most efficient approach to stabilized fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) with active layers comprising a polymer electron donor and a fullerene electron acceptor have been a prevalent topic of intense research.1,2 One of the primary driving forces stems from their perceived facile solution processability, which would enable high-throughput roll-to-roll fabrication leading to low-cost manufacturing.3,4 Other potential attributes relate to their lightweight and structural flexibility characteristics which may be useful for portable devices and other niche applications.5–7 Fullerene acceptors have been widely studied in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) owing to their reasonably high electron mobility, solution processability and compatibility with many donor polymer materials.8–10 They have also provided excellent photovoltaic properties with state-of-the-art donor polymers. However, most of the fullerene based BHJ-OSCs suffer from rapid performance degradation over time, particularly upon exposure to elevated temperatures.11–14 This is largely due to the propensity of fullerene acceptors to aggregate into undesirably large and discontinuous domains in the active layer.12,13 Such polymer donor/fullerene acceptor phase segregation not only leads to reduced donor–acceptor (D–A) interfaces with detrimental effects to exciton separation and diffusion, but also disruption of charge conduction pathways. Accordingly, the morphology of active layers plays a decisive role in impacting the photovoltaic performance of BHJ-OSCs.14–21 While many strategies including solvent annealing, incorporation of ternary components, cross-linkable fullerene derivatives, etc. have been employed to optimize and stabilize the active layer morphology with varying degrees of success, it remains extremely challenging to sustain thermal stability without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance.22–25 A favorable active layer morphology, besides being compositionally graded in the vertical direction for charge collection and having favorable molecular orientation for charge transport, should possess a continuous network of nanodomains of semiconducting materials for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.26–30
We herein report our structural engineering strategy to enhance the thermal stability of the active layer morphology, thereby helping preserve and sustain the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs under greatly increased thermal exposure. Our strategy involves “freezing” of the donor polymer matrix through charge transfer (CT) interactions with an appropriate electron-deficient compound such as a 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative, leading to the formation of a presumably three-dimensional (3D) “mesh-like” donor polymer matrix network in the active layer. When uniformly dispersed in this mesh-like polymer network structure, fullerene acceptor molecules can be visualized as being captured within the network “cavities”, capable of forming nanodomains, but are substantially restrained in movement from aggregating into undesirably large domains even under prolonged thermal exposure. This would enable stable and continuous fullerene nanodomain structures for efficient exciton dissociation and transport, thus resulting in sustained photovoltaic performance over prolonged thermal exposure. The beneficial effects of such a 3D mesh-like polymer matrix in sustaining thermal photovoltaic performance stability have been unequivocally supported by the experimental results of charge transport, trap density, and morphological studies of the active layer in the presence of an appropriate 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative.
2. Results and discussion
Through systematic studies on the electronic interactions of electron-deficient compounds with electron donor polymers, we observed that certain 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives (Fig. 1) were capable of interacting with donor polymers through CT interactions. Strong CT interactions of this nature may be expected to lead to physical “crosslinking” of the donor polymer; thus a suitably functionalized 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative with a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or high electron affinity may function as a suitable CT crosslinking or polymer matrix freezing agent. From this perspective, a dimeric or trimeric acceptor containing 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile moieties would be particularly efficient. These materials, which carry multiple active sites for CT interactions within a single molecule, would enable the formation of a 3D mesh-like polymer network structure. This “cavity” containing network would impede the movements of embedded fullerene molecules, suppressing their diffusion and otherwise uncontrolled aggregation into relatively large domains. Our results showed that the incorporation of a minute quantity of an appropriate 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative into the active layers of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs effectively hampered fullerene aggregation, resulting in sustained photovoltaic performance characteristics. The preservation of photovoltaic performance of over 90% of the PCE after extended thermal exposure at high temperatures (∼100 °C for over 20 hours) has been experimentally accomplished. To the best of our knowledge, this represents hitherto the best approach to enhancing the thermal stability of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs.

2.1 Molecular design of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile additives
As CT interaction involves electron transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of an electron donor to the LUMO of an electron acceptor, a higher HOMO level and a lower LUMO level would generally favor CT interactions. The electron affinity of an electron acceptor, which measures its capacity to accept an electron, correlates directly with its LUMO level. The LUMO level of a fluorenylidene malononitrile acceptor can be readily manipulated through substitution on the fluorenylidene malononitrile nucleus with electron withdrawing functionalities such as carbonyl, carboxylic, and nitro groups, among others to achieve the desirable electron affinity. Its physical properties such as polymer compatibility and solubility characteristics to facilitate solution processing can also be modulated with appropriate alkyl or carboxylic ester substitution. Accordingly, 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives are attractive electronic agents which can be employed to interact with the electron donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers commonly utilized as donor polymers in BHJ-OSCs. Specifically, with a reasonably low lying LUMO, a 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative can effectively form CT bonding with the donor moieties of a D–A polymer, leading to a physically crosslinked donor polymer network. Depending on the mode and efficacy of CT interactions, the crosslinked donor polymer matrix with varying degrees of crosslink density can exert modulating effects on the movements of fullerene molecules. This will have decisive consequences on the distribution and stability of fullerene acceptor dispersions and thus the micro- and nano-structural morphology of the active layer.
The fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives that were utilized in our studies as electronic agents or additives are depicted in Fig. 1 and Scheme S1.† Details of their synthesis and characterization are described in the Experimental section.† We selected carboxylic ester and nitro substitutions to modulate the solubility and LUMO of the 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile chromophore as these offered ease of synthesis and attainment of desirable LUMOs. Three small molecular 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives, PCFM (I), 1-NPCFM (II), and 2-NPCFM (III), differing structurally in the number of nitro substitutions, and thus their LUMO levels in the descending order of −3.87 eV, −4.13 eV, and −4.32 eV respectively from vacuum, were investigated. Since the crosslinking of a polymer would be far more effective with a divalent or polyvalent agent, we therefore also designed an appropriate fluorenylidene malononitrile dimer, BDFB (IV), and trimer, TDFA (V), for our studies.
2.2 Photovoltaic performance
For our photovoltaic evaluation, we utilized a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The active layer of the control device was composed of a donor polymer, poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl} or PTB7, and a fullerene acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester or PC71BM, while for those of experimental devices under investigation, less than 1 weight percent (wt%) of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative was incorporated. The devices were thermally annealed at different temperatures for 20 hours each before electrical characterization was carried out using AM 1.5G illumination with a 100 mW cm−2 solar simulator. Fig. 2 shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the control device and 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile-incorporated devices at different annealing temperatures. The device parameters and detailed photovoltaic performance [short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE)] are summarized in Table S1.† When added in a minor quantity (<1 wt%) into the active layer, PCFM (I) was found to be beneficial in preserving the thermal stability of the photovoltaic performance of the fullerene BHJ-OSC devices, and the optimum quantity was found to be about 0.8% by weight. Specifically, both the as-prepared control and PCFM-incorporated devices without thermal annealing exhibited essentially similar photovoltaic performance characteristics. Upon thermal treatment at 100 °C for 20 hours, the PCFM-incorporated device showed preservation of over 85% of its original PCE while the control device exhibited severe performance deterioration with over 30% drop in PCE (from 7.7% to 5.3%). The latter was due largely to a degradation in FF (from 62% to 47%) and a concomitant decrease in Jsc (by 2 mA cm−2). These experimental observations were in agreement with our hypothesis that the CT interaction of PCFM with donor polymer PTB7 led to donor polymer crosslinking. The crosslinked donor polymer matrix effectively suppressed thermally induced migration and the ensuing aggregation of fullerene molecules into undesirably large domains, thus effectively preventing disruption in exciton dissociation and charge transport. On the other hand, utilization of stronger electron acceptors such as 1-NPCFM (II) or 2-NPCFM (III) as active layer additives invoked over 20% drop in PCE even without thermal treatment (Fig. S1 and Table S1†). The negative effects of 1-NPCFM and 2-NPCFM could be attributed to their much higher electron affinities (or significantly lower LUMOs), which rendered them excellent electron traps, adversely interfering in charge transport as well as mitigating their CT interactions with the donor polymer in crosslinking upon electron acceptance.

The dimeric and trimeric 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivatives, BDFB (IV) and TDFA (V) (Table 1), which would greatly enhance CT interactions with donor polymers, were also synthesized for investigation. These materials, which carried similar 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile moieties within their molecules, possessed approximately the same LUMO levels as that of PCFM (ca. −3.9 to −3.8 eV), and were not expected to negatively interfere in charge transport in the active layer. Since they were prepared without thermal annealing, both the devices with BDFB and TDFA additives exhibited similar performance characteristics as the control device (Jsc ≈ 16 mA cm−2, Voc ≈ 0.76 V, FF ≈ 64%, PCE ≈ 7.8%). Upon heating at 100 °C for 20 hours, both BDFB and TDFA-incorporated devices were observed to perform admirably well, preserving over 90% of their original PCEs. The dimeric fluorenylidene malononitrile additive, BDFB, was particularly effective as essentially no change in Jsc was noted with its overall PCE degraded only about 7% from its original value. It should be noted that all Jsc's were in agreement with their external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. S2†).

2.3 Charge carrier transport and subgap absorption properties
To understand the role and mechanism of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile in thermal stabilization of the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs, we accordingly conducted more detailed characterization studies on the devices with the most efficient dimeric additive, BDFB. The charge transport properties of active layers under thermally annealed conditions were investigated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic, and extract zero-field hole and electron mobility. Corresponding single-carrier diodes were employed for measurements. The electric-field dependent current of the samples was measured and the carrier mobility was extracted using the following equation:  where JSCL is the space-charged-limited current density, d is the thickness of the tested layer, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the polymer, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, β is the field-dependent coefficient, and F is the average electric field applied on the sample.31,32
At room temperature, both the control and BDFB-incorporated active layer (BHJ) films displayed approximately similar hole and electron mobility (∼1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Upon thermal annealing at 100 °C for 20 hours, the control BHJ film showed a one order of magnitude drop in hole mobility (10−4 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and nearly two orders of magnitude decrease in electron mobility (10−4 to 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). This imbalance of electron and hole mobility would account for the observed lower FF of the control device.33 On the other hand, the BDFB-incorporated BHJ film suffered from comparatively smaller degradations in both hole (1.2 × 10−4 to 7.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobility (1.1 × 10−4 to 6.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. 3 and Table S1†), thus manifesting the stabilization effect of BDFB additive on the BHJ film morphology.

The defect and trap densities of the thermally annealed BHJ films were analyzed by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) to probe the subgap absorptions.34–37 For simplicity and clarity, we showed only the PDS spectra of each film before and after annealing at 100 °C for 20 hours (Fig. 4; see Fig. S3† for detailed spectral properties). For the control films, we observed a noticeable increase in the subgap absorption after thermal annealing as compared to BDFB-incorporated films. The subgap absorption was quantified by estimating the nominal trap state density (N) of the films using the optical sum rule:38  where E is the photon energy, c is the speed of light, n is the refractive index, m is the effective mass of an electron, e is the elementary charge, and ħ is the Planck constant. αsub represents the subtracted subgap absorption by Urbach absorption [αsub(E) = α(E) − αu(E), where αu = α0exp(hν − Eg/Eu) for E < Eg, and Eu is the Urbach energy39]. The increased trap densities after thermal stress are presented in Table S3.† As can be noted, the BDFB-incorporated film exhibited one order lower trap density increment as compared to the control film. These results suggest that the additive BDFB impeded trap generation during thermal stress, and the traps were likely due to unfavorable morphological changes. These observations were also in agreement with the observed stable FF of the BDFB-incorporated BHJ-OSC devices as a similar relationship between FF and trap density had earlier been reported.37,40,41

2.4 Active layer morphology analysis
To shed light on the effect of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile additive on molecular ordering and nanoscale phase separation of PC71BM in the BHJ film, grazing incidence wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS and GISAXS) measurements were conducted.42–44 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of BHJ films, with and without the BDFB additive, thermally annealed at different temperatures are presented in Fig. S4.† For all these films, ring-like lamellar and p–p stacking peaks were observed at approximately the same position (q ≈ 0.34 Å−1 and 1.75 Å−1), indicating that the addition of BDFB did not exert any observable effects on the molecular packing in the BHJ films. In sharp contrast, the influence of BDFB on nanoscale phase separation was distinctly noted in GISAXS measurements. Fig. 5(a) shows the 2D GISAXS patterns with the corresponding intensity integrals along the qr direction. The intensity integral [Fig. 5(b)] of the control film (without BDFB) shifted to lower q in the medium q region (∼0.01–0.05 Å−1) and turned up in the low q region (<0.006 Å−1) after thermal annealing (100 °C for 20 h), demonstrating severe morphological instability of the control film. For the film with BDFB, the intensity integral displayed significantly smaller changes under similar conditions, reflecting the efficacy of BDFB in freezing the film morphology. The estimated domain sizes of the aggregated PC71BM clusters (Rg_PC71BM) from the fitting results and the amorphous intermixing phase are summarized in Table S2.† The percentage changes in domain size are presented in Fig. 5(c). As can be noted, the domain size of the control film was more than double for both phases at an annealing temperature of 100 °C, while for the BDFB-incorporated film, the domain size increments were less than about 40% at the same annealing temperature.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to visualize the effects of BDFB incorporation into the BHJ film. The TEM images of the BHJ films with and without BDFB incorporation are shown in Fig. 6. The TEMs of both BHJ films with and without the BDFB additive show a relatively uniform morphology before heating. After thermal annealing, substantial fullerene and donor polymer aggregations were visibly noted in the film without BDFB (bright and dark spots/regions), while the film with the BDFB additive retained its relatively uniform morphology even after thermal annealing. In addition, a continuous mesh-like network structure of the donor polymer matrix was visually evident in the BHJ film with the BDFB additive, which was significantly more pronounced after heating. These observations correlated well with the X-ray scattering results, and provided unequivocal affirmation on the formation of a “frozen” 3D mesh-like network structure of the donor polymer matrix in the BDFB-incorporated BHJ films.

2.5 Charge transfer interactions
The combined results of charge transport studies and structural morphology analysis of active layer compositions with and without 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile additives such as BDFM unequivocally point to the role of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile additive as a capable CT crosslinking agent for donor polymers such as PTB7 through CT interactions. The resulting crosslinked donor polymer matrix effectively restrained thermally induced fullerene migration and impeded its microscale aggregation, leading to enhanced stability of the BHJ nanophase morphology in the active layer. To substantiate the existence of CT interaction between BDFM and PTB7, we conducted spectroscopic and steady-state photoluminescence studies of PTB7 films with and without BDFM. Fig. 7(a) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PTB7 films with and without 0.8 wt% of BDFM. In the presence of the BDFM additive, slight redshifts of the vibrational absorption peaks at 608 nm (0–1) and 660 nm (0–0) to 625 nm and 675 nm respectively, together with a concomitant increase in the (0–0) vibrational peak intensity at the expense of the (0–1) peak, were observed. These results clearly manifested higher degrees of molecular ordering in the BDFM-incorporated film.45,46 Moreover, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) studies showed that BDFM effectively quenched the photoluminescence of PTB7 [Fig. 7(b)]. Specifically, the incorporation of 0.8% by weight of BDFM into the PTB7 film led to a two-thirds decrease in its photoluminescence intensity. It was thus reasonable to assume that the free movement of fullerene was restricted by the resulting 3D mesh-like donor polymer matrix structure formed from the CT interactions of BDFB and the donor polymer upon BDFB addition. Other weak intermolecular interactions such as van der Waals force are too weak to pull together or physically crosslink the donor polymers. The CT interactions are much stronger, much like the hydrogen bonding which has been shown to crosslink fluorine-containing donor polymers.25

A schematic diagram portraying CT interactions leading to a crosslinked donor matrix is depicted in Fig. 8. Such a 3D mesh-like donor polymer matrix would effectively impede free movements of fullerene molecules, preventing them from forming undesirably large domains even when subjected to an external thermal stimulus. This would result in a more stable charge transport environment with reduced trap density and better photovoltaic performance.

To demonstrate the generality of the present approach of utilizing 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile as an effective BHJ morphology stabilizer, two other different donor polymers, namely poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl], or PTB7-Th, and regioregular poly(n-hexythiophene), or P3HT, were utilized. Fig. S8† summarizes the thermal stability of the photovoltaic properties of BHJ-OSC devices using PTB7-Th:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layers with and without the BDFM additive. The corresponding J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig. S9.† With PTB7-Th as the donor polymer, the device with the BDFM additive maintained very good photovoltaic performance after heating at 100 °C for 20 hours, showing excellent thermal stability as compared to the device without the BDFM additive. Likewise, the P3HT device with the BDFM additive also demonstrated excellent thermal stability in its photovoltaic performance after annealing at 70 °C. The corresponding P3HT device without the BDFM additive exhibited a significant drop in PCE under similar thermal annealing conditions, due largely to a significant loss in FF. It should be mentioned that in the case of P3HT, 70 °C was used as the annealing temperature as these devices could not withstand 100 °C for 20 hours. These results have once again affirmatively demonstrated the general utility and efficacy of this strategy for the stabilization of the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs.
3. Conclusions
Through molecular design, charge transport, and spectroscopic studies, together with grazing incidence wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis, we have unequivocally demonstrated that an ultra-low concentration of an appositely functionalized 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative is extremely efficient in enhancing the thermal stability of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs. The stabilization stems from the CT interactions of 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile with a donor polymer in locking up the donor polymer chains, leading to the formation of a frozen 3D mesh-like donor polymer matrix in the active layer. This has provided an effective impediment to thermally induced diffusion and aggregation of embedded fullerene molecules in the crosslinked donor polymer matrix, thus imparting significantly enhanced thermal stability to the BHJ morphology of the active layer. A suitably low LUMO level close to −4 eV would be required for CT interactions without adversely impacting charge transport properties; much lower LUMO levels lead to electron trapping, lower charge transport rates, and thus lower PCEs. The 4-alkoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative, which has a LUMO level of about −3.9 eV, represents an effective agent for the stabilization of fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs with common donor polymers such as PTB7, PTB7-Th or P3HT. The dimeric 9-fluorenylidene malononitrile derivative, BDFM, which carries two electron-deficient sites for CT interaction within a single molecule, is particularly effective. As much as over 90% of the PCE could be preserved even after severe thermal stress of exposure to 100 °C for 20 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is hitherto the most effective strategy to enhance the thermal stability of fullerene-based OSCs.
