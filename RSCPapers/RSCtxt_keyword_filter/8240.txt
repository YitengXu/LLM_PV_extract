    , Accepted 7th July 2021First published on 7th July 2021AbstractHere, a pseudo-solution-phase ligand exchange (p-SPLE) strategy is developed for fabricating a CsPbI3 quantum dot (QD) solar cell. Using short organic aromatic ligands to partly replace the long-chain ligands in a QD solution, the p-SPLE treated CsPbI3 QD solar cell had an enhanced power conversion efficiency of up to 14.65% together with improved stability.
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention for the next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) due to their tunable bandgap, solution processability and multi-exciton generation effect.1,2 The development of solution-phase ligand exchange (SPLE) enables the preparation of a ready-to-coat conductive QD ink,3,4 minimizing the procedures needed for fabricating QD PVs. Such an SPLE process not only simplifies the fabrication process, but also assists the removal of long insulating ligands, and hence significantly enhances the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to over 13% in PbS CQD solar cells.5,6 In 2015, the emergence of caesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I or mixed halides) QDs paved a new avenue for QD PVs.7 During the past five years, lots of solid-state ligand post-treatment methods were reported to improve the interdot electronic transport and passivate surface defects, and over 15% PCE was achieved in the case of CsPbI3 perovskite QD PVs.8–16 However, for solid state treatment, inadequate ligand exchange and the formation of surface defects further limits the carrier transport between neighbouring QDs as well as the stability.8 Due to their more dynamic surface species, surface manipulation of perovskite QDs has been proven to be significantly different than that of conventional chalcogenide QDs like PbS.17,18 The presence of long and insulating organic capping ligands can assist the solution dispersion and phase stability of perovskite QDs, while hinder the carrier transport and extraction between neighbouring QDs. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to develop different SPLEs for perovskite QDs to further enhance their PV performance.
Quite recently, it was found that the introduction of short organic aromatic conjugated ligands can enhance the charge carrier delocalization,19,20 resulting in an effective interdot electronic coupling. In addition, the steric hindrance effect of the benzene ring can suppress the [PbI6]4− framework distortion21 relative to the alkyl chain ligand, sustaining the QD-structure stability during the SPLE. More importantly, a functionalized aromatic ligand, e.g. fluorination, can improve the hydrophobicity of QD arrays and mitigate ion migration,13,22 which is beneficial for the enhancement of the stability. Here, a pseudo-SPLE (p-SPLE) strategy was first developed to partly substitute the long insulating ligands of oleate (OA−) and oleylammonium (OAm+) with phenylethyl ammonium (PEA+) or 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl ammonium (FPEA+). The short and functional PEA+ and FPEA+ ligands could efficiently passivate the surface defects and suppress the nonradiative recombination, leading to an enhancement of photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) (73.4% for the control QDs, 82.6% for PEA and 88.1% for FPEA p-SPLE CsPbI3 QDs). Both PEA and FPEA treated CsPbI3 QDs exhibited an improved PV performance, obtaining a champion PCE of 14.65%. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated FPEA capped CsPbI3 QD solar cell exhibited an improved stability, maintained at 75% (720 hours aging) and 86% (135 hours aging) of its initial efficiency under storage in N2 condition and ambient conditions.
The CsPbI3 QDs capped with OA− and OAm+ ligands were prepared according to a previous report.23 As depicted in Fig. 1, the p-SPLE strategy introduces the mixed antisolvent of methyl acetate (MeOAc) and phenylethylamine (PEA) or 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylamine (FPEA) into the CsPbI3 QD crude solution during the second QD purifying procedure. To obtain the best-performing CsPbI3 QDs, we optimized the volume ratios of PEA in MeOAc from 1:3000 to 1:100. The attachment of PEA to the CsPbI3 QD surface is confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Fig. S1, ESI†), where the distinct ν(CC) resonances13 of the benzene ring centred at 1588 cm−1 appears in the p-SPLE QD films. Moreover, UV-vis absorption, PL spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed to evaluate the effect of PEA p-SPLE on the optical properties and morphology of CsPbI3 QDs. As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 (ESI†), both absorption and PL peaks display a red-shift trend as the volume ratio increases, and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM, Table S1, ESI†) of the corresponding emission peaks gradually decreased, which may be attributed to the increase in QD size or uniformity. The hypothesis was further confirmed by the TEM characterization. As shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S3, S4 (ESI†), the average size is ∼10.5 nm for the control QDs and ∼11.5 nm for the PEA treated QDs. Meanwhile, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was applied to study the photoexcited carrier dynamics of CsPbI3 QDs. The average decay lifetimes (fitted by a biexponential decay, Fig. S5, ESI†) were prolonged from 43.6 ns for the control to 72.4 ns for the PEA (1:100) treated QD solution, revealing that the surfaces of the CsPbI3 QDs were sufficiently passivated by PEA+. However, at a higher PEA content (1:100), the p-SPLE CsPbI3 QDs exhibited a low production yield for fabricating QD solar cells. We believe that excess PEA may lead to QD agglomeration,24 which were centrifuged out. Hence, we chose the p-SPLE CsPbI3 QDs with a PEA volume ratio of 1:500 for solar cell fabrication.

Under the same circumstances, we further explored the performance of the fluorinated ligand, FPEA, on the p-SPLE due to its similar chemical structure but with an additional hydrophobic nature. The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra (Fig. 2a) of the FPEA p-SPLE QDs show a similar red-shift compared to that of the PEA based one, indicating an enhanced QD electronic coupling. Meanwhile, the FWHMs of the PL peaks (listed in Table S2, ESI†) further decreased from 33.2 nm for PEA to 32.8 nm for FPEA treated QDs. The red shift and narrower FWHM of the emission peaks indicate a larger and more uniform QD size, which is further supported by the TEM images shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The average size is ∼10.5 nm for control QDs and ∼11.5 nm for FPEA treated QDs, respectively. Additionally, high-resolution TEM (Fig. S6, ESI†) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S7, ESI†) was employed to investigate the crystal structure of CsPbI3 QDs before and after p-SPLE treatment. It is apparent that there was no change in peak numbers and the QDs maintained a black perovskite phase12 after p-SPLE. However, the position of the (100) diffraction peak slightly shifted to larger angles after p-SPLE, which may be ascribed to the existence of surface strain induced by the steric hindrance effect of the benzene ring.25,26 PLQY and TRPL were carried out to further evaluate the effects of PEA and FPEA p-SPLE on the charge carrier dynamics of CsPbI3 QDs. As shown in Fig. 2a and c, the enhanced PLQY (88.1%) and longer average decay lifetime (79.9 ns) elucidate that nonradiative recombination was effectively suppressed, which may be due to the surface passivation by FPEA.
To further gain insight into the mechanism of p-SPLE treatment, FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to study the QD surface environment and chemical bonding. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S8 (ESI†), stretching modes relating to OAm+ (ν(N–H3+), 3135 cm−1) and OA− (νasym. (COO−) at 1535 cm−1 and νsym. (COO−) at 1406 cm−1) ligands27 are observed in all the QD films. Besides, we observe the appearance of the ν(CC) resonance peaks of the benzene ring in the region of 1600–1480 cm−1 in PEA and FPEA treated QD samples, and the resonances centred at 1227 and 1158 cm−1 of ν(C–F)28 were further distinguished in the FPEA treated QD film. XPS (Fig. S9a, ESI†) can also detect the change of QD surface environment. Fig. 2b displays the C 1s core level spectra of CsPbI3 QD films with or without (w/wo) p-SPLE, where the C–C peak of PEA (285.5 eV) and FPEA (285.4 eV) treated QDs exhibit a shift to lower binding energy relative to the control one (285.6 eV). Furthermore, a new peak in the p-SPLE QDs appears at a higher binding energy, which is consistent with the π–π bonding in the phenyl group.29 Meanwhile, the N 1s core level spectra (Fig. 3c) shows variations among the three QD films. In addition to the coexisting peak of NH3+ (from the OAm+ ligand) at a binding energy of 402.7 eV, we also identified additional peaks located at 400.0 eV for PEA and 400.4 eV for FPEA treated QDs. These FTIR and XPS results provide experimental evidence to prove the attachment of aromatic conjugated ligands onto the QD surface.

More direct evidence that FPEA is on the CsPbI3 QD surface is from a new peak at a binding energy of 688.1 eV in the F 1s core-level spectra (Fig. S9b, ESI†). In comparison with the control QDs, we also find a slight shift to a lower binding energy in both the Pb 4f and I 3d core level spectra after PEA and FPEA p-SPLE treatment (Fig. 3d), suggesting the formation of coordination bonds between aromatic ammonium ligands and uncoordinated Pb2+ ions.30 Other constituent elements, including Cs and O, are shown in Fig. S9c–e (ESI†), where no significant variations of the core level peak positions and shapes are observed. From the XPS results, we believe that the enhanced optical properties of the p-SPLE CsPbI3 QDs are consistent with expectations of a reduction in defects due to QD surface passivation.
Finally, to evaluate the PV performance of the p-SPLE CsPbI3 QDs, we fabricated a solar cell with an architecture of glass/FTO/TiO2 (40 nm)/CsPbI3 QDs (400 nm)/PTAA (70 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (120 nm), shown in Fig. 4a. The corresponding energy-level positions9,31 are shown in Fig. 4b (inset). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 4b, with the detailed PV parameters listed in Table S3 (ESI†). Compared with the control device, both PEA and FPEA treated QDs exhibited an enhanced open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current density (JSC), corresponding overall PCEs of 14.18% and 14.65%, respectively, outperforming the control one (13.36%). The enhanced VOC and JSC are attributed to the effectively passivated surface defects and improved electronic coupling after FPEA p-SPLE treatment. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs, Fig. S10, ESI†) confirm the reliability of JSC obtained from the J–V curves. Fig. 4c shows the long-time stability of unencapsulated CsPbI3 QD solar cell stored in a N2 glove box. As expected, the efficiency of the FPEA p-SPLE CsPbI3 QD solar cell maintained at 75% of its initial PCE after 720 h, while that of the control device was reduced to 30% of its initial PCE. The enhancement in N2 stability of p-SPLE PV may be attributed to the mitigation of ion migration.22 Meanwhile, the hydrophobic PEA+ and FPEA+ ligands protect the CsPbI3 QD arrays from ambient moisture,22 which endows the p-SPLE solar cells a higher air stability than that of the control one (Fig. S11, ESI†). This result is further proved by the deionized water contact angle measurement. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the contact angles of QD films improve from 66° for the control sample to 88° for the PEA pre-treated sample and to the 93° for the FPEA pre-treated sample, respectively.

In conclusion, we first developed a p-SPLE strategy for CsPbI3 QDs through the addition of the short organic functional ligands PEA and FPEA into the polar solvent MeOAc during the QD purifying process. The aromatic ammonium ligands can substitute the long-chain ligands to improve the electronic coupling while effectively passivating the surface defects of the QDs. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic PEA+ and FPEA+ ligands protect the QD arrays from ambient moisture. Benefitting from these advantages, the QD solar cells based on PEA and FPEA p-SPLE treated QDs exhibit enhanced PCEs, achieving best values of up to 14.65%. More importantly, the unencapsulated devices exhibit improved long-term stabilities, maintaining 75% and 86% of their initial efficiencies after ageing under N2 conditions (720 h) and ambient conditions (135 h), respectively. We believe that this work could provide a new approach for fabricating efficient optoelectronic devices based on emerging perovskite QDs.
