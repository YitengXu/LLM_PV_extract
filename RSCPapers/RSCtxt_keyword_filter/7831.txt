With the extended conjugated skeleton, their absorption spectra become progressively bathochromic shifted from the red region to the near-infrared region. The compound TAC with four carbazole units exhibits a strong near-infrared absorption up to 850 nm with a high extinction coefficient over 135000 M−1 cm−1 and considerable intrinsic hole mobility of 4.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in SCLC devices.

Introduction
Nowadays star-shaped molecules having a π-conjugated structure have attracted considerable attention as donor or acceptor materials in solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs).1–8 Generally, such molecules exhibit intriguing properties, such as high thermal stability, isotropic absorption, and good solubility.9–12 Furthermore, the enlarged π-conjugated structure can bring forth a strong propensity for stacking into 1D columns as the preferred charge transporting pathway, which helps to improve the carrier mobilities of the materials.13–15 So far, the reported star-shaped molecules are frequently developed through tanglesome synthetic methodologies from several well-known cores, such as phenylene,16–18 triphenylamine19–21 and truxene.22–25 Thus, more efforts should be focused on the seeking of new cores and straightforward synthetic methodologies, in order to develop advanced star-shaped molecular materials contributing to high efficiency OSCs.
Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, with outstanding chemical and photochemical stabilities, redox activity, and optical features, can be easily tailored by chemical transformation.26,27 The facile modifications of the four methylene groups at the 1, 7 and 3, 5 positions of the BODIPY can efficiently extend the conjugated skeleton, which endows the desirable characteristics, especially, the long wavelength spectral properties.28–32 Although BODIPY should be a valuable core in the development of large conjugated molecules, to our knowledge, there are only several reports on the syntheses BODIPY-cored star-shaped materials, and their applications are rarely known.33,34
Carbazole has good hole-transporting and electron-donating capabilities and is one of the often adopted design elements in the p-type (hole transportation) organic semiconductors.35 In general, the carbazole-based donor materials have a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, which leads to higher values (>0.8 V) for open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the OSC devices.36–39 However, there are few long wavelength carbazole-modified BODIPY derivatives that are successful applied in OSCs.
Very recently, R. Ziessel et al. have demonstrated the high-efficiency OSC devices with thiophene-modified BODIPY derivatives as the donor materials, which marked one of the significant advances of this dye family's applications.40 In addition, we focus on our efforts for developing novel BODIPY derivatives that are good candidates for the long wavelength dyes.29,30 And we found that the introduction of the carbazole groups to BODIPY core is a feasible way to optimize spectral properties, as it leads to an evident extension of π-conjugation and the formation of moderate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) structures, which would contribute to a remarkable red shift in absorption spectra and an improvement in hole transportation. These excellent results inspired us to further investigate their potential applications in OSCs.
In this contribution, a series of star-shaped BODIPY derivatives (SAC, DAC, and TAC), containing different carbazole units (Scheme 1), are designed and synthesized. The compound TAC with four carbazole units exhibits strong near-infrared absorption, good solubility, high thermal stability and high hole mobility. The investigations of the OSC devices have generated a positive result. OSCs using TAC as donor and PC61BM as acceptor show higher open-circuit voltages than those of the non-carbazole BODIPY derivatives, and give a potential power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.70%, which is much better than those of the OSCs based on SAC and DAC, which contain one and two carbazole units respectively.

Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The synthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 1. These BODIPY derivatives were synthesized through classical Knoevenagel condensation which had been proven efficiently for extending of π-conjugation by many research groups.28–32,43 Under the same reaction conditions as the synthesis of SAC with 1 eq. carbazole aldehyde of BODIPY, 3 eq. and 6 eq. carbazole aldehyde of BODIPY would be prepared for synthesizing DAC and TAC, respectively. In addition, compared with the other twos, TAC increases two benzyl formate groups for improving solubility (it will be discussed later). The compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF HRMS. And their thermal properties were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All of them possess good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td) higher than 300 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Solubility and DFT calculation
It should be noted that solubility plays an important role in solution-processed organic electronic devices. We found that TAC, bearing a large and rigid conjugated skeleton, exhibits high solubility (e.g. 50 mg mL−1 in CHCl3) in common organic solvents, while DAC has poor solubility, which are demonstrated by quantum-chemical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Fig. 1). Although, through alkene double bond, four carbazole groups are conjugated grafted onto the BODIPY core to form an integrated conjugated skeleton, there are certain torsion angles between all the branches and the core, namely 38°, 26° for 1, 7-position and 24°, 10° for 3, 5-position. By contract, compound DAC, in spite of its smaller π-conjugation, shows a highly planar structure with two torsion angles no more than 8° at 3, 5-position (Fig. S2, ESI†). According to our previous study,15 such non-coplanar structure of a large conjugated molecule helps to enhance the solubility by inhibiting the excessive aggregation effect that often hampers many big π-conjugated materials to apply in solution-processed organic electron devices. The non-planarity/planarity feature would result in the different solubility and has critical influence on the quality of the organic thin films. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), their HOMO orbitals are delocalized throughout the whole conjugated structures, while their LUMO orbitals are mainly localized on the BODIPY cores, which illustrates certain extent electron would transfer from carbazole groups to BODIPY cores. These results are in accordance with our designing strategies: extending π-conjugations and forming moderate ICT.

Photophysical properties
Normalized absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of TAC, DAC and SAC in toluene solutions (10−6 M) are shown in Fig. 2a. Absorption spectra of TAC in solution cover a broad wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm and exhibit an absorption peak of 728 nm with the biggest extinction coefficients of 135000 M−1 cm−1, which is attributed to the enlarged π-conjugated molecular structure. Whereas, due to the smaller π-conjugation, the absorption peaks of SAC and DAC are 590 and 674 nm, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The optical band gaps, calculated from the absorption onsets, are 1.98, 1.67, and 1.57 eV for SAC, DAC, and TAC, respectively, indicating that star-shaped TAC that bears more carbazole units can achieve the bigger effective conjugated length and the lower energy gap. Compared with the other twos, TAC shows the longest emission maxima of 755 nm. The absorption spectra in thin films were also examined (Fig. 2b). Compared with those in toluene solutions, their absorption spectra become broad and progressively red-shifted because of the intermolecular interaction between molecules. The main absorption peaks are 613, 708, and 761 nm for SAC, DAC, and TAC, respectively. Especially, the spectra of TAC show strong absorption from 650 nm to 850 nm, which is beneficial to realize strong near-infrared absorption.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of these compounds were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as electrolyte and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode in dichloromethane (Fig. 3). The HOMO level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level are estimated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential relative to the reference energy level of Fc/Fc+ (4.80 eV below vacuum).44 In their positive potential region, they exhibit similar onset oxidation potentials of about 0.55 V, and the HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.36, −5.34, and −5.34 eV for SAC, DAC, and TAC, respectively. In their negative potential region, the reduction onsets of the region are from −1.14 to −1.33 V. Their LUMO levels are corresponding to −3.47 eV for SAC, −3.52 eV for DAC, and −3.66 eV for TAC. The electrochemical band gaps calculated from the HOMO/LUMO ranges are 1.89, 1.82, and 1.68 eV for SAC, DAC, and TAC, respectively, which are close to the optical ones. The energy data indicate that all these compounds are suitable candidates to be used as electron donor materials when blended in OSCs. Importantly, the deeper HOMO levels, lower than that of poly(3-hexylthiophen-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) of −4.8 eV, is desirable for obtaining higher VOC in OSCs.45,46

Hole mobilities and photovoltaic device performances
The hole mobilities of the compounds were investigated using the steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, which is widely applied to evaluate the charge-transporting ability in organic optoelectronics. Using solution-processed way, the hole-only device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SAC(DAC/TAC)/Au. The SCLC in this case of mobility depending on the field can be approximated by the Mott–Gurney square law,47,48  where E is the electric field across the sample, ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant and the permittivity of the free space, respectively, and L is the thickness of the organic layer, with μ0 the zero-field mobility and γ describing the field activation of the mobility. As shown in Fig. 4, TAC has higher intrinsic hole mobility of 4.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, compared with the other two molecules (2.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SAC, 3.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DAC) under the same condition. The results illustrate that the conjugated skeleton of TAC, with more carbazole units, has been extended efficiently and its charge transporting ability has also been improved.

To demonstrate their OSC devices performance, using these compounds as donor materials blended with PC61BM, the standard device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TAC (or SAC):PC61BM/BCP/LiF/Al was fabricated without any thermal annealing or high boiling temperature additive in the solutions. In these devices, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) was used as the hole block material. Because of the poor solubility of DAC in o-dichlorobenzene, its OSC devices were not fabricated. The influence of blend composition (TAC:PC61BM) was investigated with the weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, while the optimized weight ratio is 1:3. The VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF), and PCE under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) are listed in Table 1, Fig. 5 and S4 (ESI†).

As we expected, all these devices based on TAC and SAC afford relatively high VOC values (>0.8 V), higher than those of BODIPY derivatives based on non-carbazole units,40,49,50 which is mainly attributed to the large difference (1.25 eV) between the HOMO level of TAC and the LUMO level (−4.10 eV) of PC61BM.51,52 The device based on TAC with the ratio of 1:3 exhibits the highest JSC of 8.17 mA cm−2 as well as the high VOC of 0.85 V. Therefore, the device gives the highest PCE of 2.70%. Although the device based on SAC exhibits a high VOC of 0.88 V, the lower JSC of 3.73 mA cm−2 results in the lower PCE of 1.20%. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the star-shaped TAC become broader and higher, which is attributed to the stronger and red-shifted absorption. Therefore, JSC of TAC is much higher than that of SAC. The calculated photocurrent densities from EQE spectra are consistent with those obtained from J–V measurements. In addition, the active layer morphologies were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S6, ESI†). The smaller roughest root-mean-square (RMS) surface value of 0.38 nm based on TAC would be beneficial to the charge transportation and therefore the higher JSC.
Experimental
Materials and characterization
All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and used without further purification. Solvents for chemical synthesis were purified according to the standard procedures. All chemical reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere. The indium-tin oxide (ITO) on glass was purchased from Xiangcheng Science and Technology Co. Ltd. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios 4083) was obtained from H. C. Starck Baytron. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are registered at room temperature on a Bruker 400 (or 500) MHz spectrometer using perdeuterated solvents as internal standard. Molecular weights were determined by using matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Melting points were obtained with a capillary melting point apparatus in open-ended capillaries and are uncorrected. Chromatographic purification was conducted with silica gel. All solvent mixtures were given as v/v ratios. UV spectra are recorded on TU-1901 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra are recorded on an F-4500 spectrometer. The slit width was 3 nm for both excitation and emission. Cyclic voltammetry were recorded on BSA100B/W system. The measurements were carried out with a conventional three-electrode system consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6). Ferrocene was used as a standard to calibrate the system. AFM images were obtained in tapping mode under atmospheric conditions.
Device fabrication and testing
The ITO glass plates were cleaned in a sonication bath in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially, dried by blowing nitrogen, and then the glasses were cleaned in oxygen plasma treatment for 10 min, and A PEDOT:PSS solution was then spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s onto the cleaned ITO surface resulting in a thickness of approximately 40 nm as determined with a Dektak surface profilometer. The PEDOT:PSS layer was annealed for 30 min at 120 °C in air.
A solution of active layer PC61BM and TAC (or SAC) were simultaneously dissolved in dichlorobenzene in a weight ratio of 1:3 at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 and stirred for 1 h at a temperature of 90 °C in oil bath. Before deposition of the active layer, the mixed solution of PC61BM:TAC was filtered through a PTFE syringe filter (0.45 μm pore size). The active layer was then spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS film at 600 rpm (dichlorobenzene) for 18 s resulting in a film thickness of ∼96 nm. Aluminum counter electrodes were evaporated through a shadow mask on top of the active layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm. The active area of the pixels as defined by the overlap of anode and cathode area was 12 mm2. The photovoltaic performance was determined under simulated sunlight using a commercial solar simulator (Zolix ss150 solar simulator, China). The EQE characterization of all devices was performed in air. The light output from a Xe lamp was monochromated by the Digichrom 240 monochromator and the short-circuit device photocurrent was monitored by the Kethley electrometer as the monochromator was scanned. A calibrated Si photodiode (818-UV Newport) was used as a reference in order to determine the intensity of the light incident on the device, allowing the EQE spectrum to be deduced.

General procedure for synthesis of BODIPY derivatives. BODIPY and carbazole aldehyde were refluxed in a mixture of toluene, acetic acid, and piperidine.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully designed and characterized a series of tunable absorbing star-shaped BODIPY derivatives. With four carbazole units, TAC shows extended π-conjugated framework featured by a partly non-coplanar configuration and exhibits a strong and broad long wavelength absorption, which benefits it harvesting the near-infrared solar light. And TAC has good solubility and high thermal stability, which are helpful factors for solution-processed organic film devices. More importantly, the intrinsic hole mobility of the star-shaped molecule TAC up to 4.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 is higher than those of the compounds with less carbazole branches. Further on, the resulting OSCs based on TAC as the donor materials exhibit a high VOC of 0.85 V and a reasonable PCE of 2.70%. This work suggests a feasible strategy to develop BODIPY-cored star-shaped semiconducting materials applicable for organic electronic devices.
