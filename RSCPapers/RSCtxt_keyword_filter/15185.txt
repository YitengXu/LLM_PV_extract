    , Accepted 15th January 2018First published on 16th January 2018AbstractThe carbon nanotube aerogel (CNA) with an ultra-low density, three-dimensional network nanostructure, superior electronic conductivity and large surface area is being widely employed as a catalytic electrode and catalytic support. Impressively, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) assembled with a CNA counter electrode (CE) achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.28%, which exceeded that of the conventional platinum (Pt)-based DSSC (7.20%) under the same conditions. Furthermore, highly dispersed CoS2 nanoparticles endowed with excellent intrinsic catalytic activity were hydrothermally incorporated to form a CNA-supported CoS2 (CNA–CoS2) CE, which was due to the large number of catalytically active sites and sufficient connections between CoS2 and the CNA. The electrocatalytic ability and stability were systematically evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization, which confirmed that the resultant CNA–CoS2 hybrid CE exhibited a remarkably higher electrocatalytic activity toward I3− reduction, and faster ion diffusion and electron transfer than the pure CNA CE. Such cost-effective DSSCs assembled with an optimized CNA–CoS2 CE yielded an enhanced PCE of 8.92%, comparable to that of the cell fabricated with the CNA–Pt hybrid CE reported in our published literature (9.04%). These results indicate that the CNA–CoS2 CE can be considered as a promising candidate for Pt-free CEs used in low-cost and high-performance DSSCs.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Kistler reported in the 1930s,1 aerogels have attracted great attention in many potential applications, covering a wide range of supercapacitors,2 filtration and separation,3 biomimetic surfaces4 and artificial muscles.5 So far, a variety of materials, such as silica,6 metals,7 carbon-based materials8,9 and polymers,10 have been prepared as ultra-flyweight cellular aerogels. Until now, many carbon materials (e.g. carbon dots, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene etc.) have been widely used in the fields of photocatalysis, sensors, renewable energy, etc.11–18 Owing to its ultrahigh porosity, exceptional electrical conductivity, and extremely high surface area,19 the carbon nanotube aerogel (CNA) material is theoretically regarded as a promising candidate for catalytic electrodes and catalytic supports. In fact, our previous studies have discussed its appliance as the counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).20 As one of the crucial components of DSSCs, the CE plays a key role in collecting electrons from an external circuit and transferring them from the CE to the electrolyte, followed by catalyzing the reduction of tri-iodide (I3−) to iodide (I−).21 Our findings show that the CNA CE exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for reducing I3−, which facilitates continuous dye regeneration, thus resulting in a significantly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than that of the conventional noble metal platinum (Pt)-based device.20 Our study further evidenced that immobilization of Pt nanoparticles onto CNA catalyst supports could offer higher electrocatalytic activity and the corresponding PCE is much higher than that of the cells using the CNA CE alone.22 However, the high price and scarcity of Pt greatly restrain its widespread applications in DSSCs. Moreover, Pt can be easily decomposed into PtI4 in the electrolyte traditionally containing an I3−/I− redox couple, which is detrimental to devices' long-term stability performance.23 Therefore, decorating a CNA with economical but efficient functional nanoparticles could be recognized as a practical way to further improve the PCE for the commercialization of CNA-based DSSCs. More recently, extensive studies have focused on using transition metal compounds, including alloys,24,25 nitrides,26,27 sulfides,28,29 phosphides,30,31 carbides,32,33 and oxides,34,35 as a new class of alternative catalytic materials owing to their abundant feedstock, low cost, excellent intrinsic catalytic activity for I3− reduction and the vast room in morphological tuning.36 Among them, cobalt sulfides (e.g. CoS,37–39 CoS2,40–42etc.) have won a prominent position due to their facile synthesis, nontoxicity, outstanding electrocatalytic capability and long-term stability. To date, despite the attractive advantages of and intensive efforts devoted to cobalt sulfide CEs, their relatively poor electrical conductivity limits their photovoltaic performance.43 In the present study, with a facile hydrothermal route, functional CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the CNA catalytic support (CNA–CoS2), which is developed as the potential Pt-free CE material in DSSCs. The CNA serves as a conductive scaffold supporting the CoS2 catalyst, while preventing it from aggregating. Our studies have revealed that the utilization of CoS2 nanoparticles exhibits great advantages in enhancing the catalytic activity and hence an impressive PCE of cells (8.92%), which is comparable to that of our previously reported device based on Pt nanoparticles supported on the CNA (CNA-Pt) CE (9.04%). Reports concerning the fabrication of CoS2 embedded in supporting carbon materials and their application as the CE in the DSSCs are rare, e.g. CoS2–graphene composite CE36 and CoS2 embedded carbon nanocage CE.43 The achieved PCE in both these publications, however, is significantly lower than that given in the present work. Therefore, the as-synthesized CNA–CoS2 hybrid CE endowed with abundant electrocatalytic activity sites and a fast electron transfer pathway has been demonstrated as a promising candidate for Pt-free CEs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of a CNA
A CNA is prepared through sol–gel and freeze drying processes, involving resorcinol and formaldehyde for the necessary condensation as well as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as the catalyst of polymerization reactions.20,22 Briefly, 0.05 g pristine CNTs (Nanocyl NC 7000, offered by Nanocyl, Belgium) were uniformly dispersed in 4.5 mL distilled water via sonication for 4 h. 0.4 g resorcinol, 0.6 g formaldehyde and 0.003 g Na2CO3 were added to 1.5 mL distilled water to form a homogeneous solution. The well-dispersed CNT suspension was poured into the above aqueous solution and then stirred with a magnetic bar for 1 h. Subsequently, the wet gel was further aged at 80 °C for 72 h to form a chemically cross-linked CNT, followed by freeze-drying to remove all the water from it. The obtained dry gel is carbonized at 1100 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling naturally, the resultant black ultra-light-weight CNA was washed with deionized water repeatedly, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The overall shape of the CNA monolith was controlled by the mold used for gelation.
Preparation of a CNA/CoS2 CE
Typically, 1 mmol CoCl2·6H2O and 20 mmol thiourea were dissolved in deionized water (50–80 mL). Subsequently, the pristine CNA bulk was transferred into the above solution. The final CoS2 content in the composites was under the control of the amount of deionized water. Next, the mixture was sealed in 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the obtained black products were washed repeatedly with distilled water and vacuum dried at 60 °C. The hydrothermal synthesis process allowed CoS2 nanoparticles to be immobilized homogeneously onto the CNA owing to the strong interaction induced by the large specific surface energy. The filling content of CoS2 in the composite was calculated by thermal gravimetric analysis. Finally, a thin slice of CNA/CoS2 with ∼0.6 cm on each side and ∼0.2 cm thick was transferred on precleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd, Japan). The conventional Pt/FTO CE via the thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 (30 mM in isopropanol) was also fabricated as a control experiment.
Fabrication of dye adsorbed photoanodes
FTO glass with a dimension of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm was sequentially cleaned with soapy water, deionized water, ethanol and acetone by sonication for 20 min. TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on cleaned FTO glass by the traditional doctor-blade technique. Typically, solution A (350 mL isopropyl titanate in 2.5 mL anhydrous ethanol) was slowly added into solution B (35 mL, 2 M HCl in 2.5 mL anhydrous ethanol) to obtain TiO2 precursor solution, which was then cast onto FTO glass by spin coating at a rotating speed of 2000 rpm for 60 s. After annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air, a 40 nm thick TiO2 compact layer can be obtained. The commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NR-T) was diluted with ethanol in a weight ratio of 2:7. Thereafter, the diluted TiO2 paste was covered onto the as-prepared TiO2 compact layer by the traditional doctor-blade method and then subjected to the calcination process at 125 °C for 5 min, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 5 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min in air sequentially. The final TiO2 photoanodes were further immersed in 0.02 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then heated to 500 °C for 30 min in air. After the temperature was cooled down to about 100 °C, they were immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of the N719 dye ([cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid)-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate]) (Solaronix Co., Ltd, Switzerland) overnight. Finally, the as-prepared dye sensitized photoanodes were scratched into 0.16 cm2 and then rinsed with ethanol to remove physically-adsorbed dye molecules.
Construction of DSSC devices
The electrolyte containing 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 8 mL acetonitrile was injected into the spacer between the dye sensitized TiO2 photoanode and CEs through the capillary effect. The symmetrical dummy cell for electrochemical measurement was fabricated by using two identical CEs and filled with the electrolyte, similar to that used in the assembled DSSCs.
Characterization
The aerogel morphology and CNT microstructure were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, NORAN System 7, Thermo Fisher). Further structural analyses were carried out by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010, JEOL). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by using a diffractometer (XRD-7000, SHIMADZU) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The porosity of the aerogel was quantitatively characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments, which was carried out on a Quadrasorb EVO Model QDS-30. The thermal gravimetric curves were determined with a NETZSCH STA449C. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in a three electrode test system, which includes Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode dipped in an acetonitrile solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660c, CHI Instruments). Tafel polarization curves of the dummy cells were determined by the same electrochemical workstation with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2401 source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) solar light coming from a AAA solar simulator (Sun 3000 Solar Simulators, ABET Technologies, USA), which was calibrated using a certified reference Si solar cell (9115DV, Oriel) before each measurement. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm using a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (Oriel QE-PV-SI, Newport). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on symmetric cells at an open circuit voltage bias with an AC modulation amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range from 0.1 MHz to 100 mHz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the morphology and structure of CNTs, CNA and CNA–CoS2. SEM characterization shows the masses of curled CNTs with no apparent difference in their morphology and size, Fig. 1A. TEM shown in Fig. 1B reveals an individual CNT with an outer diameter of about 12 nm and an inner diameter of ∼6 nm. Fig. 1C shows a digital photograph for a part of the as-prepared CNA with a bulk density of about 40 mg cm−3 and a large porosity of >99%. The adsorption/desorption hysteresis loop represents a typical characteristic of three-dimensional porous materials, Fig. S1A.† By fitting the isotherms to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model, the surface area of the CNA was estimated to be 482 m2 g−1. The light-weight characteristic enables the CNA to stand on the feelers of Setaria viridis.20 The pore size distribution calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, depicted a narrow peak centered at ∼5.5 nm, Fig. S1B.† From the low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1D), a small fragment of the CNA exhibits relatively even and smooth surfaces. However, the detailed observations at high magnification indicate that there is a rough surface with an irregular, hierarchical nanoporous structure on the CNA surface, Fig. 1E. The inner structure of the CNA exhibits a self-assembled, interconnected, porous three-dimensional framework with a continuous pore diameter ranging from several to tens of nanometers. At the selected zones marked by an ellipse (Fig. 1F), CNTs in the inner part of the CNA are tightly adhered to each other due to the decomposition of organic solutes at high temperature. Meanwhile, the abundant nanoscale voids not only serve as a highly conductive scaffold but also provide an extremely high surface area for electrochemical catalysis. This case is quite different from the pristine CNT samples (Fig. 1A), which is mainly attributed to the dehydration after freeze-drying treatment and the carbonization of residual organic species under high-temperature heat treatment. The low-resolution SEM image of the as-prepared CNA–CoS2 hybrid clearly demonstrates that CoS2 nanoparticles are homogeneously decorated on the surface of the CNA, Fig. 1G. In the high magnification SEM image of CNA–CoS2 (Fig. 1H), the uniform CoS2 nanoparticles without aggregation are highly distributed inside and outside the CNA by a facile hydrothermal route. The high-resolution TEM (inset of Fig. 1H) shows clear and uniform lattice fringes with a fixed crystallographic orientation with a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm, ascribing to the (2 0 0) planar spacing of the cubic phase CoS2. By using a two-probe measurement, the electrical resistivity of the CNA is about 1.3 × 10−2 Ωm, which is smaller than that of the one before carbonization (5.3 × 10−2 Ωm). This could be caused by the abundance of the existing C–C bonding between the carbonized CNTs. In addition, compared with the CNA, CNA–CoS2 has a larger electrical resistivity (4.1 × 10−2 Ωm) due to the relatively high resistance of CoS2.

The typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is presented in Fig. 2. For comparison, the XRD patterns of the CNTs and CNA are given in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. There is no considerable difference in the peak positions of the CNTs and CNA products (see the vertical dashed lines), which implies that the CNT structure is nearly unchanged even after the freeze drying and high temperature heat treatment. Fig. 2c shows the XRD pattern of the CNA–CoS2 hybrid. Except for the peaks of the CNA, other diffraction peak signals match well with cubic CoS2 (JCPDS no. 89-1492), in which the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.5°, 32.4°, 36.1°, 39.9°, 46.5°, 55.0°, 60.2° and 62.8° can be readily indexed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (023) and (321) planes, respectively. No XRD patterns of other phases such as Co1−xS or cobalt oxides are observed. These results further confirm that CoS2 nanoparticles are successfully deposited onto CNA bulk materials. EDS analysis (Fig. S2†) reveals that the atomic ratio of Co to S is calculated to be 1:1.98, which coincides with the results revealed by XRD and TEM.

To identify the electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− for the as-prepared CEs, CV experiments have been carried out on the CNA CE (Fig. 3A(b)) and CNA–CoS2 CE (Fig. 3A(c)) in an iodide-based electrolyte. The CV of the conventional Pt CE is also measured as a reference under the same conditions, Fig. 3A(a). The relatively negative pair corresponds to the redox reaction of I3−/I−. The electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− can be visualized by the current density of the reduction peak (Jred) and the oxidation peak (Jox) as well as peak to peak splitting (Epp).44 Compared with the Pt film electrode, the dramatically increased catalytic surface area of the CNA CE provides efficient transfer channels for electrons and electrolytes, giving rise to apparently increased current densities. With regard to the CNA–CoS2 CE, the high density and homogeneous distribution of CoS2 nanoparticles onto the CNA ensure plenty of catalytically active sites and the sufficient connection between CoS2 and the CNA conductive network. The CNA–CoS2 CE provides multiple advantages in driving ion diffusions and collecting electrons from the external circuit as well as accelerating electron transfer to catalytic CoS2 sites, thereby achieving high efficiency electrocatalysts for the reduction of I3−.36 Compared with the CNA CE, the high electrocatalytic capability of the CNA–CoS2 CE is also reflected in a smaller Epp, suggesting a lower overpotential for I3− reduction43 and hence better redox reaction reversibility.45 In addition, a multi-cycle successive CV test (20 cycles) was conducted to evaluate the electrochemical stability of the CNA–CoS2 electrode in the I3−/I− electrolyte. No significant change in the CV curves between the first and the 20th CV curves was observed (Fig. 3B), illustrating the excellent long-term electrochemical stability of the CNA–CoS2 CE in the I3−/I− electrolyte system.

The J–V curves of the DSSCs using CEs based on the Pt, CNA and CNA–CoS2 have been collected in Fig. 4. It should be noted that the thickness of the applied TiO2 photoanode is nearly the same (∼20 μm), as shown in Fig. S3.†Table 1 lists the main photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), the maximum value (ηmax) and the average value (ηavg.) of PCE. They obey the following relationships: , where Pin is the power of incident light (100 mW cm−2). The champion DSSC assembled with the optimized CNA–CoS2 CE exhibits a Jsc of 16.51 mA cm−2, a Voc of 763 mV and a FF of 0.71, yielding a ηmax of 8.92%, much higher than those of the cells fabricated with the individual CNA (8.28%) and Pt CE (7.32%). Compared with the Pt CE, such an enhancement in the PCE for the CNA–CoS2 one can be mainly attributed to the higher Jsc, in accordance with the IPCE results (Fig. S4†). The high electrocatalytic capability of CNA–CoS2 affords more I− through the reduction of I3− to I−, which in turn boosts the regeneration of dyes and hence the light capturing and photoelectron injecting, thus resulting in the highest Jsc among the three samples. More significantly, the photovoltaic parameters of the CNA–CoS2 based device are very close to those of our published work on the DSSC based on the CNA-Pt CE (Jsc = 16.57 mA cm−2, Voc = 779 mV, FF = 0.70, ηmax = 9.04%).22 It should be noted that the photoanode, dye and electrolytes are the same in both cases, thus ensuring perfectly comparable DSSCs in the literature to the DSSCs in this study. Hence, the resultant CNA–CoS2 CE can be considered as a promising Pt-free CE for I3−/I− based DSSCs.

It is well-known that the interfacial charge transfer processes at the CE/electrolyte interface can also be used to evaluate the electrocatalytic behavior of the CEs. Hence, the EIS measurement is performed using a symmetric cell, which is composed of two identical electrodes. Fig. 5A shows the resultant Nyquist plots of the dummy cells and the equivalent circuit is illustrated in the figure as an inset. The semicircle in the high frequency represents the electron transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, while the semicircle at the low frequency corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) of the I−/I3− redox species. The intercept of the real axis at the high frequency is the ohmic series resistance (Rs), consisting of the external wire resistance, the contact resistance, conductivity of CEs and FTO glass.46 The values of Rs and Rct are evaluated by fitting the impedance spectra with the equivalent circuit, and are listed in Table 2. The Rs value of CNA–CoS2 is a little larger than that of CNA, in good agreement with the resistivity measurements. However, the Rct value of CNA–CoS2 is smaller than that of the CNA, which reflects that the addition of CoS2 speeds up the electron transfer processes that occur at the interface of the CE and electrolyte, resulting in the increased reduction rates of I3−/I− redox couples and FF as a result, in good agreement with the CV and J–V analysis results. The diffusion coefficient of I3− is inversely proportional to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW), which can be achieved considering the diameter of the low-frequency semicircle. Compared with the CNA CE, the CNA–CoS2 one shows a smaller ZW value, which also contributes to the high electrocatalytic activity. It is also noted that the CNA–CoS2 has a larger CPE than the CNA, which indicates that the added CoS2 increases the catalytic surface area, thereby improving the catalytic activity. The time constant (τ, also named electron lifetime) can be expressed as τ = Rct×CPE/S,47 where S is the area of CEs (0.36 cm2). Hence, the τ of CNA–CoS2 is 1.9 × 10−2 s, larger than that of the CNA (1.4 × 10−3 s). To provide further evidence on the electrocatalytic capabilities of the CEs, Fig. 5B shows the Tafel polarization profiles of the dummy cells fabricated with two identical CNA and CNA–CoS2 CEs. The exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) are closely related to the catalytic activities of the CEs.22Jlim can be obtained from the current density at low slopes and high potential regions. Apparently, Fig. 5B(b) shows a higher Jlim than that in Fig. 5B(a), demonstrating that the CNA–CoS2 CE has a higher diffusion rate (D) for the I3− in the electrolyte than the CNA CE according to eqn (1).13 (1)where n (n = 2) is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the electrode, l is the spacer thickness, F is the Faraday constant and C is the I3− concentration in the redox electrolyte. The calculated D value for CNA–CoS2 and the CNA is 9.3 × 10−6 and 4.7 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively. It is known that J0 can directly denote the electrocatalytic performance and J0 increases with the decreasing Rct. The anodic or cathodic branches in Fig. 5B(b) exhibit an obvious larger slope than that in Fig. 5B(a), indicating that the CNA–CoS2 CE possesses a higher J0 than the CNA CE. Overall, the CNA–CoS2 CE exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity on the I3−/I− redox reaction, which is in accordance with the CV and EIS results.

It is inevitable that the evident increase in the CoS2 filler content consequently leads to their aggregation. As a result, a portion of CoS2 nanoparticles cannot contact with the CNA, thereby blocking the electron transfer to the catalytic surface sites of CoS2. Meanwhile, the aggregation of CoS2 also results in an obviously smaller interspace, leading to the reduced pore size and pore volume (Fig. 6A), which is not favorable for the electrolyte diffusion channel. Nevertheless, the low density of CoS2 nanoparticles is also not favorable because of the reduced number of catalytically active sites for I3− reduction. Hence, the content of CoS2 should be well controlled to achieve an efficient electrolyte diffusion channel and high catalytic activity. As expected, the PCE of the DSSCs with CNA–CoS2 CEs initially increases with the increasing mass percentages of CoS2 and then reaches a maximum efficiency of 8.92% when the mass percentage is 11.8% (Fig. S5†), followed by a continuous decrease of the PCE due to the electrocatalytic activity loss, as displayed in Fig. 6B.

Conclusions
A novel CNA–CoS2 hybrid as an attractive Pt-free CE material for high-efficiency DSSCs was investigated. The CNA endowed with high electrical conductivity, high porosity, and a large surface area allows the fast diffusion of an electrolyte into the pores and rapid collection of electrons from the external circuit, thereby resulting in a higher PCE (8.28%) than the conventional Pt-based device (7.32%). Furthermore, the CNA serves as an ideal electrocatalytic support material in the as-synthesized CNA–CoS2 CE via a facile hydrothermal route. Extensive electrochemical analyses demonstrate that the CNA–CoS2 CE achieves better catalytic ability, and faster ion diffusion and electron transport than the CNA CE. This is because the conductive CNA network ensures sufficient contact with the surface of highly dispersed CoS2, which provides more active catalytic sites. Owing to the encouraging electrocatalytic activity on the I3−/I− redox reaction and the exceptional electron-transport pathway, our fabricated DSSC based on the optimized CNA–CoS2 CE produces an impressive PCE of 8.92%, close to that of the reported CNA-Pt CE based cell in our published work (9.04%). The CNA–CoS2 also shows an excellent long-term electrochemical stability in the I3−/I− electrolyte system as the CEs of DSSCs. Overall, this work may provide a feasible way in pursuit of the low-cost and facile synthesis of CE materials for the practical applications of DSSCs.
