Using our in situ slot-die micro roll-to-roll coater setup, we measured small and wide angle X-ray scattering in grazing incidence while the material dried, enabling us to follow the crystallization from just after the deposition and up to 25 minutes later. The data showed differing crystallographic developments between the substrates, especially seen through the behaviour of a crystalline precursor which survived longer on the flexible substrates than on glass. Additionally, the common degradation product PbI2 was absent on the thickest flexible substrate. This leads us to conjecture that the flexible substrates absorb part of the solvent, thereby delaying evaporation and changing the solvent environment around the perovskite. As a further test, we produced solar cells with the same substrates and confirmed that the ones made on flexible substrates performed worse than those made on glass, but that when including an ITO layer in the stack it seemed to act as a buffer, whereby the solar cell performance was improved.
Easily scalable technologies for photovoltaics, a key renewable energy source, are urgently needed to mitigate one of the main challenges of our age, global warming. Materials that fulfil this need must be easily processable and earth abundant, while still offering high enough power conversion efficiency (PCE) to be viable for commercial marketing. Lead halide perovskites were discovered to have many of these properties in 2009, when Miyasaka et al.1 succeeded in making the first thin film solar cells out of this material. Because of consecutive studies showing soaring efficiencies already nearing 20%,2,3 lead halide perovskites are now being investigated intensely.
Solar cell efficiency in general relies on a beneficial combination of factors, and lead halide perovskites fulfil several of these. The mobility of the photogenerated electrons must be as high as possible in the material, which should also consist of interpenetrating networks facilitating efficient extraction. This is, among other things, facilitated by a large crystal size, and the methylammonium lead halide perovskite material in particular has been observed to form micrometer sized crystals under temperatures of 120 °C and with an 8 hour reaction time.4 This also means that diffraction techniques are an effective way to directly observe the process of crystallite formation in thin films coated from solution.
Most perovskite solar cell studies use glass5–8 or silicon9,10 substrates, especially for X-ray scattering experiments.11–14 After recently adapting the perovskite material for flexible substrates15 and proving that the lead content is a minor challenge to industrialization,16 a morphological study is the next logical step. In order to achieve roll-to-roll processing, a flexible substrate such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has to be used, but the perovskite seems inhibited from forming large crystallites on these substrates, reducing the solar cell efficiency when compared to cells made on glass substrates. In the literature,15 a 1-step approach was used to prepare the active layer in a normal device geometry, thereby successfully creating perovskite solar cells on substrates consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, P4083) on indium tin oxide covered glass (as a semi-transparent front electrode) (glass–ITO–P4083) and on PET–ITO–P4083. As is also the case for roll-to-roll coated polymer solar cells,17,18 the efficiencies achieved were about half of that achieved on glass in the same study. A comparison of AFM images of the perovskite layer on different substrates showed that the crystal size on PET was smaller and more irregular and confirmed that an overall larger crystal size seemed related to higher efficiencies.
Several groups are working on adapting the lead halide perovskite for large scale production. Beginning in 2013,19 most studies focused on creating efficient solar cells on flexible substrates but without the use of roll coating techniques for creating the film.20,21 In a report by Qiu et al.22 a power conversion efficiency of 13.5% was achieved on a PET substrate, by using electron beam evaporation to create a homogeneous layer of TiO2 with few pinholes. Hwang et al.23 chose a different approach and used a slot-die coating head to create films of perovskite but on glass–ITO–ZnO substrates. These studies revealed how important the processing technique is for the final result but only investigated the morphology with ex situ techniques.
We are convinced that to understand how the structure is affected by the substrate, and how this influences the solar cell efficiency, we need to examine perovskite layer formation in situ in a manner that is as close as possible to what is expected for large scale solar cell production. Such a study was realized for the first time in 2014,24,25 where X-ray scattering is recorded from a roll-to-roll coater mounted on an X-ray source, such that measurements can be carried out during coating, while drying, and after coating the material.15 Recently, a few other research groups have started working on their own implementations of in situ morphology studies both with real roll-to-roll printing machines26 and with a slot die coating head printing on rigid substrates.27
To our knowledge, these experiments have yet to be carried out on perovskite solar cells, and because the previous findings suggest a correspondence between the substrates and perovskite morphology, we measured the X-ray scattering on 3 different substrates. Using the 1-step method, we succeeded in creating slot-die coated perovskite films and measuring both wide and small angle scattering of the films in situ while they dried. The choice of substrates was based on the above-mentioned reference15 where two substrates were used – glass–ITO–P4083 and PET–ITO–P4083, to which we decided to add a third substrate with a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer replacing ITO, i.e. PET–PH1000–P4083. The in situ setup is shown in Fig. 1, and it was enhanced with cameras and remote control of the coating procedure, enabling us to control the coating from outside the beamline hutch of the cSAXS beamline at the Swiss Light Source.
 Fig. 1  A photograph of the setup during the measurements at the Swiss Light Source beamline cSAXS. The beam path is shown in blue, the solution path from the syringe pumps (green) to the coater head (inset) is shown in pink, and the heating plate control unit is shown in red. Several cameras were used to monitor the coating in real time, with one mounted directly onto the coater head. 
In order to enhance the signal from the thin perovskite films, the scattering experiments were performed in grazing incidence (GI) geometry with a shallow incidence angle of αi = 0.2. The two different distances between the sample and the detector were 634 mm for wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and 2209 mm for small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The raw data and the geometries are further illustrated in the graphical abstract. The wide angle scattering is sensitive to the crystalline features of the perovskite, whereas the smaller angles can give information about crystallite growth, shape and size. The recorded scattering patterns show the full formation of the perovskite crystal structure by measuring from immediately after printing, the moment the coated film was moved onto the heating plate. Therefore, they also show any other phases that the material might go through before forming the final perovskite phase. Fig. 2 shows the azimuthally averaged wide angle scattering data for the three substrates. Clearly, the crystallographic development is different on the glass substrate compared to the PET substrates.
 Fig. 2  Azimuthally averaged intensity plots of wide angle measurements for the three substrates, glass–ITO–P4083, PET–ITO–P4083 and PET–PH1000–P4083, from left to right. The precursor peak is marked with a ♦, the degradation peak from PbI2 is marked with a ‡ and the perovskite structure is marked with an X. The final plot is the pattern observed after moving the sample slightly. PET–ITO–P4083 substrate: even fresh material shows a weakening perovskite signal and the PbI2 degradation product. PET–PH1000–P4083 substrate: the precursor peaks at 0.79 and 0.85 Å−1 are clearly seen even in the two final scans. The degradation peak does not appear even in the final scans. The PET signal was partly subtracted, but it was not possible to completely remove the PET background so that part of the curves is masked out between 1.2 and 1.9 Å−1 for clarity. The schematics of the three substrates are shown next to the corresponding scattering data. The dashed curve is the reference structure for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at 400 K from ref. 28. 
The wide angle scattering measurements from the glass experiment show a clear crystalline signal appearing before the perovskite (hereafter called the “precursor”), thereafter some intermediate states (possibly beam damage) and finally a PbI2 degradation signal together with the perovskite signal. The differences between the crystallographic reactions on the two flexible substrates are striking. On the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample, the precursor is still present in the final scan after about 1500 s, whereas the PET–ITO–P4083 sample shows a development that is more similar to the glass substrate. Here, the precursor has disappeared at the end of the measurements, and a degradation of the perovskite signal is observed. The diffraction was nearly isotropic for all substrates, implying randomly oriented crystallites. The small angle scattering was more challenging to analyze but still showed a densification of the film upon drying.
The observations from the glass experiment were comparable to previous in situ measurements on glass substrates,5 with the precursor forming first which is slowly transformed. Beam damage significantly inhibited the wet material from forming the perovskite structure, but most of the impact of beam damage was avoided by moving the samples a few millimeters several times for each experiment, thereby minimizing the influence of beam damage on the observed signal with only a minor sacrifice to time resolution. After moving to fresh material, we observe the tetragonal perovskite phase P4mm, which was identified based on the careful measurements reported by Stoumpos et al.28 Using TOF-SIMS (time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry), we studied the area where the material had been damaged and found that large amounts of the material are sublimated and removed from the surface (see TOF-SIMS images in the ESI†). The scattering curves shown for the PET experiments in Fig. 2 are therefore only the ones from immediately after moving the sample, since the latter scans necessarily represent a combined effect of annealing as well as sublimation induced by the X-ray beam. We found that the final crystalline perovskite on the glass substrate was quite resistant to radiation damage compared to the precursor phases, as it showed no visible degradation even after 10 minutes. This suggests that beam damage directly inhibits the perovskite from forming. Both the glass and the PET–ITO–P4083 samples also show a peak that was identified as the degradation phase PbI2, which is absent on the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample.
The largest differences between the glass sample and the two flexible samples are in the relative peak intensities between the 1 Å−1 perovskite peak and the peak at about 0.86 Å−1 attributed to the precursor. On the glass substrate, the peaks have comparable intensities at the first 10 min of the measurement. On the PET samples, the perovskite peak is much stronger than the precursor in the case of PET–ITO–P4083, and for the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample, the precursor cannot be seen until after 40 seconds of drying. This shows that the different substrates result in differing formation mechanisms. In addition, the precursor peaks persist until the final measurements on PET–PH1000–P4083 in contrast to the measurement on glass. As an explanation for these observations, we propose that the thick layer of PEDOT:PSS on one of the flexible substrates absorbs part of the solvent (DMF) and acts as a reservoir for the solvent in the ink, and with it, the methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbCl2, as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 2. This would lead to the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample developing slower from the precursor to the perovskite inhibited by a delayed release of MAI from the substrate, while this retention of MAI would also slow the degradation from the perovskite into PbI2, in a self-healing mechanism similar to what was observed by Zhou et al.29 Additionally, this retention effectively lengthens the drying time, which has been found to be unfavorable for a large final crystallite size.30 We tested whether the degradation was caused by radiation damage on the PET substrates by moving them three times. The measurements show that the amount of perovskite is diminishing, even in the material that has not been exposed to X-rays. We therefore conclude that the perovskite layer degrades more rapidly on PET substrates and fastest on PET–ITO–P4083. The crystallite lower size limit was investigated by fitting Gaussian functions to the peaks and using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values in the Scherrer equation: L [Å−1] = K × 2 × pi/FWHM [Å−1]. We found that the crystallite sizes are comparable between the glass–ITO–P4083 and PET–ITO–P4083 samples at 25 nm, but the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample showed a double peak at the 100 peak position, presumably because of the inhomogeneity of the coating which made it unreasonable to compare it with the other two samples.
In order to relate the observed phenomena to the actual solar cell performance, we made a series of devices based on the three substrate types. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1,† the performance was best for glass–ITO and worst for PET–PH1000. The poor performance of PET–PH1000 is predominantly caused by a relatively low photo-current. This correlates well with the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. S5.† The surface morphology of the perovskite layer formed on PET–PH1000 hints to the low device performance, as the typical perovskite crystallites/grains are not seen in the AFM images shown in Fig. S8.† Combining these observations with the wide angle scattering results, the presence of the precursor very late in the drying process together with no formation of PbI2 lead us to conclude that the weak performance of the solar cells made on PH1000 is caused by a much slower drying process caused by the movement of the solvent, MAI and PbCl2 into the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer.
The knowledge that we obtained from the wide angle scattering confirmed that the correct reaction leading to the tetragonal perovskite phase P4mm happened on the samples, despite performing the experiments in air and subjecting the drying films to the X-ray beam. The next step was to investigate the structural development on the mesoscopic length scales with scattering at small angles. Even with the added complexity of in situ measurements, we were able to record data on the glass substrate that show development as the film dries. Fig. 3 shows one of the data sets that were recorded – a long measurement where the sample was stationary. The second set is shown in Fig. S9† and was recorded while moving the sample twice to determine the effect of radiation damage.
 Fig. 3  Vertical line cut through the beam center showing the small angle scattering signal from the perovskite drying on glass–ITO–P4083. The Yoneda peak31 of the perovskite is seen around q = 0.02 Å−1 (A) and moves to higher q as the material dries. (B) This can be tentatively attributed to the Yoneda line of the PEDOT (P4083) surface. 
In the first set of data, we see two main features. One peak ((A) in Fig. 3) is moving to higher angles over time. We interpret this as the Yoneda peak31 moving to higher angles as the perovskite densify and the critical angle increases. We tentatively ascribe the second clear peak ((B) in Fig. 3) to the Yoneda line of the PET substrate, but a detailed modeling of the layers was beyond the scope of this report. In the second set of data, we observe that after moving the sample, the scattering pattern returns to the shape it had in the beginning of the measurement. This suggests that the density increase observed in the first data set is at least partly caused by beam damage rather than being caused by the developing perovskite layer. The complicated structure seen at the smallest angles shows that there is more information to be had, but this is beyond the scope of this study and requires a much better understanding of the system as a whole, as the many layers all contribute to the exact signal that is observed.
Conclusions
We observed the drying of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite on three different substrates, glass–ITO–P4083, PET–ITO–P4083 and PET–PH1000–P4083. The measurements show a perovskite structure on the glass substrate that is comparable to previous observations, despite processing in air. The same or a similar precursor phase as observed in other studies developed on the glass–ITO–P4083 sample before the perovskite phase. This precursor was also observed on the two flexible substrates, but the development changed depending on the substrate. On the PET–PH1000–P4083 substrate, the precursor was observed to persist longer than on the PET–ITO–P4083 and glass–ITO–P4083 substrates. Additionally, whereas the PET–ITO–P4083 sample showed a clear signal from the degradation material PbI2, there was no sign of this on the PET–PH1000–P4083 sample within the 20 minute time frame of the experiment.
We also saw that the perovskite phase appears faster and in a larger amount relative to the precursor on both flexible substrates. This might also be explained by absorption of solvent by the substrate, as this would result in a higher effective concentration of the drying perovskite solution. This gives a complete picture where the solvent is absorbed into both the PET and the PEDOT:PSS layers, delaying the disappearance of the precursor longest on the substrate with both (i.e. the PET–PH1000 substrate) but at the same time leading to near instantaneous formation of small quantities of perovskite. In contrast, the glass substrate has little or no absorption of solvent, which leads to a delayed formation of perovskite compared to the flexible substrates. Fast absorption of solvent by the substrate would result in a short crystallization time in some areas, which could explain the observed areas of smaller perovskite crystallites seen by Schmidt et al. in ref. 15 when comparing glass and PET as substrates for perovskite solar cells. These observations together with the supporting AFM and UV-vis studies lead us to conclude that the main reason for the lower performance of the PH1000 solar cells is caused by a small crystallite size and an overall lower amount of crystalline perovskite. Although the PET might also absorb part of the solvent, as our observations show, this has a much smaller effect in the case where there is a layer of ITO acting as a barrier. This might therefore be a general method to improve the performance of solar cells made on absorbent substrates.
We observed developments in the small angle scattering signal supporting expected changes in the material such as the density development. Finally, we propose that the observed differences stem from the movement of the solvent into the substrates which creates differences in the available solvent/MAI amount during perovskite nucleation and crystallization. As this implies a direct impact on any kind of solvent drying on flexible substrates, more studies are required before our observations can be explained in detail. Therefore, our results illustrate the importance of more dedicated research into the basic behavior of drying on absorbent substrates, such as the effect of e.g. thickness and temperature on absorption in the substrates.
Experimental
Materials
The three substrates (glass–ITO, PET–ITO and PET–PH1000) were coated with a layer of PEDOT:PSS (P4083 from Heraeus) by diluting as received P4083 with isopropanol in a ratio of 1:3 (v/v) (isopropanol:P4083) as this gave smoother films. The isopropanol:P4083 solution was spin-coated onto the sample at 2000 rpm for approx. 15 s and then heated on a hotplate at 150 °C for 5 min. The perovskite precursor solution was made by dissolving 110 mg of PbCl2 and 190 mg of MAI in 1 ml of DMF. The solution was kept in a heated ultrasound bath until shortly before performing the measurement, where it was moved to a syringe. More details about solutions and the coating process can be found in ref. 15.
X-ray experiment
As the glass–ITO samples were not available in an endless format (long foil), we cut the flexible substrates into similarly sized pieces and mounted those on bare glass substrates. In this way, the sample size and the methodology for all three substrates were identical. We mounted the glass slides with the respective substrate type onto the foil of the coating machine and used this to translate the samples. To achieve an even coating thickness, all measurements were performed with a syringe pump rate of 0.25 μl s−1 and a speed of 0.25 m min−1 and using the same slot die coating head. The height of the head above the substrate was chosen individually for each experiment to achieve a uniform coat, using a small camera mounted onto the coating head. The coating was otherwise performed as described in ref. 32. The X-ray measurements were performed at the cSAXS beamline at the Swiss Light Source, with an X-ray energy of 13.6 keV and a beam size (height × width) of 100 μm × 50 μm at the sample. A Pilatus 2M detector was used for all measurements, run in burst mode with a 10 Hz acquisition rate. The mini-roll-to-roll coating setup described in ref. 24 was used for all the experiments.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  A photograph of the setup during the measurements at the Swiss Light Source beamline cSAXS. The beam path is shown in blue, the solution path from the syringe pumps (green) to the coater head (inset) is shown in pink, and the heating plate control unit is shown in red. Several cameras were used to monitor the coating in real time, with one mounted directly onto the coater head.	 

 	Fig. 2  Azimuthally averaged intensity plots of wide angle measurements for the three substrates, glass–ITO–P4083, PET–ITO–P4083 and PET–PH1000–P4083, from left to right. The precursor peak is marked with a ♦, the degradation peak from PbI2 is marked with a ‡ and the perovskite structure is marked with an X. The final plot is the pattern observed after moving the sample slightly. PET–ITO–P4083 substrate: even fresh material shows a weakening perovskite signal and the PbI2 degradation product. PET–PH1000–P4083 substrate: the precursor peaks at 0.79 and 0.85 Å−1 are clearly seen even in the two final scans. The degradation peak does not appear even in the final scans. The PET signal was partly subtracted, but it was not possible to completely remove the PET background so that part of the curves is masked out between 1.2 and 1.9 Å−1 for clarity. The schematics of the three substrates are shown next to the corresponding scattering data. The dashed curve is the reference structure for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at 400 K from ref. 28.	 

 	Fig. 3  Vertical line cut through the beam center showing the small angle scattering signal from the perovskite drying on glass–ITO–P4083. The Yoneda peak31 of the perovskite is seen around q = 0.02 Å−1 (A) and moves to higher q as the material dries. (B) This can be tentatively attributed to the Yoneda line of the PEDOT (P4083) surface.
