Owing to their straightforward fabrication techniques, low manufacturing costs, and scopes of introducing various light-harvesting materials, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 have emerged as attractive solar energy conversion devices. Despite these advantages, most DSSCs developed thus far are comprised of a single chromophore unit—typically Ru(II) complexes, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, or perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives—that can absorb light only at particular wavelengths, leaving the rest of the visible light (400–700 nm) essentially unused for energy conversion.2 To improve the efficiency of DSSCs and generate photocurrents throughout the Vis–NIR range, various electron donor–acceptor dyads,3 panchromatic dyes,4 as well as conjugated polymers5 with broad absorption cross-sections have been developed. However, the synthesis of extended chromophores and covalently linked electron donor–acceptor systems are often challenging and therefore these materials are far from ideal for practical applications. To circumvent this problem, bulk-heterojunction solar cells6 have been developed in which composites of electron donors, acceptors, and chromophores are employed as light-harvesting materials. However, irregular morphologies and random orientations of electron donors, acceptors, and chromophores in these devices are not conducive for the all-important vectorial electron transfer process needed for optimal charge-separation and efficient photocurrent generation.6,7
Directional and hierarchical noncovalent interactions, such as metal coordination and hydrogen-bonding interactions present a unique opportunity to organize multiple chromophores and electron donors and acceptors in an orderly fashion such that they can undergo vectorial photoinduced electron transfer (PET)8 to produce long-lived charge-separated states. Although basic photophysical properties and PET phenomena of a handful of supramolecular donor–acceptor dyads and triads have been investigated in solutions,9 photovoltaic devices based on supramolecular light-harvesting complexes are extremely rare.10 Recently, D'Souza et al.10 fabricated DSSCs using supramolecular electron donor–acceptor dyads, while we11 have constructed a multichromophoric supramolecular solar cell using a self-assembled Zn-porphyrin⋯N-pyridyl-peryleneimide (ZnP⋯PyPMI) dyad as the light-harvesting material. The power conversion efficiencies of these devices, however, are rather low compared to other DSSCs.12
Herein, we demonstrate that by incorporating a stronger electron-donating chromophore, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc), into a supramolecular ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad (Fig. 1), the PCE of the DSSCs can be scaled up to 2.3%, which is much greater than the efficiencies of the devices composed of individual ZnPc and PyPMI dyes. The IPCE spectrum shows that the ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad-based DSSC converts light to electricity throughout the 300–650 nm region and the maximum current (IPCE = ca. 40%) is produced where ZnPc and PyPMI dyes exhibit strong absorption.
 Fig. 1  (a) DSSCs comprised of (b) a supramolecular ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad, (c) PyPMI, and (d) ZnPc dyes. 
First, we verified the formation of a 1:1 ZnPc⋯PyPMI complex through axial coordination of ZnPc with the PyPMI ligand via its pyridyl group (Fig. S1, ESI†). In order to avoid a potential competition between the pyridyl-group and the anhydride terminal of PyPMI, the PyPDICy ligand carrying a pyridyl ring on one imide ring and a cyclohexyl group on the other was used for solution NMR studies. In the solid-state devices, PyPMI anchors onto TiO2 particles through its anhydride end, leaving only the pyridyl-group available for coordinating with a ZnPc molecule. The 1H NMR titration revealed the formation of a 1:1 ZnPc⋯PyPDICy complex (Ka = 5.8 × 104 M−1, CD2Cl2, 298 K) in which the Ha, Hb, and Hc signals of the PyPDICy ligand shifted significantly upfield due the shielding effect of ZnPc (Fig. S1, ESI†).9,13 ESIMS further confirmed (Fig. S2, ESI†) the formation of the ZnPc⋯PyPDICy dyad (m/z = 1946.6).
The UV/Vis spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the self-assembled ZnPc⋯PyPDICy dyad in CH2Cl2 (350, 440, 545, 585, 610 and 680 nm) is essentially a linear combination of the ZnPc and PyPDICy spectra, indicating that the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the individual dyes remain virtually unchanged in the dyad.
Electrochemical measurements (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†) reveal that in the ZnPc⋯PyPDICy dyad, ZnPc becomes a slightly better electron donor, as its E1Ox decreases from +485 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl in CH2Cl2) to +445 mV in the dyad, whereas the reduction of the PyPDICy ligand in the complex (E1Red = −790 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in CH2Cl2) shifts to more negative potential than for the free ligand (−780 mV). These results indicate that the coordination of ZnPc with PyPDICy enhances the electron density of the former, making it a stronger electron donor.
To construct DSSCs, TiO2-coated (5 μm thick layer of 20 nm particles, Solaronix) FTO substrates were first immersed in a PyPMI solution (0.15 mM in CH2Cl2), which allowed the dye to anchor onto the surface through its anhydride end.11,14 After washing away the unbound dyes, the PyPMI-functionalized surface was immersed in a ZnPc solution (2 mM in CH2Cl2) to form ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyads on the surface (Fig. 1). To make a control device comprised of only the ZnPc dye, the TiO2/FTO surface was first functionalized with pyridine-4-carboxylic acid, which was then immersed in a ZnPc solution to capture the dye on the surface. The platinized ITO surface was used as the counter electrode and the I−/I3− couple (1.0 M LiI + 0.06 M I2) in propylene carbonate as a redox mediator to complete the DSSCs.
The surface UV/Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) confirmed anchoring of the dyes onto TiO2/FTO surfaces and revealed that the surface coverage (ΓDye = A(λ)/103ε(λ), A = absorbance, ε = molar absorptivity at wavelength λ)15 of PyPMI and ZnPc dyes in the dyad-coated surface is 2.96 × 10−8 and 1.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively. The uptake of each dye in the dyad-coated surface is essentially the same as that of individual dyes. The greater loading of PyPMI than ZnPc is consistent with the fact that the former is attached to the TiO2 surface perpendicularly, covering less area per molecule than the latter, which covers more area per molecule by aligning parallel to the surface (Fig. 1). In a typical dyad-coated surface, the PyPMI/ZnPc ratio is 2.5, meaning that only one out of every 2.5 TiO2-bound PyPMI molecules coordinates with a ZnPc molecule to form a ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad.

(b) I–V characteristics of DSSCs composed of the ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad (red), PyPMI (pink), and ZnPc (blue) under global 1.5 AM illumination conditions (dotted lines) and in the dark (solid lines). 
The photocurrents produced by the DSSCs was quantified from current/voltage (I/V) measurements (Fig. 2b), which revealed open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill-factor (FF), and PCE (Table 1). In the absence of light, all three DSSCs made of ZnPc, PyPMI, and ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyads show similar I–V curves with JSC = 0 mA cm−2. However, upon irradiating these devices with a standard AM1.5 light (100 mW cm−2), the dyad-based device displays much higher JSC (10 mA cm−2) and VOC (460 mV) than those comprised of ZnPc and PyPMI dyes (Fig. 2b and Table 1). Given that the population of ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyads on the TiO2/FTO surface (per cm2) is the same as that of ZnPc in the control device and ca. 2.5 times less than that of PyPMI, the ratio of JSC generated by the same number of ZnPc, PyPMI, and dyads is 1.0:2.4:18.2. This comparison clearly shows that the ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad converts light to electricity much more efficiently than individual dyes. Furthermore, the JSC and PCE of the ZnPc⋯PyPMI-based DSSC are nearly doubled those of a Zn-porphyrin⋯PyPMI-based DSSC (JSC = 5.5 mA cm−2, PCE = 1.1%)11 developed in our laboratory previously. Such a remarkable improvement in efficiency of the ZnPc⋯PyPMI-based device can be attributed to a better electron-donating ability of ZnPc than the Zn-porphyrin, which can, in turn, lead to faster electron transfer and better charge-separation in the device.

The higher efficiency of DSSCs comprised of the ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad than individual dyes can be attributed to two factors: (i) upon photosensitization the dyad can undergo a two-step vectorial electron transfer to produce long-lived charge-separated states in which electrons (in TiO2) and holes (in ZnPc) are farther separated (Fig. 3a), whereas the charge recombination could be much faster in the devices made of individual dyes due to the closer proximity of electrons and holes in the charge-separated states and (ii) both ZnPc and PyPMI in the dyad can be sensitized at discrete wavelengths to produce photocurrents throughout the visible range, whereas the single component devices can produce photocurrents at much narrower regions.

To verify that the sensitization of ZnPc and PyPMI dyes is indeed responsible for photocurrent generation and to quantify the internal light-harvesting efficiency of these materials, we measured the IPCE of the devices (Fig. 3b). The photocurrents generated in the 300–400 nm region are caused by the excitation of ZnPc (Soret band) as well as TiO2 particles, whereas the excitation of PyPMI triggers the current production in the 450–625 nm region (Fig. 3b). The IPCE of the dyad-based DSSC (Fig. 3b) reaches ca. 40% at 350 nm, i.e., the Soret-band of ZnPc and at 500–550 nm, where PyPMI exhibits the strongest absorption (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the DSSCs made of either ZnPc or PyPMI produce photocurrents only where the respective dyes absorb light and their IPCEs are much lower compared to that of the ZnPc⋯PyPMI device. Although the IPCE spectra (Fig. 3b) of all devices match nicely with the surface absorption spectra of the corresponding dyes (Fig. 2a), the excitation of DSSCs at low energy Q-bands of ZnPc (600–750 nm) does not produce any significant current, indicating that it does not initiate PET.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that DSSCs can be constructed by incorporating self-assembled multichromophoric donor–acceptor dyads as the light-harvesting materials. On account of broad absorption cross-sections and greater charge separation, ZnPc⋯PyPMI dyad-based DSSCs display higher VOC, JSC, PCE and IPCE under standard conditions than those made of individual dyes. To our knowledge, the 2.3% PCE of the supramolecular dyad-based solar cell is the highest among the DSSCs made of self-assembled light-harvesting materials. Furthermore, the self-assembly strategy paves the way for the construction of more efficient supramolecular DSSCs in which multiple electron donors, acceptors, and chromophores can be organized in an orderly fashion to facilitate vectorial PET and maximize the performance of DSSCs.
