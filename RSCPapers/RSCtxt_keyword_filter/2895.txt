    , Accepted 25th March 2015First published on 30th March 2015AbstractA novel sulfated β-cyclodextrin/PVP/MnCO3 composite has been synthesized for a parallel-connected supercapacitor and dye-sensitized solar cell (counter electrode). β-Cyclodextrin has sulfonated, thermally cross-linked with PVP, and incorporated with MnCO3 nanoparticles. The composite electrode exhibited 202.6 F g−1 capacitance, 197.96 W h kg−1 energy density, 5.57% η (DSSC) and 70% performance up to 200 °C with a [BMI][TFSI] electrolyte.
Global research has focussed on the development of sustainable energy storage and application of conversion devices. The development of nanomaterial technology plays a vital role in energy harvesting and storage, because the characteristics of the devices closely depend on the properties of the materials used.1,2 A single-electrode system for both supercapacitors (SC) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) would be beneficial for smart energy storage and compact electronic devices. Polymer composite electrodes have attracted extensive attention as the most suitable choice for fabricating compact and laminated solid-state energy storage systems.
Electrochemical supercapacitors have drawn considerable attention in recent years because they have an ability to provide high power density, fast charging, long cycle life, and low maintenance costs. SCs are passive and static electrical energy storage devices that deliver electrical energy with unusually high power densities compared to secondary batteries (10 kW kg−1), but they use different mechanisms. Supercapacitors store electricity physically and batteries store electricity chemically by separating the positive and negative charges. Newer active materials, such as transition metal oxides or electrically conducting polymers, are required for high-performance capacitance supercapacitors.
In DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays a vital role, since the tri-iodide shuttle species is reduced at the CE (I3 + 2e− → 3I−) by collecting the electrons from the external circuit. Usually, platinum (Pt) is used as a CE, but it limits the extensive application of DSSCs due to its corrosive behaviour and high cost. In order to rectify these problems, low-cost and eco-friendly polymer-based or carbon-based CEs are necessary in order to replace Pt CEs. Newly prepared composite CEs have new avenues such as improved catalytic activity and high conductivity. Another important problem is the stability of electrolytes in a hot environment. An ionic liquid mixed electrolyte is suitable3–6 and we have tested the stability of such electrolytes under high thermal conditions.
Very few reports have investigated the use of DSSC combined SC. Han group has reported the use of nanocrystalline tin oxide film electrodes at room temperature as a photo anode in DSSC and SC. This report has focused on the SC performance with 43.07 F g−1 of the resulting specific capacitance.7 A Ti wire substrate modified with titania nanotubes serves as DSSC and SC electrodes in an integrated “energy fiber” device that has been reported. This report deals with the modifications in the photo anode of the DSSC and the energy fibre obtained 2.73% of DSSC efficiency.8 Shape selective nano TiO2 has been used in SC and DSSCs. The nano TiO2 showed different specific capacitance results.9
An integrated dye sensitized solar cell and a ruthenium oxide based electrochemical capacitor system has been reported and it permits the direct storage of energy generated by sunlight within a single optoelectronic microelectrochemical device. It utilizes three planar electrodes arranged sequentially to include a polymer hole as a conductor (poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)), between a titanium oxide photo anode modified with the dye, (E)-3-(5-(4-(bis(20,40-dibutoxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (D35), and an intermediate silver electrode as well as two hydrous ruthenium oxide layers. This report achieved 0.8% efficiency for DSSC and 400 F g−1 of specific capacitance for SC.10
The double-layer ZnONS/NP film was also used as the semiconducting film in the photo anode of a DSSC and capacitor, and this report mainly focused on the DSSC with 4.65% of efficiency being obtained.11 The Bagheri group have reported a DSSC based on a metal-free organic sensitizer and cobalt (II, III) polypyridyl electrolyte integrated within an asymmetric capacitor utilizing cobalt-doped nickel oxide and activated carbon. The DSSC exhibited 4.6% and 46 F g−1 specific capacitance.12 Chen et al., reported a photoelectric conversion wire for energy storage that exhibited a storage efficiency of 1.5%. A flexible device has been reported to obtain both photoelectric conversion and energy storage using aligned MWCNT films. The integrated device exhibits a good photoelectric conversion. H. Sun group has reported a wire shaped energy wire (CNT) that exhibited 6.58% efficiency and a specific capacitance of 85.03 mF cm−1. A spinnable CNT array energy wire also exhibited 1.83% efficiency.13–17 From these surveys, the DSSC and SC combined fabrications can be classified as integrated energy wires, printable photo-supercapacitors, energy fibres and energy films. There are no reports on parallel connected DSSC combined SC for high thermal operations. Based on the aforementioned works, a high performance electrode is required for both DSSC and SC used in parallel connection. Moreover, high thermal stability counter electrodes for DSSC connected supercapacitors have been very rarely reported.
An eco-friendly polymer β-cyclodextrin was selected for this study. β-Cyclodextrin is a cellulose-based polymer with properties such as functional modification and thermal stability. However, bio-sourced products have potential as future energy resource systems such as wearable devices and these composite polymers exhibit catalytic activity.18 A multi-functional polymer poly-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (PVP) was used in this work; moreover, it is a synthetic, non-toxic, water-soluble polymer, which has been used in various fields such as film formers, protective colloid and suspending agents, dye-receptive agents, binders, stabilizers, detoxicants, and complexing agents. PVP can be cross-linked by heating in air at 150 °C by radiation or potassium persulfate. The important properties of hybrid material formation using PVP have been discussed in our previous report.19 The most common interactions observed in PVP cross-linked polymer composites are hydrogen bonding, ionic, dipole, π-electron, and charge transfer complex interactions.20
The introduction of sulfonic groups increases the ion-exchange capacity. PVP cross-linking assists the ionic mobility with increasing mobile ion concentration and it also increases the strength of the composite with the number of reactive ionic cluster sites. The selection of ionic liquids as a high thermal stability electrolyte has also played an important role. ILs are composed of a cation (imidazolium) and an anion (sulfate, borate, phosphate) and are organic salts that are liquid around room temperature. ILs are employed as good electrolytes in conducting polymers due to their good electrical conductivity, heat stability, and good corrosion resistance. ILs, as permanent conductivity enhancers in polymeric films, produce improved electrical performance.21–23 We have demonstrated this novel route as a common electrode material for both DSSC and SC with high thermal stability. The combination of such materials can form high-performance SC and DSSCs, which are cost-effective for applications where in the development and consistency of the storage devices are important. A sulfated β-cyclodextrin/PVP/MnCO3 composite was believed to be able to provide clean energy for a long time even in a hot environment.
A new technique was used for the synthesis of metal carbonates from potassium permanganate and by mixing solvents such as methanol with DMF. The solvent proportion was adjusted for mono-dispersed crystalline MnCO3 with rhombohedra morphologies. The MnCO3 nanoparticles were prepared from KMnO4 (0.1 mmol) in a mixed solvent (25 mL) composed of methanol and DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide). This mixture was kept in a 33 mL stainless-steel autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h.24
β-Cyclodextrin was sulfonated using H2SO4 at a temperature of 0 °C, which was based on our previous report.25 The synthesized sulfated β-cyclodextrin (Sb-CD) was thermally cross-linked with PVP. This Sb-CD/PVP composite was incorporated with various weight percentages (wt%) of MnCO3, which were denoted as S1 = 0.5 wt%, S2 = 1.0 wt% and S3 = 1.5 wt%. The prepared Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite electrodes were fabricated as a CE for a DSSC and also as a storage electrode for a SC. The DSSC and SC were connected in parallel and an ionic liquid containing 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [BMI][TFSI] was used as the electrolyte. The efficiency of the DSSC was checked under a solar simulator. The performance of the DSSC and capacitance were measured up to 200 °C.
The XRD pattern of the prepared MnCO3 presents (102), (104), (110), (113), (202), (116), (122), and (300) peaks indexed to the crystal structure (Fig. 1a(i)). The common crystal growth model cleavage (104) peak with a sharp (012) peak represent rhombohedra, which is very rare (JCPDS Card: 83-1763).26Fig. 1a(ii) shows the diffraction pattern, which is probably due to the crystalline cellulosic structures of Sb-CD. PVP indicates an amorphous nature with low crystallinity in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1a(iii)). The XRD results indicate that the crystalline structures of cellulose27 are mostly disrupted by PVP and MnCO3 nanoparticles present in the composite (Fig. 1a(iv)). Most of the crystalline peaks indicate the MnCO3 pattern. This is evidence for the incorporation of MnCO3 nanoparticles with Sb-CD/PVP and also the miscibility of cellulosic chains in the synthesized composite (ESI Fig. 1† FTIR).

The XPS spectrum indicates the presence of Mn, O, and C as the main constituents (Fig. 1b). The peaks for Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 are centered at 653.4 and 642 eV, respectively, with a spin energy separation of 11.68 eV. This result was in accordance with the data reported for MnCO3. The solvent ratio and KMnO4 may also react to form MnCO3.28,29 5CH3OH + 4MnO−4 + 12H+ → 4Mn2+ + 11H2O + 5HCOOH(1) 5HCOOH + 2MnO−4 + 6H+ → 2Mn2+ + 5CO2 + 8H2O(2) 2(CH3)2–N–CHO + 2MnO−4 + 6H+ → 5(CH3)–NH + 2Mn2+ + 5CO2 + 3H2O(3) 2MnO−4 + Mn2+ → Mn3O4(4)CO2 + H2O → CO2−3 + 2H+ Mn2+ + CO2−3 → MnCO3(5) (6)

Fig. 2a1 shows the MnCO3 nanoparticles obtained from pure mixed solvents. It can be seen that the morphology and the size are not uniform and the particles reunite badly, which implies a rapid nucleation process. The particle size was controlled by microemulsion, which restrains the growth of the MnCO3 nanoparticles. TEM images also confirm the shape with size ranging from 30 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 2a2). Due to the intense redox in pure solvent, there is a minor aggregation of Mn3O4 followed by a side reaction (eqn (1) to (5)) when the Mn2+ ratio was higher in the initial stage of the polymer layer deposition on surface of the nanoparticles. The controlled morphology with size also depends on the solvent proportions.

A TEM image of the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite also confirms the polymer layer deposition and each particle shows a cavity and the incorporation of Sb-CD, as shown in Fig. 2e.30,31 The Sb-CD and PVP molecular interactions are clearly visible in the SEM image of the Sb-CD/PVP composite (Fig. 2b1). The reason for the agglomerated structure is that the PVP may act as a film-forming agent. The PVP thermal cross-linking and structural changes are assumed in eqn (6) and this cross-linking with the cellulosic polymer reaction mechanism has been discussed in our previous report.19 These structural changes are due to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups of the polymer components.32 The MnCO3 nanoparticles and cross-linked polymers exhibit bulk composite structures as mentioned in Fig. 2c1 and c2.

Fig. 3a represents the cyclic voltammetry studies of the synthesized composites, Sb-CD, SbCD/PVP, MnCO3, S1 (0.5 wt% MnCO3), S2 (1.0 wt% MnCO3), and S3 (1.5 wt% MnCO3), recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. In the CV results, the Sb-CD and Sb-CD/PVP polymer composites exhibited maximum covered typical oxidation and reduction peaks. The CV curves for the S1, S2, and S3 electrodes clearly show that all the voltammograms have a nearly rectangular shape, revealing the perfect electrochemical capacitive behaviour of Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3. All the curves for the electrodes S1, S2, and S3 show no obvious peaks, indicating that these electrodes are charged and discharged at a pseudo constant rate over the complete voltammetric cycle and that the surface process is the adsorption–desorption of ions.
In contrast, an obvious distortion from the rectangular shape in the CV curves was observed for the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 electrodes. This phenomenon can be explained from the view of the ionic motion in the electrolyte to electrode solid phase. It is evident that the mass loading of MnCO3 creates a different thickness of the electrodes and the S3 electrode was much thicker than that of the S1 and S2 electrodes. In the range of the applied scan rate, the ions have enough time to reach the surface of MnCO3 for the electrode S1 and S2 due to their thin thickness. The absorption/desorption reaction can occur favourably. However, in the case of the S3 electrode, it can be speculated that a longer distance of ionic motion is observed. Hence, the S3 electrode exhibits a lower capacitance than the S2 electrode. In addition, this substantial electrochemical performance could be increased by the sulfonated polymers and functional groups of PVP, and these functional groups create an electrochemically active catalyst area on the electrode's surface. Moreover, the presence of polymers complements the metal ions in terms of boosting the capacitance.33–36

Fig. 3b shows the CV curves for the S2 electrode increased from 10 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1 and the S2 composite exhibits no obvious deviation from the rectangular shape, which could be attributed to the influence of pseudocapacitance with MnCO3. The area in the CV curve of the composite electrode shows an incredible improvement compared to electrodes with MnCO3 and Sb-CD/PVP alone. The reason for charge storage in the prepared composites can be explained by two mechanisms, one is the adsorption–desorption and other is intercalation–deintercalation of protons and/or alkali metal ions on the surface of the oxide, respectively. From the MnCO3 with concomitant reduction–oxidation of the Mn ions,37,38 the oxidation state of Mn in MnCO3 is +2, thus the possibility of charge storage by the second mechanism is very improbable. However, high capacitance may also be obtained by an increasing amount of MnCO3 particles.
Nyquist plots for MnCO3, Sb-CD/PVP, and the S1, S2, and S3 composites are shown in Fig. 3c. All the plots show a semi-circular arc in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The diameter of the semi-circle in the high-frequency region was attributed to the charge-transfer resistance of the electrode (Rct). There are several accumulated polymers noticed on the external surface of the composite electrodes as exposed in the SEM and TEM images. These accumulated Sb-CD/PVP polymers on the outer surface decrease the contact with the electrolyte. The interaction between the aggregated polymer composite and the electrolyte is weak and make few contributions to charge accumulation. Moreover, the accumulated polymer on the outer surface may plug up the pores and block the diffusion of electrolyte, which prevents the interaction of the active material with the electrolyte. This may increase resistance effects in the composite electrode in the high frequency region. The straight line in the low-frequency region arises for S1, S2, and S3 due to pseudo capacitance (Cp). The high-frequency intercept with the real axis was related to the equivalent series resistance (Rs), which contains the resistance of the bulk electrolyte solution, the inherent resistance of the active material, and the contact resistance at the active material/current collector. The steep slope corresponds to efficient ion penetration between the electrode and electrolyte.

In the equivalent circuit, a solution resistance (Rs) was connected in series with a double layer capacitance (CDL), and the CDL was connected in parallel with the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and pseudocapacitance (Cp).
The parallel Rct and CDL configuration accounts for the semi-circular features, while Cp accounts for the steep line. For supercapacitors, the majority of the capacitance was only available at a low frequency, thus attention should be paid to keeping the impedance data in this range.39 The charge–discharge curves for the S1, S2 and S3 composite electrodes exhibited pseudocapacitance performance, since they deviate from linear shapes, as shown in Fig. 3d. This can also be confirmed from the skewed triangle shape of the charge–discharge curves of the composites and the increased discharge time compared with the symmetrical triangle of the curves with limited discharge time for the composite electrodes. The capacitance can also be calculated from the galvanostatic discharge curves using the following eqn (7). (7)where I (A) is the charge or discharge current, Δt (s) is the time for a full charge or discharge, m (g) indicates the mass of the active material, and ΔV represents the voltage change after a full charge or discharge.40 MnCO3 exhibited 126.2 F g−1 of capacitance and the S2 (Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3) composite possessed the highest capacitance of 202.6 F g−1. Moreover, these types of composites conserve a minimum of 65% of their initial capacitance (Fig. 3e).
The intended specific capacitance (SC) decreased with an increasing scan rate (Fig. 3f). At low scan rates, the ions from the electrolyte have enough time to adsorb/desorb at the inner and outer surfaces of the active material. At higher scan rates, the ions access only the outer surface of the active material due to the limited accessible time from the electrolyte. Hence, a low SC was observed at high scan rates. From these results, it was confirmed that when the scan rate increases, the capacitance of all the samples decreases and in the high frequency region, the supercapacitors behave like a mild resistor, which indicates that the electrolyte ions cannot penetrate into the micropores under increased scan rates or high frequencies.
The corresponding supercapacitor was also fabricated in a two-electrode system using the [BMI][TFSI] ionic liquid as the electrolyte. The S2 composite was mixed with carbon black, which was made into a slurry with a few drops of poly(tetrafluoroethylene). This was coated on a nickel mesh and dried at 90 °C. The CE was prepared by coating the S2 composite on a FTO glass plate as mentioned in Fig. 4f. The DSSC was fabricated with a TiO2 photo anode (doctor blade method)41,42 and an ion gel electrolyte43 ([BMI][TFSI] ionic liquid with KI and I2). The fabricated supercapacitor was connected in parallel with the prepared DSSC (Fig. 4a). The fabricated cell was placed under a 1 sun solar simulator (Fig. 4b and c) and the exhibited efficiency was investigated. The storage performance was also analysed for the supercapacitor after the light simulation was cut off (Fig. 4d). The schematic structure of the supercapacitor and DSSC are shown in Fig. 4e and f.

The fabricated supercapacitor and DSSC cell was placed in an electric oven at 25 °C for 2 h for thermal stability analysis.33 The temperature was increased as follows 25 °C, 35 °C, 50 °C, 75 °C, and 100 °C, and then the cell was placed in an electric furnace at 150 °C and 200 °C. Each increased temperature was analysed and the results are summarized in Fig. 4g and Table 1, with the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs.

The photovoltaic analysis of the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite polymer showed good catalytic activity. In the case of the S2 counter electrode, it exhibited a good short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.36 mA cm−2; however, the fill factor was 68.2% and its efficiency was 5.57%. By comparison, the Pt counter electrode DSSC showed 6.71% efficiency, which is nearly close to that of the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 counter electrode under the same conditions. The photovoltaic results showed good catalytic activity as CE catalysts for the I3− reduction in the DSSC. The Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 counter electrode has S, O and N atoms in its structure, which may help the catalytic activity. It was also clear that the host metal (MnCO3) should be incorporated with the alien atoms (C, S or N) to exhibit good catalytic behavior distinct from the metal hosts and so that their activity patterns closely resemble those of Pt. The incorporation with PVP heteroatoms also enhances the electrocatalytic activity in the counter electrode, which results in higher Jsc and FF values, thereby resulting in a higher conversion efficiency.
Moreover, the presence of the heteroatoms of PVP, including nitrogen, sulfonated β-cyclodextrin and carbon matrix, favor the adsorption and subsequent reduction of triiodide. In addition, the co-doping of N and S atoms enhanced the asymmetric spin density as well as the charge density, which are responsible for the electrocatalytic activities as reported previously.
However, it was also evident that the electronic structure of the host metal (MnCO3) should be modified by the alien atoms (i.e., C or N) to induce the electron transfer process, the direction (i.e., host metal to interstitial atom or interstitial atom to host metal) and extent of electron transfer. In addition, the catalytic activity can be also affected significantly by the particle size, mass loading and crystal structure.44–47

Table 2 deals with the comparison of this composite value with those already reported. To date, no report has been published for high temperature supercapacitors combined with dye sensitized solar cells. Hence, the comparison report was tabulated separately for supercapacitors and dye sensitized solar cells. The Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 electrode used as a supercapacitor exhibited 152 F g−1 of capacitance at 200 °C, which shows a higher capacitance performance than the other reported results. This composite CE also exhibited 3.9% of efficiency at 200 °C with DSSC application. From the literature, a high efficiency of 4.9% at 120 °C was already reported. However, the operating temperature was lower than our present report. In addition, based on the previous reports, the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite electrode showed some notable improvement in performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite electrodes for a parallel-connected supercapacitor and a DSSC (CE). In this study, we have used eco-friendly polymers, β-CD and PVP, and a simple method introduced for the high-temperature electrodes using an ionic liquid ion gel electrolyte. The conductive composite electrode with 1.0 wt% of MnCO3 (S2) produced efficient performance as a supercapacitor and also good counter electrode performance as a dye sensitized solar cell. This electrode exhibited a good photo conversion efficiency of 5.57% and the highest specific capacitance of 202 F g−1. This performance was maintained from 25 °C to 75 °C. In the high thermal treatment at 200 °C, this electrode retains 152 F g−1 of capacitance with 3.9% of DSSC efficiency. Moreover, the Sb-CD/PVP/MnCO3 composite exhibited 197.96 W h kg−1 of energy density and 86.06 kW kg−1 of power density. This type of composite may be a suitable electrode material for energy storage devices in hot environments.
