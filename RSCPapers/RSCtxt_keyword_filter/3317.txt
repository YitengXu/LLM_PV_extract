, Accepted 19th February 2013First published on 20th February 2013AbstractThiazole-containing electron-deficient unit DTABT as a building block was developed to construct donor–acceptor conjugated polymers (P1). Due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of DTABT, polymer P1 exhibited obviously lowered HOMO and LUMO levels relative to its thiophene-containing counterpart P2. Such low-lying LUMO level endowed P1 with high electron mobility, almost two orders of magnitude higher than P2. Meanwhile, balanced ambipolar transport behaviours of P1 were also observed in FET devices. All-polymer solar cells based on both polymers as acceptors were fabricated, in which P3HT/P1 blends showed power conversion efficiency twice as high as that of P3HT/P2. Further investigation showed that a P3HT/P1 blend film displayed smaller surface roughness and lower crystallinity of P3HT, indicating better miscibility of P3HT and P1. Compared to its thiophene-containing counterpart P2, P1 exhibited higher electron mobility and better miscibility with P3HT, and both advantages may together contribute to the significantly improved device performance of P1-based all-polymer solar cells.
Introduction
As a novel renewable energy source, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much research interest due to their intriguing flexible, low-cost, and light-weight features in applications.1–4 Significant progress has been made in polymer/fullerene-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 9.2% was achieved.5 Since the development of PSCs largely relies on the new structure design of active materials, exploring new materials is meaningful for further improving PCE and device stability of PSCs, as well as fundamental understanding of the charge generation mechanism.6 Compared with the great progress in donor research on BHJ solar cells, fewer efforts have been devoted to the investigation of acceptors, and thereby developing novel efficient acceptors is attracting a vital and growing interest.6–32 In particular, to develop new polymer acceptors to construct all-polymer solar cells has exhibited many advantages, such as offering stronger and broader absorption through tuning energy level and bandgap precisely, and providing more flexibility in the material design.15–32
Recently, several polymer acceptors based on perylene diimides (PDI),15–21 naphthalene diimides (NDI),22–27 and benzothiadiazole (BT)28–31 have been investigated. However, the development of all-polymer solar cells is still slow and most of the PCEs are lower than 2%,15–32 possibly due to the limited effective polymer acceptors. Thus to incorporate new electron-deficient building blocks is of great importance for increasing the diversity of polymer acceptors. Moreover, the structure–property relationship in all-polymer solar cells is seldom investigated, also hindering the development of new polymer acceptors.
4,7-Di(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) has been extensively used as an electron-deficient building block in polymeric donor materials of PSCs.1,3,33 Compared with its isoelectronic counterpart thiophene ring, thiazole as an electron-deficient unit was used as an active material for n-type organic field-effect transistors (FETs).34–40 Herein, by replacing thiophene groups in DTBT with thiazole units, we obtain a new electron-deficient building block, 4,7-di(thiazol-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTABT). Using this building block, donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer P1 is synthesized as an acceptor in all-polymer solar cells, which exhibits an obviously lowered LUMO level compared with its thiophene counterpart P2 (Scheme 1). All-polymer solar cells with P1 as acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor are fabricated and exhibit a PCE of up to 1.18%, twice as high as that of P2/P3HT. This result can be largely explained by the significantly increased electron mobility of P1 and the better miscibility of P1 and P3HT.

Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
Ladder-shaped unit indacenodithiophene (IDT) was chosen as the donor part of the target polymers P1 and P2 due to its good performances in p-type OFETs and donor materials of PSCs.41–46 The ladder-shaped building blocks facilitate π-electron delocalization and increase effective conjugation length by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units. Moreover, the rigidity of the ladder-shaped structure also suppresses the rotational disorder around interannular single bonds and lowers the reorganization energy, which in turn enhances the intrinsic charge mobility.47
Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic route to DTABT and both polymers P1 and P2. A Stille cross-coupling reaction between 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiazole (1) afforded 4,7-di(thiazol-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTABT) in 55% yield.33 Due to the poor solubility of dibromo compound 2, initial attempt to use 2 for the Stille-coupling polymerization to afford P1 was not successful. Another attempt to obtain compound 3 by reacting with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl lithium (LTMP) and trimethylchlorostannane also failed. Finally, a tributylstannyl group was introduced to solve the solubility and stability of the monomer. Following a similar procedure, 4,7-bis(5-(tributylstannyl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (4) was obtained as an orange oil, which was easily purified through aluminium oxide column chromatography. To compare with DTABT, DTBT was also synthesized according to the literature.41
P1 and P2 were prepared through the Stille-coupling polymerization between IDT and 4 or 5 using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst system. As the thermal heating method only gave the products with low molecular weight, high molecular weight polymers obtained through microwave-assisted polymerization were used for characterization and device fabrication. The as-synthesized polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction (sequentially by methanol, hexane, and CHCl3) to afford dark solids. Both polymers exhibit good solubility in CHCl3, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. The molecular weights of both polymers were evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene as an eluent at 140 °C. P1 displays a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 14.3 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.82, and P2 shows a Mn of 26.1 kDa and PDI of 1.50. As shown in Fig. S1,† both polymers exhibit good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (366 °C for P1 and 355 °C for P2). No phase transition was observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for both polymers before their decomposition (Fig. S1†).
Computational analysis
To further understand the properties of both polymers from a theoretical view, geometry optimization and electronic structure computation were carried out by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups for simplicity. As shown in Fig. 1, orbital distributions of P1 and P2 display the typical features of D–A copolymers. The HOMOs are well delocalized along the conjugated backbones, whereas LUMOs are mainly localized on the electron-deficient parts DTABT and DTBT. In other words, both HOMO and LUMO have a distribution on thiazole units of P1, and thereby incorporating DTABT into the polymer backbone modifies both the HOMO and LUMO levels of P1.

Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 both in dilute solutions (10−5 M in CHCl3) and in thin films are illustrated in Fig. 2. Typical dual band absorption features are observed for both polymers in solution and in film. The absorption bands from 500 to 750 nm (band I) are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the IDT donor to the DTBT or DTABT acceptor. Similar to the absorption spectra of monomers DTBT and DTABT (Fig. S2†), the bands from 350 to 500 nm (band II) of both polymers are assigned to the absorption of acceptor parts of the polymers (DTBT or DTABT). Compared with P2, thiazole-containing polymer P1 displays red-shifted absorption in solution; however, both polymers show almost identical absorption features from 550 to 750 nm in films. The absorption spectra of both polymers show red-shifted and increased 0–0 vibrational absorptions in thin films, indicating that the polymer backbones become more planar in the solid state. Compared with those in solutions, P1 red-shifts 24 nm in films, whereas P2 displays a larger red-shift of 42 nm. This result is probably due to the more planar structure of DTABT and thereby smaller torsion angle in the polymer backbones of P1 (Fig. S3†).

Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammetries (CV) of both polymers in thin films were measured to evaluate their electronic energy levels. Polymer films were drop-cast on a glassy carbon working electrode from CHCl3 at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. Measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. A platinum wire was utilized as the counter electrode. All potentials were recorded versus Ag/AgCl (saturated) as the reference electrode. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both polymers were estimated from the onset of oxidative peak and reductive peak. As shown Fig. 3, P1 shows clearly lowered HOMO and LUMO levels relative to P2 due to the more electron-deficient nature of DTABT. P1 has a HOMO/LUMO level of −5.43/−3.45 eV, and P2 has a HOMO/LUMO level of −5.28/−3.21 eV. Similar bandgaps of 1.98 and 2.07 eV are thus calculated for P1 and P2, respectively. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of both polymers are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO level of P1 is lower than that of P3HT by 0.65 eV, which is large enough to guarantee the formation of a downhill driving force for the energetically favourable electron transfer in a P1/P3HT blend.2

Charge-transporting and photovoltaic properties
Electron mobility of acceptors has an important influence on charge separation in PSCs.48,49 For this consideration, high mobility n-type polymers based on PDI15–21 and NDI22–27 were widely used as acceptors in all-polymer solar cells to achieve high PCEs. To investigate the charge transporting properties of P1 and P2, top-gate, bottom-contact (TG-BC) thin film FETs were fabricated. This device configuration is preferred for ambipolar or n-type organic materials, because of its better injection characteristics and the encapsulation effect of the top dielectric layer.50–52 In thin film FET devices, P2 exhibited a hole mobility of 0.53 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. By incorporating DTABT into the polymer backbone, P1 showed a lower hole mobility of 9.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, but the electron mobility was dramatically improved up to 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of P2 (Fig. 4). By incorporating DTABT, balanced ambipolar transport of P1 was observed, possibly due to the much lower LUMO level of P1. Lowering LUMO level to increase electron mobility and achieve ambipolar transport was also observed in other polymer systems.52–54

Compared to the conventional structure, BHJ solar cell devices with inverted architecture are known to possess much improved long-term stability, as well as maintain high device performance.47,55,56 In all-polymer solar cells, increased Jsc was observed with the inverted device configuration.25 Herein, all-polymer solar cell devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The active layer was constructed by either P1 or P2 as the acceptor in the blend with P3HT as the donor. The films were spin-cast onto ZnO coated ITO from dichlorobenzene solutions at a total concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and dried at room temperature for more than 6 h, then thermal annealed at 140 °C for 10 min before thermal deposition of MoO3 and Ag.
Different blend ratios of P3HT to polymer acceptors were screened to optimize the device performance (Table 2). For P1, the best performance was obtained with a weight ratio of P3HT/P1 at 1.5:1. The PCE of 1.18% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 2.60 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.45 was achieved. With P2 as the acceptor, all-polymer solar cells only showed a highest PCE of 0.58% at the same blend ratio but lower Voc and Jsc of 0.90 V and 1.50 mA cm−2, respectively. For polymer acceptors, the lower LUMO level may lead to a reduced Voc in polymer solar cell devices which is disadvantageous to achieve high PCE. Note that P1 has a lower LUMO level, but the device based on P1 as the acceptor exhibited higher Voc.

As shown in Fig. 5b, the blend films have similar absorption profiles. Shoulder peaks at 610 nm are observed in absorption and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, indicating that P3HT has ordered packing in both films.57 The spectral profiles of EQE are in agreement with those of absorption, suggesting that the photocurrents are produced from both P3HT and acceptor absorption. It may indicate that, not only electron transfer from P3HT to polymer acceptors, but also hole transfer from the acceptors to P3HT occurred during the device operation. For devices based on P2, the maximum EQE is 10% at 570 nm; the P3HT/P1 solar cells exhibit a higher EQE with a maximum of 19% at 560 nm.

Morphology characterization and molecular packing
The morphology of the active layer has a crucial influence on the performance of PSC devices. Herein, the different surface morphologies of both blend films were examined by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6). In comparison with P3HT/P2, P3HT/P1 blends show a relatively smoother surface, indicating that P3HT/P1 blend film is more uniform.

The grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD) patterns of P3HT/P1 and P3HT/P2 blend films are shown in Fig. 6c–f. For both blend films, only diffractions of P3HT were observed at the identical 2θ degrees. The strong out-of-plane diffraction at 2θ = 4.40° corresponds to a d-spacing of 16.17 Å (λ = 1.240 Å). The other two peaks are attributed to the (200) and (300) diffractions, indicating an edge-on lamellar packing of P3HT chains. The in-plane diffraction peaked at 2θ = 19.15°corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.78 Å, which is in good agreement with the diffraction data of pure P3HT films. These results reveal that P3HT has an identical periodic oriented arrangement in both blend films, whereas P1 or P2 is amorphous, consistent with the peaks at 610 nm (aggregation peak of P3HT) observed in absorption and EQE spectra. Thus, the packing mode of P3HT has not changed in the presence of polymer acceptors. The much weaker out-of-plane diffraction intensity of a P3HT/P1 blend film revealed that P1 has a better miscibility with P3HT, probably because the presence of P1 in the blend film greatly disrupts the formation of P3HT crystals.
Although P1 shows almost identical absorption and quite similar bandgaps relative to the thiophene counterpart P2, their device performances of solar cells are quite different. The all-polymer solar cells based on P2 as the acceptor exhibit lower Voc, which can be explained by the geminate recombination mechanism.58,59 As the main loss mechanism of all-polymer solar cells, geminate recombination has been demonstrated to be closely related to phase separation in polymer blends.58,59 Thus, the low Voc indicates that P3HT/P2 blends may have unfavourable morphology and poor phase separation, which was further proved by AFM and GIXD. The differences of the two films are probably related to the different interactions between P3HT and the polymer acceptors. In addition, due to the more electron-deficient nature of DTABT, the LUMO level of P1 is lowered, and the electron mobility of P1 is dramatically increased, which is beneficial in increasing Jsc. Optimized morphology and higher electron mobility may together contribute to the higher PCE of P3HT/P1 devices.
Conclusions
By replacing thiophene with thiazole, DTABT has been developed as a new electron-deficient building block for donor–acceptor polymers. Based on DTABT, polymer P1 exhibits close bandgap and almost identical absorption features in thin films relative to its thiophene counterpart P2. Due to the strong electron-deficient nature of DTABT, P1 displays obviously lower HOMO and LUMO levels relative to polymer P2. As a result of energy level tuning, the electron mobility of P1 is dramatically increased, almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of P2. Meanwhile, balanced ambipolar transport behaviours of P1 are observed in FET devices. All-polymer solar cells based on the two polymers as acceptors have also been fabricated. P3HT/P1 blends show power conversion efficiency up to 1.18%, twice as high as that of P3HT/P2. In a P3HT/P1 blend film, smaller surface roughness and lower crystallinity of P3HT are confirmed, indicating the optimized morphology and better miscibility of P3HT and P1. DTABT endows P1 with higher electron mobility and better miscibility with P3HT, indicating that DTABT has great potential to be a good building block in ambipolar and n-type polymer FET materials and polymer acceptors.

Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
Glass coated with patterned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) with a square resistance of 13 Ω cm−2 was purchased from Tianjin Glass Factory. Before device fabrication, the glass underwent a wet-cleaning course in an ultrasonic bath sequentially in acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 10 min and subsequent 15 min oxygen plasma treatment, a thin film of zinc oxide (ZnO) was fabricated through the sol–gel method.55 The blend solutions were prepared by dissolving P3HT/P1 or P3HT/P2 in o-dichlorobenzene with a total concentration of 12 mg mL−1. Active layers were spin-coated in a nitrogen-filled glove box and dried at room temperature for more than 6 h, and then thermal annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the active layer was about 100 nm measured by the surface profiler. A 15 nm thick MoO3 layer followed by a 60 nm thick Ag layer were thermally deposited under a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was 15 mm2. All devices were encapsulated in the glove box and tested under ambient conditions. The PCE was tested under AM 1.5G irradiation at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport Solar Simulator 94021A) calibrated by a NREL certified standard silicon cell (4 cm2). J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2636A semiconductor analyzer. An IPCE test was carried out under monochromic illumination (a Newport 74125 monochromator equipped with a 66984 ARC lamp) and the calibration of the incident light intensity was performed with a calibrated silicon photodiode.
