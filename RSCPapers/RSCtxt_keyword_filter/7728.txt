    , Accepted 28th March 2013First published on 29th April 2013AbstractNew π-extended porphyrin dyes YD26–YD29 with long alkoxyl chains at the ortho positions of the meso-phenyls, and meta di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted porphyrins YD12–CN, and YD13–CN were synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells, and their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated and compared with those of YD12 and YD13. The absorption spectra of YD26–YD29 showed a slight red shift of Soret bands and blue shift of Q bands as compared to the meta-substituted porphyrins due to the electron-donating effects of dioctyloxy substituents at the ortho-positions of the meso-phenyl rings. Replacement of the carboxyl with a cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group results in significant broadening and red shifts of the absorptions, which is due to the strong electronic coupling between the pull unit and the porphyrin ring facilitated by the CC triple bond. The electrochemical studies and quantum-chemical calculations (DFT) indicated that the ortho alkoxy-substituted sensitizers exhibit lower oxidation potential, i.e. a higher HOMO energy level, and their HOMO–LUMO gaps are comparable to the meta-substituted analogues. The photovoltaic measurements confirmed that the ortho-octyloxy groups in the two meso-phenyls of YD26 and YD27 play a significant role in preventing dye aggregation thereby enhancing the corresponding short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage. The power conversion efficiency (η) of YD26 is 8.04%, which is 11% higher than that of YD12, whereas the efficiency of YD27 is 6.03%, which is 135% higher than that of YD13. On the other hand, the poor performance of YD28 and YD29 is due to the floppy structural nature and limited molecular rigidity of the cyanoacrylic acid anchor.
Introduction
Depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing demand for energy creates an urgent need to discover alternatives for the world’s conventional energy supplies.1 Hence, further research to explore alternative, safe and renewable sources of energy is extremely important.2 Among all renewable energy technologies, photovoltaics which utilize solar energy is believed to be the most promising one. Solar energy, one of the most abundant and renewable sources of energies, is poised to play a great role, as the amount of energy emitted from sun to earth is several thousand times higher than the global requirement.3 The photovoltaic devices made by silicon semiconductors are nowadays used for the direct conversion of sunlight into electrical energy. However, this type of solar cells has major limitations due to difficulties related to large scale production and high fabrication cost.
Inspired by the pioneering work done by Grätzel and co-workers over the past decades, dye-sensitized solar cells4 (DSCs) have attracted much attention with the advantages of high energy conversion efficiency, low cost together with facile fabrication and are nowadays used as promising alternatives to the conventional silicon-based solar cells.5 Ruthenium polypyridyl complex photosensitizers such as N719, N3 and the black dyes show a solar-to-energy conversion efficiency of up to 11% under standard illumination (AM 1.5).6 However, the limited availability, complicated purification and environmental concerns of the ruthenium-based dyes prompted researchers to search for cheaper and safer organic dyes. Organic sensitizers have many advantages such as large molar extinction coefficient, control of absorption wavelength, simple design and synthesis, lower cost and great flexibility in structural tuning with high stability than other photosensitizers.
Hence, recently many studies have been performed aimed at the development of highly efficient and stable organic sensitizers. As a result, a number of organic dyes without metals7 or with inexpensive metal and π-conjugated8 molecules, hemicyanine,9 coumarin,10 indoline,11 thiophene,12 perylene,13 cyanine14 and triarylamine15 DSCs have been intensively studied. The most efficient organic dyes have reached encouraging solar power conversion efficiencies up to 10%.
Among numerous non-ruthenium dyes, porphyrins and the related derivatives are widely studied potential sensitizers for DSCs, due to their structural similarity to chlorophylls in natural photosynthetic systems as well as their intense Soret bands in the range 400 to 450 nm and moderate Q bands between 500 and 650 nm.16 More importantly, their optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties can be easily modulated by peripheral substitutions and/or metal complexation. However, most of these porphyrin-based dyes display lower efficiency due to the formation of severe dye aggregates and insufficient light-harvesting ability in the region between the Soret and Q bands. One of the approaches to improving the cell performance of the porphyrin dyes is to extend their π-system, which leads to broadening and red shifts of the absorptions, thus enhancing their light-harvesting efficiency. Officer et al. synthesized β-carboxyl-substituted monomer and multiporphyrin arrays used for testing photovoltaic solar cells.17 Imahori and coworkers reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of various unsymmetrical, π-elongated naphthyl fused porphyrins which modulate the electronic structures of the porphyrin dye to match the light harvesting properties of the solar spectrum thereby consequently doubling the cell performance of the naphthyl-fused porphyrin than the unfused counterpart.18 The best performance of the dyes depends upon the broadening of light absorption capability, fast electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band and finally retardation in charge recombination.19,20
In general, simple porphyrin macrocycles with a large planar-system suffer from severe dye aggregation. Our previous reports on porphyrin sensitizers showed that attachment of tert-butyl groups to the meta-positions of the peripheral phenyls in the meso-positions of the porphyrin can moderately reduce dye aggregation.21 In the push–pull porphyrins,21–26 one meso-position of the porphyrin core is attached by a strong electron donor such as triphenylamine or diphenylamine opposite to the meso-substituted linker via an ethynyl bridge with a carboxylic acid serving as an anchoring group for dye adsorption to the surface of TiO2. Such a push–pull structural feature is believed to be responsible for the excellent cell performance of the devices. To improve the device performance, the phenyl bridge between the carboxyl and porphyrin ring in YD11 was modified with a naphthalene unit (YD12) to increase π-extension, resulting in a red-shift and broadening of the absorptions.21 However, the replacement of the phenyl group with an even more π-extended anthracene bridge (YD13) decreased power conversion efficiency due to molecular aggregation.23 More recently, YD2–o–C8 with octoxyl groups at the ortho-positions of the peripheral phenyls, attached to the meso-positions of the porphyrin core has achieved a record efficiency of 12.3% when co-sensitized with an organic dye Y123.26 Based on our previous work we thus aim to synthesize naphthalene- and anthracene-bridged porphyrins with a carboxyl or cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group and to investigate the structure–photovoltaic property relationship of these porphyrin dyes. The molecular structures of these porphyrins YD12, YD13, YD12–CN, YD13–CN, YD26–YD29 studied in this work are shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
As mentioned, replacement of meta-substituted tert-butyl groups by octoxyl groups at the ortho-positions of the peripheral phenyl rings in the meso-positions of porphyrin core can effectively reduce dye aggregation in porphyrin YD2–o–C8. In addition, the alkyl chains form a hydrophobic environment to successfully block the approach of the electrolyte to the surface of TiO2 and reduce charge recombination, thus significantly enhancing the power conversion efficiency.26 The naphthalene- and anthracene-bridged porphyrins YD26 and YD27 were designed based on the same concept. It is also desirable to study the cyanoacrylic acid analogues YD12–CN, YD13–CN, YD28, and YD29 since it has been widely used as the anchoring group in the most efficient organic dyes. The syntheses of these porphyrins are straightforward by employing Sonogashira coupling of precursor 1 or 2 with the appropriate halides of the pull unit as outlined in Scheme 1. The detailed experimental procedures for the porphyrin dyes and intermediates are given in ESI.†

Absorption and emission spectra
The absorption spectra of these porphyrins in THF solvent are given in Fig. 2 and the corresponding spectral data are summarized in Table 1. Absorption spectra of all these porphyrin dyes exhibit maxima attributed to π–π* transitions in the range 400–550 nm for the Soret band and 550–750 nm for the Q bands. Replacement of meta-substituted tert-butyl groups by octoxyl groups at the ortho-positions of the peripheral phenyls cause slight changes on the absorption features of the porphyrin dyes. The Soret bands of YD26–YD29 are slightly red-shifted whereas their Q bands are slightly blue-shifted as compared with the di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted counterparts. This is ascribed to the electronic effects of the two electron-donating dioctyloxy substituents at the ortho-positions of the meso-phenyl ring. A similar trend was also observed in fluorescence, the emission maxima for porphyrin dyes YD26–YD29 are blue-shifted. The absorption properties of these porphyrin dyes are expected to be significantly changed as the structures of the pull units are varied because there is strong electronic coupling between the pull unit and the porphyrin ring, efficiently mediated by the CC triple bond. The anthracene-bridged porphyrins YD13 and YD27 show red shifts and broadening on both Soret and Q bands compared to the corresponding naphthalene-bridged analogues YD12 and YD28 due to π-extension. The use of cyanoacrylic acid instead of carboxylic acid results in slight red shifts and significant broadening on the absorptions in both naphthalene- and anthracene-bridged systems. Similar to the absorption spectra, the emission spectra also red-shifted as the π-bridge is extended and/or the strong pull unit cyanoacrylic acid is incorporated to the porphyrin macrocycles as compared to those of their corresponding carboxyl counterparts. The detailed fluorescence data are listed in the Table 1.

Electrochemical properties and energy levels
The redox potentials of these porphyrin dyes were determined by using cyclic voltammetry under ambient conditions as summarized in Table 1. All porphyrins exhibited reversible waves for the first oxidation potential, corresponding to the HOMO energy of the dye, at a potential greater than that of the I−/I3− (0.35 V) couple. The first oxidation waves were observed in the range +0.80 to +0.83 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) for YD26–YD29. These values are lower than those of di-tert-butylphenyl-substituted analogues because of the electron-donating alkoxyl substituents on the meso-phenyl rings (Table 1). Similarly, cathodic shifts of the reduction potentials for YD26–YD29 relative to those of meta-substituted phenyl counterparts reflect a lifting of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and are a manifestation of the same effects. Variation of the pull units for the porphyrins with the same peripheral phenyls only slightly influences the first oxidation potential. This is because the electron density for the HOMO is located on the push unit and porphyrin ring. However, more pronounced changes on the first reduction potential were observed since the electron distribution of the LUMO is mainly located on the pull unit. These electrochemical results are consistent with those obtained from the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations discussed in the next section.
The potentials measured in THF vs. Fc+/Fc were converted to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by addition of +0.63 V. The energy levels for the HOMO and excited singlet states of the porphyrins used in this study were derived from the equation E0−0* = Eox1 − E0−0, in which Eox1 is the first oxidation potential of a porphyrin dye and E0−0 represents the energy gap between highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which is estimated from the intercept of the normalized absorption and emission spectra in THF. The energy levels of these porphyrins are depicted in Fig. 3. The HOMO level of these dyes are more positive than the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (+0.35 V vs. NHE), indicating that there is enough driving force for the dye regeneration. On the other hand, the calculated E0-0* values are all more negative than the conduction edge (CB) (−0.50 V vs. NHE) of TiO2. Therefore, these types of sensitizers have sufficient driving force for electron injection to TiO2.

Quantum-chemical calculations
To gain insight into the electron distribution of the frontier and other close-lying orbitals, we performed quantum-chemical calculations on these porphyrins using the DFT approach at the RB3LYP/6-31G* level (Spartan 08 package). To simplify the computations, the alkyl groups of phenyl rings were replaced by hydrogen atoms and methyl groups for the meta- and ortho-substituted phenyls. Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show an energy-level diagram and the corresponding molecular orbitals for these porphyrin dyes. Replacement of meta-substituted di-tert-butyl groups with ortho-substituted octoxyl groups on peripheral phenyls of the porphyrin core, resulted in an increase of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the HOMO–LUMO gaps being almost unchanged, which are in accordance with the potential feature shown in Fig. 3. The electronic densities of these porphyrins are mainly located on the π-system of the porphyrin and the diarylamine at the HOMO and HOMO − 1. The electronic distributions of the frontier orbitals for compounds YD12 and YD13 resemble those of YD26 and YD27 because of the structural similarity. Similarly, YD12–CN and YD13–CN show electron distributions in accordance with those of YD28 and YD29, respectively. The electron distributions of the LUMO for porphyrins YD12 and YD13 are mainly located at the naphthalene and anthracene linkers, respectively. The same trend was observed for YD26 and YD27 due to similarity in the structures. When a strong pull unit cyanoacrylic acid is introduced to the naphthalene and anthracene the electron densities of the LUMO for YD12–CN, YD13–CN, YD28 and YD29 are mainly located on both the π-linker and anchoring group.
Photovoltaic characteristics
The photovoltaic properties of four naphthalene-bridged porphyrins YD12, YD12–CN, YD26 and YD28, and four anthracene-bridged porphyrins YD13, YD13–CN, YD27 and YD29 were investigated using the TiO2 electrodes fabricated at the same film thickness (10 + 4 μm) under identical experimental conditions.21 Corresponding current–voltage characteristics and action spectra of incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are displayed in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively, with the results of naphthalene and anthracene-bridged porphyrins shown as plots (a) and (b) in each figure. The obtained photovoltaic parameters of the eight devices are summarized in Table 2. For the naphthalene-bridged porphyrins, the ortho-substituted long alkoxyl chains in the two meso-phenyls of YD26 play a key role to prevent dye aggregation so that both short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) were significantly enhanced for YD26 than for YD12. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (η) of YD26 reached 8.04%, which is ∼11% higher than that of YD12 (7.23%). This phenomenon is consistent with the YD2 system for which the YD2–o–C8 device outperformed the YD2 device with a similar molecular design.2 For the YD12–CN device with the cyanoacrylic acid moiety as an anchoring group, both JSC and VOC were significantly reduced so that its performance became the poorest one among all the naphthalene-bridged porphyrin devices. Even though the long alkoxyl chains were involved in YD28 in order to reduce the extent of dye aggregation, the improvement was very limited for this cyanoacrylic acid-based porphyrin. One possibility for the poor performance of YD28 with respect to that of YD26 is the floppy structural nature of the porphyrin, which might lead to YD28 to tilt down the TiO2 surface for an efficient charge recombination to occur.19

The devices made of YD13 were found to perform extremely poorly due to a serious problem of dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface that significantly reduced the efficiency of electron injection from the excited state of the dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2.23 However, the ortho-substituted long alkoxyl chains in YD27 exhibited dramatic effects to decrease the degree of dye aggregation so that the IPCE values of YD27 were significantly improved by a factor of three over those of YD13. As a result, JSC of the YD27 device was improved by more than a factor of two over that of the YD13 device. Moreover, VOC of YD27 was greater than that of YD13 by ∼40 mV, and this improvement is understood as being due to both effects of up-shifted potential band edge and retarded charge recombination for the former compared to the latter.27 Therefore, the device performance of YD27 reached η = 6.03%, which is remarkably improved by 135% compared with that of YD13. On the other hand, the improvement of the performance with the design of ortho-substitution for the cyanoacrylic acid-based porphyrin YD29 over that of YD13–CN was very limited as in the case of YD28vs.YD12–CN, confirming that molecular rigidity plays a key role to improve the device performance for porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.
Conclusions
We have synthesized new naphthalene- and anthracene-bridged porphyrins with carboxylic and cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group for DSCs applications. The absorption and emission bands of ortho dioctyloxy-substituted porphyrins YD26 and YD27 are slightly red shifted for the Soret band and slightly blue-shifted for the Q bands compared to the meta-substituted porphyrins. The anthracene-bridged porphyrins, in addition to red shifts, showed broadening on both Soret and Q bands than naphthalene analogues due to π-extension. Furthermore, the use of cyanoacrylic acid instead of carboxylic acid as the anchoring group causes significant broadening and red shifts of the absorptions. However, the photovoltaic performance of the cyanaoacrylic acid-based porphyrins is poorer compared to carboxyl-based analogues due to the lack of molecular rigidity.25 Electrochemical studies and DFT calculations revealed that the HOMO–LUMO band gaps are almost unchanged upon substitution of the meta-di-tert-butyl with ortho-dioctoxyl groups and the redox potentials of the alkoxy-substituted porphyrins are more positive than the corresponding meta-substituted analogues. Additionally, the octyloxy substituents form a hydrophobic environment to reduce charge recombination and suppress dye aggregation on the surface of TiO2, thereby strikingly increasing the power conversion efficiencies for YD26 (8.04%) and YD27 (6.03%) compared to those of their meta-substituted counterparts YD12 (7.23%) and YD13 (2.57%).
