    , Accepted 14th February 2013First published on 14th February 2013AbstractA novel compact diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dye was designed and synthesized using DPP core as a bridge to connect bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)phenylamine and cyanoacetic acid units with the D–π–A configuration, and employed as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells, giving a high power conversion efficiency of 8.61% under AM 1.5 conditions.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are one of the most promising alternatives to the conventional inorganic devices due to their potentially low material/fabrication cost and relatively high conversion efficiencies.1 In DSCs, the sensitizer is one of the key components, exerting a significant influence on the device power conversion and stability. With ruthenium complexes2a–d and zinc porphyrin dyes,2e,f high power conversion efficiencies of up to 8–12% have been achieved. On the other hand, metal-free organic dyes, usually with the electron donor–π bridge–electron acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, have been actively pursued due to their molecular tailoring flexibility and raw material abundance.3 In the D–π–A organic dyes, triarylamine and cyanoacrylic acid were widely used as a donor and an acceptor, respectively, and various π-conjugated bridges were employed to bridge the donor and acceptor units to create a large number of D–π–A dyes for DSCs. It is well known that the bridge is of paramount importance in tuning the molecular energy gap, and the electronic and steric structures, strongly affecting device performances.4
The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) chromophore has a uniquely planar conjugated bicyclic structure with electron-withdrawing property, and its derivatives are extensively used as high-performance pigments due to its exceptional photochemical, mechanical and thermal stability.5 Following its successful investigations in a series of optical electronic devices,6 it was tested as a bridge to construct D–π–A organic dyes for DSCs recently,7 and the device performances have been greatly improved since the report in 2010.7a Recently, Han's group introduced a strong electron donor indoline into a DPP dye, giving an efficiency of 7.4%.7d Very recently, an asymmetric DPP sensitizer with intense absorption in the red/near-IR region was prepared with an efficiency of 7.7%, and a higher efficiency of 8.6% was achieved by its co-sensitization with another organic sensitizer with complementary spectral absorption in the visible region.7f Thus, DPP is a desirable building block for constructing highly efficient sensitizers in DSCs.
In this article, we demonstrate a successful design of a new metal-free organic dye, utilizing the DPP core as the π-conjugated bridge, bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)phenylamine as the electron donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor/anchoring group (denoted as ICD-1). For comparison, a reference sensitizer was synthesized with an additional phenyl unit inserted between the triphenylamine unit and DPP core (denoted as ICD-2), whose structure was extensively studied in DPP-based sensitizers recently.7 Our experiment showed that, without the phenyl unit, the dye absorption band in ICD-1 is dramatically red-shifted with highly enhanced molar coefficient efficiency, and the power conversion efficiency was significantly improved from 7.20% (ICD-2) to 8.61% (ICD-1) in DSCs with an I−/I3− based electrolyte under standard AM 1.5 conditions.
Experimental section
Measurement and characterization
NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER AVANCE 400 MHz instrument. The residual solvent protons (1H) or the solvent carbons (13C) were used as internal standards. 1H-NMR data are presented as follows: the chemical shift in ppm (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane (multiplicity, coupling constant (Hz), integration). The following abbreviations are used in reporting NMR data: s, singlet; br.s, broad singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; dd, doublet of doublets; and m, multiplet. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were taken on a Bruker Daltonics Inc. APEXII FT-ICR spectrometer. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded at room temperature using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel, 67005). The action spectra of the monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were collected using a commercial setup (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). A 300 W Xenon lamp was employed as light source for generation of a monochromatic beam. Calibrations were performed with a standard silicon photodiode. IPCE is defined as IPCE(λ) = hcJsc/eφλ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, e is the electronic charge, λ is the wavelength in meters (m), Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (A m−2), and φ is the incident radiation flux (W m−2).
Materials
All reagents were obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Aladdin Chemical Co., and J&K Chemical Co. and they were used as received unless otherwise specified. All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents were performed in an atmosphere of dry argon. The solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene) were purified by routine procedures and were distilled under dry argon before being used. 1,4-Diketo-3,6-bis(4-bromophenyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole (DPP) was prepared according to the reference procedures.8

The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, followed by dropping 1-bromohexane (13.3 g, 80 mmol) in 30 mL of DMF. The mixture was kept for an additional 30 h at room temperature and filtered.

DSC fabrication
The nanocrystalline TiO2 pastes (particle size, 20 nm) were prepared using a previously reported procedure.9 Fluorine doped thin oxide (FTO, 4 mm thickness, 10 ohm sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) conducting electrodes were washed with soap and water, followed by sonication for 10 min in acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Following a drying period, the electrodes were submerged in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C, and then washed by water and ethanol. On the electrodes, an 11 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and a 6 μm thick TiO2 light scattering layer (particle size, 400 nm, PST-400C) were prepared by the screen-printing method. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min, followed by treating with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C and subsequent sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of TiO2 films was measured using a profiler, Sloan, Dektak3.
The electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM ICD-1 or ICD-2 and 20 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) in 4-tert-butanol–acetonitrile mixture–tetrahydrofuran (1:1:0.2, v/v) and kept for 24 h at room temperature. The dyed electrodes were then rinsed with the mixed solvent to remove the excess dye. A platinum-coated counter electrode was prepared according to a previous report,10 and two holes were drilled on its opposite sides. The two electrodes were sealed together with a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through one of the two holes in the counter electrode, and the holes were sealed with the thermoplastic Surlyn. The electrolyte contains 0.68 M dimethyl imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.40 M tert-butylpyridine in the mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). All the devices were prepared with a photoactive area of about 0.3 cm2, and a metal mask of 0.165 cm2 was used to cover the device for photovoltaic property measurements.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
The synthetic routes to ICD-1 and ICD-2 are described in Scheme 1. Their UV-Vis absorption spectra examined in dichloromethane solutions and on a transparent TiO2 film (4.5 μm) are displayed in Fig. 1, and the relevant parameters are collected in Table 1. Both the dyes showed broad absorption spectra with two absorption bands covering a wide range in the visible region. Interestingly, the longer wavelength band of ICD-1 (λmax = 543 nm), assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), is significantly red-shifted compared to that of ICD-2 (λmax = 519 nm), although ICD-2 has one additional phenyl ring. The UV-Vis spectra of dyes ICD-1 and ICD-2 adsorbed on transparent TiO2 films were recorded and are shown in Fig. 2, where the CT bands of ICD-1 and ICD-2 were slightly blue-shifted with λmax at 528 nm and 514 nm, respectively, compared to the solution spectra. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficient of ICD-1 (ε = 48100 L mol−1 cm−1) is higher than that of ICD-2 (ε = 43200 L mol−1 cm−1). The results imply that the device with ICD-1 would harvest more photons and give a higher conversion efficiency as compared to the ICD-2 based device. In general, the ICT band is strongly related to the nature of electron donor, acceptor, and the bridge connecting them in a D–π–A system. Thus, the ICT in ICD-1 is more efficient than that in ICD-2. In this case, the additional benzene ring between the donor and DPP units is not an effective conjugation bridge for electron transfer in ICD-2. The reason could be explained by the presence of a non-planar biphenyl structure, which would hinder charge transfer from the donor to acceptor in the molecule.11

 Fig. 2  IPCE spectra of DSCs with ICD-1 and ICD-2, the inset shows their current–voltage characteristics. 
To investigate the molecular energy levels, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate with ferrocene as an internal standard at 0.63 V vs. NHE. The first oxidation potentials (E+/0) of ICD-1 and ICD-2 were observed to be 0.97 and 0.99 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are assigned to the oxidation of triphenylamine units. The positive shift of the oxidation potential in ICD-2 means the weaker donor–acceptor interaction due to poor charge transfer from triphenylamine to cyanoacetic acid, in keeping with the analysis presented above. Both the potential values are substantially more positive than that of the iodide/triiodide couple redox (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the ground-state sensitizer regeneration is energetically favorable in DSCs.12 The optical transition energies (E0–0) were 2.04 eV for ICD-1 and 2.12 eV for ICD-2, estimated from the intersection of their absorption and emission spectra. The excited-state redox potentials, E+/*, determined by subtracting E0–0 from E+/0, were −1.07 V for ICD-1 and −1.13 eV for ICD-2. Both the values are negative enough to allow their excited state electron transfer into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE).13

Fig. 2 shows the action spectra in the form of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs). The ICD-1 based device clearly exhibited a stronger and broader response in the entire visible spectral region, especially in the red region, as compared to that of the ICD-2 based device. The former showed plateaus of over 80% from 450 to 630 nm with the highest value of 87% at 600 nm and an onset at 800 nm, while ICD-2 presented a relatively narrow response spectrum with the highest value of 82% at 543 nm. The difference between IPCE spectra is in good agreement with their difference in absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 1. The higher IPCE values for ICD-1 in the whole spectrum imply efficient charge transfer upon photo-excitation, partly due to the efficient electron communication, as discussed above.
The inset in Fig. 2 shows the energy conversion efficiency for DSCs with ICD-1 and ICD-2 under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The ICD-1 based-device gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.65 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 708 ± 10 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73 ± 0.02, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η), derived from the equation η = JscVocFF/light intensity, of 8.61%, while the ICD-2 based device gave a Jsc of 13.67 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, Voc of 712 ± 10 mV, FF of 0.74 ± 0.02, and η of 7.20% under the same conditions. The large difference in the efficiency comes mainly from the differences in the Jsc between them. The higher Jsc for ICD-1 is consistent with its higher and broader IPCE spectrum as compared with that for ICD-2. The comparison between ICD-1 and ICD-2 clearly reflects the importance of molecular configuration in the performance.
Density functional theory calculations
In order to gain insight into the geometrical configuration and electron distribution of the frontier orbitals of the two dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were made on a B3LYP/6-31G level. Their optimized ground state molecular structures and the corresponding dihedral angles are presented in Fig. 3. As expected, the additional phenyl unit in ICD-2 caused an additional torsion in the biphenyl unit with a dihedral angle of ≈32°. Correspondingly, the electron distribution of the HOMO is obstructed by the additional phenyl unit, and located mainly on the separate triphenylamine and DPP units in ICA-2 as shown in Fig. 4. By contrast, the HOMO of ICD-1 is homogeneously delocalized over the whole triphenylamine and DPP units. For both dyes, the LUMO orbitals show a similar electron distribution over the DPP core, phenyl unit, thiophene unit, and cyanoacetic acid unit with little contribution from the former. According to the observation, electron communication may be more favorable between the donor and acceptor in ICD-1, allowing an efficient electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 electrode under light irradiation, which may result in a higher device performance as compared with that for ICD-2.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel compact DPP-based dye ICD-1 was designed and employed as a sensitizer in DSCs, giving a high power conversion efficiency of 8.61%, which is much higher than that (7.20%) for the reference dye with an additional phenyl unit inserted between the triphenylamine unit and DPP core, whose structure was extensively studied in DPP-based sensitizers recently. Our results indicate that molecular engineering is crucial for constructing highly efficient sensitizers in DSCs, and the results would provide valuable, basic guidelines for rational designs of D–π–A molecules for high-performance DSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Further improvement of the performance could be expected for DPP sensitizers with a broader spectral response in the red/near-infrared region, and the research is in progress along with the stability test.
