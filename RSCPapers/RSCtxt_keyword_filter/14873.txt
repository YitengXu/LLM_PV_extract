    , Accepted 11th October 2012First published on 11th October 2012AbstractFirst-principles computer simulations can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dye/semiconductor interface lying at the heart of Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs). Here, we present the results of simulation of dye adsorption onto TiO2 surfaces, and of their implications for the functioning of the corresponding solar cells. We propose an integrated strategy which combines FT-IR measurements with DFT calculations to individuate the energetically favorable TiO2 adsorption mode of acetic acid, as a meaningful model for realistic organic dyes. Although we found a sizable variability in the relative stability of the considered adsorption modes with the model system and the method, a bridged bidentate structure was found to closely match the FT-IR frequency pattern, also being calculated as the most stable adsorption mode by calculations in solution. This adsorption mode was found to be the most stable binding also for realistic organic dyes bearing cyanoacrylic anchoring groups, while for a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group, an undissociated monodentate adsorption mode was found to be of comparable stability. The structural differences induced by the different anchoring groups were related to the different electron injection/recombination with oxidized dye properties which were experimentally assessed for the two classes of dyes. A stronger coupling and a possibly faster electron injection were also calculated for the bridged bidentate mode. We then investigated the adsorption mode and I2 binding of prototype organic dyes. Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics and geometry optimizations were performed for two coumarin dyes differing by the length of the π-bridge separating the donor and acceptor moieties. We related the decreasing distance of the carbonylic oxygen from the titania to an increased I2 concentration in proximity of the oxide surface, which might account for the different observed photovoltaic performances. The interplay between theory/simulation and experiments appears to be the key to further DSCs progress, both concerning the design of new dye sensitizers and their interaction with the semiconductor and with the solution environment and/or an electrolyte upon adsorption onto the semiconductor.
1. Introduction
The answer to the growing demand of environmentally sustainable energy resources at the planetary level might lie in the ability to capture and utilize solar energy for a sustainable development on a large scale. In this scenario, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) represent a particularly promising approach to the direct conversion of sunlight into electrical energy at low cost and with high efficiency.1–4
In DSCs, a dye sensitizer absorbs the solar radiation and transfers the photoexcited electron to a wide band-gap semiconductor electrode consisting of a mesoporous oxide layer, usually TiO2, composed of nanometer-sized particles. The charge hole which is concomitantly created in the dye after excited state charge injection is then transferred to a redox couple in a liquid electrolyte or to a solid hole conductor (see Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the charge flow and of the energy levels of a dye-sensitized solar cell. 
Of the three main DSCs constituting materials, i.e. the dye, the semiconductor oxide and the redox shuttle, the chemical nature and structure of the dye is by far the subject which has been more vastly investigated, with a general target of increasing the dye molar extinction coefficient and shifting the dye absorption towards the near-IR region, thus enhancing the overlap between the solar emission and the dye absorption spectrum and eventually achieving higher DSCs photocurrents. A further important sensitizer's feature is the matching of ground and excited state oxidation potentials with the redox shuttle potential and the semiconductor conduction band, respectively.5,6 These energetic requirements rule the DSCs kinetics and are needed to allow for efficient electron injection into the semiconductor manifold of unoccupied states and subsequent regeneration of the oxidized dye.7,8
Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes have been primarily employed as dye sensitizers.9–13 The remarkable performance of the N3 dye,9 of its doubly protonated analogue (N719)10 and of the so-called black dye11,12 had a central role in significantly advancing the DSCs technology, with solar to electric power efficiencies exceeding 11%.10,13 In the last few years, a flourishing family of new generation Ru(II)-dyes have been designed and synthesized to provide higher molar extinction coefficient or peculiar supramolecular interactions compared to N719, thus enhancing the DSCs overall stability and/or efficiency.14–18 Fully organic sensitizers have been developed as metal-free dyes because of their increased molar extinction coefficient, compared to Ru(II)-dyes, spectral tunability and reduced environmental impact.19,20 When employing the most common I−/I3− electrolyte, organic dyes have delivered very high photovoltaic efficiencies, exceeding 10%.21,22 Finally, functionalized donor–acceptor Zn(II)-porphyrins have recently emerged as a new class of sensitizers with high performance potential, due to the extended absorption spectrum in the red, up to near IR region.23–25
From the semiconductor side, TiO2 is essentially established as the most performing metal oxide in DSCs, both in the form of the commonly employed sintered nanoparticles and nanotubes,26,27 although research on alternative oxides such as ZnO and SnO2 is being actively pursued in various laboratories.28–31
The I−/I3− redox couple in an organic solvent has been considered for many years the standard high-performance redox shuttle in DSCs,10,13 even if the field has very recently been revolutionized by Co(II)/Co(III) redox couples, which allowed for demonstration of photovoltaic efficiency close to 13%.25
As mentioned above, the dye sensitizer plays a crucial role in efficient DSCs. Apart from the discussed spectral and energetic requirements, a salient feature of efficient dyes is the presence of suitable functional groups able to strongly bind to the semiconducting oxide surface. The anchoring group should indeed coincide, or be very close, to the dye acceptor moiety, where unoccupied electronic states are spatially confined. This promotes electronic coupling between the donor levels of the excited dye and the delocalized acceptor levels of the semiconductor conduction band, and helps the charge injection process.32–34 Also the orientation and packing of adsorbed dyes on the semiconductor surface strictly depends on the binding motif, possibly affecting the rate and effectiveness of parasitic recombination reactions.35–37 Finally, the sensitizer's anchoring group should provide stable grafting of the dye onto the semiconductor surface, thus leading to long-term device stability.38–40
In an effort to design new and more stable and efficient dyes, it is then clear how fundamental is to disclose the anchoring mode showed by the most commonly employed sensitizers and by the newly designed ones. This understanding could contribute to individuate and optimize many aspects that affect the DSCs performance, such as the solvent used for the sensitization process,41,42 the use of co-adsorbent species,43,44 and the electrolyte composition.45,46 From an experimental standpoint, information on the dye binding modes at the dye-sensitized semiconductor interface are conventionally accessed by vibrational spectroscopy [Fourier Transform Infra Red (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Surface-Enhance Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)].47,48 These techniques can provide structural details about adsorption modes as well as information on the relative orientation shown by surface-adsorbed molecules. Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES) has also been successfully employed to characterize the dye/oxide interface for a series of organic dyes.49–52 The analysis of the PES spectra yields information on the molecular and electronic structures at the interface, along with basic indications of the dye coverage and of the distance of selected atoms from the surface. More recently, X-ray reflectometry has also been employed to unravel the orientation of dye molecules adsorbed onto TiO2 surfaces.53
The anchoring mechanism of the largely employed carboxylic acid group onto the semiconductor surface can be exemplified referring to the coordination modes of the carboxylate fragment (COO−) to metal ions; there are basically three possible coordination modes, i.e. monodentate, chelated and bridged bidentate (see Scheme 2).54 An empirical rule, derived by Deacon and Philips,55 correlates the difference between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies (Δνas) of COO− to the type of coordination. If the measured Δνas for the adsorbed species is larger than that measured for the neat salt, a monodentate coordination is supposed to take place; otherwise if Δνas is similar or smaller than that of the corresponding salt, a chelated or a bridged bidentate adsorption mode is inferred.
 Scheme 2  Graphical representation of the three possible carboxylate bonding modes: (a) monodentate ester-like, (b) bidentate chelating, (c) bidentate bridging. 
Identification of the COO– symmetric and asymmetric vibrational frequencies is usually possible for simple carboxylic acids, but often realistic dyes show a plethora of overlapping absorptions in the 1400–1600 cm−1 range, which hinder identification and/or assignment of the diagnostic carboxylic modes.
Along with experimental studies, computer simulations have contributed to a deeper understanding of the electronic structure and optical properties of new dyes and to unravel the intimate dye–semiconductor interactions characterizing the crucial DSCs heterointerface.56,57 A number of theoretical studies dealing with dye adsorption onto TiO2 have been published, see ref. 58–77 for a list of few representative examples, starting from the pivotal work by Vittadini et al. concerning formic acid adsorption on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface.77 In some cases, calculations showed that for organic dyes bearing a carboxylic acid as an anchoring group, the preferred adsorption mode was bidentate bridging, with one proton transferred to a nearby surface oxygen, while the monodentate anchoring is usually predicted to be less stable, although some dependency of the relative stability of these two anchoring modes on the employed computational methodology has been outlined.76 As a matter of fact, different stabilities can be obtained for the e.g. monodentate or bidentate anchoring modes depending on the employed level of theory.76
To overcome the individual limitations of experimental and computational techniques, here we propose an integrated experimental/computational strategy which combines FT-IR measurements with DFT computer simulations to individuate the most energetically favorable adsorption mode for a carboxylic acid probe, followed by calculation of the IR spectra and structure validation by comparison with experimental data. In particular, we focus on the adsorption of prototypical dyes, exploiting the typical diagnostic symmetric and asymmetric stretching frequencies of the carboxylic group. Considering the complexity of the most efficient organic dyes, we chose the structural simplicity of acetic acid as a meaningful model for realistic organic dyes. Acetic acid, Scheme 2 with R = Me, offers the advantage of having the most commonly employed carboxylic acid group of realistic dyes, coupled to a single methyl group, substantially simplifying the IR spectrum.
In the first part of our paper, we thus investigate, by means of combined FT-IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations the possible anchoring modes onto the TiO2 surface showed by acetic acid. We consider both monodentate and bidentate binding modes, evaluating their relative energies at various levels of theory, along with simulating the IR spectra of the surface adsorbed species. The FT-IR spectra of acetic acid vapors as well as of its partly deuterated analogues (CH3COOD) adsorbed on TiO2 have been measured to build up a correlation between theoretical and experimental data. In the second part of the manuscript, we compare the results obtained for the acetic acid probe in relation to previous results on the adsorption of realistic organic dyes on TiO2 and the implication of the different adsorption modes for DSCs functioning, including injection/recombination kinetics and dye–electrolyte interactions.
2. Models, methods and experimental
2.1 Computational details
The carboxylic group is initially considered to be protonated, as required by the dye solution charge neutrality. The acidic proton can then be either transferred to the oxide surface (both in a bidentate and a monodentate anchoring mode) or be retained on the dye and possibly interact with a surface oxygen via hydrogen-bonding. We considered here two different monodentate binding modes (M1 and M2) and a bridged bidentate (BB) anchoring, see Fig. 1. In M1 the –OH group interacts with a surface oxygen which is not directly bound to the adsorption-involved Ti atom, while in M2 the interaction is instead established with the adjoining surface oxygen, see optimized geometries in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Optimized geometrical structures of the investigated adsorption modes of acetic acid onto the TiO2 surface. 
For the description of the TiO2 semiconductor we used two different approaches, i.e. a cluster and a periodic model. The cluster model has the advantage of allowing for straightforward use of hybrid exchange–correlation functionals and continuum solvation models. The periodic approach allows for a more rigorous description of the surface properties, which is free from finite-size effects. We use two stoichiometric (TiO2)n clusters, with n = 38 and 82, which have been demonstrated to reproduce to a good degree of accuracy the DOS of periodic TiO2 surfaces.67 The two cluster models are used to gauge the stability of the various adsorption modes, allowing for the comparison of hybrid and GGA DFT functionals. We then resort to a (TiO2)32 periodic slab for comparison purposes. It was recently shown that TiO2 anatase slabs having thickness similar to our clusters or periodic models, nicely reproduce the electronic structure of thicker films.69 In all cases, our TiO2 models expose the majority (101) surfaces.

Cluster calculations. 
Geometry optimizations were carried out in the gas phase with the ADF program package78 employing the PBE exchange–correlation functional79 with a TZVP(DZVP) basis set for Ti (H, C, N, O, S). We have also taken into account the solvent role as well as the effect of calculation level on the relative stability of optimized structures by performing single point calculations in the gas phase and in water solution using the B3LYP80 and PBE exchange–correlation functionals together with a large 6-311G** basis set, of comparable quality to that used for geometry optimizations. Solvation effects were taken into account by means of the C-PCM solvation model81 as implemented in Gaussian 03 (G03).82


Periodic calculations. 
Periodic DFT calculations have been carried out within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the PBE exchange–correlation functional. The Car–Parrinello (CP)83 code was used, as implemented in the Quantum-Espresso package.84 Electron–ion interactions were described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials with electrons from O, N and C 2s, 2p; H 1s; and Ti 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s shells explicitly included in the calculations. Plane-wave basis set cutoffs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were 25 and 200 Ry, respectively. The dye molecules were adsorbed on one side only of the slab and the vacuum between the top of the molecules and the adjacent slab was ∼7 Å.

2.2 μ-FTIR measurements
All the experimental spectra were recorded using a μ-FTIR instrument consisting of a JASCO® FTIR 4100 spectrometer, equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector coupled with an IMV-4000 optical microscope. Measurements were performed in the transmission mode (through a Cassegrain 16X objective) on a micro diamond cell, scanning an energy range of 6000–600 cm−1 and with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectra were recorded using 5000 scans; background correction was adopted by means of a spectrum collected on the empty micro diamond cell. TiO2, CH3COOH and CH3COOD with purity >99.5% were all purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Three samples of TiO2 powder were heated for 1 h at 500 °C. They were then put in contact, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with vapours of pure AcOH, d4-AcOH and AcOD respectively. After 20 h a μ-FTIR spectrum of each sample was recorded directly on powders.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Acetic acid on TiO2
Acetic acid (AcOH) vapors were adsorbed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (the standard temperature and pressure conditions in which DSCs are normally assembled) onto a pre-heated (500 °C) titania (anatase) nanopowder. After 20 h exposure a μ-FT-IR spectrum was recorded, as shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  μ-FTIR spectra of AcOH (red) and AcOD (blue) vapors adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. 
In the recorded AcOH spectrum, the main signals recognizable in the wavenumber range of COO– adsorption (apart from that of residual water at 1630 cm−1) are due to the asymmetric and symmetric carboxylate stretchings as well as to methyl group modes (see Table 1).

The frequencies experimentally found for AcOH are referred in the literature85 to be characteristic of bidentate species, with the bands at 1558 and 1424 cm−1 due to asymmetrical and symmetrical COO– stretching, respectively. While a large consensus supports the asymmetrical carboxylate stretching assignment, the signal at 1430 cm−1 is in some cases86 referred to δCH3 vibrations (1420–1412 cm−1), whereas other authors85 assigned this wavenumber range (1433–1426 cm−1) to the symmetric carboxylate stretching.
To possibly elucidate the involvement of the carboxyl proton in binding to TiO2 (e.g. in M1 or M2 structures) we repeated the experiment with the monodeuterated acetic acid CH3COOD (AcOD) as an adsorber. The measured IR spectrum (Fig. 2) essentially overlaps with the one already seen for acetic acid. Both the asymmetric and symmetric carboxylate stretchings remain localized at the same wavenumbers of AcOH and so does the signal at about 1330 cm−1. Such similarity between AcOH and AcOD suggests that probably no H (or D) belonging to acidic OH (or OD) groups is directly interacting with the surface-adsorbed carboxylic group, as would be the case for M1 and M2.
For the interacting AcOH/TiO2 system, we then calculated the optimized geometries and the relative energies of the M1, M2 and BB adsorption modes, see Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3. Different calculation levels were employed and the effect of water solvent on the adsorption stability was also taken into account on the geometries optimized in vacuo. Considering the PBE/DZ(TZ)VP level used for geometry optimization on the cluster-adsorbed systems, at least two structures should be taken into account in terms of relative energy, i.e. BB and M2. Our data suggest M2 to be the most stable structure, as previously found for acetic acid adsorption on the (110) TiO2 surface in ref. 87. On the same (ADF) optimized cluster geometries, the relative stabilities calculated by the PBE functional by ADF, CP and G03 programs in vacuo are totally consistent, despite the different basis sets (Slater, Gaussian and Plane Waves), showing a similar description of the dye–TiO2 interaction by all such computational approaches. M2 is predicted to be the most stable structure, with BB lying very close in energy and M1 much higher. B3LYP data in vacuo are consistent with the corresponding PBE data, suggesting a marginal effect of the functional. Moving to the water solution environment (ε ∼ 78) leads BB to be calculated as the most stable structure both with B3LYP and PBE, with M2 and M1 lying, respectively, 1.3 (1.4) and 6.5 (4.2) kcal mol−1 higher in energy with the B3LYP (PBE) functional. Our results are in line with previous calculations, showing a sizable sensitivity of the most stable adsorption mode for carboxylic acids and organic dyes onto the (101) TiO2 surface to the presence of explicit solvent (water or acetonitrile) molecules.76,88,89

Surprisingly, a totally different stability order is calculated if one considers the CP optimized geometries, employing a PBC TiO2 description (PBE/PWs entries in Table 2), which shows the M1 adsorption mode to be the most stable structure, in line with the results of Vittadini et al. on the prototype formic acid system.77 As it can be noticed, slightly different geometries are calculated for cluster and periodic approaches, see Table 3, although the differences seem to be quite small (except the OH distances in M2) to explain the substantial effect on the stability order. We have no further data to comment on this marked difference but, based on the similarity of the energetics by CP, ADF and G03 at fixed geometry, we speculate that this effect might be due to a different description of proton interactions with the TiO2 surface by the CP method rather than by a cluster vs. periodic TiO2 difference.76
This seems to be confirmed by the different M2 structures calculated by the ADF and the CP code, whereby ADF predicts the proton to be transferred to the surface while CP retains it on the dye (notice the different O1–H and H–O3/4 distances in Table 3).
Considering the large variability of computed stabilities with the employed geometry optimization method and since based on the relative energies alone it was not possible to clearly discriminate among the possible AcOH adsorption modes (the inherent accuracy of most DFT methods is comparable to some of the calculated energy differences), for each of the considered structures, we calculated the IR vibrational frequencies at the same PBE/DZ(TZ)VP level of theory used for geometry optimization. A summary of the main IR peaks and their assignment is reported in Table 4, while in Fig. 3 we report a comparison between the experimental and calculated spectra for BB, M1 and M2.

 Fig. 3  Comparison between the experimental (red) and calculated (blue) IR spectra of AcOH on TiO2 for the BB, M1 and M2 adsorption modes. The calculated spectra have been rescaled so that the high energy features have the same intensity as the experimental band at 1558 cm−1. 
Looking at the calculated frequencies, the BB adsorption mode well reproduces the three main spectral features, showing three intense signals at 1543, 1432 and 1351 cm−1, to be compared to experimental signatures at 1558, 1435 and 1340 cm−1, respectively. The assignment of the 1543 cm−1 feature to the asymmetric COO– stretching is straightforward, while the two modes calculated at 1432 and 1351 cm−1 result from the admixture of the symmetric COO– stretching and of the δCH3 mode. Thus a clear assignment of these two features cannot be made, also considering their inverted intensity pattern compared to the experiment. We note, however, that the separation between the asymmetric and symmetric COO stretching found experimentally is 138 cm−1, reasonably comparing with the 111 cm−1 difference found between the asymmetric stretching and the band of mixed character calculated at 1432 cm−1.
Based on the comparison between the experimental and simulated IR spectra, Fig. 3, the presence of the monodentate species M1 and M2 (either dissociated or undissociated) can be ruled out, due to the significant discrepancies found in their IR spectra compared to the experimental data. The experimental spectra show no trace of peaks of the characteristic carbonyl stretching belonging to the M2 adsorption mode (∼1760 cm−1). For M1 the feature at ∼1550 cm−1 is missing and a new feature at ca. 1250 cm−1 appears, which is not found experimentally. So even if the carbonyl stretching (1614 cm−1) was overlapping with the residual water peak (1630 cm−1) this mode can be excluded. It has to be noted that frequency assignment in these two cases is further complicated by the admixture of several modes, including OH modes, so that for M1 and M2 the mode assignments in Table 2 should be taken with some care, although the listed frequencies are those displaying highest intensity in the investigated energy range.
Summarizing, our combined experimental and computational modeling of acetic acid adsorption on TiO2 points at the BB structure as the most likely AcOH adsorption mode, consistent with the calculated energetics in solution.
3.2 Organic dyes on TiO2: electron injection and recombination with the oxidized dye
As mentioned above, investigating the possible anchoring modes of dye sensitizers to the TiO2 surface is of crucial importance as the bonding type and the extent of electronic coupling between the dye excited state and the semiconductor unoccupied states can directly influence the cell performances. An emblematic case is represented by the D5L2A190,91 and D5L2A350 dyes, which we recently investigated.37 The two dyes only differ in the anchoring unit, namely a conjugated cyanoacrylic acid in the former and non-conjugated rhodanine-3-acetic acid in the latter (see molecular structures in Fig. 4). The loss of electron conjugation between the donor-linker moiety and the anchoring –COOH group passing from the cyanoacrylic to the rhodanine-3-acetic acid was related to the drastic drop in the photovoltaic efficiency of D5L2A3 (∼2%)50 compared to D5L2A1 (∼6%).90,91 Wiberg et al.92 reported that the two different sensitizers showed unitary electron injection efficiency but substantially different rates of charge recombination between the photo-injected electrons and the oxidized dye, with estimated losses of 80% and 50% of injected electrons for D5L2A3 and D5L2A1, respectively, within 1.4 ns.92
 Fig. 4  Molecular structures of L0, rh-L0, D5L2A1 and D5L2A3. 
Recombination between TiO2-injected electrons and the oxidized dye or the electrolyte directly influences the charge density into the semiconductor and thus the open-circuit voltage of the cell. By definition, at open circuit the flux of the injected electrons equals that of the recombining electrons, fixing the Fermi level and thus the output voltage of the device. The Fermi level is determined by the CB edge potential and by the electron density into the TiO2, n, which is in turn proportional to the rate of the electron injection and to the electron lifetime, τ, namely the average time spent by the injected electrons into the TiO2 CB. Low electron lifetime values, due to high recombination rates, therefore determine low Voc values.
We investigated the possible anchoring modes onto the TiO2 surface of the two representative L0 and rh-L0 organic dyes,50,93 considering both monodentate and bidentate binding. The optimized geometries are reported in Fig. 5, while relative energies of BB, M1 and M2 adsorption modes are reported in Table 5. The data in Table 5 follow the trend outlined above for acetic acid adsorption, whereby at the PBE/DZ(TZ)VP/vac level of theory, M2 is slightly more stable, by 1.5 kcal mol−1, than the bidentate structure, BB, while the M1 adsorption mode seems to be strongly destabilized (ca. +10 kcal mol−1) with respect to BB. Single point calculations on the optimized structures in water solution, however, always indicate the bidentate configuration as the preferred one, giving the stability ordering BB > M2 > M1. Although all the three investigated structures would be compatible with the PES data for the related D5L2A1 dye,49 which indicates that the molecule lies with the donor (TPA) group pointing out from the surface and the acceptor CN group close to the TiO2, our calculated stabilities are suggestive of a bidentate coordination mode for L0 and analogous dyes bearing a cyanoacrylic anchoring group.65

Similar remarks can be made for rh-L0: at the PBE/DZ(TZ)VP/vac level of optimization, the bidentate structure is the most stable adsorption mode. Although small energy differences are calculated at some levels of theory, these data indicate on overall that also for this type of dyes the bidentate coordination is favored, and therefore we conclude that rh-L0 as well as the related D149 and D10236 dyes lie almost flat with an inclination of about 45 degrees with respect to the TiO2 plane, as also found in previous works.94,95
Differences in the recombination kinetics between TiO2-injected electrons and the dye cations are strongly dependent, upon other factors, from the spatial separation of the charge hole localized on the oxidized dye, which can be assimilated to the HOMO of the neutral dye, and the TiO2 surface. We recall indeed that the electronic coupling between the donor (TiO2) and acceptor (oxidized dye) states can be represented in terms of an exponential function of the spatial separation r between the donor and the acceptor. Considering the calculated different orientation of the L0 and rh-L0 dyes with respect to the TiO2 surface, determined by the different anchoring unit, and recalling that the dye HOMOs are mainly localized on the donor groups, a different spatial separation between the dye donor groups and the TiO2 surfaces can be outlined for L0 and rh-L0. Looking at the more stable BB structures reported in Fig. 5, the dye donor group/TiO2 distance can be roughly estimated to be 8–10 Å for L0 and 6–8 Å for the rh-L0 dye. By extrapolating these data for the longer D5L2A1 and D5L2A3 dyes examined by Wiberg et al.,92 we calculate a dye donor group/TiO2 separation of 14–16 Å and 9–11 Å for the two dyes, respectively. These data are consistent with the measured differences in the recombination rates, whereby a closer proximity of the charge hole localized on the dye to the semiconductor surface would lead to higher recombination rates. Our model is also in agreement with recent data by Long et al.,96 which showed an increased recombination rate between injected electrons and the oxidized sensitizer for the D205 dye, bearing the rhodanine-3-acetic acid, compared to the C218 dye, having a cyanoacrylic acid group.
It is also interesting to exploit our data for the L0 dye to check whether the specific dye adsorption mode, i.e. bridged bidentate vs. monodentate (e.g. BB vs. M1) can induce differences in the electronic coupling between the dye excited state (approximated here by the dye LUMO) and the TiO2 manifold of unoccupied states.61 We thus calculated the partial density of dye unoccupied states (PDOS) for the interacting BB and M1 adsorption modes of the L0 dye. We recall that according to the Newns–Anderson model, the entity of the dye LUMO broadening when interacting with the semiconductor is an estimate of the intervening electronic coupling.75,97 The results, reported in Fig. 6, clearly show a larger broadening (and asymmetry) for the L0 dye LUMO PDOS adsorbed in the BB than in the M1 mode.
 Fig. 6  Top: partial density of states (PDOS) calculated for the L0 dye LUMO anchored to TiO2 in a BB (blue) and M1 (red) adsorption modes. Bottom: Lorentzian broadening of the dye LUMO PDOS. 
The dye LUMO broadening, estimated as the full width at half maximum of the Lorentzian distributions75 reported at the bottom of Fig. 6, is ca. 0.05 eV larger for the BB than for the M1 adsorption mode, reflecting the stronger dye–semiconductor interaction characteristic of the BB structure.70
3.3 Effect of the dye adsorption mode: recombination with the electrolyte
Recombination between TiO2-injected electrons and oxidized species in the electrolyte is a main loss channel in DSCs, leading to reduced Voc values.98 Despite the accepted knowledge that the adsorbed dyes act as an isolating layer, keeping the reduced electrolyte far from the direct contact with the oxide surface,99–101 some authors102–106 suggested that particular atoms or chemical groups can also provide binding sites for I2 (I3−), increasing its concentration close to the TiO2 surface and thus accelerating the recombination process. Evidence of stable Ru-complex–I2 adducts has been reported by Tuikka et al.,106 which isolated N3–I2 crystals. O'Regan et al.102 found that the replacement of two oxygen ligand atoms with two sulfur atoms in a Ru(II)-dye caused a 2-fold increase in the recombination rate. This was ascribed to the stronger tendency of ethylthioether compared to ethylether to bind I2. An extensive investigation on the effects of dye molecular structure and electrolyte composition on the recombination dynamics has been reported by Miyashita et al.,103 who examined the photovoltaic performances of a series of organic- and Ru(II)-dyes. These authors consistently found lower electron lifetimes for the metal-free based DSCs compared to those employing Ru dyes. The lower Voc values were interpreted as arising from an increased I3− concentration in the proximity of the oxide surface yielding higher recombination rates. Interestingly, among the organic sensitizers, those having alkyl chains and larger molecular size showed longer lifetimes, possibly due to the formation of a compact aggregate layer able to protect the TiO2 surface from the I3− approach.
Various computational investigations on dye–electrolyte interactions were recently reported,107–113 including a time-domain ab initio study of charge relaxation and recombination in dye-sensitized TiO2 by Prezhdo and coworkers.114 To contribute to the understanding of dye–electrolyte interactions, we recently investigated the adsorption mode of various prototype organic dyes on TiO2, along with I2 binding to the various electron-donating sites in the molecule. This was done for a representative group of sensitizers, selected among those examined by Miyashita et al.103 Here we discuss results for two coumarin dyes (NKX2587 and NKX2697), which differ by the number of thiophene rings in the bridge (one and three, respectively), see Fig. 7. In a recent work,104 we have shown that in the case of two organic dyes containing, respectively, one and two ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) moieties, the O–I2 interaction is slightly stronger than the S–I2 one and that, in any case, both sites might effectively bind iodine, thus accounting for the accelerated recombination rate measured for the dye bearing two EDOT groups. This was recently confirmed for the dyes investigated here, indicating the oxygen atoms as the preferred binding sites for I2. Moreover carbonylic or carboxylic oxygens can also bind positive ions present in the electrolyte solution, such as Li+, thus favoring the electrostatic interaction between triiodide anions and the dye. The formation of dye–I2 or dye–I3− complexes in proximity of the TiO2 surface can play a crucial role in determining the short lifetimes measured for certain organic dyes containing oxygen atoms in the donor and bridge units.104
 Fig. 7  Optimized structures of NKX2587 and NKX2697 adducts with I2. 
Having established the affinity of sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the standalone dyes to bind I2, we moved to model the dye/semiconductor interface, with relation to the anchoring modes of the dyes and the effective distances of the iodine from the TiO2 surface. We thus carried out a Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation on the NKX2587 dye adsorbed onto the (TiO2)82 cluster in vacuo, starting with the preferred dissociative bridged bidentate adsorption mode and thermalizing the system at 350 K. We notice that the presence of explicit solvation could possibly alter the adsorbed dye dynamics.59 Also the rather short simulation time (4.5 ps) is not sufficient to capture possible slow dye rearrangements but we believe this time slice to be sufficient to locally sample the potential energy surface around the calculated minimum energy structure. Our results showed that the BB adsorption mode was maintained throughout the simulation time, and that the dye remained on average perpendicular to the TiO2 surface, without significant geometrical distortions with respect to the optimized adsorption geometry at 0 K. Hence no significant change in the average distance of the I2 binding sites from the surface was observed compared to the optimized geometry. As shown in Fig. 8, the variation in the distance of the carbonylic oxygen from the surface during simulation time of 4.5 ps is about 1 Å, going from a minimum value of 9.7 to a maximum of 10.8 Å, with an average value of 10.4 Å.
 Fig. 8  Distance (in Å) of the carbonylic oxygen from the TiO2 surface against the simulation time for the NKX2587@(TiO2)38 system. The average distance (in blue) and the maximum and minimum values (in red) are also reported. 
We also optimized the structure of the O–I2 adduct of TiO2-adsorbed NKX2587 and, as displayed in Fig. 9, this structure shows negligible geometrical rearrangements of the O–I2 configuration due to the presence of the substrate: the O–I distance is predicted to be 2.85 Å compared to the value of 2.84 Å reported in Table 1, the C–I–O angle increases from 120° to ca. 150° and the distance from the surface is about 10 Å, as predicted by the Car–Parrinello dynamics.

Therefore, a reasonable approximation of the average distance of the bonded I2 from the surface oxide can be obtained by taking the distances from the TiO2 cluster of the various I2 binding sites in the dye@TiO2 optimized structures at 0 K (Fig. 9). The distance of the I2 possibly bonded by the CN group is about 5 Å, while the carbonylic oxygens, which are the predominant binding sites, lie at ca. 10 and 16 Å from the titania in NKX2587@TiO2 and NKX2696@TiO2 respectively. The sulfur atoms in NKX2697 are at about 8, 11 and 14 Å from the TiO2. The data by Miyashita et al.103 showed that the NKX2587 sensitized cells had shorter lifetime than those based on NKX2697. The increase in the distance of the preferred carbonylic oxygen from the titania going from NKX2587@TiO2 (≈10 Å) to NKX2697 (≈16 Å) and hence the increased I2 concentration in proximity of the oxide surface might account for the differences in the lifetime values measured in ref. 103 for NKX2587-sensitized solar cells compared to those employing the longer NKX2697 homologous.
4. Conclusions
We have presented a survey of new and recently published results obtained in the first principles computer simulation of dye adsorption onto TiO2 surfaces, as models of the heterointerface crucial to the functioning of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). First-principles simulations have contributed to a deeper understanding of the electronic structure and optical properties of new dyes and to unravel the intimate dye/semiconductor interactions characterizing the DSCs functioning, possibly contributing to the further development of this important class of photovoltaic devices.
The dye sensitizer plays a crucial role in efficient DSCs; a stringent dye characteristic is the presence of suitable anchoring groups which should provide effective dye adsorption onto the semiconducting oxide surface. The dye anchoring group promotes electronic coupling between the donor levels of the excited dye and the delocalized acceptor levels of the semiconductor conduction band, and mediates charge injection. Also the orientation and packing of adsorbed dyes on the semiconductor surface strictly depends on the binding motif, possibly affecting the rate and effectiveness of parasitic recombination reactions. Finally, the sensitizer's anchoring group should provide stable grafting of the dye onto the semiconductor surface, thus leading to long-term device stability. Understanding the dye adsorption mode onto the semiconductor surfaces could thus contribute to individuate and optimize many aspects that affect the DSCs performance.
A number of theoretical studies dealing with the adsorption mode of the most commonly employed carboxylic acid groups onto TiO2 have been reported to provide such understanding. In some cases, the preferred adsorption mode was bidentate bridging, with one proton transferred to a nearby surface oxygen, while in other cases a monodentate (either dissociative or undissociated) anchoring was predicted to be favored. Some dependency of the relative stability of these two anchoring modes on the employed computational method and the model was however outlined, which did not allow a conclusive assignment of the biding motif exhibited by the most performing dyes.
From a different perspective, experimental techniques usually employed to probe dye surface adsorption (FT-IR, SERS, PES and X-rays scattering) are often not sufficient to unravel the atomistic details of the dye–semiconductor binding. As an example, FT-IR spectroscopy, which is largely employed to probe the adsorption mode of carboxylic acids on metal oxide surfaces, usually has to deal with an envelop of overlapping bands in the diagnostic region of the asymmetric and symmetric carboxylic stretchings which does not allow a clear distinction of such bands, thus of the dye adsorption mode.
To overcome the individual limitations of experimental and computational techniques, here we propose an integrated experimental/computational strategy which combines FT-IR measurements with DFT first principles simulations to individuate the most energetically favorable adsorption mode for a carboxylic acid probe, followed by calculation of the IR spectra and structure validation by comparison with experimental data. Considering the complexity of the most efficient organic dyes, we chose the structural simplicity of acetic acid as a meaningful model for realistic organic dyes.
We considered a dissociative bridged bidentate and two monodentate adsorption modes (either dissociative or non-dissociative), and calculated their relative stability with various models and at various levels of theory. As anticipated, we found a sizable variability in the relative stability of the three adsorption modes with the model/method, which did not alone allow us to trace clear conclusions concerning the favored adsorption mode. We thus measured the FT-IR spectra of AcOH adsorbed on TiO2 nano-powders and calculated the vibrational IR frequencies for the three representative adsorption modes. By comparing the two data sets we identified the bridged bidentate adsorption mode as the one which most closely matches the FT-IR frequency pattern, also being calculated (although by a few kcal mol−1 only) as the most stable adsorption mode by cluster calculations in solution.
We then compared the results of the present investigation to previous data from our lab, obtained for realistic dye sensitizers. Interestingly, the bridged bidentate adsorption mode was found to be the most stable binding motif also for organic dyes bearing cyanoacrylic anchoring groups, while in the case of a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring groups, an undissociated monodentate adsorption mode was found to be of almost comparable stability. The two different cyanoacrylic and rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring groups were found to induce a totally different dye packing on the TiO2 surface, with dye molecules standing up or lying almost flat compared to the TiO2 surface, respectively. These structural differences were related to the different electron injection/recombination with oxidized dye properties which were experimentally assessed for the two classes of dyes. Furthermore, considering the cyanoacrylic anchoring mode, a stronger coupling between the dye LUMO and the TiO2 manifold of unoccupied states was calculated for the bridged bidentate than for the monodentate adsorption mode, suggesting a possibly faster electron injection from the dyes anchored in the bridged bidentate mode.
To contribute to the understanding of dye–electrolyte interactions, we investigated the adsorption mode of various prototype organic dyes on TiO2, along with I2 binding to the various electron-donating sites in the molecule. We found that oxygen-containing groups in the dyes (either EDOT or carbonyl groups) may constitute sites for I2 binding, thus accounting for the accelerated recombination rate measured for the dye bearing such groups. By performing combined Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics and structural geometry optimizations for two coumarin dyes adsorbed onto TiO2, differing by the length of the π-bridge separating the donor and acceptor moieties, we were able to relate the decreasing distance of the preferred carbonylic oxygen from the titania to an increased I2 concentration in proximity of the oxide surface, which might account for the differences in the electron lifetime values measured for DSCs based on the shorter dye.
In conclusion, we believe that computer simulations based on a first principles description of dye adsorption modes onto semiconductor oxides, lying at the heart of DSCs, represent a powerful tool for unravelling the atomistic feature of the crucial DSCs interface. This in turn may allow for a detailed understanding of the factors affecting the efficiency of the basic charge generations/recombination processes, possibly leading to improved DSCs photovoltaic performances.
The interplay between theory/simulation and experiments appears key, in our view, to further DSCs progress, both concerning the design of new dye sensitizers and the understanding of the sensitizers' interaction with the semiconductor and with the solution environment and/or the electrolyte upon being adsorbed onto the semiconductor.
