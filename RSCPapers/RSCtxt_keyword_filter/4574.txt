    , Accepted 3rd July 2022First published on 4th July 2022AbstractA chemically robust and high-performance cathode interlayer material is imperative to further improve non-fullerene binary organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies. Two bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-containing small molecules (NDI-EA and PDI-EA) are synthesized via a one-step condensation reaction between electron-deficient conjugated cores (i.e., perylene-diimide and naphthalene-diimide building blocks) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino terminal groups. The bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups serve as multi-modification sites to functionalize PDI-EA, enabling significant lowering of the work functions of cathode surfaces, remarkable electron conductivities, and excellent cathode/interlayer contact. In combination, these markedly enhance the photovoltaic properties. Upon modification by PDI-EA, PM6:Y6-based OSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%, and PM6:L8-BO-based OSCs give a PCE as high as 18.50%, among the highest values for binary organic photovoltaics. This material overcomes a key bottleneck in the use of the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group in non-fullerene bulk heterojunction systems and uncovers the powerful use as multi-site functional cathode interlayers to enhance binary photoelectronic performances.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as promising energy-harvesting devices for flexible, low-cost, and large-scale applications due to the great progress made in active layer materials, especially the breakthrough in non-fullerene acceptor materials.1–5 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of binary OSCs still lag behind those of other OSCs where most efficiencies of >18% have been achieved with multicomponent active layers.6–15 These multicomponent active layers, however, require exacting processing conditions that limit their utility in scaled-up fabrication.16 It is highly desirable to take advantage of the simplicity of binary OSCs by developing more efficient interlayer materials to align energy levels and enhance charge extraction and transport at the electrode/active layer interface.7,17,18
The chemical composition of cathode interlayer materials usually involves polarized or even charged functional groups. Appropriate functional groups enable fine tuning of the energy level alignment through molecular dipole moments or/and interaction with metal electrodes and also enable reducing contact resistances through interfacial doping.19–23 In this regard, simultaneously integrating various functional groups within one compound as modification sites (multi-site modification) could develop more efficient cathode interlayer materials to boost the performances of binary OSCs. However, the design of a simple but efficient cathode interlayer material with several modification groups is challenging. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amine intrinsically features multiple modification sites of the tertiary amine and hydroxide units and has a strong molecular polarity and an electron-donating tendency and has been extensively used as a critical electrode modifier in organic electronics.24–29 However, it is rarely used as a cathode interlayer material for non-fullerene OSCs, since the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-containing polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) was found to react with non-fullerene acceptors and lead to S-shaped current density–voltage (J–V) curves.30,31 While these unfavourable device performances were avoided by replacing or protonating the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group,31,32 it is still unclear whether bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups are responsible for the degradation of non-fullerene OSCs.
In this contribution, two bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino functionalized perylene diimide (PDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives (namely PDI-EA and NDI-EA) were used as multi-site functional cathode interlayer materials and were synthesized by a simple condensation reaction. We find that the non-ideal J–V curves of non-fullerene OSCs have little connection to the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups. By stark contrast, benefitting from the chemical stability, molecular polarity, and electron-rich nature of multi-site bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups, PDI-EA dramatically reduces the work function (WF) of Ag, exhibits a strong self-doping effect, and buffers electrode/active layer interfaces. Well-aligned energy levels, high electron conductivities, and excellent contacts are observed in devices containing PDI-EA. Besides, PDI-EA thin films have highly ordered intermolecular packing, but the surfaces are smooth. Resultantly, PDI-EA is found to efficiently suppress excitation recombination and enhance electron collection and transport inside OSCs, leading to record PCE values for binary non-fullerene OSCs: 18.04% for PM6:Y6 blends and 18.50% for PM6:L8-BO blends, which are among the highest for the PM6:Y6-based OSCs and non-fullerene binary OSCs, respectively. This work provides a unique molecular design perspective for achieving high-performance interlayer materials.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material syntheses
Shown in Fig. 1 are the syntheses of (N,N′-diethanolamino)propyl perylene diimide (PDI-EA) and (N,N′-diethanolamino)propyl naphthalene diimide (NDI-EA). By combining bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino functional groups with electron deficient π-conjugated structures, PDI-EA and NDI-EA can be prepared by simple one-step condensation reactions, where N-(3-aminopropyl)diethanolamine reacts with 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under a N2 atmosphere at 90 °C for 15 h, respectively. This simple chemical reaction gives PDI-EA at low-cost ($2.75 g−1, see in Table S1, ESI†)33,34 and in high yield (90%), underscoring the ease of use for industrial batch production. The chemical structures for PDI-EA and NDI-EA were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (ESI, Fig. S1, S2, S4 and S5†), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (ESI, Fig. S3 and S6†). Both PDI-EA and NDI-EA are highly soluble in alcohol-based solvents with concentrations exceeding 50 mg mL−1, orthogonal to the underlying semiconductor active layers, enabling robust multi-layered device fabrication. The thermal stability of PDI-EA and NDI-EA was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss for PDI-EA and NDI-EA are ∼274.0 °C for PDI-EA and ∼268.1 °C for NDI-EA (Fig. S7†). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) confirmed that PDI-EA had a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level than NDI-EA (−4.03 eV vs. −3.65 eV) and that PDI-EA has a better electron-extraction ability as an interlayer in organic electronics (energy level values are summarized in Fig. S8 and Table S2†).

2.2 Photovoltaic performances
Typical PM6:Y6 active layers (Fig. S9†) were selected to investigate the compatibility of these bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derivatives with binary non-fullerene OSCs. Ever since PM6:Y6 blends were first reported with the maximum PCE of 15.7%,35 they have become the representative non-fullerene bulk heterojunction active layer to examine device fabrication,36,37 active layer optimization,38–40 and interface engineering strategies.7,17PDI-EA and NDI-EA combined with PM6:Y6-based binary OSCs in a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:Y6/cathode interlayer/electrode (Fig. S9, ESI†). The device fabrication procedures are described in the experimental section (ESI†). The thicknesses of both PDI-EA and NDI-EA were optimized to be ∼10 nm. The resultant current density–voltage curves for devices modified by two small molecules are compared in Fig. 2a, and the photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. OSCs containing NDI-EA achieved a PCE of 17.62%, while those with PDI-EA modification further achieved device efficiencies of up to 18.04%, the maximum value for PM6:Y6 based OSCs to date. While PDI-EA and NDI-EA-based OSCs show a comparable open-circuit voltage (VOC) at 0.87 ± 0.01 V, the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values remarkably increase from 26.45 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 and 76.56 ± 0.30% for NDI-EA-based devices to 26.65 ± 0.13 mA cm−2 and 77.61 ± 0.19% for PDI-EA-based devices. To confirm the JSC measured from the J–V curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE) data (Fig. 2b) were obtained with an integrated J of 26.50 mA cm−2 for PDI-EA and 26.12 mA cm−2 for NDI-EA-based OSCs, respectively, in good agreement with the optimal JSC to within a 1% error. When we further applied PDI-EA to modify OSCs with a PM6:L8-BO active layer, a record efficiency of 18.50% was obtained, with an enhanced VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 26.49 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.92% (Table 1). This efficiency is among the highest values for binary organic solar cells, compared to the recent progress in non-fullerene OSCs based on cathode interlayers (Table S3†). The EQE spectrum also showed excellent agreement of the integrated J with the JSC (<1% error, as shown in Fig. 2d). Thus, unlike previously reported PEIE derivatives that have unfavourable effects on non-fullerene OSCs,30,31PDI-EA and NDI-EA are promising bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-containing cathode interlayers to advance electron extraction and transport for high-performance non-fullerene OSCs.

The sensitivity of cathode interlayer thickness in PM6:Y6 binary OSCs was investigated as shown in ESI Fig. S10,† since this is crucial for large-area processing. The photovoltaic performances show excellent tolerance to the thickness of both PDI-EA and NDI-EA over the range from 10 to 38 nm. Even though the cathode interlayer thickness increased to 29 nm, only a small change in the PCE was observed with the maximum/average efficiencies of 17.61%/17.62 ± 0.06% for PDI-EA-based OSCs and 17.39%/17.28 ± 0.10% for NDI-EA-based OSCs. The efficiencies using either cathode interlayer material still maintained high values exceeding 17.20% when the thickness increases to 36–38 nm (as shown in Table S4, ESI†), particularly for PDI-EA with the maximum value of 17.47% at 36 nm. This exceptional thickness tolerance suggests that the insertion of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups into conjugated electron-withdrawing cores dramatically enhances the charge transport efficiency of non-fullerene OSCs.
In-depth evaluation of the dark current and charge recombination behavior were performed to understand the relationship between cathode interlayers and device performances. Shown in Fig. 3a are the J–V characteristics of devices containing PDI-EA or NDI-EA in the dark. With respect to NDI-EA, the PDI-EA modification yielded PM6:Y6 binary OSCs with a higher rectification ratio as well as a lower saturation current, indicative of a better diode characteristic, because the larger build-in field results in a more suppressed charge recombination, which is consistent with the higher VOC and FF in PDI-EA-based devices.41 The dependence of the JSC and VOC on light intensity (P) was evaluated to investigate the charge-carrier recombination of the solar cell devices (Fig. 3b). From the plots of log JSCvs. logPα, α values of 0.981 and 0.964 were found for the PDI-EA and NDI-EA-based devices, respectively. With α closer to 1 in devices containing PDI-EA, bimolecular recombination is more suppressed.42 The slopes determined from the plots of VOCvs. logP are 1.27kT/q and 1.43kT/q for PDI-EA and NDI-EA-based devices, respectively. The slope for PDI-EA is closer to kT/q, suggesting that trap-assisted recombination is also limited in devices containing PDI-EA interlayers.43 In addition, device surface resistances were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at VOC bias in the dark (Fig. S11†). By fitting with the equivalent-circuit model, surface resistances for the PDI-EA and NDI-EA-modified devices of 30 Ω and 32 Ω, respectively, were found. The lower surface resistance suggests a restrained interfacial charge recombination and enhanced charge extraction for PDI-EA-based OSCs. To conclude, PDI-EA-based devices surpassed NDI-EA-based devices with more power of reducing charge recombination of the devices, in keeping with the resultant higher FF of PDI-EA-based OSCs.

2.3 Functionalities based on cathode interlayers
Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino terminal groups intrinsically have a strong molecular polarity and therefore are expected to generate interfacial dipoles and reduce metal WFs. As evidenced by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) (Fig. S12, ESI†), the Ag WFs decreased from 4.47 eV to 3.82 eV and 3.98 eV upon the modification with PDI-EA and NDI-EA, respectively. A similar effect on WF modification is also observed by scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) tests over a large area of 1 × 1 cm2 with WF reductions of up to 0.84 ± 0.01 eV for PDI-EA/Ag and 0.52 ± 0.01 eV for NDI-EA/Ag in air (Fig. 4a). The larger WF reduction for PDI-EA/Ag agrees well with the observed higher JSC and FF in PDI-EA-based devices, indicative of stronger interactions between the multi-site functional groups and Ag electrodes.27 The larger interfacial dipole induced by PDI-EA might be because of the more ordered interfacial dipole moments, as evidenced by the following grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) patterns, where PDI-EA and NDI-EA thin films showed the edge-on and random molecular orientations, respectively. In addition to traditional amine groups, hydroxide groups also act as functional sites to reduce WFs of Ag electrodes, as evidenced by a comparison of the SKP results for PDI-EA and PDIN (Fig. S13†). After removing the hydroxide groups, the WF reduction of a PDIN-treated Ag electrode is measured to be 0.62 ± 0.01 eV, which is lower than that of PDI-EA/Ag. Upon increasing the thickness of these cathode interlayers from 10 to 38 nm, variations in the Ag WF are negligible (to within ±0.10 eV error, see Fig. S14 and Table S5 in the ESI†), which agree well with the stable VOC values. As a result, PDI-EA and NDI-EA are efficient cathode interlayer materials to produce uniformly low WF surfaces over large areas, affording devices with large build-in potentials, overcoming energy barriers for efficient electron transport.

To evaluate the influence of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derivatives on charge transport, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were performed using electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/Y6/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derivatives/Ag. As shown in Fig. S15,† the electron mobilities are calculated to be 1.57 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Y6/PDI-EA and 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Y6/NDI-EA. Electron mobilities for both small molecule-modified devices remain in an order of magnitude of 10−3, since several hydroxyethyl groups also function as doping sites in addition to traditional tertiary amine groups, as evidenced by the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal for PDI-OH (Fig. S16†), collectively affording enhanced self-doping effects, as shown in Fig. 4b. PDI-EA solid powder exhibits a strong ESR signal at a g value of 2.0000, and the equivalent NDI-EA solid power exhibits a relatively weak ESR signal at a g value of 2.0000, indicating stronger self-doping effects due to stronger electron transfer from the amine terminal groups to the conjugated core in PDI-EA with the lower LUMO energy level. Moreover, electrical conductivities of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derived thin films were measured on glass substrates with Ag interdigitated electrodes (channel width/length of 1300/50 μm) (Fig. 4c). With respect to NDI-EA thin films (electron conductivity of 1.51 × 10−3 S cm−1), a higher electron conductivity of 8.36 × 10−3 S cm−1 was found for PDI-EA-based devices, consistent with the SCLC results. Therefore, n-doping cathode modifiers with bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups efficiently diminish contact resistance, affording a high JSC in OSCs, especially for devices containing PDI-EA.
Notably, compared to the reported PDI analogue, such as PDINO,33 a benchmark cathode interlayer for OSCs, PDI-EA shows a higher efficiency when used for modifying PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. The properties of PDINO and PDI-EA are compared in Table S6,† and the remarkable modification of PDI-EA on OSCs is ascribed to the simultaneous enhancements in multiple functions: the lower work function of the Ag electrode with PDI-EA modification; the deeper LUMO energy level of PDI-EA allowing better energy level alignments for electron extraction; the higher conductivity of PDI-EA enhancing charge transport.
2.4 Microstructures and surface properties
The microstructures and surface properties of interlayers are critical factors for OSC performances. We investigated the packing motif of NDI-EA and PDI-EA thin films using GIXD measurements. The GIXD patterns are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding line cuts are shown in Fig. S17.† As can be seen in Fig. 5, both thin films have lamellar packing characteristics, with a notable difference in orientation. The circular diffraction pattern for the NDI-EA thin film is indicative of random oriented intermolecular stacking with homogeneous orientation distributions in the film. In contrast, the PDI-EA thin film is highly ordered with a dominant edge-on orientation, as evidenced by the (010) diffraction peak in the in-plane direction and the (h00) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction. In fact, the fifth-order (h00) diffraction peak for PDI-EA thin film is observed, suggesting a long-range ordered intermolecular stacking. Compared to the random molecular orientation in NDI-EA thin films, the ordered edge-on texture in PDI-EA thin films may facilitate enhanced charge transport. Furthermore, the π–π stacking distance decreases from 3.63 Å for NDI-EA thin films to 3.49 Å for PDI-EA. This highly ordered, close π-stacking in PDI-EA thin films enhances lamellar interactions and eventually facilitates intermolecular charge hopping transport, which agrees well with the higher electron mobility and conductivity in PDI-EA based devices.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are shown in Fig. 5 and S18.† Both films show a granular surface texture, and the layers of PDI-EA and NDI-EA planarize the PM6:Y6 rough surface with the root mean square (RMS) roughness decreasing from 1.01 nm for bare PM6:Y6 blend to 0.53 nm and 0.42 nm upon coating PDI-EA and NDI-EA. However, numerous deep grain boundaries are observed in the NDI-EA thin film that trap charges and impede inter-grain charge transport. In contrast, a smooth surface with continuous large crystalline domains is seen for the PDI-EA thin film, consistent with higher electron mobility and conductivity. Moreover, we note that a water contact angle of <45° was found for both NDI-EA and PDI-EA (Fig. S19†) due to the hydrophilic nature of the two compounds arising from the hydroxide functional groups that enables good metal/organic material contact.7
It is unexpected that bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-containing interlayer materials would be compatible with the non-fullerene acceptors without degradation.30,31 To probe possible reactions between the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group and non-fullerene acceptors, we used 2,2′-(butylimino)diethanol (BDE) as a model. 1H NMR (Fig. S20 and S21†) and MALDI-TOF MS measurements (Fig. S22†) were performed by mixing four equivalents of BDE with Y6 for ten days. In comparison to the 1H NMR spectra of neat Y6, negligible chemical shifts of Y6 and only the additional signals coming from BDE were detected in the Y6/BDE blend with no indication of a reaction. MALDI-TOF MS further confirms the chemical stability of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group with Y6, where a m/z signal of 1451 of Y6 was observed without other m/z signals being evident after blending with BDE. Thus, we conclude that PDI-EA and NDI-EA do not react with Y6, the benchmark material of non-fullerene acceptors.
ESR and UV-vis absorption spectra of mixtures of Y6/bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derivatives were measured to elucidate the relationship between bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups and Y6 (Fig. S23 and S24†). By blending BDE with Y6 (1/1 w/w) in dehydrated toluene, an ESR signal was observed at g = 2.0000, a signature of the doping effects of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups on Y6. Shown in Fig. S24† are the UV-vis absorption spectra of neat Y6 thin films, along with those of Y6/PDI-EA and Y6/NDI-EA bilayer thin films prepared as in the OSC fabrication. The absorption peak of neat Y6 located at 826 nm redshifts to 843 nm and 844 nm with the addition of NDI-EA and PDI-EA, respectively, due to different crystallization induced by bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino derivatives.44 This observation suggests doping effects of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups would not influence intramolecular charge transfer of Y6 and in turn would promote the electron transfer in non-fullerene OSCs. Consequently, the moderate electron transfer induced by PDI-EA and NDI-EA is essential for high-performance OSCs.
3. Conclusions
Two bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino-derived small molecules, PDI-EA and NDI-EA, were synthesized by combining bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino groups with electron-deficient conjugated cores to serve as multiple modification cathode interlayers for binary OSCs. The synthesis is simple and controllable to meet low-cost, large-scale production requirements. The bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino group, with both tertiary amine and hydroxide modification sites, is proven to be a useful multi-site functional unit for modifying non-fullerene bulk heterojunctions: the intrinsic molecular polarity enables well-aligned energy levels and excellent surface properties; the electron-donating tendency facilitates self-doping to enhance free charge generation and collection. When PDI-EA was used as the cathode modifier to prepare PM6:Y6 and PM6:L8-BO binary organic solar cells, the maximum PCEs of 18.04% for PM6:Y6 devices and 18.50% for PM6:L8-BO devices are achieved, among the highest for PM6:Y6 and organic binary OSCs to date. PDI-EA and NDI-EA are demonstrated to be robust cathode modifier candidates and provide the possibility for multi-site cathode interlayers to enhance organic solar cell performances.

After drying under vacuum, PDI-EA was obtained as a red solid (0.61 g, 90%); 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6 with a small amount of TFA-d, δ): 8.10 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 8.02 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 4.11 (s, 4H), 3.79 (t, J = 4.8 Hz, 8H), 3.29–3.40 (m, 12H), 2.17 (m, 4H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6 with a small amount of TFA-d, δ): 162.93, 133.33, 130.49, 127.82, 124.61, 123.98, 122.09, 55.62, 54.83, 51.58, 37.63, and 22.47; HRMS (MALDI-TOF) m/z: [M + H]+ calcd for C38H40N4O8, 681.2919; found, 681.2873.


4.2.2 Synthesis of DI-EAN. 
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (0.27 g, 1 mmol) was dispersed in DMF (15 mL) in a round bottom flask. The flask was evacuated and refilled with nitrogen several times. N-(3-Aminopropyl) diethanolamine (0.41 g, 2.5 mmol) was dissolved in DMF and added slowly via syringe. The mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 15 h. After cooling down to room temperature, DMF was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining precipitate was dissolved in dichloromethane, and the organic phases were washed with brine three times. After drying over MgSO4, the mixture was filtered, evaporated and dried in a vacuum oven to yield a brown solid product (0.36 g, 65%);1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 8.60 (s, 4H), 4.31 (t, J = 4.8 Hz, 4H), 4.06 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 8H), 3.41–3.46 (q, 4.0 Hz, 8H), 2.60 (t, J = 7.0 Hz,4H), 2.53 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 8H), 1.78 (quin, J = 7.3 Hz,4H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 163.00, 130.80, 126.62, 126.46, 59.78, 57.03, 53.04, 39.23, and 25.82; HRMS (MALDI-TOF) m/z: [M + H]+ calcd for C28H37N4O8, 557.2606, found, 557.2595.

4.3 Device fabrication
Conventional organic solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/cathode interlayers/Ag. The device preparations started with cleaning the ITO glass by sequential ultrasonic treatment in deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min. Then PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered and spin-coated at 3500 rpm upon these cleaned ITO glasses, followed by heating to 150 °C in air to remove the water. In a glovebox filled with nitrogen, the PM6:Y6 solution was prepared by blending PM6 with Y6 at a weight ratio of 1/1.2 in chloroform with 0.5 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene. After stirring at room temperature for 3 h, the 16 mg ml−1 PM6:Y6 solution was used to fabricate binary active layers by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 1 min and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Before vacuum evaporation of the 100 nm Ag cathode through a shadow mask, cathode interlayer thin films of around 10 nm-thickness were deposited from the 2 mg mL−1 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol solution at 4000 rpm.
The fabrication of PM6:L8-BO binary organic solar cells was similar to that of PM6:Y6 organic solar cells, apart from the preparation of PM6:L8-BO blend solutions (17.6 mg mL−1). The PM6:L8-BO mixtures with a weight ratio of 1/1.2 were solubilized in chloroform with 0.25% of the diiodomethane additive.
4.4 Device characterization

4.4.1 Organic solar cell characteristics. 
The photovoltaic performances were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Module and a Class AAA solar simulator (SAN-EI Model: XES-40S3-TT), under AM 1.5 G irradiation under N2 conditions at an area of 4 mm2. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard Si cell. Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was characterized on a solar cell QE tester (QE-R3011, ENLITECH).


4.4.2 SCLC measurements. 
The fabrication of electron-only layered devices with the structure of ITO/Y6/cathode interlayers/Ag resembled that of the above-mentioned organic solar cell. The electron mobility was calculated using the calibrated Mott–Gurney equation:  where J is the current density, γ the non-ideal contact factor (γ = 1 for ohmic contact), ε0 the vacuum permittivity, εr the dielectric constant (3 in this case), V the voltage, and L the thickness of Y6 (105 nm).


4.4.3 Conductivity measurements. 
Glass slides were sequentially rinsed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol under ultrasonic conditions. These cleaned glass substrates were utilized to evaporate 50 nm-thick Ag interdigitated electrodes through a shadow mask with a channel width/length of 50/1300 μm. Then cathode interlayer thin films were fabricated by spin-coating from PDI-EA and for NDI-EA solutions under a N2 atmosphere. The electron conductivities were extracted from the expression:  where σ is the conductivity, L the channel length, W the channel width, V the applied voltage, and T is the thickness of cathode interlayers (47 nm for PDI-EA and 35 nm for NDI-EA).


4.4.4 Microstructure characteristics. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on an Agilent AFM 5500 in tapping mode. Film thicknesses were determined by using a surface profiler (Bruker DEKTAK-XT) and AFM.
