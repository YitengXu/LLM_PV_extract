    , Accepted 8th June 2022First published on 8th June 2022AbstractCarbazole-based molecules V1205 and V1206 capable of cross-linking via three vinyl groups were synthesized by a simple process and applied as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSC). Novel HTMs were thermally polymerized to provide films resistant to organic solvents. A PSC with V1205 exhibited a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 16.9% with good stability.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting increasing worldwide attention as a competitive alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells1 owing to their low-cost constituent materials, solution processing2 and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).3 Currently, the highest PCE of 25.8% (certified 25.5%) under standard illumination published in peer-reviewed journals was achieved in a so-called “regular”, or n–i–p configuration, where HTM is deposited on top of the perovskite absorber layer.4 As an alternative, in recent years, also p–i–n (or “inverted”) configuration of PSCs has been explored with efficiencies getting close to those of the best regular PSCs (the highest published PCE value is 25.0%).5 Moreover, inverted PSCs have an advantage in tandem applications where atomic layer deposition of SnOx if often used to provide a functional protective contact that enables sputtering of transparent conducting oxides.6 The advantages of PSCs with the inverted p–i–n architecture over n–i–p ones include the absence of dopants in the hole transporting layer, negligible hysteresis behavior, and compatibility with organic electronics manufacturing processes.7 However, in the case of p–i–n devices, solution-processing of the perovskite absorber layer adds additional constraints on the choice of HTMs, as it usually should withstand a mixture of polar DMF:DMSO solvents. Therefore, so far the most popular choice of organic HTMs for such devices are polymers, such as PEDOT:PSS8 and PTAA,9 or combination of them.10 As an alternative, several strategies have been reported, e.g. use of self-assembled monolayers,11 change of the perovskite precursor solvent12 or use of soluble precursors that are subsequently transformed into insoluble films.13 Recently, cross-linkable fluorene-based HTMs have been introduced into inverted PSCs devices resulting in relatively high performances.14 These small-molecule-based HTMs can be in situ converted into solvent-resistant, cross-linked networks. This approach provides an ideal solution to avoid tedious synthesis and purification that are often encountered for polymers.
On the other hand, the low-cost 9H-carbazole as a starting material is interesting due to its excellent charge-transport properties, high chemical stability, and simple functionalization of the structure with a variety of functional groups, which enable fine-tuning of the optical and electronic properties of target HTMs.15 Therefore, carbazole-based derivatives have been employed in organic light-emitting diodes,16 organic thin film transistors,17 and dye-sensitized solar cells.18 In recent years, carbazole-based HTMs have also attracted much attention in perovskite solar cells.19
In this work, cross-linkable carbazole-based HTMs V1205 and V1206 (Fig. 1), containing three vinyl groups, were synthesized in the simple reactions from commercially available materials and their properties were investigated. The new compounds underwent thermal polymerization to form solvent-resistant films. As a proof of concept, PSCs of p–i–n configuration were constructed, and a promising PCE of 16.7% was reached for a device with polymerized V1205, indicating a great potential of the presented class of cross-linkable dopant-free HTMs.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the synthesized carbazole-based cross-linkable HTMs V1205 and V1206. 
For the target materials to undergo in situ cross-linking, it is required to incorporate at least two groups that can undergo polymerization into the structure of the final cross-linked networks. Therefore, commercially available 3-bromo-9H-carbazole and 3,6-dibromo-9H-carbazole were chosen as starting compounds and two precursors 1 and 2 were synthesized by using a simple alkylation reaction scheme (Scheme 1). Next, in a sequential Hartwig–Buchwald palladium-catalyzed amination, p-anisidine was first coupled with 1 to yield compound 3, which was then reacted with precursor 2 to provide the target product V1205 containing three cross-linking 4-vinylbenzyl groups. Similarly, the precursor 1 reacted with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole to produce compound 4, which could be treated with compound 2 to provide the final product V1206 bearing cross-linking 4-vinylbenzyl groups. V1206 was designed by replacing 4-methoxyphenyl groups in V1205 with carbazolyl moieties. Structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by NMR and elemental analysis data. Detailed synthesis procedures and analysis data are reported in the ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to V1205 and V1206. 
To evaluate the optical properties of the synthesized compounds, UV/vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded from the solutions (Fig. 2a). The UV spectra for both monomers, V1205 and V1206, show an absorption maximum (λmax) in the UV range at 325 nm, while only negligible absorption in the visible range of electromagnetic radiation has been recorded. The latter property is particularly important in devices with a p–i–n architecture, in which the light first passes through the HTM layer. Furthermore, it can be seen from the PL spectra that the emission of V1206 is slightly red-shifted by 9 nm, compared to that of V1205, which corresponds to the increased π-conjugated electron system.
 Fig. 2  (a) UV/vis and PL spectra of the solutions of V1205 and V1206 (THF, 10−4 M); (b) first and second scan heating curves of V1205 and V1206 (heating rate 10 °C min−1, the y-axis is showing a heat flux). Cross-linking experiment of V1205 (c) and V1206 (d) films. The UV/vis spectra of the solutions prepared by dipping spin coated HTM films into THF after heating at 200 °C (c) and 300 °C (d) for the respective duration. 
For the evaluation of the thermal stability of the synthesized carbazole-based materials and their ability to undergo a cross-linking process, thermal properties were studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both compounds showed excellent thermal stability, with a Tdec of 443 °C for V1205 and 404 °C for V1206, as seen from the TGA analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†). The DSC curves have shown that both investigated compounds exist only in an amorphous state since no endothermic melting peaks were detected during both heating cycles (Fig. 2b). For V1205, during the first DSC heating cycle, the glass transition process was detected at 117 °C, followed by an exothermic process at 196 °C, suggesting that thermal polymerization occurred at this temperature. During the second heating cycle, no phase transitions were observed, confirming the formation of the cross-linked polymer. For compound V1206, with higher molecular weight, a lower Tg of 56 °C was detected and the cross-linking process started at ∼270 °C with a peak at ∼300 °C (Fig. 2b). Again, during the second heating cycle, no phase transitions were detected. It should be noted that this cross-linking process does not require any use of initiators or dopants, and consequently, no unexpected impurities and defects that are detrimental to the device efficiency and stability can be introduced.
To evaluate the cross-linking ability of the thin films of the carbazole-based HTMs, the amount of washed material from the spin-coated film was evaluated by means of UV/vis spectroscopy detailed cross- into an insoluble polymer while in the case of V1206 this process was faster – it took only 30 min. For both films, the cross-linking was completed roughly after 1.5 h of heating. The cross-linked films have shown to be resistant to the DMF:DMSO (4:1) solvent mixture, as after exposure to them the UV/vis absorption spectra of the films remained almost the same (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†).
Next, the ability of new HTMs to transport charges was evaluated by the xerographic time-of-flight (XTOF) technique. The measured electric field dependencies of the hole drift mobilities in V1205 and V1206 are presented in Fig. 3. For both new HTMs, measurements from pure layers were not possible due to their insufficient quality, therefore, the charge transfer in layers of blends with bisphenol Z-polycarbonate (PC-Z), in weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3, which were of suitable quality, were studied in detail (Fig. S2–S5, ESI†). Based on the exponential dependence of the charge carrier mobility on the average distance between the charge transporting molecules,20 interpolated mobility values were calculated for the case of pure material. Compound V1206 bearing higher number of carbazolyl chromophores showed good charge transporting properties, i.e. reached 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at strong electrical fields (Fig. 3a). The simpler compound V1205 showed slightly lower hole drift mobilities, yet still comparable to that of popular HTMs for PSCs. Since the cross-linking process does not affect the chromophoric system of the HTMs, it had only a minor influence on the hole drift mobility. Hole drift mobility of V1205 even increased slightly after cross-linking (Fig. S6, ESI†), as was confirmed by the time-of-flight (TOF) method, as no measurement results were obtained by the XTOF method. Unfortunately, it was not possible to measure the hole drift mobility of V1206 after cross-linking using neither the XTOF nor the TOF method. In addition to charge transporting properties, ionization potentials were measured through photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA). The values were 4.97 eV and 5.00 eV for V1205 and V1206, respectively (Fig. 3b and c). As expected, these values changed negligibly after cross-linking (Fig. 3b and c). The recorded ionization potential values are consistent with the values reported for other HTMs used in PSCs.

To evaluate the performance of materials acting as hole-selective layers in PSCs, devices with p–i–n architecture (Fig. 4a) were fabricated and characterized. As an absorber material, triple-cation perovskite was used, with a nominal precursor solution composition of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3. The films of the organic HTMs were prepared by spin-coating from toluene followed by the annealing at 200 °C (1.5 h) for V1205 and 300 °C (1 h) for V1206 to achieve cross-linking, as was determined previously. A detailed description of the fabrication and characterization of the devices can be found in the ESI.† The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells was evaluated from their photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The cross-linked V1205 allowed for higher open-circuit voltages (VOC) and current density (JSC) and, as a consequence, the higher PCE of 16.9% than that of V1206 (Fig. 4b and Table 1). As seen from Fig. 4c, only minor hysteresis was recorded. Performance of the employing thermally cross-linked HTM films was compared with that of neat films. As presented in Fig. 4d, PCE recorded for the devices employing monomer films of V1206 was lower (by 10.0% on average) compared with that of the devices with crosslinked same HTM. Lowering of PCE can be attributed to the formation of direct contact between perovskite and ITO due to the damage of the HTM film during solution-processing of the perovskite film. This in turn led to an increased interfacial recombination, which reduced VOC. Interestingly, devices with the monomer V1205 practically did not function. Apparently, the HTM layer was severely damaged in this case. The solubility of both monomers was tested in a DMF and DMSO mixture (4:1) since this mixture of solvents is used during the formation of the perovskite layer. Solubility of monomer V1205 was almost twice higher (10 mg/50 μl) than that of monomer V1206 (10 mg/80 μl) what is in accordance with the obtained results. In order to estimate the stability of the fabricated devices with the best performing cross-linked V1205, we have retested the devices after 30 days (N2 atmosphere, dark, room temperature). Overall, the devices have shown a good shelf lifetime. For the best pixel, 97% of the initial performance was retained. The main reason behind the slightly lower performance was a drop in VOC (Fig. S9, ESI†), which could be attributed to the increased number of defects in the bulk of perovskite. A more detailed statistical analysis of the aged devices can be found in Table S1 (ESI†).

In summary, two novel carbazole-based hole-transporting materials, namely V1205 and V1206, were synthesized by a simple process with high yield and investigated. The synthesized compounds exhibit good thermal stabilities, high hole-drift mobilities and appropriate HOMO levels, indicating that these materials can be promising HTMs in PSCs. Due to the presence of three vinyl groups, compounds V1205 and V1206 are able to undergo thermal cross-linking during the heating at 200 °C and 300 °C, respectively. After thermal polymerization the deposited films became resistant towards organic solvents. By employing cross-linked V1205 and V1206 as HTM layers between perovskite and ITO in inverted type perovskite solar cells, the PCE is improved to 16.9% (V1205) and to 14.6% (V1206) under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. To achieve higher efficiency, further optimization of the concentration of the cross-linkable HTMs is under investigation and will be reported later.
