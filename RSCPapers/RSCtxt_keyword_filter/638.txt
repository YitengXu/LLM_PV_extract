    , Accepted 14th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractWe investigated the photoelectric properties of two indoline dyes (CA2 and CA3) with different conjugated length spacers, and the same cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, and global evaluation models were developed based on the experimental results, the developed normal model, the transient spectrum results, and the theoretical normal model. First, the properties of two dyes were studied through ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, energy levels, and molecular descriptors. The observations agreed well with calculations carried out through basis-set correction. Second, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) curve were estimated by using the developed normal model (DNM) based on the transient spectrum, molar extinction coefficient, adsorption capacity, and recombination rate. The values of the DNM method (Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, η% = 7.81 for CA2) were closer to the experimental results (Jsc = 17.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, η% = 6.57) compared with the normal model (Jsc = 21.66 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.50 V and η% = 8.67), which was evaluated by using the electron-injection lifetime, excited-state lifetime, fluorescence lifetime, energy difference between the TiO2 conduction band (ECBE), and the electron difference between the donor and the recipient (nc) for Jsc and Voc. The DNM could be used to evaluate Jsc, Voc, and η from considerations of the relationship between the macroscopic properties and microscopic parameters, and provided an effective method to improve the molecular design and performance tuning by decreasing factors that affect the energy conversion unfavorably.
1. Introduction
Rapid developments of renewable-energy sources have resulted in solar energy being used as an alternative energy source.1–5 Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)-based TiO2 films, which were first proposed by Grätzel and his co-workers in 1991,6 are being considered as third-generation photovoltaic devices because of their low cost and simple production. The workflow consists of four steps7–9 and the operational principles are shown in Fig. 1: (a) dye molecules receive energy from sunlight, and the electrons are excited; (b) the excited electrons are injected into the TiO2 films; (c) electrons pass through the conductive glass, outer circuit, and opposite electrode; (d) a redox reaction occurs, and the excited dyes gain electrons through the electrolyte.9–12

Because the dye is an important factor in light absorption and elementary DSSC processes, many experimental attempts have been made to design high-performance (η) DSSCs,13–15 and photosensitizers have been produced that contain ruthenium dyes,16,17 metal-free dyes (such as coumarin, phenylene, and indoline),18–21 and porphyrin.22,23 Remarkable success was obtained when using a ruthenium-based sensitizer, which was found to increase η to above 11%,14,16 and exhibited a high stability and effective electron-injection rate. Recently, an impressive power-conversion efficiency of 12.6% was achieved by using blue dye (R6) that contained a diarylamine electron donor and a 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c]1,2,5 thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid acceptor bridged by a rigid conjugated spacer.24 Asymmetrical squaraine dyes (XSQ1-4) have been reported25 to display near-infrared (NIR) absorption and a high extinction coefficient in a system that consisted of a fused structure of fluorenylindolenine and branched alkyl groups that controlled dye aggregation. Hagfeldt et al. used coadsorption/cosensitization based on XY1&D35 to obtain a higher Voc and PCE under ambient-light conditions.21
Molecular engineering of organic sensitizers with dyestuff and multi-branch (multi-donor) arrangements, and cosensitization,16–22 has allowed for an improvement of the DSSC photoelectric properties. Theoretical works have been undertaken to investigate many aspects of the sensitizers,26–36 such as their molecular structure, molecular spectra, and electron-transfer dynamics and to design their molecular structures and predict their molecular properties. The basis setfunctional correction and solvent-effect calculations simulated the light response of organic dyes accurately under realistic conditions.35,36 The driving force and rate of electron injection from dye to titanium dioxide should satisfy the energy-matching principle and ultrafast electron transfer,32–34 and provide quantitative criteria to interpret the experimentally observed phenomena, because the Jsc is dependent mainly on the absorption, electron-transfer, and regeneration processes. However, it is difficult to predict the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) accurately and to estimate efficiency (η) theoretically because these photoelectric parameters are affected by many processes and factors that are related closely to light absorption, electron transfer, and the interfacial interaction between the dye, titanium dioxide photoanode, and electrolyte. The Voc, Jsc, and η of sensitized solar cells can be predicted accurately and this aspect is significant in the experimental and theoretical research. The photoelectric performance prediction can reduce unnecessary waste during molecular synthesis.
We measured the photoelectric properties of two indoline dyes (CA2 and CA3, see Fig. 2), with different conjugated spacers (vinylthiophene and thiophene) and the same acceptor (cyanoacrylic acid) experimentally, and used two prediction models, namely a developed normal model (DNM) and a normal model (NM), to estimate Voc, Jsc, and η. For completeness, functionals and basis sets B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3PW91/6-31G(d), MPW1PW91/6-31G(d), CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d), and Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) were used to correct the absorption spectra of the dyes, and the theoretical results were compared with the experimental measurements of ultraviolet visible spectra (UV-vis), energy levels, and chemical parameters relative to the tested dyes. In the framework of the DNM, the measured quantities included the absorbance, light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), and the transient spectrum, which were used to determine the Jsc. Based on the recombination rate, the transformation relationship between Voc and Jsc was established. The Voc was obtained from the NM based on the electrolyte (I−/I3−) and Fermi levels of the TiO2 conduction band. When applying the NM, the Jsc was calculated in terms of the electron-injection lifetime, excited-state lifetime, and fluorescence lifetime, which considered the influence of electron injection rate and excited-state time on the injection efficiency. Estimated PCE models allowed for traces of the current–voltage curves and PCE, and for a comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical model to improve the accuracy of the quantitative calculations. These methods represent a way to improve the molecular design and tuning performance by decreasing the factors that affect the energy-conversion process unfavorably.

2. Experimental and computational methods
2.1 Experimental method
CA2 and CA3 were from Hebei Normal University (Hebei, China) as WBS-1T and C-CA,37 and were analyzed by using a TU-1900 spectrometer (Beijing, China). Optoelectronic parameters were tested by using a solar-simulation instrument (Pecell-15, Japan), and the light intensity was adjusted via a reference standard Si-solar cell with a sunlight intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out by using a CHI615E Electrochemical Workstation (Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The redox-potential standard solution was a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, and the redox potential of the dyes was measured by using 0.1 M KNO3 as the electrolyte. The scanning range was between −1000 mV and +1000 mV, with an initial potential of −1000 mV and a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. Tests were carried out by using a three-electrode workstation with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The transient spectra of CA2 and CA3 were measured via the femtosecond pump–probe technique and non-linear time-of-flight. Significant spectrum aggregation and synthesis occurred under the Wiley–McLaren conditions. The laser used in the experiments was a sapphire chirped-pulse amplified Ti laser (Lira-usp-HE, Coherent Inc.). Its central wavelength, pulse duration, repetition rate, and maximum pulse energy were 800 nm, 50 fs, 1 kHz, and 4 mJ, respectively. The 50/50 beam splitter was the main output of the laser beams.38
2.2 Computational method
The ground-state structures of CA2, CA3, CA2/TiO2, and CA3/TiO2 were optimized using density-functional-theory (DFT)39,40 B3LYP41/6-31G(d)42,43 calculations for the C, N, S, O, and H atoms and pseudopotentials of LANL2DZ44,45 for the Ti atom. The solution was evaluated by using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) for the ethanol solution.46,47 The UV-vis spectra were calculated via time-dependent density-functional-theory (TD-DFT)48,49 by using the B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3PW91/6-31G(d), MPW1PW91/6-31G(d), Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) functionals.26,50–53 The theoretical calculation of dye molecules was carried out by using the Gaussian 09 package.54 Multiwfn 3.39 was applied for wave-function analyses.55
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Absorption spectra of the dyes

Fig. 3(a) shows the experimental absorption spectra of the CA2 and CA3 dyes for 350–750 nm, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the CA2 arrangement, CA3 presented a longer double-bond characteristic in the conjugate bridge (see Fig. 2), and the maximum absorption peaks of CA2 and CA3 were located at 477 nm and 480 nm, respectively. The absorption peak of CA3 was slightly larger than that of CA2, which means that an absorption red shift occurred when the conjugate-bridge length increased.

The optical properties of CA2 and CA3 were obtained theoretically by using B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3PW91/6-31G(d), MPW1PW91/6-31G(d), Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d), and Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) functionals and the TD-DFT method in solvent. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), and data are reported in Table 1. TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) functionals show the absorption region (300–730 nm) in which the corresponding λmax values were 483 and 488 nm, respectively. The absorption region based on B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3PW91/6-31G(d), and MPW1PW91/6-31G(d) evaluated via the TD-DFT method was 300–900 nm, and the absorption peaks were located at 614, 617, and 583 nm, respectively. For the CA3 dye, the λmax values were 491 and 489 nm when evaluated using TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), respectively, and 652, 657, and 613 nm when evaluated based on TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d), TD-DFT/B3PW91/6-31G(d) and TD-DFT/MPW1PW91/6-31G(d). The experimental spectra of CA2 and CA3 are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the absorption peaks calculated with TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) for the two dyes were close to the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively.
In Fig. 3(b), the strongest oscillator strength of CA2 was relative to the first excited state S1 (see Table 1), and its value was 1.5807 when evaluated with TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d). The electron transition of CA2 occurred from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The electron density of the HOMO level was distributed on the entire molecule, with the exception of the carbon chain and cyclopentane of the donor, which transmitted to the benzene ring, double bond, and thiophene group of the conjugate bridge and to the receptor of the CA2 (LUMO level). According to TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), the strongest oscillator strength was 1.5725, and the electron transition was related directly to the HOMO → LUMO transition. The same electron density of the HOMO and LUMO levels were found using TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d). The S1 of CA3 was the strongest oscillator strength (1.9992) achieved by using TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) (see Table 1), and electron transition took place in the HOMO → LUMO direction. The electron density of the HOMO level covered the entire molecule in addition to the carbon chain and two cyclopentane groups, whereas the electron density of the LUMO level was focused on the benzene ring, double bond, and thiophene of the conjugate bridge and to the receptor of CA3. The strongest oscillator strength was obtained with the TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d, p); the corresponding S1 state was 2.0005, and the electron-transition direction was HOMO → LUMO. The same electron density of the HOMO and LUMO levels were found by using the TD-DFT/Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d).
3.2 Electrochemical characteristics
When dyes are excited by light, electron transfer will occur from the ground state to the excited state and the electrons are injected to the conduction band of the semiconductor (see Fig. 1). Cyclic-voltammetry measurements were carried out for CA2 and CA3 in ethanol, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The HOMO and LUMO energy values may be obtained from these figures as the intersection between the two tangent lines of the rising and starting current curves. Leeuw et al.56 reported the experimental HOMO and LUMO energies, respectively, with EHOMO = −(EOX + 4.40 eV) and ELUMO = −(ERed + 4.40 eV), where EOX and ERed represent the onset oxidation potentials of CA2 and CA3. Hence, the HOMO and LUMO energies of CA2 were calculated to be −5.34 eV and −3.78 eV, respectively, and those of CA3 were −5.33 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively. The above comparison shows that the energy gap of CA3 was lower than that of CA2.

By using the Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculation methods, the HOMO and LUMO levels and energy gaps of CA2 with CA3 were calculated and are shown in Fig. 4(c). These data were also reported in Table 2. The energy levels of TiO2 and I−/I3− were −4.0 eV57 and −4.6 eV,58 respectively. For Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d), the HOMO and LUMO levels were −4.81 eV and −2.60 eV for CA2, and −4.81 eV and −2.71 eV for CA3, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the dyes were determined by using Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and were −5.03 eV, −2.80 eV, −5.04 eV, and −2.91 eV for CA2 and CA3. Fig. 4(c) shows that the LUMO levels of CA2 and CA3 were higher than the conduction band of TiO2, which means that the electron of the excited dyes could be injected into TiO2. The HOMO of the two dyes were lower than I−/I3− (see Fig. 4(c)); therefore, both dyes could achieve electron recovery. The HOMO and LUMO energies with Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) were close to the experimental cyclic-voltammetry measurements.

3.3 Molecular descriptors
The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) were defined as the loss of electrons from the neutral state to the cations, or as the acquisition of electrons into the anions, and therefore, they reflect the ability of the system to gain or lose electrons in the organic system. Table 3 shows the results for the Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d)-based set. The EA and IP of CA2 and CA3 were 4.81 eV, 2.60 eV, 4.81 eV, and 2.71 eV, respectively. For the Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)-based set, the values were 5.03 eV, 2.80 eV, 5.04 eV, and 2.91 eV, respectively. The EA and IP can be viewed as the energy change that accompanies the extraction of the electrons and the addition of holes in the molecules. The IP value was smaller, and the energy of the injection holes was higher. The increase in EA indicates that the electron injection became easier. According to Table 3, the data relative to CA2 and CA3 are very similar. The Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)-based values were closer to the experimental data. By using the same argument, the values of ETOTAL, χ, η, and S could be estimated from the IP and EA results (see Table 3). The values of ETOTAL, χ, η, and S that were obtained by using Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) were closer to the results that were derived from the experimental IP and EA. However, the Cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method yielded a greater error compared with the Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method. To summarize, the electrochemical characteristics and molecular descriptors from the Cam-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) were close to the test values and therefore were used to evaluate the energy-conversion efficiency of the tested dyes.

3.4 Interfacial binding of dyes and TiO2
The cyanoacrylic acid receptor of dyes and the TiO2 are connected via a bridging structure, which results from the combination covalent bond between the Ti and O atoms. The Cam-B3LYP with 6-311G(d,p) for the C, N, S, O, and H atoms and the pseudopotentials of LANL2DZ for the Ti atom were performed on the system of dyes and TiO2, and are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 reveals the projected density of states (PDOS) of CA2 and CA3 and allows for a determination of the energy levels (see Table 4). The HOMO and LUMO levels of CA2 and CA3 shifted because of the binding on TiO2 compared with the isolated molecules (see Table 2). The calculated LUMO of the dyes were lower than the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of the semiconductor TiO2 substrate, and the ECBM was an important component of the DNM method during the calculation of Voc. The HOMO levels were higher than the valence-band maximum (VBM) and were more negative than the iodide/triiodide redox potential. The results show the energetically favorable ground-state dye regeneration. The calculated energy levels of HOMO, LUMO, CBM, and VBM are listed in Table 4.

3.5 Photovoltaic characterization of dyes and theoretical calculations
The conversion efficiency is one of the key factors to determine the DSSC performance. The optoelectronic parameters of the DSSCs were measured as shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and η that were obtained for CA2 and CA3 are listed in Table 5. Although the conjugate bridge of CA3 was longer than that of CA2, the CA2 dye exhibited a more desirable photoelectric performance with Jsc = 17.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 0.65, and η = 6.57% for CA2, and Jsc = 15.45 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V, FF = 0.66, and η = 5.84% for CA3. The photoelectric performance is the most important factor for the DSSCs, which means that the photoelectric properties of the CA2 were better than those of the CA3, and the conjugate bridge that was added to the double bond of CA3 could not increase the η.

To simulate the Voc, Jsc, FF, and η and to clarify the main reasons for the observed differences, the DNM and NM models were set up. Of the two, the DNM results were closer to the experimental measurement. It is hoped that the DNM can provide a choice for the accurate prediction of the molecular photoelectric properties and guidance for the molecular design in the field of organic optoelectronic materials.
The energy-conversion efficiency (η) was determined from the values of Jsc, Voc, and FF, and the incident solar power (Pinc) from:59 (1)FF represents the ratio between the product of the maximum current and voltage and between the product of Jsc and Voc:60 (2)where Im and Vm are the maximum current and voltage, respectively.
Based on eqn (1), η is affected by Jsc under DNM, which can be determined experimentally from:1 (3)where SI is the light intensity, q is the unit charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, c is the light velocity, and the IPCE is evaluated as.61 IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ϕinjηcoll(4)

Eqn (3) shows that a higher IPCE can result in a higher Jsc, and thus it is necessary to study the main factor that affects the IPCE. Eqn (4) also indicates that the IPCE is determined by the light-harvesting efficiency, electron-injection efficiency, and collection efficiency. These three factors reflect the dye characteristics and depend on the interaction between the dye and the TiO2. One- or two-parameter models can assess the Jsc qualitatively; however, they do not yield comparable results. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an in-depth analysis of the micromechanism of the process.
The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) is computed as:62 (5)D is the thickness of the TiO2 thin film, P is the adsorption capacity, and ε is the molar-extinction coefficient. A combination of eqn (3)–(5) yields: (6)where ϕinj is the injection ability of electrons to the conduction band, and ηcoll is the electronic composite ability, which together determine the value of Jsc. The electron injection and electron composited efficiency can be determined as:63 (7) (8)where τinj is the time required for electron transfer towards the TiO2 surface, τrelax is the relaxation lifetime, τtrans indicates the electron transfer time from the TiO2 film to the electrode, and τrec is the attenuation time. The relaxation lifetime cannot be calculated directly; however, according to the experimental results reported by Cherepy et al.,64 its value does not exceed 10 ps in the dye system considered. The τinj and τrec values of CA2 and CA3 were obtained from the transient spectrum in Fig. 7. τinj and τrec for CA2 were 0.569 and 153.072 ps, respectively; and for CA3 they were 0.617, and 104.888 ps, respectively, as shown in Table 6. A comparison of the two dyes indicates that the τinj value of CA3 was slightly higher than that of CA2; moreover, CA2 possessed a higher τrec value. The larger relaxation lifetime should be the leading factor that controls the injection efficiency because the electron-injection times of the two dyes were of the same order of magnitude, which means that longer relaxation lifetimes led to a higher amount of excited electrons that could be injected into the TiO2, and increased the probability of the event. When the thickness of the TiO2 film was 15 μm and the τtrans value was assumed to be 7 ps,63 the ϕinj values of CA2 and CA3 were found to be 0.946 and 0.942, respectively, on the basis of the τinj and τrelax values; the calculated ηcoll values were 0.956 and 0.937 for CA2 and CA3, respectively. Therefore, the microefficiency of the main surface could be inferred through DNM. In fact, the higher ϕinj and ηcoll for CA2 also explain the higher IPCE value.

The LHE is another important factor that affects the Jsc. The adsorption values (P) of CA2 and CA3 were determined from eqn (5), and were 0.0086 and 0.0083 mmol L−1, respectively. The corresponding LHE values were 0.71 and 0.69. Consequently, the Jsc were calculated with the DNM and were found to be 16.24 and 15.33 mA cm−2 for CA2 and CA3, respectively (see Table 6). The DNM results were close to the experimental values of 17.27 and 15.45 mA cm−2. The P, ϕinj, and ηcoll of CA2 were larger than those of CA3, which resulted in a higher Jsc for CA2. Although the introduction of vinylthiophene into CA3 broadened the absorption spectrum, the electron injection and collection was better for CA2.
The Voc could be calculated from the DNM through the transformation relationship model between Voc and Jsc:65 (9)where N is the charge-transfer coefficient relative to the electron recombination, which is taken empirically to be equal to 0.45; K is the Boltzmann constant; T is the experimental temperature; and R1 is the electron-reduction distance, which is expressed as: (10)where D is the TiO2 film thickness (15 μm); Cox (∼50 mmol L−1) is the absorbed receptor electrolyte concentration; Ns is a surface electronic recombination constant (∼105); γ is a parameter that is related to the electron-trap distribution below the conduction band, which is always lower than 0.3; Krec is the rate of reduction; λ is the reorganization energy;66 and KET is the electron-transfer rate, which can be obtained by using the Marcus theory:67–69 (11)where A is a constant, ΔG is the energy difference between the donor unit of the dye and TiO2, r is the electron transmission distance, β is the attenuation parameter, and λ is an independent variable that can be expressed as:70 (12)The value of λ consists of a solute and a solvent contribution. The first can be determined from  and , where  is the excited-state energy of the cation,  is the ground-state energy of the cation,  is the excited-state energy of the anion, and  is the ground-state energy of the anion. The solvent contribution may be evaluated by using the double ball model:71 (13)where RD, RA, and R are the donor radius, the receptor radius, and the distance between the two, respectively. εOP and ε0 are the optical and zero-frequency dielectric constants of ethanol, respectively. The combination of eqn (10)–(13) allows us to determine the Voc values of 0.59 V for CA2 and 0.57 V for CA3 (see Tables 6 and 7), which were close to the experimental Voc values (see Table 5).

According to the NM, the Voc can be calculated as:72 (14)where ECBE is the difference between the TiO2 conduction-band energy, and the shift in ECB is referred to as ΔECB. nc is the electron difference between the donor and the recipient, NCB is the accessible density of the conduction-band states (7 × 1020 cm−3)73 and Eredox is the electrolyte (I−/I3−) level (−4.6 eV). The value of Voc is affected by ΔECB, which is evaluated as:74 (15)where γads is the film-surface concentration, μnormal is the vertical dipole moment, ε1 is the dielectric constant of the molecules in a vacuum, and ε2 is the dielectric constant of the monolayer film of organic compounds. From Section 3.4, the ECBE value can be calculated to be −2.80 eV. Based on eqn (14) and (15), the Voc values obtained from the NM were found to be 0.50 and 0.49 V, as listed in Table 8. In the framework of the NM, the Jsc values were computed viaeqn (6)–(8), and the theoretical LHE value may be determined as:75 LHE = 1 − 10−f(16)where f is the oscillator strength of the excited state. On the basis of the data (see ESI† in Table S1), it is possible to determine the values of f for the two dyes, and the resulting LHE values are 0.9842 for CA2 and 0.9956 for CA3. The theoretical value of τinj (τth) is determined as:76 (17) (18) τth (fs) = 658/ħΓ (meV)(19)where ħΓ is the broadening width, ELUMO(ads) is the weighted average of the LUMO (ads) levels, pi is the adsorbate portion of the i-th MO for dyes, and εi is the corresponding MO energy. The τth of CA2 (1.24) and CA3 (1.40) may be evaluated from eqn (17)–(19), whereas the theoretical τrec (τrth) is the sum of the excited-state lifetime (τrth1) and the fluorescence lifetime (τrth2), which are expressed as:77 τrth1 = 1.499/f1E2(20) (21)where E is the excitation energy of the different electronic states (cm−1), f1 is the oscillator strength of the excited state, f2 is the oscillator strength of the fluorescent state, and e is the fluorescent energy. Eqn (20) shows that the τrth1 of CA2 and CA3 are 2.27 and 1.80 ns, respectively. The τrth2 values of the two dyes can be determined from eqn (21) to be 1.46 and 2.58 ns, respectively (see Table S2, ESI†). By means of the NM, the values of Jsc for CA2 and CA3 could be calculated from eqn (6) and were found to be 21.66 and 21.22 mA cm−2, respectively (see Table 8). The η of CA2 and CA3 were calculated from eqn (1), and were 8.67% and 8.32%, respectively, as reported in Table 8. Compared with the DNM, the difference between the NM and experiment data was greater (see Tables 5, 6 and 8). The η obtained from the DNM were closer to the experimental data.

The I–V curves of the DSSCs could be derivated by using the above two models, and the equation that describes their behavior is:63 (22)where Is is the reverse saturation current, (23)The I–V curves from eqn (22) and (23) are shown in Fig. 6, where the blue and green curves represent the experimental I–V curves of CA2 and CA3, respectively, the black and red curves represent the DNM, and the pink and deep green curves were obtained with the NM. A large difference could be observed between the NM and the experimental results, which could be attributed to an overestimation of the attenuation time in the NM framework. The DNM results were closer to the experimental curves. This difference between the two models resulted because the attenuation time affects the energy change strongly, and the DNM could more adequately describe the experimental results compared with the NM.
3.6 Determination of reaction site
In addition to the positive and negative electrode and the dye molecules, the electrolytes (I2) are also important constituent parts. Hence, we used the reaction site to determine the location of I2. The reaction site was determined through the LEMS and MEP. Fig. 8(a) and (c) show the electrostatic-potential distribution condition of CA2 and CA3, and the distribution areas of CA2 and CA3 are shown in Fig. 8(b) and (d). Fig. 8(e) and (f) show the LEMS distribution condition of CA2 and CA3. The red, white, and blue areas represent the negative, positive, and zero electrostatic regions, respectively. The deeper-blue area of the MEP indicates the region in which the electrophilic reaction is more likely to occur. The LEMS values indicate the strength of the electronic binding force. By combining the MEP and LEMS, the reaction site of the CA2 can be determined to be between the two nitrogen atoms in the donor; whereas the reaction site of the CA3 is the sulfur atom of the thiophene group.
 Fig. 8  (a–d) are molecular electrostatic potential map and surface area in the electrostatic potential interval of CA2 and CA3; (e) and (f) are local energy of molecular surface of CA2 and CA3. 
4. Conclusions
We applied CA2 and CA3 as photoactive layers for solar cells to evaluate their photovoltaic properties. The experimental results demonstrate that the photovoltaic properties of CA2 (Jsc = 17.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 0.65, and η = 6.57%) are superior to those of CA3 (Jsc = 15.45 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V, FF = 0.66, and η = 5.84%).
Here, two photoelectric efficiency models, namely the DNM and NM, were established. The DNM allowed the Jsc to be evaluated via the transient spectrum, molar-extinction coefficient, and adsorption capacity (16.24 mA cm−2 and 0.59 V for CA2, and 15.33 mA cm−2 and 0.57 V for CA3). The Jsc in the NM was obtained from the electron-injection lifetime, excited-state lifetime, and the fluorescence lifetime, and the Voc was calculated from the difference in the number of electrons in the dyes and the semiconductor TiO2 substrate (nc). The photoelectric parameters were estimated to be 0.50 V and 21.66 mA cm−2 for CA2, and 0.49 V and 21.22 mA cm−2 for CA3. The I–V estimation yielded better results with the DNM than with the NM, which could be attributed to the overestimation of the attenuation time with the NM. The better performance of CA2 could be explained by the excellent electron-injection efficiency, collection efficiency and adsorption capacity, as evaluated by the DNM. The DNM provided an effective means to understand the relationship between the macroperformance and microparameters of the system and to screen for organic materials that were characterized by a high optoelectronic performance in the field of molecular engineering.
