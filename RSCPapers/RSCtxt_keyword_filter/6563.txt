Single crystal X-ray analyses confirm the presence of ordered three dimensional ionic channels for iodide, which exhibits high conductivity when mixed with iodine and LiI and achieves a power conversion efficiency of 7.45%.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide an economically credible alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices.1 Owing to their high energy conversion efficiency and low production cost, they have established themselves as the most promising low-cost alternative to Si-based solar cells for the conversion of solar energy to electricity.2,3 The working principle of these devices is based on ultra-fast electron injection from a photo-excited dye into the conduction band of an oxide semiconductor and subsequent dye regeneration.4 The electrolyte containing a redox couple provides the internal electrical conductivity between working and counter electrodes and charge transfer occurs from the electrolyte to the oxidized dye and from the counter electrode to the electrolyte.
Although the power conversion efficiency has been recorded for DSSCs with volatile organic liquid electrolytes,5 the stability is not good enough for long-term practical operation because of the leakage and evaporation of the liquid electrolyte caused by the technical difficulty in sealing. For this reason, considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) by employing all-solid-state electrolytes due to their potential for providing long-term durability.6,7
Imidazolium iodides have been proven to be a promising material as ionic liquid electrolytes for high-performance DSSCs due to their wide electrochemical window, high electrical conductivity, negligible vapor pressure, and nontoxicity.8,9 However, they are still a type of liquid material and the leakage during long-term operation is unavoidable. Therefore, ssDSSCs with solid state imidazolium iodides having high conductivity are much desired for practical applications. Recently, we reported that replacement of the alkyl group with an ester group in alkyl-substituted imidazolium iodide could enhance ionic conductivity significantly and thus improve solar cell performance remarkably.10 On the basis of ester-alkyl-substituted imidazolium iodide, we designed and synthesized hydroxyethyl and ester co-functionalized imidazolium iodide (abbreviated as HEII, ESI,† Fig. 1a), a solid state ionic conductor (Fig. S1, ESI†), for use in ssDSSCs. The oxygen and hydrogen in the hydroxyethyl group are expected to participate in hydrogen bonding, which is favorable for the ionic conductor to form a closely packed structure towards high conductivity.

The decomposition temperature of HEII was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). HEII starts to decompose at 150 °C as seen from the TGA curve (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Fig. S2b (ESI†) displays differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results for HEII. One sharp endothermic peak, where the ionic conductor undergoes phase transition from solid to liquid, was observed. The melting point was determined to be 79 °C using the peak temperature in the DSC curve. The colorless single crystal (CCDC 889350) of HEII was obtained by slow evaporation of a solution in a mixture solvent of chloroform and methanol at room temperature. HEII crystallized in the monoclinic space group with cell parameters of a = 8.7155(17) Å, b = 13.9002(27) Å, c = 10.2532(20) Å, and β = 111.210 (2)° (Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 1b shows the single crystal structure of HEII, in which the pendent hydroxyethyl and ester groups are oppositely oriented perpendicular to the plane of the imidazolium ring. There are significant hydrogen bonds between adjacent cations and between anions and cations (Fig. S3, ESI†). One cation is connected to another cation by two hydrogen bonds (2.308 Å) of O(3)…H(4B) and H(4B)…O(3), to another two cations by hydrogen bonds (2.628 Å) of O(2)…H(7A) and H(7A)…O(2), and to another two cations by hydrogen bonds (2.745 Å) of I…H(3) and H(3)…I. As the hydrogen bond length for O(3)…H(4B) is much shorter than those for O(2)…H(7A) and I…H(3), the hydrogen bond formed from the oxygen in the hydroxyethyl group is much stronger than that formed from the oxygen in the ester group and that formed from iodine.
The cations are arranged in a head-to-tail configuration, as shown in the packing diagram viewed down the b axis (Fig. 1c). Alternating layers of cations and anions are connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (2.745 Å) of H(3)…I. There are zigzag iodide chains with equal distances of 5.653 Å between the adjacent iodides in the crystal structure (Fig. 1c), each chain on the same plane. The packing diagrams viewed down the a or c axis are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Intermolecular hydrogen bonds lead to ordered three dimensional channels for iodide.
The conductivity was measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. S5, ESI.† Table S2 (ESI†) summarizes the conductivity of HEII and its mixtures doped with iodine and further doped with LiI. For HEII, the conductivity was 0.27 mS cm−1. Upon addition of iodine to HEII (molar ratio HEII:I2 = 12:1), the conductivity increased abruptly by more than one order. Reaction of iodide with iodine can form polyiodides, such as I3−,11 which play an important role in the Grotthus-type exchange or a simple bond exchange reaction (I− + I3− ↔ I3− + I−) between I− and I3−.12–14 The contribution from the bond exchange reaction between I− and I3− dominates the charge transport in the iodine dope HEII.14 This is the major reason for the remarkable enhancement of conductivity upon doping iodine into the ionic conductor.
Introduction of LiI to the above mixture further increased the conductivity to 6.94 mS cm−1 (Table S2, ESI†). One reason for this would be the increased concentration of iodide and Li+ ions, and another reason would be the interaction between Li+ and oxygen in the carbonyl.10 To elucidate this point, mass spectroscopy was performed. The peak at 185 is equal to the calculated mass of the cation in HEII (C8H13N2O3+) for the pure state HEII (Fig. S6a, ESI†), whereas another strong peak, assignable to the cation of the coordination dimer HEII–Li+–HEII (I−C8H13N2O3+Li+C8H13N2O3+I−), is observed at 631 (Fig. S6b, ESI†). The formation of the HEII–Li–HEII dimer inserted one more iodide between the adjacent molecules, reducing the distance between neighboring iodides and hence facilitating charge transfer along the polyiodide chain. As a consequence, the improved charge transfer and increased ionic concentration caused by the introduction of LiI further enhanced conductivity significantly.
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the conductivity and the temperature for HEII and its mixture with iodine and LiI. In the tested temperature range of −15 to 60 °C, the conductivity obeys the Arrhenius equation15σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/kT)where σ is the ionic conductivity, Ea the activation energy, T the absolute temperature, and k the Boltzmann constant. The ionic conduction revealed by the Arrhenius relation originates from charge transfer along the polyiodide chain, which looks like ionic movements. At each temperature in the tested range, the conductivity of the mixture is much higher than that of pure HEII.

The ssDSSCs based on an organic sensitizer (MK2, Fig. S7, ESI†)16 were fabricated using HEII containing different components. By varying the components and their contents in the solid electrolytes, the solar cell performance was optimized (Table S3–S6, ESI†). While HEII itself could not operate the ssDSSC, doping of iodine into HEII could operate the ssDSSC with quite a low efficiency, and further doping of LiI into HEII resulted in a much higher efficiency. The significant improvement of efficiency is mainly attributed to the enhanced conductivity. In addition, the presence of Li+ ions can lower the conduction band edge, which is favorable for photocurrent generation. The solid electrolyte mixture (HEII/I2/LiI = 12:1:3) produced a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 9.33 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 564 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.673, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.54%. To improve the Voc, 1-methylbenziimidazole (NMBI, solid) was added to the mixture, which contributed to the unidirectional electron flow in the device by suppressing electron recombination with electron acceptors. It is noted that the conductivity changed negligibly upon addition of NMBI to the electrolyte (Table S2, ESI†). As expected, the Voc was improved significantly upon introduction of NMBI to the system, which also increased Jsc significantly (Table S6, ESI†). In the ratio of HEII/I2/LiI/NMBI = 12:1:3:10, the all-solid-state solar cell produced a Jsc of 13.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 687 mV, and an FF of 0.661, corresponding to a PCE of 6.27%. The effect of NMBI on solar cell performance can be explained by referring to the effect of 4-tert-butylpyridine as reported by Hagfeldt et al.,17 as they are both Lewis bases. The improvement of Voc can be attributed to (1) suppressed charge recombination rate, (2) negatively shifted conduction band edge, or (3) the combined effect of (1) and (2).17 The improvement of Jsc by NMBI is likely attributed to the improved charge collection.17
As pore filling of solid electrolyte is a major problem limiting the solar cell performance of ssDSSCs, a small quantity of 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) was added to the mixture (HEII/I2/LiI/NMBI/MPII = 12:1:3:10:0.5) to inhibit the crystal growth of the solid electrolyte during electrolyte injection and device fabrication. It is noted that MPII is not a solvent here because of its very small amount (molar fraction, xMPII = 0.02) relative to other solid materials and this mixture is still a solid at the device operating conditions. Owing to the presence of MPII, the pore filling was much improved as revealed by the SEM images (Fig. S8, ESI†) with and without MPII. For a solid state electrolyte containing small amount of MPII (HEII/I2/LiI/NMBI/MPII = 12:1:3:10:0.5), the ssDSSC produced a Jsc of 14.66 mA cm−2, a Voc of 733 mV, and an FF of 0.693, corresponding to a PCE of 7.45%, as shown in Fig. 3a. As a small amount of MPII changes conductivity negligibly (Table S2, ESI†), the improvement of pore filling by MPII should account for the significantly enhanced Jsc and PCE. It is noted that the efficiency was only 2.33% (Jsc = 4.68 mA cm−2, Voc = 684 mV, FF = 0.727) when HEII was not included in the electrolyte, indicating that HEII is very important to achieve such a high efficiency. As compared to the ester-methyl-substituted imidazolium iodide (Fig. S9, ESI†) that we reported previously,10 HEII produced a higher efficiency (7.45% vs. 6.63%) under each optimal condition. Under the same best conditions used in this work, the ester-methyl-substituted imidazolium iodide produced an efficiency of 5.51% (Jsc = 11.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 673 mV, FF = 0.695). The replacement of the methyl with the hydroxyethyl group enhanced the efficiency by 35%, indicating that our molecular design was successful.

IPCE as a function of incident wavelength for the ssDSSC is shown in Fig. 3b. The integrated photocurrent obtained from the overlapping integral of IPCE spectra and the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum is 14.71 mA cm−2. Good agreement between the measured and calculated photocurrents indicates that the mismatch between the simulated solar light and standard AM1.5G solar emission is negligible. Thus, the obtained photovoltaic data are reliable. It is impressive that the highest IPCE is about 82%, suggesting that this solid state electrolyte is excellent for operating a highly efficient ssDSSC.
Long-term stability is one of the critical parameters for practical applications. The stability for the ssDSSC based on the solid state electrolyte was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one-sun soaking with a 400 nm cut-off filter on the device surface (Fig. S10, ESI†). During long-term operation, the surface temperature of the tested device was 50–55 °C, but the electrolyte in the device remained in the solid state. As compared to the initial performance parameter, Jsc decreased by 4%, Voc remained almost the same, FF decreased by 2% and PCE decreased by 4% after one-sun soaking for 1000 h. These data indicate that the studied ssDSSC has a good long-term performance.
In summary, hydroxyethyl and ester co-functionalized imidazolium iodide has been designed and synthesized for use in ssDSSCs. When mixed with I2, LiI and NMBI, the ssDSSC with the all-solid-state electrolyte produced a power conversion efficiency of 6.27%. The efficiency further improved to 7.45% when a very small amount of MPII was included in the electrolyte to inhibit crystal growth. Our findings presented in this work pave a new way for the design of new solid state electrolytes towards high efficiency of ssDSSCs.
