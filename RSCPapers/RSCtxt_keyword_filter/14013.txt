    , Accepted 19th February 2018First published on 19th February 2018AbstractHybrid perovskites represent a potential paradigm shift for the creation of low-cost solar cells. Current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceed 22%. However, despite this, record PCEs are still far from their theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit of 31%. To increase these PCE values, there is a pressing need to understand, quantify and microscopically model charge recombination processes in full working devices. Here, we present a complete microscopic account of charge recombination processes in high efficiency (18–19% PCE) hybrid perovskite (mixed cation and methylammonium lead iodide) solar cells. We employ diffraction-limited optical measurements along with relevant kinetic modeling to establish, for the first time, local photoluminescence quantum yields, trap densities, trapping efficiencies, charge extraction efficiencies, quasi-Fermi-level splitting, and effective PCE estimates. Correlations between these spatially resolved parameters, in turn, allow us to conclude that intrinsic electron traps in the perovskite active layers limit the performance of these state-of-the-art hybrid perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Performance improvements in halide perovskite solar cells have outpaced all other technologies, yet they have only reached approximately two thirds of the theoretical limit for single junction solar cells. Significant room for improvement remains, therefore, a detailed scientific understanding of loss-mechanisms and device operation is required to guide research efforts and push this technology to its limit. In this work, we use a kinetic model of device operation along with sub-micrometer optical measurements to describe and map perovskite solar cell operation. An understanding of the present limiting factors, namely electron traps in the halide perovskite absorber, is developed, and an analysis technique is shown which can continue to guide perovskite solar cell research as this technology ascends even greater heights.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have achieved significant solar cell power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 22%1 due to their near-optimal optical and electrical properties.2,3 The reported PCEs are even more impressive given that hybrid perovskite solar cells are fully solution-processed. Nevertheless, bringing PCEs closer to their Shockley–Queisser limit of 31%4,5 requires better understanding of the charge recombination processes in complete, working hybrid perovskite solar cells given that dominant loss mechanisms in thin film absorbers6–10 do not necessarily coincide with those in complete solar cells.
Beyond reported EQEs and PCEs, substantially less mechanistic insight exists into the performance of high efficiency hybrid perovskite solar cells despite significant work on elucidating the fundamental optical properties of hybrid perovskites.11–25 This lack of microscopic insight is a consequence of multiple, simultaneously ongoing carrier recombination processes in devices. Examples include radiative recombination, carrier trapping, Auger recombination, ETL/HTL charge extraction, and interfacial recombination. All are problematic to disentangle using traditional impedance spectroscopy,26 time-of-flight (TOF),27 open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD),28 intensity-modulated photovoltage (IMVS)25 and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS).25 None of these techniques account for radiative losses. All-optical techniques such as emission lifetime6 and transient difference absorption spectroscopy,29,30 on the other hand, are not carried out under working (i.e., steady-state illumination) solar cell conditions. Moreover, the existence of local heterogeneities in the hybrid perovskite optical response6,7 necessitates spatially resolved measurements. Although photoconductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM)31,32 provides one such approach to overcoming these issues, it entails studying half cells, not complete devices. Hence, it cannot provide requisite information on critical interfacial processes, and can also introduce contact artifacts into the system. Thus, there has yet to be a quantitative analysis of the microscopic performance and loss mechanisms of state-of-the-art devices which is necessary to guide perovskite solar cells towards their Shockley–Queisser limit.
To establish this microscopic insight, we utilize continuous wave (CW) laser excitation intensity (Iexc)-dependent emission intensity (Iem) measurements on a representative ∼1 μm2 area of a complete device. Through appropriate kinetic modeling we reveal and quantify charge recombination processes in high efficiency, planar formamidinium/methylammonium/Cs lead iodide/bromide [FAMACs, precursor solution composition: (FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05)0.97Pb(I0.84Br0.16)2.97, MA = CH3NH3+, FA = CH(NH2)2+] and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) solar cells. We demonstrate how recombination mechanisms vary over a wide range of excitation intensities. At ∼1 Sun equivalent illumination, we show that FAMACs (MAPbI3) devices have radiative losses on the order of 2.0% (∼2.8%), electron trapping results in the recombination of 12% (∼7%) of the total excited carriers, while the remaining 86% (∼90%) of carriers are extracted into the electron and hole transport layers (ETL and HTL, respectively).
Spatially resolved Iemversus Iexc measurements are correlated to photocurrent (iph), and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements, all with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, to reveal how charge recombination processes influence the local photovoltaic response. This reveals uniform charge extraction at the ETL/HTL, in contrast to analogous mesoporous and inverted-planar devices, and shows that local photocurrent heterogeneities arise due to trap state density variations within perovskite absorber layers. This highlights electron trapping within perovskite layers as the current dominant mechanism limiting performance.
2. Carrier recombination in devices

Fig. 1a first shows a schematic of the FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells being studied with device cross-sectional scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) shown in Fig. 1b. In each case, the perovskite layer thickness is ∼500 nm with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTL and TiO2 as the ETL. Champion (average) PCEs are 18.76% (17.90%) and 17.83% (16.50%), respectively (Fig. 1c, see ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2 for device statistics). FAMACs and MAPbI3 films are made as described by Saliba et al.33 and Ahn et al.,34 respectively. Details can be found in the Methods section. Additional characterization of FAMACs and MAPbI3 films and solar cells, including atomic force micrographs, absorption, emission, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, can be found in ESI,† Note 2.

To establish a complete picture of carrier recombination in hybrid perovskite solar cells, we first employ diffraction-limited Iexc-dependent Iem measurements11,35–37 over a wide range of excitation intensities for both FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells. In all cases, the observed emission intensity growth order (i.e. the power law growth coefficient b in Iem ∝ Ibexc) establishes the dominant carrier recombination mechanism in a device at a given excitation intensity.11,33,34 For example, as derived in ESI,† Note 3, a growth exponent of b = 1.5 indicates trapping of a single carrier type, the identity of which can be ascertained through comparative studies involving selective electron/hole accepting layers (discussed below). Similarly, an exponent of b = 2.0 indicates trapping (or extraction into the ETL/HTL) of both carrier types whereas an exponent of b = 1.0 indicates bimolecular (radiative) recombination. Auger recombination is characterized by sublinear growth (b < 1.0).
Prior studies that we11 and others21,33,34 have conducted on MAPbI3 thin films establish carrier trap densities (Nt) between 1015–1018 cm−3.11,21,34 In the present work, a trap density of ∼1016 cm−3 is found for FAMACs films, a value on the lower end of experimental Nt-values and consistent with their high performance in devices (see ESI,† Note 6). Prior work has shown that observed Nt-values are spatially heterogeneous11 with the spatial extent of their variations generally exceeding the size of individual perovskite domains.11,38,39 The identity of hybrid perovskite carrier traps is consequently debated with suggestions regarding their origin including strong electron–phonon coupling,40 interstitial iodine defects,41 and the formation of Pb dimers and I trimers.42
As a critical step toward understanding and ultimately eliminating these trap states, Iemversus Iexc measurements have been conducted on bare perovskite films and those in contact with various ETLs or HTLs [for FAMACs, ETL: TiO2, HTL: spiro-OMeTAD; for MAPbI3, ETL: phenyl C60 butyric acid methyl ester, (PCBM); HTL: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate), (PEDOT:PSS)]. Growth exponents of b ∼ 1.5 (Iexc < 100 W cm−2; 1400 Sun equivalent) for both bare perovskite and perovskite/ETL films, indicative of trapping/extraction of one carrier type, and growth exponents of b ∼ 2.0 in perovskite/HTL films, indicative of trapping/extraction of both carrier types, reveal that the native carrier traps are electron traps in both FAMACs and MAPbI3 films (ESI,† Fig. S7). This conclusion is corroborated by recent literature involving Iexc-dependent photocurrent measurements in the presence of electron and hole acceptors.43
Having established the existence of native electron traps in both FAMACs and MAPbI3 films, Iemversus Iexc measurements have been conducted on FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells to establish the dominant carrier recombination processes in working devices. To accomplish this, a kinetic model previously employed for hybrid perovskite thin films11,33 is modified to include carrier extraction into ETL and HTL layers to accurately describe solar cell operation under open-circuit conditions. Fig. 2a summarizes the resulting model where relevant charge generation/recombination pathways include: (1) electron/hole generation, (2) bimolecular radiative recombination, (3) electron trapping, (4) electron recombination from native defects, (5) ETL electron extraction, (6) electron back interface recombination, (7) HTL hole extraction, and (8) hole back interface recombination. The corresponding kinetic equations describing these processes are (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)where G is the free carrier generation rate , n and p are the free electron and hole concentrations, nt is the trapped electron concentration, and nETL (nHTL) is the extracted electron (hole) concentration in the ETL (HTL). Other variables are described in Table 1.

Fig. 2b shows the resulting Iexc-dependent Iem data from a planar FAMACs device. Analogous data for a MAPbI3 cell can be found in ESI,† Fig. S8. The results show power-law Iem growth where at low excitation intensities (Iexc < 2 W cm−2, <28 Sun equivalent), b = 2.03. This indicates that carriers are efficiently extracted through both ETL and HTL injection. Electrons are additionally lost through trapping. With increasing intensity (Iexc > 2 W cm−2), b decreases to a value of b ∼ 1.0, indicating the onset of significant bimolecular, radiative recombination until Auger-mediated recombination begins to dominate at the very highest intensities (Iexc > 500 W cm−2), resulting in b < 1.0.11,32,33 Near identical behavior is seen for a MAPbI3 solar cell (ESI,† Fig. S8).

Fig. 2c shows Iexc-normalized FAMACs Iem values where Iem/Iexc can be fitted with numerical solutions of eqn (1)–(5) to extract Iexc-dependent concentrations for n, p, nt, nETL and nHTL. The ratio of electron–hole pairs undergoing radiative recombination (Iem = kb·n·p) to the initially photogenerated electron–hole pair concentration, G, then yields an expression for Iexc-dependent QYs. The solid red line in Fig. 2c is the resulting fit and reveals a maximum QY of 55% at Iexc = 60 W cm−2. For a similar MAPbI3 solar cell, a maximum QY of 58% is found at Iexc = 70 W cm−2 (ESI,† Fig. S8). Consequently, the data show that at monochromatic illumination intensities near one sun equivalent FAMACs (MAPbI3) solar cell QYs are on the order of ∼2.0% (∼2.7%). These values are comparable to state-of-the-art hybrid perovskite solar cell electroluminescence QYs.48 In general, device QYs are lower than those found in MAPbI3 thin films (1 Sun: 5–35%11,21,49) due to ETL/HTL charge extraction.
Beyond merely a measure of luminescence, the obtained QYs are significant because they can be used to determine the extent of quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) in the perovskite active layer. In this regard, QFLS is a representation of the maximum Voc attainable, before accounting for selective ETL/HTL contact losses. QFLS is calculated from QY using50 (6)where QFLSmax is the Shockley–Queisser maximum one sun Voc.51 For FAMACs (MAPbI3) with an optical band gap (Eg) of 1.57 (1.55) eV, as determined by Tauc analysis of the absorption spectrum, the QFLSmax = 1.28 (1.26) eV at 25 °C.49Eqn (6) shows that associated one sun QFLS-values for FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells are 1.18 and 1.17 eV respectively. These values are larger than measured FAMACs (MAPbI3) device Voc values (average Voc: FAMACs = 1.12 (±0.01) V; MAPbI3 = 1.05 (±0.02) V, indicating 60–120 mV losses at selective carrier contacts).49
The numerical fits above simultaneously enable device electron trapping and charge extraction fractions to be estimated. Fig. 2c shows the estimated FAMACs electron trapping fraction (dashed green line) found from φtrapping = kt·(Nt − nt)·n/G (process 3, Fig. 2a). At Iexc-values close to 1 Sun, φtrapping ∼ 12–13% (MAPbI3: φtrapping ∼ 6–7%). Carrier trapping thus accounts for a much smaller fraction of recombination losses in these working devices when compared to thin films where φtrapping ∼ 84% for FAMACs and φtrapping ∼ 94% for MAPbI3 (ESI,† Fig. S8) thin films.11 This decrease in trap-mediated recombination in full devices stems from efficient charge extraction into the ETL/HTL, which effectively competes with carrier trapping into native defects. As Iexc increases, trap saturation occurs, resulting in φtrapping values smaller than 5% for FAMACs devices at Iexc = 600 W cm−2 (MAPbI3: φtrapping < 2% at Iexc = 60 W cm−2).
The fraction of extracted electrons and holes into the ETL/HTL (φextraction) at Voc under steady-state conditions is likewise obtained by modeling φextraction as φextraction = [kETL·(NETL − nETL)·n + kHTL·(NHTL − nHTL)·p]/G (processes 5 and 7, Fig. 2a). Fig. 2c reveals that φextraction (dashed purple line, Fig. 2c) in FAMACs devices remains relatively constant up to Iexc = 1 W cm−2; one sun equivalent values are on the order of 86%. As Iexc increases, φextraction decreases (φextraction < 20% at Iexc ∼ 60 W cm−2) due to competition from bimolecular radiative and Auger-induced recombination. Analogous behavior occurs in MAPbI3 devices, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S8 (1 Sun φextraction ∼ 90%, φextraction < 20% at Iexc ∼ 60 W cm−2). Interrelationships between QY, φextraction and φtrapping are illustrated in ESI,† Fig. S13, which plots their dependencies as functions of Nt and an effective ETL/HTL extraction rate constant (kextraction, modeled as kETL due to the fact that n < p, Table 1, see ESI(†) for details).
3. Microscopic heterogeneity of device performance
While these measurements provide the first detailed and quantitative description of hybrid perovskite solar cell operation, they do not provide a complete, microscopic rendering of device performance. To accomplish this, we conduct spatially resolved measurements of photocurrent, iph, across 9.2 μm × 9.2 μm areas of devices. Fig. 3a first shows an iph map acquired for a FAMACs device. Clear photocurrent heterogeneity is evident with iph-values ranging from 4.75 to 6.00 nA [〈iph〉 = 5.29 (±0.21) nA]. The observed heterogeneity does not originate due to carrier generation (process 1, Fig. 2a) as the excitation laser penetration depth (∼100 nm, λexc = 520 nm) is much smaller than the film thickness (∼500 nm). As added verification, local reflectivity (R) measurements have been conducted on FAMACs and MAPbI3 devices. These measurements reveal no correlation between R and either Iem or iph (ESI,† Fig. S14).
 Fig. 3  Spatially resolved (a) iph, (b) τ- and (c) Iem-values for a planar FAMACs solar cell (λexc = 405 nm, 2.5 MHz, pump fluence = 30 nJ cm−2). (d) iph/τ, (e) Iem/τ, and (f) iph/Iem correlation plots. In all the correlation plots, horizontal error bars represent the averaged binned x-axis value interval while vertical lines represent the standard deviation of the y-axis values. 
Photocurrent heterogeneity due to lateral charge diffusion is also excluded given the geometry of the measurements conducted and devices studied relative to the expected dimensions of lateral diffusion. Specifically, one-dimensional Poisson modeling of fields within FAMACs/MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells shows depletion widths that extend over 300 nm.52,53 This is close to the thickness of the active perovskite layers being studied. Drift should therefore dominate diffusion. The conclusion is supported by recent literature observations for hybrid perovskites showing that photogenerated carriers preferentially undergo drift followed by ETL/HTL extraction rather than diffusion to neighboring lateral grains.54
We additionally observe significant shortening of FAMACs and MAPbI3 device PL lifetimes relative to their thin film values (ESI,† Fig. S15). This further corroborates the conclusion that drift dominates diffusion in devices. Fig. 3b and c provide details, showing both a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) lifetime map and an Iem-map of the same region probed in Fig. 3a. These results reveal clear spatial heterogeneity in τ as well as Iem. Fit-extracted (weighted biexponential) FAMACs lifetimes from Fig. 3b range from τ = 8.7–23.3 ns with an average lifetime of 〈τ〉 = 14.6 (±2.3) ns (for MAPbI3 solar cells, τ = 13.5–34.8 ns [〈τ〉 = 21.9 (±4.1) ns], see ESI,† Note 10). Fig. 3c shows near-identical ∼20% Iem variations. Details of the fitting as well as representative decay traces can be found in ESI,† Note 11.
As anticipated, the excited state lifetimes of the devices are up to 100 times shorter than the corresponding lifetimes in the absence of ETL/HTL contacts. More relevantly, comparing Fig. 3a and b reveals that τ correlates positively with iph (Fig. 3d); the regions that exhibit the largest iph-values are those which possess the largest lifetimes. This, and the significant shortening of PL lifetimes in devices, strongly indicates that drift followed by ETL/HTL extraction dominates lateral carrier diffusion. Consequently, the latter effect cannot be responsible for observed iph heterogeneities.
A closer study of the spatially resolved data in Fig. 3 reveals that Iem correlates positively with τ (Fig. 3e). Together with the positive correlation in Fig. 3d, it is apparent that a positive correlation exists between iph and Iem, explicitly illustrated in Fig. 3f. The regions that yield the largest photocurrents are also the most emissive. One would naively expect an inverse correlation between iph and Iem as charges that are extracted into the ETL/HTL do not recombine radiatively. The result is of particular significance because it is opposite to what has previously been reported in hybrid perovskite solar cells (to be discussed in detail below).6,7 How then is a positive iph/Iem correlation possible? As a possible resolution to this conundrum, the one parameter which connects all three variables is Nt. Nt impacts Iem and, by the same token, τ as illustrated by the analysis leading to Fig. 2c. It also impacts iph since it represents a competing charge recombination pathway to ETL/HTL extraction.
The fact that all of these factors, iph, τ and Iem are related to Nt qualitatively rationalizes how regions that show higher carrier recombination (shorter lifetimes) also show reduced photocurrent and emission intensities. However, to directly address this hypothesis and to conclusively establish the origin of the observed iph and Iem heterogeneities, we conduct spatially resolved Nt measurements. As demonstrated earlier in Fig. 2, these measurements simultaneously yield QY, φtrapping, φextraction and QFLS from local fitting of Iemversus Iexc data. In combination with local iph-values, what results is a microscopic picture of these processes and properties in a complete, working perovskite solar cell with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

Fig. 4a shows a resulting Nt-map which encompasses a 10 μm × 10 μm active area of a FAMACs device. Electron Nt-values range from 5.39 × 1015–6.00 × 1017 cm−3. The average trap density is 〈Nt〉 = 1.51 × 1016 (±1.13 × 1016) cm−3. These values agree well with FAMACs thin film measurements (ESI,† Fig. S12) and with the prior MAPbI3 literature where Nt-values range from 1.0 × 1016–1.0 × 1018 cm−3.11,21,33,34,55

The corresponding PCEeff-values are shown using the right y-axis. (e) Correlation plot between QY and Nt-values. (f) Correlation plot between iph and QY-values. In all the correlation plots, horizontal error bars represent x-axis bin widths considered while vertical bars represent the standard deviation of the y-axis values. 

Fig. 4b shows a corresponding one sun equivalent QY map along with the associated QFLS values (eqn (6)). Fig. 4c shows an iph-map for the same 10 μm × 10 μm region. Both Fig. 4b and c reveal spatial heterogeneities in FAMACs device metrics where in the former case, the FAMACs device QYs are heterogeneous and range from 0.43–2.83% [〈QY〉 = 1.51 (±0.43)%]. The QFLS values likewise range from 1.14–1.19 eV with an average value of 〈QFLS〉 = 1.18 (±0.01) eV. In the latter case, photocurrent heterogeneity is evident with iph-values ranging from 6.86–10.90 nA [〈iph〉 = 9.25 (±0.72) nA].
We can assess PCE heterogeneities in high efficiency perovskite solar cells by using the spatially resolved data in Fig. 4b and c to generate an effective PCE (PCEeff) map. To this end, a maximum (single excitation wavelength) power, Pmax, map is first defined as the product of QFLS and iph, i.e. Pmax = QFLS × iph (Fig. 4d). Fig. 4d shows the resulting Pmax map where large spatial heterogeneities exist with values ranging from 7.82–12.97 nW [〈Pmax〉 = 10.91 (±0.90) nW]. PCEeff is then generated using PCEeff = FF × Pmax/Pexc with FF = 0.74, the FAMACs fill-factor obtained from earlier device level measurements (ESI,† Fig. S1), and Pexc the employed excitation power which takes into account reflection losses (λexc = 520 nm, Pexc ∼ 47.5 nW).
The resulting PCEeff values are not directly equivalent to local AM1.5G PCE values. In this regard, Pexc is for monochromatic light. Consequently, there are different device spectral and thermal losses here than under simulated solar irradiation. Furthermore, the analysis assumes that (i) QFLS is equivalent to local Voc – an assumption which does not account for voltage losses related to ETL/HTL contact interfaces – and (ii) that FF is spatially uniform. Despite these qualifications, Fig. 4d strongly suggests that FAMACs PCEs are highly heterogeneous, even in state-of-the-art devices, with PCEeff values varying by more than 7% across device active areas. Comparative (local) performance metrics for the circled black and green regions in Fig. 4, illustrating this, are summarized in ESI,† Note 12.
Correlations between the measured parameters in Fig. 4(a–c) point out the root causes of PCEeff variations. Namely, we find that Nt and QY (Iem) vary inversely with trap rich (poor) regions exhibiting relatively small (large) QYs (Fig. 4e), indicating that carrier trapping into native defects is efficient. The data also reveals the positive QY/iph correlation (Fig. 4f), first seen in Fig. 3f. Identical correlations are found for a similar MAPbI3 solar cell (ESI,† Fig. S18). As alluded to earlier, these positive QY(Iem)/iph correlations are opposite to what has previously been reported for mesoporous and inverted-planar MAPbI3 devices.6,7 They are nevertheless not artifacts of the measurements since ESI,† Fig. S19 reveals inverse QY(Iem)/iph correlations measured by us for both mesoporous (PCE ∼ 14%) and inverted-planar (PCE ∼ 10%) MAPbI3 solar cells (see Methods section for details on construction/characterization). A diagram illustrating all the device structures studied can be found in the ESI.†
Positive QY/iph correlations are consistent with carrier extraction rate constants (i.e. kextraction) remaining relatively uniform across ETL/HTL and active layer interfaces whereas prior studies on mesoporous and inverted-planar hybrid perovskite devices6,7 attribute inverse QY/iph correlations to spatial variations in perovskite/corresponding ETL/HTL kextraction values. This results in significant φextraction variations and, as a direct result, substantial heterogeneities in local iph-values. A positive QY/iph correlation, on the other hand, suggests that kextraction remains largely uniform across the planar FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells. This is confirmed by the developed kinetic model (Fig. 2a) wherein keeping kextraction constant and varying Nt necessarily results in a positive QY/iph correlation (ESI,† Fig. S13a). In contrast, varying kextraction for a constant Nt immediately results in an inverse QY/iph correlation (ESI,† Fig. S13b).
Within the current study, performance bottleneck differences between planar, mesoporous and inverted-planar devices can be attributed to their different perovskite/charge transport layer interfaces. In the case of mesoporous devices we have studied, local voids likely exist between the compact TiO2 layer and the hybrid perovskite. These voids can therefore act as barriers for charge injection, leading to heterogeneous kextraction values. A similar scenario is envisioned for inverted-planar devices where PEDOT:PSS layers may not be uniform.
4. Conclusions
These spatially resolved, optical and electrical measurements thus reveal, for the first time, both the microscopic workings and ultimate limitations of current, high efficiency, hybrid perovskite solar cells. The data and accompanying modeling thus suggest that ETL/HTL contact issues, which lead to φextraction heterogeneities, are not responsible for the observed heterogeneity in state-of-the-art planar FAMACs/MAPbI3 solar cells, in contrast to what is found in other device architectures. Rather, our analysis points to local Nt variations as the origin of the observed performance heterogeneities. In brief, Nt-influenced carrier trapping, which has been identified as electron trapping, results in regions of locally suppressed QY. Enhanced carrier trapping then decreases associated excited state lifetimes. This leads to inverse Nt/QY and positive QY/τ correlations. Simultaneously, kextraction uniformity, due to the existence of high quality extraction layer interfaces, means that large photocurrents are kinetically associated with emissive regions of a device. When taken in aggregate, the data and accompanying analysis identify electron trapping as the origin of performance heterogeneities in planar FAMACs/MAPbI3 solar cells, and, more relevantly, indicate that Nt is what currently limits perovskite solar cell PCEs.
5. Methods
Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI), methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br, MABr), formamidinium iodide [CH(NH2)2, FAI], and the cobalt complex Co[t-BuPyPz]3[TFSI]3 (FK209) were purchased from Dyesol and used as received. Lead(II) iodide (99.9985% metals basis) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Lumtec. PEDOT:PSS (Al 4083) and PCBM were purchased from Ossila. All other chemicals [CsI (99.999%), (TBP, (4-tert-butylpyradine), TAA, (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)), DMF, DMSO)] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received.
Solar cell fabrication
Patterned fluorine doped tin oxide substrates (Thin Film Devices) were washed by sonication in acetone and isopropanol, then cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 15 minutes. The TiO2 electron transport layer was deposited onto cleaned substrates by spin-coating a 0.15 M solution of TAA in butanol with the following program: 700 rpm, 10 s; 1000 rpm, 10 s; 2000 rpm, 30 s. The films were then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h to form a compact, TiO2 film approximately 40 nm thick.
Immediately before perovskite film deposition, TiO2 films were cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 15 minutes and were transferred directly into a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox. MAPbI3 was deposited following the procedure first reported by Ahn et al.34 Briefly, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 461 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of MAI in 78 mg of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 600 mg of dimethylformamide (DMF). This solution was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 25 s. After the substrate had been spinning for approximately 10 s, 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was rapidly dispensed onto the spinning film, forming a uniform, colorless film. Samples were subsequently annealed in the glovebox at 100 °C for 3 minutes to form highly specular MAPbI3 films. Similarly, FAMACs, mixed cation films were formed following the method developed by Saliba et al.33 Briefly, the precursor solution was made by dissolving 172 mg of FAI, 507 mg of PbI2, 22.4 mg of MABr, and 73.4 mg of PbBr2 (1.0:1.1:0.2:0.2 mole ratio) and 40 μL of CsI stock solution (1.5 M in DMSO) in 627 mg of DMF and 183 mg of DMSO (4:1 v/v). This solution was deposited by spin-coating with the following program: 1000 rpm, 10 s; 6000 rpm, 20 s. With approximately 6 s remaining in this spin-coating procedure, 0.1 mL of chlorobenzene was rapidly dispensed onto the spinning film, forming a uniform, orange film. The films were subsequently annealed in the glovebox at 100 °C for 60 minutes to form highly specular FAMACs films.
After annealing, the substrates were allowed to cool to room temperature for ∼1 minute and then spiro-OMeTAD was deposited by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution consisted of 72 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of TBP, 17.5 μL of a bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 29 μL of a tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)-tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209) stock solution (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The films were stored in a desiccator overnight and were then completed by the thermal evaporation of 100 nm of Au.
Characterization
FAMACs and MAPbI3 solar cells (active area ∼0.1 cm2) were masked with a metal aperture to an area of 0.059 cm2. Device performance was assessed using a Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination using a KG2 filtered Si reference solar cell certified by NREL. Current–voltage scans were taken with the following scan parameters: step size = 10 mV, delay time = 10 ms, number of power line cycles = 0.01. The stabilized power output was recorded by measuring the current output of the illuminated device at a constant bias voltage. External quantum efficiency measurements were taken with a Newport Oriel IQE 200 instrument. Scanning electron microscopy images were taken using a FEI Nova NanoSEM 630. Topographic AFM images were recorded in a Park XE-70 system in intermittent-contact mode using Tap300-G cantilevers from BudgetSensors.
MAPbI3, MAPbI3|ETL and MAPbI3|HTL fabrication
148.7 mg of PbI2 was dissolved in 700 μL of γ-butyrolactone (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) to create a 0.1 M solution. 52.3 mg of MAI (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) was likewise dissolved in 300 μL of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) to create a 0.1 M solution. The two solutions were then mixed together for 30 minutes at 70 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox. In parallel, glass coverslips were cleaned in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 90%) for 30 minutes followed by a 5 minute UV-ozone plasma cleaning step. Perovskite films were made by spin coating the mixed PbI2/MAI solution onto cleaned coverslips at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Drops of toluene were subsequently added while spinning to solvent-anneal the film. The films were annealed at 110 °C for 30 minutes under N2 in a glovebox. For MAPbI3|ETL films a thin layer of PCBM was spin coated on top of the perovskite layer at 5000 rpm for 45 s. For MAPbI3|HTL films, a layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto glass substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s prior to perovskite layer deposition.

I
exc-Dependent emission measurements
Emission intensities were collected as a function of excitation intensity using a 405 nm CW laser [Coherent, Obis] focused onto samples using a high numerical aperture (NA) objective (Zeiss, 0.65 NA). Neutral density filters were used to adjust Iexc. Nt maps were generated by ramping Iexc (Iexc = 0.5–25 W cm−2) at every point of the 10 μm × 10 μm image. Each point encompasses an approximate 125 × 125 nm2 region of the device active area with scans carried out using a three axis closed loop piezo stage (Mad City Labs). At each point, the resulting emission was collected with the same objective, using a barrier filter (Chroma, HQ 680LP) to reject the laser. The emission was subsequently detected with a single photon counting avalanche photodiode (PerkinElmer, SPCM AQR-14). A shot noise limited photodiode (PH200, Highland Technology) was used to simultaneously monitor the laser power which was then used to calculate Iexc.
Spatially resolved iph measurements
At each point of an area map, the associated iph flowing through the device under local illumination (λexc = 520 nm CW, Iexc ∼ 400 mW cm−2) was measured using a pico-amperemeter (Keithley, 4780). The current was sampled at 50 kHz with an integration time of 0.1 s. The average photocurrent was subsequently recorded and was used to build iph-maps.
Spatially resolved reflectivity measurements
Spatially resolved reflectivity maps were acquired using the same home-built microscope described above. At each point during a scan, reflected light was recorded with an APD (PerkinElmer, SPCM AQR-14). A barrier filter (Edmund Optics, 640SP) was used to reject any emission.
Spatially resolved TCSPC measurements
Spatially resolved TCSPC measurements were carried out on the same home-built microscope. A pulsed 405 nm diode laser (PicoQuant, pulse FWHM ∼ 70 ps, repetition rate = 2.5 MHz) was used as the excitation source. The emission was collected with the same APD as above and the signal sent to a PicoHarp 300 unit. The integration time at each pixel was set to 1 s. Obtained decays were fit to biexponential functions. A weighted lifetime was then used to build τ-maps (see ESI† for details).

Broader context
Performance improvements in halide perovskite solar cells have outpaced all other technologies, yet they have only reached approximately two thirds of the theoretical limit for single junction solar cells. Significant room for improvement remains, therefore, a detailed scientific understanding of loss-mechanisms and device operation is required to guide research efforts and push this technology to its limit. In this work, we use a kinetic model of device operation along with sub-micrometer optical measurements to describe and map perovskite solar cell operation. An understanding of the present limiting factors, namely electron traps in the halide perovskite absorber, is developed, and an analysis technique is shown which can continue to guide perovskite solar cell research as this technology ascends even greater heights.

 	Fig. 3  Spatially resolved (a) iph, (b) τ- and (c) Iem-values for a planar FAMACs solar cell (λexc = 405 nm, 2.5 MHz, pump fluence = 30 nJ cm−2). (d) iph/τ, (e) Iem/τ, and (f) iph/Iem correlation plots. In all the correlation plots, horizontal error bars represent the averaged binned x-axis value interval while vertical lines represent the standard deviation of the y-axis values.	 

 	Fig. 4  Spatially resolved FAMACs (a) Nt-values, (b) one sun equivalent QYs and QFLS values, (c) iph-values (λexc = 520 nm, CW, Iexc ∼ 500 mW cm−2), and (d) Pmax-values where Pmax is defined as QFLS × iph. The corresponding PCEeff-values are shown using the right y-axis. (e) Correlation plot between QY and Nt-values. (f) Correlation plot between iph and QY-values. In all the correlation plots, horizontal error bars represent x-axis bin widths considered while vertical bars represent the standard deviation of the y-axis values.
