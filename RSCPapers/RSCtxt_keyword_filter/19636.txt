    , Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 8th January 2016AbstractHybrid materials based on perfluorophenyl functionalized quinolines directly attached onto the sp2 hybridized surface of carbon nanostructures have been prepared and studied herein along with their precursor semiconducting small molecules. Tails of different polarities have been used so that the molecules would present improved solubility and controllable affinity for the selected substrates. These materials were evaluated for their electronic and electrochemical properties for potential application in organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs), using UPS, XPS and CV measurements after deposition onto oxygen plasma cleaned Si wafers or solvent treated ITO coated glass. A weak interaction between the fluorine atoms and both the Si and the ITO substrates was observed by XPS. The extent of this interfacial interaction was found to be related to the orientation of the quinoline moieties on the organic layer. Moreover, the combination of XPS and UPS analyses showed that the absolute energy value of the HOMO level increased as the amount of surface fluorine atoms increased. CV measurements revealed that hybridisation of the small molecules with carbon nanostructures decreases the materials' energy gap and increases the absolute energy value of the LUMO level. These features prove the efficiency of the proposed method to produce materials with controlled energy levels for solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells comprising blends of solution-processed organic polymers have attracted great scientific interest since they were introduced in 1995.1,2 This is due to the large potential of the BHJ technology and the prospect to deliver efficient low-cost solar cells that could present an alternative to the conventional Si-based photovoltaics. The main advantage of the BHJ technology lays in the solution based fabrication methods that combine simplicity and low cost, alleviating the need for expensive instrumentation. Furthermore, with this technology, monolithic devices can be produced on virtually any type of substrate, rigid or flexible.3 Although significant progress has been achieved in recent decades, leading to devices with acceptable power conversion efficiencies, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed, such as long term stability issues,4 the environmental impact of the materials and processes used, and the development of roll-to-roll fabrication methods suitable for industrial production.3,5 The continuous effort to improve the BHJ materials has led to enhancements in device efficiency (currently being around 10%) and also to the better understanding of the pertinent physical processes.6 The most prominent material combination is the mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene):1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C61 (P3HT:PCBM). However, the development of new families of suitable polymers is still ongoing, and different synthetic routes are currently being investigated.7,8 Also a new and promising group of fullerenic derivatives have been presented, as an alternative to PCBM electron acceptors, contributing to an increase of the efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells. Namely, the indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) and the indene–C60 monoadduct (ICMA) are currently ideal solutions for electron acceptors to be used with polythiophene.9,10 Beside these indene fullerene adducts, a vast variety of hybrids based on modified fullerenes have been synthesized and studied for their electronic properties but only a few have been used in OPVs. In addition to the fullerene derivatives, modified materials with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be foreseen either as active materials or more importantly as transparent electrodes.11–15 More specifically, CNTs may replace conducting oxides because of their excellent chemical and mechanical properties and their high conductivity. Perhaps the most appealing properties of CNTs' for their incorporation into OPVs are their enhanced charge carrier collection and transport ability along with low resistivity.
In general, carbon nanostructured materials that are used either within the active layer of a BHJ solar cell or as electrode materials are functionalized with organic moieties in order to induce their processability, their miscibility, and their compatibility with other device components. Moreover, their modification with organic components is an efficient way to modulate their electronic properties. Therefore, understanding the effect of different organic, functional groups used for the modification of carbon nanostructures (fullerenes or nanotubes) on their final chemical and electronic properties as well as their affinity for different types of substrates used in solar cell device construction is of fundamental importance.
Consequently in this study, pentafluorophenylquinoline molecules bearing tails of different polarity were used in an effort to study their influence on the electronic properties of hybrid materials comprising fullerenes or CNTs as carbon nanostructures. The organic moieties' relation to the final hybrids' affinity for different substrates was also evaluated. Based on an efficient methodology that has been recently reported for the direct attachment of perfluorophenyl functionalized organic moieties onto the sp2 hybridized surface of fullerene species,16 new hybrids based on semiconducting moieties and carbon nanostructures have been synthesized in the present work and their electronic properties and orientation towards specific substrates are investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The starting perfluorophenyl functionalized phenyl-(Ph-5FQ), dodecyloxybiphenyl-(C12(Ph)2-5FQ), and hydroxyphenyl-(HOPh-5FQ) substituted perfluorophenyl-quinolines17–19 and their hybrids with C60,16 4-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)phenylboronic acid20 were synthesized according to literature procedures. Fullerene, carbon 60, 99.5% was purchased from SES research. MWCNTs were from Nanothinx S.A.

Synthesis of the hydroxyphenyl-perfluorophenyl-phenyl quinoline–MWCNT hybrid, HOPh-5FQ-N-MWCNT. 
A 100 mL round bottom flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer, was degassed (flamed under vacuum) and filled with argon. MWCNTs (100 mg) and 20 mL 1,2-dichlobenzene were added and the mixture was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. HO-Ph-5FQ-N3 (20 mg, 0.41 mmol) was added and the mixture was degassed and flushed with argon again. The reaction mixture was stirred at 140 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting mixture was vacuum-filtered through a Nylon 200 nm membrane. The obtained solid was washed with 1,2-dichlobenzene, N,N′-dimethylformamide and acetone for further purification. The solid was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 2 days yielding 110 mg of hybrid.

2.2. Instruments and procedures

ATR measurements. 
Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) spectra were recorded on a “Bruker Optics' Alpha-P Diamond ATR Spectrometer of Bruker Optics GmbH”.


TGA analysis. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on ∼8 mg samples contained in alumina crucibles in a Labsys TM TG apparatus of Setaram under nitrogen and at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.


UV-Vis & PL measurements. 
UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-1800 spectrophotometer Continuous wave photoluminescence was measured on a Perkin Elmer LS45 spectrofluorometer.


Si substrate; O2-plasma treatment. 
Plasma treatment of the Si wafers took place in a medium vacuum chamber at P = 10−2 mbar O2 and rf power 10.5 W.


ITO substrate. 
Commercial ITO coated glass films were washed in an ultrasonic bath with methanol for approximately 5 min and then dried in air at 60 °C for 10 min.


Deposition of organic materials. 
After substrate treatment, a drop of the monomer solution (3 mg mL−1 in o-DCB), was spin coated (2000 rpm) on the Si wafer or the ITO coated glass and the sample was introduced into the UHV chamber for XPS and UPS analyses.


XPS and UPS measurements. 
X-ray and Ultra Violet Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with a SPECS LHS-10 hemispherical electron analyzer. The un-monochromatized AlKα (1486.6 eV) line was used for the XPS measurements. The surface atomic ratios were calculated from the intensity (area) of the XPS peaks weighted with the corresponding relative sensitivity factors (RSF). The ratios presented here have been adjusted, to account for the fact that the signal originates from an ultra-thin layer. An example of the correction factor, f, calculation is shown in the ESI.† It can be seen that for a film as thin as 4 nm the necessary adjustment of the surface atomic ratio is about 10%. This is reduced for thicker films and is eliminated for film thicknesses higher than 10–12 nm. The experimental error for all surface atomic ratios is estimated to be ±0.05.
The UPS spectra were obtained using HeI irradiation with hν = 21.23 eV produced by a UV source (model UVS 10/35). The energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) was calculated from the sum of the measured energy values of the work function (Φ) and the HOMO cut off at the low binding energy (BE) side of the spectra. The work function was determined by subtracting the width of the UPS spectra (i.e. the energy difference between the analyser Fermi level and the high binding energy cutoff) from the HeI excitation energy. For these measurements a bias of −12.3 V was applied to the sample in order to avoid interference of the spectrometer threshold in the UPS spectra.


Electrochemical measurements. 
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out with using an Autolab PGSTAT 302Ν electrochemical analyzer connected to a personal computer running NOVA 1.8 software. A three electrode cell was used, consisting of a platinum wire counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and an ITO/Glass working electrode with the polymer to be measured drop-casted on the ITO conductive side. Tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6 0.1 M in acetonitrile (CH3CN)) was used as a supporting electrolyte. In order to prevent the ingress of water traces in the solution, 99.99% HPLC grade acetonitrile was used with molecular sieves and moisture indicators, and the TBAPF6 salt was preheated at 80 °C for 20 min. Furthermore, the glass vessel and electrodes were preheated at 80 °C for 20 min. Before carrying out the measurements the electrochemical cell was purged with pure argon for 20 min to remove diluted gasses. The electrochemical cell was hermetically sealed during the CV runs. To ensure that no parasitic peaks were present, “zero” CV measurements were performed at regular intervals, with use of the electrochemical set-up and an ITO coated glass as a working electrode. The reference electrode potential was calibrated against Ferrocene/Ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) after each voltammetry run.21 For the electrochemical measurements, thin films of the above materials were drop casted on ITO coated glass slides (Rsheet < 15 Ω per square) preheated at 80 °C for 20 min, from precursor solutions of toluene. The resulting films were further annealed at 80 °C for 15 min. The energy gap (Eg) was determined by cyclic voltammetry with use of the redox onset potentials as follows: Eg = e(Eoxons − Eredons)(1) The HOMO and LUMO levels can also be estimated with use of the redox onset potentials. However, solvent, temperature, scan rate and working electrode effects22,23 on reference potentials with respect to the normal Hydrogen electrode (NHE) cause significant uncertainties in the calculated HOMO and LUMO values. For example, large discrepancies of the Fc/Fc+ potential versus NHE are reported in the literature, ranging from 0.2 V24 to 0.63 V.25 In order to avoid this problem, the HOMO value calculated by UPS was used as reference, and the LUMO level was deduced from the difference between the HOMO and Eg values.


Transmission electron microscopy measurements. 
TEM measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM2100 operating at 200 kV. Dilute solutions of the initial functionalized perfluorophenylquinolines in THF and of their respective hybrids with C60 in toluene were filtrated through a 0.45 μm filter. The TEM sample for the MWCNT hybrid was prepared using ethanol as solvent and sonicated at least for 5 min. A drop of the solution was placed on 3 mm carbon coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and the samples were dried in air for 2 days.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material development
Quinoline based semiconducting species with variable structural characteristics as well as their fullerene or carbon nanotube hybrids were studied here. The structural variations used were the different tails that these species possess. More specifically, the reactive and at the same time hydrophobic perfluorophenyl group was used as the one tail in all cases since this enables the attachment of the organic moieties onto carbon nanostructure's surface.16 The other tail of the molecule is varied from the nonpolar phenyl group to the polar phenol end and finally to the hydrophobic dodecyloxybiphenyl group. The studied Ph-5FQ, C12(Ph)2-5FQ initial materials and their respective hybrids with C60 have been synthesized and characterized for their structural and optical properties previously.16 In this work, the phenol functionalized perfluorophenyl–phenylquinoline (HOPh-5FQ) derivative has been employed. Thus, its azide derivative HOPh-5FQ-N3 reacted with C60 or MWCNTs providing the final HOPh-5FQ-hybrids (Scheme 1). The HOPh-5FQ-N-C60 hybrid was washed with toluene several times in order to remove any C60 traces. The purification process was verified by ATR spectroscopy of the purified hybrid material versus the crude reaction product (Fig. 1). After the cycloaddition reaction the characteristic peak for the azide group at ∼2100 cm−1 disappeared and the characteristic absorbance bands for C60 at ∼450–790 cm−1 and 1424 cm−1 were observed. After purification of HOPh-5FQ-N-C60 the intensity of the fullerene peaks decreased and remained constant in any further purification step. TGA analysis for both the C60 and MWCNT hybrids was performed thereafter as shown in Fig. 2. The final hybrids presented higher thermal stability compared to the initial HOPh-5FQ-N3. Based on the HOPh-5FQ-N-MWCNT residue at 800 °C a quantitative analysis of the CNT content was performed and it was found that for every about 70 carbon atoms of the nanotube core there is one HOPh-5FQ moiety.

3.2. Optical properties
The optical properties of the perfluorophenyl functionalized quinolines with phenyl-(Ph-5FQ), and dodecyloxybiphenyl-(C12(Ph)2-5FQ) tails and their respective hybrids with C60 are reported elsewhere.16 The optical properties of the newly synthesized HOPh-5FQ-N3 and its hybrid materials with C60 and CNTs in film form are depicted in Fig. 3. The UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 3) of the HOPh-5FQ-N-MWCNT shows the characteristic absorbance peaks for the HOPh-5FQ group at 280 nm and 350 nm, respectively. In the HOPh-5FQ-N-C60 case the absorbance spectrum presents a minor shift to higher wavelengths compared to the initial HOPh-5FQ-N3. Fig. 4 presents the PL spectra of the HOPh-5FQ hybrids after excitation at (a) 280 nm and (b) 350 nm. As can been seen, there is a quenching of the quinoline's luminescence after the attachment of the carbon nanostructures for both hybrid materials. It should be noted that similar optical properties were observed in the case of the Ph-5FQ-N-C60 and C12-(Ph)2-5FQ-N-C60 hybrids.16

Morphological characterization via TEM was performed for all initial functionalized perfluorophenyl quinolines and their respective hybrids (Fig. SM1, ESI†). All fullerene hybrid molecules with C60 (Fig. SM1b, d and f, ESI†) produced uniform films in the nanometer scale without the formation of aggregates or C60 clusters.
3.3. Surface characterisation
For the surface characterisation the organic compounds were deposited in the form of thin films on Si wafers and ITO coated glass substrates.
It is well established that ex situ surface treatments such as processing in solvents or plasma treatment can affect the substrate's surface energy and consequently the bonding characteristics of the organic materials.26 For both ITO and Si substrates, solvent cleaning is one of the most conventional methods for the removal of surface contaminants. Methanol treatment of ITO films is known to lead to the highest total surface energy.27
Oxygen plasma treatment of Si wafers is a well-known method for ex situ etching away of carbon contaminants and maintaining the substrate's wettability.28,29 The treatment results in high density of surface –HO groups and consequently in the increase of surface energy30 which is expected to have a higher impact on the surface distribution of the organic molecules.
The effect of oxygen plasma substrate treatment on the quality of the organic layer was investigated by XPS using the Ph-5FQ molecule as a case study. The results from this investigation are shown in the ESI† where it can be seen that surface carbon contamination affects (i) the wettability and hence the homogeneity of the deposited organic layer and (ii) the quality of the carbon signal itself. As the analysis of carbon-related spectroscopic features by XPS and UPS is critical for the present study, oxygen plasma treatment is adopted as a standard ex situ cleaning procedure for the Si wafers used as substrates.

3.3.1 XPS characterisation of single and hybridised molecules. 
In this section the surface chemistry of different small molecules HOPh-5FQ, C12(Ph)2-5FQ and Ph-5FQ and their hybrids with C60 or MWCNTs deposited on plasma treated Si wafers and methanol treated ITO is investigated by XPS.
The phenol functionalized pentafluorophenylquinoline molecule HOPh-5FQ with the polar hydroxyl end group has been selected as an example to demonstrate the XPS analysis procedure and peak assignment. The molecule was deposited on ITO-coated glass and on oxygen plasma treated Si substrates. Both samples were studied at two detection angles (0 and 45°). The XP C1s, F1s and N1s spectra at 0° (a) and 45° (b) detection angles are shown in Fig. 5 for the ITO substrate and in Fig. 6 for the Si substrate. The XPS C1s peaks in all cases (Fig. 5I and 6I) can be analyzed into three components, all with FWHM = 1.5 eV, at BE = 285 eV assigned to the C–C bonds in the molecule's backbone, at BE = 286.5 and BE = 288 eV assigned to C–O (or C–OH) and C–F bonds in the perfluorophenyl ring.
 Fig. 5  XPS C1s, F1s and N1s spectra of HOPh-5FQ on ITO at (a) 0° and (b) 45° detection angles. 
 Fig. 6  XPS C1s, F1s and N1s spectra of HOPh-5FQ on Si at (a) 0° and (b) 45° detection angles. 
The XPS N1s (Fig. 5III and 6III) peak is detected at 399.2 eV in all cases and is attributed to N-atoms in the quinoline structure.31 The F1s XPS peaks (Fig. 5II) are analyzed into two components with FWHM = 1.5 eV. One of them, Fc, at 688.3 eV (±0.1) is assigned to fluorine atoms in the C–F bonds of the perfluorophenyl ring.32,33 The origin of the other component, Fi, which appears at lower binding energy 687.5 eV (±0.1) becomes clearer after the analysis of the spectra at 45° detection angle, an orientation that provides higher surface sensitivity.
In Table 1 it can be seen that when the measurement is more surface sensitive (45°) the Fi/Fc ratio decreases on both substrates indicating that Fi originates from fluorine atoms that exist mainly in the lower surface layers closer to the interface. Their lower binding energy indicates a weak interaction with the substrate that seems to occur on both Si and ITO.

The term ‘weak’ is used in order to differentiate from direct fluorination, which would lead to even lower BE values for the Fi component.34 F1s components at similar BEs (687.4 and 687.9 eV) were observed by M. Brzhezinskaya et al.35 and attributed to fluorine atoms on fluorinated single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, respectively. Annealing had caused a gradual shift of that peak to a final value of 686 eV which was explained by the complete nanotube's defluorination accompanied by fluorination of the sample's Fe substrate with the formation of a new FeFx phase.
The effective charge of the fluorine atom in the F–C bond is negative and varies in a limited range of 0 to −1 when the atom's chemical state changes. A weak interfacial interaction i.e. a small change in the valence electron density in a fluorine atom is accompanied, due to its participation in chemical bonding with carbon atoms, by a weak change in screening of F1s core level electrons by valence electrons, which manifests itself in small values of chemical shifts of F1s electron binding energies.
The C1s or substrate photoelectron spectra do not reveal any measurable new contribution from this new phase of F atoms and the shift of the F1s peak towards the lower binding energies is relatively small (0.8 eV). Such behaviour of the F1s peak is consistent with its interpretation as a signal from fluorine atoms forming a substrate–fluorine–carbon phase with fluorine–carbon chemical bond weaker than the bond in the quinoline. It has to be mentioned here that the BE of the interfacial F1s component (Fi) remains unchanged on both Si and ITO substrates and for all the samples studied, indicating that the strength of the interaction is similar.
In the case of the Si substrate the Fi:Fc ratio is twice as high compared to that on the ITO and the interfacial component is measurable at both 0 and 45° detection angles while on the ITO it disappears at 45°. This could be attributed to different arrangement of the molecules on Si and ITO. More specifically, the higher intensity of the interfacial component and its small change at 45° implies extended interaction and a more homogenous distribution of the molecule on the high surface energy Si wafer compared to a possibly more cluster-like distribution on the ITO substrate.

Table 1 shows that the F:C and F:N surface atomic ratios are higher than nominal in all cases indicating that the surfaces are fluorine terminated and the quinoline group has a similar orientation for both samples.
The normalised F:N and F:C surface atomic ratios together with the ratio of the F1s components Fi/Fc are shown for all the molecules deposited on plasma treated Si are shown in Table 2.

The normalised ratio values have been calculated by dividing the actual F:C (or F:N) ratio with the nominal value for every molecule. Normalised F:C ratios with values >1 indicate F-terminated surfaces. For example, the normalised F:C ratios for HOPh-5FQ is >1 indicating that the surface is F-terminated while the Ph-5FQ surface (normalised F:C = 0.7) is not.
Further insight into the interfacial interactions between the molecules and the substrates is given in Fig. 7 which shows the Fi:Fc ratio as a function of the normalised F:N ratio. Changes in the latter indicate changes to the relative positions between F and N atoms in the film i.e. in the orientation of the quinoline moiety on the substrate. This, as shown in Fig. 7, affects the extent of the interfacial interaction which decreases as F:N increases.

The strength of the interaction is not affected by the molecule type as the Binding Energy of the Fi components is the same for all compounds.

3.4. Electronic properties
UPS spectra of the initial molecules and the final hybrids of the perfluorophenyl-phenyl quinolines deposited on ITO are presented in Fig. 8B. A zoom in the Fermi level and the HOMO cut off area is shown in Fig. 8A while Fig. 8C zooms in the high binding energy cut off from which the work function is calculated for each sample.

The absolute energy value of the HOMO level (or Ionisation Potential, IP) is calculated by adding the energy values of the work function and the HOMO cut off (Ev).
The UPS spectra appear to shift considerably from sample to sample. This is obvious especially in Fig. 8C. Part of this shift is due to the chemical differences between the samples, but another part of it could be due to electrostatic charging that can occur during the UPS measurements. Electrostatic charging would cause the shift of the whole UPS spectrum towards higher BEs, leading to erroneously higher Ev and lower (by the same amount) work function values. Nevertheless electrostatic charging does not affect the accurate calculation of the absolute energy value of the HOMO level (or IP), because the latter is only dependent on the width of the UPS spectrum which does not change. The HOMO level values calculated from these spectra are presented in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that the HOMO values of the molecules measured on plasma treated Si do not differ (within experimental error, ±0.05 eV) from those measured on the solvent-treated ITO substrate.
The importance of the surface's chemical composition on the determination of the final electronic properties of the film is illustrated in Fig. 9, where the absolute energy of the HOMO level, measured by UPS, is shown to increase linearly with the F:C surface atomic ratio. The single and C60-hybridised molecules with an –OH end group appear to be the exception to this trend with the HOMO level being at the lowest absolute value of 6.2 eV indicating that the polar nature and the electron donating character of the end-group defines the HOMO position of the molecule and its hybrid with C60.

3.5. Electrochemical characterization

Fig. 10a, c and e show that the monomers exhibit well defined oxidation and reduction potentials that permit the calculation of energy gaps. Furthermore, the incorporation of C60 causes significant changes in the reduction run of the voltammograms. Indeed, the characteristic peaks of C60−, C602− and C603−36 can be found in voltammograms in Fig. 10b, d and f, between −0.5 V and −2.5 V. A further effect of C60 is a clear reduction of the energy gap, as can be deduced by comparing the voltammograms in Fig. 10.

In Table 4, the HOMO values measured by UPS, the reduction and oxidation onset potentials and the Eg values measured by CV and the calculated LUMO are shown for all the functionalized perfluorophenyl small molecules and their respective hybrid materials. These values are used for the construction of the energy diagrams in Fig. 11, from where it is clear that the electronic properties of the molecules can be controllably modified by hybridisation with carbon nanostructures.

The present work does not include experimental data on fabricated OPVs using the studied materials with fullerenes; instead it includes an empirical prediction of the suitability of these materials for use in OPVs. For that, we have used the methodology of Veldman25 together with the HOMO–LUMO levels. The suitability of the hybrid compounds as acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has been assessed with use of the methodology proposed by Veldman and co-workers.25 It comprises an empirical method to determine the energy of intermolecular charge transfer states (ECT) in electron donor-acceptor blends as: ECT = |EHOMO(D) − ELUMO(A)| + 0.29 eV(2)with EHOMO(D) and ELUMO(A) as the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO levels, respectively.
It has been shown25 that the open circuit voltage (VOC) of such a BHJ solar cell is given by: eVOC = |EHOMO(D) − ELUMO(A)| − 0.18 eV(3) Also, photo-induced electron transfer (PET) from the lowest singlet excited state in the blend to the CT state occurs when Eg,min − |EHOMO(D) − ELUMO(A)| ≥ 0.37 eV(4) with Eg,min the lowest energy gap value of either the donor or the acceptor.

Eqn (2)–(4) were used to compare the performance of proposed hybrids with PCBM and among themselves, in blends with P3HT as a donor. The HOMO, LUMO and Eg values for P3HT and PCBM were taken from the literature.25 The results appear in Table 5. It follows that all three hybrids are capable for PET in blends with P3HT. Of them, the P3HT:C12(Ph)2-5FQ-N-C60 blend appears to achieve the highest VOC followed by P3HT:HOPh-5FQ-N-C60. Both yield higher VOC than the standard P3HT:PCBM blend. The least effective combination is P3HT:Ph-5FQ-N-C60 with VOC = 0.40 V.

4. Conclusions
Hybrids based on perfluorophenyl functionalized quinolines directly attached onto the sp2 hybridized surface of carbon nanostructures have been prepared and evaluated herein with respect to their electronic and electrochemical properties. The quinoline based organic moieties were modified with various substituents for improved solubility and controllable affinity for the selected substrates. A systematic study of the electronic properties of these moieties has been performed mainly after deposition on oxygen plasma cleaned Si wafers and solvent-cleaned ITO coated glass.
The combination of photoelectron spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry provided significant insight into the investigation of the band structure and electronic properties of the thin single and hybrid layers. More specifically XPS analysis revealed the existence of a weak interfacial interaction between the organic molecules and the Si and ITO substrates. The extent of this interaction was shown to depend on the F:N surface atomic ratio which relates directly to the orientation of the quinoline group in the molecules.
The absolute value of the HOMO energy level decreased with the hybridisation of the single molecules. The values were not affected by the substrate on which the organic layers were grown but they were shown to depend on the surface stoichiometry. The molecules with terminal hydroxyl-groups did not follow this trend with their HOMO remaining at low absolute values (6.2 ± 0.05 eV) in all cases.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that hybridisation of the small molecules with carbon nanostructures causes the decrease of the material's energy gap and increases the absolute energy value of the LUMO level. These features prove the efficiency of the proposed method to produce materials with controlled energy levels for solar cell devices. The suitability of the fabricated hybrid compounds for use in bulk heterojunction solar cells in conjunction with P3HT was assessed empirically using the HOMO, LUMO and Eg values. All three hybrids are capable of photoinduced electron transfer in blends with P3HT. Of the three hybrids, C12(Ph)2-5FQ-N-C60 appears to be the most effective (VOC = 1.20 V) followed by HOPh-5FQ-C60 (VOC = 1.00 V). Both yield higher VOC than the standard PCBM acceptor. The least effective compound is Ph-5FQ-N-C60 (VOC = 0.40 V).
