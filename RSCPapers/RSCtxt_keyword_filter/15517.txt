    , Accepted 17th December 2015First published on 17th December 2015AbstractWe demonstrate a high efficiency perovskite solar cell with a hybrid hole-transporting material-counter electrode based on a thin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) film and a drop-cast 2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) hole-transporting material (HTM). The average efficiency of the solar cells was 13.6%, with the record cell yielding 15.5% efficiency. The efficiency of the reference solar cells with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and an evaporated gold counter electrode was 17.7% (record 18.8%), that of the cells with only a SWCNT counter electrode (CE) without additional HTM was 9.1% (record 11%) and that of the cells with gold deposited directly on the perovskite layer was 5% (record 6.3%). Our results show that it is possible to manufacture high efficiency perovskite solar cells with thin film (thickness less than 1 μm) completely carbon-based HTM-CEs using industrially upscalable manufacturing methods, such as press-transferred CEs and drop-cast HTMs.

Broader context
The commercialization of the high-efficiency perovskite solar cell (PSC) is hindered today by the use of expensive hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and counter electrodes that are deposited by industrially unviable methods. In this work, a metal-free hybrid hole-transporting material-hole-selective contact for high efficiency perovskite solar cells was manufactured by upscalable materials and methods. First, a single-walled carbon nanotube film (sheet resistance 13 Ω sq−1) was press-transferred on the perovskite substrate. Then a small amount of Spiro-OMeTAD HTM was applied on the film by drop-casting. The resulting solar cell structure yielded a considerable 15.5% power conversion efficiency at the best, compared to 18.8% for the standard structure with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD and evaporated gold, demonstrating that high efficiency PSCs can be created using abundant starting materials and upscalable deposition methods.

The perovskite solar cell (PSC)1 has received a lot of attention during the last couple of years due to its high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its simple manufacturing methods. Typically, the PSC cell utilizes a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a thin dense TiO2 layer and a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold, onto which a methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layer is deposited, followed by a spin-coated hole-transporting layer (HTM) and a thermally evaporated silver or gold back contact.
The most common HTM material, with which the highest power conversion efficiencies have been obtained, is 2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),2 a non-polymeric small-molecule hole conductor. However, the material can only be prepared through a complicated synthetic route resulting in high costs, its intrinsic hole mobility is low3 and it is deposited by spin-coating on the solar cell. There are also issues related to the silver and gold contact layers: gold is expensive, silver may oxidize in the long run, and evaporation, as a vacuum technology, is not cost-effective. These aforementioned issues may stand in the way of commercialization of the PSC.
Carbon nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene flakes, are interesting alternative HTM and counter electrode (CE) materials for different kinds of solar cells, such as dye solar cells,4,5 polymer solar cells,6 PSCs7–12 and silicon solar cells.13 Carbon is an abundant raw material, and several desirable properties are achievable using carbon nanomaterial films, such as electrical conductivity, semitransparency14 with CNT films and flexibility with CNT15 and nanoparticle composite films.16 Individual nanotubes and graphene flakes conduct electronic charges ballistically,17,18 meaning that extremely good conductivities can be achieved for thin films manufactured from these materials by developed synthesis techniques. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are especially interesting in transparent electronics due to the fact that superior conductivity versus transparency values can be achieved using, for instance, HNO3 doped SWCNTs,19 whereas doping of, for instance, MWCNTs does not alter their electronic properties. Also the conductivity of SWCNT films is expected to improve using improved synthesis methods (e.g. longer and higher crystallinity individual tubes).
Successful application of carbon nanomaterials in PSCs has been reported in a few studies. Li et al. used a transparent but highly resistive carbon nanotube film as the sole HTM-CE layer in a PSC and obtained 7% efficiency.7 Others used carbon nanotube-HTM composites with an additional thermally evaporated silver CE.11,12,20,21 Carbon black and graphite-based HTM-CEs have yielded good solar cell efficiencies,8–10 but the layers were several micrometers thick and completely opaque. Also graphene has been utilized.22,23
In this work, we tested whether a high-conductivity random network-type SWCNT film works as the HTM-CE of a PSC with and without additional HTM. We also investigated whether the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM can be deposited on the cell by drop-casting to achieve high PCE. To study these phenomena and to reach good solar cell performance, we prepared perovskite solar cells with SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD composite HTM-CEs without an additional metal contact (SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cell). We compared the solar cell type with cells with the standard spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD HTM and evaporated gold CE (Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cell) and cells with the SWCNT film functioning as the sole HTM-CE (SWCNT cell) and cells with the gold CE evaporated directly on the perovskite layer (Au cell).
In the solar cell manufacturing, the SWCNT film was transferred from a filter paper on the formamidinium lead iodide-methylammonium lead bromide ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) perovskite layer by a simple press transfer method,14 see Fig. 1. After the transfer, the layer was densified with chlorobenzene. Subsequently, another layer of the film was deposited on the already transferred film in order to lower the sheet resistance. After the double-SWCNT film layer deposition, some of the films were treated by drop-casting 4 μl of Spiro-OMeTAD solution with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in chlorobenzene. It was found out in a preliminary study that drop-cast Spiro-OMeTAD yielded efficiency similar to spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD in combination with the SWCNT film. Hence in this study, only the drop-casting option was considered, since it is the most industrially viable of the two methods. For some of the cells, the second SWCNT layer was densified only with chlorobenzene to create solar cells where the SWCNT film functions as the sole HTM-CE.
 Fig. 1  A schematic image of the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD perovskite solar cell preparation. Steps (1) and (2) are common for all the studied solar cell types; only steps (3) and (4) (HTM and CE deposition) differ from one cell type to another. 
This type of SWCNT film is typically “densified” by applying a few drops of ethanol on it when deposited on a substrate:14 when the ethanol evaporates, the SWCNT film becomes more compact and the SWCNT bundle connectivity and adhesion on a substrate improve, but in the perovskite case ethanol is out of question due to the perovskite layer’s sensitivity to polar solvents. However, chlorobenzene worked well as the SWCNT film densification solvent in this experiment. The SWCNT film transferred from the filter paper on the perovskite surface, and densified with chlorobenzene and the Spiro-OMeTAD solution were trouble-free.
The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the four studied solar cell structures are shown in Fig. 2(a–d). It can be seen in Fig. 2(a) that the thickness of the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD film layer is less than one micrometer, rendering it much thinner than the previously reported carbon black-based HTM-CE layers.8–10 The thickness of the spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD layer is in the 100–200 nm range and the gold layer is 80 nm. The mesoporous TiO2 layer is around 100 nm for all the cell types and the perovskite capping layer is in the range of 300–400 nm. The long “whiskers” in front of the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cell cross section (Fig. 2a) and the SWCNT cell (Fig. 2c) are believed to be SWCNT bundles partially detached from the film in the cross-sectional SEM sample preparation.

It can be seen in (a) that the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD layer is less than 1 μm thick. Other layers, marked in (d), of the solar cells are in the typical range. 
The results of the I–V measurements carried out at full 1 sun illumination intensity and at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and with a mask size of 0.16 cm2, are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The average efficiency (average of the forward and backward scans) of the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells was 13.6%, ranging from 14.6% in the backward direction (average) and 12.7% in the forward direction, showing that high-efficiency solar cells can be prepared by using only press-transferred SWCNT film and drop-cast Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM-CE. The efficiency of the reference cells with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD and evaporated gold cells was 17.7% (18.6% backward scanned, 16.8% forward scanned) and that of the cells with only SWCNT film was 9.1% (9.9% backward, 8.3% forward). The Au only cell yielded 5.0% efficiency (6.3% backward, 3.8% forward). It can be seen that the efficiency difference in the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cell case, as compared to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cells, stems from a slight difference in the short-circuit current (isc) and the fill factor (F.F.), which will be discussed later in the paper. The hysteresis behavior of the solar cells is similar to what Seok et al. reported in their paper on the mixed halide perovskite cells,24 average efficiencies for the backward and forward scan directions are presented in Table 1. It is known from the literature that the work function of a pristine SWCNT film is around 5 eV,25 a value similar to that of Spiro-OMeTAD, around 5.2 eV, and gold at 5.1 eV.26 Therefore it is not surprising that the open-circuit voltage is similar for the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD and the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cells.

The mask used was 0.16 cm2. The slight smoothness variation in the curves is due to a lamp drift in the slow measurement.

When comparing the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells with the only SWCNT film as a CE, it can be concluded that the Spiro-OMeTAD has a beneficial effect on the solar cell performance, improving the efficiency by 5.2%-units, even though the sheet-resistances of the SWCNT and SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD films were effectively the same (see below).
It is known that also the perovskite film transports holes,27 but from these results it can be seen that an additional HTM improves the cell performance considerably. On the other hand the fact that the SWCNT HTM-CE yields a better PCE than gold deposited directly on the perovskite layer, this result proves that the SWCNT film also improves the hole extraction and transport in the devices.
In order to understand the differences in the I–V properties of the solar cells, we carried out a 1-diode model fitting of the I–V curves28 to find out approximate values for the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH). The results are shown in Table 2. From the values we see that the RS is the lowest for both types of the Spiro-OMeTAD-containing cells. On the other hand, the RSH values are the highest for the Spiro-OMeTAD cells, meaning that recombination between the perovskite and the HTM layer is lower in these cells than in the cells with only the SWCNT or the gold layer as the HTM-CE, which might be due to e.g. lower recombination of holes from the Spiro-OMeTAD cell to the perovskite film. The RSH is also higher for the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cells than for the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells, which may explain the F.F. difference in these cells. These effects lay ground for further optimization studies for reaching >20% efficiencies for the SWCNT-perovskite solar cells.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4) display a wide wavelength range plateau, as is expected for these types of perovskite devices, and the current onset at 790 nm wavelength corresponds to the optical band-gap of the material. In the case of the SWCNT devices, there is a slight loss in the current in the red region (500–750 nm) of the spectra, which corresponds to the loss observed in the isc compared to that of the reference Spiro-OMeTAD + Au device. This effect may be ascribed to the absence of a reflective gold layer. Although the both SWCNT devices, with and without HTMs, show very similar iscs, the slight deviance in the IPCE can be attributed to their performances at lower light intensities at which the IPCE is measured.

Snaith et al. have suggested in an experimental and theoretical study that the fraction of photocurrent generated from the light back reflected by the gold layer could be 13%.29 In our case the SWCNT:Spiro-OMETAD cell photocurrent fraction of the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cell photocurrent is 91%, meaning that 9% of the current in the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cells could be generated due to back reflected light, which is close to the figure suggested by Snaith et al. It is know that reflectivity is low for carbon nanotube films.30
Interestingly, the Au-only devices display poor IPCE response at wavelengths larger than 500 nm. In this range, light is absorbed rather uniformly in the whole perovskite film. The lower IPCE points towards relatively poor selectivity of the Au contact: electrons reaching this contact will recombine with holes. At wavelengths below 500 nm, charge carriers are generated in close proximity to the TiO2 film, and electrons are selectively extracted. The SWCNT-only devices do not display the same feature, suggesting that the SWCNTs used here form a good hole-selective contact, at least at these light intensities. These devices display, however, a low F.F. and low RSH under full 1 sun illumination intensity. This is possibly due to an energy barrier for hole injection from the perovskite to the SWCNTs. Addition of Spiro-OMeTAD presumably successfully modifies such a barrier.
In order to investigate the impact of the SWCNTs on the charge-transport dynamics in the devices, we performed intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)31 on the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au and SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells. The charge-transport time dependence on a short-circuit current of the two device types is shown in Fig. 5. At high iSCs, the charge-transport times are rather similar for both types of devices, suggesting that SWCNT films can replace gold electrodes without significant reduction of charge-collection efficiency under short-circuit conditions. Interestingly, the charge-transport time dependence on the iSC is different for the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au and SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells. The charge-transport time becomes longer for the Spiro-OMeTAD + Au devices than for the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD devices as the iSC is lowered. This behavior has previously been explained by Leijtens et al.,3 who demonstrated that the charge carrier mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD is strongly dependent on the charge density in the device (for instance a high light intensity or large applied bias voltage yields large charge density). A lower iSC and thus a lower charge density results in worsening of the charge-transport properties of the Spiro-OMeTAD, whereas the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD seems to be suffer less from charge density reduction, meaning that the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cells may be better at transporting and collecting charges e.g. at low light intensities.

The SWCNT and SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD films were characterized by sheet resistance, absorbance, transmittance, Raman spectroscopy with films deposited on quartz substrates. The studied film types were the pristine SWCNT film, the SWCNT film densified with chlorobenzene and the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD film (see above). The sheet resistance, RSHEET, of a single layer of the pristine SWCNT film on a quartz substrate was 43 Ω □−1. After the chlorobenzene densification, the sheet resistance of the film dropped to 21 Ω □−1. The RSHEET of a double SWCNT film layer (both layers densified with chlorobenzene) was 13 Ω □−1. No difference in RSHEET was found for the samples treated with the Spiro-OMeTAD solution.
The absorbance and transmittance spectra of the different SWCNT films (single layer) on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. The spectra are typical for these kinds of films and it can be seen that the chlorobenzene and Spiro-OMeTAD solution with the additives (TBP and LiTFSI) have a negligible effect on the spectra. The transmittance value at 550 nm that is typically given as the “thickness” indicator of a SWCNT film is 15% for the pristine SWCNT film, 12% for the chlorobenzene-densified film and 11% for the Spiro-OMeTAD treated film.

Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of the pristine SWCNT film, the chlorobenzene-densified film and the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD film at a laser excitation energy of 1.96 eV. The strong radial breathing modes (RBMs) and tangential graphitic (G) band are characteristic features of SWCNTs. The smallness of diamond (D) band at wavenumber 1320 cm−1 indicates very good quality of the individual SWCNTs. The G peak at about 1590 cm−1 is associated with the in-plane vibrations of the carbon atoms along the nanotube axis, and its frequency is sensitive to charge transfer from dopant additions to SWCNTs, i.e., an upshift occurs for p-type doping and downshift for n-type doping.32 As shown in the inset of Fig. 8, the SWCNT film densified with chlorobenzene presents a slight upshift of the G band, indicating p-type doping of SWCNTs. However the effect is small and most likely does not affect the overall doping level of the SWCNTs significantly. The SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD films do not display this phenomenon, and we can conclude that the Spiro-OMeTAD does not have any adverse effect on the SWCNT film’s electrical or structural properties.

The inset displays the normalized intensities of the G band for the different film types, indicating slight doping effects for the chlorobenzene-densified film. 
In summary, we show in this letter that a single-walled carbon nanotube film with drop-cast Spiro-OMeTAD is a high performing, completely carbon-based hybrid hole-transporting material-counter electrode for perovskite solar cells with industrially viable processing. The best efficiency for the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD-perovskite cell was 15.5% when that of the reference cell with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD and a thermally evaporated gold counter electrode was 18.8%. Our result may pave the way for industrialization of the perovskite solar cells, as less vacuum methods are needed in processing of the solar cells.

Broader context
The commercialization of the high-efficiency perovskite solar cell (PSC) is hindered today by the use of expensive hole-transporting materials (HTMs) and counter electrodes that are deposited by industrially unviable methods. In this work, a metal-free hybrid hole-transporting material-hole-selective contact for high efficiency perovskite solar cells was manufactured by upscalable materials and methods. First, a single-walled carbon nanotube film (sheet resistance 13 Ω sq−1) was press-transferred on the perovskite substrate. Then a small amount of Spiro-OMeTAD HTM was applied on the film by drop-casting. The resulting solar cell structure yielded a considerable 15.5% power conversion efficiency at the best, compared to 18.8% for the standard structure with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD and evaporated gold, demonstrating that high efficiency PSCs can be created using abundant starting materials and upscalable deposition methods.


 	Fig. 1  A schematic image of the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD perovskite solar cell preparation. Steps (1) and (2) are common for all the studied solar cell types; only steps (3) and (4) (HTM and CE deposition) differ from one cell type to another.	 

 	Fig. 2  Cross-sectional SEM images of the different solar cell structures. (a) SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD cell, (b) Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cell, (c) SWCNT cell and (d) Au cell. It can be seen in (a) that the SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD layer is less than 1 μm thick. Other layers, marked in (d), of the solar cells are in the typical range.	 

 	Fig. 3  The I–V curves of the different solar cell types. The arrows indicate the I–V scan direction. The scan speed was 10 mV s−1, the wait time 500 ms and the step size 5 mV. The mask used was 0.16 cm2. The slight smoothness variation in the curves is due to a lamp drift in the slow measurement.	 

SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD	6	1.1	20.3	61	13.6	14.6	12.7	15.5

 	Fig. 5  The charge transport time dependence on the short-circuit current density of SWCNT:Spiro-OMeTAD and Spiro-OMeTAD + Au cells obtained by IMPS.	 

 	Fig. 6  The absorbance spectra of the studied SWCNT films on quartz substrates.	 

 	Fig. 7  The transmittance spectra of the studied SWCNT film types.	 

 	Fig. 8  Raman spectra of the different SWCNT films on the quartz substrate. G, D and RBMs refer to the graphitic, diamond and radial breathing mode bands, respectively. The inset displays the normalized intensities of the G band for the different film types, indicating slight doping effects for the chlorobenzene-densified film.
