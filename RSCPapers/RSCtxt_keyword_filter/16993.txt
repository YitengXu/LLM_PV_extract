    , Accepted 15th June 2023First published on 16th June 2023AbstractPost-treatment of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) with ammonium halogen salts, such as phenethylammonium or octylammonium iodide, has been widely used to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via surface defect passivation. Although the passivation is expected to be influenced by functional groups (ammonium versus amidinium and aryl versus alkyl), little study on this effect has been reported. Here, we report on the dependence of stability and photovoltaic performance on cation groups of iodide passivating materials. Amidinium (–C(NH2)2+) and ammonium (–NH3+) in a given aryl group and aryl and alkyl group with similar steric size in a given amidinium group were compared using phenylamidinium (benzamidinium) iodide (PhADI), benzylammonium iodide (BnAMI), and tert-butyl amidinium iodide (tBADI). It was found from the photovoltaic parameters that amidinium was better than ammonium in the given aryl group, and aryl was better than alkyl in the given amidinium moiety. Post-treatment with PhADI shows the best photovoltaic performance among the studied series of passivating materials. Open-circuit voltage was mainly improved from 1.11 V to 1.16 V by the PhADI treatment due to the reduced trap density from 2.53 × 1016 to 1.54 × 1016 cm−3, resulting in an improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 21.27% to 23.24%. Moreover, the PhADI-treated device maintained over 99% of its initial PCE after 400 h, while inferior maintenance of 65% was observed from the device without post-treatment.
1. Introduction
Since the first report on solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and 500 h-stability in 2012,1 halide perovskites have received great attention due to their superb optoelectronic properties. Light absorbing methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPI3) was replaced by formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) in PSCs, which improved PCE further, reaching 25.7%.2 Besides compositional engineering, interface engineering has been regarded as an important and effective method to passivate surface defects of the perovskite layer.3 To passivate bulk and surface defects, the addition of additives in the perovskite precursor solutions and post-treatment atop the perovskite films were, in general, proposed.4,5 Given the precursor solution with optimal additive, interfaces should be carefully controlled to improve photovoltaic performance and stability. For the n-i-p structure having an electron transporting layer (ETL) on the transparent conducting substrate and a hole transporting layer (HTL) on the top of perovskite film, both interfaces formed at ETL and HTL are expected to affect interfacial charge transport and recombination.6–8 Among the reported methods for interface engineering, post-treatment of the annealed perovskite film with passivating materials is regarded as one of the effective approaches.9–11 There are two types of organic passivating materials: molecules and ionic salts. For instance, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyano-quinodimethane (F4TCNQ) as a molecular passivating material was introduced at the perovskite/HTL interface, which reduced interfacial recombination due to dipole-induce doping.12 As another example of molecular passivating material, phosphorus-containing Lewis acid and base molecules were post-treated to find a dominant surface defect type affecting moisture-induced decomposition or phase transition of perovskite.13 Aryl or alkyl ammonium slats were commonly used as post-treatment materials. For example, 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide was used as an ionic salt passivating material, where sterically repulsive tert-butyl group was introduced in phenethylammonium iodide to prevent aggregation of the passivating materials and better photovoltaic performance was observed than the phenethylammonium iodide treated perovskite.14 Linear alkylammonium bromides with carbon numbers ranging from four to eight dissolved in chloroform were reported to passivate interface defects by forming 2-dimensional (2D) perovskite atop the 3-dimensional perovskite layer.15 Although a wide variety of passivating materials were reported,16–20 the effect of cations in passivating materials, such as the aryl versus alkyl group and ammonium versus amidinium group, has not been systematically investigated.
Here, we report on the effect of cations in passivating materials on the stability and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. For this purpose, we have selected a series of iodide passivating materials of aryl cation with different amidinium and ammonium group and amidinium cation with different aryl and alkyl groups, that is, phenyamidinium (PhAD) versus benzylammonium (BnAM) and PhAD versus tert-butyl amidinium (tBAD). Crystal structure and oxidation states of surface elements of perovskite films are investigated before and after post-treatment using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Changes in carrier lifetime and trap density after post-treatment are studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) coupled with impedance spectroscopy. Optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic parameters are found to be obviously dependent on cations in the passivating materials. Among the studied passivating materials, post-treatment with PhADI exhibits the best photovoltaic performance and stability.
2. Results and discussion
First, we have compared the effect of the amidinium functional group in PhADI with ammonium in BnAMI. Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic illustration of the post-treatment with passivating materials on the 150 °C-annealed FAPbI3-dominant (FAPbI3)0.99(MAPbBr3)0.01 perovskite film. Post-treatment was performed by dynamic coating, where the passivating materials were dropped on the perovskite film at 5 s after spinning, and the rotation of the substrate ended at 20 s after spinning. Since photovoltaic parameters are assumed to be dependent on the concentration of the passivating materials, concentration was varied from 2 mM to 20 mM. The optimal concentration is determined to be 10 mM for both PhAD and BnAM (Fig. S1†), which is used for further characterization. The device structure was n-i-p configuration with FTO/SnO2/perovskite (without and with post-treatment)/Au. Although ammonium cation was known to passivate effectively negatively charged defects by interacting with undercoordinated lead ion,16,17 amidinium cation is expected to have better interaction because of structural similarity with formamidinium cation in FAPbI3 and higher pKa of 11.6 for PhAD cation (pKa = 9.4 for BnAM cation).18,19Fig. 1(b) shows XRD patterns of the perovskite film before (w/o) and after post-treatment with BnAMI and PhADI. The pristine perovskite without treatment shows strong (100) and (200) peaks at 2θ = 13.98° and 28.14° due to cubic α-phase FAPbI3. Those peak positions are hardly changed after post-treatment, which indicates that post-treatment has little effect on bulk perovskite structure. However, a weak peak appears at 2θ = 8.56° for BnAMI and 2θ = 8.34° for PhADI, respectively (see inset in Fig. 1(b)), those which are not attributed to δ-FAPbI3 (2θ = 11.8°). To figure out the origin of the low-angle new peaks, XRD patterns are measured with one-dimensional (1D) and 2D perovskite comprising PhAD or BnAM cation, along with the passivating material itself. As can be seen in Fig. S2,† the new peaks at low angles after post-treatment cannot be identified because of disagreement with low-dimensional BnAM- and PhAD-containing perovskites and passivating materials. Those unidentified peaks might be due to the presence of secondary phases having BnAM and PhAD cations. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 1(c)–(e) support the formation of the secondary phase on the perovskite surface. Before post-treatment, pristine perovskite shows a rather clean surface, while the surface-treated perovskite shows small dots (BnAMI) and needle-like morphology (PhADI). This indicates that the secondary phase is formed by the post-treatment. A small but almost equal amount of residual (or unreacted) PbI2 is found from the perovskite films regardless of post-treatment, which indicates that the residual PbI2 in the pristine perovskite is hard to react with cations of the passivating materials.

The dashed circle in (d) shows small dots that are clearly shown in the inset of the magnified image. The concentration of the passivating materials was 10 mM. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is investigated to understand the underlying interaction between passivating materials and the perovskite surface. All peaks were calibrated with C–C binding energy at 284.6 eV from C 1s XPS data (Fig. S3(a)).†Fig. 2(a) shows Pb 4f XPS spectra of the perovskite film before and after post-treatment. The perovskite film without post-treatment shows strong doublet peaks at 143.09 eV and 138.23 eV, which correspond to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2, respectively. A null change in peak shift is observed for BnAMI post-treatment, whereas PhADI treatment shifts peaks toward lower binding energies of 142.89 eV for Pb 4f5/2 and 138.03 eV for Pb 4f7/2. This tendency is also observed in N 1s and I 3d XPS spectra shown in Fig. S3(b) and (c).† Compared with pristine perovskite exhibiting N 1s, I 3d3/2, and I 3d5/2 peaks at 400.55 eV, 630.80 eV, and 619.31 eV, respectively, no peak shift is observed for the BnAMI treatment, but these peaks shift toward lower binding energies of 400.30 eV, 630.59 eV, and 619.09 eV upon the PhADI treatment. Since binding energy shift to lower energy for Pb 4f core level underlines an increase in electron density on Pb2+ ion, the shift to low energy for the PhADI treatment is indicative of robust and strong passivation of undercoordinated lead ions. This is presumably due to the more basic nature of amidine than amine.20 Binding energy at 400.55 eV observed from the N 1s XPS for the untreated perovskite is related to nitrogen in FA cation interacting with iodide.21 A change of 0.25 eV by shifting to lower binding energy indicates that FA–I interaction is affected by the interaction between PhAD cation and iodide anion and/or [PbI6]4− octahedra.22 From the extent of the shift in N 1s peak, stronger interaction is observed for the PhAD cation than for the BnAM cation. In Pb 4f spectra, there are weak doublet peaks of metallic lead (Pb0) at 141.39 eV and 136.54 eV, which is assumed to be related to the decomposition byproduct of residual PbI2 under X-ray irradiation.23,24 It was reported that the presence of metallic Pb in the perovskite might have a detrimental effect on photovoltaic performance via open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss and reduced photoluminescence quantum yield.25–27 Since the residual PbI2 in the pristine perovskite remained unchanged upon post-treatment (see Fig. 1(b)), different intensities of metallic Pb peak might be related to iodide or cation vacancies rather than the residual PbI2.28 The intensity ratio of Pb0 to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 is evaluated in Fig. 2(b). Pb0/Pb 4f5/2 and Pb0/Pb 4f7/2 for pristine perovskite are estimated to be 14.3% and 15.8%, respectively, which is gradually decreased to 9.8% and 10.8% for BnAMI and significantly reduced to 3.3% and 4.0% for PhADI. As aforementioned, the decrease in metallic Pb upon post-treatment is probably due to the passivation of vacancy by passivating materials, which is pronounced by PhADI.

To further investigate any changes in surface band alignment accompanied by post-treatment, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed in Fig. S4, and parameters are listed in Table S1.† Decreasing the band tail states induced by metallic Pb is expected to increase the energy gap between the Fermi level and valence band maximum (VBM).29 VBM is determined from the logarithm curve in the low binding energy region from UPS spectra,30 which is increased from 1.10 eV for pristine perovskite to 1.12 eV for BnAMI and 1.20 eV for PhADI, respectively. With the obtained VBMs, valence band energy (EVB) is calculated by EVB = hv − Ecut-off + VBM (hv is the energy of He I (21.22 eV)), where Ecut-off is determined from the cut-off energy in the high binding energy region from UPS spectra.31–34EVB is slightly upshifted from −6.43 eV for pristine perovskite to −6.40 eV for BnAMI and −6.40 eV for PhADI, and the conduction band energy (ECB) is therefore slightly upward shifted from −4.89 eV to 4.86 eV for both BnAMI and PhADI. The changes in energy levels contribute in part to the enhancement of Voc.35,36 In addition, the work function (WF) is reduced from 5.33 eV to 5.20 eV by PhADI post-treatment, leading to more n-type nature that is beneficial for perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD junction.
Since the substantial energy shift to low binding energy in I 3d XPS spectra (Fig. S3(c))† of perovskite films treated with PhADI is indicative of a strong interaction between PhAD cation with iodide, UV-visible spectroscopic study was further performed to understand PhAD–I interaction in solution. Fig. 2(c) shows the UV-vis spectra and photographs of the fresh and 100 h-aged perovskite precursor solutions, including 10 mM BnAMI or PhADI. For the precursor solution with BnAMI, the solution color turns yellow from colorless after aging for 100 h, which is due to the presence of triiodide (I3−) as confirmed by the new two peaks at 290 nm and 360 nm.37,38 However, no spectroscopic change is observed for the precursor solution with PhADI, probably due to the strong interaction of iodide with PhAD cation, inhibiting oxidation of iodide.39,40 Suppressing oxidation of iodide in solution by PhADI is consequently associated with peak shift in I 3d spectra toward lower binding energies for solid-state samples.41,42
As expected, trap density is reduced by post-treatment with passivating materials (Fig. 2(d)). Trap density (nt) was estimated using nt = (2VTFLεrε0)/(ed2) based on space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement with FTO/perovskite (with and without post-treatment)/Au device configuration. Dielectric constant (εr) was calculated by the following equation εr = (Cgd)/ε0, where Cg, d, and ε0 are the geometric capacitance, thickness of perovskite film (thickness was determined from the alpha-step profiler), and vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10−14 F cm−1).43,44Cg is estimated from the plateau region in the capacitance–frequency (C–f) plot obtained from the same device structure (see Fig. S5(a)).† Dark J–V curves before and after post-treatment are shown in Fig. S5(b)–(d).† Trap-filled-limited voltage (VTFL) is obtained from the intercept at slopes with n = 2 and n = 3.45 Based on the values obtained, listed in Table S2,† the estimated nt is found to decrease from 2.53 × 1016 cm−3 for pristine perovskite to 1.79 × 1016 cm−3 for BnAMI and to 1.54 × 1016 cm−3 for PhADI. This indicates that the amidinium group is more effective in reducing trap density than the ammonium group, associated with optimal pKa value.18 Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 2(e)) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) (Fig. 2(f)) were measured to study changes in nonradiative recombination and carrier lifetime after post-treatment depending on cations in passivating materials. PL peak is significantly intensified by post-treatment with PhADI, indicative of a significant reduction of nonradiative recombination. TRPL decay curves were fitted with a biexponential decay equation,46 and the parameters for fitting are summarized in Table 1. The fast decay component (τ1) and the slow decay component (τ2) are related to trap-mediated nonradiative recombination and radiative recombination, respectively. τ1 is decreased but τ2 is increased after post-treatment, where PhADI treatment substantially reduces τ1 from 31 ns to 13 ns and enhances τ2 from 1080 ns to 2737 ns. This implies that recombination by surface traps is effectively reduced, and radiative recombination is significantly improved by PhADI treatment. As a result, the average lifetime seen from τave is increased from 1077 ns for pristine perovskite to 1304 ns for BnAMI and 2737 ns for PhADI due to a significant contribution from τ2.47 This tendency of enhancement of carrier lifetime observed by TRPL is well consistent with the reduced nt obtained by SCLC.

Data were fitted with a biexponential decay equation I(t) = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where I(t) is the time-dependent PL intensity and τ1, τ2, A1 and A2 are time constants and amplitudes. The average time constant (τave) was calculated by τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)

Current–voltage curves were measured to find the effect of cations in the passivating materials on photovoltaic parameters. Fig. 3(a) shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves of best-performing PSCs employing the perovskite films before and after post-treatment. Statistical photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Fig. 3(b) and average photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Mean PCE is increased from 21.27% for pristine to 22.21% for BnAMI and 23.24% for PhADI due mainly to Voc and fill factor (FF) enhancements. There is a significant increase in Voc from 1.108 V for pristine perovskite to 1.155 V for PhADI treatment, while a slight increase to 1.136 V is observed for BnAMI treatment. The difference in the enhancement of Voc is related to the extent of trap density. An increase in FF is also observed from 0.8009 for pristine perovskite to 0.8303 for PhADI treatment. The diode ideality factor (n) is determined from the light intensity-dependent Voc plot shown in Fig. 3(c), where J–V curves depending on light intensity are depicted in Fig. S6.†n is decreased from 1.84 for pristine perovskite to 1.23 for BnAMI and 1.20 for PhADI, which is responsible for the increase in FF.48 In addition, the transport resistance, obtained from impedance spectroscopy, is decreased by the post-treatment, which can explain the increased FF (Fig. S7†). A slight increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) is observed after post-treatment, which is due to little change in absorbance, as observed in Fig. S4(d).†

We have also compared the aryl and alkyl groups in amidinium-based passivating materials. For this purpose, tert-butyl amidinium iodide (tBADI) was selected because of the similar steric size of the tert-butyl group with the phenyl group.49 Unlike PhADI, post-treatment with tBADI leads to 2D (tBADI)2PbI4 on the perovskite surface because of similar peaks observed at 2θ = 6.96° and 8.02° with those (2θ = 6.94° and 8°) for the synthesized (tBADI)2PbI4 (Fig. S8(a)).† As compared to the significant reduction in metallic Pb for PhADI, metallic Pb is slightly reduced by tBADI treatment from 14.3% (w/o) to 10.6% for Pb0/Pb 4f5/2 and from 15.8% (w/o) to 12.1% for Pb0/Pb 4f7/2 (Fig. S8(b)).† This indicates that the aryl group is more beneficial to suppressing the formation of metallic Pb than the alkyl group in amidinium passivating materials. From the N 1s and I 3d XPS in Fig. S8(c) and (d),† more shift toward lower binding energies is observed for tBADI than for PhADI, which is due to 2D formation on the 3D perovskite surface.50 The precursor solution with tBADI is quite stable upon aging for 100 h (Fig. S8(e)),† and the 600 h-aged tBADI-treated perovskite film shows similar absorbance with the fresh film as confirmed by optical absorbance spectra in Fig. S8(f),† which indicates that amidinium group plays an important role in stability. TRPL of the perovskite film treated with tBADI shows τave = 2159 ns (Fig. S8(g)),† which is longer than the pristine, but slightly shorter than PhADI. PSC with the tBADI-treated perovskite film exhibits a PCE of 22.42% with Jsc = 24.17 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.153 V and FF = 80.43% (Fig. S9†), where PCE is slightly lower than that for PhADI but higher than the BnAMI-treated film. Voc is close to that for PhADI due to a similar carrier lifetime. FF is not substantially improved due to a marginal decrease in n of 1.77 (Fig. S8(h)).† The comparative study informs us that the aryl group is better than the alkyl group in the passivating materials with the amidinium functional group in terms of photovoltaic performance, but the stability of perovskite film is hardly dependent on aromaticity.
The effect of cation groups on the device and film stability was studied. Devices were stored in the dark ambient atmosphere (temperature of 25 ± 5 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 20 ± 10%) for 400 h and J–V curves were measured at the time after 24 h, 48 h, 120 h, 200 h, and 400 h. In Fig. 4(a), the device with perovskite film treated with BnAMI maintains 93.90% of its initial PCE, and a slightly higher maintenance of 99.02% is observed for the perovskite films treated with PhADI. On the other hand, the device employing untreated perovskite film maintains merely 64.95% of its initial PCE. The improvement of device stability is related to the defect passivation and low content of metallic lead in the films induced by passivating materials. Perovskite films were stored at the same condition, and absorbance was measured after 600 h. As shown in Fig. 4(b)–(d), the 600 h-aged perovskite film treated with PhADI shows comparable absorbance with the absorbance of the fresh film, indicating that the PhADI-treated FAPbI3 maintains the α-phase, while no distinct absorbance along with yellow-colored films after 600 h is observed for both the untreated pristine perovskite and the BnAMI-treated perovskite films. According to the optoelectronic analyses (see Fig. 2), as compared to the substantial changes of perovskite surface after PhADI post-treatment, changes in the oxidation state of lead ion from XPS and PL decay from TRPL are marginal after BnAMI post-treatment. This difference leads to the difference in film stability.

Devices were stored for 400 h without encapsulation in the dark under ambient air conditions of 25 ± 5 °C and RH of 20 ± 10%.

Perovskite films were stored in the dark under ambient air conditions of 25 ± 5 °C and RH of 20 ± 10%. 
We also investigated light soaking stability by measuring the maximum power points of the encapsulated devices under one sun illumination for 144 h. Fig. S10(a)† compares the light stability of the devices before and after post-treatment. Compared with the untreated device (w/o), showing 82.7% of its initial PCE after 144 h (from 20.45% to 16.92%), the BnAMI-treated device maintains 85.6% of its initial PCE (from 21.59% to 18.49%). This indicates that no noticeable improvement in light stability is observed by post-treatment of BnAMI. On the other hand, the device treated with PhADI is more stable under continuous illumination since it maintains 94.6% of the initial PCE (from 22.21% to 21.01%). The degree of light stability is well consistent with optoelectronic properties observed in Fig. 2. The light stability of perovskite films was investigated to understand the difference in device stability. As shown in Fig. S10(b)–(d),† the overall absorbance from the absorption edge gradually decreases over time for untreated and BnAMI-treated perovskite film, while the PhADI-treated film maintains almost its initial absorbance. Thus, the device stability under illumination is related to the film stability, and the post-treatment with PhADI can improve the device stability under light-soaking conditions.
For the PhADI post-treatment, the best-performing PSC was fabricated using a highly transparent FTO substrate. In Fig. S11,† the J–V curve shows a PCE of 23.58% with Jsc = 25.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.1426 V, and FF = 82.16%, together with negligible hysteresis. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement shows EQE over 92% from 440 nm to 700 nm, and a maximum EQE of 94% is observed at 550 nm. Integrated Jsc from EQE data is calculated to be 24.25 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the measured value due to only a 3.4% discrepancy.
3. Conclusions
The role of cation groups in iodide passivating materials was systematically studied. For the given aryl group, the effects of ammonium and amidinium groups on photovoltaic performance and stability were investigated. Photovoltaic performance and stability of the perovskite films treated with the amidinium-bearing material (PhADI) were superior to those for the ammonium-bearing one (BnAMI) due to more effective passivation of surface defects. An additional comparative study between the aryl (phenyl) and alkyl group (tert-butyl) with similar steric size in the given amidinium functional group showed better photovoltaic performance for the aryl group than for the alkyl group, whereas little difference in stability was observed. The PhADI-treated PSCs maintained over 99% of initial PCE after 400 h at ambient atmosphere. This work provides an important insight into the design of passivating materials for post-treatment.
