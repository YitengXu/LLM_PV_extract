    , Accepted 18th December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractIn view of the worldwide energy challenge in the 21st century, the technology of semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received considerable attention as an alternative approach for solar energy harvesting and storage. Two-dimensional (2D) structures such as nanosheets have the potential to tap the solar energy by unlocking the functional properties at the nanoscale. Tin(II) sulfide is a fascinating solar energy material due to its anisotropic material properties. In this manuscript, we report on exploiting the 2D structure modulated optical properties of nanocrystalline SnS thin film synthesized by chemical spray pyrolysis using ambient transport in the harvesting of solar energy. We obtained the nanostructured SnS with well-preserved dimensions and morphologies with one step processing. The work demonstrates that the intrinsically ordered SnS nanostructure on FTO coated glass can tap the incident radiation in an efficient manner. The structure–property relationship to explain the photo-response in nanocrystalline-SnS is verified experimentally and theoretically. The novel design scheme for antireflection coating along with the anisotropic properties of SnS is conceived for realizing a PEC cell. The developed PEC cell consists of a SnS photoanode which shows considerably high photocurrent density of 7 mA cm−2 with aqueous media under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 exposure with notably stable operation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that a non-ideal capacitive behavior as well as drift assisted transport across the solid-state interface is responsible for such a high photo-current density in the nanocrystalline-SnS photoanode.
1. Introduction
Sunlight could be the sole source of our future energy use, if the efficient and economical systems using earth abundant materials could be conceived for the energy conversion. Solar energy, for example can be converted into electricity and chemical fuels for the utilization and storage of energy. However, scientific challenges involved in this process include schemes to capture, convert, and store the energy. Solar energy conversion is of particular interest owing to the abundance of the source.1–3 Nanostructures of earth abundant materials have an immense potential in unlocking their functional properties.4,5 Two dimensional functional nanomaterials have received special attention in this regard.6 Among the layered chalcogenides, tin monosulfide (SnS) is a promising earth abundant solar energy harvester due to the direct optical band gap of 1.4 eV with a very high absorption coefficient7–9 over 5 × 104 cm−1. SnS shows an intrinsic p-type conductivity. However, its conductivity type can be modified by changing the Sn/S ratio. Ab initio studies have shown that the Sn vacancies act as shallow acceptors, giving rise to a p-type conductivity, whereas the Sn on S anti-sites act as donor defects. Recently, a high quality SnS monolayer has exhibited the n-type conductivity.7 The homojunction solid state device fabricated from SnS material may benefit the wireless water splitting due to the exceptional acceptor and donor doping possibility.10,11 The orthorhombic layered structure of SnS is composed of weakly interacting layers held together by van der Waals interactions, where each Sn and S atoms are tightly bound by chemical bonds with 100% exposed surface atoms (see ESI Fig. S1†). Moreover, no surplus charge is present on the chemically stable surfaces of the SnS monolayer.7,12 SnS promotes the fast separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes because of its high mobility of 2.37 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.35 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.13 The recent experiment and theory suggest that an α-SnS single crystal contains anisotropic electrical, optical and transport properties.14,15
In spite of the highly functional material properties of layered SnS, their applications have been less explored, such as in photovoltaic cells,8 photoelectrochemical cells,7 batteries,16,17 supercapacitors,18–20 sensors,21,22 solid state devices,23–25 and field emission electrodes.26 A certified power conversion efficiency of 4.36% has been reported for a substrate configured Mo/SnS/SnO2/Zn(O,S)/ZnO/ITO solar cell device, where 400 nm thin SnS was deposited by atomic layer deposition.8 However, the simplest atomic layered thin monolayer SnS electrodes have exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 3.32% with a photocurrent density of 5.27 mA cm−2 for a photoelectrochemical device for water splitting application with excellent stability.7 SnS is stable in the presence of water and oxygen in the atmosphere, where it is found as a natural mineral, Herzenbergite.7,8 Hence, SnS has better prospects for long-term stability in an aqueous electrolyte with anodic operation.7 The SnS materials also enjoy the advantage of fabricating good quality thin films by non-vacuum processes.7,27–29
In this work, we have exploited the advantage of producing nanostructured SnS thin films by chemical spray pyrolysis where their structure which could be well controlled from the precursor level that eventually have proved their potential as an efficient photoelectrode in the PEC cell. The self-sustained nanostructure growth during the deposition process has been identified to be responsible for the functionality governed by the anisotropic optical properties for solar energy harvesting. The comprehensive, structural, physical, optical and electrical properties of the developed nanostructured α-SnS have been studied experimentally and correlated with theory using the first principles calculations. The optimally organized nanostructured SnS photoanodes have exhibited a high photoactivity by delivering a high photocurrent density of 7 mA cm−2 with stable operation in the aqueous electrolyte. The results are compared with the reported literature in the following discussion. The design scheme for the optimal thickness and orientation of anisotropic optical layers of α-SnS is presented in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis and deposition of nanostructured SnS thin films
Nanostructured SnS were synthesized and deposited by the chemical spray pyrolysis of an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O (SC) and thiourea (TU) on microscopic glass (15 mm × 50 mm) and F:SnO2 (FTO) coated glass (15 mm × 50 mm, thickness 2.2 mm and sheet resistance 15 Ω per square) as substrates. The concentration of SC and TU was maintained at 0.05 M and 0.037 M throughout the present study, respectively. We added 0.55–0.65 ml of HCl (35–38% LR, S D Fine Chem. Ltd) to enhance the solubility of SC. All chemicals and substrates were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification otherwise it is mentioned. The pyrolysis temperature of 375 ± 10 °C was maintained for all the cases. The solution was transported to the spray nozzle using a syringe pusher and sprayed on the four step (dilute HCl, NaOH, DI water and acetone) ultrasonically cleaned substrate at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 for a duration of 3 minutes. Three to eight cycles of spray pyrolysis were carried out to obtain different thicknesses (50–500 nm). Ambient compressed air was used as the carrier gas at a pressure of 1.5 kg cm−2. By controlling the exhaust fan, the laminar flow of the nebulized precursor solution was achieved for the uniform deposition conditions. The nozzle was scanned over the substrate geometry at the speed of 2 and 20 mm s−1 during the spray process in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The speed of the exhaust fan was increased to 5000 rpm for removal of the decomposed residual gases from the chamber to avoid the possible chemical reaction and contamination after the pyrolysis process for each cycle. Top views of the deposited nanostructured SnS thin films are shown in section S1 (ESI†). After the SnS deposition process, the substrate was naturally cooled down to 50 °C and then removed from the spray station. The deposited SnS films appeared to be dark red under daylight transmission.
2.2 Material characterization
The nanostructured SnS thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Hall measurements. The XRD patterns were recorded by using a PANalytical X′Pert Powder diffractometer in the Gonio mode, using Cu-Kα1 radiation (1.540598), with a step size of 0.05°, and time/step size = 0.5 s per step in the range of 2θ = 10–80° with thin film mode attachment. The planar and cross sectional morphologies were analyzed by FESEM (Zeiss, Ultra 55) with 5 kV accelerating voltage using a secondary emission (SE) detector at 10 mm of the working distance. The thicknesses of all samples were determined from the cross sectional FESEM measurements. Raman spectroscopy (Micro Raman System, Jobin Yvon Horibra LABRAM-HR visible (400–1100 nm)) with an exciting wavelength of 480 nm was carried out to check for the phase purity and presence of any additional phases of tin sulfide. The surface area was investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (AFM, Nanosurf AG). The elemental composition of the films was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the SEM with an accelerating voltage up to 20 kV. Optical characterization was carried out by using a UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600) by recording the transmission and absorbance spectra of the films in the range of 320–1400 nm. The electrical properties were studied by Hall-measurement (Ecopia Corporation, HMS-5000) using the van der Pauw contact configuration with the In contact.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical cell
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out in a three electrode cell attached to a potentiostat galvanostat (CH Instruments, CHI 660D). The nanostructured SnS films deposited FTO glass, Pt foil and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To observe the effect of the electrolyte on the PEC cell, the aqueous solutions of 0.1 M (K4Fe(CN)6) + 0.01 M K3Fe(CN)6, and 0.1 M Na2S2O3 and 0.1 M KOH were employed. An AAA class solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech Inc., model SS80) with a 75 mm × 75 mm field aperture under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) was used as a light source. The light intensity was calibrated by the certified standard silicon reference cell. For routine testing of the photoanode, a white high power LED (Wenrun, WR-295 EC150150UW-1000C-9P40) excited (600 W m−2) at 15.2 V DC with mechanical chopping at a frequency of 4 Hz was used. The LED source was calibrated with a solar power meter (KUSAM-MECO, KM-SPM-11). A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a sample interval of 0.1 mV was fixed during Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) (scan direction was negative to positive potential in all cases). The Mott–Schottky analysis (capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics) of photoelectrodes was carried out at an AC amplitude of 0.5 mV and a frequency of 1 kHz with a sample interval of 0.05 V from the reverse to the forward bias scan direction in the DC bias range from −1.0 V to 0.6 V. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PEC cells were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat attached with a frequency response analysis module. The EIS measurement for the developed PEC cells was carried out using an AC signal of amplitude 5 mV in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz superimposed by a DC bias from 0.05 to 0.5 V under actual dark conditions. The stability study (photo corrosion) was performed in bulk electrolysis mode with coulometry at an applied potential less than the on-set for the 0.1 M (K4Fe(CN)6) + 0.01 M K3Fe(CN)6 electrolyte with the SnS photocathode for 200 s to 2 h. All the PEC measurements were performed under a physically uninterrupted (no stirring, Ar or N2 bubbling or ultrasonication) environment. All measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a represents the XRD pattern of the nanostructured SnS deposited on the FTO coated glass substrate. The SnS material was considered to have an orthorhombic crystal symmetry with the space group of Pbnm (62) according to COD-AMSCD 9008785. The structural parameters derived for the α-SnS are shown in section S2 (ESI†). The background of the FTO reflection is masked with the recorded background XRD spectra (Fig. S2†). The structural and morphological properties of the employed FTO substrate are shown in section S3 (ESI†). The distinct peak at 2θ = 32° suggests that the film contains a crystallographic texture in the (004) orientation which is dominant. This indicates that majority of its grains with the total calculated exposed area of 52% were parallel to the substrate. As noted by Stevanović et al.14 it is equivalent to the orientation (100) according to the theory. The next dominant facets corresponding to 2θ = 31.54° were (111) with an area coverage of 26%. The above results agree well with our previous report on polycrystalline SnS films grown on glass substrates.14 The room temperature Raman spectra as shown in Fig. 1b demonstrate four peaks at 91, 161, 185, and 218 cm−1 which correspond to one Ag, one B3g (LO) and two Ag (LO), modes respectively. It closely matches with the Raman spectra reported for single crystal SnS.7,16,30,31 It may be noted that neither the major A1g mode (315 cm−1) for SnS2 nor that of Sn2S3 (153 cm−1) or SnO2 (472 cm−1) was visible in the spectrum. It reveals the phase purity of the spray deposited α-SnS, while no impurities, such as SnS2, Sn2S3 and SnO2 were present.16,30,32 The surface morphology as seen from the FE-SEM images taken at different magnifications, is shown in Fig. 1c. The low magnification image shows that the film was uniform and defect free. Higher magnification images reveal the formation of a randomly oriented slightly vertical petal-like SnS nanostructure on the FTO substrate with a higher surface to volume ratio. For understanding the growth of nanostructured α-SnS, the cross section of different layer thicknesses is shown in Fig. 1d. Initially a uniform few layered SnS was formed during the pyrolysis process on the FTO surface, later the surface energy changes dynamically and the growth becomes random and the layers of the SnS materials start the growth along the direction of spray. The average length of the petal kind microstructure was measured to be 280 nm in the inclined horizontal direction. The microstructure obtained as in agreement with that reported in SnS films synthesized using the vacuum techniques, such as atomic layer deposition,30 thermal evaporation,33 pulsed laser deposition34 and sputtering.35 It is interesting to note that the surface morphology as observed is highly beneficial for a photoelectrochemical reaction due to its high aspect ratio or surficial length. A qualitative assessment of the surficial length can be made through AFM as shown in section S4 (ESI†). The surficial length of α-SnS may be controlled by varying the thickness from 100 to 500 nm. The maximum surficial length ratio of 2.5 is possible for α-SnS with a thickness of 450 nm.

All samples were prepared under identical conditions as mentioned in section 2.1. 

Fig. 2 shows the optical properties of the nanostructured α-SnS film on the FTO substrate. The absorbance, transmittance and reflectance are shown in Fig. 2a. A 210 nm thick SnS film exhibited an excellent absorption characteristic with minimum reflectance in the visible range. The absorption coefficient (α) of the films was estimated by the relation, (1)where d, R and T are the thickness, reflectance and transmittance of the SnS film. The absorption coefficient α calculated for the developed nanostructured SnS was found to be in the range of 3.9 × 104 to 2.7 × 105 cm−1 for the visible range of the solar spectrum from 700 to 390 nm. Therefore, the 256 nm thick nanostructures of the SnS film can absorb the maximum of the visible solar irradiation. The α at the energy band gap and the peak wavelength of the AM 1.5G spectrum are highlighted in Fig. 2b. However, 60 nm thick nanostructures of the SnS film are sufficient to absorb the maximum spectrum density of incidental solar irradiation, which is illuminated at the wavelength of 530 nm. The bandgap, Eg of the SnS film was estimated by the Tauc plot as well as by a derivative as shown in Fig. 2c, where h and ν are the Planck's constant and the photon frequency, respectively, confirming that the direct Eg = 1.42–1.44 eV.27,36

In addition, the Tauc plot of the Kubelka–Munk function was applied to estimate both direct and indirect band gap transitions of nanoscaled SnS films. According to the Kubelka–Munk function relation, (2)
The Kubelka–Munk function F(R∞) is directly proportional to the absorption coefficient, and inversely proportional to the scattering coefficient (S), where R∞ is the diffused reflectance of the film.28,29 The obtained results are shown in Fig. 3, revealing the direct and indirect bandgap transitions at 1.45 eV and 0.9 eV, respectively.

The UV-Visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) exhibits the resultant optical properties of the mixed orientation of the nanostructured α-SnS. Moreover, Banai et al. and Stevanović et al. studied the optical properties and absolute band edge energies on the surface orientation of single crystal α-SnS using the density functional theory (DFT) for all surfaces, respectively.14,15 Both the properties were found to be anisotropic. The anisotropic optical properties are important for estimating the optimum thickness of the α-SnS layers for minimal reflectance from the surface.37–39 In order to develop a fundamental understanding on the energy band diagram, and the density of states of our nanostructured SnS, an ab initio approach was adopted and implemented for the α-SnS (the structural presentation of the super cell of α-SnS (Pbnm(62) in various lattice directions is shown in section S2†).7,14,15,40 The electronic structure of SnS was calculated within DFT using a screen exchange–correlation generalized gradient approximation functional developed by Armiento and Mattsson (GGA-AM05).41 All calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code,42 with the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach,43 a 258.7 eV default plane wave cut-off, and reciprocal space sampling of the 6 × 6 × 4 κ-point. Fig. 4a and b show the calculated electronic band structures and density of state. A direct optical band gap of 1.45 eV was evident at the Γ symmetry point. This value is very close to that determined by the Tauc plot and the method of derivative (Fig. 2c and d, respectively). Our calculation also exhibited an indirect band gap of 0.9 eV, which follows an allowed transition.44 However, the anisotropic nature of the band-structure causes an optical transition at some higher photon energies, close to 1.4 eV.30 The obtained energy band diagram and density of states closely match with previous reports.7,15 It is noteworthy that as the density of state is higher near the valence band edge, it improves the carrier (photogenerated holes) transport efficiency.7 Furthermore, Fig. 4c–e reveal the anisotropic nature of optical constants such as the dielectric constant (εr), refractive index (n) and extinction co-efficient (κ). In general, a combination of the anisotropic refractive index helps us to understand the measured resultant reflectance spectra. It shows excellent agreement between the experiment (spectroscopy ellipsometry) and theory implemented for estimating the anisotropic optical constant.15 Furthermore, the estimated optical constants were deployed for understanding the resultant reflectance and the required optimum thickness of the α-SnS top layer for minimal reflectance for the photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) as described in the following discussion.

The Mott–Schottky (MS) measurement was performed for the batch of α-SnS photoelectrodes with various thicknesses from 40 to 500 nm on the FTO coated glass substrate. The technique is detailed in section S5 (ESI†). The MS analysis allows us to make an accurate estimation of the flat band potential for a given electrolyte, carrier concentration and types of majority carriers. All photoelectrodes exhibited the positive slope of d(C−2)/dV, which confirms that all the SnS electrodes have n-type conductivity with electrons as the majority carrier. However, stoichiometric SnS is expected to exhibit p-type conductivity due to an intrinsic Sn-vacancy. The 1/C2vs. applied potential (V vs. Ag/AgCl) is shown in Fig. 5a. The SnS electrodes have exhibited reasonable capacitance in the range of μF for the given dark conditions. It favors the formation of the strong depletion region inside the SnS layer with respect to the reference electrode. The flat band potential, VFB = −0.49 eV was estimated with the 0.1 M K4Fe(CN)6 electrolyte. The donor concentration, ND of the photoanode SnS was calculated using the following relation,45 (3)
 Fig. 5  (a) Mott–Schottky plot for the nanostructured SnS based photoelectrode measured at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark, (b) estimated band edges and (c) space charge width as a function of applied potential. 
The ND value of 1.25 × 1015 cm−3 was estimated for the α-SnS photoanode. Therefore, the estimate values for the ΔEF, electron affinity (χ) and workfunction (ϕ) were 0.2, 4 and 4.2 eV, respectively. The estimated electrical parameters of SnS photoanodes carry great significance for developing the knowledge of the charge transport and space charge width useful for the PEC applications. The calculated energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 5b. The developed space charge width in the SnS photoelectrode for the given potential vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode is shown in Fig. 5c. A drift assisted transport in the space charge region at lower potentials in the nanostructued SnS layer is evident from this analysis, which helps enhance the collection efficiency of the photogenerated carriers. The reproducibility of the MS analysis was checked for a number of SnS electrodes and analyzed, which are shown in section S7 (ESI†). It shows that ND varies from 1014 to 8 × 1015 cm−3 for the produced batch of SnS electrodes. A similar result was obtained for the atomically thin SnS layer with n-type conductivity with the ND value7 of 6.7 × 1016 cm−3.
The photoresponse spectrum of the PEC cell under chopped white light illumination is shown in Fig. 6a. The onset potential (Von) of the cell was found to be 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The region below the flat band can be directly assigned to the accumulation of majority carriers on the electrolyte side and hence a cathodic photocurrent is possible in the n-type semiconductor. The region just above the flat band is the depletion region as the band starts to align in response to the applied potential. A logarithmic increase in the photocurrent up to an applied potential of 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl is found to be the highest among those reported to date. A further increase in the applied potential up to 1.3 V causes a linear increase in the dark as well as photocurrent due to the depletion in the inversion region. The solar to chemical conversion efficiency of 4.7% was estimated at an applied potential of 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (section S6 (ESI†)). The nanostructured SnS photoelectrodes with significantly higher photocurrent densities as compared to other SnS photoelectrode systems previously reported in the literature are listed in Table 1. The recorded photocurrent is several times higher than the previously reported SnS systems.27,36,46 This work demonstrates the effectiveness of optically anisotropic and nanostructured SnS absorbers that also work as antireflecting surfaces to further enhance the photoelectrochemical cell efficiency.

Fig. 6b shows the energy diagram of the developed PEC cell using the SnS anode and the Pt cathode, where the relative position of the SnS band edges and the redox levels of the electrolyte is shown. The photogenerated holes leaving the SnS valence band are accepted by the electrolyte and the oxygen evolution reaction occurs at the photoanode surface. On the other hand, photogenerated electrons leave the conduction band to reach the Pt-counter electrode through the external wire and the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs at the Pt surface. The visual evidence of the evolved oxygen and hydrogen gases on the SnS and Pt surfaces, respectively is shown in Fig. 6c. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (oxidation and reduction) are shown therein.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is an important tool to understand the nature and quality of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and the associated time constant of charge transfer that governs the PEC cell efficiency. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data of nanostructured SnS photoanodes were analyzed based on the equivalent circuit models, as shown in Fig. 7. In the equivalent circuit, RS, RJ and RC are the series resistance of the cell, recombination resistance and charge transfer resistance at the pore electrolyte interface, respectively. The impedance data of the nanocrystalline-SnS photoanode was best described by introducing constant phase elements, instead of capacitances. Here, CPE-I (QJ) and CPE-II (QC) are the constant phase elements related to the SnS/electrolyte interface including the double layer and capacitances of the pore electrolyte interface, respectively. The CPE impedances i.e., ZCPE defined by their respective CPE exponents and frequency independent constant as follows: (4)where Q is the capacitance and the exponent n is 1 for an ideal capacitor. The chemical capacitance is expected to occur at the interfaces, where the density of states on each side differs to a great extent. For the PEC cell under investigation, the aqueous electrolyte has an infinite density of states relative to the semiconductor film, which leads to a chemical capacitance in addition to the double layer capacitance. Fitting the equivalent circuit to all the experimentally obtained impedance spectra at different applied potentials leads to the estimation of RS, RJ, RC, CPE-I and CPE-II.47,48Fig. 8a–c show the set of Nyquist, bode amplitude and phase plots for the constructed PEC cell, respectively. It is noteworthy that the applied potential higher than 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl exhibited the CPE near to the ideal capacitance. It apparently attributes to an ideal depletion region and improved collections of the photogenerated carriers. The fitting parameters in each case are summarized in Table 2. The fitting parameters provided an insight into the charge transport across the nanocrystalline-SnS photoanode. As a result of the applied potential, the RS is decreased from 53 to 25.4 Ω. The CPE exponent is found to be more ideal for an applied potential of 0.4 and 0.5 V that signifies the formation of a nearly ideal junction. The junction's ideality is because of favorable depletion of strongly polarized free charge carriers in the SnS film. This facilitates the drift assisted transport of the photogenerated charge carries across the junction. Moreover, the CPE-II element remains less affected by the applied potential. The time constant calculated by the product of RC was an overall estimate without trying to separate the recombination and diffusion capacitances. Therefore, tj = RJCJ and tc = RCCbc will be simply referred to the overall time constants of the junction and the contacts, respectively.47,49–51 The magnitude of the circuit time constants represents the mean relaxation time of the respective interfaces. The time constant of the charge relaxation at the junction decreases from 5.5 ms to 1.75 ms for the applied potential VApp from 0.05 V to 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. However, tc remained unaffected in all the cases. The semicircular nature of the Nyquist plot of the PEC cell indicates the stability of the photoelectrode under the larger applied bias. It shows the great level of stability without any chemical degradation for a longer duration.

Furthermore, to obtain more understanding on the obtained larger photocurrent density, the multilayer antireflection coating for the constructed PEC cell was adopted. SnS benefit the anisotropic optical properties that facilitate various possible combinations of SnS layers on the FTO coated glass. In the case of PEC cells, the media for the light remains the aqueous electrolyte. The model formulation for the resultant surface reflectance from the combinations of the electrolyte, SnS layers and FTO is presented in section S8.† The refractive index of the FTO and electrolytes is shown therein. For various cases, the calculated reflectance was compared with the measured reflectance from the SnS surface. It provides an insight into the growth process of the SnS structures from one orientation to another. The best possible configuration is shown in Fig. 9, where the various thicknesses of the SnS-z orientation are varied as an optimization. The 50 nm thick SnS layer orientated in the z direction on the planar SnS layer provides a minimal reflectance through the nanostructured front surface leading to the highest absorption. The adopted approach is worth for other anisotropic two dimensional semiconducting materials for designing the optimum geometry and configurations. The recorded photocurrent density may be attributed to the reduced reflectance from the semiconductor electrolyte interface. A cartoon of the integrated SnS film PEC cells is shown in Fig. S13 of the ESI† to manifest the configuration that finally obtained the highest photocurrent density ever reported for the SnS film system.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a high quality SnS material and its nanostructure for possible integration of anisotropic optical and transport properties for application in photoelectrochemical cells. The thin film exhibited a direct optical band gap of 1.42 eV with a high optical absorption coefficient up to 2.7 × 105 cm−1 in the visible range of the solar spectrum. The fabricated photoanode had a favorable donor concentration of 1015 cm−3 with the flat band potential of −0.49 V vs. Ag/AgCl as confirmed by Mott–Schottky measurements. The fabricated device was characterized to have an enhanced absorption controlled by the thickness of the deposited layers. It may be attributed to an integrated anisotropic optical property of nanostructured α-SnS for which the reflectance is below 5% in the visible spectrum. The optimized device showed the highest photocurrent density of 7 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, making the nanostructured α-SnS a superior candidate for water splitting applications.
