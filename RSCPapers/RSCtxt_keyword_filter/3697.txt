    , Accepted 8th September 2020First published on 9th September 2020AbstractSolution processed CsPbX3 films usually present a high content of Pb0 clusters, acting as significant defects on the perovskite surface. Conventional electron transport materials, including PC61BM, TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and Nb2O5, can hardly passivate these defects. In this work, few-layered Eu2O3 nanoflakes (nano-Eu2O3) are prepared, which exhibit much higher redox activity towards Pb0/I0 than the commercial Eu2O3 powder. When nano-Eu2O3 is introduced as the buffer layer between the CsPbI2Br and PC61BM layers in inverted perovskite solar cells (PeSC), the devices deliver remarkably improved photovoltaic performance with an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.47% and a champion PCE of 14.09%, which is much superior to the control devices without nano-Eu2O3 (9.74/11.03%). A series of mechanism studies reveal that the addition of nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer enables not only more efficient hole-blocking but also remarkably enhanced defect passivation at the perovskite/PC61BM interface, both of which result in significantly reduced interfacial charge recombination. Besides, we show that the devices with nano-Eu2O3 exhibit obviously improved thermal stability with >90% PCE remaining after 400 h of thermal aging at 80 °C.
Introduction
In recent years, all-inorganic halide perovskites with the formula of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br) are emerging with a great potential for practical use due to their excellent thermal stability.1,2 Among the various CsPbX3 perovskites, black cubic CsPbI3 has the smallest bandgap of 1.73 eV, which makes it very suitable for photovoltaic applications. Inspired by this advantage, intensive efforts have been devoted to CsPbI3 based perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has boosted from ∼10% to ca. 19% in a few years.3,4 Nevertheless, the black cubic CsPbI3 usually suffers from phase stability issues, which may quickly convert to the yellow phase with a much wider bandgap of 2.82 eV under ambient conditions.5 In comparison, the black pseudo-cubic CsPbI2Br with a slightly wider bandgap of ca. 1.90 eV exhibits a higher phase stability due to its improved tolerance factor.6,7 CsPbI2Br based PeSCs have also been of great interest recently due to their fast-growing PCE. That is, a record PCE of 16.79% has been achieved for n–i–p type device,8 while it was 15.19% for the p–i–n type (inverted) device.9
Considering the wide bandgap of CsPbX3 (1.7–2.3 eV), it is ideal for constructing the top cell of tandem solar cells.10–13 An inverted device structure is of particular importance due to its feasibility of being applied in tandem solar cells.14 Besides, inverted PeSCs may employ an inexpensive and stable hole transport layer (HTL) based on inorganic compounds (i.e., NiOx),15 while n–i–p type PeSCs usually use Li-salt doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTL,6,16,17 which is otherwise expensive and unstable under thermal aging conditions. On the other hand, recently reported electron transport layers (ETLs) for all-inorganic inverted PeSCs include PC61BM,18 ZnO/C6015 and TiO2 quantum dots.19 In particular, PC61BM has the advantages of facile solution processing, high chemical stability and hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, the shallower HOMO (−6.1 eV) relative to the valence band maximum (VBM) of ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 makes PC61BM far from being efficient in blocking the hole-transfer. To solve this issue, in a previous work, we reported the use of c-Nb2O5(001) nanosheets with deeper VBM as the buffer layer between perovskite and PC61BM, resulting in much more efficient hole-blocking and hence remarkably improved VOC.20 It is also noted that PC61BM is a very weak Lewis acid, giving almost negligible passivation effect towards various Lewis acid or base-type defects at the interface of perovskite/PC61BM. Typically, the solution processed CsPbX3 films often present a high content of Pb0 clusters, which are one of the significant defects on the perovskite surface and may induce serious interfacial charge recombination. However, PC61BM alone cannot efficiently passivate this type of defect. As a result, previously reported PeSCs with pristine PC61BM as ETL usually delivered lower JSC and FF, as compared to the devices with a passivation layer. Thus, an ideal buffer layer between perovskite and PC61BM would be highly efficient in both hole-blocking and interfacial passivation.
A variety of transition metallic oxides (i.e., TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and Nb2O5) usually have wide bandgaps with the VBM deeper than −7.0 eV,21 which is beneficial for hole-blocking. However, they are highly chemically stable and hence almost inert towards various defects on the perovskite surface. Typically, in a state-of-the-art work, Wang et al. demonstrated that the Eu(acac)3 dopants may enable efficient passivation of the Pb0/I0 defects in organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite (i.e. MAPbI3(Cl) and (FA/MA/Cs)Pb(I,Br)3(Cl)) via a “redox shuttle” of Eu3+/Eu2+.22 In contrast, Eu2O3 powder was shown to be almost inactive towards these defects22 probably due to its more robust bulk structure relative to the Eu(acac)3 complex. In this work, we prepare few-layer Eu2O3 nanoflakes (nano-Eu2O3) via a simple peeling strategy. Control experiments reveal that the as-prepared nano-Eu2O3 exhibits significantly enhanced redox activity towards Pb0/I0. When using the solution-processed nano-Eu2O3 as the buffer layer between CsPbI2Br and PC61BM films, the device performance is significantly improved with a champion PCE of 14.09%. Moreover, the thermal stability is also enhanced upon using nano-Eu2O3. A series of mechanism studies reveal that the nano-Eu2O3 as the buffer layer results in not only more efficient hole-blocking but also significantly enhanced interfacial defect passivation.
Results and discussion
Few-layer Eu2O3 nanoflakes (nano-Eu2O3) were prepared by ball-milling lamellar Eu2O323 in EtOH solution. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 1a), the as-prepared nano-Eu2O3 shows a nanoflake morphology. The HR-TEM image in Fig. S2 (ESI†) clearly illustrates the local lattice fringes with a spacing distance of 2.8 Å, which is assignable to the (003) planes of nano-Eu2O3 (see Fig. S3, ESI†).23 The nanoflakes were further investigated using the AFM technique. As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S4a, b (ESI†), multiple nanoflakes with the size of 50–300 nm can be clearly identified, whose morphology is almost in line with TEM observations. The corresponding line profiles demonstrate that most of them are basin-like nanoflakes with an average thickness of 1–1.5 nm for inner part and a higher thickness of ca. 3 nm for the edge, indicative of their few-layer structures. A few nanoflakes with thickness up to 10–12 nm are also visible (Fig. S4c, ESI†), which might be attributed to spontaneous aggregation or insufficient exfoliation.

The redox activity of nano-Eu2O3 was estimated by using the method previously reported,22 and compared with that of commercial Eu2O3 powder (c-Eu2O3). As shown in Fig. 2a, nano-Eu2O3 and c-Eu2O3 were dispersed, respectively, in the solution containing I2 and Pb0 powders, followed by continuous stirring at 50 °C for 12 h. For the nano-Eu2O3/I2/Pb0 mixture, the solution gradually changed from dark brown to colourless with a large amount of light-yellow precipitate, indicating the formation of PbI2. In contrast, the mixture containing c-Eu2O3 remained brown in colour with very little yellow participate, indicating that c-Eu2O3 has low activity towards Pb0 and I0, in line with the literature report.22 The formation of PbI2 in the presence of nano-Eu2O3 was further confirmed through XRD measurements. The XRD spectrum (Fig. 2b) recorded for the as-formed yellow precipitate clearly demonstrates typical PbI2 patterns with 2θ = 12.7°, 25.9°, 39.5° and etc., while additional patterns with 2θ = 1.6° and 22.5° can be assigned to the remaining nano-Eu2O3. Nevertheless, these peaks are slightly up-shifted as compared to those of pristine nano-Eu2O3 (2θ = 10.3° and 20.8°), indicating a somewhat distorted lattice (with the lattice spacing reduced from d = 8.54/4.25 Å to 7.63/3.95 Å) in nano-Eu2O3 along with the formation of PbI2. This might be induced by the redox shuttle of Eu3+/Eu2+ during the reaction of Pb0 and I0. Based on the above-mentioned morphological characterizations, it is proposed that the few-layer nano-Eu2O3 may provide more surface area exposed to the reaction solution, which is beneficial for the absorption/desorption of reactants and hence promotes the redox reaction of Pb0/I0.

(b) XRD patterns of nano-Eu2O3 and the yellow precipitate formed in the presence of nano-Eu2O3/Pb0/I2. 
To better understand the high redox activity of nano-Eu2O3, a compositional study was performed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As clearly seen in the O 1s spectrum, the broad O 1s signal can be resolved into two peaks at 529.3 and 530.3 eV (Fig. S5b, ESI†), corresponding to the oxygen of Eu2O3 and absorbed oxygen, respectively.24 In the Eu 3d spectrum (Fig. S5c, ESI†), two major peaks are displayed at 1163.0 eV and 1133.5 eV, corresponding to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Eu3+, respectively.24,25 The additional minor peaks at 1155.0 and 1123.3 eV are assignable to Eu2+, indicative of the presence of oxygen vacancies, which may be beneficial for the electron-transfer between Pb0/I0 and hence promote their redox reaction.
Furthermore, to estimate the electronic effect of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed for the PC61BM film with nano-Eu2O3. The high binding energy cut-off region is provided in Fig. 3a. Accordingly, the work function (WF) of PC61BM/nano-Eu2O3 was calculated to be −3.88 eV, which is slightly higher (−4.07 eV) than that measured for pristine PC61BM, a value consistent with the literature report.26 Thus, the introduction of a thin nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer between perovskite and PC61BM results in a more smooth energy alignment (see Fig. 3b), which is beneficial for the interfacial electron transport. On the other hand, the Tauc plot of nano-Eu2O3 (see Fig. S6, ESI†) indicates a band gap (Eg) of ca. 3.7 eV, fully consistent with that derived from the reported conduction and valence-band edges of Eu2O3 (i.e., −3.68 vs. −7.3 eV).27,28 Based on the above results, it is certain that the VBM of nano-Eu2O3 is much deeper than that of PC61BM (−6.0 eV).29,30 Such an electronic band feature makes nano-Eu2O3 a more efficient hole-blocking layer than pristine PC61BM.

To investigate the photovoltaic effect of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, inverted CsPbI2Br PeSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/nano-Eu2O3/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag (see Fig. 3c). The cross-sectional SEM image of PeSC is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), in which the PC61BM layer with a thickness of ca. 50 nm can be clearly seen, while the nano-Eu2O3 layer is too thin to be identified. Nevertheless, the Eu elemental mapping image (SEM-EDS) suggests the uniform coverage of nano-Eu2O3 on the surface of the CsPbI2Br perovskite layer (see Fig. S8, ESI†).
The J–V characteristics of typical devices are provided in Fig. 4a and the extracted data are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the devices with nano-Eu2O3 exhibit greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 13.47%, ca. ∼40% higher than that (9.74%) of control devices without nano-Eu2O3. The PCE values derived from over 40 individual devices (23 for each type) are plotted as a histogram (Fig. 4b). Obviously, the devices with nano-Eu2O3 show a higher reproducibility with a narrower PCE distribution as well as a lower standard derivation of ±0.27% relative to that of control devices (±0.89%). In addition, the statistical analysis for all parameters is presented in Fig. S9 (ESI†). By introducing the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, the average VOC, JSC and FF are remarkably enhanced from 0.99 V/14.69 mA cm−2/67.3% to 1.14 V/15.28 mA cm−2/77.6%. Thus, the significant improvement in PCE can be attributed to all the enhanced parameters (VOC, JSC and FF). The champion PCE value of 14.09% is found to be among the best so far reported for the inverted CsPbX3-based PeSCs (see Table S2, ESI†).9,15,18–20,31–34

To verify the enhanced JSC, EQE spectra were measured for the typical devices with and without the nano-Eu2O3 layer, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4c, the EQE values are generally improved in the spectral region of 300–700 nm for the device with nano-Eu2O3. The integrated JSC is calculated to be 15.26 mA cm−2, matching well with that derived from the J–V test with an error of ∼5%. On the other hand, the series resistance (Rs) estimated for the device with nano-Eu2O3 is lower than that for the pristine device, in good agreement with the enhanced FF value. To evaluate the stabilized power output (SPO) of the device with nano-Eu2O3, the efficiency was measured at the Vmax of 0.90 V where maximum power output was achieved. As shown in Fig. 4d, the SPO is slightly decreased in the first 30 s and remains constant with an average value of 13.12% for a period of 250 s (totally 280 s), indicative of a high output-stability. The difference between SPO and J–V derived efficiency might be attributed to the hysteresis effect (Fig. S10, ESI†) of the inverted device.15
To better understand the working principle of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, a series of mechanism studies have been performed. Fig. S11 (ESI†) illustrates the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM films with or without nano-Eu2O3. Obviously, the perovskite absorption is slightly increased in a range of 330–500 nm upon the introduction of the nano-Eu2O3 layer. According to the literature result,20 the slightly enhanced perovskite absorption might be attributed to the scattering effect of nano-Eu2O3. On the other hand, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite film with and without the PC61BM layer are provided in Fig. 5a. The pristine CsPbI2Br perovskite film displays a strong PL at 664 nm, in line with the literature report.35 In comparison, a significantly quenched PL is observed for the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM film without or with the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, indicating very efficient electron extraction at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface. It is also noteworthy that the PL of the film with nano-Eu2O3 is blue-shifted by ca. 10 nm, as compared to those without nano-Eu2O3. It indicates that the defects on the surface of the perovskite film have been significantly eliminated upon the introduction of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer.38 Furthermore, the PL decay dynamics were studied by transient PL measurements. As shown in Fig. 5b, the PL decays of the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM films without and with nano-Eu2O3 are much faster than that of the pristine CsPbI2Br film. These decay curves are fitted using a bi-exponential function and the extracted data are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). It has been well established that the fast-decay process with a shorter lifetime of τ1 is related to the charge extraction by the respective interlayers, while the slow decay with a longer lifetime of τ2 represents the charge recombination in the radiative or non-radiative channel.39,40 Herein, very comparable fast-decay processes are observed for both films. That is, τ1 of 1.48 ns with a fraction of 39.6% and 1.58 ns with 37.3% for the films without and with nano-Eu2O3, indicating that the electron extraction efficiency is regardless of whether the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer is introduced. Nevertheless, their slow-decay processes are more different. In particular, the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM film with nano-Eu2O3 yields a shorter τ2 of 3.23 ns with a larger fraction of 62.7% as compared to those (τ2 of 3.66 ns with 60.4%) of the films without nano-Eu2O3. It indicates that the interfacial charge recombination is remarkably reduced upon the introduction of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer.

To further verify the passivation effect of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, the electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PC61BM/CsPbI2Br/nano-Eu2O3/PC61BM/Ag were employed. Their dark J–V characteristics are provided in Fig. 5c. According to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model,41 the voltage at which all the traps are filled is known as the trap filled limit voltage VTFL. Herein, the kink point of the J–V curves between the Ohmic region and SCLC region is identified as VTFL. The trap density (Ntrap) is calculated using the equation Ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/ed2,42,43 where ε0, ε, e and d represent the vacuum permittivity, dielectric constant (8.5 for perovskite),44 elementary charge and thickness of the CsPbI2Br film, respectively. The Ntrap value is calculated to be 5.30 × 1016 cm−3 and 7.07 × 1016 cm−3 for the devices with and without nano-Eu2O3, respectively. The lower Ntrap value indicates an impressive effect of nano-Eu2O3 in mitigating the interfacial defect density. Moreover, to confirm the above proposal, the dependence of VOC on the variation of light intensity was probed for the devices with and without nano-Eu2O3. As plotted in Fig. 5d, the device with nano-Eu2O3 shows a weaker VOC dependence on the illumination intensity with a slope of 1.54kBT/q, while the control device yields a stronger VOC dependence with a slope of 3.04kBT/q. It has been well known that weaker VOC dependence usually points to more efficiently suppressed interfacial charge recombinations.45 The above results again indicate that the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer plays an important role in passivating the interfacial defects.
Furthermore, to clarify the origin of the defects (i.e., in bulk or at the interface), we measured the electroluminescence (EL) of the devices with and without nano-Eu2O3. The EL spectra were recorded with a forward bias of 1.0 V, where the carriers are directly injected through the contacts. Both spectra (Fig. 5e) exhibit a distinct peak at around 650 nm, which is related to the band-to-band emission of the CsPbI2Br perovskite layer. Nevertheless, the device with nano-Eu2O3 displays a much stronger emission than that without nano-Eu2O3. As the injected charges from the contacts do not recombine through the bulk perovskite, the significantly enhanced emission certainly indicates that the remarkably reduced nonradiative and/or radiative charge recombinations upon nano-Eu2O3 are at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface.46
In addition, the dark J–V characteristics of the PeSCs with or without the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The device with nano-Eu2O3 exhibits reduced dark current density at reversed bias as compared to that without nano-Eu2O3. It indicates that the introduction of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer results in reduced leakage current, which might be attributed to the more efficient hole-blocking and passivation effect with the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer. This result is in line with the enhanced VOC as well as the higher shunt resistance (Rsh) derived from the J–V curve measured for the device with nano-Eu2O3 under illumination conditions. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at 0.8, 0.5 and 0.2 V bias in the dark for the devices without and with nano-Eu2O3. As shown in Fig. 5f and Fig. S13 (ESI†), either device yields only one semicircle without the transmission line behaviour, indicating that it experiences strong recombination.47,48 The EIS spectra were analysed by fitting them with an equivalent circuit that includes a parallel combination of a recombination resistance (Rrec) and a capacitance. The extracted Rrec values are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). Generally, the device with nano-Eu2O3 shows a larger semicircle with larger Rrec, as compared to those of the pristine device, regardless of the bias voltage. Thus, the order of Rrec is fully consistent with the device performance. The larger Rrec can be interpreted as follows: the nano-Eu2O3 layer between the perovskite and PC61BM layers is highly efficient in suppressing the charge recombination, hence facilitating the extraction of photo-induced carriers.
It has been well recognized that the interfacial layer is also essential in attenuating the degradation of PeSCs.49 To illustrate the stabilizing effect of nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, the devices with and without nano-Eu2O3 were aged at 80 °C under N2-atomosphere. The PCE degradation over aging time is plotted in Fig. 6a. It is clearly seen that the device with nano-Eu2O3 could maintain over 90% of the initial value over 400 h under the thermal aging conditions. In comparison, the device without nano-Eu2O3 degraded quickly with ca. 50% PCE loss under the same conditions. Thus, the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface plays an important role in enhancing the thermal stability of PeSCs. To uncover the stabilizing mechanism of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer, the CsPbI2Br films with and without nano-Eu2O3 after thermal aging (80 h at 80 °C) were studied using XPS. Clearly in Fig. 6b, as compared to the sample without nano-Eu2O3, the sample with nano-Eu2O3 displays I 3d peaks with slightly lower binding energy (ΔBE = 0.25 eV), indicating that I− was better preserved in the presence of nano-Eu2O3.21 On the other hand, in the Pb 4f spectra (Fig. 6c), the minor peaks corresponding to Pb0 can be identified for the sample without nano-Eu2O3, while it is almost negligible for that with nano-Eu2O3. These results indicate that the presence of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer efficiently attenuates the degradation of surface perovskite to Pb0 and I0. It is in line with the above experimental evidence that the nano-Eu2O3 may enable efficient passivation of Pb0/I0 defects at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface.

Conclusions
In summary, few-layer Eu2O3 nanoflakes (nano-Eu2O3) are prepared using lamellar Eu2O3 powder as the precursor through a simple ball-milling process. The as-prepared nano-Eu2O3 exhibits remarkable redox activity towards Pb0/I0, far outperforming the commercial Eu2O3 powder. When nano-Eu2O3 is employed as the buffer layer between CsPbI2Br and PC61BM layers in the inverted PeSCs, an average PCE of 13.47% is obtained with all improved photovoltaic parameters. The champion PCE of 14.09% is found to be among the best so far reported for the all-inorganic PeSCs with inverted configuration. A series of mechanism studies demonstrate that the introduction of the nano-Eu2O3 buffer layer results in greatly suppressed interfacial charge recombination, which can be attributed to more efficient hole-blocking as well as significantly improved passivation at the CsPbI2Br/PC61BM interface. Moreover, the devices with nano-Eu2O3 exhibit substantially improved thermal stability with >90% PCE remaining after 400 h thermal aging at 80 °C. Thus, our studies provide a new strategy in the design and construction of the interfacial layer in inverted all-inorganic PeSCs.
