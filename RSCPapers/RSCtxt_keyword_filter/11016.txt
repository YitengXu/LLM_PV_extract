    , Accepted 17th December 2014First published on 22nd December 2014AbstractPolyoxometalate (POM)-based organic–inorganic hybrid systems II1–II7 are designed as p-type dyes containing double D–A1–π–A2 chains. The A1 spacers are thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, thienothiadiazole units or their combinations and the A2 spacer is hexamolybdate. The electronic structures, absorption spectra, and electronic transition characteristics of systems were systematically studied on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of systems II1–II7 were below the valence bond (VB) of NiO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of studied systems were higher than the I2/I3− redox level, which benefit hole injection and dye regeneration. The HOMOs of systems II1–II4 were predominantly delocalized over the organic groups and MoN, which are more helpful to hole injection than systems II5–II7. Introduction of thienothiadiazole units is an effective way to improve the light absorption ability of dyes, and inserting thiophene and 1,2,3-triazole as A1 spacers can increase the efficiency of dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).
1. Introduction
Solar energy is regarded as a perfect energy resource owing to its advantages over fossil fuels such as huge reserves, inexhaustibility and pollution-free character. The optimal way to convert solar light to electric energy directly is based on photovoltaic. Since the seminal work reported in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are superior to other solar cells such as crystalline Si, semiconductor (e.g., GaAs)-based cells, thin-film (e.g., CdTe) solar cells, and organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, and have been considered to be a promising generation of photovoltaic techniques due to their unique biomimetic operating principle.1 In a general way, most organic sensitizers adopt a typical electron donor–π, bridge-electron acceptor (D–π–A) configuration for facilitating photo-induced charge separation.2 Recently, the novel concept “D–A–π–A” has been proposed for designing novel organic sensitizers.3 Diverse kinds of electron-withdrawing units were incorporated into the π bridge as an “electron trap” to tailor molecular structures and optimize energy levels.
DSSCs based on dye with two anchoring acceptor groups exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than its counterpart having one anchoring group, which has been reported by Won et al.4 It was also found that the dyes based on carbazole and two acceptor anchoring groups (rhodanine-3-acetic acid) are better than corresponding dyes with a single anchoring group.5 The organic dye featuring two cyanoacrylic acid-anchoring groups bridged by a low-band-gap chromophore, dithienylthienothiadiazole, has been synthesized. Results indicate that the additional acceptor-anchoring group in the sensitizer induced a significant influence on the absorption spectra and DSSC performance.6 The aromatic amine dyes bearing double D–π–A chains have been synthesized by Hong et al. and superior properties to dyes with a single D–π–A chain have been demonstrated.7 These phenomena resulted from the added D–π–A units optimizing the absorption spectra and benefitting retardation of back electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye or electrolyte.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of metal–oxygen cluster compounds that have advantageous properties, such as redox properties, photochemical response, ionic charge, conductivity and ionic weights.8–10 Their diverse applications in the fields of catalysis, medicine, electrochemistry, photochromism and magnetism have been explored experimentally and theoretically.11–18 Recently, new applications of POMs in DSSCs have been reported. Xu combined POMs with phthalocyanine and CdS films, respectively, to improve their photoelectron chemical performance by facilitating photogenerated electron transfer and retarding electron recombination.19,20 POM-based multilayer film was adopted by Wang to modify Pt counterelectrodes and ZnO polyhedrals. Both methods improved the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.21,22 POM-based photovoltaic materials with hexamolybdate clusters in the main chain of poly-(phenylene acetylene)s and side chains of conjugated polymers were synthesized by Peng, which show intense absorption in the visible range and possess great potential for applications in photovoltaic cells.23,24
Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) methods were employed to rationally optimize optical and electrochemical properties of dye molecules.33–36 In our previous work,25,26 properties of different organoimido-substituted hexamolybdates as sensitizers for DSSC have been theoretically studied with the combination of DFT and TD-DFT, indicating that POM-based organic–inorganic hybrids with both long π-conjugated bridge and auxochrome can be highly efficient DSSC dyes. The phenanthroline ligand covalently modified at the 2 and 9 positions by an aminophenyl hexamolybdate substituent has been reported.32 Results provide strong evidence for an intramolecular charge-transfer process with the formation of a phenanthroline cation radical and a reduced hexamolybdate. Herein, we aim to design novel dyes combining the advantages of both POM-based organic–inorganic hybrids and double D–A1–π–A2 chains. In D–A1–π–A2 chains, the electron-withdrawing unit and hexamolybdate cluster are adopted as the A1 and A2, respectively. Here, the modified phenanthroline ligand was chosen as the parent system I. The system II0 was designed by introducing the carboxyl as the anchor group. The chemical modification on individual dye units is an effective way to tune the redox potential and absorption properties of D–π–A organic dyes.37–39 To deepen understanding of the relationship between chemical structures and properties, a series of systems II1–II4 were designed with inserting different A1 spacers, such as thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, and thienothiadiazole units. To design systems II5–II7, thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, and 1,3,4-oxadlazole rings were inserted into system II4. All structures of designed systems are shown in Fig. 1. Their electronic properties, optical properties and performances in DSSC were systematically studied.

2. Methods
2.1. Theoretical background
It is well known there are five dominant steps (dye excitation, hole injection, geminate recombination, dye regeneration and I3− regeneration) in the work of p-type DSSCs.27 (See detailed information in S1, ESI.†)
Based on the working theory, the effective way to enhance the efficiency of p-type DSSCs is by improving light harvesting efficiency (LHE), hole injecting efficiency (HJE), dye regeneration efficiency (DRE) and reducing charge recombination efficiency (CRE).
The LHE is closely related to the oscillator strength f of dye corresponding to λmax, which is expressed as:28 LHE = 1 − 10−f(1)
The free energies (in eV) of HJE, DRE and CRE are ΔGinj, ΔGreg and ΔGCR, respectively. They can be expressed as the following equations:29 ΔGinj = EVB − (E00(dye*) + E(dye/dye−))(2) ΔGreg = E(I2/I3−) − E(dye/dye−)(3) ΔGCR = E(dye/dye−) − EVB(4)where EVB is the valence bond potential of the semiconductor, E00(dye*) is the excited-state sensitizer energy, and E(dye/dye−) is the sensitizer reduction potential. E(I2/I3−) is the reduction potential of the redox mediator. Accordingly, the lower ΔGinj, ΔGreg and higher ΔGCR may result in greater efficiency of dye in DSSCs.
2.2. Computation details
All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.30 Geometries of all systems were fully optimized with the Cs symmetry constraint by using B3LYP, which is the combination of Becke's three-parameter hybrid treatment with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional31 in solution (n,n-dimethylformamide). The solvent effect was employed by the polarizable continuum model (PCM). For atoms O, C, N, S and H, the standard 6-31G(d) polarized double-ξ basis set was adopted. For the relativistic effect, the Mo atom was adopted as the effective core potential (ECP) double-ξ (DZ) basis set of LanL2DZ. For TDDFT calculations, based on the optimized ground-state geometries, the range-separated hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP was employed and the LanL2DZ basis set was used for the transition metal Mo, whereas the nonmetal elements were described by the 6-31G(d) basis set in n,n-dimethylformamide; and PCM was also employed in TDDFT calculations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electronic structures
In the p-type DSSC principle, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of dye must be situated under the valence band edge of the semiconductor for ensuring a high hole injection quantum yield. Furthermore, the regeneration reaction of the sensitizer with I−/I3− must be thermodynamically allowed, wherein the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the sensitizer is above that of the mediator. The plots of molecular orbital energy diagrams of systems II1–II7 are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the HOMO levels of systems are below the VB of NiO. For systems II1–II4, the HOMO levels increase in the following order: system II3 < system II2 < system II1 < system II4. The introduction of the 1,2,3-triazole and 1,3,4-oxadlazole can lower the HOMO energy, which benefits the hole injection from excited dye to the VB of NiO. Among the designed dyes, the LUMO energy of system II5 is largest due to the insertion of thiophene and thienothiadiazole units. It may reduce the hole injection quantum yield as the HOMO level is close to the VB of NiO. The LUMOs of all systems were suitably located above the redox couple of I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV), which benefited the dye regeneration process. The introduction of different units had little effect on LUMO levels.

In order to obtain fast hole tunneling from the sensitizer excited state into the VB of NiO, the HOMO distribution of dye should significantly extend on the anchoring groups and overlap with the VB orbital of NiO. The LUMO of dye should be located far from the NiO to reduce hole combination. The frontier molecular orbitals of systems II1–II7 are shown in Fig. 3. The electron distributions of HOMOs in systems II1–II4 are predominantly delocalized over the organic groups and the MoN. Whereas for systems II5–II7, the HOMOs are mainly delocalized over the inserted units (thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, thienothiadiazole) and benzene rings in the organic groups because of long π-conjugation. The LUMOs of systems II1–II6 are localized on the hexamolybdate clusters. As for system II7, the LUMO was localized on both the hexamolybdate clusters and thienothiadiazole rings. The HOMOs of systems II1–II4 are more in favour of hole injection than those of systems II5–II7. Therefore, the suitable π-conjugation length is important to improve hole injection quantum yield.

3.2. UV/vis absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of systems I and II0 were investigated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by using PCM in n,n-dimethylformamide. In the TDDFT calculation, the 80 lowest singlet–singlet transitions were evaluated to obtain the absorption spectra. The calculated excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and corresponding dominant MO transitions are listed in Table 1. The calculated results reveal that the most intense transition of system I was found at 3.22 eV (385 nm), which is in close agreement with the experimental data, that is, 3.22 eV (384 nm). Therefore, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) is accurate in predicting the electronic absorption spectra of designed systems. Introduction of the carboxyl group in system II0 had a slight effect on the absorption spectrum. The most intense transitions of systems I and II0 occurred from the combination of H − 1 → L + 6 and H → L + 7 transitions; the corresponding molecular orbital distributions are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The electron distributions of HOMO and HOMO − 1 in systems I and II0 are predominantly delocalized on the organic groups and the MoN. The LUMO + 6 of systems I and II0 were localized on both the organic groups and hexamolybdate clusters, while the LUMO + 7 were localized on hexamolybdate clusters. It can be seen that the absorption actually originated from mixing two types of electron transitions, the charge transfer from the organic donor fragment to the POM cluster and the π → π* transition within the organic donor fragment. The same phenomenon can also be seen in the electron density difference maps of systems corresponding to S0 → S1 in Table 1.

To clarify the effect of different π-conjugation spacers (thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, thienothiadiazole units or combinations of the same) on the absorption spectra, the TD-DFT calculations were performed on systems II1–II7. The computed maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax/nm), oscillator strengths (f), transition natures and the electron density difference maps of systems corresponding to S0 → S1 are shown in Table 2. Compared with system II0, the maximum absorption wavelengths of systems modified by thiophene, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, and thienothiadiazole units are red shifted. It is notable that the maximum absorption of system II4 is found at 657 nm, which is obviously red-shifted by 273 nm. For systems II5–II7, the maximum absorption wavelengths increase in the following order: system II6 (607 nm) < system II7 (611 nm) < system II5 (694 nm). Compared with system II4, the maximum absorption of systems II6 and II7 is blue-shifted. The insertion of 1,3,4-oxadlazole and 1,2,3-triazole units into system II4 blue-shifts the absorption band while the introduction of thiophene red-shifts the absorption band.

The maximum absorption bands of systems II1–II4 are originated by the electron transfer from the organic group to the hexamolybdate cluster. This kind of electron transition benefits hole injection from excited dye to the VB of NiO. As for systems II5–II7, the electrons mainly transfer within the organic groups. The phenanthroline ligand and hexamolybdate cluster give slight contributions for electron transition, which may result from the long π-conjugations between them, and is not beneficial to hole injection and increases the hole combination.
To further clarify the light absorption ability of dyes, the absorption spectra of systems II1–II7 are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. The results in Fig. 4 indicate that both systems II1 and II3 had two absorption bands. Systems II2 and II4 had one and three absorption bands, respectively. The introduction of 1,2,3-triazole was not conducive to optimizing the light absorption properties of dyes. System II4 had a strong and broad absorption band in the 500–900 nm range due to the insertion of the thienothiadiazole unit. This spectrum had a good overlap with the sunlight spectrum and improved sunlight utilization. For systems II6 and II7, one of the absorption bands was in the 300–450 nm range and the other one was in the 500–900 nm range. Compared with systems II6 and II7, both absorption bands of system II5 were red-shifted, which were in ranges of 300–500 nm and 550–1000 nm. The absorption spectrum of system II5 contained near ultraviolet, visible and near infrared regions, which was the best in the designed dyes. Therefore, introduction of the thienothiadiazole unit was an effective way to improve the light absorption ability of dyes. If both the thienothiadiazole and thiophene units are inserted, the light absorption can be further improved.

3.3. Performance of dyes in DSSCs
In principle, for p-type DSSCs, the efficiency dye should have high LHE, HJE, DRE, but low CRE. Therefore, the LHE, ΔGinj, ΔGreg and ΔGCR of systems II1–II7 are compared and displayed in Table 3. The LHE of systems II1–II7 are in the range of 0.97–1.00, indicating that the system's various A1 spacers had little effect on the LHE. The ΔGinj and ΔGreg of all systems are negative, which is beneficial to hole injection and dye regeneration. Systems II1–II3 have higher HJE than systems II4–II7 because of the more negative ΔGinj. System II5 has the lowest HJE due to the highest ΔGinj. The introduction of thienothiadiazole as A1 spacers increased the ΔGinj and lowered the system's HJE. The ΔGreg of systems II1, II2 and II5 are more negative than systems II3–II7, which may result in higher DRE. The ΔGCR for all systems are positive, which can hinder the charge recombination. Systems II1, II2 and II5 have higher ΔGCR than other systems, which may induce lower CRE. Inserting thiophene and 1,2,3-triazole as A1 spacers can modify the system's energy level and result in higher HJE and DRE but lower CRE.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a series of POM-based organic–inorganic hybrids containing double D–A1–π–A2 chains were designed. The A1 spacers included thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadlazole, and thienothiadiazole units or combinations of same. The hexamolybdate cluster acted as an A2 spacer. The electronic structures, absorption spectra, and electronic transition characteristics of designed systems were systematically studied on the basis of TDDFT calculations. The HOMO levels of systems II1–II7 were below the VB of NiO and the LUMO levels were higher than the I2/I3− redox level, which benefited hole injection and dye regeneration. Introduction of the thienothiadiazole unit was an effective way to improve the light absorption ability of dyes. If both the thienothiadiazole and thiophene units are inserted, light absorption can be further improved. The absorption spectrum of system II5 had good overlap with sunlight, which contains near ultraviolet, visible and the near infrared region, so the II5 system is expected to have excellent performance for DSSCs. The present work is helpful for the design of effective dyes with target properties to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.
