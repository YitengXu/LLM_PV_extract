    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 8th November 2022AbstractNovel Ag-based thin film solar cells have attracted extensive attention in recent years in the photovoltaic (PV) field due to their outstanding properties like a high light absorption coefficient, low toxicity, abundance, and an appropriate band gap. The emerging Ag-based thin film materials such as Ag2S, AgBiS2, Ag3CuS2, AgInS2, AgBiSe2, Ag2ZnSnS4, Ag(In1−x,Gax)Se2, AgaBibIc, Cs2AgBiBr6, and Cu2AgBiI6 are becoming ideal materials for light absorbing layers in the new generation of PV devices. Although the efficiency of ATFSCs has improved significantly in recent years, it is much lower than those of other PV devices. The relatively low efficiency of ATFSCs is mainly caused by structural defects such as poor crystallinity, voids, and instability which occur during the preparation of light absorbing layers. This paper defines the concept and classification of Ag-based materials and introduces in detail a thin film preparation method by overcoming structural defects. Finally, the vision of achieving high-efficiency ATFSCs by improving structural defects is proposed.
1 Introduction
Thin film solar cells are the most competitive solar technology within the photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to the low cost of preparation, simplicity, and stability of the process.1–3 Si, CIGS, and CdTe based solar cells, with the highest photoelectric conversion efficiencies of 27.6, 24.9, and 22.1%, respectively, are currently the main commercial thin film solar cells.4,5 However, their large-scale industrial production is limited by the relatively low absorption coefficients of Si-based solar cells near the infrared region, high cost and low reserves of Te, In, and Ga, and toxicity and environmental destruction due to Cd.1,5 Although organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells have exhibited excellent photoelectric properties in recent years, the toxicity of lead (Pb) and instability of devices have hindered their commercialization. Therefore, it is important to explore new, environment-friendly, and low-cost PV materials with good photoelectric performance.
Ag-based materials refer to element Ag containing compound semiconductors, with rich reserves, environment friendliness, low preparation cost, a relatively simple process, a high light absorption coefficient, and radiation resistivity. Ag-based compounds have been studied widely in the fields of light, electricity, heat, and magnetism due to their good electrical properties.6–10 They are mainly used in energy equipment, such as solar cells. The advantages of Ag-based compounds enable the development of modern photovoltaics in new directions, like (i) good chemical and thermodynamic stability as well as compatibility, (ii) high charge mobility of Ag-based chalcogenide/halogenate compounds, (iii) a relatively stable oxidation state of Ag (+1) which disables the introduction of defects related to other oxidation states, and (iv) an adjustable optical band gap.
As an ideal material for light absorbing layers, Ag-based semiconductor thin films have become a research highlight for thin film solar cells of the new generation.6,11 Novel Ag-based thin film solar cells (ATFSCs) are based on silver-based compounds used as a light absorption layer. The silver-based thin film material has a direct band gap and a high light absorption coefficient. In addition, only the silver-based compound thin film with a thickness of 0.4–2 μm can absorb most of the incident sunlight. The novel silver-based semiconductor film is considered a very promising light absorption layer material. This paper focuses on the latest studies of the new ATFSCs. Ag-based thin films are classified into two kinds of semiconductor materials on the basis of chemical components: Ag-based chalcogenide compounds, including Ag2S, AgBiS2, Ag3CuS2, AgInS2, AgBiSe2, Ag2ZnSnS4, and Ag(In1−x,Gax)Se2, and Ag-based halogen compounds including AgaBibIc, Cs2AgBiBr6, and Cu2AgBiI6; their structure and optical properties are shown in Table 1. Although these Ag-based compounds have remarkable absorption coefficients and appropriate band gaps, the photoelectric performance of the new ATFSCs is generally poor, which is mainly ascribed to the carrier recombination caused by structural defects, including poor crystallinity, the secondary phase, voids, and instability. Therefore, the decrease of structural defects of the functional layer is critical for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of devices.

The efficiency of the devices is determined by the quality of the absorbers since the absorbers of Ag-based compounds are the core of the new ATFSCs. Generally, the absorbers of highly efficient ATFSCs have lesser structural defects. The high quality of the absorber films is closely related to the preparation method, selection of materials, and conditions. These factors must be noted as they are critical to the experimental process. Since the study of new ATFSCs is still in the preliminary stages, studies on the preparation conditions of the absorbers are significant for further improvement of the device efficiency.
Herein, the latest studies of new ATFSCs are reviewed with the focus on preparation, selection of materials, and design of device structures of Ag-based chalcogenide and halogen-based thin film solar cells. Additionally, preparation methods and laws of new Ag-based thin film materials are summarized, which may help beginners to understand ATFSCs. Finally, the future development of new ATFSCs is proposed.
2 New ATFSCs: materials and devices
Ag compounds are a new light absorbing material with potential for industrial applications in multi-compound thin film solar cells. Thin-film photovoltaics absorb most of the incident light, which is an important prerequisite for the fabrication of high-performance optoelectronic devices. The new silver-based thin-film solar cells have higher theoretical efficiency and a higher absorption coefficient. Fig. 1(a)–(i) present the absorption spectrum images of the novel silver-based semiconductor film materials to evaluate the resulting absorption range of different absorber layers. In recent years, new ATFSC devices have emerged with breakthrough device efficiencies. The structural defects, including poor crystallinity, voids, and instability, are the main cause of the low efficiency of ATFSCs. They cannot be eliminated completely but can be reduced by optimizing the preparation process. The preparation processes of ATFSCs to reduce structural defects are summarized as follows.

2.1.1 Ag2S thin film solar cells. 
The adjustable band gap (Eg = 0.9–1.1 eV), high absorption coefficient (104 cm−1), low toxicity, high chemical stability, and wide spectral response (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) of Ag2S are the basic necessities for the fabrication of high-performance cells.6 The device structure, preparation methods of the absorber, and the PV performance of the reported Ag2S thin film solar cells are summarized in Table 2.

A few reports on the preparation of Ag2S thin film solar cells mainly include chemical bath deposition (CBD),13 spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD), sol–gel,37 successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR),38 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), thermal evaporation,39 sulfidation40 and direct metal surface element reaction (DMSER).3 The SILAR and DMSER are the most commonly used preparation methods for Ag2S thin films. In the DMSER, a layer of the Ag precursor film is sputtered on the substrate, which is then transferred into a solution containing sulfur (S). High-quality Ag2S thin films have been obtained under different conditions.
For the first time in 2001, Lokhande et al.41 used the SILAR method to prepare thin film solar cells with Ag2S as the absorber. Their device structure was FTO/Ag2S/electrolyte. Simple processes, low cost, controllable film thickness, and easy large-scale film preparation are the most attractive advantages of the SILAR. However, it has some inevitable disadvantages like large roughness on the film surface and easy film fall-off from the substrate, due to which obtaining high-quality absorbers and further improvement of device efficiency are seriously hindered.
Zheng et al.3 developed a new method to prepare absorbers and fabricated a heterojunction solar cell for which the device structure was ITO/Ag2S:P3HT/Au, the thickness of a single Ag2S nanosheet was 50–60 nm and there were a lot of voids between the nanosheet arrays; the photoelectric conversion efficiency of 1.61% was obtained as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). Subsequently, Fang et al.14 used a hydrothermal method to deposit a high-quality absorber and used SnO2 as the electron transport layer to improve the device efficiency to 2.1%. As shown in Fig. 2(e)–(f), the magnetron sputtered Ag particles and the reaction-generated Ag2S nanocrystals have nonuniform diameters in the range of 60–80 nm and 60–150 nm, respectively. The device structure and J–V curves of Ag2S thin film solar cells are shown in Fig. 2(g), (h) and (b), respectively. In recent years, Zheng et al. have worked on optimizing the device structure and selecting appropriate electron and hole transport layers to improve the efficiency of Ag2S thin film solar cells. Although these attempts did not result in any breakthrough in device efficiency, they laid the foundation for the further development of Ag2S thin film solar cells.

Although the DMSER has the advantages of simple operation, low cost, and easy preparation at room temperature,31 the resultant films have poor crystallinity and weak adhesion on the substrates, which is the main reason why there are no breakthroughs in the efficiency of Ag2S thin film solar cells. Currently, the quality of the absorber thin film and the selection of materials for electron and hole transport layers are the key reasons why the efficiency of Ag2S thin film solar cells is much lower than its Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit. The SQ limit can be optimized by various strategies such as selecting hole and electron transport layer materials with energy bands of better matches, preparing Ag2S thin films using environment-friendly solvents with fewer carbon chains, and inverting device structures.


2.1.2 AgBiS2 thin film solar cells. 
AgBiS2, a semiconductor material of type I–V–VI, has the advantages of a direct band gap (1.0 eV), good stability, and a high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1).33,34 AgBiS2 thin films can be easily obtained through the solution method and SILAR. In recent years, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of AgBiS2 thin film solar cells has increased constantly, and the highest value reached is 9.1%.21
The device structure, absorber preparation method, and PV performance of the reported AgBiS2 thin film solar cells are summarized in Table 3. A planar depleted-heterojunction (PDHJ) is the most used structure in AgBiS2 thin film solar cells. The absorber is prepared by the layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition of the previously synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals. However, continuous deposition of the multilayered film may result in agglomeration of the absorber, which leads to the surface capture of carriers generated and promotes recombination. For the first time in 2016, Konstantatos et al.11 synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals of environment-friendly elements by the low-temperature thermal injection method using oleic acid (OA) as a ligand which is shown in Fig. 3(a). The successful preparation of AgBiS2 nanocrystals was a milestone in the study of AgBiS2 thin film solar cells. The obtained AgBiS2 nanocrystals were encapsulated by OA, resulting in poor electrical properties, and no significant improvement was achieved by replacing OA with ethylene dithiol (EDT). Researchers used tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI) to replace the OA ligand. The halide ligand with a small size can effectively promote carrier transport between AgBiS2 nanocrystals resulting in 6.3% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the prepared device.11 As shown in Fig. 3(b), AgBiS2 nanocrystals prepared by TMAI exchange maintained high stability after water treatment, and the binding energy, chemical composition, and crystal composition showed no change.45

Hu et al.20 improved the solubility of Ag+ in the precursor solution using oleamine (OLA) as the ligand to obtain AgBiS2 nanocrystals of high quality. Uniform size, homogeneous distribution, controllable element stoichiometry, and good ligand adhesion are the advantages of the as-prepared AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Nanocrystals can arrange more closely during the preparation of thin films, resulting in a significant increase in carrier mobility and photosensitivity and improving the performance of solar cells. Moreover, this improved preparation method provides a possibility for the synthesis of other Ag-based nanocrystalline systems.
Kontanstatos et al. optimized the low-temperature thermal injection synthesis method to obtain colloidal AgBiS2 nanocrystals with a larger average size.11 They used a two-step thermal injection method rather than the one-time injection of stoichiometric S sources to prepare nanocrystals for the first time.46 A small amount of the S source is first injected to provide seeds for nucleation. Subsequently, the remaining S source is injected dropwise at a lower speed for the full reaction to obtain high-quality nanocrystals. The average diameter of the obtained nanocrystals increases from 4.3 ± 1.3 nm by the one-step injection method11 to 6.5 ± 3.6 nm for the two-step injection method.46
Simultaneously, Oh et al. improved the size and distribution of the crystals by optimizing the synthesis route of colloidal AgBiS2 nanocrystals (AgBiS2NCs) to improve the PV performance.47 Traditional synthesis methods involving thermal injection of the S source into metal oleate solution are unable to provide a balance between nucleation and growth, resulting in small size and uneven distribution of AgBiS2NCs. Oh et al. added ODE into the OA solution containing the metal source as a non-coordination solvent, which can significantly control the change of OA concentration after the S source injection, resulting in a homogeneous reaction between the metal and S sources, as shown in Fig. 3c. After assembling the device, the maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency of AgBiS2 thin film solar cells is 5.94%, and the open circuit voltage (Voc) is 0.52 V. Ming et al.48 prepared Pb-free AgBiS2 quantum dots with less toxic MeOAc as solvent. The as-prepared devices have good efficiency and stability, and the PCE of AgBiS2 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (AgBiS2QDSCs) is 4.57%.
The charge transfer ability can be improved significantly by replacing the original long-chain ligands with short-chain ligands in AgBiS2NCs. However, traditional solid-state ligand exchange (SSLE) can lead to inhomogeneous aggregation, wide band tail, and large defect density of AgBiS2NCs, leading to low Voc of the device. Additionally, SSLE is a time-consuming and high-cost process for thin film preparation. Bae et al.49 converted the long chain ligands of AgBiS2NCs into short ligands based on halogenated metal salts using solution-phase ligand exchange (SPLE). The one-step deposition was enabled by obtaining AgBiS2 nanocrystalline ink with high concentration by successfully exchanging the original OA ligand with [AgI2]−. Compared with the traditional SSLE, the device prepared by SPLE has a higher ligand exchange degree, narrower band tail, and lower defect density, leading to higher Voc of the device. Additionally, the solid AgBiS2NCs prepared by SPLE can effectively use EDT as the ligand to improve the PV performance, and 4.08% PCE is achieved for the device.
All the preparation methods mentioned so far for AgBiS2NCs are based on thermal injection, as a high temperature and an inert atmosphere are required. Kontanstatos et al.50 developed a new method of ligand exchange based on ethyl mercaptan (ET) for synthesizing AgBiS2NCs in air at room temperature. In this method, AgI and BiI3 are dissolved in amine, followed by successive addition of appropriate amounts of ammonium sulfate and 1-octadecyl mercaptan, resulting in AgBiS2NCs obtained after washing and purification. Wu et al.33 developed an in situ growth method to obtain AgBiS2 nanorods by spin coating the precursor solutions of AgCl, BiCl3, and thiourea on the substrate. This simple method provides a new way for the synthesis of nanomaterials and promises further breakthroughs in device efficiency through the passivation of bulk phase defects and further optimization of device structures.
The spin coating technology, which is usually used in the preparation of AgBiS2 devices, has some inevitable problems which impact the film quality significantly, including uneven deposition, solvent residue, air humidity, and oxygen. However, AgBiS2NCs can grow in situ directly on the electron transport layer (ETL) through the SILAR method, avoiding the problems of insufficient ligand exchange and solvent residue during the spin coating process effectively, thus reducing the interface defects.51 For the first time in 2013, Huang et al.44 reported AgBiS2 absorber prepared by SILAR and 0.5% PCE for the device. Subsequently, Yanez et al.51 improved PCE to 2.87%.
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is the most suitable ETL for AgBiS2 thin film solar cells thus far due to the matching energy levels between ZnO and AgBiS2, simple preparation process, and good transmission characteristics. Although titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the traditionally used ETL for AgBiS2 thin film solar cells, the large gap in the conduction band offset between TiO2 and AgBiS2 can cause serious recombination of the carriers at the interface, hindering the further improvement of device efficiency. ZnO nanowires are also used as ETLs in AgBiS2 thin film solar cell devices.52 Although ZnO is stable, it inevitably absorbs moisture during preparation in the air, causing AgBiS2 to decompose into Ag2S and Bi2O3. Moreover, oxygen and light can accelerate the degradation rate.53,54
In the exploratory phase of the AgBiS2 solar cell, a liquid electrolyte (polysulfide) was initially used as a hole transport layer,55 which was later replaced by a fast ion conductor because of its poor stability. The use of a PTB7 hole transport layer makes the efficiency of the AgBiS2 device exceed 6%. The manufacturing process of PTB7 is complex, so it must be used with the unstable molybdenum oxide (MoO3) film to extract photocurrent efficiently. Researchers select an inorganic hole transport layer (HTL) for the device with good hole transporting ability and defect passivation ability to reduce cost. Nickel oxide (NiO) has been used in the HTL, resulting in a p–i–n structure and excellent stability of the devices.56 AgBiS2 devices with NiO in the HTL exhibit good stability even on exposure to extreme conditions of high temperature and humidity. The application of an inorganic HTL can improve hole collection ability and device efficiency due to bandgap matching, low cost, and high stability.
However, the current world record efficiency of AgBiS2 solar cells is 6.4%, which is much lower than that of their perovskites and CIGS solar cells. It is mainly due to the unoptimized energy level structure at the AgBiS2 NC/PTB7 hole-transporting layer (HTL) interface of AgBiS2 solar cells. Kim et al. demonstrated a novel AgBiS2 NC/organic hybrid solar cell structure. Using PBDB-T-2F as the hole transport layer with a lower highest occupied molecular orbital level, with significant gains in open-circuit voltage (Voc), the efficiency of the AgBiS2 device finally increases from 3.3% to 7.1%. In addition, by adopting PBDB-T-2F:BTP-4Cl as a hole transport layer to obtain high Jsc, the AgBiS2 power conversion efficiency reaches 9.1%.57
Since 2013, researchers have improved the device efficiency by adjusting the preparation process of AgBiS2NCs and optimizing the device structure. According to our review of the literature, AgBiS2 thin film solar cells prepared by the SILAR method are one of the most effective devices with a breakthrough efficiency since no ligand exchange is involved. Additionally, wrinkles and unevenness during spin coating are avoided. Furthermore, the p–i–n structure has higher stability and efficiency than the traditional n–i–p structure.


2.1.3 Ag3CuS2 thin film solar cells. 
Zheng et al.26 prepared Ag3CuS2 thin films with a band gap of 1.25 eV by in situ synthesis at room temperature. In this method, Cu and Ag metal layers were sputtered on an ITO substrate, followed by immersion of Ag/Cu/ITO in an ethanol solution containing S powder, resulting in good quality Ag3CuS2 thin films obtained after four hours at room temperature. The efficiency of ITO/Ag3CuS2/P3HT/MoO3/Ag and ITO/Ag3CuS2/PTB7/MoO3/Ag was 0.79% and 0.31%, respectively. For the first time in 2015, Liu et al.27 used a simple hydrothermal method to prepare Ag3CuS2 absorber materials on ZnO nanoarrays which was then used for hybrid solar cells. The ZnO seed layer/ITO substrate was placed in the growth solution to prepare hexagonal ZnO nanoarrays. The ZnO nanoarray/ITO substrate was immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M thioacetamide, and the ZnS core/shell nanotube array/ZnO/ITO was prepared after the hydrolysis reaction. Subsequently, CuS and Ag2S nanoarrays were deposited by chemical conversion using an ion-exchange mechanism. Finally, CuS/Ag2S nanocrystals were treated at high temperature to obtain ITO/ZnO/Ag3CuS2 nanoarrays, as shown in Fig. 4. The device with an ITO/ZnO/Ag3CuS2/P3HT/Pt structure has 2.01% PCE.

Scanlon et al.25 studied AgCuS and Ag3CuS2 compounds experimentally and theoretically and applied them to the field of PV due to their good electronic structures, suitable direct band gaps, and good application prospects. However, the optical behavior and spectral limit maximum efficiency (SLME) of Ag3CuS2 indicate that if it is used as an absorber, its severe optical loss will hinder the further improvement of device performance. Furthermore, AgCuS is expected to become a new force in the field of PV due to a satisfying band gap (1.25 eV), good carrier mobility, higher SLME, and stronger light absorption supported by theoretical calculations. Additionally, the conduction band offset of Ag3CuS2 and ZnS is more suitable and conducive to the transmission and collection of electrons than that of ZnO. It can be predicted that the AgCuS thin film solar cell with the Sn/AgCuS/ZnS/FTO structure has good prospects for development.


2.1.4 AgInS2 thin film solar cells. 
The ternary material of AgInS2 has a large absorption coefficient and an adjustable band gap (1.87–2.03 eV).34 Peng et al.34 prepared AgInS2 nanocrystals with different sizes and morphologies by heat injection at different temperatures and for different times using solvents mixed with octadecene, OLA, and dodecyl mercaptan. The size and morphology of the AgInS2 nanocrystals strongly depend on the thermal injection temperature. The nucleation and growth of the AgInS2 nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 5. AgInS2 nano-crystals can disperse in toluene solvent and form a uniform and crack-free micron-scale precursor film on the FTO substrate by spin coating. High-quality AgInS2 films can be obtained by annealing the precursor films at 450 °C for 30 minutes in argon (Ar) and S atmospheres, respectively. This solution-based method provides a doable strategy for preparing AgInS2 absorber thin films. Au/polysulfide compound electrolyte/AgInS2/FTO had 0.50% PCE. Sunil et al.17 used a two-step process (sputtering the metal precursor before vulcanization) to prepare AgInS2 thin films and investigated the influence of different vulcanization temperatures on their electrical properties. The obtained AgInS2 thin films have p-type conductivity. The PCE of the obtained FTO/AgInS2/ZnS/Ag heterojunction solar cell device increased from 0.3% to 0.9% with the decrease in the window layer thickness.

2.1.5 AgBiSe2 thin film solar cells. 
In 2021, Konstantatos et al.18 provided a simple and effective method to prepare AgBiSe2 nanocrystals by using a solvent mixed with alkyl amine and alkyl mercaptan at room temperature. Additionally, they reported, for the first time the preparation of an absorber based on the solution of AgBiSe2 colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs), and a device efficiency of 2.6%. Moreover, they also studied the synthesis of the alloyed AgBixSey CNCs in detail and verified that a simple ratio change of Se/S, which can be achieved by a simple method of mixing the anionic precursor, can adjust the band gap of CNCs.


2.1.6 Ag2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells. 
In 2016, Ma et al.22 prepared p-type Ag2ZnSnS4 (AZTS) thin films successfully by vulcanizing the precursor thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering. The band gap and hole mobility of AZTS thin films were about 1.5 eV and 219.24 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Moreover, the efficiency of the AZTS thin film solar cell with a Mo/AZTS/CdS/ZnO/ITO/Ag structure was 1.38%. In 2022, Sonali et al.24 synthesized AZTS quantum dots (QDs) successfully by a simple solvothermal method. The preparation process of AZTS QDs includes four steps: uniform dispersion of the solute in ethanol, a high temperature and high pressure reaction, centrifugation and washing as shown in Fig. 6. The AZTS solar cells with a Mo/AZTS QD/CdS/ZnO/Al structure have good stability, and 6.28% PCE.
 Fig. 6  Flow chart of AZTS QD preparation.24 


2.1.7 Ag(In1−x,Gax)Se2 thin film solar cells. 
Ag(In1−x,Gax)Se2 (AIGS), a chalcopyrite I–III–VI2 semiconductor, has an adjustable band gap from 1.2 eV (AgInSe2)59 to 1.8 eV (AgGaSe2).60 Different types of AIGS thin film solar cells have been reported, such as p-AGS/n-CdS,61 p-AIS/n-CdS,62 and p-AIGS/n-ZnCdS29 heterojunctions. However, the efficiency of AIGS thin film solar cells has not been satisfactory so far. Despite being a promising PV material, there are few studies on AIGS cells. Currently, SLG/Mo/AIGS/CdS/ZnO/Ag is the most used device structure of AIGS solar cells. In 2005, Nakada et al.63 used a three-step method using an MBE system to deposit AIGS thin films on molybdenum substrates. The time, substrate temperature, and the distribution of the Ag/(In + Ga) atomic ratio at each deposition stage are shown in Fig. 7(a). First, In, Ga, and Se co-evaporate at a substrate temperature of 250 °C, and then Ag and Se evaporate at 550 °C. The content of Ag in the thin film is lower and higher than its stoichiometric ratio at this stage and the stages of decreasing substrate temperature, respectively. The decrease in substrate temperature may be caused by the different thermal emissivity of AgSe from AIG. The performance of AIGS thin film solar cells strongly depends on the Ga/(In + Ga) and Ag/(In + Ga) atomic ratios. Finally, Ag(In0.2,Ga0.8)Se2 thin film solar cells have 9.3% PCE.
 Fig. 7  (a) Time curve of the flux, substrate temperature, and Ag/(In + Ga) atomic ratio of AIGS deposition.63 (b) Temperature curve of high-temperature annealing.64 (c) Substrate temperature curve of the cladding method proposed.65 
In 2006, Ag(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells prepared using the same method had 7.3% PCE.28 In 2012, this research group prepared Ag(In,Ga)Se2 thin films using an improved three-step deposition method. As shown in Fig. 7(b), high-temperature annealing can improve the diffusion coefficient of Ag and the performance of the absorber. Consequently, Ag(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells had 9.2% PCE.64 In 2013, this research group used the improved three-step deposition method to obtain AIGS thin films with uniform Ag distribution. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the Ag–Se layer is pre-deposited at 350 °C, and then treated at 600 °C. The top Ag–Se layer prevents the desorption of indium (In) from the thin film at high temperatures effectively. The highest PCE of the device is 10.7% when the In/(In + Ga) ratio in AIGS thin films is about 0.15.65
In 2017, Nakada et al.66 decreased the interface recombination of CdS/AIGS by introducing ZnS(O,OH) to replace the CdS buffer layer. The device performance results showed that the significant decrease of the fill factor (FF) is mainly attributed to the conduction band shift of the ZnS(O,OH)/ZnO interface preventing electron transport under forward bias. The introduction of double buffer layers of CdS/ZnS(O,OH) can effectively control the conduction band offset of buffer layer/AIGS and buffer layer/ZnO interfaces. Finally, the corresponding devices obtained had 9.4% PCE. Simultaneously, Nakada et al.67 used high deposition and annealing temperatures to prepare AIGS thin films. It is shown that at higher deposition and annealing temperatures, the diffusion rate of Ag is higher, and its distribution is more uniform. Additionally, the grain size of AIGS films also improves at a higher temperature. However, at high temperatures AIGS thin films decompose with In desorption, resulting in crystallinity deterioration and negatively impacting device performance. It is also shown that at 600 °C annealing temperature, the AIGS film has the best crystallinity, and the absorber film does not decompose or desorb. Finally, the obtained device had 6.4% PCE.

Table 4 summarizes the device structure, absorber preparation method, and PV performance of the reported Ag3CuS2, AgInS2, AgBiS2, Ag2InSnS4, and Ag(In1−x, Gax)Se thin film solar cells.

2.2 Ag-based halogenated compound thin film solar cells

2.2.1 AgaBibIc thin film solar cells. 
With the advantages of a suitable band gap (1.63–1.87 eV), environmental friendliness, and high stability, silver bismuth iodide (Ag–Bi–I) is a neglected new PV material.68–70 It is composed of a monovalent Ag+ cation, a trivalent Bi3+ cation, and an I− anion. The general structural formula of Ag–Bi–I is AgaBibIc, (c = a + 3b), such as AgBiI4, AgBi2I7, Ag2BiI5, and Ag3BiI6.70 The structure formation of Ag–Bi–I compounds depends on several parameters, including components, annealing conditions, and preparing methods. The mesoporous heterojunction is the most widely used structure of Ag–Bi–I thin film solar cells. The device structure, absorber preparation method, and PV performance of the reported AgaBibIc thin film solar cells are summarized in Table 5.

Currently, the solution method is mostly used to prepare Ag–Bi–I thin films. In this method, Ag–Bi–I thin films are prepared by spin coating of precursor solution and post-annealing, wherein the photoelectric properties are affected significantly by the quality and morphology of the thin films. Unlike BiI3, AgI has poor solubility in the usually used organic solvents dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature. According to the literature survey, AgI can be dissolved in R-NH2. In 2016, Sargent et al.68 reported the first Ag–Bi–I thin film solar cell. N-Butylamine was used as a solvent to prepare the precursor solution. The AgBi2I7 thin film was obtained, and the device had 1.22% PCE. Later, Zhu et al.71 prepared the precursor solution by dissolving AgI and BiI3 in solvent butylamine. The Ag2BiI5 absorber film was obtained, and the device had 2.0% PCE.
The anti-solvent treatment is usually used to control the crystallization of Ag–Bi–I in solution and obtain high-quality absorber films. The introduction of an anti-solvent (toluene,70 chlorobenzene,72 and isopropanol73) can reduce the solubility of solute rapidly, thereby increasing the nucleation sites to form a dense film. Turkevych et al.70 reported a precursor crystal obtained by a solid-state reaction in a sealed tube. The ground powder was dissolved in DMSO to get a precursor solution. Finally, the prepared Ag3BiI6 device had a PCE of up to 4.3%. Similarly, Jung et al.74 also dissolved the powder in the solvent mixture of DMSO, DMF, and HF to prepare Ag2BiI5 thin film solar cells, with a final PCE of 2.31%. The solid-phase reaction for Ag–Bi–I preparation has harsh conditions and high costs. Therefore, Ghosh et al.75 prepared AgBiI4 thin film solar cells by dynamic hot casting at room temperature without the need for anti-solvent treatment during the preparation. AgI and BiI3 are dissolved in the solvent mixture of DMSO and DMF to prepare the precursor solution of the absorber. Then, the uniform and stable precursor solution is spin-coated on a preheated substrate to form a film with large and dense crystalline grains. Finally, Ag2BiI5 and AgBiI4 thin film solar cells were obtained, with 2.62 and 2.2% PCE, respectively. Pai et al.76 introduced sulfide into the precursor solution to adjust the electrical properties of the absorber. The deposition process of the AgaBibIa+3b−2xSx thin film is shown in Fig. 8(a). The preparation process of AgaBibIa+3b−2xSx includes four steps: dissolving of AgI, BiI3 and Bi(S2CAr)3 in DMSO + DMF + HI mixed solvent, spin coating/annealing, blowing argon onto the film surface to promote the volatilization of high-boiling polar aprotic solvents and assisted crystal growth, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The band gaps of AgBiI4, Ag2BiI5, Ag3BiI6, and AgBi2I7 decreased by 0.1 eV after vulcanization, and the maximum values of the valence band increased by 0.1–0.3 eV. Ag3BiI6 thin film solar cells reached 5.44% efficiency. In 2020, Yu et al.77 doped caesium (Cs) into Ag–Bi–I semiconductor materials to synthesize a series of CsaAg1−aBiI4 thin films. Compared with the efficiency of basic devices, the average PCE of CsaAg1−aBiI4 solar cells increased by 40%. The introduction of Cs improves the crystallinity in mesoporous and planar structures, reducing the non-radiative recombination at the interface and promoting the carrier transport by the valence band increase of the film. Compared with AgBiI4, Cs can stabilize the performance of solar cells. Fig. 8(b) shows the changes in the film morphology, energy band, and J–V curve before and after the introduction of Cs.

Recently, the Ag–Bi–I thin film solar cells of planar heterojunctions have attracted the attention of researchers. Thin films of dense TiO2 and SnO2 were mostly adopted as ETLs. Khazaee et al.35 used a simple two-step process of co-evaporation deposition followed by post-annealing to prepare polycrystalline films of Ag–Bi–I with different stoichiometric ratios, such as AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, and Ag2BiI5. With different components and the increase in pinhole density, the surface morphology of the film turned from rough (>3 μm) to smooth (<100 nm). A thin film solar cell with an FTO/TiO2/AgBiI4/P3HT/Au structure was fabricated with an AgBiI4 absorber material, and the device had 0.9% efficiency. The adoption of a planar structure design between the dense electron transport layer of TiO2 and the thin film of AgBiI4 is more beneficial to charge extraction compared with traditional mesoporous interfaces.
In 2019, Zhang et al.72 introduced Li-TFSI (2 wt%) into the precursor solution of AgI:BiI3 and prepared AgBiI4 solar cells of planar heterojunctions successfully. ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au had 2.50% PCE. TFSI is conducive to the growth of thin films and improvement of crystallinity due to the ease of coordination in organic salts. Fig. 8(c) shows the PV performance and morphology of the device before and after the addition of Li-TFSI. In 2022, Zhai et al.73 treated the AgBiI4 thin film with the antisolvent isopropanol (IPA) to prepare a device of the planar heterojunction with the structure of ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au. The PCE of the device increased from 0.82% to 1.61%. The results show improved electrical properties of the absorber films treated with IPA. Consequently, appropriate selection of the antisolvent with a low boiling point and high compatibility with the main solvent provides a possibility of improving the performance of AgBiI4 thin film solar cells.


2.2.2 Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film solar cells. 
Cs2AgBiBr6, a double perovskite semiconductor material, is a potential candidate for solar cell materials due to its suitable indirect band gap (1.98–2.3 eV), high absorption coefficient, better environmental stability, and long carrier lifetime.78 The device structure, absorber preparation method, and PV performance of the reported Cs2AgBiBr6, thin film solar cells are summarized in Table 6.

Presently, solution and steam methods are mostly used to prepare Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films. There are two methods to prepare the Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution: (I) grinding the single crystal or polycrystalline Cs2AgBiBr6 into powder and then dissolving it in an organic solvent, such as DMSO, or (II) dissolving the corresponding halide (CsBr, AgBr, and BiBr3) into the organic solvent directly. The two-step annealing process is usually used to fabricate high-quality absorber films by the solution method: (I) the precursor solution is preheated, and the substrate is kept at 75 °C to increase the surface coverage of the film and improve the film quality. (II) The pre-formed film is placed on a hot table at more than 250 °C to anneal until the solvent volatilizes completely and the Cs2AgBiBr6 film is obtained.
The addition of an appropriate anti-solvent such as isopropanol79 and chlorobenzene80 during the preparation or low-pressure auxiliary treatment81 of the film can improve the quality of the absorber film. The prefabricated film is transferred into a low-pressure chamber (<20 Pa) for a certain time for the low-pressure auxiliary treatment; it is then annealed to remove the organic solvent. As shown in Fig. 9(a), Xiu et al.82 used the capillary assisted method to successfully prepare uniform Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films at a large-scale. The annealing of pre-formed films in DMSO steam to assist the grain growth of the Cs2AgBiBr6 absorber was first proposed by Shadabroo et al.83 Absorber crystallization can be promoted by adding volatile methyl ammonium bromide (MABr)84 to the Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution. As a result of the optimization, the defect density was reduced, the carrier lifetime was prolonged, and the electron extraction efficiency of the electron transport material became higher.

Presently, the poor raw material solubility of the precursor acts as a barrier to the preparation of the absorber thin film of quaternary material Cs2AgBiBr6. CsBr and AgBr have relatively low solubility in most solvents, including DMF, DMSO, NMP, and GBL. Although the highest solubility of Cs2AgBiBr6 in DMSO is about 0.6 M, the high boiling point of DMSO hinders the preparation of high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 films. The introduction of a binary solvent mixture (DMSO + DMF) during the preparation of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films can reduce the nucleation sites, reduce the pores in the thin films and increase the grain size of the absorber.85 Recently, Daem et al.86 reported the preparation of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films by the ultrasonic spray method for the first time.
The Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film preparation process based on the gas phase method can be divided into four categories. Wang et al.87 prepared large grain size Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films by vapor deposition for the first time: AgBr, BiBr3, and CsBr were deposited in order with a molar ratio of 1.5:1:2, and then a two-step annealing process was adopted to obtain Cs2AgBiBr6 with high purity, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Fan et al.88 used the single source vapor deposition method to prepare Cs2AgBiBr thin films for the first time: high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals were ground into powder, then Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were prepared by single source vapor deposition, finally absorber films with good crystallinity, excellent gloss, and few holes were obtained by annealing at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 9(c).
Burwig et al.89 proposed a vacuum process involving multi-source co-evaporation and thermal annealing to prepare Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films directly. The vapor deposition method has a higher requirement for the single crystal degree of Cs2AgBiBr6, which can be adjusted by controlling the cooling rate.88 Igbari et al.90 compared the Cs2AgBiB6 perovskite solar cell (PSC) preparation process by vacuum sublimation and by solution treatment. Compared to the vacuum sublimation method, the films prepared by solution treatment have higher crystallinity, a lower band gap, longer minority carrier lifetime, and higher ion mobility. The efficiency of the Cs2AgBiBr6 device prepared by solution treatment and vacuum treatment was 2.51 and 1.41%, respectively. It was shown that the low quality of thin films and poor performance of devices were primarily due to the major component deviation of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films from the stoichiometry. However, the solution treatment method can form high-quality multi-component perovskite films by stabilizing the components of the films and controlling the stoichiometric ratio.
However, the reason that limits the further improvement of CZTSSe device efficiency is the poor film quality, and the rapid crystal growth leads to substantial non-radiative recombination. Li et al.91 obtained high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite solar cells by introducing a functional polymethylmethacrylate interfacial layer on the absorber layer surface to avoid direct contact between the electron transport layer and carbon layer. Defect reduction implies that the interface recombination-induced energy losses is effectively suppressed within the device, improving the charge transport process within the interface, which will thus be beneficial to increase the device efficiency to 2.05% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.18V.
Yang et al.92 improved Cs2AgBiBr6 absorber layer crystallinity by adding formamidine acetate to the precursor solution. The introduction of additives promotes the grain size increase, a smoother film surface crystal structure remains unchanged and the defect density of the absorber layer decreases. The best Cs2AgBiBr6 thin-film solar cell achieves 2.09% efficiency due to the open circuit voltage being as high as 1.23 V. In addition, the Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cell still maintains more than 90% of the initial efficiency after being stored for 40 days, showing good stability. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of the best Cs2AgBiBr6 device after hydrogenation treatment reaches 6.37%.
To solve the problem of limited light absorption capacity caused by the large band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film materials, Zhang et al.30 found that the band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 was reduced from 2.18 eV to 1.64 eV by hydrogenation treatment. The interstitial doping of atomic hydrogen in the Cs2AgBiBr6 lattice could not only adjust its valence and conduction band energy levels but also optimize the carrier mobility and carrier lifetime.
Presently, Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film solar cells still have low PCE due to the intrinsic and structural defects of the materials. Since Cs2AgBiBr6 has a large indirect band gap (∼2 eV) and a small light absorption range,78 the band gap narrowing or indirect–direct band gap conversion can effectively enhance the light absorption capacity of Cs2AgBiBr6 and improve its device efficiency. The band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be lowered using cation doping or special treatment, such as In3+,93 Sb3+,94–96 Tl3+,97 Sn2+,98 Cu2+,99 Fe2+,100 Zn2+,101 and S2− anion modification,102 crystal engineering, and high-temperature treatment under high pressure.103–105 Surface passivation can effectively reduce the recombination of carriers at the interface and improve the lifetime of carriers. A layer of a surfactant such as OA106 applied on the surface of the film can passivate the surface defects of the Cs2AgBiBr6 film, and the introduction of an appropriate intermediate layer can optimize the energy level arrangement at the interface and reduce surface defects. Introduction of intermediate layers, such as multifunctional dye N719,107 a zinc chlorophyll derivative (Zn-chl),108 and a carboxyl chlorophyll derivative (C-Chl),109 can broaden the light absorption range and improve the efficiency of Cs2AgBiBr6 PSC devices.
The carrier recombination dominated by the absorber and the interface is the main reason for the severe performance loss of Cs2AgBiBr6 PSCs. Cs2AgBiBr6 PSC devices benefit from the wide band gap, suitable position of the conduction band, and long lifetime of the carriers when TiO2 is used as an ETL. However, the development of Cs2AgBiBr6 PSCs is restrained by the high-temperature preparation, low electron mobility, and UV instability under continuous illumination.
ZnO with a direct band gap has a suitable band gap (∼3.4 eV), high electron mobility, high thermal stability, good electro-chemical stability, low preparation cost, and excellent photo-electric performance. Alam et al.110 selected ZnO nanorods as the ETL to prepare the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film solar cells with an FTO/ZnO-NR/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/C structure with 4.48% PCE. Spiro-OMETAD and P3HT are the mostly used HTLs in Cs2AgBiBr6 PSC devices; however, they are not suitable for double PSCs due to the mismatch of energy levels. Yang et al.111 found that the Cs2AgBiBr6 device with poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as the HTL had a PCE of up to 1.26%. The experimental results show that when Zn-chlorophyll108 was used as the HTL of Cs2AgBiBr6 batteries, the recombination of interface carriers reduced and the device efficiency improved to 2.79%, which is 22–27% higher than that for the traditional HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT, and PTAA). Xiao et al.112 first prepared an environment-friendly inorganic Cu2O thin film with energy band matching, good electrical performance, and low preparation cost using the vacuum vapor deposition method and used it as an HTL. The device had 1.52% PCE.


2.2.3 Cu2AgBiI6 thin film solar cells. 
Rosseinsky et al.31 first synthesized thin films treated with stable Cu2AgBiI6 compound powder, crystals, and solution. The Cu2AgBiI6 thin film was prepared by spin coating the precursor solution of AgI, CuI, and BiI3 in the solvent mixture of DMSO and DMF; it was then annealed at low temperature to obtain the Cu2AgBiI6 thin film with a thickness of 280 nm. The device with an FTO/SnO2/CuAgBiI6/Spiro-OMeTADA/Ag structure had 0.43% PCE. Zheng et al.32 prepared Cu2AgBiI6 thin films by one-step solution treatment at low temperatures. AgI, CuI, and BiI3 were dissolved in DMSO, and pyridine was added to enable the solvent to dissolve the solute to form a transparent precursor solution, to obtain high-quality Cu2AgBiI6 films. The Cu2AgBiI6 thin film surface was passivated by phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI), resulting in its energy band moving up. Finally, the device with an ITO/SnO2/CuAgBiI6/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure was designed, and the efficiency reached 1%, as shown in Fig. 10.

3. Conclusions: methods and rules
The latest research progress of new ATFSCs was reviewed in this paper, with a focus on the preparation of Ag-based chalcogenide and halogen-based absorbers for thin film solar cells, the selection of charge transport materials, and the structure design of devices. The preparation methods and rules of new Ag-based thin film materials were summarized.
3.1 Ag-based chalcogenides
There are mainly three methods to prepare Ag-based chalcogenide thin films: the SILAR, solution method, and DMSER. For the SILAR: (I) the substrate (ITO or FTO) was immersed into the solution with an Ag source (AgNO3 and AgCl), and the excess Ag ions on the film surface were removed. (II) The film was immersed into a solution with a S source (S powder, thiourea, thioacetamide, and sodium thiosulfate) for the chemical reaction of continuous ion layer adsorption, and the Ag-based film was finally obtained.
The solution method is divided into two categories: (I) in situ growth: the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving thiourea, Ag salt, and other metal salts in an organic solvent, and then the Ag compound film was obtained by spin coating and removing the organic solvent by annealing. (II) Non-in situ growth: Ag-based chalcogenide nanocrystals were prepared, and then dissolved in a suitable solvent for the precursor. Finally, high-quality films were obtained by spin coating, and the solvent was removed by annealing. For the DMSER, Ag and other metal layers were sputtered on ITO or FTO, then the preformed film was sunk in a solution with a S source (ethanol and DMF) for reaction, and the ideal thin film was obtained.
3.2 Ag-based halogens
Currently, the Ag-based halide films are mainly prepared by solution and gas phase methods, wherein the solution method is similar to that in Section 3.1. Anti-solvent or low-pressure treatment was used to control the crystallization process of Ag compounds to obtain high-quality absorber films. Additionally, solvent mixtures were introduced to improve the solubility of metal halide salts to reduce the nucleation sites of Ag-based halide films effectively and improve the crystallinity of the films.
There are two vapor phase methods: (I) the halide salt was vapor deposited sequentially as per a certain molar ratio, and then the absorber film was obtained by two-step annealing. (II) The high-quality Ag-based halide compound nanocrystals were ground into powder, and high-quality thin films were obtained by vapor deposition of a single source or multiple sources followed by high-temperature annealing.
4. Summary and prospects

Fig. 11 shows the challenges and prospects of the development of ATFSCs. Although significant progress has been made in the past few decades, there is a long way to go in terms of the PCE of CZTSSe, CIGS, Si, and CdTe thin film solar cells. The main obstacle is the structural defects of the absorber. Since these structural defects mainly emerge from the preparation process and material selection, they are reduced by controlling the preparation process but cannot be completely eliminated. In the future, the device efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the preparation process of absorber materials and selecting appropriate materials for the ETL and HTL to reduce the recombination loss of carriers. Additionally, designing reasonable device structures can reduce non-radiative recombination and can improve device stability.
 Fig. 11  Challenges and prospects for the development of ATFSCs. 
(a) Absorber films with a controllable element ratio, low cost, non-toxicity, and non-pollution can be prepared by the solution method. During annealing, a grained double-layer structure is formed since the growth of the absorber is insufficient. As a result, excessive grain boundaries as recombination centers affect the carrier transport and separation, thus hindering the further improvement of battery performance. The high-dense absorber film with a less secondary phase and uniform large grains can be obtained by a two-step or multi-step annealing process.
(b) Crystallinity can be improved, and intrinsic defects can be decreased by cation doping in the absorber, such as Cd, Li, Na, and Zn. The introduction of cations changes the crystallinity and electrical properties of absorbers. Cation substitution also adjusts the band gap of absorbers, optimizes the conduction band offset or valence band offset at the interface of the device, and improves the separating and collecting efficiency of carriers.
(c) Another reason for the stagnant efficiency of ATFSCs is the severe interface recombination, wherein the transporting and collecting efficiencies of carriers are affected by the materials of the ETL and HTL. The electrical properties and energy band positions of the ETL and HTL affect the width of the depletion region and the strength of the back electric field severely. Suitable materials such as MoO3, NiOx, CdS, and ZnO can improve the interface quality of heterojunctions, reduce the potential barrier of the back interface, promote the transport and collection of carriers at the interface, and improve the efficiency of the device.
(d) Post annealing process for the device. The chemical environment of defects at the interface is the primary cause of the Voc and FF loss of the device. The post-annealing can improve the interface quality by facilitating the interdiffusion of elements at the interface. The ion migration at the interface and the improvement of the defective chemical environment reduce the interface recombination and improve the performance of the device.
(e) Understanding the dynamics of the carriers in ATFSCs is helpful in improving the efficiency and stability of devices. The micro information for generation, transmission, extraction, and recombination of the carriers in the device can be obtained by means of transient surface photovoltage, surface transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance, and transient photoelectric measurement systems. It is of great significance to further adjust the absorber quality and the structure of devices so as to improve their performance.
Finally, the silver-based thin-film solar cells are of high research interest for several current photovoltaic applications in addition to conventional semiconductor materials. Although the research development progress in those silver-based thin-film solar cells is relatively slow, earth-abundant and non-toxic elemental composition, low preparation cost, good stability, and a suitable band gap are important factors to achieve sustainable photovoltaics. While breakthroughs in the stability of perovskite solar cells are becoming more and more difficult, a breakthrough may be made by the ongoing efforts in AgBiS2 materials with a simple preparation method, tunable band gaps and fewer structural defects.
