Here, I2–II–IV–VI4 (Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4) (CMTSSe) thin films were successfully deposited by carrying out a simple, degradable solution-based process. The structure, composition, and morphology were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the Hall effect was also measured. These characterizations indicated that CMTSSe thin films may find applications in photovoltaic absorbing materials. In addition, different substrates were found to affect the morphology and compactness of the grains of the thin film.
Introduction
The mismatch between the limits on the traditional energy resource reserves and the increasing demand for energy resulting from economic and social development has been fueling the search for new and sustainable energy supplies. Solar energy is regarded an optimal choice to resolve this mismatch as it is considered to be a clean and sustainable energy source. One of the ways to employ solar energy is to directly generate electricity from it. In the process of transforming solar energy to electricity, many light-absorbing materials have been used as the core of thin-film solar cells, with such materials including binary, ternary and quaternary semiconductor absorbers such as SnS,1–3 Sb2(S,Se)3,4,5 Cu2Sn(S,Se)3,6,7 CuSb(S,Se)2,8–10 Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4,11–15 Cu2CdSn(S,Se)4,16,17 and Cu2CoSn(S,Se)4.18–20
Of these semiconductor materials, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 is composed of abundant elements, and its optical and electrical properties have been intensively researched and shown to be quite suitable for solar cells: this material yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 12.7% using a hydrazine-based solution process by Mitzi's group that involved improving the buffer layer.21 Other quaternary compounds Cu2(MII)Sn(S,Se)4 (MII = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) are attracting a lot of attention due to their properties being similar to CZTSSe materials. However, the research focus on these quaternary semiconducting materials, namely Cu2CoSnS4,19 Cu2NiSnS4,22 and Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS),22,23 has been on the synthesis by solvothermal approaches, except for Cu2CdSnS4 (ref. 24–27) which has been successfully applied in a solar cell absorbing layer.17 Nanocrystals of all of these materials display suitable band gaps in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV, have a high light-absorption coefficient, and are composed of elements abundant in the earth's crust; they therefore have a guaranteed high potential for application in low-cost thin-film solar cells. Therefore, the deposition of Cu2(MII)Sn(S,Se)4 (MII = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) thin films lays the foundation for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices that use these materials. In addition, the solution-phase deposition of inorganic semiconductors is a low-cost, promising, scalable method for the manufacture of thin-film photovoltaics, yet relatively less studied. Therefore, developing a non-vacuum process to deposit copper-based thin films would be of tremendous commercial value.
We previously described a degradable method involving the dissolution of metal oxides, hydroxides or acetylacetonate in an alcoholic solution of butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA), and we also proposed a mechanism for this dissolution.17,28,29 In the current work, we employed a similar process to dissolve Cu2O, MnO and SnO powders and successfully obtained stable degradable precursor solutions to deposit CMTS thin films.
Results and discussion
As is shown in the left of Fig. 1, MnO, Cu2O and SnO were chosen to be the metal sources and they all can be dissolved in butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA). Ethanol, which is benign for the environment, was employed as a green solvent to disperse and dilute the butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA) metal complex. Three kinds of clear solutions were attained. The concentration of each solution was about 0.5 mmol ml−1. Mixing each of these solutions yielded a uniform CMTS precursor stock solution.

(right) Images of a water droplet on various substrates: (a) Mo, (b) ITO/glass with ultraviolet and ozone (UVO) pretreatment, (c) soda-lime glass with UVO pretreatment, and (d) soda-lime glass without UVO pretreatment. 
To achieve a uniform film whose grains are close packed, the wetting quality of each precursor solution on the chosen substrate was analyzed. For this purpose, the contact angle was measured (shown in the right side of Fig. 1) by using the Young equation. The polarity of water is larger than that of ethanol. Here, a water drop was used to show the relative trend of the wetting. Commonly, Mo coated on soda-lime glass (SL glass) or ITO glass was chosen to be the back contact layer due to their relative inertness and suitable work function. And the Mo substrate was found to have a better quality of wetting (contact angle: 5.9°), while bare soda-lime glass yielded a contact angle of 15.5°/17.9° with/without the ultraviolet and ozone pretreatment. ITO glass showed relatively poor wetting, having a contact angle of 32.3°.
Not only the wetting, but also the annealing temperature affects the quality of thin films. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to determine the temperature needed to recover CMTS from their BDCA precursor (see Fig. 2). The CMTS precursor was found to decompose incompletely in the temperature range of 100–500 °C. The precursor decomposed quickly from 160 °C to 220 °C, and then displayed a slow decomposition process, which may have been due to some organic residuum or partial carbonization. This also explained that the thin film selenized was composed of a relative thin small-grained layer at the bottom of absorbing layer.

The constituents and purity of a phase directly affect the quality of the corresponding thin films. Fig. 3(a) shows the constituents for different pre-annealing temperatures. The higher heat-treatment temperature (400 °C) was observed to result in some loss of the element Sn, while other elements stayed relatively invariant. The loss of Sn may have been due to the relatively low melting point of SnS, allowing the Sn to easily run off. At 320 °C, the constituents of the as-prepared CMTS thin film were approximately consistent with the feed ratios. Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared CMTS resulting from different annealing temperatures to identify the phases and characterize the crystallinity. Annealing at 400 °C yielded better crystallinity and a narrower peak width at half height than did annealing at 320 °C. Both the thin film annealed at 400 °C and that at 320 °C displayed three weak and broad peaks, illustrating the formation of a preliminary CMTS nanocrystal. Fig. 3(c) shows the top-view image of the CMTSSe as-prepared thin film, which was clearly observed to be smooth and free of obvious leaks or cracks. In addition, scanning electron microscopy further verified the thin film sintered at 400 °C to have the better crystallinity.

In order to study the effect of substrates, CMTS thin films were spin-coated on a soda-lime glass (SLG) coated by an ∼1 μm thick Mo layer and bare soda-lime glass (SLG) in a nitrogen-filled glove box with the concentration of oxygen and water below 10 ppm. Repeating five cycles of spin-coating/sintering yielded ∼1.2 μm-thick CMTS nanocrystal thin films, followed by selenization at 520 °C. The morphologies of the grains were different. The thin films deposited on the bare soda-lime glass looked regular, jagged and zigzag, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The low roughness and zigzag morphology of the grains should be convenient for device fabrication and also reduce the reflection of light from the thin film. A zigzag morphology for the grains is desirable, and was also found in CZTSSe thin films made using a hydrazine solution.21

The thin film deposited on the Mo/glass substrate showed relative poor morphology (Fig. 4b), and some voids appeared. Na dopant has been reported to improve crystal growth. The thin film spin-coated on the bare soda-lime glass (SLG) has a better chance to acquire more Na. If we were to assume a morphology “transfer” from the glass substrate to the Mo substrate by addition of Na, there may be no need to deposit a reflecting layer during the fabrication of the thin film solar cell. The jagged and zigzag morphology of the CMTS thin film promoted a light-trapping effect. A high efficiency was expected to be attained if the morphology was transferred to Mo substrate, successfully.
To improve the CMTSSe thin film on the Mo substrate, one percent Na (relative to total metal) was added to the precursor solution, and the films were selenized at 480 °C, 520 °C or 540 °C for 40 min. Although the morphology of the CMTSSe thin film deposited on Mo substrate differed from the morphology coated on the bare glass substrate, the particles on the Mo substrate were more uniform in size, and also got bigger as the selenization temperature was increased, as shown in Fig. 5. All of the thin films were well filled, i.e., had no voids, regardless of the selenization temperature. Another phenomenon was noticed: the thin film got much smoother and rounded particles were densely packed. Continuing to increase the selenization temperature resulted in poor adhesion of the thin film to the substrate. So selenization at 540 °C for 40 min was considered as the optimal condition and chosen for subsequent experiments. The XRD patterns (Fig. 6(a)) of the CMTS(Se) nanocrystal matched well that of the standard tetragonal Cu2MnSnS4 except for shifts to lower two-theta values due to partial replacement of sulfur with selenium resulting from the selenization process. In addition, some minor peaks appeared after selenization, indicating that CMTSSe displayed good crystallinity. The selenized CMTSSe demonstrated a standard stannite structure owing to its thermodynamic stability. In addition, the compositional analysis was also recorded. The selenized CMTSSe absorbing layer clearly had less of the Mn element, which may be attributed to the low migration rate of Mn toward the interface compared with the migration rates of Cu and Sn.

Fig. 7 shows the reflection spectrum of the CMTSSe thin film. According to this spectrum, the thin film displayed high reflectivity at long wavelengths but low reflectivity at short wavelengths. In addition, the value of the optical band gap was calculated to be 1.03 eV by extrapolating the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R) = K/S = (1 − R)2/2R) to K/S = 0.30 Finally, a Hall effect measurement was taken, and revealed the selenized CMTSSe thin film to have p-type conductivity with a hole concentration of 2.9 × 1018 cm−3, which was close to the well-performing CZTSSe thin film (1017–1018), by and large illustrating that the CMTSSe thin film can be applied in solar cells.

Experimental
I. Materials
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, 99%), manganese(II) oxide (MnO, 99.9%), tin(II) oxide (SnO, 99.9%), carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%), 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2, 99%), thioglycolic acid (HSCH2COOH, 99%), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (NaS2N(CH3)2·3H2O ACS) and ethanol (AR) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals and solvents were used as received without any further purification.
II. Preparation of the precursor solutions
Cu2O (1.65 mmol), MnO (2.4 mmol), and SnO (2.0 mmol) were separately dissolved in three glass vials by adding 2.5 mL ethanol, 0.9 mL carbon disulfide (∼15 mmol), and 1.5 mL 1-butylamine (∼15 mmol). Note that the reaction of carbon disulfide and 1-butylamine is highly exothermic. Magnetic stirring was necessary while administering the carbon disulfide and 1-butylamine into a conical flask. In addition, 0.5 mL thioglycolic acid was employed to help dissolve SnO and enhance the stability of the Sn precursor. Continuous stirring made sure that the solution became homogenous and clear. To speed up the dissolution of SnO, a little bit of auxiliary heating was applied. Finally, three types of precursor solutions were mixed, achieving a clear and uniform solution. After subsequent centrifugation, the supernatant solution was transferred to a clean glass vial to deposit Cu2MnSnS4 nanocrystal thin films.
III. Deposition of CMTS and CMTSSe thin films
In order to investigate the effects of different substrates on the morphology of the CMTSSe grains, CMTS nanocrystal thin films were spun on Mo-coated soda-lime and common soda-lime glasses (20 × 20 × 0.5 mm) at 2500 rpm for 12 s with 130 μl per cycle, followed by heating at 320 °C on a ceramic hot plate for 1 min to burn off organic residuum and then formation of CMTS nanocrystal thin films in a glove box with the content of oxygen and water below 5 ppm. This process was repeated five times, and CMTS thin films with an average thickness of about 1.2 μm were acquired. Subsequently, two samples were treated in sealed glass tubes with approximately 30 mg Se pellets in a muffle furnace at various temperatures.
Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to test the decomposition of the CMTS precursor sample by using a TGA/DSC 1 STARe of Mettler-Toledo. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared CMTS nanocrystal and selenized CMTSSe thin film were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The top-view and cross-section images were acquired from a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800), and the chemical composition was determined by using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010) attached to a Hitachi S-4800. Wetting was analyzed by using a video-based, contact angle measuring system (OCA 20, Dataphysics Inc.). Hall measurements of the CMTSSe thin films were taken by using a Hall effects measurement system (ET9000, East Changing Technologies, Inc.).
Conclusions
A simple, low-cost, solution-based method to fabricate CMTSSe thin films was developed using a molecular precursor solution process. Different substrates were found to change the morphology of the grains, and large-grained densely packed thin films on a Mo substrate were produced by optimizing the selenization conditions. In addition, XRD patterns confirmed the CMTSSe thin film to have a standard stannite structure, and the determined optical band gap value of 1.03 eV lies in the range of suitable values for high-efficiency solar cells. The Hall measurements also showed the CMTSSe thin film to have an appropriate carrier concentration. In conclusion, we successfully fabricated a CMTSSe thin film that is potentially applicable in photovoltaic absorbing materials.
