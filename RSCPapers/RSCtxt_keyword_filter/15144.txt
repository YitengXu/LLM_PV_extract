    , Accepted 25th November 2018First published on 27th November 2018AbstractHalide perovskites have shown excellent photophysical properties for solar cell applications which led to a rapid increase in device efficiency. Understanding the charge carrier dynamics within an active perovskite absorber and at its interfaces will be the key to further progress in their development. Here we present a series of fully evaporated devices employing hole transport materials with different ionization energies. The open circuit voltage of the devices, along with their ideality factors, confirms that the former is mainly determined by the bulk and surface recombination in the perovskite, rather than by the energetic offset between the valence band of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the organic transport layers. These results help to further understand the origin of the open circuit potential in perovskite solar cells, which is an important parameter that needs to be improved to further boost power conversion efficiencies.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells are one of the most interesting alternatives to current photovoltaic technologies. Since the first reports of solid state solar cells based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI),1,2 the development of this technology has resulted in a rapid increase in device efficiencies, exceeding 22%.3 Identifying the unique properties of halide perovskites is essential to understand the reasons for this remarkable progress. In this regard, unveiling long charge carrier diffusion lengths,4–6 sharp optical absorption edges7 and weak exciton binding energies8–10 are some of the key discoveries that contributed to explain the excellent device performances, as well as to gauge the full material potential.
However, there is still some debate regarding the main factors affecting the open circuit potential (Voc) of the devices.11 In general, the splitting of the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels defines the maximum achievable Voc, and it is determined by charge generation/recombination rates along with the distribution of electronic states and charge carriers of the materials.12 In multilayer perovskite solar cells, the problem shifts towards the role of the charge selective and transporting layers in contributing to the final Voc. Several reports have associated the high achieved Voc with a high energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the hole transport material (HTM) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the electron transport material (ETM), together with good alignment of these energy levels with the perovskite valence and conduction bands, respectively.13–18 Although some reports show an increase in Voc for HTMs with a higher ionization energy (IE),17,19,20 this trend is not necessarily reflected in the record performance of perovskite solar cells, where the best Voc's have been reported for both high HOMO (closer to the vacuum level) HTMs with well-aligned energy levels; and low HOMO (further from the vacuum level) HTMs with non-perfectly aligned energy levels.21,22 More specifically, recent publications discuss the negligible Voc dependence on the ETM23 and HTM energy levels.24 This view is also in line with previous results, where Voc's higher than that expected from the HTM energy levels were obtained.17 However, in all these cases, the HOMO of the employed HTM was close in energy to or just above the perovskite valence band maximum (reciprocally, the LUMO level of the ETM was aligned or slightly below the perovskite conduction band).
Analyzing the effect of a set of HTMs with different HOMO energies appears to be a straightforward approach to systematically investigate the relationship between the Voc and the energy levels of the extraction layers. However, it is important to note that the replacement of the HTM can also affect the interfacial charge recombination,25 which has a large impact on the Voc. In addition, the vast majority of studies suffer from the limitations associated with solution-processed solar cells. This is in particular the case for p–i–n device architectures in which the holes are extracted through the front contact. In this configuration, the polar solutions containing the perovskite precursors are applied onto the apolar aromatic HTMs, leading to poor wetting and consequently poorly controlled film growth. Hence the resulting perovskite film is strongly affected by the surface of the HTM,26 leading to different morphologies and, most likely, different trap densities. Moreover, most studies have been carried out on n–i–p solar cells, where a large majority of charge carriers are generated at the ETM/perovskite interface, which could reduce the effect of the HTM and underestimate its impact on the Voc.17,24
Here, we present a series of fully vacuum deposited perovskite solar cells with different HTMs. Vacuum deposition allows for the direct modification or substitution of any layer in the device stack with a negligible effect on the rest, as no solvents are used and hence no wetting or de-wetting occurs. In addition, the high voltages previously obtained with vacuum-deposited MAPI solar cells, which indicates the absence of non-radiative recombination paths at the selective interfaces,21 make it an ideal reference system to study interfacial modifications. Therefore, we are able to produce and study high efficiency perovskite solar cells based on a series of HTMs with more than 0.66 eV difference in their IE, including materials with IE more than 0.3 eV higher and lower than the perovskite valence band.
Results and discussion
The different vacuum-deposited materials used as HTMs are 4,4′,4′′-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine (m-MTDATA), N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine (TaTm) and tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TcTa). Their respective ionization energies of 5.0 eV, 4.4 eV, and 5.7 eV (Fig. 1a) were measured using photo-electron spectroscopy in air (see the ESI,† Fig. S1). The solar cells were fabricated following a p–i–n architecture consisting of pre-patterned ITO on glass with ITO, MoO3, HTM, MAPI, fullerene (C60), 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and Ag as a top contact (Fig. 1b). Detailed experimental conditions can be found in the ESI.† Using a p–i–n device structure ensures that the majority of carriers are generated at the HTM/perovskite interface. Representative current–voltage characteristics measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in forward and reverse bias are displayed in Fig. 2a, whereas the corresponding photovoltaic parameters with the associated statistical error (>10 samples per parameter) can be found in Table 1. Slight current–voltage hysteresis is only visible in the TcTa based device, while it is negligible in the other cases. Devices based on TaTm show the highest current, 20.1 mA cm−2, in contrast to the ones with TcTa and m-MTDATA, which are 1.2 mA cm−2 lower. The FFs of the TaTm and m-MTDATA based devices are comparable (76% and 75% respectively), with a lower value (64%) obtained for the solar cells employing TcTa. More interestingly, devices with m-MTDATA and TcTa show almost no difference in Voc (1.008 V and 1.000 V) yet with an IE difference as large as 0.66 eV among them. Devices with TaTm present the highest Voc of 1060 mV. Since these results do not show any evident trend between the HTM energetics and the resulting Voc, further studies were carried out to elucidate the relationship among those parameters.

The dominant type of recombination was investigated by measuring the Voc as a function of light intensity.27Fig. 3 shows the light intensity dependent Voc and ideality factor for devices with different HTMs. The Voc depends logarithmically on the light intensity and introducing the ideality factor nID as a pre-factor we find:27 (1)with Eg being the bandgap, T the temperature, kB the Boltzmann constant and I0 the reverse saturation current. Measuring the Voc as a function of light intensity for devices with varying HTMs results in ideality factors of ∼1.7 for TaTm and ∼1.2 for TcTa and m-MTDATA. Ideality factors close to one can be attributed to direct recombination, which is usually interpreted as non-radiative surface recombination (if the associated Voc is low compared to the absorber's band gap), or to radiative bulk recombination (in the case of high Voc's). Ideality factors close to 2 are usually associated with non-radiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Therefore, against the common belief, low ideality factors are not necessarily beneficial. In fact, several perovskite solar cells with low ideality factors and low Voc have been reported.11,28,29
 Fig. 3  Light intensity dependent Voc and extracted ideality factors for perovskite solar cells with different HTMs. 
Considering this, devices using TaTm show a higher Voc and an ideality factor of 1.7, while the solar cells with TcTa and m-MTDATA have a lower Voc and an ideality factor of 1.2. This points towards an enhanced surface recombination which limits the Voc of the TcTa and m-MTDATA devices, while the Voc of TaTm is mainly determined by SRH-recombination. The origin of the larger surface recombination at the interface between MAPI and TcTa or m-MTDATA is not clear yet. The IE of the HTM itself is unlikely to influence the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels, in particular the position of the holes’ quasi-Fermi level (EFh), which is determined by the absorber. This is justified by the low exciton binding energy30 and the small dark charge carrier density31 of MAPI, and it is in line with previous observations where modifications of the HTM and ETM energetics did not affect the photovoltage.23,24 In addition, our results also suggest that it is possible using HTMs with a HOMO lower than the absorber's valence band without a significant voltage penalty associated with the energetics.
It is thus important to discuss the implications of these HTMs in the other relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices.
The three solar cells mainly differ in FF, with TaTm and m-MTDATA having high values of around 75 and TcTa having a lower FF of 64. This can be attributed to a higher series resistance of the diode employing TcTa, as also reflected in the dark IV-curve above 1 V, and it is likely related with the relatively large barrier for hole injection/extraction at the TcTa/MAPI interface (Fig. S2, ESI†). All devices reach relatively high short circuit currents, 20.1 mA cm−2 for TaTm and 18.9 mA cm−2 for TcTa and m-MTDATA. The EQE curves shown in Fig. 2b are very similar which is consistent with the results discussed before. This point highlights the good extraction of the photogenerated charges obtained with both TcTa and m-MTDATA despite their HOMO level mismatch with the perovskite valence band. To confirm this point, the charge injection from MAPI to the HTMs was studied using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). Fig. 4 shows the time-resolved transient absorption dynamics for perovskite/HTM double layers. The samples were excited with laser pulses at 600 nm with a constant excitation density of 1.4 × 1017 cm−3, and probed at the maximum of the perovskite ground state bleaching (GSB) band. An instantaneously reduced signal in the perovskite GSB band is observed upon the addition of the HTMs, indicating that the hole injection takes place for all HTMs, even faster than the time resolution of the setup of about 60 fs. The TA spectra at different time delays after excitation for the perovskite/TaTm bilayer are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). A detailed photophysical study of the systems will be published subsequently.

Conclusions
In summary, we produced a stack of fully evaporated devices based on different HTMs with an IP-difference as high as 0.66 eV among them. Devices produced with these HTMs showed Voc's ranging from 1000 mV (TcTa) to 1060 mV (TaTm). The measurement of the respective ideality factors allows us to explain the differences in Voc by the nature of the recombination processes. These results support that the Voc of perovskite solar cells is not necessarily limited by the energetics of the hole transporting material, but mainly by the different recombination paths. In addition, we show efficient charge extraction by HTMs with a misaligned HOMO with the perovskite (>300 meV above and below the perovskite's valence band). These results point towards HTM designing routes that can improve the performance of perovskite solar cells, focusing on the interfacial recombination reduction rather than on the energetic alignment.
