Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC's) have been extensively investigated since Grätzel and co-workers showed that by sensitizing large bandgap semiconductors, cheap and efficient solar cells can be obtained with energy power conversion efficiencies (ηsun) of up to 10%.1 In these solar cells, the process of light absorption and charge separation is performed by a sensitizer attached to a large bandgap semiconductor, which takes care of charge transport.2 The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the dye are crucial for the long term stability3 and the light harvesting efficiency of the solar cell. Coordination complexes of ruthenium and osmium have received wide-spread attention as photosensitizers,4–6 the most well-known being the N719 dye [Ru(NCS)2(dcbpy)2] (dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) (1) and the black dye [Ru(NCS)3(tctpy)] (tctpy = 4,4′,4″-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine). Although the highest efficiencies have been obtained with the black dye7 it could not replace N719 as commercial standard, because of its difficult synthesis, relatively low extinction coefficient and troublesome cell manufacturing. Organic compounds8–10 as well as porphyrins11 have also been used as photosensitizers, but do not reach the same conversion efficiencies as ruthenium complexes. Recently, quantum dots have been applied as the photosensitizer in a hybrid organic–inorganic solar cell.12 Thus far, cyclometalated compounds13 have not been explored as a sensitizer for solar cells. Replacing a hetero donor atom by a carbon atom in a multidentate ligand containing additional hetero donor atoms dramatically changes its electronic properties.14,15 Moreover, cyclometalation itself has a strong effect on the photophysical properties of the resulting complexes.16 Here we report the first use of cyclometalated ruthenium complexes as efficient sensitizers for TiO2 semiconductor electrodes. We compare the photocurrent action spectra for the cyclometalated dyes to those obtained for the non-cyclometalated analogues as well as to the standard 1. Also note that so far the overall solar cell performance has not been optimized.
Complexes 2–4 (Scheme 1) are synthetically easily accessible, can be handled and stored in air and have high extinction coefficients. The synthesis and full characterization of these complexes will be reported elsewhere. Complex 2 is a true ruthenium coordination complex with two tpy ligands (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine), one of which is functionalized with a carboxyl group for anchoring to TiO2. Replacing a nitrogen donor atom with a carbon atom in one of the outer pyridine moieties of the functionalized ligand, results in the cyclometalated congener, complex 3. Complex 4 contains an additional carboxylic acid moiety for more efficient grafting to the TiO2 surface.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structure of dyes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (TBA = tetrabutylammonium). 
The molecular geometry of 3 as obtained by single crystal X-ray structure determination is depicted in Fig. 1. The carboxyl substituted cyclometalated ligand is coordinated in a meridional fashion to the ruthenium, and is oriented perpendicular to the tpy ligand, resulting in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The nitrogen to ruthenium bonds lengths in the latter are typical for coordination of this ligand to ruthenium,17 2.057(3) Å and 2.068(3) Å for the nitrogens in the outer rings and 1.950(3) Å for the central ring. In the cyclometalated ligand, the carbon to ruthenium σ bond (2.062(3) Å) has a pronounced trans effect, elongating the opposite nitrogen to ruthenium bond to 2.158(3) Å, whereas the central nitrogen to ruthenium bond is 2.024(2) Å. In the solid state 3 forms hydrogen bonded dimers via very strong acid bridges, where two carboxyl groups share one proton. The remaining positive charge is compensated for by one PF6− ion.
 Fig. 1  Displacement ellipsoid plot (50% probability level) of one of two independent hydrogen bonded dimers of 3 in the crystal. The bridging O–H hydrogen atom is close to an inversion center and only half occupied. The second dimer is located on the second independent inversion center of space group P. C–H hydrogen atoms, solvent molecules and the PF6− counteranion have been removed for clarity. Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°): C11–Ru1 2.062(3), N11–Ru1 2.024(2), N12–Ru1 2.158(3), N13–Ru1 2.057(3), N14–Ru1 1.950(2), N15–Ru1 2.068(3), C11–Ru1–N12 156.20(11), N13–Ru1–N15 158.27(10), C11–Ru1–N11 79.74(11), N11–Ru1–N12 76.46(10), O11–O11i 2.467(3).

For the photovoltaic experiments, DSSC's were produced on so called master plate devices, according to previously published procedures.18 A master plate consisted of two SnO2:F coated glass plates (7.5 × 10 cm, LOF tec 8) one of which contained five electrically isolated anatase TiO2 photoelectrodes (4 cm2) deposited by screen printing.§ The other glass plate contained five platinum counter electrodes.
The active layers are dried and fired at 570 and 450 °C for TiO2 and Pt, respectively, to remove all organic components and to establish sufficient inter-particle contacts between the TiO2 particles. A typical film thickness of 13 µm TiO2 was obtained after firing. The two glass plates comprising the photo- and counter-electrodes were laminated together using Surlyn as a hotmelt foil. All the dyes were adsorbed by staining the electrodes in an 1 mM dye solution in methanol : acetonitrile (3 : 1, v/v). A device containing 1 stained from ethanol has been included in the comparison, because ethanol is the most optimal staining solvent for 1. The electrolyte contained 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone.
IPCE measurements have been carried out as follows. A 1000 W xenon lamp (Osram XBO/HS OFR) was used as the light source in combination with small band pass filters (Schott, FWHM = 6–10 nm) to generate monochromatic light. The monochromatic light was passed through a chopper wheel to create a small, modulated signal on top of a constant signal originating from 0.3 sun bias illumination. The resulting modulated current was analyzed by a lock-in amplifier.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of 2–4 in acetonitrile solution as well as the spectrum of 1 for reference. The spectrum of 2 is dominated by an intense and sharp metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition (λmax = 487 nm, ε = 18.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1) typical for substituted Ru(tpy)2 complexes.19 As can be seen, cyclometalation resulted in a clear broadening and red shift of the absorption features. Unlike 2, the spectrum of 3 (λmax = 523 nm, ε = 15.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 4 (λmax = 552 nm, ε = 15.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1) displayed a number of shoulders presumably resulting from the presence of a multiplicity of electronic transitions. Grafting of the dye onto TiO2 again resulted in both a slight broadening and a small red shift which was considered desirable as it increases the overlap with the solar spectrum and should lead to larger photocurrents.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis spectra of 1 (black), 2 (green), 3 (red) and 4 (blue) in acetonitrile solution. 

Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent action spectra for cells using the sensitizers 2–4 and 1 as reference. It must be noted that it was not the aim of this study to maximize the power conversion efficiency of these cells but rather to show the potential of these dyes as molecular sensitizer in DSSC's. For this reason, a more convenient electrolyte was used consisting of LiI (0.5 M) and I2 (0.05 M) in γ-butyrolactone, instead of a high efficiency electrolyte that increases voltage and fill factor at the expense of the photocurrent.
 Fig. 3  Photocurrent action spectra of 1 (black), 2 (green), 3 (red), 4 (blue) in a TiO2 solar cell using 0.5 M LiI and 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone as the electrolyte. 
It is clear from Fig. 3 that the photocurrent action spectrum of 2 in the TiO2 solar cell displays the same characteristics as the absorption spectrum of 2 in solution, peaking at an incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 35% around 500 nm with an onset around 650 nm. For the cyclometalated Ru-complexes 3 and 4, the photocurrent action spectra show a clear red shift compared to 2 in agreement with the respective absorption spectra. In addition, a substantial enhancement of the maximum IPCE is observed for the cyclometalated dyes 3 and 4, peaking at resp. 55% around 530 nm and 70% around 550 nm. The higher IPCE for 4 can be explained by a more intimate contact of this sensitizer with TiO2 due to presence of two anchoring moieties. Interestingly, it is also seen that the spectral features of the photocurrent action spectra of the solar cells sensitized by the cyclometalated dye 4 and the reference dye 1 are very similar, both show an IPCE onset around 800 nm. Moreover, the photocurrent for 4, derived by taking the spectral overlap of the action spectra and the AM1.5 spectrum, is somewhat higher than for the 1 sensitized reference system (12 vs. 11.5 mA cm−2), stained from the acetonitrile–MeOH solvent mixture but somewhat lower when 1 is stained from ethanol solution (13 mA cm−2).¶
In conclusion, [Ru(C^N^N)(N^N^N)] type cyclometalated ruthenium complexes have been used for the first time as a sensitizer in DSSC's. The sensitizing properties of the cyclometalated complexes 3 and 4 are superior to the coordination complex 2. It has been shown that a device sensitized by 4 is able to achieve short circuit currents comparable to that of the standard ruthenium dye 1 when a γ-butyrolactone based electrolyte is used. The improved anchoring capability of 4 allows the use of higher-performance electrolytes to optimize the efficiency, which is subject of further investigation. Finally, the broad and red-shifted absorption properties of the cyclometalated complexes renders these as a promising new class of compounds capable of sensitizing DSSC's.
