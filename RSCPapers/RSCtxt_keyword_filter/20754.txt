    , Accepted 1st September 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractDefects within the halide perovskite films limit the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, barium acetate (BaAc2) is employed as an additive in MAPbI3 for high performance PSCs. The BaAc2 can control the crystallization and thus produce high-quality perovskite films, which is attributed to interaction between the acetate ions and perovskite precursor. Both low defect density and the movement of energy levels contribute to a significant increase in open circuit voltage (Voc). Consequently, an efficiency up to 19.82% with a high Voc of 1.13 V is obtained based on the optimized BaAc2 concentration device. Moreover, the compact perovskite crystal with suppression of ion migration endows the BaAc2 doped PSCs with obviously enhanced thermal stability. The device with BaAc2 additive maintained over 90% of its original power conversion efficiency (PCE) after thermal aging at 90 °C for 400 hours.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have generated enormous attention in the photovoltaic field due to their merits of high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, tunable direct bandgap and simple fabrication process.1–5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rocketed from 3.8% in 2009 to a certified 25.2% in 2019.6,7 Despite the excellent performance that has been achieved in PCE, the stability is still the main issue that limits the commercialization of PSCs.8 PSCs suffer from serious degradation under thermal stress, moisture, oxidation, light illumination, etc.9,10 Massive research has been undertaken to improve the efficiency and stability of the PSCs, including device architecture optimization,11,12 solvent engineering,13 interfacial engineering,14 defect passivation,15 structural and materials engineering,16 low-dimensional perovskite based device development and so on.17 Of all factors, the perovskite films influence most importantly the device performance.
A great deal of approaches, such as vapor phase deposition,18 two-step sequential deposition,19 and importing additives into perovskite precursor20 have been reported in the past few years to improve the perovskite film quality. However, the solution-preparation perovskite films still suffer from poor crystallization.21,22 Numerous grains boundaries (GBs) and pinholes enriching massive defects seriously influence the performance of PSCs.3,4 In addition, the GBs serve as channels for moisture penetration and then lead to perovskite decomposition.23 It should also be recognized that the trap states at the GBs are significant sources for non-radiative recombination.24,25 Furthermore, ion migration is easy along the GBs, which has a negative impact on device performance and long-term stability.26,27 Therefore, passivation of GBs is an effective strategy for device performance and stability improvement.
Additive engineering has been demonstrated as a feasible method to obtain high-quality perovskite films and enhance the performance of PSCs.28 Polymers,29,30 inorganic acids,31 fullerene,32,33 organic halide salts,34,35 and ionic liquids36 have been reported to be added into perovskite for device performance enhancement. Based on Lewis-base theory, molecules containing carbonyl groups can interact with Pb2+ and MA+ ions and control the perovskite crystallization thus yielding uniform films with less GBs.25,37 For instance, our group reported that trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMTA) can in situ cross-link in perovskite films after thermal post-treatment. The operational stability of devices obviously improved for the carbonyl groups in TMTA chemically anchoring to GBs.38 In addition, carbonyl group-containing additives, such as polymers, small molecules, and quantum dots can also be used for GB passivation and the control of morphology.39–41 Metal acetate salts are usually used to form high quality perovskite films. Tang et al. employed lead acetate as an additive, which can act as a crosslinking agent to control the crystallization process. Moreover, the lead acetate additive finally generate PbI2 in the perovskite films and passivated defects at GBs.42 Europium acetate has been approved to effectively reduce defects in perovskite.43 It was reported that liquid zirconium acetate used as an additive in MAPbI3 PSCs can capture free iodide ions, leading to high-efficiency and high-stability devices.44 Alkaline-earth metal cation doped perovskites have been systematically studied. Chan et al. partially replaced the lead with alkaline-earth metals and they found that the barium ion doped PSCs exhibited significantly improved performance and storage stability.45
In this work, barium acetate (BaAc2) was introduced into the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution as an additive to fabricate devices with an inverted structure of ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Ag. The BaAc2 containing a carbonyl group can control the nucleation and growth of perovskite, thus leading to high crystallinity films with large grain size. The barium ions enter the crystal lattice of the perovskite, resulting in lattice expansion. Furthermore, the energy levels of MAPbI3 with BaAc2 shift toward vacuum level relative to the pristine MAPbI3. The BaAc2 finally can form BaI2 in the perovskite layers and effectively passivate the GBs. The pristine device exhibited a PCE of 18.99% with a Voc of 1.09 V. The BaAc2 added device achieved a PCE of 19.82% with a Voc of 1.13 V, which is remarkably improved compared with the pristine device. In addition, the BaAc2 added device retained over 90% of its initial PCE after thermal annealing for 400 h under 90 °C. However, the control device maintained less than 50% of its initial PCE under the same conditions. A very small amount of BaAc2 can effectively promote both the efficiency and stability of methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials
P3CT-N was synthesized in our lab according to a previous report.46 PbI2 (99.99%), MAI (99.99%) and Bathocuproine (BCP, 99.9%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%) was procured from Alfa Aesar. Barium acetate (BaAc2, 99.99%) was obtained from Aladdin (China). PC61BM (6,6-phenyl C61 butyric methyl ester) was purchased from American Dye Source.
Device fabrication
The ITO substrate (20 mm × 20 mm) was sequentially cleaned through ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min respectively. The cleaned substrates were dried under N2 flow and then treated in O2 plasma for 3 min. The P3CT-N solution (1 mg ml−1 in methanol) was deposited on ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 230.5 mg MAI and 668.4 mg PbI2 in 1 ml DMF:DMSO (4:1 vol ratio) solvent. For the BaAc2 containing solution, BaAc2 powders were added into the solution directly. The perovskite layers were prepared by a one-step spin coating method in a glove box filled with N2. The perovskite precursor solution was dropped on the ITO/P3CT-N substrate and spin coated at 4800 rpm for 20 s. 300 μl CB was dropped on the center of the substrate at 8 s after the start-up. The film then was annealed on a hot plate at 60 °C for 1 min and 80 °C for 5 min. After the substrate cooled down to room temperature, the PC61BM solution (10 mg ml−1 in CB) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 40 s to form an electron transporting layer. Finally, 20 nm C60, 8 nm BCP and 100 nm Ag were deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber using a metal shadow mask. The device area was 9 mm2.
Characterization and measurements
The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2440 sourcemeter with an Oriel So13A solar under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in a glove box filled with N2. The devices were measured by scanning from −0.2 V to 1.2 V for the forward scan (from 1.2 V to −0.2 V for reverse scan) with a dwell time of 50 ms. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured through a Newport quantum efficiency measurement system (ORIEL IQE 200TM) in ambient atmosphere. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with one standard Si/Ge solar cell. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded by field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, S-4800) with an accelerating voltage of 8 kV. Steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by a Fluorolog-Horiba fluorometer with excitation wavelength at 466 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was conducted with the excitation wavelength at 466 nm and emission wavelength at 770 nm. XRD patterns of the films were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD XPS/UPS system and was carried out using He I radiation at 21.2 eV from a discharge lamp operated at 20 mA, a pass energy of 5 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a GS54T spectrophotometer (Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co., China).
Results and discussion
We investigated the impact of BaAc2 additive on the surface morphology of MAPbI3 perovskite films. Fig. 1 presents the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films doped with different concentrations of BaAc2. The grains grow with the concentration of BaAc2 increasing from 0 to 2 mg ml−1. When the doping concentration further increases to 4 mg ml−1, more small grains appear and the film surface morphology becomes rough (Fig. 1d). This result indicates that a suitable amount of BaAc2 is beneficial to obtain large grains and uniform film surface, which is attributed to retarded crystallization of the perovskite. Similar to the case of adding lead acetate into perovskite precursor solution, the acetate ions can interact with methylamine ions and form a hydrogen bond. Perovskite crystallization includes supersaturation, nucleation and crystal growth. The interaction between BaAc2 and methylamine ions can slow down the nucleation rate and thus the perovskite crystals have more opportunities to grow into large grains. Large grain size means decreased number of GBs in perovskite films, which is in favor of device performance enhancement.

Fig. 2a illustrates X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MAPbI3 films with different concentrations of BaAc2 fabricated on P3CT-N/ITO substrates. When the amount of BaAc2 was between 0 and 8 mg ml−1, all samples show the pure perovskite phase without any impurity peaks. The major peaks of MAPbI3 located at 14.26°, 28.56° and 31.89° should be respectively assigned to (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of tetragonal perovskite.47 With the concentration of BaAc2 increasing from 0 to 4 mg ml−1, the relative intensity of the major diffraction peaks increased, indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite films. The enlarged (110) diffraction peaks of the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2b. It can be clearly observed that the peak position shifts to a smaller angle with increasing concentration of BaAc2. The shift of peak positions indicates that the Ba2+ ions can incorporate into the MAPbI3 crystalline lattice and thus lead to expansion of the crystalline lattice.48 It can be observed in Fig. 2b that the XRD pattern peak width of the MAPbI3 films becomes narrow by adding BaAc2. The narrower peak width indicates that the larger crystal sizes can be obtained by adding BaAc2 according to Scherrer's equation. The XRD patterns of the pristine MAPbI3 sample and with 20 mg ml−1 BaAc2 doping sample are shown in Fig. 2c. A PbI2 phase and a BaI2 phase can be observed while there is no BaAc2 phase in the XRD pattern of the excess BaAc2 doping sample, which implies that the BaAc2 additive finally generates BaI2. A little amount of Ba2+ enters into the crystalline lattice. The reaction product BaI2 most likely locates at the GBs and passivates the defects, which is in favor of device performance and stability improvement.

We carried out steady-state photoluminescence emission (PL) derived from the pristine and with BaAc2 doping MAPbI3 perovskite films fabricated on P3CT-N/ITO substrates (shown in Fig. 3a) to detect the recombination of the charge carriers in the perovskite absorber layers. The PL intensity of the BaAc2 added perovskite film is much stronger than that of the pristine film, indicating reduced trapped states in the BaAc2 added sample. In addition, a small blue-shift of PL emission peaks can be observed from 766 nm of the pristine MAPbI3 sample to 763 nm of the BaAc2 added sample. The enhancement of PL intensity and blue-shift of PL peaks should be ascribed to high quality perovskite films with low defect density by adding BaAc2.49 Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted on the perovskite films with and without BaAc2. The carrier lifetimes were extracted from TR-PL curves (Fig. 3b) and the values were listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The PL decay is fitted according to a bi-exponential decay model:50 F(t) = A1e(−t/τ1) + A2e(−t/τ2)(1)where A1 and A2 are the time independent coefficients of the amplitude fraction. Fast decay component τ1 and the long decay component τ2 are listed in Table S1 (ESI†), which respectively represent to the surface non-radiative recombination and the bi-molecular recombination in the bulk films. The fast and slow phase time of the BaAc2 containing sample are τ1 = 7.08 ns (fraction A1 = 40.9%) and τ2 = 36.81 ns (fraction A2 = 60.5%), while the pristine MAPbI3 sample shows lifetime τ1 = 6.09 ns (fraction A1 = 44.5%) and τ2 = 19.06 ns (fraction A2 = 57.9%). With the addition of BaAc2, the fraction of fast decay phase time decreases from 44.5% to 40.9%, suggesting the better electronic properties of the BaAc2 containing perovskite film. The average PL decay time (τavg) is calculated according to the following equation and shown in Table S1 (ESI†): τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(2)The average lifetime of the BaAc2 added sample is 33.40 ns and the reference sample is 16.50 ns. The prolonged carrier lifetime of the BaAc2 added sample is attributed to reduced trap-assisted recombination in perovskite films.44 To further investigate the passivation effect by introducing BaAc2, a space-charge limited current was measured based on pristine perovskite film and BaAc2 added film. Fig. 3c presents the J–V curves of hole-only devices (device structure is ITO/P3CT-N/perovskite/Au and shown in inset images in Fig. 3c) under the dark conditions. The trap-state density (Ndefects) in the perovskite films could be calculated by the equation.4 Ndefects = 2εε0VTFL/eL2(3)where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, e is the elementary charge, VTFL is the trap-filling limited voltage, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3 and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity. In low bias, the linear correlation reveals an Ohmic-type response. There is a kink point (VTFL) in the current density–voltage (J–V) curve with bias increasing, which indicates that the traps are completely filled. Lower VTFL indicates lower concentration of trap states. The VTFL are 0.28 V and 0.57 V, and the calculated defect densities are 1.14 × 1016 cm−3 and 5.6 × 1015 cm−3 for the pristine sample and BaAc2-incorporated sample respectively. The lower defect density in the BaAc2 incorporated sample could be attributed to the increased crystallinity of the perovskite films and passivation effect of BaI2.

Ion migration is an important factor which restricts the long-term stability of PSCs and has attracted wide attention in the past few years. Iodide ions were reported to be the most likely mobile ions in MAPbI3 due to the low activation energy. Defects in perovskite provide a medium for ion migration. Compared with the interior of the grains, GBs containing a lot of defects are shortcuts for ion movement. Therefore, massive defects at GBs can be passivated to alleviate ion migration. Here we characterized ion migration behavior in perovskite films by a device shown in the inset image of Fig. 4a.51 The bottom side Au thickness on ITO/glass is 7 nm and the top Au electrode area is 0.06 cm2. When under 1 sun illumination, the without electrical polling devices exhibited zero open circuit voltage (Fig. 4b). In contrast, after a constant bias of 0.9 V was applied on devices for 30 s, the with BaAc2 added device exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.17 V and the pristine device showed an open circuit voltage of 0.34 V upon illumination (Fig. 4a). The higher open circuit voltage suggested that the ions move more easily. It is clearly indicated that the suppression of ion migration by introducing BaAc2 into perovskite. The suppressed ion migration may be attributed to the two reasons below: on the one hand, large grains were obtained by adding BaAc2 and thus numbers of GBs significantly decrease. On the other hand, formed PbI2 and BaI2 at GBs could provide beneficial passivation effects.
 Fig. 4  (a) The I–V curves of devices under 1 sun illumination after poling with 0.9 V for 30 s. (Inset image: Device structure of electrical poling of perovskite film.) (b) The curves of devices before poling. 
The architecture of the device (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) is ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Ag. PCE statistics based on 15 separated devices of different BaAc2 doping concentration are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The PCEs first increase and then decrease with the concentration of BaAc2 increasing from 0 to 4 mg ml−1 and achieve the best values at a concentration of 2 mg ml−1, which is consistent with XRD patterns and the top-view SEM images of different doping concentration perovskite films. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of champion devices tested under standard AM 1.5G illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are presented in Fig. 5a and Table 1. The highest PCE for the pristine MAPbI3 device is 18.99% (Voc: 1.093 V, Jsc: 22.08 mA cm−2 and FF: 78.7%), which is similar to our group's previous report. The champion device doped with 2 mg ml−1 BaAc2 achieves a PCE of 19.82% (Voc: 1.13 V, Jsc: 22.42 mA cm−2 and FF: 78.3%). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices based on pristine MAPbI3 and with BaAc2 additive show the entire absorption wavelength range of 300–800 nm (Fig. 5b). The integrated current densities obtained from the EQE spectra are 21.00 mA cm−2 and 21.36 mA cm−2 for the pristine device and with BaAc2 additive device respectively, which are in accordance with the values measured from J–V curves. Fig. S4 (ESI†) presents the steady-state output of the devices under standard AM 1.5G illumination. We obtained a stabilized output of 17.50% and 18.20% for the pristine device and with BaAc2 added device. Furthermore, 30 individual PSCs based on pristine MAPbI3 and the optimum doping concentration BaAc2 devices were collected. The Box Charts of particular photovoltaic parameters statistical distribution are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The devices display good reproducibility which can be attributed to high quality perovskite films with reduced defect density. The significant increase in the open circuit voltage (Fig. S3b, ESI†) should be associated with the shift of energy level toward vacuum and the decreased trap states in perovskite films doped with BaAc2. We used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to investigate the electronic structures of the perovskite films.21 The data for the perovskite films with and without BaAc2 are shown in Fig. 5c. The optical band gap (Eg) of perovskite films was obtained from the Kubelka–Munk spectra according to the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra (Fig. 5d). From the UPS spectrum, we observed a change of the valence-band edge (Ev) between the pristine and BaAc2 incorporated films. The conduction band energy (Ec) values were estimated from Ev − Eg. The energy band level diagram of the corresponding materials used in PSCs are estimated in Fig. 5e. The energy level of BaAc2 contained perovskite shifts by about 0.03 eV toward vacuum relative to the pristine MAPbI3. This movement of energy level is in coincidence with the increase of Voc in devices. The recombination mechanism in the PSCs was elucidated by measuring Voc at various light intensities (Fig. 5f).52,53 The light intensity dependence of the Voc is fitted by the following equation: δVoc = n(kT/e)ln(I) + C(4)where C is a constant, n is the ideality factor related to recombination, e is elementary charge, k is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature and ρ is light intensity. It can be obtained from the fitted lines that n of the pristine device and with BaAc2 added device is 1.74 and 1.64, respectively. The decreased slope values revealed reduced trap-assisted recombination in perovskite with BaAc2, resulting in the improved performance of devices.

Thermal stability is an important issue for long-term stability PSCs. MAPbI3 suffers from decomposition under heat due to its intrinsic phase instability and ion migration. A thermally stable perovskite compound is essential to thermally stable solar cells. To evaluate the thermal stability of BaAc2 added PSCs, devices without encapsulation were exposed to continuous heating at 90 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The pristine device declined to less than 50% of the initial PCE after 100 hours. In contrast, the BaAc2 added device maintained 91% of its original PCE after 400 hours thermal aging (Fig. 6). The significantly enhanced thermal stability can be attributed to high crystalline quality perovskite films with large grains and suppressed ion migration in perovskite by adding BaAc2.

Conclusions
In summary, BaAc2 was added in an MAPbI3 active layer in inverted planar PSCs. BaAc2 could interact with methylamine ions and retard the crystallization of perovskite, and thus high quality perovskite films with large grains were obtained. The Ba2+ can enter the perovskite crystal lattice and result in lattice expansion. The generated PbI2 and BaI2 located at GBs could passivate defects and suppress ion migration. Both the shift of energy level toward vacuum and the decreased trap states in BaAc2-incorporated perovskite films contribute to an obvious increase in Voc. As a result, a champion PCE of 19.82% with a high Voc of 1.13 V was achieved in a BaAc2 added device. At the same time, the PSCs with BaAc2 retained over 90% of the initial efficiency after 400 hours continuous thermal aging, which shows remarkably improved thermal stability compared to the pristine devices.
