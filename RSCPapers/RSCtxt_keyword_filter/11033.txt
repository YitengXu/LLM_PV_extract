    , Accepted 6th September 2017First published on 6th September 2017AbstractThe optical and electrochemical properties are compared for aza-BODIPY dyes that differ by virtue of the substituents at 1,7- and 3,5-positions of the aza-BODIPY backbone. In particular, the impact of highly electron-withdrawing nitro substituents on these properties is of consideration. The aza-BODIPYs studied exhibit a broad absorption band spanning from ca. 600 nm to ca. 700 nm – a spectral region that is highly sought after for biomedical applications – and possess high molar absorption coefficients (ε) ranging from 64000 [M−1 cm−1] to 85000 [M−1 cm−1] in THF. The compounds studied are weakly emissive as non-radiative decay is the predominant way of the excited state energy dissipation. Exemplarily, the fluorescence quantum yields (Φfl) measured in THF were in the range of 0.03 to 0.06 for the aza-BODIPYs studied. Transient absorption experiments revealed T1 → Tn absorption spanning from ca. 400 nm to ca. 600 nm and allowed determination of the triplet state lifetimes. The estimated triplet lifetimes (τT) in deaerated THF ranged from 77 µs to 130 µs. As estimated by the CV/DPV measurements, all aza-BODIPYs studied exhibited one irreversible oxidation and two quasi-reversible reductions. Estimation of the EHOMO gave a value of ca. −5.8 eV while the ELUMO was found to be located at ca. −4.5 eV. Extremely high photostability and thermal robustness up to approximately 300 °C were found for the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs.
1. Introduction
Dyes belonging to the family of BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) and aza-BODIPY (aza-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) have gained widespread attention in recent decades due to their tunable optical and electrochemical properties, such as triplet state characteristics, luminescence properties and HOMO/LUMO energies.1–4 Structurally, aza-BODIPY dyes are derivatives of BODIPY dyes obtained by replacing the meso-carbon atom that connects both pyrrole rings with an aza-bridge. The consequence of the introduction of an aza-bridge into the structure of the chromophore system is the bathochromic shift of both absorption and emission bands of around 80 nm. The first report on aza-dipyrromethenes and their difluoroboron complexes appeared in 1943, followed by a lack of interest in this class of dyes for several decades.5–7 The re-emergence of interest in aza-BODIPY dyes has been observed since the turn of the century as new and improved synthetic protocols and post-synthesis modifications have been developed.4,8–18 Owing to their advantageous photophysical properties and tuneable singlet oxygen quantum yields, aza-BODIPY dyes mostly have been considered as potential photosensitizers for both anti-microbial and anti-cancer photodynamic therapy.19–26 Moreover, aza-BODIPYs continue to attract attention as fluorescence chemosensors for the detection of Hg2+ and F−, in vivo detection of H2S, homocysteine, and ammonia, and detection of saxitoxin.27–34 Aza-BODIPYs have also been tested as photoactive components in photovoltaic devices.35–42 The highest power conversion efficiency (η) achieved for this class of organic chromophores equals 2.63% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of ca. 0.8 V and with photocurrent generation in the near-infrared region beyond 1.5 eV for the B,O-chelated aza-BODIPY/C60 device.38 Several authors reported utilization of aza-BODIPY as components of π-conjugated polymers for electron transport materials with high electron mobility and low threshold voltage.43–45
We report herein the synthesis of a series of aza-BODIPYs substituted at 1,7 or 3,5 positions with electron-withdrawing p-nitrophenyl rings (Fig. 1). In addition, two out of four aza-BODIPYs tested in this study are substituted with tert-butyl groups. These groups are expected to improve the solubility of aza-BODIPYs and facilitate their purification and spectroscopic analysis. The choice of nitro groups at the phenyl rings was dictated by the possibility of further structural modifications this functionality offers. For example, nitro groups, after reduction to amino groups, could be further modified through the amide bond. Furthermore, aromatic nitro substituents can be easily replaced by many nucleophiles like thiolates, phenolates or alkoxides. Moreover, exchange of the nitro groups to azide substituents, through the nucleophilic aromatic substitution, offers the possibility for structural modifications via click chemistry. Such modifications open up the avenue for the formation of bioconjugates.

We also give an insight into the optical, photophysical, photochemical and electrochemical properties of these novel aza-BODIPY derivatives. Very little is known about triplet state properties of aza-BODIPY dyes.46 Understanding the relationship between the aza-BODIPY structure and the triplet state properties, such as energies and lifetimes, is essential for developing next generation photosensitizers for biomedical applications as well as artificial light-harvesting systems. Furthermore, via the CV and DPV measurements, we explore the redox properties and we establish HOMO/LUMO energy levels of these novel aza-BODIPY derivatives. Moreover, the photostability in solution and thermal stability of these materials were considered. The DFT calculations were performed to gain an understanding of the structural effects on the electronic properties of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs studied. A thorough understanding of how the structure of a molecule and the nature of the substituents influence its characteristics is a key factor for the successful design of new materials with tailored properties.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8 is presented in Scheme 1 and the structures of the investigated compounds along with the numbering are depicted in Fig. 1. The four nitro-substituted aza-dipyrromethene ligands 1–4 were synthesized using our prior literature procedure (Scheme 1).47 Reaction of aza-dipyrromethene ligands 1–4 with the ethereal complex of boron trifluoride in 1,2-dichlorobenzene in the presence of diisopropylamine, followed by chromatographic purification, afforded the corresponding aza-BODIPYs 5–8 with excellent yields ranging from 65% to 99%. Complexes 5–8 were characterized by 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 19F NMR, high resolution ESI-MS as well as FT-ATR-IR and elemental analysis (see the Experimental section, the ESI† and Fig. 2). The incorporation of boron into the ligands was confirmed by 11B NMR spectroscopy. The 11B resonance signals were found at δ = 0.67 ppm for 5, δ = 0.79 ppm for 6, δ = 0.69 ppm for 7 and δ = 0.90 ppm for 8. In each case, the 11B resonance signal was seen as a triplet (1J = 30.2–31.4 Hz) pointing to the 11B–19F interactions. The 19F resonance signals were, in all cases, seen as quartet due to the 11B–19F interactions. In the 1H NMR spectra, the diagnostic resonance of the pyrrole ring protons appears as a singlet between δ = 7.05 ppm and 7.68 ppm. FT-ATR-IR spectra confirmed the proposed structural features of the new aza-BODIPYs. In all cases, a high intensity band at ca. 1520 cm−1, associated with the NO asymmetric stretching vibrations (νas) of the NO2 group, was identified in the IR spectra, while for compounds 7 and 8 additional strong symmetric and asymmetric ν(C–H) vibrations, that is 2963 cm−1 and 2929–2906 cm−1, characteristic of the t-butyl groups appeared in the IR spectra. Furthermore, the identity of the aza-BODIPYs presented in this work was supported by high resolution ESI mass spectrometry. The peaks corresponding to the molecular ion adduct with methanol, i.e. [M+ + MeOH]+, used as a solvent, appeared at m/z 618.17611 for 5, m/z 618.17606 for 6, m/z 730.30136 for 7 and m/z 730.30134 for 8.

2.2. Optical properties
The electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8 were recorded in different solvents of different polarities, namely, acetonitrile (dielectric constant at 20 °C, εr, 37.50), THF (εr 7.60) and toluene (εr 2.38). The corresponding absorption maxima λabs, molar absorption coefficients ε, fluorescence λfl, the fluorescence quantum yields Φfl, and the fluorescence lifetimes τfl of the aza-BODIPYs studied are collected in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 3.

 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption (left panel) and fluorescence (right panel) spectra. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded in THF at room temperature (inset: THF solutions of aza-BODIPYs studied). 
The solutions of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs exhibit either deep navy blue (5 and 7) or green color (6 and 8). The electronic absorption spectra show a broad absorption band spanning from ca. 600 nm to 700 nm, corresponding to the S0 → S1 transition. The maxima of absorption bands were observed at λabs 658 nm for 5, λabs 672 nm for 6, λabs 665 nm for 7 and λabs 693 nm for 8 in THF. Out of the four aza-BODIPYs tested compound 8 exhibits the most red-shifted absorption indicating that the electron-donating nature of the tert-butyl groups is most pronounced when these groups are present at the 3,5-positions of the pyrrole rings. Similarly, the electron-withdrawing character of the p-nitrophenyl groups is most pronounced when these groups are present at the 3,5-positions of the pyrrole rings (see compound 5). The following molar absorption coefficients were determined: 76000 [M−1 cm−1] for 5, 85000 [M−1 cm−1] for 6, 64000 [M−1 cm−1] for 7 and 74000 [M−1 cm−1] for 8 in THF. The Stokes shifts in the spectra in THF solutions were equal (ca. 30 nm). All compounds studied revealed a weak negative solvatochromic behavior. Both absorption and fluorescence spectra were affected by the solvent polarity. Exemplarily, for compound 8, the main absorption and fluorescence bands with maxima at λabs 695 and λfl 723 nm in toluene shifted to λabs 681 and λfl 715 nm in very polar acetonitrile.
The aza-BODIPYs studied display a weak emission in solution, with fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 0.06 (5 and 6) to 0.03 (7 and 8) in THF. The highest fluorescence quantum yield was observed for compound 5 in toluene: Φfl 0.12. The fluorescence lifetimes (τfl) of aza-BODIPYs 5, 6, 7 and 8 were studied in three solvents of different polarities (Table 1).

Fig. 4 presents the emission decay curves of compound 8 in acetonitrile, THF and toluene upon excitation at λex 605 nm. The decay times were well fitted with the mono-exponential function. In general, longer fluorescence lifetimes were observed for the least polar toluene, while the very polar acetonitrile had the effect of markedly shortening the fluorescence lifetimes. The following fluorescence lifetimes were measured in acetonitrile: 0.6 ns for 5, 1.7 ns for 6, 0.6 ns for 7 and 2.4 ns for 8. Upon changing the solvent to toluene the fluorescence lifetimes for the compounds studied were considerably longer: 1.5 ns for 5, 3.0 ns for 6, 1.2 ns for 7 and 3.4 ns for 8.
 Fig. 4  Fluorescence decay profiles of compound 8 recorded in deoxygenated acetonitrile (red line), THF (green line) and toluene (blue line) overlapped with the instrument response function, IRF (black line). λex: 605 nm. 
A comparison of radiative rate constants (kr = Φfl/τfl) and non-radiative rate constants (knr = (1 − ΦFL)/τfl) clearly indicates that nonradiative decay is the predominant way of the excited state energy dissipation (Table 1). The rate constants of non-radiative deactivation (knr) were found to be in the range of 7.8 × 108 s−1 to 2.8 × 108 s−1 in non-polar toluene while in polar acetonitrile they were found to lie between 15.7 × 108 s−1 and 4.0 × 108 s−1.
2.3. Excited triplet state decay dynamics
Time-resolved spectroscopic studies of aza-BODIPY dyes have rarely been reported.46,48 We have investigated the excited triplet state decay dynamics by nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra. The transient absorption spectra, transient decays and triplet state lifetimes are presented in Fig. 5 and Table 2.

Transient decays with fits are shown in the insets (for 4 and 5 the decay was measured at 540 nm and for 6 the decay was measured at 450 nm).

Given the spin-forbidden nature of the transition from the T1 state to the S0 ground state, very low quantum yields of phosphorescence (ΦP) frequently encountered for organic compounds and significant contribution of the non-radiative deactivation pathway (knr) observed for 5–8, recording of the transient spectra for aza-BODIPYs 5–8 presented us with great difficulties.
In general, there are two ways to populate the triplet state of a given molecule via photolysis.49,50 In the first method the compound under study is irradiated with photons of energy matching its ground state absorption band (λmax), going initially to a singlet excited state (S1) followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) to reach the triplet excited state (T1). Disappointingly, we could not record the triplet–triplet absorption spectra, and consequently measure the triplet lifetime (τT), by this method. Moreover, an attempt to induce the external heavy atom effect by employing a mixture of THF and iodomethane (CH3I) as the solvent also failed. Thus, we resorted to the second method known as photosensitization and we employed tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride, i.e. [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2, as the photosensitizer. [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 is characterized by intense ground state absorption (in a region of the UV-Vis spectrum where the studied compounds do not absorb), and possesses near unity quantum yield of triplet state formation (ΦT) and sufficient energy of the triplet state (ET). In short, in this method [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 intercepts the light energy, reaches the excited triplet state (T1) and transfers the excess energy to aza-BODIPY during collisions: 3[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2* + 1aza-BODIPY → 1[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 + 3aza-BODIPY*. The transient absorption spectra of aza-BODIPYs 5–8 recorded in THF feature a broad T1 → Tn absorption band spanning from ca. 400 nm to ca. 600 nm, superimposed with the ground state bleaching signals. The decay of the transient T1 → Tn absorption and the recovery of the absorption S0 → S1 in the singlet state were used to calculate triplet lifetimes (τT) of the investigated aza-BODIPYs 5–8, with both methods giving similar values of τT. Furthermore, for aza-BODIPYs 5–8, mono-exponential decays of the transient absorption and recovery of the ground state absorption were observed. Compound 5 was found to have a triplet lifetime of 77.7 µs, for compound 6τT equaled 94.2 µs, for compound 7τT equaled 74.4 µs, while compound 8 had the longest triplet lifetime of 130.5 µs.
As might be expected in light of the high nonradiative rate constants (knr) calculated for the aza-BODIPY studied the singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) measured were low, that is, in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 (Table 2).
2.4. Electrochemistry and HOMO/LUMO energy levels
The electrochemical properties of aza-BODIPY 5, 6, 7 and 8 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Measurements were taken in THF as the solvent with nBu4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte. Both CV and DPV data were obtained on a glassy carbon working electrode (Fig. 6). The solutions were scanned between 1.2 V and −1.7 V potentials vs. Fc/Fc+. The redox potential data were then referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (added post the measurement) and are summarized in Table 3. All aza-BODIPYs studied exhibited one oxidation and two reductions within the potential range applied. The oxidations observed were irreversible while both reductions were quasi-reversible in nature. Interestingly, the aza-BODIPYs substituted with p-nitrophenyl groups at 1,7 positions (6 and 8, see Fig. 6) were easier to oxidize, while the regioisomers with p-nitrophenyl groups at 3,5 positions (5 and 7, see Fig. 6) required more positive potentials for the oxidation to occur (positive shift of E1ox of around 100 mV was observed). This implies that the electron withdrawing effect of the substituent is more pronounced when such substituent is attached to carbon 3 and 5 of the pyrrole rings of the aza-BODIPY.

Data were collected on a glassy carbon electrode in THF with 0.1 M nBu4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 V s−1. Redox potentials are in reference to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple.

We observed that due to the electron-deficient nature of the BF2 moiety, the boron containing complexes (aza-BODIPYs 5–8) were easier to reduce and slightly harder to oxidize than the respective aza-dipyrromethene ligands (1–4). The aza-dipyrromethene ligands required 350 mV to 450 mV more negative potential for the first reduction to occur compared to their corresponding BF2 complexes.47
As the DPV gave well resolved oxidation and reduction waves we used them to calculate the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO, assuming that the value of the formal potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple equals −5.1 eV in the Fermi scale.51,52 The following equations were used: ELUMO = −(E[firstreductionvs.Fc/Fc+] + 5.1) [eV] and EHOMO = −(E[firstoxidationvs.Fc/Fc+] + 5.1) [eV]. Estimation of the EHOMO gave the value of −5.77 eV for 5, −5.82 eV for 6, −5.76 eV for 7 and −5.81 eV for 8. The ELUMO was found to be located at −4.52 eV for 5, 6 and 8 and −4.48 eV for 7.
Optical band gaps (Eg(opt)) were calculated using the absorption onset of the red-most part of the absorption band. Eg(opt) ranged between 1.78 and 1.70 eV for all aza-BODIPYs studied. The electrochemical energy gaps Eg(electro), calculated as the difference between the oxidation and reduction onsets of the CV data, were similar and ranged between 1.25 and 1.30 eV for all compounds studied.
2.5. Photostability and thermal stability
The THF solutions of aza-BODIPY 5, 6, 7 and 8 were exposed to intense light of a xenon lamp (843.0 ± 0.1 W m−2) in an effort to assess the photostability of these compounds (Fig. 7). UV-Vis spectra were collected successively after 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 10 h. The exposure of aza-BODIPYs studied to light at λ > 473 nm resulted in a gradual, slow depletion of the absorption band without evolution of any new absorption bands. This observation implies that the photodegradation of aza-BODIPY 5, 6, 7 and 8 proceeds via photobleaching and that no phototransformation occurs. After 10 h of irradiation 97% of the initial intensity of the absorption band was preserved for compound 5, 96% for compound 6, 92% for compound 7 and 97% for compound 8. These findings point to very good photostability of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8. The thermogravimetric profiles of aza-BODIPYs 5–8 under aerobic conditions indicate very good thermal stability of the compounds tested up to ca. 300 °C. The initial loss of weight observed for aza-BODIPYs 5 and 6 is associated with the loss of the solvents used for crystallization and entrapped within the crystals formed.

2.6. DFT/TDDFT analysis
In order to characterize the properties of the ground and the low excited electronic states of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8, we performed DFT calculations, followed by a TDDFT computation of the lowest electronic transitions. We confined ourselves to the simplest, vertical approach, for the sake of the required computational effort. We followed the computational protocol which was found to perform best for aza-BODIPY dyes.53
The molecular geometries at the ground state were optimized at the PBE0/6-311G(2d,p) (PCM = THF) level of theory, without imposing any symmetry on the initial structures. Convergence to local minima was confirmed by lack of imaginary vibrational frequencies, which were calculated at the same level of theory.
The optimized ground state geometries of 5–8, as well as that of the parent molecule (tetraphenyl-substituted aza-BODIPY, abbrev. Ref), are characterized by a nearly planar arrangement of the aza-BODIPY core. The out-of-plane deviation of the side pyrrole rings with respect to the central unit equals merely 1.5° and is accompanied by a pronounced tilt of all the phenyl rings, which adapt nearly parallel arrangement (Fig. 8 and Table 4). The tilt of the distal rings is within 1 degree the same as in the aza-dipyrromethene analogs 1–4 we analyzed previously, while the tilt of the proximal rings turns out to be nearly twofold larger.47

To explore the conformational space associated with the tilts of the proximal rings, a rigid potential energy surface (PES) scan for the φ1 and φ2 torsion angles was performed for the Ref molecule in vacuo. The computed fragment of PES is presented in the ESI† (Fig. S22). Precise location of both the minimum and the highest transition state was achieved by a minute scan of the neighborhood of these points. The GS and TS correspond to the tilts of the proximal rings equaling 35° and 93°, respectively. The difference of the total energies corresponding to both geometries, partially optimized at the required φ1 and φ2 values, indicates a low rotational barrier of ΔErot = 9.74 kJ mol−1.
Contour plots of the frontier orbitals of the studied compounds 5–8 and the reference molecule, Ref, are presented in Fig. 9. Energies of these orbitals along with the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps are summarized in Table 5.

To evaluate the contribution of the aza-BODIPY core and the proximal and distal substituents to the electron density associated with the frontier orbitals, the percent contribution of the aforementioned subunits to the HOMO and the LUMO was calculated (ESI,† Table S2). The HOMO electronic density in all of the studied compounds is concentrated at the aza-BODIPY core, as in the aza-dipyrromethene analogs 1–4.47 The percent contribution of the central moiety is practically the same in both groups of compounds (between 62% and 66%). Noticeably, the BF2 moiety practically does not contribute to either the HOMO or the LUMO, so introduction of the BF2 bridge does not change the HOMO and LUMO spatial distribution within this subunit. However, it affects even the electronic distribution around both proximal and distal phenyl substituents, resulting in equal contribution of both rings of the same type to these MO. In the parent Ref molecule, the contribution of the proximal rings to the HOMO electronic density is nearly twofold larger than that of the distal rings (11% and 6%, respectively). Introduction of the NO2 groups to the proximal or the distal phenyls results in a slight shift (by 2–3%) of the HOMO electronic density from the NO2 substituted to the non-substituted rings. Additional substitution of the remaining rings with t-butyl groups causes a slight shift of the HOMO electronic density from the aza-BODIPY core towards the rings substituted with t-butyl groups.
The influence of the substitution pattern on the energies of the frontier orbitals and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (ΔE) has been summarized in Table 5. A general tendency may be observed when comparing these data with the values obtained for aza-dipyrromethene analogs 1–4. The energy level of HOMO is lowered in aza-BODIPY 5–8 by ca. 0.25 eV as compared to the ADPM 1–4 analogs, whereas the LUMO energy level falls by ca. 0.3–0.4 eV. As a result of this, the calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gap in aza-BODIPY 5–8 is by 0.06 to 0.14 eV narrower than that of the ADPM 1–4 analogs.47 Qualitatively, this finding is in line with the experimental results obtained from the electrochemical measurements; however the calculated gap narrowing is severely underestimated, as the experimental values are in the range of 0.43–0.62 eV.
The substitution of either the distal or the proximal phenyl rings with NO2 groups lowers both the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels as compared with the Ref molecule. However, since the lowering of the LUMO level is greater than the lowering of the HOMO, the NO2 substitution results in a slight narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap.
The electronic vertical transitions were computed for the optimized geometries with TDDFT employing the BMK functional with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set, as recommended for aza-BODIPY dyes.53 We also calculated the transitions using the PBE0 functional with the same basis set, which performed better in predicting the location of the main transition for aza-dipyrromethenes 1–4.47 The calculated absorption wavelengths (λmax) and the oscillator strengths (f) for the strongest transitions are given in Table 5, along with the experimental values of λmax. A comparison of the experimental UV-Vis spectra and the calculated electronic transitions as well as the detailed characteristics of the strongest transitions are presented in ESI† (Fig. S23 and Table S3). Similarly to the aza-dipyrromethene analogs 1–4, the strongest absorption band arises from the HOMO → LUMO transition. In 5 and 6 this transition results in a shift of the electronic density from the NO2 substituted pair of the rings to the non-substituted phenyls, with a negligible change within the aza-BODIPY core. In contrast, in 7 and 8 a profound redistribution of the electronic densities, directed from the NO2 substituted phenyl rings toward both the t-Bu substituted rings and the aza-BODIPY core, is predicted. As in the case of aza-dipyrromethene based compounds, the PBE0 functional outperforms BMK in reproducing the wavelength of the main transition, giving an average deviation from the experimental value of 33 nm versus 60 nm for BMK. Noticeably, both functionals produced the largest error for the non-substituted, Ref molecule. As a consequence, the calculated red-shifts of this band for the substituted derivatives with respect to Ref are systematically overestimated.
Although PBE0 gives smaller absolute deviations from the experimental λmax, it fails to reproduce the observed red-shift of λmax when moving from aza-dipyrromethene based compounds to aza-BODIPYs; in particular, it predicts a negligible change of λmax between 5 and 7 and their analogs, whereas the experimental Δλmax in both cases is ca. 30 nm. BMK turned out to output the proper qualitative tendency in Δλmax along with a smaller absolute deviation in this red-shift.
3. Discussion
One of the most attractive features of the aza-BODIPYs presented in this work is their broad absorption band spanning from ca. 600 nm to 700 nm – a spectral region that is highly sought after for biomedical applications and in particular for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Studies have shown that the tissue-penetration depth of light strongly depends on the wavelength of light and it increases with the increase of the wavelength of light. Exemplarily, the ability of light to penetrate the tissue doubles from 550 nm to 650 nm and it doubles further as the absorption of light moves to 700 nm. The compounds we introduced in this work meet the criterion of so called “therapeutic window”, defined as 600 nm to 1100 nm. Moreover, possibly high absorption coefficients at λmax are expected from a good photosensitizer. The aza-BODIPYs 5–8 presented in this manuscript proved to be efficient visible light absorbers with molar absorption coefficients ranging from 64000 [M−1 cm−1] to 85000 [M−1 cm−1]. Another prerequisite for a PDT photosensitizer is a long-living triplet state (τT) facilitating the transfer of the triplet state energy (ET) to the ground state oxygen. It is generally agreed that the triplet lifetimes of a useful photosensitizer should be longer than 1 µs and the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8 had their triplet lifetimes ranging between 77 µs and 130 µs, meaning that they fulfill this requirement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that aza-BODIPYs 5–8 were able to transfer their excited triplet (ET) to the ground state oxygen and subsequently form the very reactive, cytotoxic, singlet oxygen. Unfortunately, the singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ) measured for aza-BODIPYs 5–8 were too low (that is in the range of 1% to 2%) for them to serve as efficient photosensitizers for PDT applications. Two issues have to be addressed to make the aza-BODIPYs presented in this work attractive photosensitizers useful for PDT, viz. poor intersystem crossing efficiency and lack of water solubility. A well-known method to improve the intersystem crossing efficiency and as a result of it to increase the singlet oxygen quantum yield is to modify the aza-BODIPYs with heavy atoms such as iodine or bromine. The issue of water solubility can be addressed by modifying the structures with charged groups such as quaternized amine groups. Currently, we are working on the structural modifications of aza-BODIPYs 5–8 aimed at increasing their potency as photosensitizers for biomedical applications.
Moreover, both the photostability studies and the thermogravimetric analysis pointed to very high stability of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs. Applications such as photocatalysis, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and other light-harvesting systems require highly stable dyes capable of resisting photobleaching upon exposure to a high intensity light source.

4.1. Materials and methods

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance II (300 and 600 MHz), 11B-NMR on Bruker Avance II (96 MHz) and 19F-NMR on Bruker Avance II (282 MHz) in deuterated solvents. An electrospray mass spectrometer (micrOTOF II, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen/Germany) with a resolution of >16500 FWHM and a mass accuracy of <2 ppm was used to obtain the high resolution mass spectra. FT-ATR-IR spectra were recorded using Bruker Equinox 55 and Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 spectrometers. UV-Vis absorption spectra at 298 K were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode-array spectrophotometer equipped with a HP 89090A Peltier temperature control accessory. Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded on an SLM-AMINCO 8100 Instruments spectrofluorimeter at room temperature. Emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependency of the detector response by using an internal correction function provided by the manufacturer. For the elemental microanalysis the CHNS Vario Micro Cube analyzer combined with the electronic microbalance was used. Compounds were analysed using a Thermo-gravimetric analyzer Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e and the analysis was carried out using samples of approximately 3–5 mg in weight and at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under air. The reaction progress was controlled using TLC on silica gel (Supelco). 1,2-Dichlorobenzene and Et3N were dried with CaH2 and freshly distilled prior to use.

4.3. Measurements

Transient absorption spectra and triplet-state lifetimes. 
Transient triplet–triplet absorption spectra and triplet state lifetimes were measured using a home-built laser flash photolysis setup. The pump pulses (λexc = 460 nm, t1/2 =25 ns, W ≈ 5 mJ) were provided by a home-built dye laser, pumped by an excimer laser (Labda Physik LPX100) working at 1–25 Hz. The continuous light of a laser-driven Xe lamp (Energetiq EQ-99-Plus-EU) and pump pulses of a Xe flash lamp (PerkinElmer 1100 Series) were employed for kinetic and spectral data acquisition, respectively. The setup was equipped with a two-channel CCD spectrometer (Avantes AvaSpec-ULS2048-2-USB2) for spectral measurements and allowed registration of time-resolved spectra from 1 µs to seconds. The acquisition of kinetic data was performed using a home-built monochromator equipped with a fast PMT (Hamamatsu R5108) and an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3032). The samples were irradiated in a 1 cm path-length quartz cell. The solutions were degassed by a freeze–pump–thaw technique before measurements. To ensure accuracy of the obtained data, upon collecting the first set of transient triplet–triplet absorption spectra and triplet state lifetimes the solutions were diluted down to half of the initial concentration and all measurements were repeated. As the intersystem crossing efficiency is very low in the investigated compounds, in order to increase the population of the compounds studied, the photo-sensitization method was used. Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride has a suitable ground state absorption at 460 nm, apart from the aza-BODIPY absorption region and the high quantum yield of intersystem crossing for subsequent triplet state formation.

4.4. Computational details
The ground state geometry optimization and the harmonic frequency calculations were performed with the DFT method employing the PBE0 functional with the 6-311G(2d,p) basis set.55 The vertical electronic transitions were computed by the TD-DFT method, employing the BMK and PBE0 functionals with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set. The polarization continuum model (PCM) was applied to simulate a tetrahydrofuran (THF) medium for both the ground and the excited electronic states.56 All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software.57 Visualization of the MOs was achieved with the Gabedit program.58 Contributions of different parts of the molecules to the frontier orbitals and analysis of the electronic transitions were done with GaussSum 3.0.59
5. Conclusions
Incorporation of the boron difluoride moiety (–BF2) into the nitro-substituted aza-dipyrromethene ligands 1–4 resulted in four novel aza-BODIPYs 5–8. The aza-BODIPYs studied in this work exhibit a broad absorption band (from around 600 nm to approximately 700 nm) in the visible part of the spectrum with λmax located at ca. 650 nm to ca. 690 nm. The boron complexes 5–8 exhibit weak fluorescence with the non-radiative deactivation pathway as the predominant way of the excited state energy dissipation. Recording of the time-resolved transient absorption spectra allowed direct determination of the excited triplet state lifetimes (τT) of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8. The triplet lifetimes (τT) measured were in the range of 77.7 µs to 130.5 µs at room temperature. Aza-BODIPYs with p-nitro-phenyl rings located at 1 and 7 positions exhibit a bathochromic shift of both the absorption (λabs) and emission bands (λfl), and possess longer triplet lifetimes (τT) and fluorescence lifetimes (τf) compared to their regioisomeric congeners with p-nitro-phenyl rings at 3 and 5 positions. CV/DPV measurements revealed that the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs 5–8 undergo one oxidation and two reductions within the potential range applied. We established that the gap between the HOMO and the LUMO (Eg), the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) and the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) remained relatively constant across all nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs studied in this work. The boron containing complexes (aza-BODIPY 5–8) were easier to reduce and slightly harder to oxidize than the respective aza-dipyrromethene ligands (1–4) reported by us elsewhere. The aza-BODIPY 5–8 required 350 mV to 450 mV more positive potential for the first reduction to occur compared to their aza-dipyrromethene ligands 1–4. The photostability studies pointed to very good photostability of the nitro-substituted aza-BODIPYs studied while the thermogravimetric analysis pointed to high thermal stability up to approximately 300 °C of these boron complexes. Currently, related work is performed in our laboratory on halogenated derivatives of 5–8 aimed at increasing their potency as photosensitizers for biomedical applications.
