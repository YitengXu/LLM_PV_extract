    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 5th June 2020AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted significant research attention as they enable high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Recently, a new NFA named Y6 was reported to yield highly efficient OSCs with efficiency up to 15.7%. Then, the research interests regarding the structure–property relationship and further structural optimization of Y6 have risen sharply. In this study, we report a new NFA, N3-4Cl, using IC-2Cl as the end group and replacing the alkyl side chains on the N-position of the pyrrole unit with branched side chains on the third position. The combined substitution on Y6 yields electronic effects on energy levels and thus the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding OSCs. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of N3-4Cl is up-shifted compared to that of Y6-4Cl; thus, a higher Voc of 0.85 V is obtained. In addition, PM6: an N3-4Cl blend film can also maintain an optimal blend morphology with reasonably high and balanced charge mobility, which leads to a high fill factor (FF) of up to 74.9%. As a result, PM6:N3-4Cl-based device reached a PCE of 16.5% in binary devices. The results suggest that tuning the side chains of NFAs is an effective method for optimizing energy levels and aggregation properties, thus enhancing the OSC performances.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great success during the past few years due to their various advantages, such as light weight, portability and simple manufacturing process.1–9 Fullerene derivatives are used as acceptors in conventional OSCs, which have their limitations of insufficient absorption, fixed chemical structure and poor stability.10–15 To address these problems, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been extensively investigated due to their easily tunable absorption range, energy levels and chemical structures.16–30 Currently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 16% have been achieved by NFAs, demonstrating the great potential of OSCs.31–36
Recently, an efficient NFA named Y6 was reported to achieve high-performance OSCs with PCEs of 15.7%.36 One of the important merits of the Y6-based devices is that they can achieve a low voltage loss of ∼0.5 V while maintaining a promising short-circuit current density (Jsc) of over 25 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 75%. Although Y6 exhibits excellent performances, studying the structure–property relationship of this series of molecules is of great significance. There are several structural features of Y6 that are worth investigating. We believe that the strategy of modifying the alkyl side chains, such as changing the length or branching positions, can further improve its performance.11,15,37–47 On one hand, the alkyl side chains have little electronic effects, so the modified molecules should have identical absorption, energy levels and other electrical properties.48–51 On the other hand, the alkyl side chains with numerous branching positions can introduce different effects on the intramolecular conformation locking, which can alter the aggregation properties of NFAs.52 Apart from changing the alkyl side chains, the end groups also play an important role in optimizing the device performances. In previous reports, chlorine-substituted end groups have been employed in the design of NFAs.33,34,53 Upon the modifications of Y6 with a chlorinated end group, the resulting molecule (named Y6-4Cl in this study) exhibited a slightly red-shifted absorption, and the Y6-4Cl-based devices achieved better performances with higher Voc and smaller voltage losses relative to those based on Y6. However, one disadvantage of the chlorinated end group could be the decreased solubility of NFA, which may affect the device processing and the nano-scale morphology of OSCs.
In this study, we combine the above design strategies to develop a novel NFA named N3-4Cl with the third-positioned branched side chains and the chlorinated end groups. We compared the physical properties and photovoltaic performances of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl. Interestingly, it is found that the tuning of the side chain in N3-4Cl has slight electronic effects and introduces a little enhancement in Voc of the devices due to the up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of Y6-4Cl relative to N3-4Cl. Besides, the PM6:N3-4Cl blend films can maintain the optimal morphology with a reasonably small domain size and high crystallinity, resulting in high and balanced charge mobility, thereby obtaining a higher FF. As a result of the combined substitution, we achieve a highly efficient binary OSC with a Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 25.9 mA cm−2, FF of 74.9% and PCEs of 16.5%. To the best of our knowledge, these results suggest that altering the branched positions of the side chains could optimize Voc and aggregation, and thus increasing the device efficiencies.
The main difference between Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl is the length of the alkyl chain substituent on the N-position of the pyrrole unit. Based on our attempt, after changing the alkyl chain substituent to 3-ethylheptyl (3-EH) on the N atom of the pyrrole unit in the molecule, the solubility of the resulting molecule largely increases so that it can be completely dissolved in common organic solvents (e.g. chloroform). In our opinion, the aggregation properties are not necessarily opposite to the solubility (e.g. the perylene diimides can form highly ordered crystalline aggregates yet they have excellent solubility). On one hand, the γ-branched alkyl chains sit farther away from the molecular backbone and generate less steric hindrance than the β-branched one, which is beneficial for the intermolecular packing. On the other hand, the number of carbon atoms increases from 8 in the 2-EH chain to 9 in the 3-EH one, which is favorable for enhancing the solubility of N3-4Cl. As a result, N3-4Cl can achieve better solubility in the solution state for the spin-coating process and stronger aggregation in the solid state for excellent charge transport simultaneously. The structure of the resulting molecule named N3-4Cl is displayed in Fig. 1a with R being the 3-ethylheptyl chain. The synthesis route of N3-4Cl shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†) is similar to that of Y6 and Y6-4Cl.34,36 The intermediates of N3-4Cl containing the branched side chains on the third position are synthesized according to the literature.46 The corresponding NMR spectra and mass spectrum of N3-4Cl are displayed in the ESI.† According to the thermogravimetric analysis plots (Fig. S1, ESI†), the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl are 319 °C and 321 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively, which indicate that both the molecules have good thermal stability.

As displayed in Fig. S2a (ESI†), N3-4Cl exhibits intensive absorption from 600 nm to 800 nm in the chloroform solution, with a maximum molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 702 nm, which is slightly higher than that of Y6-4Cl (Table 1). Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl in thin films exhibit absorption edges at 916 nm and 920 nm, respectively, (Fig. 1b), which is red-shifted by 118 and 119 nm relative to those in the solution state, respectively, implying that both the small molecule acceptors exhibit bathochromic absorption in the solid state to a comparable extent. Interestingly, the 0–1 peak of N3-4Cl that is located between 700 and 780 nm is more intense than that of Y6-4Cl, which suggests a stronger intermolecular packing in the N3-4Cl film. The optical bandgaps of both Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl are calculated to be 1.35 eV from their absorption edges in the thin film state. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl were derived from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, in which Fc/Fc+ (4.75 eV) is taken as the external standard. According to the CV plots in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the LUMO/HOMO levels of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl are calculated to be −4.00/−5.65 eV and −3.98/−5.63 eV (Table 1 and Fig. 1c), respectively. It can be concluded that the branched alkyl substitution on the third position of Y6-4Cl can slightly upshift the LUMO/HOMO at the same level, which should result in OSCs with higher Voc. The electrochemical band gaps calculated from CV is the same for Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl, which is consistent with the trends of their optical band gaps.

To understand the molecular geometry and energy levels of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl, density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were performed under the condition that the long side chains are replaced with methyl groups on the thiophene rings. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the top view of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl are almost the same, but the side views are different. Due to the branched alkyl chains of the pyrrole ring, both SMA has slightly a twisted structure. However, N3-4Cl shows a slightly more planar geometry than Y6-4Cl, implying that the third-positioned branched side chains cause less steric hindrance for the intermolecular packing. According to the calculation results, the LUMO and HOMO levels of N3-4Cl (−3.50 and −5.62 eV) are 0.01 eV higher than those of Y6-4Cl (−3.51 and −5.63 eV), which is consistent with the CV measurements.
To test the device performance of Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl, a medium band gap polymer PM6 (Fig. 1a) was selected as the electron donor because of its suitable absorption range and the energy levels. The OSC devices were made with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:NFA/PNDIT-F3N/Ag, where the thicknesses of the active layers are kept at ∼100 nm. The optimal photovoltaic parameters of the devices are displayed in Table 2. It is clear from the J–V curves (Fig. 2a) that the N3-4Cl based devices can achieve a higher Voc of 0.85 V as well as a high FF of 74.9% relative to Y6-4Cl. Therefore, an excellent PCE of 16.5% can be achieved by the N3-4Cl-based devices. According to the device results, the third-positioned branched alkyl side chain has little influence on Jsc due to the same optical band-gaps of the acceptors. However, Voc is slightly improved because of the upshifted LUMO level and hence higher FF is obtained compared to that of the Y6-4Cl-based devices, contributing to the overall higher PCEs of the N3-4Cl-based devices.

EQE was measured to figure out the reason for different Jsc of the Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl based OSCs. The integrated Jsc of OSCs based on Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl, calculated from the corresponding EQE spectrum (25.16 vs. 25.10 mA cm−2, Fig. 2b), reasonably agreed to the measured Jsc (Table 2). For both the PM6:Y6-4Cl and PM6:N3-4Cl devices, the EQE reached above 70% in the range of 470 nm to 840 nm, which are consistent with their blend film absorption (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The EQE results reveal that the decrease in Jsc from N3-4Cl to Y6-4Cl is caused by slightly lower EQE located within 720 nm to 780 nm, corresponding to the weaker intra-molecular 0–1 peak of Y6-4Cl. Both the Y6-4Cl- and N3-4Cl-based devices can maintain promising EQE in the absorption range of the acceptor.
By using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC, Fig. S4, ESI†) method, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl blend films were measured to study the effect of the alkyl substitution on the carrier mobility. As listed in Table 2, the blend films of PM6:Y6-4Cl and PM6:N3-4Cl show a similar μh of 7.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the PM6:N3-4Cl blend films show a slightly higher μe of 4.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to that of the PM6:Y6-4Cl blend films (3.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Besides, the μh/μe ratio of the PM6:N3-4Cl blend films is 1.72, while that of the PM6:Y6-4Cl blend films is 1.92. The higher electron mobility and more balanced charge mobility contribute to the slightly higher FF of the PM6:N3-4Cl based OSCs.
To investigate the charge dissociation efficiency, we measured the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the optimized devices, as shown in Fig. 3. Here, Jph = JL − JD, wherein JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − V, wherein V0 is the voltage when Jph equals to zero and V is the applied voltage.54 In general, Jph is saturated (Jsat) at high Veff greater than ∼2 V. The exciton dissociation probabilities P(E, T) were calculated by Jph/Jsat. As shown in Table 3, the Y6-4Cl-based devices exhibits a high P(E, T) of 94.0% and 82.0% under short circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively, while the respective values for N3-4Cl based devices are 94.5% and 83.5%, indicating the efficient exciton dissociation process and thus resulting in higher Jsc and FF for the PM6:N3-4Cl combination.

Two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) were utilized to investigate the morphology change in the two blend films based on Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl. The 2D GIWAXS patterns are displayed in Fig. 4 with the key parameters listed in Table 4. Comparing the two 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding parameters of pure PM6 (Fig. S6, ESI†), both the films show intense (010) diffraction peaks at q ≈ 1.79 Å−1 and 1.76 Å−1 for Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl, respectively, indicating that both NFAs have predominant face-on orientations. The face-on orientations from the NFAs are in favor of the charge migration and result in high FF. Moreover, the (010) d-spacing and coherence length of the (010) π–π stacking for PM6:N3-4Cl are 3.57 Å and 43.8 Å, respectively, which are larger than that of the PM6:Y6-4Cl blend films. The GIWAXS results reveal that the morphology of PM6:N3-4Cl has a stronger π–π stacking compared with that of the PM6:Y6-4Cl films, which is beneficial for charge transportation. Therefore, the PM6:N3-4Cl-based devices can achieve higher FF.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to probe the surface morphology of the films based on Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl. The corresponding AFM height sensor images are displayed in Fig. 5a and b and the AFM phase images are shown in Fig. 5c and d. As shown in the figures, slightly larger domain size is observed for the N3-4Cl blend film. The good blend film morphology can be further evidenced by the efficient photoluminescence quenching of the Y6-4Cl and N3-4Cl-based films,55,56 but the quenching of N3-4Cl is slightly more efficient when the film is excited at 785 nm and 514 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicating more efficient charge separation. Upon, substituting the branching position from second to the third one on the alkyl chain, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness increases from 0.946 nm for Y6-4Cl to 1.17 nm for N3-4Cl, indicating that the larger domains are formed after changing the branching position, which increased the contact area between the active layer and interfacial electrode, thus enhancing the charge collection and Jsc values.

In summary, a new NFA named N3-4Cl was designed and synthesized by changing the substitution on Y6-4Cl from second to the third-position of the branched alkyl side chains. It is found that the alkyl substitution can slightly upshift the LUMO level of the resulting molecule, which helps the OSCs based on PM6:N3-4Cl to achieve a higher Voc of 0.85 V. In addition, the PM6:N3-4Cl-based films can achieve nearly optimal morphology with a small domain size and good crystallinity, which leads to relatively high and balanced charge mobility in the blends, and therefore a high FF of 74.9% can be achieved. Simultaneously, the PM6:N3-4Cl based devices can achieve high EQE of over 80%, which leads to a reasonably high Jsc of 25.9 mA cm−2. All these parameters combined lead to the highest PCE of 16.5% for the PM6:N3-4Cl devices, which suggest that tuning the side chains is an effective method for optimizing the Voc and aggregation, and thus enhancing the OPV performances.
