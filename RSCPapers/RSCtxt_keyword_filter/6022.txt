    , Accepted 18th September 2020First published on 18th September 2020AbstractDirect growth of self-supported one-dimensional (1D) nanorod arrays on conducting substrates is highly attractive for electrocatalysis, due to their unique shape, size, and length. In this work, a facile and simple two-step method was employed to synthesize 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays on titanium (Ti) foil via a wet chemical ion-exchange approach. The as-synthesized 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays were directly used as electrode materials for hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitors. As an electrocatalyst, the optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution properties with a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1, low overpotentials of 41 mV@1 mA cm−2 and 216 mV@10 mA cm−2, and extended robust performance for 25 h. Moreover, for a symmetric device, it delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 152 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a better energy density of 21.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1. Also, the symmetric device capacity retention behavior achieves ∼96.8% of the initial result after 5000 cycles, revealing the good stability of the electrode. Our findings offer a new way to further the development of high-performance energy devices.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting is an ideal source for clean energy with high calorific value, environmentally friendly, and renewable pollution-free energy production.1,2 Scientists have paid a great deal of attention to explore several advanced materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), because hydrogen is stable in hydrocarbons and it cannot be directly derived from nature.3 At present, precious Pt group metals are well known as state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts, boasting zero overpotential, small Tafel slope, and diverse pH tolerance; however, their high cost and low abundance severely hinder widespread industrial application.4,5 Therefore, it is crucial to design superior, low-cost, and acid-/alkaline-stable alternatives for HER electrocatalysts.
Subsequently, metallic Co has emerged as an interesting nonprecious metal due to its surprising 3d electronic configuration.6,7 Hence, significant effort and progress have been made to develop Co-based centers as homogeneous molecular catalysts for water splitting.8,9 To date, Co-based nanostructures such as Co–Cu–WSx ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres,10 triple-shelled Co–VSx and yolk–double shell Co–VOx nanocages,11 and quaternary Ni–Co–MoSx12 are widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells and HER due to their high catalytic activities, large surface areas, and unique structures and morphologies. However, preparation of Co-based materials and their deployment as HER catalysts on a large scale are still challenging tasks due to high cost and limited production yield.
Among other possible alternatives, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2, where typically M = Mo, W, Fe, Co, or Ni and X = S, Se or Te) have gained considerable attention as non-noble, low-cost, and earth-abundant catalysts for HER.13,14 Extensive research works have been reported for transition metal oxides or transition metal sulfides, but few are available for transition metal selenides (TMSe2).15,16 However, the controllable preparation of TMSe with diversified morphology structures remains a great challenge for their use as efficient electrodes.17,18 The morphology and electrical conductivity of electrocatalysts are other important key parameters affecting the electrocatalytic performance.17,19 It has been noted that CoX2 (X = S, Se, Te) is an attractive catalyst material for the bifunctional processes of both HER and OER.20 Due to their intrinsic metallic nature, CoSe2 and CoS2 are the most active electrocatalysts among MX2 materials and also promote the rapid charge transport at the electrode–electrolyte interface.21,22 Recently, CoSe2-based heterogeneous catalysts have been prepared to improve the HER performance because of easy electron transformation and accelerated reaction kinetics in the compound and hybrid structures such as nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide,23 CoS2/CoSe2 hybrid,15 WS2/CoSe2 heterostructure,24 MoS2/CoSe2 hybrid,25 CoSe2/CoMoO4 hybrid26 and Ni/NiO/CoSe2.27 However, few reports are available of the preparation of CoSe2 micro- and nanostructures,28 CoSe2 nanorods,16 CoSe2 nanowires,22 and CoSe2 nanoparticles.29 The preparation methods are costly and time-consuming, and also their outputs show inferior electrochemical properties.
Additionally, MX2 materials have been extensively investigated as electrodes for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and so forth.13,30,31 However, the poor intrinsic conductivity, lower specific capacity and inferior cycling stability limit their wide application for supercapacitors. Cobalt-based metal is an attractive pseudocapacitive material and has been widely employed as an electroactive material for supercapacitors.32–34 By contrast, TMSe, especially CoSe2, an important class of MX2, possesses much better electronic conductivity and electrochemical activity, which can be very promising for energy storage and conversion. Fabricating compositions of Co- and Se-based material is an efficacious way to generate more active edges sites, improve conductivity, and enhance the cycling ability.35,36 However, reports of CoSe2 nanostructure-based supercapacitors are rare.
In this study, a facile two-step chemical growth method was applied to synthesize 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays. Initially, thin 1D-Co3O4 was grown on Ti foil by CBD with thermal annealing at 400 °C, and subsequently was transformed to a 1D-CoSe2 nanoarray through a simple ion-exchange method. After the introduction of Se atoms by ion exchange, CoSe2 nanoarrays were strongly adhered to the Ti foil support and had a high surface area, exposed edges, and superior electronic conductivity, which are promising for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. When the optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) catalyst is utilized as a HER catalyst, it shows low overpotentials of 41 mV and 216 mV at a cathodic current density of 1 mA cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2 respectively, and superior stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. Also, the symmetric 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 152 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a remarkable energy density of 21.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Chemicals
The Ti foil substrates (0.05 mm thick, annealed, 99.6% metal basis) were purchased from Alfa Aesar, Korea. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), urea (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%), selenium powder (Se, Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and sodium hydroxymethylsulfonate (CH3NaO3S, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) were purchased. All chemicals mentioned above were used as received. All the solutions were prepared using reagent-grade deionized water (18 MΩ cm resistivity).
2.2 Preparation of aqueous selenium solution
One gram (1 g) of Se powder was dispersed in 50 ml distilled water with constant stirring. Later, appropriate amounts of NaOH and CH3NaO3S were added and heated to 100 °C until a clear solution was obtained. After reaction completion, the solution was kept in airtight vials for further use.
2.3 Fabrication of 1D-CoSe2/Ti foil
All Ti foil substrates were cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol solution, and deionized water and then dried at room temperature (RT). Two steps were employed to prepare the 1D-CoSe2. At first, a Ti foil substrate, exposed with an active geometric area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2, was dipped upside-down in a Teflon square holder and kept in a 50 ml glass beaker with an aqueous solution, containing 3.15 wt% of urea and 0.15 M of cobalt chloride, at 90 °C for 3 h. After reaction completion, the fabricated film on the Ti foil was converted to a film of 1D-Co3O4 by thermal treatment at 400 °C for 30 min in air. To fabricate a 1D-CoSe2 nanoarray, the as-prepared 1D-Co3O4 nanoarray was immersed in Se2− aqueous solution for various periods for anion exchange (ex) at RT for various lengths of time (t): 3, 12, 24 36 and 48 h. The obtained films were washed with deionized water and denoted as CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h), and CoSe2(tex-48 h), respectively, in further discussion. To improve the crystallinity, all the samples were further annealed at 400 °C in a selenium environment.
2.4 HER performance
HER experiment was conducted using a CHI 660D electrochemical system at RT in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) aqueous electrolyte with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. For the HER performance, a three-electrode system was used including a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)), a counter electrode (graphite rod) and a working electrode (1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h) nanoarrays on Ti foil) for linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. LSV measurement was performed after the deduction of iR loss using ohmic resistance. The HER potential values were exchanged for a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following formula: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + E° (Ag/AgCl) + 0.0592 × pH. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was done in an acid medium with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–100 kHz.
2.5 Supercapacitor measurements

2.5.1 Three-electrode measurement. 
The storage performance of 1D-Co3O4 and optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) was determined using a three-electrode electrochemical system in 3.0 M KOH aqueous solution at RT. For three-electrode measurement, 1D-Co3O4 and optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) on Ti foil as the working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode were used. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were carried out in the voltage window between −0.1 V and +0.5 V using a Biologic SP 150 electrochemical workstation. EIS was carried out at a frequency ranging from 0.1 to 105 Hz.


2.5.2 Two-electrode measurement. 
A solid-state symmetric device for the optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) was fabricated by assembling two identical electrodes with PVA@KOH gel electrolyte-soaked Whatman cellulose filter paper as a separator. To prepare the PVA@KOH gel electrolyte, 2 g of PVA and 2 g of KOH were dissolved into 40 mL of water with continuous stirring at 90 °C until the solution became homogeneous and clear. The PVA@KOH solution was left for some time without heating until it became a gel-like electrolyte. Thereafter, the two identical 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrodes and filter paper were soaked into the gel, and then both electrodes and separator were dried at RT to evaporate the excess water. Finally, the optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device was assembled and electrochemical measurements were performed.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties of 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays
The 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-3 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-12 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-24 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-36 h), and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) formed using different ion-exchange times were prepared successfully as described in the Experimental section. Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the two-step synthesis procedure for 1D-CoSe2. Based on detailed experiments, our optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) sample exhibits the best performance for HER and supercapacitors. Hence, the morphological evolutions of as-prepared 1D-Co3O4 and optimized CoSe2(tex-48 h) were further monitored by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). From the FE-SEM images (Fig. 2a and b), as-fabricated 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) seemed to be homogeneous to form vertically aligned rod-like structures on the Ti foil substrates with a diameter of around 1 μm and height of several micrometers without obvious agglomeration. After the ion exchange conversion with the post-annealing steps for 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h), a rod-like morphology still exists; however, the surface is covered with pineapple-like branches of edge structures. The highly exposed edges on the rod structure furthermore enlarge the active surface area and reduce the ion diffusion path for fast electron/ion transport processes which deliver swift electrolyte transport at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Cross-sectional FE-SEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement (Fig. S1†) also confirm the nanoarrays and chemical composition of Co/Se elements for optimized CoSe2(tex-48 h), respectively. The obtained results showed the existence of Co, O and Se with atomic % of 27.03, 49.37 and 23.60, respectively, indicating the successful synthesis of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays. Fig. S2a–f† show high-magnification FE-SEM images of 1D-Co3O4 and CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h), and CoSe2(tex-48 h). In terms of different ion exchange selenization times, 1D-CoSe2 has a rod-like uniform structure, being crack-free. However, plenty of edges on the rods increase the density of active sites thereby promoting ion/electron transfer.

For further in-depth understanding of the interface of optimized CoSe2(tex-48 h), HR-TEM characterization was further carried out (Fig. 2c–e). A typical 1D-CoSe2 rod-like structure is revealed by TEM imaging. The pineapple-like branches of edge structures are observed on the nanorod for CoSe2(tex-48 h). Fig. 2d shows distinct lattice fringes with interplanar distance of 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (210) plane of 1D-CoSe2. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2e) shows discrete spots indexed to the (200), (210) and (030) planes for the cubic-phase CoSe2.22 Meanwhile, TEM elemental mapping and the corresponding Co, Se and O element uniform distribution in the nanorods ascertain 1D-CoSe2 formation (Fig. 2f–j).
The structural properties of Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2 (with different ion exchange selenization times of 3 h–48 h) nanoarrays were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the results are presented in Fig. 3a. The XRD pattern of Co3O4 nanoarrays reveals peaks at 2θ = 31.3°, 36.8°, 38.56°, 44.0°, 59.3° and 65.2° indexed to 220, 311, 222, 400, 511 and 440 planes of cubic phase of Co3O4, respectively (JCPDS card no. 76-1802). After the ion exchange selenization process (3–48 h), the diffraction peaks appear at angles 2θ = 24.9°, 29.2°, 34.9°, 38.3°, 40.4°, 53.2°, 63.3°, 70.8°, 76.5° and 77.3° corresponding to the (110), (011), (111), (200), (210), (030), (301), (140), (132) and (330) crystal planes of 1D-CoSe2 (JCPDS card no. 89-2003), respectively. No other impurity-related peaks are observed, revealing the formation of pure 1D-CoSe2 after the selenization reaction. Fig. 3b shows the Raman spectrum of optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays. A sharp peak at 170 cm−1 is observed corresponding to the Se–Se stretching mode of cubic CoSe2.21

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed for surface elemental compositions of 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays. Survey scans of 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) are provided in Fig. 4a. The survey spectrum of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) confirms the coexistence of Co and Se elements, and the calculated ratio is 1:2, indicating good stoichiometry of CoSe2 nanorods. Fig. 4b shows the Co 2p binding energy region of 1D-Co3O4 for which are observed mainly two characteristic peaks at 778.4 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 793.7 eV (Co 2p1/2) along with weak satellite peaks.36 For 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays, the deconvolution of Co 2p binding energy reveals the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 doublets at 778.4 eV and 793.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 4c). The strong satellite peaks observed at 784.3 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 803.2 eV (Co 2p1/2) are attributed to Co2+.37Fig. 4d shows Se 3d spectra of 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays, where 1D-Co3O4 shows a straight line (violet) due to the absence of Se. In addition, in the Se 3d spectrum of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays (black spheres) deconvolution doublet peaks appear at 54.6 and 55.3 eV corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, in good agreement with previously reported results for CoSe2.38–40

3.2 Electrocatalytic HER performance
The electrocatalytic activities of commercial Pt, 1D-Co3O4, and CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h) and CoSe2(tex-48 h) samples were evaluated with a three-electrode electrochemical setup at RT in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution purged with N2. Fig. 5a shows the LSV polarization curves after iR-correction at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 for Pt, 1D-Co3O4, and CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h) and CoSe2(tex-48 h). A commercial Pt electrocatalyst delivers a close-to-zero overpotential, showing its signature as a superior catalyst among all the materials. The LSV curve of 1D-Co3O4 shows insignificant catalytic activity toward the HER with large overpotential (377 mV@10 mA cm−2). After the wet chemical ion exchange for different times (tex-3–48 h) to form 1D-CoSe2, the overpotential decreases gradually. Notably, (tex-48 h) nanoarray exhibits low overpotentials of 41 mV and 216 mV at 1 mA cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, among all the nanoarrays. The overpotentials of 1D-CoSe2(tex-3 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-12 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-24 h), and 1D-CoSe2(tex-36 h) are 314, 265, 254 and 241 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density, respectively (Table S1†).
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical measurements for HER: (a) LSV curves of Pt, 1D-Co3O4, 1D-CoSe2(3–48 h); (b) Tafel plots of Pt, 1D-Co3O4, 1D-CoSe2(3–48 h); (c) Nyquist plots of Pt, 1D-Co3O4, 1D-CoSe2(3–48 h); and (d) current density versus time plot for the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrocatalyst (inset – LSV for before and after 25 h HER). 
Tafel slope, an intrinsic property of electrocatalysts, was obtained via extracting the slope from the linear region in Tafel plot to illustrate the reaction mechanism via three steps (eqn (1)–(3)) as depicted in Fig. 5(b). The HER process can be explained in acidic media through the following three steps:  Volmer reaction: H3O+ + e− → Hads+H2O(1) Heyrovsky reaction: Hads + H3O+ + e− → H2↑ + H2O(2) Tafel reaction: Hads + Hads → H2↑(3)
The Tafel slopes of 1D-Co3O4, CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h) and CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays are 98, 88, 78, 78, 73 and 72 mV dec−1, respectively. The derived Tafel slope in the range of 30–120 mV dec−1 in acidic electrolyte indicates a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.41,42 The exchange current densities (Jo) of 1D-Co3O4, CoSe2(tex-3 h), CoSe2(tex-12 h), CoSe2(tex-24 h), CoSe2(tex-36 h) and CoSe2(tex-48 h) are observed at 7.07 × 10−3, 1.62 × 10−2, 3.25 × 10−2, 4.75 × 10−2 and 5.62 × 10−2 mA cm−2, also suggesting high intrinsic catalytic activities for CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays owing to the low internal resistance and swift electron/proton transfer, thus leading to increased HER activity (Table S1†). The low overpotential, smaller Tafel slope and large Jo are also comparable to or lower than those of various TMD-based HER catalysts in the literature (Table S2†), supporting the superior HER kinetics of CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays. Obviously, with increasing the ion exchange time (t) from 3 to 48 h, the performance of HER characteristic linearly increases.
The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was further assessed to provide insights of 1D-CoSe2(tex-12 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-24 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-36 h) and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrocatalysts. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was further tested to calculate the ECSA values from the CV profiles (Fig. S3a–d†), which is linearly proportional to the ECSA.43,44 The current differences at 0.04 V vs. RHE (Δj = janodic − jcathodic) against different scan rates (10–100 mV s−1) were linearly fitted to evaluate the slope value, which was used as Cdl.18,24 The extracted Cdl values are 4.22 mF cm−2, 5.66 mF cm−2, 13.6 mF cm−2 and 15.3 mF cm−2 for 1D-CoSe2(tex-12 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-24 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-36 h) and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h), respectively. The ECSA values are 120 cm2, 160 cm2, 388 cm2 and 437 cm2 for 1D-CoSe2(tex-12 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-24 h), 1D-CoSe2(tex-36 h) and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h), respectively. The high ECSA value of optimized 1D-CoSe2-48 h electrocatalyst provides abundant active edges sites for the catalytic reaction and dramatically enhances the HER.
EIS measurement was performed to study the charge transfer mechanism during the HER process as shown in Fig. 5c. The small semicircles in the Nyquist plots represent the lowest Rct (3.7 Ω) in 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) compared to the other ion-exchanged 1D-CoSe2 samples (16–13 Ω) and 1D-Co3O4 (18.8 Ω), indicating a fast charge transport during the HER process. Chronoamperometry was also performed to examine the electrocatalytic stability.10 The current (I) vs. time (t) curve of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) (Fig. 5d) presents extremely stable performance for HER at a constant overpotential of 216 mV vs. RHE for continuous 25 h operation. No notable degradation is observed suggesting the excellent stability of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) catalyst in acidic electrolyte. The recorded LSV profile of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrocatalyst after 25 h of operation at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 overlaps almost exactly with the initial one (inset: Fig. 5d). The enhanced superior HER performance can be ascribed to the following. First, the random-sized nanorods with pineapple-like branches of exposed edges produce rich active sites for vertically aligned CoSe2 nanoarrays, beneficial for favorable HER characteristics. Second, the porous 1D-CoSe2 also facilitates the rapid ion/electron transportation near the interface of active materials and electrolyte to give higher current density at low overpotential and provides shortened ion diffusion channels. Third, the plenty of Se edges available in 1D-CoSe2 gives stronger electrocatalytic activity. Lastly, the metallic and superior conductive nature of CoSe2 on Ti foil, confirmed by EIS results, also plays an important role for the facile electrode kinetics to long life span and superior cycle stability.
FE-SEM, EDS and XRD analyses were carried out to prove the morphological, elemental mapping and structural stability of optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrocatalyst after 25 h of continuous HER operation. Fig. S4a and b† show different magnification FE-SEM images for 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) after 25 h HER which confirm the existence of nanorod structure, but aggregated phenomenon was well escalated during the 25 h of continuous hydrogen production. Moreover, XRD spectrum (Fig. S5†) also prove the existence of (200), (210), (030), (301), (140) and (132) crystal planes after 25 h HER for the optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrocatalyst which also signifies the stable structure formation.
3.3 Supercapacitance performance

3.3.1 Three-electrode measurements. 
To investigate the electrochemical capacitive behavior of 1D-Co3O4 and optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrodes, CV and GCD measurements were evaluated by a three-electrode system in 3.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. A comparative CV curve for the 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrodes was collected at a fixed scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential window from −0.1 V to +0.5 V as shown in Fig. 6a. The CV curves show two visible redox peaks for both 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) and 1D-Co3O4 nanoarray electrodes, indicating that the faradaic reaction is occurring during the process.45 The oxidation and reduction peaks can be ascribed to the Co2+/Co3+ redox couples in the nanoarray electrode. It is worth noting that the integral area under the current peak drastically enhances for the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode as compared to 1D-Co3O4. The observed peak high current density for the highly dense 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode demonstrates an outstanding interface and efficient carrier transport with the electrolyte, contributing to reaching excellent capacitive properties. To probe the inner capacitive behaviour, CV curves were collected at different scan rates in a range of 10–50 mV s−1 for the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode (Fig. 6d). The CV curves retain their shape with increasing scan rate up to 50 mV s−1, revealing excellent rate performance.46,47 Further, the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode gives excellent reversible electrochemical redox reactions. The CV curves of 1D-Co3O4 were also measured at different scan rates, and the results indicate a better rate performance as shown in Fig. S6.†

(a) CV curves for 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. (d) CV curves for 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays at various scan rates.

(c) Specific capacitance at different current densities for 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrodes. (f) EIS plot with an inset showing equivalent circuit. 
To further illustrate the capacitive performance of 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrodes, the GCD test was also conducted within the potential window of −0.1 V to +0.5 V at a fixed current density of 0.5 A g−1. The observed results clearly show a longer charge/discharge time for the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode as compared to 1D-Co3O4, confirming the enhanced capacitive performance as shown in Fig. 6b. The observed plateau in the GCD curve resembles the faradaic reaction, consistent with the CV results. Owing to the superior capacitive performance of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode, it was further used to record the GCD curves at different current densities to validate the electrochemical properties. Fig. 6e depicts the GCD curves of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays at various current densities ranging from 0.5 to 3 A g−1. The GCD curves at various current densities (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 A g−1) for the 1D-Co3O4 electrode were recorded and are presented in Fig. S7,† which shows an inferior capacitive behaviour compared to the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode. The specific capacitance (Cs) values were calculated using the following equation: Cs = I(Δt)/m(ΔV), where I is the current density, Δt is the discharge/charge time, ΔV is the potential window and m is the mass of active electrode material.30Fig. 6c shows the specific Cs variations with different current densities for 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) and 1D-Co3O4 electrodes. The Cs of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) and 1D-Co3O4 electrodes are 363, 181, 153 and 90 F g−1 and 120, 88.3, 36 and 10 F g−1 corresponding to 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 A g−1 current densities, respectively. However, the Cs of 1D-Co3O4 electrode signifies a poorer capacitive nature than the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrode. This result indicates that the intrinsic metallic nature and highly available active edges in CoSe2 promote charge transport behavior thereby improving the charge storage capability.48,49
EIS was performed at the open-circuit voltage in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz to further study the reaction kinetics of 1D-Co3O4 and 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrodes and their Nyquist plots are provided in Fig. 6f. The EIS curve consists of a semicircle at higher frequencies and a straight line at lower frequencies. The fitted electrical circuit is shown in the inset in Fig. 6f where Rs denotes the series resistance, horizontal intercept of the Nyquist curve, Rct denotes the charge transfer resistance, diameter of the semicircle, Zw is the Warburg impedance and CPE represents the constant phase elements. The semicircle indicates the lower Rct for 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays than the 1D-Co3O4 electrode and the straight line is associated with the Warburg impedance which originates from ion diffusion.39 The observed Rct value of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode is 3.7 Ω, which is less than that of 1D-Co3O4 (6.3 Ω), demonstrating the excellent electrical conductivity in the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode.48


3.3.2 Symmetric device of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48h) nanoarrays. 
In the previous section discussing aqueous three-electrode measurement results, 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays showed better capacitive behaviour, and hence a SSC device was constructed using CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays in order to demonstrate the practical use of the derived nanostructures. The SSC device was fabricated using 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) on Ti foil as identical positive and negative electrodes with PVA@KOH gel electrolyte as described in the Experimental section (2.5.2). A schematic illustration for the fabrication process of SSC device using 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays is presented in Fig. 7a. To acquire the appropriate operating voltage of the SSC device, CV measurements were performed at various voltage windows at 10 mV s−1. Fig. 7b displays the CV curves of the SSC device at various potential windows. When the voltage window was extended beyond 1 V, evolution of oxygen occurred, and thus 0–1 V operating potential was fixed for the SSC device. The CV curve displays a quasi-rectangular shape for SSC electrode of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays, demonstrating the ideal capacitive behavior. Fig. 7c shows the CV curves of 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) SSC device at various scan rates from 10 to 50 mV s−1. The results clearly show that the CV curves of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrode retain their quasi-rectangular shape without any redox peak even at high scan rates, indicating the strong EDLC behavior.46,47

(f) Specific capacitance at different current densities. (g) SSC device cycling stability for 5000 cycles. (h) Variation of energy density versus power density. (i) EIS plot with an inset showing equivalent circuit. 
The consistency of SSC devices is also an important factor to indicate the electrode characteristics, and hence multiple CV cycles were performed for the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray SSC. Fig. 7d displays 100 consecutive CV cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, which shows the sustained performance and excellent stability. Fig. 7e shows the GCD curves of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray SSC device at different current densities (i.e., 0.5 to 3 A g−1). SSC device Cs values were calculated using the following equation: Cs = 2(I(Δt)/m(ΔV)), where I is the current density, Δt is the discharge/charge time, ΔV is the potential window and m is the mass of active electrode material.48 The SSC device exhibits a remarkable capacitance of 152 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and retains 18 F g−1 capacitance at a high current density of 3 A g−1 as presented in Fig. 7f. Cycling stability is a crucial parameter to assess the practical application of SSC devices. GCD was performed at a constant current density of 3 A g−1 for 5000 cycles and the capacitance variation is demonstrated in Fig. 7g. The capacitance of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray SSC electrode retains 99% of its initial value until 3000 cycles, then it degrades 2.2% more of its capacitance to attain 96.8% for 5000 cycles, suggesting outstanding stability of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarrays for SSC devices.45,50
Moreover, the energy density is an imperative factor to evaluate the SSC device. The energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (kW kg−1) of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray SSC device were calculated using the following equations: E = [Cs(ΔV)2]/7.2 and P = 3600×E/dt, where Cs represents the specific capacitance, ΔV is the potential window range, E is the energy density and dt is the discharging time.30,51Fig. 7 h shows the energy density against power density for the CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode. The 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode exhibits a higher energy density of 21.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1 and maintains a 2.5 W h kg−1 energy density at a power density of 3 kW kg−1, which is a comparable performance to that of previously reported TMD materials (Table S3†).52–56
The coulombic efficiency is a significant indication for real applications. The coulombic efficiency of the SSC device was measured for different current density and different cycles at 3 A g−1 current density. Fig. S8a† reveals that the constructed SSC device has low coulombic efficiency for low current density and achieves improved behaviour for high current density which proves the high rate capability. Significantly, a 98.9% coulombic efficiency is observed at 3 A g−1 current density for over 5000 cycles which clarifies the excellent cycling stability and rate capability of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) SSC (Fig. S8b†). Fig. 7i shows the EIS plot to assess the conductive behaviour of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) SSC. Notably, the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) electrode shows a very low Rct of 1.03 Ω, suggesting rapid electron transfer kinetics and good conductivity. The fitted electrical circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7i, which comprises Rs, Rct, Zw and CPE. Fig. S9† shows the Bode plot of the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) SSC electrode which elaborates the capacitive behavior. From earlier reports, a phase angle between 90° and 45° region represents the electrode capacitive property, whereas between 45° and 0° region represents the resistive activity of an electrode.57 The proposed 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) SSC electrode shows a high phase angle of 70° at low frequency; however, showing lower than the ideal capacitor nature, describing the robust capacitive behavior due to EDLC nature.58

4. Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated the growth of a 1D-CoSe2 nanoarray on Ti foil by the wet chemical ion-exchange approach. The optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) catalyst possessed excellent HER performance with low overpotentials of 41 mV@1 mA cm−2 and 216 mV@10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1. Furthermore, the 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray electrode was demonstrated as a promising candidate for a solid-state device, delivering a better specific capacitance of 152 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with an energy density of 21.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1. The optimized 1D-CoSe2(tex-48 h) nanoarray-containing SSC device showed an excellent stability of 96.8% retention after 5000 cycles, suggesting a promising electrode for practical applications. Our facile and simple preparation of 1D-CoSe2 nanoarrays with abundant active sites means that they can be considered as a suitable material for future electrochemical energy applications.
