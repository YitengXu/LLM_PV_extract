    , Accepted 23rd December 2021First published on 24th December 2021AbstractGreat progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of methylamine (MA)-free inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is inseparable from the rapid development of hole transport layers (HTLs). We design and synthesize a polymer called PFDTS with a suitable energy level to match the energy level of perovskite. Furthermore, by virtue of the interactions of the carboxylic acid groups on the side chains of the PFDTS molecule with the indium tin oxide substrate and perovskite, perovskite can form compact and uniform films on the HTL surface. Therefore, the inverted MA-free PSC based on PFDTS as the HTL can obtain a PCE of 20.15%, a 10% enhancement relative to the control device based on PTAA that is widely used in inverted PSCs. In addition, the PFDTS-based device also shows better air and thermal stability than the PTAA-based device. The PFDTS-based device maintains 91% of the initial PCE against 75% for the PTAA-based device after storing under the ambient conditions for 1000 h. The former retains 80% of the initial PCE against 66% for the latter after continuous heating at 85 °C for 500 h. It can be seen that PFDTS is a promising hole transport material for MA-free inverted PSCs.
Introduction
Methylamine (MA)-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread interest, with continuous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 The great advancement of PSCs results from the outstanding properties of perovskite,6,7 which is also inseparable from the rapid development of interface materials, especially hole transport materials (HTMs) for inverted PSCs, because these materials can avoid the limitations of HTMs for regular-structured devices. For example, these materials are dopant-free HTMs, which are beneficial to reduce the hysteresis and improve the stability of devices.8–10
The hole transport layer (HTL) plays a vital role in inverted PSCs, and it has the following major functions. (1) Selectively transporting carriers. The HTL can quickly extract and transport holes from the active layer, while blocking the transport of electrons.11–13 (2) Modifying the work function of the electrode. The HTL can adjust the energy level difference between the electrode and the active layer to reduce energy loss.14–16 (3) Regulating perovskite crystallization. The HTL can interact with the perovskite, which may regulate the crystallization of the perovskite, thereby affecting the morphology of perovskite.17–19 These effects provide potential impetus for the vigorous development of HTLs.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) can form high-quality HTL films with low temperature processing and are widely used in inverted PSCs.20–23 However, they have their own limitations. For PEDOT:PSS, because its energy level is not well matched with that of perovskite, the big energy level difference may lead to energy loss at the HTL/perovskite interface, thus decreasing the performance of solar cells.24,25 In addition, stability is its biggest drawback due to its hygroscopic and acid nature, which corrodes perovskite and degrades the device performance and stability.26,27 With regard to PTAA, its own hydrophobicity results in difficulty for the perovskite precursor solution to well spread on the PTAA surface, which is not conducive to the formation of high-quality perovskite films.28,29 What's more, the poor planar structure and π–π interaction leads to unfavorable recombination, thus affecting the performance of the corresponding devices.30,31 To sum up, great efforts are urgent to develop novel HTMs with the properties of low temperature processing, suitable energy level and good long-term stability.
In this work, by combining the high mobility characteristics of the dithiophene-dithiolane (DTP) unit and a suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the fluorene unit, we designed and synthesized a polymer, poly[3,3′-(2-(spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,2′-[1,3]dithiolan]-2-yl)-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)dipropionic acid] (PFDTS), which is used as the HTM for inverted MA-free PSCs. As compared to the frequently used bithiophene unit for the HTM, the DTP unit has larger dipole moment, which would promote charge separation and increase the mobility of the carrier. The carboxylic acid groups of the side chains can not only increase the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), which can improve the open circuit voltage (VOC), but also promote the crystallization of the perovskite due to its interaction with perovskite.32 It is precisely because of the contribution of PFDTS to the perovskite crystallization, where there are fewer defects in the perovskite and the charge recombination is thus reduced. On this basis, the inverted MA-free PSC based on PFDTS as the HTL can obtain a PCE of 20.15%, where the VOC is 1.082 V, the short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) is 24.03 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) is 77.5%. In contrast, the PSC based on PTAA as the HTL can only obtain a PCE of 18.25%, where the VOC is 1.059 V, the JSC is 23.26 mA cm−2, and FF is 74.1%. In addition, devices based on PFDTS exhibit better air and thermal stabilities than PTAA based devices. In an environment with a relative humidity of 20–30% and a temperature of 20–30 °C, the PFDTS-based device can still maintain 91% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h, while the PTAA-based device can only retain 75% of the initial efficiency. In the case of heating at 85 °C in nitrogen under indoor natural light, the device based on PFDTS can retain 80% of the original PCE after 500 h, against 66% for the PTAA based device.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PTAA and PFDTS are respectively presented in Fig. 1a and b, and the synthesis details of PFDTS are presented in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† The synthesized products in each step are confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (Fig. S1–S8†). We also carried out gel permeation chromatography to measure the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polymer dispersity index (PDI). As shown in Fig. S9,† the Mn of PFDTS is 7.2 kDa, and the PDI is 2.2. To obtain appropriate carrier mobility and energy levels, the DTP unit and fluorene unit are selected as the main chain structure of PFDTS. What's more, the carboxylic acid functional groups of the side chains can increase the polarity of the molecule. The COOH group attached to PFDTS seems to be acidic, which, if so, would degrade the perovskite like PEDOT:PSS. However, the pH value of the PFDTS aqueous solution is measured to be 6.86. This shows that PFDTS is neutral and would not degrade the adjacent perovskite layer because it is difficult for protons in the carboxylic acid group of PFDTS to ionize.

Fig. S10† displays the contact angle of a mixture solvent (DMF:DMSO = 3:1, v:v), which is used for the perovskite precursor solution, on the PTAA and PFDTS films, respectively. The PFDTS film shows a much smaller contact angle (44.8°) than the PTAA film (92.1°). This result indicates that the perovskite precursor solution is easier to spread on the PFDTS film than on the PTAA film. And the carboxylic acid group on the side chain of PFDTS would not corrode the perovskite. Therefore, PFDTS can promote the crystallization of perovskite, facilitating the preparation of high-quality perovskite films.32
To study the molecular geometries and surface potential distribution, density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP level are applied. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the main chain structure of PFDTS exhibits better planarity than PTAA, benefiting π–π stacking of the solid phase.33Fig. 1e and f show the electrostatic potential surface distribution of PTAA and PFDTS, respectively. As for PTAA, the negative charge distribution is relatively uniform. With regard to PFDTS, the negative charge is mainly concentrated on the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group and the entire plane of DTP, which can act as Lewis base anchors to interact with Pb,34 while the positive charge is mainly concentrated on the hydroxyl group and the entire plane of fluorene. This differential distribution of positive and negative charges is conducive to the π–π* transition of the charge.8
To further understand the optical properties of PFDTS, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the solution and film were characterized, and the UV-vis absorption spectra of PTAA were also included for comparison. Fig. 2a depicts the UV-vis absorption spectra of PTAA and PFDTS. We can find that the absorption of the PTAA solution is not different from that of the PTAA film. With regard to PFDTS, the maximum absorption peak of the solution is at 430 nm, while the maximum absorption peak of the film is at 438 nm. Compared with the solution absorption spectrum of PFDTS, the film absorption spectrum of PFDTS is red-shifted, which is attributed to the π–π stacking.35 Simultaneously, we can calculate the energy gap (Eg) of the molecule based on the absorption spectra. The film absorption onsets (λonset) of PTAA and PFDTS are at 420 nm and 510 nm, respectively. According to the calculation formula (Eg = 1240/λonset), the Eg values of PTAA and PFDTS are 2.95 eV and 2.43 eV, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to estimate the HOMO level of PTAA and PFDTS. Fig. 2b shows the CV curves of PTAA and PFDTS. We can see that the onset oxidation potentials of PTAA and PFDTS are 0.32 V and 0.37 V, respectively. According to previous literature reports, the HOMO level with respect to the vacuum level (EVAC) of PTAA is −5.20 eV, so the HOMO level of PFDTS is −5.25 eV. Furthermore, the Eg of PTAA and PFDTS are 2.95 eV and 2.43 eV, so the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level values of PTAA and PFDTS are −2.25 eV and −2.82 eV, respectively.
In order to evaluate the hole transport performance, we measured the hole mobility of the two HTMs using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.36 Fig. S11† shows the curves of the square root of the current density against voltage for PTAA and PFDTS. By fitting the linear correlation of the current density and voltage, we can get a hole mobility of 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for PTAA and 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for PFDTS. PFDTS has a higher hole mobility than PTAA by 68%. It is known that the high hole mobility can effectively promote hole transfer and transportation in the PSCs, thus reducing charge accumulation at the HTL/perovskite interface.
To explore the effect of different HTLs on the work functions (WFs) of ITO, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out. Fig. 2c shows the UPS curves of ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS. As shown in Fig. 2c, the cut-off energy (Ecut-off) of ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS is 16.51 eV, 16.42 eV and 16.32 eV, respectively. According to the equation WF = 21.21 eV − Ecut-off, the calculated WF values with respect to the EVAC of ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS are 4.71 eV, 4.80 eV and 4.90 eV, respectively. The results demonstrate that the WF is increased after the deposition of the HTL, and PFDTS has a bigger effect than PTAA on the WF. The increment of the WF is conducive to enhancing the VOC.15 In this respect, PFDTS is more suitable than PTAA as a HTL for inverted PSCs. Fig. 2d depicts the energy level diagram of the complete device. In terms of the HOMO level of PTAA and PFDTS, they are both suitable as HTLs. However, the HOMO level of PFDTS is closer to the valence band of perovskite than that of PTAA, signifying less energy loss during the carrier transport process, thereby improving the VOC of the device.37 The LUMO energy level (−2.82 eV) of PFDTS is lower than that (−2.25 eV) of PTAA (Fig. 2d), representing a smaller electron-blocking barrier for the former. Nevertheless, both PTAA and PFDTS have sufficient electron blocking ability, because their LUMO levels are both sufficiently higher than the conduction band level (−4.0 eV) of the perovskite.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to verify whether there is an interaction at the interface. Fig. S12† shows the survey XPS spectra of the bare ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS samples. Fig. 3a shows the high-resolution In 3d core-level spectra of ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, the In 3d3/2 peak and 3d5/2 peak of bare ITO are situated at 453.4 eV and 445.9 eV, the In 3d3/2 peak and 3d5/2 peak of ITO/PTAA are also situated at 453.4 eV and 445.9 eV, and the In 3d3/2 peak and 3d5/2 peak of ITO/PFDTS are situated at 453.0 eV and 445.5 eV, respectively. The results show that the In 3d peaks don't shift after PTAA is coated on ITO, while the In 3d peaks shift to lower binding energies by 0.4 eV after PFDTS is coated on ITO. For ITO/PTAA, the results reveal that there is no interaction between ITO and PTAA, or the interaction is too weak to cause shifts of peaks. However, the shifts of peaks of ITO/PFDTS indicate that there is an interaction between ITO and PFDTS. The interaction between PFDTS and In of ITO causes electron donation from PFDTS to the In atoms of ITO, therefore the In 3d peaks shift to lower binding energies.38 The high-resolution Sn 3d core-level spectra of ITO, ITO/PTAA and ITO/PFDTS are shown in Fig. 3b. The Sn 3d3/2 peak and 3d5/2 peak are situated at 495.3 eV and 486.8 eV for bare ITO, at 495.2 eV and 486.7 eV for ITO/PTAA, and at 494.6 eV and 486.1 eV for ITO/PFDTS, respectively. The Sn 3d peaks hardly shift for ITO/PTAA, suggesting that there is no interaction between Sn atoms in ITO and PTAA. By contrast, PFDTS interacts with Sn atoms in ITO, as judged from the obvious shifts of Sn 3d peaks upon adsorption of PFDTS onto the ITO surface.

Since both O and S atoms in PFDTS may interact with metal ions in ITO, we need to adopt XPS to determine what kind of groups or atoms participate in this interaction. Fig. 3c depicts the high-resolution O 1s core-level spectra of ITO, PFDTS and ITO/PFDTS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, the O 1s peak of bare ITO is decomposed into 2 peaks, which are respectively assigned to Sn–O at 531.0 eV and In–O at 529.5 eV.32 The O 1s peak of pristine PFDTS is also decomposed into 2 peaks, which are respectively assigned to CO at 532.5 eV and H–O at 530.3 eV. The ITO/PFDTS film exhibits four O 1s peaks, which are respectively assigned to CO at 532.1 eV, Sn–O at 531.1 eV, H–O at 530.3 eV and In–O at 529.6 eV. The O 1s peaks in Sn–O, In–O and H–O hardly change considering the 0.1 eV resolution of XPS, while there is a significant shift of O 1s for CO. These results indicate that the carboxyl groups in PFDTS can interact with In and Sn in ITO. As electrons shift from the O atoms of the carboxyl group in PFDTS to the Sn and In atoms, the electron density of the O atoms in the carboxyl group decreases, which moves the O 1s peak to a lower energy.
We can also get some useful information from the high-resolution S 2p core-level spectra of ITO, PFDTS and ITO/PFDTS. Fig. 3d depicts the high-resolution S 2p core-level spectra of ITO, PFDTS and ITO/PFDTS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, the bare ITO has no S 2p peak. The S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks of pristine PFDTS are located at 165.0 eV and 163.8 eV, and the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks of ITO/PFDTS are also located at 165.0 eV and 163.8 eV, respectively. No shifts of the S 2p peaks reveal that there is no or very weak interaction between ITO and S atoms in PFDTS. In summary, the interaction between PFDTS and ITO arises from the coordination of the O atoms of the carboxyl group in PFDTS with the In and Sn atoms in ITO.
The O and S atoms in PFDTS may also interact with the Pb ions in perovskite at the PFDTS/perovskite interface. Thus, we adopted Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the PFDTS + PbI2 mixture to confirm whether there is an interaction between PFDTS and perovskite. Fig. 4a shows the FTIR spectra of PbI2, PTAA and PTAA + PbI2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the stretching vibration peaks of CC and C–N bonds for the pristine PTAA are observed at 1600 cm−1 and 1414 cm−1, respectively. The bending vibration peaks of C–H bonds for the pristine PTAA are observed at 1360 cm−1 and 1340 cm−1. When PTAA is mixed with PbI2, there are no obvious shifts of these characteristic vibration peaks. The results reveal that there is no or very weak interaction between PTAA and perovskite.

(d) TRPL decay curves of the pristine perovskite film, the PTAA/perovskite film and the PFDTS/perovskite film, respectively. 

Fig. 4b depicts that the stretching vibration peaks of CO and CC bonds for the pristine PFDTS are respectively at 1707 cm−1 and 1612 cm−1. The bending vibration peaks of C–H bonds for the pristine PFDTS are observed at 1308 cm−1 and 1278 cm−1. When PFDTS is mixed with PbI2, the stretching vibration peaks of CC bonds and bending vibration peaks of C–H bonds exhibit no shifts, while the stretching vibration peak of CO bonds shifts from 1707 cm−1 to 1700 cm−1. This demonstrates that the carboxyl group can form a significant coordination interaction with Pb. The interaction makes the CO bond length longer and the bond energy lower. Therefore, the CO vibration frequency is reduced and the vibration peak shifts to a lower wavenumber.39
We conducted the steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements to study the hole extraction and charge transfer process. Fig. 4c depicts the PL spectra of the pristine perovskite, the PTAA/perovskite, and the PFDTS/perovskite films, respectively. The PL peaks of the three films are all located at 800 nm, indicating that the underlying HTL does not influence the PL peak position. Compared with the pristine perovskite film, the PL peak intensity of the perovskite film deposited on PTAA is reduced, and the intensity is 71% of the initial intensity. When perovskite is deposited on PFDTS, the PL peak intensity of the film is 46% of the initial intensity. The results demonstrate that the PL peak intensity of the PFDTS/perovskite film is much lower than that of the PTAA/perovskite film, which reveals that the hole extraction ability of PFDTS is better than that of PTAA.40,41

Fig. 4d shows the TRPL decay curves of the pristine perovskite film, the film of PTAA/perovskite and the film of PFDTS/perovskite, respectively. The time constants of τ1 and τ2 can be determined using the reported model.42 The detailed lifetime and corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The average lifetime (τave) of the pristine perovskite film is 371.1 ns, and the corresponding proportion (A1) of τ1 is 32.8%. These data indicate that the radiation recombination caused by traps occupies the main part. As for the perovskite films deposited on PTAA or PFDTS, these τave are 176.2 ns and 60.3 ns, and the corresponding A1 values are 41.3% and 52.5%, respectively. These TRPL results indicate that the HTL can effectively extract holes from the active layer and that the hole extraction ability of PFDTS is better than that of PTAA, which is consistent with the conclusion derived from the steady PL data.
In addition, the film morphology is also one of the important factors affecting the device performance. Therefore, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was adopted to study the morphology of HTLs and perovskite films. Fig. S13a and S13b† show the morphology of PTAA and PFDTS films, respectively. We can see that both PTAA and PFDTS films are fully covered, which can avoid direct contact between perovskite and ITO. Furthermore, the morphology of perovskite films deposited on different HTLs was also measured. As shown in Fig. S13c,† the PTAA/perovskite film shows a lot of pinholes, and the grain size is very uneven. By contrast, the PFDTS/perovskite film is uniform, compact and pinhole-free (Fig. S13d†). In order to intuitively present the morphology variation between the two perovskite films on different HTLs, we have calculated the distribution of perovskite grain sizes, as shown in Fig. S13e and S13f.† The grain size of the perovskite film deposited on PTAA is in the range of 200–300 nm, while that of the perovskite film deposited on PFDTS is in the range of 300–400 nm. The grain size of the perovskite film based on PFDTS is larger than that of PTAA.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to study the surface roughness of the film (Fig. S14†). The results show that the root-mean-square (RMS) is 1.25 nm for the PTAA film (Fig. S14a†) and 1.33 nm for the PFDTS film (Fig. S14b†). This demonstrates that both PTAA and PFDTS films are smooth. The RMS of the perovskite film is 13.12 nm on the PTAA layer (Fig. S14c†) and 11.43 nm on the PFDTS layer (Fig. S14d†). It is evident that a smoother perovskite film can be formed on the PFDTS layer than on the PTAA one.
The SEM and AFM morphology results indicate that high-quality perovskite films can be formed on the PFDTS HTL, while poor-quality perovskite films are obtained on the PTAA layer. This insinuates that perovskite will have better crystallinity on PFDTS than on PTAA.
We then carried out the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to study the crystallization of perovskite films. Fig. S15a† depicts the XRD spectra of perovskite films deposited on PTAA and PFDTS, respectively. We can find that both types of films can form perovskite crystals,43 but the XRD spectrum of the PTAA/perovskite film shows the PbI2 peak, which is not observed for the PFDTS/perovskite film. It is reported that the presence of PbI2 will degrade the device performance,44 and therefore the latter will be more stable than the former. As discussed earlier, the perovskite precursor solution cannot spread out well on the PTAA layer, which may lead to incomplete conversion of the PbI2–DMSO intermediate44 to perovskite, and thus a small amount of PbI2 exists in the perovskite film deposited on the PTAA layer. The essential reason for the generation of the PbI2 residue in the perovskite film based on PTAA is unknown so far, which is nevertheless not the focus of this work. Fig. S15b† depicts the XRD spectra of the magnified view of crystal planes of (110) and (310), where the PFDTS/perovskite film gives a higher peak intensity but a smaller full width at half maximum than the PTAA/perovskite film. These results verify that the perovskite film can crystallize better on PFDTS than on PTAA.
Furthermore, the SCLC method was adopted to quantitatively analyze the trap density. Fig. S16† depicts the SCLC curves of perovskite films on different HTLs. A linear correlation appearing at the low bias voltage reveals an ohmic-type response. As the bias voltage increases, the linear correlation changes immediately at a certain point (called a kink point, marked with an arrow in Fig. S16,† which is defined as the trap filling limit voltage, VTFL), at which the traps are completely filled.45 The VTFL based on PTAA and PFDTS is determined to be 0.55 V and 0.43 V, which corresponds to a trap density of 3.63 × 1016 cm−3 and 2.84 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. Therefore, the PFDTS based device has a lower trap density than the PTAA based one. The SCLC results can be well explained by the perovskite film morphology and crystallinity discussed above.
In order to compare the performance of the two HTLs in inverted MA-free PSCs, the inverted architecture of ITO/HTL/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag was adopted, where PCBM is 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester and BCP is bathocuproine. The cross-sectional SEM image of the complete device is shown in Fig. S17,† from which the thicknesses of the HTL, perovskite, PCBM/BCP and Ag are determined to be about 5 nm, 400 nm, 40 nm and 80 nm, respectively.
PFDTS can be well dissolved in methanol but is almost insoluble in the perovskite precursor solvent (DMF:DMSO = 3:1, volume ratio), which assures that the HTM exhibits resistance to the perovskite precursor solvent. The resistance of the PFDTS film against the processing solvent of the perovskite layer is further determined by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PFDTS film before and after the spin coating of the perovskite precursor solvent on it. As shown in Fig. S18a,† the UV-vis absorption of the PFDTS film hardly changed after the spin coating of the perovskite precursor solvent. Therefore, the PFDTS film exhibits sufficient resistance to the perovskite precursor solvent, which cannot wash away the PFDTS film during the processing of the perovskite layer.
First, we spin-coated PFDTS with different concentrations on the ITO substrates to optimize the concentration of PFDTS. Fig. S18b† shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs fabricated at various concentrations of PFDTS, and the performance parameters are listed in Table S2.† As can be seen from Table S2,† the photovoltaic performance depends on the PFDTS concentration. The JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE increase with increasing the PFDTS concentration from 0.5 mg cm−3 to 1 mg cm−3, and then decrease gradually with further increasing the PFDTS concentration (Table S2†). The optimal concentration of PFDTS is determined to be 1 mg cm−3. The lower PFDTS concentration leads to a discontinuous film, as shown in the SEM image (Fig. S19†), resulting in lower a VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE. The higher PFDTS concentration may lead to a larger series resistance, which also diminishes the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE.

Fig. 5a shows the optimal J–V curves of inverted MA-free PSCs based on different HTLs with different scanning directions. The optimal PTAA-based device exhibits a PCE of 18.25% with a VOC of 1.059 V, a JSC of 23.26 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.1%, while the optimal PFDTS-based device exhibits a PCE of 20.15% with a VOC of 1.082 V, a JSC of 24.03 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.5%. Compared with the PTAA-based device, a 10% enhancement of PCE is obtained for the PFDTS-based device. The improvement of PCE is due to the increase in VOC, JSC and FF. The enhancement of VOC is mainly due to the lower HOMO energy level of PFDTS and increased WF of ITO, which reduces the energy loss of carrier transport at the interface.37 The enhancement of the FF is mainly attributed to the compact perovskite film formed on PFDTS, which has a lower trap density and lower charge recombination.45 The enhanced hole extraction and retarded charge recombination are responsible for the improved JSC from PTAA to PFDTS. Moreover, there is a negligible hysteresis for the two devices, and the detailed photovoltaic parameter values are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 5b depicts the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves and integrated photocurrent (JEQE) curves of the PTAA-based and PFDTS-based devices. The EQE curve of PFDTS is higher than that of PTAA in the 400–750 nm range, and the former exhibits an ∼90% EQE in the region of 450–650 nm. The integrated JEQE calculated from the full EQE spectrum is 22.86 and 23.91 mA cm−2 for the PTAA-based and PFDTS-based devices, respectively, which are in line with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves measured under simulated solar light.
In order to verify the reproducibility of the corresponding devices, we randomly collected 20 independent devices, and the statistical values of the device parameters are respectively shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S20.† As expected, the photovoltaic parameter values of the two devices exhibit normal distributions with small standard deviations, which demonstrates excellent reproducibility for the two PSC devices.
To further confirm the reliability of the obtained photovoltaic parameter values from the J–V curves, steady-state photocurrent and PCE output measurements at the maximum power point (0.83 V for the PTAA-based device and 0.88 V for the PFDTS-based device) were performed. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the PTAA-based device obtains a steady-state photocurrent density of 21.61 mA cm−2 and a steady-state PCE of 17.92% after 100 s of continuous illumination. The PFDTS-based device obtains a steady-state photocurrent density of 22.34 mA cm−2 and a steady-state PCE of 19.66% after 100 s of continuous illumination. The steady-state output photocurrent and PCE of the PFDTS based device are respectively higher than those of the PTAA-based device. The results indicate that the photovoltaic parameter values obtained from the J–V curves are trustworthy.
In addition to the reasons described above, charge recombination will also affect the performance of the device. In order to study the charge recombination mechanism, we measured the dependence of the VOC as a function of the incident light intensity (I). Fig. S21a† depicts that the VOC changes linearly with the logarithm of I. Prior research studies have indicated that the slope being closer to kT/q represents that the bimolecular recombination is dominant. When the slope is closer to 2kT/q, the monomolecular recombination caused by traps is dominant.46 The slope of the PTAA-based device is 1.62kT/q, and the slope of the PFDTS-based device is 1.38kT/q. Therefore, the bimolecular recombination is dominant in the PFDTS-based device, while the monomolecular recombination caused by traps is dominant in the PTAA-based device. The results predict that the PFDTS-based device may exhibit lower trap-assisted charge recombination than the PTAA-based device.
In order to further study the charge recombination of PSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out. Fig. S21b† shows the EIS Nyquist curves of the PTAA- and PFDTS-based PSCs, in which the magnified curve in the high-frequency region and the equivalent circuit are inserted. Only one arc, attributed to the charge recombination, is observed for both devices. The intercept of the right side of the arc denotes the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).47 The intercept of the left side of the arc (see the inset of Fig. S21b†) is the series resistance (Rs). These resistances can be obtained by fitting the EIS curves with the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. S21b†). The PFDTS-based device gives a smaller Rs (43.6 Ω vs. 52.8 Ω) but a bigger Rrec (6338 Ω vs. 5727 Ω) than the PTAA-based cell. The smaller Rs is beneficial to obtain a higher FF, and the larger Rrec is conducive to resisting charge recombination, which can hence improve the VOC and JSC.
In addition to PCE, stability is also an important factor restricting the long-term application of devices. Therefore, we measured the stabilities of the PTAA-based and PFDTS-based unencapsulated devices under different conditions. Fig. 6 shows the PCE curves versus time of PTAA-based and PFDTS-based devices. As shown in Fig. 6a, after storing under the ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 20–30% and a temperature of 20–30 °C for 1000 h, the PFDTS-based device maintains 90.7% of the initial efficiency, while the PTAA-based device only maintains 74.8% of the initial efficiency. Besides the environmental stability, we also measured the thermal stability of devices under continuous heating at 85 °C in nitrogen with indoor natural light. As shown in Fig. 6b, after continuous heating at 85 °C for 500 h, the PFDTS-based device retains 80.1% of the original efficiency, while the PTAA-based device only retains 65.9% of the original efficiency. It is therefore concluded that the PFDTS-based PSC not only has better environmental stability, but also has better thermal stability than the PTAA-based PSC. Compared to the PTAA-based device, the enhanced stability of the PFDTS-based device is ascribed to the more compact perovskite film and the lower trap density as well, which can effectively prevent the corrosion from water and oxygen, and hence retard the degradation of perovskite.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized a dopant-free HTM called PFDTS for inverted MA-free PSCs. Compared with the commercial PTAA, PFDTS has a more suitable energy level and higher hole mobility, which makes it a promising candidate for excellent HTMs in inverted PSCs. It is found that there exist interactions between PFDTS and ITO, which increases the WF of ITO. We also find that there are interactions between PFDTS and perovskite, which makes the perovskite precursor spread over the HTL better and high-quality perovskite films with a low trap density can be achieved. Last but not least, PFDTS shows larger hole mobility, and higher hole extraction ability than PTAA, and the former device demonstrates lower charge recombination than the latter one. This series of advantages enable PFDTS-based PSC devices to obtain a PCE of 20.15% against 18.25% for the PTAA-based PSC. Furthermore, the air stability and thermal stability of the PSC devices are also improved significantly when the PTAA HTL is replaced with the PFDTS HTL. After storing under the ambient conditions for 1000 h, the PCE decay of the PFDTS-based device is less than 10%. The PCE attenuation of the PFDTS-based device is less than 20% after continuous heating at 85 °C for 500 h. Therefore, PFDTS is a competitive HTM for inverted PSCs.
