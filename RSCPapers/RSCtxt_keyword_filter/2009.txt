    , Accepted 24th January 2016First published on 25th January 2016AbstractTwo novel donor–acceptor (D–A) type random conjugated terpolymers PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP were synthesized by copolymerizing electron-rich alkylthienyl benzodithiophene (BDTT) and two different electron-deficient units, in which phenanthrophenazine (PPz) was the first acceptor unit, and isoindigo (IID) or diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with a strong electron-withdrawing ability was the second acceptor unit, respectively. Compared to their parent polymer PTTPPz-BDTT, a broadening of the band in the long wavelength region from 500 to 850 nm and a significant decrease in HOMO levels were observed for the random terpolymers. Ca and PFN-Br were used as interfacial layers to optimize the devices, respectively. Pleasingly, after replacing Ca/Al with PFN-Br/Al as the cathode, the performance of both polymer devices improved greatly. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.91% was obtained with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8% in the PBDTT-PPzDPP/PC71BM-based device, while the PBDTT-PPzIID/PC71BM-based device achieved a PCE of 4.21%. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest recorded FF values among PSCs based on previously reported phenazine copolymers.
1. Introduction
As a promising sustainable energy source technology for the future, organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) comprising conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their various advantages, including low cost, light weight, solution processability and the potential for the fabrication of large-area flexible devices, which lead to the realization of next-generation renewable energy sources.1–4 Over the past few years, to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, numerous efforts have focused on developing new solution processable donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with narrow optical band gaps and high absorption coefficients in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) region resulting from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction, leading to steady increases in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs.5–9 Especially, due to synergistic effects through the optimization of donor polymer band gaps, energy levels, mobilities and device construction, the PCE for both single and multi-junction PSCs has been driven to achieve more than 10%.10–13
In the search for high performance PSCs, more recently, a variety of high performance D–A polymers based on 7,8-dithienyl benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT)10,14–19 used as electron donor (D) units and phenazine (Pz) derivatives20–26 as acceptor (A) units in PSCs have been developed. This is mainly due to their relatively large and planar conjugated structure that is favorable for π–π stacking, improvement in carrier transportation, and absorption in long wavelengths. For instance, the highest recorded PCEs of 10.2% and 11.3% were obtained in the BDTT polymer PBDT-TS1 based single device by Hou's group10 and the PTB7-Th based tandem device by Heeger's group,27 respectively. For another example, a polymer of PTTPPz-BDTT based BDTT was recently reported by our group, which exhibits a high charge mobility, and a low highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy level.25 Moreover, a maximum PCE of 6.56% was also reported in the Pz polymer of the PIDT-PhanQ based device by Jen's group.26 Meanwhile, isoindigo (IID)28–31 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)32–35 have been flourishing as acceptor moieties in D–A copolymers for applications in PSCs due to some of their advantages, such as a strong electron-withdrawing capacity, low HOMO levels, and broad absorption spectra.30–36 So far, the record PCEs of 9.1% and 9.4% have been obtained for the TBTIT polymer based on the thieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene isoindigo (TBTI) unit and for the PDPP2T-TT polymer based on the DPP unit in their PSCs,35,36 respectively. Obviously, among the D–A type conjugated polymers, the major breakthrough for the rapid enhancement of PCE is attributed mainly to the exploitation of novel conjugated polymers. However, due to the difficulty of developing novel D and A units, only a limited number of new backbone units for D–A copolymers have been successful in achieving high PCE values.10–13
To overcome the limitations of the D–A copolymer approach, a new strategy for the design of molecular structure is required that can fully exploit the reported D and A units and that can delicately tune the properties of the copolymers. From this perspective, terpolymers, which consist of three different units in the polymer backbone, are promising candidates as they can exhibit synergetic effects of each unit by tuning the composition ratio, thereby enabling good solubility, full-range absorption, a deep HOMO level and high charge mobility.37–47 More recently, several research studies of terpolymers have already shown high efficiencies, exceeding 7–8%, and demonstrated their great potential as alternative donors for highly efficient PSCs.42–45 For instance, a maximum PCE of 8.71% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 18.14 mA cm−2 was achieved in PSCs by Huang's group,44 and another kind of terpolymer with a PCE of over 8.5% in PSCs was reported by Hsu's group.45
Inspired by the aforementioned research studies, two novel D–A type random conjugated terpolymers were synthesized and are shown in Scheme 1. We expected that the introduction of a second acceptor of IID and/or DPP units with a strong electron-withdrawing ability into the BDTT-alt-PPz polymer backbone can tune their HOMO energy level and broaden their absorption spectra, which exhibit full-range absorption of visible light, thereby, providing high-efficiency BHJ PSCs. The results indicated that both the terpolymers exhibited obviously broadened absorption spectra in the region of 300–850 nm, as well as deep lying HOMO energy levels (−5.38 and −5.45 eV). When using a Ca/Al cathode, PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP devices showed PCEs of 3.24% and 4.51%, respectively. After replacing Ca/Al with a PFN/Al cathode, the performance of both PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP devices enhanced largely. PSCs based on the PBDTT-PPzDPP/PC71BM blend provided a promising PCE of 5.91% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.8%, which is one of the highest recorded FF among phenazine polymer-based PSCs to the best of our knowledge.

2.1. Materials
Monomers 2,5-bis(trimethyltin)-7,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT-Sn2Me6), (E)-6-bromo-3-(6-bromo-1-(2-hexyldecyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-1-(2-hexyldecyl)indolin-2-one (IID-Br2) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP-Br2) were purchased directly from the Suna Tech Inc. The other reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Acros, TCI) and used without further purification. Compounds 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and pyrene-4,5-dione (3) were synthesized according to the literature.25,48 The detailed syntheses of monomers 10,13-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-11, 12-bis(octyloxy)phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine (TTPPz-Br2) and both the terpolymers are presented following the procedures described herein.
2.2. Characterization
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 240 instrument. The molecular weights were determined using a Waters Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) 2410 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) via a calibration curve of polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted under a dry nitrogen gas flow at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 on a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP-8453 UV visible system. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were carried out on a CHI660A electrochemical work station with a three electrode electrochemical cell in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) acetonitrile solution with a scan 100 mV s−1 at room temperature (RT) under an argon atmosphere. In this three-electrode cell, a platinum rod, a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The surface morphology of the terpolymer/PC71BM blend film was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco, DI multimode NS-3D apparatus in the tapping mode under normal air conditions at RT with a 5 μm scanner. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.
2.3. Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
The PSCs were fabricated using indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as the anode, Ca/Al or poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-methylammoinium-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Al as the cathode, and terpolymer/PCBM blend films as the photosensitive layer. After a 35 nm buffer layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the precleaned ITO substrate, the photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a solution of the terpolymer/PC71BM (w/w) in chlorobenzene (CB) or a mixed solvent of CB and chloroform (CHCl3) on the PEDOT:PSS layer. The current–voltage (I–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source measurement system. A solar simulator was used as the light source and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. The device area was 0.09 cm2. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded by a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200, Tencor Instruments). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 150 W xenon lamp.
2.4. Synthesis of the monomers and terpolymers

2.4.1. Synthesis of monomer TTPPz-Br2. 
Compound 1 (0.71 g, 1.00 mmol) and zinc powder (0.78 g, 12.00 mmol) were mixed with acetic acid (HOAc, 100 mL), and stirred for 2 h at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to RT, the mixture was filtered, and washed with HOAc. The organic phase containing compound 2 of 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-4,5-bis(octyloxy)benzene-1,2-diamine, was obtained and directly used in the next step. The organic phase was added to HOAc (100 mL) and compound 3 (0.23 g, 1.00 mmol). The mixture was refluxed under stirring for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to RT and quenching with water, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM, 30 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and distilled to remove the solvent. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a mixed solvent of petroleum ether (PE)-DCM (V/V, 4/1) as the eluent to obtain compound TTPPz-Br2 as an orange solid (0.69 g, 78.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 9.50 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 8.27 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 8.11 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 8.02 (s, 4H), 7.28 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 4.12 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 1.87 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 4H), 1.53–1.26 (m, 20H), 0.92–0.91 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 152.66, 140.83, 137.00, 135.26, 131.21, 130.78, 128.91, 128.83, 128.50, 126.72, 126.42, 125.58, 124.69, 123.11, 115.84, 74.16, 31.95, 30.61, 29.61, 29.40, 26.21, 22.77, 14.18.

After cooling to RT, the mixture was poured into acetone (100 mL) and precipitation occurred. It was collected by filtration and successively extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with diethyl ether and CHCl3 each for 12 h, respectively. The collected CHCl3 solution was concentrated and precipitated with acetone to obtain a dark solid (144 mg, 85.7%). Anal. Calcd for C162H200N4O4S10: C, 75.18; H, 7.79; N, 2.16; S, 12.39.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes for both terpolymers of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP are outlined in Scheme 1. Both the terpolymers were synthesized at 100 °C by palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization with a high yield of more than 80%. The actual molecular composition of these terpolymers was determined by elemental analysis. The results showed that the BDTT/PPz/IID (or DPP) ratio was 2/1/1 in these terpolymers, and consistent with the molar feed ratio of BDTT/PPz/IID (or DPP). The molecular weights of these terpolymers were determined by GPC and the related data are listed in Table 1. The resulting number average molecular weights (Mn) of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP are 46.3 kDa (PDI = 1.87) and 49.7 kDa (PDI = 1.92), respectively. Both polymers were found to be poorly soluble in most of the organic solvents such as CHCl3, THF, chlorobenzene (CB), and only slightly soluble in ODCB at RT. We used TGA to determine the thermal properties of the terpolymers (Fig. 1). Under an inert atmosphere, the 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP were 330 °C and 345 °C, respectively, and their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, they all exhibited good thermal stability, suggesting that they could be good candidates for device fabrication and application.

3.2. Optical properties
The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of both the terpolymers and their parent polymer PTTPPz-BDTT in dilute CHCl3 solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2, and their detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. Two typical absorption bands are observed in the range of 340–850 nm for both the terpolymers, a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units: one at 340–500 nm, which we assigned to localized π–π* transition and the other, a broader band in the long wavelength region, from 500 to 850 nm corresponding to the ICT between the donor BDTT units and acceptor PPz or DPP units. Interestingly, while a second acceptor unit of DPP and/or IID with a strong electron-withdrawing ability was grafted into the parent polymer PTTPPz-BDTT,25 the red-shift absorption spectra were observed in solution and thin films. Compared with the absorption spectra of PTTPPz-BDTT in the film,25 the terpolymers displayed additional shoulder peaks at 675 and 732 nm in addition to the red-shifted high energy peak of 640 and 677 nm for PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP, respectively, implying that the terpolymers possessed a strong intermolecular packing potential in the solid state.46 Based on the onset (792 and 867 nm) of the film absorption, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP were calculated as 1.56 and 1.43 eV, respectively. Obviously, compared to PTTPPz-BDTT (1.59 eV),25 the extended absorption edge was attributed to the introduction of the second acceptor units IID and DPP with an excellent flat performance and a strong electron-withdrawing capacity to promote the intramolecular D–A effect and the intermolecular stacking interaction, which is beneficial for the random copolymers as they would absorb more of the solar spectrum.

3.3. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the terpolymers by using an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference and the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the calibrated standard. Fig. 3 shows the recorded CV curves of the terpolymers and their parent polymer PTTPPz-BDTT, and their corresponding CV data are listed in Table 2. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) were observed to be 1.10 V for PBDTT-PPzIID, and 1.03 V for PBDTT-PPzDPP. The HOMO energy levels of terpolymers can be calculated according to the empirical equations:8EHOMO = − (Eox − 0.45) − 4.8 eV. As a result, the HOMO levels (EHOMO) are estimated to be −5.45 and −5.38 eV for PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP, respectively. Compared to PTTPPz-BDTT,25 a significant decrease in HOMO levels was observed due to the insertion of the second acceptor units of IID or DPP with a strong electron-withdrawing ability. The relatively deeper HOMO levels could be expected to afford a higher Voc in PSC applications, which is one of the main contributors to achieve high efficiency PSCs.

3.4. Hole mobility
To further understand the effect of different second acceptor units on the photovoltaic performance of terpolymer based PSC devices, the hole mobilities (μh) of these photoactive layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method in hole devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/MnO3/Au at the optimized conditions. The SCLC could be estimated using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμh(V2/L3),49 where, J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of terpolymers, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), L is the thickness of the blended film layer (90 nm for PBDTT-PPzIID and 93 nm for PBDTT-PPzDPP), V = Vappl − Vbi, V is the effective voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage, and Vbi is the built-in voltage that results from the work function difference between the anode and the cathode. Fig. 4 displays the J–V curves of these hole devices. As summarized in Table 3, the μh of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP was calculated to be 8.4 × 10−5 and 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the hole-only terpolymer/PC71BM-based devices, respectively. Notably, compared to PTTPPz-BDTT,25 the μh of PBDTT-PPzDPP shows a slight increase, which implies that the relatively higher Jsc and FF could be obtained in the PSCs.

3.5. Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP, the BHJ-PSCs were first fabricated and evaluated with a typical device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The photovoltaic performances of PSCs were strongly influenced by some processing parameters, such as the solvent selection, the D/A (terpolymer/PC71BM, w/w) blend ratio, the annealing temperature, the spin-coating rates, the usage of processing additives, and these processing parameters were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic performance of devices with a Ca interlayer (see the ESI†). Fig. S1–S5† depict the J–V characteristics of terpolymer/PC71BM-based devices at different blend ratios, DIO additive concentrations, spin-coating rates, CB/CHCl3 ratios, and annealing temperatures, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1–S5,† respectively. The optimized D/A ratios were found to be 1/3 for PBDTT-PPzIID with a low PCE of 1.45%, and 1/2 for PBDTT-PPzDPP with a low PCE of 1.51%, respectively. In order to optimize the morphology of the blend films and thus to improve the device properties, 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive for the terpolymer based devices. With the addition of DIO, we found that the terpolymer based devices have a significantly improved Jsc from 4.19 to 7.14 mA cm−2 for PBDTT-PPzIID (PCE of 2.66%) and from 4.34 to 6.93 mA cm−2 for PBDTT-PPzDPP (PCE of 2.85%), but have no effect on the Voc. Furthermore, we also optimized the spin coating rate of the device, which directly affects the film thickness of the active layer. Herein, the terpolymer based devices have the same optimized spin-coating rate of 2250 rpm. Under the optimized spin-coating rate, the terpolymer based devices showed an increased FF from 48.9% to 55.0% for PBDTT-PPzIID (PCE of 3.12%) and the Jsc increased from 6.93 to 10.0 mA cm−2 for PBDTT-PPzDPP (PCE of 4.18%). Moreover, the effects of a mixed solvent on the terpolymer based devices were also tested. The results show that the PBDTT-PPzIID based devices exhibit an attenuated photovoltaic performance along with the addition of CHCl3, in contrast, the PBDTT-PPzDPP based device exhibits an increase in the photovoltaic performance when the CB/CF volume ratio is 9/1. After that, the conditions of thermal annealing were also investigated. The results show that the PBDTT-PPzIID based devices have a slight increase in the photovoltaic performance (the PCE from 3.12% to 3.24%) at an annealing temperature of 80 °C, while the PBDTT-PPzDPP based device shows an attenuated photovoltaic performance after the thermal annealing treatment.
The active layers were finally spin-coated from a concentration of 25 mg mL−1, while the PFN-Br interlayer was spin-coated from its methanol solution. All PSCs were tested under simulated illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 5, and the data of photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Compared to the devices with a Ca interlayer, the devices with a PFN-Br interlayer exhibited an accelerated photovoltaic performance, which is attributed to the fact that the PFN interfacial layer could largely elevate the photovoltaic performance of a group of N-heterocycle-containing polymer donors.50 The terpolymer/PC71BM-based optimum devices exhibited a higher Voc compared with the PTTPPz-BDTT-based device,25 which could be attributed to the lower-lying HOMO level of these terpolymers. As shown in Fig. 5, the typical devices exhibited typical J–V characteristics under these optimized conditions. Device parameters, such as Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE, were deduced from the J–V characteristics. Compared with PTTPPz-BDTT in the PSCs,25 the PBDTT-PPzDPP-based device showed a significant increase in the FF from 62.5% to 68.8% and in the Jsc from 11.10 to 11.75 mA cm−2. The higher charge mobility was responsible for the higher FF, and the strong photon response was responsible for the higher Jsc value of PBDTT-PPzDPP. As a result, a maximal PCE of up to 5.91% was obtained with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8% in the PBDTT-PPzDPP/PC71BM-based device. For all we know, compared to the previously reported phenazine copolymeric derivatives,20–26 this is one of the highest FF values recorded for BHJ-PSCs.

To understand why the PBDTT-PPzDPP/PC71BM based device displayed higher Jsc and PCE values, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of devices under the optimized conditions were also measured. As depicted in Fig. 6, the terpolymer/PC71BM based devices showed a very efficient photo-response in a broad range from ca. 300 to 780 and 830 nm, corresponding to a high EQE over 25% in a broad range from ca. 320 to 720 and 750 nm is observed for PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP based devices, respectively. The maximum EQE plateau of PBDTT-PPzDPP reached 73% at 422 nm, which was higher than that of PBDTT-PPzIID (50% at 486 nm), resulting in more efficient light harvesting and higher Jsc values as well. Obviously, the better optical response and higher carrier mobility guarantee the PBDTT-PPzDPP device to achieve a larger Jsc value. As a result, in accordance with the EQE curves and the solar irradiation spectrum, the integral Jsc values were calculated to be 8.54 and 12.13 mA cm−2 for PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP based devices, respectively, which are coincident with the measured Jsc values within a 4% error.

3.6. Film morphology
The surface and internal morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM height (a and d) and phase (b and e) images are shown in Fig. 7. Obviously, the blend films of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP showed different morphological properties. The root mean square (RMS) roughnesses were 1.56 and 1.41 nm for the PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP blended films, respectively. That is to say, the PBDTT-PPzIID based blend film possesses a relatively large nanoscale phase separation (Fig. 7a), which hindered the exciton dissociation and charge transportation.21Fig. 7 also shows TEM images (c and f) of the polymer/PC71BM blend films. The dark areas in the TEM images are attributed to PC71BM-rich domains, and the bright regions to the polymer-rich domains. It is clear that both the blend films show a bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating network. Compared to the PBDTT-PPzIID film, the TEM image of the PBDTT-PPzDPP film possess a well-developed fibrillar structure and a suitable fiber size, which would be beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation, and thus a higher PCE value can be harvested. Therefore, the higher PCE value for the PBDTT-PPzDPP based device was ascribed to much better morphologies and efficient charge transport properties (Fig. 4), as well as better absorption properties (Fig. 2 and 6). As a result, the PSC based on PBDTT-PPzDPP:PC71BM demonstrated a PCE of 5.91%, much higher than that of the device based on PBDTT-PPzIID:PC71BM (4.51%), under the same experimental conditions.

4. Conclusions
Two novel D–A type random terpolymers of PBDTT-PPzIID and PBDTT-PPzDPP were successfully synthesized by grafting two electron-deficient PPz and IID (and/or DPP) units into their parent PTTPPz-BDTT. Significantly improved optoelectronic properties were observed for PBDTT-PPzDPP due to the introduction of the second acceptor of the DPP unit with a strong electron-withdrawing ability in the conjugated backbone. With the introduction of the DPP unit, PBDTT-PPzDPP exhibited broad absorption and a deep lying HOMO energy level. Under optimized conditions, PBDTT-PPzDPP based PSC exhibits a promising PCE of 5.91% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.8%, which is one of the highest FFs among phenazine polymer-based PSCs. The study shows incorporating an appropriate acceptor unit into the random terpolymer as a second acceptor unit is a promising strategy to broaden the absorption and fine tune the energy level of its parent copolymer, which is critically important to maximize the PSC performance.
