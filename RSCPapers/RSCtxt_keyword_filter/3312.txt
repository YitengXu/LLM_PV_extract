    , Accepted 22nd September 2017First published on 25th September 2017AbstractA class of D–π–A dyes with rigid fused π-bridges comprising electron rich and deficient segments has been investigated by means of quantum chemical calculations. To gain a better understanding of the effects of these rigid spacers on the photophysical properties and the cell performances, the geometries, electronic structures, and absorption spectra of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes, and the relevant physical parameters in relation to the short-circuit photocurrent density and the open-circuit photovoltage are analyzed in detail to establish structure–property relationships. The calculated results indicate that the π-bridges containing both the electron-deficient moiety and electron-rich moiety could improve light-absorbing capacities, modulate the levels of frontier orbitals, facilitate intramolecular electron delocalization by decreasing the aromaticity of the π-system and destroying the coherence in possible multiple electron transfer pathways, and enhance charge injection at the dye/TiO2 interface. Such combination of molecular components with different electronic characters provides an effective approach to design novel π-bridges and shed light on the development of high-performance dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become one of the most promising strategies for solar energy conversion in the past two decades because of their advantages of low price/performance ratio, ease of fabrication, and environmental friendliness.1–3 The basic principle of DSSCs is not based on a p–n junction as in conventional solar cells but on the concept of photosensitization of a wide band-gap oxide semiconductor using a molecular sensitizer. Thus the sensitizer is probably a crucial component of a DSSC and plays a dominant role in the cell performance since it is responsible for sunlight harvesting and charge generation as well as separation. Great efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient sensitizers to boost the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs. So far, the PCEs of the well-known metal-based dyes, such as ruthenium (Ru) polypyridyl complexes and zinc porphyrin dyes, have been reported to be over 11%.4–7 However, the metal toxicity and tedious purification process of the Ru complexes, and the complicated synthetic procedures and low yields of zinc porphyrin dyes are the main obstacles that restrict their widespread application in DSSCs. Instead, metal-free organic dyes have drawn more attention in recent years because of their low-cost preparations, high molar extinction coefficients, easily tunable properties, and good flexibility in molecular tailoring.8–10 Although much progress has been made for metal-free sensitizers for DSSCs with reported PCEs over 10%,11,12 high-performance sensitizers are still in high demand and call for extensive research.
Of a variety of molecular sensitizers, the most efficient organic dyes feature donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structures, in which the combinations of D, π, and A provide great flexibility of molecular design. With this construction it is easy to regulate the absorption spectrum, adjust the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing abilities, and complete the intramolecular charge separation. Thus the optimization of the chemical structure of the sensitizer, in particular for the π-bridge, could possibly screen high performance materials. Taking the most widely used triphenylamine (TPA)13 and cyanoacrylic acid (CAA) moieties as the donor and acceptor units, respectively, various π-bridges, such as ethenyl,14 phenylene,15 vinylthiophene,16,17 thiophene derivatives,18–23 and N-annulated perylene,24,25 have been designed to develop novel sensitizers. Such extended π-conjugated bridges could efficiently enhance the absorption ability of the sensitizer, but it might cause low chemical stability of the sensitizer.26
Recently, sensitizers with fused segments comprising electron-deficient benzotriazole (BTZ), quinoxaline (QX) or benzothiadiazole (BTD) and electron-rich thiophene, or thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole entities as conjugated spacers have been synthesized for DSSCs (as shown in Fig. 1).27–30 Sensitizer 1 with BTZ as a π spacer shows a PCE of 5.67%, while sensitizers 2 and 3 with much larger fused structures exhibit gradually improved PCEs of 6.88% and 8.17%, respectively. Moreover, dyes 5 and 7 with the π-bridge based on QX and BTD also exhibit high PCEs of 6.37% and 6.86%, respectively. In comparison to a directly linked TPA–CAA dye (3.3%),14 sensitizers with different fused rigid π-spacers exhibit significantly improved PCEs. Besides the well-known functions in sunlight-harvesting as the most common π-spacers, the distinctive features of rigid fused π-bridges incorporating both electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties should be recognized and revealed at the microscopic level. The effect of the rigid spacers on the photophysical properties and the cell performances should be elucidated, and a detailed understanding of the structure–performance relationship should be established for these materials.

There is no doubt that the planar fused rigid π-spacer plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic performance of organic dyes. The π-bridge linker between the electron donor and acceptor is relatively planar rather than twisted, which can facilitate the electron migration from the donor to acceptor since the planarized π-spacer is beneficial for the delocalization of π-electrons. The rigidified fused aromatic π-spacer is expected to have small reorganization energy when the sensitizer is excited by light, and thus might improve the photochemical stability of the dye. Moreover, the aromaticity of the π-spacer could affect the electron transfer between the electron donor and acceptor, since the electrons might be constrained in a very high aromatic ring of the π-spacer and restrict electron delocalization, thus affecting intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties. Furthermore, the introduction of electron-withdrawing components QX, BTZ or BDT in the π-spacer could be helpful in adjusting the energy level and improving the stability of the device. For better understanding the effect of such planar fused rigid π-spacers on the photovoltaic performance, herein, we have carried out the theoretical calculations of the electronic structures and absorption spectra to dwell on the structure–property relationships from a physical insight. On the basis of experimental findings, we start with the investigation of BTZ-bridged dyes with the gradual increase of π systems (1, 2, and 3) to rationalize the remarkable difference in the PCEs of these dyes, and compare with QX-, NDT-, and BTD-based sensitizers (5, 6, and 7). Two novel dyes (4 and 8) are theoretically designed for the purposes of in-depth comparison and screening of more efficient sensitizers.
Quantum chemical calculations are becoming a powerful tool to study the electronic properties of dyes and screen promising candidates used in DSSCs.31–38 In this work, we intend to make a computational investigation on how rigid π-spacers with different sizes of π systems incorporating electron rich and deficient segments affect the geometrical and electronic properties of the dyes and their device performance by means of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. The aromaticities of the heterocyclic rings in the π-bridge and reorganization energies of the sensitizers upon excitation are analyzed to dissect the particularity of such rigid π-spacers. Considering the real conditions in the devices, the structures of the dyes bound to TiO2 are also simulated. Based on the reliable quantum-chemical methods, we aim to establish structure–property relationships for fused π-linker-based dyes, shed light on fundamental research, and screen promising candidates used in DSSCs.
Methods
Theoretical background of DSSCs
The PCE (η) is the most commonly used parameter to characterize the performance of a solar cell, which can be determined by the ratio of electrical energy output from the solar cell (Pout) to incident solar power (Pin):35,39 (1)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, and FF is the fill factor, a non-dimensional cell parameter that reflects the extent of electrical (ohmic) and electrochemical (overvoltage) losses occurring during the operation of the DSSC. Thus in order to improve the η of a dye cell, one should increase Jsc and Voc as much as possible.

J
sc can be expressed by integrating across all the relevant wavelengths:31,34,40 (2)where e is the elementary charge, I0(λ) is the solar spectral irradiance at a wavelength λ, ΦLHE is the light harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and Φc is the charge collection efficiency. The Φc is closely related to the charge recombination and diffusion processes, and cannot reach its ideal value of 1. Since Jsc is the integral over the solar spectrum, the absorption spectra of the dyes in the visible–near-IR range should overlap significantly with the solar spectrum. At a certain wavelength λ, ΦLHE(λ) = 1–10−f, where f is the oscillator strength. Φinj is determined by the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinj) and efficient photoinduced intramolecular charge separation. Photoexcitation of a dye leads to exciton generation, separation, and electron transfer from the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The generated exciton must overcome the Coulombic attraction between separated charges to dissociate efficiently. The exciton binding energy (Ecoul) can be estimated in terms of the transferred charges (Δq) and intramolecular charge transfer distance (DCT) as follows: (3)where ε0 and εr are the dielectric constants of the vacuum and real medium, respectively (εr is set as 4.0 in the polar solvent). ΔGinj is defined as the energy difference between the excited state oxidation potential of the dye (E*) and the TiO2 CB (−4.0 eV with the experimental conditions where TiO2 is in contact with aqueous redox electrolytes of fixed pH 7.036,41,42). For an unrelaxed excited state, E* = E0 + Eλmax. E0 is the ground state oxidation potential of dyes in solution, and can be calculated through the Born–Haber cycle.43Eλmax is the vertical excitation energy, which could be obtained using TDDFT calculations.44 As a result, the relatively smaller Ecoul and enough ΔGinj would be beneficial for the enhancement of Φinj.

V
oc is the difference between the potential of the quasi Fermi level of the semiconductor (EF,n) and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Ered), and can be written as follows:33,45,46 (4)where q is the unit charge, kBT is the thermal energy, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, and NCB is the density of states in the semiconductor. ΔECB is the shift of ECB toward the vacuum level induced by adsorbed polar molecules. It is apparent that larger ΔECB and nc would play crucial roles in Voc.32,47 The ΔECB values could be evaluated using the projected density of state calculations. The nc is related to the number of electrons injected from the dye to the TiO2 and the extent of charge recombination.
Though Jsc and Voc could not be predicted quantitatively using theoretical calculations, the qualitative evaluations of the relevant physical parameters, such as ΦLHE, Ecoul, ΔGinj, ΔECB, and nc, are of great help in evaluating the performance of the dyes in the cell.
Computational details
The flexible alkyl chains in the organic dyes have little influence on the electronic structure of the relatively rigid conjugated D–π–A backbone since they exist for the purposes of increasing the solubility and avoiding molecular aggregation. For the sake of saving computational costs, the long alkyl chains were replaced simply by the respective methyl or isopropyl groups in the calculations.48
For D–π–A organic dyes featuring significant intramolecular charge transfer excitations, DFT methods with the inclusion of a fixed percentage of nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange (HFexc) in the functional are commonly employed to predict their ground and excited-state properties.49,50 To determine the optimal amount of nonlocal HFexc in the DFT functional, an evaluation of the results of different hybrid DFT functionals against experimental observables is mandatory. To better describe the ground state properties, the hybrid functionals PBE0 (25% HFexc),51 PBE0-1/3 (33.3% HFexc),52 PBE38 (37.5% HFexc),53 and mpw1k (42.8% HFexc)54 with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set were chosen to optimize dyes 1, 2, and 3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The PBE38-calculated energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) for these molecules are in well agreement with the experimental data (see Table S1, ESI†). Thus, the PBE38 functional was selected for the ground state geometry optimizations and related ground state property calculations. For the accurate descriptions of electronic excitations, TD-DFT methods with PBE0, mpw1k, and BHandHLYP (50% HFexc)55 functionals and a range-separated functional CAM-B3LYP (19% HFexc at short-range and 65% HFexc at long-range)56 were selected to simulate the absorption spectra in THF solution.57,58 The calculated results indicate that the TDDFT-BHandHLYP method provides relatively accurate wavelengths of maximum absorption in comparison to the experimental data (see Table S2, ESI†). Hence TDDFT-BHandHLYP was chosen for simulation of absorption spectra and calculation of excitation energies for these organic dyes, and was previously used to calculate the excitation energies for the molecules with charge transfer characteristics.44,59 Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to confirm that the optimized geometry corresponds to a stationary point. The systems for the dyes adsorbed on a Ti16O32 cluster were also optimized with the pseudo-potential basis set LANL2DZ for Ti and 6-31G(d,p) for the remaining atoms.
The electronic excitations for both dyes and their dye–Ti16O32 complexes at the optimized ground state geometries were calculated using the TDDFT method in THF solution using a polarizable continuum model (PCM) by iteratively solving 50 excitations. The ICT properties were analyzed by using Multiwfn software.60 The total density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) for the dyes and Ti16O32 were obtained with the GaussSum 2.25 program.61 The analyses of the aromaticity were carried out by means of nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) suggested by Schleyer et al.62 The excited-state reorganization energies were calculated using the normal mode analysis (NMA) method with the DUSHIN code.63 The dye–I2 complexes were optimized at the M06-2X level with the LANL2DZ basis set for the I atoms and 6-31G(d,p) for the other atoms to elucidate the presence of possible charge recombination. The basis set superposition error (BSSE) to the binding energies was accounted for by using the counterpoise method. All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.64
Results and discussion
Geometrical structures of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes
All the investigated dyes are fully optimized without any structural constraints. The anatase titania (Ti16O32) cluster with its (101) surface exposed was selected as a model semiconductor substrate to adsorb the sensitizers. This cluster model is large enough to reproduce the electronic absorption spectra,65,66 and has been successfully applied for the investigations of sensitization of nano-TiO2 in previous work.67–69 The optimized structures of 2 and its complex 2–TiO2 are shown as examples in Fig. 2. The optimized structures of the other dyes and their dye–TiO2 complexes are available in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Some dihedral angles for all the optimized structures are summarized in Table 1.

The π-spacers linked between TPA and CAA render rigid and planar configurations in both the isolated dyes and their adsorbed TiO2 complexes. The π-spacer has a twisted angle (α2) with one benzene ring of TPA of about 22°–30°. The distorted angle α1 is in the 30.1°–37.1° range, and is smaller than that in the isolated TPA molecule (40.3°). This is caused by the conjugation of the π-spacer with its adjacent benzene ring. The π-spacers show good coplanarity with the CAA unit with the dihedral angles (α3) less than 0.7° and 5° in the isolated dyes and their complexes, respectively. Thus the π-bridges make excellent π-conjugation with the CAA unit, which could be favorable for ICT and red-shifted absorption spectra.
The dye is adsorbed on TiO2via its carboxylate group in a bidentate bridging manner with one proton transferring to a nearby surface oxygen, which has been proved to be the most stable adsorption mode for the carboxylate group.70 The adsorption energies (Eads) of the dyes on the surface of TiO2 can be calculated as follows: Eads = Edye–TiO2 − Edye − ETiO2, where Edye–TiO2, Edye, and ETiO2 denote the energies of the dye–TiO2 complex, isolated dye, and TiO2 cluster, respectively. The calculated adsorbed energies and bridging Ti–O bond lengths are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The calculated Eads values are in the −20.6 to −31.6 kcal mol−1 range, indicating that there exist strong interactions between the dyes and the TiO2 substrate. The interfacial Ti–O bond lengths are within the 1.95–2.02 Å range. Such Ti–O distances are comparable to the Ti–O bond lengths in the bulk TiO2 (1.934–1.980 Å). Both adsorption energies and Ti–O bond lengths suggest that chemisorption of the dyes on the TiO2(101) surface occurs. The strong chemical bonding between the dyes and TiO2 could benefit the charge injection from the dyes to the semiconductor. The fused aromatic segments could enhance the electron delocalization in dyes. From the geometrical structure point of view, rigid and planar π-spacers are advantageous for both ICT and charge injection from the dyes into TiO2.
Absorption properties
One of the functions of a sensitizer in a DSSC lies in its light-absorption ability, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the Jsc, as described in eqn (2). An ideal sensitizer should absorb solar radiation as much as possible in the visible–near-IR range to match the solar spectrum. From the above-mentioned geometrical structures, we know that the rigid π-spacers will extend the π-conjugations of the dyes; herein, we will further investigate the effects of such rigidified π-bridges on their absorption properties by means of TD-DFT calculations.
The UV/visible spectra of the dyes and dye–TiO2 complexes were simulated using the TD-DFT method with the BHandHLYP functional in THF solution. The simulated spectra of the dyes and their dye–TiO2 complexes are shown in Fig. 3. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f), light harvesting efficiencies (ΦLHE(λ)), and transition characters for S0 → S1 for the dyes are summarized in Table 2. To make a comprehensive comparison of the absorption abilities of the dyes, the normalized integrated areas (S) in the 300–780 nm range of the absorption spectra are also evaluated by taking the integrated spectral area of 1 as a reference. The calculated λmax values are in good agreement with the available experimental results. The spectra of these dyes have two distinct absorption bands in the ultraviolet and visible regions. The absorption in shorter wavelengths (300–390 nm) is ascribed to π–π* transitions of the conjugated molecules, and the bands in the longer wavelength region (390–780 nm) arise from the both π–π* transitions and ICT transition from the donor unit to the acceptor part, which can be analyzed from the TD-DFT results. The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), especially the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are closely related to the absorption process. The transition characters for the strongest absorption peaks in the visible region for all the dyes are assigned to two different transitions: one is the transition from the HOMO−1 to LUMO, and the other is the transition from the HOMO to LUMO.

For better understanding the nature of the absorption spectra, some selected FMOs of 1–4 are shown in Fig. 4, and the FMOs for the rest of the dyes are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). All the molecules show similar FMO spatial distributions. The HOMOs are localized in the TPA and the part of the π-spacer adjacent to TPA, while the LUMOs are concentrated on the CAA and its directly-linked part of the π-bridge. The HOMO−1s spread over the entire molecule for all the dyes. The noticeable feature of these dyes is that the HOMO and LUMO are distributed in the different parts of the molecules, though there exist shared parts in the middle of the π-bridges. The apparent HOMO–LUMO separation would result in the ICT transitions in the absorption process. The maximum absorption peaks originate from the dominant transitions from the HOMO to LUMO for all molecules, as indicated in Table 2. Thus, we can conclude that the prominent ICT transitions occur in the 390–780 nm range in the absorption spectra. The transition from the HOMO−1 to LUMO contains both ICT and local π–π* transitions. With the increase of the size of the π-bridge, the dyes have more delocalized FMOs and red-shifted spectra.
 Fig. 4  Spatial distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of dyes 1–4 (saturated H atoms are not shown). 
In comparison to 1, dyes 2 and 3 have obviously gradually increased oscillator strengths of absorption, thus achieving improved ΦLHE(λ). The dyes with medium-size π-spacers (2, 5, and 6) have similar f values, and the dyes with large-size π-spacers (3, 4, 7, and 8) have strong oscillator strengths larger than 2.0. The dyes with extended π-spacers (3, 4, 7, and 8) possess better absorption capacities. 4 has a slightly smaller S than 3, 7, and 8. The substitution of thiophene with pyrrole in the π-spacers could enhance the light absorption because of the relatively stronger electronic coupling of heteroatom nitrogen in pyrrole with the π-spacer.71 Dyes 2 and 5 have slightly larger S than 1, while 6 has a relatively weaker absorption ability than 1, which indicates that the dyes with π-spacers containing fused electron-deficient and electron-rich entities are favorable for enhancing the absorption ability.
Based on the calculated data, it can be found that the dye–TiO2 complexes show a red-shifted absorption band with a high intensity in comparison to those of the dyes, which is in agreement with previous work.31,59 The absorption spectra of the dye–TiO2 complexes might approximate to the practical spectra in cell devices. Therefore the dye–TiO2 complexes show a red-shifted absorption band, which is beneficial for absorbing and utilizing more sunlight.
Frontier orbital levels of the isolated dyes
The efficient electron injection from the sensitizer to the CB of TiO2 and dye regeneration in the electrolyte play very essential roles in the practical operation of TiO2-DSSC devices. Thus the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO must fulfill the basic energetic requirements for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration.
The relative orderings of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels could provide a reasonable qualitative indication of the ability to gain or lose electrons in the redox process. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO for all the dyes are shown in Fig. 5. The model molecule with naphthalene as the π-spacer (NAP) was studied as a reference. The calculated LUMO levels are usually overestimated (dotted lines). A more accurate assessment of the LUMO levels can be made through the optical gap following the expression:72,73ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg. Eg represents the first singlet excitation energy, and it can be evaluated using the TD-DFT method. All dyes possess higher LUMO levels than the CB level of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum),36,41 ensuring that an effective electron injection occurs from the LUMOs of the dyes to the CB of TiO2. However, the HOMO levels of the dyes are lower than the redox potential energy of I3−/I− (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum),74–76 which guarantees that the regeneration of the oxidized dye species are energetically favorable.
 Fig. 5  Calculated energy levels of FMOs and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for all the dyes. 
The electron-deficient units in the π-spacers will decrease both the HOMO and LUMO levels, while the electron-rich parts will increase both of them. The appropriate combination of electron-deficient and electron-rich units could obtain favourable HOMO–LUMO gaps for better utilization of sunlight and the optimized HOMO and LUMO levels for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration. In comparison to model compound NAP, 1 with electron deficient BTZ as the π-bridge has a slightly decreased HOMO and a significantly lowered LUMO, thus resulting in a greatly reduced HOMO–LUMO gap. BTZ and QX have similar electron-withdrawing abilities, so 3 and 8 (also 2 and 5) have similar LUMO levels. On the other hand, BTD in the π-spacer of 7 has a relatively strong electron-withdrawing ability, and decreases the LUMO more significantly than the HOMO, thus resulting in a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap. Compared with 1, the enlargement of the conjugated π spacers with fused thiophenes in 2 and 4 will gradually raise the HOMOs; the π spacers fused with thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole in 3, 7, and 8 could raise the HOMOs more significantly than the LUMOs, thus leading to narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps. In comparison to 4, the substitution effect of heteroatom N in 3 on the increasing HOMO level (0.2 eV) is prominent because of the relatively stronger electron donating ability of nitrogen. Such dyes with extended π-spacers could decrease the HOMO–LUMO gaps, which is beneficial for the optical absorption in the long-wavelength range.
Intramolecular charge separation
From the analysis of the absorption spectra of the dyes, we know that the ICT makes great contribution to the light absorption. Upon photoexcitation, apparent charge separation will occur in their first excited states, which could be favorable for the interfacial electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the CB of TiO2. To quantify the extent of charge separation for the dyes, we analyze the ICT process based on the electron density difference (Δρ) between the ground and the first excited state.37 The spatial charge separation can be visualized by the electron density differences as depicted in Fig. 6, in which two different colors denote the increase and decrease of electron density relative to the ground state. To visualize the CT more clearly, two centroids of charges associated with the positive and negative density regions were calculated through a Gaussian distribution with root-mean-square deviations. Apparently, all the sensitizers show a noticeable charge separation upon excitation. The electron density increment regions are localized on the cyanoacrylic acids and their adjacent parts of π-spacers, while the zones of density depletion are allocated at the donor moieties and their neighboring π-bridges.

Several related physical quantities, such as the transferred charges (Δq), charge transfer lengths (DCT), variations in dipole moment between the ground and excited states (Δμ), and Coulombic attraction energies between the separated charges (Ecoul) are summarized in Table 3. Δq can be obtained from the integration of the electron density increment or depletion regions over all space. For one electron excitation, Δq is assumed to have the value between 0 and 1. DCT is defined as the spatial distance between the barycenters of the electron density increment and density depletion regions associated with the electronic excitation. Δμ is the product of Δq and DCT (Δμ = ΔqDCT), and contains information for both the amount of charge involved and charge transfer distance upon excitation. Ecoul is the binding energy of the separated charges, and it is calculated using eqn (3). The more charges involved in the ICT could be favorable for increasing charges for electron injection in the surface of TiO2. However, the more charges could increase inevitably the binding energies of the separated charges. The larger DCT could be beneficial for charge separation for an intramolecular exciton.

In general, the Δq and DCT first increased and then decreased with increasing length of π-spacers for quasilinear D–π–A polyene oligomers.77 However, for the fused π-bridges investigated in this work, the changes in Δq and DCT with the different spacers seem to be very complicated. The Δq is found to be highly dependent on the π-bridge dimensions. The Δq values are similar for those with similar π-bridge sizes (0.79 |e−| in 1, 0.70–0.73 |e−| in 2, 5, and 6, and 0.64–0.68 |e−| in 3, 4, 7, and 8). DCT is determined by both the dimensions and the electronic structure of the π-bridge. In comparison with 1, dyes 2 and 4 increase DCT because of the extensions of π-systems with the more fused thiophenes. The DCT of 3 significantly decreases when the fused pyrrole ring substitutes for the fused thiophene ring (as in 4). This can be explained by the fact that the electronegativity of the N atom in pyrrole is greater than that of the S atom in thiophene, and thus hinders the effective electron delocalization and transfer. The calculated values of Δq and DCT for 2 and 5 are larger than those of 6, indicating that the π-bridge containing both electron deficient and rich segments is favorable for ICT properties. It is worth noting that the binding energies of the separated charges for the sensitizers (3, 4, 7, and 8) are relatively smaller, which might facilitate charge separation at the dye/TiO2 interface and the electron transfer to the cluster to a larger extent. For the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the DCT and Δq are larger than those of the isolated dyes. The resulting Δμ values for all dye–TiO2 complexes are comparable.
Aromaticities and reorganization energies
For better understanding the effect of the planar and rigid π-spacers on the ICT properties of the sensitizers, the aromaticities of the heteroatomic rings in the π-bridges and reorganization energies of the sensitizers upon excitation are calculated. Aromaticity is the property of a planar, cyclic and conjugated molecule in which electron delocalization in closed circuits endows molecules with special properties.78,79 The aromaticities of the cyclic fused π-spacers might affect the ICT properties. The reorganization energy (Λ) in the excited state reflects the energy required for the structural relaxation of dyes from the ground state to the excited state. Small Λ values imply relatively small structural relaxation in the excited state, which could be favorable for improving the photochemical stability of the sensitizers.
The nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) is based on the magnetic shielding computed at chosen points in the vicinity of molecules, and has become a popular index used to measure aromaticity.62 A significantly negative (shielded) NICS value at 1 Å above the ring center (NICS(1)) is calculated to denote the aromatic magnitude (for the heterocyclic ring here, the ring center is defined as the ring bonding critical point).80 The calculated NICS(1) values are shown in Fig. 7. When electrons pass through the π-bridges, the aromatic rings directly linked with TPA and CAA become the main electron-transfer routes (as indicated in Fig. 7), in which the aromaticities of these fused rings could affect the electron movements. The more negative the NICS(1) value, the more aromatic the ring. The aromaticities of the model molecule NAP is calculated for making direct comparison to that of BTZ-based compound 1. The NICS(1) of the benzene ring directly connected with TPA and CAA in NAP is −10.5, which is more negative than those of the central benzene rings in the π-spacers of all the investigated molecules. Chen et al. have demonstrated that the molecular conductance correlates negatively with the aromaticity in a single-molecule conductance measurement.81 So the decreased aromaticity of the central benzene ring might facilitate ICT from the electron donor to electron acceptor.
 Fig. 7  Schematic diagram of electron transfer routes in molecular π-bridges in which the NICS(1) values of the individual heterocyclic rings are indicated. 
The DCT and Δq of NAP are 4.47 Å and 0.78 e−, respectively, which are slightly shorter and smaller than those of 1. The triazole and pyrazine rings in the π-spacers show more negative NICS(1) values (<−11.0), which somehow modulate the aromaticities of their neighboring central benzene rings, thus affecting the electron delocalization and electron transfer. The DCT and Δq of 3 are smaller than those of 4, which can be ascribed to the more negative NICS(1) values of the pyrrole rings than those of the thiophene rings in the fused π-spacers.
Besides the aromaticity, the localized orbital locator-π (LOL-π) can also provide an intuitive picture of the significant π character of the π-bridge. The LOL-π isosurfaces of the π-bridges computed from the π-density are shown in Fig. 8. The regions with high LOL-π values are associated with π bonding orbitals, while the regions with small LOL-π values are in the boundary areas between localized π orbitals. The contiguous regions in yellow and red can be regarded as the delocalized π orbitals, which are the possible through-bond electron transfer pathways (as indicated with dotted lines in Fig. 8). For the fused π systems, there might exist several electron transfer pathways through delocalized π orbitals. When the electrons pass through the π-bridges, they might suffer the interference from the fused neighbouring rings, such as benzene (6), triazole (1, 2, 3, and 4), and pyrazine (5). The LOL-π isosurfaces in naphthalene and NDT (6) show excellent connectivity of the π orbitals with the upper benzene ring, which indicates that once electrons transfer through the π-bridge, they might possibly move into the upper benzene ring, and might be trapped or disturbed, thus leading to relatively smaller DCT and Δq. The π orbitals in triazole and pyrazine might partly involve in the electron transfer, and the disturbance of such orbitals to the main electron transfer pathway is less prominent than that of benzene rings. The different electronegativities of the heteroatoms (S and N) have a significant impact on the π bonding pattern and electron delocalization. The high accumulation of electron density at the nitrogen atoms is due to their high electronegativity. Such localized density at the nitrogen atoms will preclude an effective cyclic electron delocalization. So the fused thiophene could be more beneficial than the fused pyrrole for electron transfer between the donor and acceptor. The introduction of an electron-deficient ring in the π-bridges might be helpful for the decoherence of multiple electron transport pathways, and thus could be favorable for electron transfer.82

The calculated excited state reorganization energies (Λ) of all the investigated dyes are summarized in Table 4. Except for 1, the Λ values of molecules 2–8 are in the 0.28–0.33 eV range, which means that upon excitation the structural changes for such rigid π-spacer molecules are small enough to guarantee their photochemical stability. The reorganization energies can be decomposed into contributions from individual vibrational normal modes. The vibrational modes which make the largest contribution to the reorganization energy belong to the low frequency twisting vibration of TPA, and high frequency stretching motions of the backbone in the conjugated π-spacers. The contributions to the reorganization energy from individual vibrational modes for dyes 1–3 are taken as examples and depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The percentages of these two types of modes that contributed to the total reorganization energy are also listed in Table 4. With the increase of the dimensions of the π-bridge, the contributions from the twisting vibrational modes of TPA decrease, and the contributions from the stretching motions of the backbone in the π-bridges increase. The conjugated π-backbone stretching motions in the π-bridges might be helpful for the intramolecular electron transfer.83,84

Electron injection at the dye/TiO2 interface
To explore the effect of π-spacers on the electron injection at the dye/semiconductor interface, the dyes are adsorbed on Ti16O32 through two O–Ti bonds in a bidentate-bridging mode to simulate the dye/TiO2 interaction. Upon excitation, the electronic transitions associated with the S0 → S1 for BTZ-based dye–TiO2 complexes for 1, 2, and 3 are attributed to HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO. The corresponding frontier orbitals of these complexes are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The HOMO−1s and HOMOs are primarily localized on the donors and π-spacer moieties, and the LUMOs are delocalized over the cyanoacrylic anchoring groups of the dyes and the TiO2 cluster, which indicate that the transfer of electrons from the dyes to the TiO2 surface could occur.
As mentioned above, the effective intramolecular charge separation and relatively small Ecoul are beneficial for increasing the efficiency of charge injection.85 The rapid and efficient electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer into the conduction band of TiO2 is desired for the high performance of DSSCs. The electron injection driving force (ΔGinj) is another important factor affecting the Φinj. Key parameters for deducing ΔGinj are listed in Table 5. All the calculated values of ΔGinj are very negative, indicating that the electron injection process is thermodynamically possible. The excited-state oxidation potentials of the dyes lie above the TiO2 conduction band edge, which is in good agreement with the energy level matching results discussed above. Though the absolute value of ΔGinj for 4 is the smallest (|ΔGinj| = 1.48 eV), it is still sufficient to ensure effective electron injection.78 All the investigated D–π–A dyes with rigid π-spacers can inject electrons into the CB of TiO2 efficiently.

Open-circuit voltage
A desirable Voc is required to improve the PCE of a dye cell. As described in eqn (4), the Voc is directly determined by the shift of the conduction band of the semiconductor toward the vacuum level (ΔECB) and the number of electrons injected into the conduction band nc. The polar dyes adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 can make the CB of TiO2 shift toward the vacuum level, thus leading to a higher Voc for a defined redox shuttle in DSSCs.47,79 A comparison of the PDOS of TiO2 in dye–TiO2 complexes and the DOS of pure TiO2 is made to determine the ΔECB, which has been described in detail in our previous work69 and other publications.34 The DOS for all the dyes are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The nc value is determined by the amount of transferred charge (Δq) in the dye–TiO2 complexes and the extent of charge recombination.
The calculated ΔECB and Δq of the dye–TiO2 complexes are summarized in Tables 5 and 3, respectively. With the increment of the π-bridge dimensions in 3, 7, and 8, the ΔECB values are relatively large. For the nc value, the charge recombination is also a critical factor. It is commonly accepted that the charge recombination from the injected electron at the surface of TiO2 back to the electrolyte (I3−/I−) contributes most to the loss of nc.86,87 Herein, we select dyes 3, 4, and 8 to investigate the π-bridge effect on the charge recombination. The I2 is the main electron acceptor in the electrolyte, and N, S atoms or –CN groups in the dyes could be possible sites for dye–I2 interactions through halogen bonding.88 The higher iodine concentration in the vicinity of the dye will lead to accelerated electron recombination. The intermolecular binding energy between the dye and I2 could determine the stability of the dye–I2 complexes.89 The larger the binding energy, the higher iodine concentration near the binding sites. The optimized structures of selected dye–I2 complexes with the corresponding binding energies are presented in Fig. 9. The binding energy of 4–I2 at the CN site is larger than those of other sites. On the other hand, for dyes 3 and 8, the binding energies of dye–I2 are comparable at CN and N1 sites. In comparison with 4, 3(8) possesses two possible favorable binding sites, and the binding site at N1 is located away from the acceptor (or the surface of TiO2), which could decrease the local concentration of iodine near the semiconductor surface. Thus the dyes with thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-fused π-spacers possibly present low charge recombination. Besides, the binding energies of dye–I2 for dye 8 are relatively smaller than those of 3–I2, indicating that dye 8 may have lower probability to bind I2, which might lead to smaller iodine concentration near the TiO2 surface. Based on the calculated data, We could infer that dye 8 would obtain larger Voc in comparison to the other dyes, because it has slower charge recombination, larger ΔECB, and similar Δq.

Conclusions
In summary, we have carried out an in-depth theoretical investigation on how rigid π-spacers with fused electron-rich and electron-deficient segments affect the electronic properties and photovoltaic performance of a class of D–π–A dyes by means of DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The relevant physical parameters in relation to Jsc and Voc are evaluated in detail. The effects of the rigid fused π-spacers are listed as follows:
• The sensitizer with structurally planarized and fused large π-bridge is of benefit to intramolecular electron delocalization and electron communication between the donor and acceptor.
• The π-spacers containing fused heterocyclic pyrrole rings could significantly enhance the light harvesting ability of the sensitizer.
• The combination of the fused electron-rich and electron-deficient components in the π-bridge could possibly adjust the FMO levels to narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps, thus leading to red-shifted absorption spectra.
• The introduction of an electron deficient component in the π-bridge could decrease the aromaticities of the π-system, and might provide a decoherence mechanism in multiple electron transfer pathways, resulting in improved ICT properties.
• The larger rigid π-bridge in dyes ensures small excited state reorganization energies, which guarantees the photochemical stability of dyes.
• The dyes with thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-fused π-spacers possibly possess large ΔECB and low charge recombination possibilities, thus possibly increasing Voc.
• The rigid π-spacers in all the investigated D–π–A dyes can efficiently inject electrons to the CB of TiO2.
This work clarifies how and to what extent the π-spacers with the combination of electron-rich and electron-deficient components affect the performance of the sensitizer, and gives more physical insight into the structure–property relationship for such rigid π-bridges. With the reliable theoretical investigation, we have reasons to believe that such rigid π-bridges have the advantage for DSSC applications. The thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-fused π-spacers would be possible good candidates for π-bridges in molecular design, for example, as in 8. This work also provides an effective way to design rigid π-bridges, and gives theoretical guidelines on the design of high performance sensitizer materials.
