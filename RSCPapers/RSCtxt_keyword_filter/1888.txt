    , Accepted 7th May 2017First published on 9th May 2017AbstractLadder-type conjugated structures with rigid and coplanar molecular frameworks feature longer effective conjugation, affirmative optoelectronic properties and strong intermolecular π–π interactions, which are ideal characteristics for organic photovoltaics. Here, a new “zigzag” angular-fused naphthodifuran (zNDF) based on alkoxyphenyl side chains was designed and synthesized. The distannylated zNDF building block was copolymerized with 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-3-fluorophenyl)-6,7-difloroquinoxaline (Br-BT and Br-ffQx) acceptor units by Stille cross coupling reaction to form two new medium bandgap donor–acceptor polymers PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx, respectively. The photovoltaic properties of the copolymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor were investigated. A 6.9% efficiency was achieved from the single device based on the PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend film with a 0.25% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, which is among the highest efficiency for zNDF-based polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting increasing attention during the past decade due to their easy fabrication, low cost, simple device structure and flexible properties.1–3 The most active layer architecture for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC devices consists of a mixture of conjugated donor materials, such as poly(3-hexlthiophene) (P3HT) and a soluble fullerene acceptor such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).4,5 While the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and satisfying lifetimes are not yet competitive with inorganic solar cells, the potential for large-scale commercialization of high performance photovoltaic devices using printing or roll-to-roll techniques has created significant opportunities in the scientific laboratory and commercial companies.6–10 Thus, tremendous research effort is focused on the design of new photovoltaic materials with a modified structure and optimizing the device fabrication to realize this goal.11–17
In order to achieve high performance PSCs, the successful and universal strategy is to design the “push–pull” or “donor–acceptor (D–A)” concept into the polymer backbone, which can offer the unique features of tuning the energy levels and the bandgap.18,19 The innovation of photovoltaic materials, especially for donors, has attracted great attention in the last decade.20–22 For the design of donor materials, several aspects must be considered together with a delicate balance: broad and strong absorption, suitable and stable energy levels, high mobility and good solubility.23,24
Among tons of different donor materials, conjugated side chain substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) has been proven to be an excellent donor building block.25–27 Indeed, the BDT building block has attracted considerable academic and industrial interest due to its ease of synthesis, relatively easy modifications and planar conjugated structures.23,28 Meanwhile, because of the rigid and coplanar architecture of BDT to facilitate π-electron delocalization and π–π stacking for efficient charge transport, BDT-based polymers are promising electron donors for constructing high efficiency photovoltaic materials. As is well known, the rigidified coplanar structures can suppress the rotational disorder of the interannular single bonds of the polymer, which can increase the charge carrier mobility.29–31 Thus, another promising and attractive π-conjugated acenedithiophene, tetracyclic naphthadi–thiophenes with the angular shaped (“zigzag”) analogues (zNDT), has received increasing attention.32–34 To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of zNDT-based PSCs have reached more than 8% with a thickness of 300 nm.32 As a similar structure to the zNDT core, the “zigzag” angular-fused naphthodifuran (zNDF) has received far less attention than zNDT, although the difference is merely replacing thiophene with furan rings.35 Compared with the zNDT unit, zNDF-based conjugated polymers have shown some potential for PSCs. Meanwhile, the solubility, energy levels, light absorption and intermolecular packing may be strongly influenced by the furan rings which replace the thiophene rings in the donor unit.36–38 For example, due to the small radius of an oxygen atom, zNDF-based conjugated polymers have dense crystal packing and large intermolecular orbital overlap as well as small reorganization energy, therefore showing higher hole mobilities of up to 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 than its sulfur counterpart (measured by the organic field-effect transistor (OFET) method).39 In 2013, our group firstly reported a conjugated polymer-PNDFDTBT, comprising naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b9]difuran and 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, which exhibited a PCE of 4.5% and a high hole mobility of up to 7.46 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.40 Zhang's group designed and synthesized a new two-dimensional D–A conjugated copolymer (PNDFT-DTBT), consisting of alkylthienyl substituted zNDF as an electron donor unit and benzothiadiazole as an electron accepting unit, and without any device modification, the copolymer showed a 5.22% efficiency.35 Recently, by replacing the thiophene unit with benzene moieties as BDT conjugated side chains, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values of the resulting polymers are expected to be lower, which will lead to higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in photovoltaic devices.20
Taking into account all the reasons discussed above, to explore the more in-depth zNDF unit and the different mixing behaviors, we designed and synthesized two new two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated zNDF-based polymers, named as PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx, from the alkoxyphenyl substituted zNDF (zNDFP) unit, 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M2)41–43 and 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-3-fluoro-phenyl)-6,7-difloroquinoxaline (M3)44,45 (Scheme 1). Both of them showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene owing to the solubilizing alkoxyphenyl groups placed in the middle of the zNDF and the acceptor units which have the appropriate position with reduced steric interaction between adjacent repeating units. The PSC devices based on the blends of these polymers with PC71BM showed PCEs over 5.6%. More importantly, the best PCE of 6.9% (with a Voc of 0.86 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.2 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72) was obtained for PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM based devices. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 6.9% is the highest value for zNDF PSCs.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomer and polymers are shown in Scheme 1 and the experimental details are included in the ESI.† As shown in Scheme 1. The new monomer 4,9-bis(4-((2-ethylpentyl)oxy)phenyl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran-2,7-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane (M1) was prepared through a five-step reaction from commercially available 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the precursor 4 of M1, the monomer M1 and the corresponding polymers is shown in Fig. S1–S5 (ESI†). 1,5-Bis(2,2-diethoxyethoxy)naphthalene (1) was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to obtain 1,5-dibromo-4,8-bis(2,2-diethoxyethoxy)naphthalene (2). 5,10-Dibromonaphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (3) was synthesized from compound 2 and polyphosphoric acid (PPA) by successive cyclization reaction. Subsequently, compound 4 was obtained from 4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)tributyl stannane and compound 3 through the Stille coupling reaction in the moderate yield. M1 was obtained from the stanylated reaction of 4. Finally, M1 was copolymerized with the dibromide derivatives (M2 and M3) through Stille coupling reactions to obtain the target polymers PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and refluxed for 24 h in toluene under argon. The polymers were purified by continuous extractions with methanol, hexanes, acetone and chloroform. And then the chloroform fraction was concentrated under vacuum evaporation. The molecular weights and polydispersity indices of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as standard (Waters 515 HPLC pump, a Waters 2414 differential refractometer, and three Waters Styragel columns (HT2, HT3 and HT4) using THF (HPLC grade) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C. The number average molecular weight (Mn) was 13 kDa for PzNDFP-BT (PDI = 1.85) and 12 kDa for PzNDFP-ffQx (PDI = 1.92).
The thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (as shown in Fig. S6 in ESI†), which showed that PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx had good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 314 and 393 °C, respectively. The result indicates that these polymers possess proper thermal stability which is adequate for their application in PSC devices. The related data including the molecular weights, polymerization yields and TGA data of the polymers are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the two polymers PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx in chloroform (CF) solution the thin film state at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1a and b. And the detailed absorption parameters, including absorption maxima (λmax), absorption edge (λonset) and the optical bandgap (Eg), are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of the polymers were characterized by two spectral features; the short wavelength region from 350 to 450 nm is assigned to a localized π–π* transition, whereas the long wavelength region from 450 to 700 nm is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition.46 From Fig. 1a, the maximum absorption peak for PzNDFP-BT in CF and film states was located at 560 and 600 nm, respectively. Compared to the solution state, a 40 nm redshift in the film state indicated stronger π–π interactions in the polymer thin film than those in solution. For Fig. 1b, however, the thin film absorption of PzNDFP-ffQx exhibited similar optical properties to that in solution. Compared to the maximum absorption in the solution state, the thin film maximum absorption slightly redshifted only by ∼4 nm, implying that stronger intermolecular interactions exist in solution. Due to relatively large steric hindrance and electron affinities from the benzene ring, the torsion angles between the alkoxyphenyl and the backbone unit in zNDFP were high. The absorption intensity of the polymers was attributed to the various torsion angles between the side chain group and the backbone that cause the diverse oscillator strength. In particular in the short wavelength range (300–500 nm), polymers showed distinct peaks.47,48 From the onset of the thin film absorption, we can estimate the optical bandgap Eoptg (Eoptg = 1240/λonset) of 1.87 eV and 1.74 eV for PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of two polymers were investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 1c), and the energy levels are shown in Fig. 1d. The polymer film was created by drop casting the polymer dissolved in CF on the electrode. Measurements were performed with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in an anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution of 0.1 M of tetrabuylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6). From the CV curves, PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx exhibited the oxidation process with the onset potentials Eonsetox = 0.82 V and 0.85 V, respectively, and the onset potentials for their reduction Eonsetox were found to be −0.93 V and −0.91 V, respectively. Hence, according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.41) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred + 4.41) (eV), where the units of Eonsetox and Eonsetred are in V vs. Ag/AgCl. For PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx, the HOMO values were calculated to be −5.23 eV and −5.26 eV, respectively, and the corresponding LUMO values were −3.47 eV and −3.49 eV, respectively. The aforementioned results indicated that the band gap and molecular energy levels of zNDF-based polymers could be tuned by using suitable electron-withdrawing BT and ffQx groups. The optical and CV data of the polymers are summarized in Table 1.
Hole mobility
The photocurrent generation depends on the efficiency of charge carrier generation and transport. To investigate the charge transport in PzNDFP-BT and PzNDFP-ffQx films, using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method, the hole-only mobilities in the active layers were measured with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PzNDFP-BT (or PzNDFP-ffQx):PC71BM/Au (Fig. 2a and c) and the electron mobilities of the photosensitive layers were measured with a device structure of ITO/Al/ PzNDFP-BT (or PzNDFP-ffQx):PC71BM/Al (Fig. 2b and d), and the related results are summarized in Table 2. For blend films without DIO, PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM showed hole mobilities of 5.38 × 10−5 and 1.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and electron mobilities of 3.30 × 10−5 and 4.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In terms of blend films with DIO, the hole mobility of PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM increased to 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is lower than that of PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM (4.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The electron mobilities of PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM films with DIO are 1.75 × 10−4 and 8.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As for PzNDTP-BT, the high and more balanced mobility ratio (μh/μe = 1.3), which could reduce recombination, results in higher PCE values. On the other hand, the high and balanced hole and electron mobilities help explain the high PCEs achieved in DIO-processed solar cells and also reflects the morphological changes in these blend films.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to evaluate photovoltaic properties, PSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al or ZrAcac/Al. The active layer comprises of PzNDFP-BT or PzNDFP-ffQx and PC71BM blends, forming interpenetrating donor/acceptor networks. J–V characteristics were tested under Air Mass 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination (Fig. 3a). Photovoltaic characteristics including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are listed in Table 3. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), experiments were conducted to reach the optimal ratio of the blends of polymers and PC71BM. Conventional cells were fabricated with polymers:PC71BM blend ratios from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 (w/w), with the PCEs of PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM for the 1.5:1, 1:1 and 1:1.5 blends reaching 2.09%, 2.24% and 1.91%, respectively, and the PCEs of PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM for the 1.5:1, 1:1 and 1:1.5 blends reaching 1.83%, 2.86% and 1.85%, respectively. Of the different ways to improve photovoltaic properties, the use of solvent additive has evolved into a common method. Hence, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was employed in order to enhance the photovoltaic properties. The result showed that the additive concentration of 0.25 wt% DIO led to the PCE of 6.9% for the PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM cell with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2 and an extremely high FF up to 0.72, and 5.6% for the PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 12.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55. Among the two polymers, PzNDTP-BT shows better photovoltaic properties because of its higher FF. The FF of the device is dependent on the morphology and balanced mobility ratio of the conjugated polymer. As investigated above, PzNDTP-BT has a high and more balanced mobility ratio, which allows for a higher FF in the device compared to PzNDTP-ffQx. While the devices with ZrAcac as the cathode interlayer replacing the PDINO layer, a promising Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2 for PzNDFP-BT was obtained but with the same PCE, which is due to the slight reduction of the FF. To further understand the photovoltaic performance, external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the two polymers were recorded under the optimized conditions. As shown in Fig. 2b, all the EQE spectra exhibited a broad photoresponse region covering from 300 to 700 nm with a broad and flat peak around 50–70% at approximately 350–630 nm for PzNDFP-BT and 50–70% at approximately 350–670 nm for PzNDFP-ffQx, respectively. The different EQE photoresponses of the two polymers could be ascribed to the different situations of phase separation, charge transport, and intra- and intermolecular stacking behaviors. The integral current density values deduced from the EQE curves are in good agreement with those observed in J–V measurements (∼5% mismatch).

The bimolecular recombination kinetics of the active layers has been studied to gain insight into the effects of the DIO-processed additive on the device performance. Fig. 3c and d show the as-cast and optimized films of PzNDFP-BT/PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx/PC71BM blends under different light intensities to study charge recombination under the short circuit conditions, the related data are listed in Table 2 The correlation between Jsc and illumination intensity (P) can be described by Jsc ∝ Pα where the power-law component α should be linearity when geminate recombination in the device can be ignored.49–51 In the PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM device, the α values were estimated to be 0.94. When adding 0.25 wt% DIO, the α value was increased to 0.99. In the PzNDFP-ffQx:PC71BM, the DIO-processed device also made the α value increase from 0.94 to 0.97. The bimolecular recombination for devices with DIO treatment decreases slightly compared with that of the preliminary devices. This also agrees well with the result of a relatively higher Jsc and FF obtained by DIO treatment.
Morphology
The morphology control of the active layers plays an important role in the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. To understand the effects of the solvent additive on the morphology of the active layers and the photovoltaic performance, a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized. The height and phase images of the optimized blend films processed with or without the DIO additive are shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a, the surface of the PzNDFP-BT:PC71BM blend obtained without DIO showed a smooth film, with a root-mean-square (RMS) as low as 2.30 nm. When treating the blend films with DIO (Fig. 4b), the surface roughness of the film is improved obviously, and the RMS value is increased to 2.88 nm. The height images were presented in Fig. 4c showing large features with a RMS of 5.52 nm when no additive is applied, while significantly reduced feature sizes are observed upon the addition of DIO (Fig. 4d). As is well known, the phase separation of blend films should be in a suitable range to balance charge separation and charge transport.52 As seen from Fig. 4b and d, in this case, both polymers formed favorable interpenetrating nanofiber phased separations under the additive conditions, which is beneficial for the charge separation/transport. The effects of DIO were further visualized by TEM under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4e and g, without DIO, slightly larger scale phase separations (big sizes for dark and light domains) could be observed in the PzNDFP-BT/PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx/PC71BM blend films, which would be harmful for the charge carrier transport at the interface between the photosensitive layers.53 In the films, processed with DIO, large fullerene domains are absent (Fig. 4f and h), indeed, creating interpenetrating nanofibrous networks through the promotion of the demixing of the polymer:PC71BM, in qualitative agreement with the above AFM results.54–56

To clearly quantify the relationship between the photovoltaic properties and additives, we monitored the crystallinities of the polymer/PC71BM with and without DIO by out-of-plane XRD analysis for the thin films spin-coated from CHCl3 solution onto silicon substrates. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the XRD patterns of PzNDFP-BT/PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx/PC71BM as-cast films showed weak diffraction peaks, and the d-spacing values were 4.51 Å and 4.27 Å for PzNDFP-BT/PC71BM and PzNDFP-ffQx/PC71BM, respectively. After the subsequent addition of the DIO additive, the diffraction peak for PzNDFP-ffQx/PC71BM was only slightly increased. In contrast, the diffraction peak of PzNDFP-BT/PC71BM became remarkably more intense, indicating a higher degree of crystallinity driven by the DIO treatment.57 This compact π–π stacking and the ordered structure from the solvent with the additive could be helpful for charge transportation in the corresponding device, then leading to an increase in Jsc.58
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new medium bandgap conjugated polymers, PzNDTP-BT and PzNDTP-ffQx, composed of an alkoxyphenyl-substituted zNDF donor unit and BT or ffQx acceptor units for photovoltaic application. In spite of their medium bandgaps (1.87 eV for PzNDTP-BT and 1.74 eV for PzNDTP-ffQx), they exhibited efficient optoelectronic properties. In particular, under 0.25 wt% DIO additive conditions, both of the polymer:PC71BM blends develop nanoscale phase separation with an interconnected network structure, and also exhibit compact π–π stacking and ordered structure, which afford efficient hole transport and suppressed bimolecular recombination. The single-layer photovoltaic device from the PzNDTP-BT/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend showed a high PCE of 6.9% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2 and a high FF of up to 0.72. This work highlights that alkoxyphenyl-substituted zNDF (zNDFP) can be an important building block for constructing high performance donor polymers.
