    , Accepted 3rd May 2019First published on 6th May 2019AbstractWe report a series of extended-π conjugated tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) based sensitizers for Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) application. In our approach, we have used exTTF as a donor, benzo-thiadiazole-thiophene as a π-bridge and either cyanoacrylic acid (G7 and G8) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an acceptor (G9). G7, G8 and G9 sensitizers are characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. When adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2, the onset of the absorption of these sensitizers was in the 550–700 nm region. DFT studies indicate that the HOMO is delocalized over the anthracene unit mainly and marginally over the π-spacer, whereas the LUMO is delocalized over the π-spacer and anchoring group in all these three sensitizers. Among the fabricated DSSCs with these sensitizers, the G9 based DSSC has shown the best power conversion efficiency of 6.0%.
1. Introduction
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs), also known as Grätzel cells, are anticipated to challenge the performance of amorphous Si based solar cells and compete for a significant market share among third generation solar cells.1–3 This is due to the fact that this technology works even under diffuse light, is easy to fabricate for large area devices, and has an excellent unit price performance metric, which allows it to gain grid parity. DSSCs have crossed a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >11% using Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as the sensitizer and very recently they have seen a 14% PCE using metal-free organic dyes.4–9 Due to several technical constrains the technology is not yet commercialized. The sensitizer is one of the vital components for achieving high PCE and durability of the device. The widely used charge transfer sensitizers are either bis(tetrabutylammonium)-cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) (the N719 dye) or trithiocyanato 4,4′4′′-tricaboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine ruthenium(II) (black dye) with greater than 11% PCE.4–6 However, Ru(II) complexes lack absorption in the near-IR region, have instability owing to the presence of NCS groups, tedious synthetic protocols, and a high price because of the rarity of the metal in the earth's crust and have reached a certain bottleneck in terms of PCE. In this regard metal-free organic dyes are found to be the best alternatives as these dyes offer a large variety of selection in terms of tuneable molecular structures and can be synthesized easily by inexpensive well-established synthetic procedures.10–12 Furthermore, the optical and electrochemical properties of these organic sensitizers can be tuned in a requisite manner through molecular design approaches.
Organic dyes have shown potential as alternatives to Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as a PCE over 10% has already been achieved.13–16 To date, carbazole scaffold based metal-free organic dyes using the D–π–A concept have achieved a PCE of 14%.7–9 However, the majority of metal-free organic dyes are not thermally stable. In this regard, tetrathiafulvalene is one of the best choices based on its thermal stability, and strong π-donor property.17,18 Tetrathiafulvalene is an organosulfur heterocyclic compound and has contributed to the development of molecular electronics. A few sensitizers using tetrathiafulavelene based scaffolds have been reported in the literature but showed low PCE. For example, Grätzel et al. in 2010 first reported extended π-conjugated tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) based sensitizers for DSSCs with a PCE of 3.8%.19 The low PCE of these exTTF based dyes is due to the fact that their absorption is mainly in the UV region and dye regeneration after electron-injection is thermodynamically not favourable due to the energetically high-lying HOMO. Later, Liu and co-workers have modified the design with a quinoxaline-fused TTF sensitizer with red-shifted absorption and showed a PCE of 6.47%.20 In recent times our group reported a series of exTTF based sensitizers featuring the D–π–A approach with G1–G6, with the substitution of tetrathiafulvalene to thioalkyl as the donor and either rhodanine acetic acid or cyanoacrylic acid acting as an acceptor with a varying π-spacer.21,22 The thioalkyl groups not only enhanced the solubility of the sensitizer but also acted as a thioalkyl covering over the substituted anthracene π-spacer to minimize recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with oxidized dye. The optical and electrochemical properties of these sensitizers can be tuned by varying the π-spacer.
In this article, we have further engineered exTTF molecules and reported three novel sensitizers (G7, G8 and G9). In the first molecule, we have inserted a benzo-thiadiazole-thiophene moiety as a π-spacer in between donor exTTF and acceptor cyanoacrylic acid (G7). Specifically, the strong electron-withdrawing benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD) has shown promising efficiency in optoelectronic applications because of its low band gap and highly tunable optical properties.23,24 In 2008, Ko and co-workers25 reported that DSSCs with benzo-thiadiazole had conversion efficiencies of 6.61%. By introducing two alkyl chains onto benzo-thiadiazole, the dye effectively prevented the redox mediator from approaching the TiO2 surface. Further re-designing G7 by introducing an ethynyl group between exTTF and BTD, we have shifted the absorption maximum towards the red-region of the absorption spectrum (G8). Finally, we have replaced the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group with rhodanine acetic acid (G9). It is known in the literature that the incorporation of a rhodanine acetic acid anchoring group in many metal-free organic sensitizers has shown good performance. All these new compounds have optimized energy levels with improving light-harvesting, which leads to high efficiencies.26 The molecular structures of the newly synthesized dyes are shown in Fig. 1.

2. Experimental section
Unless otherwise noted, all commercial reagents and chemicals were procured from either Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Analytical reagent (AR) grade solvents were used for the reactions while laboratory reagent (LR) grade solvents were used for purification and column chromatography. The solvents utilized for spectroscopic and electrochemical experiments were further purified using standard procedures. ACME silica gel (100–200 mesh) was used for column chromatography. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on Merck-precoated silica gel 60-F254 plates. All the reactions were carried out under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere using dry and degassed solvents.

n-Butyl lithium (0.25 mL, 2.85 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1 (0.1 g, 0.102 mmol) in dry THF at −78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h and then at room temperature for 2 h. After cooling to −78 °C, tributylstannyl chloride (48 mg, 3.09 mmol) was added and stirring continued at room temperature for 6 h. Saturated ammonium chloride solution was added in order to quench the reaction. The mixture was extracted with DCM and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated; the obtained crude was mixed with 5-(7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (28 mg, 0.154 mmol) in DMF. The catalyst palladium(II) (18 mg, 0.08 mmol) was added to the solution and the reaction mixture was stirred at 85 °C under nitrogen for 24 h. The solvent DMF was removed by rotary evaporation under a reduced vacuum; the resulting solid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using chloroform–hexane as the eluent to get the compound (2) (72% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 10.06 (s, 1H), 7.99–7.96 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 7.85–7.84 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 1H), 7.83–7.78 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 7.74–7.70 (m, 3H), 7.62–7.58 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.45–7.44 (t, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.33–7.32 (dd, J = 6.9, 3.7 Hz, 2H), 2.85–2.77 (m, 8H), 1.63 (dd, J = 9.2, 5.5 Hz, 8H), 1.28 (m, 24H), 0.89–0.86 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 12H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 190.24, 150.14, 148.90, 143.98, 141.81, 140.48, 136.77, 136.43, 134.86, 134.52, 134.42, 133.83, 132.88,132.03, 131.71, 127.21, 126.84, 126.40, 126.29, 126.17, 126.01, 125.31, 125.16, 121.97,121.27, 91.12, 36.27, 31.33, 29.70, 28.22, 22.75, 14.08; MALDI-TOF calcd. for 1089.8 found 1090.3.

2.2. Methods and instrumentation

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz and 13C NMR on a 100 MHz INOVA spectrometer. A PC-controlled electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments model CHI620C) was used for differential pulse voltammetric measurements. 1 mM concentrations of dyes in DMF solvent were used for all electrochemical measurements at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, in which tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) is used as a supporting electrolyte. A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode, the reference electrode was a standard calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt wire was the auxillary electrode. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu (model UV-3600) spectrophotometer. Steady-state emission spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Spex model, JobinYvon) for solutions with optical density at the wavelength of excitation (λex) ≈ 0.05. Thermogravimetric measurements were carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample under a nitrogen atmosphere.

2.2.1. Computational methodology. 
All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package on a personal computer.27 Density functional theory (DFT) was adopted to optimize the ground state geometry of all three sensitizers and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) was used for the estimation of ground to excited-state transitions. Using the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set,28,29 the obtained geometries were found to be genuine global minimum structures, and were used as the input for further calculations. To obtain frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) the obtained geometries were further used and for obtaining UV-vis spectra of the dyes the obtained geometries were again subjected to single-point TDDFT studies (first 15 vertical singlet–singlet transitions). To describe the solvation of the above dyes in dichloromethane, the integral equation formalism polarisable continuum model (PCM)30,31 within the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) theory was used in the TDDFT calculations. To simulate the major portions of the absorption spectra and to interpret the nature of transitions, the software Gauss Sum 2.2.5 was employed.32,33 Also calculated are the contribution percentages of the individual units present in the dyes to the respective molecular orbitals.


2.2.2. Dye sensitized solar cell fabrication. 
A TiO2 photoelectrode with an area of 0.25 cm2 was prepared using a similar method to that reported elsewhere in the literature.34 Briefly, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrates (∼10 Ohm−2, Solaronix) were cleaned with water, ethanol and finally with 2-proponol and dried under a N2 purge. To facilitate a good mechanical contact between the nanocrystalline TiO2 and the conducting FTO glass substrate, the cleaned plates were treated with a 40 mM TiCl4 solution. By adopting the screen printing technique a transparent TiO2 film of 8 μm thickness (approximately 20 nm in diameter) was formed after sintering at 500 °C for 20 min; following this a 5 μm scattering layer of TiO2 particles (approximately 400 nm in diameter) was prepared. The thickness of the films was measured with a Surfcom 1400A surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd). Dye based solutions have been prepared at a concentration of 0.2 mM in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol. The TiO2 films were dipped into the dye solution while the photoelectrode is hot i.e., at 80 °C and then kept at room temperature for 15 h. Then the TiO2 films were removed from the dye solution and quickly rinsed with fresh solvent to remove unadsorbed dye. A sandwich cell was prepared using the dye-sensitized electrode and a platinum coated conducting glass electrode as the counter electrode, separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame at 100 °C. The electrolyte is made of a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0 M or 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and was used in each cell. To desorb the loaded G7, G8 and G9 sensitizers from the TiO2 film, we immersed them into 0.1 M TBAOH solution (a 1:1 mixture of H2O and ethanol). The quantity of the adsorbed dye in TiO2 was estimated from the UV-vis absorption peak of each resulting solution.
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the dye based solar cells were measured using a black metal mask with a total of area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan). Incident photon-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic pathways to the proposed sensitizers G7, G8 & G9 are revealed in Scheme 1 with the involvement of the Knoevenagel condensation of the exTTF-formyl precursor 2 and 4 with either cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid. The compounds 2 and 4 were prepared via a Suzuki or Sonogashira reaction of 1 or 3 with 5-(7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde using a Pd(PPh3)4/aq Na2CO3 or CuI/Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 catalyst. All precursors are pretty soluble in common organic solvents, which allowed uncomplicated purification using standard chromatographic techniques, and were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. All three new sensitizers and their precursors were totally characterized by MALDI-TOF, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV-visible, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods. The mass spectrum of G7 showed a peak at m/z = 1157 (C58H65N3O2S10), G8 at m/z = 1181 (C60H65N3O2S10) and G9 at m/z = 1157 (C60H67N3O3S12), and these were assigned to their corresponding molecular ion peaks (see Fig. S12, S15 and S18, ESI†). 1H NMR & 13C NMR spectra of all three sensitizers and their precursors are shown in Fig. S1–S17 (ESI†).

3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of all three sensitizers in DMF solvent and anchored onto nanocrystalline TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The corresponding maxima of absorption and molar extinction coefficient values are presented in Table 1. It is observed from Fig. 2a and Table 1 that all three sensitizers are red-shifted in comparison to literature reported exTTF based dyes, which is because of the extended π-conjugation in the π-spacer.19 The absorption maxima are at 442, 447, and 478 nm for G7, G8, and G9 sensitizers, respectively, and are ascribed to π–π* charge transfer transitions in the exTTF chromophores. The presence of the additional electron withdrawing rhodanine-3-acetic acid group in the G9 sensitizer has shown a red-shift in the absorption maximum when compared to the G7 sensitizer. The onset of absorption of all three sensitizers extends up to 600 nm. We have also measured the absorption maxima of all three sensitizers appended onto 8 μm thick TiO2 films, which was characteristic of the coupling of the carboxylate moiety with the semiconductor (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2a also illustrates emission spectra of all three sensitizers measured in DMF solvent at room temperature when excited at their absorption maxima and the corresponding emission maxima are presented in Table 1. Based on the optical properties, the E0–0 energy of G7, G8, and G9 sensitizers is found to be 2.33 ± 0.05, 2.35 ± 0.05 and 2.38 ± 0.05, respectively.

The electrochemical behaviour of the newly designed sensitizers was investigated by the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique (Fig. 3) in DMF solution using a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylyammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte with an internal reference to the ferrocinium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple. Each exTTF sensitizer undergoes two reversible one-electron oxidations, which are at 0.44 V and 0.85 V (vs. SCE) for G7, 0.48 V and 0.91 V (vs. SCE) for G8 and 0.41 V and 0.94 V (vs. SCE) for G9, for the consecutive formation of the TTF radical cation and dication. The first oxidation potential of G9 is cathodically shifted by 30 and 70 mV when compared to the G7 and G8 sensitizers, respectively, and this is because of the presence of the powerful electron withdrawing nature of the rhodanine-3-aceitic acid moiety in its molecular structure. Subsequently, all three oxidized dyes could, thermodynamically, be regenerated by the redox mediator, I−/I3− (+0.1 vs. SCE).35 The onset of the optical energy gap (E0–0) of the G7, G8 and G9 sensitizers is found to be 2.18 ± 0.05, 2.13 ± 0.05 and 2.33 ± 0.05 V, respectively. The excited-state oxidation potential, EOx*, of dyes G7, G8 and G9 was estimated to be −1.74 V, −1.65 V and −1.60 V (vs. SCE), which are found to lie above the conduction band edge (−0.82 V vs. SCE) of the nanocrystalline TiO2 (Table 1). Therefore, excited-state injection into the conduction band of TiO2 is possible to occur with all sensitizers G7, G8 and G9.

3.3. Theoretical studies
To understand the electronic properties of the G7, G8 and G9 dyes, DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out for all three sensitizers with a functional basis set at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. As observed from Fig. 4, the electron density distributions of G7, G8 and G9 show that the HOMO frontier orbitals are mainly located on the anthracene and dithiole units (∼98%) and marginally over the π-spacer (around ∼2%). In contrast, the LUMO is delocalized above the π-spacer containing the anchoring group, which is considered very important for efficient electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer to the conduction band of the semiconductor via the cyanoacrylic acid (G7 and G8) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid (G9) anchoring group. The energy gap of the spacer controlled dye G8 shows a low HOMO–LUMO gap (1.72 eV) compared to the without spacer dye G7 (1.87 eV), which should lead to a longer absorption wavelength. G9 (an energy gap of 1.88 eV) contains rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an anchoring group with a benzothiadiazol-thiophene spacer. The optimized structures of these sensitizers have been observed as flying bird like structures having hexyl substituted dithiafulvalene at the 9,10 position of anthracene and two π-conjugated spacers such as thiophene-benzo-thiadiazole and ethynyl-thiophene-benzo-thiadiazole inserted between the anchoring group (cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid) and the 2nd position of the anthracene moiety. The optimized structures and electrostatic potential maps of the G7, G8, and G9 sensitizers are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 4  The energy gap (in eV) of the G7, G8 and G9 dyes. 
The HOMO levels of the G7, G8, and G9 sensitizers are at a comparable energy level while the LUMO of G8 is lower than the remaining two sensitizers (G7 and G9), which is due to the extended π-conjugation in the spacer. The anthracene group is bent perpendicular to the 9 and 10 position axis with an angle of ∼67°, because of the steric assembly of hexyl-substituted dithiafulvalene. The steric assembly of thioalkyl units may possibly retard the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with oxidized dye. Recently, porphyrin based sensitizers have been reported by Grätzel and co-workers. They introduced a benzothiadiazole group with a similar steric assembly of alkoxy units over the porphyrin sensitizer which resulted in a PCE of 13% in a DSSC because of the minimization of recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with the oxidized porphyrin sensitizer.36 Based on the positive aspects obtained from TDDFT studies, detailed calculations of these sensitizers were carried out by using the B3LYP energy functional with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set in order to gain a deeper understanding of the excited-state transitions within the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM) in DMF as a solvent. The results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), where the singlet state properties of all three dyes in terms of the maximum wavelength absorbance, oscillation strength (f), excited state energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and the percentage contribution of molecular orbitals for each dye segment have been computed from the frontier molecular orbitals by using the GaussSum software. Fig. S19 (ESI†) shows a comparison of theoretical and experimental UV-visible spectra, which are comparatively similar to each other. These favourable optical and photo-electrochemical properties motivated us to fabricate dye sensitized solar cells, which has been discussed in the following sections.
3.4. Photovoltaic performance
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by using G7, G8, or G9 as sensitizers with a volatile liquid electrolyte. The electrolyte was prepared by mixing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazoliumiodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyryidine (TBP) in acetonitrile. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) and J–V curves of these DSSCs fabricated with these dyes are shown in Fig. 5a and b and the corresponding J–V parameters are summarized in Table 2.

The presence of TBP in the I−/I3− electrolyte shifts the TiO2 conduction band edge and enhances the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.37Fig. 5a illustrates IPCE spectra of all three sensitizers without TBP and with 0.5 M TBP. It was observed that the devices without TBP performed better when compared to 0.5 M TBP in the redox electrolyte for all three sensitizers. At a wavelength of 470 nm, the G7 based DSSC shows an IPCE of 89%, with an 85% IPCE for G8 (at 490 nm) and ∼80% for G9 (at 510 nm) based DSSCs. The onset of the IPCE extends up to 700 nm for G7 and G8 based DSSCs, whereas the G9 based DSSC showed an onset up to 750 nm. The red-shifted onset of G9 might be due to the presence of the electron withdrawing rhodanine acetic acid moiety in its molecular structure. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs fabricated with either the G7, G8, or G9 sensitizers measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5b, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2.
The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of these three sensitizers oscillate between 5.38 and 6.00%, which is comparable to the other reported tetrathiafulvalene based DSSCs. From Table 2, it was observed that the short-circuit current density (JSC) was enhanced from 10.95 mA cm−2 to 13.75 mA cm−2 for the G7 to the G9 sensitizer, because of the high molar extinction coefficient and the onset of the IPCE extending up to the 800 nm region for G9. Interestingly, the open-circuit potential (VOC) of these sensitizers G7 (0.671 V), G8 (0.667 V) and G9 (0.642 V) has not been much affected. The VOC of the DSSCs fabricated with G7 and G8 is slightly higher than that of the G9 based DSSC. The high PCE of G7, G8 and G9 is because of the thioalkyl group wrapping over the anthracene π-spacer, which in turn may prevent recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. Recombination studies show the quick regeneration of oxidized dye due to the redox couple, which is an important factor in enhancing the efficiency of solar cells. Among all the sensitizers, G9 has shown the highest PCE of 6.00% due to the red-shifted absorption spectrum in solution (from 442 to 478 nm) as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The enhanced efficiency over the Grätzel and co-workers reported exTTF derivatives is because these exTTF derivatives have thioalkyl groups that cover the anthracene moiety and thereby prevent recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. In this work, we have not used any co-adsorbent to minimize aggregation phenomena. Liu et al. have utilized chenodoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent to minimize aggregation for their quinoxaline-fused TTF sensitizer.20 The efficiency of G7 is enhanced over the G5 and G6 sensitizers due to the introduction of the benzo-thiadiazole (BTZ) group between the donor and the anchoring group over thiophene, which helps to stabilize the HOMO–LUMO gap.21,22 However, the efficiency of G9 is lower when compared to G3, probably due to greater stabilization of the LUMO in G3 and also the enhanced JSC.21,22 It is notable that DSSC devices with TBP in the electrolyte had an enhanced VOC value, but a decreased JSC value for all G7, G8 and G9 sensitizers, which resulted in a lower PCE.37
3.5. CEM and IMVS measurements
The relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of the charge extraction method (CEM) has been used to further investigate the effect on VOC with the corresponding changes in the molecular structures of G7, G8 and G9 dye based DSSCs. VOC as a function of electron density for DSSCs fabricated with the G7, G8 and G9 sensitizers is shown in Fig. 6. A linear rise in VOC as a function of electron density for all DSSCs was observed. This result specified that the sensitizer contribution to the band edge shift is approximately comparable as the plots for all dyes overlapped with each other, in spite of various spacers between the donor tetrathiafulvalene and anchoring group. As a result, the VOC is more probably dependent on charge recombination reactions rather than the molecular structures of the dyes. Consequently, the VOC for all DSSCs fabricated with either G7, G8 and G9 should be attributed to the extent of charge recombination, which is ultimately related to the electron lifetime (τ) in TiO2. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was performed to measure τ for the DSSCs fabricated with these dyes. Fig. 7 shows the electron lifetime (τ) as a function of VOC. At a certain VOC, τ follows the following order: G7 > G8 > G9, which is in accord with the order of decreasing VOC observed in the corresponding DSSCs. The longer lifetime observed for the G7 and G8 DSSCs compared to the lifetimes observed for G9 suggest that the G7 and G8 dyes with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group adequately suppressed the recombination of electrons at the TiO2 surface with I3− ions in the electrolyte and resulted in a higher VOC compared to the G9 based DSSC. The results of the desorption experiment suggested that the amounts of loaded sensitizer are approximately the same for the G7, G8 and G9 dyes and are in the range of 1.17–1.23 × 10−7 mol cm−2.

These results are consistent with the earlier adsorption results when anchored onto TiO2,22 which suggests that the G7 and G8 dyes with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring group may form a compact dye layer on the TiO2 surface and suppress the electron recombination, while G9 with rhodanine acetic acid may aggregate on the TiO2 surface leaving uncovered space for the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 with I3− ions in the electrolyte.
3.6. Dynamic study
Superior performance of a DSSC is effectively related to the efficiency of charge injection from the π*-orbitals of the anchoring groups of the G7–G9 sensitizers to the titanium 3d-orbitals of the TiO2 film substrates. A good overlap of these orbitals is thus required. In this regard, we adopted a laser flash photolysis instrument from Eidenburg (LP920) in order to study and collaborate both the interfacial electron transfer kinetics of waste recombination routes and the useful dye regeneration process by the electrolyte for all the G7–G9 sensitizers in comparison with the respective DSSC PV performance and their electronic levels. Laser flash photolysis has become, since several years, a perfect tool for examining DSSC interfacial electron transfer kinetics and has been considered as one of the important steps for measuring the DSSC performance.38–41
The differential transient absorption signals, ΔOD, are shown in Fig. 8 and correspond to the concentration of oxidized dye (ΔOD > 0). The transient absorption signals of the bleached ground state of the dye has not shown because of their poor signals (both must have similar decay lifetimes). In our study, we found it imperative to use a high enough laser intensity to record consistent transient absorbance signals. As it has been previously noticed by the Grätzel group,42 this high laser energy use would not cause a significant change in the decay rate. As for the fitting of the transient decay graphs, a good approach has been recently adopted to compare quantitatively the transient decay data for different dyes.43,44 For this, we adopted the weighted average of logarithmic lifetimes from a biexponential fit to the datalog〈τ〉 = ∑Ailog(τi)where Ai represents the fractional amplitude for each decay component related to different interfacial kinetics.
 Fig. 8  Transient absorbance decay profiles obtained upon nano-second pulsed laser excitation (bandwidth 6 ns) on mesoporous TiO2 (7 μm) substrates sensitized with G7, G8 and G9 dyes with laser excitation of 445 nm and monitoring at 600 and 700 nm in the presence and in the absence of the LiI/I2 electrolyte (dyesol high performance electrolyte, ELHP; no TBP added). 
The absorption decays in the absence of electrolyte (Fig. 8) show half-times (τ1/2) of 14.5, 7.84 and 12.6 μs, implying the non-wanted recombination process of the injected charges into the TiO2 conduction band with the G7–G9 oxidative dyes, respectively. In the presence of electrolyte, faster decays of dye regeneration have been measured with half-times (τ1/2) 0.94, 0.73 and 1.2 μs. The latter prove clearly that dye regeneration by the electrolyte was really effective. In consequence, a good photocurrent is extracted into an external circuit as revealed in the PV performance (Table 2). All dyes do corroborate in terms of collected current density with the dye regeneration lifetime (a lower lifetime allows a higher current to be extracted), except for the G9 dye, where the lifetime is slightly larger than the others, showing a higher current collected. This is mainly due to the fact that G9 shows a red extended IPCE spectrum, which has compensated somehow for the eventual loss of performance due to the lower relative dye regeneration lifetime. In the presence of the electrolyte (Fig. 8), the absorption decays of the regeneration of the G7–G9 dyes, respectively, have been measured with half-times (τ1/2) 0.94, 0.73 and 1.2 μs. The recombination decay times recorded corroborate with typical time constants (10−4 s) of DSSCs under working conditions (1 sun).38
3.7. Thermogravimetric analysis
As a final study, the thermal stability of a DSSC is a vital question for up-scaling and commercialization at present. We have studied the thermal stability of newly designed dyes by using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), which is essential for rooftop applications. It is documented in the literature that tetrathiafulvalene derivatives are thermally stable.35Fig. 9 illustrates the TGA curves of the sensitizers from 35 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere. It is clearly shown that all the three sensitizers are stable up to 200 °C. The initial weight loss (∼3%) observed between 200 and 250 °C is due to the removal of moisture. Among metal-free organic sensitizer based DSSCs, tetrathiafulvalene based molecules are thermally stable and are probable candidates for rooftop applications. It is clear from the thermal data that the G7, G8 and G9 dyes are highly durable for long-term stability; this allows easy DSSC manufacturing and outstanding outdoor applications.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we studied a rational approach for systematically improving the current density (JSC) of exTTF based DSSCs by varying the π-spacers and anchoring groups. The onset of the IPCE extends up to 720 nm, 740 nm, and 750 nm for G7, G8, and G9 based DSSCs, respectively. This has reflected well with enhanced PCEs of these sensitizers in the range of 5.38% to 6.00%. The G9 sensitizer illustrates efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 over the whole visible range extending up to 800 nm. Among the three sensitizers, G9 showed the highest PCE of 6.0% with a JSC of 13.75 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.642 V and a FF of 0.679. The improved JSC of the G9 sensitizer was achieved by the presence of the powerful electron withdrawing rhodanine-3-acetic acid group in its molecular structure. These sensitizers are thermally stable up to 200 °C, which was reflected in the durability of the devices. We hope that this study will contribute to the improvement of exTTF sensitizer based DSSC research.
