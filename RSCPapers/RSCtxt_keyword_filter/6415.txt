    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractAtomization of noble metals enable their electrocatalysis applications with low cost, whereas the isolated mononuclear site after atomization might lead leads to limited performance. Herein, we present a general strategy of atomically confined alloying (ACA) to synthesize an electrocatalyst of single atom iridium-trapping cobalt nanosheets with dual-reactive Ir–Co sites. The atomic Ir@Co nanosheets (1.7 wt% Ir) exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a small overpotential (273 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and high stability, higher than that of the Ir/C catalyst (290 mV at 10 mA cm−2). More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experiments demonstrated that water oxidation proceeded on atomic Ir@Co nanosheets via a dinuclear tandem mechanism, in which Ir–Co dual sites cooperatively worked in favour of the sequential transfer from Co–OH* to Ir–O* via a Co–O–Ir intermediate, and stabilization of OOH* species by hydrogen bonding interaction. The cooperative mechanism based on a dinuclear electrocatalyst by ACA is hoped to open up more possibilities of single atom noble metal electrocatalysts for various applications.
Introduction
Water oxidation is the key step in many electrochemical conversion processes such as hydrogen production, artificial nitrogen fixation and simulated photosynthesis. Benchmark noble metals of Ir and Ru are highly active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),1,2 but suffer from scarcity and high cost.3–6 Downsizing noble metals towards atomization is regarded as a promising strategy for increasing their utilization,7 and suitable substrates with strong interactions to stabilize the noble metal single atoms are a requisite.8,9 However, this atomization method has another issue: mononuclear electrocatalysis generally prevails at a limited activity in a stabilized single atom electrocatalyst, which is due to the negligible influence between few isolated single atoms far apart from each other and relatively reactivity-inert substrates.
Introducing a second metal is a commonly used approach to improve the OER activity of noble metal Ir and has received extensive research attention.10–15 Unfortunately, noble metal single atoms alloyed with secondary active monomers are still under-explored, let alone for the OER. This circumstance reminds us of the limitations of most synthetic methods without consideration of multi-site synergy. For example, the N species16 and phosphomolybdic acid17 on carbon materials, and amine groups of metal–organic frameworks,18 were used to coordinate and anchor noble metal single atoms, while these moieties themselves are inert. Recently, cooperative effects of dinuclear sites were reported using the Au/TiO2 catalyst for CO oxidation19 and the Pt/MoS2 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.20 Moreover, a few transition metal complexes have been claimed to show high OER activity on the basis of crucial multinuclear sites in accelerating the O–O bond formation.21 These successful but very limited examples suggest the possibility of cooperatively catalyzing the OER using a noble metal single atom alloy electrocatalyst via modifying the reaction barrier and paths, which remains highly promising to explore.
Herein, we make use of Co nanosheets with the surface oxygen vacancy serving as atomically confined sites for chemically alloying Ir (1.7 wt%) to synthesize Ir@Co nanosheets. This atomically confined alloying (ACA) strategy leads to the atomic dispersion of Ir with a nine-coordinated configuration in Ir@Co nanosheets as revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Ir@Co for the OER was revealed, with a small overpotential (273 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and high stability, higher than that of the Ir/C catalyst (290 mV at 10 mA cm−2). The dinuclear tandem mechanism via a sequential delivery model in the Ir–Co single atom alloy was further demonstrated with the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experiments.
Experimental
Synthesis of Co-R and Co-A
4.8 g of cobalt chloride hydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) was dissolved in 80 ml of H2O, this solution was degassed using argon for 1 h and cooled down to 0 °C. 1.48 g of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and 0.26 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) were mixed together, and dissolved in 20 ml of H2O. Afterwards, the alkaline NaBH4 solution was slowly dropped into the Co2+ solution with stirring for 1 h. The resultant suspension was filtered and washed with H2O and ethanol several times to obtain Co-R. Co-A was prepared by annealing Co-R in Ar/H2 (10%) at 250 °C for 4 h.
Synthesis of Ir@Co nanosheets
In a typical synthesis of Ir@Co nanosheets, 100 mg of Co-R was dispersed in 100 ml of H2O under ultrasonic stirring for 0.5 h. 7.5 mg of dipotassium hexachloroiridate (K2IrCl6) was dissolved in 20 ml of H2O. The K2IrCl6 solution was dropped into the Co-R suspension, and was kept stirring for 24 h at room temperature. Then the mixture was filtered and washed with H2O several times. The filter residue was put in a clean porcelain crucible and placed at the centre of a quartz tube furnace, which was then rinsed with Ar/H2 (10%) three times. The temperature was ramped up to 250 °C at 5 °C min−1 at 30 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) with Ar/H2 feeding. The temperature was maintained for 4 h and then the sample was allowed to naturally cool to prepare Ir@Co nanosheets.
An Ir nanoparticle/Co nanosheet material was synthesized by the same method except that seven times the amount of dipotassium hexachloroiridate was used followed by immediate reduction with excess NaBH4.
Synthesis of Ir/C
67 wt% concentrated nitric acid was diluted two times and then used to oxidize the active carbon of Vulcan XC-72R at 110 °C for 12 h. The pre-treated active carbon was used to prepare Ir/C. In a detailed procedure, 29 mg of K2IrCl6 was mixed with 46 mg of pre-treated carbon in 100 ml of H2O under ultrasonic stirring for 0.5 h. An excess NaBH4 solution was dropped into the mixture to reduce Ir4+ ions on the carbon surface. The reaction was performed for 48 h at room temperature. The Ir/C material with a loading of 20 wt% was obtained by filtering, washing the mixture and drying overnight.
Characterization
An Ultima2 inductively coupled plasma OES spectrometer (ICP-OES, Jobin Yvon) was used to determine the metal contents in the material. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used to analyze the morphology and structure. The corresponding element distribution can be obtained using the equipped microanalyser with a resolution power of 129 eV. Aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM) was carried out using an 80 keV JEM ARM200F equipped with a spherical aberration corrector. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to analyze the morphology of the catalytic materials by using a JEOL-6700F. The two-dimensional morphology and thickness of the material were observed using a scanning probe microscope (SPM, Dimension Icon). The nanosheet morphology and height profile were studied by atomic force microscopy (AMF, Agilent-5500). Chemical valences of the elements in the materials were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 250). An Al K X-ray source of 1487 eV was employed and a chamber pressure was maintained below 3 × 10−10 mbar in the test. Specific correction was done by using a C 1s binding energy of 284.8 eV. A Philip X'Pert Pro MPP diffractometer was used for collecting X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, at a scan rate of 2° min−1, with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) as the radiation source. The specific surface area of the material was analyzed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement, using automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Micromeritics, ASAP2020) at −196 °C. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was used for the calculation of the pore size distribution.
Electrochemical measurements
A three-electrode electrolytic cell connected with a CHI 660e electrochemical working station (CH Instrument Inc.) was used for electrochemical measurements. In the cell, a Ag/AgCl electrode saturated with KCl, and a Pt net (1 cm2) were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrode employed was a glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a diameter of 4 mm, coated with the prepared catalysts. For preparation of the working electrode, 10 mg of the as-prepared material was dispersed in 950 μl of isopropanol and 50 μl of 5 wt% Nafion solution (DuPont, USA). 4 μl of the slurry was pipetted using a micro-syringe to spread on the polished GC electrode surface, followed by drying the electrode under an infrared lamp (the catalyst loading is 0.3 mg cm−2). 1 M KOH aqueous solution saturated with oxygen was used as the test electrolyte. The equation of ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.2 + 0.059pH was used to convert the potentials vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All measurements were conducted at room temperature, with IR-drop correction.
For photovoltaic cell-driven overall water splitting, the as-made Ir@Co250 catalyst was adsorbed on Ni foam (1 cm2) and used as the anode for water oxidation; a Pt plate (1 cm2) was used as the cathode for water reduction. The set-up was powered using a commercial-available polycrystalline silicon solar cell with a geometric dimension of 14.6 cm2, open circuit potential of 2.0 V and short circuit current density of 5 mA cm−2.
The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) test (Dalian Elite Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd) was performed after electrolysis. First, 2 mg of the as-prepared catalyst was coated onto Ni foam (1 cm−2) which was first treated using 1 M HCl solution under ultrasonication for 30 min. The aqueous solution of 1 M KOH + 12.5 mM benzyl alcohol was prepared and used as the electrolyte for filling into a two-compartment electrochemical cell, in which the anode and cathode were separated by a Nafion membrane. The catalyst-coated Ni foam and a Pt net were used as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The current was set at 20 mA during the test. 1 ml of the tested electrolyte was taken at 0, 60 and 120 min for the HPLC test at room temperature. In the HPLC test, the mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.75 ml min−1.
DFT calculations
The electronic structures of all catalysts were calculated using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). All calculations were carried out with the PBE exchange-correlation function (the 1996 functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof) on periodically repeated slabs.22 All periodic slabs possess a vacuum spacing larger than 15 Å. The structural model for Co (oxide) contains four Co layers, one O layer (44 atoms) and a single atom Ir. The Co layers have parameters of a = b = 7.518, c = 21.138, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. In calculations, the two bottom layers were kept fixed, whereas the rest of the atoms were allowed to relax. All structures were fully relaxed to the ground state. The convergence of energy and forces was set to 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively. An energy cut-off of 400 eV and gamma k-point sampling were found to provide convergent geometry. An effective U parameter of 4.0 eV (for Co) and 2.0 eV (for Ir) and spin were applied for d/f states to describe well the electronic structure of the model.
The microkinetic processes of the water-oxidation reaction were modelled with the path used by Nørskov and co-workers,23–25 which was also applied to 2D phosphorus porous polymorphs,26 carbon nitride monolayers27 and graphitic carbon nitride supported single-atom materials.28 The half-reaction equation of the OER is decomposed into four one-electron steps (OER-1–OER-4) with each step generating one H+ and an electron, listed as below: * + OH− → OH* + e−(OER-1) OH* + OH−→ O* + H2O(l) + e−(OER-2) O* + OH− → OOH* + e−(OER-3) OOH* + OH− → * + O2(g) + H2O(l) + e−(OER-4)
The Gibbs free energy change of ΔGi for each reaction step can be described asΔGi = ΔEi + ΔZPEi + TΔSi + ΔGu + ΔGpHwhere ΔEi refers to the DFT calculated reaction energy, ΔZPEi represents zero point energy change, T is the temperature and ΔSi is the entropy change, ΔGu = −eU (U, the potential of the photo-generated electrons/holes relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and ΔGpH = 2.303kBT × pH (kB, the Boltzmann constant). The entropies of free molecules can be acquired from the NIST database at http://cccbdb.nist.gov/, and the energy contribution from the configuration entropy in the adsorbed state was not involved. As generally-accepted, the overpotential (η) for the OER can be calculated as follows:η = max [ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4]/e − 1.23[V]
This is independent of pH, and thus applicable to water-oxidation under alkaline conditions.
Results and discussion
The synthesis processes for atomic Ir@Co nanosheets by the ACA strategy are shown in Fig. S1,† and the detailed synthetic information is provided in the Experimental section. The Co nanosheets were first prepared by reducing cobalt dichloride using alkaline sodium borohydride. The processes of adsorption and heat reduction of Ir4+ (K2IrCl6) ions on Co nanosheets were followed to form Ir@Co nanosheets. The final Ir loading in the optimized product determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was 1.7 wt%, while the Ir loading in the Ir/C catalyst was determined to be 23.9 wt% for comparison.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were first carried out to verify the crystalline structures of the synthetic samples. The XRD pattern of the Ir@Co nanosheets is shown in Fig. S2.† The three main peaks correspond to Co (111), Co (100) and Co (101) planes, which is in good agreement with the SAED analysis (Fig. S3†), respectively. Typical SEM and TEM images depicted in Fig. 1a and S3† reveal numerous distinctly flexible and crumbled nanosheets with a lateral size of 200–300 nm. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image in Fig. 1b displayed some visibly bright spots, suggesting that the single atom Ir is uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of Co nanosheets. In contrast, Ir in the Ir/C sample displays nanoparticle dispersion, as shown in Fig. S5.† Additionally, the XRD pattern of Ir/C is depicted in Fig. S6.† The four main peaks correspond to C (002), Ir (111), Ir (200) and Ir (220) planes. It is worth noting that the XRD pattern of Ir@Co nanosheets depicted none of the aforementioned Ir-related peaks, further substantiating its atomically-dispersed state, as single Ir atoms on the surface would not produce typical Ir lattice reflections using standard XRD. A similar result was revealed in the Au/TiO2 system.29 Further, as shown in Fig. 1c the thickness of the atomic Ir@Co nanosheets was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and is 2.5 nm. Such an ultrathin nanosheet structure endows Ir@Co with a relatively large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 67.57 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4†).The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images of Ir@Co nanosheets in Fig. 1d indicate uniform dispersion of Ir, O and Co elements on the nanosheets. Overall, we successfully synthesized atomically dispersed Ir on partially oxidized Co nanosheets. These ultrathin nanosheets can maximally expose the active sites and promote the electrocatalytic properties.

The surface bonds and electron structure properties were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As described in Fig. S7,† the presence of Ir, Co and O peaks was revealed. The O 1s spectra in Fig. 2a with a distinct peak centred at around 531 eV can be deconvoluted into four peaks, related to four kinds of oxygen species designated as O1–O4 (Fig. 2a), which were ascribed to lattice oxygen atoms bound to Co (529.8 eV for O1, O2−), defective oxygen with a low coordination (531.0 eV for O2, O22−/O−), surface-adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl groups (531.6 eV for O3, OH− or O2), and oxygen from adsorbed H2O (532.6 eV for O4, H2O), respectively.30 Annealing processing probably increases the amount of oxygen defects in Co-A compared to Co-R. However, the ratio of O2 species decreased in Ir@Co oxide nanosheets as compared to both Co-R and Co-A (Table S1†), which indicates that single atom Ir was likely trapped in oxygen vacancies in the Ir@Co oxide nanosheets. Besides, a general increase in the number of O3 and O4 species in Ir@Co oxide was found, compared to the Co-R and Co-A samples as shown Table S1.† This result suggests the favourable affinity of Ir@Co oxide nanosheets with H2O/OH− adsorption, which is beneficial for the hydroxyl adsorption step in electrocatalysis.

In the Co 2p and Ir 4f XPS spectra (Fig. 2b and S8†), Co species were revealed to consist of metallic Co and Co oxides. Ir 4f peaks at 60.4, 63.15, 62.25, and 65.1 eV, are assigned to Ir 4f7/2, Ir 4f5/2, Ir4+ 4f7/2, and Ir4+ 4f5/2, respectively. The Co 2p peak shows a slight positive shift of ca. 0.7 eV on Ir@Co compared to that of Co-R and Co-A, meanwhile, the Ir 4f peak exhibits a negative shift (Fig. S8a†), relative to IrOx–Ir reported in the literature.31 These Co 2p and Ir 4f peak shifts suggest their strong interaction and the partial electron transfer from Co to Ir probably via the Co–Ir alloy. Such electron transfer could possibly tune the Ir electronic structure and then manipulate the intrinsic activity of Ir during electrocatalysis.
The precise structure of Ir species in the Ir@Co oxide nanosheets was further confirmed by extended X-ray fine structure absorption (EXAFS) measurements (Fig. 2c). The intensity of the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum at the Ir L3-edge of Ir@Co oxide nanosheets is higher than that of standard Ir black whereas it is lower than that of standard IrO2, demonstrating the coexistence of Ir0 species and positively charged Ir species, while the Ir0 species was alloyed with Co.32
The average valence state of Ir in the Ir@Co oxide nanosheets was determined to be 0.8. Further, the pertaining Fourier transform (FT) curve of the Ir L3-edge for Ir@Co oxide nanosheets in the R space is shown in Fig. 2d. It demonstrates the short-range (below 4 Å) local geometry structure of Ir in the as-prepared atomic Ir@Co nanosheet samples. The FT curve of Ir@Co is significantly different from the corresponding reference samples, thus establishing the difference in the arrangement of Ir atoms.33 The major peak for Ir@Co nanosheets centred at around 2.20 Å can be attributed to the formation of the Ir–Co metal bond, which is shorter than the Ir–Ir bond (2.47 Å) in standard Ir black while longer than that of the Ir–O bond (1.63 Å) in standard IrO2. The coordination number of Ir was determined to be ca. 8.8 ± 1.2. The fitting parameters of EXAFS data were listed in Table S2.† These results demonstrate the formation of a single atom Ir–Co alloy in Ir@Co nanosheets with a multi-coordination configuration.
To evaluate the OER electrocatalytic performance after alloying single atom Ir with Co nanosheets, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed in a three electrode set-up with 1 M KOH, compared to the as-prepared Ir/C, Ir nanoparticles/Co nanosheets and Co-R samples. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S9,† the LSV curve of atomic Ir@Co nanosheets with IR compensation manifests the lowest onset potential, and the four-electron pathway for water oxidation as the hydrogen peroxide intermediate was not determined from the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) test (Fig. S10a†). Atomic Ir@Co nanosheets gave the smallest overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm−2, better than Ir/C (290 mV) and Co-R (393 mV) and comparable to other state-of-the-art OER catalysts.34,35 The atomic Ir@Co has obviously higher OER activity than Ir nanoparticles/Co nanosheets (Fig. S9†), revealing the key role of atomic dispersion of Ir and making it an excellent OER catalyst (Table S3†). Additionally, the polarization curves were fitted to the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where b is the Tafel slope), as depicted in Fig. 3b, and the Tafel plot of atomic Ir@Co nanosheets exhibits the lowest slope of 99 mV dec−1, compared to the benchmark Ir/C (101 mV dec−1) and the parent Co-R sample (141 mV dec−1), demonstrating its faster kinetics for the OER, and the rate determining step is probably at the second step in which transformation of hydroxyl into adsorbed O* takes place.

The OER stability of atomic Ir@Co nanosheets was studied as shown in Fig. 3c and S10b.† The results indicate that atomic Ir@Co nanosheets have relatively high OER stability with stable operating potential/current during the test. Further, a two electrode water splitting set-up fabricated using Ir@Co and a Pt plate yielded an outstanding faradaic efficiency of 97.1% for O2 production over the time scale of the measurement (Fig. S10c†). For practical application, a photovoltaic cell-driven water splitting set-up based on the Ir@Co nanosheet anode and Pt/C cathode was demonstrated, as shown in Fig. S10d.† The hydrogen production rate reached 58.33 μl min−1, and the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was up to ∼1.19%.
To comprehend the excellent performance, the OER mechanism-related electrochemical properties, such as electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), electrochemical activation energy (Ea) and interface impedance, have been investigated. As shown in Fig. S11,† the calculated electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of Ir@Co is 106 μF cm−2, higher than that of Co-R (82.6 μF cm−2), demonstrating its bigger ECSA and more surface-accessible active sites on Ir@Co. As shown in Fig. 3d and S11,† the electrochemical activation energy (Ea) of Ir@Co nanosheets for the OER at the overpotential of 270 mV is 19.6 kJ mol−1, much lower than that of Co-R (48.8 kJ mol−1), in accordance with the overpotential values presented in Fig. 3a. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shown in Fig. S12† indicates almost identical plots, suggesting the similar charge transfer characteristics. The aforesaid discussions provide credible information that the second step for *O formation was probably the rate-determining step during the OER on the atomic Ir@Co nanosheets.36
To further demonstrate the universality of electrooxidation enhancement in single atom Ir on Co nanosheets, benzyl alcohol oxidation (BAO) which could be used as an alternative reaction to the OER37 was also performed in 12.5 mM BA + 1 M KOH solution. As can be seen from Fig. S13,† LSV curves of Ir/C and Co-R show slight negative shifts of ca. 10 and 50 mV at 10 mA cm−2 as compared to OER curves in 1 M KOH solution, indicating the weak electro-catalytic oxidation ability of Ir/C and Co-R for BA. On the other hand, the atomic Ir@Co material gives a negative shift of ca. 200 mV, showing dramatically enhanced BAO activity with a synergistic effect. The Ir@Co material also provides useable stability for BAO (Fig. S14†). Based on the outstanding BAO activity on the Ir@Co electrode, the voltage of overall water splitting can be reduced from 1.65 V at 10 mA cm−2 (overall water splitting) to 1.54 V, as demonstrated in Fig. S14.† This extent of activity enhancement in water splitting is smaller compared to the three-electrode test, probably due to the increase of resistance in the system. In order to analyze the oxidation products of BA, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) test was also conducted (Fig. S13†). The results showed that benzaldehyde and benzoic acid were the unique products, and the production rates for benzoic acid and benzaldehyde were calculated to be 85.12 and 50.9 mmol h−1, respectively (see Fig. S13,†). These results show that single atom Ir on Co nanosheets could not only promote the OER, but also enhance BAO in synergy for more hydrogen production at a lower voltage.
To get an in-depth understanding on the OER mechanism of Ir@Co nanosheets with a single atom Ir–Co alloy, density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been performed to investigate the electronic structure, free energies for intermediate adsorption and variation of Gibbs free energy in those elementary steps. The model of atomic Ir@Co nanosheets was constructed based on the structural information from XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and XANES as depicted in Fig. 4a. The pertaining Gibbs free energy changes in the OER processes of atomic Ir@Co nanosheets and Ir/C are shown in Fig. 4b. As evidenced in the figure, the required activation energy in the rate-determining step is far less (1.76 eV) for atomic Ir@Co nanosheets as compared to Ir/C (2.77 eV). The negative Gibbs free energy for atomic Ir@Co nanosheets suggests the spontaneous adsorption of hydroxyl group, suggesting that the first step of the OER becomes thermodynamically favorable compared to Ir/C, which provides the basis for the concerted catalysis of Ir and Co. The formation of O* turns out to be the most energy intensive step and thus becomes the rate-limiting step for the water oxidation reaction, which fits with the Tafel analysis.
 Fig. 4  (a) The Gibbs free energy changes (ΔGi/eV, pH = 0, U = 0) of each reaction step involved in the OER processes on Ir@Co nanosheets and Ir/C. (b) The OER processes on the Ir@Co nanosheet model. 
The calculated overpotential value is 0.53 V. It is noteworthy that the hydroxyl group tends to adsorb on the Co sites and then dissociates into adsorbed O* (Fig. 4a), which further bonds/transfers to Ir sites for further combining OH− to form the Ir–OOH intermediate. In addition, the Co surface oxygen atoms adjacent to Ir could act as a hydrogen acceptor, which is conducive to the stabilization of OOH* due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between OOH* and that acceptor (O on the Ir@Co surface) (Fig. 4a). In this way, the potential needed for O2 formation was brought down, thereby expediting OER. Deviating from the traditional mechanism, in the as-proposed dinuclear tandem pathway via a sequential delivery model, the atomic Ir–Co alloy moiety is the cooperatively active site on the atomic Ir@Co nanosheets. The exceptional transfer of Co–OH* to Ir–O* within the Co–Ir–O moiety reduced the free energy for OER intermediate adsorption, thus facilitating the formation of the Co–O–Ir transition state and stabilizing the subsequently formed OOH* by hydrogen bonding with the adjacent lattice oxygen, ultimately expediting the OER. Notably, in contrast to the tandem mechanism via dinuclear Ir–Co sites, Ir/C follows the well documented traditional route (Fig. S15†) as reported in many previous studies.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized atomic Ir@Co nanosheets (1.7 wt%) with a dinuclear Ir–Co alloyed moiety via a general ACA strategy, and found that the dinuclear electrocatalyst exhibits high OER activity with a small overpotential (273 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and good stability, higher than that of the benchmark Ir/C (290 mV at 10 mA cm−2). Mechanistic studies demonstrate that dinuclear Ir–Co sites can cooperatively propel the sequential transfer of Co–OH* to Ir–O* via a Co–O–Ir intermediate, and stabilize OOH* by hydrogen bonding, ultimately expediting the OER. Our results are expected to open a new avenue for the fabrication of other single atom di-/multi-nuclear tandem electrocatalysts with high efficiency.
