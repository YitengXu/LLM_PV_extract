    , Accepted 20th December 2018First published on 21st December 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells assembled with titanium dioxide electron transport layer exhibited brilliant photovoltaic properties due to titanium dioxide having a high electron mobility, appropriate energy level alignment and easy fabrication procedure. However, inherent instability exists in titanium dioxide-based perovskite solar cells because of the ultraviolet photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide. This results in recombination at the interface of titanium dioxide/perovskite. In this report, the down-conversion nanocrystals film made of europium-doped sodium yttrium fluoride was deposited on the non-conducting side of the conducting glass. The down-conversion nanocrystal layer could absorb high energy ultraviolet photons and converted them to visible light. The layer not only extended the spectral response range for perovskite solar cells but also alleviated the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide. The perovskite solar cells with the down-conversion nanocrystals film generated average power conversion efficiency yield of 19.99%, which is much better than that of the device without the down-conversion nanocrystals film (16.99%). The best power conversion efficiency for the device with the down-conversion nanocrystals film was 20.17%. In addition, perovskite solar cells with the down-conversion nanocrystals film showed a small hysteresis.
1. Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite has been considered a uniquely promising light-absorption material due to outstanding optoelectronic properties such as a suitable band gap, high charge carrier mobilities and a high light absorption coefficient.1–3 Over the past few years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable progress with a 23.3% certified power conversion efficiency (PCE).4 In general, PSCs are composed of a electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite light absorption layer, hole transport layer (HTL) and contact electrode. In this typical structure, organometal halide perovskite light absorption materials mainly give a response to the visible region, which accounts for approximately 45% of solar irradiation. More than 50% of solar irradiation cannot be fully utilized by perovskite light absorption materials.5 As a result, improving the utilization of sunlight is an important route to enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In addition, ETL is responsible for collecting photogenerated electrons from the perovskite light absorption layer and transferring the electrons to the contact electrode. At present, the most popular electron transport material is TiO2 on account of its stable chemical properties and low fabrication cost.5,6 However, the inherent instability of TiO2-based PSCs under ultra-violet (UV) light irradiation is well known.7 The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 results in recombination at the interface of the TiO2/perovskite light absorption layer.8,9 Researchers have addressed a series of solutions to solve the problem. Electron transport materials have been developed as substitutes for TiO2, including ZnO,10,11 SnO2,12,13 Cr2O3,14 CdS,15,16 BaSnO3,17,18 SrTiO319 and Zn2SnO4.20 However, this method cannot enhance the utilization of sunlight. Regulating the composition of organometal halide perovskite may result in the full use of sunlight.21,22 Upconversion nanomaterials can absorb near-infrared light, and then emit visible light. Therefore, the incorporation of upconversion nanomaterials in PSC may serve as an effective pathway to broaden the absorption of PSCs.23,24 Unfortunately, these methods may not overcome the UV light instability of PSCs.
In order to simultaneously solve the two problems, down-conversion materials can be effectively introduced on the back of the FTO (non-conducting side). In 2014, Chander and co-workers introduced a transparent down-conversion YVO4:Eu3+ on the back of FTO.25 This helped prevent a certain amount of UV light reach the TiO2. Results showed that the PCE of PSC increased from 7.42% to 7.93%. In 2017, a down-conversion Eu-complex was applied to PSC to generate a 15.44% PCE, which is higher than the 13.14% PSC generated without the Eu-complex.5 In this work, NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion nanocrystals were deposited on the back of the FTO. NaYF4:Eu3+ is an efficient luminescent down-conversion material that can absorb high energy UV photons and convert them to low energy photons. The prepared down-conversion nanocrystals film consisting of NaYF4:Eu3+ improved the performance of PSCs from the above-mentioned aspects. The PSC with the NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion nanocrystals film generated the best PCE (20.17%), whereas the pristine PSC had a PCE of 16.99%.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) was obtained from Pilkington (14 Ω sq−1). Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I), PbBr2, CsI and PbI2 were obtained from TCI. Titanium diisopropoxide dis(acetylacetonate), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Lumtec Co., Taiwan. Y(NO3)3, hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), NaF and Eu(NO3)3 were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. All chemicals were used as received.
2.2. Preparation of NaYF4 and NaYF4:Eu3+
NaYF4 and NaYF4:Eu3+ were synthesized by the solvothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 3.0 g of CTAB, 20 mL of methanol and 10 mL of water were mixed together. Then, 1 mL of a Y(NO3)3 aqueous solution (0.5 M) and 3 mL of a NaF aqueous solution (1 M) were added. Finally, the mixture was transferred to a 40 mL autoclave that was sealed and heated at 150 °C for about 24 h. The white precipitate was collected by centrifugation. To obtain the NaYF4 colloid, the white product was redispersed in 10 mL of ethylene glycol monomethylether. The NaYF4:Eu3+ colloid was prepared using the same method. The Y(NO3)3 aqueous solution was replaced with the mixture of Y(NO3)3 and Eu(NO3)3. The molarity of the Eu3+ doped in each solution was 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and the corresponding product was marked as NaYF4:Eu3+-2%, NaYF4:Eu3+-4%, NaYF4:Eu3+-6%, NaYF4:Eu3+-8%, respectively.
2.3. Solar cell fabrication
FTO substrates were ultrasonic cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol. The substrates were then subjected to a plasma treatment for 5 min. The NaYF4:Eu3+ layer was formed by spin-coating the NaYF4:Eu3+ colloid on the back of the FTO. The layer was then annealed under an ambient atmosphere for 30 min at 180 °C. To prepare the TiO2 ETL, a 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide dis(acetylacetonate) solution of 1-butanol was spin-coated on the FTO at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 550 °C for 30 min. The precursor solution of the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 light-absorption layer was prepared by dissolving 163.4 mg FAI, 481.7 mg PbI2, 21.3 mg MABr, 76.7 mg PbBr2 and 50 μL CsI (1.5 M in DMSO) in a 950 μL anhydrous DMF:DMSO mixture with a 4:1 volume ratio.22 The precursor solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, and then spin-coated on the TiO2 layer by a consecutive two-step process of 1000 rpm and 6000 rpm for 4 s and 20 s, respectively. During the high-speed step, 140 μL of chlorobenzene was added dropwise at 15 s. The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 40 min. A spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with additives of 17.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL t-BP. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Subsequently, they were stored in a desiccator for 12 h. Au electrodes (90 nm) were deposited with thermal evaporation deposition. The PSC device with the NaYF4:Eu3+ layer was labeled as PSC-2% (NaYF4:Eu3+-2%), PSC-4% (NaYF4:Eu3+-4%), PSC-6% (NaYF4:Eu3+-6%) and PSC-8% (NaYF4:Eu3+-8%), respectively. The PSC device without the NaYF4:Eu3+ layer was denoted as PSC-blank.
2.4. Characterizations and measurements
The crystal structure was analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, SmartLab 3 kW, Rigaku, Japan). The morphology was observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). The thickness was tested using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8010, HITACHI). The optical transmittance of the NaYF4:Eu3+ film on the FTO substrate was determined with a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda950, PE). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with simulated solar light coming from an AAA solar simulator (Newport-94043A). The IPCE spectrum was measured with an IPCE measurement system (Newport, USA). The stabilized current density was tested with a electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). The photoluminescence emission spectra were measured with a Thermo Scientific lumina fluorescence spectrometer. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were generated with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (IM6) by applying an AC voltage of 10 mV amplitude at 0 V bias. The frequency ranged between 100 mHz and 100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of NaYF4 and NaYF4:Eu3+-6% powders. The profile of NaYF4 was well-indexed to standard NaYF4 (PDF#06-0342). The peak positions of NaYF4:Eu3+-6% show a deviation from standard NaYF4, which might have resulted from the introduction of Eu3+. The ionic radius of Eu3+ (0.094 nm) was larger than that of Y3+ (0.09 nm), resulting in large lattice parameters for NaYF4:Eu3+. The TEM image and thickness of the NaYF4:Eu3+-6% layer are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). According to Fig. 1(c), the thickness of the down-conversion nanocrystals film was about 24 nm.

The transmittance spectra for the NaYF4 and NaYF4:Eu3+ films on the back of the FTO were measured with different Eu3+ concentrations. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a). Compared to blank FTO, the transmittance of NaYF4:Eu3+/FTO showed a lower value in the 300–400 nm region, indicating that the NaYF4:Eu3+ layer absorbed a certain amount of UV light. Fig. 2(b) shows the photoluminescence emission spectra of the NaYF4:Eu3+ power with different Eu3+ contents. The emission spectra of NaYF4:Eu3+ were recorded from 500 nm to 750 nm. The sample of NaYF4:Eu3+ powder showed the highest intensity of illumination. The emission peaks located at 595 nm, 614 nm, 650 nm and 700 nm can be assigned to the typical 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, 5D0 → 7F4 transition of Eu3+ respectively. The emission spectra in the region between 595 nm and 640 nm were wide, illustrating the characteristic red luminescence of Eu3+ under UV excitation. Fig. 2(c) shows the excitation spectrum of the NaYF4:Eu3+-6% powder with emission peaks located at 615 nm. There were three obvious peaks in the excitation spectrum, which are attributed to the excitation of the host NaYF4 nanocrystals. Except for the region from 335 nm to 350 nm, the UV light had an excitation intensity, explaining the reason for the improved performance of the PSC device. The widening excitation peaks imply that more UV light was converted into visible light to be absorbed by perovskite.

To further determine the performance of the down-conversion layer, we assembled PSC devices according to the structure in layer, we assembled PSC devices according to the structure in Fig. 3. The down-conversion layer was deposited on the back of the FTO with the spin-coasting method in order to protect the PSC devices from high energy UV radiation. When sunlight entered the PSCs from the FTO side, a certain amount of UV light was absorbed by the down-conversion layer and then converted into low energy photons that penetrated the FTO and were absorbed by perovskite. This improved the utilization of UV light by not only extending the spectral response range but also avoiding the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in PSCs.

J–V curves were measured to assess whether the down-conversion layer could enhance the photovoltaic performance. The results are shown in Fig. 4(a) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. PSC-2%, PSC-4%, PSC-6% and PSC-8% obtained better average PCE values than that of PSC-blank, indicating that the NaYF4:Eu3+ layer enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the PSC device. PSC-6% had the best average PCE of 19.99%, which outperformed that of PSC without the down-conversion layer (16.99%). In addition, the best-behaved PSC-6% device generated a PCE value of 20.17% with a Voc of 1.127 V, a Jsc of 23.22 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.771. The J–V curve is shown in Fig. 4(b). Current–voltage hysteresis was measured for PSC-blank and PSC-6%. The results are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2.

PSC-blank achieved a PCE of 16.99% under reverse scan and 14.23% under forward scan, exhibiting an obvious hysteresis. PSC-6% displayed 19.89% PCE under a reverse scan and 18.74% under a forward scan, indicating a small hysteresis. The small hysteresis of PSC-6% profited from the NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion layer, which reduced the probability of combination in the interface of HTL/TiO2 and perovskite/TiO2.
To further investigate the influence of the down-conversion layer on the photoelectric property of PSCs, IPCE curves of PSC-blank and PSC-6% were measured. The results are shown in Fig. 5(a). For the region from 300 nm to 400 nm, the curve of PSC-6% had an obvious enhancement compared to that of PSC-blank. The difference in this region was caused by the NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion layer, which was consistent with the J–V curves. The curves in other region had no clear difference. Fig. 5(b) shows that PSC-6% had a narrower efficiency distribution than that of PSC-blank, thus exhibiting the outstanding reproducibility of the devices. According to Table 1, the enhancement of Jsc and FF values contributed to the PCE increase. Furthermore, the PCE increased with the enhancement in the fluorescence emission intensity. This result may be explained by the following two aspects: first, the down-conversion layer absorbed UV light and emitted visible light at the same time, adjusting for the loss of photo-generated current caused by UV light, which led to higher Jsc values.
 Fig. 5  (a) The IPCE spectra of PSC-blank and PSC-6%. (b) Histograms of the PCE generated from 50 devices. 
Second, it is well known that TiO2-based PSCs exhibit inherent instability under UV light irradiation. Because under the UV light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in TiO2 recombine with electrons adsorbed at surface oxygen vacancies, resulting in a free electron in the conduction band of TiO2 and an unfilled oxygen vacancy site at the TiO2 surface. Thus, the free electron and the surface vacancies may recombine with HTM and photogenerated electrons from the perovskite layer, leading to a decay of PSC. In this work, TiO2 ETL was less exposed to UV irradiation when the down-conversion layer was deposited on the back of the FTO. On that basis, the values of Jsc and FF were enhanced.
The steady-state current density at the maximum power point was measured and shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). PSC-6% generated a steady-state current density of 19.71 mA cm−2 and a stabilized power output (SPO) PCE of 18.32% at a constant bias voltage of 0.93 V, whereas the PSC-blank achieved a steady-state current density of 18.15 mA cm−2 and a SPO of 16.15% at constant bias voltage of 0.89 V. Besides, the PSC-6% exhibited a much faster response than PSC-blank with the light switched on. According to previous reports, the ionic trapping at the TiO2 surface results in a light response difference.26,27 The SPO results indicate that hysteresis could be greatly reduced by introducing the down-conversion layer on the back of the FTO.

To elucidate the recombination process, EIS spectra of PSC-blank, PSC-2%, PSC-4%, PSC-6%, PSC-8% were measured with one-sun light intensity. The curves are shown in Fig. 7. EIS measurements are usually used to analyze carrier recombination in the PSC device.28–30 The left arc in the high frequency range revealed contact resistance in the electrode. There was no obvious difference due to an identical photoanode. The right arc in the low frequency was related to the recombination process at interface, called Rrec.31 The PSC-6% had a larger semicircle diameter, indicating a bigger Rrec, meaning that introducing NaYF4:Eu3+ layer could reduce the electron recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. In order to verify the effect of the NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion nanophosphors on the stability of the PSC device, a UV-light-soaking measurement was obtained without encapsulation. The samples for PSC-blank and PSC-6% were exposed to 365 nm UV illumination at room temperature with a relative humidity of 25%. The J–V characteristic curves were measured every 2 h under simulated AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8, the PCE of PSC-blank significantly degraded and decreased to less than 10% after UV irradiation for 10 h. The PCE of the device incorporated with NaYF4:Eu3+-6% down-conversion nanophosphors retained 70% of its initial value, thus exhibiting improved stability. The results indicate that introducing NaYF4:Eu3+ nanophosphors on the back of the FTO substrate can effectively reduce UV degradation and improve the stability of PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In this work, NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion nanocrystals were prepared using a mild hydrothermal reaction. The down-conversion layer was spin-coated on the non-conductive side of the FTO. Photoluminescence emission spectra showed that UV light can be absorbed by the NaYF4:Eu3+ down-conversion layer, and then converted to low energy photons. These low energy photons can further penetrate the perovskite light absorption layer and be absorbed. As a consequence, the utilization of sunlight was improved. The down-conversion ability of NaYF4:Eu3+ nanophosphors can be optimized by changing the doping concentration of Eu3+. Ultimately, the PSC devices with an optimized NaYF4:Eu3+ layer resulted in an average PCE yield of 19.99%, which is superior to PSC devices without a down-conversion layer (16.99%).
