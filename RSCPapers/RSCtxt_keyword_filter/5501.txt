First published on 6th June 2008Abstract
Polymers composed partially or entirely of inorganic elements in the main chain possess unique structures, properties and applications. This report summarizes the developments in the synthesis and study of macromolecules which incorporate main group and transition elements in the polymer backbone.
Highlights
Major accomplishments in the synthesis of inorganic polymers reported in 2007 include: the use of self-assembly to chemically micropattern polysiloxanes, the synthesis of π-conjugated oligomeric models for poly(phenylenedisilene), the preparation of novel polythiophenes bearing borane substituents, the isolation of cyclic ferrocenophane macromolecules, the “living” growth of micelles from ferrocenylsilane block copolymers, and the observation of novel electron transfer and conductive properties of zinc-porphyrin polymers.
1. Introduction
The synthesis of macromolecules composed partially or entirely of inorganic elements in the main chain is an area of widespread interest. A major challenge facing researchers in this area is the development of general synthetic methods to link inorganic elements into long chains. The principal motivation for the development of inorganic polymers is the unique properties and possible applications for these materials.
This report complements previous articles in this series1 and surveys the 2007 literature in the area of inorganic and organometallic polymers. The article is divided into eight sections beginning with this introductory part. The next subsection will give an overview of recent books, reviews and highlight articles that have been published in the area. This is followed by three subsections devoted to the well-established polysiloxanes (silicones), polysilanes, and polyphosphazenes. The next section will summarize advances in the development of new types of macromolecules composed partially or entirely of main group elements. A section will then be devoted to the growing field of ferrocene and related organometallic polymers. The final section will highlight progress in the synthesis of macromolecules containing transition metals within the main chain.
In this review, emphasis will be placed on synthetic advances in the development of linear macromolecules containing main group elements or transition metals within the main chain.
2. Books and reviews of inorganic polymer science
In 2007, special issues of the Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials were published in honour of the contributions to inorganic polymer science by Prof. Christopher Allen and Prof. Ian Manners.2,3 Each of these issues contains many original articles and reviews that will be of interest to the reader, some of which will be highlighted in this report.
This past year also saw numerous reviews in the general area of inorganic and organometallic polymers. A review has appeared on theoretical studies and simulations of poly(dimethylsiloxane) which focuses on the statistical properties of long Si–O–Si chains.4 The study of chain dynamics of polymers, including silicones, by proton multiple-quantum NMR spectroscopy has been overviewed.5 The importance of silicone polymers as ingredients in skin care products is highlighted.6 The optoelectronic properties of σ-conjugated polysilanes has been reviewed.7 The polymerization of phosphoranimines is highlighted in a review of living condensation polymerization.8 Reviews focused on phosphazene polymers containing phosphazene rings and the applications of polyphosphazenes have been published.9,10 A microreview has appeared which highlights the area of phosphole oligomers and polymers.11Silole and phosphole polymers are also featured in a review of electronic materials based on bridged phenylenes.12 The synthesis of inorganic polymers with functional inorganic blocks through living addition polymerization processes has been highlighted.13
The area of metal-containing polymers continues to attract considerable attention. The current status of the field of metallopolymers has been highlighted with emphasis on properties and applications.14 A tutorial review has appeared on main chain organometallic polymers and their luminescent properties.15 A perspective article has been published on current progress in rigid-rod metallapolyyne polymers.16 The field of metallo-supramolecular block copolymers has been overviewed.17 A critical review has been published of the literature on ruthenium(II)- and iridium(II)- polymers for electro-optical applications.18 Several inorganic polymer systems are featured in a review of insulated molecular wires.19 A detailed review has appeared on the use of Schiff base complexes in polymeric materials.20 An overview of metal-containing polymers that contain heterocycles in the main chain has been published.21 The field of hyperbranched polymers containing acetylene moieties has been highlighted and contains numerous examples of metal-functionalized macromolecules.22
The synthesis and properties of strained metallocenophanes, monomers for the synthesis of metal-containing polymers through ring-opening polymerization, have been the subject of a review.23 In the same issue of Angewandte Chemie, a second review appears that details the synthesis and properties of polyferrocenylsilane polymers.24 A comprehensive review of the synthesis and fascinating self-assembly properties of polyferrocenylsilane block copolymers has been published.25
3. Polysiloxanes (silicones) and related polymers
An interesting development in the use of silicones in the chemical micropatterning of surfaces has been reported.26 In particular, the authors use a micropatterned alkylthiolate self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on gold that possesses hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface features as their topographically flat chemical master. The surface is then coated with a mixture of partially Si–H functionalized PDMS, divinyl terminated PDMS (<5 wt%) and two functionalized α-olefins [perfluorodecene (hydrophobic) and undec-11-enylhexaethyleneglycol (hydrophilic)]. Curing of this mixture using Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation allows for the chemical crosslinking of the PDMS and also its functionalization with the hydrophobic and hydrophilic olefins. Since the hydrophobic moieties accumulate near the hydrophobic groups of the master, a copy of the patterned SAM is obtained.
The living anionic polymerization of D33 using a difunctional initiator has been reported.27 Quenching the living chain ends of 1 with chlorodimethylsilane affords bis-hydride-capped PDMS 2 with narrow polydispersitiy. End-functionalized poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-block-PDMS-block-poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) triblock copolymers were prepared from PDMS that was end-functionalized with a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) initiator.28 These polymers were utilized as precursors to a pentablock copolymer. The biocatalytic polymerization of α,ω-(diaminopropyl)PDMS, diethyl adipate and 1,8-octanediol using Candida antartica Lipase B has been reported.29 The potential application of silicone ionomers as self-spreading biocides has been investigated.30 (1)
Novel ladder polymers 3 spaced by an organic bridge have been prepared from the condensation of RSi(OMe)3 monomers in the presence of formic acid.31 These self-assembled silsesquioxanes form elongated organic channels which were used to retain organic molecules such as aspirin. Hybrid fluorosilicone polymers have been prepared by the condensation of Cl-(Me2SiO)n-Cl (n = 1, 3, 6) with the cyclobutane dimer of 1-bromo-4-(trifluorovinyl)benzene in the presence of BuLi.32Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) was found to react with cyclic ethers or lactone in the presence of allylbromide to afford ring-opened bromoalkoxy-substituted polysiloxane.33 (2)
An interesting application has been reported for silicones in the encapsulation of highly reactive N-heterocyclic carbenes.34 Remarkably, the silicone provides an excellent protective medium for N-heterocyclic carbenes that are moisture- and temperature-sensitive. DFT and ab initio calculations suggest that the stabilization of the carbene may be due to a weak Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction between the Si atoms and the carbene moiety (3–5 kcal mol−1). Several experimental and theoretical studies of the permeability of PDMS towards CH4, n-C4H10, C2H4, N2, O2, He, and other gases have been reported.35–39
4. Polysilanes, polygermanes, polystannanes, polycarbosilanes and related polymers
A thorough investigation of the synthesis and properties of a series of poly(dialkylstannane)s (4: R = C2H5, C3H7, C4H9, C5H11, C6H13, C8H17, C12H25) was undertaken.40 Wilkinson’s catalyst, [RhCl(PPh3)3], was found to be a very effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydropolymerization of dialkylstannanes. The molecular weights for 4 ranged from 104−105 g mol−1. Interestingly, thermal transitions to liquid crystalline phases were observed for many of these polymers and these transitions often occurred at fairly low temperatures. (3)
An interesting theoretical study of ladder polysilanes (5: R = H, Me, SiH3), which are models for the experimentally studied ladder systems (5: R = iPr), has appeared.41 Interestingly, the calculations showed that in the parent system (R = H) the chains were not twisted, whilst both the silyl- and methyl-substituted polymers show twisted backbones. These data are consistent with the twisted helical structures observed for the experimentally studied polymers. The predicted HOMO–LUMO gap for the polymers (2.3–2.7 eV) is smaller than that calculated for regular polysilanes (4.7 eV). Several theoretical studies of the electronic states of all-trans polysilanes have been reported.42–44 (4)
Small molecule model systems for long chain silane macromolecules serve as convenient systems to study σ-conjugation in catenated silicon.45 In one interesting study, several model compounds have been prepared and the electronic spectra of the oxygen containing compounds (i.e.6 and 7) show a dramatic red shift in their absorbance maxima with respect to methylated 8 (ca. 45 nm). Based on X-ray crystal data and molecular orbital calculations it was concluded that the twisted backbone in combination with strong coupling of the s-orbitals of the Si backbone to the lone pair electrons on O leads to σ-n-conjugation. (5)
Two conformationally constrained porphyrin-C60-linked tetrasilanes (syn: 9b, anti: 9c) have been prepared for comparison with the conformationally free 9a.46 The conformational effects of the tetrasilane linker on the photoinduced electron transfer was studied using time-resolved fluorescence and absorption measurements. The study of poly(di-n-hexylsilane) embedded in nanoporous silica (pore size = 10 nm) using photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopies revealed three bands.47 The bands were attributed to different conformational forms of the polymer (i.e. trans, gauche, aggregates).
A series of copolymers 10 (R, R′ = Me, Et or Ph; R1 = Me or Ph) have been prepared and the effect of the carbosilane substituent on their electronic properties has been investigated.48 The emissive, conductive and thermal properties of these polymers were investigated. Polysilanes bearing benzophenanthrene groups (i.e.11) have been synthesized and their conducting and thermal properties were evaluated.49 (6)
The Wurtz polymerization of MePhSiCl2 and Me2SiCl2 in the presence of 1,4-divinylbenzene (2–15 wt%) affords chemically cross-linked polysilane 12.50 These polymers function as effective precursors to β-SiC after pyrolysis at 1500 °C. In another study, nickel-containing polycarbosilanes 13 [Mn ≈ 8000–36 000 g mol−1), prepared from the ring-opening polymerization of silacyclobutane, were found to be excellent precursors to magnetic ceramics.51 In particular, the pyrolysis of 13 at 600 °C afforded nickel nanoparticles whilst at 900 °C nickel silicide (Ni3Si and Ni31Si12) nanoparticles were obtained. (7)
5. Polyphosphazenes, polyheterophosphazenes and related polymers
The biological applications of polyphosphazenes continue to attract considerable attention. Several polyphazenes with cell-adhesive side groups (i.e.14) have been prepared.52 The cell-binding molecule is galactose and this was introduced in a multistep process from polydichlorophosphazene. A Boc-protected tetra(L-lysine)-grafted polyphosphazene (15: Lys = L-lysine) was prepared as a new gene delivery vector.53 The Boc protecting group was removed by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid to afford a very water-soluble cationic polymer which forms a polyplex with plasmid DNA that was studied by dynamic light scattering. The polymer showed low in vitrocell cytotoxicity against the SK-OV3 cell line and showed relatively low transfection yields. Poly(2-dimethylaminoethylamino)phosphazene was examined for in vivogene delivery to tumor cells and the transfection efficiency/toxicity ratio was optimized by fractionating the polymer by molecular weight.54 Interestingly, the polyphosphazene electrolyte 16 was found to enhance the immune response of mice immunized with influenza virus antigens.55 (8)
The synthesis of novel perfluorocyclobutane polymers 17 which contain cyclic phosphazenes has been reported.56 These polymers possess good chemical and thermal stabilities and form tough and transparent thin films. The optical properties of the films were investigated and these studies suggested that these materials are promising candidates for photonic applications. The photorefractive properties of polyphosphazenes containing imidazole chromophores in the side-group structure were investigated.57 The nonlinear optical properties of polyphosphazenes containing binaphtholyl and indole side groups has been investigated.58 Intrinsically fluorescent hydrophobic and amphiphilic polyphosphazenes have been prepared which are of interest as visible tracers in biomedical studies.59

Polymers containing cyclic phosphazenes in the side-chain structure have been shown to be very good imprint lithography resists.60 The mobility of ions in the polyphosphazene ionomer 18 which has a single mobile cation and in doped polymer 19 was investigated.61 The work demonstrated that the doped polymers have much higher ion mobilities than the ionomers (ca. 10×) which is a consequence of the localized ion in ionomer 18. The lithium ion conductivities in cyclic phosphazene trimer-substituted polynorbornene have been measured.62 The synthesis and properties of polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes have been the subject of several additional studies.63–65 (9)
A monotelechelic polyphosphazene, prepared using the living cationic polymerization of phosphoranimines, was attached to an amine core 20 to afford novel polyphosphazene dendrimers 21.66 These novel dendrimers may be further functionalized by nucleophilic substitution of the P–Cl bonds of the phosphazene chain with hydrophilic segments (i.e.methoxyethoxyethoxy). These novel amphiphilic dendrimers, bearing a hydrophilic surface and a hydrophobic core, have been investigated as agents for the delivery of guests. Using pyrene as a hydrophobic fluorescent model has demonstrated that these new dendrimers may be effective for the encapsulation and delivery of drugs. (10)
6. Other main group element-containing polymers
The development of synthetic methodologies to incorporate heavier element multiple bonds into π-conjugated macromolecules continues to attract considerable attention because of their interesting electronic properties. An important advance reported in 2007 involved the synthesis of disilene analogues of oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)s which have been dubbed Si-OPV’s.67 The 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl (Eind) group is responsible for the rigid framework observed in compound 23. The tetrasiladistyrylbenzene skeleton is coplanar and the dihedral angle between the central and terminal benzene rings is 9.0°; also of note are the twist angles of the SiSi bonds which are only 0.3° and 3.8°. The π–π* transition for 22 at 461 nm is the longest value known thus far for tetraaryldisilenes (λmax 400–440 nm). Remarkably, this past year another group has also reported a novel route to π-conjugated phenylene-bridged disilenes.68 A large red shift (Δλ = 69 nm) in the longest wavelength absorption is observed between compound 24 (λmax = 439 nm) and compound 25 (λmax = 508 nm) which is consistent with π-conjugation in the backbone. Moreover, X-ray crystallography revealed that the SiSi bonds of 25 are twisted out of the plane of the bridging phenylene group by just 38.9(1)° and that the C–C bond lengths of the phenylene bridge are consistent with a small degree of quinoidal character. Both are consistent with the presence of some π-conjugation in these materials. (11)
The investigation of π-conjugated phosphole-containing materials continues to draw attention.69–72 Dithieno[3,2-b:2′3′-d]phospholes of the type 26 have been prepared with a series of different conjugated groups (i.e., phenyl, napthyl, biphenyl, anthracyl, 2-pyridyl, etc.) to extend the π-conjugation of the phosphole framework and potentially tune the emission colours of these materials.69 The resultant phospholes, which were prepared using Suzuki–Miryaura or Stille cross coupling reactions, produced a range of different emissions ranging from green to yellow. (12)
Phospholes have successfully been incorporated into a π-conjugated framework with substituted benzene rings 27a–e.70,71Polymer 27a was isolated in 34% yield, had modest molecular weights (Mn = 6 800 g mol−1; PDI = 1.03), and exhibited a short wavelength absorbance assigned to the π–π* transition (λmax = 395 nm). The oxides and sulfides of 27d were synthesized and characterized in a separate study.72 Poly(dithienosilole-2,6-diyl)s were prepared from Pd coupling reactions and Mw’s up to 13 200 g mol−1 were observed.73 (13)
A series of reports on oligomers and polymers containing chiral P atoms in the polymer main chain have appeared recently.74–79 Cyclooligophosphines have been copolymerized with phenylacetylene to afford poly(vinylene phosphine)s with Mn’s up to 2500 g mol−1.80 Excitation of polymer 28 at 430 nm produced a blue–green emission (λ = 470 nm). (14)
The periodic terpolymerization of pentamethylcycololigoarsine, hexaphenylcyclooligostibine and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate with AIBN as a radical initiator affords polymer 29 (Mn = 4800 g mol−1).81 The different reactivities of the pnictogen radicals leads to the predominantly alternating vinylene–arsine–vinylene–stibine backbone. 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy were employed to determine the backbone structure of this remarkable macromolecule (29). (15)
Several ab initio studies have been reported that evaluate the feasibility of the radical ring-opening polymerization of several phosphorus-containing heterocycles.82,83 Novel copper halide coordination polymers were prepared using a P4S3 ligand.84Phosphonate-capped dendrimers have been prepared and were shown to promote the multiplication of human natural killer cells.85
The development of synthetic methodologies to boron-containing polymers has been a long-standing area of study for inorganic polymer chemists because of their chemical functionality and the potential to obtain macromolecules with new exciting properties. Main chain organoboron quinolate polymers of the type 31 have been synthesized via Sonagashira-Hagihara coupling.86Polymer 31b (Mn = 8800 g mol−1; PDI = 2.4) exhibits a significant bathochromic shift in its π–π* transition with respect to monomer 30 (λmax = 264 nm) which is consistent with extended π-conjugation in this polymer framework. (16)
A very interesting polythiophene macromolecule with boron side groups 33 has been prepared and fully characterized.87X-ray crystallographic analysis of model compound 32 (where n = 1) revealed that the central thiophene moieties are nearly coplanar, however these central rings are severely twisted with respect to the terminal thiophene rings (45.1° and 47.3°). Surprisingly, replacing SiMe3 with BMes2 leads to a remarkable decrease in twisting and an almost coplanar backbone is adopted for model compound 33 (n = 1). This suggests that borane-substituted polythiophene 33 will exhibit favorable electronic communication along the polymer backbone. (17)

        Borane end-functionalized polystyrene systems have been shown to form interesting supramolecular structures when treated with Lewis bases.88Polystyrene polymers with organoboron units bonded to the para position of the phenyl moiety were shown to react with several Lewis bases.89 Varying degrees of complexation were observed depending on the relative Lewis acidity of the polymer and basicity of the additives (i.e., THF, t-Butylpyridine, DMAP).
The preparation of π-conjugated polymers 34 with diazaborole substituents was reported.90 Interestingly, these systems emit blue light when irradiated with UV light and their electrochemical activity has also been investigated. It was suggested that the diazaborole moiety imparts medium electron donating capability to polymer 34. Carborane-containing dendronized polymers have been synthesized.91 (18)
Polyvinylsilazanes containing methacrylates have been investigated as precursors to SiCN ceramics via UV photolithography and pyrolysis.92 Similarly, acrylates have successfully been grafted onto a polyvinylsilazane and their pre-ceramic properties were investigated.93Phthalonitrile resins incorporating aromatic ether phosphine oxide units exhibit high oxidative stability when compared to similar resins not incorporating the phosphine oxide group.94 Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an attractive ceramic with high stiffness and toughness along the basal layers and it is resistant to oxidation at high temperature (T ∼1000 °C). Poly[B-(methylamino)borazine]s were prepared at temperatures ranging from 150–200 °C and were studied as precursors to h-BN ceramics after pyrolysis.95
A ferrocene-phosphine hybrid polymer has been prepared by the anionic polymerization of a ferrocene-containing phosphaalkene (35).96 Golden coloured polymer 36 exhibited modest molecular weight (Mn = 9500 g mol−1; PDI = 1.21) and was redox-active (ΔE1/2 = 0.41 V). This polymer, which possesses three-coordinate phosphines along the polymer backbone, offers the potential to form highly metallated polymers. (19)
7. 
        Ferrocene-containing and related organometallic polymers
In 2007, a remarkable cyclic ferrocenophane polymer was prepared by photolysing [1]ferrocenophane 37 in the presence of the chelating N-donor ligand 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (Me2bpy) as an initiator.97 The cyclic polymer 38 was isolated and GPC analysis (vs polystyrene) revealed a modest molecular weight (Mn = 11 900 g mol−1; PDI = 2.12). Several cyclic oligomers were also isolated by column chromatography and were characterized crystallographically. Moreover, a reduction in reaction temperature from 35 °C to 5 °C leads to higher yields of the polymer (relative to the oligomers) and higher molecular weights (Mn = 28 400 g mol−1; PDI = 1.46). Other pyridyl ligands were examined as potential initiators for photolytic ROP of compound 37.98 (20)
A report describing the preparation and polymerization of sila[1]ferrocenophanes containing alkyne substituents was published in the past year.99 Strained [1]ferrocenophane 39 was observed to undergo living ROP under photocontrolled conditions with NaCp as the initiator. Polymer 40 can be quenched with methanol to yield the H-terminated 41. Water soluble polyferrocenylsilane (PFS) polyelectrolytes have been prepared and investigated for their ability to undergo layer by layer self-assembly.100 (21)
A series of reports on the synthesis and self assembly of PFS block copolymers have appeared.101–107 Of particular interest are the polyisoprene-block-polyferrocenylsilanes which form cylindrical micelles in non-polar solvents and it has been discovered that the addition of more polymer to the micelle containing solution results in epitaxial micelle growth, similar to the growth of living polymers.103 A new block copolymer, poly(ferrocenylsilane-b-2-vinylpyridine), was prepared by sequential anionic polymerization mediated by 1,1-dimethylsilacyclobutane.101,102
Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) have been studied using single molecule force microscopy (SFMS).108 Closed mechanoelectrochemical cycles of poly(ferrocenylsilanes) were realized using SFMS. Polystyrene-b-poly(ferrocenylsilane) diblock copolymers were oxidized using [N(C6H4Br-4)3]+ in CH2Cl2 which resulted in a polarity change of the PFS block and caused the formation of spherical micelles. Reduction of the PS-b-PFS micelle solution with decamethylcobaltocene destroyed the spherical structures to form free copolymer chains.109 Linear oligo(ferrocenylsilane) and hyperbranched poly(ferrocenylsilane) were synthesized and their electrochemical behaviour was examined by cyclic voltammetry in THF, CH2Cl2 and CHCl3.110 Similarly, the electrochemical behaviour of poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) and poly(ferrocenylmethylphenylsilane) were examined.111

Polymer
42 (Mn = 13 000 g mol−1; PDI = 2.2) has been prepared using Suzuki cross coupling methods and these materials are attracting attention for use in memory devices.112 Organic memory devices operate based on resistance changes in the organic layer, and these must be reversible. The presence of organometallic polymer 42 in an electrochemical memory device resulted in a resistance change at −1.9 V, presumably due to ferrocene oxidation. Importantly, at positive bias (1.4 V), this resistance operation was reversible. (22)
Macroporous materials (studied using TEM) have been fabricated using DNA, PFS polycations and electrostatic layer by layer self assembly.113 Similarly, PFS polyanions and polycations were used to construct supramolecular structures.114
The exciting poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane)-b-poly(D,L-lactide) was prepared using a macroinitiator approach.115 Living poly(ferrocenylsilane) was quenched with 3(t-butyldimethylsiloxy)propyldimethylchlorosilane and then deprotected to afford the desired hydroxypropyl end-functionalized 43. This was combined with D,L-lactide monomer in the presence of a Zn or Sn catalyst to form the desired macromolecule 44. Thin films of this material were spin coated and studied using AFM techniques. (23)

        Aluminum and gallium bridged [1]metallocenophanes (M = Fe or Ru) have been described.116 Preliminary polymerization studies suggest that these novel metallocenophanes will undergo transition metal catalyzed ring-opening polymerization.
Hyperbranched poly(ferrocenylphenylenes) were prepared from vinyl ferrocene derivatives.117 These hyperbranched systems can react with cobalt carbonyl to further metallize the polymeric system and pyrolysis results in ferromagnetic ceramics. Similarly, hyperbranched polyarylenes were prepared containing ferrocene and were found to be light-emitting and redox-active.118 Effects of pH and electrolyte on cross-linked ferrocene modified poly(ethylenimine) was investigated.119

        Poly(vinylferrocene) is an interesting class of organometallic polymer because of its high thermal stability (400 °C) and high Tg (190–220 °C). Several coupling strategies were employed to combine polyisobutylene and poly(vinylferrocene).120 One of these strategies is depicted in the scheme to prepare block copolymer 45. Using a similar strategy, an ABA triblock copolymer, where the A block is poly(vinylferrocene) and the B block is polyisobutylene, was prepared and analyzed by TEM and a disordered spherical morphology was observed for the thin film. Considerable progress has been made in the synthesis and study of ferrocene-containing dendrimers.121,122 (24)
8. Other metal-containing polymers
The remarkable porphyrin-containing macromolecule 46 has been shown to form the ladder structure 47 in the presence of 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bipy).123 The more planar conformation of the ladder structures leads to an increase in the charge carrier mobility by an order of magnitude. The conductivity of ladder polymer 47 was found to be dependent on the 4,4′-bipy concentration with higher concentrations leading to lower conductivity. The lower conductivity was attributed to a shift in the equilibrium between the highly conductive ladder polymer 47 which has a very rigid structure and the less conductive single stranded 48. (25)
Conjugated porphyrin oligomers are expected to exhibit good electron transfer properties and act as molecular wires. An exciting triad was prepared that contains both ferrocene and a fullerene (compound 49) and this material possessed interesting electron transfer properties.124 Remarkably, Zn porphyrin octamers exhibiting D8h symmetry were prepared from a template-directed synthesis.125 (26)
A series of new conjugated metal-containing polymers (Zn, Ni and Cu) with linear, helical, and zig-zag conformations have been disclosed.126 The zinc-containing Schiff base polymers were insoluble in most organic solvents which was attributed to aggregation of 1D Zn polymers through Zn⋯O interactions. Remarkably, treating Zn metallopolymer with pyridine (ca. 1%) resulted in dissolution of the polymer in CH2Cl2. This change in solubility is believed to result from deaggregation of the 1D structures in the presence of pyridine. A series of zinc-containing metallopolymers with bis-pyridyl ligands have been prepared and their luminescent properties have been investigated.127 Metal-organic frameworks containing carboranes have been prepared and were investigated for their potential use as hydrogen storage materials.128 Removal of the solvent molecules from the metal-organic framework triples the H2 uptake of the materials at 77 K and 1 atm.
An electropolymerized Pd-containing thiophene polymer was prepared and these insoluble materials were effective heterogeneous catalysts for Suzuki cross-coupling reactions.129 The catalyst (which was deposited on graphite electrodes) was reused 5 consecutive times to catalyze cross coupling reactions with conversions of 89–98%.
Synthesis of Pt-containing polyynes (i.e.50) have been described.130 By changing the length of the oligothiophene chain (m = 0–3) the photophysical and charge transport properties of the metallopolymer can be tuned. Incorporation of these materials into solar cells led to power conversion efficiency of 2.7%. A series of Pt and Pd polymers were prepared by taking advantage of metal–ligand interactions.131 These materials display interesting UV-Vis spectra which can be easily tuned by changing the ligand. Pt(II) and Pd(II) polymers of controlled lengths were prepared and their nanostructure morphologies were investigated using SEM.132Pt metallopolyynes with electron-deficient acridone derivatives were reported.133Platinum-containing polymers containing Si or Ge bridged (3,6-diethynyl-9-butylcarbazole) were synthesized, characterized, and their photoluminescent properties were investigated.134 Mechanistic insights into palladium coordination polymers formed with chelating phosphorus ligands have been examined.135 (27)
In 2007, the first structural characterization of heterotactic coordination polymer, specifically containing Au(I) moieties, was described.136 Moreover, isotactic, syndiotatic and heterotactic isomers of the coordination polymer were structurally compared. Coordination polymers based on π-stacked metalloparacyclophane (M = Cu) units have been described.137Manganese coordination polymers function as enantioselective heterogenous epoxidation catalysts.138
The advanced state of laser technology has necessitated the production of optical power limiters, materials which will protect human eyes, optical sensors and sensitive optical components from sudden intense laser light. A series of processable oligo- and poly-metallaynes with PdII, PtII, AuI and HgII were obtained and most show reasonable optical power limiter (OPL) responses for nanosecond laser pulses.139 Some of the metallated materials described in the present work exhibit better performance than state-of-the-art OPL’s.
