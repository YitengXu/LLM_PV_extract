    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractCertified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have increased to an impressive value of 22.1%. The most efficient perovskite solar cells have the n–i–p device architecture and use 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transport material (HTM). However, there exists microscopic inhomogeneity that is detrimental to the long-term performance of the solar cells, primarily as a result of the hygroscopicity of the lithium bis((trifluomethyl)sulfonyl)amide (LiTFSI) dopant. Here, we report a strategy for reducing heterogeneity by using an organic–inorganic integrated hole transport layer (HTL) composed of the solution-processable conjugated polymer FBT-Th4 and copper oxide (CuxO). The optimized PSCs show significant performance enhancement with power conversion efficiency up to 18.85% from a reverse voltage scan and a stabilized champion efficiency of 18.24% with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, we observe a significant enhancement of the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells under a high humidity of 70–80% in air.
1. Introduction
Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a very promising alternative to existing photovoltaic technologies and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22%.1–14 However, one of the hurdles which can potentially prevent the commercialization of this technology is the stability of the devices under high humidity conditions. One of the critical concerns is the instability of iodoplumbate based perovskite materials themselves, which quickly degrade to PbI2 when exposed to moisture and heat.
This intrinsic instability of perovskite is the most dominant factor affecting the stability of PSCs. Many attempts have been made to enhance its intrinsic stability by partial substitution (Br for I or Cs for FA) or creating a layered 2D structure.10,15 Michael Gratzel and coworkers have shown that solar cells employing perovskite with the composition Cs0.2FA0.8PbI2.84Br0.16 yield high average PCEs of over 17% exhibiting negligible hysteresis and excellent long term stability in ambient air. They also elucidated this remarkable behavior using first principles computations; the stabilization of the perovskite phase by mixing the A-cations stems from entropic gains and the small internal energy input required for the formation of their solid solution.16 Layered 2D halide perovskite structures accommodate bulkier and more hydrophobic organic cations, resulting in superior moisture stability. Mohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin and colleagues combined 3D and 2D halide perovskite structures using functional organic molecules, and reported one year of operational stability for printed 10 cm × 10 cm photovoltaic modules fabricated in air.6
To date, the most efficient perovskite solar cells have been fabricated with an n–i–p device architecture. In this context, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and a triarylamine polymer (PTAA) have been developed as the hole-transporting material (HTM) for PSCs.9,14,17–19 However, neat organic HTMs suffer from low hole mobility and low conductivity,20 and therefore require doping to perform efficiently. To improve the conductivity and mobility of spiro-OMeTAD films, lithium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) have been generally doped in the precursor solution. However, these dopants or additives degrade the perovskite slowly and it is documented that LiTFSI absorbs moisture in air.21,22 Furthermore, the requirement for oxygen exposure thus makes it difficult to precisely control the exact fraction of spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, during the oxidation of the HTL, pinholes may form on the surface of spiro-OMeTAD. These pinholes may cause direct contact between the Au top electrode and the perovskite layer and slow moisture penetration may occur.
Therefore, as a second step towards scalability and improved stability, it is of great importance to explore alternative and dopant free HTMs with comparable or even superior properties relative to the widely used HTM, spiro-OMeTAD.23–32 In 2014, Han et al. first reported perovskite solar cells employing a dopant-free HTM based on a tetrathiafulvalene derivative yielding an efficiency of over 11%.33 In the same year, Andrew C. Grimsdale and colleagues reported a novel electron-rich molecule based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (H101), a new simple HTM incorporating a readily available EDOT unit as the core structure, and obtained a PCE comparable with devices using spiro-OMeTAD at that time.34 In 2015, Yang et al. reported a perovskite device that exhibits an impressive PCE as high as 16.2% using their dopant-free D–A small molecule HTL, DERDTS-TBDT.35 In 2016, Chen et al. reported a novel HTM that was developed by introducing triarylamine and aliphatic side-chains onto a C3h Truxene-core and a PCE as high as 18.6% was achieved with the p–i–n architecture.36 Last year, Mohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin et al. synthesized star-shaped D–π–A-type hole-transporting materials coded FA-CN and TPA-CN; the optimized devices with dopant-free FA-CN and TPA-CN showed an impressive PCE of 18.9% and 17.5%.37 Very recently, Hou et al. reported that alternative bilayer approaches that use e PDCBT/Ta-WOx produced excellent performance and the devices retained almost 95% of their efficiency after 1000 hours under 1-sun illumination.38 Very recently, Bian et al. reported a PCE of 19.0% for inverted p–i–n planar PSCs with CuOx as the hole conductor, and our previous work has demonstrated that CuxO can serve as an effective HTM for organic photovoltaics.39–41 However, to date, there have been few reports employing inorganic copper oxide (CuxO) as the HTM in n–i–p architecture PSC devices. In n–i–p architecture PSCs, Shin et al. replaced PTAA with inorganic NiO, resulting in significantly improved stability but a concurrent efficiency drop from 21% to 14%.14 Even so, the performance of most reported inorganic hole conductor-based n–i–p architecture PSCs is not satisfactory enough, which may not be on account of the problem from the inorganic hole conductor itself, but can probably be attributed to the quality of the interface between the perovskite and the inorganic hole conductor.42
Semicrystalline 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole based conjugated polymer FBT-Th4 has been extensively used as a p-type semiconductor in organic field-effect transistors and polymer donor due to properties such as high hole mobility, as well as excellent thermal and chemical stability.43–45 More intriguingly, it is a novel polymer with different functionalities that have not been previously checked in perovskite optoelectronic devices: (i) it displays appropriate electrochemical Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMOs) and chemical processability with excellent cooperation with perovskite; (ii) it demonstrates high hole mobility without any additives at room temperature; and (iii) it is hydrophobic for the fabrication of the devices. Because both device stability and efficiency are crucial factors for photovoltaic technology, this fact opens a broad range of possibilities for the interaction of the inorganic hole transport layer with organic compounds beyond their use as selective contacts. Although FBT-Th4 has high hole mobility and reasonable solubility in organic solvents by itself, it displays low LUMOs (or electron affinities), which are not always very effective in blocking photoseparated electrons. Hence, to minimize undesired recombination losses at the interfaces, pristine copper oxide (CuxO) thin films have been successfully incorporated between Au and FBT-Th4. To date, there have been no reports on PSC devices employing FBT-Th4 as the HTM.
Herein, we successfully fabricated PSC devices containing solution processable FBT-Th4 and vacuum evaporated copper oxide (CuxO) nanocrystals integrated as robust hole transport materials (HTMs) for PSCs. Through careful interface modification, we achieved stabilized power conversion efficiencies greater than 18% at 100 mW cm−2 illumination and significantly enhanced the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells at high humidity.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Vapor deposition and characterization of p-type CuxO
CuxO is one of the most important p-type semiconductors because of its superior properties.46,47 The copper oxide family is composed of various known solid phases such as octahedral Cu2O and djurleite CuO among others. All of these phases are p-type semiconductors owing to the Cu vacancies within the lattice. Our previous work has demonstrated in situ fabricated CuxO to be an alternative hole transporting layer in organic solar cells due to its high mobility, high work function and suitable band alignment. As a preliminary experiment, we introduced p-type CuxO into conventional planar PSCs. Vacuum vapor deposition can avoid the damage caused by the spin-casting of solution onto organic layers. Thus, CuxO was prepared by thermal evaporation of Cu2O powder under high vacuum without any additional high-temperature annealing in our study. Fig. 1(a) presents the optical properties of vapour deposited CuxO. The transmittance of CuxO was obtained from a relatively thick CuxO sample on quartz glass. The thickness of CuxO films can be easily tuned by varying the thermal evaporation time and confirmed using a crystal oscillator. Since the spiro-OMeTAD and CuxO were both on top of the perovskite, their transparencies do not seem vital owing to the strong absorption of light by the perovskite layer. For direct band-gap semiconductors, we can confirm the optical band-gap (Eg) of CuxO according to the dependence of (αhν)2 on hν. The variation of (αhν)2versus hν calculated from the transparency spectrum is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a); Eg has been evaluated by extending the linear portion of the plots to the binding energy axis. The calculated optical band-gap is 2.09 eV for thermally evaporated CuxO. The typical XRD pattern of the CuxO film is shown in Fig. 1(b). The diffraction peaks at 36.3°, 42.4° and 61.4° are assigned to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of the CuxO materials, respectively, which indicate an orthorhombic phase of the synthesized CuxO from the JCPDS card (JCPDS: 34-1354). The XRD result suggests that our film was well crystallized. From the TEM image presented in Fig. 1(c), we can see the aggregate of CuxO nanoparticles in the region. The inset shows the polycrystalline electron diffraction rings indexed to the orthorhombic Cu2O structure, confirming its polycrystalline nature. The HRTEM image is presented in Fig. 1(d) from which we can calculate the interplanar spacing. The lattice distance (d) is 0.29 nm, attributed to the (1 1 1) crystalline plane of CuxO. We now discuss the chemical composition of the vapour deposited film. Fig. 1(e)–(g) present the XPS core–shell spectra of CuxO. The proposed reaction mechanism was that the copper oxide powder decomposed into non-stoichiometric copper oxide first, and then the non-stoichiometric product melted, sublimated, nucleated and grew to form a smooth and dense film. Fig. 1(e) provides a whole survey of the XPS scan, where we can find the signals of elements Cu and O. As shown in Fig. 1(f), peak fitting of the Cu 2p scan indicated two well-defined peaks, Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, which were located at binding energies of 932.4 eV and 952.1 eV, respectively. These peaks were attributed to the monovalent state of copper in Cu2O. Note that there exists a satellite peak at a binding energy of 944 eV. This peak indicates that the surface of our samples was covered with an overlayer of cupric oxide or copper hydroxide species, which may affect the actual optical band-gap as well as the environmental stability of the CuxO sample. It is believed that even surface overlayer species such as cupric oxide (CuO) are promising for hole transport, so this layer is thought to be not harmful for devices at least. Fig. 1(g) shows the spectrum of the O 1s state in CuxO films. Similarly, the peak at 530.6 eV is indicative of Cu–O octahedral bonding in Cu2O. The peak at 531.9 eV is ascribed to Cu2OOH and the CuO species or hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the surface. So our films are mainly composed of Cu2O with some surface oxide layer on it. For convenience, our films are referred to as CuxO in the text. To understand the energy level of CuxO, we performed a UPS test and the result is shown in Fig. 1(h). Helium Iα was used as the ultraviolet source. The wavelength of the ultraviolet light is 58.13 nm and the energy is 21.22 eV. So the work function was calculated using the equation EF = 21.22 − EB, where EF is the Fermi level and EB is the high binding energy cutoff. The valence band maximum (EVBM) with respect to EF can be achieved by calculating the low binding energy onset. The position of the conduction band minimum (ECBM) was determined by adding the optical band-gap. The work function of CuxO is 4.92 eV and the difference between EF and EVBM is 0.23 eV. Thus we got the energy levels of CuxO, whose EVBM matches well with that of FBT-Th4 or perovskite. Another important property that we will study is the conductivity of the HTL. Hall measurements demonstrated the p-type conductivity of CuxO, with a carrier density of 7.53 × 1015 cm−3, a resistivity of 674.3 Ω cm and an outstanding hole mobility of 1.24 cm2 V−1 s−1. All of these parameters are superior to those of spiro-OMeTAD or any other organic HTL, which makes CuxO a very promising candidate for hole transport. Considering the p-type conductivity and suitable hole mobility of CuxO, we tested the possibility of substituting it for spiro-OMeTAD. The J–V curve of a PSC using a single layer of CuxO as the hole transporting layer is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Unexpectedly, a single CuxO layer seems to be not effective enough to achieve superior performance to spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S1†). Note that CuxO has a good ohmic contact with the top Au electrode; the corresponding contact I–V curve of CuxO and Au is shown in Fig. S2.† This study also focuses on a semicrystalline 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole based conjugated polymer, FBT-Th4 (Table S1†). The optical band gap (Eg) of FBT-Th4 estimated with the absorption edge (767 nm) of the film is 1.62 eV (Fig. S3†). The calculated HOMO level is −5.36 eV and the deduced LUMO level of FBT-Th4 is −3.74 eV (Fig. S4†). The absorption spectra of FBT-Th4 are also shown in Fig. S3.†

2.2. Device fabrication

Fig. 2(a) illustrates the representative device architecture of the PSCs with FBT-Th4/CuxO as the HTMs and the relative energy band alignment is shown in Fig. 2(b). We investigated the performance of FBT-Th4/CuxO and spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs using the device architecture FTO/SnO2/PC60BM/MAPbI3/HTMs/Au. Fig. 3(c) compares the absorption spectra of perovskite films based on different HTMs. All the perovskite films were prepared under the same conditions. Compared to the control MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD perovskite film, perovskite films with FBT-Th4/CuxO show a slightly stronger absorption in the 450–700 nm range. The typical XRD pattern of the perovskite film on FTO substrates is shown in Fig. 2(d); almost no offset of the main characteristic XRD peaks for (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) planes of perovskite is observed in the as-prepared perovskite films (Fig. 2(e)). Furthermore, the characteristic peak at 2θ ≈ 36.44°, assigned to the (1 1 1) plane of Cu2O, can be clearly identified in the enlarged XRD pattern of the perovskite/FBT-Th4/CuxO film (Fig. 3(f)), indicating that CuxO was successfully deposited above the perovskite/FBT-Th4 layer.

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
In Fig. 4, we show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and steady-state efficiencies of the best performing devices based on the spiro-OMeTAD or FBT-Th4/CuxO hybrid HTM. PSCs based on the spiro-OMeTAD HTL yielded a PCE of 17.64%, with a VOC of 1.10 V, a JSC of 21.87 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.3% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. In sharp contrast, the maximum PCE of the PSCs with FBT-Th4/CuxO as the HTL reached 18.85% measured in the reverse scan direction including a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 22.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.4%. Moreover, devices based on the hybrid HTMs delivered a PCE of 17.78% in the forward scan direction including a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 22.01 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.1%, suggesting a relatively negligible J–V hysteresis (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Furthermore, to determine the stabilized PCEs, the cells were measured at their maximum power point under a constant bias voltage of 0.88 V and 0.85 V, respectively. We recorded a stabilized output power corresponding to a PCE of 18.24% and 17.11% for FBT-Th4/CuxO and spiro-OMeTAD based devices, respectively, in close agreement with the J–V measurements (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). Fig. 3(e) summarizes the statistical analysis of PCE parameters extracted from the J–V curves of 36 independent devices. The integrated JSC obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of spiro-OMeTAD and FBT-Th4/CuxO based devices approximates to the measured JSC obtained from the J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 3(f). We present the performance parameters of these champion devices in Table 1. In a statistical analysis across four batches of devices, comparing FBT-Th4/CuxO and spiro-OMeTAD, we observed that the FBT-Th4/CuxO devices exhibit slightly improved JSC and higher FF and VOC compared to the spiro-OMeTAD reference devices (Fig. S6†). The typical J–V curves of the planar perovskite photovoltaic devices based on the FBT-Th4/CuxO hybrid HTL with varied CuxO thickness are shown in Fig. S7† and the parameters are summarized in Table S3.†

2.4. Charge transfer studies
In order to investigate the hole extraction ability of spiro-OMeTAD and integrated FBT-Th4/CuxO, we compared the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra of the corresponding perovskite films. As presented in Fig. S8,† the pristine perovskite film shows a strong luminescence peak at 768 nm, which is in good accordance with the bandgap of MAPbI3. When we introduced the spiro-OMeTAD HTL on top of the perovskite film, the PL peak intensity decayed obviously, which proved that the carrier recombination was suppressed at the interface or in the perovskite film. Remarkably, the sample based on the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTL shows nearly no PL peak in the visible range. The results confirmed that the hybrid FBT-Th4/CuxO HTL was more efficient in reducing charge recombination and extracting charge carriers to the metal contact than spiro-OMeTAD, which is the most important reason for the JSC improvement. Meanwhile, the blue shift of the PL peak indicated a suppressed spontaneous radiative recombination and a lower trap density, which is probably the origin of the enhanced VOC.Fig. 4(a) shows the TRPL decays of the neat perovskite and perovskite films processed with different HTMs. The experimental data are fitted using a bi-exponential decay function, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S4.† The neat perovskite film exhibits an average decay time of 45.1 ns. After modifying the surface of the perovskite with spiro-OMeTAD, the sample exhibits much faster PL quenching, with an average decay time of 16.9 ns, indicating efficient hole extraction from the perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD. The perovskite/FBT-Th4/CuxO film exhibits even faster PL quenching with an average decay time of 12.4 ns, indicating faster carrier extraction and transfer to the back contact through the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM. The separated photocarriers can either recombine via surface trap states or be swept out of the device for electrical power generation. In this scenario, the techniques of transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) decay can provide additional information about interface carrier dynamics during device operation. The decay of TPV traces the fates of photocarriers at a small perturbation above open-circuit conditions, where the separated photocarriers mainly recombine via defect or trap states. Thereafter, the TPV lifetime can be extracted to determine the charge recombination rate. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the TPV lifetime of cells with the spiro-OMeTAD HTM is ∼0.09 ms and it increases to 0.13 ms for devices based on FBT-Th4/CuxO. The prolonged lifetime suggests lower interface recombination in the devices with FBT-Th4/CuxO HTMs. The decay of TPC is recorded under short-circuit conditions, where the photocarriers swept out of the device can quickly recombine via the external circuit. The decay of TPC illustrates the photocarrier transit time across the bulk perovskite and the electrode interfaces. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the photocarrier transit time in devices with the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM is ∼0.42 μs, and a change is observed with the spiro-OMeTAD based devices (0.52 μs); a shorter charge transfer time is also obtained for the devices with the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM compared with the spiro-OMeTAD devices. The TPV/TPC results are again broadly consistent with the conclusions from the PL measurements and the experimental results are fitted using a bi-exponential decay function, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Tables S5 and S6.†
In addition, we measured the mobility of the spiro-OMeTAD and FBT-Th4/CuxO films via the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model with the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. S9†), and it was found that the mobility of the FBT-Th4/CuxO film is about 3.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD film (1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher mobility of the HTL used could improve charge transport, and the higher injection current from the FTO/SnO2/FBT-Th4/CuxO/Au device compared with FTO/SnO2/spiro-OMeTAD/Au could confirm this argument (Fig. S10†). Furthermore, the calculation using the diode model equation presented in Fig. S11† revealed a lower series resistance of the hybrid HTL device under illumination. Measurement and calculation details are provided in the experimental section. All these properties demonstrated the strengths of the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM, which result in the enhancement of device performances.
2.5. Device stability studies
The most critical challenge of PSCs at the transition stage to practical application lies in the long term stability, considering their degradation during outdoor application. We therefore checked the stability of our FBT-Th4/CuxO based and spiro-OMeTAD based devices. As is known, the moisture tolerance of perovskite plays a key role in determining the lifetime of photovoltaic devices. The water contact angles of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, perovskite/FBT-Th4, and perovskite/FBT-Th4/CuxO devices are 33°, 107° and 105°, respectively (Fig. S12†). The integrated FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM, being more hydrophobic, protects the perovskite layer from water ingress and slows the degradation of the perovskite layer into PbI2, as presented in Fig. S13.† What is more, even if a very small quantity of LiTFSI was scattered on the perovskite film, it would accelerate the decomposition of perovskite to yellow PbI2.
We now study the 500 h long-term air stability of PSCs without encapsulation based on the newly developed hybrid HTM. Notably, devices fabricated with FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM layers show significantly slower deterioration than devices prepared using the conventional spiro-OMeTAD. After 500 h of aging, the devices employing the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM retain 90% of their initial device performance after 500 h of aging, while the PCE of their spiro-OMeTAD based counterparts plummet from 17.38% to 5.85% (Fig. 5 and Tables S7 and S8†). In Fig. S14,† we show the surface morphologies of different films of our devices. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD film, the deposition of CuxO onto FBT-Th4 has a slightly increased root mean square (RMS) of 5.8 nm. But it does not alter CuxO as a very robust barrier in protecting the perovskite from damage by Au electrode diffusion and moisture penetration.

3. Conclusions
To conclude, we reveal that FBT-Th4/CuxO HTMs are extremely promising candidates for replacing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporting layer. The integrated FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM is superior at injecting photo-generated carriers from perovskite to the top Au electrode. This HTL successfully blocks any accessible pathways of water molecule permeation and thus protects the perovskite films underneath from moisture-caused damage. Unlike LiTFSI doped spiro-OMeTAD, the FBT-Th4/CuxO obviously increases the stability of PSC devices. Our champion devices deliver stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 18.2% for FBT-TH4/CuxO HTMs, and significantly enhanced long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is demonstrated. After exposing the nonencapsulated devices to 70–80% humidity in air for 500 h, the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTM based devices retain up to 90% of their initial performance, while efficiencies of the solar cells fabricated using spiro-OMeTAD quickly decline from 17.38% to 5.85%. Our stability tests also reveal that the FBT-Th4/CuxO HTMs have a remarkable positive impact on the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.
