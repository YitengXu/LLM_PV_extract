    , Accepted 21st March 2012First published on 21st March 2012AbstractHybrids based on a dibenzosuberene core bearing a spiro-fluorene junction at the C-5 position and with amino donor and β-thiophenyl-α-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor groups at C-3 and C-7, respectively, serve as new organic sensitizer materials for solar cell applications. Solar cell devices based on these materials show a conversion efficiency (η) of up to 6.1% (Voc = 697 mV, Jsc = 12.2 mA cm−2, FF = 0.72) under AM 1.5 G conditions. The best IPCE values exceed 75% within the 450–550 nm absorption range.
The interest on dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) began with the breakthrough made by Grätzel and co-workers1 who have documented efficiencies of 11% with Ru/bi- or terpyridine-based sensitizers.2,3 Conversely, DSSCs made of porphyrin and phthalocyanine dyes gradually catch up the leads.4 Metal-free dyes bearing perylene, coumarin, or indoline core have also been used for DSSCs.5 Some devices made of organic dyes employing an EDOT–dithienosilole linked spacer have reached a level of efficiency comparable to those of Ru dyes.6 The structural design of an organic dye is often based on the donor–(π bridge)–acceptor (D–π–A) motif due to facile intramolecular charge transfer with evident bathochromic shift of the light absorption profiles.
In recent years, we have explored the utility of the dibenzosuberene (DBE) unit as a configurationally confined cis-stilbene (STI) template when spirally linked to fluorene at the C-5 position. The resulting hybrid (STIF) serves as a new type of optoelectronic template in organic light-emitting diode applications with great success.7 We sought to extend its utility towards DSSC applications by appending amino donor (D) and β-thiophenyl-α-cyanoacrylic acid (TCA) acceptor groups at the C-3 and C-7 positions, respectively. Recently, notable power conversion efficiencies (η) of DSSC employing trans β-styryl (3.1–5.9%),8 β-thiophenylstyryl (4.1–7.0%),9 stilbenyl (4.6–9.1%),10a,b and fluorenylvinylene (5.6%)10c blocks as π-spacers for bipolar dyes have been reported. To date, the corresponding cis-stilbene variants have never been explored. In principle, the rigid spirally configured, cis-stilbene framework would impose a better π-conjugation. Therefore, the bipolar, DBE/spiro-fluorene hybrid assembly might have the advantages of increasing light absorptions for superior light harvesting, decreasing back electron transfer for better charge separation, and preventing approaching of I3− into the dye/TiO2 interface for retarded charge recombination.
The target dyes 1–5 were obtained by a synthetic protocol illustrated in Scheme 1.11 Hartwig coupling reaction was used to append five different arylamine groups at the C-3 position of the 3,7-dibromo-STIF.7c The resulting intermediates were subjected to Suzuki coupling reactions (72–80% yields) by treatment with 5-formylthiophene–boronic acid.11 Subsequent condensation of the aldehyde intermediates with cyanoacetic acid in catalytic piperidine (10 mol%) provided the desired dyes 1–5 in 72–78% yields.11

The stacked absorption spectra of D-STIF–TCA dyes 1–5 and the unconstrained 2′ bearing a cis-stilbene core in THF solution and TiO2 film are displayed in Fig. 1 and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1. In all cases except 4 (D = Fl2N), two strong absorption bands with λmax centered at 377 ± 3 nm and 455 ± 3 nm, respectively, were observed. The former band can be attributed to π–π* transitions, and the latter one to photoinduced, intramolecular charge transfer (PICT) from a given arylamine donor to α-cyanoacrylic acid through conjugated STIF and thiophene linker. The PICT band is shifted to 492 nm in the case of 4 presumably due to enhanced conjugation. In marked contrast, 2′ exhibits a blue shift by 46 nm for the PICT absorption band with a dramatically reduced ε value by 57% (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the absorption spectrum of 2′ on film grows up in the shorter wavelength region and is much broader than that in solution, which indicates an H-type aggregation of 2′ on film.

The oxidation potentials (Eox) of D-STIF–TCA dyes were obtained by cyclic voltammetry measurements. In all cases except 4 (Eox = 0.36 eV), the oxidation potentials which are attributed to the oxidation of different arylamine moieties at C3 (Table 1) fall in the range of 0.52–0.63 eV. Their relative trend towards oxidation follows the order of 4 (D = Fl2N) > 5 ≈ 1 ≈ 3 > 2 (D = NPh2), indicating the strongest electron-donating nature of the Fl2N group.5d The excited-state potentials [E(S+/S*)] of the dyes 1–5 (−1.78 to −2.02 V vs. NHE) were deduced from respective Eox and zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) as calculated by the longest absorption band edge. Their [E(S+/S*)] are 1.2–1.5 V higher than the conduction band energy of the TiO2 working electrode (−0.57 V vs. NHE), which secure electron injection from the photo-excited dyes into the TiO2 electrode. Conversely, their E(S+/S) are 0.13–0.23 V lower than the chemical potential of the I−/I3− redox pair (+0.35 V vs. NHE), providing favourable conditions for hole transfer.
In addition, theoretical calculations on the frontier molecular orbitals of these dyes by Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level support facile PICT from the D-STIF conjugated blocks to the thiophene-CA terminals (Fig. 2).

Fig. 3 shows J–V curves of the devices made of dyes 1–5, 2′, and N719; the corresponding photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. Under AM 1.5 G illumination conditions, the device efficiencies for the D-STIF–TCA dyes are in the range of 5.40–6.12%. The short-circuit current densities (JSC) range from 11.2 to 12.8 mA cm−2 (cf. 8.25 mA cm−2 for 2′ and 14.4 mA cm−2 for N719) and the open circuit voltages (VOC) range from 677 to 705 mV (cf. 678 mV for 2′ and 777 mV for N719) and the fill factor (FF) falls in the range of 0.66–0.73 (cf. 0.67 for 2′ and 0.70 for N719). Notably, all the device performances of dyes 1–5 are 43–63% better than that of 2′ (η = 3.77%) and reached 75–78% of the N719-based DSSC (η = 7.83%) fabricated and measured under similar conditions.

The stacked spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for devices made of D-STIF–TCA, 2′ and N719 dyes are shown in Fig. 4. The band onsets of their IPCE plots fall in the range of 670–690 nm. Notably, their IPCE performances exceed 66% from 420 to 540 nm in all cases (cf. 53–67% for 2′ and 66–75% for N719) except 1 (D = NMePh; 63–66%) and exhibit the highest values (73–79%) around 490 nm (cf. 66% for 1 and 2′ at 490 nm). In comparison with 2, the uniformly lower IPCE profiles from 350 to 575 nm for 1 and from 350 to 640 nm for 2′, respectively, are responsible for their relatively smaller JSC and poorer overall photovoltaic performances.
 Fig. 4  The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency stacked spectra for D-STIF–TCA, 2′, and N719 based DSSCs. 
In all cases except 1 and 5, the IPCE values are uniformly higher than those of N719 by up to 10–20% from 350 to 490 nm. Because of the limit of light absorption, the IPCE curves of devices for 1–5 start to drop above 570 nm. The change of donor group from common NAr2 to IMS group as in 5 led to slight erosion of its IPCE even though there exists a stronger absorption band at 455 nm as compared to those for 1–3 (Fig. 1). The amount of dye-loading (DL) of the 5/TiO2 film was much larger than those of the others, indicating that the degree of dye aggregation might play a role to reduce the JSC of the device for 5 as compared to those of the devices for 2–4. This interpretation is consistent with the rigidity and planar nature of the IMS group in dye 5. Apparently, IPCE spectra show that smaller JSC values of our dyes compared to that of N719 are due to their poorer light harvesting ability in the 550–750 nm regions.
When compared with the device efficiency for 2′, the significant improvement of the device performances by 58–62% for the spirally configured 2–4 strongly supports our molecular design concept of introducing a confined cis-stilbene core to reduce dye aggregation with improved conjugation and light harvesting.12
