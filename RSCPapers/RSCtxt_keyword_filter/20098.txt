    , Accepted 28th September 2018First published on 29th September 2018AbstractA fullerene derivative, 9-(1-(6-(3,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenoxy)-1-hexyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-1-nonyl [60]fullerenoacetate (C9), is employed to anchor the surface of a SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). C9 suppresses charge recombination due to efficient passivation of oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETL through the formation of a Lewis adduct between the under-coordinated Sn in SnO2 and hydroxyl terminal groups in C9. The C9 modifying layer enhances the extraction of photogenerated charge carriers due to the negligible injection barrier and strong electron affinity. C9 can also improve the quality of the perovskite film with enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity. The PSCs based on C9-modified SnO2 exhibit improved photovoltaic performance with efficiency up to 21.3% with negligible hysteresis, which is superior to the control devices based on bare SnO2 (20.0%). Moreover, the ambient, photo and electric-field stability of the modified devices is also enhanced.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), one of the promising candidates for solar conversion, have achieved great success in terms of photovoltaic performance in the past few years, due to the distinctive optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite materials. Recently, SnO2 has been regarded as a potential low-temperature processed electron transport layer in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. In low-temperature processed SnO2, the mixture of crystal SnO2 and amorphous SnOx leads to the existence of oxygen-vacancy related defects. Although there are a few examples of fullerene-modified SnO2 based PSCs, their device efficiencies are relatively low (<20%). These studies mainly focus on the deposition method of low-temperature processed SnO2 or perovskite deposition rather than the interface engineering of SnO2/perovskite. In this work, a fullerene derivative with 2 hydroxyl anchoring groups on the long side chain, C9, is used to modify a low-temperature processed SnO2 surface for oxygen-vacancy related defect passivation, which improves charge extraction/transfer and suppresses trap-assisted charge recombination. This approach can also improve the quality of the perovskite films, which exhibit enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity. The PSCs based on C9-modified SnO2 exhibit improved photovoltaic performance with efficiency up to 21.3% with negligible hysteresis, which is superior to that of the control devices based on bare SnO2 (20.0%). Moreover, the ambient, photo and electric-field stability of the modified devices is also enhanced.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (such as methylammonium lead halides MAPbX3, where X = Cl−, I−, Br−) present outstanding and tunable electronic and optical properties, such as high absorption coefficient, efficient ambipolar charge transport, long charge diffusion length and lifetime, and solution processability, and have attracted increasing attention as a low-cost candidate for light harvesting materials in the next-generation solar cells.1–3 Along with the fine control of perovskite compositions, development of processing techniques, evolution of device architectures and design of novel interfacial materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly increased from 3.8% to over 22% over the past decade.4–15
Until now, most state-of-the-art PSCs employ a conventional structure with a mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) scaffold as an electron transport layer (ETL), which needs a high-temperature (up to 500 °C) and a long-duration (2–5 h) sintering process to transform into the conductive phase.12,16–21 However, the tedious fabrication process and complex device architecture limit the compatibility with plastic substrates and hinder commercial applications of PSCs. Thanks to the enlarged grain size and improved crystallinity of perovskite films due to the optimization of perovskite processing techniques, photogenerated charge carriers can flow through polycrystalline perovskite films before recombination without a mesoporous ETL. Therefore, simple planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs, in which all layers can be deposited at low temperature, are desirable.8,22–24
Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has been regarded as a potential low-temperature processed ETL in PHJ PSCs, due to its higher conductivity and electron mobility, favorable energy level alignment and relatively wide bandgap, compared with the widely used TiO2.25–29 Unlike the serious hysteresis in J–V curves under different scanning directions in TiO2 based PHJ PSCs, the hysteresis becomes less obvious in SnO2 based devices due to faster extraction of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite films.30–33 On the other hand, thanks to its wider bandgap, SnO2 is more stable than TiO2 under ultraviolet (UV) illumination.34,35 At the same time, little parasitic absorption in SnO2 results in a smaller ETL-induced current loss compared with TiO2.
So far, the reported PCEs of the SnO2 based PSCs are up to 21%, still relatively lower than the champion records of the TiO2 based PSCs.29,36–38 In addition, most of the pristine SnO2 based PSCs cannot eliminate the hysteresis effect completely, with H-index ((PCEbackward − PCEforward)/PCEbackward) larger than 5%. In the low-temperature processed SnO2 ETL, a mixture of the crystal SnO2 and amorphous SnOx leads to the existence of oxygen-vacancy-related defects, as the same situation in TiO2.39,40 These trap states can capture electrons and deteriorate the electronic properties of SnO2, leading to poor charge transport and serious recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface.41 Interfacial modification at the surface of ETLs has been proven to be an efficient method to suppress trap-assisted charge recombination, which is beneficial to the enhanced photovoltaic performance and reduced hysteresis effect of PSCs.42–46 Fullerene derivatives exhibit efficient charge extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface due to their superior electron affinity and energetically deep-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Considerable efforts have focused on the interface engineering in TiO2 based PSCs with various fullerene derivatives.47–50 However, there have been only a few attempts in the fullerene-modified SnO2 based PSCs, and their device efficiencies are relatively low (<20%).51–53 These studies mainly focus on the deposition method of low-temperature processed SnO2 or perovskite deposition rather than the interface engineering of SnO2/perovskite.
In this work, we use a long chain fullerene derivative with 2 hydroxyl anchoring groups on the side chain, 9-(1-(6-(3,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenoxy)-1-hexyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-1-nonyl [60]fullerenoacetate (C9), to modify the SnO2 surface in PHJ PSCs (Fig. 1). C9 possesses a suitable LUMO energy level and high electron affinity,54,55 which are beneficial to the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite film and transfer to the SnO2 ETL. The Lewis base hydroxyl groups at the end of the long chain in C9 are implanted to pacify the oxygen vacancies on the surface of SnO2, with the formation of chemical bonds towards under-coordinated Sn. Thus, the C9 modifying layer can efficiently passivate the oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETL. Moreover, the long alkyl chain in C9 facilitates ordered self-assembly. Hydrophobicity of fullerenes with a long alkyl chain renders the C9-modified SnO2 surface non-wetting to polar solvents like N,N-dimethylformide (DMF), which suppresses heterogeneous nucleation and facilitates grain boundary migration during the deposition of solution processed perovskite films. The C9 modifying layer can promote interfacial charge extraction, reduce trap-assisted charge recombination and improve the quality of perovskite films with enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity. The PSCs based on C9-modified SnO2 exhibit a maximum PCE up to 21.3% with negligible hysteresis behavior (H-index = 0.5%). In contrast, the control devices based on bare SnO2 only exhibit a maximum PCE of 20.0% with a relatively large hysteresis (H-index = 4%). More importantly, compared with the control devices, the ambient, photo and electric-field stability of the modified devices is enhanced.

Results and discussion
Film characterization
PHJ PSCs with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/C9/(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x/spiro-OMeTAD/Au are fabricated (Fig. S1, ESI†). A 20 nm thick SnO2 compact layer is spin coated on the ITO substrate using SnO2 colloidal dispersion aqueous solution; the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicates the presence of a mixture of crystal SnO2 and amorphous SnOx (Fig. S2, ESI†). An ultra-thin C9 modifying layer is subsequently spin coated on the SnO2 ETL. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the transmission spectra of the C9-modified and bare SnO2 deposited on glass substrates. The bare SnO2 shows good transparency, with an average transmittance of >97% in the region from 300 to 800 nm. For the C9-modified SnO2 film, except for a slight decrease in the UV-blue range, it also shows good transparency with an average transmittance of >95%. Both of them have little parasitic absorption, and minimized ETL-induced current loss. The contact angles of DMF on the C9-modified and bare SnO2 films are measured to be 92.8° and 22.9°, respectively (Fig. 2a). Strong hydrophobic properties of the surface of the C9-modified SnO2 would influence the morphology of the solution processed perovskite films.

(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x based perovskite films are deposited on the C9 modified SnO2 ETL by an anti-solvent one-step method using a mixture perovskite precursor solution.56 FAPbI3 possesses a relatively small bandgap, which facilitates light harvesting.11,31 A small amount of MAPbBr3 improves perovskite phase stabilization. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films deposited on the C9-modified and bare SnO2 substrates. The average grain size of the perovskite film on the non-wetting surface is larger than that on the wetting surface. The non-wetting surface of C9 suppresses heterogeneous nucleation and facilitates grain boundary migration in grain growth, leading to a larger grain size in the solution processed polycrystalline perovskite film.57
In order to investigate the interaction between SnO2 and C9, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed for the C9 modified and bare SnO2 substrates. A much higher C 1s peak at 284.8 eV proves the existence of the C9 modifying layer (Fig. S5, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the photoelectron binding energy at the Sn 3d level for the C9-modified SnO2 is slightly higher than that for the bare SnO2, which indicates the existence of additional negative charges surrounding Sn atoms. The hydroxyl groups at the end of the long chain in C9, regarded as a Lewis base, provide extra electrons towards under-coordinated Sn caused by the widespread oxygen vacancies in SnO2, and form Lewis adducts. Thus, the C9 modifying layer can efficiently passivate the oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETL.
The crystalline structures of the (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x based perovskite films deposited on the C9 modified and bare SnO2 substrates are characterized using XRD (Fig. S6, ESI†). Both of them display similar diffraction peaks at 14.0°, 19.9°, 24.4° and 28.2°, assigned to the (001), (011), (111) and (002) planes respectively, and the diffraction peak at 12.7° corresponds to the PbI2 phase.58 A small amount of PbI2 is formed under a high temperature annealing process (e.g. 150 °C), which is due to partial decomposition of FAPbI3. A moderate residual of excess PbI2 can passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in perovskite and thus enhance the device performance.28 No diffraction peak near 12° is found in the XRD pattern of the two samples, indicating that the non-perovskite δ-phase FAPbI3 converts to perovskite α-FAPbI3 completely.59 The XRD peaks become stronger for the perovskite film on the C9 modified SnO2 substrate, indicating the disappearance of small grains and better crystallinity. The enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity in the perovskite film would reduce charge recombination. The crystal orientations of (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x based perovskite films deposited on the C9-modified and bare SnO2 substrates are further analyzed using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. 2c). Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the corresponding polar intensity profiles along the ring in the qr range of 0.98 to 1.02 Å−1 (corresponding to the (001) plane). The two diffraction peaks centered at the polar angles of 35° and 64° are sharpened for the perovskite film deposited on the C9-modified SnO2 substrates: full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 7.93° and 9.21°, respectively, compared with the FWHM of 9.65° and 9.43° for the perovskite film deposited on the bare SnO2 substrates. It is suggested that the C9 modified SnO2 substrates could enhance the orientation order of the crystalline perovskites.
Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results of SnO2, C9 and (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x based perovskite in the secondary-electron cutoff and valence-band regions. Work functions (WFs) and valence-band maxima (or highest occupied molecular orbitals, HOMOs) are calculated by extrapolating the onset of the secondary-electron cutoff to the background and the edge of the valence band, respectively. The LUMOs are calculated from the HOMOs and optical bandgaps (Fig. S9, ESI†). The corresponding band structure parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) and Fig. S1c (ESI†). The LUMO energy level of C9 aligns well with the conduction band of the perovskite and SnO2, which facilitates the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite film and transfer to the SnO2 ETL.
Charge dynamics
In order to investigate the charge extraction and transfer process at the electron selective interface, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are employed. Fig. 3a shows the steady-state PL spectra of the Al2O3/perovskite, SnO2/perovskite and SnO2/C9/perovskite films. The neat perovskite film on the Al2O3 substrate exhibits the highest PL intensity with the PL peak at 788 nm. For the SnO2/perovskite film, a significant PL quenching of 50% is observed, indicating efficient electron extraction from the perovskite to the SnO2 ETL. Further quenching (74%) is observed for the SnO2/C9/perovskite film, indicating that more efficient electron extraction occurs at the electron selective interface when SnO2 is modified with C9. This is mainly due to the smaller energy offset for easy charge transfer and high electron affinity of C9. Interfacial charge dynamic characteristics are further investigated by time-resolved PL. Fig. 3b shows the time-resolved PL spectra of the Al2O3/perovskite, SnO2/perovskite and SnO2/C9/perovskite films. Fitting the experimental data with the bi-exponential decay function yields two decay times (e.g. τ1 and τ2), and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The neat perovskite film on the Al2O3 substrate exhibits an average decay time of 1239 ns, while the SnO2/perovskite film exhibits a much faster PL quenching, with an average decay time of 197 ns, indicating that photogenerated electrons in the perovskite can be extracted to the SnO2 ETL efficiently. The SnO2/C9/perovskite film exhibits even faster PL quenching with an average decay time of 130 ns, implying that the C9 modified SnO2 ETL offers enhanced electron extraction/transport compared with the bare SnO2.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to further investigate the charge transfer and recombination behaviors at the electron selective interface. Nyquist plots of the modified device based on SnO2/C9 and the control device based on bare SnO2 are obtained in the applied potential bias from 700 to 900 mV and in the frequency range from 106 to 0.1 Hz (Fig. S10a and b, ESI†). The inset in Fig. S10d (ESI†) shows the equivalent circuit used for the simulation of charge transfer and the recombination process in PHJ PSCs, where Rs is the series resistance of the devices, RHTM and CHTM correspond to the resistance at the HTM/Au interface and its chemical capacitance, and Rrec and Crec correspond to the recombination resistance at the SnO2/perovskite interface and its chemical capacitance.60,61 In the Nyquist plots, the main arc located at a lower frequency is related to the charge transfer process at the SnO2/perovskite interface, dominated by interfacial charge recombination. The relationships between the bias voltage and Rrec for the modified and control devices are shown in Fig. S10c (ESI†). At the same bias voltage, the Rrec of the modified device is much higher than that of the control device, indicating that charge recombination at the electron selective interface is largely prevented, due to efficient oxygen-vacancy passivation on the surface of SnO2 by C9. The relationships between the bias voltage and Rs for both devices exhibit the opposite trend (Fig. S10d, ESI†). Rs of the modified device is lower than that of the control device.
Thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) analysis62 is performed to characterize the trap density-of-states (tDOS) in the forbidden band of the perovskite films deposited on both C9 modified and bare SnO2 substrates (Fig. S11, ESI†). Compared with the perovskite on bare SnO2, the tDOS with the energy level between 0.4 and 0.5 eV towards the forbidden band decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude for the perovskite on the C9-modified SnO2 substrate. The much lower tDOS in the bulk perovskite is related to the improved quality of the perovskite film with enlarged grain size and reduced grain boundary deposited on the C9-modified SnO2 substrate.
To further unravel the underlying charge recombination and transfer dynamics, transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) decays are measured (Fig. 3c and d). The experimental results are fitted by a bi-exponential decay function, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†), respectively. The photovoltage signal is triggered by a pulse light that pumps up the carrier density and thus quasi-Fermi level splitting, and charge recombination are directly measured via monitoring the photovoltage decay.63,64 The photovoltage decay time of the device based on C9-modified SnO2 (1.65 ms) is longer than that of the control device based on bare SnO2 (0.48 ms). The prolonged photovoltage decay time suggests less charge recombination in the C9-modified device, both at the SnO2/perovskite interface and in the bulk perovskite, mainly attributed to efficient passivation of the trap states on the surface of the SnO2 ETL, as well as the improved quality of perovskite with enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity.65–67 For the TPC results, the modified device exhibits relatively larger total non-equilibrium charges collected at both electrodes, which can be calculated by the integration of TPC curves, compared with that of the control device under the same intensity of the pulse laser. The enhanced total non-equilibrium charges are mainly attributed to the less charge recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface and in the bulk perovskite, as well as faster extraction at the electron selective interface.68 Moreover, the photocurrent decay time of the modified device is reduced from 1.2 μs to 1.0 μs, indicating that improved electron extraction occurs at the interface between the C9 modified SnO2 ETL and the perovskite film.69 The TPC results are in good agreement with the PL results.
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performances of the modified devices based on SnO2/C9 and the control devices based on bare SnO2 are investigated in detail. The thickness effect of the C9 modifying layer is studied firstly. Since the C9 modifying layer is too thin to be measured by atomic force microscopy or step profiler precisely, the thickness of C9 is basically controlled by varying the concentration of its solution. The optimized thickness of the C9 modifying layer corresponds to the concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 (Table S5, ESI†). A thicker C9 decreases the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which is mainly due to the increased series resistance of the whole device; while a thinner C9 also leads to lower JSC and FF, mainly because of the weaker passivation of the oxygen-vacancy-related defects on the surface of the SnO2 ETL. On the other hand, the widely used fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), is also employed to modify the surface of SnO2, and the PC61BM modified devices exhibit a relatively inferior performance compared with the C9 modified devices at the same concentration, indicating that the anchoring hydroxyl group in C9 is essential for enhancing device performance.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the best-performing devices based on the C9 modified and bare SnO2 ETL, measured under simulated solar illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The C9 modified devices exhibit a maximum PCE of 21.3% with a JSC of 24.1 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V and FF of 78.9%. The control devices based on bare SnO2 exhibit a relatively inferior performance: a maximum PCE of 20.0% with a JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.10 V and FF of 78.2%. In order to reasonably present the change in the photovoltaic parameters caused by the C9 interlayer, we list the average values of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE with standard deviation obtained from 10 devices in the same batch in Table 1. The average VOC value is improved 40 mV, which is mainly attributed to the reduced charge recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface and in the bulk perovskite.50,70 The average JSC value is improved 0.8 mA cm−2. The higher average JSC value for the C9-modified devices is mainly attributed to the enhanced extraction of photogenerated electrons at the SnO2/perovskite interface as well as reduced charge recombination both at the SnO2/perovskite interface and in the bulk perovskite. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the modified device in the whole visible region is higher than that of the control device without C9 (Fig. 4b), which is consistent with the profile of the JSC from the J–V measurement.

Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows the hysteresis effect in the J–V curves of the PSCs with and without C9 under different scanning directions. The C9 modified device is almost free of hysteresis in the J–V curves with a very small H-index of 0.5% (Table 1), while the control device without C9 exhibits an obvious hysteresis with an H-index of 4%. The H-index of 0.5% is even smaller than those reported in other fullerene-modified SnO2 based PSCs (H-index = 2–5%).51–53 Efficient passivation of the trap states at the electron selective interface for the C9 modified devices is responsible for the elimination of the hysteresis behavior.
The steady-state photocurrent outputs of the devices based on the C9 modified and bare SnO2 ETL are measured under their maximum power points (Fig. S13, ESI†). The modified devices exhibit a stabilized current of 22.3 mA cm−2 at 0.95 V bias voltage, with a stabilized efficiency of 21.2%, which is consistent with the results obtained from the J–V measurement. The control devices exhibit a relatively inferior stabilized photocurrent of 21.0 mA cm−2 at 0.93 V bias voltage, with a stabilized efficiency of 19.5%. Because of the obvious hysteresis with an H-index of 4% for the control device based on bare SnO2, its stabilized efficiency has a 2.5% mismatch with the PCE measured under backward scanning.
The stability tests of these un-encapsulated devices are carried out under ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C, 15 ± 5% relative humidity). The average PCE retains around 92% of the initial value for the C9 modified devices after 90 days of storage, while only 82% for the control devices without C9 under the same conditions (Fig. 4c). The photo stability and electric field stability tests of the un-encapsulated devices are also carried out under continuous illuminated soaking in an N2 atmosphere (20 ± 5 °C), at a bias voltage of 0.9 V. The C9 modified device exhibits a relatively steady photocurrent output, with only 8% decrease after 8 h of continuous operation, while the control device without C9 exhibits around 56% decrease in the photocurrent output under the same conditions (Fig. 4d). Efficient passivation of the oxygen vacancy-related defects on the surface of SnO2 and much lower tDOS in the perovskite film due to enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity are the main reasons for better ambient, photo and electric field stability of the C9 modified devices.
Conclusions
In summary, a fullerene derivative C9 with 2 anchoring hydroxyl groups on the long side chain is used as a multi-functional modifying layer for SnO2 in PHJ PSCs. C9 efficiently passivates oxygen vacancy-related defects on the surface of SnO2 through the formation of a Lewis adduct between the under-coordinated Sn in SnO2 and hydroxyl terminal groups in C9. C9 enhances the photogenerated charge extraction, suppresses the charge recombination, and improves the perovskite film quality with enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity. The C9 modified devices exhibit a maximum PCE up to 21.3% with negligible J–V hysteresis, higher than the control devices based on bare SnO2 (20.0%). More importantly, the ambient, photo and electric field stability of the C9 modified devices is also improved. This work demonstrates that fullerene derivatives with anchoring hydroxyl groups are promising in the interface engineering of SnO2 based PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and were used without further purification. C9 was synthesized according to our previous work.55 PC61BM was purchased from American dye Inc. PbI2 (99.9985%) and PbBr2 (99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co., Ltd. DMF, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. (Lumtec).
A mixture solution of (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x based perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 1.32 M PbI2, 1.08 M FAI, 0.12 M PbBr2, 0.24 M MAI and 0.12 M MABr in DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v = 4:1) and stirred overnight at room temperature.
Device fabrication
Laser-patterned ITO glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω per square) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of soap water, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 30 min each, and treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber for 30 min. A thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticles was spin coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate using a SnO2 colloidal dispersion solution in water (6.18%) at 5000 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient atmosphere. C9 was dissolved in chloroform with various concentrations (5, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.2 mg mL−1) and spin coated onto the SnO2 ETL at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. The perovskite film was spin coated by an anti-solvent one-step method in an N2 atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto SnO2 and spin coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. 120 μL CB was poured onto the substrate at 15 s during the high speed stage. Then the half-crystallization perovskite film was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. Spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated onto the perovskite films at a speed of 3500 rpm. Finally, an 80 nm thick Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 10−6 Torr.
Characterization and measurements
XRD was carried out using an Empyrean series 2 X-ray diffraction system with CuKα as the radiation source. GIWAXS measurements were carried out with a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3R 300K detector. The incidence angle is 0.3°. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) with a wavelength ranging from 350 to 850 nm. UPS was carried out using an AXIS ULTRA DLD (Kratos) with He I (21.22 eV) excitation lines and a sample bias of 9 V in a vacuum of 3.0 × 10−8 Torr. Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained using a FEI-SEM (XL 30 S-FEG). TPV and TPC measurements were performed using a self-designed system excited by a 532 nm (Brio, 20 Hz, 4 ns) pulse laser in the dark. A digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 7104) was used to record the photocurrent or photovoltage decay process with a sampling resistor of 50 Ω or 1 MΩ, respectively. TAS was performed using an IM6ex electrochemical workstation (Zahner), in which the scanning frequency was set between 0.1 and 106 Hz, and the amplitude of the sine perturbation bias was set to 10 mV. The photovoltaic performance was characterized using a Keithley 2602 system source meter and an Oriel Solar Simulator 91192 under irradiation of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, calibrated with the standard silicon reference cell. When testing, individual devices were masked with a black aperture to confine the active area of the device to 0.1 cm2. EQE spectra were measured using a lab-made spectrometer with a wavelength ranging from 350 to 800 nm.71 Steady-state PL spectra were measured using a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900) with Xenon as the excitation source (excitation at 638 nm). The detected emission wavelength of the steady-state PL was from 700 to 850 nm. Time-resolved PL decay transient spectra were recorded using a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900), excited with a pulsed diode laser (EPL-445, 0.8 mJ cm−2) and measured at 785 nm after excitation at 638 nm.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), one of the promising candidates for solar conversion, have achieved great success in terms of photovoltaic performance in the past few years, due to the distinctive optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite materials. Recently, SnO2 has been regarded as a potential low-temperature processed electron transport layer in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. In low-temperature processed SnO2, the mixture of crystal SnO2 and amorphous SnOx leads to the existence of oxygen-vacancy related defects. Although there are a few examples of fullerene-modified SnO2 based PSCs, their device efficiencies are relatively low (<20%). These studies mainly focus on the deposition method of low-temperature processed SnO2 or perovskite deposition rather than the interface engineering of SnO2/perovskite. In this work, a fullerene derivative with 2 hydroxyl anchoring groups on the long side chain, C9, is used to modify a low-temperature processed SnO2 surface for oxygen-vacancy related defect passivation, which improves charge extraction/transfer and suppresses trap-assisted charge recombination. This approach can also improve the quality of the perovskite films, which exhibit enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity. The PSCs based on C9-modified SnO2 exhibit improved photovoltaic performance with efficiency up to 21.3% with negligible hysteresis, which is superior to that of the control devices based on bare SnO2 (20.0%). Moreover, the ambient, photo and electric-field stability of the modified devices is also enhanced.
