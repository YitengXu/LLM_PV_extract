    , Accepted 15th February 2015First published on 18th February 2015AbstractMultiple interfaces are necessary for exciton separation in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and continuous pathways for carrier transportation in donor:acceptor blend films, especially along the vertical direction, for efficient charge collection. Therefore film morphology is critically important to satisfy both in the construction of high performance organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the cooperative effect of solvent additives and solvent flux treatment on film morphology was confirmed. Furthermore, the correlation between a single processing parameter and the resulting morphology has been investigated. Our results show that film morphology can be tuned by changing the volume fraction of the solvent additive. Beyond that, after methanol fluxing, the OSC performance improves significantly, as short circuit current density (JSC) increases from 13.85 mA cm−2 to 15.17 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) from 62.9% to 65.7%, simultaneously. As a result, power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 6.79% to 7.67%. The favorable morphology was further investigated using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
1. Introduction
Polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, as an alternative technology from a green energy source, have attracted much attention due to their advantages, such as low processing cost, large area, environmentally friendly, flexible and light weight, over their inorganic counterparts.1–5 The morphology of BHJ films plays a very important role in the whole performance of BHJ organic solar cells (OSCs). To achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE), BHJ films must have multiple interfaces for efficient charge separation and long percolation pathways for efficient charge transport.6,7 Usually for polymer:fullerene blend films, the donor and acceptor molecules are intimately mixed, as shown in Fig. 1(a), enabling efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor molecules. To facilitate charge transport, however, it requires moderate phase separation to form percolation paths for charge extraction. Because effective charge collection occurs along the vertical direction, the gradient distribution of the donor and acceptor in the bulk film plays an important role.8 The following parameters have been identified experimentally as most significant for their influence on the nanoscale morphology in these BHJ films: (1) the molecular interaction of donor and acceptor materials; (2) the weight ratio of donor material to acceptor material; (3) the solvent used for solution processing; (4) necessary treatments, such as thermal/solvent annealing.9–17 These methods address both donor/acceptor interfaces and continuous pathways for carrier transportation in the vertical direction, and mitigate charge recombination,18 Yet to achieve ideal morphology for polymer BHJs, further approaches are desperately needed.

The three-dimensional structure of bulk heterojunction is shown in Fig. 1 (b). The BHJ active layer should consist of a donor (p-type) rich layer near the high work function anode and an acceptor (n-type) rich layer near the low work function cathode, and a mixed layer in between, to maximize the charge extraction efficiency. In polymer:fullerene blend systems, Jo et al. demonstrated that solvent annealing could force the fullerene derivative PCBM molecules to migrate or diffuse toward the top surface of the BHJ composite films, which induces a new vertical component distribution in the active layer.19 The thermal annealing step could increase the PCBM concentration on the top surface of the active layer due to PCBM diffusion, and hence this improved vertical morphology contributes to an increase in efficiency.20 Moulé et al. have built three-dimensional networks upon the P3HT nanofiber by using the self-assembly of P3HT into aligned structures.21,22 More recently, Xiao et al. have reported a method to effectively form a graded BHJ by a very simple solvent-fluxing process which is applicable to BHJ films in which solvent additives are also involved.18
The cooperation of solvent additives and solvent flux treatment has been proved to be a successful method to form a graded BHJ structure. However, adjustments in the morphology of gradient three-dimensional BHJ were rarely reported. A previous study shows that 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is a better solvent for fullerene-derivatives (>120 mg mL−1 for PCBM) than traditional solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), because of their strong interactions caused by the partial negative charge of iodine in DIO and the electro-deficiency of fullerene-derivatives. Methanol was chosen as a fluxing solvent for the following reasons: (1) low boiling point; (2) does not dissolve either fullerene-derivatives or semiconducting polymers; (3) mixes very well with DIO. Xiao et al. also reported that DIO remains in the blend film due to its high boiling temperature of 333 °C.18 So methanol fluxing helps not only to optimize the multiple interfaces and continuous pathways for carrier transportation, but also to remove the high-boiling point solvent. In this paper, the cooperative effect of DIO and methanol flux treatment on film morphology was confirmed. Furthermore, the correlation between the volume fraction of DIO and the resulting morphology has been investigated. And it reveals that the morphology of gradient three-dimensional PTB7-Th:PC71BM polymer solar cells could be adjusted by changing the volume fraction of DIO. Different films and devices were prepared to study the effect of the morphology of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:

2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
PTB7-Th from 1-material, poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) (PFN-P1) from 1-material, [6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) from Nano-C (99.9% purity), 1,8-diodooctane from Sigma-Aldrich (98.0% purity), chlorobenzene (CB) from J&K Scientific (99.0% purity), methanol from J&K Scientific (99.0% purity).
2.2 Device fabrication
The cells were prepared on glass/ITO substrates. Firstly, the ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with washing liquor, acetone, ethanol and deionized water successively for 20 min. Then the cleaned ITO substrates were dried by N2 followed by UV processing for 6 min. A highly conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto the treated ITO substrates from an aqueous solution, then these ITO coated with PEDOT:PSS were annealed in air at 150 °C for 10 min. Thirdly, a chlorobenzene (CB) solution composed of PTB7-Th and PC71BM was spin-coated to form the active layer on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Fourthly, the active layers were fluxed by methanol. Fifth, the PFN was spin-coated on the active layer. Subsequently, the aluminum cathode was deposited via the thermal evaporation method in a vacuum chamber. The photoactive area of the cells is 0.06 cm2, which is defined by the vertical overlap of the ITO anode and Al cathode. All measurements were performed at room temperature in air without any device encapsulation. Fig. 2 shows the structure and the energy level diagram of the devices.

The secondary ion mass spectrum was obtained using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer TOF-SIMS 5 from ION-TOF GmbH (Munster, Germany). A Bi1+ liquid metal ion gun operating at a 30 keV beam voltage with a 45° incident angle was used. A depth profiling experiment was performed using a gas cluster ion gun Ar1700+ with an analyzed area of 100 × 100 μm inside an etching area of 500 × 500 μm. All analyses were carried out at 256 × 256 pixels. Charge compensation with an electron flood gun was carried out during the analysis cycles. Negative ion mode spectra were calibrated on the C−, CH−, C2− and C2H− peaks.
The current density–voltage (J–V) of the devices was measured using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system and ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured on Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of the gradient three-dimensional structure
In order to confirm the formation of a gradient three-dimensional structure, PTB7-Th:PC71BM films dried under vacuum and fluxed with methanol have been investigated by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) to measure the yield of fluorine and sulfur ions (F− and S−) which are unique to PTB7-Th. So we could study the change in the distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM in the vertical direction by analyzing the yield variation of F− and S− distribution in whole BHJ along with the sputter time. The TOF-SIMS results in the vertical direction of films 3 and 8 are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, the yield of F− and S− of the film after methanol fluxing is less than that of the film dried in a vacuum at the beginning time, in which it corresponds to the surface of the BHJ layer. After 55 seconds and 75 seconds, respectively, the yields of F− and S− of the film after methanol fluxing are more than that of the film dried in a vacuum. It is clearly shown in the two inset figures that there is a junction for the yield of F− and S− for the two films. Furthermore, we also find that the yield of I− of the film after methanol fluxing (film 8) is less than that of the film dried in a vacuum (film 3), as shown in Fig. 3(c). This phenomenon indicates that methanol fluxing helps to remove DIO. In Fig. 3 (d), the difference of F− and S− is defined as the yield difference of F− and S− between film 3 and film 8. Obviously, at the beginning of sputter time, the difference of F− and S− is positive and decreases along with the sputter time. However, the difference of F− and S− becomes negative respectively after 55 seconds and 75 seconds, and then remains constant. It means that the content of PTB7-Th close to the surface of the film after methanol fluxing is less than that of the film dried under vacuum, while the content of PTB7-Th within the film after methanol fluxing is more than that of the film dried under vacuum. The donor and acceptor distribution in a BHJ film dried under vacuum is always considered to be uniform. Therefore, the results of Fig. 3(d) give evidence that the distribution of donor and acceptor molecules in the film after methanol fluxing is gradient distributed in the vertical direction. Therefore, we make a reasonable conclusion that PC71BM migrates or diffuses toward the top surface of BHJ films after methanol fluxing. Meanwhile, it demonstrates the formation of gradient BHJ OSCs.

The lateral PTB7-Th distribution images in the top and within BHJ films with and without methanol fluxing generated by TOF-SIMS measurements are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. In Fig. 4, the yield of F− on top of the film (at 5 seconds) decreased from 6.543 × 104 (Fig. 4(a)) to 5.029 × 104 (Fig. 4(b)) after methanol-fluxing, while the yield of F− within the film (at 150 seconds) increased from 3.084 × 103 (Fig. 4(c)) to 3.916 × 103 (Fig. 4(d)). After methanol-fluxing, the yield of S− on top of the film (at 5 seconds) reduced from 2.715 × 104 (Fig. 5(a)) to1.719 × 104 (Fig. 5(b)), while the yield of S− within the film (at 150 seconds) increased from 2.417 × 103 (Fig. 5(c)) to 3.102 × 103 (Fig. 5(d)). So we can verify that the PTB7-Th content in the top surface of the film decreases after methanol fluxing, meanwhile it increases within the film. In other words, the PC71BM content on the surface of the film increases after methanol fluxing. These results are in excellent agreement with that shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 4, we can also see that the distribution of F− for films 3 and 8 is different at the same sputter time and an analogous phenomenon can be seen in Fig. 5 for S−. All these results show that methanol fluxing can cause changes in the distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM in a two-dimensional plane. Based on the results obtained from Fig. 3, 4 and 5, we reach the opinion that we have succeeded in preparing gradient three-dimensional BHJ OSCs. And the formation processes for gradient three-dimensional BHJs are summarized as follows: Firstly, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:DIO solution was spin coated on top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate, and DIO grasped fullerene derivatives into nano-droplets during solvent evaporation. When the wet blended film was fluxed by methanol, methanol did not dissolve fullerene-derivatives or semiconducting polymers but mixed DIO very well. Therefore, after methanol was dripped on top of the blended film, it quickly penetrated into the wet film by dissolving DIO, in which PC71BM nano-droplets were formed. Then, along with the evaporation of methanol, DIO was extracted from inside the active layer toward the surface. During this process, some fullerene-derivatives dissolved in DIO were brought to the film surface and thus the gradient distribution of PC71BM was formed in the vertical direction. Finally, while methanol was spun off the surface of the film, DIO was fluxed away by methanol, and deeper colored graded BHJ films were obtained after being methanol dried.

3.2 Gradient three-dimensional PTB7-Th:PC71BM with adjustable morphology
It is confirmed from the above discussion that a gradient three-dimensional BHJ was prepared. In addition, the volume fraction of DIO doped in BHJ films plays an important role to affect the morphology of gradient three-dimensional BHJ films, which is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 6 shows surface topographic AFM images of PTB7-Th:PC71 BM films at PEDOT:PSS layers: (a) film 6, (b) film 7, (c) film 8,(d) film 9 and (e) film 10. The root mean square roughnesses (Rms) of PTB7-Th:PC71BM made from different DIO volume fractions are 17.921 nm (film 6), 8.184 nm (film 7), 9.780 nm (film 8), 20.182 nm (film 9) and 29.008 nm (film 10). In Fig. 6, film 7 has the smoothest surface, and film 10 comes last. These results are consistent with the result of Rms. After methanol fluxing, all films with DIO show a rough surface and their domain size increases with the increase of DIO volume fractions. It is because DIO helps the phase separation of BHJ. This phenomenon indicates that controlling the morphology of a gradient three-dimensional BHJ film by changing the volume fraction of DIO is feasible.

Then we prepared all devices according to the above optimized parameters to compare their performance (see the ESI†). Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics of devices and the detailed performance parameters under different DIO volume fractions are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 7(a), after the doping of DIO with a volume fraction of 3%, the whole performance of OSCs significantly improved; JSC increases from 11.55 mA cm−2 to 14.10 mA cm−2 and FF increases from 48.29% to 63.74%, simultaneously, PCE increases from 4.46% to 7.01%. From Fig. 7 we can see that not all the cells that are methanol fluxed show a better performance than the device that is vacuum dried, and device 8 shows the best performance. This indicates that the morphology of gradient three dimensional PTB7-Th:PC71BM plays a very important role in the whole performance. By contrasting devices 3 and 8, after methanol treatment, the whole performance of OSCs significantly improved; JSC increases from 13.85 mA cm−2 (device 3) to 15.17 mA cm−2 (device 8) and FF increases from 62.86% (device 3) to 65.68% (device 8), simultaneously, PCE increases from 6.79% (device 3) to 7.67% (device 8). The increase in JSC and FF implies lower series resistance (RS) (decreases from 17.25 Ω cm2 to 6.61 Ω cm2 after methanol fluxing).23 This RS reduction can be attributed to an improved interface morphology, since for gradient three-dimensional devices, the PFN side (cathode) is PC71BM-rich, while the opposite PEDOT:PSS side (anode) is PTB7-Th-rich, and thus charge carrier recombination can be substantially reduced. The Rsh increases from an initial value of 572.84 Ω cm2 to 936.94 Ω cm2 after methanol fluxing. The larger Rsh also indicates a lower charge carrier recombination in the active layer.24 But for device 10, the performance of the device decreased a little compared to device 5, which may be caused by interface issues between the BHJ layer and the cathode. A film with a larger Rms inevitably causes charge recombination at the interface between the BHJ and the electrode.

In order to further understand the effect of gradient three-dimensional morphology, the champion cells (device 8) and the corresponding reference cells (device 3) were researched systematically. For the entire wavelength range, device 8 exhibits a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) than device 3, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In addition, there is no noticeable difference in the shape of EQE spectra among these devices, while they display different efficiencies of photons into charge carriers. For instance, at the wavelength of 460 nm, the EQE of device 3 and device 8 are 66% and 70% respectively. The EQE of OSC that has been methanol fluxed exhibits the highest efficiency of around 460 nm in all devices, which is approximately 70%. The absorption intensity of the films vacuum dried and methanol fluxed are shown in Fig. 8(b). No distinct variation in the absorption peaks of films 3 and 8 could be observed, especially in the longer wavelength range. The absorption spectrum of film 8 increased a little compared to film 3 when the wavelength was <380 nm. We infer that the increase in the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films between 300 nm and 380 nm is probably caused by the diffusion of PC71BM toward the top surface of the BHJ films. According to the relationship between EQE and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) (eqn (1)): IQE(λ) = EQE(λ)/AbsAL(λ)(1)where AbsAL is the absorption of the active layer.25,26 Combined with the results of Fig. 8, it is concluded that the IQE of device 8 is significantly increased compared with that of device 3, and this indicates continuous pathways for carrier transportation and larger-area PTB7-Th:PC71BM interfaces after methanol fluxing. Therefore, the improved performance of OSCs after methanol fluxing mainly results from the improved charge transportation and collection because of the gradient phase mixing of the active layer.

Carrier mobility is a physical quantity used to represent the speed of carrier transport. The charge carrier transport in PTB7-Th:PC71BM is studied by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) approach.27,28 According to the Mott–Gurney law, current density is given by (eqn (2)) J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3(2)where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free-space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the BHJ layer, μ is the hole mobility, L is the thickness of the BHJ layer, and V is the voltage drop across the device.29 The J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices, fabricated with the structures of ITO/MoO3(8 nm)/PTB7-Th:PC71BM(80 nm)/Au(80 nm), are shown in Fig. 9. The computed results show that the hole-mobility μh increases from 9.14 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after methanol fluxing. The larger the μh, the better are the pathways for carrier transportation. So an increased μh indicates that the charge transport properties are substantially improved after methanol fluxing. All these results show that the improved performance of OSCs after methanol fluxing is mainly due to an improved electronic performance.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared a controllable gradient three-dimensional morphology by changing the volume fraction of DIO. After the formation of a gradient three-dimensional structure, the whole performance of OSCs significantly improved; JSC increases from 13.85 mA cm−2 to 15.17 mA cm−2 and FF increases from 62.86% to 65.68%, simultaneously, PCE increases from 6.79% to 7.67%. The enhancement in device performance is attributed to the improved donor/acceptor interface, continuous pathways for carrier transportation, better domain size, enhanced IQE and higher hole-mobility with the formation of a gradient three-dimensional structure.
