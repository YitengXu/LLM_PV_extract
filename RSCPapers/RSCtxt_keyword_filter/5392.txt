    , Accepted 18th March 2017First published on 20th March 2017AbstractIn this contribution, methylammonium lead trichloride (CH3NH3PbCl3) perovskite thin films were fabricated via a two-step spin coating and solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing method at low temperature. The films exhibited a cubic crystalline structure and pinhole-free morphologies. The possible charge traps were investigated via the analysis of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films prepared with different lead chloride (PbCl2) precursor concentrations while maintaining the same concentration of methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl). Prototypical ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors with the structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbCl3/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/Al were fabricated and showed a low dark current density of 1.60 × 10−5 mA cm−2 under a reverse bias of −1 V, a strong photoresponse in the 300–400 nm region, and a high UV-visible rejection ratio of up to 500 under a bias of 0 or −0.5 V. All the results demonstrated that low-temperature solution-processed CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin films offer great potential for making flexible, lightweight visible-blind UV-A photodetectors.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have recently gained tremendous attention as they have enabled bright, widely tunable light-emitting diodes,1,2 photodetector with high detectivity,3 as well as solar cells that have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.1%.4 The attractive optical and electronic properties of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites include high light absorption coefficients,5 direct band gaps,6 long and balanced carrier diffusion lengths,7 and high carrier mobilities.8 The low temperature solution processibility enables low-cost, large-area fabrication to make flexible, lightweight devices.9 The spectral response and the valence and conduction band positions of perovskites can be tuned via the choice of a group IVa cation (Pb2+, Sn2+) and a halide anion (I−, Br−, Cl−).10–14 The band gap of methylammonium lead–tin triiodide (CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3) has been demonstrated to vary from 1.55 to 1.17 eV by varying x from 0 to 0.5 and 0.75, and then to 1.30 eV when x is further increased to 1.10 The band gap of CH3NH3PbX3 is increased from 1.55 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 to 2.39 eV for CH3NH3PbBr3 and to 3.17 eV for CH3NH3PbCl311,12 due to the stronger covalent interaction between the halide anion and the Pb2+ cation as the halide anion changes from I− to Br− and Cl−.13,14
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have been applied to make photodetectors with the prototypes that are roughly divided into two sub-categories: vertically stacked photodiode-type detectors,3,15–20 and laterally structured phototransistor-type detectors.21–28 While these photodetectors utilized different polycrystalline thin films or nanowire perovskites as the light absorbing layer, all of them have demonstrated the detection of photons up to visible or near infrared wavelengths. The detection of ultraviolet (UV) light has a wide range of applications, such as chemical, environmental and biological analysis and monitoring, flame and radiation detection, astronomical studies, and optical communications. The development of UV photodetectors has drawn extensive attention.29,30 UV light is typically divided into four spectral regions from 400 to 10 nm: UV-A (400 to 320 nm), UV-B (320 to 280 nm), UV-C (280 to 200 nm), and far UV (200 to 10 nm).29,30 As visible light covers the range of wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm, UV photodetectors that have higher sensitivity to the radiation below 400 nm than above 400 nm are called ‘visible-blind’. Methylammonium lead chloride (CH3NH3PbCl3) as a wide-bandgap perovskite shows a high optical absorption coefficient in the UV-A range (320 to 400 nm) while transparent to visible light,11,12 which makes it a promising candidate for visible-blind UV-A photodetectors.
Recently, a few UV photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskites have been reported. Maculan et al. used an inverse temperature crystallization method to grow bulk CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals and built UV photodetectors by polishing single crystals to the thickness of 350 μm, and coating 20 nm Pt on one side as the transparent anode and 25 nm Ti and 100 nm Au on the other side as the cathode. The device exhibits a responsivity of 46.9 mA W−1 and a detectivity of 1.2 × 1010 Jones when illuminated by 365 nm wavelength light with the intensity of 1 W cm−2 and under a 15 V bias.31 Fang et al. sandwiched a CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystal about 1 mm thick, made by precipitating supersaturated precursor solution, between Ga and a thermally evaporated 20 nm Au electrode to build a photodetector device. The device exhibited a narrow spectral response with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of <20 nm centered at around 420 nm. The narrow spectral band was achieved by surface-charge recombination-induced suppression of charge collection for short-wavelength excitation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was low (0.2–1.6%) because of the low transparency of the 25 nm Au electrode and no other device performance data were reported.32 Wang et al. reported phototransistor-type UV photodetectors by making CH3NH3PbCl3 polycrystalline thin films on 50 nm thick, patterned Au electrodes with 5 μm gaps. The CH3NH3PbCl3 polycrystalline thin films were fabricated by thermal evaporation of a lead chloride (PbCl2) thin layer followed by spin coating of methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl) and annealing. The devices showed a responsivity of 7.56 A W−1 to 360 nm wavelength light with the intensity of 0.1 mW cm−2 and under a 4 V bias.33 Adinolfi et al. utilized a modified inverse temperature crystallization method to grow CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals that can cover the 5 μm gap between patterned ITO electrodes on glass to realize laterally structured phototransistor-type UV photodetectors. The devices demonstrated a very high responsivity of 18 A W−1 and the detectivity of 1012 Jones under 385 nm wavelength light with 4 nW intensity under a 5 V bias.34 As aforementioned, many studies have been reported on vertically stacked photodiode-type detectors based on solution-processed perovskite polycrystalline thin films in the visible light range,3,15–20 and demonstrated attractive device performance such as an ultrahigh gain of ∼489 and a high responsivity of ∼242 A W−1,15 a high detectivity of ∼1014 Jones,3 and a low dark current density of ∼10−9 A cm−2 under a reverse bias of −1 V.16 There is no report on UV photodetectors with the vertically stacked photodiode-type architecture using solution-processed CH3NH3PbCl3 polycrystalline thin films, which could be partly due to the difficulty involved when fabricating high quality CH3NH3PbCl3 polycrystalline thin films.11,12
Here, we reported a two-step solution process, low-temperature solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing method to fabricate uniform, pinhole-free CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films and its implication in UV photodetectors with a simple photodiode device structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbCl3/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/Al. The fabricated films exhibited high crystallinity with a cubic phase and a sharp absorption cutoff at the frontage of the UV-A range (400 nm). The possible traps were investigated via the analysis of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films prepared with different PbCl2 precursor concentrations. Prototypical devices in the photodiode structure based on trap-reduced CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films were fabricated and showed a photoresponse in the 300–400 nm region and a high UV-visible rejection ratio of up to 500. All the results demonstrated that low-temperature solution-processed CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films could be a promising candidate for making flexible, lightweight visible-blind UV-A photodetectors.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl) synthesis
CH3NH3Cl was synthesized by a modified procedure based on methods reported previously.31 Specifically, 22 mL of methylamine (33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma Aldrich) were charged with 100 mL ethanol (anhydrous, ≥99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) in a 250 mL round bottom flask. The solution was stirred in an ice bath under nitrogen protection. 12 mL of hydrochloride acid (37 wt% in water, Sigma Aldrich) were then added dropwise to the methylamine solution over 30 min. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. The white precipitate was recovered by rotary evaporation at 40 °C, then dissolved in ethanol followed by sedimentation in diethyl ether (anhydrous, Fisher Scientific) by stirring the solution for 30 min. The mixture was then washed three times with diethyl ether. The precipitated solid was collected and dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
2.2 CH3NH3PbCl3 film fabrication
To fabricate CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films, lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) and synthesized CH3NH3Cl were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) and 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) to form 350 mg mL−1 and 20 mg mL−1 solutions, respectively, at 70 °C in a nitrogen filled glovebox. CH3NH3Cl solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter before use. Substrates (plain glass or ITO coated glass with sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1, Colorado Concept Coatings LLC) were first cut into 15 mm × 15 mm pieces, then cleaned sequentially by sonication in soapy millipore deionized water, millipore deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol each for 15 min and then treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min and transferred into a glovebox. A drop of 70 μL PbCl2 solution was first spin coated onto a substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. A drop of 70 μL of CH3NH3Cl solution was then quickly spin coated onto the PbCl2 film at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 30 min. For thermal-only annealing, the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate at 100 °C and annealed for 1 h. For solvent-assisted thermal annealing, the substrates were transferred onto a hotplate at 100 °C and covered by a glass Petri dish. A drop of 10 μL DMSO was added onto the hotplate inside Petri dish and annealed for 1 h. CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films were also made with the PbCl2 concentrations of 250, 300, and 400 mg mL−1 to vary the ratio of PbCl2 to CH3NH3Cl.
2.3 Film characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out on an FEI Sirion SEM to investigate the surface morphology of the thin films. Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker GADDS D8 Discover diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å) to study the crystalline structures of the precursor and perovskite films. Data were processed using the EVA package provided by Bruker Axs. UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite thin films were collected using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer and a Horiba Fluorolog 3 Spectrofluorometer, respectively. Film thicknesses were measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-Step 500 Profiler.
2.4 Device fabrication
The CH3NH3PbCl3 films on ITO coated glass substrates were fabricated as described above. After the substrates were cooled down to room temperature, a drop of 70 μL of 10 mg mL−1 poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA, MW = 15–25 KDa, Solaris Chem Inc.) toluene solution was spin coated onto a CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Devices were finished by thermal deposition of a 100 nm aluminium layer at the rate of 0.2 nm s−1 in a background vacuum less than 2 × 10−6 Torr. The resulting devices have a structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbCl3/PTAA/Al. The working area of devices for monochromatic illumination and EQE measurements is 0.057 cm2, and for illumination using a solar simulator it is 0.1 cm2.
2.5 Device characterization
The devices were characterized under dynamic vacuum in a custom built vacuum chamber fitted with electrical leads. White light from a 75 W xenon arc lamp (Newport Co., Oriel PhotoMax) was filtered using a grating monochromator (Acton Research Co., SpectraPro-2150i) to achieve a bandpass of ∼3 nm (FWHM) for the incident CW probe light. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics in the dark and 360 nm illumination with the intensity of 0.267 mW cm−2 were recorded using a Keithley 2400 with a scan step of 10 mV from +1 V to −1 V and current values were averaged from 10 points under each bias with a delay time of 10 ms. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded with a wavelength step of 2 nm s−1 and current values were averaged from 20 points with a delay time of 10 ms. The J–V characteristics were also measured using a Keithley 2400 under AM 1.5G of simulated solar light with an illuminated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by employing a standard Si photodiode detector equipped with a KG-5 filter. The devices were scanned from +1 V to −1 V with the voltage step and time interval of 4 mV and 10 ms, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
Perovskite thin films have been typically made by one-step or two-step solution processes. The one-step solution process was firstly applied to fabricate perovskite thin films by spin coating a solution containing all precursors followed by thermal annealing. While noncontinuous perovskite films were frequently observed using lead iodide (PbI2) and methyl ammonium halide (CH3NH3X) blend solutions, which might be related to the interaction of a perovskite with a substrate surface,35,36 it may also be due to the low viscosity of the perovskite solution and the quick crystallization of the mixed precursor upon drying the spun films.37 A nano-pinning method was then developed based on the one-step spin coating technique by introducing toluene or chloroform during spin coating to wash out “good” solvents such as DMSO. The CH3NH3PbBr3 thin films made using the nano-pinning method exhibited flat and uniform morphologies.38 A two-step solution spin coating method, also known as an interdiffusion method, has been further developed to form continuous, compact iodine perovskite films for solar cell applications.9 By spin coating the precursor stacking layers of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I), methylammonium cations diffuse into the PbI2 layer to form perovskites during thermal annealing. Later on, it was reported that solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing can effectively increase the perovskite grain size and crystallinity, resulting in a significant improvement in material electronic properties and a great enhancement in photovoltaic device performance.39,40
We fabricated CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films using both one-step and two-step solution process methods. We used different one-step solution process methods, including one-step spin coating followed by thermal annealing and solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing, and one-step spin coating with nano-pinning followed by thermal annealing and solvent-vapor-assisted annealing (see the ESI† for details). All films exhibited rough, nonuniform surfaces with many large size cuboids as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We further applied the two-step solution process method followed by thermal annealing and solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing under different temperatures to fabricate CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films as illustrated in Fig. 1. A PbCl2 DMSO solution with the concentration of 350 mg mL−1 was spin coated onto cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min. Three tiny dull peaks at 19.6°, 22.86°, and 23.34° exhibited in the XRD pattern of the PbCl2 thin film (Fig. 2A) match the standard orthorhombic PbCl2 pattern (PDF#74-1803). The weak crystallinity could be attributed to the strong coordination between Pb in PbCl2 and O in DMSO.41 The SEM images of the PbCl2 film (Fig. 2B and C) show densely packed short and long lines with bright contrast and regions with dark contrast. Note that the PbCl2 thin film made in this work exhibited sharper and higher XRD peaks than those of the PbCl2 film fabricated via thermal evaporation.33 The relatively better crystallinity of our PbCl2 thin films might be the reason a “harsh” annealing condition was required to fabricate CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films as described below compared to the annealing conditions (60 °C for 30 min) reported previously.33 The purity of the synthesized CH3NH3Cl powder was verified by the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 2A, which is consistent with literature XRD patterns.42 A CH3NH3Cl 2-propanol solution with the concentration of 20 mg mL−1 was then coated onto the PbCl2 layers and annealed at 70 °C for 30 min to facilitate interdiffusion. As shown in Fig. 2D and E, the morphology of the film after interdiffusion annealing (70 °C for 30 min) showed needle-like, bright ridges. The bright ridges could be attributed to CH3NH3Cl, which has a low solubility in 2-propanol and is easily precipitated during the spin coating process. When DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing was introduced at 70 °C for 1 h after interdiffusion annealing, the needle-like ridges became less bright and sharp (Fig. S2A and B, ESI†). Such changes indicated the improved conductivity of the ridges, the facilitated interdiffusion, and the more complete conversion from CH3NH3Cl to CH3NH3PbCl3 during this additional DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing. We further increased the temperature of the additional annealing to 100 °C after interdiffusion annealing for 1 h. The low magnification SEM image of this thermally annealed film (Fig. 2F) showed that the continuous film was embedded with many white spots surrounded by cracks. The high magnification SEM image (Fig. 2G) clearly showed that the white spots appeared as isolated grains with irregular grain boundaries and gaps, and relatively bright contrast compared to the adjacent grains. The rest of the film was packed with dense, smooth grains with blurry grain boundaries with the size of ∼50–200 nm. Another film was annealed at 100 °C with DMSO vapor for 1 h after interdiffusion annealing. The CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film prepared by DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing exhibited densely packed ∼100–400 nm grains with smooth and uniform morphology and clear grain boundaries as shown in both low and high magnification SEM images (Fig. 2H and I). The quality of CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films was found to be sensitive to the temperature of both PbCl2 annealing and interdiffusion annealing when the final DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing conditions were kept the same as shown in Fig. S2C–F (ESI†). The higher annealing temperature for PbCl2 resulted in better crystallinity of the PbCl2 film (Fig. S3A and B, ESI†), causing a worse morphology of the CH3NH3PbCl3 film with broken polycrystalline domains (Fig. S2E and F, ESI†). The best CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film was prepared by PbCl2 annealing at 70 °C for 10 min, interdiffusion annealing at 70 °C for 30 min, and DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h as shown in Fig. 2H and I. These conditions were used to prepare CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films in the rest of this study.

The XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film made by DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing (Fig. 2A) showed high purity revealed by the absence of peaks originating from the CH3NH3Cl and PbCl2 phases. We also synthesized bulk CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals (6 × 6 × 2 mm, Fig. S4 in ESI†) using a modified inverse temperature crystallization method.31,43 The XRD pattern of the powder of the synthesized single crystals is also shown in Fig. 2A. All the peaks in the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film can be found in that of the powder of single crystals. Unlike that each peak (100, 110, 200, 210, 211, 220, and 221) has similar intensities in the single crystalline powder XRD pattern, only the peaks at 15.58° (100) and 31.5° (200) dominate in the thin film XRD pattern, indicating that the grains are orientated with the {100} facets parallel to the substrate surface. This agrees well with the flat morphology shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2H and I). Strong (100) and (200) peaks were also observed in the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films fabricated using the interdiffusion method even though the PbCl2 layer was thermally deposited.33 The CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film with {100} orientated grains could benefit carrier transport and improve vertically structured device performance.
The different morphologies resulting from two annealing processes suggest that thermal annealing in the saturated DMSO vapor environment could facilitate the breaking and reforming of the Pb–Cl bond mediated via DMSO and eventually form CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films with {100} facets dominating larger grains with clear boundaries.40 Under the super saturation conditions, created by adding a DMSO drop too close to the substrate, the thin film went through a more complete recrystallization process resulting in 100–500 nm cubic crystals with identical {100} facets (Fig. S5 in the ESI†).
The molar ratio of two precursors used in the two-step spin coating method is a critical parameter that affects, not only the thickness, but most importantly, the optical and electronic properties of the resulting perovskite thin films, and thus device performance.44 Therefore, we varied the molar ratio of PbCl2 to CH3NH3Cl by changing the concentration of PbCl2 (250, 300, 350 and 400 mg mL−1) while maintaining the same CH3NH3Cl concentration (20 mg mL−1), corresponding to the molar ratios of PbCl2 to CH3NH3Cl as 3.03, 3.64, 4.25, and 4.86, respectively. CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin films were prepared with these molar ratios using DMSO-vapor-assisted thermal annealing. The average film thicknesses are 97.2, 142.6, 169.3 and 207.4 nm for the PbCl2 concentrations of 250, 300, 350 and 400 mg mL−1, respectively. Absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired from freshly fabricated CH3NH3PbCl3 films. As shown in Fig. 3, all the four films exhibit a clear absorption cutoff of around 405 nm with both an excitonic peak and an extended absorption edge representing the continuum of valence-to-conduction band electronic excitations, similar to the absorption spectra of the reported polycrystalline CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films.11,12,33 The optical band gaps were estimated from the Tauc plots for four films and all are around 3.06 eV (Fig. 3), close to the previously reported optical band gap of 2.97 eV11 and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) determined band gap of 3.17 eV.12 The strong excitonic peak at the band edge was attributed to the more pronounced ionic character in Cl-based perovskites, which leads to a higher exciton binding energy.12,33 No excitonic peak was displayed in the CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystals and the absorption cutoff was around 430 nm, resulting in an optical band gap of 2.88 eV.31 As reported previously, lower trap densities, due to higher dimensional structurally coherent units that are tight in the single crystal compared to their polycrystalline counterparts, result in a narrower band gap and the elimination of the excitonic peak.45,46

The excitation light wavelength is 350 nm. Inset: The optical band gap calculated using the Tauc method. 
The steady-state PL spectra of the four CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films, however, show the shift of emission peaks and different tail lengths. The PL peak blue-shifted from 414.5 nm to 412.5 nm to 411.5 nm when the PbCl2 concentration was increased from 250 mg mL−1 to 300 mg mL−1 to 350 mg mL−1. Further increasing the PbCl2 concentration to 400 mg mL−1 red-shifted the PL peak to 416 nm. A clear PL tail extension to 450 nm is shown in Fig. 3A for the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film made with 250 mg mL−1 PbCl2 concentration. With the increase of PbCl2 concentration to 300 mg mL−1, the tail was shortened to 430 nm and almost eliminated for the film made with 350 mg mL−1 PbCl2. The tail extended back to 450 nm when the PbCl2 concentration was increased to 400 mg mL−1. Both the PL peak shift and the tail length change follow the same trend with the concentration of PbCl2. The CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film made with the PbCl2 concentration of 350 mg mL−1 exhibits the shortest wavelength of the PL peak and almost no tail following the PL peak, indicating that the film has much less trap states than films made with other PbCl2 concentrations. The formation of trap states in CH3NH3PbI3 has been investigated computationally47–50 and experimentally.15,51,52 Elemental defects derived from Frenkel defects, such as Pb, I, and CH3NH3 vacancies, form shallow levels near band edges, which play the role of unintentional doping sources.47 By investigating the trap states that could be formed by all possible intrinsic point defects in CH3NH3PbI3, it was found that Pb vacancies can pull up the valence band and Pb interstitials can pull down the conduction band, which would finally result in a narrower band gap.48–50 The experimental results showed hole traps at the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films and excitonic traps below the optical gaps in these materials, which are likely caused by electron–phonon coupling, especially at surfaces/interfaces of crystalline perovskites.51 The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies also showed that in perovskite organic cations that deprotonate from their oxidized state, Pb2+ cations as Pb3+ centers trap holes while Pb2+ cation clusters trap electrons.52 Pb2+ cations were purposely created at the top surface of perovskite films in making vertically stacked photodiode-type photodetectors to achieve high gain through trap-induced photomultiplication.15 With PbCl2 concentrations 250, 300, or 400 mg mL−1, the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films could have more trap states formed either at surfaces, grain boundaries, or inside grains, leading to a red-shift of PL peaks and extended tails. The PL results showed that the CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin films fabricated with 350 mg mL−1 PbCl2 and 20 mg mL−1 CH3NH3Cl had less trap states, providing a control material system to make UV photodetectors.
Motivated by the excellent optical properties of trap-reduced CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films, we fabricated prototypical visible-blind UV-A photodetectors with the structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbCl3/PTAA/Al (Fig. 4A), where ITO serves as the cathode, the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film (∼170 nm) works as the active layer, a visible-blind organic semiconductor PTAA (∼35 nm formed by spin coating 10 mg mL−1 PTAA in toluene) with the band gap of 3.3 eV functions as the hole transport/electron blocking layer, and Al (100 nm) serves as the anode. The energy diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 4B. The valence and conduction energy levels of CH3NH3PbCl3 displayed in Fig. 4B were adopted from the previous studies determined from CH3NH3PbCl3 polycrystalline thin films since polycrystalline thin films were used in our devices and our optical band gap is close to the values reported.11 Because of the large energy barrier of 2.34 eV between the work function of ITO (−4.70 eV) and the valence band (VB) edge of CH3NH3PbCl3 (−7.04 eV), holes would be difficult to inject from the ITO cathode to CH3NH3PbCl3 under reverse bias. A hole blocking layer can be eliminated. By inserting a PTAA layer between the Al anode and the CH3NH3PbCl3 active layer, it can effectively prevent the electron injection from the Al anode to PTAA due to the large energy barrier of 2.40 eV between the work function of Al (−4.20 eV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PTAA (−1.80 eV). Therefore, a low dark current was expected. As shown in Fig. 5A, the device exhibited a dark current density as low as 1.60 × 10−5 mA cm−2 under a reverse bias of −1 V. The dark current density under the same reverse bias is typically in the range of 1 × 10−3 to 2 × 10−6 mA cm−2 for the previously reported photodiode-type photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbI3 with hole/electron blocking layers on each side of the active layer or even double hole or electron blocking layers.3,15–18 The low dark current exhibited by our device indicated the good coverage of PTAA, which effectively reduced the electron injection from Al into the high carrier mobility perovskite layer under reverse bias. It also demonstrated the high quality of our CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films since poor quality films could induce dark current leakage due to the much lower barrier (0.40 eV) for hole injection from ITO to PTAA under reverse bias. The J–V characteristics measured under the illumination of 360 nm monochromatic light with the intensity of 0.267 mW cm−2 are also shown in Fig. 5A, exhibiting a photovoltaic feature with the open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.92 V. The light current density is 1.41 × 10−2 mA cm−2 under zero bias, which is about five orders of magnitude higher than the dark current density under the same bias and leads to a photocurrent to dark current ratio, or an ON–OFF ratio, to be ∼9840 under a 0 V bias.

(B) External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device versus wavelength under different applied reverse biases. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the device under different applied reverse biases are shown in Fig. 5B. The device has a significant photoresponse from 300 to 400 nm with a sharp cutoff at 410 nm. The EQE spectra showed two maxima corresponding to the wavelength of 334 and 398 nm and a dip around 380 nm under a 0 V bias. When reverse bias was increased from 0 to −1 V, the first EQE maximum at 334 nm redshifted 4 nm while the wavelength for the second maximum and the dip had no change. The EQE values reached 16% and 15% at 334 and 398 nm, respectively, with no bias, and increased to 24% and 22% under a −1 V bias at 338 and 398 nm, respectively, which were much higher than the reported maximum EQEs between 0.2 and 1.6% for narrowband photodetectors based on CH3NH3Pb(Cl–Br)3 and CH3NH3Pb(Br–I)3 single crystals.32 A reverse bias can facilitate the extraction of the carrier generated in the perovskite layer resulting in a higher EQE, which also indicates that carrier extraction is not essentially lossless. For most of the high performance diode type photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline thin films, the EQE can reach 80% with or without the help of a low reverse bias,3,16–19 and one even reached almost 1 × 105% due to photomultiplication via controlling surface traps of CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline thin films.15
We investigated the optical properties of single layer CH3NH3PbCl3 (∼170 nm) and PTAA (∼35 nm) and the thin film of PTAA (∼35 nm) on CH3NH3PbCl3 (∼170 nm) as in the devices without two electrodes. The absorption spectra (Fig. 6A) showed that both CH3NH3PbCl3 and PTAA single films had a sharp optical cut-off at ∼410 nm. After coating the PTAA layer on the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film, a strong excitonic peak still appeared at the same position as a pure CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film, and the dip on the left of the excitonic peak was partially filled due to the absorption of PTAA. The absorption spectrum of the film of PTAA on CH3NH3PbCl3 is consistent with the photoresponse range of the EQE spectra and can help understand the peaks (∼334 and 398 nm) and dip (∼380 nm) on the EQE spectra. The EQE can be expressed by the following equation:53EQE(λ) = ηabs(λ)ηgenηcollwhere ηabs is the light absorbance, ηgen is the charge carrier generation quantum yield, and ηcoll is the photo-generated charge carrier collection efficiency. Assuming that the charge carrier generation quantum yield (ηgen) and the photo-generated charge carrier collection efficiency (ηcoll) are the same for different wavelength light in our devices, the EQE is only a function of light absorbance (ηabs). The peaks and dip of the EQE spectra (Fig. 5B) align well with the absorption spectrum of the thin film of PTAA on CH3NH3PbCl3 (Fig. 6A), indicating that the shape of the EQE spectra is mainly determined by the absorbance of the active layer.
 Fig. 6  (A) Absorption and (B) steady-state PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film (∼170 nm) on glass, PTAA (∼35 nm) on glass, and PTAA (∼35 nm) on the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film (∼170 nm) on glass (i.e., glass/CH3NH3PbCl3/PTAA). The excitation light wavelength is 360 nm. 

Fig. 6B shows the steady-state PL spectra of the single layer of CH3NH3PbCl3 and PTAA and the thin film of PTAA on CH3NH3PbCl3 with 360 nm excitation impinged from the sample side. While the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film has the similar emission wavelength to that of the PTAA thin film, its PL intensity is much weaker even though the CH3NH3PbCl3 thin film is almost four times thicker. The PL spectrum of the film of PTAA on CH3NH3PbCl3 is dominated by the emission of the thin PTAA with a slight quenching above 450 nm compared to the PL spectrum of the pure PTAA layer. We also impinged the excitation light from the glass side (Fig. S6, ESI†). The PL intensity of the film of PTAA on CH3NH3PbCl3 is significantly lower than that of the pure PTAA layer. This is because the thicker CH3NH3PbCl3 layer absorbed most of the light but emitted much less light. Therefore, the low EQE in this work could be attributed to the intrinsic poor optoelectronic properties of CH3NH3PbCl3 compared to CH3NH3PbI3 due to the stronger Pb–Cl interaction. In addition, the large energy offsets at each interface in the device could hinder the carrier transport and collection, resulting in the lower EQE.
We further evaluated the device performance by calculating the responsivity (R), the UV-visible rejection ratio, and the specific detectivity (D*). The responsivity, R, was calculated from EQE according to the following expression:  where e is the electron charge, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of incident light. The responsivity of the prototypical device reached a maximum of 0.047 A W−1 and 0.071 A W−1 at 398 nm under 0 V and −1 V bias, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7A. The maximum responsivity of our prototypical device under a −1 V bias is almost one fold higher than that (46.9 mA W−1) of the photodetector with a CH3NH3PbCl3 single crystal sandwiched between a transparent Pt electrode and a Ti/Au back electrode,31 while it is still significantly lower than the responsivity of 7.56 A W−132 and 18 A W−133 of laterally structured phototransistor-type detectors utilizing single crystals. The UV-visible rejection ratio was calculated by RUV/R500nm and is shown in Fig. 7B. Under 0 and −0.5 V biases, UV-visible rejection ratios are similar between 300 and 400 nm with 508 and 556 at 338 and 398 nm, respectively, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest among all the reported UV photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskites.31–34
 Fig. 7  (A) Responsivity and (B) UV-visible rejection ratio RUV/R500nm of the device versus wavelength under different reverse biases. 
The specific detectivity is given by  where R is the responsivity, A is the device area, Δf is the bandwidth and in is the noise current. Assuming that shot noise from the dark current is a major contribution in the total noise current of the photodetector, the specific detectivity was then calculated as  where Jd is the dark current density. Despite the device exhibiting a higher responsivity under −1 V bias, specific detectivity reached a maximum of 6.87 × 1010 Jones at 398 nm under 0 V bias and reduced to 4.07 × 1010 and 2.87 × 1010 Jones under −0.5 V and −1 V biases, respectively, (Fig. S7, ESI†) due to the increased dark current at a higher reverse bias. It also indicates that our prototypical CH3NH3PbCl3 visible-blind UV-A photodetectors exhibit the best performance when they are self-powered and work under a 0 V bias. The detectivity of our device is significantly higher than that of the 350 μm thick single crystal device sandwiched between Pt and Ti/Au electrodes, which is 1.2 × 1010 Jones,31 while lower than 1012 Jones that was achieved by the lateral structured photodetector based on CH3H3PbCl3 homogeneous single crystals.34
One of the applications of visible-blind UV-A photodetectors is to detect the UV-A response when exposed to sunlight. To evaluate the device performance under sunlight and further investigate the effects of PTAA thickness and the dopant in PTAA on device performance, we fabricated more devices and tested them using a solar simulator. All the devices had CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films prepared under the same conditions but the PTAA layers were formed with the concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg mL−1 in order to change the thickness of the PTAA layer. F4-TCNQ, which has been reported to have the ability to enhance the solar cell performance by reducing device series resistance,54 was introduced as a dopant for PTAA. Fig. 8A shows the J–V curves of the devices tested in the dark and under the illumination using a solar simulator. With the increase of PTAA layer thickness by spin coating of 10, 20, and 30 mg mL−1 PTAA solutions, the dark current was reduced from 1.72 × 10−4 to 2.53 × 10−5 and 1.30 × 10−5 mA cm−2, respectively, under a 0 V bias, but reached almost the same under a −1 V bias. Similarly, the light current density was decreased under a 0 V bias as the PTAA layer was formed by spin coating 30 mg mL−1 PTAA solution, but reached a similar level under a −1 V bias. The dopant in PTAA not only decreased dark current density under reverse biases but also increased light current density and VOC, which is consistent with the report for photovoltaic devices.54 The increased dark current density of the device fabricated with 10 mg mL−1 PTAA compared to that in Fig. 5A could be due to the increased device area from 0.057 cm2 to 0.1 cm2 and faster voltage scan speed. We used the ratio of current density measured under the illumination of a solar simulator to that in the dark, JON/JOFF, to evaluate the performance of our visible-blind UV-A photodetectors. Fig. 8B shows the ratio of JON/JOFF under 0, −0.5 and −1 V biases for the devices made with different PTAA concentrations and with the dopant. The device fabricated with F4-TCNQ doped PTAA owned the highest ON–OFF ratio of 1371 under 0 V bias because of its increased light current density and slightly decreased dark current density compared to the device containing the 10 mg mL−1 PTAA layer without the dopant. Following the highest ratio, the device containing the 20 mg mL−1 PTAA layer showed the second highest ON–OFF ratio of 1354, as both light and dark current densities were decreased. The devices with the 10 and 30 mg mL−1 PTAA layers suffered from high dark current density and low light current density, respectively, and thus exhibited relatively low ON–OFF ratios. When the reverse bias was increased to −0.5 V and further −1 V, the ON–OFF ratios of all the four devices decreased due to the significantly increased dark current density and slightly increased light current density.

The environmental instability of perovskite thin films has long been a challenge for the applications in photovoltaic devices.55 In this study, we also attempted to expose the CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin film photodetector devices in ambient air and found that bubbles appeared under the Al electrodes (Fig. S8, ESI†). This phenomenon indicates the degradation of the devices under ambient air and encapsulation is needed in order to conduct the detection under ambient conditions.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we applied a two-step spin coating and solvent-vapor-assisted low-temperature thermal annealing method to successfully fabricate CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin films that exhibited a cubic crystalline structure and a pinhole-free morphology. We demonstrated that charge traps in the fabricated CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite thin films could be reduced by carefully adjusting the PbCl2 precursor concentration while keeping the same CH3NH3Cl precursor concentration. We further fabricated prototypical UV photodetectors with the structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbCl3/PTAA/Al. The devices showed a low dark current density of 1.60 × 10−5 mA cm−2 under a −1 V reverse bias, a strong photoresponse in the 300–400 nm region, and a high UV-visible rejection ratio of up to 500 under 0 or −0.5 V bias. The low-temperature solution-processed CH3NH3PbCl3 thin films offer great potential for making flexible, lightweight visible-blind UV-A photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.
