Afterwards, the submicrometer-sized PMSs and nanocrystals were adopted as sample materials to shed light on the effect of the photoanode structure over the performance of CdS/CdSe-cosensitized solar cells by comparing four types of photoanode structures: nanocrystal film, blend film, bilayer film and PMSs film. It was found that the bilayer photoanode could promote the harvesting of incident light by increasing both the CdS/CdSe QDs loading amount and the scattering effect. According to the transient photovoltage measurements, the carrier recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte and FTO/electrolyte interfaces were substantially passivated in the bilayer cell. Moreover, a high electron diffusion rate of 142.0 × 10−9 m2 s−1 was also obtained in the bilayer cell, indicating high photoelectrons collection efficiency in the film structure. Therefore, the bilayer cell can well integrate the structural advantages of the PMSs and nanocrystals, which contributes to a high conversion efficiency of 4.70%, demonstrating a ∼54% and ∼12% improvement compared with the cells derived from nanocrystal and PMSs, respectively.
Introduction
The ever increasing demand for clean, renewable and low-cost energy for the human society engendered the researches on developing the next generation solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is one of the most hot pursuit configurations. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) has already exceeded 13% by the persistent optimization of the working electrode, dyes, electrolyte and counter electrodes.1–5 Recently, as an alternative to organic dyes, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with higher extinction coefficients and greater intrinsic dipole moments were studied for their high light-harvesting capability and longer stability.6–10 Moreover, the semiconductor QDs exhibit attractive characteristics as sensitizers due to their tunable band gap by size control or allying to match the absorption spectrum with the sunlight spectral distribution.11–14 In addition, the unique multiple exciton generation, the formation of more than one exciton upon the absorption of a single photon, is of great importance in QDs-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), in which the thermodynamic photovoltaic conversion efficiency could be further pushed up to 44% from the current 31% of the Shockley–Queisser detailed balance limit.15–18
Therefore, QDSSCs have attracted significant attention as promising third generation photovoltaic devices, which leads to the rapid increase of photovoltaic conversion efficiencies around 4–5% at 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) in the past two years. Impressively, record PCE of 5.4% with Mn-doped QDSSC and 6.3% with panchromatic photon harvesting in Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells were demonstrated.19,20 Most recently, a large variety of narrow band semiconductors with border light response scale and higher extinction ratio were employed as the sensitizers in QDSSCs, such as CdSe, CdTe, PbS, Ag2S, PbSe, and so on.21–28 In addition, many research works were devoted to sophisticate the device configuration from different aspects, such as the photoanode oxide matrix, QDs loading technique, counter electrodes and electrolytes.29–35 The PCE of QDSSCs, however, still lags far behind than those of DSSCs, which mainly results from the incompatible band structural alignments between the sensitizers and the oxides photoanode matrix and the massive charge recombination taking place at the TiO2/electrolyte, Ti/QDs and FTO/electrolyte interfaces.36,37
In a working QDSSC, QDs are excited by incident light to generate electron–hole pairs. The electrons are subsequently injected into the TiO2 conduction band and then transported to the transparent conductive oxide electrode. On the other hand, the holes are injected into the hole-transporting electrolyte and finally reach the counter electrode, where the oxidized counterpart of the redox system is reduced. Although the sandwiched QDSSCs structure shared a lot of working principles in common with the conventional DSSCs, there are still some elementary differences, which is essentially attributed to the remarkable distinction between QDs and conventional dyes both in intrinsic nature and fabrication technique.38,39 Compared with Ru–polypyridine or organic dyes, the diameter of QDs is generally several nanometers, which is much greater than that of the dye molecules. Therefore, the pores of the photoanode film are more easily blocked by the large size QDs, especially when multiple layer QDs are formed in the loading process, which could directly prohibit the penetration of the electrolyte and decrease the regeneration of the oxidized QDs. In addition, large pore size distribution could also facilitate the loading process of the QDs and increase the QDs coverage, which is of great significance to promote the light harvesting and inhibit the recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers.40,41 Moreover, different from the chemical bonds established at the dye/TiO2 interface, semiconductor heterojunctions were formed via the in situ growth process, which should be delicately controlled at low defect level to allow a high injection rate of the photoelectron.42 Due to the high extinction ratio of QDs, the surface area of the film may not be highly required compared with the DSSCs system; however, the scattering effect helping to harvest the incident light with longer wavelength is still necessary.43 Previous work shows that the thickness of the additional scattering layer is of great influence on the cell performances.44 To date, the commonly used porous TiO2 structure is generally inherited from the optimization of DSSC system. Therefore, when it comes to QDSSC, the photoanode structures should be redesigned to meet the requirement of the new system.
Herein, we presented a case study to shed light on the influence of the photoanode film structure on the performance of QDSSCs. First, self-made TiO2 nanocrystal and PMSs were selectively prepared via a solvothermal method by altering the peroxotitanium complex precursor dosage. Subsequently, these TiO2 products were adopted to prepare four types of photoanode: nanocrystal film, blend film, bilayer film and PMS film. The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) characteristics show that the QDSSC deriving from the bilayer photoanode possesses the best PEC of 4.70%, which indicates a ∼54% increase compared with the conventional nanocrystal cell. Based on the investigation of the film structure, cell performance and the kinetic parameters of the photoelectron, the advantages of the bilayer photoanode structure were interpreted in detail.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 products
12.5 mL tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) was slowly added into a mixture solution of 50 mL hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt%) and 5 mL ammonia (NH4OH, 26–28 wt%) dropwise in a 500 mL beaker with continuous shaking. (Caution: a great deal of heat was generated in the dissolving process, which could lead to the violent boiling of the liquid accompanied by the emission of an unpleasant smell.) Afterwards, cold distilled water was poured into the beaker to yield a saffron yellow precursor solution with a final volume of 200 mL. The precursor solution was filtered to remove the undissolved yellow bulks occasionally floating on the solution. Then, 10 mL of this yellow precursor was extracted and transferred into a 50 mL Teflon container with additions of 10 mL distilled water and 20 mL absolute ethanol. The mixture was tightly sealed with a stainless jacket and heated at 180 °C for 10 h. The final residue was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the as-prepared sample was dried at 60 °C for 2 h. In addition, the precursor dosage was adjusted to 5 mL to prepare the anatase nanocrystals.
Materials characterizations
The morphologies and structures of the products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI, S4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micrometrics ASAP 2010). Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford, INCA MICSF+) was also used to characterize the film structure loaded with QDs.
Preparation of photoanode films
The paste was prepared by adding 10 wt% hydroxypropyl cellulose (Aldrich) into diethylene glycol under vigorous stirring in a 105 °C oil bath for 5 h. Then, the as-prepared paste was added into the stock TiO2 wet product, and the mixture was stirred for about 2 h to obtain the homogeneous slurry. For the blend films, the nanocrystal and the PMSs products are equally mixed in weight. The bilayer film was constructed by the doctor-blade method through two-step calcination. Nanocrystal slurry was spread onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) with adhesive tape to control the film thickness. After dried in air, the film was heated up to 450 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained for 30 min. After calcination, another layer of PMSs slurry was deposited on the semi-transparent layer and annealed with the same heating profile. The single layer films, nanocrystal film, blend film and PMS film, were prepared in similar processes. In addition, the active areas of the films are controlled at ∼0.25 cm2 by scratching off the excess film.
Fabrication of QDSSCs
A modified version of chemical bath deposition method was applied to load the CdS and CdSe QDs onto the TiO2 photoanode. For the deposition of the CdS QDs, an aqueous solution with the composition of 0.02 mM CdCl2, 0.14 mM thiourea, 0.07 mM NH4Cl and 0.23 mM ammonia with a final pH of ∼9.0 in the chemical bath was heated at 10 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, TiO2/CdS films were immersed in an aqueous solution containing 0.026 mM CdSO4, 0.04 mM N(CH2COONa)3 and 0.026 mM Na2SeO3 for 4.5 h in the same way. Both QDs (CdS and CdSe) deposition films were washed with distilled water. For the ZnS passivation, all the films, after sensitization, were deposited by alternatively dipping them twice into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions for 1 min per dip, rinsing with deionized water between dips. Cu2S on brass was used as a counter electrode according to the literature. The CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized photoanodes and counter electrodes were sandwiched to form the cell, which was separated by adhesive tape spacer (∼60 μm in thickness). The electrolyte composed of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S in deionized water was injected into the cell via capillarity.
Photovoltage measurements
Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system using a simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). The cells were placed 25 cm away from the light source and illuminated from the front side. Incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 source meter under the irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). The optical diffusion reflection spectra and absorbance spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-4100).
Transient photoelectron dynamic measurements
Two light emitting diodes (LED 530 nm) were used as the bias light source to generate the steady voltages and the pulse excitation light source to produce transient signals. Light from these two LEDs was collected by two identical lens groups and imaged on the QDSSC surface with a spot size of 8 mm × 8 mm. The bias light intensity could be adjusted from 1 μW to 60 μW by a DC regulated power supply to generate different steady open circuit voltages. The pulse light LED was driven by a self-made pulse amplifier and the excitation light intensity was set as 2 μJ per pulse with a duration of 50 μs. The photovoltage transients under different steady bias voltages were directly recorded using an oscilloscope (Lecroy 64Xs) with an input resistance of 1 MΩ. The photocurrent transients under different bias voltages were recorded using an oscilloscope with an input resistance of 50 Ω and shunted with a 50 Ω series resistor. Moreover, a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR445A) was also incorporated in front of the oscilloscope. The as-obtained photovoltage decay curves were fitted by Matlab 7.0 with an exponential function of y = y0 + A1 exp(−x/t1) + A2 exp(−x/t2), where y0 is the baseline, A1 and A2 are the pre-exponential factors, and t1 and t2 are the time constants. Afterwards, the recombination lifetime (τr) and the collection time (τcol) are calculated according to the equation τ = (A1t1 + A2t2)/(A1 + A2).
Results and discussions

Fig. 1a and b depict the PMSs prepared via a one-step solvothermal method. The as-prepared products are in spherical shape, and the inset diameter distribution histogram indicates that the diameter of the product ranges from 100 to 600 nm, with an average size of 331.9 nm. Moreover, the zoom-in SEM image shows that the spheres are assembled from nano-sized spindles about several nanometers in diameter and several tens of nanometers in length. Compared with the well-defined spheres with uniform diameter, the polydisperse product could increase the connection between the adjacent spheres and lead to a better electron transport when used as photoanode materials.45,46 In addition, a control experiment was carried out to reveal the growth mechanism of the as-prepared PMSs. Fig. S1a and b† presents the SEM images of the intermediate products collected at 30 min. It is evident that polydisperse spheres were formed in the reaction with the smooth surface. As it is demonstrated in our previous work, in this reaction system, amorphous precursor spheres were first formed by the coordination between the Ti and carboxyl groups and the later cross link of the Ti contained complexes, which would function as a template to guide the in situ crystallization of the polydisperse spheres.47,48 Compared with the intermediate spheres, these crystallized PMSs have smaller size distributions, indicating that the crystallization leads to diameter shrinkage of the intermediate products. The corresponding TEM image shows the as-prepared product processes mesoporous structures (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the sprout-like crystals at the surface of the sphere exhibit sharp tips and spindle-like configuration (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, in the HRTEM image of the tip area of an individual nanospindle, the well-defined lattice fringes with inter-plane spacing of 0.35 nm indicate that the primary nanospindles are highly crystallized with anatase phase structure (Fig. 1e).49 The XRD pattern of the PMSs is presented in Fig. 2a, in which all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1271). The nitrogen adsorption isotherm, as shown in Fig. 2b, exhibits a type-IV isotherm with H3-type hysteresis at high relative pressures, which confirms the existence of large pores in this sample.50,51 A narrow pore size distribution with a peak size of about 17 nm is observed in the pore-size distribution curve (the inset of Fig. 2b). Moreover, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the sample is measured as ∼82.2 m2 g−1. Fig. S2a† shows the anatase nanocrystals prepared by simply reducing the precursor dosage in a similar preparation system. The as-prepared nanocrystals are about ∼15 nm in average diameter, with BET surface area of ∼89.3 m2 g−1. The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S2b†) suggests the products exhibit well-crystallized anatase structure. Moreover, it is obvious that the diffraction peaks belonging to (103), (004) and (112) are integrated together, indicating the broadening of the diffraction peaks due to the decreased particle size.52

The as-prepared polydisperse spheres and the nanocrystals were employed as raw materials to fabricate four types of photoanodes to study their structural influence on the performance in QDSSCs. Fig. 3 shows the cross sections of the four photoanode films: (a) nanocrystal film, (b) blend film, (c) bilayer film and (d) PMS film, which are denoted as Film-1, Film-2, Film-3 and Film-4, respectively. The film thicknesses are all controlled at ∼14 μm, and the bilayer film is composed of PMS and nanocrystal layers equal in thickness (∼7 μm). Fig. 4a presents the UV-Vis reflection spectra of the four photoanode films without QDs loading. Film-2 assembled from the mixture of nanocrystals and PMSs exhibits a similar reflectance behavior compared with Film-1; the reflectance value plummets in the visible and red region, indicating the high transmittance of low energy photons. Moreover, compared with Film-3, Film-4 possesses a better scattering effect because the film is solely constructed by PMSs. Furthermore, characteristic photonic reflection peaks are observed in Film-4 and Film-3, which are in good agreement with the size-dependent behavior of the light scattering effect.53Fig. 4b depicts the transmittance spectrum of the photoanode after QDs loading. The transmittance in the region of 400–600 nm is associated with the absorption of CdS/CdSe QDs, which reflects the loading amount in the photoanode.54 Particularly, the peak at the 400–500 nm region is related to absorption of CdS QDs and that at the 550–650 nm region derives from the absorption of CdSe QDs. The curves at the region of 650–800 nm depend on the scattering effect of the films. Film-1 has the highest transmittance, suggesting that the nanocrystal film is not a suitable candidate to promote the loading process of the QDs. Although the transmittance of Film-2 is slightly reduced, it is still much higher compared with Film-3 and Film-4. Moreover, Film-3 outperforms Film-1 and Film-2 at both the 400–600 nm and 600–800 nm regions, which respectively result from the high QDs loading amount and the improved scattering effect, which helps to trap low energy photons in the photoanode. Film-4 has the lowest transmittance in the whole wavelength, which implies that a greater amount of QDs with high coverage ratio was supposed to form on the PMSs film.

 Fig. 4  (a) UV-Vis reflection spectra of the photoanode film, (b) the transmittance spectra of the photoanode film after QDs loading. 
Moreover, QDs loading difference could be further confirmed by the EDX mapping analysis. Fig. 5 shows the element percentage composition (Cd, Ti) on the surface of Film-1 and Film-4 after QDs loading. The Cd/Ti ratios are 0.34/1 (Fig. 5a, a1 and a2) and 0.48/1 (Fig. 5b, b1 and b2) for the two films, indicating that Film-4 has a much higher QDs loading amount, although PMSs possess relatively lower surface area. As shown in the illustration of Fig. 5c, the closely-packed nanocrystals film cannot afford enough channels for the diffusion of the precursor solution, and the channels could be easily blocked by the ever growing QDs (the left side carton). The central image reveals that the adjacent aggregated spheres leave many voids unoccupied in the film structure, which could increase the diffusion cross section of the precursor solution. The QDs loading process accompanied by the continuous in situ consumption of the solute (the Cd2+ and the S2− or Se2− species) in the precursor solution, which would lead to a concentration gradient between the precursor solutions trapped in the film structure and the bulk reaction system. According to the Frick's first law, the diffusion rate of the solutes would proportionally increase to the diffusion cross section, if the diffusion coefficient and the concentration gradient are considered as constants. Therefore, in the PMS film, the concentration gradient could be rapidly filled up due to the greater diffusion cross section, which could facilitate the QDs growth. As for Film-2, the mixed nanocrystals could fill the voids between the adjacent spheres. In this sense, the mixed film could be considered as a nanoparticle film (the right side carton). Therefore, it could be concluded that the PMS film holds the structural priority in facilitating the QDs loading process, and the pore structure of the film is much important than the surface area in facilitating the QDs loading process.55,56

The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) characteristics of the QDSSCs based on the four photoanodes are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Compared with Cell-1, Cell-2 had an enhanced conversion efficiency of 3.47%, which was attributed to the increased short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and filling factor (FF). Meanwhile, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of QDSSCs remain almost unchanged. Cell-3, based on the bilayer photoanode, outperformed the other cells in all the list parameters: FF of 55%, Voc of 608 mV and Jsc of 14.06 mA cm−2, which leads to the highest PCE of 4.70%, indicating an ∼54% augment compared with the nanocrystal cell. Based on the optical test of the photoanode, the increased Jsc is estimated to be resulting from the high light capture ability of the photoanode. In addition, the high QDs loading amount also helped to improve the Voc and FF of the cell, by building a physical passivation layer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Cell-4, which derives from the PMSs photoanode, was also tested. Although Cell-4 has higher QDs loading amount and greater scattering effect, the Jsc and Voc was slightly decreased, which leads to a reduced PCE of 4.18% compared with Cell-3.

Fig. 7 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in function of wavelength for the four QDSSCs. Due to the improved scattering effect and the high QDs loading amount, Cell-3 and Cell-4 demonstrated higher IPCE values. The absolute IPCE of Cell-3 was higher than the other cells in the entire wavelength region, which was in good agreement with the corresponding high Jsc. In addition, compared with Cell-3, the characteristic peak at 500–650 nm is obviously clearer, which indicates that the scattering effect in Cell-4 is more prominent. However, as it is demonstrated in eqn (1), the IPCE value of IPCE = ηlh × ηinj × ηcol(1)
 Fig. 7  Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the as-prepared QDSSCs. 
DSSCs are determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the film (ηlh), the injection (ηinj) and collection efficiencies (ηcol) of the photoelectrons, which are affected by the structure of the photoelectrode.57 Although Cell-4 has the higher light harvesting efficiency, the lower IPCE value, compared with Cell-3, may be caused by the loss of photoelectron collection efficiency.
The massive charge recombination, dominantly occurring at TiO2/electrolyte, QDs/electrolyte and FTO/electrolyte interfaces, is considered as an important source for the low PCE of QDSSCs. In order to shed light on the electron recombination dynamics, QDSSCs were tested by the transient photovoltage measurement. At the open circuit condition, the free photoelectrons injected in the conduction band of the TiO2 would all recombine with the redox species at the aforementioned three interfaces, resulting in an exponential decay of the photovoltage, and the in situ electron recombination lifetime (τr) is, therefore, estimated by the exponential fitting of the photovoltage transient decay curves.58Fig. 8 depicts the τr obtained at different bias voltages. The bias voltage was induced by applying steady illumination on the cells, which could fill electrons in the energy states of TiO2 with stepwise sequence from deep traps, shallow traps to the conduction band. As the bias voltage is increased, more trap states were filled and the pulse illumination generated photoelectrons are injected into the higher energy levels, which induces a faster recombination as the pulse illumination is removed. Therefore, the as-obtained τr value experiences a decreasing trend as the bias voltage increases, which is in accordance with the previous reports.59,60 As the PMSs are mixed into the film structure (Cell-2), τr is generally increased compared with that of the nanocrystal cell (Cell-1). The primary nanoparticles in PMSs are closely linked compared with the individual nanoparticles, which could help to decrease the number of grain boundaries, minimize the density of the trap states and reduce the recombination opportunities. Meanwhile, Cell-3 has a greater τr than that of Cell-4 derived from pure PMSs photoanode, implying that the recombination between the injected photoelectrons and the electron acceptors in the bilayer photoanode is effectively retarded. Although Film-4 has higher QDs loading amount and better light scattering effect, the Achilles' heel is that the packing of the submicron-sized PHMs usually leaves a portion of the FTO surface uncovered.61 For the bilayer cell, the first deposited nanoparticles in the bilayer film give a better coverage of FTO and alleviate the electron leaking at the FTO/electrolyte interface, which contributed to the higher τr in Cell-3.
 Fig. 8  The electron recombination lifetime of the four cells in function of the applied voltages obtained from the transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements. 
In addition, the Voc of the QDSSC device could be expressed as:54 (2)where R is the molar gas constant, T the temperature, β the reaction order of Sn− and electrons, F the Faraday constant, A the electrode surface area for light absorption, I the incident photon flux, n0 the accessible electronic state concentration in the conduction band, kb the backward reaction kinetic constant of the injected electrons with polysulfide electrolyte and kr the recombination kinetic constant of the electrons with oxidized QDs (D+). At a given I, the high light harvesting grate would increase the electron concentration in the TiO2 conduction band. Moreover, the suppressed recombination of the charge carriers reduced the values of kb and kr, which finally results in the higher Voc of Cell-3.
The electron collection time (τcol) was tested by transient photocurrent measurement (TPC). In removing the pulse illumination, the cells are switched to short circuit condition and the external circuit is series connected with a 50 ohm resistor, which is shunted with a voltmeter. Therefore, the photo-separated electrons and holes would transport through the out circuit, and the fading of photocurrent could be monitored by the voltage decay obtained from the voltmeter.62Fig. 9 displays the collection time (τcol) of the photoelectron in function of bias voltages. In addition, it is evident that Cell-3 has the lowest τcol at the whole bias voltage range, indicating the photoelectrons could be more effectively transported in the film structure and collected by the substrate compared with the other cells. According to eqn (3),63 De = d2/2.35τcol(3)the electron diffusion coefficient (De) could be calculated, where d is the film thickness and τcol is collection lifetime obtained as the no bias voltage was applied (0 V). As a result, Cell-4 shows a high De of 142.0 × 10−9 m2 s−1, while the De of Cell-1, Cell-2 and Cell-3 reach 62.7 × 10−9, 96.3 × 10−9 and 99.1 × 10−9 m2 s−1, respectively. For Cell-1, a great amount of grain boundaries and surface defects are present in the nanoparticle-based film, which would slow down the electron hopping from the generating sites to the FTO collector and lead to lower De. As indicated in previous studies, the introduction of PMSs with interconnected primary particles could lead to better electron diffusion.47,61 However, the paradox situation is the electron transport among the individual PMSs is retarded due to the insufficient physical contact of the adjacent PMSs.64 Therefore, the De of Cell-2 and Cell-3 was slightly increased. Different from the DSSC system, in spite of the TiO2 matrix, the interconnected semiconducting QDs could also serve as the electron transport pathway. Therefore, the high QDs loading amount may also help to improve the intrinsic diffusion coefficient of the photoanode structure. It could be concluded that the bilayer photoanode could well integrate the structural advantages of nanocrystals and PMSs to achieve a compromise between the QDs loading and the intrinsic TiO2 scaffold network, which results in an improved electron diffusion coefficient.

Conclusions
In summary, TiO2 polydisperse mesoporous spheres and nanocrystals were intentionally prepared to investigate the effect of the photoanode structure over the performance of QDSSCs. Based on the optical and photoelectric investigation, it was found that the bilayer cell possesses the priority to promote the harvesting of incident light by increasing the QDs loading amount and scattering effect. According to the transient photoelectron dynamic investigation, in the bilayer QDSSC, the carrier recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte and FTO/electrolyte interfaces were substantially passivated. Moreover, an electron diffusion coefficient of 142.0 × 10−9 m2 s−1 was also obtained in the bilayer cell, which almost triples the value of normally used nanoparticle cells, indicating that photoelectrons could be effectively transported and collected. Therefore, the bilayer photoanode could well integrate the structural advantages of the nanocrystal and PMSs, which finally balance the requirements of QDs loading amount, scattering effect, electron recombination and transport and lead to a high conversion efficiency of 4.70%, indicating a ∼54% and ∼12% improvement compared with the cells derived from nanocrystal and PMSs, respectively.
