    , Accepted 6th October 2017First published on 7th October 2017AbstractMagnesium tetraethynylporphyrin complexes with two aryl groups (Ar = Ph, C6H4-n-hexyl-4, C6H4-CF3-4, and C6H4-NMe2-4) and two thienyl-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole units were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reactions. Electrochemical measurements and photoelectron yield spectroscopy showed that the energy levels of the compounds could be effectively tuned by electron-withdrawing and -donating substituents on the aryl groups. Theoretical calculation revealed that the electronic effects of the Ar group substituents strongly affected the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) because the localized HOMO on the porphyrin core was conjugated with the Ar groups through ethynyl linkers. Bulk heterojunction small-molecule organic solar cells with these magnesium porphyrin electron donors were fabricated to evaluate the morphological and electronic effects of the Ar group substituents. The n-hexyl groups promoted the formation of phase-separated structures with a high fill factor, yielding a respectable power conversion efficiency of 5.73%. The use of the electron-withdrawing CF3 group gave a high open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V because of the lowered HOMO level, while the use of the electron-donating NMe2 group produced a low band gap that extended the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectrum to 1100 nm.
Introduction
Porphyrin-based small-molecule electron donors have recently emerged as a new option for use in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs)1 and dye-sensitized solar cells.2 High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in OSCs have been realized with these electron-donating materials by using the high light absorption efficiency of porphyrins and their wide absorption range that extends to the near-IR region when the porphyrin units are conjugated with electron-deficient units3,4d,e such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).5 With this type of donor, Peng and co-workers recently achieved a PCE of 9.06% by molecular engineering, examination of additives, and optimization of device fabrication conditions.3f In addition, porphyrin small-molecule electron donors were used in the rear cell of a tandem device that exhibited the highest PCE (12.50%) of solution-processed OSCs reported to date in the literature.3g
Our group has applied the meso-ethynyl-linkage concept1,4 to realize maximum conjugation of porphyrins for efficient light absorption and high carrier mobility.4a When a porphyrin and its aromatic subunits are joined via ethynyl linkers, the Q-band of the porphyrin becomes intense and red-shifted. Our design (Fig. 1) relies on a tetraethynyl core structure, whereas other high-performance porphyrin electron donors have been reported based on bis(ethynyl)porphyrin structures.3,6 With the tetraethynyl structure, we anticipate that we can design porphyrin electron donors with four-way conjugation to efficiently utilize the effects of the four substituents on the electronic structure and solid-state morphology. Another feature of our design is a Mg metal center. Mg-porphyrins can be expected to have better electron transfer properties than zinc porphyrins, with a longer excited state lifetime due to their lighter metal center.7 Importantly, the central Mg atom can increase the molecules' solubility through coordination of solvent molecules such as THF and pyridine at the metal center, which is quite beneficial for both materials synthesis and device fabrication. After film fabrication, solvent molecules can be removed by heating to create effective intermolecular π–π stacking for high carrier mobility.4d This concept is similar to that of latent pigments such as tetrabenzoporphyrins, which can be thermally converted from their precursors via elimination of four ethene molecules to form a π-stacked structure.8 In our system, however, the central metal atom offers coordination sites for π-ligands to control electronic effects and the morphology without removal of the ligands.

Here we report on Mg-tetraethynylporphyrins (TEPs) with two aryl groups bearing alkyl, electron-withdrawing, and electron-donating substituents for morphological and electronic control as well as two thienyl-substituted DPP moieties. DPP has been widely used as an electron-deficient building block in OSC materials. The DPP's rigid planar structure often enhances interchain packing and thereby increases charge carrier mobility.9,10 A PCE of 5.73% was achieved with an n-hexyl substituent on the aryl groups, which produced a phase-separated structure. Our aim in this study is to contribute to the molecular design of small-molecular porphyrin donors to realize nature-inspired Mg-porphyrin-based OSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of TEP-based electron donors
Mg-TEPs conjugated with electron-deficient DPP units were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling with monobrominated dithienyl DPP (Th-DPP-ThBr, Scheme 1). In our previous studies, we used triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) groups as solubilizing groups in a trans arrangement around the TEP core unit. In the present work, we did not use TIPS groups as solubilizing groups and instead opted to use two peripheral aryl groups for electronic and morphological tuning. We anticipated that solubility would be effectively improved by not only the aliphatic chains on the DPP groups but also the solvent molecules coordinated to Mg. Here we used TIPS groups as protecting groups for the synthesis of the target molecules.11 We synthesized Mg-TIPSTEP-Ph2 (1a, magnesium 5,15-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-10,20-bis(phenylethynyl)porphyrinate) by our previously reported method and removed the TIPS groups with nBu4NF to obtain a terminal alkyne, Mg-TEP-Ph2H2. Then, we prepared the target molecule Mg-TEP-DPP2Ph2 (2a) by Sonogashira coupling with monobrominated DPP. In this work, 4-n-hexyl-, 4-trifluoromethyl-, and 4-dimethylamino-substituted phenyl groups were used to tune the morphological and electronic effects. Compounds 2b–d were synthesized in the same way by this deprotection and Sonogashira coupling strategy. The obtained compounds 2a–d were air-stable dark purple solids.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to Mg-TEP-DPP2Ar2. 
Compounds 2a–c were highly soluble in THF and moderately soluble in NEt3, CH2Cl2, and CHCl3. On the other hand, 2d had low solubility, even in THF. Compounds 2a–d were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. When we used chloroform-d for the NMR measurements of 2a–d, we observed marked peak broadening due to intermolecular interactions. To avoid this problem, we used THF-d8, which can coordinate to the Mg center to suppress intermolecular interactions to some degree. Previously reported Mg-porphyrins such as Mg-TIPSTEP did not exhibit such behavior and gave sharp signals in chloroform-d in NMR measurements. These observations indicate that introducing planar aryl groups induced intimate π–π stacking through overlapping π-orbitals. In particular, 2d with the 4-dimethylaminophenyl group had strong π–π interactions and did not give sharp NMR signals, even in THF-d8. This behavior is attributed to the compound's high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (see the section “Theoretical calculations” below) as well as strong π-overlap between the electron-rich dimethylaminophenyl group and electron-deficient DPP group because of the compound's low band gap. Thus, the NMR spectrum of 2d was measured in 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4 at high temperature (120 °C). The 1H NMR signals due to the two thiophene–DPP–thiophene units and those due to the two aryl groups were symmetric, indicating that there was no diastereotopic effect of the four racemic 2-ethylhexyl groups on the spectrum. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2a, doublets at 9.47 and 9.57 ppm were observed for the porphyrin core. One triplet at 7.24 ppm and four doublets at 7.77, 7.88, 9.09, and 9.22 ppm were assigned to the thienyl groups. The methylene groups on the nitrogen atoms appeared at 4.00–4.18 ppm as multiplets. The protons of other alkyl protons were located at 1.87–2.03 ppm.
Photophysical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV spectra of 2a–d. All the compounds exhibited strong absorption at the Soret band around 500 nm and the Q-band around 800 nm, owing to the ethynylporphyrin structure. Typically, the Q-band of porphyrins is observed around 700 nm. This significant redshift can be explained by the acceptor–donor–acceptor structure of DPP–porphyrin–DPP. However, because of the electron-withdrawing groups on the Ar groups of 2c, its Q-band absorption was blue-shifted (λmax = 765 nm) compared with that of 2a. In contrast, the electron-donating groups in 2d induced a larger redshift of the Q-band absorption (λmax = 812 nm). The Q-band offset of 2d, was extended to an especially long wavelength of 1000 nm, which is of interest for OSC applications from the viewpoint of light harvesting. The Q-band offset was further red-shifted to 1200 nm when 2d was prepared as a solid thin film (Fig. S11†).
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of 2a (red), 2b (blue), 2c (green), and 2d (purple) in THF. UV-vis absorption spectra of 2a–d in dichloromethane and as solid thin films are shown in Fig. S10 and S11,† respectively. 
We examined the electrochemical properties of 2a–d by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S12†) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, Fig. S13 and S14†). For all the compounds, four reversible reduction peaks and a broad reversible oxidation peak were observed. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the DPV results (Table 1). The energy band gap (HOMO–LUMO) of 2a was 1.67 eV, narrower than the band gaps of similar compounds that have aryl units directly linked to the porphyrin framework.6 The low band gap of 2a can be explained by the extension of the π-conjugated system through the sp1 hybrid orbitals in the ethynyl linker and charge transfer band in the acceptor–donor–acceptor structure. The data in Table 1 show that energy levels of the compounds can be tuned by the Ar units with electron-withdrawing or -donating groups.

a Values were determined by DPV. Measurements were performed in THF solution containing TBAPF6 (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte at 25 °C at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Glassy-carbon, platinum wire, and Ag/AgClO4 electrodes were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential was corrected against Fc/Fc+. The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated by using the following equations: HOMO = −(4.8 + Eox1/2), LUMO = −(4.8 + Ered1/2). Eg = LUMO − HOMO.

In addition, we measured the ionization potential (IP) of the compounds in air by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (Table 1, Fig. S15†). Films were prepared by spin-coating a solution of 2a–d (10 mg mL−1) on chlorobenzene containing 1% pyridine. Before spin-coating, the solutions were stirred at 80 °C for 1 h to break up the intermolecular stacking. The measured IPs of 2a–d were −5.18 to −5.45, slightly more negative than expected from the measured HOMO levels. To explain this, we speculated that the pyridine additive served as an electron-withdrawing ligand on Mg. The IPs were in the order of 2c < 2a ≤ 2b < 2d, in accordance with the HOMO levels determined by electrochemical measurements in solution. This order is also consistent with the character of the Ar group substituents from most electron-withdrawing to most electron-donating: 4-CF3-C6H4 > Ph > 4-n-hexyl-C6H4 > 4-Me2N-C6H4. Solid-state samples of 2a–d, which were prepared by crushing the samples in a sample holder, showed the same order of IPs: 2c < 2a ≤ 2b < 2d (Table 1, Fig. S16†). In this case, the IPs were higher than those of the samples coordinated with pyridine and were comparable with the HOMO levels determined by electrochemical measurements. In sum, we confirmed the electronic effects of the Ar group substituents on the HOMO levels and IPs.
Next, we evaluated the IPs of pyridine complexes of 2a–d (Fig. S17†). We prepared the pyridine complexes 2a–d·py by adding several drops of pyridine onto the solids of 2a–d in 100 mL flasks, followed by addition of n-hexane (several tens of milliliters, e.g., roughly 30–50 mL) to reprecipitate the pyridine complex. After filtration of 2a–d·py, we dried the compounds in vacuo at room temperature for 12 h. The obtained complexes 2a–d·py were dark green (Fig. 3), different from the dark purple color of 2a–d. The IPs of 2a–d·py were −5.17, −5.15, −5.44, and −4.94 eV, respectively, all of which were more negative than those of the corresponding non-coordinated solid compounds (Table 1). This is attributed to the electron-withdrawing properties of the pyridine ligand due to its electron-deficient nature. These more negative IPs of 2a–d·py are basically good for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (VOC) values in OSCs.
 Fig. 3  Formation of a greenish pyridine complex of 2d (middle and right). The starting material 2d is also shown (left). 
We performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate how many pyridines coordinate to the Mg metal center and what temperature is necessary to remove the pyridine ligands from the Mg metal center in 2a–d·py. The results showed that only one molecule of pyridine was coordinated to the Mg centers in complexes 2a–d·py. This agrees with previous reports12 and X-ray crystallographic analysis of a pyridine complex of 1a (ESI†). We observed ligand dissociation temperatures of 88, 107, 111, and 71 °C for 2a–d·py, respectively (Fig. 4 and S18†). The ligand coordination was found to be generally strong when an electron-withdrawing group was present on the Ar group. We consider that σ-donation of pyridine to the Mg(II) center is more important than π-back donation for coordination because it is a d0-metal center. This observation agrees well with 2d showing low solubility due to weak coordination. Because the thin films were not thermally annealed (see below), the electron donors used in OSCs were present as pyridine complexes when pyridine was used as a solvent additive.

Theoretical calculations
To understand the electronic structure in depth, we performed theoretical calculations13 using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. In these calculations, we used isobutyl groups instead of 2-ethylhexyl groups to avoid the issue of chirality and reduce computational cost. We also replaced the n-hexyl groups in 2b with methyl groups. We carried out structural optimization of Mg-porphyrins with Ph (2a′), C6H4-Me-4 (2b′), C6H4-CF3-4 (2c′), and C6H4-NMe2-4 (2d′) as the Ar groups. The optimized structure of 2a′ is shown in Fig. 5, and the chemical structures and calculated values of 2a′–d′ are shown in Fig. S19 and Tables S1 and S2.† The results showed that, except for the isobutyl groups, the molecules were almost completely planar.
 Fig. 5  Optimized structure of 2a′ (top view and side view). 
Calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of 2a′–d′ and their band gaps are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO and LUMO levels increased in magnitude in the order of 2c′ < 2a′ < 2b′ < 2d′, and their band gaps decreased in the order of 2c′ > 2a′ > 2b′ > 2d′. These trends agreed with the UV-vis absorption and DPV results. This order is related to the relative electron-donating ability of the Ar group substituents. The Ar group substituents appeared to have a strong effect on the HOMO levels, but not the LUMO levels; thus, the changing HOMO levels accounted for the changes in the band gaps. The distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs are shown in Fig. S20.† The HOMOs were clearly present on the Ar groups but the LUMOs were not. This tendency was most evident for 2d′. As a result, the electron-donating substituents raised the HOMO levels, thus narrowing the HOMO–LUMO gap in 2d′. We conclude that changing substituents in the Ar group can effectively tune not only the HOMO energy level but also the molecular band gap, both of which are important for controlling photovoltaic performance.

We next estimated the effect of the coordinated solvent molecules. We calculated the optimized structures of 2a′–d′ with pyridine or THF coordinated to the Mg center (2a′–d′·py and 2a′–d′·thf, respectively), and the results are shown in Fig. 6, S19, and S21 and Tables S1–S3.† The HOMO and LUMO levels were raised 0.09–0.13 eV by the coordinated solvent molecules, and the effect of pyridine was slightly larger than that of THF (ca. 0.01 V). The coordination effect increased slightly with increasing electron-donating ability, and hence the band gap of 2d′ narrowed to the greatest extent. We also estimated stabilization energy due to coordination. The differences in calculated free energy between 2a′–d′ + pyridine and 2a′–d′·py and between 2a′–d′ + THF and 2a′–d′·thf are summarized in Table 3. Coordination of pyridine or THF to the Mg center in 2a′–d′ was found to be exothermic. The degree of stabilization by the coordinated pyridine ligand was slightly larger than that by the coordinated THF ligand. The stabilization effect tended to increase, increasing the electron-withdrawing ability (Table 3). This is in accordance with the TGA data and the strong intermolecular interaction of 2d observed during NMR measurement, even in THF.

Fabrication of OSCs and photovoltaic properties
We fabricated solution-processed bulk heterojunction OSCs using porphyrin-based small-molecule organic electron donors with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al (ITO = indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate). The optimized standard conditions for comparison among different electron donors were Mg-TEP-DPP2Ar2 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) films as the electron-donating and -accepting materials, respectively, with a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w), a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 for the donor/acceptor mixture, chlorobenzene as the solvent, and 1% pyridine as an additive. The optimized device with 2a under these conditions had a PCE of 4.85% with a moderate VOC of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.3 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.49 (Table 4 entry 2, Fig. 7). A critical step for obtaining good PCEs was heating the active layer solution at 80 °C for 1 h prior to spin-coating. If this was not done, PCEs dropped by about 30–50% and reproducibility became poor. We attribute these results to the breaking up of intermolecular interactions before spin-coating at elevated temperature, which is important in fabricating effective bulk heterojunction films. Without the use of the pyridine additive, PCEs decreased by about 10% (Table 4 entry 1). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized standard devices are shown in Fig. 8. As expected from the absorption spectra that extended to the long wavelength region, the offset of the IPCE spectrum of the device using 2a reached 1000 nm (Fig. 8).

We found that, in comparison with the performance of the 2a:PC61BM device, the 2b:PC61BM device had a higher FF, which is advantageous for achieving higher PCE. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed a phase-separated surface for the 2b:PC61BM films (Fig. 9e–h). We consider that the n-hexyl group was responsible for forming the phase-separated structure, which enabled better charge transport. On the other hand, the surface of the 2a:PC61BM film was smooth (Fig. 9a–d). We observed a slight decrease in root-mean-square roughness values in films prepared with pyridine compared with films prepared without pyridine.

Root-mean-square roughness values (Rq) were 0.42, 0.37, 2.84, and 1.17 nm, respectively. AFM images of thin films of 2c:PC61BM and 2d:PC61BM prepared with the 1% pyridine solvent additive are shown in Fig. S22.† Morphology change after thermal annealing of these films is shown in Fig. S23.† 
Interestingly, 2b gave a high PCE when the concentration of the active layer solution was increased from 20 mg mL−1 to 30 mg mL−1. The phase separation behavior and high solubility of 2b with the n-hexyl group make it advantageous over electron donor 2a. Using 2b, we achieved a PCE of 5.73% with a VOC of 0.69 V, JSC of 14.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.56 (Table 4 entry 5). The high PCE was mainly attributed to the high JSC without loss of VOC and FF. We found that the 1% pyridine additive was essential for achieving this high PCE. When we did not use pyridine, the PCE dropped to 4.36% (Table 4 entry 3). We surmise that excessive aggregation of 2b occurred in the absence of pyridine in highly concentrated active layer solution. We also examined an active layer solution concentration of 40 mg mL−1 (obtained performance: PCE = 4.56%, JSC = 12.92 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.69 V, and FF = 0.52, Table 4 entry 6), but we found 30 mg mL−1 was the optimal condition.
Next, we investigated the electron-withdrawing and -donating effects of the Ar groups connected in conjugation to the porphyrin core through the ethynyl linkers. The device using 2c fabricated under the optimized standard conditions (active layer solution, 20 mg mL−1) showed a relatively high VOC of 0.79 V. This is because the HOMO level was lowered by the electron-withdrawing CF3 group connected to the porphyrin. However, JSC decreased, resulting in a PCE of just 1.65% (Table 4 entry 7). The obtained VOC value was fairly good compared with the values for various OSCs utilizing low-band-gap materials in research by Peng and co-workers targeting low energy loss in porphyrin OSCs.3e,f On the other hand, the device using 2d had a PCE of 2.33% and exhibited a wide wavelength range of photocurrent conversion that extended to 1100 nm (Table 4 entry 8). This is attributed to the HOMO level being raised by the electron-donating NMe2 group. The PCE increased to 3.06% when a 30 mg mL−1 active layer solution was used (Table 4 entry 9). Overall, the modification of the substituents on the Ar group was able to electronically tune the HOMO level of these electron donors, because the HOMO was localized on the porphyrin core and the Ar groups were conjugated with the core.
The remaining topics for investigation include the use of phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and the application of thermal annealing (Table 4 entry 10 and 11). We were not yet able to obtain high performance with PC71BM. The device using 2a and PC71BM showed a PCE of 4.19%, which was lower than that of the device using PC61BM. Surprisingly, the use of 2b with PC71BM decreased the performance substantially, giving a PCE of only 0.70%. The AFM image of this active layer film showed an unusual morphology with a highly crystalline structure (Fig. S24†). This morphology reproducibly appeared when we used this combination of materials, and we ascribed it to a special influence of PC71BM on the interaction between 2b molecules. The devices made with PC71BM had a distinctive red-brown color, quite different from the silver-gray color of the devices made with PC61BM (Fig. S25†). The use of mix-PCBM14 did not improve performance with 2a or 2b (PCE = 4.78% and 4.77%, respectively, Table 4 entries 12 and 13), whereas it had done so in several cases in our previous study.15 This indicates that intermolecular interaction between 2 and PC71BM have an unfavorable effect. Thermal annealing did not improve the device performance. Generally, PCEs dropped by ∼30% when we applied thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5–10 min after spin-coating of the active layer (Table S4†). This is a common issue; for example, some low-band-gap polymers such as PTB-7 do not tolerate thermal annealing. To solve these issues, further molecular design with different substituents will be necessary in future research. Note that other coordinating solvents (THF, DMAP, NEt3, and PhCN) decreased the device performance (Table S5†). We assume that bulky coordinating solvents disturb the carrier transport path as FF was found to be decreased.
To conduct an in-depth investigation toward understanding the effect of thermal annealing, we measured the hole mobility in bulk heterojunction films of 2a–d:PC61BM by the space-charge limited current method.16 Hole-only devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/2a–d:PC61BM/MoO3/Al. The active layer was prepared using a chlorobenzene solution containing 1% pyridine. Hole mobilities of these devices were in the order of 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S26†), comparable to those of Mg-TIPSTEP.4a Among the films tested, the 2d:PC61BM film showed the highest hole mobility, 4.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compound 2d did not show a high PCE because of poor solubility and excessive aggregation due to weak ligand coordination, though it had good hole mobility because of the aggregation. Thermal annealing of the films at 100 °C for 5 min before the fabrication of the top electrode improved hole mobility in all the 2a–d:PC61BM devices (highest value, 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This observation contrasts with our observation that PCEs were decreased by thermal annealing. We can conclude that compounds 2a–d suffer from the problem of excessive aggregation due to strong intermolecular interaction, even with the use of a coordinating ligand. Overcoming this issue remains a challenge for porphyrin-based small-molecule electron donors.
For the stability test, we investigated a plot of the time of operation until 80% (T80) and 80% from the second testing measurement (TS80) to the condition of the devices in Table 4, entry 3 and 5 (Fig. S27†) without and with the pyridine additive, respectively, under continuous simulated sunlight illumination.17 The T80 numbers were 720 min and 970 min, and TS80 numbers were 2000 min and 2400 min, respectively. Both devices showed the same representation manner, but the pyridine coordinated device was slightly more stable than the device without pyridine. We examined further a longer time stability test for the pyridine devices, which showed a 35% decrease by 4000 min irradiation.
Finally, we suggest a possible way to solve the aggregation issue of these compounds by changing the device configuration. We fabricated inverted OSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO/2b:PC61BM/MoO3/Au. Without thermal annealing, the devices had a PCE of 1.97% in an inverted configuration (Fig. S28, Table S6†). After thermal annealing at 60 °C for 10 min following Au electrode deposition, the PCE increased to 3.39% (JSC = 12.96 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.56 V, and FF = 0.47). We suggest that the aggregation behavior is affected by the substrate, PEDOT:PSS, or ZnO, as well as by the choice of the electron acceptor.
Conclusion
In this study, we synthesized porphyrin-based small-molecular electron donors that had a tetraethynylporphyrin core for conjugation to two DPP electron-deficient units and two trans Ar groups for morphological and electronic tuning. The effects of the Ar group substituents were clearly observed, likely because the straight ethynyl linkers allowed for good conjugation with the porphyrin core. The n-butyl group affected the film morphology to afford a phase-separated structure, which was advantageous for obtaining high FF. Furthermore, the compound with the n-butyl group could tolerate a higher concentration of the active layer solution and had high solubility, leading to a decent PCE of 5.73%. The electron-withdrawing CF3 group and electron-donating NMe2 group strongly affected the HOMO levels through the ethynyl linkers to give high VOC (0.79 V) and extended the IPCE spectrum to 1100 nm. The acceptable PCEs and inherently low batch-to-batch variability in the characteristics of the small-molecular donors suggest that these materials could find use as one of the various standard electron donors used in OSC research. However, there are remaining issues regarding the use of PC71BM and the application of thermal annealing. Research is now under way to address these issues by further modifying the peripheral substituents and the choice of coordinating ligands.

Anhydrous solvents (stabilizer-free) were purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical. Compounds 1a, 1b, and 1d were synthesized as according to our previous literature.4a A crystal structure of 1b was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. All reactions dealing with air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under nitrogen or argon. All reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC, eluent, CH2Cl2). NMR spectra were measured on a JEOL ECA-600 spectrometer reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane. High-resolution mass spectra were acquired by MALDI using a time-of-flight mass analyzer on a Bruker Ultra exTOF/TOF spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on JASCO V-670 (for solution) and V-570 (for film) spectrometers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed using a HOKUTO DENKO HZ-5000 voltammetric analyzer. All CV measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under argon gas, equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The solvent with supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). Ionization potential was measured using a RIKEN KEIKI AC-3 photoelectron yield spectrometer in air. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under 1 Sun AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (EMS-35AAA, Ushio Spax Inc.), which was calibrated using a silicon diode (BS-520BK, Bunkoukeiki).

X-ray crystallographic measurements of 1a·py and 1b were performed on a RIGAKU R-AXIS RAPID II (imaging plate detector) using monochromic CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The positional and thermal parameters were refined by the full-matrix least-squares method using the SHELXL97 program in Yadokari software. CCDC no. of 1a·py and 1b are 1569302 and 1569294, respectively.
OSC devices fabrications
The patterned ITO substrates were cleaned by sonicating for 15 min in surfactant water, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were then dried using a N2 gun and subjected to 15 min UV/O3 treatment. Next, a filtered PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al4083) solution was deposited on the substrate via spin-coating (3000 rpm for 30 s) followed by thermal annealing in air for 10 min at 120 °C. These devices were placed in a glovebox and the active layer was deposited in a N2 atmosphere. A 30 mg mL−1 solution of porphyrin derivatives 2 and PC61BM in PhCl with 1% pyridine (v/v%) was prepared with a 1:1.5 w/w donor/acceptor ratio. The solution was allowed to remain at 80 °C for 1 hour in the nitrogen atmosphere. The films were prepared by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of the active layer was ∼120 nm. The substrates were transferred into a vacuum chamber. LiF (0.6 nm) and then Al (80 nm) were deposited on all devices. The active area (0.04 cm2) was defined by the geometric overlap between Al and ITO.
