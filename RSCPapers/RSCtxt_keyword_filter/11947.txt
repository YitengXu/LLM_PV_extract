    , Accepted 22nd January 2023First published on 23rd January 2023AbstractLead-free perovskites have received great attention in white light emitting diodes (WLEDs), displays, X-ray imaging, etc. However, it still remains a challenge to obtain high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) owing to intrinsic defect intolerance. Here, we develop a facile solvothermal method to incorporate various metal ions (M = Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, Cd3+, Bi3+, and Ce3+) into Cs2TeCl6 vacancy-ordered double perovskite microcrystals (MCs). The broadband yellow emission at 590 nm with PLQY of 6.7% was identified in Cs2TeCl6 MCs and was significantly boosted after doping with various metal ions. Interestingly, the optimum Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs exhibited a highest PLQY of 81.5% and 31 fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement compared to Cs2TeCl6 MCs. Such improvement after doping could be assigned to (i) the radiative recombination rate enhancement induced by octahedral distortion and (ii) decrease in nonradiative recombination rates caused by the decrease in electron–phonon coupling and increase in exciton binding energy. In addition, Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ also showed excellent moisture resistance and photo-stability. Thus, WLEDs with high stability and brightness based on the mixture of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ and BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ phosphors were achieved, demonstrating a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) of (0.32, 0.35), high color rendering index (CRI) of 81.3, and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5826 K. This work will facilitate the development of lead-free perovskites and expand their applications in solid-state lighting.
1. Introduction
Metal lead halide perovskites, as a type of promising optoelectronic materials, have been widely used in solar cells, photodetectors, and solid state lighting due to their attractive merits of tunable bandgap, high carrier mobility and PLQY, simple preparation, low cost, etc.1–3 However, their poor stability and lead toxicity as fatal inherent shortcomings severely restrict the practical applications.4,5 Therefore, it is urgent and significant to develop low-toxicity and stable non-lead perovskite materials that can replace lead halide perovskites. In recent years, some non- or less-toxic alternatives, such as bismuth (Bi), tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), and tellurium (Te), for substituting Pb (II) have been developed and proposed.6–8 Among diverse candidates, Te (IV) was found to be a nonmetallic element with the strongest metallic properties. Te (IV)-based lead-free perovskites have low toxicity, high stability (ΔH = −1.35 eV),9 large absorption cross-sections, and broadband yellow light emission, demonstrating potential value for lighting applications.10,11 Nevertheless, they exhibit significant drawbacks, e.g., poor PLQY, which is mainly due to the following reasons: (i) luminescence quenching, stemming from energy transfer among [TeCl6]2− octahedrons, (ii) lower defect tolerance than lead halide perovskites due to their vacancy-ordered structure, and (iii) wide bandgap with indirect character and presence of low defect formation energy.12,13 Thus, developing an effective technology to modify the photonic and optoelectronic properties of Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) is important for promoting their practical applications.
Currently, numerous works have reported that metal ion doping can effectively enhance the optical and electrical performances of perovskite materials and photoelectric devices. For instance, Zhou et al. improved the power conversion efficiency of a Si solar cell from 18.1% to 21.5% simply by coating the solar cell with Yb3+ and Ce3+ co-doped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 nanocrystal layers.14 Pan et al. obtained a blue emission at 470 nm with a PLQY of 89% in 2.5% Ni2+ ion-doped CsPbCl0.99Br2.01 quantum dots (QDs), which increased nearly three times over that of undoped CsPbClBr2 QDs. The EQE of 2.5% Ni2+ ion-doped CsPbCl0.99Br2.01 QD-based LED is 20 times higher in magnitude than that of the undoped counterparts.15 Unlike the other perovskites, the current research on Te (IV) mainly focuses on Te4+ dopant, whereas only few studies are concentrated on Te (IV) based perovskites, particularly, the information on the spectral and luminescent properties of metal ion doped Te (IV) based compounds. Very recently, Folgueras et al. achieved a bright yellow emission at 588 nm from Cs2TeCl6 single crystals with a PLQY of 2.06%.16 Quan et al. obtained 0D (Ph3S)2Sn0.92Te0.08Cl6 hybrid metal halide materials with integrated afterglow and self-trapping exciton (STE) emissions, in which the PLQY of a prompt emission peaking at 595 nm was 2.5%, and the afterglow QY of a delayed emission peaking at 520 nm was 1.7%.17 These reported Te (IV)-based lead-free perovskites still exhibit poor PLQY. Therefore, the development of Te (IV)-based lead-free perovskite with high PLQY by doping metal ions is of great significance for further understanding the intrinsic properties of vacancy ordered double perovskites and lighting applications.
Based on the above motivation, we synthesized a series of metal ion (M = Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, Cd3+, Bi3+, and Ce3+) doped lead-free Cs2TeCl6 MCs using a facile solvothermal method. The broadband yellow emissions were identified with the obvious absorption and emission enhancement in Cs2TeCl6:M MCs. The highest PL enhancement is 31 folds in Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs with a PLQY of 81.5%, compared to the pristine Cs2TeCl6 MCs with a PLQY of 6.7%. The octahedral distortion, low electron–phonon coupling, and high exciton binding energy after Cr3+ doping contribute to the enhanced radiative transition rate and decrease in nonradiative recombination rates, thereby improving the PLQY. Finally, we fabricated WLEDs, with high brightness and stability, based on Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs with a high CRI of 81.3 and a CCT of 5826 K.
2. Results and discussion
Metal ion (M = Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, Cd3+, Bi3+, and Ce3+) doped Cs2TeCl6 MCs were prepared through a modified solvothermal method (see ESI†).18,19 As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the crystal structure of Cs2TeCl6 MCs (left panel) belongs to the cubic space group Fmm with a vacancy-ordered double perovskite structure, in which the [TeCl6]2− octahedral structural units are alternatively arranged with the vacancies and separated by Cs+ cations. After doping, taking Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs as an example, the formed [CrCl6]3− octahedron partially replaces [TeCl6]2− octahedron (right panel). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1 (ESI†) demonstrate that all the diffraction peaks for each sample match well with the standard pattern of Cs2TeCl6 (JCPDS No. 75-0377), which are sharp without additional peaks. It suggests that as-grown crystals are of phase purity with high crystallinity. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the MCs gradually shift toward the larger angles through doping with Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, and Cd3+, while that of the MCs gradually move to the lower angles by incorporating Ce3+ and Bi3+. Since the ionic radius of Te4+ (0.97 Å) is larger than that of Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, and Cd3+ (0.61–0.95 Å), while it is smaller than that of Ce3+ and Bi3+ (1.02 Å and 1.03 Å), the lattice contraction/expansion caused by the partial substitution of Te4+ site with doping ions leads to different shift directions of diffraction peaks. With increasing Cr3+ doping concentration, the diffraction peaks move to the larger angle, contributing to the increased substitution of Te4+ by Cr3+ (Fig. S1, ESI†). The practical doping concentration in Cs2TeCl6:M MCs was identified by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), demonstrating the variations from 0.03 to 6.73 mol% in Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs (Table S1, ESI†).

(e) SEM image and EDS elemental mappings of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs. (f) High-resolution XPS spectra of pure and Cr3+ doped Cs2TeCl6 MCs. 
To further confirm the crystal structure information of the as-prepared samples, the Cs2TeCl6 host was used as an initial structural model, and Rietveld refinement was taken based on the General Structure Analysis System package. Fig. 1c and d show the experimental and calculated diffraction data of Cs2TeCl6 and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, in which the black crosses represent the calculated diffraction data, the red solid lines indicate the measured diffraction data, the green vertical lines mark the location of the simulated diffraction patterns, and the solid blue lines show the deviation between the measured and calculated values. All diffraction peaks of samples are indexed to the cubic cell with a space group Fmm and show small R-factors and χ2 in the refinement model, indicating good quality and stable refinement results. The clear crystallographic data information is shown in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The refined unit cell parameters of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ are a = b = c = 10.473 Å, V = 1148.765 Å3, which are smaller than that of Cs2TeCl6 (a = b = c = 10.500 Å, V = 1157.798 Å3), indicating the successful substitution of larger Te4+ (0.97 Å) by smaller Cr3+ (0.61 Å). Generally, the ionic sizes or electronic effects of Cr3+ and Te4+ cations influence the octahedral tilt angles and the associated bond angles. As shown in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†), the parameters of selected bond distances (Å) and angles (deg.) change slightly after doping with Cr3+, which can cause octahedral distortion and affect various chemical and physical properties of Cs2TeCl6 MCs. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images exhibit that the Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs have mean particle sizes in the range of 7–10 μm, as illustrated in Fig. 1e and Fig. S2 (ESI†). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping demonstrates the homogeneous distributions of Cr, Cs, Te, and Cl elements in the Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs lattice. The chemical compositions of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs were checked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), displaying the presence of Cr, Cs, Te, and Cl elements in Fig. 1f and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Moreover, the binding energies of Te4+ 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 decrease after doping with Cr3+, while that of Cs+ and Cl− show little variation. These indicate that Cr3+ has been successfully incorporated into the lattices of Cs2TeCl6 MCs and mainly occupies the Te4+ sites. All of the above results suggest that Cr3+ is successfully doped into Cs2TeCl6 MCs.
The optical properties of pure and metal ion-doped Cs2TeCl6 MCs were further investigated. As recorded in Fig. 2a (left) and Fig. S4 (ESI†), all samples display the obvious absorption spanning from 260–500 nm with two distinguishable absorption bands in the range of 260–350 nm and 350–500 nm. After metal ion doping, the absorption band edges of Cs2TeCl6 MCs doped with Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, and Cd3+ shift to the higher energy from 503 nm to 489 nm, while that of Ce3+ and Bi3+ doped MCs red-shift to 510 nm. Such a phenomenon is mainly assigned to the lattice contraction/expansion of MCs by substituting Te4+ with various metal ions, consistent with the XRD observation in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). According to the previous reports,10,20 the observed absorption region of 350–500 nm can be assigned to the 1S0 → 3P1 transition (A band) of Te4+, while that of 260–350 nm comes from the 1S0 → 3P2 transition (B band) of Te4+. It can be seen that the absorption intensities increase with the incorporation of metal ions and the Cr3+ doping amount (Fig. 2a and Fig. S4, ESI†). As known, the energy levels of Te4+ with external electron shell of s2 configuration is composed of ground state 1S0, triplet/singlet excited state 3P0, 3P1, 3P2, and 1P1. According to the s → p transitions rule of s2 ions, the transition of 1S0 → 3P1 (A band) is partially allowed by spin–orbit coupling (SOC) interaction, and 1S0 → 3P2 (B band) is forbidden.21,22 However, the previous reports evidenced that doping would alter the SOC effect.23–25 Moreover, the octahedral distortion induced by doping breaks partially forbidden s → p transitions. Thus, these two reasons lead to an increase in absorption.26,27

Fig. 2a (right) and Fig. S5a (ESI†) present the PL spectra of pristine and doped Cs2TeCl6 MCs. A weak and negligible broadband emission at 590 nm from pristine Cs2TeCl6 MCs is identified, which shows a similar shift trend of the emission peaks with absorption band along with the sharp increase in emission intensity after doping with various metal ions. As presented in Fig. 2b and Table S6 (ESI†), the PLQY of pristine Cs2TeCl6 MCs is 6.7%, which significantly increases to 20.2%, 45%, 64%, and 81.5% for Cs2TeCl6:Yb3+, Cs2TeCl6:Bi3+, Cs2TeCl6:Mn2+, and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, respectively. Moreover, the PLQY initially increases, then decreases with varying doping concentrations of Cr3+, reaching the maximum value of 81.5% at 4.89% doping concentration (Fig. S6, ESI†). The inset in Fig. 2b is a PL image of pure Cs2TeCl6 and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs under 380 nm UV light excitation. Fig. 2c exhibits the enhancement factors of absorption, PLQY, and PL with different metal ion doping, compared to the pristine Cs2TeCl6. The emission intensity of Cs2TeCl6 MCs with 4.89% Cr3+ doping is the highest with an enhancement factor of 31 folds, and the PL enhancement contributed to the improvement of both the absorption and PLQY of Cs2TeCl6 MCs after doping. In addition, compared to some recent works on emitter materials (Table 1), Cs2TeCl6:4.89%Cr3+ MCs show high PLQY, indicating the potential application value in lead-free perovskite WLEDs.

Afterwards, the luminescent dynamic processes of pristine and doped Cs2TeCl6 MCs were further measured. Fig. 2d and Fig. S5b (ESI†) show the corresponding PL decay curves measured at 590 nm excited by 380 nm light for different metal ion doping. Intriguingly, the PL lifetimes increase from 198 ns in pure Cs2TeCl6 MCs to 443 ns of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ (6.73%) MCs. On the basis of PLQY and lifetime (τ) data, the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates at different metal ion doping can be solved by the following formula:37,38 (1) (2)where τ is the PL lifetime, kr and knr are radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, respectively. The calculated kr and knr are summarized in Table 2. It can be observed that knr decreases considerably with doping, while kn significantly increases after doping, inducing highly improved PLQY in common.

Furthermore, the luminescence mechanism of Cs2TeCl6:M MCs is further investigated. As shown in Fig. 2e and Fig. S7 (ESI†), similar broad excitation bands with two distinct bands centered at 328 nm and 391 nm monitoring the emission peaks of 590 nm of all the samples are observed, which are almost the same as the corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 2a and Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating the same excited state origin. The broad excitation bands and different excitation wavelengths exclude the possible contribution from ion emission. A configurational coordinate diagram is proposed in Fig. 2f to interpret the possible luminescence process of Cs2TeCl6:M MCs. Under 380 nm light radiation, most of the electrons in the ground state (1S0) are pumped to the excited state (3Pn=2,1,0), and then undergo the thermalization process to arrive at a self-trapped excited state induced by the lattice deformation, resulting from the doping of metal ions. Finally, a bright broadband yellow emission of STE is realized. Generally, the self-trapped states with improved stability at lower energy are prone to populate the excitons. Thus, excitons tend to self-trap rather than move in the lattice. All of the above results suggest that metal ion doping can effectively improve the optical properties of the investigated Cs2TeCl6 MCs.
To further study the emission process, the temperature-dependent emission spectra of Cs2TeCl6 and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs were characterized. As recorded in Fig. 3a and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the PL profiles of MCs remain unchanged in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K, indicating no phase transition in the MCs. The PL intensity decreases due to the increased nonradiative recombination induced by the increased phonons–electrons coupling with the increasing temperature.39Fig. 3b and Fig. S9a (ESI†) show the PL line width as a function of temperature, which increases with increasing temperature from 10 K to 300 K. According to the phonon broadening model, the temperature-dependent full width at half maxima (FWHM) was evaluated by fitting the following function:40 (3)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, S and ħω stand for the electron–phonon coupling parameter and phonon frequency, respectively. For the fitting by equation, the corresponding S value can be calculated as 31.2 for Cs2TeCl6 MCs and 26.7 for Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, respectively, larger than that of most reported common semiconductor NCs. Generally, the larger the S value, the stronger the electron–phonon coupling and the larger the Stokes shift, which is consistent with Fig. 2a. In addition, the integrated PL intensity at various reciprocals of temperature is fitted by using the Arrhenius model to obtain the exciton binding energy, and the equation can be expressed as:28 (4)where I0 refers to the intensity at 0 K, Eb is the exciton binding energy, and Kb represents the Boltzmann constant. The Eb values calculated by the best fitting curve are 183.7 meV for Cs2TeCl6 MCs and 230.6 meV for Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, respectively (Fig. 3c and Fig. S9b, ESI†), which are larger than the typical exciton binding energies (15–75 meV) of 3D CsPbX3 NCs.41 Such a high exciton binding energy ensures that excitons can survive above room temperature and recombine at high speed, which is probably associated with the STE feature of perovskite, indicating the potential application value in photoelectric devices. Thus, we consider that the improvement of luminescence process efficiency with metal ion doping may be assigned to the following three reasons: (i) the partially breaking forbidden s → p transitions induced by octahedral distortion through doping, leading to radiative recombination rates as well as absorption enhancement of Cs2TeCl6:M MCs. (ii) the decrease in nonradiative recombination rates induced by the low electron–phonon coupling originating from the small S value of the doped sample. (iii) the reduction of electronic excitation energy loss induced by the decreased probability of 3P1 → 1S0 non-radiative transition owing to the increase in the Eb value.42,43Fig. 3d shows a pseudo color map of PL intensity and wavelength versus temperature in Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs. The PL intensity declined with increasing temperature from 10 to 300 K, which is consistent with the model that phonons that are coupled to excitons will exacerbate nonradiative recombination (Fig. 3b and c). The above results prove that the optical properties of Cs2TeCl6 MCs can be effectively improved after doping metal ion, and the broadband emissions of the as-prepared MCs are mainly contributed by the STEs of perovskite.

In addition, instability is still the major factor restricting the commercialization process of perovskite photoelectric devices. Thus, the stability of Cs2TeCl6 and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs was further assessed at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), Cs2TeCl6:4.89%Cr3+ MCs still have high thermal stability after 100 and 200 °C heat treatment for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the PL intensities of the heat-treated sample can preserve 94% and 87% of the original values, respectively. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were also carried out to characterize the thermodynamic properties of Cs2TeCl6:4.89%Cr3+ MCs. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), Cs2TeCl6:4.89%Cr3+ MCs can remain stable below 600 °C, which is much higher than that of the typical ABX3 halide perovskites. XRD patterns of the Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs are essentially unchanged after their exposure to ambient air for 6 months (Fig. 4a), showing excellent air stability. The PLQY values are determined to be 6.7% and 81.5% for Cs2TeCl6 and Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, which decrease to 6.2% and 78.7% after storage in air for 6 months, and decrease to 4.1%, 60.2% after storage in water for 6 months (Fig. 4b). Under continuous UV light irradiation for 3 h, the PL intensities retain 91% and 82% of the initial values for Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs stored in air and water, respectively (Fig. 4c), manifesting the striking photostability of the MCs. Such prominent stability, high PLQY, and broadband emission ensure the suitability of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs as down-conversion phosphors for constructing high-efficiency WLEDs. As a proof of concept, we fabricated several WLEDs by adjusting the mixing ratio (1:2, 2:3, 2:1) of yellow-emitting Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ phosphor with a commercial blue-emitting BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+ (PLQY ∼ 76%) phosphor in epoxy resin and curing the mixture onto a commercial 382 nm NUV-LED chip. As shown in Fig. 4d, WLEDs are related to the cold white light, white light, and warm white light. The corresponding CIE coordinate, CCT, and CRI can be tuned from (0.30, 0.32) to (0.37, 0.40), 6583 to 3474 K, and 86 to 63, respectively. A perfect white light device with the CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.35), CRI of 81.3, and CCT of 5826 K can be obtained when the mixed ratio of the blue to yellow phosphor is 3:2 (Table S7, ESI†). The luminous efficiency of the device is 19.34 l m W−1. The low luminous efficiency is mainly related to the poor luminous efficiency of the 382 nm NUV-LED chip (1.4 l m W−1). It demonstrates that Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs are promising for solid-state lighting. As shown in Fig. 4e, the as-fabricated WLED device exhibits strong electroluminescence at a drive current of 25 mA that matches well the yellow PL of Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ and the blue PL of BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+, respectively. In addition, the emission spectra of as-fabricated NUV-pumped WLEDs demonstrate excellent color stability with almost no emission shift when driven at different currents and times, attributed to the negligible energy transfer among different phosphors (Fig. 4f and Fig. S12, ESI†). Finally, compared to some recent works on WLEDs based on various metal halide materials, this work is good in the lead-free perovskite WLEDs (Table S8, ESI†). These results manifest that Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs have potential in the field of WLEDs.

3. Conclusion
We present a facile solvothermal method for the synthesis of metal ion (M = Cr3+, Mn2+, Yb3+, Eu3+, Sm3+, Cd3+, Bi3+, and Ce3+) doped Cs2TeCl6 vacancy-ordered double perovskite variant MCs. After doping, the bright broadband yellow emission stemming from STE transition was observed in Cs2TeCl6:M MCs. Their absorption and PLQY are significantly improved, and the highest PL enhancement is 31 folds in Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ with a PLQY of 81.5%, compared to the pristine Cs2TeCl6 with a PLQY of 6.7%. Various experiments, including XRD patterns with Rietveld refinement, steady- and transient-PL spectra at different temperatures, etc., evidence that: (i) The octahedral distortion induced by breaking partially forbidden s → p transitions through doping leads to radiative recombination rates as well as absorption enhancement of Cs2TeCl6:M MCs. (ii) The decrease in nonradiative recombination rates induced by the low electron–phonon coupling. (iii) The reduction of electronic excitation energy loss owing to the increase in the Eb value, contributing to the PL enhancement. Encouraged by the high PLQY and excellent stability, we fabricated WLEDs based on Cs2TeCl6:Cr3+ MCs, demonstrating a high CRI of 81.3 and a CCT of 5826 K and a luminous efficiency of 19.34 l m W−1.
