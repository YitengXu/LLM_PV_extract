    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractIn recent years, great progress has been achieved in the field of non-fullerene organic solar cells. In particular, the power conversion efficiencies for the photovoltaic devices based on A–π–A fused-ring electron acceptors, e.g. ITIC, can catch up with or even surpass the fullerene-based ones. However, the detailed molecular packing structures and charge transport properties of these acceptors are rarely studied and still unclear, which has become the major obstacle for rational molecular design to further improve the photovoltaic performance. Here, we have unravelled the intermolecular arrangements in the ITIC film via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulated results point to that three-dimensional molecular packing is formed in the ITIC film through local intermolecular π–π stacking between the terminal acceptor units. In sharp contrast, the ITIC crystal grown by the slow solvent vapor diffusion approach exhibits a one-dimensional edge-to-face stacking structure. Consequently, excellent isotropic electron mobilities along three dimensions are found for the film and unprecedentedly, the overall mobility is even higher than that of the crystal. Our work suggests that judicious modulation of the terminal acceptor unit to increase local intermolecular π–π interaction would be an effective way to improve the electron mobilities and photovoltaic performance of the A–π–A electron acceptors.
Introduction
Fullerenes and fullerene derivatives have been the predominant electron acceptors for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) in the past two decades, due to their strong electron affinity, high electron mobility, and isotropic charge transport.1 At present, fullerene-based OSCs have exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10–12%.2–8 But further improvement is limited by weak absorption of sunlight and poor tunability of energy level of fullerenes. Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), with synthetic flexibility and great potential to overcome the drawbacks of fullerenes, have been the most promising alternatives to fullerenes and fullerene derivatives.9–16 It is important to note that efficient FREAs usually have twisted backbones and/or backbones substituted by sterically hindered side chains to restrict self-aggregation and oversize phase separation in BHJ films and increase the dimensionality of charge transport pathways.15–18 However, the molecular nonplanarity is generally unfavorable for high charge-carrier mobility. The electron mobilities of the FREAs with large nonplanar structures are mostly one or more orders of magnitude lower than those of frequently-used fullerene acceptors.1,12 This leads to the fill factors (FFs) of FREA based OSCs typically lower than 60%.9–14
In the past few years, non-fullerene OSCs based on acceptor–π–acceptor (A–π–A) FREAs,10–14,19–33 especially ITIC (Fig. 1a) reported by Zhan et al.,26 have attracted considerable attention. Remarkably, the ITIC based OSCs have achieved impressive PCEs of 9–12%,34–41 comparable to the most efficient fullerene based ones.2–8 Here, interesting to us is that these ITIC based OSCs have FFs of up to 65–75%34–41 and ITIC has a fairly high electron mobility of 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.26 However, in fact, such electron mobility is sufficient only for thin films (ca. 100 nm).26,34 To obtain higher PCEs and optimal film thicknesses (300–500 nm) for practical applications, a judicious molecular design is required, but not straightforward. Thus it is of great importance to understand the relationship between molecular structure, molecular packing, and charge transport properties. However, the state-of-the-art X-ray-based techniques can only ascertain the intermolecular stacking structures of single crystals, and it still remains experimentally difficult to accurately probe the details of molecular packing in disordered films.42,43

(d) Molecular packing morphologies of the simulated ITIC and PC71BM thin films. The molecules are shown in distinct colors and the inherent hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
In this study, the single-crystal and thin-film packing structures of ITIC have been revealed for the first time by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. We find that the ITIC crystal is characteristic of one-dimensional stacking with crossed edge-to-face orientations between the backbones of two adjacent molecules. In contrast, the ITIC film shows three-dimensional molecular packing formed mainly through local π–π stacking between the terminal acceptor units, which thus results in excellent isotropic charge transport. Unprecedentedly, the thin-film electron mobility is even higher than that of the single crystal. This work suggests that finely tuning the terminal acceptor units to increase local intermolecular π–π interaction would be an effective way to improve the electron mobilities and photovoltaic performance for A–π–A FREA based OSCs.
Computational methods
Single-crystal growth and X-ray diffraction analyses
The single crystal of ITIC with desired size and quality was obtained at ambient temperature by the slow solvent vapor diffusion approach. The solid sample was dissolved in dichloromethane and transferred into a test tube. The test tube was placed in a glass container, in which petroleum ether was added in advance. Then, the glass container was sealed with a cover and stood without disturbance for 3–5 days to generate needlelike single crystals in the test tube.
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data of ITIC were collected at the BL17B beam line of the SSRF (Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility). Data reduction and analysis were performed using the HKL-3000 package.44 The structure was solved with direct methods using the SHELXTL-2014 program45 and refined with full-matrix least-squares on F2.
MD simulations
All atomistic MD simulations were performed using the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.46 The atom types (Fig. S1a, ESI†) and intra- and inter-molecular interaction parameters of ITIC and PC71BM were built from the general AMBER force field (GAFF) with the RESP charges.47,48 The torsion potential between the central backbone and the terminal acceptor group (IC) was reparametrized according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. S1b, ESI†).49,50 Girifalco's parameters were employed to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions for fullerene carbons.51 A spherical cut-off of 1.2 nm for the summation of vdW interactions and short-range Coulomb interactions and the particle-mesh Ewald solver for long-range Coulomb interactions were used throughout. The simulations were carried out with 3D periodic boundary conditions using the leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1.0 fs. The ITIC crystal based on a 5 × 5 × 4 supercell was equilibrated at 300 K for 5 ns under the NVT ensemble and the Nosé–Hoover thermostat was used to control the temperature.52,53
The ITIC and PC71BM thin films were built and imitated using the following procedure: (1) Randomly placing 400 molecules in a large box (30 × 30 × 30 nm3 for ITIC and 25 × 25 × 25 nm3 for PC71BM) to generate an initial geometry (seeding); (2) 5 ns of simulation at 600 K and 100 bar to make molecules close together quickly (compression); (3) 10 ns of simulation at 600 K and 1 bar, then cooling down to 300 K in 3 ns (thermal annealing); (4) 20 ns of equilibration at 300 K and 1 bar (equilibration) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The velocity rescaling thermostat54 and the Berendsen barostat55 under the NPT ensemble were applied to control the temperature and pressure, respectively. But for the final 10 ns of equilibration, the Nosé–Hoover thermostat52,53 and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat56 were used to obtain better equilibrium conformations.
Electronic-structure calculations
To identify the electron connectivity and charge percolation ability of ITIC and PC71BM, we defined an effective intermolecular connection when the LUMO energy difference is smaller than 0.3 eV and the electronic coupling (absolute of transfer integral) is larger than a given threshold value, following a recent work by Ratner and coworkers.57 The electronic couplings for molecular pairs (the shortest interatomic distance between backbones is less than 0.5 nm) were computed using the Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO) method,58 which has proved to be an efficient and relatively accurate approach and is suitable to deal with calculations on thousands or even tens of thousands of molecular pairs.59 The last 500 ps of equilibration was sampled every 5 ps to generate 100 snapshots to consider the thermal fluctuation effect.
Mobility calculations
We employed the hopping model to calculate the electron mobility.60 Since the electronic couplings are not strong for the studied systems, the charge-hopping rates between adjacent molecules can be evaluated using the semi-classical Marcus theory:61 (1)where ℏ denotes the reduced Planck's constant, Vij is the transfer integral calculated using the ZINDO method as mentioned above, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and is set to 300 K, λ is the reorganization energy and is estimated to be 0.153 eV for ITIC and 0.194 eV for PC71BM using DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, ΔGij is the free energy and is estimated to be the LUMO energy difference as the limit of the zero field.
In the low field limit, the carrier mobility can be expressed using the Einstein relation: (2)where e is the elementary charge of an electron and D is the charge diffusion coefficient. Once the charge-transfer rates were computed, at least 5000 kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations were performed to evaluate the diffusion coefficient for each snapshot.60,61 Since the dynamic disorder of on-site energies and electronic couplings could influence the charge transport behaviours in organic materials,62–64 here the electron mobilities were averaged over 100 snapshots to consider the effects of dynamic disorder.65,66
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of the ITIC single crystal obtained using the slow solvent vapor diffusion approach is illustrated in Fig. 1c and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The torsion angle between the central backbone and the terminal acceptor IC group (labeled as cd-cc-ce-cd in Fig. S1, ESI†) is about 171°, corresponding to a “trans” conformation. Because of thermally dynamic motions, a broadened distribution is found from 140° to 180° with the maximum probability at ca. 165°, close to that in the perfect crystal (Fig. S4a, ESI†). It is seen that two nonequivalent molecules (labeled A and B) alternate along the b crystallographic axis with the backbone edge of A embedded between two of the pendant phenyl groups of B (this molecular pair is defined as PAB). The calculated binding energy for PAB is about −45 kcal mol−1, which is much stronger than those along other directions (Fig. S5, ESI†). As a consequence, the grown bulk single crystals in the test tube present a needle-like shape.
We note that compared with the vapor diffusion process (3–5 days) to produce ITIC single crystals, the timescale (∼10 minutes) and processing conditions (spin-coating and thermal annealing) for the preparation of ITIC thin films cannot allow for crystallization. Here, we employed atomistic MD simulations based on the ITIC “trans” conformation to reproduce the preparation of thin films considering thermal annealing. The simulated thin-film packing morphology of ITIC is displayed in Fig. 1d. It is found that the distribution probability of the molecular torsion angle is monotonically decreased from the maximum at 180° to nearly zero at 140° in the thin film (Fig. S4a, ESI†). It should be pointed out that the obtained molecular twists have a very small influence on electronic conjugation. As seen in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the LUMO of ITIC with the torsion angle of 140° is still delocalized over the whole molecular backbone. Obviously, the film takes on a completely disordered molecular packing structure. To characterize the packing details in the disordered film, the ITIC molecule is divided into three main fragments, i.e., the fused-ring π backbone and two acceptor units. Fig. 2a shows the center-of-mass (COM) radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the central backbone and IC. We recall that in a system of particles, the RDF describes how the particle density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle. Here, the COMs of molecular fragments are regarded as particles.

(b) The molecules involved in the local intermolecular π–π stacking between the IC groups in the ITIC film (red). 
The backbone COM RDF for the film does not exhibit any distinct peaks, especially around 0.77 nm that corresponds to the backbone–backbone COM distance for PAB in the crystal, confirming an amorphous arrangement for the ITIC film. Indeed, very few molecular pairs similar to PAB can be found in the disordered film (Fig. S6, ESI†). Moreover, the RDF has almost no distribution when the radius <0.5 nm, indicating that the fused-ring backbones are difficult to form π–π stacking. This can be attributed to the large steric hindrance of the four alkyl phenyl groups pended on the backbone. Interestingly, the COM RDF of the terminal IC groups shows a distinct peak at ∼0.37 nm, demonstrating local π–π stacking between the terminal groups. This is very consistent with the experimental measurement using grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD).24,39 Actually, the IC group is of planar structure and exposed, which is favorable for intermolecular π–π interaction.
To gain a deep insight into the intermolecular arrangements, we extracted all the IC–IC π–π stacks from the simulated film. Considering the thermally dynamic motions and a certain slip between IC groups, the molecular pair with a IC–IC COM distance <0.55 nm (PIC–IC) can be regarded as an IC–IC π–π stack. In such a way, 266 π–π stacks are obtained from the simulated film that contains 400 molecules, and ∼80% molecules are involved (Fig. 2b). Hence, the π–π stacking between IC groups would play a dominant role in the construction of the charge transport pathways in the film. To further determine the intermolecular relative orientations around the IC groups, the probabilities of PIC–IC as a function of backbone–backbone COM distances were estimated (Fig. 3a). Apparently, the distribution of the backbone–backbone COM distances is very broad, in the range of 0.75–2.25 nm. So PIC–IC has different intermolecular relative orientations, like a divider with different angles. This facilitates the formation of three-dimensional molecular packing and the achievement of isotropic charge transport. Importantly, these IC–IC π–π stacks can further form large connected networks with two main modes. One is cluster-like and the other is chain-like (Fig. 3b). It can be expected that the chain-like mode would bring longer distance charge transport. In addition, even without the contribution of side chains, the calculated average binding energy for PIC–IC is about −24 kcal mol−1 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The relatively strong interactions are helpful to form stable intermolecular percolation networks.

Charge transport in organic semiconducting films is determined by the mesoscopic conductive networks that depend on the number of nearest neighbors and the strength of intermolecular electronic couplings.57Fig. 4a shows the electronic connectivity, which is defined as the average number of neighbors for each molecule with electronic coupling larger than the given threshold coupling (VT). Generally, a continuous and robust network can be formed only when each molecule has ≥2 connected neighbors. For the perfect crystal, the electronic coupling for PAB is about 13.5 meV, while the couplings for the other types of pairs are <1.0 meV, indicating one-dimensional charge transport along the b crystallographic axis. Considering the thermally dynamic motions, the one-dimensional transport ability would be weakened. Interestingly, when the electronic connectivity is about 2, the threshold couplings are almost the same for both the crystal and the film, close to a moderate value of 5 meV. To better understand the capability of charge transport across the bulk volume, the proportions of molecules in the largest network were evaluated as a function of VT (Fig. 4b). When VT = 5 meV, most of the molecules (∼75%) can still be connected together in the ITIC film. In stark contrast, only the molecules along the b axis (<10%) can be inter-connected electronically in the crystal. This demonstrates a robust three-dimensional charge transport percolation network in the film. Here, it should be emphasized that ∼75% of IC–IC π–π stacks have electronic couplings of >5 meV and cover ∼70% of molecules, confirming that the terminal π–π stacking interactions play the dominant role in determining the charge transport for the ITIC thin film.

Fig. 5 shows the electron mobilities estimated by employing the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in combination with the semi-classical Marcus electron-transfer theory.60–62 As expected, the mobility of the ITIC crystal exhibits large anisotropy and the predominant direction is along the b crystallographic axis. The overall mobility is about 7.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. By contrast, the ITIC film has similar mobilities of 4–6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in three dimensions, which compare well with the experimental measurements.26 Hence, the overall mobility of the film (∼1.46 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is surprisingly almost twice that of the crystal. This is different from the common view that the single crystal has charge mobility higher than that of the thin film for organic semiconductors. In order to understand this phenomenon, it is useful to analyze the electronic couplings of PAB and PIC–IC that are respectively the dominant packing modes in the crystal and thin film. The couplings are distributed mainly around 10 meV for PAB, but the distribution of couplings is much wider for PIC–IC, even in the range of 20–80 meV (Fig. S7, ESI†). The average coupling of PIC–IC (18.4 meV) is thus larger than that of PAB (10.8 meV). Also, the backbone–backbone COM distances of PIC–IC are generally larger than those of PAB (Fig. S5, ESI†), which provides a longer hopping distance of charge transfer. As a result, the film has higher mobility.

To compare with fullerene-based acceptors, we also investigated the thin-film molecular packing and charge transport of PC71BM, a highly efficient fullerene derivative. As expected, PC71BM exhibits three-dimensional stacking (Fig. 1d) and the estimated COM distance between fullerenes is around 1.05 nm (Fig. 2a). As seen in Fig. 4, all the molecules are still connected together even when VT = 10 meV. The PC71BM film is then characteristic of excellent isotropic charge transport and shows high electron mobility of about 6.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 5). Indeed, with respect to PC71BM, the charge transport performance of non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC, has much room for further improvement.
Finally, it is useful to discuss the possible molecular design strategies to improve the charge transport performance based on ITIC. The above results for the ITIC film have demonstrated that the local π–π stacking between the terminal IC moieties provides the main charge transfer channels. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that such intermolecular arrangements do not include all the molecules and are not very compact either (the corresponding RDF peak is somewhat broad and not very strong). In addition, the electron density of the LUMO is relatively weak on the phenyl moiety of the IC group (Fig. S4b, ESI†). This will reduce the electronic couplings for the terminal π–π stacking dimers. Therefore, to improve the electron mobilities of ITIC, it is imperative to finely tune the terminal acceptor unit to increase the local intermolecular π–π interaction and the LUMO distribution on the acceptor unit.
Conclusions
In summary, we have experimentally and theoretically investigated the single-crystal and thin-film packing morphologies of ITIC. While the ITIC crystal displays one-dimensional edge-to-face molecular packing, the ITIC film shows three-dimensional molecular packing through local π–π stacking interaction between the terminal IC groups. Thus, the electron transport is isotropic in the ITIC film. Moreover, the thin-film electron mobility is even superior to that of the crystal. This work suggests that appropriate modulation of the terminal acceptor group would be an effective way to improve the charge transport percolation network and electron mobilities in the films of A–π–A structured FREAs.
