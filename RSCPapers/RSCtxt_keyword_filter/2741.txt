    , Accepted 5th November 2014First published on 5th November 2014AbstractWe report a microwave-assisted chemical reduction method with NaBH4 to prepare bulk abundant Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays (MR-TNTs). UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra show that the light absorption spectrum range of MR-TNTs extends from the UV to visible light region and the electrochemical impedance spectra indicate that the induced oxygen vacancies of MR-TNTs enhance their electrical conductivity as well as charge transfer. The MR-TNTs show an 8-fold increase in visible light photocurrent density compared to the pristine TNTs, and the optimized saturation photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency under AM1.5 irradiation are identified to be 3.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 1.66% respectively, which are the highest values ever reported for doped TNT photoelectrodes. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum increases both in UV and visible light regions. Moreover, the MR-TNTs exhibit much more stable PEC performance than the NaBH4 treated TNTs without microwave assistance, which is attributed to the self-doped Ti3+ mainly existing in the bulk rather than on the surface.
Introduction
Solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by using semiconductor photocatalysts is one of the most promising approaches for clean hydrogen production.1 Among all semiconductors, TiO2 has been extensively studied as a photoelectrode in the PEC system due to its appropriate band edge position, high chemical and thermal stability, and low cost.2 However, the water splitting efficiency of TiO2 based photoanodes is still unsatisfactory due to their limited light absorption spectrum range and fast photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination.3 To address these limitations, doping pristine TiO2 with various impurity species (such as N, P, and F) by treating samples in a suitable atmosphere or solutions has been demonstrated to be a feasible strategy to improve its PEC activity.4–6 Unfortunately, the doped impurity species in TiO2 often lead to severe thermal instability and a relatively fast carrier recombination rate since the foreign introduced atoms can serve as carrier recombination centers, which undoubtedly impair the overall water splitting photoconversion efficiency of TiO2 photoelectrodes.7,8 Recently, the Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 has attracted much interest because it not only enhances visible light absorption because of the interband level of the Ti3+ (oxygen vacancy) but also increases electrical conductivity owing to its high donor density, thus leading to significantly enhanced PEC water splitting performance under UV, visible light, and/or whole solar spectrum compared with pure samples.9,10
The previously reported methods to prepare self-doped TiO2 mainly focused on high-temperature heating in reducing gas (such as H2,9,10 CO (ref. 11)) or melted aluminium,12 hydrothermal synthesis,13–15 flame16 or plasma treatments,17,18 and high energy bombardment (such as e-beam19). Although these methods have their own merits, they are severely limited by high cost and complicated procedures and not suitable for practical applications. Moreover, for the promising one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures (such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanobelts), the above harsh treatments are not appropriate since their one-dimensional morphologies and structures are easily destroyed. Thus, a facile, mild, and scalable method to produce stable self-doped TiO2 photocatalysts is still much needed.
Very recently, Ye et al.20 reported a facile one-step chemical method to synthesize partially reduced TiO2 nanotube arrays. The mild chemical reduction with NaBH4 at room temperature and under pressure introduces oxygen vacancies on the surface and interior of TiO2, thus significantly enhancing the PEC water splitting performance of TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrodes. However, the Ti3+ doping concentration is still very low, thus only creating localized oxygen vacancy states that usually deteriorate the electron mobility and exhibit negligible visible light photoactivity. In addition, since most of the self-doped Ti3+ ions exist on the surface rather than in the bulk of TiO2, leading to moderate PEC enhancement and instability, the surface Ti3+ is easily oxidized by air or dissolved oxygen in water. Therefore, it is highly necessary to increase both the overall and bulk Ti3+ doping concentration of TiO2 based on the NaBH4 chemical reduction.
Herein, we develop a microwave-assisted chemical reduction method with NaBH4 to prepare bulk abundant Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays (MR-TNTs). The highly ordered one-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs) are rationally selected as pristine TiO2 candidates because of their excellent PEC water splitting performance as well as their simple preparation.21 The formation process of Ti3+ in the bulk is quickly achieved with microwave assistance owing to its fast and well-controlled heating rate, homogeneous heat distribution, and energy efficiency.22,23 As a result, the MR-TNTs exhibit much higher PEC water splitting performance than the pristine TNTs and the NaBH4 treated TNTs without microwave assistance (R-TNTs).
Experimental
Preparation of self-doped MR-TNTs
Highly ordered MR-TNTs were firstly prepared by a two-step anodization method24,25 and then reduced by NaBH4 aqueous solution with microwave assistance (Scheme 1).

Briefly, a two-electrode electrochemical cell, with a working electrode of Ti foil and a counter electrode of Pt foil, was used for the preparation of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs). The titanium foils (purity 99.6%, thickness 1.0 mm) were firstly anodized in ethylene glycol (EG) electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% deionized water under 60 V for 2 h. Then the as-prepared TiO2 layer was peeled off by ultrasonication in deionized water. Subsequently, the well-patterned titanium foils were subjected to a second anodization in the same electrolyte at 60 V for 1 h. Finally, the as-anodized TNTs were annealed in air at 450 °C for 2 h. Finally, the annealed samples were dipped in 0.5 M NaBH4 aqueous solution and heated with a microwave synthesizer for 10 min. The pristine TNTs and TNTs treated with NaBH4 without microwave assistance (R-TNTs) were used as references.
Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (NOVA NANOSEM 430, Holland) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation and operating at 40 kV/40 mA. The Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM Aramis (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France) instrument, which was performed with the incidence power of 10.4 mW and the excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The UV-vis light absorption spectra were obtained using a Hitachi UV-3010 spectrophotometer (Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly and using BaSO4 as a reference to measure all the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, UK) was used to detect the surface chemical composition of the as-prepared samples. The spectral positions were corrected by normalizing the C 1s spectrum at 284.6 eV, and a Shirley background was used for peak fitting. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) of the samples was recorded on a JES-FA200 electron spin resonance spectrometer to confirm the bulk Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy.
Photoelectrochemical activity measurement
PEC measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a standard three-electrode cell of the obtained sample, platinum foil and Ag/AgCl as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential and photocurrent of the photoelectrode were controlled by a potentiostat and were reported against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + EoAg/AgCl with EoAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C(1)
The samples were illuminated by simulated solar light (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) or visible light (λ > 400 nm, 100 mW cm−2) provided by a PLS-SXE300UV Xe lamp (Changtuo, China). The intensity of the light source was measured using a radiant power meter (Instruments of Beijing Normal University) and the visible light was obtained using a UV-400 optical filter. The photocurrent response under 1.23 V vs. RHE was recorded with an Agilent digital multimeter. The scan rate for the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was 5 mV s−1. The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed without external bias in a two-electrode model, with prepared samples as anodes, and Pt as the cathode. The electrochemical spectra (EIS) were performed under illumination (100 mW cm−2) at open circuit voltage over a frequency range of 105 to 0.1 Hz with an AC voltage at 10 mV. Simultaneously, the Mott–Schottky plots were obtained at a fixed frequency of 5 kHZ to determine the flat band potential and carrier density. All experiments were carried out under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the pristine TNTs and MR-TNTs are shown in Fig. 1. The bare TNTs have a well-ordered and uniformly arranged tubular structure with an average internal pore diameter of 125 nm and a length of about 14 μm (Fig. 1a and b). Fig. 1c and d show that even after the NaBH4 treatment with microwave assistance the TNTs maintain their top high-density porous morphology (tube diameter, wall thickness) and cross-sectional tubular structure (tube length, dimension), which indicates that the mild reduction process has not changed the nanostructure of TNTs. The top-porous and bottom-tubular nanostructure is beneficial for broadband light confinement and unidirectional electron transport.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to the crystal phase of the pure TNTs and MR-TNTs. As clearly shown in Fig. 2, XRD diffraction peaks located at 25.3°, 37.8°, 47.9°, and 54.0° suggest that the annealed TNTs are highly crystallized with pure anatase phase.26,27 After the microwave-assisted chemical reduction, the MR-TNTs also exhibit strong anatase diffraction, but a close observation of the XRD pattern in the range of 20 to 30° reveals a broad peak centered at 20.8° and a sharp peak located at 27.2° (inset of Fig. 2). These peaks can be identified as being due to the reduced TiO2 species (such as Ti4O7), indicating that the TNTs actually have reacted with the NaBH4 molecule and formed corresponding products.28

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful tool to investigate the change of surface chemical bonding. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peak of O 1s XPS spectra exhibits a slight shift to lower energy (from 529.8 to 529.2 eV) after the chemical reduction, which may be the result of electron transfer from the conduction band to oxygen vacancy state.29 The Ti 2p XPS spectra are almost identical for the pure TNTs with Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks located at binding energies of 458.6 and 464.3 eV, which are typical for the Ti4+–O bonds in TiO2 (Fig. 3b).24 Clearly, no Ti3+ species are detected by XPS since the surface Ti3+ can be easily oxidized back to Ti4+ by oxygen in water or air and the XPS technique only probes the surface composition (1–10 nm) of a material.30,31 Thus we conduct the low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to further confirm the presence of bulk Ti3+. As shown in Fig. 3c, the reduced samples (R-TNTs and MR-TNTs) give rise to an obvious EPR signal, while no signal is seen for the pure TNTs. For the R-TNTs, the EPR signal with a g value of 2.020 corresponding to O2− induced from the reduction of absorbed O2 by surface Ti3+ is observed, which suggests that the NaBH4 chemical treatment without microwave assistance only generates Ti3+ on the surface of TNTs.32 The presence of the strong EPR signal at g = 1.958 for the MR-TNTs indicates abundant Ti3+ spins in the bulk of the material.11 Moreover, the EPR signal with a g value of 2.020 for the MR-TNTs is much weaker than that of R-TNTs, which confirms that most of the Ti3+ ions exist in the bulk rather than on the surface and bulk Ti3+ is much more stable than the surface Ti3+. All the above results sufficiently indicate that microwave irradiation plays a vital role in forming abundant bulk Ti3+ during the chemical reduction process.

Transient photocurrent response measurements were performed over the pristine TNTs, R-TNTs, and MR-TNTs during repeated on/off visible light irradiation cycles at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4a). Clearly, all the samples show a fast and reproducible photocurrent response upon each cycle illumination. The transient photocurrent of the MR-TNTs is 0.242 mA cm−2, which represents an 8-fold increase from the pristine TNTs (0.030 mA cm−2). Simultaneously, the MR-TNTs show a higher photocurrent density than that of R-TNTs (0.134 mA cm−2). Moreover, the photocurrent response of the prepared samples under the simulated solar illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) shows the same trend as that observed for MR-TNTs which exhibit a much higher photocurrent value than the pristine TNTs and R-TNTs (Fig. S2†). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the prepared samples was recorded under simulated solar light illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. Upon illumination, the photocurrent density gradually increases with increasing applied potential from 0.1 to 0.9 V vs. RHE, suggesting photogenerated electron–hole pair separation resulting from the electric field.33 At higher potentials (E > 0.9 V), a saturation of the photocurrent is observed for all samples. In comparison with the pristine TNTs, the MR-TNTs exhibit about two times enhanced saturated photocurrent (3.05 mA cm−2), which is the highest photocurrent density ever reported for doped TNT photoelectrodes under the same conditions. In addition, the onset potentials of R-TNTs and MR-TNTs shift negatively compared to that of the pure TNTs, which may be due to the materials possessing the merits of lower band bending requirement for separating photogenerated electron–hole pairs and better charge transport.34 The applied bias photoconversion efficiency of the prepared samples is calculated via the following equation:35 (2)where ε0 is the photoconversion efficiency, jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), I0 means the intensity of the incident light, E0rev represents the standard reversible potential (1.23 V vs. RHE), and |Eapp| denotes the absolute value of the applied voltage which is obtained from Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) at which jp is measured and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) at open circuit under illumination. Plots of photoconversion efficiency with applied potential are shown in Fig. 4c. The maximum photoconversion efficiency of the TNTs is calculated to be 0.78% at 0.82 V vs. RHE. Notably, the MR-TNTs achieve the highest efficiency of 1.66% at 0.78 V vs. RHE. Likewise, the R-TNTs exhibit the optimal efficiency of 0.85% at a similar applied bias. Based on the above results and discussion, we can conclude that the microwave-assisted NaBH4 treatment significantly enhances photoconversion efficiency by improving the maximum photocurrent and shifts potential negatively.

To estimate the photoactivity of the prepared electrodes as a function of wavelength of incident light, the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed with a two electrode system in the absence of external bias over the pristine TNTs, R-TNTs, and MR-TNTs. The IPCE values can be calculated by the following equation:36 IPCE = (1240I)/λJlight(3)
where I, λ, and Jlight are the photocurrent density, incident light wavelength, and measured irradiance, respectively. Fig. 4d shows that both the reduced samples (MR-TNTs and TNTs) exhibit significant photoactivity in the UV region. Particularly, the MR-TNTs have the highest IPCE value of 92.8% at 350 nm, which is about 2.5 times higher than that of the pristine TNTs. It suggests that the UV light is effectively utilized for PEC water splitting. Significantly, the MR-TNTs and R-TNTs all show significant photoactivity improvement within the visible light region (400–550 nm) compared to the pristine TNTs (inset of Fig. 4d), which can be attributed to the narrowed band gap induced by the Ti3+ (or oxygen vacancy) interband level between the valence band and conduction band of reduced TNTs. Moreover, the MR-TNTs show higher IPCE values over the entire light spectrum which may be due to the abundant bulk Ti3+ species being much more stable than the surface Ti3+ for efficiently facilitating the charge separation. The stability of the MR-TNTs and R-TNTs was investigated with amperometric I–t measurements under simulated solar light illumination with 60 s light on–off cycles. The photocurrent density of R-TNTs shows obvious decay at the end of the measurement, while that of MR-TNTs still maintains a stable state all the time (Fig. S1†). The high stability of MR-TNTs can be mainly attributed to two reasons. The first reason is that the majority of Ti3+ species are significantly retained in the bulk of R-TNTs, which is reported to be more stable than those located on and near the surface. The second one is that the Ti3+ interband level is located just below the conduction band minimum of TiO2 and thus cannot be oxidized by the valence band holes.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were employed to investigate the charge separation and transport of the prepared samples. The EIS measurements were performed covering the frequency range of 105–0.1 Hz using an amplitude of 10 mV at the open circuit potential of the system. Fig. 5a presents typical Nyquist plots for the TNTs, R-TNTs, and MR-TNTs under illumination. It is clearly observed that the radii of the arc on the EIS Nyquist plots of MR-TNTs and R-TNTs are both lower than that of TNTs. This indicates that the reduced samples possess smaller charge transfer resistance and better photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and mobility which may be ascribed to the presence of Ti3+ species on the surface or in the bulk of materials. Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were collected at 5 kHz in the dark to determine the semiconductor type, flat band potential (EFB) and carrier density (ND) of the obtained samples following the below equation:37,38 (4)where C is the space charge capacitance of the semiconductor, ND is the electron carriers density, e is the elemental charge, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, ε is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, E is the applied potential, EFB is the flat band potential, T is the temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 5b displays the Mott–Schottky plots of 1/C2 as a function of the applied potential, from which the positive slopes of the linear parts of the curves are observed, suggesting n-type semiconductors. Furthermore, the plots are extrapolated to 1/C2 = 0 to estimate the values of EFB for the TNTs, R-TNTs, and MR-TNTs which are 0.28, 0.42, and 0.51 V, respectively. It is worth noting that the positive shift of EFB in reduced TNTs implies a decrease in bending of the band edge, thus facilitating the photogenerated electron separation and transfer, which is in accordance with many previous reports.21,39,40 While in the previous literature,20 the EFB of the NaBH4 reduced sample shows a negative shift, which may be attributed to the slightly different experimental test conditions, that is, the Mott–Schottky plots of the previous report could be collected under light illumination while the present study is performed under dark conditions. With the light participation, more charges accumulate at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte, which may ease the band bending to a certain degree and cause the negative shift of EFB. The carrier density ND was calculated from Fig. 5b using the following equation:24 (5)as e = 1.6 × 10−19 C, ε0 = 8.86 × 10−12 F m−1, and ε = 48 for anatase TiO2,41 the ND values of TNTs, R-TNTs, and MR-TNTs are determined to be 2.16 × 1018, 3.31 × 1018, 5.59 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. This indicates that the donor density of reduced TNTs is significantly increased because of the existence of Ti3+ that serves as electron donors and the Ti3+ concentration of MR-TNTs is higher than that of R-TNTs. In a word, the electrical properties confirm that the bulk abundant Ti3+ self-doped MR-TNTs have better electrical conductivity than the TNTs and R-TNTs, which facilitates the charge separation and transfer and leads to PEC water splitting enhancement.

Fig. 6a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the pristine TNTs, R-TNTs and MR-TNTs. The strong UV absorption of all samples is ascribed to the electronic transition from the valence band to the conduction band. The MR-TNTs and R-TNTs exhibit higher light absorbance than the pure TNTs in the visible light region and show a red shift in the absorption edges, which can be attributed to the electronic transition from the valence band to the Ti3+ induced interband or from this band level to the conduction band in the MR-TNTs. The band gap energies of pristine TNTs, R-TNTs and MR-TNTs estimated with the Kubelka–Munk function are about 3.10, 2.88 and 2.39 eV, respectively (Fig. 6a, inset). This band-gap narrowing for the MR-TNTs and R-TNTs is consistent with the assumption that an electronic band level is located just below the conduction band of reduced samples. Simultaneously, the bandgap of MR-TNTs is smaller than that of R-TNTs, which can be ascribed to the fact that the self-doped Ti3+ ions of MR-TNTs are mainly distributed in the bulk phase while those of R-TNTs are centered in the surface region. This result definitely demonstrates that the microwave assistance is an effective auxiliary means to prepare efficient self-doped photocatalysts. In addition, the bandgap of the present R-TNTs is larger than that of its counterpart in the previous report20 under similar NaBH4 reduction conditions, which can be attributed to the different NaBH4 concentration, that is, the current NaBH4 concentration (0.5 M) is much higher than that of the previous study (0.1 M). A high concentration of NaBH4 means high reduction ability and results in more reduced Ti3+ doped into the sample. The density of states (DOS) of the valence band (VB) of TNTs and MR-TNTs were also measured by the valence band (VB) (Fig. 6b). The pure TNTs show the characteristic VB DOS of TiO2, with the band edge of about 2.05 eV below the Fermi energy. Since the optical band gap of the pristine TNTs is 3.10 (Fig. 6a, inset), the conduction band (CB) minimum would occur at −1.05 eV. On the other hand, the VB maximum of the MR-TNTs shows a shift to 1.75 eV and is followed by a tail toward about 1.32 eV. Considering that the optical band gap of the MR-TNTs is 2.39 eV, its CB minimum would occur at −0.46 eV. A schematic illustration of the DOS of TNTs and MR-TNTs is vividly shown in Fig. 6c. The microwave-assisted chemical reduction introduces abundant oxygen vacancies into the bulk of MR-TNTs, which induces a narrowed band gap and a slight VB tailing. In addition, self-doped Ti3+ species introduce localized states below the CB minimum of MR-TNTs. Both the VB tailing and Ti3+ localized states of MR-TNTs are responsible for their significant visible light absorption.

Conclusions
All in all, our study demonstrates that the microwave-assisted NaBH4 treatment is an effective and mild strategy to introduce abundant Ti3+ species into the bulk of TNTs and the MR-TNT photoelectrodes show excellent and stable PEC water splitting performance as a result of efficient visible light absorption and fast charge separation. The optimized saturation photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency of the MR-TNTs under simulated solar illumination are measured to be 3.05 mA cm−2 and 1.66%, respectively, which are the highest values ever reported for doped TNT photoelectrodes. The present work sheds light on the application of the mild chemical reduction strategy for performance improvement of metal oxide based semiconductors in the fields of dye-sensitized solar cells, PEC water splitting devices and supercapacitors.
