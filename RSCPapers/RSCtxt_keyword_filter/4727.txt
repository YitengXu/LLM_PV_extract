    , Accepted 9th June 2015First published on 11th June 2015AbstractThe ingenious design of nanostructures and smart integration of specific semiconducting metal oxide materials are closely related to the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. Herein, we successfully fabricate vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire–TiO2 nanosheet–ZnO nanorod (TNW–TNS–ZNR) hyperbranched heterostructured arrays on TCO substrates as excellent anode material electrodes for efficient solar-to-electricity conversion. As a result, the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array based quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have exhibited an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) under AM 1.5G one sun illumination, along with considerable improvement of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) due to their superior light harvesting and excellent charge collection capability. Combined with the chemical bath deposited Cu2S counter electrode, the eventual PCE of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells can be further boosted to as high as 5.38%.
Introduction
Recently, nanomaterial based solar cells have attracted a great deal of scientific and technical interest.1 Among all the photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with the advantages of low cost and environmental benignity, have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for efficient solar energy conversion.2–4 To further improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, many efforts have been made, for instance, developing new sensitizers like porphyrin dyes5,6 or narrow band gap quantum dot semiconductors.7,8 Specifically, semiconductor quantum dots such as CdS,9,10 CdSe,11,12 CdTe,13,14 PbS,15,16 PbSe,17 and Sb2S318 have been widely investigated due to their excellent optical and electronic properties, namely, tunable band gap depending on the QD size, high extinction coefficient and generation of multiple exitons,7,19 which could lead to 44% theoretical photovoltaic conversion in QDSSCs.7 Moreover, by properly utilizing the co-sensitization concept, the advantages of widened absorption spectra, enhanced absorption and improved charge-separation efficiency can be obtained, which do help to enhance the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.19
To achieve higher photovoltaic performance of solar cells, morphologies and structures of anode materials are also widely investigated.20–22 In general, mesoporous nanoparticles are the most frequently used photoanodes in DSSCs or QDSSCs due to their high internal surface area for sufficient sensitizer anchoring.23–25 Unfortunately, nanoparticles have several disadvantages such as inferior light scattering, charge transport rate and charge collection efficiency due to the enormous defects, surface states and grain boundaries existing in the random electrical pathway of nanoparticles, which lead to many unexpected trapping and detrapping events.22,26 This would hinder the further improvement of photovoltaic performance. To overcome the drawbacks of nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanowires27,28 and nanotubes29 have been introduced as photoanodes into solar cells. Such 1D nanostructures have outstanding features of providing direct pathways for fast charge transport and also suppressing charge recombination in an efficient manner.30 However, the low internal surface area and poor light harvesting efficiency of such 1D nanowires or nanotubes also limit their application in solar cells. As such, three-dimensional (3D) hyperbranched nanostructures have been introduced into QDDSCs and DSSCs.21,31 Some successful examples of 3D nanostructures with homogeneous or heterogeneous composition, such as TiO2–TiO2,32,33 ZnO–ZnO,34,35 TiO2–ZnO,36 SnO2–TiO2,37 and ZnO–Zn2SnO4,38 have been demonstrated with an impressive PCE for DSSCs or QDSSCs. As compared to TiO2, ZnO is a good alternative with a similar band gap (∼3.2 eV) and physical properties. On top of that, it is worth noting that ZnO has faster electron mobility than TiO2 (205–1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ZnO vs. 0.1–4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TiO2).39 Therefore, it is highly desirable to fabricate 3D hyperbranched TiO2/ZnO heterostructured array electrodes with synergistic and complementary advantages for high-performance QDSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been reported on the hyperbranched construction of vertically aligned TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array based QDSSCs.
In this study, we successfully synthesize a novel vertically aligned TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array which consists of vertical TiO2 nanowire (TNW) trunks on FTO glass coated with TiO2 nanosheet (TNS) and ZnO nanorod branches via a step-by-step hydrothermal route. The QDSSCs based on TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays exhibit an excellent photovoltaic performance of 4.25%, which is higher than that of TNW–TNS array (3.75%) and TNW array (2.85%) counterparts. Such superior enhancement in PCE can be attributed to the higher light harvesting efficiency and efficient charge collection efficiency of the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays. Additionally, through the utilization of the Cu2S counter electrode, an optimized photovoltaic performance of up to 5.38% has been achieved. We expect that a much more efficient QDSSC can be obtained if our designed 3D hyperbranched heterostructured TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays can be combined with other types of QDs (ZnTe/CdSe,40 CdTe/CdSe,41,42 CdSeTe,43etc.).
Experimental section
Synthesis of vertically aligned TNW arrays
First, a TiO2 colloid solution27 was spin-coated on cleaned fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (2.5 cm × 3 cm), which were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and water for 10 min, respectively. Then, they were heated at 500 °C in ambient air for 30 min to form a TiO2 compact layer on FTO glass. After that, a facile solution method was used to fabricate vertically aligned TNW arrays.27 Briefly, 0.4 g K2TiO(C2O4)2 was added to the mixture solvent containing 5 mL water and 15 mL diethylene glycol (DEG). After stirring for 30 min, the mixture solution was transferred to a Teflon-liner autoclave. Then, the TiO2 compact layer-coated FTO glass substrate was immersed into the solution against the wall with its conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 6 h. Afterwards, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The as-synthesized vertically aligned TiO2 arrays were taken out and rinsed extensively with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at room temperature, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h to improve the crystallinity and remove the residual organics.
Synthesis of TNW–TNS arrays
The vertically aligned TNW–TNS arrays were fabricated by a second acid-thermal method which was optimized according to our previous report.21 Briefly, 0.8 mL titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) was added into 30 mL acetic acid (HAc) drop by drop and stirred for 30 min. Then, the as-synthesized TNW array sample was immersed into the above solution and heated to 150 °C for 9 h. After the acid-thermal reaction, the TNW–TNS array sample was taken out and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h.
Synthesis of hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays
To obtain the hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays, the above TNW–TNS array film was immersed in the ZnO sol38 at room temperature for 30 min and then heated to 300 °C for 30 min in order to coat the array surface with a ZnO seed layer. After that, the ZnO-seeded TNW–TNS arrays were immersed into the solution containing 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2, 0.1 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), and 20 mL deionized water, followed by heating at 90 °C for 3 h, which leads to the formation of the hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays.
Electrodeposition of CdS/CdSe QDs
Prior to electrodeposition, the as-synthesized array samples were immersed into a surface passivation solution which has been modified from the study39 elsewhere. Briefly, the as-synthesized TNW arrays, TNW–TNS arrays and TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays are immersed into the aqueous solution containing 0.03 M H3BO3 and 0.03 M (NH4)2TiF6 at room temperature for 30 min and washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The electrodeposition conditions of CdS and CdSe QDs were optimized from our previous report.44 Briefly, for the electrodeposition of CdS QDs, the electrolyte containing 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2, 0.2 M CS(NH2)2, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water 1/1 (v/v) was maintained at 90 °C for 15 min with a constant current of 0.625 mA cm−2. After that, the electrode was taken out and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. For the electrodeposition of CdSe QDs, the electrolyte with a solution pH 7.5–8 contained 0.02 M Cd(CH3COO)2, 0.04 M ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) and 0.02 M Na2SeSO3 which was prepared by refluxing 0.24 g Se powder and 1.0 g Na2SO3 in water at 100 °C for 3 h. The electrodeposition was processed at room temperature for 35 min with a constant current of 0.625 mA cm−2.
QDSSC fabrication
The TNW arrays, TNW–TNS arrays and hyperbranched heterostructured TNW–TNS–ZNR hybrid arrays were used as photoanodes with an active area of 0.16 cm2 for quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The photoanodes were assembled with a Pt counter electrode or Cu2S counter electrode in a sandwich type in order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance, and the polysulfide electrolyte was injected into the space of the QDSSC devices. The preparation of the Pt counter electrode and the polysulfide electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M NaOH in methanol–water (v/v 7:3) was the same as in our previous report.32 The Cu2S counter electrode was synthesized through a facile chemical bath deposition method.33 In brief, N2 was bubbled through the solution containing 0.24 g CuSO4 and 60 mL deionized water for 10 min to eliminate the oxygen in water. Then, 0.37 g Na2S2O3·5H2O was added to the system forming a light green solution, which was kept in a 90 °C water bath for 1 h. After that, the Cu2S counter electrode was rinsed with deionized water and dried in ambient air.
Characterization
The phase structure of the sample was characterized by using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) and the intrinsic morphology and structure of TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays were characterized with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010 HR) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F). The diffused reflectance spectra and the absorption spectra were characterized by using a UV/Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3150) assembled with an integrating sphere. The photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs was characterized using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192) to simulate AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and the intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a Keithley 2000 multimeter incorporated with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) at a bias potential of −0.5 V in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 1 MHz under dark conditions. Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was also performed on the same electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion
The schematic illustrations and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM images of TNW, branched TNW–TNS arrays and hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays at low and high magnifications are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1b, e and h reveal that the thickness of the vertically aligned branched or hyperbranched arrays did not change even after the branched modification of TNS and ZNR, which exhibited a similar value of approximately ∼15 μm.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the TNW backbone is very smooth, which is believed to provide a direct electric pathway for fast electron transport but possess a low internal surface area for insufficient sensitizer anchoring, thus limiting the photocurrent density and photovoltaic performance when applied in solar cells.27 Hence, 2D TNSs (10–20 nm in thickness and 400–500 nm in length) were grown epitaxially on the TNW backbone through an acid-thermal reaction, which form the homostructured branched arrays (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, additional 1D ZnO nanorods (50–100 nm in thickness and 500–700 nm in length) were germinated on both TNW and TNS scaffolds, which cover all the space and voids of the TNW–TNS arrays (Fig. 1g), and eventually form the hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays.
These extremely complicated heterostructured arrays are believed to increase not only the surface area, but also the light scattering and trapping abilities which results in the enhancement of light harvesting efficiency of QDSSCs. Also, the secondary branches can link the TNW, TNS and ZNR together to form a porous and interconnected network for better electrolyte penetration and contact. The phase purity of the TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays and their CdS/CdSe quantum dot sensitized derivatives is characterized by XRD measurements (shown in Fig. S1†), through which the TNW and TNW–TNS arrays can be indexed to a pure anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS no. 21-1272). As for the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays, the additional peaks located at 31.8°, 34.4° and 36.3° can be indexed to (100), (002), and (101) planes of the crystalline ZnO (green rhombus shown in Fig. S1†) (JCPDS no. 65-3411). Moreover, the TNW–TNS–ZNR@QD samples in the XRD pattern exhibit wide peaks at 42° and 44°, which can be indexed to the (208) facet of cubic CdS (JCPDS no. 65-2887) and the (220) facet of cubic CdSe (JCPDS no. 65-2891), respectively.31
The schematic diagram of a step-by-step synthesis route to fabricate TNW arrays, TNW–TNS branched arrays and TNW–TNS–ZNR hyperbranched heterostructured arrays is shown in Fig. 2. The first-step hydrothermal reaction for the growth of TNW arrays on FTO glass and the second-step acid-thermal reaction for the preparation of TNW–TNS branched arrays have been modified from our previous report21 and detailed in the Experimental section. The third-step ZNR branched modification using a seed-assisted hydrothermal approach was optimized from the previous report,38 resulting in the formation of interesting hyperbranched TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured arrays. It is worth noting that the ZnO nanorods are epitaxially grown on both the TNW backbone and TNS leaves as seen from the magnified sketch in Fig. 2.

The diffused reflectance spectra of TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR array photoanodes are shown in Fig. 3. Compared to the pristine TNW array film, the TNW–TNS branched arrays and TNW–TNS–ZNR hyperbranched array films show improved light scattering abilities (TNW–TNS–ZNR > TNW–TNS > TNW) in the overall wavelength region from 380 nm to 800 nm due to the epitaxial growth of TNS and ZNR building units in all directions, which is beneficial to scatter and trap the light within the branched networks. The enhanced light scattering capability would contribute greatly to improve the photocurrent and thus improve the overall PCE of QDSSCs.

To further investigate the dynamics of charge transport and recombination within QDSSCs based on TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR array architectures, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements are processed and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. The Nyquist curve from EIS spectra and the corresponding stimulated resistance parameters are tabulated in Table S1.† Typically, R2 indicates the recombination resistance for the electron transfer process at the semiconductor array/quantum dot/electrolyte interface (the second semicircle) and τr is defined as the electron lifetime within the cells. In particular, R2 increased from 52.11 Ω (TNW) to 94.13 Ω (TNW–TNS) and to 103.9 Ω (TNW–TNS–ZNR), and the electron lifetime (τr) increased from 66 ms (TNW) to 88 ms (TNW/ZNS) and then to 99 ms (TNW/ZNR). The increased electron lifetime is in good accordance with increased Voc, indicating the effectiveness of charge extraction and collection upon the additional growth of branches.

In addition, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements have been conducted to further shed light on the intrinsic electron transportation and charge recombination within the films of TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays. Fig. 4b shows the electron transport time (τd) and the electron lifetime (τr) for TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR array based QDSSCs, where τd represents the transit time of the photogenerated electron within the photoanode films while τr represents the recombination time of electrons with Sn2− in the electrolyte. These two parameters can be calculated from the IMPS and IMVS plots by using the expression (τd = 1/2πfd, τr = 1/2πfr), in which fd and fr stand for the characteristic minimum frequency of the IMPS and IMVS imaginary component, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the TNW based QDSSCs have smaller τd and τr than the TNW–TNS branched array and TNW–TNS–ZNR hyperbranched array based QDSSCs, indicating a faster electron transport rate yet a larger recombination rate for the TNW based QDSSCs. Although, the introduction of TNS leaves and ZNR branches would to some extent prolong the charge transport pathway, for the same electrodeposition conditions, the enlarged surface area would somehow decrease the thickness of the QD layer, which in turn would benefit the electron injection and thus suppresses the charge recombination. When taking the electron transport time and electron lifetime into consideration in a combined manner, the charge collection efficiency can be evaluated, as shown in Fig. S2.† Although the electron transport time becomes longer due to the prolonged transport pathway after the growth of branches, the charge collection efficiency still increases for branched array based cells owing to considerable enhancement of electron lifetime. When compared to the TNW–TNS counterpart, the higher electron lifetime of TNW–TNS–ZNR cells should be attributed to the ingenious integration of well-defined TiO2 and ZnO building units (i.e., nanowires, nanosheets and nanorods), in which the fast charge mobility of ZnO is beneficial for the collection of the photogenerated electrons from QDs in a quite efficient way. Also, the matched energy band alignment as well as well-connected hyperbranched network will help to transfer the electrons in a super highway within the TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays. Consequently, the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array based QDSSCs exhibit 49% higher PCE as compared to TNW array based QDSSCs.
The photocurrent density–photovoltage curves (J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 5a) of QDSSCs based on TNW, TNW–TNS array and TNW–TNS–ZNR hybrid array photoanodes are characterized to evaluate the role of the branched array morphology in photovoltaic performances. The detailed parameters such as short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversation efficiency (η) of TNW, TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR arrays are summarized in Table S2.† Not surprisingly, after the branched modification, QDSSCs based on such branched array photoanodes exhibit better photovoltaic performance as compared to the pristine analogous TNW arrays (TNW–TNS–ZNR > TNW–TNS > TNW). Specifically, TNW–TNS branched array based QDSSCs exhibit a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3.75%, which is almost 32% higher than that of the smooth TNW array based QDSSCs (2.85%). A further PCE enhancement of up to 4.25% was achieved by using the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured hyperbranched arrays. It is better than 1D TiO2 based QDSSCs with 2–3% in photovoltaic performance reported elsewhere.32,45,46 Obviously, such an impressive improvement should be owing to the enhancement of Jsc, Voc and FF. In detail, the Jsc increased from 12.98 mA cm−2 for TNW to 14.71 mA cm−2 for TNW–TNS branched, and to 15.95 mA cm−2 for TNW–TNS–ZNR hybrid arrays, owing to the increased light absorption (Fig. S3†) and improved light scattering abilities (Fig. 3) and thus enhanced the light harvesting efficiency. The Voc increased from 477 mV (TNW) to 489 mV (TNW–TNS) and to 505 mV (TNW–TNS–ZNR), which can be partially ascribed to the thinner thickness of QDs deposited on TNW–TNS and TNW–TNS–ZNR array photoanodes due to the enlarged surface area, and thus leads to much more efficient electron injection and a suppressed recombination reaction.32 Also, the FF increased from 0.46 (TNW) to 0.52 (TNW–TNS) and to 0.53 (TNW–TNS–ZNR) due to the enhanced connection between the roots of arrays and the FTO glass after the step-by-step branched modification (Fig. S4†). To further evaluate the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs, the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra which is highly corresponding to the Jsc of the QDSSCs, were measured as a function of wavelength ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 5b). Obviously, the IPCE value of QDSSCs based on branched or hyperbranched array photoanodes is higher than that of pristine TNW array counterparts (TNW–TNS–ZNR > TNW–TNS > TNW) in the whole wavelength region from 380 nm to 800 nm. The highest IPCE value at around 520 nm is 66.2%, 71.8% and 79.9%, accompanied by their integrated current densities from the IPCE spectra, which are 12.33 mA cm−2, 14.47 mA cm−2 and 15.55 mA cm−2 for QDSSCs based on TNW arrays, TNW–TNS branched arrays and TNW–TNS–ZNR hyperbranched arrays, respectively. This is in good accordance with the measured Jsc shown in Table S2.† It is notable that an obvious red-shift phenomenon is observed for TNW–TNS–ZNR hybrid heterostructured array and TNW–TNS branched array based QDSSCs in the longer wavelength range from 650 nm to 750 nm compared to TNW based QDSSCs due to the enhancement of light scattering and harvesting capability in the longer wavelength region. To the best of our knowledge, IPCE (λ) = LHE(λ)φinj(λ)φregηcc(λ)33 and the enhancement of IPCE values in the whole wavelength can be attributed to the increased light harvesting efficiency (shown in Fig. 3 and S3†) as well as enhanced charge collection efficiency (Fig. S2†).

As we all know, the Pt based counter electrode has poor electrocatalytic activities in the polysulfide electrolyte which cause a higher transfer resistance and a lower QD regeneration rate.47 Therefore, a thin film of Cu2S is introduced on FTO glass as a counter electrode via a simple and facile chemical bath deposition as reported previously.33 With the as-synthesized Cu2S counter electrode, we fabricate the TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array based QDSSCs, and the detailed photovoltaic performance compared with that of the Pt counter electrode based QDSSCs is summarized in Table S2.† The typical J–V curve is shown in Fig. 6a. To further characterize the dynamics of charge transport and recombination within QDSSCs based on Pt and Cu2S counter electrodes, EIS studies are carried out, the results of which are shown in Fig. 6b. As a result, TNW–TNS–ZNR heterostructured array based QDSSCs with a Cu2S counter electrode further improve the photovoltaic performance and an impressive PCE as high as 5.38% has been achieved (Jsc = 19.19 mA cm−2; Voc = 517 mV, FF = 0.54), 27% higher than that of Pt based counterpart (Jsc = 15.95 mA cm−2; Voc = 505 mV, FF = 0.53). This result is mainly attributed to the improvement of Jsc which is due to the superior electrocatalytic capabilities and lower charge resistance41 of the Cu2S counter electrode (R1 = 50.19 ohm for the Cu2S counter electrode compared to 125.2 ohm for the Pt counter electrode).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized vertically aligned TNW–TNS–ZNR hyperbranched heterostructured arrays on TCO substrates as efficient photoanode materials for QDSSCs. Compared to pristine TNW arrays, the epitaxial growth of branches (TNS and ZNR) is conducive to improve the light scattering and absorption for enhanced light harvesting. Furthermore, under the same electrodeposition conditions, the increased surface area would lead to a thinner QD layer, which is beneficial to suppress the charge recombination for boosted charge collection. Hence, a 49% enhancement of PCE from 2.85% (TNW) to 4.25% (TNW–TNS–ZNR) can be observed. With the application of a Cu2S counter electrode, the eventual PCE can be further optimized to as high as 5.38% for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs based on such hyperbranched heterostructured arrays under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). This work also paves the way for the development of efficient array architectures with heterostructures for efficient energy conversion and storage.
