The designed molecules have an electron donor (D), triazatruxene, connected through different π-bridges and an electron acceptor (A), 2-cyanoacrylic acid. The key parameters of the optoelectronic and photoelectric performances were computed by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Compared to the original dye R, the designed compounds have a higher light harvesting ability with an absorption spectrum that appeared around the infrared region. The maximum absorption wavelength shifted to red from 78 nm to 148 nm, and the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) curve broadened in the visible region and excellent electron injection efficiency was observed. All these contribute to better short-circuit current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The results obtained through the global evaluation model for the reference dye R were JSC = 19.21 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.838 V, and PCE = 13.92%. These values are closer to the experimental results (JSC = 19.74 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.957 V, and PCE = 13.4%). The Tat-2 dye achieved a PCE of 23.75%. Therefore, it can be considered a candidate dye for high-yield DSSCs.
1. Introduction
With the problem of the scarcity of traditional energy sources and the increasing demand for them on a large scale, it has become necessary to search for an alternative, clean energy at the lowest cost. Solar energy presents an alternative source owing to its abundance and cleanliness.1,2 Alternately, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much interest due to their high efficiency, simplicity of fabrication, ecology, and low costs.3–5 The DSSC working process mainly comprises photoexcitation, electron injection, electron collection, and dye regeneration.3 Sensitizing dye is a key component of DSSCs, responsible for light absorption, generation, and separation of electrical charges. Since Grätzel and O'Regan (1991) reported that the PCE of DSSCs reached 7.1%,6 numerous studies have focused on developing dye structures to design high-performance DSSCs.7–9 In general, metal–organic complexes and metal-free organic compounds are used as two diverse dyes in DSSC devices. Organic metal complexes (such as ruthenium and porphyrin) exhibit a record power conversion efficiency of 11% in 1.5 G AM lighting.10 But such sensitizers face financial and environmental problems.11 Hence, metal-free organic dyes are a good alternative because they have advantages such as their environmental friendliness, low cost, easy purification, and abundant raw materials.11 Among metal-free sensitizers, dyes with a (D–π–A) structure – in which D is the donor (electron-rich) moiety and A is the acceptor (electron-poor) moiety connected by a π-bridge – are frequently used because they can cause intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from D to A via the π-bridge, thus increasing the light-capturing capacity by red-shifting and widening the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer.12–15
Diverse donor groups with a better power conversion efficiency are attractive options, including triphenylmethane,16,17 carbazole,18 indoline,19 quinoxaline,20 dialkylamine,21 pyrrolidino,22 coumarin,23 and triazatruxene.24 To increase the PCE of DSSCs, it is necessary to reduce the energy gap and expand the absorption spectrum. Likewise, the ELUMO should be higher than that of the conduction band of the semiconductor (TiO2), and the EHOMO must be lower than the HOMO energy of electrolyte to accept electrons from a redox electrolyte pair (I−/I3−).
Recently, Zhang et al. synthesized two D–π–A type triazatruxene organic dyes containing different acceptors. The dye containing 4-ethyl benzoic acid as an electron acceptor showed excellent PCE (η = 13.4%) under standard AM 1.5G sunlight. Its VOC is 0.957 V and the photocurrent (JSC) is 19.74 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) is 70.8%. Moreover, to achieve higher-performance organic dyes, we designed six new organic dyes by introducing different π-bridges and changing the benzoic acid anchor group into a cyanoacetic acid group (see Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Names and chemical structures of studied dyes. 
Thus, the estimated efficiency of the original dye, named R in this work, from the photovoltage (I–V) model confirms the corresponding experimental value, with an error generally lower than 1% (13.92% calculated vs. 13.4% experimental).24 Here, we performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations to compute the optical and electrical parameters related to the performance of these studied compounds, including absorption spectra, electron injection strength, charge recombination processes, conduction bands, energy level shifts, etc.
This work will provide experimental scientists with new ideas for creating these new dyes and demonstrating their superior performance in optoelectronic applications.
2. Computational details
The ground state geometry of the reference and designed dyes was optimized using the functional DFT/B3LYP,25–27 with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM)28,29 in a dichloromethane solvent, according to the experiment. The C, H, O, N, and S atoms were simulated using the 6-31G(d,p)30,31 basis set, while the Ti atoms were simulated with the GenECP method using the LANL2DZ basis set.32 At the same theoretical level, all vibration frequency calculations showed that all optimized structures were at stationary points without any imaginary frequency. TD-DFT/BHandH/6-31G(d,p) methods were applied to obtain the absorption parameters of the designed dyes.33 Furthermore, the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies were calculated using a single point at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Additionally, the density of state (DOS) and partial density of state (PDOS) diagrams of dye@(TiO2)9 complexes were simulated using the Multiwfn 3.8 program34,35 to determine the movement of the conduction band of TiO2 (ΔECB).36 Furthermore, the charge density difference (CDD) maps used to study the charge transfer during the electronic transition were also simulated using the Multiwfn 3.8 program. Molecular recombination distances were investigated to estimate the magnitude of charge recombination between the injected electrons and the dye cation.36 Performances of molecular electron injection were assessed using Marcus theory.37
According to Sánchez-de-Armas et al. (2010), the (TiO2)9 clusters are sufficient to simulate the correct properties of dye@(TiO2)9 complexes.38,39 The attachment of the carboxylic acid group (R-COOH) to the surface of (TiO2) occurs in three modes: monodentate, chelated, and bidentate bridged. Generally, the bidentate chelation mode, in which two oxygen atoms are coupled to the same Ti atoms, is considered the most stable mode compared to the other modes.40–42 Therefore, in this work, we used the bidentate bridged mode to achieve optimal coupling in the dye@(TiO2)9 system (see Fig. S3, ESI†). All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.43
3. Frontier molecular orbitals, energy gaps
The frontier molecular orbitals energy levels and energy gaps of the studied compounds before and after incorporation into titania are presented in Fig. 2, and their associated values are summarized in Table 1. While the changes in the EHOMO levels of all dye@(TiO2)9 systems compared to the isolated compounds do not show any significant difference, the ELUMO levels of R@(TiO2)9, Tat-1@(TiO2)9, Tat-3@(TiO2)9, and Tat-5@(TiO2)9 systems are significantly decreased when compared with the LUMO value of the isolated compounds. This demonstrates that the LUMO of the studied compounds has a strong electronic coupling with the (TiO2)9 cluster. Moreover, the ELUMO of the Tat-2@(TiO2)9, Tat-4@(TiO2)9, and Tat-6@(TiO2)9 systems, is almost of the same order as the ELUMO of the free compounds. Furthermore, the Eg values of all dye@(TiO2)9 systems are decreased when switching from the free to the adsorbed system.

The energy gaps for dye@(TiO2)9 systems increase in the following order: Tat-6@(TiO2)9 < Tat-2@(TiO2)9 < Tat-1@(TiO2)9 = Tat-5@(TiO2)9 < Tat-3@(TiO2)9 = Tat-4@(TiO2)9 < R@(TiO2)9. These results indicate that the Tat-2@(TiO2)9 and Tat-6@(TiO2)9 systems have a low Egap value, which means that these compounds would have a heavy absorption band in the electronic spectrum and show better intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).44 The electron density distributions of HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 for dye@(TiO2)9 systems can be seen in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Electron density distributions of (HOMO−1 to LUMO+1) of dye@(TiO2)9 systems with isovalues of 0.02. 
The electron density of HOMO−1 and HOMO is completely delocalized on the dyes, while LUMOs of R@(TiO2)9, Tat-1@(TiO2)9, Tat-3@(TiO2)9, and Tat-5@(TiO2)9 are mainly located on the (TiO2)9 cluster, in contrast to the Tat-2@(TiO2)9, Tat-4@(TiO2)9, and Tat-6@(TiO2)9 systems, for which, they are observed to be distributed in the conjugated region of the dyes. Fortunately, the LUMO+1 of R@(TiO2)9Tat-2@(TiO2)9, Tat-4@(TiO2)9, and Tat-6@(TiO2)9 systems are mostly located on the (TiO2)9 cluster. Thus, understandable intramolecular charge transfers (ICTs) may be observed in the compounds studied.
4. UV-visible spectra of dyes@(TiO2)9
To fully understand the absorption properties of the dye@(TiO2)9 complexes, TD-DFT calculations were performed with the BHandH/6-31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level of theory, from which the calculated absorption of the original Rd@(TiO2)9 complex was found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental value (513 nm simulated versus 519 nm experimental).24 The UV-vis absorption spectra of the studied dye@(TiO2)9 complexes are presented in Fig. 4, and the pertinent data are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the isolated compounds (see Table S1, ESI†), the absorption wavelengths (λmax) of Tat-2@(TiO2)9, Tat-3@(TiO2)9, Tat-4@(TiO2)9, and Tat-6@(TiO2)9 systems show a redshift with values of 15.85, 3.8, 8.74, and 7.86 nm, respectively. On the other hand, Rd@(TiO2)9, Tat-1@(TiO2)9, and Tat-5@(TiO2)9 systems have the same values as the isolated compounds. Furthermore, the oscillator strengths for all dye@(TiO2)9 systems increase slightly compared with those of the isolated compounds. This implies a heavy interaction between the dyes and (TiO2)9 semiconductors. For the band (λmax), the main electronic transition characters of dye@(TiO2)9 systems are from the HOMO and HOMO−2 to LUMO.

5. Electron injection analysis
The injection time (τ), broadening width (ℏΓ), and ELUMO were calculated using eqn S4–S8 (see the ESI†) and the values are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated results clearly show that the election injection is ultra-fast and efficient for all the designed dyes since all the electron injection times τ are in femtosecond (fs), which will have a positive impact on JSC.

Exciton binding energy (Eb) is an important parameter for determining the ability of excitons to dissociate upon formation during photoinduced excitation. Generally, a dye should have a low exciton binding energy for high conversion energy.45 The binding energy of the investigated dyes is theoretically calculated from eqn (S1) (see the ESI†). The calculated IP, EA, and Eb of studied dyes are summarized in Table 3. We take the absolute value of Eb for comparison. According to Table 3, the two dyes Tat-2 and Tat-6 have the lowest energy compared to the other compounds, indicating that these compounds have a high charge transfer rate, a considerable current charge density (JSC) and high conversion efficiency (PCE).

6. Excited-state and the fluorescent lifetime
The excited-state lifetime (τ1) and fluorescence lifetime (τ2) are crucial factors in judging the charge transfer efficiency. Specifically, the greater the τ1 and τ2, the longer the dye electron lifetime in the excited state, facilitating injection and reducing the risk of electron recombination, thereby resulting in better photoelectric performance.46–48 The expressions for τ1 and τ2 are discussed in the ESI,† and the results obtained are tabulated in Table 4 and Table S2 (ESI†). The calculated τ1 values of the studied compounds increase in the following order: Tat-3 < Tat-1 < Tat-4 < Rd< Tat-5 < Tat-2 < Tat-6. Meanwhile, the fluorescence lifetime τ2 is sorted according to the following trend: Tat-3 < Tat-4 < Tat-1 < Rd < Tat-5 < Tat-2 < Tat-6. So, Tat-2 and Tat-6 have longer τ1 and τ2, indicating that both Tat-2 and Tat-6 dyes have better photoelectric performance and higher emission efficiency, leading to better efficiency of DSSCs.

The recombination process also influences the overall performance of DSSCs. Generally, a weaker electron recombination process is advantageous for reducing electron loss.49,50 Durrant et al. reported that the charge recombination process could be estimated from the distance between the dye cation hole and the surface of TiO2.49–51 The larger the separation distance, the slower the recombination between the dye and the semiconductor.
As demonstrated in Fig. 6, all the designed dyes have a considerable charge recombination distance, especially that of Tat-3 dye which has the largest large charge recombination distance. This clearly shows that the electron collection capacity of the Tat-3 dye will be optimal.

7. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties
In general, having excellent ICT properties means that dyes possess better molecular charge transfer ability,52 which can easily contribute to better photoelectric performance. To study whether electrons from a dye can be transferred efficiently to TiO2, ten excited states were calculated for charge density difference analysis (Table 5 and Table S3, ESI†). As shown in the charge density difference diagram, all the systems can achieve efficient electron–hole separation up to S5(Rd@(TiO2)9), S6(Tat-1@(TiO2)9), S6(Tat-2@(TiO2)9), S5(Tat-3@(TiO2)9), S6(Tat-4@(TiO2)9), S6(Tat-5@(TiO2)9), and S9(Tat-6@(TiO2)9). Consequently, the holes are concentrated on dyes and the electrons are concentrated on TiO2. Simultaneously, all DCT indices in this table are large, while all Sr and Ec indices are small. The main reason is that the studied compounds are not symmetric systems; thus the CT transitions are monodirectional.53 The Δr indices imply that the excitations from the ground state (S0) to the 5th, 6th, and 9th excited states possess strong CT character since they have large Δr for all composites. These findings indicate that the designed compounds might be effective sensitisers for DSSC applications.

8. Short-circuit current density (JSC)
The prediction of JSC would propose a theoretical reference to evaluate the performance of DSSCs. The ESI† section presents the theoretical relationships for calculating JSC. The simulated JSC values of investigated compounds are tabulated in Table 6 and Table S4 (ESI†). Fig. 7a and b, clearly shows the integral curve and ideal photocurrent of all dyes. The calculated JSC values are arranged as follows: JSC(Tat-2) > JSC(Tat-6) > JSC(Tat-4) > JSC(Tat-2) > JSC(Tat-1) > JSC(Tat-5) > JSC(Tat-3) > JSC(Rd). Accordingly, the predicted and experimental values of the original molecule Rd are in agreement (19.21 mA cm−2 calculated vs. 19.75 mA cm−2 experimental). The rationale for the high JSC value of Tat-2 dye, among others, can be understood from its light capturing capability. Fig. 7 clearly shows that the Tat-2 dye has a broadened and red-shifted LHE(λ), indicating its better light-harvesting ability and implying that the Tat-2 dye has the best short-circuit current density among all dyes. Furthermore, increasing JSC should increase the PCE of the DSSCs based on Tat-2.

9. Open-circuit photovoltage (VOC)
Formula (25) of the ESI† clearly shows that VOC is positively correlated with ΔECB. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the simulated ΔECB values of the studied dyes are in the range of 0.07–0.12 eV. Meanwhile, the values of VOC and other parameters related to VOC of the investigated compounds are marked in Table 5. As indicated in Table 7 and Table S4 (ESI†), the theoretical and experimental values obtained for VOC are very close (0.838 V calculated vs. 0.957 V experimental). In addition, the VOC values of Tat-2, Tat-4, and Tat-6 are much larger than those of other dyes.

10. Power conversion efficiency (PCE)
The intensity–voltage diagrams obtained according to eqn (S27) and (S28) (see ESI†) are depicted in Fig. 9. Table 8 and Table S5 (ESI†) demonstrate that the estimated efficiency of the reference dye is consistent with the corresponding experimental value, with errors less than 1%. JSC, VOC, and FF parameters are also well reproduced and are comparable with the experimental results (see Table S4, ESI†). From the I–V curves illustrated in Fig. 9 and their corresponding results, which are tabulated in Table 8, the calculated PCE values are as follows: Tat-2 (23.74%) > Tat-6 (22.52%) > Tat-4 (20.64%) > Tat-1 (19.09%) > Tat-5 (18.56%) > Tat-3 (17.40%) > Rd (13.92%). Tat-2 and Tat-6 present much higher efficiencies than the other studied dyes due to their better intramolecular charge transfer characteristics, ability to donate and withdraw electrons, excellent optoelectronic parameters, and short electron injection time.

11. Dye adsorption on (TiO2)9
The stability of the dye@(TiO2)9 compounds, the interaction energy, and the type of dye adsorption on the TiO2 cluster can reflect molecular stability.54 Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†) show in detail the optimized TiO2 cluster structures seen from different angles and the modes of dye fixation on TiO2. The FT-IR spectra of the anchor groups of the isolated compounds described in Fig. 10 and Fig. S4 (ESI†) exhibit COOH vibrations at the following frequencies: Rd (1783.61 cm−1), Tat-1 (1777.77 cm−1), Tat-2 (1777.08 cm−1), Tat-3 (1776.92 cm−1), Tat-4 (1779.49 cm−1), Tat-5 (1777.17 cm−1), and Tat-6 (1776.41 cm−1); while the corresponding frequencies are 1436.80, 1426.10, 1381.70, 1419.42, 1393.67, 1425.23, 1373.45 cm−1, respectively, for dye@(TiO2)9 systems. This implies that the (TiO2)9 clusters and dyes were joined by the –COOTi group55 using the bidentate cheating model as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

Table 9 and Fig. 11 demonstrate that the binding distances between Ti and O atoms of compounds adsorbed on the (TiO2)9 (101) surface are in the range of 2.05156–2.22060 Å, and the interaction energy between dyes and TiO2 is in the range of −23.1147 to −33.4764 kcal mol−1. These calculated results confirm the strong adsorption of the dyes on the substrate, which favors a faster electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band.56

12. Conclusions
In this work, the optoelectronic characteristics of the designed dyes Tat-i, (i = 1–6) were extensively examined using DFT and TD-DFT techniques based on the outstanding dye R, which was synthesized by experiments. The results indicate that modifying the π-bridge and anchoring group of the original molecule R is a great way to enhance dye performance since it will widen and redshift the absorption spectra and decrease the HOMO–LUMO band gap. Tat-1 was chosen as the reference for the designed compounds; five new organic compounds were created by exchanging the sulfur atom of the benzothiadiazole moiety with five electron-donor groups (C(CH3)2, N–CH3, O, Se, and Si(CH3)2). Compared to the reference compound R, the designed dyes, especially Tat-3, had a smaller HOMO–LUMO band gap, higher molecular LHE, stronger and larger absorption spectra, and an improved molecular charge transfer performance. The key factors determining the cell efficiency, including JSC, VOC, and PCE were calculated in detail by constructing an I–V evaluation model. The experimental PCE of 13.4% for Rd is comparable to the 13.92% achieved using the constructed I–V evaluation model. This shows the efficiency of the calculation model. The fact that the bidentate chelation pattern closely relates Tat-2, and the fact that it has better ICT properties, longer excited states and fluorescence lifetime, lower recombination, shorter electron injection time, and better light-harvesting abilities with larger LHE, all explain why the Tat-2 composite has an excellent PCE of 23.74% among the designed dyes. Finally, Tat-2 is a promising candidate for efficient DSSC devices. This paper offers a sound theoretical foundation for DSSC power performance assessment and performance prediction. The present theoretical study would inspire experimenters to accelerate and synthesize new dyes for high-performance DSSCs.
