    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractThe efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has developed rapidly in recent years, but the stability has still lagged behind. The ion migration effect, especially from small methylammonium (MA) cations, is a main factor for stability issues, and the use of MA-free perovskites is one potential pathway to suppress ion migration. In this work, we reveal that there is a much lower valence band maximum (VBM) of −5.8 eV for the most studied MA-free perovskite FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3, which is much different from that of traditional perovskites, and the huge energy level mismatch between perovskites and the hole transport layer (HTL) is a major factor in limiting the device performance of MA-free PSCs. It was found that doping the conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br) into the perovskite can significantly promote anode contact and result in better device performance as well as stability of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 based MA-free PSCs in an inverted planar structure. PFN-Br increases the energy position of the VBM of perovskites and results in well-matched energy levels between the perovskite and HTL of poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine (PTAA). Carrier extraction and transportation are highly encouraged at the surface of PTAA/perovskite, and corresponding interface recombination is effectively suppressed. As a result, a 60 mV increase in VOC is achieved, and this promotes an excellent device efficiency of 20.32%. At the same time, the efficient device displays significant stability under continuous illumination and bias under MPP conditions, and could maintain 80% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under continuous operation under one sun illumination over 500 hours.
Introduction
Tremendous developments have resulted in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) being some of the most promising photovoltaic materials with high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that have increased from 3.81% to 25.2% for single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1,2 However, the long-term stability of such kinds of material is still a great challenge and a huge barrier for its further commercialization.3–7 It has been demonstrated that methylammonium (MA) cations contribute greatly to the high photovoltaic performance of previously reported high-PCE devices,8–19 but it was also shown that MA cations take great responsibility for the degradation of device stability.20–23 On the one hand, extremely high hygroscopicity of MA cations accelerates the decomposition of perovskites under ambient atmosphere, especially in high moisture conditions.5,6 On the other hand, the photo- and thermal stability of perovskites are heavily decreased by MA cations,23 which can easily escape from a perovskite film even at a low temperature of ∼85 °C, and the residual PbI2 rapidly degrades to metallic lead when excitation occurs during the photochemical process, generating numerous hole traps to form Frenkel defects.21,23–25 Recently, much attention has been devoted to MA-free perovskites, which show enhanced thermal and photo stabilities of perovskite solar cells.26–36 Silver et al. reported Rb5Cs10FAPbI3 based MA-free PSCs with an efficiency of 20.35% and high operational stability under continuous illumination at the maximum power point (MPP).29 Wang et al. fabricated the perovskite solar cells for concentrator photovoltaics with excellent photostability based on FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3, and an outstanding efficiency of 21.1% was achieved under one sun, whilst the encapsulated device maintained over 90% of its original efficiency after 150 h under continuous illumination of 10 suns at the MPP.31 Chen et al. reported enhanced thermal stability of an MA-free perovskite and the device could retain over 85% of its initial PCE after thermal annealing at 85 °C for 1000 h in a nitrogen atmosphere.27
In addition, MA cations and their fragments play a crucial role in ion migration, which influences the long-term stability as well as the hysteresis effect. This migration will be further accelerated under illumination, an external electric field and with increased temperature in real operation conditions.6,20,37–39 Producing all inorganic perovskites without organic cations is one of the most promising pathways to improve stability by suppressing the ion migration effect, but the wide bandgaps of all inorganic perovskites greatly limit their device efficiencies.40–45 Alternatively, FA/Cs double-cation composition provides another potential pathway to produce a balanced device with high efficiency and improved stability.26,27,29,31
In this work, we reveal that there is a much lower valence band maximum (VBM) of −5.8 eV for the most studied MA-free perovskite of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3, which is much different from traditional perovskites, as there is a large energy level mismatch between the perovskite and the hole transport layer (HTL). The hydrophobic nature of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) is believed to be a very important factor for high performance inverted solar cells, and this could induce larger grain sizes and boost the VOC and JSC values.46,47 However, a well optimized MA-free control device still has limited device performance with the undesirable VOC value of 1.04 V, because of the low VBM value of −5.8 eV. As a result, a further strategy is needed for the mismatch in energy levels in order to suppress the nonradiative recombination.
A dopant of the conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br) in the perovskite is introduced here and significantly promotes anode contact, resulting in better device performance as well as better stability of MA-free FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 based PSCs with an inverted planar structure. The PFN-Br doping increases the energy position of VBM of the perovskite and results in better energy level alignment between the perovskite and HTL of PTAA. Moreover, it is also beneficial to the quality of perovskites with reduced defect density and increased grain sizes to overcome the barriers in the interface between PTAA and the perovskite. Carrier extraction and transportation are highly encouraged at the surface of the PTAA/perovskite, and the corresponding interface recombination is suppressed. As a result, a 60 mV increase in VOC is achieved, and this promotes excellent device efficiency to 20.32%. At the same time, the efficient device displays significantly enhanced stability under continuous illumination and bias at MPP conditions, and this could retain 80% of its initial PCE under continuous illumination of one sun for over 500 h.
ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu was taken as the primary architecture of the device, as shown in Fig. 1a. Firstly, a thin layer of PFN-Br was deposited on the surface of PTAA, and then the perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the PFN-Br/PTAA film for the doping process. PFN-Br with strong polar ionic pendant groups has a high solubility in DMF, and could be re-dissolved by the perovskite precursor solution and diffuse into the perovskite film before crystallization for doping, as shown in Fig. 1b.

Ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to investigate the impact of PFN-Br on the HOMO of PTAA and the VBM of the perovskite, and this suggests that the introduction of PFN-Br effectively narrows the energy gap between the VBM of the perovskite and the HOMO of PTAA to obtain a well-matched energy level, and improves the VBM of the perovskite based FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 composition from −5.8 eV to −5.6 eV, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The energy positions of the HOMO for the molecule and of the VBM for the semiconductor could be calculated according to the literature.45

In order to investigate the impact of PFN-Br on PTAA and on the perovskite, as well as evaluate VOC, firstly PFN-Br was deposited on PTAA. The cut-off of PTAA had a blue shift from 16.97 eV to 16.90 eV and the onset had the same shift from 0.86 eV to 0.74 eV after the PTAA film was modified with PFN-Br as well, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. As a result, the HOMO of PTAA was elevated from −5.1 eV to −5.0 eV after modification. This indicates that the modification of PFN-Br on PTAA could exacerbate the energy gap between the HOMO of PTAA and the VBM of the perovskite, and this could lead to a further VOC loss at the interface of the PTAA/perovskite. Clearly, the promotion of VOC is not derived from PTAA modified with PFN-Br. Accordingly, it was revealed that PFN-Br penetrates into the perovskite film and changes the VBM position of the perovskite. Furthermore, the ITO/PTAA/perovskite and ITO/PTAA/PFN-Br/perovskite were adopted to study the role of PFN-Br modification, as shown in Fig. 2e and f. It was clear that the onset and cut-off of the pristine perovskite were 0.91 eV and 16.28 eV, respectively. After modification with PFN-Br, there was a blue shift for the onset from 0.91 eV to 0.76 eV. Meanwhile, a red shift could be observed from 16.28 eV to 16.32 eV for the cut-off, and the position of the VBM was estimated for the pristine perovskite after PFN-Br doping, which had a dramatic shift from −5.8 eV to −5.6 eV by calculations.45
The UPS results showed the variation in energy levels of the top surface of the perovskite films. PFN-Br was also deposited on the top of the perovskite to further investigate the impact of PFN-Br on the energy levels of the perovskite and to confirm PFN-Br doping in the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, it is clear that the VBM of the surface of the perovskite shifted from −5.8 eV to-5.6 eV, which was consistent with the variation of VBM for the PFN-Br doping from the bottom. It is believed that when the perovskite precursor is dropped on the substrate of ITO/PTAA/PFN-Br, a thin layer of PFN-Br is re-dissolved and penetrates into the perovskite film before crystallization, and the diffusion of PFN-Br from the bottom could dope the whole bulk film until the top surface of the perovskite is successfully homogeneous with the assistance of DMF. As a result, this elevates the VBM of the perovskite to about 0.2 eV, which narrows the energy gap between the perovskite and PTAA, as well as decreasing charge accumulation and recombination on the surface.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements with an excitation laser of 405 nm were employed to investigate the dynamics of the photo-excited carriers. As shown in Fig. 3a, perovskite films with and without PFN-Br doping were deposited on quartz glass directly. The PL emission of the control film was located at 766 nm, while a dramatic PL quenching phenomenon was observed after the film was doped with PFN-Br and the intensity of PL decreased about two orders of magnitude. This indicates that doping with PFN-Br is greatly beneficial for the extraction and transportation of carriers. In addition, photoluminescence decay of the perovskite films with and without PFN-Br doping both exhibited a model of two-component exponential decay (Fig. 3b and Table S1†). It is clear that the film with PFN-Br doping shows a shorter lifetime (500 ns) than that of the control film (832 ns). It is believed that the film with PFN-Br doping could significantly increase the charge extraction and reduce the charge accumulation at the interface of the HTL/perovskite. As a result, the interfacial recombination is dramatically suppressed and the voltage loss is effectively decreased.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface view of the perovskite films without and with PFN-Br doping are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The grain sizes of the control film are mainly around 250 nm, and more small grains with sizes of about 150 nm surround the larger grains. However, the perovskite film doped with PFN-Br tends to form more larger grains, which are about 400 nm and consist of less small grains than those of the control film. In addition, the cross-sectional SEM images also show enhanced grain sizes with PFN-Br doping, and this could be throughout the whole perovskite film (Fig. 4c and d). It was shown that there are less grain boundaries in the PFN-Br doping film, and that carriers could transport more effectively passing through the bulk film and decrease the recombination at the grain boundaries. Moreover, it is believed that ion defects at grain boundaries could accelerate the decomposition of perovskites due to the activation of ion migration at grain boundaries being about half in bulk.48 Therefore, less grain boundaries are also helpful for improving the stability of the corresponding device. Trap density is calculated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. ITO/C60/perovskite/C60/Cu was utilized for an electron-only device and ITO/PTAA/perovskite/Au was employed for fabricating a hole-only device. As shown in Fig. 5a–d, the whole region is divided into three regimes: the ohmic regime, representing the linear JD − V relation at low bias; the trap-filling regime; and the trap-free space charge limit current regime. The trap density determines the voltage (VTFL) at which all traps are filled.  where e is the elemental charge, nt is the electron or hole trap density, L is the thickness of the film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. We calculated that the electron trap density was 2.65 × 1015 cm−3 and the hole trap density was 5.60 × 1015 cm−3 for the pristine perovskite film. After the film doping with PFN-Br, the electron trap density was 1.08 × 1015 cm−3 and the hole trap density was 4.61 × 1015 cm−3. This indicates that the doping of PFN-Br could improve the crystalline quality and decrease the trap density of the perovskite film. It was also proved that less recombination centres appear and nonradiative recombination is greatly suppressed.

The J–V curves of the champion devices of control and with PFN-Br doping, as shown in Fig. 6a, demonstrate the energy barrier between the HOMO of PTAA and the VBM of the perovskite, and the decreased charge extraction and transportation of the perovskite film was greatly optimized by PFN-Br doping, resulting in boosted performance. VOC was significantly improved from 1.04 V to 1.10 V, benefiting from the decreased interface recombination. Meanwhile, there was a slight increase of JSC from 22.71 mA cm−2 to 22.92 mA cm−2 with a fill factor as high as 80.60%. Accordingly, PCE was elevated from 19.10% to 20.32%. Fig. 6b presents the statistics of VOC, which shows good repeatability of the control devices with PFN-Br doping for the promotion of VOC. The device performance is further shown under the conditions of both forward and backward scans, as shown in Fig. 6c. There is a high photo response over the whole external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum for the device with PFN-Br doping, as shown in Fig. 6d. There is no obvious change for the cut-off absorption with PFN-Br doping, and it also has no impact on the interface absorption by PTAA. In addition, an increased photo response was recorded after the perovskite film with PFN-Br doping before about 650 nm, especially in the low wavelength region, indicating an enhanced charge transportation and extraction at the surface of the PTAA/perovskite.

To investigate the impact of PFN-Br doping on the top of the perovskite film and of further inserting a PFN-Br layer between ITO and PTAA on device performance, a series of device constructions were also fabricated and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1.† It is worth noting that PFN-Br has bad solubility in nonpolar chlorobenzene (CB) and is like a colloid. When it is used for doping before the perovskite film annealing, it results in bad performance, as shown in Fig. S1†, which shows results for ITO/PTAA/PVK/PFN-Br (CB, before annealing)/C60/BCP/Cu(CBC) and ITO/PFN-Br(DMF)/PTAA/PVK/PFN-Br(CB, before annealing)/CBC. It is believed that PFN-Br could not be doped in the whole perovskite film well without DMF assistance, due to PFN-Br not being able to further diffuse inside to the perovskite film. Compared to the performances of ITO/PTAA/PVK/CBC and ITO/PTAA/PVK/PFN-Br (CB, after annealing), a small difference is found, because PFN-Br is an ultra-thin interface layer rather than doping the perovskite without promotion of VOC. It can be noted that ITO/PFN-Br(DMF)/PTAA/PVK/PFN-Br (CB, after annealing)/CBC has a decrease in JSC and VOC, compared with the device of ITO/PTAA/PVK/CBC, and this results from the working function of ITO with the modification of PFN-Br.49
Finally, a long-term operational stability of a FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 based MA-free PSC with PFN-Br doping was investigated. The aging test of the devices was carried out under MPP condition with continuous one sun illumination in a glovebox. As shown in Fig. 6e, the MAPbI3 based device degraded quickly to around 80% of its initial efficiency within about 150 h and the MA-free device without PFN-Br doping had a better stability, and could retain 80% of its initial PCE after about 230 h. As a strong contrast, the MA-free device with PFN-Br doping could retain 80% of its initial PCE after 536 h. Moreover, the aging temperature should be taken into consideration, since the temperature of the device is not controlled deliberately, the temperature of the cell is maintained at 60–65 °C during the continuous soaking.50 Therefore, the MA-free device with PFN-Br doping based on an inverted structure in our work exhibits superior stability, including thermostability, under the conditions of bias and illumination.
Conclusions
In summary, we propose a strategy to dope MA-free perovskite film with PFN-Br, whose composition is FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 and the structure is an inverted planar junction. It is clear that the energy barrier between the HTL and the perovskite was reduced and that charge extraction and transportation at the interface of the HTL/perovskite were remarkably enhanced by PFN-Br doping. VOC was dramatically improved from 1.04 V to 1.10 V and a high PCE of 20.32% was achieved for the MA-free inverted perovskite device. Moreover, the device displayed excellent enhanced stability under MPP tracing during continuous soaking aging testing, and could retain 80% of its initial PCE after 536 h. This strategy of doping a perovskite film with PFN-Br provides great potential for fabricating a HTL-free device.
Experimental
Materials
FAI (99.5%), CsI (99.99%), PbBr2 (99.99%) and poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine (PTAA) were purchased from Xi'an p-OLED. Fullerene-C60 (C60, >99%) and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, >99%) were obtained from Luminescence Technology Corp. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN-Br) was purchased from Beijing ChenHuaYuanGuang Technology Co. Ltd. PbI2 (99.99999%), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents were used as received.
Device fabrication
The patterned ITO was ultrasonically cleaned by isopropanol, acetone, and isopropanol again for 15 min in sequence before drying in a N2 flow. Then, the ITO substrate was treated with UVO for 15 min and transferred into a glove box. PTAA with a concentration of 2.5 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the surface of ITO at 6000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. After the substrate was cooled down to room temperature, 0.5 mg mL−1 of PFN-Br dissolved in DMF was spin-coated onto the surface of PTAA at 5000 rpm for 20 s. The perovskite precursor solution, which contains FAI, CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 for the chemometric composition of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3 in mixed solutions (DMF/DMSO = 4/1), was prepared. 100 μL perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s and at 6000 rpm for 20 s, and 100 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrate during the second step at 5 s before the end. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 60 min, immediately. Then, 40 nm C60 and 7 nm BCP were thermally evaporated on the surface of the perovskite film as the electron transfer layer and as the blocking layer, respectively. Finally, 80 nm Cu was deposited on the film with a designed mask as the electrode.
Solar cell characterization
A current density–voltage curve was evaluated using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under sun simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation with an AAA class solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO.). The calibration of light intensity with 100 mW cm−2 was executed by a standard Si solar cell, and this was attached with a KG-5 filter. One homemade metal mask without any scatting was employed to define the active area of 0.07 cm−2 before the measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was acquired by a Crowntech. INC. (USA) EQE measurement system (QTEST HIFINITY 5). The operation was carried out at a frequency of 165 Hz in AC mode and without bias light during the measurement. For the maximum power point tracing for the aging test, an LED, whose spectral region is from 350 nm to 780 nm was used as the continuous photo-source. The light intensity was calibrated by the current of the device with a mask (a defined active area is 0.07 cm−2) reading from a Keithley 2400 source measure unit, which was consistent with that under irradiation under a xenon lamp of one sun. A commercial software was used for tracing the changing of the maximum power point of the device in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Perovskite film characterization
The photo-luminescence spectrum (PL) and transient fluorescence spectrum (TRPL) were measured using a Fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, England), with the excitation laser wavelength at 405 nm. The ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS) measurements were recorded using a UPS system with a VG Scienta R3000 analyzer in an ultrahigh vacuum under the pressure of 1 × 10−10 mbar. The monochromatized He Iα irradiation was performed with a discharged lamp with a photon energy of 21.22 eV supplied.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired from a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8020)
