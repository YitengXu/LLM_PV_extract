    , Accepted 21st April 2016First published on 25th April 2016AbstractUtilizing indacenodithiophene (D) and quinoxaline (A) building blocks, novel D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers of PIDT-DTQ-TT were designed with a conjugated π spacer of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit in the polymer backbone. In contrast to PIDT-DTQ with the thiophene unit as the spacer, PIDT-DTQ-TT displayed a much broader absorption with suitable HOMO energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Also an enhanced Jsc of 12.43 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.83 V comparable to that of PIDT-DTQ-based devices were observed in PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells, indicating that the balance between Jsc and Voc in devices can be achieved when the spacer in the polymer backbone was altered individually in D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers. Finally, a maximum power conversion efficiency value of 6.63% was achieved without any post-treatment in solar cells. Our results here demonstrate that tuning the conjugated spacers in D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers individually could be an efficient method to balance the trade-off between Jsc and Voc, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic performance in solar cells.
1. Introduction
In recent years, bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost, light weight and potential flexibility in large area applications.1–3 Currently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value up to 10% in PSCs was achieved.4–8 However, although significant progress was made, PSCs still exhibit an inferior photovoltaic performance in contrast to their inorganic counterparts. Therefore, better development of molecular design is still needed to enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In general, three key factors are considered very important in developing high performance polymeric donor materials: (1) a broad and strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions to obtain a high short circuit current (Jsc); (2) matched energy levels with those of acceptor materials to ensure efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface and also to obtain a high open circuit voltage (Voc); and (3) high charge carrier mobility to facilitate exciton diffusion and separation.9 As demonstrated, one of the most efficient strategies to obtain these “ideal” polymers with broad and strong absorption, matched energy levels and high charge carrier mobility is combining a suitable electron-rich moiety (D) and electron-deficient moiety (A) in the polymer backbone.10–13 Utilizing the above method, Sun et al. presented a novel D–A type alternating copolymer named PDBT-T1, leading to a high performance PSC with an impressive PCE value up to 9.7%.14 On the other hand, in order to enhance the photovoltaic properties of PSCs further, conjugated π spacers, such as thiophene,15 bithiophene16 and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,17 were often inserted in the polymer backbone to afford D–π–A–π type alternating copolymers (Fig. 1). For instance, by employing the building blocks of thiophene, bithiophene and terthiophene as conjugated π spacers between the electron-rich moiety unit of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and the electron-deficient moiety unit of isoindigo in the polymer backbone, Wang et al. synthesized D–π–A–π type polymers of PBDTTIT and PBDT-BTI as well as PBDT-TTI and found that the conjugated π spacers in the polymer backbone could affect the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells significantly.18
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the conjugated π spacer in the D–π–A–π type alternating copolymers and D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers. 
However, although the utilization of a conjugated π spacer in D–A type alternating copolymers is beneficial to achieve high performance PSCs, it is worth noting that the widely used conjugated π spacers were usually flanked to the D or A units to afford D–π–A–π type polymers (Fig. 1),19–21 indicating that the alteration of π-spacers in the polymer backbone must be a double-variation, which usually raise their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels seriously with a large sacrifice of the Voc value in solar cells. Finally, an un-balanced Jsc value (enhanced parameters) and Voc value (decreased parameters) in PSCs are observed. For example, by employing furan and bithiophene units as the conjugated π spacers, our group obtained D–π–A–π type alternating copolymers of PBDTT-FQ and PBDTT-BTQ recently. It is observed that when furan was flanked to the quinoxaline unit, the resulting polymer PBDTT-FQ displayed a PCE value of 4.3% with a Voc of 0.91 V and a Jsc of 9.10 mA cm−2 in its corresponding solar cells. However, when the double variation from furan to bithiophene in the backbone was employed, the PCE value decreased to be 3.5% for PBDTT-BTQ because of a lower Voc caused by its mismatched HOMO energy levels, although an enhanced Jsc value in solar cells with a much broader absorption and increased hole mobility was achieved for PBDTT-BTQ.22 Therefore, a gain in the PCE value of solar cells can be expected only if a decrease of Voc can be avoided when Jsc in solar cells was enhanced due to the existence of the trade-off between the light harvesting efficiency (Jsc) and energy levels (Voc).23
Recently, our group constructed a novel D–A–A type regular terpolymer of PIDT-DTQ by utilizing the indacenodithiophene (IDT) and quinoxaline building blocks as D and A units, respectively, and found that the conjugated π spacers can be inserted individually in this D–A–A structured backbone to obtain D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers.24 As observed for the D–A–π–A type terpolymers (Fig. 1), the alteration of π-spacers in the polymer backbone is just a single variation, which is very important to achieve comparable HOMO energy levels when the light harvesting properties were improved. Then, the balanced trade-off between Jsc and Voc could be expected. Hence, based on the above consideration, the thiophene unit in PIDT-DTQ is changed to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit here to afford one novel D–A–π–A type terpolymer named PIDT-DTQ-TT. In contrast to PIDT-DTQ, polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT displayed a much broader absorption and higher hole mobility with a comparable HOMO energy level. To investigate the effect of conjugated π spacers on the photovoltaic performance of solar cells, BHJ polymer solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al were also fabricated and as anticipated, a balanced Jsc and Voc is achieved for the PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells with an enhanced Jsc value of 12.43 mA cm−2 and a comparable Voc of 0.83 V in contrast to that of PIDT-DTQ-based solar cells, leading to an increased PCE value up to 6.63%. Our result here indicates that the construction of D–A–π–A type terpolymers is one efficient and facile method to balance the trade-off between light harvesting efficiency (Jsc) and energy levels (Voc), and then further enhance the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich, Acros, TCI) and used without further purification unless stated otherwise. Polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT was synthesized according to the literature24 and the detailed synthesis of polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT is outlined in the ESI.†
2.2. Characterization and measurements
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 using CDCl3 as the solvent. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a Bruker Bifiex III MALDI TOF. The average molecular weight and poly-dispersity index (PDI) were determined by using a Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatograph using THF as an eluant and polystyrene as a standard. UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lamada 25 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Q200 Instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded with a three electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode. The thin films on the Pt disk, formed by drop-casting the molecule solution in chloroform (analytical reagent, 10 mg mL−1), were used as the working electrode. Surface morphologies were recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco-DI Multimode NS-3D apparatus in a tapping mode under normal air conditions at room temperature.
2.3. Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
The photovoltaic cells were constructed with a traditional sandwich structure through the following steps. Firstly, the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a series of ultrasonic treatments in acetone, following by deionized water, and then 2-propanol each for 10 min. The substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and subjected to the treatment of Ar/O2 plasma for 5 min. Secondly, a filtered aqueous solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Bayer AG) was spun-cast onto the ITO surface at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min to form a PEDOT:PSS thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. Thirdly, a blend solution of polymers and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter and spun cast at 2000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The substrates were dried under N2 at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled glove-box. The devices were completed after thermal deposition of a 10 nm calcium and 100 nm aluminum film as the cathode at a pressure of 6 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was 0.1 cm2 for each cell. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded by using a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200; Tencor Instruments).
Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 91160, 300 W). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by using a computer-controlled Keithley 2602 source measurement unit in the dark. The PCE was recorded under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with an Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp) and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a mono-crystalline silicon diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a source meter, a silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
2.4. Measurement of charge carrier mobility by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was utilized here to measure the charge carrier mobility of PIDT-DTQ-TT by fabricating the transistors with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The SCLC can be approximated by the Mott–Gurney equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ (V d−3),25 in which J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of active layers (100 nm for PIDT-DTQ-TT), V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential resulting from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and thermal properties
The molecular structures of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT are outlined in Scheme 1 and the detailed synthetic procedures of monomers and polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT are shown in the ESI.† Similar to polymer PIDT-DTQ, PIDT-DTQ-TT is also prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization with a good solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and ODCB. As listed in Table 1, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PIDT-DTQ-TT is measured to be 20 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.3 by GPC.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was also carried out to investigate the thermal stability of PIDT-DTQ-TT and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As displayed, good thermal properties with a 5% weight loss observed at 474 °C were obtained for PIDT-DTQ-TT (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Meanwhile, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of PIDT-DTQ-TT was also conducted. Unfortunately, no distinct endothermic peak and exothermic peak were observed during the heating and cooling processes (Fig. S1b, ESI†).
3.2. Optical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of PIDT-DTQ-TT in chloroform solution and thin solid films. To fully compare the optical properties of D–A–π–A type terpolymers, absorption of PIDT-DTQ is also displayed here. As depicted, similar absorption spectra are observed for both PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT with two obvious absorption peaks in a broad range, in which the high-lying region from 400 to 480 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition and the low-lying region from 480 to 720 nm is assigned to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the IDT unit (D) and quinoxaline (A) building block.26,27 However, in contrast to PIDT-DTQ, polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in the backbone exhibited a much broader absorption because of its much planar molecular structure and strong electron-donating properties, indicating that employing a suitable π spacer could improve the absorption properties of polymers significantly. On the other hand, owing to the rigid and extended conjugated polymer backbone of both PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT, an obviously significant red-shift absorption profile was observed from solutions to their thin solid films, implying the intense π–π stacking in film states.28 Also the extinction coefficients of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT in thin films are measured here to fully investigate the influence of conjugated π spacers on the light absorption properties of D–A–π–A polymers (Fig. S2, ESI†). As observed, an absorption coefficient of 5.2 × 104 cm−1 was obtained for PIDT-DTQ thin films,24 however, when the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene building block was employed in PIDT-DTQ-TT, an increased extinction coefficient value up to 5.46 × 104 cm−1 was achieved, which further indicates that tuning the conjugated π spacer in D–A–π–A polymers can improve their light absorption properties significantly, thus leading to an enhanced Jsc value in PSCs. Additionally, the band-gaps of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT are also calculated from the absorption onsets in film states and the corresponding data are listed in Table 2.

3.3. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also carried out here to investigate the electrochemical properties of PIDT-DTQ-TT. The data are illustrated and summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 2. As is known, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) can be calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the onset reduction potential (Ered) according to the equations:29EHOMO (eV) = −(Eox + 4.8)ELUMO (eV) = −(Ered + 4.8)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT thin films on the Pt electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6, CH3CN solution (inset: cyclic voltammograms of the Fc/Fc+ couple). 
Therefore, the resulting EHOMO/ELUMO values of PIDT-DTQ-TT are calculated to be −5.29 eV/−3.27 eV. As displayed, suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels were observed for PIDT-DTQ-TT, indicating that this newly developed polymer can be used as the donor material in solar cells when PC61BM or PC71BM was employed as the acceptor material. On the other hand, the EHOMO/ELUMO values of PIDT-DTQ are determined to be −5.33 eV/−3.29 eV (ref. 24) and as observed, similar EHOMO/ELUMO values were achieved for PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT, although altered conjugated spacers of thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units with different electron-donating properties were inserted in the polymer backbone. The results here demonstrate that the alteration of conjugated spacers individually in the D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers is an efficient strategy to control their electrochemical properties, which is much more difficult for the widely developed D–π–A–π type copolymers.
3.4. Photovoltaic performance
Bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al to study the photovoltaic properties of PIDT-DTQ-TT. The solvent to prepare the active layer in devices is determined to be ODCB primarily. Meanwhile, as the D/A ratios could affect the performance of solar cells seriously,30 the ratio of polymer PIDT-DTQ-TT to PC71BM is also optimized carefully here and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on PIDT-DTQ-TT at different blending ratios with PC71BM are displayed in Fig. 4a and Table 3. As is shown, PIDT-DTQ-based solar cells exhibited a Jsc of 11.42 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V and a FF of 65.77%, leading to a PCE value of 6.41%.24 However, when the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer was inserted in the polymer backbone, an enhanced Jsc of 12.43 mA cm−2 was achieved for PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells, and much more importantly, an open voltage up to 0.83 V is also obtained simultaneously, which is similar to that of PIDT-DTQ-based cells, indicating that a balanced Jsc and Voc was observed by constructing D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers with one conjugated spacer. Finally, a maximum PCE value up to 6.63% was achieved in PIDT-DTQ-TT-based PSCs. Meanwhile, unlike the PIDT-DTQ-based solar cells, this PCE value is obtained without any post-treatment, which is also good for the reproduction and commercial application. In addition, owing to the fact that PC71BM and the conjugated polymers (PIDT-DTQ-TT) can be aggregated to form bi-continuous interpenetrating networks to facilitate the transport of both holes and electrons, a high content of PC71BM in the active layers with a D/A ratio of 1:5 is used here. On the other hand, to fully compare the photovoltaic properties of polymer PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT, a comparison of OPV results at the same blending ratio (PIDT-DTQ-TT:PC71BM 1:5 vs. PIDT-DTQ:PC71BM 1:5) was also carried out. As displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), an improved Jsc level and an improved Voc value are observed simultaneously, which further confirmed that constructing D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers and tuning the conjugated spacers individually could be an efficient method to balance the trade-off between Jsc and Voc in contrast to that of D–π–A–π type polymers. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the energy loss (Eloss) defined as Eg − eVoc is one of the main reasons for their inferior photovoltaic performance in PSCs31,32 and most of the efficient PSCs have an Eloss value of 0.7–0.8 eV. In this case, an Eloss value of 0.77 eV is obtained for PIDT-DTQ-TT based solar cells, indicating that building the D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers could be an efficient way to obtain high performance solar cells.

In order to further investigate the photovoltaic performance of PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs were also measured. As shown in Fig. 5a, a broad response region from 300 to 750 nm is observed for PIDT-DTQ-TT, which is similar to its UV-Vis absorption spectra, and when the D/A ratio is 1:5, a higher EQE value is available for PIDT-DTQ-TT, which is also much higher than that of PIDT-DTQ-based solar cells under the optimized conditions (Fig. 5b), finally leading to enhanced Jsc and PCE values in solar cells.

3.5. Morphology study and charge carrier mobility
To understand the difference in the photovoltaic properties of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT in PSCs further, the morphology of the blend films of PIDT-DTQ and PIDT-DTQ-TT with PC71BM under the optimized conditions was analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, PIDT-DTQ based blending films exhibited a homogeneous morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.51 nm.24 However, as anticipated, in contrast to that of PIDT-DTQ-based blending films, a much ordered morphology with nano-fibrils was achieved for PIDT-DTQ-TT with a RMS value of 0.87 nm when the planar thieno[3,2-b]thiophene building block was employed, which is very important to form the channels for the transport of both holes and electrons, finally leading to enhanced Jsc values and PCE values in polymer solar cells.33

Fig. 7a presents the J–V curves of hole-only PIDT-DTQ-TT-based transistors and their corresponding hole mobility is listed in Table 3. According to the above Mott–Gurney equation, the hole mobility is calculated to be 4.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIDT-DTQ-TT. It is worth noting that PIDT-DTQ-TT-based blending films also displayed high electron mobility up to 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such high and balanced charge carrier mobility is also one of the reasons for the high photovoltaic performance of PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells.34

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers of PIDT-DTQ-TT were synthesized with a conjugated π spacer of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. In contrast to PIDT-DTQ, a comparable HOMO energy level was observed for PIDT-DTQ-TT with much broader absorption spectra covering from 320 to 750 nm, leading to a comparable Voc of 0.83 V and an enhanced Jsc of 12.43 mA cm−2 in solar cells. Finally a maximum PCE value up to 6.63% was achieved for PIDT-DTQ-TT-based PSCs. This work indicated that building D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers and tuning the inserting spacer individually is an efficient approach to control the balance between light harvesting efficiency (Jsc) and energy levels (Voc), thus resulting in improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
