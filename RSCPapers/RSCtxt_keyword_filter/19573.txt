    , Accepted 29th May 2018First published on 31st May 2018AbstractYolk–shell nanocages possessing complex internal structure and excellent structural tenability are advantageous for the preparation of advanced catalysts. Due to outstanding features such as superior electrical, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties, non-noble metal materials with hollow nanostructures have been considered potential substitutes for highly active and stable abundant noble-metal electrocatalysts. In this study, the as-prepared CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages were applied in both dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Due to the remarkable structural features and advantageous chemical compositions, CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages comprising tiny crystals possessed large surface area (161 m2 g−1), well-defined interior voids, excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity. The DSSC with CoS2–C@CoS2 achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.32% under AM 1.5 G irradiation, and it outperformed the DSSC with Pt (8.24%). Besides, CoS2–C@CoS2 as a kind of HER catalyst also exhibited a low onset overpotential of 19.0 mV, small Tafel slope of 51.9 mV dec−1 and low overpotential of 79.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4).
Introduction
In recent years, owing to gradual depletion of fossil fuels, human society is facing environmental issues and energy crisis.1 The development of new energy from solar, hydrogen, wind and geothermal energy has become essential.2–4 With regard to potential applications, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are good alternatives for the direct use and development of solar energy in replacing conventional fossil fuels and compensating for the shortage of energy resources in the 21st century.5 DSSCs, as an ideal option for clean energy, are considered because of their low cost, pollution-free/simple manufacturing process and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).6–10 A representative DSSC device, generally containing a dye-loaded TiO2 photoanode, a counter electrode (CE) and a triiodide/iodide redox electrolyte, exhibits the structure of a “sandwich”.11–14 Platinum (Pt) possesses remarkable conductivity and high catalytic performance and thus, it is an excellent CE electrocatalytic material for DSSCs.15 However, the supply of Pt is limited, and it is expensive; thus, researchers have been seeking new non-precious metals as alternatives. On the other hand, the production of hydrogen energy through water electrolysis has also become a key technology for solving the energy crisis.16 Hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) also require good catalysts for replacing Pt and its alloys.17–19
With the surging demand for exploring new CE materials in DSSCs,20–22 the materials possessing hollow nanostructures with large surface areas and unique structural feature transitions such as Co9S8,23 CoS,24 CoS2,11 Co3S4,25 Ni–Co–S,26 Co–Fe–S,27 NiS28 and NiS2 (ref. 29) have been investigated. In HERs, there are many available electrocatalytic materials such as transition metal-based sulfides,30 selenides,31 nitrides32 and carbides.33 As a typical transition metal sulfide material, CoS2, because of its low cost, high chemical stability and excellent electrocatalytic performance, has been considered as a promising electrocatalyst.34–38 Unfortunately, the activity of CoS2 is limited by poor electrical conductivity and serious aggregation. Recently, it was reported that the catalytic activity of CoS2 could be significantly improved by combining CoS2 with carbon-based conductive materials to form CoS2–C-based hybrid materials, which can improve the conductivity of CoS2 and prevent CoS2 from aggregating.39 To date, there have been few reports on the synergetic effects of the CoS2–C system for electrocatalytic reactions. In addition, the unique and fascinating process of synthesizing multi-component nanomaterials with dual core–shell structures remains a challenge. The morphology of the material influences the performance of the catalyst.40 Compared with ordinary nanoparticles, nano-materials have special internal cavity structures that provide greater specific surface areas; therefore, they usually have the advantages of low density, large specific surface area and abundant internal storage space.41,42 For instance, Yang et al. succeeded in preparing nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur co-doped hollow carbon shells.43
Herein, we report the stepwise and controllable synthesis of hierarchical CoS2–carbon nanocages (CoS2–C@CoS2) composed of a CoS2 shell that is wrapped around a CoS2-doped porous carbon core; the synthesis includes three successive strictly controlled sulfidation processes (refluxing with thioacetamide, annealing with S powder and a further solvothermal reaction with thioacetamide), and a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) is used as the template. CoS2–C@CoS2 has a yolk–shell mesoporous structure and a high specific surface area of 161 m2 g−1 with a small average size of 600 nm. As more active sites are exposed, it exhibits higher catalytic activity with a high PCE of 9.32% under AM 1.5 G irradiation in DSSCs. Besides, CoS2–C@CoS2 as a kind of HER catalyst also exhibits a low onset overpotential of 19.0 mV, small Tafel slope of 51.9 mV dec−1 and low overpotential of 79.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4). Furthermore, CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages have also shown good electrochemical stability. In addition, CoS–C@CoS and CoS/CoS2–C as reference samples have been synthesized by refluxing with thioacetamide for different durations and annealing with/without S powder. Moreover, amorphous CoS (a-CoS) has been prepared through a direct hydrothermal method as another reference sample.
Experimental
Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, AR), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, 98.0%), thioacetamide (C2H5NS, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥98.0%), sulfur powder (S, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥99.5%), ethylenediamine (H2NCH2CH2NH2, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥99.0%), Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 wt%) and commercial Pt/C (Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd, 20 wt%) were utilized directly without any purification process. The deionized water used during the entire experiment was completely purified through a Millipore system.
Synthesis of ZIF-67 nanocrystals
Typically, 1.16 g (4 mmol) of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 1.31 g (16 mmol) of 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in 100 mL methanol, separately. The two solutions were then mixed quickly with vigorous stirring and aged at room temperature for 24 hours. Next, the purple precipitate was washed by centrifugation with absolute methanol several times and dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 12 hours. Ultimately, we obtained ZIF-67 nanocrystals.
Synthesis of CoS–C@CoS yolk–shell nanocages
In a typical synthesis, 0.160 g of the as-prepared ZIF-67 nanocrystals was dispersed in 200 mL methanol, followed by the addition of 0.720 g thioacetamide under reflux at 85 °C for 10 minutes. After being washed with methanol several times, the dark precipitate (denoted as ZIF-67@CoS) was dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum. Then, to obtain CoS–C@CoS yolk–shell nanocages, the prepared ZIF-67@CoS and S powder in a mass ratio of 1/2 were transferred to a porcelain boat and heated at 500 °C for 2 hours with a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1 in Ar atmosphere.
Synthesis of CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages
The as-prepared CoS–C@CoS (40 mg) and 80 mg of thioacetamide were dispersed in 40 mL methanol under magnetic stirring for 15 minutes. After adding 1.3 mL ethylenediamine dropwise with stirring, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 20 hours. The final product was dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum before being centrifuged and washed with methanol.
Synthesis of CoS/CoS2–C hollow nanocages
ZIF-67 nanocrystals (0.160 g) were dispersed in 200 mL methanol, followed by adding 0.720 g of thioacetamide under reflux at 85 °C for 2 hours. After being washed with methanol several times, the black precipitate was dried at 50 °C overnight under vacuum. Then, the sample was heated at 500 °C for 2 hours with a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1 in Ar atmosphere.
Synthesis of a-CoS
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (0.582 g, 2 mmol) and 0.301 g (4 mmol) thioacetamide were dispersed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing 40 mL deionized water and stirred for 15 minutes. After adding 1.3 mL ethylenediamine with stirring, the mixture was precipitated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and then, it was dried at 50 °C under vacuum.
Characterizations and measurements
The morphologies and microstructures of the as-obtained samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, TECNAI, G2F20, FEI) with elemental mapping and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The crystalline structures of these samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, Cu-Kα, λ = 0.15406 nm) at a rate of 5° min−1 in the range of 20–75°. The chemical composition and the valence states of these samples were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS, ESCALAB 250, Mg-Kα, USA). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared samples were measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020M, USA) to demonstrate the specific surface area and pore size distributions.44
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out on the CHI660E electro-chemical workstation. The representative photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs were tested via a standard solar light simulator (Oriel 94023A, AAA Class, Newport Corp.) under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) irradiation verified by a standard silicon solar cell (91150V, Newport Corp.).45 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization curves contained the same “sandwich-structured” CEs, which were implemented in symmetrical cells filled with the same electrolyte as in DSSCs.37 Bias voltage and AC amplitude of the EIS measurements were set in the ranges from 0 mV to 10 mV and 0.1 kHz to 100 kHz, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was tested at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the range from −0.6 V to 1.2 V with a three-electrode system in acetonitrile solution, which included 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 100 mM LiClO4. Concretely, a Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode (CE), an Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode (RE) and a catalyst-covered FTO glass was used as the working electrode (WE).
HER activities were evaluated by linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs). HERs were tested in acidic solution in the range from 1 V to 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution) at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an overpotential of 150 mV with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV.46 In our study, all the potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The potentials in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution were converted as follows: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 232 mV.
CE preparation
First, FTO glasses were pretreated with ultra-sonication cleaning using detergent, water, acetone and ethanol in that order for half an hour. Second, 0.1 g of the obtained samples was dispersed in 10 mL of absolute ethanol and then spin-coated thrice on a piece of the as-pretreated FTO glass at a rotating speed of 500 rpm for 16 seconds, and the coated FTO glass was placed in a drying oven at 70 °C for 10 minutes. As a result, the active loading capacity of the FTO glass with these samples was about 0.670 mg cm−2. Third, 20 mM of chloroplatinic acid in isopropanol solution was spin-coated on the FTO glass and then, the coated FTO glass was annealed at 400 °C in air for half an hour to fabricate Pt CE.
DSSC preparation
The “sandwich” structured DSSC consisted of a photoanode, an I3−/I− electrolyte and a counter electrode. The photoanode was prepared using the screen-printing method with a transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (thickness about 12 μm; particle size about 20 nm) and a TiO2 scattering layer (thickness about 12 μm; particle size about 20 nm) on the FTO glass.47 The photoanodes were soaked in 0.3 mM N719 dye solution in ethanol for 12 hours in the shade.48 At the end, the I3−/I−-based electrolyte was injected into the vacuum area between the photoanode and CE.49 The electrolyte contained 0.3 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile solution.50 The active area of the fabricated DSSC was limited to 0.160 cm2 using a metal mask.
HER measurements
In the CHI660E electrochemistry workstation, the catalytic performance measurements of HERs were conducted in a three-electrode electrochemical system comprising an Ag/AgCl electrode working as the RE, a graphite rod acting as the CE and a glass carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) loaded with samples working as the WE. The detailed method for preparing WE with catalysts was as follows: 2 mg of the as-prepared sample was dispersed in a mixture solution containing 40 μL Nafion solution, 365 μL deionized water and 95 μL absolute ethanol. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 minutes to form a remarkably homogeneous “ink”. Next, 5 μL of the “ink” was dropped onto a GCE. Then, the “ink” was dried at 40 °C for an hour to form an oil slick covering the GCE, which gave a catalyst loading of 0.261 mg cm−2. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was used as a reference.
Results and discussion
The synthetic process of CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. First, uniform ZIF-67 polyhedra were synthesized by a conventional precipitation method according to a previous report.51 In stage I, the S2− ions, released from thioacetamide (TAA) under reflux at 85 °C, combined with Co2+ ions on the surface of ZIF-67 polyhedron to form a CoS shell. This sulfidation process can be described as an anion exchange reaction. During the following annealing process, the inner ZIF-67 core was transformed to a CoS-doped carbon core (CoS–C) because of the presence of sulfur powder. Thus, a yolk–shell CoS–C@CoS was formed, as shown in stage II. At the end of stage III, CoS dispersed in the outer-shell and inner-yolk was converted to CoS2 nanoparticles simultaneously because of further sulfidation, which could be ascribed to the insertion of sulfur atoms. Notably, to obtain well-defined CoS2–C@CoS2 with a yolk–shell structure, common sulfidation was divided into two steps with the inclusion of an annealing process. Moreover, the ZIF-67 polyhedra played a dual role in the whole reaction, serving as template for the reactant and acting as the cobalt and carbon source.

To investigate the structural morphologies of the synthesized samples, SEM images were recorded for ZIF-67, CoS–C@CoS, CoS/CoS2–C and CoS2–C@CoS2. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the uniform ZIF-67 polyhedra exhibited smooth surfaces with an average size of about 500 nm.42 After refluxing with TAA for 10 minutes at 85 °C and subsequent annealing with sulfur powder at 500 °C, the ZIF-67 polyhedra were successfully converted to CoS–C@CoS, which exhibited slightly rougher surface and much rounder edge (Fig. 2c and d). Particularly, a broken CoS–C@CoS particle was observed, and this helped identify the presence of a yolk–shell structure (Fig. S1a, ESI†), which was consistent with the result of TLSEM in Fig. S1d.† As shown in Fig. 2e–g, CoS2–C@CoS2 inherited the yolk–shell structure of CoS–C@CoS but exhibited rough and sunken surface via further sulfuration. It was notable that numerous nanoparticles appeared on the surfaces of both shell and core (Fig. S1c†), which provided effective transport pathways for rapid electron transfer to enhance electrochemical kinetics.52 Moreover, CoS/CoS2–C hollow nanocages with brittle frames were synthesized through a relatively long-time sulfuration process for comparison (Fig. 2h, i and S1b†), and they did not exhibit the yolk–shell structure.

The interior morphologies and crystal structures of CoS2–C@CoS2 were investigated by TEM (Fig. 3). As displayed in Fig. 3a and b, the well-defined CoS2–C@CoS2 nanocage had extremely thin shell (dark line), and its thinnest section was estimated to be of several nanometers. In addition, numerous nanoparticles (dark dots) were observed on the shell and core, and this result was consistent with the result of SEM analysis. As shown in the high-resolution TEM images of CoS2–C@CoS2 (Fig. 3c), the lattice spacing of CoS2 (0.277 nm) corresponded to the (2 0 0) crystal plane of cubic CoS2, which matched the XRD analysis result.18 As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the EDX spectrum clearly indicated that CoS2–C@CoS2 was mainly composed of Co, S and C. The atomic percent of each element mentioned above is listed in the inset of Fig. S2.† In detail, the atomic percentages of cobalt, sulfur and carbon were calculated to be 8.15%, 17.46% and 74.39%, respectively. The EDX elemental mapping images of CoS2–C@CoS2 are shown in Fig. 3d, which demonstrate that the elements Co, S and C were uniformly distributed in the yolk–shell nanocages.53

Fig. 4 and S3 (ESI†) exhibit the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 4, several main diffraction peaks of CoS2–C@CoS2 observed at 27.9°, 32.3°, 36.2°, 40.0°, 46.3°, 55.0°, 60.2° and 62.7° corresponded to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 1 0), (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 3 0) and (3 2 1) planes of cubic CoS2 (ICDD PDF no. 00-041-1471).54,55 The main diffraction peaks of CoS–C@CoS at 30.6°, 35.3°, 47.0° 54.4° and 74.7° corresponded to the (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0) and (2 0 2) planes of hexagonal CoS (ICDD PDF no. 03-065-8977). Besides, the peaks of CoS/CoS2–C indicated simultaneous presence of hexagonal CoS and cubic CoS2. As shown in Fig. S3,† the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-synthesized ZIF-67 matched well with the previously reported results.11,42

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was applied to study the surface chemical species, chemical bonding states and the elemental components of CoS2–C@CoS2. As shown in Fig. 5a, the survey spectrum manifested the existence of Co, S, C, and O. Fig. 5b shows that the S 2p spectrum was split into four peaks. The peaks at lower B.E. at 161.7 eV and higher B.E. at 163.1 eV corresponded to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, which is the spin–orbit characteristic of S22−.11,57 The peaks at 164.9 eV and 168.6 eV were the satellite peaks (marked “Sat.”) of S, which matched the low and high oxide states, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5c, the Co 2p spectrum was split into four peaks, which included Co 2p3/2, Co 2p1/2 and two shake-up satellites. The peaks located at 781.2 and 797.1 eV were due to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively, which verified the existence of a Co–S bond of CoS2.11,58 The intense satellite peaks in the Co 2p spectra at about 785.9 eV and 802.8 eV were ascribed to the shakeup excitation of high-spin Co2+ ions in the samples. Therefore, it was observed that Co and S in Co–S alloy mainly expressed divalent states. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5d, the C 1s peaks were split into three peaks; the peaks were located at 284.6 eV, 285.3 eV and 289.1 eV, and they were ascribed to cobalt–carbon bonds.

To compare the specific surface area and pore size distribution, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained for the as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 6, typical IV curves with distinct hysteresis loops were obtained. Significantly, the adsorption curve of the isotherm was inconsistent with the desorption curve, suggesting that the posterior segment was raised again; the middle segment appeared to be adsorbed by the hysteresis loop, which corresponded to the system of capillary adsorption of the porous adsorbent. The specific surface area of CoS2–C@CoS2 was 161 m2 g−1, which was much larger than those of CoS/CoS2–C (13.9 m2 g−1), CoS–C@CoS (12.3 m2 g−1) and a-CoS (43.9 m2 g−1). Besides, the pore size distribution calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method revealed that these samples were mesoporous composites (Fig. S4a and b, Table S1, ESI†). The pore size of CoS2–C@CoS2 was mostly distributed around 2.18 nm and 4.90 nm, which also showed narrower pore size distribution than those of CoS/CoS2–C and CoS–C@CoS. The sample CoS2–C@CoS2 showed larger BJH desorption pore volume with a size of 0.322 m3 g−1, and the values were superior to those of CoS/CoS2–C (0.109 m3 g−1), CoS–C@CoS (0.081 m3 g−1) and a-CoS (0.153 m3 g−1). Based on the above-mentioned data, the increase in surface area and pore volume of CoS2–C@CoS2 could be ascribed to the coverage of CoS2 nanocrystals during the hydrothermal process. The sample CoS2–C@CoS2 with a mesoporous structure displayed high catalytic activities because of its large specific surface area, which favored the exposure of active sites and charge transportation in DSSCs and HERs.59–61

Photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) curves for DSSCs fabricated with CoS2–C@CoS2, CoS/CoS2–C, CoS–C@CoS, a-CoS and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. 7a. The corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. It was found that the corresponding PCEs of these DSSCs were in the order a-CoS (5.90%) < Pt (8.24%) < CoS–C@CoS (8.45%) < CoS/CoS2–C (8.85%) < CoS2–C@CoS2 (9.32%). Clearly, the DSSC with CoS2–C@CoS2-based CE demonstrated excellent photovoltaic parameters of PCE (9.32%), Jsc (17.8 mA cm−2) and Voc (791 mV), which were far more superior to those of Pt CE. The high fill factor (FF) and Jsc were due to the efficiently accelerated electrochemical process through the facilitation of the ion diffusion pathway of CEs.62 The remarkable PCE of DSSC assembled with CoS2–C@CoS2 demonstrated an ideal Pt-free CE for next-generation DSSCs. After 2000 CV cycles, CoS2–C@CoS2 exhibited almost less than 5% change in the J–V curve (Fig. S6, ESI†), proving that the material had a stable electrocatalytic performance in DSSCs. To further investigate the charge transfer process between the electrolyte and the CE interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed by preparing typical “sandwich” (CE/electrolyte/CE) cells. The plots of CEs and the related equivalent circuit diagram are shown in Fig. 7b, and the vital data are summarized in Table 2. The Rct values of CEs with the as-prepared samples were in the order a-CoS (4.39 Ω) > Pt (2.63 Ω) > CoS–C@CoS (1.50 Ω) > CoS/CoS2–C (0.844 Ω) > CoS2–C@CoS2 (0.722 Ω). Particularly, CoS2–C@CoS2 CE had the lowest Rct value due to the yolk–shell morphology, appropriate proportion of elements and largest specific surface area, which provided more nanochannels for charge transfer. Therefore, the above-mentioned analysis of EIS was consistent with that of J–V. Table S2 (ESI†) exhibits a comparison list of CoS2–C@CoS2 with other reported non-noble metal-based catalysts in DSSCs.

Tafel polarization curves of these samples are plotted in Fig. 8a, and the corresponding key parameters are elaborated in Table 2. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) is the intersection of the anodic branch with y axis, and the exchange current density (J0) is the slope for the anodic or cathodic branch.63,64Jlim determines the ionic diffusion coefficient, which is proportional to the carrier density.65,66 Moreover, higher values of Jlim and J0 indicate better catalytic activity. As shown in Table 2, the values of Jlim of these samples followed the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (1.98log (mA cm−2)) > CoS/CoS2–C (1.91log (mA cm−2)) > CoS–C@CoS (1.89log (mA cm−2)) > Pt (1.82log (mA cm−2)) > a-CoS (1.46log (mA cm−2)). Meanwhile, the values of J0 decreased in the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (0.667log (mA cm−2)) > CoS/CoS2–C (0.598log (mA cm−2)) > CoS–C@CoS (0.505log (mA cm−2)) > Pt (0.379log (mA cm−2)) > a-CoS (0.080log (mA cm−2)). The relationship between J0 and Rct obeyed the eqn (1) given below: J0 = RT/(nFRct)(1)here, T is the test temperature (298 K); Rct is the charge transfer resistance deduced from EIS; and R and F are the gas constant and Faraday's number, respectively.
 Fig. 8  (a) Tafel polarization curves, and (b) CV curves for I3−/I− redox couples at 50 mV s−1 scan rate with CoS2–C@CoS2, CoS/CoS2–C, CoS–C@CoS, a-CoS and Pt CEs. 
To explore the kinetics of the I3−/I− redox reaction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of these CEs were conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 8b, the CV curve consisted of two pairs of redox peaks (Red-1/Ox-1 and Red-2/Ox-2). The coupled peaks (Red-1/Ox-1) were consistent with eqn (2), and the other peaks (Red-2/Ox-2) corresponded to eqn (3).66,67 I3− + 2e− → 3I−(2) 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−(3)
The redox reaction of I3−/I− is the key to the overall catalytic process. The higher intensity of the cathodic peak current density (JRed-1) meant higher catalytic activity and reduction velocity for I3−. On the contrary, lower peak-to-peak separation (Epp) showed more positive correlation with the reversibility of the redox reaction. As shown in Table 2, the values of JRed-1 decreased in the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (2.98 mA cm−2) > CoS/CoS2–C (2.72 mA cm−2) > CoS–C@CoS (2.54 mA cm−2) > Pt (1.54 mA cm−2) > a-CoS (0.850 mA−2); meanwhile, the order of Epp values was CoS2–C@CoS2 (225 mV) < CoS/CoS2–C (263 mV) < CoS–C@CoS (285 mV) < Pt (338 mV) < a-CoS (379 mV). Clearly, the catalytic performance of CoS2–C@CoS2 was superior to those of the other materials and even Pt CE, and the results were consistent with the results of J–V and EIS analysis.
As shown in Fig. 9, the electrocatalytic performances of these samples for HER were measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.68 Commercial Pt/C was tested under the same condition. Fig. 9a shows the polarization curves with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for CoS2–C@CoS2, CoS/CoS2–C, CoS–C@CoS, a-CoS and Pt/C (20 wt%). Pt/C showed excellent HER performance with negligible overpotential, whereas CoS2–C@CoS2 exhibited slightly weak HER activity. The lower values of ηonset and η10 indicated higher electrocatalytic activities, as shown in Table 3.69 Evidently, the ηonset values (potentials at a current density of 1 mA cm−2)70,71 were in the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (19.0 mV) < CoS/CoS2–C (47.3 mV) < CoS–C@CoS (93.1 mV) < a-CoS (187 mV); this corresponded to the η10 values (potentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2),70,71 which were in the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (79.1 mV) < CoS/CoS2–C (118 mV) < CoS–C@CoS (196 mV) < a-CoS (308 mV). Interestingly, the as-synthesized CoS2–C@CoS2 showed higher catalytic activity than the other catalysts. To investigate the electrocatalytic kinetic performance of HERs, the corresponding Tafel plots (shown in Fig. 9b) were derived from LSV curves.72 The Tafel slope for Pt/C was 32.8 mV dec−1,73 whereas CoS2–C@CoS2 exhibited a relatively lower Tafel slope (51.9 mV dec−1) than CoS/CoS2–C (60.3 mV dec−1), CoS–C@CoS (77.6 mV dec−1) and a-CoS (101 mV dec−1). The Tafel slope was consistent with the corresponding Tafel equation: η = a + blogj(4)here, η is the overpotential, a is the Tafel constant, b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density.73 The values of the Tafel slopes (b) indicated that the HERs of all catalysts exhibited the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.71,74 As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the prepared CoS2–C@CoS2 was compared with other reported non-noble metal-based catalysts with respect to HER performances in acidic medium. To further illustrate the kinetics of the CoS2–C@CoS2 electrode, EIS data for CoS2–C@CoS2, CoS/CoS2–C, CoS–C@CoS, a-CoS and Pt/C are provided in Fig. 9c.73 The simplified equivalent circuit diagram is shown in the internal diagram of Fig. 9c, indicating that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values were in the order CoS2–C@CoS2 (22.6 Ω) < CoS/CoS2–C (58.2 Ω) < CoS–C@CoS (74.2 Ω) < a-CoS (262 Ω) (Table 3). The result suggested that CoS2–C@CoS2 had better electronic conductivity than CoS/CoS2–C, CoS–C@CoS and a-CoS because of highly efficient electron transport and favorable kinetics at the CoS2 nanoparticle/electrolyte interfaces in HERs.54,56 In practical applications, corrosion durability is another key factor for evaluating HER catalysts.72 Therefore, accelerated stability tests of the CoS2–C@CoS2 catalysts were conducted by continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) sweep at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. After 2000 CV cycles, there were almost no major changes in the polarization curve of CoS2–C@CoS2 (Fig. 9d), suggesting that the material had stable electrocatalytic properties in acidic HERs. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), SEM and TEM images of CoS2–C@CoS2 obtained after the HER test indicated that the material still maintained good appearance. The above-mentioned conclusions proved that the CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages possessed high catalytic performances for HERs. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), a continuous water electrolysis test was conducted at a constant current of 20 mA cm−2 for 120 min. The results clearly indicated that the value for the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER process could be acquired by dividing the measured amount of hydrogen with the theoretically calculated value (assuming 100% FE). Generally, faradaic losses might occur when heat or byproducts are generated in electrode reactions.75 As shown in Fig. S8,† the agreement between the calculated and measured values indicated that CoS2–C@CoS2 had an FE of nearly 100%.76

Conclusions
In conclusion, the hierarchical CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages composed of CoS2 shell and CoS2-doped carbon core were synthesized through three successive sulfidation processes (refluxing with thioacetamide, annealing with S powder and a solvothermal reaction with thioacetamide) using ZIF-67 as the template. The CoS2 shell contained numerous nanoparticles, which provided large surface areas (161 m2 g−1). The as-synthesized CoS2–C@CoS2 nanocages then acted as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both DSSCs and HERs in acidic medium, and they showed excellent catalytic activities. Due to their advantageous structural characteristics, the CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages showed superior PCE of 9.32% in DSSCs, which was much higher than that of Pt (8.24%). Meanwhile, the CoS2–C@CoS2 yolk–shell nanocages also exhibited low onset overpotential (∼19 mV) and small Tafel slope (∼51.9 mV dec−1) as HER catalysts in acidic medium. This effective stepwise and controllable synthetic method can be extended to the preparation of more advanced electrochemical catalysts in the field of energy conversion by adjusting crystal structures and surface morphologies.
