    , Accepted 8th February 2017First published on 10th February 2017AbstractThe rational design of high performance hetero-structure photovoltaic devices requires a full understanding of the photoinduced charge transfer mechanism and kinetics at the interface of heterojunctions. In this paper, we intelligently fabricated p-BiOBr/n-CdS heterojunctions with perfect nanosheet arrays by using a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction and chemical bath deposition methods at low temperature. A BiOBr/CdS heterojunction based solar cell has been fabricated which exhibited enhanced photovoltaic responses. Assisted by the surface photovoltage (SPV), transient photovoltage (TPV) and Kelvin probe technique, the photoinduced charge transfer dynamics on the BiOBr nanosheet and p-BiOBr/n-CdS interface were systematically investigated. It was found that the BiOBr/CdS nanosheet array heterojunctions were more efficient in facilitating charge carrier separation than both bare BiOBr and CdS films. The mechanism underlying the photoinduced charge carrier transfer behaviour was unravelled by allying the energy band of BiOBr/CdS p–n junctions from both the interfacial electric field and surface electric field. In addition, the CdS loading thickness in the p-BiOBr/n-CdS heterojunction and the incident wavelength affected greatly the transfer behavior of photoinduced charges, which was of great value for design of photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, where X = I, Br, or Cl) have recently gained attention due to their optimal optical, catalytic and electrical properties with potential applications in biomedicine,1 pigments,2 catalysis,3 and gas sensors.4 Belonging to groups V–VI–VII, ternary semiconductor compounds BiOX have a tetragonal matlockite structure and layered crystalline structures containing the [X–Bi–O–Bi–X] slice joined together by van der Waals interactions through X atoms in the c-axis direction.5,6 In each layer of [X–Bi–O–Bi–X], one Bi atom is surrounded by 4 O and 4 X atoms, resulting in an asymmetric decahedral structure. Such layered crystalline structures have been demonstrated to be favourable to form a built-in static electric field, which can promote the separation and transport of photogenerated charge carriers.7,8 Bismuth oxyhalides have been shown to exhibit photovoltaic response,9 however the photoelectrochemical properties of bismuth oxyhalide films have not been well characterized. The lack of research into these films may be attributed to the low photoelectric conversion efficiency of bismuth oxyhalides such as BiOI.10 Heterostructure construction is one promising method which can be used to improve photovoltaic performances.11–13 To increase the conversion efficiency of BiOI, Zhang et al. synthesized BiOI/TiO214 and BiOI/Bi2S315 heterostructure films. Among bismuth oxyhalides, bismuth oxybromine (BiOBr) has garnered considerable interest as a result of its relatively high chemical stability and superior photocatalytic properties.16 However, the wide band gap (Eg = 2.90 eV) and fast recombination rate of photogenerated electrons/holes inevitably decrease the absorption efficiency of visible light and limit their potential application.17,18 To increase the utilization efficiency of visible light and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers of BiOBr, strategies such as controllable preparation,19 elemental doping,20 and fabrication of heterojunctions such as Cu2S,21 Bi2S3,15 graphene,22 and Bi2MoO623 have been applied. Several studies have demonstrated the photocatalytic abilities of BiOBr-based heterostructures. To our best knowledge, however, the studies regarding the photovoltaic properties of bare BiOBr films and BiOBr-based heterostructures are very limited. More importantly, the properties and the photogenerated charge dynamics (e.g., transport direction, lifetime and separation efficiency) of BiOBr-based heterostructures have not been investigated. The effect of the interfacial electric field (EF) caused by the differences between the Fermi levels of semiconductors has not been previously considered, thus a full understanding of the BiOBr-based heterojunction is highly required to describe the photoelectric mechanisms. The surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) are well-recognized techniques often used for analysing the behaviour of photo-induced charge carriers, which can allow for the characterization of photoinduced charge transfer and their dynamics in nanomaterials.24–26
CdS, an n-type direct band gap semiconductor (Eg = 2.3 eV), has been often used to increase the visible light response of semiconductors with a wide band gap27,28 and can provide a promising material for photovoltaic applications. Inspired by this concept, heterostructures formed between n-type CdS and p-type BiOBr may help improve the visible light absorption efficiency of BiOBr and facilitate the separation and transport of photoinduced charge carriers in BiOBr/CdS films, as well as decrease the recombination possibility and enhance the photovoltaic performance. In the present work, novel p-BiOBr/n-CdS heterojunction nanosheet arrays were prepared by direct deposition on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) at room temperature by a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) with a chemical bath deposition method (CBD) at 60 °C.14,27 The BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films were used as working electrodes to construct photovoltaic cells. The SPV and TPV technologies were employed to study the transfer process of interfacial charges. We selected BiOBr/CdS heterostructures as a model to explore the photogenerated charge carrier behavior of BiOX-based heterostructures. A better understanding of the interfacial charge transfer mechanism in the BiOBr/CdS heterostructures and the correlation with the PEC performance will assist with tailoring efficient QD-sensitized bismuth oxyhalide heterostructures.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Potassium bromide (KBr), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S), and cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (P.R. China). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. Deionized water was used for all experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of the BiOBr/CdS heterojunctions
The BiOBr nanosheet films were deposited directly onto FTO substrates (10 Ω per square) through a modified SILAR method.15 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (5 mM) and KBr solutions (5 mM) were dissolved separately in glass beakers with H2O. The pre-treated FTO was immersed into the Bi(NO3)3 solution to absorb Bi3+ and NO3− ions. Following a rinsing step with water, the ions with weak adsorption were rinsed to leave a strong adsorption ion layer for reaction with Br− ions in the following step. These immersion and washing processes were operated in 4 beakers for 10 s. The DI water was refreshed after five cycles. After repeating for 40 cycles, BiOBr nanosheet array films were dried at room temperature. CdS nanoparticles (NPs) were deposited on the BiOBr nanosheet array surface through chemical bath deposition. An ammonia solution (1 M), 1 mM CdCl2·2.5H2O, and 5 mM thiourea were dissolved. The as-prepared BiOBr nanosheet array film was then immersed in the CdS precursor solution and heated in a water bath at 60 °C for different times from 5 to 30 min. The resulting products were denoted as BiOBr/CdS-t, where t represents the deposition time (t = 5, 10, 15, 20, 30). After deposition of CdS, the nanosheet array was rinsed with H2O and annealed in N2 at 200 °C for 2 h. For comparison, pure CdS control films were prepared by the same procedures.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer) was employed to characterize the crystal structure of the prepared thin films using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with the following operating parameters: λ = 1.5418 Å, work power set to 40 mA and 40 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction were obtained using a Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). Prior to TEM analysis, the samples were scraped on the FTO, re-dispersed in ethanol with ultrasonication, and then dropped onto carbon coated copper grids. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000).
SPV spectra were recorded using a homemade apparatus. The system consisted of a light source (monochromatic light), an SR830 lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA), a sample chamber and a data processing system. Monochromatic light was supplied by a xenon lamp (500 W) coupled with a Zolix monochromator (SBP500), which was chopped wave (23 Hz) with intensity controlled using xenon lamp spectral energy distribution. In photovoltaic devices, FTO coated with BiOBr, BiOBr/CdS or CdS films acted as the bottom electrodes. Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates acted as the top electrode and a mica spacer was placed between these two electrodes. Transient photovoltage (TPV) spectra were obtained as previously reported by Wang and coworkers.29 A sandwich-like structure was constructed by using the sample, mica and ITO substrate for all the TPV tests. The homemade TPV apparatus was composed of a light source, splitting prism, digital oscilloscope, shielding box and reflector. The samples were excited with a laser radiation pulse (355 nm or 532 nm) from a third harmonic Nd:YAG laser. The transient surface photovoltage signal was processed by using a TDS 3054C digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, Tektronix). The SPV and TPV measurements were carried out under an air atmosphere at room temperature. Work function measurements were conducted by using a KP6500 scanning Kelvin probe system. The diameter and the work function of the gold reference probe were 1.8 mm and 5.1 eV, respectively. The contact potential difference (CPD) between the gold reference probe and the prepared film was tested in the dark. All the measurements were conducted under ambient conditions.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CHI-660B electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co.) in a three-electrode system, in which a Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. EIS signals were recorded under the setting: AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV, the frequency range from 105 to 0.01 Hz at 0 V. The photovoltaic cells were constructed by using BiOBr and CdS or BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films as working electrodes and using sputtered Pt/FTO as the counter electrode. The redox electrolyte contained 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M DMPII, and 0.5 M 4-TBP in 3-methoxy acrylonitrile.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fabrication of BiOBr/CdS heterojunctions
The morphology of the synthesized BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS films has been examined by SEM. The typical morphology of the as-prepared BiOBr films prepared by the SILAR method for 40 circles was observed to be uniformly and wholly covered with the BiOBr nanosheets on the FTO substrate (Fig. 1a inset). The image at higher magnification (Fig. 1a) shows that the BiOBr film consisted of nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 30 nm and grew directly from the substrate. The BiOBr/CdS heterojunction structures were constructed by deposition of CdS on the BiOBr surface with a CBD method. The BiOBr/CdS-20 composite exhibited a typical morphology similar to that of the pure BiOBr (Fig. 1b). The CdS NPs were observed to be homogeneously coated on the BiOBr nanosheet. The average thickness of the BiOBr/CdS-20 nanosheet was calculated to be approx. 50 nm, which consequently gave a thickness of a CdS NP layer of about 10 nm. The profile SEM image showed that the thickness of a BiOBr/CdS-20 heterojunction film was ca. 540 nm (Fig. 1c), compared to the thicknesses of the FTO layer of ca. 370 nm. The thickness and surface roughness of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction nanosheets were dependent on the immersion time. A longer time (from 5 min to 30 min) resulted in a thicker structure with a rougher surface (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1d shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films. In the spectra of pure BiOBr, the diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 11.0°, 25.3°, 31.8°, 32.3°, 46.4°, and 57.3°, were characteristic of the crystal planes of (001), (101), (102), (110), (200) and (212), respectively, indicating the formation of BiOBr (JCPDS 09-0393). In all spectra, the other diffraction peaks labeled with asterisks were derived from FTO (JCPDS 41-1445). The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films were similar to those of BiOBr, indicating that the deposition of the CdS NPs did not significantly influence the crystal structure or lattice structure of BiOBr. However, the peak intensity of BiOBr (001) decreased with an increase in CdS QD content, which was due to the CdS NPs gradually covering the surface of BiOBr. However, no crystalline CdS can be detected from the BiOBr/CdS heterojunction film with the small particle size and small CdS QD concentrations. The presence of CdS NPs was further confirmed by HRTEM and EDS analyses. The XRD pattern and SEM image for the pure CdS film are displayed in Fig. S2 and S3,† the dominant diffraction peaks were detected and are in good agreement with CdS (JCPDS 41-1049).

To further investigate the morphology and structure of BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS, we performed TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 2). These results showed clearly the CdS NP covered BiOBr nanosheet structure. Combining with the SEM result (Fig. 1b), it can be figured out that the BiOBr/CdS nanosheet surface was completely covered by aggregation of dense CdS NPs rather than continuous thin films. The resolved lattice fringes with a distance d of 0.27 nm and an angle of 90° can be assigned to the (110) plane (Fig. 2b). As depicted in Fig. 2a inset, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) showed a typical lattice pattern, suggesting the single-crystalline structure of BiOBr nanosheets. The angle between the diffraction vectors with labeled spots is 45°, which is characteristic theoretically of the angle value between the (200) and (110) facets of tetragonal BiOBr. This indicates that the crystal zone axis is aligned in the [001] direction. The HRTEM images of the BiOBr/CdS composite are shown in Fig. 2c and d. In contrast to pure BiOBr, the ED pattern of BiOBr/CdS shows that the diffraction spots are superimposed on the rings (Fig. 2c inset), suggestive of the formation of BiOBr/CdS with a polycrystalline structure. The d-space value of 0.34 nm of the lattice fringe further confirmed the fact that the densely covered NPs are CdS (Fig. 2d). This spacing can be indexed to the (002) facet of CdS, which was in agreement with the XRD results. In addition, the composition of the thin film was analyzed by EDS (Fig. 2e), the results verified the existence of Bi, O, Br, Cd, and S, with a molar ratio of Cd/S ≈ 1.05. The results from the HRTEM and EDS analyses indicate that the BiOBr/CdS heterojunction nanosheet array films were successfully synthesized using facile low temperature methods.

(f) UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra of the pure BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra obtained from the BiOBr nanosheet array, pure CdS, and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films are shown in Fig. 2f. The as-prepared BiOBr nanosheet array displayed an absorption edge at ca. 410 nm, while the CdS film exhibited the absorption onset at 550 nm. The absorption edge of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films red-shifted compared with the pure BiOBr film, this may be due to the fact that CdS NPs as the sensitizer deposited on BiOBr nanosheets extended the optical response. The absorbance was enhanced in the wavelength range of 410–550 nm with the formation of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films. The absorption edge of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films was observed to gradually extend to 550 nm for BiOBr/CdS-30. These results may be caused by the relatively narrow band gap of CdS of 2.3 eV, which allows for absorption of higher amounts of visible light. The enhanced visible light response of the heterojunction films may result in more production of photo-induced charge carriers and consequently improve the photovoltaic performance. However, excessive loading of CdS NPs causing aggregation on the BiOBr nanosheet may be unfavorable for photovoltaic properties.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study the separation efficiency of interface charges between photo-induced holes and electrons. In the Nyquist plot of EIS, a smaller arc radius indicated a higher efficiency for both interfacial charge transfer and photo-induced charge carriers’ separation.30 The diameter of the semicircle became considerably shorter when the CdS NP layer was deposited on the BiOBr nanosheet surface (Fig. 3). In addition, the BiOBr/CdS-20 heterojunction film electrodes exhibited the smallest arc radius among those BiOBr/CdS heterojunction film electrodes (insert in Fig. 3), which suggests that the highest efficiency of photo-induced electron–hole pairs separation and the fastest interfacial charge transfer occurred on BiOBr/CdS-20 electrodes.

3.2. Photovoltaic properties
For investigation of the electron transfer properties and light harvesting efficiency, we used BiOBr and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films as photoanodes to fabricate photoelectrochemical cells and their photovoltaic properties were evaluated by the current density–voltage (I–V) responses (Fig. 4). The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Isc), and fill factor (FF) have been calculated to be 0.2 V, 0.72 mA cm−2, and 0.25, respectively, for the pure BiOBr based solar cell using an I−/I3− redox electrolyte under irradiation with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G). In the case of BiOBr/CdS-10, the photovoltaic performance was improved with the increase of Voc (3 times greater than the Voc of the bare BiOBr-based solar cell). Upon increasing the immersion time of BiOBr in the CdS precursor solution to 20 min, the power conversion efficiency (η), Isc, Voc, and fill factor (FF) of the BiOBr/CdS-20 heterojunction films were measured to be 1.26%, 4.74 mA cm−2, 0.6 V, and 0.44, respectively, which may be considered the optimal photovoltaic properties for these heterojunction films. When the immersion time was extended to 30 min, the photovoltaic performance decreased gradually (Table 1). This reduction of performance may be attributed to the excessive loading of CdS NP aggregates on the BiOBr nanosheet, which may result in the formation of a barrier for charge transfer to reduce the interfacial charge transfer, providing more active centers for the electron and hole recombination, and consequently reducing the lifetime of the photon-induced carriers. We have tested the stability of a BiOBr/CdS-20 photochemical cell against irradiation, which indicated that their photovoltaic properties were relatively stable under continuous irradiation with simulated sunlight (Fig. S4 and Table S1†).

3.3. Photoinduced charge carrier transfer behavior of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films
SPV is a powerful method for evaluating the separation and transfer of photo-induced charge carriers on surfaces and at interfaces. When semiconductors were illuminated with light having photon energy equivalent to their band gap energy, excess electrons and holes were produced by the band-to-band transition. The separation of excess photo-induced charge carriers will lead to an increased SPV signal. The SPV spectra of pure BiOBr, CdS, and BiOBr/CdS heterostructure films irradiated with monochromatic light from the front or back side and the corresponding SPV phase spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The irradiation direction was changed to analyze the charge transfer process in samples. For a pure BiOBr nanosheet film, the top of a valence band (VB) is dominated by Br 4p and O 2p, and the conduction band (CB) was determined by Bi 6p and O 2p.31 The SPV response is produced by the electron transition from the Br 4p to Bi 6p orbital of BiOBr under illumination, leading to generation of holes and electrons.32,33 The SPV and the corresponding phase spectra of the pure BiOBr nanosheet film from back side illumination show the typical broad response band from 320 to 410 nm (Fig. 5c), which corresponds to the absorption spectra of the pure BiOBr film (Fig. 2f). The SPV phase value was located from −90 to 0° (Fig. 5d), which suggests that the photoexcited electrons transferred to the surface of the BiOBr film while photo-induced holes moved to the irradiation side (the FTO substrates). This is due to the fact that p-type BiOBr, the p-type nature of BiOBr was also confirmed by the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S5†) and Hall effect analysis (Table S2†), has a downward surface band bending and a surface electric field (EF) with the direction from the BiOBr surface to the interior. However, the SPV signal of the pure BiOBr nanosheet film with front side illumination exhibited two response peaks at 320–360 nm and 360–410 nm (Fig. 5a), and the corresponding SPV phase spectra contain a discontinuity and shift ca. 180° at 360 nm (Fig. 5b), indicating that the transport directions of photo-induced charges at λ < 360 nm and λ > 360 nm were opposite. The incident light at a wavelength larger than 360 nm has a longer penetrating depth thus probably reaching the interface of the BiOBr nanosheet and FTO substrate. At the interface of BiOBr and FTO, the corresponding SPV signal was caused by the interfacial electric field (EF) when irradiated with light (λ > 360 nm). The transfer direction of photo-induced charge carriers caused by interfacial EF and surface EF is opposite. For a bare CdS film, the SPV response occurred in the region of 320 to 520 nm, and only one SPV response peak was detected regardless of the direction of the incident light (back side or front side). The phase values of the CdS film from front side and back side illumination were ca. −40° and 135°, respectively, which suggests that holes moved to the n-type CdS surface and the electrons moved to the FTO substrate side under the action of the surface EF. After CdS NP deposition, the SPV responses of the BiOBr/CdS heterostructure films were enhanced significantly. The photovoltage signal was highly dependent on the loading thickness of CdS NPs. With the increasing loading time of CdS NPs from 5 min to 20 min, the SPV signal intensity increased gradually accompanied by a widening responsive range. The BiOBr/CdS-20 heterostructure film shows the maximum value for both signal intensity and response range from 310 nm to 700 nm. Further extending the loading time to 30 min, the SPV signal was decreased sharply, maybe due to the excessive loading of CdS NPs which acted as a charge transfer barrier (Fig. 5a). These results were consistent with the above current density–voltage (I–V) curves of BiOBr/CdS heterostructure films.

(Inset) Schematic diagram of SPV measurement configurations for samples. 
In order to understand the highly efficient photocurrent responses and photoinduced charge carrier transfer behavior of BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films, we have measured the work functions of BiOBr and CdS films via a contact potential difference (CPD) technique using a Kelvin probe (Fig. S6†). The work functions of BiOBr and CdS were determined to be 5.08 eV and 4.85 eV, respectively. The position distributions of the CB, VB and Fermi level of BiOBr and CdS were illustrated (Fig. S6† inset). The CB and VB of p-type BiOBr (0.25 and 3.10 eV, vs. NHE) were lower than that of the n-type CdS (−0.57 and 1.68 eV, vs. NHE),34–36 suggesting a unique band structure of p–n heterojunctions. When BiOBr was in contact with CdS, electrons in the CB of CdS would transfer into BiOBr and produce an interfacial EF in the direction from CdS towards BiOBr. The energy bands and Fermi levels increased for BiOBr while decreased for CdS NPs until a new equilibrium was achieved. The directions of interfacial EF and surface EF and the incident light wavelength affect greatly the photoinduced charge transfer process of BiOBr/CdS interfaces (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the transfer mechanism of photogenerated electrons and holes for BiOBr/CdS-5 and BiOBr/CdS-10 heterostructure films from front side illuminations. The interfacial EF promotes the separation of photoinduced charge carriers in BiOBr irradiated with light above 360 nm, but the photo-excited electrons were insufficient to migrate to the CB of CdS because of the energy barrier height formed between CdS and BiOBr, which resulted in accumulation of photogenerated electrons at the interface. At the same time, photogenerated holes in the valence band of CdS will flow into the interface, leaving electrons in the CB of CdS and holes in the VB of BiOBr, respectively, which is similar to the Z-scheme mechanism of the n–n heterojunction.37 Therefore, a net accumulation of photoinduced electrons at the irradiation side (λ > 360 nm) corresponds to the phase values of BiOBr/CdS-5 and BiOBr/CdS-10 heterostructure films (ca. 135° and 180°) at λ > 360 nm (Fig. 5b). When the incident light wavelength was decreased, the penetrating depth of incident light decreased. The surface EF of CdS dominated charge separation at λ < 360 nm, which generated a positive SPV response, corresponding to the phase values of ca. 0° and −90° (Fig. 5b). The phase values of BiOBr/CdS-5 and BiOBr/CdS-10 heterostructure films from back side illumination fell in the value range from 60° to −60° at a wavelength of 300–600 nm (Fig. 5d), suggesting that photoinduced holes accumulated at the FTO substrate side. This SPV response is directed by the surface EF (BiOBr) and interface EF concurrently, and the direction of interface EF is parallel to that of the surface EF (Fig. 6c). When the penetrated distance of the incident light was less than the thickness of the outer semiconductor, the incident light could not easily reach the interface of the two semiconductors.38 For BiOBr/CdS-15 and BiOBr/CdS-20 heterostructure films with illumination from the front side, BiOBr cannot be photo-excited to generate a SPV response; only CdS was excited at λ > 400 nm when more CdS NPs deposited on the surface of the BiOBr nanosheets. The SPV response in the visible region suggests that the electrons were injected quickly into BiOBr nanosheets followed by transporting to the FTO substrate, and leaving positive charges in the VB of CdS. At λ < 400 nm, photoinduced holes also transfer to the CdS surface under the surface EF, resulting in a positive response of the SPV signal, and the corresponding SPV phases have values in the range of −90 to 0° (300 nm < λ < 600 nm). The transfer mechanism of photoinduced charges is depicted in Fig. 6b. The SPV phase values of BiOBr/CdS-15 and BiOBr/CdS-20 heterostructure films were all in the range of 0 to 90° at λ < 400 nm for the films from the FTO substrate with side illumination (Fig. 5d). These results may be attributed to the surface EF of BiOBr dominated charge separation at λ < 400 nm, which caused the photo-induced holes to move to the FTO substrate (Fig. 6d). In addition, the phase values shifted to 135° at λ > 400 nm (Fig. 5d), suggesting that the photo-induced electrons moved to the FTO substrate side at the interface EF (Fig. 6d). For the BiOBr/CdS-30 heterostructure films, the SPV phase value of BiOBr/CdS-30 heterostructure films was nearly equal to the SPV phase value of the pure CdS film, indicating that the photo-generated holes moved to the surface of the CdS film and the electrons moved to the FTO substrate by the surface EF.

TPV is an important technique to study the dynamic information of photo-generated charge carriers. This technique can provide direct evidence on photo-induced charge carriers for their generation, separation, transport and recombination. The TPV responses of the pure BiOBr and CdS thin films on the FTO substrate were also measured (Fig. S7†). The transient photovoltage signal under 355 nm light illumination was found to be negative for the BiOBr thin film, but positive for the CdS film. A negative photovoltage response suggests that electrons accumulated at the film surface, while a positive value indicates hole accumulation at the surface. The transient photovoltages of various BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films with irradiation from the front side are shown in Fig. 7. Compared with the laser pulse irradiation, the transient photo-voltage signals have obvious retardation. The results showed that the separation of electron–hole pairs occurred with a retardation of ca. 60 ns after irradiation for all films. Here, we define an equation Tt/Tr = L for clarifying the TPV measurement,39 where Tt is the time the concentration of the photoinduced charge carrier reached the maximum; Tr is the time the photoinduced carrier completely recombined; and L is a ratio in the range of 0 to 1, a smaller value of L means the faster transfer and longer lifetime of the photogenerated carrier. We summarized the values of Tt, Tr and L for different thin films in Table 2. The results indicated that the combination of BiOBr and CdS could efficiently improve the separation and lifetime of charge carriers compared with pure BiOBr or CdS thin films. For example, BiOBr/CdS-20 has the smallest L value (9.5 × 10−4) among the BiOBr/CdS heterostructures, suggestive of the fastest separation and longest lifetime of charge carriers. However, the L value of BiOBr/CdS-30 increased dramatically, which may be due to the excessive loading of CdS NPs covered on the BiOBr nanosheet surface forming an interfacial charge transfer barrier from CdS to BiOBr, thus accelerating the recombination of carriers. This trend is in remarkable agreement with the photovoltaic performance of a BiOBr/CdS-20 based solar cell. From above discussions, it can be concluded that the enhanced photovoltaic properties of the BiOBr/CdS p–n junctions may be correlated with the efficient separation, faster transfer and longer lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers in BiOBr/CdS heterojunction films.

4. Conclusions
Uniform BiOBr nanosheet arrays and BiOBr/CdS heterojunction nanosheet films have been fabricated through a facile method based on SILAR and CBD techniques. BiOBr/CdS heterojunctions exhibited significant increases in photo-current conversion efficiency which was dependent on the loading amount of CdS NPs. Using SPV and TPV techniques, we have investigated comparatively the photoinduced charge carrier kinetics of BiOBr, CdS and BiOBr/CdS nanosheet array heterojunction films. It was found that the separation efficiency of charge carriers was enhanced greatly in heterojunction films. More importantly, the results from SPV and TPV measurements demonstrated that the photogenerated charge transfer process was determined by the interfacial EF and surface EF of BiOBr and CdS NPs, and was strongly dependent on the CdS NP layer thickness and incident light wavelength. Both the interfacial EF and surface EF dominated the transport of photoinduced charge in the heterojunction with thinner CdS layers at λ > 360 nm, while the effect of interfacial EF became weak for the heterojunction with excessive CdS NPs. These results provide an effective avenue to fully understand the dynamics of photo-generated charge carrier generation, separation and transfer at heterojunction interfaces and will be of great value for heterojunction photovoltaic applications.
