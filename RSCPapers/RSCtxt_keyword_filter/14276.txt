    , Accepted 16th May 2018First published on 16th May 2018AbstractPoly(o-anthranilic acid) emeraldine salt (PANA-ES) as a conjugated semiconductor polymer has been synthesized in an acidic medium based oxidative polymerization route. The identification of the PANA-ES powder has been carried out using the following techniques: FT-IR and UV-Vis. SEM has been used to investigate the morphology of the resulting PANA-ES powder. The structural properties of the resulting nanostructured PANA-ES thin film have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis of the spectral behavior characteristics of the nanostructured PANA-ES thin film, in the absorption region, displayed a direct and indirect allowed transition, and the fundamental energy gaps were estimated as (1.89, 3.24 eV) and (2.35, 4.06 eV), respectively. A hybrid (polymer/inorganic) heterojunction device built on PANA-ES (deposited by the spin coating technique onto a p-Si single crystal wafer) was fabricated. The dark I–V characteristics were determined at different temperatures in the range from 298 to 386 K of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction diode. The device showed rectification behavior and an ideality factor of 85 at ±2 V and 3.229 determined at room temperature. Under the following different light intensities: 10.1, 15.3 and 20.5 W m−2, the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al showed photovoltaic performance data with a short circuit current (Isc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of (0.09 mA 1,41 mV), (0.16 mA, 176 mV) and (0.26 mA and 211 mV), respectively. The filling factor (FF) and electrical conversion efficiency (η) of the Au/n-PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device were found to be 0.205 and 6.07%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Conjugated semiconductor polymers have super properties such as lightweight, corrosion resistance, and flexibility of design. They have been widely applied in semiconductors as organic materials and in photoelectronic fields, based on their conjugated system.1–5 Polyaniline derivatives as semiconductor polymers have been attracting great attention due to their environmental stability and optoelectrical properties. Considerable notice, in both science and technology, has also been taken of polyaniline derivatives, as organic semiconductor materials for such applications as light emitting diodes (LED) and molecular electronic devices.6–12
Moreover, several conjugated polymers are also well-organized electron donors and sufficient hole transporters via their visible-light excitation. Therefore, conjugated polymers containing inorganic semiconductors are receiving more attention for optical, electronic, photocatalytic and photoelectric conversion applications13,14 and, in addition to their photocatalytic properties, are very suitable candidates for a universal scale inexpensive catalyst material; non-toxic, widely available and chemically stable. Poly(o-anthranilic acid) has a good optical and magnetic activity, strong electroactivity, variable conductivity, and thermal stability. Consequently, the fabrication of a PANA based nanocomposite is attracting attention as it can exhibit unresolved characteristics originating from the electrically conductive PANA film and metal/semiconducting nanoparticles.15–17
Various technologies such as electrode position,18 spin coating19 and thermal evaporation20 are capable of fabricating conjugated semiconductor polymer thin films. These fabrications and coatings are usually applied under specific conditions either by wet or dry techniques. One of these techniques is the spin coating technique. This technique produces a good adherent layer of nanocrystalline thin film with high homogeneity degree.21,22 By contrast, the transition of metal doped semiconducting polyaniline derivatives gave promising results in the electrical and optical properties, based on a combination of metals with polymers (respectively as inorganic and organic materials).23,24 Herein, a PANA-ES thin film was fabricated using a spin coating technique. The doping of PANA-ES with different transition metals was applied. Doped PANA-ES nanostructured thin films as a new hybrid material were used for the first time for solar cell applications. The electrical conduction mechanisms of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al diode were studied via its current–voltage characteristics in the dark, and at different temperatures in the range from 298 to 386 K. The photovoltaic properties of PANA-ES/p-Si heterojunction devices under different light intensities in the range from 10.1 to 20.5 W m−2 were studied. The as-synthesized PANA-ES polymer as a powder, PANA-ES thin film and new Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device exhibit thermal stability, semicrystalline nature, good optical properties, and high electronic performance. The high stability and PCE of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device was evaluated by using the FT-IR method, TGA, powder XRD and I–V properties under dark and illumination modes. It can be concluded that the new synthetic Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction solar cell is a promising candidate as an optoelectronic device.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were used without further purification: ortho anthranilic acid (Across Organics: Thermo Fisher Scientific), polyethylene glycol with molecular weight 200 (PEG200) (Shanghai Chemicals); ethanol (Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Aldrich), anhydrous ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid and acetic acid (Aldrich) were used as purchased. Single crystals of (p-Si) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Synthesis of the PANA-ES powder
5.48 g o-anthranilic acid was dissolved in 45 ml absolute ethanol. 2 ml PEG200 as a surfactant was added to the o-anthranilic acid ethanolic solution. Drops of conc. HCl were added to the o-anthranilic acid solution until the pH reached pH 0.15 under magnetic stirring (850 rpm) at room temperature. 80 ml (0.5 M) ferric chloride solution as an oxidizing agent was added drop by to the o-anthranilic acid solution under the previous conditions. The pH value of the resulting solution was found to be pH 0.45. The equimolar ratio between the monomer and initiator was applied. The resulting PANA-ES was left under magnetic stirring for an additional 12 hours and subsequently left overnight at room temperature. The resulting PANA-ES was washed with distilled water numerous times to remove the excess oxidizing agent, surfactant and unreacted species. The resulting PANA-ES was dried at 70 °C. The obtained yield of the PANA-ES was 82%.
2.3 Fabrication of the Au/PANA-ES /p-Si/Al heterojunction device.
The Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device was fabricated according to the reported method in ref. 4, 23 and 25. A PANA-ES solution was deposited on the surface of a polished p-type single crystal Si wafer. The dimensions of the p-Si wafer are typically 50.8 mm × 0.5 mm (cubic crystalline with boron as a dopant; a = 5.4037 Å). To remove the native formed oxides on the surface of p-Si, the substrate was immersed in CP4 solution (CH3COOH:HNO3:HF, molar ratio 1:3:1 of the purification solution, respectively) for 10 s, then washed with bi-distilled water, and dried. The back surface of the Si wafer was coated by a thick aluminum electrode. Accumulation of PANA-ES thin film (200 nm thickness) on the p-Si (i.e. etched front surface) was deposited by using a spin coating technique. A network gold electrode was thermally deposited on the PANA-ES thin film. Au and Al as an electrode were used based on their mechanically stable Ohmic contacts with the PANA-ES and Si, respectively. Both the Al and Au films were vaporized independently using sputter deposition. The effective cross-sectional area of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al diode is 0.36 cm2. The Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction diode construction can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 FT-IR spectra of the PANA-ES thin film

Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectrum of the PANA-ES thin film. The infrared spectrum displayed absorption bands at 3050–3420, 1300–1400, 830–860 and 666–751 cm−1, corresponding to hydroxide group (OH) stretching, bending, rocking and wagging vibrations respectively, due to the presence of water molecules. The ν(C–N) vibration appeared at 1160.02 cm−1 with a transmittance of 85.71%. The ν(NH) vibration was displayed at 3400.99 cm−1. This confirms that the polymerization was carried out through the –NH group, in the FTIR spectrum (transmittance 88.67%), supporting the presence of (CH–NH–CH–) functionality in the PANA-ES thin film structure. This is responsible for the absorption in the visible region and supports n-type conductivity of the PANA-ES polymer film nanostructure. The presence of a carboxylic group also appears at (2857–2965 cm−1; O–H stretch), (1732 cm−1; CO stretch), (1395 cm−1; –C–O–H in plane bending), and (961 cm−1; O–H bending out of plane). The strong band at 1160 cm−1 is a characteristic of PANA (doped with chloride ion). The spectrum of the PANA-ES thin film has two major absorption peaks at 1617 and 1536 cm−1 which can be ascribed to the CC vibrations of quinoid and benzenoid units, respectively. Based on the previous results, the suggested PANA-ES thin film backbone can be represented as shown in Fig. 3. The FTIR spectral characteristics demonstrate the different kinds of functionality in the molecular system of the PANA-ES thin film.

3.2 Thermal analysis of the PANA-ES powder
Thermogravimetric analysis TGA and DrTGA curves of the PANA-ES powder were studied as shown in Fig. 4. From the figure, it can be observed that decomposition of the PANA-ES powder takes place within four thermal stages. The first stage is within the range of 25–141.25 °C, due to removal of moisture molecules existing between the polymer chains. The second stage, within the range of 141.25–262 °C, can be attributed to the removal of HCl and CO2 which results from the decomposition of the dopant emeraldine salt and carboxylic group respectively. The third stage is within the range of 262–635 °C, corresponding to the thermo-oxidative decomposition of the polymer chains. This step is not dependent on the atmosphere and occurs in the same temperature range in air and in a nitrogen atmosphere.26 Finally, the fourth stage is within the temperature range of 635–838 °C, and represents the remaining part resulting from carbonization of the polymer where the thermal decomposition was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.

3.3 SEM of the PANA-ES powder
The surface morphology and particle size of the PANA-ES film were investigated using SEM as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The SEM images show that the as-synthesized PANA-ES powder is uniform and flat. Also, it is shown that the film morphology and texture vary with the top view magnifications. The size of the PANA-ES microstructure displays a magnificently discrete microscale polymer film. The resulting microparticles have a regular plate-like shape with an average diameter range of 0.79 μm. These microparticles are produced from the agglomeration of around 20–35 crystallites.

3.4 XRD study of the PANA-ES thin film

Fig. 6 shows the XRD pattern of the nanostructured PANA-ES thin film with a thickness of 200 nm. In this pattern many peaks were found at around 8.66°, 9.88°, 11.49°, 17.11°, 18.92°, 20.88° and 27.7°, corresponding to the semi-crystalline nature of the PANA-ES film.27 The Bragg diffraction of PANA-ES has many non-sharp peaks, indicating that the PANA-ES film has a semicrystalline nature with a triclinic structure. The lattice parameters of the PANA-ES film are: a = 9.981, b = 10.895 and c = 11.563 Å while α = 80.86°, β = 87.60° and, γ = 88.64° (by using the CRYSTALSLEUTH software program and database_code_amcsd 0006127).28 The semicrystalline form of the PANA-ES layer is generally derived from the intermolecular interaction between the PANA-ES chains and well-organized bonding of hydrogen.29 The Scherrer equation was used to detect the nano scale dimension of the fabricated PANA-ES thin film layer: D = kλ/βcosθ, where D is the average crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, k is the proportionality constant (k = 0.9) and β is the full width at a half maximum of the peak (FWHM),30 as listed in Table 2. The broader diffraction peak was observed. This means that the larger (β) value gives a smaller crystallite size. The calculated average crystallite size of the PANA-ES film layer was found to be about 22.20 nm.

3.5 Optical properties of the PANA-ES salt thin film
The UV-Vis optical absorption spectra of the nanostructured PANA-ES thin film of thickness 200 nm in the wavelength, λ, range from 200 to 1000 nm are shown in Fig. 7. The absorption spectrum of the fabricated PANA-ES film diminishes with increase of the wavelength. At a higher value wavelength (900–1000 nm), the film was nearly transparent. Moreover, the PANA-ES film showed two main absorption bands at 200 nm and 330–500 nm. In addition, the predominant absorption band for the examined film in the wavelength range from 320 to 500 nm was attributed to the presence of π–π* electronic transition at a high level of energy, which is the characteristic of a conjugated (CO) group.31
 Fig. 7  The absorbance spectra of the PANA-ES thin film (200 nm) at the room temperature. 
In the field of nanomaterials, semiconductors, and solar industries, the calculation of a material's energy gap is very important. The optical absorption spectrum can be applied to determine the electronic transition type and band gap for the considered film. The energy gap value of the PANA-ES film was determined using Tauc's formula:32 (1)where α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the allowed energy gap, and hν is photon energy. The constant B is known as the disorder factor, which is approximately self-determining based on the photon energy, and γ is a parameter representing the electronic transition type that is related to the distribution of the density of states. The value of γ is equal to 1/2 for allowed direct transition and 3/2 for forbidden direct transition; and 2 and 3 respectively in the cases of allowed and forbidden indirect transitions.
Acceptable allowed direct and indirect transition optical band gaps Eg for the PANA-ES thin film were recorded from the plot of (αhν)0.5 and (αhν)2 against hν as shown in Fig. 8. The existence of both (αhν)0.5 and (αhν)2 values of the optical band gap Eg is attributed to good fitting of the calculations. Thus, there are two optical energy gaps for the PANA-ES thin film. Eg1 and Eg2 (allowed direct and indirect transition) for fundamental energy gaps. The Eg of the PANA-ES thin film was gathered by extrapolating the straight line portion of (αhν)0.5 and (αhν)2 against hν graphs to zero hν-axis, as listed in Table 3.

Refractive index (n) is specific for a certain film, and its value characterizes the speed of light through it. The (n) values of the explored thin films were estimated from the reflectance (R) and absorption index (k) data, using the following equation:33 (2)Meanwhile, the extinction coefficient, k, is given by  as a function of both absorption coefficient α and the incident wavelength. The normal reflectance (R) for the absorbing materials is usually given by the following relation:34 (3)Fig. 9 displays the absorption and refractive index of the PANA-ES film as a function of λ (nm). From the figure, it can be noticed that n of the PANA-ES film expanded regularly with increasing wavelength especially at λ ≥ 370 nm (i.e. the absorption edge). Furthermore, the clear dispersion behavior can be realized in the PANA-ES film at higher wavelengths outside the absorption edge. In contrast, an opposite pattern in the absorption index, with increasing wavelength, was observed for the PANA-ES film, as listed in Table 3.

3.6 Dark electrical characteristics of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device
The (I–V–T) transport properties of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device were carried out in a temperature range of 298–368 K and presented in Fig. 10. As shown in the figure, the I–V curves comprise two unique districts: at low forward predisposition voltages (V ≤ 0.75 V), an exponential behavior due to the possession of the depletion region in the PANA-ES/p-Si interface; and at higher voltages (0.75 ≤ V ≤ 2 V), a straight locale behavior where the current is constrained by Ohm's law due to the high series resistance of the fabricated device. From the I–V data in the exponential region, both the ideality factor (n) and the reverse saturation current (I0) could be obtained. From the I–V graph the rectification ratio, RR, of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device was calculated at ±2 V bias voltage at various temperatures and recorded in Table 4. The values of the ideality factor (n) and barrier height (φb) were found to be more than the conventional semiconductor/metal devices.35,36 The significant importance in transport electrical performance in dark mode of the nanostructured polymer semiconductor material indicates its progressively extensive use as a hybrid polymer/inorganic device.37

The exponential performance of the n-PANA-ES/p-Si device was in the voltage range 0 ≤ V ≤ 0.75 V. Through this voltage range the exponential dependence is ascribed to the growth of the depletion region between the n-PANA-ES layer and p-Si substrate. The I–V–T characteristics described in Fig. 11, and the obtained current of the diode are given by the formula:38 (4)where I0, V and k are the reverse saturation current, the bias voltage, and Boltzmann's constant, respectively. Also, q, n and T are the electronic charge, the ideality factor and the temperature, respectively. Rs and Rsh are series and shunt resistances, respectively. Both Rs and Rsh represent main parameters of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device, in which Rs and Rsh are determined by plotting the diode junction resistance (Rj = ∂V/∂I, calculated from the I–V–T curves under dark conditions), against the biasing voltage (V).
 Fig. 11  Ln I–V characteristics of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction within the temperature range of 298–368 K. 
Plots of Rjvs. V under different temperatures are displayed in Fig. 12. The measurements exhibit high forward biasing voltage (Vf > 0.75 V), while the Rj reached steady state with a decrease in the fill factor of the diode. At high reverse bias, the junction resistance remains almost constant, which is equivalent to the shunt resistance (Rsh). At low temperatures the free carrier concentrations have disappeared with increasing Rs values.39 The obtained data for the Rs and Rsh resistances at various temperatures (i.e. 298 K to 368 K) are listed in Table 4.
 Fig. 12  A plot of Rj (kΩ) vs. (V) of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device within the temperature range of 298–368 K. 
The conduction mechanisms can be explained by I–V–T measurements. The forward current increments are exponentially at a low voltage range (V ≤ 0.75 V) with achievement of the analogous performance.40 Schottky barriers were organized and described utilizing a semiconductor (PANA-ES) with a (p-Si) wafer. The junction I–V correlation follows the thermionic emission formula:41,42 (5)where A, A* and φb are the effective area of the diode, Richardson constant (32 A cm−2 K−2 for free electrons) and barrier height of the diode, respectively. The term  represents the reverse saturation current I0.
The obtained I0 values at a temperature ranging from 298–368 K are estimated by extrapolating the linear bias forward voltage region (V ≤ 0.75 volt) to zero applied voltage, as shown in Table 4. The obtained I0 values at different temperatures are very low because of the dependence of electron–polaron hole–polaron pair generation and separation at the interface between the polymer layer and p-Si.
The n-PANA-ES layer alters the electrical transport properties of the p-Si substrate. The current of the fabricated n-PANA-ES/p-Si device is given by:41 (6)for V ≥ 3kT/q, and (V − IRs) corresponds to the bias voltage across the device under investigation.
Moreover, from the slope of the I–V–T curves, the ideality factor (n) of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction diode can be obtained by: (7)Both the n and φb values were determined from forward I–V–T measurements at different temperatures. With an increase of temperature, the ideality factor decreases from 3.229 to 1.103. The relatively high estimated values of the ideality factor (n > 3) might be ascribed to leakage, shunting, or series resistance.43–45
The estimated potential (φb) of the studied Au/n-PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction devices at different temperatures are shown in Table 4. The obtained values of φb are lower than those of an organic/inorganic diode (such as Ni/n-Si is 0.9 eV).43 This means that the potential barrier height values of the n-PANA-ES/p-Si interface are temperature dependent, whereby the increasing of the temperature creates a significant change in the work function of p-Si, leading to increasing of the φb value. The existence of the PANA-ES layer at the Au/p-Si interface leads to non-ideal I–V behavior. At higher forward biasing voltages V > 0.6, the obtained forward current at different temperatures is plotted on a double natural logarithmic scale as shown in Fig. 13. The resultant relation is linear, with a slope equal to 2.00 ± 0.03. The linear behavior is due to the effect of series resistance on the PANA-ES/p-Si device. This demonstrates that the predominant conduction mechanism in that voltage range is the space charge limited current (SCLC), controlled by a single energy trap level.38

3.7 Photovoltaic properties of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device
The I–V characteristics of the studied Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device at room temperature under various light intensities within the range of 10.1–20.5 W m−2 are shown in Fig. 14. It is clear that the obtained photocurrent increases with increase of both the light intensity level and the applied reverse biasing voltage. The drift velocity of photo-generated electrons and holes in the n-PANA-ES/p-Si device interface is the main reason for increasing the photocurrent (Iph), whereas the obtained value of the dark current Idark < Iph, displays the same reverse bias.

The absorption of light by both the p-Si and PANA-ES semiconductor layer creates electron–hole pairs and excitons, respectively. Moreover, at the PANA-ES/p-Si interface, excitons are separated into electron–hole pairs. The generated electrons in the PANA-ES semiconductor layer are transported toward the Au electrode, while the holes in p-Si are transported quickly and gathered by the Al electrode under the effect of applied voltage. The Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device under test has photovoltaic properties with increasing illumination. The photosensitivity (S) of the n-PANA-ES/p-Si heterojunction (S = Iph/Idark)VR = 0.7 V is measured at various light intensities of values 10.10, 15.3, and 20.5 W m−2 as 29, 37 and 47 respectively.
The photosensitivity (S) increases with increasing light intensity of the n-PANA-ES/p-Si device, since it can be used as a photodiode.
Finally, as can be observed from the power curves as shown in Fig. 15 and 16, the obtained results of both short circuit current, Isc, and open circuit voltage, Voc, of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device are 0.02588 mA and 211 mV, respectively.

The fill factor (FF) is calculated from the maximum output power by both the Voc and Isc.46 FF can also be interpreted graphically as the ratio of the rectangular areas shown in Fig. 14. (8)where Imp and Vmp are the current and voltage at the maximum power point as in Fig. 15. The electrical conversion efficiency (η) of the PANA-ES/p-Si diode is resolved from the formula given by:46 (9)where A is the effective area of Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al (A = 0.25 cm2) and Pin is the light intensity incident on the cell (ranged from 10.10 to 20.50 W m−2). The electrical conversion efficiency of the fabricated device was estimated without correcting for electrode absorption losses or reflection of light. The calculated values of FF and η under various light intensities were found to be 0.2051 and 6.07%, respectively. The crystallinity of the thin film is a factor affecting the performance of the photovoltaic behavior for the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device. The PANA-ES thin film is highly crystalline in nature. This crystallinity leads to a decreasing of the energy gap value, increasing the number of electron transfers and charge carrier transport. These three factors improved the performance of the photovoltaic behavior for the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device. Table 5 displays the obtained photovoltaic parameters of the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al solar cell. These results demonstrate that the emeraldine salt of poly(o-anthranilic acid) as a conjugated semiconductor polymer and the new Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al heterojunction device are reliable for application in real optoelectronic devices, heterojunction solar cells, and polymer solar cells.

4. Conclusions
Poly(o-anthranilic acid) emeraldine salt has been synthesized by an acidic medium based oxidative polymerization method. A poly(o-anthranilic acid) emeraldine salt thin film was fabricated by using a spin coating technique at room temperature. Dark current–voltage measurements were used to characterize the electrical parameters and conduction processes of a heterostructured Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device. The generation-recombination mechanism predominated through the fabricated diode (Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al) at a lower forward-bias voltage (V < 0.75 V). A rectification ratio RR of 85 at ±2 V at room temperature was obtained for the Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al diode. The space charge-limited current mechanism (SCLC) controlled the charge transport of the fabricate device at V > 0.75 V. The Au/PANA-ES/p-Si/Al device with an ideality factor of 3.229 does not behave ideally at room temperature. The electrical parameters of the fabricated diode (i.e. the ideality factor, series resistance and barrier height) are temperately dependent. Under illumination of 20.5 W m−2, the n-PANA-ES/p-Si heterostructure device shows a photovoltaic behavior at the value of both Voc of 0.211 V and Isc of 2.588 × 10−4 A. Based on the photovoltaic behavior of the diode, it can be used as a promising heterojunction solar cell with electrical parameters of fill factor 0.205 and conversion efficiency of 6.07%.
