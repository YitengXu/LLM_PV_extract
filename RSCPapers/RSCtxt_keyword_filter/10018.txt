    , Accepted 3rd March 2022First published on 8th March 2022AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted significant attention due to their excellent optical and electrical properties. However, intrinsic defects and poor carrier mobility remain two major concerns that limit the photoresponse of perovskite-based photodetectors. Here, a modified bromide-terminated Ti3C2 MXene nanoparticle (Br-MNP) decorating scheme is proposed to reduce macroscopic and microscopic defects and facilitates carrier transport. Specifically, Br-MNPs provide a Br-rich atmosphere to improve the crystallization process and compensate halide vacancies. Compared with the pristine film, the Br-MNP-mediated film exhibits an improved film morphology with enlarged vertical-oriented single grains, and possesses higher crystallinity with a reduced trap state density from 4.33 × 1015 cm−3 to 2.55 × 1015 cm−3. In addition, Br-MNPs acted as bridges between adjacent perovskite grains, which effectively accelerate carrier transport, leading to an enhanced carrier mobility of 0.210 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the Br-MNP mediated perovskite photodetector exhibits an improved photoresponse with a responsivity of 3.93 A W−1, a noise level below 1.26 pA Hz−1/2, and a short response time of less than 29.9 μs. An efficient underwater wireless optical communication system equipped with this device is also demonstrated, showing huge potential of such devices in practical applications.
Introduction
Photodetectors play an important role in a wide range of applications, such as optical communication, image sensing, environmental monitoring, biological detection, etc.1–4 Material quality and optical properties of the active region of a photodetector directly determine device performance.5–7 To date, commercial photodetectors mainly rely on group IV, III–V, and II–VI semiconductors, which involve complex manufacturing processes under strictly controlled conditions.8,9
The emerging organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites show great potential in optoelectronics, owing to their tunable bandgaps, long carrier lifetimes, high absorption coefficient, and long diffusion length.10 Although there is a rapid advance in perovskite-based photodetectors, their photoresponse is significantly limited by inherent defects and poor carrier transport characteristics of polycrystalline perovskite films.11,12 Specifically, anion vacancies and grain boundaries are two common defects in perovskite films, which severely affect the performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.13,14 Owing to the ionic nature of perovskites, they experience a quick nucleation process during growth, resulting in an intrinsic soft lattice framework with weak ionic bonding, e.g. rich iodide (I) vacancies.14 To date, numerous efforts have been devoted to reducing these defects. Paetzold et al. developed a dual passivation strategy of using a long-chain alkylammonium salt phenethylammonium chloride to passivate the grain boundaries and interface, resulting in an improved power conversion efficiency of 22% in solar cells.15 Yang et al. used n-butylammonium bromide solution to passivate the internal bulk defects and interface defects, and achieved a reduction of photovoltage loss by 0.1 V in solar cells.16 Moreover, Wang and coworkers reported stable solar cells with the interfacial embedding of fluorinated-gold-clusters, which enhanced carrier dynamics at grain boundaries.17 These strategies have effectively improved device performance, however, they focused only on the grain boundaries and ignored other types of defects, e.g. anion vacancies.
On the other hand, efficient carrier extraction and transport are critical in photodetectors. Employing two-dimensional (2D) materials, e.g., graphene, MoS2, fullerene, WS2, and black phosphorus, as the transporting channel has been considered as effective solutions to enhance the conductivity of the perovskite film and ultimately improve the carrier transport.18–21 Nevertheless, owing to the intrinsic nature of these 2D materials, they are not able to offer customized functional groups to address defects such as anion vacancies, grain boundaries, and interfacial defects. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a novel strategy that passivates both macroscopic and microscopic defects, as well as improves charge carrier extraction and transport.
It has been confirmed that the Br anion with a small radius exhibits a strong ionic bonding ability and good ion mobility, which are beneficial for defect passivation.22 Moreover, MXene (Mn+1AnTx), as a new 2D material family member, has excellent electrical and chemical properties.23 In addition, termination groups of MXenes can be manipulated, which is compatible with aforementioned Br anions.
Here, Br terminated MXene nanoparticles (Br-MNPs) were proposed to address issues related to various types of structural defects in perovskite films. With the help of Br-MNPs, the photoresponse of the as-fabricated photodetector was obviously improved. By blending Br-MNPs in perovskite photodetectors, Br anions effectively compensated the halide vacancies, and MNPs acted as bridges between adjacent perovskite grains. Accordingly, the non-radiative recombination was effectively suppressed, and the carrier extraction and transport became more efficient. As a result, the Br-MNP-optimized device exhibited a high responsivity (3.93 A W−1), a large linear dynamic range over 98 dB, and a fast response speed with a response time of 29.9 μs. Moreover, an underwater wireless optical communication system based on the modified photodetector was demonstrated, with a Baud rate of up to 128 kbit per s.
Results and discussion
Br-terminated Ti3C2 MXene nanoparticles (Br-MNPs) were synthesized via a combined molten-salt and hydrothermal method.24 As illustrated in Fig. 1a, multi-layered Ti3AlC2 (Fig. S1, ESI†) and CuBr2 molten salts were initially mixed using a mortar, followed by heating in a tube furnace. The products were subsequently washed and dried to obtain the exfoliated Ti3C2Br flake powders. Finally, high-quality Br-MNPs with an average diameter of ∼4 nm (Fig. 1b and c) were formed using a hydrothermal treatment.

Fig. 1d shows X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of as-prepared Br-MNPs. Notably, the core level of Al 2p (74.16 eV) from Ti3AlC2 disappeared after etching, indicating the formation of Ti3C2 MNPs. Additionally, a Br 3d peak (73.42 eV) was observed in Br-MNPs rather than Ti3AlC2, implying that the functional Br anions were successfully terminated on the surface of MNPs. In order to further confirm the ionic bonding in Br-MNPs, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were subsequently performed. Five characteristic peaks were clearly observed in the Raman profile (Fig. S2, ESI†), coinciding with previous studies.25,26 The corresponding FTIR spectra of as-synthesized Br-MNPs are shown in Fig. 1e. Two peaks centered at 466 and 800 cm−1 are assigned to Ti–C and Ti–O bonds, respectively, suggesting that Br-MNPs maintained the original structure of Ti3C2. It is worth noting there is an additional peak located at 594 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of the Ti–Br bond, indicating that the Br anions are successfully bound with Ti3C2, consistent with XPS results.27
To investigate the effect of the Br-MNPs on the performance of perovskite-based photodetectors, various amounts of Br-MNPs were blended into the triple-cation (Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) perovskite precursors labeled as CsFAMA. Notably, the amount of Br-MNPs injected was defined as the volume ratio of Br-MNP precursor to CsFAMA precursor. As suggested, a small quantity of MXene is beneficial for improving device performance.23,28,29Fig. 2a illustrates the device configuration of as-fabricated photodetectors, where SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD work as the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. The dark current measurements of pristine, 2% Br-MNPs, 3% Br-MNPs, and 4% Br-MNPs assisted perovskite photodetectors are shown in Fig. 2b. Among these devices, the 2% Br-MNP-treated photodetector exhibited the smallest dark current (230 nA) at −1 V bias, which was over 80% and 250% lower than that of pristine and 4% Br-MNP-modified devices, respectively. This significant reduction of the dark current can be attributed to the increased barrier height between the perovskite layer and ETL.

(c) Logarithmic I–V curve of the 2% MNP assisted photodetector measured under illumination with wavelengths of 405, 450 and 520 nm. (d) Time-dependent photoresponse as a function of light intensity under self-powered operation (520 nm laser diode). 
The photoresponse characteristics of each device were subsequently explored under different light illumination (405, 450 and 520 nm), as shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S3 (ESI†). All devices exhibited a distinct photoresponse, and a diode characteristic with an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V. Notably, the highest photocurrent (73 mA) was obtained in the 2% MNP-modified photodetector, implying an improved photon-electron conversion efficiency. The light intensity-dependent measurements under zero-bias were performed, as presented in Fig. 2d and Fig. S4 (ESI†). It is obvious that the photocurrent of three devices gradually increased with the increase of the light intensity, indicating a strong light intensity dependence. Specifically, the photocurrent of the 2% Br-MNP-modified devices increased from 5.05 nA to 2.3 mA, as the light intensity of a 520 nm laser diode increased from 500 nW cm−2 to 60 mW cm−2. The similar tendency was also observed in the pristine and 4% Br-MNP-assisted perovskite photodetectors, but lower photocurrent. Notably, the 2% Br-MNP-modified photodetectors demonstrated stable and reproducible switching cycles with an enhanced on–off ratio (Ion/Ioff) over 104. Accordingly, the introduction of an optimal amount of Br-MNPs into perovskites effectively improved the device performance.
To clarify the mechanisms of the improvement in device performance, further characterization studies were carried out. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pristine and 2% Br-MNP-modified perovskite thin films. Both films exhibited a compact and pinhole-free film morphology. After blending Br-MNPs, the treated film possessed larger grains with an average grain size of 498.8 nm than the pristine film (450.4 nm). The corresponding elemental mapping examined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). All elements were uniformly distributed along the film surface, especially Ti, confirming the incorporation of Br-MNPs. Apart from the increased grain size, the Br-MNP-optimized perovskite film showed a smoother surface, with a surface roughness reduced from 17.2 nm to 15.6 nm, measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). The cross-sectional SEM images of the pristine (Fig. 3a) and optimized (Fig. 3b) CsFAMA films suggested a similar thickness of ∼ 500 nm. Fig. 3c shows the corresponding elemental mapping images, which indicates a uniform distribution of Br-MNPs. It is worth noting that the Br-MNP assisted perovskite film possessed large vertically oriented grains along the perovskite layer, compared with the pristine perovskite film with both large and small grains. The large grains and highly-oriented perovskite films should be formed by the addition of Br-MNPs, which generated less nuclei, as a result of a retarded crystal growth. Moreover, such large grains are favorable for suppressing the non-radiative recombination and facilitating the charge transport.30,31

(i) PL spectra and the spatially-resolved mirco-PL mapping (inset). (j) PL decay curves of the as-prepared perovskite films. 
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to investigate the effect of the Br-MNPs on the structural properties of perovskite films (Fig. S8, ESI†). Each film exhibited almost the same characteristic peaks, indicating that the introduction of Br-MNPs did not interrupt the original crystal structure. Five characteristic peaks located at 14.8° (101), 20° (012), 28.4° (202), 31.84° (211), and 40.56° (024) in each sample are consistent with those in previous works.32–34 Notably, the (211) facet was obviously intensified in Br-MNP-modified CsFAMA film, implying enhanced crystallinity.
Subsequently, XPS measurements were performed to examine the electronic states of each element in the samples (Fig. 3d). Both the pristine and 2% Br-MNP-modified perovskite films showed similar characteristic peaks but a slight peak shift. To evaluate the interaction between Br-MNPs and CsFAMA, core levels of Pb 4f (Fig. 3e), I 3d (Fig. 3f), and Br 3d (Fig. 3g) in pristine films and Br-MNP-modified films were resolved. After blending Br-MNPs, the peak positions of both Pb 4f7/2 and Br 3d5/2 shifted to the higher binding energy, i.e., from 138.25 to 138.35 eV and from 68.28 to 68.38 eV, respectively. In contrast, I 3d5/2 peaks reversibly shifted to the lower binding energy from 619.06 to 618.92 eV. These shifts can be ascribed to the strong electron withdrawing properties of Br ions, which redistributed the electron cloud on the Pb2+ defect, and thus adjusted the binding energy of I and Br.22 As reported, the weak vibration of the inorganic lattice can inhibit the diffusion of some inherent defects, such as iodide vacancies and interstitial defects.35,36 Accordingly, the enhanced interaction between divalent cations (Pb2+) and halide anions (Br−) can regulate the dynamics of film growth, resulting in a more stabilized crystal structure.37 In addition, the FTIR results (Fig. S9, ESI†) show similar tensile vibrations in the Br-MNP-modified perovskite film, which validated a strong interaction between the perovskite and Br-MNPs, in good agreement with EDS and XPS results.
In order to gain more insights into the influence of blending Br-MNPs on the optical properties of perovskite films, UV-Vis, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were measured. As shown in Fig. 3h, both pristine and 2% Br-MNP-modified films possessed similar absorption spectra, with a bandgap of ∼1.62 eV determined by using Tauc plots (inset). In addition, the broader absorption spectra of other Br-MNP-modified perovskite films with different concentrations are shown in Fig. S10, ESI.†Fig. 3i shows their PL spectra, where the peak position of the treated film shifted from 763.1 to 758.8 nm. This blue shift was mainly attributed to the incorporated Br with a smaller radius compared to I.38 While, a significant quenching effect was observed, indicating an efficient charge transfer from perovskites to Br-MNPs.39 The corresponding spatially-resolved micro-PL mapping was recorded and is shown in the inset of Fig. 3i. Both films exhibited uniform emission along the amplified region, while the intensity was reduced in Br-MNP doped film, coinciding with the PL results. The carrier dynamics of as-prepared samples were subsequently explored by recording TRPL measurements (Fig. 3j). The typical decay curves were fitted by a bi-exponential decay function, with dual time constants (τ1 and τ2) and their corresponding fractions (A1 and A2), as summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The average lifetime of pristine and Br-MNP treated perovskite films can be calculated as 122.20 and 78.71 ns, respectively. This shortened lifetime was mainly attributed to efficient carrier transfer from perovskites to Br-MNPs. It is known that the former time constant and its fraction (τ1 and A1) can be assigned to the radiative recombination, and the latter (τ2 and A2) represent the non-radiative recombination.35,36 Specifically, compared to the pristine film, the τ1 of the Br-MNP-modified film barely remained unchanged, while the A1 increased by over 50%, indicating a more efficient radiative recombination pathway. Moreover, both τ2 and A2 were reduced, revealing a suppressed non-radiative recombination. Accordingly, the trap-assisted recombination was efficiently inhibited.
The dark I–V characteristics of the electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au) were subsequently measured to quantify the trap state densities (ntrap) of pristine and 2% Br-MNP-modified perovskite films. As presented in Fig. 4a and b, three different regions are marked as the ohmic region (at low bias voltages), the trap-filled limit (TFL) region (during the rapid nonlinear increase), and the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) region (at high applied biases). Notably, the kink voltage indicated by the intersection of red and blue lines is assigned as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), where trap states are filled with injected charge carriers. Accordingly, VTFL can be determined as 0.34 V for the pristine device and 0.2 V for the Br-MNP modified device. By using the following equation  where ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of perovskite films, and e is the elementary charge,40 the ntrap can be calculated as 4.33 × 1015 cm−3 (pristine device) and 2.55 × 1015 cm−3 (2% Br-MNP-modified device). This obvious reduction of ntrap directly revealed that the insertion of Ti3C2Br nanoparticles can effectively heal defects in the perovskite film. Specifically, Br terminated groups passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ ions and decrease the Pb–I anti-site defects on the perovskite connecting point. Thus, the trap-assisted recombination can be suppressed, in good agreement with TRPL analysis. Carrier mobility (μ) can be additionally derived in the trap-free SCLC regime, by fitting the dark I–V curve with the Mott–Gurney law  where V is applied voltage and d is the thickness of the perovskite film.41 Compared to the pristine device, the carrier mobility of the Br-MNP doped device was increased by one order of magnitude from 0.013 to 0.210 cm2 V−1 s−1. This improvement implied that the introduction of Br-MNPs can improve carrier mobility and thus promote charge transport.

(e) Schematic mechanism of introducing Br-MNPs in the CsFAMA film. 
Moreover, the benefits of introducing 2% Br-MNPs were further validated by conducting noise measurements of as-fabricated devices under 0 V bias. As shown in Fig. 4c, the noise current of 2% Br-MNP doped device is only 1.26 pA Hz−1/2, which is much smaller than that of the pristine device (3.12 pA Hz−1/2). It is worth noting that all the noise current decrease linearly, indicating that 1/f noise dominates up to 100 kHz. Such a low noise current level originated from the enhanced film quality and the reduced defects, i.e., grain boundaries and trap state densities, well supported by morphological and I–V characterization. Fig. 4d shows the large area photocurrent mapping at 532 nm with a confocal laser scanning microscope at zero bias. A higher photocurrent was obtained in the Br-MNP device rather than the pristine device. Consequently, the optimal Br-MNP decorated perovskite film exhibited an improved film morphology with less grain boundaries, better crystal quality with reduced defect densities, more efficient carrier transport with suppressed non-radiative recombination and higher carrier mobility. These results confirmed the benefits of introducing Br-MNPs, i.e., improving both electrical and optical properties by healing a variety of microscopic and macroscopic defects.
To understand the mechanism behind the Br-MNP decorating approach, the schematic of the perovskite structure blended with Br-MNPs is illustrated in Fig. 4e. Br-MNPs can be considered as effective heterogeneous nucleation sites in the FAMA precursor, which provides multiple Br anions to lower the energy barrier of the formation of octahedral lead halide through chelation. This process can inevitably suppress the number of nucleation sites near the SnO2 surface during film growth, leading to an improved film morphology with increased grain sizes (consistent with the SEM and AFM results).30,41 Moreover, a strong interaction between under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and Br atoms (verified by XPS, Fig. 3c–e) is expected to reduce the halide deficiency,35 and achieve good defect passivation.42–44 Since the atomic radius of Br ions (1.96 Å) is smaller than that of I ions (2.20 Å), it is reasonably believed that Br ions can easily enter the crystal framework and thus efficiently compensate iodide vacancies.45 In addition, Br terminals provided by Br-MXene can alternatively fill partial anion vacancies generated by iodide evaporation during the annealing process, owing to its higher binding energy (binding affinity: 2.85 eV) than I− (binding affinity: 2.35 eV).46 Therefore, the film growth can be efficiently modulated and enhanced, and defects in films can be suppressed, leading to an improved morphology and crystal quality, which agrees well with the results derived from XRD, TRPL and other characterization studies.
Apart from the defect passivation, Br-MNPs can additionally “bridge” the adjacent grains. Accordingly, the carrier extraction and transport process can be accelerated, leading to an improved photocurrent and shortened response time (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the addition of Br-MXene is expected to change the band energy levels of perovskites, which was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Fig. S10, ESI†). It is clear that the Br-MNP assisted perovskite film possessed a leveraged work function (WF, 4.22 eV), valence band maximum (VBM, 5.75 eV), and conduction band minimum (CBM, 4.12 eV), as indicated in Fig. S12 (ESI†). These shallower VBM and CBM present in the Br-MNP-modified sample matched better with those of the adjacent SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD layers, resulting in an improved band alignment. Therefore, carrier extraction at both interfaces of perovskite/SnO2 and perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD became more efficient, contributing to the improved photocurrent (Fig. 2c). On the other hand, by considering the CB offsets between the perovskite and SnO2 (4.50 eV), it is obvious that the CB offset in perovskite film decorated with Br-MNPs was slightly larger than that in the pristine film. This larger CB offset suggested an increased barrier height, leading to a suppressed dark current (Fig. 2b). Thus, Br-MNPs are beneficial for preparing high-quality perovskite films in terms of improved film morphology, crystallinity, carrier mobility, and radiative efficiency.
Thanks to the improved film quality, further evaluations were performed on 2% Br-MNP-modified perovskite photodetector. R and D* determined the electrical response to the incident optical signal, and characterized the ability to detect a weak light signal, respectively. Their corresponding equations can be expressed as  And , where Iph is the photocurrent (Iph= Ilight− Id), Llight denotes the light power density and A represents the effective area, and f is the electrical bandwidth and In is the noise current.47,48 Accordingly, R and D* of the optimal photodetector can be estimated as 3.93 A W−1 and 2.56 × 1012 Jones, respectively, when illuminated by a 520 nm laser diode (60 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 5a, R and D* values initially decreased in the low-intensity region, and then gradually increased in the high-intensity region. This phenomenon involved complex carrier generation, trapping, recombination, and transport. Upon gradually increasing the irradiation intensity, the photogenerated carriers were captured by shallow traps, resulting in reduced responsivity. As the light intensity was further increased, a large number of photocarriers were generated and could pass through the Br-MNPs high-speed channel, with no effects caused by the limited number of shallow traps. Thus, the larger photocurrent can be obtained, contributing to an increase in responsivity. In addition, the largest Ion/Ioff of ∼3 × 104 and the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 915.4% were obtained under 520 nm excitation with a light intensity of 60 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5b), indicating an excellent switching behavior and optical conversion capability, respectively.

(b) Light intensity-dependent on/off ratio and EQE spectra. (c) LDR derived from the intensity-dependent photocurrent under 520 nm laser illumination. (d) Normalized transient photoresponse. (e) Comparison of the response time of the state-of-the-art photodetectors. (f) 3 dB cutoff frequency estimated from the normalized response. 
LDR, described as the linear response capability within a certain range of light intensity, can be determined by the following equation  Where Pmax and Pmin are the upper and lower limits of the optical power in a linear range.49 As shown in Fig. 5c, the LDR is calculated as 98 dB, which is comparable with or even larger than that of the state-of-the-art photodetectors, e.g., InGaAs (66 dB).50Fig. 5d shows the response time, as another important indicator in the optical communication. The photocurrent immediately responded to a modulated laser pulse. The rise time (τr) and decay time (τd), defined as the time duration of photocurrent rising and decaying from 10% to 90% and 90% to 10% of the maximum current, respectively. Accordingly, τr and τd were measured as 29.9 and 26.2 μs, respectively, at a 1 kHz modulation. Such a short response time mainly originated from the efficient interfacial charge transfer and improved carrier mobility, evidenced by PL and TRPL results. It is worth noting that the response time of optimized Br-MNP photodetectors is equivalent to that of the silicon-based photodetectors,51–54 and is higher than that of the previous photodetectors of perovskite48,55–61 and other 2D material systems,62–72 as summarized in Fig. 5e. In order to validate the fast response in optical communication, the temporal response of optimal Br-MNP-modified photodetector was further measured by modulating the pulsed frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 60 kHz. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the optimized device exhibited excellent electrical stability and reproducibility within a broad range of frequencies. Notably, the photoresponse can clearly highlight the “on” and “off” states until 10 kHz. Based on the above results, the typical 3 dB cutoff frequency (f3dB) was calculated as 12 kHz, which was almost sufficient for some communication systems (Fig. 5f).7,73
With the good photodetection performance at a water transmission window of around 520 nm, a proof-of-concept underwater wireless optical communication system (UWOCS) based on the Br-MNP-blended photodetector was designed and demonstrated, as illustrated in Fig. 6a.74 The entire system consists of a modulator, driver, 520 nm laser diode, sink and Br-MNP-modified perovskite photodetector, and an amplifier and oscilloscope. Initially, a character string, “UESTC”, was converted into binary data using a computer, as shown in Fig. 6b. The binary data were subsequently transmitted to the modulator, enabling the On–Off Keying modulated electric signal. The emission from a 520 nm light source was directly modulated by the driver, and allowed to travel through a 60 cm long water channel. Ultimately, the encoded signal was detected using the as-fabricated photodetector, followed by the amplifying (low noise amplifier) and capturing (oscilloscope). Without utilizing any wave shaping technologies, the transmitted signals can be directly recognized using the Br-MNP perovskite photodetector, as presented in Fig. 6c. Fig. 6d shows the waveforms of the digital data at different Baud rates received from the photodetector. Benefitting from the low noise and fast response characteristics of the optimized photodetector, the UWOCS can operate up to 128000 Baud rate. Owing to the limited bandwidth of the as-fabricated photodetector, the output waveform started to become distorted as the Baud rate is over 115200. Fortunately, the weakened signal did not seriously affect the data transmission, and the signal can be still clearly identified.

Conclusions
A Br terminated MNP decorating strategy demonstrated to improve the quality of the perovskite film and hence the photoresponse of perovskite-based photodetectors. With the introduction of an appropriate amount of Br-MNPs, the film morphology, crystal quality, and charge transfer were significantly improved. Meanwhile, the defect densities and carrier mobilities were obviously enhanced, beneficial for suppressing the non-radiative recombination and facilitating carrier transport. Accordingly, the as-fabricated photodetectors with an optimal amount of Br-MNPs possessed an impressive performance of a noise level below 1.26 pA Hz−1/2, responsivity of 3.93 A W−1, linear dynamic range exceeding 98 dB, large Ion/Ioff over 104, and short response time below 29.9 μs. By utilizing the excellent response to 520 nm irradiation, an efficient UWOCS was demonstrated, which can directly identify the encoded signals. This study provides a new strategy for defect management of high-performance perovskite optoelectronic devices, and offers huge potential in practical applications.
Experimental section
Chemicals
The ITO glass substrate (10 Ω·sq−1) and SnO2 colloid (15 wt %) were purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Corp., Ltd and Alfa Aesar, respectively. Lead iodide (PbI2), lead bromide (PbBr2), formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), and cesium iodide (CsI) were supplied by TCI. 2,2′,7,7′7-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was provided by Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 4-tert-Butyl pyridine (tBP), lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulf-oxide (DMSO) and chlorobenzene (CB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Ti3AlC2 MAX was purchased from Beijing Beike New Material Technology Corp. All the chemicals were used as received without any purifications.
Preparation of MXene Ti3C2Br nanoparticles
The Br-MNPs were synthesized using a combined molten-salt and hydrothermal method. Ti3AlC2 and CuBr2 copper halide molten salts were mixed adequately using a mortar in a N2-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the product was placed into an alumina crucible, followed by heating in a tube furnace at 700 °C for 7 h under the protection of argon gas. In order to obtain high-quality MXenes, the powders were washed with deionized water to remove the residual CuBr2, and further purified by a NH4Cl/NH3·H2O solution to get rid of Cu. The cleaned products were then dried at 40 °C under vacuum to obtain the Ti3C2Br flake powder. Next, Ti3C2Br NPs were prepared by hydrothermal treatment with exfoliated MXene. In addition, ammonia water was employed to adjust the PH value of the solution (PH = 9), followed by heating at 120 °C for 6 h. Finally, the precursor was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min, followed by complete drying (under a vacuum, 45 °C, 8 h) to obtain the high-quality Br-MNPs.
Synthesis of the CsFAMA Precursor
The FAMA perovskite precursor was initially prepared by dissolving 1.4 M lead-salt solution (274.3 mg PbI2 and 38.54 mg PbBr2 powders) and 1.3 M organic-cation solution (95.06 mg FAI and 10.92 mg MABr) in the mixed DMF/DMSO solvent with a volume ratio of 4:1. In order to obtain the desired CsFAMA perovskite precursor, 34 μL of the CsI precursor (dissolved as a 2 M stock solution in DMSO) was subsequently added to FAMA solution. In terms of the Br-MNP assisted CsFAMA precursor, different amounts of Br-MNPs were simply injected into FAMA solution, followed by mixing with the CsI precursor.
Material characterization
The morphological characteristics of the perovskite films were investigated using a SEM (GeminiSEM 300) attached with an EDS system, and AFM (Alpha300R, WITec) in the tapping mode. The crystal phase and chemical bonding were examined by XRD (DX-2700) and FTIR (VERTEX 70, Bruker), respectively. Moreover, the absorbance of each perovskite thin film was recorded by using UV-vis spectroscopy (Lambda 750S, PerkinElmer). XPS analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al X-ray source. PL and Raman spectra were obtained by using a confocal spectrometer (Alpha300R, WITec). In terms of the carrier lifetime, it was measured using a FLS 980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). The trap densities and electron mobilities of perovskite films were measured in the dark by fabricating electron-only devices. All material characterizations were performed at room temperature (298 K).
Device fabrication
The ITO substrates were cleaned in the sequence of detergent, deionized water and ethyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min each. These substrates were then blown by N2 gas, followed by UV/ozone treatment for 15 min. Compact SnO2 films, as electron transport layers, were deposited on the substrates using a facile spin-coating technique with a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air. After neutrally cooling down to room temperature, the SnO2 films were treated with UV/ozone for 15 min to eliminate residues. Notably, the SnO2 precursor was prepared by dissolving the SnO2 colloid in the deionized water (1:3 by volume). Subsequently, the perovskite active layers were formed by spin coating the as-prepared precursor at 6000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox. Chlorobenzene, as anti-solvent, was dropped at the last 5th sec, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 30 min to achieve good crystallization. Next, a 30 μL Spiro-OMeTAD solution (dissolving 36.5 mg Spiro-OMeTAD into a mixture solution of 0.5 mL chlorobenzene, 9μL Li-TFSI, 15 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 14.5 μL FK209) was spin coated on the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and exposed to the O2 atmosphere for 12 h. Finally, the Au electrodes with a thickness of 80 nm thickness were thermally evaporated on top of the Spiro-OMeTAD film.
Device Characterization
The photoresponse of the perovskite photodetector was characterized using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200A-SCS, Keithley), equipped with a probe station (LT3, Advanced Research Systems). Three laser diodes with wavelengths of 405, 450 and 520 nm were used as an illumination source, with the intensity determined using an irradiance meter (FZ-A, Shenzhen Chuangxin Instrument Inc). During the temporal photoresponse measurement, a pulsed laser was generated using a function signal generator (AFG1062, Tektronics). In addition, the photocurrent mapping was performed on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Alpha300 RA, WITec) by placing the photodetector on the micro-cloud platform using a photocurrent module. In terms of noise current measurements, they were recorded using a Keithley 4200 with a noise testing module (FS-Pro, Primarius). All device characterization studies were performed under ambient conditions.
