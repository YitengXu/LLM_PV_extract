    , Accepted 28th July 2020First published on 18th August 2020AbstractEnzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) are one of the promising next-generation energy conversion systems. However, their applications are often obstructed by their power density and their lack of long-term operational stability. Enzyme immobilization is one of the strategies to overcome these limitations. The construction of a surface-confined electrode architecture that provides biocompatible microenvironments for enzyme immobilization might be a promising approach to address such barriers. Inspired by the interaction between laccase and copper ions leading to the growth of micrometer-sized flower-like particles, we successfully demonstrate a cathodic electrode design using these hybrid nanoflowers as a biocatalyst for oxygen reduction. Using this electrode architecture, enhanced activity and stability are achieved. By integrating this cathode in a fuel cell setup, two H2/O2 fuel cell configurations have been constructed: a membraneless fuel cell (MFC) and a proton exchange membrane H2/O2 fuel cell (PEMFC) that show enhancement of the performance. The cell is equipped with an oxygen-reducing laccase–Cu nanoflower/carbon nanotube biocathode and an abiotic anode. The maximum power densities of the H2/O2 MFC and PEMFC were 52 μW cm−2 and 0.41 mW cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, the H2/O2 PEMFC system maintained ∼85% of its initial power density for 15 days at room temperature, which was greatly improved when compared with previous fuel cells with different nanostructures. These results allow a great variety of conductive biocompatible cathodes to be used and engineered, opening vast possibilities for the development of bioelectronics and biosensors.
Electron transport is a central process of life involved in many biological phenomena, such as the respiratory chain, photosynthesis and metabolic pathways. For instance, the photosynthetic process requires electron transport chains to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Electron transfers (ETs) are also involved in redox enzymes that catalyze life-sustaining chemical reactions in all microorganisms.1,2
Recently, the development of (bio)electrochemistry, which uses redox enzymes that are connected to the electrode, has gained importance in the field of biotechnology.3,4 (Bio)electrochemical devices, such as enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) unlike noble metals, utilize bioavailable, renewable and diverse biocatalysts and biofuels, operate under mild and safe conditions, and possess high energy-conversion efficiencies.5–11 These advantages enhance the potential of EFCs to ‘ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all’, corresponding to sustainable development goals addressed by the United Nations (2015).12 However, all these desirable features of enzymes and their promising industrial applications are often obstructed by their lack of power density, long-term operational stability, and reusability. Several factors and theories have been reported to elucidate these obstacles which are directly related to ET between the electrodes and enzymes, low enzymatic activity and stability in the EFC setup.3
In order to overcome these limitations, considerable attention has recently been given to the development of innovative strategies, such as enzyme immobilization approaches,13,14 tuning enzyme properties,15 designing protective matrices,16etc. In particular, by using enzyme immobilization, several applications using immobilized enzymes have been successfully developed for commercial products.17
The activity and stability of an EFC using a non-immobilized enzyme are principally determined by its intrinsic structure, whereas those of an EFC with an immobilized enzyme are dependent on many factors, in particular, the type of microenvironment in which enzyme molecules are confined and the conditions under which enzyme molecules are immobilized.18 Hence, the stability of immobilized enzymes with regard to time and other experimental storage conditions might be expected to either increase or decrease on immobilization. It has been found that many enzymes immobilized by soft and biocompatible strategies have higher activity than the native enzymes (in solution).18–20 Despite the progress made in this area using different approaches, such as physical adsorption, covalent bonding, entrapment, etc.,21 further efforts to develop novel approaches by providing a unique microenvironment to enhance the stability as well as retain the activity are still highly needed for realizing efficient EFC devices.
Considering the aforementioned requirements, we took inspiration from the architecture of flower-like structures, reported by Zare's group, for the development of efficient and stable EFCs.22 From this strategy, we proved how the combination of biocompatible immobilization of enzymes with carbonaceous conductive nanomaterials, which is likely to produce biocompatible microenvironments and an ET with fast kinetics, results in an enhancement of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), long term stability and an overall improvement of the BFC performance. Most of the electrocatalytic processes, such as the ORR, hydrogen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction, are sluggish in nature and require effective catalysts for various applications.23–26 This is done by exploiting a mixture of laccase nanoflowers as a biocatalyst and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a matrix for enzyme immobilization/ET. The CNTs possess ideal physicochemical properties to equilibrate principal factors that determine the nanoflower biocatalyst efficiency, including ET, specific surface area, mass transfer resistance, and effective nanoflower loading. This strategy provides a synergy of three useful features – porosity, efficient ET, and biocompatibility which could be used to develop miniaturized self-power bioelectronics, such as wearable devices that require low power/voltage and utilize enzymatic nanoflower catalysts directly to achieve specific functions.

Fig. 1 shows how electrons move from CNTs to the enzyme redox center electrodes. The ORR occurs on the electrode in which the oxygen is reduced to water.

The ET within the nanoflower/CNT films by direct electron transfer between CNTs and laccase embedded within the nanoflowers was evidenced by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements (CA).
Experimentally, after identifying and characterizing the morphology and structures of the nanoflower/CNT samples, the resulting mixtures were drop-cast on a GC electrode for the evaluation of their electrochemical activity and stability through CV and CA measurements. Based on the three-electrode results, we constructed two different H2/O2 fuel cell configurations: a membraneless fuel cell (MFC) and a proton exchange membrane H2/O2 fuel cell (PEMFC) comprising a CNT/laccase–inorganic hybrid biocathode and an abiotic anode. The proposed PEMFC design reveals relatively high power output and operational stability, outperforming recently reported H2/O2 BFCs.
Characterization of laccase–inorganic hybrid suspensions
To examine the role of the laccase-nanoflower structure in reducing oxygen electrochemically in an aqueous medium, we prepared laccase–inorganic hybrid nanoflowers, originally reported by Zare and coworkers.22 An aqueous divalent ion solution in water was added to PBS (pH 7.4) containing laccase, followed by incubation at 25 °C for three days. The resulting precipitates were collected using similar precipitation kinetics, regardless of the metal ions selected for the experiment. Laccase was added and mixed with three different divalent cations including Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+, and the resulting structures were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques using samples collected at different time points and produced under different reaction conditions.
After three days, all the samples presented high-surface-area structures. The laccase–Cu mixtures resulted in blue-colored precipitates whereas the laccase–Mn and laccase–Zn samples gave clear white-colored suspensions.
All the laccase–Cu hybrid suspensions resulted in a porous and flower-like morphology (Fig. 2). Three different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg ml−1) of laccase were tested to investigate the influence of protein concentration on the morphology and particle size. For 2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu hybrid suspension, several porous flower-like spheres of around 20–40 μm (Fig. 2a and b) in diameter were observed. Both 0.5 mg ml−1 and 1.0 mg ml−1 (Fig. 2f and g, respectively) laccase–Cu nanoflowers resulted in particle sizes of around 8–25 μm.

(c–e) TEM images of laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers. Black boxes in c and d indicate the areas enlarged for images d and e, respectively. (f–h) Laccase–Cu nanoflowers in different concentrations of laccase: (f) 0.5 mg ml−1, (g) 1.0 mg ml−1, and (h) 2.5 mg ml−1. 
In stark contrast with Cu2+, the images of laccase–Mn hybrid suspensions (Fig. S1†) indicated numerous thin rectangular nanosheets with a width of around 2–4 μm attached to each other forming sharp-edged petals. The particle size of each nanosheet did not vary with protein concentrations. On the other hand, laccase–Zn hybrid suspensions resulted in non-porous rhombic crystals (Fig. S2†) and no nanoflowers were formed.
The reaction time was reported to affect the growth of hybrid nanoflowers in previous studies and reviews.22,27–30 In this context, the SEM images of the reaction mixture were taken for three different times (1 h, 15 h, and 76 h). Fig. 3 shows the crystal formation and growth as a function of time for 2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers. As shown in Fig. 3a, the formation of primary crystals was observed at the initial stage. The agglomeration of the crystals was observed after 15 hours of reaction (Fig. 3b). The average size of these crystals was 20–30 μm in diameter. The final stage was the complete formation of porous nanoflower structures resulting from the anisotropic growth (Fig. 3c). A larger pore size of 1–2 μm was observed after 76 hours when compared with that after 15 hours of reaction. The influence of the reaction time on the laccase–Mn and laccase–Zn suspensions was investigated for further comparison. As a result, the extent of reaction time did not affect neither the morphology nor the particle size of the samples (Fig. S3a–f†). The laccase–Mn suspensions showed thin rectangular sheets of 2–3 μm attached to each other for all the samples. In contrast, all the laccase–Zn samples exhibited large rhombic crystals.

We further confirmed the crystal structure and chemical composition of the laccase–metal hybrid suspensions using XPS and XRD techniques. The position of peaks from the XPS spectra of laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers (Fig. S7a†) exhibited the existence of Cu 2p, P 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and Cl 2p peaks accounting for 14.58%, 12.83%, 15.61%, 53.44%, and 3.54% of the atomic concentration. Fig. S7b† shows the Cu 2p core-level XPS spectrum of laccase–Cu nanoflowers which presents Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks at 935.8 eV and 955.4 eV, respectively. Several satellite peaks of Cu 2p3/2 were observed between 938.7 and 947.6 eV. From the XPS spectrum, the determination of the peaks corresponding to Cu 2p3/2, P 2p3/2 (Fig. S7c†) and O 1s confirmed the presence of Cu, P and O elements. Therefore, the inorganic nanoflowers were confirmed to be copper phosphate which is consistent with the results described in the previous literature.31,32 As a further evaluation of the nanoflower composition, Fig. S10† shows the XRD analysis of 0.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers (black) compared with the mixture of PBS and CuSO4·5H2O (red) which clearly showed the presence of Cu3(PO4)2 (indicated by the asterisk).22
For the laccase–Mn synthesized nanomaterials, the XRD pattern fitted well with that of hydrated manganese phosphate Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O (JCPDS no. 3-426).33 The XPS spectra of the nanomaterials displayed the composition of Mn, P, O, N and C elements. Furthermore, Fig. S8b† shows two primary peaks corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 appearing at 641.7 eV and 653.9 eV, respectively. These observations confirmed the presence of laccase and Mn3(PO4)2.
For the laccase–Zn hybrid suspensions, Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks were observed at 1021.7 eV and 1045.4 eV, respectively, in Fig. S9b.† P 2p core-level spectra were observed at 132.9 eV in the laccase–Zn suspensions, indicating the presence of manganese and zinc phosphate in these samples.34,35
All the results demonstrated that the mixture of laccase and divalent ions clearly formed laccase–metal3 (PO4)2 hybrid particles with different supramolecular structures.
Electrochemical properties of laccase hybrid nanoflower-modified GC electrodes
For electrochemical studies, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were added to each suspension sample to establish an electrical connection between the laccase redox center and GC electrodes. Fig. S4–S6† show the FE-SEM images of laccase–Cu, Mn, and Zn mixed with MWCNTs, respectively. These images indicated that the aforementioned characteristic morphology of each laccase–metal hybrid nanoflower suspension was maintained when mixed inside the MWCNTs.
GC/MWCNT electrodes modified with 2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers were tested for direct electron transfer (DET) by CV in pH 5.0 citrate buffer solution. Fig. 4 shows the results for DET represented by black and red curves at 1.0 mV s−1 in an N2 and O2 atmosphere, respectively. Considering the DET, in the oxygen-saturated solution (red line) the current onset starts at around 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl and increases continuously reaching a maximum current density of −0.26 mA cm−2 at about 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This potential is close to the redox potential of laccase T1 copper.2 The position of the electrocatalytic signature agrees well with that previously reported in the literature for immobilized laccase at carbon nanotube electrodes.2 A control experiment using physically adsorbed MWCNT/Lac toward the electrocatalytic ORR was performed (ESI† Fig. S13). All the control electrodes including physically adsorbed MWCNT/Lac and laccase in solution show inexistent or very poor ORR activity compared to the laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflower cathode.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the MWCNT/2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflower modified GC electrode in pH 5 phosphate–citrate buffer in an N2 (black) and O2 (red) atmosphere (scan rate: 1 mV s−1). 
Without considering the different experimental conditions, the faradaic currents of the present biocathode are higher than those of previous studies using enzyme-modified carbon nanotube biocathodes with different electron transfer strategies2,36–39 but are comparable or only slightly inferior to those with other laccase-based electrocatalysts, such as buckypaper40 and carbon nanofibers.37
In order to demonstrate the role of nanoflower structures in the electrocatalytic ORR, different configurations have also been examined, namely: (1) control experiment using the MWCNT/laccase–Mn and (2) control experiment in the presence of the MWCNT/laccase–Zn modified GC electrode. Both controls have shown no nanoflower structure compared to MWCNT/laccase–Cu. From Fig. 4 and S11,† it is clearly seen that MWCNT/laccase–Mn and MWCNT/laccase–Zn did not show any bioelectrocatalytic activity. These results demonstrate that the nanoflower structure is key in the electrocatalytic process.
An important drawback in the use of enzymatic cathodes, such as those based on laccases as biocatalysts in biofuel cells, comes from their poor long-term stability. Hence, we investigated the catalytic performance of the laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflowers using CA measurements over time (Fig. 5a). After initial stabilization of the cathodic current at about 0 A, the injection of O2 induces a fast and stable electrocatalytic effect, with the catalytic current remaining stable for around 2 hours (Fig. 5a). These results were also consistent with the CVs in which the laccase–Cu nanoflowers showed excellent electrochemical activity. To evaluate the long-term stability of the biocathode, the current density of oxygen reduction was daily recorded by performing a two hour discharge at 0.11 V for 6 days. The biocathode still delivered 75 μA cm−2 after 6 days (Fig. 5b), which represents 72% of its initial electrocatalytic activity and constitutes one of the lowest lifetime decreases reported until now for enzymatic cathodes using laccase.

(b) Operational stability based on daily chronoamperometry measurement of the MWCNT/2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–Cu nanoflower electrode over 6 days. Current densities were measured for 2 hours in pH 5 phosphate–citrate buffer solution. 
The observed enhancement in electroactivity as well as stability could be explained by the combination of two features: i) MWCNTs embedded within the nanoflower modified-electrode facilitate electron transfer to the T1 Cu site and reduce loss of enzyme from the electrode surface. Thanks to the hydrophobic nature of MWCNTs, the electrode attachment at this region of laccase (T1) should favor the optimal electron-transfer pathway from the electrode to the trinuclear T2/T3 catalytic site where O2 is reduced to water. ii) At the same time, the resulting nanoflower porous structure could dramatically reduce mass transfer limitations, as laccase resting on the surface of a flower petal has much more possibility to react with the substrate.
These combined features might generate synergistic effects to enhance the performance of the proposed cathode.
Fabrication of the nanoflower-based hybrid abiotic H2/O2 EFC and PEMFC
Building on the promising ORR performance of nanoflowers in a three-electrode cell especially under medium pH conditions, the laccase biocathode was connected to an abiotic anode producing hybrid biofuel cell setups. The main technical challenge in using and integrating efficiently the laccase catalytic biocathode in a fuel cell configuration is to create a system architecture that minimizes internal resistances, but at the same time, allows for a continuous flow through the system. For this reason, we have employed and compared two types of fuel cells. The first setup is a MFC operating in a mildly acidic solution at pH 5. The second is a PEMFC based on a Nafion membrane. For the PEMFC setup, in addition to the kinetic factor, there are various other potential factors that can influence the power output, such as internal resistance (solution resistance, membrane resistance, etc.). Additionally, exposing the cathode directly to oxygen gas, instead of dissolved oxygen in water, can substantially increase the system performance.
For both designs, PdPtRu/C was used as the anodic catalyst due to its excellent performance in oxidizing H2.2 The data reported are means based on values that were obtained in triplicate experiments.
The first fuel cell was a membrane-less fuel cell setup, in which the supported nanoflower catalyst, associated with a PdPtRu/C anode, was operated at citrate buffer pH 5. The hybrid fuel cells were operated at room temperature with humidified streams of H2 and O2 feeding the anode and the cathode, respectively.

Fig. 6 shows the resulting polarization and power curves obtained during the successive potentiostatic discharges lasting for 5 minutes to eliminate the contribution of the MWCNT capacitive current. The hybrid biofuel cell shows an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.27 (±0.04) V. The resulting polarization graph shows that the voltage decreases until reaching a maximum current density of 1.2 (±0.3) mA cm−2. The power curve, derived from the polarization curve, was used to determine the maximum power output density of the cell, which was 52 mW cm−2 at a cell voltage of 0.11 V. The fuel cell also demonstrated high operational stability, maintaining ∼70% of its initial power density with voltage retention of ∼95% after continuous operations for 11 days. The enhanced stability of laccase in the nanoflowers probably arises from the interactions between the laccase and the biocompatible conductive microenvironment of the nanoflowers, which also contains Cu2+ ions (active site of the enzyme and inducer for laccase production in biotechnology).

The second fuel cell was a conventional PEMFC, in which the supported nanoflower catalyst, coupled to a PdPtRu/C anode, was operated at pH close to 0 due to the presence of the Nafion membrane. The biocathode was directly exposed to the gas phase under humidified O2, which overcame the limited O2 solubility in aqueous media. The O2 was humidified by bubbling through distilled water after the mass flow control and before entering the cathode flow fields of the cell. The anode was also operated in the gas phase supplied by a flow-through design and was tested with H2 flowing to its active area. The same fabrication process was employed for the creation of the anode and cathode, namely the deposition of each catalyst-containing ink on the respective compartment of the Nafion membrane. The inks were then equipped with Cu collectors before completing the fuel cell as described in the experimental section.

Fig. 7 shows representative polarization and power density curves of an H2/O2 EFC operated under the aforementioned experimental conditions. The OCV was 0.69 (±0.07) V, suggesting a high intrinsic ORR activity in the air-breathing fuel cell configuration. The biocathode was capable of generating current densities of 2 (±0.5) and 4 (±0.7) mA cm−2 at 0.22 and 0.04 V, respectively, at a flow rate of 20 ml min−1. The corresponding power density was up to 0.41 mW cm−2. Remarkably, the fuel cell performance was higher or comparable to those of EFCs in the previous literature particularly with laccase-based biocathodes. For comparison, Brunel et al.41 developed a membrane-less glucose/O2 EFC with laccase as a biocathode which resulted in a power density of 27 μW cm−2, which is lower compared to our PEMFC performance. De andrade and coworkers42 investigated the performance of a methanol/O2 biofuel cell in which laccase was immobilized with a polypyrrole film and polyamidoamine dendrimers. The maximum current density reached up to 117 μA cm−2 with a power density of 25.4 mW cm−2, indicating that our work outperformed these results.

To evaluate the long-term stability of the PEMFC, the power density was periodically recorded by performing a one hour discharge at 0.2 V for 15 days. The cell still delivered 0.35 (±0.5) mA cm−2 after 15 days, which represents 85% of its initial electrocatalytic activity.
In summary, we report the immobilization of laccase nanoflowers on MWCNT electrodes. This material catalyzes oxygen reduction with enhanced performances and stability. By integrating such a hybrid biocatalyst at a fuel cell cathode with an abiotic catalyst at the anode, a first proof of concept for a H2/O2 fuel cell based on nanoflowers has been established, with significant improvement of the performance compared to the state of the art. Future efforts will now focus on the development of an anodic nanoflower catalyst and its integration in a device using the existing biocathode. The proposed immobilization strategy introduces a new way for the fabrication of a conductive, biocompatible, efficient and stable biocathode. This strategy can be extended to other types of enzymes, even when the active site is located deeply inside the protein as it is still possible to introduce mediators in this design. This straightforward bioelectrode fabrication process could lead to other biofuel cell configurations, envisioning many future biotechnological applications.
Methods and materials
Methods
All materials were used as received without further purification. Laccase from Trametes versicolor was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For metal cation sources, copper sulfate pentahydrate and manganese acetate tetrahydrate were obtained from Sinopharm Group in Shanghai, China. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate and MWCNTs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (0.01 M, pH 7.4) was used as a reaction medium to synthesize the laccase–metal hybrid suspensions. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, from Sigma) was used to homogenize MWCNTs. Citric acid monohydrate and sodium monophosphate (both from Sigma) were used to prepare the electrolyte.
Preparation of laccase–inorganic hybrid suspensions
Laccase–Cu hybrid suspensions were synthesized by a procedure described in the previous literature. 20 μl of 120 mM CuSO4·5H2O aqueous solution was added to 3 ml of 0.01 M PBS containing varying amounts of laccase. The samples were incubated at room temperature for three days. Laccase–Mn and laccase–Zn hybrid suspensions were prepared using the same procedure except for the metal sources. MWCNTs were added to each hybrid suspension to demonstrate the electron transfer mechanism between the enzyme and the glassy carbon electrode (GCE).
Characterization of enzymatic hybrid suspensions
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F) images were used to examine the surface morphology of the synthesized enzymatic hybrid suspension. For the FE-SEM analysis, each suspension was taken with a micropipette and placed on a silicon wafer. After the samples were dried inside a vacuum oven at room temperature, they were coated with platinum on a sputter coater. The crystalline structures of these samples were analyzed using a Bruker D2-Phaser X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument with Cu-Kα radiation (30 kV, 10 mA). The surface chemistry of the laccase–metal hybrid suspension samples was analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB-250Xi spectrometer with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation.
Electrochemical properties of laccase–metal hybrid suspension-modified GCEs
GC was modified by combining laccase–metal hybrid suspensions and MWCNTs. 20 μl of 2.5 mg ml−1 laccase–metal hybrid suspensions were mixed with 500 μl of 5.0 mg ml−1 MWCNTs dispersed in NMP, followed by homogenization with a vortex. Then, these mixture droplets were placed on the GCE and dried under vacuum.
The electrochemical properties of the biocathodes were examined by CV and CA measurements. Both CV and chronoamperometry measurements were recorded by using a computer-controlled potentiostat (AutolabPotentiostat 100 from MetroOhm) in a three-electrode system. A Pt plate was used as a counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl system as a reference electrode, and the laccase nanoflower-modified GCE as a working electrode. A pH 5 phosphate–citrate buffer solution was used as the electrolyte for all CV and CA measurements. Here, pH 5.0 was selected because it has been reported that the activity of laccase from Trametes versicolor reaches its optimal level in an acidic environment. The three-electrode electrochemical cell system was bubbled with N2 and O2 during CV and chronoamperometry measurements.
Fabrication of the laccase–Cu hybrid nanoflower-based hybrid abiotic H2/O2 EFC
For the anode, 200 μl of the catalysts were drop-cast (of 5 mg ml−1 dispersion in 2-propanol and de-ionized water) on a carbon cloth and dried under vacuum at 40 °C. For the cathode, a carbon cloth was first modified by drop-coating 200 μl of 5 mg ml−1 dispersion of MWCNTs in NMP. After drying under vacuum at 40 °C, the nanoflower catalyst was deposited (200 μl). Before use, all electrodes were rinsed with de-ionized water. Both electrodes were then placed face-to-face in a membrane-less fuel cell setup. Polarization and power curves were obtained by 5 min galvanostatic discharge at room temperature under humidified H2 and oxygen gas flows of 20 ml min−1. For the experiments at pH 5, the active surface area of the electrode was dipped in the electrolyte.
Fabrication of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
For the PEMFC setup, the Nafion membrane was treated according to the standard procedure of 60 min in a 5 wt% H2O2 solution at 80 °C, 60 min in ultrapure water at 80 °C, and finally 60 min in an 8 wt% H2SO4 solution at 80 °C. After each treatment, the membrane was rinsed three times in ultrapure water in order to remove H2O2 traces. The Nafion membrane was stored in ultrapure water before each use. The same fabrication process was employed for the creation of the anode and cathode, namely the deposition of each catalyst on the respective compartment of the Nafion membrane. The catalytic inks, 0.5 ml of 5 mg ml−1 dispersion of MWCNTs in NMP at the cathode and 0.5 ml of the catalysts (5 mg ml−1 dispersion in 2-propanol and de-ionized water) at the anode, were respectively deposited on the anodic and cathodic sides of the Nafion 112 membrane, using a micropipette. The solvents were removed at 60 °C under vacuum. For the cathodic side, 100 μl of a solution (1 mg ml−1) of the nanoflower catalyst was deposited. The inks were then equipped with Cu collectors on both the anode and cathode for optimal electron collection. The gases were injected into the anodic and cathodic compartments at a constant flow of 20 ml min−1.
