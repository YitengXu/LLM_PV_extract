    , Accepted 7th March 2012First published on 23rd March 2012Abstractp–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells were electrochemically fabricated by consecutively depositing an n-Cu2O layer on a p-Cu2O layer. In order to better understand the Fermi levels of the electrochemically grown polycrystalline p- and n-Cu2O layers and maximize the overall cell performance, the back and front contacts of the Cu2O homojunction cells were systematically changed and the I–V characteristics of the resulting cells were examined. The result shows that the intrinsic doping levels of the electrochemically prepared p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers are very low and they made almost Ohmic junctions with Cu metal with which previously studied p-Cu2O layers prepared by thermal oxidation of Cu foils are known to form Schottky junctions. The best cell performance (an η of 1.06%, a VOC of 0.621 V, an ISC of 4.07 mA cm–2, and a fill factor (ff) of 42%) was obtained when the p-Cu2O layer was deposited on a commercially available ITO substrate as the back contact and a sputter deposited ITO layer was used as the front contact on the n-Cu2O layer. The unique features of the p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cell are discussed in comparison with other Cu2O-based heterojunction solar cells.
1. Introduction
Cu2O is an abundant, low-cost, and environmentally benign direct band gap semiconductor (Eg = 1.9–2.2 eV) that is investigated for use in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical devices.1–8 Cu2O is typically produced p-type due to copper vacancies in the lattice;1 so, previous Cu2O based solar cell devices were based on p-Cu2O/metal Schottky junctions or p-Cu2O/n-type semiconductor (e.g. n-CdO or n-ZnO) heterojunctions.2,6,7,9–13 However, the pairing of p-Cu2O with n-Cu2O to form a p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cell is thought to be a way to reach the theoretical efficiency of ca. 12%.3 Despite this prognosis, there has been scant research to date on the construction of Cu2O homojunctions due to a previous deficiency of methods to produce n-Cu2O. To date, only four Cu2O based homojunctions have been reported.14–17
Previously, we fabricated p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells by consecutively depositing p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers and examined the effect of junction morphology on the overall cell performance. The best cell showed an efficiency (η) of 0.29%, a short-circuit photocurrent (ISC) of 2.5 mA cm–2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.423 V, a fill factor (ff) of 27% which left much room for improvement.16 One of the major limitations of this device was the imperfectly Ohmic junction between the n-Cu2O layer and the metal contact (e.g. AuPd). Therefore, a more systematic study to understand the Fermi levels of the Cu2O layers and to identify suitable contact materials was necessary.
In theory and as a good starting point for choosing contact materials, a contact material having a work function larger than the work function of a p-type semiconductor should yield Ohmic contact while for an n-type semiconductor Ohmic contact should be made with a material of a smaller work function. In practice, contact choice is not so straightforward as the junction is rarely ideal and interface states can play a significant role in the properties of the junction. Due to this, a metal/semiconductor interface may not behave as predicted. In addition, chemical reactions may take place at the interface between semiconductor and contact, further complicating the junction structure. This phenomenon is notably seen in p-Cu2O based devices in which copper rich regions are often formed at the Cu2O/metal or Cu2O/n-type semiconductor heterojunction. As a result, regardless of the initial junction types or compositions, the performance of these devices becomes governed by the p-Cu2O/Cu0 Schottky junctions.5 In this context, the construction of a p–n Cu2O homojunction may have a unique advantage in that the formation of Cu0 is not expected at the p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O rectifying junction where p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers have comparable, if not identical, chemical reactivities.
In this paper, we fabricated p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells via electrodeposition and systematically changed the materials contacting the p- and n-Cu2O layers to examine their effects on the overall performance. The goals of the study were to evaluate the Fermi level energies of the electrochemically prepared p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers and to identify optimum contact materials that can form Ohmic junctions to each Cu2O layer to improve the efficiency of the cell.
Since the Hall effect measurements of the electrochemically prepared Cu2O layers were not possible due to their high resistivities, the experiments carried out in this study provided one of the few feasible ways to indirectly locate their Fermi levels. The best cell assembled in this study achieved an efficiency of 1.06%, which is the highest efficiency reported to date for a Cu2O homojunction cell.16 Here, we report the performance of p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells assembled with various contact materials and discuss them comparatively with previously well-studied p-Cu2O/Cu solar cells, which will clarify the major differences between these devices.
2. Experimental section
Electrodeposition
The electrodeposition of Cu2O was carried out using a standard three electrode set-up in an undivided cell (Princeton Applied Research VMP2 Multichannel Potentiostat/Galvanostat). Commercially available tin-doped indium oxide (ITOcom: Delta Technologies, sheet resistance 8–12 Ω) substrates or glass slides sputter coated with 1000 Å of gold on 200 Å of Ti were used as working electrodes. The counter electrode consisted of a glass slide sputter coated with 1000 Å of Pt on 200 Å of Ti. The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) electrode.
Two different electrodeposition media were used to produce the Cu2O layers used in this paper and were previously reported elsewhere.16,18,19 p-Cu2O films were cathodically deposited (2 Cu2+ + 2 OH− + 2 e− → Cu2O + H2O) from aqueous solutions of 0.02 M CuSO4 (anhydrous, 98% purity, Alfa Aesar) and 0.34 M DL-lactic acid (85% aqueous solution, Sigma). Prior to deposition, the solutions were adjusted to pH 11 using NaOH and H2SO4. Depositions were carried out at 60 °C and −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
In order to form a p–n Cu2O homojunction, the electrodeposition of n-Cu2O was carried out on top of the previously deposited p-Cu2O layer. n-Cu2O is electrodeposited from aqueous solutions of 0.02 M Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (98–102%, Alfa Aesar) and 0.08 M CH3COOH (80+%, Mallinckrodt). Prior to deposition, the pH was adjusted to 4.9 using NaOH. Depositions were carried out at 70 °C and +0.02 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). After the deposition of Cu2O, top contacts were sputtered using an Anatech USA, Hummer 8.3 sputtering system with magnetron cathodes (US Inc., model MAK-2) under an Ar atmosphere. Targets for top contacts were purchased from ACI Alloys and include tin-doped indium oxide (ITOsput: 90/10 atomic% In2O3/SnO2, 99.99%), copper (Cu: 99.99%), palladium (Pd: 99.95%), and aluminium (Al: 99.999%). Cu, Pd and Al contacts were deposited by dc magnetron at 100 W and ITOsput was deposited by rf magnetron at 50 W. Prior to sputtering, the surface oxide layers and contaminants of Cu, Al and ITOsput targets were removed by sputtering at the powers used for deposition. The size of the top contact spots was 0.024 cm2.
Representations of a single layer p-Cu2O cell and a two layer p–n Cu2O homojunction cell prepared in this study are shown in Scheme 1a and b, respectively. p–n Cu2O homojunction cells consisted of ca. 800 nm of p-Cu2O (charge passed for deposition = 0.68 C cm−2) and ca. 300 nm n-Cu2O (charge passed for deposition = 0.45 C cm−2). Cells containing only p-Cu2O had an approximately 1100 nm thick p-Cu2O layer (charge passed for deposition = 1.23 C cm−2) in order to ensure that the single layer p-Cu2O cells would contain a comparable amount of Cu2O as the p–n Cu2O homojunction cells.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representations of cells containing (a) a single p-Cu2O layer and (b) a p–n Cu2O homojunction used in this study. The thickness of the single p-Cu2O layer (1100 nm) was adjusted to be equal to the thickness of the p–n Cu2O homojunction (800 nm p-Cu2O and 300 nm n-Cu2O). 
Characterization
UV-vis spectra to determine the band gap of the Cu2O films were obtained using a Varian Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrometer using diffuse reflectance mode (ESI†). In order to take diffuse reflectance mode measurements, the samples were scratched off the ITOcom substrates and pulverized with a mortar and pestle prior to spreading into a packed barium sulfate powder that served as a reference to collect a background spectrum. This was necessary because when UV-vis spectra of Cu2O films were obtained using transmission mode, the submicron-scale surface morphologies of the Cu2O films scattered the light and generated artificial absorption features that are not truly due to the absorption by Cu2O layers. The typical XRD patterns of p- and n-Cu2O layers used in this study can be found elsewhere.16,19 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on an FEI NOVA nanoSEM 200 operated at 5 kV. The samples were sputter coated with Pt prior to imaging to prevent charging.
Mott–Schottky plots of p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O films were obtained by measuring capacitance using a Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat/Galvanostat model 263A connected to a Princeton Applied Research FRD100 frequency response detector. A sinusoidal modulation of 10 mV was applied at a frequency of 10 kHz. A 0.2 M K2SO4 (pH 5.6) solution purged with Ar was used as the electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) electrode and a platinum electrode composed of 1000 Å of Pt on 200 Å of Ti on a glass slide were used as the reference and the counter electrode, respectively, while p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers deposited on ITOcom were used as the working electrode. For this measurement, the p-Cu2O film was deposited from the alkaline copper lactate solution described above for 10 minutes. The n-Cu2O film was deposited from the slightly acidic copper acetate solution described above until the dendritic Cu2O deposit completely covered the substrate.19
X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained for freshly prepared p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O using a Kratos Ultra DLD spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (1486.58 eV). XPS for commercially available Cu foil (99.9%, Nimrod Hall Copper Company) and CuO wire (99.99%, J. T. Baker Chemical) were also obtained as references. The spectra were collected at a fixed analyzer pass energy of 20 eV, and all spectra were calibrated to C 1s = 284.6 eV.

I–V measurements were performed using a Keithly 2400 source meter. Either an Au wire or a blunt tip, spring-loaded Au probe was used as a measurement probe to make contact to the top contact spots and connection to the back contact was through copper tape adhered to the substrate. Some electrodes were front illuminated through the front contact. Other samples were back illuminated through the ITOcom back contact to avoid shadowing of the solar cell by the top contact and the measurement probe. An optical fiber leading from a 300 W xenon arc lamp with a series of neutral density filters, an IR filter, and an AM 1.5G filter, provided solar simulating light (set to 100 mW cm−2). All characterizations were performed using freshly prepared samples.
3. Results and discussion
Previously, p-Cu2O prepared by thermal annealing of Cu foil (p-Cu2Otherm) has been shown to make Ohmic contact to Au (work function = 5.1–5.47 eV) and Schottky contact to Cu (work function = 4.53–5.1 eV).5,15,20 Therefore, although we cannot find a reported value, we estimate that the Fermi level energy of p-Cu2Otherm is located somewhere between the work functions of Au and Cu (Scheme 2a). Schottky junction solar cells fabricated with p-Cu2Otherm and copper metal contacts report open circuit voltages of approximately 0.3 V when the copper metal contacts are prepared by thermal evaporation and nearly 0.7 V (under AM 1.0 irradiation) when the copper metal contacts are formed by H+ ion bombardment treatment on the p-Cu2Otherm surface.21 Most other metals, regardless of their work functions, are known to form Schottky contacts with p-Cu2Otherm due to reactions between the metal and p-Cu2O to form Cu0 at the interface.5

(b) The Ef of our p-Cu2Oele is located more positive than the Ef of p-Cu2Otherm. Ef of the n-Cu2O based on the VOCs obtained from (c and d) Au/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu cell, (e) ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu or Al cell, and (f) ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/ITOsput cell. As these Fermi level values are based on the VOCs, the true Fermi level of the n-Cu2O is expected to be closer to the CB band than what is represented by (f). 

Fig. 1a shows the I–V characteristics of the p-Cu2O/Cu contact when the p-Cu2O was electrodeposited on an Au substrate and topped with sputter coated Cu contacts (cell: Au/p-Cu2O/Cu). It shows only a slightly rectifying response in the dark and displays only a small VOC (<0.1 V) under front illumination. This indicates that the doping level of the electrodeposited p-Cu2O (p-Cu2Oele) is significantly lower than that of p-Cu2Otherm used in previous studies. Since our p-Cu2Oele forms an essentially Ohmic contact with Cu metal, it is reasonable to assume that its Fermi level energy is located above that of p-Cu2Otherm and near the work function of Cu (Scheme 2b).

The fact that the electrochemically prepared p-Cu2O layer makes an almost Ohmic junction with Cu metal can be a favorable feature in terms of maintaining a good Ohmic contact to any back contact material. As mentioned previously, it is reported that Cu0 formation between the p-Cu2O and metal contact except for Au is unavoidable. Therefore, when the p-Cu2Otherm layer is used, even if a metal type is chosen to form Ohmic contact with p-Cu2O, the p-Cu2O/metal back contact will become p-Cu2O/Cu0 Schottky contact over time reducing the cell efficiency.5 However, with p-Cu2Oele the unavoidable formation of Cu0 at the back Ohmic contact will not result in the formation of a strong Schottky junction and therefore cannot severely affect the overall cell performance.
When a p–n Cu2O homojunction was fabricated by depositing the n-Cu2O layer atop the p-Cu2O layer before the sputter deposition of Cu contacts (cell: Au/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu), the I–V curve shows very low reverse current in the dark and a VOC of ca. 0.45 V under front illumination was achieved indicating the formation of a non-leaky or low loss rectifying junction (Fig. 1b). For this result to be seen, either (i) the p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O junction or (ii) the n-Cu2O/Cu junction should be more strongly rectifying than the p-Cu2O/Cu junction shown in Fig. 1a. For the first case to work, the Fermi level (Ef) of the layer called n-Cu2O should be located at least 0.45 V above that of p-Cu2O, which would put the Ef of n-Cu2O in the range of intrinsic or poorly doped n-type (Scheme 2c). For the second case to work, the Fermi level of the layer called n-Cu2O should be located at least 0.45 V below the Fermi level of Cu (Scheme 2d), which will make n-Cu2O more heavily doped p-type than the p-Cu2O layer. In order to compare the relative positions of the Fermi levels of p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O, Mott–Schottky plots were obtained in a 0.2 M K2SO4 solution (pH 5.6) (Fig. 2). The most distinctive difference of these plots is the sign of the slopes. The negative slope of the plot obtained for p-Cu2O and the positive slope of the plot obtained for n-Cu2O confirm the p-type and n-type natures of these electrodes, respectively. The presence of multiple linear regions in both plots suggests the presence of multiple donor and acceptor levels.22 The most conservatively estimated flatband potential values for p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O (i.e., the most negative value for p-type and the most positive value for n-type) based on these plots are 0.33 V vs. NHE and −0.13 V vs. NHE, respectively. The flatband potential (Ufb) can be converted to Fermi level energy (Ef) using the following equations,23Ufb (in V vs. NHE) = −Ef (in eV vs. vacuum) + VH (in V) − 4.5VH (in V) = 0.059 (pHPZZP − pH)where VH is the Helmholtz layer potential drop and pHPZZP is the point of zero zeta potential. When a literature pHPZZP value of Cu2O (8.5) is used,24 the Fermi level energies for p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O are estimated to be approximately −4.7 eV and −4.2 eV vs. the vacuum, respectively. The actual Fermi levels of p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O may differ slightly from the values estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots, but this result unambiguously confirms that the Fermi level of n-Cu2O is definitively located at a more negative potential than that of p-Cu2O and that the rectifying behavior seen in Fig. 1b is from the p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O junction and cannot be from the n-Cu2O/Cu junction.

The origin of n-type doping of Cu2O has not been clearly elucidated to date. In order to check whether the n-type doping of Cu2O prepared in this study is due to the incorporation of extrinsic dopants during electrodeposition, XPS was performed for n-Cu2O and compared with that of p-Cu2O. For both electrodes no elements other than Cu and O were detected, indicating that no detectable amounts of extrinsic dopants are present in n-Cu2O and p-Cu2O. Interestingly, distinct differences were observed between n-Cu2O and p-Cu2O spectra when the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu LMM Auger regions were compared (Fig. 3). (The overlap of the Cu+ and Cu0 binding energies in the Cu 2p3/2 region necessitated the investigation of the Cu LMM Auger region as well.25) In the Cu 2p3/2 peak region, p-Cu2O showed a pronounced peak at a slightly higher energy compared to the main Cu+ peak (Cu+ binding energy = 932.2 eV) that indicates the presence of Cu2+ (Cu2+ binding energy = 933.2 eV), which is absent in the n-Cu2O spectrum.25–27 This agrees well with the previous report that the p-type nature of p-Cu2O is due to Cu+ vacancies in the Cu2O lattice, which can result in the formation of Cu2+ ions to balance the charge of the lattice.1 When the Cu LMM Auger peak region, which shows distinct peak energy separation between Cu0 (kinetic energy = 919.0 eV) and Cu+ (kinetic energy = 916.9 eV), is examined, n-Cu2O showed a tiny peak at an energy characteristic of Cu0 which is not present in the p-Cu2O spectrum. This result suggests that the n-type doping of Cu2O may be associated with the presence of Cu0 donors in the lattice. The p-Cu2O Auger peak also exhibits a slight broadening on the higher energy side of the Cu+ peak. However, the broadening initiates at a much lower energy than the Cu0 peak and its profile matches better with the peak originated by the presence of Cu2+ (kinetic energy = 918.2 eV) when compared with the auger spectrum of CuO.

In (a), Cu foil shows a peak for Cu2+ as well as Cu0 due to the immediate formation of a thin CuO layer on the surface upon the exposure in the air although the surface was cleaned in acid before the measurement. The arrows in (a) and (b) indicates the presence of Cu2+ in p-Cu2O and Cu0 in n-Cu2O, respectively. 
A recent theoretical study reported that n-type doping cannot be resulted from simple defect models (e.g. interstitial Cu in the tetrahedral or octahedral sites).28 However, this study does not exclude the possibility that n-Cu2O may be caused by more complicated defect structures (e.g., defect clusters) involving the presence of Cu0 in the Cu2O lattice.29 Examination of the copper Pourbaix diagram reveals that the conversion of Cu2O to Cu can occur more readily in an acidic medium (Cu2O + 2H+ + 2e− → Cu + H2O) while the conversion of Cu2O to CuO can occur more readily in a basic medium (Cu2O + H2O → CuO + 2H+ + 2e−).30 This also insinuates that Cu0 may be more easily incorporated into the Cu2O lattice as a dopant in an acidic medium where our n-Cu2O is deposited while Cu2+ can be more easily be incorporated into the Cu2O lattice as a dopant in a basic medium where our p-Cu2O is deposited. This plausibility corroborates well with the XPS results.
The back Au contact and the front Cu contact used to assemble the p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O junction solar cell are both opaque and can shadow the cell, which undermines the full performance of the p–n Cu2O junction. Therefore, in order to eliminate the shadow effect and enhance the amount of light reaching the junction, the cell was deposited on a visibly transparent ITO substrate that is commercially available (ITOcom) (cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu). The I–V characteristics in the dark of the ITOcom/p-Cu2O/Pd junction were first compared with that of the Au/p-Cu2O/Pd junction to confirm that ITOcom forms as good Ohmic contact as Au to our p-Cu2O. Fig. 4a and b shows that the ITOcom/p-Cu2O/Pd cell not only forms Ohmic junctions but also increased the slope of the dark I–V curve over that of the Au/p-Cu2O/Pd cell, indicating that the ITOcom reduces the resistance of the cell by making a better quality junction with p-Cu2O. The SEM images of p-Cu2O grown on Au and ITO are comparable suggesting that the decreased resistivity is not due to the morphological differences of Cu2O layers grown on the Au and the ITOcom substrates but due to the difference in the quality of the Au/p-Cu2O and the ITOcom/p-Cu2O junctions (Fig. 4c and d).
 Fig. 4  
I–V curves of (a) Au/p-Cu2O/Pd and (b) ITOcom/p-Cu2O/Pd cells measured in the dark reveal that both Au and ITOcom form Ohmic junctions with p-Cu2O. SEM images of ca. 1100 nm thick p-Cu2O layers deposited on (c) Au and (d) ITOcom substrates used to obtain the I–V curves seen in (a) and (b), respectively. 
The I–V curve of a typical cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu back illuminated through the ITOcom substrate is shown in Fig. 5a. This cell had an average VOC of 0.520 V, an ISC of 2.67 mA cm−2, an ff of 42% and an η of 0.59%. The improvement in performance can be attributed partly to the improved p-Cu2O/back contact and partly to the additional light being absorbed and utilized by the cell due to the reduction in light losses due to contact shadowing. The increase in VOC to ca. 0.5 V achieved by the cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu would push the Ef of the n-Cu2O even further towards the n-type side as seen in Scheme 2e (Ef > −4.5 eV). Since the work function of copper metal is reported to be between 4.53–5.10 eV,20 it is supposed to form slightly Schottky junctions with n-Cu2O. Therefore, in order to form a better Ohmic top contact to n-Cu2O, a solar cell was fabricated with an ITOcom back contact and Al front contacts as Al has a smaller work function (4.06–4.26 eV) than Cu (cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Al).20 A typical I–V curve of the resulting cell is seen in Fig. 5b. These cells show an average VOC of 0.510 V, an ISC of 3.32 mA cm−2, an ff of 43% and an η of 0.73% under back illumination. The improvement in the average efficiency with Al top contacts, 0.73%, over Cu top contacts, 0.59%, proves that Al indeed makes a better Ohmic junction to the n-Cu2O layer, which in turn also confirms that n-Cu2O layer is really n-type.

Back illumination via the ITOcom substrate was used. In (c) typical cell are indicated with a solid line and the best performance reported in this study is indicated with a dashed line. 
The typical SEM images of the morphology of the p-Cu2O layer and of the n-Cu2O layer deposited on the p-Cu2O layer are shown in Fig. 6. The p-Cu2O layer is composed of cubic crystals containing only (100) planes (Fig. 6a). The n-Cu2O grows seamlessly on top of these cubic crystals in the p–n junction; however, the resultant n-Cu2O layer is composed of truncated polyhedral crystals due to the acetate ion in solution which stabilized the (111) plane (Fig. 5b).18,31 The effect of additives serving as habit modifiers can be found elsewhere.32,33Fig. 5c shows a side view SEM of a p–n Cu2O homojunction. The p-Cu2O layer is approximately 800 nm thick and the n-Cu2O layer is approximately 300 nm thick. The difference between the p-Cu2O shown in Fig. 6a and in Fig. 4d is due to the difference in film thickness. As explained previously, the p-layer in the p–n junction solar cell is only ca. 800 nm thick while the p-layer in the cell containing only p-Cu2O is grown to be ca. 1100 nm. As the film grows thicker, the smaller cubic crystals grow together to form larger cubic crystals.

Further improvement of solar cell performance was obtained when ITO was sputter deposited as the top contacts (ITOsput). Fig. 5c shows the back illumination I–V curves of the best and an average p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O junction cell built on ITOcom and topped with ITOsput front contacts (cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/ITOsput). The best cell had a VOC of 0.621 V, an ISC of 4.07 mA cm−2, an ff of 42%, and an η of 1.06% which is higher than any p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cell reported to date. The average cell had a VOC of 0.544 V, an ISC of 3.66 mA cm−2, an ff of 40%, and an η of 0.79% which is still an improvement over the Al topped cell indicating a better contact between n-Cu2O and ITOsput. Though there are some considerable differences between the best measurements and the cell averages, it does indicate the possibility of improving the cell performance up to at least η = 1.06% when the optimization and consistency for cell assembly are achieved.
The observed improvement, which indicates a good Ohmic contact between ITOsput and our n-Cu2O, may seem counterintuitive as ITOcom formed Ohmic contact with our p-Cu2O. However, considering that the Fermi level of ITO can vary significantly depending on the composition and the doping level (4.3–5.2 eV), it just means that ITOsput and ITOcom used in this study have very different Fermi levels.34–36 Studies have shown that a decreased oxygen content in ITO results in lowered conductivity, transmissivity, and decreased work function.34,36 The ITOcom substrate is visibly transparent and conductive indicating a higher oxygen content and, thus, a larger work function. Our ITOsput, however, has a brown tint to its transparency and, is not as conductive as the ITOcom, indicating an oxygen deficiency and a lower work function which makes it a suitable contact for an n-type material.
The best cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/ITOsput has a VOC over 0.6 V. This indicates that the minimum difference between the Fermi level energies of our p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O is 0.6 V. As seen in Scheme 2f, this would push the Ef of the n-Cu2O layer undoubtedly to the n-type region. We surmise that the reason why the best performance was achieved by the cell: ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/ITOsput is not only because ITOcom and ITOsput are energetically more suitable to form better Ohmic contacts with p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O, respectively, than other metals, but also maybe because the oxide contact materials may form a cleaner interface with Cu2O oxide layers. Better understanding of the interface between Cu2O and the contact materials and exploring new contact materials for both the p- and n-Cu2O layers will be necessary for the further improvement of the p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells.
4. Conclusions
The results herein enabled us to locate the Fermi levels of electrochemically deposited polycrystalline p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O layers and confirm the formation of p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells. Furthermore, the importance of the use of proper contact materials in solar cell fabrication is illustrated in the improvement of the p–n Cu2O solar cell through the use of various back and front contact materials. A back illuminated solar cell is composed of a commercially available ITO back contact, a p-Cu2O layer electrodeposited from alkaline copper sulfate media, followed by an n-Cu2O layer electrodeposited from slightly acidic copper acetate, and, finally, sputtered ITO front contacts achieved a maximum VOC of 0.621 V, an ISC of 4.07 mA cm−2, an ff of 42%, and an η of 1.06% and an average VOC of 0.544 V, an ISC of 3.66 mA cm−2, an ff of 40%, and an η of 0.79% which are significant improvements over any p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cell to date. With continuing studies on optimizing the Fermi levels and the conductivity of both the electrodeposited p- and n-Cu2O layers and identifying optimum contacts to Cu2O layers that can form and maintain ideal Ohmic junctions, further improvement of the p–n Cu2O homojunction solar cells is expected.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representations of cells containing (a) a single p-Cu2O layer and (b) a p–n Cu2O homojunction used in this study. The thickness of the single p-Cu2O layer (1100 nm) was adjusted to be equal to the thickness of the p–n Cu2O homojunction (800 nm p-Cu2O and 300 nm n-Cu2O).	 

 	Scheme 2  Work functions of contacts (bottom) and approximate Fermi level energies (Ef) of Cu2O (top). (a) The Ef of p-Cu2Otherm is located between the work functions for Au and Cu. (b) The Ef of our p-Cu2Oele is located more positive than the Ef of p-Cu2Otherm. Ef of the n-Cu2O based on the VOCs obtained from (c and d) Au/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu cell, (e) ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/Cu or Al cell, and (f) ITOcom/p-Cu2O/n-Cu2O/ITOsput cell. As these Fermi level values are based on the VOCs, the true Fermi level of the n-Cu2O is expected to be closer to the CB band than what is represented by (f).

 	Fig. 3  XPS showing (a) Cu 2p3/2 peaks and (b) Cu LMM Auger peaks of (i) p-Cu2O, (ii) n-Cu2O, (iii) Cu foil, and (iv) CuO wire. Freshly prepared p-Cu2O and n-Cu2O were used for the measurements. In (a), Cu foil shows a peak for Cu2+ as well as Cu0 due to the immediate formation of a thin CuO layer on the surface upon the exposure in the air although the surface was cleaned in acid before the measurement. The arrows in (a) and (b) indicates the presence of Cu2+ in p-Cu2O and Cu0 in n-Cu2O, respectively.
