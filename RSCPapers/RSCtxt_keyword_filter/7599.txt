    , Accepted 15th March 2022First published on 15th March 2022AbstractIn the past decade, the study on organic solar cells (OSCs) has made great progress. For commercial application, achieving high efficiency OSCs with the prominent stability is a crucial issue. Here, two crosslinkable vinyl-functionalized D–A–D–D1-type polymers PM6-Ax (x: 5 or 15) were successfully synthesized by introducing a crosslinkable benzodithiophene (D1) unit with vinyl functionality into the D–A polymer PM6. As expected, the un-crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based OSC process an outstanding PCE (15.20%) without additives, which is higher than that of the reference PM6:Y6-based OSCs (13.65%) by the D–A–D–D1 strategy. It is found that polymers PM6-Ax can be crosslinked to some extent after annealing at 150 °C for a certain period of time. Meanwhile, by thermal crosslinking of the active layer, the PM6-Ax:Y6-based devices were fabricated and the stability was studied. Reference PM6:Y6-based devices were also fabricated. As a result, crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices retained 91.0% of the initial PCE under 48 h of continuous 60 °C thermal aging and 92.8% of the initial PCE under 72 h continuous white LED light illumination, whereas the reference PM6:Y6-based devices retained 81.9% and 72.7% under the same aging conditions. Moreover, crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices showed superior shelf-life stability over the reference devices. These results demonstrate that crosslinking of the PM6-A5:Y6-based active layer can significantly boost overall stability (including thermal-stability, photo-stability, and storage-stability) of the OSCs.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, organic solar cells (OSCs) have received great attention due to their advantages of flexibility, light weight, low-cost solution processing, and large-area production.1–3 Due to the rapid development of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with a narrow band gap and high absorption, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells have exceeded 18%.4–10 In particular, as a unique molecular design of A–D–A′–D–A, the electron-deficient-core-based SMAs have been rapidly developed.5,11–17 For example, the most typical A–DA′D–A type SMA is the Y6 small molecule developed by Zou combined with a typical D–A polymer donor with an outstanding PCE of 15.7%.18 However, stability is a crucial issue for commercial application of OSCs. Stability arises from water and oxygen, which can be isolated by encapsulation.19 In addition, device instability is mainly restricted by the material itself, which leads to degradation under thermal, chemical, and light exposure.20 One major issue regarding thermal degradation of non-fullerene OSCs (NFOSCs) is the microphase separation between donor and acceptor in the films resulting in the reduction of carrier mobility and charge generation, thereby decreasing device performance, shelf-life, and thermal stability.21–24
To improve the thermal stability of OSCs, crosslinking of the donor and/or acceptor is an effective method among the reported several strategies leading to the “locking” of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology in some small-molecular acceptor cells.21,25–30 In our previous work, we reported that D–A–D–D1 terpolymers (PM6-Tx) and D–A random bipolymers (PBDTa–TPDb) can significantly improve JSC and PCE values by enhancing the D–A molar ratio (>1).31–33 We also synthesized the low cost Br-functionalized BDT-based monomer as the third component (D1) into the PBDT(T)FTAZ backbone to develop D–A–D–D1 type terpolymers (PBDT(T)FTAZ-Bn) with photo-crosslinkable BDT units using the above strategy.34 Nevertheless, the impurities (Br2 or HBr) were generated during the photo- or thermal-crosslinking of Br-functionalized polymers, which might have negative effects on the device performance.25
As is well known, vinyl units can be activated by thermal annealing as a self-crosslinkable system without any initiator. Therefore, compared to the bromine group, the vinyl group only requires continuous annealing at 150 °C to ensure crosslinking without affecting the carrier mobility.35 Several polymer donors, including P3HT, PBT, PBDBT, and PBDT–TPD, have been modified by incorporating vinyl units into the terminal chain in side-chain engineering.22,35–37 These crosslinked devices exhibit superior thermal stability over the non-crosslinked reference devices, indicating the feasibility of the thermal-crosslinking strategy in stabilizing the morphology of the active layer. Besides, thermal stability, photo-stability of OSCs is important for application.24,38–42 In addition, PM6:Y6-based OSCs exhibited high efficiency.18 However, crosslinking applied in modified PM6:Y6-based OSCs for simultaneously boosting thermal stability and photo-stability has not still been reported.
Herein, a vinyl-functionalized BDT-based monomer was designed and synthesized as the third component (D1). Two thermally crosslinkable D–A–D–D1-type random polymer donors PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 were developed by using the fluorinated bis-2-ethylhexyl thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) donor unit as the D component and the typical 1,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-alkyl) benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) acceptor unit as the A component. The light absorption, energy levels, and thermal properties of these polymers were studied comprehensively. Meanwhile, the devices based these crosslinkable polymers were fabricated, and the thermal-, photo- and storage stability were studied. As expected, the un-crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs possess an outstanding PCE (15.20%) without additives, which is higher than that of the reference PM6:Y6-based OSCs (13.65%) using the D–A–D–D1 strategy. More importantly, by employing thermal crosslinking, the overall stability (including thermal-, photo-, and storage stability) of PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs can be obviously enhanced for further achieving the potential commercialization of OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
Synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), bis(trimethylstannyl)-substituted BDT–TF was the first donor unit (D), vinyl-functionalized BDT-based monomer was the second donor unit (D1), while BDD–2Br was the acceptor unit (A). By controlling the molar feed ratio of BDT–TF:BDTOA–2Br:BDD–2Br, two novel D–A–D–D1 type thermal-crosslinkable vinyl-functionalized polymers PM6-Ax (PM6-A5, PM6-A15) were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization, in which x% represents the molar content of BDTOA–2Br, the corresponding structure was shown in Fig. 1a. The vinyl units attached to the polymer chains for the polymer thermal crosslinking. Meanwhile, the prominent polymer donor PM6 was synthesized as reference. Here PM6 was selected as the reference donor and Y6 as the acceptor because of their high PCE value and good applicability as donor and acceptor, respectively.18,42–47

The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) by gel permeation chromatography under a high temperature of 150 °C were measured as 20.5 kg mol−1 and 3.01 (for PM6), 32.9 kg mol−1 and 2.71 (for PM6-A5), 35.5 kg mol−1 and 2.85 (for PM6-A15), respectively. These polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB).
In order to ascertain the actual BDTOA–2Br unit content incorporated into the PM6-Ax polymers, 1H NMR characterization and elemental analysis were carried out. The detailed characterization data are provided in the ESI,† while the corresponding values are estimated and shown in the Experimental section.
In thermo-gravimetric analyses (Fig. S5, ESI†), the 5% weight loss decomposition temperatures (Td) of the polymers were 397, 390, and 385 °C for PM6, PM6-A5, and PM6-A15, respectively, indicating that these polymers exhibit good thermal stability.
2.2 The electrochemical and optical properties

Fig. 1b and Fig. S6 (ESI†) present the UV-vis absorption spectra of three donor polymers and the acceptor Y6 in films and chloroform solutions, respectively. It is shown that these polymer donors match well with the acceptor Y6. The relevant data are listed in Table 1. Both UV-vis absorption spectra of PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 have two characteristic absorption bands in CF solution and film. The absorption bands at 320–400 nm are attributed to the π → π* transition of the conjugated backbone, and those of 450–650 nm are attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BDT-F, BDD, and BDTOA units.48 The absorption edges of PM6, PM6-A5, and PM6-A15 films are located at around 726, 674, and 663 nm, respectively, and their corresponding optical band gaps are 1.71, 1.84, and 1.86 eV, respectively. From the CF solution to the film, only slightly red-shifted absorption bands are observed in PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 absorption, indicating the similar π–π stacking and intermolecular interaction in films and solutions. With the increasing content of BDTOA units, the absorption edges and absorption peaks are gradually blue-shifted in both films and solutions, owing to high electron-donating ability of alkoxy of the BDTOA unit. Additionally, compared to PM6-A5, the 0–1 transition peak of PM6-A15 is strengthened in the film and the chloroform solution, which indicates the decrease of stacking push–pull interaction by the random terpolymer strategy.47

The electronic energy levels of PM6-Ax polymers and Y6 small molecules were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the corresponding curves are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). According to the empirical equation EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.44) V, ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred + 4.44) V, and the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.56, −5.60, −5.63, and −5.67 eV for PM6, PM6-A5, PM6-A15, and Y6, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, the corresponding LUMO energy levels of PM6, PM6-A5, PM6-A15, and Y6 were calculated to be −3.48, −3.34, −3.26, and −4.08 eV, respectively, and the result was also in good agreement with density functional theory calculations (DFT) (Fig. S8, ESI†). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed in the B3LYP-D3/6-31 + G(d,p) basis set.49–51 The Gaussian 09 program is used to calculate and manage input files, while the long side chains are replaced by methyl chains for simplifying the calculations. With the increase of BDTOA units, the HOMO energy level of donor will gradually downshift, which is beneficial for the extraction of holes from Y6 to the donor, while the slight LUMO energy level of PM6-A5 upshifted compared to PM6, which would provide a greater driving force to dissociate more exciton force to boost the JSC.
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
In order to explore the photovoltaic properties obtained by introducing the third component (BDTOA) into the polymer PM6, OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/PM6-Ax:Y6/PDINN/Ag were fabricated, where aliphatic amine-functionalized perylene-diimide (PDINN) as the electron transport layer material was reported by Li and Zhang's group.52 The active layers with a D/A ratio (w/w = 1:1.2) were prepared via spin-coating a chloroform solution with a total solid concentration of 16 mg mL−1 and then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. It is worth noting that we have not used any additive because it usually has a detrimental effect on the thermal stability.53 As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Table 2, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and related photovoltaic parameters of all OSCs are summarized for displaying the detailed information. By introducing a small amount of BDTOA units, the gradual blue shift of UV-vis absorption spectra will better complement the absorption spectra of the Y6 acceptor than PM6, while the slight downward shift of the HOMO energy level is also more beneficial for the extraction of holes from Y6 to the donor, hence increasing the light current of PM6-A5:Y6-based devices. However, for the PM6-A15:Y6-based devices, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is significantly lower than that of PM6-A5:Y6-based devices, because the LUMO energy level of PM6-A15 is upshifted too much, resulting in excessive non-radiative energy loss (Eloss); the relative Eloss is shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Therefore, the PM6-A5:Y6-based device shows an outstanding PCE of 15.20% (higher than reference PM6:Y6-based devices) and a significantly elevated JSC, which indicates that our D–A–D–D1 strategy is still effective for boosting the PCE in OSCs.

To further investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection process of the devices based on PM6-Ax series, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured for five optimal devices, and the corresponding definition of parameters and calculation methods are provided in the ESI.†Jph–Veff curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The related data of calculation and summarization include the saturation current (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss: Jsc/Jsat value under the short-circuit conditions) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll: Jmpp/Jsat values under the maximum power output conditions) are shown in Table S2 (ESI†).54 It can be observed in Table S2 (ESI†) that the Pdiss/Pcoll values are 98.51%/89.12%, 98.76%/90.63%, and 97.52%/89.65% for the PM6:Y6-based device, PM6-A5:Y6-based device, and PM6-A15:Y6-based device, respectively. The PM6-A5:Y6-based device exhibits the highest Pdiss value and Pcoll value, indicating that PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs possess more effective exciton generation and dissociation in addition to more efficient charge extraction, which could explain the improved JSC and FF value of PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs.55,56
2.4 Thermal-crosslinking behavior and the effects on performance and thermal stability

2.4.1 Investigation of the crosslinking ability of PM6-A5 and PM6-A15. 
It has been reported that terminal vinyl-attached polymers can be crosslinked when heated at 150 °C.36,57 In this work, thermal-crosslinking was carried out by thermal-annealing at 150 °C for 1.5 h. To investigate the insoluble portion after thermal-crosslinking, the PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 films were rinsed with CB for 60 s by spin-coating CB on the surface of the polymer film with and without thermal-crosslinking, and then the UV-vis absorption spectra before and after rinsing are shown in Fig. 2. Both PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 are almost entirely dissolved in CB without thermal crosslinking. After thermal crosslinking, both PM6-A5 and PM6-A15 films show relatively high solvent resistance.
 Fig. 2  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of the PM6-A5 film before and after rinsing and (b) UV-vis absorption spectra of the PM6-A15 film before and after rinsing. 
The remaining fraction after rinsing was estimated by integration of absorbance. Then, as shown in Fig. 2, the PM6-A15 film retained higher absorbance (67.35% of the initial absorbance) than the PM6-A5 film (54.96%), implying that the degree of thermal-crosslinking of PM6-Ax increases with the vinyl content. Meanwhile, the results show that a 5% vinyl content is sufficient for active crosslinking of some polymer (PM6-Ax) chains upon the 1.5 h heat treatment. To evaluate the degree of thermal-crosslinking of the blend films, we further measured UV-vis absorption spectra of the thermally annealed PM6-A5:Y6 and PM6-A15:Y6 blend films before and after rinsing. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the thermally annealed PM6-A5:Y6 blend film retained 17.63% of the initial absorbance, while the thermally annealed PM6-A15:Y6 blend film retained 23.41%.


2.4.2 Thermal stability. 
Firstly, we explore the thermal stability of BHJ active layers based crosslinkable PM6-Ax:Y6. The active layers were spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS, and the substrates were annealed at 150 °C for different times on a hot plate inside a N2 glove box prior to the deposition of PDINN/Ag. For a comparison, the reference devices based on PM6: Y6 were fabricated under the same conditions. The fabrication condition is as follows: polymer concentration: 16 mg mL−1; mass ratio: PM6-Ax:Y6 = 1:1.2; solvent: CHCl3. The devices performances at regular intervals during 49.5 h were measured to uncover the effect of continuous 150 °C annealing on the different active layers after crosslinking, and the corresponding average data obtained for 8 devices are summarized in Table 3. Here, thermal annealing was carried out at 150 °C for 1.5 h to crosslink crosslinkable PM6-Ax based active layers. The normalized PCE profiles (the PCE value after 1.5 h annealing at 150 °C as an initial value) plotted against the time of thermal treatment (150 °C) and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3, and EQE spectra are displayed in Fig. S12 (ESI†).

 Fig. 3  Current–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based Y6 for three systems (a) PM6, (b) PM6-A5 and (c) PM6-A15. (d) Normalized PCE against the annealing time at 150 °C. 
After annealing at 150 °C for 1.5 h, the PCE value for PM6:Y6-based devices drop from 13.37% to 12.02%, while the values for PM6-A5:Y6-based devices (13.85% → 11.81%) and PM6-A15:Y6-based devices (12.34% → 10.63%) decline more. After crosslinking, FF drops more obviously and Jsc values did not drop. However, after 49.5 hours of continuous thermal annealing at 150 °C, the PM6-A5:Y6-based devices and PM6-A15:Y6-based devices declined slowly to be thermally well crosslinked. With increasing annealing time (up to 49.5 h), it is interesting to observe that the JSC values of the PM6-A5:Y6-based devices (26.04 → 26.50 mAcm−2) and PM6-A15:Y6-based OSCs (23.12 → 24.66 mA cm−2) increase slightly and the FF values decrease slowly compared to the PM6:Y6-based OSCs. As shown in Fig. 3d, the retention value is 79.7% for PM6:Y6-based devices, while the retention values for PM6-A5:Y6-based and PM6-A15:Y6-based devices are 90.1% and 91.9% after 49.5 h annealing at 150 °C, respectively. Compared to PM6:Y6-based devices, thermally crosslinkable PM6-A5 and PM6-A15:Y6-based devices exhibit an excellent thermal stability at high temperature (150 °C), indicating that thermal crosslinking of an active layer can significantly improve the thermal stability.
To further study in more detail, during thermal treatment at 150 °C, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to study the nanoscale morphology of blend films based PM6-A5:Y6, PM6-A15:Y6, and PM6:Y6 under no annealing, 1.5 h annealing, 49.5 h annealing at 150 °C, respectively. The height, phase and 3D images of AFM are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S13 and 14 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4, for both PM6-A5:Y6 and PM6-A15:Y6 blends, the non-crosslinked film (no annealing) and crosslinked films (1.5 h annealing) had similar surface morphologies to similar root-mean-square (RMS) values, which indicated that thermal crosslinking had no obviously effect on the surface morphology of the films. In Fig. 4a, d, and g, three blend films without annealing show a uniform texture with an RMS roughness of 1.08–1.38 nm. In particular, the PM6-A5-based blend film shows the smoothest surfaces with an RMS roughness of 1.08 nm and uniform morphology, which means that the introduction of a small amount of BDTOA units into the PM6 backbone improved the miscibility with Y6 in the BHJ blend, thus enhancing the photocurrent density of devices. After 1.5 h of annealing time for crosslinking, slightly bigger aggregations were observed in PM6-A5:Y6 and PM6-A15:Y6 films, explaining why the PCE values dropped after a short time heat treatment. However, with the annealing time increased to 49.5 h, two phase nano interpenetration and no obvious aggregates were observed in PM6-A5:Y6 and PM6-A15:Y6 films, implying that most of polymer chains were locked and excessive aggregation was avoided via thermal crosslinking. By contrast, the RMS value of PM6:Y6 blend film increased with increasing annealing time. Although a short annealing time might affect the morphology slightly, a long annealing time eventually destroyed the morphology of the PM6:Y6 blend film. Therefore, after 49.5 h aging, the big polymer aggregates with poor two-phase separation were clearly visible in PM6:Y6 film because the unstable BHJ blends separated under thermal stress. For the crosslinkable PM6-Ax:Y6, when active layer crosslinking occurred, the interpenetrating network structure was fixed to some extent, and then the stability of the active layer morphology can be maintained after long time annealing, thus maintaining the device performance.

Next, we further explore the effect of crosslinking on the thermal stability of the un-encapsulated devices. Crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based and as-cast PM6:Y6-based devices were selected to test their performance under thermal stress. The evaluation of device stability was carried out on a hot plate at 60 °C inside a N2 glove box and the device performance was tested at regular intervals (0, 1 h, …48 h) during 48 h. The normalized PCE profiles against the annealing time at 60 °C are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding device performances are shown in Table 4 (corresponding J–V curves and EQE spectra shown in Fig. S15, ESI†). It can be observed that after 1 h of annealing time, the PCE of PM6:Y6-based devices declined significantly from 13.37% to 12.65%, while the PCE of the crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6 devices was almost stable (11.81% → 11.72%). Upon prolonging the annealing time to 48 h, the JSC value (26.04 → 25.82 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.77 → 0.76 V) value of the crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices still maintained a steady state, and FF values slightly decreased. After aging for 48 h, the PCE of crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices exhibited a high retention of 91.0% of the initial PCE value. By contrast, the PCE of the reference devices decreased to 81.9% of the initial PCE, due to the sharp drop in device parameters, especially in respect of JSC and FF. These results further demonstrate that the crosslinking of active layers is beneficial to retain the device performance under long time thermal stress. The better interface contacts between the crosslinked active layer and transport interface layer may contribute to the superior thermal stability for crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs. Moreover, crosslinking of the active layer can stabilize the morphology and inhibit aggregation resulting in good thermal stability.58,59

2.4.3 Photo-stability and shelf-life stability. 
To investigate the effects of the thermal-crosslinking on the photostability of the devices, we exposed the un-encapsulated devices to continuous illumination of a white LED (12 mW cm−2) under N2 conditions at room temperature. The characteristic photovoltaic parameters against time are shown in Table 5, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). It is worth noting that the PCE of PM6:Y6-based devices declined obviously (13.37% to 10.95%) at LED illumination for 1 h while, the PCE of crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices maintains stable values (11.81% to 11.11%). Then, under continuous LED illumination for 72 hours, the VOC slowly decreased (0.77 to 0.75 V) for crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices. The striking difference between crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based and PM6:Y6-based devices upon exposure to LED light can also be intuitively observed in Fig. 6a. After 72 hours of continuous illumination, the PCE of crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6 still retained a high value (92.8% of its initial value) without obvious burn-in efficiency loss, whereas the PCE of the reference PM6:Y6-based devices obviously degraded and only retained 72.7% of the initial PCE, owing to the sharp drop in VOC and FF values. The photo-stability of crosslinked devices is obviously better than that of the reference devices. The reason for the improved photo-stability of crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices might be as follows: (1) crosslinking of the active layer could freeze some initial morphology and prevent penetration between the active layer and the transport interface layer;58–60 (2) the S–O interaction existing in some incorporated BDTOA units could reduce the loss of conjugation of BDT units and side chain breakage to a certain extent under long time light irradiation, which could suppress photo-degradation to a certain extent resulting in better photo-stability.58,61,62

 Fig. 6  (a) Photostability of the PM6:Y6-based and crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs, and the light intensity of white LED is 12 mW cm−2. (b) Shelf-life stability of the OSCs with the PM6:Y6 crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based OSCs. 
The shelf-life stability of the OSCs without encapsulation was studied under N2 conditions up to 60 days, and the corresponding parameters variation in the OSCs are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6b, after the long-term storage period of up to 60 days, the PCE of crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices maintained 89.8% of the initial PCE, whereas the PCE of the reference PM6:Y6-based devices only retained 68.5% of the initial PCE under the same time. Owing to the “locking” morphology by active layer crosslinking, the crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices show excellent storage stability.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new vinyl-functionalized monomer (BDTOA–2Br) was synthesized as the third component (D1) for modifying the alternate D–A copolymer PM6 backbone, and two crosslinkable D–A–D–D1-type polymers (PM6-A5 and PM6-A15) were developed using the terpolymer strategy. The un-crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices exhibited a PCE of 15.20% without additives, which was higher than that of the reference PM6:Y6-based OSCs (13.65%). What is more, the polymers PM6-Ax can be crosslinked at a certain degree to freeze some initial morphology after long-time annealing at 150 °C. It is found that the crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices retained 91.0% of its initial PCE under 48 h of continuous aging at 60 °C and retained 92.8% of its initial PCE 72 h of continuous white LED light illumination, whereas the reference PM6:Y6-based devices retained 81.9% and 72.7% under the same aging conditions. Meanwhile, crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices showed superior shelf-life stability over the reference devices. Thus, crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices exhibit excellent stability (including thermal-, photo- and storage-stability) owing to the crosslinking of the vinyl-functionalized polymer PM6-A5-based active layer. Moreover, the relatively high efficiency (a PCE approaching 11%) was obtained in crosslinked PM6-A5:Y6-based devices after long time heat treatment or light exposure. Our study would provide a new strategy to modify the prominent polymers for developing high-performance, long-life OSCs for future commercial applications of OSCs.
