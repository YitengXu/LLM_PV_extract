Broader context
In this work, we found that the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency was greatly enhanced to a record value of 13.5% by the coupling induction of a GeSe-film-based solar thermal energy storage and conversion cell with a GeSe-film-based solar water-splitting photoelectrode. This is the first report of such high and record STH efficiency for hydrogen production via the comprehensive utilization of photo-thermal and photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this work, we found that the GeSe MAB film presented excellent photo-thermal response properties. After combining a Bi2Te3 thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode, the integrated device achieved a great increase in the utilization efficiency of the wasted solar thermal energy. The integrated GeSe-based device also acts as a solar thermal energy storage cell; the integrated GeSe-based device absorbed infrared solar light and stored it as thermal energy with the solar light illumination time, while the TEG converted the thermal energy into electric power. This electric power could also be recycled and added to the GeSe photoelectrode for enhanced overall water splitting. Finally, the GeSe-TEG integrated device could directly split water without any additional bias under only solar light irradiation, and a record solar to hydrogen efficiency of 13.5% was achieved.

Introduction
Solar water-splitting for hydrogen production is considered a promising approach to delay the energy crisis caused by the shortage of fossil fuels.1,2 Storing solar energy in hydrogen bonds via a photoelectrochemical (PEC) process is a popular way to achieve zero carbon emissions.3 Semiconductors with cost competitiveness, e.g., typical photoanodes such as TiO2,4 Fe2O3,5 BiVO4,6–8 and WO3,9 have emerged with simple preparation methods and excellent stability, but exhibit limited solar spectrum absorption due to their wide bandgap. To achieve efficient hydrogen generation, compound photovoltaic semiconductors such as GaAs10 and GaN11 have been widely adopted with a benchmark solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH). In recent years, chalcogenide photovoltaic semiconductors such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS),12 Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)13 and Cu3BiS3 (CBS)14 with proper bandgaps (1.4–1.8 eV) have achieved several milestones in solar water-splitting, but secondary phases such as Cu2S were reported to have a negative effect on the open circuit voltage, carrier lifetime, and fill factor of the photovoltaics (PVs). Additionally, MoS2, which is often formed at the interface between the Mo substrate and chalcogenide film during sulfurization, exhibits adverse effects in the film formation process, resulting in high-density voids and cracks and changing the stoichiometry of the original materials. These disadvantages have also restricted further improvement in their STH efficiency. In recent years, excellent binary compound photovoltaic semiconductors, such as Sb2Se3 and GeSe have been widely reported as a promising solar water splitting materials because of single material phase and thermodynamically stable crystal structure.
Moon and his group first reported significant solar water-splitting performance based on the Sb2Se3 photoelectrode,15–17 and various other groups have also provided impressive continuous studies.18,19 In 2019, we first prepared GeSe films consisting of unique micro air brick (MAB) crystals, and these GeSe MAB-based photoelectrodes presented appreciable PEC water-splitting properties.20 Although several interesting optical application results based on sheet-like two-dimensional structured GeSe have been reported, the MAB-structured GeSe film should have important optical application potential compared with the reported sheet- and rod-like two-dimensional-like structure. As a result, we were excited to find that the MAB-based GeSe film presented a quite interesting solar thermal response: the temperature of the GeSe MAB-based film in an open air environment (without any temperature protection treatment) increased from room temperature to 93 °C with a solar light irradiation time of only 120 s (Video S1, ESI†). This fast and efficient solar thermal response property of the GeSe MAB-based film should be very promising for many applications, such as solar water heaters or solar thermal power generation. In this work, for the first time, we used the solar thermal response feature of a GeSe MAB-based film to assist the solar water-splitting reaction itself. Combining a Bi2Te3 thermal electronic electrode with a GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode significantly enhanced the application of the solar spectrum from 400–2500 nm. The synergistic coupling effect of solar thermal and photoelectrochemical water-splitting is very interesting for the promotion of the efficiency of GeSe MAB-based films for solar hydrogen evolution. It was found that the solar thermal energy captured by the GeSe MABs could be transformed into electrical power by the Bi2Te3 electrode, which can also be recycled/added to the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode to assist the solar water-splitting reactions. The solar thermal energy could be transformed into an additional electrical bias of approximately 1.52 V on the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode itself, which significantly improves the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of the GeSe photoelectrode. The Bi2Te3 thermal electric electrode integrated with the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode (Bi2Te3–GeSe MABs) could directly split water without any additional bias under only solar light irradiation, and the Bi2Te3–GeSe MAB photoelectrode presented a remarkable and record STH efficiency of over 13.5% after a preheating process of ∼1500 s.
In general, there are currently three types of solar water-splitting photoelectrodes: The first is single photoelectrodes; however, a single photoelectrode can only absorb a specific region of solar light based on its bandgap, and an applied bias is essential to operate the solar water-splitting reaction.14,20,21 The second is tandem cells, which include a photocathode and photoanode (dual photoelectrode: 4 mol of electrons for 1 mol of H2, called the D4 mode), which can operate solar water-splitting without an external bias. A calculated tandem system is carefully designed with a dual light absorber (a photocathode with a narrow bandgap (1–1.3 eV) for hydrogen generation and a photoanode with a wide bandgap (∼1.8 eV) for oxygen production) in tandem illumination mode to achieve as much light absorption as possible.13–15,22 However, this type of tandem configuration is limited by unsuitable bandgaps, band positions and charge transfer characteristics, and the achieved STH efficiencies are far from the theoretical value. For most cases of D4, the STH efficiency is below 3%.12,15,21,23,24 The third unbiased solar water-splitting configuration is photovoltaic-photoelectrochemical (PV-PEC) tandem cells. As shown in Fig. 1, researchers can flexibly choose semitransparent photoelectrodes for use in front of PVs, such as BiVO4-perovskite solar cells (PSCs),25–28 BiVO4-Si,29–31 Fe2O3-dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),32 BiVO4-Fe2O3-2p Si,33 Cu2O-PSC,34 Ta3N5-CuInSe35 and so on, or photoelectrodes for use behind transparent PVs, such as Sb2Se3-2PSG,36 Si-PSC37 and CIGS-PSC.38 This PV-PEC configuration can usually achieve a promising STH efficiency of over 5%. To achieve a higher STH efficiency, integrated tandem cells with buried-junction-type photoelectrodes or multijunction solar cells are often adopted for more efficient light absorption. Based on the three solar water-splitting configurations mentioned above (single photoelectrode with an external bias cell, dual photoelectrode unbiased tandem cell and PV-PEC construction), we find that almost all types of photoelectrodes for solar water-splitting only focus on the part that could motivate the minority carrier from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and the concomitant thermal energy is usually ignored. Several reported studies based on utilization of this thermal energy in PVs have obtained a considerable improvement in the PCE.39–42 In this work, we found that the bottleneck in the STH efficiency may be caused by the waste of infrared light, because the application of infrared light gives a substantial improvement in the STH efficiency of the photoelectrode. The Bi2Te3–GeSe MAB photoelectrode in this work presented a champion STH efficiency of over 13.5%, which is highly competitive among the record values reported previously, as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, the actual demonstration of large-scale unbiased solar water-splitting devices is rare. Because of the laboratory scale, which is limited by technology development, the enlarged resistance of the substrate is often designed to be below 1 cm2 for PV-PEC configurations.25–29,31–38,43–47 In this work, a competitive geometric device size of 16 cm2 was prepared with an STH efficiency of over 13.5%, benefiting from the lack of a size-limited thermal evaporation process and the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of silver.

Results and discussion
In this work, a GeSe film consisting of a hollow, vertically grown two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet was fabricated via the thermal sublimation process of purchased GeSe powder in a graphite box. In our previous works, we named this novel construction a micro air brick structure (MAB), and the optimal temperature and deposition time for this light trapping structure were found to be 530 °C and 120 s, respectively.20 As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), in the XRD pattern of the obtained GeSe film and GeSe powder, all the diffraction peaks matched well with orthorhombic GeSe corresponding to the JCPDS 48-1226 without impurity phases, revealing that the thermal sublimation process did not change the stoichiometry and a high-crystallinity GeSe film was prepared. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of the GeSe MABs indicated that the prepared GeSe possessed an appreciable crystalline quality with a measured interplanar distance of 2.9 Å, which corresponds to the (011) planes of the orthorhombic GeSe. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to further confirm the state of the elements Ge and Se. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the detected signal of Ge shows two 3d peaks at 31.63 eV (3d3/2) and 29.58 eV (3d5/2), which match well with the expected binding energy of GeSe. Analogously, the XPS spectrum of Se 3d further confirmed that Se was in the expected valance state of Ge2+Se2−.
As shown in Fig. 2a, this typical light trap morphology was assembled of hollow nanosheets with interlayer gap structures. The wide spacing gap distribution can efficiently absorb the spectral range of incident light from 400 nm to 2500 nm because of the subwavelength effect.48–50 In addition, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the thickness of the GeSe MAB film was determined to be ∼5 μm, and more interlayers and pores were observed inside the film, revealing more possibilities for light-trapping in the hollow film. It is known that for a thin film with a labyrinthine internal structure, the incident light will be reflected multiple times until it is completely absorbed at the end (inset of Fig. 2a). Therefore, this kind of material naturally has a promisingly high incident light absorptivity. To our knowledge, the 5–10% reflectivity (Fresnel reflection) is caused by the refractive index difference at the interface between air and the solid materials. This phenomenon could be improved by introducing long and low-density nanostructures with an increasing number of deeper pores.50 All of the above evidence shows that GeSe MABs are ideal light-absorbing materials that can significantly reduce light reflectivity and enhance light absorption capacity. The hemispherical (specular-diffuse) absorptivity of the GeSe MAB films in the wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm was detected to be over 90% (Fig. 2b).

(c) Schematic diagram of the photothermal mechanism of the GeSe MABs. (d) Infrared images of GeSe MABs/Mo sheet under AM 1.5 G incident light for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 s, respectively. (The GeSe loaded sheet was placed on a polyurethane board to prevent heat loss.) 
In addition, a GeSe film with a flat morphology was prepared by a vacuum thermal evaporation method. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the approximately 1.4 micron thick GeSe film presents a flat surface morphology, and its surface is smooth even at 150000× magnification. Furthermore, the light absorptivity of this flat GeSe film was also measured to be lower than that of GeSe MABs in the same light spectrum range (Fig. S6, ESI†).
The excellent light trapping feature of this GeSe MAB film could be attributed to two reasons: (i) The absorption in the 400–1100 nm wavelength range is due to the narrow band gap (1.1 eV) of GeSe, and photocharges are generated due to intrinsic absorption. (ii) The absorption in the second part (1100–2500 nm) is due to the wide size region distribution of the interlayers and pores on the surface and inside the GeSe MAB film with a subwavelength effect, and considerable light absorption is achieved. In addition, we found that the GeSe films fabricated by the rapid box thermal deposition (RBTD) method using various temperatures exhibited little difference in reflectivity, which indicated that RBTD is a favorable method for the fabrication of the light trapping coating.
In recent years, semiconductors have received great attention as new emerging photothermal conversion materials. Since most photons from incident sunlight have higher energy than the band gap, electron–hole pairs above the band gap are generated (which are called above-bandgap electron–hole pairs).51,52 A schematic diagram of the photothermal mechanism is shown in Fig. 2c. A process called thermalization occurred on the GeSe film, in which electron–hole pairs above the bandgap relax to the band edge, and the extra energy is converted into heat through impurities, defects, or surface dangling bonds.51 Therefore, the GeSe MAB film was predicted to be an excellent light-to-thermal conversion material. As mentioned above, we attributed the excellent light-to-thermal conversion performance of the GeSe MAB film partly to the narrow band gap (400–1100 nm wavelength region). In addition, we found that GeSe also has a very significant light absorption capacity in the infrared region of 1100–2500 nm. Due to the subwavelength structure of the GeSe film, incident light is reflected many times inside the nanohollow structure and finally converted into heat energy in the form of lattice vibrations, similar to carbon-based photothermal materials.53–56 Therefore, we believe that GeSe MABs are a very ideal photothermal production material. Infrared images of the GeSe MAB-based film with different solar light illumination times are shown in Fig. 2d. The surface temperature of the GeSe MAB-based film increased rapidly to a maximum value of 92 °C after only 130 s of simulated solar light illumination (Video S1, ESI†). Moreover, based on the statistical plot of five GeSe/Mo samples in Fig. S7 (ESI†), we found that the average heating rate of this photothermal material is over 30 °C min−1, indicating that the GeSe MAB-based film is an excellent photothermal production/conversion material.

Fig. 3a shows the configuration of the integrated PTV cell that was used to evaluate the photothermal–voltage conversion performance of the GeSe/TEG and provided the practical equipment for transferring solar energy into electrical energy. In contrast to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells, which only use the irradiated light from a high-temperature (over 800 °C) body,57,58 this PTV cell can efficiently utilize a low-temperature body (below 100 °C) produced by solar light irradiation.

(a) Illustration of the PTV cell. This device includes a water bath thermostat (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) for cooling the cold side of the TEG with tap water maintained at ∼17 °C, a waterproof/insulation gasket, a thermoelectric generator (TEG, TEC-56382), a GeSe film-coated Mo plate seamlessly glued on the hot side of the TEG (GeSe/TEG) with silver paste and a solar glass window.

(d) The output voltage response curve of the GeSe/TEG with 100 mW cm−2 illumination and 17 °C running water. (e) Output voltage–time curve of the GeSe/TEG PTV cell (inset picture shows the actual application of this output voltage). 
In this work, we prepared a GeSe film on a molybdenum sheet instead of a molybdenum electrode on a glass substrate because molybdenum possesses better thermal conductivity (138 W m−1 K−1) than quartz (2.01 W m−1 K−1). A Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric generator (TEG) was chosen to convert the heat energy that was generated from the GeSe MABs under solar light illumination into electricity. The details of this PTV cell are shown in Fig. 3a. We bonded GeSe/Mo and TEG together with silver paste (thermal conductivity, 420 W m−1 K−1) so that the GeSe MABs could heat the hot side of the TEG quickly and avoid heat loss as much as possible. A large water tank (60 × 60 × 60 cm) was used to maintain a stable temperature of room temperature (17 °C) at the cold side with running tap water, and the temperature of the running water in the laboratory was determined with a video from an infrared thermal imager (Video S2, ESI†).
The surface temperature of TEG and GeSe/TEG was also measured using an infrared thermal imager. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, we took infrared thermal images of TEG and GeSe/TEG at different simulated solar light illumination times. The illuminated surface of TEG is a milky white ceramic sheet (inset is the photograph of TEG), which has high reflection of incident light. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the surface temperature response curves of GeSe/TEG and TEG, respectively. The surface temperature of TEG increased slowly and slightly to a final temperature of 28 °C after 2.5 min under continuous illumination. In sharp contrast, the surface temperature of the GeSe/TEG device rose rapidly from 17 °C to 43 °C under the same measurement conditions as TEG. The active area (GeSe film surface area = 4 cm × 4 cm) of the GeSe/TEG surface looks black (inset photograph in Fig. 2c) and has an extremely high absorption (∼100%) over a wide range of incident light (400–2500 nm). Therefore, it possessed a higher and faster surface temperature response than bare TEG, and even compared to other reported photothermal materials such as carbon-based materials,50 polymers,59 metallic materials60 and semiconductors.61 The output power of the TEG and GeSe/TEG was characterized using a two-electrode method. Corresponding to the temperature variation trend under light radiation, the voltage–time curve of TEG in Fig. 3d shows a slight increase from 0 V to −0.12 V with an 11 °C temperature difference after 2.5 min, while the output voltage of GeSe/TEG reached over −1.222 V. Obviously, this tenfold improvement in output voltage is mainly due to the outstanding photothermal conversion ability of GeSe and its direct contact with the TEG. The durability of GeSe/TEG was also characterized under AM 1.5 G for 150 h, and the output voltage was maintained at −1.222 V without distinct attenuation, indicating that GeSe possessed satisfactory light stability. In addition, the output voltage and current were also measured to evaluate the output power and solar conversion efficiency of this GeSe-based PTV cell. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the output voltages varied from 1.222 V to 0.983 V, accompanied by variation in the output current from 0.143 A to 0.097 A.
This output power generated by sunlight can be used for actual production, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3e. We used two GeSe/TEG devices connected in series to light up the SCNU logo and provide power for a small electric fan with a rated voltage of 1.5 V. The ideal output voltage and stability would provide a guarantee for the more practical application of GeSe/TEG. In addition, we also found that the GeSe/TEG device provided more than 0.6 V (Fig. S10, ESI†) under simulated solar light irradiation throughout the day in an outdoor natural environment without cooling water, i.e., under environmental air cooling (10:00 AM–18:00 PM, 15th Mar. 2022, Guangzhou, China), indicating that this integrated GeSe/TEG device performs well in many real application environments. Despite the excellent output performance achieved with the assistance of coolants such as water or air, these cheap and easily available natural resources would not restrict the development of PTVs but instead create a new way to utilize solar energy like PVs.
In recent years, solar thermoelectric generators have been widely reported to improve the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells.39–41 Solar cells inevitably produce waste heat under working conditions. Using waste heat to improve the output power of solar cells is a reasonable method. Compared with solar cells, both semiconductors and water can absorb the infrared part of light in the solar water-splitting process, thus utilizing more heat to provide a higher output voltage. Therefore, the PTV-PEC integrated cell for solar water-splitting is a very interesting and efficient method.
GeSe has also been reported as a promising PEC water-splitting material for generating hydrogen in our previous works, with a record photocurrent density (at 0 VRHE), onset potential and promising applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 15 mA cm−2, 0.45 VRHE and 1.45%, respectively.62 In this work, we chose the configuration of Pt/TiO2/GeSe to simultaneously act as a difunctional thin film for hydrogen production and solar light-to-thermal conversion. The atomic layer deposition method (ALD) was used to cover a 50 nm TiO2 conformal film onto the surface of GeSe to form a p–n junction for efficient separation of the electron–hole pairs. The surface and cross-section morphology of TiO2/GeSe are shown in Fig. 4a and b. It can clearly be seen that the typical MAB nanostructure with a large number of pores and interlayer structures is preserved. The cross-sectional morphology shown in Fig. 4b indicates that the GeSe MABs grew vertically with an average thickness of 5 μm, and solar light was easily trapped inside the deep micro air bricks (as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a). High-magnification images of the TiO2/GeSe MABs are shown in the inset of Fig. 4b. TiO2 fully passivates the GeSe MAB surface, and the conformal coverage does not change the inherent morphology of the GeSe MABs. More interestingly, a TiO2 layer prepared by the atomic layer deposition method has been reported as an anti-reflection thin film,63 which means that the TiO2 coverage adopted on the GeSe MABs would further reduce the surface light reflectance, enhance light absorptivity and promote light-to-heat performance. Therefore, in this work, ALD-TiO2 was chosen not only to accelerate the separation rate of the photoexcited carriers but also to decrease the surface incident light reflectance of the GeSe MABs. First, we measured the light absorptivity performance of the bare GeSe MAB and TiO2-covered GeSe MAB films. As shown in Fig. 4c, we found that the light absorptivity of TiO2/GeSe MABs exhibited a certain degree of increase compared with that of bare GeSe MABs because of the rougher surface morphology of GeSe MABs after modification by ALD-TiO2. We also found that the GeSe MAB film and TiO2/GeSe MABs both appeared darker in the wet state (Fig. S12, ESI†). This feature is universal in black-body materials. As described by Wang et al., “This dark underwater property can be explained by the fact that the solid/air interface is replaced by the solid/water interface after the wet pore space is filled with water, which significantly reduces the strong subsurface light scattering in the dry state.”64 In fact, GeSe-based photoelectrodes are usually immersed in electrolytes when adopted for solar water-splitting. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of GeSe MABs and their reflectance of light under wet conditions are worth researching. Specifically, the measured contact angle of electrolyte droplets on TiO2/GeSe MAB samples is only 17.5°, which means that a hydrophilic surface was formed (Fig. S13, ESI†). Notably, the wetting properties of the TiO2/GeSe MAB photoelectrode were considered to enhance electron transfer at the electrolyte–semiconductor interface. In addition, it has been reported that wetting properties can also reduce the overpotential of the HER process.65,66 The surface reflectance of the TiO2/GeSe MAB photoelectrode in the dry and wet states was then measured. As shown in Fig. 4c, the absorptivity of wet samples in the wavelength range of 400–2500 nm is close to 100%, which is higher than that of dry samples. That is, the GeSe photoelectrode under working conditions (immersed in water for solar water-splitting) shows a higher surface temperature and larger output voltage.

In this PTV-PEC device, the output performance of the TEG was promoted by the surface temperature of the hot side (GeSe photocathode). Overall water-splitting would not be carried out until the PTV-PEC reached the operation point potential (Vop). For the TEG, this Vop is ∼1 V.

A TiO2/GeSe photoelectrode (active area of 16 cm2) and TEG were then assembled using the same process as mentioned above (Fig. 3a), and the final single-photoelectrode unbiased solar water-splitting device Pt–TiO2/GeSe/TEG (abbreviated as Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG) was obtained.
A schematic of this tandem cell is shown in Fig. 4d. The cathode (gray wire) and anode (red wire) of the thermoelectric generator were connected to the photocathode (for hydrogen evolution) and DSA (for oxygen evolution), respectively. DSAs have been widely adopted as a stable anode electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyzed water.36 The difference in temperature caused by light is color-coded, with orange representing the hot side and blue representing the cold side. The illustration shows a schematic band diagram of the GeSe photoelectrode with thermoelectric voltage (the electron moved to the surface of the photocathode, while the holes were transferred to the DSA) for standalone overall solar water-splitting. It is known that GeSe photoelectrodes cannot overcome the OER (ηOER) potential to split water under solar light illumination. Integration of a Bi2Te3 electrode into a GeSe MAB photoelectrode would realize a highly efficient overall solar water-splitting reaction by utilizing the solar thermal production feature of GeSe MABs. Benefiting from the outstanding photothermal performance and careful design of the integrated thermal voltage conversion device, we can overcome ηOER according to a photothermal bias and achieve highly efficient overall solar water-splitting from the GeSe MAB photoelectrode without any external bias for the first time.
The output voltage converted by the GeSe/TEG-based device was different in different environments (different temperature differences). In the first environment, the bare GeSe film that was attached on the hot side of TEG was illuminated by continuous sunlight for 2.5 min, while the cold side (back side of TEG) was cooled by running water at 17 °C (coolant). As a result, an output voltage of about 1.22 V was converted by the GeSe/TEG-based device (Fig. 3d). When we changed the coolant from running water to outdoor air, the GeSe/TEG device only produced a bias of 0.6 V (Fig. S11, ESI†). Furthermore, we installed a piece of solar glass on the front of the Pt–TiO2/GeSe photoelectrode and sealed in 20 ml of electrolyte (Fig. 3a and 4d, g), while still using running water at 17 °C for the cold side of this system. Since the light absorption of Pt–TiO2/GeSe is higher than that of bare GeSe, and the electrolyte has a good insulation effect to prevent heat loss, the fully packaged Pt–TiO2/GeSe/TEG device system could generate a 1.52 V bias (Fig. 4e). However, the warming of the electrolyte was reported to promote the PEC performance.67–69 We also evaluated the current density value at −1.52 V vs. counter electrode (C.E.) of the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG photoelectrode with a two-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the photocurrent density increased with the temperature, when the temperature of the electrolyte was below 50 °C.
In this work, the GeSe hybrid hydrogen production device (packed device Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG) underwent a process of being illuminated/soaked in sunlight (∼1500 s light soaking) to reach an equilibrium of solar energy storage and conversion for water-splitting. Therefore, the evaluation criterion of the solar-to-hydrogen performance as accumulation process in this work would be different from previous reported ordinary transit PEC properties.
It should be noted here that the packed device Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG shown in Fig. 4 also acts as a solar thermal energy storage cell; the packed device Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG absorbed infrared solar light and stored it as thermal energy during the solar light illumination time, while the TEG converted the thermal energy into electric power, which was also recycled and added to the GeSe photoelectrode for enhanced overall water-splitting. As shown in Fig. 4 f, g, the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG device cannot split water during the initial ∼300 s solar-light-soaking process because the device had not absorbed/storage enough solar thermal energy to be converted into sufficient electric power. After about 300 s of solar-light soaking, the device accumulated sufficient solar thermal energy, meaning that the TEG converted this accumulated/storage solar thermal energy into a sufficient electric bias (>0.95 V) on the GeSe photoelectrode to start water-splitting. After 300 s of solar-light soaking, the STH efficiency of the device significantly increased to about 13.5% (after ∼1500 s). In this process, the solar thermal energy storage speed was greater than the heat energy conversion rate by TEG, and dynamic solar thermal energy storage and conversion (by TEG) inside the packed device Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG was observed at a solar light illumination time of 300 s to 1500 s. After 1500 s of light soaking, the solar thermal energy storage and conversion (by TEG) reached equilibrium, and the photovoltage (by TEG) and STH efficiency of the GeSe photoelectrode tended to stabilize at about 1.52 V and 13.5%, respectively. Similar to various thin-film solar cells, the device in this work also presented a significant light-soaking effect. The STH efficiency of the device was significantly enhanced with the light-soaking time. It should be noted here that the 13.5% STH efficiency of the device is different from the previously reported transient STH efficiency of various devices.36–38 The 13.5% STH efficiency of the device was achieved by solar-light soaking of more than ∼1500 s, and the 13.5% STH efficiency is more like the process-accumulated STH efficiency. The STH efficiency discussed below in this work corresponds to this process-accumulated STH efficiency. The thermal energy storage and conversion process of the integrated device was also important, and Fig. S15 (ESI†) demonstrates the process graphically.
For this hybrid device, the negative and positive wire of the TEG were connected to the GeSe-based cathode and DSA anode, respectively. The onset potential of this device in 1 M H2SO4 was obtained from the J–V curve of ∼0.65 V (Fig. S16, ESI†), corresponding to ∼0.87 V (1.52–0.65 V) from the bias of TEG. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), a current density–time curve was measured and the operation point loading was found at ∼300 s, which means that ∼480 J (W = Pt = 100 mW cm−2 × 300 s × 16 cm2) should be absorbed in the preheating process. Therefore, we calculated the STH efficiency as a function of time using the expression  and the STH–time plot is shown in Fig. 4f. We found that the STH efficiency in the range from 300–1500 s was enhanced because of the heat accumulation by light illumination, causing an increase of the output power of TEG. A maximum and stable STH efficiency of 13.5% was achieved after 1500 s. This result indicated that a promising solar-to-hydrogen performance could be obtained using this GeSe hybrid device after a just a brief preheating process or light-soaking process. Furthermore, we found that previous reported works about TE hybrid devices also demonstrated the application potential of photothermal materials integrated with a TE generator for solar water-splitting (Table S2, ESI†). However, we have provided a more efficient and simpler hybrid device based on bifunctional GeSe as both the PEC solar water-splitting electrode and the photothermal conversion material simultaneously. We found that the solar thermal response feature of GeSe MABs significantly enhanced the solar water-splitting reaction itself. The synergistic coupling effect of solar thermal and photoelectrochemical water-splitting is very interesting for the promotion of the efficiency of not only GeSe MAB-based photoelectrodes, but also photoelectrodes for solar hydrogen evolution.
In addition, a photograph of the PTV-PEC tandem cell under working conditions in the laboratory is shown in the inset of Fig. 4f. Simulated solar light was irradiated on the photoelectrode with a 16 cm2 active area, and we observed that a large number of H2 bubbles were produced on the surface of the GeSe-based integrated photoelectrode and DSA anode, indicating that the water-splitting process was driven by this unbiased/standalone device under only solar light irradiation. Furthermore, Video S3 (ESI†) shows a video of the tandem cell under working conditions in the laboratory; we observed that a large amount of H2 and O2 bubbles were generated at the surface of GeSe and DSA, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 4g, the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG device was also placed outdoors for natural solar-light-soaking (Sunny, 14:00, 5th Apr. 2022, Guangzhou, China). As shown in Video S4 (ESI†), we clearly observed that a large number of bubbles appeared and floated upward after the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG integrated device was pre-illuminated for 10 min by the sun. The water-splitting reaction requires at least 1.23 V based on thermodynamics, but considering the overpotential (ηOER and ηHER), the water-splitting voltage would exceed 1.45 V. In this work, an overall water-splitting voltage of ∼1.4 V was also detected from the J–V curve of the Pt and DSA electrodes in 1 M H2SO4 solution (Fig. S18, ESI†), indicating that the water-splitting voltage could be over 1.4 V based on these two categories of HER and OER catalysis, respectively. In this work, with a bias of 1.52 V rooted in the full usage of a wide solar spectrum region by the GeSe MAB and thermoelectric generator coupling device, the GeSe-based photoelectrode achieved a record STH efficiency. With a total self-generated photovoltage of ∼2.1 V (∼0.6 V from the GeSe photocathode (Fig. S19, ESI†), and the 1.52 V from the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG photothermal generator), the final GeSe-based overall water-splitting device showed a promising STH efficiency (ηSTH), which was calculated to be 13.5%. The more than tenfold improvement in ηSTH caused by the efficient wide solar spectrum region utilization in the model fully confirmed its superiority to the GeSe–BiVO4 configuration reported in our previous work.22 PV-ECs (a photovoltaic cell connected with two electro-catalysis electrodes in series) were known as a promising way to achieve commercial solar-to-hydrogen production in the early years, with high ηSTH values of over 18% and long-term stability.70 After years of development, PV-EC water-splitting configurations have reached an excellent ηSTH of more than 30%.71 Furthermore, in some published works, hybrid devices in which a TEG is integrated with PVs have also been designed to provide enhancement of the output power.39,40,72 These two practical examples have great implications for our work in combining the GeSe-based solar cell and TEG to improve the ηSTH.
Subsequently, the output performance of the coupling device at various coolant temperatures was measured. As shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†), the output voltage changed from 1.52 V to 1.35 V, corresponding to an output current decrease from 0.22 to 0.16 A, when the temperature of the running water was varied. The carefully designed and utilized photothermal coupling device can convert energy that insufficiently motivates the charge from the valence band maximum (VBM) to the conduction band minimum (CBM) into heat and further achieve a thermal voltage through the assistance of a voltage generator. The stability of the Pt/TiO2/GeSe/TEG integrated device after 1500 s of preheating was measured under unbiased conditions with chopped simulated solar light irradiation. A slight current density degeneration occurred within 2 h of continuous illumination (Fig. S21, ESI†), while the structure of the GeSe-based device did not exhibit change in the SEM images (Fig. S22, ESI†), and more than 14 mmol H2 and 7 mmol O2 were produced with a Faraday efficiency of over 95% (Fig. S23, ESI†). In the future, integrating the system to an applicable module size such as 100 cm2, 500 cm2 or more should be very interesting and important. The parameters of the system, including the GeSe photoelectrode, the electrolyte volume or the distance between the GeSe film and solar glass, the recycled running water system/speed and the packaging of the GeSe-based devices, should be different and should be redesigned if the device area is increased to 100 cm2, 500 cm2 or more. In addition, the temperature control between the surface of the GeSe film (hot side) and the back surface in contact with the running water (cold side) in this work has room for further optimization (Fig. 3a, Fig. 4b), for example, by replacement of the currently used TEG with a better one to facilitate the heat conversion process, use of a heat-energy-protected cover glass or temperature-protected packaging materials or the use of recycled electrolyte to maintain the electrolyte chamber temperature if the device area were increased to 100 cm2, 500 cm2 or more. There should be many efficient ways to enhance the heat energy utilization ratio in device systems in which the area is increased to 100 cm2, 500 cm2 or more.
Conclusion
In summary, we have reported an unbiased solar water-splitting device that fully utilizes the spectrum from 400–2500 nm with a GeSe micro air brick film, which has a promising incident light absorptivity (over 90%) and rapid solar thermal response (∼30 °C min−1). Combining a Bi2Te3 thermal electronic electrode with a GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode greatly increased the utilization efficiency of waste energy in the infrared spectrum and the above-bandgap part. The synergistic coupling effect of solar thermal and photoelectrochemical water-splitting is very interesting for the efficiency promotion of GeSe MAB-based photoelectrodes. It was found that the solar thermal energy captured by the GeSe MABs could be transformed into electrical power using the Bi2Te3 electrode, which could also be recycled/added to the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode to assist the solar water-splitting reactions or power other power-consuming equipment. The solar thermal energy could be transformed into an additional electrical bias of approximately 1.52 V on the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode itself, which significantly improved the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of the GeSe photoelectrode. The Bi2Te3 thermal electric electrode integrated with the GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode (Bi2Te3–GeSe MABs) could directly split water without any additional bias under only solar light irradiation, and the Bi2Te3–GeSe MAB photoelectrode presented a remarkable and record STH efficiency of over 13.5%. Given the urgent demand for promoting the STH efficiency of solar water-splitting, it is expected that the practice of utilizing the wasted part to improve the STH efficiency in this work will inspire further research. We believe that high-light-absorptivity semiconductors and photothermal conversion materials can be widely adopted for practical solar hydrogen production.

Broader context
In this work, we found that the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency was greatly enhanced to a record value of 13.5% by the coupling induction of a GeSe-film-based solar thermal energy storage and conversion cell with a GeSe-film-based solar water-splitting photoelectrode. This is the first report of such high and record STH efficiency for hydrogen production via the comprehensive utilization of photo-thermal and photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this work, we found that the GeSe MAB film presented excellent photo-thermal response properties. After combining a Bi2Te3 thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a GeSe MAB-based photoelectrode, the integrated device achieved a great increase in the utilization efficiency of the wasted solar thermal energy. The integrated GeSe-based device also acts as a solar thermal energy storage cell; the integrated GeSe-based device absorbed infrared solar light and stored it as thermal energy with the solar light illumination time, while the TEG converted the thermal energy into electric power. This electric power could also be recycled and added to the GeSe photoelectrode for enhanced overall water splitting. Finally, the GeSe-TEG integrated device could directly split water without any additional bias under only solar light irradiation, and a record solar to hydrogen efficiency of 13.5% was achieved.

(c) Schematic diagram of the photothermal mechanism of the GeSe MABs. (d) Infrared images of GeSe MABs/Mo sheet under AM 1.5 G incident light for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 s, respectively. (The GeSe loaded sheet was placed on a polyurethane board to prevent heat loss.)	 

 	Fig. 3  Evaluation of the photothermal conversion performance of the GeSe MAB film by integrating the GeSe MAB film and a thermoelectric generator, which we called a photothermovoltaic cell (PTV). (a) Illustration of the PTV cell. This device includes a water bath thermostat (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) for cooling the cold side of the TEG with tap water maintained at ∼17 °C, a waterproof/insulation gasket, a thermoelectric generator (TEG, TEC-56382), a GeSe film-coated Mo plate seamlessly glued on the hot side of the TEG (GeSe/TEG) with silver paste and a solar glass window. Thermal images of TEG (b) and GeSe/TEG (c) after 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 min under AM 1.5G. (d) The output voltage response curve of the GeSe/TEG with 100 mW cm−2 illumination and 17 °C running water.

Surface (a) and cross-sectional (b) morphology of Pt–TiO2/GeSe (inset reveals the partially enlarged view of (b)). (c) Light absorptivity spectra of the bare GeSe film and TiO2/GeSe film with water (wet) and without water (dry). (d) Schematic of the photothermovoltaic cell-photoelectrochemical (PTV-PEC) tandem electrode and energy potential diagram of the tandem cell with TEG and GeSe photoelectrodes (the counter electrode is a dimensionally stable anode (DSA, Ir- and Ru-coated Ti plate)). In this PTV-PEC device, the output performance of the TEG was promoted by the surface temperature of the hot side (GeSe photocathode). Overall water-splitting would not be carried out until the PTV-PEC reached the operation point potential (Vop). For the TEG, this Vop is ∼1 V.
