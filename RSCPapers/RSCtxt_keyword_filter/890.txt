Here we report the evaluation of the potential of copper (Cu) as the electrode material in perovskite solar cells for long-term stability. In encapsulated devices which limit exposure to oxygen and moisture, Cu in direct contact with CH3NH3PbI3 showed no reaction at laboratory time scales, and is predicted to be stable for almost 170 years at room temperature and over 22 years at the nominal operating cell temperature of 40 °C. No diffusion of Cu into CH3NH3PbI3 has been observed after thermal annealing for over 100 hours at 80 °C, nor does Cu cause charge trap states in direct contact with CH3NH3PbI3 after long-term thermal annealing or illumination. High performance devices with efficiency above 20% with a Cu electrode retain 98% of the initial efficiency after 816 hours storage in an ambient environment without encapsulation. The results indicate Cu is a promising low-cost electrode material for perovskite solar cells for long-term operation.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells are arising as strong candidates for next generation of renewable and clean energy conversion due to the very high efficiency achieved, low material and fabrication cost, and scalable manufacture capability. However the instability of perovskite materials remain a huge hurdle to be overcome before the commercialization of this technology. Among various instability issue associated with perovskite solar cells, one grand challenge which has rarely been addressed is the corrosion of many common metal electrode materials by perovskite, such as silver, aluminum or even gold. A diffusion barrier layer is generally inserted between the metal electrodes and perovskite layer to extend the short-term lifetime, which however doesn't solve the long-term stability problem. Here we reported the potential of low cost metal copper (Cu) as the electrode material for long-lived perovskite solar cells that potentially allows the stable operation of perovskite solar cells for over 20 years at nominal operation temperature even with the direct contact of Cu with perovskite. The commercial availability of Cu ink or Cu paste also allows the scalable manufacturing of perovskite solar cells with Cu electrodes.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) solar cells have been attracting increased attention in both academia and industry for their applications for the next generation of renewable energy converters with rapid energy payback time.1 Their prospects to compete with other types of thin film solar cells have been rising due to the rapid progress in increasing efficiencies for both small and large area devices, as well as those fabricated with scalable methods.2–19 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased to over 22% for small area devices,20 and close to 20% for 1 cm2 size devices.21 However, the broadly observed poor stability of perovskite solar cells has remained a significant challenge that hinders the commercialization of OIHP solar cells.22–24 Among all the factors that cause the instability of perovskite solar cells, the reaction between common electrode materials and the OIHP creates significant degradation and must be overcome for effective commercialization. The common metal electrodes, such as silver (Ag) and aluminum (Al), corrode when in contact with the hybrid perovskite.25,26 Even noble metals, such as expensive gold (Au), were found to react with hybrid perovskite in short-term studies.27 In order to fabricate a stable perovskite solar cells, diffusion barrier layer(s) was (were) often needed to be inserted to separate the metal electrodes and the perovskite layer.28–32 These buffer layers may prevent the contact between the perovskite and metals over short time frames, but cannot solve the long-term stability issue, as materials tend to diffuse through the buffer layers after several months or years of operation under illumination or thermal cycles. The diffusion of Au across the thick hole transport layer was reported recently, which resulted in the degradation of the devices in several hours.33
The corrosion of Ag and Al electrodes by OIHPs has been generally ascribed to the chemical reaction of the metal electrodes with the decomposition products of perovskites (eqn (1)).25,26 For example, HI from the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3, or MAPbI3, can react severely with Ag and Al. CH3NH3PbI3 ↔ CH3NH2 + HI + PbI2(1)In contrast, copper (Cu) is well-known for its better corrosion resistance, especially in non-oxidizing acids (e.g. HI, HBr) and halogens.34 For example, Cu can improve the resistance of a metal alloy to Cl−-rich seawater, and enhances the resistance of Cu alloys to environments containing HF.34 The performance of Cu and its alloys in these conditions inspired us to evaluate whether Cu can be a stable electrode for halide perovskites. Here, we found that Cu may be a promising electrode material that is intrinsically stable with OIHP over long times. The accelerated degradation study revealed that in the absence of oxygen and moisture, i.e., in encapsulated perovskite solar cells, Cu can be stable even in direct contact with perovskite for many years. The diffusion of Cu was not observed in perovskite after long-term thermal annealing or sun illumination. High performance device with Cu electrode can be stable for hundreds of hours in ambient environment without any encapsulation.
Results and discussion
Cu was first introduced into perovskite solar cells as an electrode by us in devices produced by the doctor-blade method, which resulted in a long device lifetime of over one month for non-encapsulated devices.35 In the Cu/MAPbI3 interface, the Cu was in direct contact with MAPbI3 and has been shown to be much more stable than Al/MAPbI3 and Ag/MAPbI3 interfaces after one day in air, but notable reaction of Cu with MAPbI3 could be observed after one week of storage in air. It is noted that Cu can still be oxidized in the presence of oxygen and moisture, and the possible oxidation products (e.g. Cu(OH)2 or CuOx by the reactions (2) and (3) below) can react with the decomposition products of perovskites (e.g. HI), which may cause perovskite decomposition by driving the reaction towards the right side (eqn (1)).34,36 (2) Cu + O2 → CuOx(3)Removing oxygen and moisture, for example by encapsulation, should eliminate the oxidation and stabilize the Cu/MAPbI3 interface. This was tested by annealing the samples with a structure of ITO/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/MAPbI3/Cu (Fig. 1a) at 100 °C in both air and N2. Here we tested the stability of Cu with MAPbI3 by depositing Cu directly onto MAPbI3 without any charge transport layer. This evaluates the intrinsic stability between these two materials, which gives the worse-case scenario if Cu diffuses through the charge transport layers (CTLs) and predicts the lower limit of stability. As shown in Fig. 1b, after the sample was annealed in air for only 1 hour, the back side of the sample underneath the Cu electrodes turned to yellow, indicating the degradation of MAPbI3 beneath the Cu electrodes and the penetration of Cu across the degraded MAPbI3 layer. The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the degraded samples verified that the degradation products included CuI (its three most intense peaks are located at 25.5°, 42.2°, and 67.4° 2θ) and PbI2 (peaks at 12.6°, 38.6°, 39.5° and 52.3° 2θ). In contrast, there was no color change for the samples annealed in an N2 environment even after annealing for 16 hours at 100 °C. There were no peaks characteristic of CuI in the XRD spectrum, but there was a small peak associated with PbI2, which could be caused by thermal decomposition of the perovskite film not covered by Cu (Fig. 1c). This result confirmed that the Cu/MAPbI3 interface is much more stable in the absence of moisture and oxygen. It reveals the intrinsic Cu stability with MAPbI3, which is meaningful and important to study, because perovskite solar cells have to be encapsulated for real applications, just like other type of thin film solar cells such as CIGS.

In order to determine the overall reaction kinetics between Cu and MAPbI3 necessary to predict the lifetime of devices with Cu electrodes, annealing at elevated temperatures was done. Here the samples were covered by a thick layer of polystyrene (PS) to suppress the thermal decomposition so that the interface reaction could be studied. The stable lifetime (τ) is defined as the thermal annealing duration after which the most intense XRD peak of CuI at 25.5° 2θ appears. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the CuI XRD peaks were evident after annealing at 150 °C for 1 h, 140 °C for 2.3 h, 130 °C for 5.58 h 120 °C for 14 h, 100 °C for 104 h and 90 °C for 307 h. These points were shown time (τ) versus temperature (T) plot as shown in Fig. 1d, which follows a typical Arrhenius relationship.37 From the fitting curve, the stable lifetime at lower temperature can be predicted. At room temperature (300 K), the lifetime of Cu/MAPbI3 structure can be calculated to be around 1.5 × 106 hours, or 169.5 years. Even at nominal operating cell temperature of 40 °C, which is among the worst-case scenarios for poor thermal management in modules, the Cu/MAPbI3 structure is still stable for more than 22 years. It should be noted that the stable lifetime might be overestimated because of the low sensitivity of XRD (typically on the order of 5% in determining phase content). While the real lifetime is less than 170 years at room temperature, in real devices there are electron/hole transport layers (e.g. ZnO, fullerene, NiOx) separating the Cu and OIHP as a diffusion barrier. Nevertheless, this study still reveals that Cu is a very stable electrode for perovskite materials.
One concern of using Cu as electrode is the high diffusivity Cu in many known materials, such as porous polymers. Lattice diffusion occurs either through interstitial sites or vacancies.38 Due to the close-packed crystal structure of OIHP with interstitial sites smaller than the radius of Cu, the interstitial diffusion of Cu in OIHP has been predicted to be slow by M. Saiful Islam et al.39 For vacancy diffusion, I− vacancies are most likely, as they were reported to have the highest concentration due to the small formation energy.40 However, Cu with a positive charge would still have too high energy barrier to occupy the I− vacancy site. Therefore the diffusion of Cu through OIHP is not expected to be significant. A straightforward experiment to judge whether significant Cu diffusion occurs is to deposit a very thin layer (5 nm) of Cu directly on top of MAPbI3, and to observe whether Cu disappears after annealing. It was found Cu on MAPbI3 remained intact even after annealing at 80 °C for 22 hours, suggesting minimal diffusion of Cu into MAPbI3 (Fig. 2a). In addition, the SEM/EDX measurements were conducted to determine if Cu diffused into the MAPbI3. The MAPbI3 thin films were covered by a thermally-evaporated Cu layer 100 nm thick. Then the samples were annealed at 80 °C for 20 h, after which the Cu electrodes were peeled off using Kapton tape, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. One indication that little or no diffusion occurred is that the bonding between Cu and MAPbI3 remained poor (i.e., no diffusion bonding occurred), as the Cu can be easily peeled off. The Cu content in the MAPbI3 underneath the Cu electrodes was measured before and after thermal annealing. The Cu Kα line intensity was monitored across a MAPbI3 grain boundary. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Cu signal of the samples before and after annealing is indistinguishable, and the overall signal is at the level of noise. In addition, the line-scans covering both grain and grain boundaries did not show Cu intensity contrast between grain and grain boundary areas, suggesting that Cu diffusion is also negligible along grain boundary.

The scale bar is 500 nm. 
The possible diffusion of Cu into MAPbI3 was also evaluated by monitoring the variation of the vertical electrical resistance of the ITO/PTAA/perovskite/Cu after annealing. The electrical resistance change of the devices was monitored with time under annealing at 80 °C. The thickness of the MAPbI3 layer was about 360 nm (ESI,† Fig. S2). If Cu can diffuse into perovskite or along the grain boundaries during annealing, the device resistance should decrease dramatically. It should be noted that we did observe some shunted devices right after the evaporation of Cu with such a device structure without charge transport layers, though there were good working devices without shunting. The shunting observed before annealing was most likely caused by pin-holes in the polycrystalline MAPbI3 films which were filled by the conductive Cu rather than by Cu diffusion through lattice or grain boundary of the perovskite film. This was verified by Conductive-Atomic Force Microscope (C-AFM). The topography of the three samples was shown in Fig. 3a–c. The first sample was a MAPbI3 film without Cu. The second and third samples were the shunted and working devices, but the Cu electrodes were peeled off. As illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, the current stayed in the picoampere (pA) scale before and after annealing, and the current at the grain boundaries is even lower than that on grains for all the three samples, indicating the lack of high-conductivity Cu pathways in the sample, and thus minimal Cu diffusion. This result also indicates one main function of charge transport layers is to block the pin-holes of the polycrystalline films to increase the device open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factors (FF) due to the reduced leakage.41 The samples without pin-holes had a resistance on the order of 106 ohm, which was chosen for the subsequent annealing study.

Fig. 4a shows the statistic resistance change of the working samples annealed at 80 °C. There was no obvious resistance change for the working devices even after annealing for 112.5 h, suggesting that the Cu/perovskite interface is stable under the given condition and no diffusion occurred. Despite the lack of Cu diffusion and reaction with MAPbI3, it is important to understand the influence of Cu on the electronic properties of MAPbI3. This study is necessary because the possibility of subtle reactions of Cu with MAPbI3, which cannot be observed through material structure characterization but may cause dramatic changes in the electronic properties. Since the OIHP materials are mostly intrinsic semiconductors, only a few ppm of doping could increase the conductivity by several orders of magnitude, while possible reactions may also introduce defects and charge traps. Thus, the photovoltaic performance of the above devices was studied under thermal/light aging. We noticed that such devices without an electron transport layer also had decent photovoltaic performance under one sun illumination. As shown by the current–voltage (J–V) curve in Fig. 4b, the devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.0% by reverse scanning before thermal annealing. After annealing at 80 °C for 20 hours, the PCE dropped slightly to 8.7%, which showed much higher stability comparing to the device with Au as electrode in a recent literature using similar accelerated aging test (75 °C for 15 hours).33 The trap density of the device was also measured before and after thermal annealing. As shown in Fig. 4c, there was no obvious change of the trap density for the samples annealed at 80 °C for 20 hours. It suggests that Cu does not introduce extra charge trap states to the perovskite during thermal annealing process, which is in agreement with the absence of chemical reaction between Cu and MAPbI3. In addition to good thermal stability, the device with such a simple structure also displayed stable performance under continuous illumination as shown in Fig. 4d. After being illuminated at light intensity of 20 mW cm−2 for 30 hours, the efficiency of the device only slightly decreased from 8.7% to 7.9%, which shows much slower degradation comparing to devices using other metals such as Au, Ag, Al, or Ca reported recently.27

Cu can also be the stable electrode for highly efficient perovskite solar cells when an ETL is inserted between the perovskite layer and Cu. The power conversion efficiency in our optimized devices reached over 20.0% when fullerene (C60) and bathocuproine (BCP) as electron transport layer was inserted, and the perovskite layer was well passivated (Fig. 5a). The device efficiency versus storage time is shown in Fig. 5b. After 816 hours storage in air (25 °C, ∼55% relative humidity) without encapsulation, the device retained 98% of the initial efficiency. The three parameters of fill factor, open circuit voltage and short circuited current almost didn't change. In comparison, the perovskite devices with Ag or Al electrodes lost 20% or more of the initial efficiency after 200 hours storage in air (25 °C, 35% humidity).42 This clearly showed the much better stability of the perovskite solar cells with Cu electrodes.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we revealed that Cu could be an extraordinarily stable electrode material for OIHP solar cells. The chemical reaction between Cu and perovskite under inert atmosphere takes over 169 years at room temperature, and there is no notable diffusion of Cu into the perovskite. A simple device with Cu/perovskite contact can be stable under high temperature annealing for over 100 hours. The absence of any chemical reaction between Cu and MAPbI3 allows the charge trap states to remain constant under continuous annealing or illumination. For high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PCE > 20%) with Cu electrode, the efficiency sustained 98% of the initial value after over 800 hours storage in ambient environment (25 °C, ∼55% humidity). Considering its high conductivity, low-cost, and high stability, Cu is a better choice for the electrode material in perovskite solar cells than other widely used electrode materials (Ag, Al, Cr or Au). Further study is still needed in order to fully understand the stability limit of perovskite solar cells, while the electrode stability is shown not to be the limiting factor here. The commercial availability of Cu ink or Cu paste also allows the scalable manufacturing of perovskite solar cells with Cu electrodes.
Methods
Perovskite thin film device fabrication
The hole transport layer, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) film was prepared by spin-coating 2 mg mL−1 PTAA/toluene solution onto a clean ITO film at 4000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 30 s. The as-prepared film was then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite films were fabricated on the as-prepared PTAA/ITO substrates by interdiffusion method as is reported previously.19 After that, an 80 nm thick Cu electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation directly on perovskite films or after perovskite films was passivated and C60/BCP as electron transport layer was inserted.
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
XRD measurements were performed with the Bruker-AXS D8 Discover Diffractometer. Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer is configured in parallel beam geometry with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength of 1.5418 Å).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
EDX line scan was carried out on a FEI Helios NanoLab™ 660 instrument equipped with TEAM energy dispersive spectroscope. The typical electron acceleration voltage for X-ray excitation was 15 kV. The typical acceleration current was 100 pA.
Conductive atomic force microscope
C-AFM was measured by a commercial AFM system (MFP-3D, Asylum Research, USA) and Pt/Ir coated conductive probes (PPP-EFM, Nanosensors, Switzerland). The topography and surface current were measured by C-AFM in the dark and in N2. DC bias applied here is 1 V. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 4b. Samples for C-AFM characterization were also the devices with Cu electrodes being peeled off by Kapton tape.
Electrical characterization
During all electrical characterization, perovskite devices were kept in a N2 glovebox to protect the samples. The J–V performance of the samples was recorded using a Keithley 2400 semiconductor analyzer. The scanning rate is 0.1 V s−1. Simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) was produced by a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel 67005, 150 W Solar Simulator) for current (I)–voltage (V) measurements. The light intensity was calibrated by a silicon (Si) diode (Hamamatsu S1133) equipped with a Schott visible colour glass filter (KG5 color filter).

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells are arising as strong candidates for next generation of renewable and clean energy conversion due to the very high efficiency achieved, low material and fabrication cost, and scalable manufacture capability. However the instability of perovskite materials remain a huge hurdle to be overcome before the commercialization of this technology. Among various instability issue associated with perovskite solar cells, one grand challenge which has rarely been addressed is the corrosion of many common metal electrode materials by perovskite, such as silver, aluminum or even gold. A diffusion barrier layer is generally inserted between the metal electrodes and perovskite layer to extend the short-term lifetime, which however doesn't solve the long-term stability problem. Here we reported the potential of low cost metal copper (Cu) as the electrode material for long-lived perovskite solar cells that potentially allows the stable operation of perovskite solar cells for over 20 years at nominal operation temperature even with the direct contact of Cu with perovskite. The commercial availability of Cu ink or Cu paste also allows the scalable manufacturing of perovskite solar cells with Cu electrodes.
