    , Accepted 26th November 2018First published on 27th November 2018AbstractStibnite (Sb2S3) is a promising material in photoelectronic and energy devices, but it frequently exhibits sheaf-like and hierarchical-like structures that consist of secondary nanorods (NRs) or nanowires (NWs) because of its spatial fractal splitting growth habit. Foreign ions or seeds enable the alteration of the growth dynamics and the consequent shape engineering of nanocrystals. We here report that the introduction of trace amounts of isovalent Bi3+ ions (typically 1–2 atom% Bi/Sb) is efficient to synthesize highly disperse, uniform Sb2S3 NRs with reduced diameters and lengths. Two temperature-dependent growth mechanisms stemming from the presence of Bi ions, the full splitting growth at high temperature and the seeded growth at low temperature, are proposed to demonstrate the formation of separated, thinner NRs. Meanwhile, the surfactant removal and the coupling with p-type CuSCN are simultaneously performed on these Sb2S3 NRs, and the resultant CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite, which contains a large amount of point-to-surface contact p–n heterojunctions with a suitable band alignment, holds promise in self-powered UV-visible photodetectors via the photovoltaic effect.
Introduction
Control over the nanocrystal (NC) shape is one of the hot research topics due to its importance in modulating the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials.1–3 In addition to the widely-used organic surfactants and ligands containing coordinate atoms such as N, P, O and S,2–6 extrinsic ions or tiny seeds (or catalysts) are also able to affect the crystal growth dynamics and thus act as efficient regulators for shaping NCs2,7–11 in ways that surfactants cannot achieve. On the other hand, the high anisotropy of crystal structures is considered as another crucial factor for the shape control of NCs.12,13 Group V2–VI3 binary crystals (V = Sb, Bi; VI = S, Se), such as Sb2S3, Bi2S3, and Sb2Se3, share a markedly anisotropic crystal structure, which is composed of strongly covalent one-dimensional (1D) [V4VI6]n ribbons that are linked with each other by weak van der Waals (vdW) forces.14,15 Such a structure feature makes these crystals prefer to grow in a 1D morphology along the extending direction of [V4VI6]n ribbons.16–19 As a representative member, the crystalline phase Sb2S3 (stibnite, c-Sb2S3) conforms with this growth habit and easily forms 1D micro/nanorods or -wires.19–21 During the growth of 1D Sb2S3 crystals, the weak vdW interaction between the [V4VI6]n ribbons frequently contributes to the crystal splitting growth,16,22,23 thus producing hierarchical c-Sb2S3 micro/nanostructures with a sheaf-, urchin-, or flower-like morphology that consists of many subordinate nanorods (NRs) or nanowires (NWs).22–29 Given that no splitting growth occurred, the micro/nanorods or -wires were often produced with relatively large diameters and lengths.20–22 Obviously, the realization of complete splitting growth will transform the sheaf-, urchin-, or flower-like micro/nanostructures into separated, thinner NRs or NWs for c-Sb2S3.
In the meantime, c-Sb2S3 (stibnite) has been actively studied as a promising material in photoelectronic devices because of its high absorption coefficient and suitable band gap (∼1.7 eV).30 For example, Sb2S3 thin films can serve as absorber layers or sensitizers in solar cells;30,31 Sb2S3 nanostructured materials with different morphologies or thin films have been applied in photodetectors.21,32 In recent years, UV-visible-IR optical detection devices,21,32–35 especially broad-spectrum zero-biased self-powered photodetectors that work without any external power source,32e,33 have attracted wide research interest in (photo)electronics. To boost the photogenerated hole–electron separation and transport, hole-transport materials (HTMs) and electron-transport materials (ETMs) are purposely introduced into photoelectronic devices. p-Type conductor crystalline copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) is often used as a HTM to improve the performance of solar cells31a–c and (self-powered) photodetectors.33b,c,35a As a wide bandgap semiconductor (Eg = 3.6–3.9 eV), CuSCN itself could be also employed as a sensitive material to probe UV light.35b,36 Sb2S3 shows suitable electronic coupling and band energy alignment with CuSCN and their composite has shown attractive potential in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells.31a–c,37 It is expected that the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite should be useful in self-driven UV-visible photodetectors.
In this work, we report a bismuth ion-induced growth method to synthesize highly disperse, thin Sb2S3 NRs and evaluate the application of these NRs, after being composited with p-CuSCN, in self-powered UV-visible detection. It is found that the presence of trace amounts of foreign isovalent Bi ions (1–2 atom% relative to Sb) enables alteration of the growth dynamics of Sb2S3 crystals and gives rise to two different growth mechanisms that are dependent on the synthetic temperature: i) the full splitting growth of crystalline stibnite c-Sb2S3 rod-bundles into separated, thin crystalline NRs above the crystallization temperature of Sb2S3 (e.g., 210 °C) and ii) the isostructural (BixSb1−x)2S3-seeded growth of amorphous a-Sb2S3 2D nanosheets into separated thin c-Sb2S3 NRs below the crystallization temperature of Sb2S3 (e.g., 170 °C). To our knowledge, this is the first report to prepare highly disperse, uniform Sb2S3 NRs by consciously introducing Bi ions into the synthetic process. Moreover, we show that, after being composited with p-type conductor CuSCN crystal clusters, these Sb2S3 NRs exhibit promising performance in self-powered UV-visible photodetection devices due to the large amount of point-to-surface contact p–n heterointerfaces and the suitable band alignment between p-CuSCN and n-Sb2S3.

Material preparation

Synthesis of Sb2S3 NRs. 
Highly disperse, separated Sb2S3 NRs could be prepared by adding a small quantity of Bi ions into a long-chain amine reaction solution29 at different temperatures. In a typical procedure, 0.114 g SbCl3 (0.5 mmol) was added into a mixture solution of oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%, technical grade, 8 mL, Aladdin) and n-dodecylamine (DA, 98%, 1 g, Aladdin) in a 50 mL three-necked flask. The flask was heated to 130 °C in an oil bath and kept under magnetic stirring at this temperature for 20–30 min to yield a clear homogeneous solution, followed by the addition of 0.096 g S powder (3 mmol). Afterwards, the temperature was increased to 170–210 °C and the reaction continued for 30–60 min. At this point, amorphous Sb2S3 nanosheets were formed at 170 °C while crystalline Sb2S3 sheaf-like nanostructures consisting of many crystalline NRs (i.e., rod-bundles) were generated at 210 °C. When a trace amount of Bi ions was added into the synthetic solution at this moment (100–200 μL of BiCl3/acetone solution with a concentration of 0.5 mmol/10 mL, Bi/Sb = 1–2 atomic%), highly disperse, separated Sb2S3 NRs were obtained after another one hour of reaction at the temperatures of 170–210 °C. The products were precipitated by centrifugation, washed with n-hexane three times, and finally dried at 60 °C for further characterization.


Synthesis of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. 
First, 0.02–0.1 mmol of CuSCN was dissolved under sonication in 10 mL of DMF to prepare CuSCN/DMF solution in a 50 mL serum bottle. The as-prepared Sb2S3 NRs were ultrasonically dispersed in 10 mL of n-hexane. Then, 5 mL of the above NR dispersion solution was mixed with the CuSCN/DMF solution (0.002–0.01 mol L−1). After 15–20 hours of magnetic stirring (rotational speed: 1000 rpm), a composite composed of CuSCN crystal clusters and Sb2S3 NRs could be prepared from such a mixed solution by centrifugation and washing with ethanol three times. During the formation of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite, the NRs were transferred from n-hexane to DMF, meaning the removal of organic surfactants on the surfaces of Sb2S3 NRs.

Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected using a D8 Advance diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, Bruker-AXS). The size and morphology of the samples were examined through a JSM-7001F scanning electron microscope (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images as well as electron diffraction (ED) patterns were collected on a JEM2100 electron microscope under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical compositions were measured using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to the TEM microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on an ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα excitation source (ThermoFisher Scientific). UV-visible absorption spectra of the powder samples were recorded using Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometers. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-170SX Fourier transform spectrometer (KBr) within the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1.
Photoelectric measurement
A sandwich-structured ITO/Sb2S3/ITO device was made to measure the photoelectronic properties of the as-prepared Sb2S3 samples.29 ITO/glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically using acetone and ethanol and then dried at 100 °C before use in the device fabrication. The resistance of the ITO conductive film in the ITO/glass substrates is 15 Ω. In detail, a concentrated ethanol solution of the Sb2S3 NR/CuSCN composite was drop-cast on ITO films, and after being dried at 80 °C two pieces of ITO/glass coated with a CuSCN/Sb2S3 layer were assembled together using two clips and some of the ITO films were set aside serving as conductive electrodes (refer to Fig. 5a). A xenon lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter of 400 nm served as a light source with an output wavelength range of 400–780 nm. Monochromatic visible light of different wavelengths was obtained by using optical filters (e.g., blue 450 nm, green 550 nm, red 650 nm). The light intensity was controlled by changing the distance between the xenon lamp and the device. The intensity of white light is maintained to be 80 mW cm−2 while that of three kinds of visible light is 18 mW cm−2. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and the time-dependent current (I–t) curves were recorded with a two-probe model by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e) under ambient conditions. The I–t data for the self-powered photodetectors with light on/off cycles were collected at an applied bias of 0 V. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data for the CuSCN/Sb2S3 photodetectors were measured without any bias on an external quantum efficiency measurement system (Newport/Oriel, QEPV-SI) equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp. All of the photoelectric measurements were conducted under an ambient environment.
Results and discussion
Sb2S3 is known to have two typical crystallographic forms, the non-crystalline amorphous state (a-Sb2S3) and the crystalline stibnite phase (c-Sb2S3), for which increasing the preparation (or annealing) temperature is a common method to enable the amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformation.31c–f,38,39 In our work, it is found that the addition of a small quantity of Bi ions is able to prompt the crystallinity of Sb2S3 and lower the crystallization temperature. As revealed by the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, the synthesis performed at 170 °C (or lower temperatures40) produced the amorphous a-Sb2S3 sample whereas the same temperature led to the yield of crystalline c-Sb2S3 when a trace amount of Bi ions (1–2% molar ratio of Bi/Sb) was introduced into the synthesis (other reaction conditions were kept constant, see details in the Experimental section). At a higher synthetic temperature, for example, ≥200 °C, the syntheses proceeding with or without adding Bi ions could both produce crystalline c-Sb2S3 (Fig. 1). In our experimental system of long-chain primary amines, the crystallization temperature range for Sb2S3 was found to be approximately 180–190 °C. The crystal structure of all the as-prepared crystalline samples can be readily assigned to the stibnite phase Sb2S3 (JCPDS no. 65-2434; S.G.: Pnma, a = 11.30 Å, b = 3.834 Å, c = 11.221 Å).29,31c–f,38,39

Besides the crystallinity, Bi ions also affect the morphologies of the Sb2S3 products, as clearly verified by the TEM studies (Fig. 2, as well as the SEM images shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†). In brief, the a-Sb2S3 sample synthesized at 170 °C in the absence of Bi ions shows a 2D nanosheet morphology and non-crystalline nature40 as revealed by the electron diffraction pattern (ED) (inset of Fig. 2a); under the same conditions the addition of Bi ions leads to highly disperse c-Sb2S3 NRs (Fig. 2b). They have a thin mean diameter of about 20–40 nm and a length of about 500 nm, which are not significantly influenced by the addition time of Bi ions during the synthesis. The HRTEM image and FFT pattern (Fig. 2c) prove the high crystallinity of these NRs, consistent with the XRD results. At the synthetic temperature of 210 °C, the absence and presence of Bi ions resulted in the production of crystalline large-sized NR-bundles (Fig. 2d) and thinner separated NRs (Fig. 2e), respectively. It is clearly observed that these sheaf-like NR-bundles (which could be formed at 210 °C after a reaction time of typically 30–120 min) are composed of many subordinate NRs with each individual NR being a single crystal as revealed by HRTEM measurements (Fig. S2†). Additional SEM and TEM images for the morphology characteristics of c-Sb2S3 NR-bundles and separated NRs are displayed in Fig. S1 and S2.† The separated, thin NRs formed at 210 °C have a mean diameter and length dependent on the addition time of Bi ions: the later they are added within the reaction time range of 30–60 min, the larger these parameters are. As compared, c-Sb2S3 NRs generated at 210 °C have a relatively large diameter and length than those obtained at 170 °C (Fig. S1†). The highly disperse, separated c-Sb2S3 NRs that are obtained at 210 °C also exhibit high crystallinity and a single-crystal feature (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, the c-Sb2S3 NRs, obtained at either 170 °C or 210 °C, and the NRs in the rod-bundles produced at 210 °C share a preferred growth characteristic, that is, they tend to grow along the [010] direction of the stibnite phase, as revealed by HRTEM imaging (Fig. 2c and f and S2c†).
 Fig. 2  TEM and HRTEM images and the corresponding ED or FFT patterns recorded on the Sb2S3 samples synthesized under different conditions: (a) 170 °C, without Bi ions; (b and c) 170 °C, 1% Bi; (d) 210 °C, without Bi ions; (e and f) 210 °C, 1% Bi. 
On the basis of the differences in the morphologies, crystalline states and synthetic temperatures, two different growth mechanisms are proposed to explain the formation of the highly-disperse, separated c-Sb2S3 NRs. The sheaf-like rod-bundles or other analogous hierarchical structures that are made of secondary crystalline NRs or NWs have been frequently formed in V2–VI3 crystals.16–19,22–29 Their formation has been ascribed to the partial splitting crystal growth mechanism, which stems from the weak vdW interactions between the covalent 1D [V4VI6]n ribbons in V2–VI3 crystals.16,22,23 Our present work shows that the addition of Bi ions enables the yield of highly disperse, separated c-Sb2S3 NRs, whereas crystalline rod-bundles (or sheaf-like hierarchical structures) are formed without addition of Bi ions. This means that Bi ions induce complete splitting growth of c-Sb2S3 crystals into separated NRs at 210 °C. This growth regime is backed up by the fact that the same favourable growth direction ([010]) is measured in both the separated NRs and the NRs in rod-bundles (Fig. 2c and f and S2c†).
On the other hand, the introduction of Bi ions decreases the crystallization temperature of Sb2S3 and makes amorphous (non-crystalline) 2D Sb2S3 nanosheets transform into crystalline 1D separated NRs at a relatively low temperature of 170 °C. Such crystallinity and shape transformation is considered to come from a seeded growth mechanism. Because Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 are isostructural, ternary (BixSb1−x)2S3 solid-solution seeds will be easily formed after Bi ions are introduced.28,29,41,42 The chemical composition measurements from the EDS spectra, recorded on at least 15 individual Sb2S3 NRs, provide proof for the formation of (BixSb1−x)2S3 isostructural seeds. As shown in Fig. 3, it is measured that there is a high concentration of Bi in the middle region of the as-obtained Sb2S3 NRs whereas there is a very low or undetectable content of Bi in the two end segments. Such a distribution of Bi element strongly suggests the possibility of the (BixSb1−x)2S3 seeded growth of Sb2S3 NRs, like the elemental distribution in CdSe-seeded synthesis of CdSe@CdS NRs.43 In the initial (BixSb1−x)2S3 solid-solution seeds, the proportion of Bi is higher than or at least equal to that of Sb, or even pure Bi2S3 may be formed as seeds because of its low solubility product constant (Ksp = 1 × 10−97)44 and relatively low crystallization temperature.40 In many reports,45,46 isolated, highly disperse Bi2S3 NRs are more easily formed in the growth solution of oleylamine (OLA). This may be a reason for the phenomenon that the introduction of Bi ions induces seeded growth, which simultaneously promotes the crystallization of Sb2S3 crystals from the amorphous state and makes them grow into highly-disperse, separated NRs.

Sb2S3 thin films or nanostructured materials have been used as photoelectronic materials in solar cells and photodetectors.21,30–32,37 However, the use of long-chain surfactants such as oleylamine (OLA) and dodecylamine (DA) that surround the nanomaterials suppresses the photoelectronic performance.6,29,47 Therefore, the surfactant removal is an effective method to enhance the photoelectronic response of Sb2S3 NRs. In the meantime, CuSCN has been exploited as a typical p-type conductor due to its capability to trap and transfer photoexcited holes31a–c,33b,c,35–37,48–50 and shows suitable electronic coupling and band alignment with Sb2S3 for the application of performance-enhanced solar cells.37 Here we demonstrate the removal of long-chain amine ligands and the coupling with p-CuSCN to improve the photo-conductivity and -response of the as-obtained Sb2S3 NRs for their use in UV-visible broad-spectrum self-powered photodetectors.
In a typical procedure, half of a batch of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 NRs, which were first dispersed in n-hexane (5 mL), was mixed with a DMF solution of CuSCN (0.02–0.1 mmol CuSCN/10 mL DMF); the mixture was magnetically stirred for 15–20 h. Such a procedure is able to transfer the NRs from n-hexane to DMF (inset of Fig. 4a) and simultaneously realizes the removal of long-chain ligands and the preparation of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 NR composite. FT-IR spectra were measured to characterize the organic groups in the Sb2S3 NR samples obtained before and after surface ligand removal. As shown in Fig. 4a, the sharp decrease or even the disappearance of the peaks at 2925 and 2850 cm−1 for the stretching vibrations of CH2 is indicative of the removal/reduction of organic surfactants;47 the peak around 2175 cm−1 is from the cyano group (CN) of SCN, showing evidence for the presence of CuSCN in the Sb2S3 NR samples.
 Fig. 4  (a) FT-IR spectra of the pristine Sb2S3 NRs (top) and the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite (bottom); (b and c) Cu 2p and N 1s high-resolution XPS spectra. The decrease or even the disappearance of the characteristic peaks of CH2 and the presence of CN peaks in the FT-IR spectra indicate the removal of the surfactant and the CuSCN in the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite, respectively. The CO2 IR peaks (2363 and 2340 cm−1) are due to the adsorption of CO2 in the sample from the air environment.47 The inset of panel (a) shows the optical photograph of the NR distribution in the n-hexane/DMF two phases before and after the removal of surfactants.

The intensity of white light is 80 mW cm−2 while that of three kinds of visible light is 18 mW cm−2. 
Meanwhile, the XPS studies further prove the formation of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. As shown in Fig. S3,† Sb, Bi, S, Cu, C and N elements are detected in the XPS spectrum; the high-resolution XPS spectra show that Sb mainly comes from Sb2S3 NRs, accompanied by a certain amount of surface oxide (Sb–O);29,31e the XPS peaks for the S 2p core levels can be classified into two pair peaks with different binding energies (BEs): one pair located at 161.2 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.3 eV (S 2p1/2) are attributed to Sb–S of Sb2S3 and the other pair located at 162.8 eV (S 2p3/2) and 163.9 eV (S 2p1/2) correspond to S–CN of CuSCN; the weak Bi signals are due to trace amounts of Bi ions that are added to induce the growth of Sb2S3 NRs (Fig. S3c†). The BE values of Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, which are respectively located at 952.2 and 932.4 eV (Fig. 4b), are in good agreement with monovalent Cu+ from CuSCN.50 There are three peaks in the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4c), having BE values of 398.4, 399.8 and 401.8 eV, which are due to CN, CN and N–H,50,51 respectively. N 1s in CN has a peak much stronger than that in CN or N–H, indicating that SCN groups are the dominant form in the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. Moreover, CuSCN, existing in a solid-phase crystalline hexagonal structure (β-phase, S.G.: R3m; PCPDF# 73-1855),49,50 can be directly detected by XRD for such a composite (Fig. S4†) as a relatively high concentration of CuSCN/DMF solution was used (>0.01 mmol CuSCN/10 mL DMF).
As is known, β-phase CuSCN exhibits p-type conductivity with a band gap of ≥3.6 eV (∼344 nm),35b,36,48–50 while crystalline c-Sb2S3 (stibnite) is commonly an n-type semiconductor.30b,31d,32e Therefore, the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite contains a large amount of p–n heterointerfaces, which are favorable for the photogenerated electron–hole (e–h) separation and carrier transport and thus for the high performance solar cells31a–c,37,49 and (self-powered) photodetectors.32e,33a–d,34b,35a,48,52–55 c-Sb2S3 nanomaterial-based photodetectors have been reported, most of which are operated with the need of an externally applied bias.21,32a–c Recently, Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD inorganic–organic hybrid thin films could serve as p–n junction diodes for high performance self-powered photodetectors.32e Most recently, a mixture of amorphous–crystalline Sb2S3 was found to show good response performance for zero-biased visible-detection due to the presence of a large amount of amorphous–crystalline two-phase heterointerfaces.32d Here we fabricated an ITO/material/ITO model device (Fig. 5a) to evaluate the photoelectric properties of Sb2S3 NR/CuSCN nanocomposites for their possible application in self-powered photodetectors.

Fig. 5c shows the representative current–voltage (I–V) curves of the as-fabricated device under different illumination conditions. An obvious increase of photocurrent is detected as the device is exposed to light (white light and visible light of 450, 550 and 650 nm), which indicates a high optical sensitivity of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. The photosensitivity to visible light is in agreement with the absorption feature in the UV-visible region measured for the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite (Fig. 5b). Importantly, the photocurrent at the zero applied bias is not zero as observed in the low-voltage region of the I–V curves (Fig. 5d), which is indicative of the photovoltaic effect derived from the p–n junctions.48,52
At the same time, the temporal time-dependent current (I–t) measurements were carried out on the device at the external applied bias of 0 V. In the I–t curves, a periodic change in the photo- and dark current takes place with the on/off switch of light irradiation (Fig. 5e). The on/off ratio for the photocurrent to dark current is evaluated to be 102 under the white light illumination. Such a current change is reversible and almost constant, revealing the superior photoswitch characteristic, photostability and great potential of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite in self-powered photodetection. Our device also shows impressive optical response and switching ability to the torch light of iPhone 7s (Fig. S5a†). Furthermore, the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite is very sensitive to 365 nm UV light (3 mW cm−2) at the 0 V bias and can be applied for self-powered UV photodetectors, as demonstrated in the I–t measurements (Fig. S5b†).
In addition, the response speeds (the response time tr, the time needed to reach 90% of the maximum photocurrent when the light is turned on, and the decay time td, the time needed to drop to 90% of the maximum photocurrent when the light is turned off;18,21 see Fig. 5f) for this self-powered photodetector are assessed by the individual enlarged on/off switch cycle in the I–t curve, which are respectively estimated to be tr = 0.18 and td = 0.15 s. These values measured under our experimental conditions are comparable to the existing response and decay times reported for Sb2S3-based photodetectors.32a–d For performance comparison, the device parameters, including the material constituents, device structure, working bias, irradiation wavelength and intensity, and response speed, of some typical photodetectors composed of Sb2S3 and/or p-CuSCN components are provided in Table 1. The status, progress, and device parameters of representative (self-powered) photodetectors that were made of other photoelectronic materials can be found in a few recent review papers.52–55 Furthermore, another important performance parameter to assess the photoelectric conversion ability of photodetectors is the external quantum efficiency (EQE),54,55,57,58 which can be defined as the ratio between the number of electron–hole pairs contributing to the photocurrent and the number of incident photons.54 Instead, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data for the CuSCN/Sb2S3 photodetectors were measured in our work. IPCE is equivalent to EQE for photoelectronic devices. The wavelength-dependent IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. S6,† showing IPCE values ranging 0.055–0.086% in the visible region. Such photoelectric conversion efficiency values are comparable to or just a little lower than those of other inorganic photodetectors made of, for example, 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides,54,55 but much lower than those of organic photodetectors.57 Organic photodetectors usually work on a photomultiplication mechanism and they generally show very high EQE.57

Below we will discuss the photoelectronic mechanism for the self-powered photodetector made of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. It is proposed that the formation of point-to-surface heterojunctions,32c,59–61 that is, the p–n junctions between p-CuSCN tiny crystals (or crystal clusters) and n-Sb2S3 NRs in our work (Fig. 6a), facilitates the photoexcited carrier (e and h) separation and transfer and then leads to the enhancement of photoconductance and fast photoswitch performance of the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite at the external bias of 0 V. When irradiated by light with a photon energy higher than the Eg energy of Sb2S3, electrons will be excited onto the conduction band (CB) and holes are left within the valence band (VB); because of the suitable band alignment37 and the built-in electric field (Eb)52–55 at the interface of p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3 (Fig. 6b), the photogenerated holes will be transferred to and trapped by p-CuSCN at the interface, which reduces the e–h recombination and boosts the photoexcited free electron mobility and transport within Sb2S3 NRs as well as the electron transfer from Sb2S3 to the ITO electrode. Importantly, the point/plane contact generates large exposed surface areas of Sb2S3 NRs and allows intimate contact between the neighboring Sb2S3 NRs as well as good contact between the Sb2S3 layer and the ITO electrode, thus facilitating the photoelectron transport and conductance within the whole CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite. Our TEM and HRTEM imaging results provide solid proof for the presence of the point-to-surface contact of small CuSCN crystal clusters on the surface of Sb2S3 NRs; the size of p-CuSCN clusters is far smaller than the surface area of individual Sb2S3 NRs (Fig. 6c and d).
 Fig. 6  (a and b) Schematic diagrams of the point-to-surface contact and band alignment between p-CuSCN crystal clusters and n-Sb2S3 NRs; (c and d) TEM and HRTEM images of the p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3 composite, showing the attachment of small CuSCN crystal clusters at the surfaces of Sb2S3 NRs. 
On the other hand, different from the large-area two-layer planar p–n junctions for photodetectors or photodiodes that show obviously a photovoltaic effect,48,52 the point-to-surface contact p–n junctions form a small-area Eb (or a very low capacitance made up of positively and negatively space-charged region) at the interfaces of p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3, and accordingly give rise to the fast photoresponse and switching speed. Similarly, point-contact electronic devices such as transistors and diodes have been investigated widely.62,63 The low Eb due to the point-contact p–n junctions is the reason for the presence of a weak photovoltaic effect, which has been verified by the nearly linear I–V ohmic characteristic in the window of −1–+1 V (Fig. 5c). But the I–V curve does not pass through the original point: very low Voc (open circuit voltage) and Isc (short circuit current) are detectable in the enlarged low-voltage part of the I–V curve (Fig. 5d).48 As compared, a control experiment shows that a high content of p-CuSCN in the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite, prepared by increasing the concentration of the CuSCN/DMF solution (from 0.02 to 0.08 and 0.1 mol L−1), degrades the temporal optical response and switch speed (Fig. S7†). TEM studies reveal that a relatively large amount of the p-CuSCN component would increase the interfacial charged region area between p-CuSCN and n-Sb2S3 (or a shell/core structure with p-CuSCN covering the whole n-Sb2S3 NRs, Fig. S7†) and then cause a relaxation or delay to some extent during the photoexcited e–h separation and non-radiative recombination, which is considered to contribute to the slow photoswitch speed and long response intervals for the photodetectors.
Conclusions
In summary, a tiny amount of isovalent Bi3+ ions (Bi/Sb = 1–2 atom%) was found to be efficient for the synthesis of highly-disperse, separated c-Sb2S3 NRs. Bi ions induced two crystal growth mechanisms, i.e., the full splitting growth above the crystallization temperature of Sb2S3 and the (BixSb1−x)2S3-seeded growth mechanism below the crystallization temperature of Sb2S3, both of which were able to produce separated, thinner Sb2S3 NRs. The investigations of Bi element distribution within the Sb2S3 NRs gave evidence for the (BixSb1−x)2S3-seeded mechanism. A composite between p-CuSCN crystal clusters and n-Sb2S3 NRs was further constructed and characterized in detail, which exhibited superior photoresponse and switching performance in the self-powered UV-visible photodetection. The formation of point-to-surface contact p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3 junctions as supported by TEM studies and their suitable band level alignment were illustrated, which could well account for the resultant weak photovoltaic effect and the self-powered UV-visible detection ability of p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3 photodetectors. It is considered that our work offers a practical method to prepare highly-disperse, separated V2VI3 NRs by using external ions or seeds and that these NRs would find great potential in photoelectronic devices when coupled with electron and/or hole transfer conductors.

 	Fig. 2  TEM and HRTEM images and the corresponding ED or FFT patterns recorded on the Sb2S3 samples synthesized under different conditions: (a) 170 °C, without Bi ions; (b and c) 170 °C, 1% Bi; (d) 210 °C, without Bi ions; (e and f) 210 °C, 1% Bi.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a and b) TEM images of two individual Sb2S3 NRs obtained at 170 °C in the presence of Bi ions; (c and d) EDS spectra recorded on the middle and end parts (highlighted with frames) of the Sb2S3 NRs shown in (a and b). Cu, Fe and Co signals are from the TEM Cu grid.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) FT-IR spectra of the pristine Sb2S3 NRs (top) and the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite (bottom); (b and c) Cu 2p and N 1s high-resolution XPS spectra. The decrease or even the disappearance of the characteristic peaks of CH2 and the presence of CN peaks in the FT-IR spectra indicate the removal of the surfactant and the CuSCN in the CuSCN/Sb2S3 composite, respectively. The CO2 IR peaks (2363 and 2340 cm−1) are due to the adsorption of CO2 in the sample from the air environment.47 The inset of panel (a) shows the optical photograph of the NR distribution in the n-hexane/DMF two phases before and after the removal of surfactants.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic illustration of the ITO/CuSCN–Sb2S3/ITO photodetector (inset is the photograph of a real device); (b) UV-visible absorption spectra of CuSCN/Sb2S3 composites prepared at different concentrations of CuSCN/DMF solution; (c and d) I–V curves and their enlarged origin region (−50–+50 mV) recorded on the photodetectors made of the p-CuSCN/n-Sb2S3 composite under different illumination conditions; (e) I–t curves for the above photodetectors recorded under different illumination conditions at the zero bias; (f) response (tr) and decay (td) times of the photodetectors under white light irradiation at the applied bias of 0 V. The intensity of white light is 80 mW cm−2 while that of three kinds of visible light is 18 mW cm−2.
