    , Accepted 6th January 2021First published on 7th January 2021AbstractDefects at the grain boundary, surface and interface, acting as nonradiative recombination centers, result in considerable energy loss of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we passivated the defects of polycrystalline perovskite films with acetamidine halide (AAI or AABr) and identified their energy loss before and after passivation. We find that the trap state densities are 9.20 × 1015 cm−3 and 9.62 × 1015 cm−3 for AAI-treated and AABr-treated perovskite films, lower than 1.09 × 1016 cm−3 for the pristine film. As a result, PSCs with configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag achieve a champion PCE of 22.0% with AAI treatment and 21.5% with AABr treatment, higher than 20.4% PCE for the pristine PSCs. In LED mode, the maximum electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies (EQEEL) are 4.06% and 3.45% for AAI and AABr passivated PSCs, respectively, higher than 0.94% for the pristine device. EQEEL values are 1.26%, 1.20% and 0.40% under an injection current of photocurrent for AAI, AABr and pristine PSCs suggesting that the nonradiative VOC loss is 112 mV, 114 mV and 142 mV, respectively. In terms of charge transfer loss, fill factor reduction is estimated to be 6.3%, 7.0% and 7.4% for AAI, AABr and pristine films, respectively. Passivation using acetamidine halide can significantly improve the energy loss and improve stability.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% in a small area,1 which exceeds that of thin film solar cells, such as CdTe and CIGS. The high performances are due to excellent properties of perovskite films such as ambipolar carrier transfer capabilities,2 long charge-carrier diffusion lengths,2,3 and high absorption coefficients (105 cm−1).4,5 Therefore, PSCs have attracted significant attention in the past decade, and plenty of studies mainly focus on the enhancement of efficiency and stability by optimizing the device architecture, film deposition process, and material composition.6–10 Since the perovskite layer is related to grain nucleation and growth through solution processes, there are lots of defects at the grain boundary and surface, which can potentially limit the performance.11 Thus, various passivators such as polymers, small molecules, and ionic liquids12–15 have been developed to enhance efficiencies through defect passivation in the perovskite layer and the interface between the perovskite layer and electron/hole transport layer (ETL/HTL), leading to reduced photovoltage loss (ΔVOC) within PSCs.16,17 Therefore, minimizing the perovskite film and interfacial nonradiative losses is a crucial approach to enhance the performance of PSCs especially by inserting a layer of insulating layer (such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA))12 or a semi-conductor polymer13,18–20 at the perovskite/HTL interface to ameliorate nucleation and crystal growth. However, polymers are soluble in chlorobenzene (CB), and the subsequent coating of the HTL/ETL will remove the interfacial passivation layer, leading to incomplete passivation of defects in the perovskite film.
It has been demonstrated that slightly residual PbI2 on the surface can effectively passivate the perovskite film and enhance device performance,21 which is mainly due to facile charge extraction.22 However, the nonuniform distribution of PbI2 negates its beneficial effect on charge extraction but creates recombination sites. Thus, these sites need to be passivated. Several groups have reported that two-dimensional (2D) perovskites using alkyl ammonium salts can effectively improve the efficiency and stability of devices through the formation of a grade structure with three-dimensional (3D) perovskites.14,23 Chen and co-workers24 introduced phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) for in situ growth of a 2D PEA2PbI4 passivation layer on the surface of a perovskite film, leading to simultaneous improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability. Jung and co-workers25 inserted a layer of wide bandgap halide perovskite between the perovskite active layer and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTL and the device had an efficiency of 22.7% with excellent stability at 85% relative humidity (RH). Yoo and co-workers26 also showed a unique combination of linear alkyl ammonium bromides and chloroform to passivate the surface and grain boundary and found VOC loss to be only 0.34 V. Recently, Jiang and co-workers27 spin-coated the organic halide salt PEAI on the surface of a perovskite film at a low temperature. A 23.3% record efficiency was achieved in combination with 1.18 V VOC and EQEEL of 7%. However, there are much fewer reports on passivation using short chain ammonium salts and it is also desirable to quantify the energy loss in more detail.
In this work, we post-treated a perovskite thin film using acetamidine iodide/bromide (AAI/AABr) and identified the energy loss before and after passivation. Acetamidinium (AA+) has stronger chemical bonding with the perovskite to stabilize its crystal structure compared with MA+, due to the delocalized π-electron cloud over the N–C–N bond.28,29 As a result, we found that AAI and AABr modified perovskites could mitigate trap states and facilitate charge extraction to enhance the performance and stability. The defect density of the perovskite film was decreased to 9.20 × 1015 cm−3 for the AAI treated perovskite film and 9.62 × 1015 cm−3 for the AABr treated perovskite film from 1.09 × 1016 cm−3. Finally, we demonstrated that the devices based on planar conversional architecture of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/stannic oxide (SnO2)/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/sliver (Ag) can achieve a champion PCE of 22.0% with AAI treatment and 21.5% with AABr treatment, which were higher than 20.4% for the pristine PSCs. In LED mode, the maximum electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies (EQEEL) are 4.06% and 3.45% for AAI and AABr passivated PSCs, respectively, higher than 0.94% for the pristine device. EQEEL values of 1.26%, 1.22% and 0.40% under an injection current of photocurrent for AAI, AABr and pristine PSCs, suggest nonradiative VOC loss of 112 mV, 114 mV and 142 mV, respectively. In terms of charge transfer loss, the fill factor reduction is estimated to be 6.3%, 7.0% and 7.4% for AAI, AABr and pristine films, respectively. More importantly, the devices with the AAI/AABr treated perovskite film have degradation less than 10% when stored over 120 days in a glove box filled with argon.
Results and discussion
Acetamidinium (AA+) has stronger chemical bonding with the perovskite to stabilize its crystal structure.28,29 As shown in the molecular structure in Fig. 1a, AA+ has a restricted C–N bond rotation due to the delocalized π-electron cloud over the N–C–N bond, which strengthens the resultant N–H⋯I bond at both terminals. Therefore, we introduce acetamidinium salts (AAI and AABr) as a surface passivation layer to passivate the surface excessive PbI2 of the two-step fabricated perovskite film in planar conversional devices with a configuration of glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The corresponding detailed fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1b and the detailed description of the fabrication process is shown in the Experimental section in the ESI.†

First, the surface morphologies of pristine and AAI/AABr treated perovskite films were characterized with top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (Fig. 2a, c and S1†). The pristine perovskite film shows clearly excessive bright PbI2 domains that are randomly distributed on the thin film. Residual PbI2 with a uniform distribution was widely reported to be beneficial to improve performance, yet too much of PbI2 and a nonuniform distribution were harmful to device performance.21,22 AAI or AABr treatment can help overcome these imperfections on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2b and c. The grain size of the perovskite film becomes a little larger. We used a nanomeasurer to count the average grain size in the SEM images (Fig. S1†) and found that the grain size of the perovskite film increased from 680 nm in the pristine film to 890 nm and 870 nm after treatment with AAI and AABr (Fig. S1a†), respectively. And this trend becomes more obvious with the increasing concentration of AAI/AABr (AAX) solution, as shown in Fig. S1c–h.† The increased grain size can be attributed to ripening by the post-treatment because the IPA solution can facilitate the dissolution of the unstable small grains and reassembly into large grains.30 The as-formed AAPbX3 by the reaction between PbI2 and both AAX and AAX salts can passivate the dangling bonds on the surface. The white spots could be AAI/AABr residue because the more AAX solution we added, the greater the number of spots produced on the surface. The AAPbX3 compound can be verified using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks located at 11.4° and 25.5°, which match well with those of the film deposited by using AAI to react with PbI2.29 Moreover, the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S3† also demonstrated that the size of the perovskite grains has become larger, and it can also be found that the surface of the perovskite films becomes flatter after AAI/AABr treatment. Fig. 2d shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the pristine, AAI and AABr treated perovskite films, which demonstrates that the perovskite treated with AAI or AABr does not change the optical absorption edge.

(d) UV-vis absorption spectra; (e) XRD and (f) XPS spectra of the I 3d peak. All the samples were treated with 1 mg mL−1 AAI or AABr solution in IPA solvent. 
XRD measurements were performed to study the phase purity. As shown in Fig. 2e, there is a sharp peak with strong intensity around 12.8° identified as PbI2 and slightly lower than the main characteristic diffraction peak of perovskite (110) at 14.1° in the pristine film, indicating excessive PbI2 on the perovskite surface. It is noted that the intensity of the diffraction peak of PbI2 is appreciably decreased after AAI and AABr treatment suggesting a lower PbI2 content in the perovskite layer, which is beneficial for improving the performance due to the probable interaction between AA+ and PbI2. This result further demonstrated that AAI and AABr effectively passivated the perovskite film and enhanced phase purity. Interestingly, we carefully compared the perovskite diffraction peak of (110) and (220). As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the diffraction peaks were slightly shifted to small angles. The peak shift could be ascribed to the ion exchange between FAMA-based perovskite and AA+ cations.28,29 Thus, AAI/AABr not only can passivate residual PbI2 in the perovskite surface, but also can passivate the FAMA-based perovskite film by ion exchange. To directly study the interaction between the perovskite film and AAI/AABr passivators, we adopted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to further analyse the chemical environment of the pristine and AAI/AABr treated perovskite films, in which the XPS peak shift is associated with electron bond polarization between the nearest-neighbour atoms. Fig. 2f and S5b† show the high-resolution XPS spectra of I 3d and Pb 4f for the pristine film and AAI/AABr treated perovskite film, all calibrated with C 1s. The I 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks located at 631.0 and 619.5 eV shift to lower binding energies of 630.9 and 619.4 eV and 4f7/2 peaks located at 143.3 and 138.4 eV shift to lower binding energies of 143.2 and 138.3 eV for the AAI/AABr treated perovskite film. All the above results strongly indicate that there is a strong interaction between PbI2 and AA+. It is proposed that the excessive PbI2 on the surface of the pristine perovskite film can be effectively passivated by treating with AAI/AABr.
Then, we fabricated planar PSCs with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag and estimated the performance of the device with AAI and AABr treated perovskite films. The detailed fabrication process can be found in the Experimental section of the ESI.† The deposition process of AAI/AABr was carefully optimized by adjusting the concentration to 0.5, 1.0 and 2 mg mL−1 in IPA solution and the performance of the corresponding PSCs is summarized in Fig. S6 and Table S1.†Fig. 3a exhibits the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best pristine devices and the best devices treated with AAI and AABr, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the pristine device shows a maximum PCE of 20.4%, with a VOC of 1.14 V, JSC of 23.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.1% in the reverse scan (from 1.2 V to −0.2 V, RS) direction. However the champion device with AAI treatment delivers a PCE of 22.0%, with a VOC of 1.16 V, JSC of 24.37 mA cm−2 and FF of 78.0%. The calculated JSC from integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 3d) spectrum is 22.23 mA cm−2, which is close to JSC from the J–V curves, indicating that the measurements in this study are reliable. Meanwhile the device treated with AABr also shows a high PCE of 21.5%, with a VOC of 1.15 V, JSC of 24.08 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.4% in the RS; the calculated JSC from integrating the EQE (Fig. 3d) spectrum is 22.18 mA cm−2. The maximum power points (MPPs) for a steady PCE are 21.45% for AAI and 20.70% for AABr devices. From the J–V curves of the FS and RS (Fig. S7a–c† for pristine, AAI and AABr, respectively), it can be found that hysteresis is also greatly suppressed (Table S2†). Fig. 3d–g show the statistical distributions of detailed photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) for 18 PSCs. It can be concluded that AAI and AABr treated perovskites can boost the performance of PSCs mainly ascribed to the increased VOC and JSC, as well as small enhancement of the FF. The promoted VOC, JSC and PCE as well as negligible hysteresis behaviour of the AAI and AABr passivated devices together exhibit convincing evidence that the surface trap states of the perovskite film can be effectively passivated. Meanwhile, PEAI and guanidinium iodide (GAI) were also applied as surface passivators and the PCEs of the corresponding devices were also enhanced obviously (Table S3 in the ESI†).

To investigate the dynamics of the charge carrier transfer process, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved PL (TRPL) spectra have been recorded based on perovskite films on an ITO/SnO2 substrate. Fig. S8† shows the PL peak at ∼807 nm. The PL intensity became much stronger after the perovskite film was treated with AAI and AABr, suggesting great suppression of nonradiative recombination. The TRPL decay was determined at 807 nm with an excitation wavelength of a 373 nm laser diode and the corresponding TRPL curves were fitted with the bi-exponential function, which includes a fast component (lifetime τ1, and weight fraction f1) and a slow component (lifetime τ2, and weight fraction f2), corresponding to the quenching process of photogeneration of free carriers of perovskite through charge transfer from the perovskite to the SnO2 ETLs and radiative recombination in the perovskite film, respectively.31,32 The TRPL decay in Fig. 4a witnesses a prolonged quenching time after AAI and AABr treatments, and undoubtedly reveals an enhanced carrier lifetime. The detailed parameters extracted from fitting curves are summarized in Table S4.† For the pristine perovskite film, the dominant ratio of τ1 (f1 = 61.47%) indicates the effective carrier extraction of the SnO2 ETL from the perovskite film. As expected, such a dominating effect can be reversed by treating with AAI/AABr, such as AAI (f2 = 70.51%) or AABr (f2 = 64.28%), accompanying a longer average lifetime (75.40 ns for AAI and 83.73 ns for AABr). This indicates a lower trap density in AAI/AABr treated perovskite films.

To gain more insight into the impact of AAI/AABr treatment on the recombination kinetics of carriers in perovskite films, we measured the light intensity dependent J–V curves. Fig. 4b shows the light intensity dependent VOC, and the slope of VOCversus lnPlight is equal to kT/q if the recombination is dominated by bimolecular recombination.32 PSCs with AAI or AABr treated perovskite films have similar and smaller slopes, which are 1.72 kT/q and 1.69 kT/q, respectively, while the PSCs with a pristine film have a large slope, 1.95 kT/q. The slope values of AAI and AABr treated devices decrease, which indicates suppressed trap-assisted recombination due to AA+ sufficient passivation of the perovskite film. The defect density was further confirmed by space charge limit current (SCLC) analysis. The dark J–V curves at the semi-log scale of hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag are shown in Fig. 4c. We evaluated the trap-state density via the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), obtained from nt = 2εε0VTFL/(qL2),3,33 where q is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and VTFL is the trap-filling limit voltage. The trap densities were calculated to be 1.09 × 1016, 9.20 × 1015 and 9.62 × 1015 cm−3 for the devices with pristine, AAI and AABr treated perovskite films, respectively (Table S5 in the ESI†). As expected, both the devices with AAI or AABr passivation layers showed lower nt values, which further confirm that the AAI/AABr passivation layer effectively suppresses the surface defects and reduces charge recombination at the interface.

Fig. 4d displays the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots for the pristine, AAI and AABr treatment devices, 1/C2versus the voltage attained by EIS measurements. We can obtain the charge concentration and the built-in potential by using eqn (1). (1)where C is the depletion-layer capacitance, A is the active area, ε is the relative permittivity (= 32 is used in this work), q is the unit electronic charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), N is the charge concentration, φbi is the built-in potential at equilibrium, and V is the applied voltage. From eqn (1), we can obtain the charge concentration of the substrate (−2/(qεN)) from the slope, and obtain the built-in potential (φbi − 2kT/q) from the intercept of 1/C2 = 0.34,35 According to Fig. 4d, it is found that the slope of the AAI and AABr treated devices increased to 1.80 × 1017 for AAI and 1.78 × 1017 for AABr from 1.13 × 1017 for pristine devices, showing that after passivation with AAI/AABr, charge extraction is greatly enhanced and the charge density is reduced at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD HTL interface. Moreover, Vbi can be extracted from the intercept with the voltage axis in the 1/C2versus V curves.36 It shows a similar trend with the VOC values from the J–V curves. The higher Vbi values mean the increased driving force to separate photogenerated carriers and the efficient suppression of charge recombination, which is a critical factor for achieving high VOC and simultaneously enhancing other photovoltaic parameters.
AAI/AABr effectively passivated the defects on the perovskite surface and eliminated the non-radiative recombination channel at the interface between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL, finally leading to an increase of the VOC of the device, as well as an expected increase in electroluminescence efficiency (Fig. 5a–c). Under the conditions of the bias voltage, the solar cells can be operated as a light-emitting diode (LED), and EQEEL can be used to assess the recombination in the devices. A higher radiative recombination emission efficiency indicates low voltage loss (ΔVOC) within PSCs based on eqn (2):37,38 (2)where EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency when the injection current in the dark is similar to the photocurrent (Jph) of the device under AM 1.5 G light illumination. Fig. 5a–c show the EL spectra of pristine, AAI and AABr PSCs operating as a LED, respectively. It is found that devices show EL in the near IR/red spectral range with an emission peak located at 796 nm (Fig. 5a–c). Fig. S9† shows the plot of current density and radiance as a function of the voltage. The maximum radiance of AAI PSCs can reach around 50 W s−1 m2. Furthermore, Fig. 5d shows the EQEEL spectra and the photograph of the AAI light-emitting PSCs. It is found that the device can even emit at a lower applied voltage (1.0 V), which is lower than the absorption threshold of the corresponding perovskite active layer (1.55 eV). This violation in terms of energy conservation could be explained by heat extracted from the diode.39 The maximum EQEEL is 4.06% and 3.45% for AAI and AABr passivated PSCs, respectively. Compared to the pristine device with an EQEEL of 0.94%, this result is consistent with the increased VOC for AAI/AABr passivated devices. EQEEL values are 1.26%, 1.20% and 0.40% under an injection current of JSC (equal to JSC = Jph) for AAI, AABr and pristine films, respectively, corresponding to the nonradiative VOC loss of 112 mV, 114 mV and 142 mV based on eqn (2). Meanwhile, it can be estimated that the VOC improvement (ΔVOC) of PSCs after AAI and AABr treatment is 0.030 V and 0.028 V, which is attributed to the suppressed nonradiative recombination at the surface by AAI/AABr passivation. This calculated result is well consistent with the average VOC of pristine and AAX passivated devices which was around 1.13 V and 1.16 V from J–V curves.

Inset: EL image of the AAI PSC as an LED displaying a clearly visible red emission under ambient light. (e) The device S–Q limit FF is composed of non-radiative loss (dark area) and charge transport loss (orange area). The spherical and solid points stand for the measured FF and FFmax without charge transport loss, respectively. (f) Normalized PCE changes of the unencapsulated PSCs with pristine, AAI and AABr treated perovskite film stored at 25 °C in an argon-filled glovebox. 
The charge transfer loss can be estimated from FF reduction, which is deduced from the S–Q limit and measured FF from J–V curves. FF reduction consists of non-radiative loss and charge transfer loss, and the maximum FF (FFmax) without charge transport loss can be empirically calculated with empirical eqn (3)40,41 (3)where n is the cell ideality factor associated with the single exponential model. As illustrated in Fig. 5e and Table S6 in the ESI† we can find that the PSCs with AAI or AABr treated perovskite films show decreased charge transfer loss of 6.3% and 7.0%, respectively, while the PSCs with the pristine film show a little higher charge transfer loss of 7.4%. The improved charge transfer in the perovskite films with AAI and AABr treatment benefits the suppression of defects of the perovskite films, thus reducing the charge transport loss. This result proves that AAI and AABr not only mitigate the defects on the surface of the perovskite film, but also improve charge transport at the interface between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD HTL.
Finally, we evaluated the long-term stability of the PSCs without encapsulation in an argon-filled glovebox and air atmosphere with relative humility (RH) around 50%. As shown in Fig. 5f, we measured the degradation of PCE with 5 independent devices under each individual condition. The PSCs with AAI/AABr treated perovskite maintained 95% of their initial PCE values after being stored for 120 days at 25 °C in an argon-filled glovebox, while the pristine PSCs only maintained around 80% of their initial PCE values. The enhanced long-term stability is mainly ascribed to the reduction of defects by the passivation of AA+. As shown in Fig. S10a ESI,† with the consideration of water and oxygen molecules in the test atmosphere, the PSCs with AAI and AABr all maintained over 80% of their initial efficiency after 240 h which are much higher than the 73% of the pristine devices. We further evaluated the thermal stability on an 85 °C hot-plate in an argon-filled glovebox. As shown in Fig S10b ESI,† we find that the efficiency has dropped rapidly due to the spiro-OMeTAD HTL with dopants, but the devices passivated with AAI or AABr were still more stable than pristine devices. The promising thermal stability is probably attributed to the passivated excess PbI2 which can create charge recombination sites and lead to performance loss.42 The reduced surface defects by AAI/AABr post-treatment can facilitate charge transfer and suppress non-radiative recombination, leading to enhanced performance. Besides, the degradation of the perovskite film also originates from the defects in the perovskite film. For instance, oxygen, and water vapors also penetrate into the perovskite film through the vacancy defect. Thus, perovskite films with fewer defects would be more stable to resist moisture, reduce ion motion and thus enhance the stability of PSCs.43 We found that the stability was also highly related to the defect density as aforementioned. AAX can passivate the perovskite film through different ways as aforementioned, and thus is effective to improve the performance and stability.
Conclusions
We passivated polycrystalline perovskite films with AAI and AABr and identified the energy loss for the perovskite thin films. The perovskite film treated with AAI/AABr with a lower trap state density suppressed nonradiative recombination, which was confirmed by PL and Mott–Shockey measurements. In LED mode, the maximum EQEEL values are 4.06% and 3.45% for AAI and AABr passivated PSCs, respectively, higher than 0.94% for the pristine device. EQEEL values of 1.26%, 1.20% and 0.40% under an injection current of photocurrent for AAI, AABr and pristine films suggest the nonradiative VOC loss of 112 mV, 114 mV and 142 mV, respectively. The FF losses are 6.3%, 7.0% and 7.4% for AAI, AABr and pristine devices, respectively. These results verified that AAI and AABr not only suppress non-radiative recombination by passivating the perovskite surface, but also reduced the charge transfer loss in the device. As a result, the PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 22.0% with AAI treatment and 21.5% with AABr treatment, which are higher than 20.4% for the pristine PSCs.
