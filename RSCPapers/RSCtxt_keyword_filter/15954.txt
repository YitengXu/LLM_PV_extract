    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 6th December 2018AbstractMolybdenum selenide (MoSe2) nanosheets are prepared by a simple and facile sonochemical route. To optimize the synthesis process, the sonication is tested at three different time durations (15, 30 and 45 min) with a constant power of 500 W. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of the exfoliated MoSe2 nanosheets, we report the hybridization of 2D-MoSe2 with 2D-graphene by a simple solvothermal method. The exfoliated MoSe2 nanosheets are perpendicularly oriented on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. These MoSe2 nanosheet edges have a large number of electrochemically active sites, and the graphene sheets provide effective mass transportation of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Cyclic voltammetry reveals the pseudocapacitive behaviour of a MoSe2/graphene nanohybrid based electrode. From galvanostatic charge–discharge studies, the specific capacitance is found to be 945 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated, which delivers a specific capacitance of 75 F g−1 (@1 A g−1) with an energy density of 26.6 W h kg−1 and a power density of 0.8 kW kg−1, and it retains 88% of its capacitance even after 3000 cycles.
1. Introduction
Supercapacitors are the most promising sustainable electrical energy storage devices, offering long cycle life, high power density and fast charging/discharging times.1–3 Two conventional electrode materials have so far been used in supercapacitors but they have drawbacks: (1) carbon-based electrode materials, such as graphene or activated carbon from biological sources, suffer from low specific capacitance when used as non-faradic electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs),4–6 and (2) metal oxide and conducting polymer based electrode materials such as MnO2, Co3O4, NiO, NiCo2O4, polyaniline, polythiophene etc., have high cost and are unstable over long cycles when used as faradic/redox type pseudocapacitors.7–13 Consequently, a newer electrode material with superior physicochemical properties is a stimulating and high priority task for researchers.
Inorganic graphene analogues, i.e. layered two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have attracted great interest because of their excellent physical and chemical properties along with their unique 2D sheet-like structures.14–17 Layered TMDCs denoted as A–M–A sandwich structures (where A is a chalcogen [S, Se or Te] and M is any transition metal ion [group IV, V and VI]), such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, MoTe2etc., exhibit a wide range of applications in many fields such as hydrogen evolution, electrochemical energy storage, catalysis, bio-imaging, electronic devices and so on.18–22 Recently, researchers have focussed more on developing selenide rather than sulphide based electrode materials due to its lower electronegativity; this provides greater numbers of electroactive sites for the redox reaction. These properties indicate the potential for more research on selenide based electrode materials.
Among various layered TMDCs, molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) is chosen because of its strong chemical bonds between Se and Mo within layers and its multi-layered structure held together with weak van der Waals forces, along with its superior properties like large interplanar distance, small band gap, low structure resistance etc. The properties of MoSe2 are mainly dependent on the layer thickness of MoSe2. Therefore, monolayers or small numbers of layers of MoSe2 have been used in a wide range of applications such as sensors, catalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), hydrogen evolution, electronics, Li-ion and Na-ion batteries and so on.23–30 To develop MoSe2 nanosheets (NS), different methods have been reported such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy and micromechanical exfoliation,31–34 but the yield is very low. In the present work, we use sonochemical synthesis for the preparation of layered MoSe2 NS at room temperature with short reaction times to produce high quality and high yield NS. The advantage of sonochemical synthesis is the generation of acoustic cavitation in a solvent medium using ultrasound irradiation.35 This external driving force is used to exfoliate the precursor. Lei et al. reported the synthesis of ultra-thin MoSe2 NS through a simple modified liquid exfoliation process and used these for the hydrogen evolution reaction.36 However, only very few attempts have been made to obtain a few layers of MoSe2 NS. Moreover, the MoSe2 suffers from reduced electrochemical activity due to its limited electrical conductivity and slow rate of charge transfer which lead to significant loss of specific capacitance and continuous capacitance fading during prolonged cycling. To overcome these problems, MoSe2 hybrids with graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNT) or conductive carbon have been constructed, to improve the electrochemical performance and enhance the specific capacitance, rate capability and cyclic stability of the material. Balasingam et al. reported an MoSe2/reduced graphene oxide based electrode using H2SO4 as an electrolyte for supercapacitor application and achieved the specific capacitance of 211 F g−1.37 Ma et al. investigated the electrochemical performance of a MoSe2/C hybrid using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte.38 However, there is no report available on the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device performance of a MoSe2/graphene (G) nanohybrid.
Hence, we report a facile and an effective approach via a sonochemical method for the preparation of a few layers of MoSe2 NS using H2O2 as an intercalating agent (oxidant) in isopropyl alcohol (solvent). Further, the prepared MoSe2 NS is hybridized with graphene via a one-pot solvothermal process. The physical characterization of the exfoliated MoSe2 NS and the MoSe2/G nanohybrid are studied through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The electrochemical properties of the MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid in 6 M KOH are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves and ac-impedance studies. Finally, an ASC device is fabricated and its electrochemical cell performances are studied in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of layered MoSe2 nanosheets
A simple and facile sonochemical assisted exfoliation method was used to exfoliate the bulk MoSe2 powder into MoSe2 NS. In this method, 1 g of bulk MoSe2 was dispersed in 100 mL of IPA with 2.5 vol% of H2O2. This resultant mixture was probe sonicated (SONIC VCX 500) by using a constant power of 500 W for various reaction times (15, 30 and 45 min) in ice-cold conditions, and due to the high shear force, the exfoliation of MoSe2 from its bulk powder was achieved. Once the reaction time ended, the dark grey colloidal suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm. The unreacted H2O2 was removed by decanting the supernatant to avoid the over-oxidation of MoSe2. The precipitate was collected and again dispersed in 100 mL of IPA and then the sonication was continued for 15 min and the supernatant was removed. The suspension of MoSe2 NS was collected and vacuum dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain a solid sample.
2.2 Preparation of the 2D–2D MoSe2/G nanohybrid
A 2D–2D MoSe2/G nanohybrid was prepared by a facile solvothermal method. A 1:0.5 weight ratio of exfoliated MoSe2 NS and GO was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water by ultrasonication for 45 min to separate the stacked precursors. Under the stirring conditions, 15 ml of DMF was added dropwise to the above solution. After 15 min, the solution was transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Finally, the obtained product was washed several times with deionized water and dried in a vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h to obtain the 2D–2D MoSe2/G nanohybrid. If the mass ratio of GO to MoSe2 was fixed as 1, the electrical double layer capacitive (EDLC) behaviour of graphene was more dominant than the pseudocapacitive behaviour of MoSe2. Hence, the mass ratio of GO to MoSe2 was fixed as 0.5:1.0.39,40 The physical characterization, electrochemical measurement and fabrication of the ASC device is described in the ESI Section.†
3 Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the sonochemical process for the exfoliation of bulk MoSe2 powder to a few layers of MoSe2 NS is presented in Fig. 1. The bulk MoSe2 powder is mixed with IPA (solvent) containing H2O2 for the sonochemical-assisted solvent exfoliation. During this process, 2.5 vol% of H2O2 in IPA solvent could weaken the van der Waals forces and break the Mo–Se bonds to exfoliate the bulk into thin nanosheets.36 The formation of the thin MoSe2 structure is mainly due to the etching and oxidation effect of H2O2. If the concentration of H2O2 is increased, the rate of exfoliation is greater and tailored to ultra-thin nanosheets, but it provides a poor yield due to the greater dissolution of MoSe2.

The yield can be calculated using the formula;  
By using the above formula, the % yield of MoSe2 NS was calculated under different sonication time periods of 15, 30 and 45 min as 63%, 52%, and 16%, respectively. At 30 min of sonication time, the yield is 52%, which is lower than that obtained with 15 min of sonication time. At 45 min, MoSe2 has been sonicated for longer, but the very poor yield of 16% is given, due to an over oxidation of MoSe2 into MoO2 during the prolonged sonication with H2O2.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the MoSe2 NS obtained at various sonication times and MoSe2/G nanohybrid. All the XRD patterns show a clear hexagonal phase (2H-MoSe2) with a space group of P63/mmc. The several characteristic peaks at 13.70, 31.44, 37.83, 47.45 and 55.90 are assigned to the (002), (100), (103), (105) and (110) planes, respectively, with no other impurity peaks indicate the formation of the phase pure hexagonal phase (JCPDS 29-0914).41,42 The intensity of the (002) peak is low and is broadened after 30 min of sonication time when compared with 15 min sonication time, which indicates the highly exfoliated nature of MoSe2. At 45 min of sonication time a very low intensity of the (002) peak is observed confirming the high exfoliation of the MoSe2 layers and very low yield. Similarly, the MoSe2/G nanohybrid shows a low intensity (002) peak indicating that there is no stacking of layers during the solvothermal reaction, but the presence of graphene is not observed in the XRD pattern.25

The exfoliated MoSe2 NS can be characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of MoSe2 NS at various sonication times are shown in Fig. 3(a). The intensities and positions of the Raman peaks confirm the nature of the MoSe2 NS. The two main Raman peaks are located at 237–242 cm−1 (out-of-plane) and 285–292 cm−1 (in-plane), for MoSe2 NS, which correspond to the A1g and E2g modes, respectively.32 After the reaction times of about 30 and 40 min, the A1g peak position is shifted to a lower wavenumber (red shift) which confirms that the MoSe2 NS are a few layers thick. Similarly, in the case of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, the A1g peak is observed at 238 cm−1 is also shifted to lower wavenumber. Further the bands observed at 1325 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 confirm the D and G bands of graphene (Fig. 3(b)). In the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, the ID/IG ratio is found to be 1.24. During the solvothermal reduction the graphene oxide is converted into reduced graphene by the removal of various functional groups, which leads to a higher degree of defects (i.e. breaking of sp2 bonds in GO).21

AFM imaging is carried out to determine the number of layers in the exfoliated MoSe2 NS (30 min) as shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4(a), a particular area is selected (marked with a yellow box) and then the depth line profile analysis is performed. The depth profile of exfoliated MoSe2 NS is shown in Fig. 4(b). The selected area AFM image of the MoSe2 NS is given in the inset of Fig. 4(b). A line profile is drawn for the selected area of the AFM image. The theoretical value of a MoSe2 monolayer is ∼0.9 nm.32 The height difference value is found to be 7.54 nm for exfoliated MoSe2 NS. This indicates that the exfoliated MoSe2 NS consist of ∼7 layers.

FE-SEM photographs of MoSe2 NS and the MoSe2/G nanohybrid are shown in Fig. 5(a–d). All of the photographs exhibit sheet-like structures. Fig. 5(a) depicts the exfoliated MoSe2 NS after 15 min of sonication; the etching by H2O2 mainly cuts the basal edges and does not exfoliate the NS into thin sheet-like structures. Fig. 5(b) indicates the formation of MoSe2 NS after 30 min of sonication time; here MoSe2 NS of a few layers thick are observed and the yield is 52%. After 45 min of sonication time (Fig. 5(c)), a very thin MoSe2 NS are formed, but the yield is very poor (16%). This may be due to the over oxidation of MoSe2 into MoO243 in the presence of H2O2 in the reaction mixture which dissolves MoSe2 and promote the spontaneous exothermic nature of the reaction [eqn (1)]. Thus, for achieving a few layers of MoSe2 NS, the required time duration for sonication is found to be 30 min at <25 °C. MoSe2 + 9H2O2 → MoO22+ + 2SeO42− + 2H+ + 8H2O(1)

In Fig. 5(d), the ultrathin curled MoSe2 NS are perpendicularly oriented onto graphene nanosheets.44 The unique wrinkled nanostructured MoSe2/G hybrid has large numbers of electrochemically active edges that can facilitate the maximum utilization of electrolyte ions, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties. Fig. S1a and b† show the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) of MoSe2 NS (30 min) and the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, respectively. The EDX reveals the presence of Mo, Se and C species in the MoSe2/G nanohybrid and of Mo and Se species in the MoSe2 NS. The BET surface areas of the exfoliated MoSe2 and 2D–2D MoSe2/G nanohybrid are obtained using the N2 adsorption–desorption method and the BET surface area plots of relative pressure (p/p0) vs. 1/[Q(p0/p − 1)] (Fig. S2†). The surface areas are found to be 68 m2 g−1 for the exfoliated MoSe2 and 133 m2 g−1 for the nanohybrid.

Fig. 6(a–c) shows the TEM images of the exfoliated MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid. Fig. 6(a) depicts the exfoliated nanosheets of MoSe2 after 30 min of sonication time. It is observed that very few layers of MoSe2 sheets are stacked with each other. Fig. 6(b) shows the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, in which a very thin curled shape of MoSe2 NS are oriented on the graphene nanosheets. The presence of diffused halo rings at the centre of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid (Fig. 6(c)) indicates the polycrystalline nature of the material. The rings, indexed to the (1 0 0), (1 0 3) and (1 0 5) planes, correspond to MoSe2 and are in good agreement with the XRD results.

To evaluate the electrochemical behaviour of electrodes of MoSe2 NS and the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and ac-impedance studies are performed in a three-electrode system using aqueous 6 M KOH solution. Fig. S3† shows CV curves of bulk MoSe2 and exfoliated MoSe2 after various sonication times. The exfoliated MoSe2 after 30 and 45 min sonication exhibits better current densities than that sonicated for 15 min or the bulk MoSe2 powder; this indicates better specific capacitance. Fig. 7(a) shows the CV curves of electrodes of bare graphene, MoSe2 NS (30 min) and the MoSe2/G nanohybrid, at a constant scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode exhibits a higher peak current density than the MoSe2 NS and graphene electrodes, which ensures that the amount of charge storage is more and the specific capacitance is high. Fig. S4† shows CV curves of the MoSe2 NS in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.4 vs. SCE at various scan rates. The CV curves exhibit a non-rectangular shape which indicates the pseudocapacitive nature of the NS, and shows that the charge storage mechanism of MoSe2 is mainly due to faradic redox reactions. The curve consists of strong redox peaks at ∼0.26 V (oxidation) and ∼0.16 V (reduction), which demonstrates the reversible redox reaction between different valence states of Mo (i.e. conversion of Mo4+ to Mo3+ and vice versa).45 The possible redox reaction mechanisms as well as surface adsorption–desorption of K+ ions are described in the following equations:46,47 MoSe2 + K+ + e− ↔ K − MoSe2;(2) (MoSe2)surface + K+ + e− ↔ (MoSe2 − K+)surface(3)

(c) Cathodic peak current density as a function of scan rates for the estimation of the b-values of MoSe2 NS and the MoSe2–G nanohybrid. (d) Diffusion and surface capacitance of MoSe2–G and MoSe2. 
At all scan rates, the CV curves have a symmetric shape on the positive sweeps and their negative counterparts, which is attributed to quick reversible redox reactions due to OH− ions in the electrolytic system; this leads to the enhanced capacitive performance of the MoSe2 NS electrode. Moreover, the MoSe2 NS has a hexagonal phase structure with an interlayer d-spacing of 0.649 nm for (002), which provides a diffusion path allowing K+ (diameter 0.276 nm) and OH− (diameter of 0.22) ions to intercalate. The CV curves of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.4 vs. SCE at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 7(b). A non-ideal rectangular shape is observed for the CV curves at all scan rates, indicating that the charge storage mechanism involves both faradic redox reactions and non-faradic absorption/desorption reactions. The vertically oriented MoSe2 NS are capable of redox reactions with the electrolyte ions, which favours the pseudocapacitive behaviour. Meanwhile, graphene can facilitate absorption/desorption of OH− ions, which favours the EDLC behaviour that leads to a synergistic effect between MoSe2 and graphene.37 Moreover, the shape of the CV curves is well maintained at higher and lower scan rates indicating good reversibility due to excellent electron conduction between the two electrode components and also facile mass transportation of electrolyte ions.
The electrochemical mechanisms at the MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrodes are obtained from the power law as a function of scan rate, as shown in the equation ip = aνb, where ip is the peak current density (A g−1), ν is the scan rate (mV s−1), and a and b are the adjustable parameters.48 The slope of the straight line represents the b-value; if the b value is 0.5 that indicates a diffusion-controlled reaction. On the other hand, if the b-value is 1 that indicates a surface-controlled reaction. From Fig. 7(c), the b-values obtained from the slopes of the straight lines are found to be 0.76 and 0.64 for the MoSe2/G and MoSe2 electrodes, respectively. The b-values as a function of potential for the cathodic sweeps are shown in Fig. S5.† Both of these two electrodes exhibit both the diffusion-controlled and a surface-controlled reactions. By using the scan rate dependent analysis, the contributions of diffusion and surface capacitance of the MoSe2 and MoSe2/G electrodes are determined by Dunn's method, using the following eqn (4) and (5):49 i(V) = k1ν + k2ν1/2(4) i(V)/ν1/2 = k1/ν1/2 + k2(5)where k1 & k2 denote the contributions of surface and diffusion capacitance and their values are determined from the slope and y-axis intercept from eqn (5). The contribution of diffusion-controlled charge storage and surface-controlled charge storage can be quantified from Fig. 7(d). This reveals that both the MoSe2/G and MoSe2 electrodes are characterized by more surface capacitance than diffusion capacitance.

Fig. 8(a) shows GCD curves of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid at various current densities measured in the potential range of −0.2 to +0.4 V vs. SCE. A non-ideal linear time variation with potential is observed for all of the GCD curves, which can be attributed to the pseudocapacitive nature arising from MoSe2 and the EDLC behaviour from the graphene sheets; this is consistent with the CV curves. The observed symmetrical charge and discharge curves indicate excellent electrochemical reversibility.50 At lower current density, no potential drop is observed, whereas at higher current density, a minimal potential drop is observed, due to the low equivalent series resistance of MoSe2/G. Fig. S6† shows GCD curves of MoSe2 NS at various current densities in the potential range of −0.2 to +0.4 V vs. SCE. A non-ideal triangular shaped GCD curve is observed at all current densities, which is attributed to the pseudocapacitive nature of MoSe2 NS. The GCD curves have symmetrical charge and discharge curves, which demonstrate a good electrochemical reversibility.40 The specific capacitance of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode is calculated at current densities of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1 and is found to be 945, 890, 833, 805 and 733 F g−1, respectively. Similarly, the specific capacitance for the MoSe2 NS electrode is found to be 576, 525, 472, 431 and 403 F g−1 at the various current densities (Fig. 8(b)). The rate capability under the high current density of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode is 77.5% of its initial specific capacitance value, whereas the MoSe2 NS electrode retains only 69% of its initial specific capacitance. At lower current density, the electrolyte ions have sufficient time to diffuse/migrate inside the active electrode material and hence the specific capacitance is high, whereas, at higher current density, the electrolyte ions do not have enough time to diffuse/migrate inside the active electrode materials and hence the specific capacitance is low. The MoSe2 NS electrode comprising only a few layers, as prepared via the sonochemical process, exhibits good specific capacitance with poor rate capability when compared with the MoSe2 NS prepared by other techniques, whereas the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode exhibits high specific capacitance with better rate capability than the other reported electrodes based on MoSe2 and its composites (Table 1). These results reflect the unique perpendicular orientation of MoSe2 on the graphene nanosheets that facilitates the penetration and migration of electrolyte, shortens the diffusion path of ions between the electrode–electrolyte interface and also reduces the contact resistance. These features enhance the redox kinetics and afford maximum utilization of the electroactive area, so providing a high structural stability during charge–discharge processes.51

Fig. 9(a) shows the electrochemical impedance curves for the MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrodes in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at open circuit voltage with an ac perturbation of 5 mV. The inset in Fig. 9(a) shows an equivalent circuit, consisting of Rs, Rct, CF and ZW which are the solution resistance, charge-transfer resistance, faradic pseudocapacitance, and Warburg impedance, respectively.57 From the Nyquist plots, an equivalent series resistance (ESR) and Rct are calculated and are found to be 0.6 Ω and 1.5 Ω, respectively, for MoSe2 NS. Similarly, for the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode, ESR and Rct are found to be 0.25 Ω and 0.85 Ω, respectively. The presence of graphene in the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode offers a high specific surface for diffusion/migration of OH− ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which reduces the internal resistance. Both the MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrodes exhibit a knee frequency, i.e. a transition zone between the high-frequency semicircle and low-frequency straight line.58 In the high-frequency region, the semicircle can be attributed to the electrical charge transfer process and suggests lower internal resistance, while in the low-frequency region, the straight line represents the diffusion of the electrolyte ions inside the electrode material (mass transfer process). The cycle stability of the MoSe2 NS and MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrodes are assessed by GCD cycling at a constant current density of 5 A g−1 for 3000 cycles; results are shown in Fig. 9(b). The specific capacitance is maintained at nearly 100% for up to 1000 cycles for both the electrodes. The MoSe2 NS electrode exhibits a gradual decrease in specific capacitance after 1000 cycles and retains 84% of its capacitance at 3000 cycles. An XRD analysis of the MoSe2 electrode, carried out before and after the cycling test, is shown in Fig. S7.† The MoSe2 electrode is fully dipped in the KOH electrolyte in the three electrode system and hence during the electrochemical reaction, MoSe2 forms an oxide layer. The XRD pattern after the cycling test shows the appearance of some peaks at 34.8° and 53.5° after 3000 charge–discharge cycles which correspond to (111) and (211) planes indicating the formation of an MoO3 phase during the cycling process. Moreover, a gradual decrease in the specific capacitance is observed giving 84% after 3000 cycles, which is due to the formation of a MoO3 film that leads to poor electronic conductivity. In the case of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode an excellent capacitance retention of 92% of its original capacitance is observed even after 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. Overall for 3000 cycles, we observe only a minimal 8% decay in capacitance which demonstrates the excellent electrochemical stability of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid electrode. This is due to the thin nanosheet-like morphology of MoSe2 and graphene which provide good strain relaxation for electrolyte species.

The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated and electrochemical studies are carried out. To find out the working potential window, CV measurements for the MoSe2/G and activated carbon electrodes at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a three electrode system are carried out (Fig. 10(a)). The CV and GCD curves of activated carbon in the potential range of −1.2 to 0.0 V (vs. SCE) are shown in Fig. S8.† The CV curves of the MoSe2/G and activated carbon electrodes are in the ranges −0.2 to +0.4 (vs. SCE) and −1.2 to 0.0 V (vs. SCE), respectively. From a mass balance equation, the optimum mass ratio of MoSe2/G to activated carbon is found to be 0.52. The CV curve of the MoSe2/G‖ activated carbon (MoSe2/G‖AC) ASC device at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 is performed under different working potentials from 1.0 V to 1.7 V (Fig. S9†). Its non-ideal rectangular shape is maintained up to 1.6 V. However, at 1.7 V, a sharp peak is observed due to the polarization effect, i.e. the evolution of hydrogen which leads to the water splitting reaction that deteriorates the electrodes of ASC devices. Hence, the optimum working potential window is fixed at 0–1.6 V for the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device. Fig. 10(b) shows the CV curve of MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device in the optimum working potential window of 0–1.6 V at various scan rates (5 to 100 mV s−1). The non-ideal rectangular shape of the CV curve indicates that the charge storage mechanism depends on the faradic reaction of MoSe2 (i.e. the pseudocapacitive behaviour) as well as the non-faradic reaction of graphene (i.e. the EDLC behaviour). No obvious distortion is observed for the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device indicating a good reversibility.

(c) GCD curves of the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device at various current densities. (d) Ragone plot for the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device (inset: photograph of ASC device). 
The GCD curves of the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device at various current densities in the optimum working potential window of 0–1.6 V are shown in Fig. 10(c). The non-triangular shaped GCD curves are observed at all current densities showing both the pseudocapacitive and EDLC behaviours. No IR drop is observed in the GCD curves of the ASC device and also symmetrical charge and discharge curves are noticed, indicating the good reversibility of the device.59 From the GDC curves, the specific capacitance for the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device is calculated and is found to be 75, 71, 67 and 50 F g−1 at the current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Thus, the fabricated ASC device shows good rate capability with 66% capacitance retention at the high current density of 10 Ag−1. The energy and power densities of the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device are calculated and found to be 26.6 W h kg−1 and 0.8 kW kg−1, respectively (Fig. 10(d)). The MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device possesses a high energy density for the power density compared with previously reported ASC devices including Ni0.85Se@MoSe2‖GNS (25.5 W h kg−1 at 0.42 kW kg−1),54 NiS/rGO‖NC (17 W h kg−1 at 10 kW kg−1),60 Co0.85Se‖NPCMs (21 W h kg−1 at 0.4 kW kg−1),61 CNT/Ni3S2‖AC (19.8 W h kg−1 at 0.78 kW kg−1),62 CoS/Ni3S2‖AC (14.4 W h kg−1 at 0.26 kW kg−1)63 and CoNi2S4–G–MoSe2‖CoNi2S4–G–MoSe2 (23.7 W h kg−1 at 13.3 kW kg−1).64

Fig. 11(a) shows the long-term stability of the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device over 3000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g−1 in the working potential of 1.6 V. The ASC device maintains a good cycle stability with capacitance retention of 87% even after 3000 cycles, and 99% coulombic efficiency. This is attributed to an excellent reversible redox reaction between the electrode and electrolyte that provides better electrochemical stability. Electrochemical ac-impedance studies are carried out for the fabricated MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device before and after the cycling test (Fig. 11(b)). Both before and after cycling of the ASC device, a well-defined semicircle and a vertical line are observed at high and low frequencies, respectively.65 The typical capacitive behaviour is observed due to the presence of the line at low frequency for the MoSe2/G‖AC device. In the fabricated ASC device before the cycling test, the bulk and charge-transfer resistances are found to be 0.8 and 1.4 Ω, respectively. After 3000 cycles, the ASC device possesses slightly higher bulk (1.0 Ω) and charge-transfer (1.9 Ω) resistances. The XRD analysis of the MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device is also carried before and after the cycling test to know the phase stability and structural integrity of the electrode materials and their results are included in the supporting information as Fig. S10.† It is observed from the XRD pattern of MoSe2/G after cycling that the peaks become more intense and there are no other impurity peaks when compared with the XRD pattern before the cycling test; this indicates that the MoSe2/G maintains its phase purity and structural integrity even after 3000 charge–discharge cycles.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, the present work reports the synthesis of MoSe2 NS that are a few layers thick, by a facile sonochemical exfoliation process. The optimum sonication time to obtain the MoSe2 NS is found to be 30 min. Further, a MoSe2/G nanohybrid is obtained by a simple solvothermal method. The pseudocapacitive nature of the MoSe2 NS, and both the pseudocapacitive and EDLC behaviours of the MoSe2/G nanohybrid are explored by cyclic voltammetry studies. The perpendicular arrangement of the few layers of MoSe2 on graphene gives a specific capacitance of 945 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Finally, a MoSe2/G‖AC ASC device is fabricated and obtains a high energy density of 26.6 W h kg−1 (@0.8 kW kg−1) with good long-term stability. This reveals that the MoSe2/G nanohybrid could be used as a promising positive electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitor applications.
