    , Accepted 23rd July 2016First published on 25th July 2016AbstractWe present a new transformation route from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3 for the facile preparation of perovskites with all kinds of shapes via vapor-assisted chemical bath deposition (VACBD). As such, curved and large-area CH3NH3PbI3 films with high quality are successfully achieved, which are suitable for the manufacturing scale-up of perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been comprehensively studied in the last few years due to their excellent performance and low cost.1–3 Recently, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 21% was reported, which is comparable to the highest efficiencies of commercial Si, CuInGaSe2, and CdTe photovoltaic (PV) devices.4 Basically, the preparation method of high-quality and large-scale CH3NH3PbI3 films is the key technology for realizing the industrialization of PSCs.5,6 However, current methods for fabricating perovskite films, such as thermal evaporation, atomic layer deposition, one- and two-step processes, and a doctor-blade coating approach, are not ideal routes for industrial manufacturing scale-up.1,3,7–10 The above vacuum-based technologies need complicated processing and high equipment investment while the solution methods always accompany a poor reproducibility owing to the over-rapid liquid reaction nature.8,9 Lately, ultrasonic spray and slot-die coating have been developed to prepare large-area perovskites, but the films still exhibit rough, porous, and incomplete-covered morphologies.11,12 Thus, it is challenging to develop a cost-efficient technology for the large-scale preparation of PSCs.
Two years ago, the vapor-assisted solution process (VASP) was invented by Yang for the fabrication of perovskites.13 After that, more convenient chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was introduced into PSCs by our group and other researchers.14–18 This work demonstrates that the vapor-assisted process could readily present smooth, pinhole-free, and fully-covered perovskite films due to its moderate gas–solid (G–S) reaction feature that reduces the over-rapid intercalating reaction rate.13,14 Although these simple, low cost, and easily scalable vapor-assisted CVD methods have been proved to be a fruitful way for achieving high-quality perovskites, there is still a bottleneck problem hampering their extensive applications. The PbI2 and/or PbCl2 layers used as precursor films in the above-mentioned solution or CVD methods are usually prepared via spin-coating, which is difficult to apply in the mass production of PSCs on account of its uniformity problem and the reproducibility issue.13–18 Meanwhile, the quality of the coated PbI2 films is not satisfactory and a number of inherent ditch defects exist.15 Due to the over-fast dissolution and the crystallization process, large amounts of colloid suspensions and needle-shaped intermediates are formed in PbI2 solution, which would eventually damage the quality of the final CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers,16,19,20 while the use of PbCl2 as a precursor is limited by its low solubility in polar solvent.21 Therefore, the conventional spin-coating process must be substituted by an alternative way for the manufacturing scale-up of PSCs; meanwhile, a new Pb-based system should also be explored to replace the undesired PbI2 precursor. Recently, Zhao et al. reported a new precursor HPbI3 to replace PbI2, which enables the formation of highly uniform perovskite films.22 To the best of our knowledge, no other new precursor system has been reported so far.
Among numerous techniques, chemical bath deposition (CBD) has been proven to be a low-cost, low-temperature, and highly efficient method for fabricating various semiconductor films with high quality on a large scale, which is successfully applied to deposit CdS buffer layers in the mass production of CuInGaSe2 thin-film solar cells.23 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the industrial pilot-scale CBD equipment (deposition area: 900 cm2); even large panels with a size of 1 m2 can be deposited by CBD facility. Besides, the CBD process has a unique characteristic that films can be deposited on any shape, including flat and non-flat multiple substrates. This could considerably broaden the application range of PSCs, e.g., the irregular curved surfaces of rigid glass or flexible plastics. Note that, whether the PbS precursor deposited by CBD can be smoothly transformed into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, however, is the most important matter. To verify this novel transformation route, herein, a hybrid VACBD method taking advantage of CBD and CVD processes is developed to fabricate perovskites. Scheme 1 shows the novel transformation process from PbS into CH3NH3PbI3. The crystal structural data refer to the related reports.24,25 Full details of the experimental section and characterization are provided in the ESI.† For comparison, the two-step solution approach based on the PbS precursor is also employed to try to form perovskites. We find that the simple CBD process could readily generate high-quality PbS precursor films without any pinhole and ditch defect, totally different from the conventional PbI2 layers. As a consequence, PbS completely transforms into CH3NH3PbI3 films in the subsequent CVD process, exhibiting smooth, compact, and uniform morphologies with full surface coverage. Using this technique, the working PSCs with a preliminary PCE of 4.68% and the curved, large-area perovskite films with a size of 4 cm × 3 cm are successfully achieved here, which manifests a high potential to be applied in future manufacturing scale-up of PSCs. In contrast, PbS films fabricated by CBD cannot react with 2-propanol-based CH3NH3I solution in the solution method.
 Scheme 1  The novel transformation route from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3. 
Basically, the lead chalcogenides, especially the nearly perfect single crystal galena PbS minerals, have been profusely studied due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which are usually used as infrared detectors and lasers.26,27 Here we employ a simple CBD method to deposit PbS as the precursor of perovskites used in the PV field. As we can see from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PbS shown in Fig. 1(a), deducting the peaks of TiO2/FTO, PbS films give characteristic diffraction peaks at 26.02°, 30.12°, 43.12°, and 51.02°, which are separately assigned to (111), (200), (210) and (311) planes consistent with the face centered cubic structure of galena PbS, in good agreement with the standard JCPD (05-0592) data. From the photographs of PbS films shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. S2 (ESI†), it can be observed that shining black layers are separately deposited on TiO2/FTO glass and the beaker. Hence, the CBD method could easily produce the desired PbS precursor on the substrate with all kinds of shapes. Therefore, we speculate that the CBD reaction process of depositing PbS films might be as follows: NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(1) Pb2+ + 4NH3 → Pb(NH3)42+(2) SC(NH2)2 + OH− → CH2NH2 + H2O + HS−(3) HS− + OH− → S2− + H2O(4) Pb(NH3)42+ + S2− → PbS↓ + 4NH3↑(5)
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns, (b) photographs, (c) Raman spectra, and (d) UV-Vis absorption spectra of PbS films and CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers fabricated by VACBD. 
From reaction (2) we can see that the Pb2+ ion exists as the complex form of Pb(NH3)42+ that controls its releasing rate. At the same time, thiourea slowly releases S2− under the action of OH− as shown in eqn (3) and (4). Thus the deposition rate of PbS could be well controlled by the concentrations of reactants and the pH value of the solution system, which supplies a good platform for depositing high-quality films.
After the subsequent CVD process, new peaks appear at 14.06°, 28.15°, 31.80° and 43.08°, assigned to the (110), (220), (310), and (330) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites,13–18 as also shown in Fig. 1(a), which means that PbS precursor films successfully transform into dark brown CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers (in Fig. 1(b)) under CH3NH3I vapor. The vapor-assisted CVD process should proceed as follows: PbS + 3CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3 + 2CH3NH2↑ + H2S↑(6) As such, this new transformation route in situ generates CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites as well as the gaseous CH3NH2 and H2S. As far as we know, it is the first time that this special reaction process of the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 from the PbS precursor has been reported. To characterize the structure of the above films in depth, their Raman spectra are provided in Fig. 1(c). After reaction, we can observe that strong peaks of Pb–S bonds at 137 cm−1 move to 143 cm−1 assigned to the bending and stretching of Pb–I bonds,28 with a shift of 6 cm−1 wave length; while the other characteristic peaks of PbS at 200 cm−1 and 437 cm−1 completely disappear,29 indicating an entire transformation from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3. Fig. 1(d) compares absorption spectra of PbS films and CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers fabricated by the VACBD method. Owing to the narrow band gap (Eg) nature of the PbS material,26,30 its absorption spectrum extends to the infrared wave range. When it totally transforms into perovskites, the spectrum exhibits a strong absorption in the visible light range, extending up to ∼800 nm. Inversely, when PbS films fabricated by the CBD method are dipped into the 2-propanol-based CH3NH3I solution, they cannot react with each other at room temperature, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). We therefore could not obtain CH3NH3PbI3 from CBD-based PbS via the two-step solution process.
For further study of the transformation process from PbS films to CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was employed in this work. Fig. 2(a) shows the overall Pb4f, S2p, and I3d XPS spectra of PbS and CH3NH3PbI3 layers, respectively. As can be seen, the signals of Pb4f, C1s, N1s, Pb4d, O1s, and Pb4p are all detected for both of the films. Fig. 2(b) shows a Pb4f core level at a binding energy of 137.47 eV for the PbS films and 138.36 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers. Strikingly, the peak position of Pb4f shifts almost 1 eV to the higher binding energy side after the transformation. According to the recent reports, it should move to the lower binding energy side about 0.3–0.4 eV when PbI2 transforms to CH3NH3PbI3.15,31 The quite different chemical environments between Pb–S and Pb–I should be the main reason for this variation of the peak position of Pb4f. Based on Fig. 2(c) and (d), we can observe that the S2p (160.70 and 161.90 eV) peaks, according to the report of Hernan,32 have disappeared while the I3d (619.28 eV) peak appears when PbS films transform into CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers. So we cannot detect the signals of S2p in the final perovskites, which again illustrates that PbS films transform into CH3NH3PbI3 completely.

As we all know, the film quality of CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers is the key factor for achieving high-efficient PSCs.5,6,9,13 Thus the morphologies of PbS films and CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers are both investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 3. From the top surface image of PbS films in Fig. 3(a) and (c), it is observed that the extremely compact, uniform, and nonporous grains with a rectangular shape are deposited by the CBD method, exhibiting a well-crystallized structure. Conversely, the PbI2 films fabricated by the traditional spin-coating approach always present a loose, non-uniform, and porous morphology with irregular canals and ditches, which should have been caused by the over-fast volatilization of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent during spin-coating and hot treatment processes.15 After the CVD process, the CH3NH3PbI3 layers possess dense, homogeneous, and full surface coverage characteristics as seen from Fig. 3(b) and (d). The PbS grains with a uniform size of ∼100 nm grow to above 300 nm through CH3NH3I treatment. The low-magnification SEM images (Fig. S4(a) and (b), ESI†) and the 2D AFM height images (Fig. S5(a) and (b), ESI†) of PbS films and CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers are also provided, which all exhibit smooth, dense, and uniform morphologies. In consideration of volume expansion occurring in the CVD process, the cross-sectional SEM of PbS and CH3NH3PbI3 are compared in Fig. S6(a) and (b) (ESI†). As expected, the thickness of PbS films tremendously increases 2 times from ∼250 nm to ∼500 nm. Finally, the composition of CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers is examined by SEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). It reveals that the I/Pb ratio is close to the stoichiometry of 3:1, a little I-poor, likely caused by the decomposition of perovskites to PbI2. More importantly, we could not find the peak of the S element in the final perovskites, which once again proves the complete transformation from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3. As a consequence, the VACBD method readily solves the problems rooted in the PbI2 precursor and presents high-quality perovskite films.

To investigate the PV applicability, the PSCs shown in Fig. 4(a) are successfully fabricated based on the as-prepared perovskite films. The statistical result is also shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The highest efficiency of 4.68% is obtained and its J–V curve is also shown in Fig. 4(b). The low Voc and FF should be improved after optimizing the experimental parameters. Anyway, we have made an attempt to fabricate PV devices and achieved preliminary success. To further prove the feasibility of preparing the curved and large-area perovskite films using our VACBD method, the following experiment is conducted as follows: firstly, the curved glass substrate with a size of 4 cm × 3 cm is cleaned. Secondly, to improve surface roughness of the glass substrate, it is coated with C–TiO2.14,15 Finally, the CH3NH3PbI3 layers are obtained by the VACBD method. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the photographs of curved and large-area perovskite films (4 × 3 cm2), and XRD patterns and SEM images measured at 4 different points are provided in Fig. S8–S10 (ESI†). It is clear that CH3NH3PbI3 absorbers fabricated by VACBD demonstrate a smooth and compact appearance in a large area, exhibiting a high uniformity of crystallization. Thus our novel method is suitable for future manufacturing scale-up of PSCs. Meanwhile, this is the first report on the fabrication of perovskites on a curved rigid glass substrate. Moreover, both of CBD and CVD are conducted below 150 °C, which means that our method could be transferred to the low-temperature flexible PVs.

In summary, a novel transformation route from PbS to CH3NH3PbI3 for the fabrication of perovskites is reported in this work. Further research shows that galena PbS films, introduced as the new Pb-based precursor system via a simple and easily controlled CBD process, demonstrate extremely compact, uniform, and nonporous grains with a rectangular shape, which effectively resolves the problem of inherent ditch defects in traditional spin-coated PbI2 layers. After the subsequent CVD process, the PbS precursor completely transforms into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites that possess the desired dense, homogeneous, and full surface coverage characteristics. As such, the working PSCs with a preliminary efficiency of 4.68% are achieved here. More strikingly, curved and large-area CH3NH3PbI3 films with a size of 4 cm × 3 cm are successfully achieved using our facile VACBD method, which shows the advantage of manufacturing scale-up of PSCs on a substrate of any shape and also could be applied in the field of low-temperature flexible PVs.
