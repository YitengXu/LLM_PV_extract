1. Introduction

Oxide semiconductor nanostructures have been widely investigated during the past decades for different technical applications in photodetectors, field emission, chemical sensors, light-emitting devices and solar cells.1–5 Among these nanostructures, nanowires and nanotubes have attracted increasing interest due to their well-defined crystal shapes, larger surface area and tunable optoelectrical properties. ZnO is a typical n-type metal oxide semiconductor with a wide band gap (3.37 eV) and high electron mobility (∼120 cm2 V−1 s−1). So, it is a very promising oxide semiconductor that could be used as window materials in different solar cells.6,7Cu2O is also a well-known oxide semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.1 eV and a natural p-type conductivity, which is an attractive material for device applications because of its abundant availability, nontoxicity, and low production cost.8 It has a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region and the minority carrier diffusion length is also suitable for use as a solar cell absorber layer.9 But, due to the doping asymmetry problem,10,11 it is still not possible to fabricate Cu2O or ZnO solar cells with p–n homojunctions like the commercial silicon cells.
An alternative way is to fabricate heterostructure solar cells as the Cu2O/ZnO junction has a favorable alignment of the conduction band edges,12 which has recently attracted the renewed interest of several researchers. Minami et al.13–15 reported the solar cell consisting of a ZnO thin film deposited with pulsed laser deposition on a Cu2O sheet prepared by oxidizing copper at a high temperature and investigated the influence of different vapor phase growth methods and conditions on the film cell performance. Hsueh et al.16 grew ZnO nanowires with chemical vapor deposition on magnetron sputtered ZnO:Ga/glass templates and then Cu2O film was subsequently deposited on top of the ZnO nanowires. So, a Cu2O/ZnO film/nanowire cell was formed with a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.1%. Besides the high cost, another serious concern of the high-temperature growth is the occurrence of metallic copper or copper-rich regions at the Cu2O/ZnO interface,17 which will destroy the p–n junction. In comparison with various vapor phase deposition techniques, electrochemical deposition (ECD) is a versatile and low-cost method for preparing semiconductor thin films and nanostructures on conductive substrates, which has the following features: low processing temperature, precise morphology control, low instrumentation cost, and good electrical contact between samples and substrates. The preliminary study on electrodeposition of ZnO onto Cu2O was as early as in 2000 by Lee et al.18 without any discussion on the formation of the heterostructure. In 2004, Katayama et al.19 prepared Cu2O/ZnO film heterostructure and measured a PCE of 0.117% under a simulated solar light of 120 mW cm−2. Chou et al.20 reported the heterostructure of aluminium-doped ZnO film sputtered onto Cu2O films with different orientations grown with ECD. Jeong et al.21 studied the influence of electrodeposition conditions like pH and temperature on the cell performance. But, in both these two cases, the PCE was still low at about 0.1%. At present, the efficiency of conversion of Cu2O/ZnO heterostructure solar cells is much lower than the theoretical limit which is about 18%.22
Recently, research on ZnO as an alternative photoelectrode has been intensively performed, especially for the ZnO-based dye sensitized solar cells and Schottky cells.23,24 One of the key parameters for the high efficiency of Cu2O/ZnO solar cells is the heterojunction area. It is expected that the larger the surface area the higher the efficiency. In 2010, Cui et al.25 and Musselman et al.26 fabricated Cu2O/ZnO film/nanopillar heterojunctions both by electrodeposition methods and the efficiency of such nanopillar solar cells was improved to above 0.5%. In this paper, three kinds of heterostructure solar cells constructed with Cu2O films and ZnO film, nanowire or nanotube respectively were fabricated with a simple and low-cost ECD method together with ordinary chemical etching. By comparing their photovoltaic properties, it was demonstrated that increasing the heterojunction area and shortening the carrier diffusion distance by using ZnO nanostructures can effectively enhance the solar cell performance.
2. Experimental details
2.1 
          Growth of ZnO film/nanowires/nanotubes
All the used chemicals were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company Limited (Shanghai, China) and the FTO-glass substrate was bought from Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG) Group (Tokyo, Japan). Galvanostatic cathodic deposition of a ZnO film and nanorod array was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell. Some commercial conductive glass (NSG TEC™ C15) slides coated with a layer of 350 nm fluorine-doped tin oxide coated-glass (FTO-glass) were used as the cathodes (∼1 cm2). The square resistance is about 14 Ω sq−1. Zinc sheets (99.99% purity) acted as the anode and the electrolyte was zinc nitrate aqueous solution of 0.5 M or 0.05 M. The applied current density was 0.35 mA cm−2. The deposition temperature was fixed at 70 °C by a water bath and the deposition time was 60 min for all samples.
The formation of ZnO nanotubes was realized by a selective dissolution of the metastable polar (001)-face of the ZnO nanorods.27 After the electrodeposition of the ZnO nanorod array, the sample was then immersed in an alkaline solution of 0.125 M KOH at 80 °C for 2 h and then a ZnO nanotube array was subsequently obtained. Such an aging mechanism required precise control of the dissolution time to convert ZnO from rods to tubes.
2.2 
          Growth of Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures and device fabrications
After the growth of ZnO samples, ECD was further adopted to grow Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures. The obtained films and nanowires/nanotubes on FTO-glass substrates were used as cathodes again and the ECD of the Cu2O film was similar to that of the ZnO film described above. An aqueous solution containing copper sulfate (0.4 M) and lactic acid (5 M) was used as the electrolyte with a pH value of 12 adjusted by dropping NaOH solution. The current was 0.35 mA cm−2 and the deposition time was between 30 and 150 min. After the growth of different Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures, a cool sputter coater (SCD 005, Bal-Tec) with designed plastic masks was applied to deposit gold contacts on the Cu2O films and FTO-glasses as contacts. The final device structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.3 Materials and device characterizations
Morphological and composition studies of ZnO, Cu2O nanostructures and their heterostructures were performed with an FEI Quanta scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) (D8-Advance, Bruker) was used to examine the crystal structure of the samples. UV–visible absorption spectra were performed on a Cary 5E spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with an Edinburgh FL920 spectrometer at room temperature. Photovoltaic measurements were recorded employing a 3A solar simulator (XES-40S1, San-Ei) with an AM 1.5 spectrum distribution. The power of the light was calibrated against a standard ISE CalLab Fraunhofer silicon solar cell to accurately simulate full-sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The solar cells were fixed on a temperature-controlled sample test stage (0821, Vision-Tec) to keep the devices at a temperature of 25 °C and were illuminated from the glass substrate side and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated p-Cu2O/n-ZnO heterostructure devices were measured with a Keithley 2612A source/meter.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the surface SEM images of the ZnO and Cu2O samples grown under different electrochemical conditions. The ZnO was electrodeposited with different zinc nitrate concentrations but at the same current density of 0.35 mA cm−2. In this case, it was found the sample morphologies were mainly dependent on the concentration of electrolyte solution. When the zinc nitrate concentration was as high as 0.5 M, dense film was deposited on the glass substrate, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Quasi-aligned nanorod arrays were grown on FTO-glasses substrate when the electrolyte concentration was decreased to 0.05 M, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Such an ECD electrolyte concentration-dependent morphology evolution is similar to a new report.28 However, the Cu2O film electrodeposited with 0.4 M copper sulfate solution at 60 °C does not show a clear change with current density increasing from 0.1 mA cm−2 to 0.7 mA cm−2, as typically shown in Fig. 2(b). Such compact film deposited with a current density of 0.35 mA cm−2 was comprised of Cu2O grains of truncated octahedral structures with sizes less than 2.5 μm.

The phases of the obtained ZnO and Cu2O samples were checked with XRD measurements, as shown in Fig. 3. Besides the diffraction peak with asterisks from the FTO conductive thin layer on glass, all other diffraction peaks can be ascribed to wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451) or cubic Cu2O (JCPDS 78-2076) and prove their pure phases. As the XRD spectra of Fig. 3 were detected with a powder diffractometer, therefore, only the reflections from the crystallographic planes parallel to the substrate can be collected. So, the relative intensities of different reflection peaks provide information regarding the crystal orientation against the substrate. The rather strong ZnO (002) peak indicated that the ZnO film/nanowires were of clear c-axis orientation. Both the diffraction peaks of (111), (200) and (220), from basic planes of cubic Cu2O with equivalent intensity were observed, which meant the dense films were composed of Cu2O grains with random orientation, which is better for the space filling between the ZnO nanowires or nanotubes and formation of Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures, accordingly.

As an amphoteric oxide, ZnO can react with both acidic and alkaline ions and the products are soluble salts. Thus, the electrodeposited ZnO nanorods can be transformed into nanotubes after a chemical etching process with solutions containing H+ or OH− ions. Fig. 4 shows the morphologies of the as-deposited ZnO nanorods and the corresponding nanotubes after etching with 0.125 M KOH at 80 °C for 2 h. The ZnO nanotubes were formed by selective etching of the ZnO nanorods in the (001) planes along the c-axis with OH− ions. The preferable etching along the c-axis is due to the high surface energy of the metastable {001} plane.29 By controlling the etching conditions properly, entire hollow nanotubes can be obtained, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b).

The crystal quality of the ECD grown ZnO and Cu2O were further checked with room-temperature PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 5. The typical near-band-gap (NBG) emissions at 380 nm were both observed from ZnO film and nanowire. Also, weak and broad visible emission centered at around 560 nm which is a typical defect-related emission for ZnO was also detected. The optical properties, evident in strong UV excitonic NBG emissions and relatively weaker defect-related emissions, prove the ZnO nanorods are of better crystal quality than that of the ZnO film. For the Cu2O film, a clear broad band edge emission from 450 nm to 650 nm was observed, which was composed of a series of Wanier hydrogen-like excitonic transitions from Γ1+ to the new sublevels and some defects-related emissions.30,31

Fig. 6(a) and (b) compare the cross-section SEM images of Cu2O/ZnO heterostructures. Both the ZnO and Cu2O films were of dense polycrystalline structures and form a clear heterointerface, as indicated in Fig. 6(a). From Fig. 6(b), we can see clearly that the void spaces among the nanorods were filled by the second ECD process for Cu2O and then a layer composed of aggregates of columnar Cu2O grains grew in a direction normal to the nanorods top surface. The corresponding EDX spectrum measured from area 1 as indicated in Fig. 6(c) shows both copper and zinc signals while the EDX spectrum measured from the upper area 2 (Fig. 6d) only shows copper signals. This further proved that the Cu2O not only wrapped over the top of ZnO nanorods, but also filled into internal spaces among the ZnO nanorod array. The heterointerface between the ZnO and the Cu2O layers could be clearly observed for all p-Cu2O/n-ZnO heterojunctions deposited with ECD. The formation of the Cu2O/ZnO heterojunction was further identified with absorption spectrum. The absorption spectra of FTO glass, ZnO film and Cu2O film are shown in Fig. 7. The absorption spectrum of the Cu2O/ZnO bilayer exhibits two absorption edges at 380 nm and 600 nm, which correspond to the band gap absorption of ZnO and Cu2O films, respectively. So the electrodeposited Cu2O/ZnO heterojunction has an absorption range from visible to ultraviolet, which agrees with solar irradiation well.

Transmission line patterns with a diameter of 2 mm were fabricated by DC sputtering with a mask. The fabricated contacts are shown in the inset of Fig. 8(a). Dark current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of these contacts were measured using a Keithley 2612A source/meter and Ecopia probe station. The as-deposited contacts onto ZnO and Cu2O films were both found to be linear, as shown by the I–V curves in Fig. 8 indicating the establishment of Ohmic conduction for contacts. The total resistance, which includes contact resistance, was calculated to be about 10 KΩ from the slopes of the I–V curves. Fig. 8(b) shows I–V characteristics of the ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction. The rectifying behavior indicates that a p–n junction is formed in our heterostructure. The sharp turn on occurred at ∼1.5 V. With −4 V applied bias, it was found that the forward current density was 1 μA cm−2, while the current density was 30 μA cm−2 when +4 V was applied.

The photovoltaic current density–voltage (I–V) curves for the different Cu2O/ZnO heterojunctions under an AM 1.5 solar simulator are shown in Fig. 9 and the corresponding calculated characteristic parameters of the measured solar cells are summarized in Table 1. The Cu2O/ZnO film heterojunctions (Cell A) prepared by depositing a Cu2O layer onto a ZnO film exhibited a rather low photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.02% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.19 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.42 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.26. The typical solar cell performance was improved when the ZnO nanorod array was used instead of the dense ZnO film to form a Cu2O/ZnO film/nanorod heterojunction (Cell B) with Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of 0.24 V, 1.96 mA cm−2, 0.27 and 0.13%, respectively. Both the Jsc, and PCE were substantially improved. While, when ZnO nanotubes were used to form a Cu2O/ZnO film/nanotube heterojunction (Cell C), both the Voc, FF and PCE showed a small decrease in comparison with Cell B although the PCE was still much higher than that of Cell A. But the Jsc of Cell C still increased clearly and was the maximum among these three cells. As can be seen clearly from Table 1, the photovoltaic performance of solar cell B was enhanced remarkably in comparison with the planar film Cell A. The increase in short-circuit density and conversion efficiency was due to the Cu2O film wrapped onto the ZnO nanorods, which increased the p–n heterojunction area as observed in Fig. 6. Moreover, the ZnO nanowire has a better charge carrier collection ability than film due to the high single-crystal quality of the ZnO nanorods, which also improved the cell performance.

The increase in the heterojunction area using ZnO nanotubes for Cell C led to the maximum short-circuit photocurrent density, which further proved that increasing the p–n junction area is an effective way to obtain higher short-circuit photocurrent density. But, both the Voc and FF of Cell C decreased appreciably in comparison with Cell B with a net result of PCE decrease. The Voc and FF decrease of Cell C was mostly likely due to the formation of pinholes through the etched ZnO nanotube and short circuits between the glass-substrate and the ZnO electron conductor layer when the pinholes were filled by Cu2O during the electrodeposition. Another possible reason was the lower electric conductivity of the etched ZnO nanotube compared to that of the ZnO nanorod.
In addition, although the obtained conversion efficiency of Cu2O/ZnO-based solar cells was still lower than the former reported data,24,25,32 obvious improvements were achieved by modifying the device structures like increasing the heterojunction area. Further PCE enhancement is expected by optimizing the ECD conditions for depositing the Cu2O and ZnO layers to reduce the cuprous oxide resistivity and enhance the transparency of the ZnO layer. Moreover, the three kinds of Cu2O/ZnO solar cells were totally fabricated with a simple, low-cost ECD method using non-toxic materials and has potential for large-scale production.
4. Conclusions
In summary, three kinds of heterostructures composed of n-type ZnO film or nanowires or nanotubes covered with a p-type Cu2O thin film respectively were fabricated with a simple and low-cost ECD method. Structural, optical, and electrical studies identified the formation of the proposed Cu2O/ZnO p–n heterojunctions. In comparison with planar Cu2O/ZnO film solar cells, the introduction of nanowire arrays increased the heterojunction areas that led to 6.5 times efficiency improvement and 4.5 times short-circuit current improvement. Another reason was that the nanowires had better charge carrier collection ability than film was due to the high single-crystal quality. As a result, the Cu2O/ZnO film/nanotube solar cell had a maximum short-circuit current density under the same conditions among these three kinds of cells. But, the open-circuit voltage and conversion efficiency decreased a little as the formation of ZnO nanotubes through etching caused short circuits between the Cu2O layer and the conductive glass substrate. This study demonstrates that the proposed strategy to improve solar cell performance realized by electrochemical deposition and chemical etching has potential in producing cheap and environment friendly solar cells. The next work should focus on optimizing the ECD and etching conditions to improve the interface quality, increase the oxide layer conductivity/transparency and fabricate solar cells on a large area.
