We systematically investigated the synthesis, thermal stability, optical and electrochemical properties, field-effect carrier mobilities, and photovoltaic characteristics of these polymers. The field-effect mobilities of P1 and P2 were determined to be 5.8 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Among the naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-based copolymers studied here, P2 showed the best photovoltaic performance, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.52 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.51, and a power conversion efficiency of 4.88% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have recently attracted scientific and technological interest. Polymeric semiconductors present unique advantages for use in PSCs over their inorganic counterparts due to their low cost of production, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability.1–8 To date, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reported for polymer–fullerene derivative bulk heterojunction PSCs have reached values of 7–8% primarily due to the development of new low-band gap polymers and good control over the nanoscale morphologies of interpenetrating electron donor–acceptor networks.9,10
The parameters that decisively determine PSC efficiency are the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). These parameters and therefore the performances of PSCs may be optimized by designing polymers with high absorption coefficients over a broad spectral range that overlaps significantly with the solar spectrum. Optimal polymers should also display a high hole mobility and good miscibility in polymer blends, thereby forming nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating networks.11–13 The development of high-performance polymer solar cells relies on refocusing of research efforts toward the design of efficient photoactive π-conjugated polymeric electron donors.
Linear fused polycyclic aromatic compounds, including benzodithiophenes,9,10 naphthodithiophenes, and anthradithiophenes,14 have been examined recently in this field. The naphthodithiophene derivatives have been used as small molecules15–18 or polymers19–22 in organic semiconductor applications. Their planar structures promote a high degree of order among the polymer chains, which improves the hole mobility. However linear fused planar conjugated polymers suffer from poor solubility. Takimiya et al. reported the preparation of NDT-based donor–acceptor polymers that incorporated a second alkyl-substituted bithiophene unit into the polymer chain in an effort to improve the solubility of the highly rigid planar backbone.19 We recently reported the naphtho[2,3-b;6,7-d′]dithiophene (NDT)-based copolymers with thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole units as electron acceptors that exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 4.0% and a hole mobility of 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.20 In that study, we introduced bulky side chains into the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole units to improve the solubility of the copolymer, thereby facilitating polymer characterization and photovoltaic device fabrication. A new polymer backbone was needed, however, to overcome the problems with the solubility and hole mobility.
In this study, we report the use of “zigzag” naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (zNDT)-based copolymers, poly[4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,6-{(1-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one}] (P1) and poly[4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,6-{(1-(3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophen)-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one}] (P2), in bulk heterojunction solar cells. The thieno[3,4-b]thiophene derivatives without and with fluorine units were used as electron-deficient comonomers in the donor–acceptor system. We investigated the fluorine effect on the field-effect transistor and photovoltaic characteristics. We also synthesized a linear naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-d′]dithiophene-based copolymer via polycondensation of 2,7-bis(trimethyltin)-4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-d′]dithiophene and the corresponding dibrominated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene derivatives for reference purposes. It was difficult to analyze the field-effect carrier mobilities and photovoltaic properties of the linear naphthodithiophene-based copolymers due to their poor solubility. We systematically investigated the optical and electrochemical properties, field-effect carrier mobilities, and photovoltaic characteristics of the resulting polymers. The bulk heterojunction PSCs prepared from P2 produced a PCE of 4.88% under AM 1.5 irradiation in ambient air.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The synthetic routes to preparing the zNDT-based polymers P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme 1. The naphthodithiophene-based polymers were synthesized by the polycondensation of 2,7-bis(trimethyltin)-4,9-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and the corresponding dibrominated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene derivatives via a palladium-catalyzed Stille reaction. The crude polymers were extracted with chloroform, collected by precipitation in methanol, and extracted with methanol and acetone, successively, using Soxhlet apparatus to remove the byproducts. The chemical structures of the polymers were verified by 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the synthesized polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against polystyrene standards in a chloroform eluent and were found to be in the range of 10–18 kDa with a polydispersity index of 1.7–2.3 (Table 1).

The thermal properties of the copolymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 1). All polymers exhibited good thermal stability, showing a weight loss of less than 5% at temperatures up to 360 °C. The physical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 1.
 Fig. 1  TGA traces for the copolymers. 
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2. All polymers exhibited two main absorption peaks at 410–440 nm, which could be assigned to localized π–π* transitions, and at 630–680 nm in the long wavelength region. The nature of these bands, observed for the low-band gap polymer with push–pull units, still remains to be elucidated. Jespersen et al. attributed the highest energy band to a π–π* transition whereas the lowest energy band was assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor.23,24 The absorption spectra of the polymer films are shown in Fig. 3, and the optical properties are summarized in detail in Table 2. The absorption spectra of the polymer films were red-shifted by 10–40 nm relative to the maxima for the polymers in solution due to the high coplanarity and/or enhanced intermolecular electronic interactions in the solid state. The absorption maxima of the fluorinated polymer, P2, were blue-shifted by 10 nm relative to the maxima of the unfluorinated polymer, P1. As reported previously, the introduction of additional electron-withdrawing fluorine groups to the polymer backbone blue-shifted the polymer absorption maxima.25 The optical band gaps obtained by extrapolating the absorption edges of the film were 1.60 and 1.69 eV for P1 and P2, respectively.

The energy levels of the polymers were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were calculated to be −4.86 and −5.03 eV, respectively (Fig. 4), using a ferrocene reference value of −4.8 eV below the vacuum level.26 As reported previously,25 the introduction of fluorine groups to the polymer backbone reduced the HOMO level, thereby increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in a PSC upon introduction of the fluorine unit because the Voc was closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor, PC71BM.27,28 The LUMO levels of P1 and P2 were calculated to be −3.26 and −3.34 eV, estimated based on the optical band gaps and HOMO energy levels (Table 2).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
The intramolecular charge transfer between the D–A–D charge transfer states, geometry, and the electron state density was investigated by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the DMol 3 software. Fig. 5 depicts the HOMO and LUMO electron state density distributions for the geometry-optimized structures of the model compound. The results predicted that the HOMO was delocalized over the polymer backbone, whereas the LUMO was fairly well-localized at the electron acceptor site. This configuration is generally observed for low-band gap polymers with push–pull units.29,30

Field-effect transistor characteristics
The field-effect carrier mobilities of the polymers were investigated by fabricating thin film transistors (TFTs) with a top contact geometry using Au electrodes. The device fabrication process is described in detail in the Experimental section. Photocurrent loss in PSCs can be mitigated by increasing the charge carrier mobility to achieve high-performance PSC devices. Fig. 6 shows plots of the source–drain current (Ids) as a function of source–drain voltage (Vds) at different gate voltages from 0 to −60 V, and typical output and transfer curves for the polymers. The TFTs of the polymers exhibited typical p-channel TFT characteristics with good drain-current modulation and well-defined linear and saturation regions. The TFT mobilities were calculated in the saturation region using the following equation:31Ids = (WCi/2L)μ(VG − VT)2,where Ids is the drain–source current in the saturated region, W and L are the channel width (3000 μm) and length (50 μm), respectively, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer (SiO2, 200 nm), and VG and VT are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively.

The field-effect mobilities of P1 and P2 were determined to be 5.8 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As reported previously, the hole mobility of the fluorinated polymer, P2, was higher than that of the unfluorinated polymer due to the higher intermolecular packing among the fluorinated backbones.32,33 The hole mobility of P2 was within the desired range for PSC materials (comparable to or exceeding 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), allowing for efficient charge extraction and a good FF.
Photovoltaic characteristics
Bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al structure. The device fabrication process is described in detail in the Experimental section. The PSC performance was strongly affected by the processing parameters, such as the choice of solvent, blend ratio of the polymer and PC71BM, and the additive effects.34,35 We investigated the performances of several PSC materials under a variety of conditions (see ESI†). Optimal fabrication conditions were obtained dissolving the polymer (7 mg mL−1) in 97% chlorobenzene (CB)/3% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) solution at a 1000 rpm spin-coating rate and a polymer:PC71BM ratio of 1:2 (w/w). The thicknesses of the layers were PEDOT:PSS (60 nm), active layer (80 nm), and Ca–Al (120 nm).

Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage curves of the optimized devices based on blends of the zNDT-based polymer and fullerene. The output characteristics of the resulting polymer-based devices are summarized in Table 3. The performance of a solar cell fabricated using naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-d′]dithiophene-based polymers was previously found to be improved using a 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) active layer.20 The solar cells were tested either with or without the 3% DIO additive. As a result, P2 containing 3% DIO displayed an improved short-circuit current performance, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 4.88% (see ESI†). Compared to the unfluorinated polymer, P1, incorporation of fluorine improved the Voc, Jsc, and FF. As expected from the HOMO energy levels of the polymers, the trend in Voc for the zNDT-based polymers agreed with the electrochemical potentials. The Jsc of a PSC was affected by a variety of factors, including the absorption strength of the active layer and the charge carrier mobility.36,37 The values of Jsc measured for P1 and P2 were 11.99 and 13.52 mA cm−2, respectively. As expected from the hole mobilities of the polymers (5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2), the fluorinated polymer, P2, exhibited a higher Jsc than the unfluorinated polymer.

Fig. 8 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized PSC devices prepared with 3% DIO under monochromatic light illumination. The EQE spectra agreed well with the optical absorption curves, resulting in a close correlation with the photocurrents (see ESI†). The convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux of the AM 1.5G spectrum provided an estimate for the value of JSC under irradiation. The calculated JSC values of the P1 and P2-based devices were 12.17 and 12.78 mA cm−2, respectively.

Morphology plays a significant role in PSC efficiency. Fig. 9 shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (1 μm × 1 μm scan area) of a blend film (polymer:PC71BM = 1:2 in 97% CB/3% DIO solvent), in an effort to better understand the device characteristics. The surface topography (left) and phase images (right) were collected for each film and yielded an insight into the device characteristics. The surface roughness values measured from the topography images were 2.055 and 0.551 nm for P1 (Fig. 9a) and P2 (Fig. 9c), respectively. The zNDT-based P2 film was smoother and more uniform. As observed in the phase images (Fig. 9b and d), the unfluorinated P1 and fluorinated P2 displayed very different morphologies. Compared to the morphology of the blended film prepared using P1, large-scale phase separation was not observed in the blend film prepared from P2. The P2:PC71BM blend system developed a more uniform distribution of domains and a smoother active layer surface, which enhanced the Jsc and FF.

A low Voc due to the high-lying HOMO energy levels of the zNDT-based copolymers ultimately reduced the overall PCE. The PSC performance could potentially be significantly improved by enhancing the Voc. Additional modifications to the polymer structure are currently under examination toward further improving the PSC performance.
Conclusions
In summary, two naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-based copolymers were synthesized via a Stille coupling polymerization. Under the optimized synthetic conditions, bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated from blends containing P2 and PC71BM exhibited PCEs of 4.88%, with a Jsc of 13.52 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.71 V, and a FF of 0.51. The high field-effect carrier mobility and good photovoltaic properties of P2 suggest that zNDT-based copolymers are promising candidates as next-generation solar cell materials. As reported previously, fluorine effects were observed in the zNDT-based copolymers. The fluorinated polymer P2 exhibited a high field-effect carrier mobility and good photovoltaic properties relative to the unfluorinated polymer P1. A preliminary experimental study of the photovoltaic performances of the zNDT-based polymers was performed, and further modifications to the polymer structure or the device structure are being tested in an effort to achieve even better performances.
Experimental section
General
The synthesized compounds were characterized with 1H NMR spectra obtained using a Bruker DPX-300 NMR spectrometer. UV-visible analysis was performed using a Lambda 20 (Perkin Elmer) diode array spectrophotometer. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Viscotek) equipped with a TDA 302 detector and a PL-gel (Varian) column, using chloroform as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Dupont 9900 analyzer.
Fabrication of the organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)
OTFT devices were fabricated in the bottom gate, top contact configuration (channel length = 50 μm, width = 3000 μm) on heavily doped n-type Si substrates as the gate and thermally grown SiO2 (200 nm) as the dielectric layer. The semiconducting polymer layer was spin-cast from the solution at 2000 rpm. All solutions were prepared at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. Prior to the deposition of D–A conjugated copolymers, the SiO2 surface was modified with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8) to make the surface hydrophobic. After polymer deposition, the films were dried on a hot plate stabilized at 80 °C for 30 minutes. All polymer deposition processes were carried out in a controlled atmosphere glove box filled with N2. Source and drain electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The thickness of the source and drain electrodes was 50 nm. Electrical characterization was performed under a N2 atmosphere using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200).
Fabrication of the polymer solar cells (PSCs)
In this study, the devices were fabricated with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al structure. The procedure for cleaning the ITO surface included sonication and rinsing in deionized water, methanol, and acetone. The hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto each ITO anode from a solution purchased from Heraeus (Clevios™ P). Each polymer:PC71BM solution was then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc. The polymer solution for spin-coating was prepared by dissolving the polymer (7 mg mL−1) in 97% CB/3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Calcium and aluminum contacts were formed by vacuum deposition at pressures below 3 × 10−6 Torr, providing an active area of 0.09 cm2. Solar cell efficiencies were characterized under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation from a Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 global filter. Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer, and the illumination intensity was set using an NREL-certified silicon diode with an integrated KG1 optical filter. The EQE was measured by underfilling the device area using a reflective microscope objective to focus the light output from a 100 W halogen lamp outfitted with a monochromator and an optical chopper; the photocurrent was measured using a lock-in amplifier, and the absolute photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
Materials
Dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, K2CO3, bis(2,2-diethoxyethyl)disulfide, n-buLi, trimethyltinchloride, and toluene (99.8%, anhydrous) were purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification. The monomers 2,7-bis(trimethyltin)-4,9-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene,18 1-(4,6-dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one,13 and 1-(4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one9 were prepared with previously described methods.
General procedure for the synthesis of polymers with the Stille reaction
The synthesis of poly[4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,6-{(1-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one}] (P1) is presented in detail as a representative example. 2,7-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,9-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (246 mg, 0.3 mmol), 1-(4,6-dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-ethylhexan-1-one (126 mg, 0.3 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (14 mg, 0.04 eq.) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask. Then, anhydrous DMF (1 mL) and anhydrous toluene (4 mL) were added. The polymerization was carried out at 105 °C under argon protection. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to about 50 °C and added slowly to a vigorously stirred mixture consisting of 230 mL methanol and 13 mL 1 N aqueous HCl. The polymer fibers were collected by filtration and reprecipitation from methanol. The polymer was purified by washing for 2 days in a Soxhlet apparatus with acetone to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. The reprecipitation procedure in toluene–methanol was then repeated several times. The final product was obtained after drying in vacuo at 40 °C. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.50–6.90 (m, 5H); 4.23 (br, 4H); 3.43 (br, 1H); 2.20–0.80 (m, 44H). Anal.
