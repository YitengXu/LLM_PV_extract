    , Accepted 17th March 2021First published on 18th March 2021AbstractIn this paper we describe three indacenodithiophene-based conjugated polymers (PITIC-Ph, PITIC-Th, and PITIC-ThF) that we tested as third components for PM6:Y6-based ternary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to provide high-power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long-term thermal stabilities. Among them, the incorporation of PITIC-Ph enhanced the charge dissociation and prohibited the bimolecular (trap-assisted) recombination of the PM6:Y6 blend. Compared with the pre-optimized OPV device, the PCEs of the PITIC-Ph-doped devices improved from 15.0 ± 0.37 to 17.0 ± 0.35% under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation. More critically, studies of the thermal stability revealed another phenomenon: embedding PITIC-Ph decreased the degree of thermally driven phase segregation of the PM6:Y6 blend film. The respective OPVs exhibited outstanding thermal stability under stress at 150 °C within a glove box, with the PCE of the PITIC-Ph-doped device remaining high (at 16.4%) after annealing for 560 h.
Introduction
Solution-processable conjugated polymers are attractive because of their low cost, light weight, flexibility, and solution-processability.1–5 The increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and enhanced stabilities displayed recently by organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have resulted in great efforts being devoted to designing new molecular structures, studying their mechanisms of operation, and optimizing the device performance.6–16 OPVs incorporating non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are particularly appealing because of their efficient absorption of light in the visible and near-infrared regions and their readily tuned energy levels.17–25 NFAs developed previously included both conjugated polymers and small molecules (SMs); the incorporation of conjugated polymers as both the electron donor and acceptor can lead to excellent morphological stability and mechanical flexibility,26,27 making them more suitable as candidates for commercial applications than corresponding SM NFA-based OPVs. Nevertheless, the PCEs of SM-NFA OPVs have typically been higher than those of all-polymer OPVs, with records set between 16 and 18.2% for single-junction devices.28–31 To date, the PCEs of all-polymer OPVs have reached only 14–15.1%.32,33 Improving the optical properties, electron mobility, and molecular packing and orientation of polymer acceptors can lead to new polymer structures for all-polymer OPVs displaying greater performance.34 For example, Li et al. prepared a conjugated polymer (PZ1) by embedding an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) building block having a structure similar to that of the popular fused-ring electron acceptor. PZ1 had a low band gap (1.55 eV) and a high absorption coefficient (1.3 × 105 cm−1), and its devices exhibited PCEs reaching as high as 9.19%.35 Yan et al. reported a polymer acceptor PFBDT-IDTIC based on this strategy, achieving a PCE for OPVs of 10.3%.36 Zhang et al. described a narrow-band-gap conjugated polymer acceptor (PN1) based on electron-withdrawing 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis[3-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)benzene]-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the core building block and thiophene as the linking unit; a device incorporating PN1 achieved a PCE of 10.5%.34 Most recently, Cao et al. reported a polymer acceptor PJ1 that had a band gap of approximately 1.4 eV; blending PJ1 with the donor polymer PBDB-T led to a device providing the record-high PCE of 14.4%.32
These developments in high-efficiency (SM or polymer) NFAs have opened up new opportunities for increasing the performance of OPVs by constructing ternary blend films.37 Whether it provides complementary absorption, optimizes the cascading energy levels, or enhances the morphology, the presence of a third component (in either two-D/one-A or two-A/one-D materials) can increase the performance of ternary OPVs relative to those of their binary counterparts.38–42 BTP-4F(Y6) and its derivatives undergo efficient light harvesting and efficient carrier transporting, leading to high OPV performance (Fig. 1a).6,43 By adopting a third NFA acceptor, to form alloy-like A moieties, it has been possible to optimize the blend morphologies and increase the PCEs of respective devices.11 By embedding PBT(E)BTz, the degrees of charge carrier recombination can be suppressed within PM6 and Y6 blends, resulting in the optimized PCE reaching 16.26%.44 Min et al. employed a polymer acceptor-doping strategy to construct a thermally stable OPV; by adding a small amount (1 wt%) of the polymer acceptor PZ1 into the PM6:BTTT-2Cl host blend, they improved the crystalline morphology of the active layer and enhanced its charge transport properties, achieving a device PCE of 15.10%.33 Although several NFA-based polymers have been studied, all previous reports have described the use of thiophene as the linker. Investigations of the effects of various other linkers have never been described previously.

We were interested in designing N-type conjugated polymers and using them in a third-component (ternary blend) strategy to obtain high-performance OPVs of high thermal stability. Suppressing the crystallinity/phase segregation of the active layer through the use of a “molecular lock” or through cross-linking of the D/A moieties can be applied to overcome thermal instability of most bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends.33,45,46 Embedding a third component in a binary blend can simultaneously optimize the carrier transport and fix the blend moieties, thereby enhancing the PCE and thermal stability of the resulting devices. In this present study, we prepared three PITIC-based polymers featuring various linkers (Scheme 1) and observed dramatic variations in their optoelectronic properties. For example, using phenylene moieties as linkers resulted in a blue-shifted absorption band for the ITIC derivative which was demonstrated for the first time. Varying the linker affected the energy levels [e.g., increasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) increased the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the resulting device] and absorption behavior (e.g., absorption more complementary to the binary blend led to higher current densities) of the PITIC-based polymers, allowing us to optimize the performance of their ternary OPVs.47 The PITIC derivatives appeared to be excellent third components for binary polymer/NFA systems, because they possess main structures similar to those of the NFA. Indeed, the incorporation of PITIC-Ph improved all of the OPV parameters (resulting in a PCE of 17.0 ± 0.35%) relative to those of the reference binary PM6:Y6 (PCE 15.0 ± 0.37%), while also enhancing the long-term stability. PITIC-Ph mixed preferentially with Y6 and provided intermolecular interactions that promoted light harvesting and minimized trap-assisted recombination in the blend film, leading to the fill factor (FF) improving significantly (by up to 74.0 ± 1.50%, from 70.5 ± 1.79%). More importantly, when subjected to thermal stress at 150 °C within a glove box, the PITIC-Ph-embedded OPVs displayed excellent long-term stability, with the PCE decreasing by less than 10% for testing periods of up to 560 h; in contrast, the control devices lost 89% of their PCE under the same conditions.

Results and discussion
We prepared non-fullerene acceptors of ITIC-based polymers (2,2′-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydrodithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6 b′]dithiophene-2,8-diyl]-bis [methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis(propanedinitrile)) with three different linker groups, which had prominent effects on the optical properties. We used Suzuki–Miyaura or Stille coupling polymerizations of Br–ITIC–Br with 1,4-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene (B–Ph–B), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (Sn–Th–Sn), and (3,4-difluorothiophene-2,5-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn–ThF–Sn) as co-monomers (Schemes S1 and S2†) to give the three ITIC-based polymers PITIC-Ph, PITIC-Th, and PITIC-ThF, respectively (Scheme 1). Detailed analytical data for these materials are provided in the ESI.† Fig. S1–S6† present the 1H NMR spectra of the three monomers and polymers. We used gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to determine the molecular weights of the resulting polymers (Fig. S7–S9†). PITIC-Ph and PITIC-Th had molecular weights of approximately ten thousand, indicating that they could, indeed, be considered as polymeric materials. In contrast, PITIC-ThF had a lower molecular weight and was considered to be an oligomer.48 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that these ITIC polymers had good thermal stability, with decomposition temperatures of greater, than 290 °C (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). The fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all three polymers featured signals for CN (ca. 2200 cm−1) and CO (around 1700 cm−1) groups, as well as the absence of any signals of C–Br stretching (741 cm−1) from Br–ITIC–Br, suggesting thorough polymerizations of the pairs of monomers.

Fig. 2a presents the normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of Br–ITIC–Br and the three polymers as dilute solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF); Table 1 summarizes the related data. The monomer Br–ITIC–Br absorbed strongly in the visible range from 550 to 750 nm, with a value of λmax of 669 nm and with a small shoulder at 620 nm. In comparison, the ITIC-based polymers with the various linker groups (phenyl, thiophene, 3,4-difluorothiophene) displayed red- or blue-shifted absorption, revealing that the optical properties of the prepared polymers could be fine-tuned by varying the linker groups. The ITIC polymer incorporating the thiophene linkers (PITIC-Th) had approximately the same absorption onset as Br–ITIC–Br but with a slightly blue-shifted value of λmax (657 nm). Notably, substituting the thiophene groups with phenyl linkers (PITIC-Ph) led to a dramatic blue-shift, with a value of λmax of 551 nm. Thus, the introduction of phenyl groups widened the band gap, potentially beneficial for inhibiting electron–hole recombination. In contrast, the spectrum of the polymer featuring the difluorothiophene linkers (PITIC-ThF) featured a small new shoulder at 739 nm, accompanied by a red-shift of the absorption onset. We extracted the optical band gaps (Eg) of the polymers from Tauc plots of (αhν)2 with respect to hν, based on the equationαhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2and extrapolation of the linear part of the curve to the energy axis. According to Fig. 2b, the polymers PITIC-Th, PITIC-ThF, and PITIC-Ph had Eg values of of 1.75, 1.70, and 2.05 eV, respectively. Fig. 2c presents the energy levels of the polymers; we used photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) from plots of yield (cps0.5) with respect to the incident photon energy (eV), as displayed in Fig. S10.† Subtracting the HOMO energies from the values of Eg gave the LUMO energies of the polymers.

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to examine the surface chemical compositions of the polymers and, thereby, investigate their surface electronic structures and bonding configurations. Fig. 3a displays the XPS survey spectra of the three polymers. Signals for C, N, S, and O elements appeared in the survey spectra of all three of the polymers; signals for F atoms were detected only from the PITIC-ThF polymer. These survey spectra were consistent with the prepared polymers having high purity, with no other elements incorporated during the preparation process. Fig. 3b–f present the high-resolution XPS spectra of the C 1s, S 2p, F 1s, N 1s, and O 1s binding energies, respectively, for the PITIC-ThF polymer. The signals in the C 1s spectrum were deconvoluted into three peaks at 283.5, 284.1 and 285.4 eV, corresponding to carbon atoms involved in sp2-hybridized bonding (sp2 C), sp3-hybridized bonding (sp3 C), and CO bonding, respectively. The signals in the S 2p spectrum were deconvoluted into two peaks at 163.1 and 164.0 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. The F 1s, N 1s, and O 1s spectra featured peaks centered at 687, 398.2, and 531.6 eV, respectively, related to C–F, CN, and CO bonding, respectively. Fig. S11† displays the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra of the elements of the polymers PITIC-Ph and PITIC-Th.

To examine the electronic states of the prepared ITIC polymers, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate their geometries and band gap energies. Fig. S12† reveals that the HOMOs of the three polymers were delocalized to some extent over the conjugated systems, whereas their LUMOs were more localized over their IC moieties. The dihedral angles between the Ph linkers and the IC moieties of PITIC-Ph (34.28°) were much greater than those between the Th linkers and the IC moieties of PITIC-Th (21.69°) and those between the ThF linkers and the IC moieties of ITIC-ThF (18.4°). The smaller dihedral angles in PITIC-ThF and PITIC-Th resulted in their polymers having more planar structures, potentially leading to higher mobilities for charge carrier transportation.
We fabricated OPV devices having the inverted structure indium tin oxide (ITO)/sol–gel ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 4a). We initially evaluated binary OPV devices incorporating the acceptors and PM6 as the donor at a blend ratio (weight ratio) of PM6:PITIC of 1:1.2 (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4a displays the UV-Vis absorption spectra of these materials. PM6 and PITIC-Ph absorbed light mainly at wavelengths below 600 nm, whereas PITIC-Th and PITIC-ThF covered the absorption spectra at wavelengths up to 800 nm. Table S1† displays the performance data of these devices. We obtained unsatisfactory performance for the devices incorporating PM6:PITIC-Ph and PM6:PITIC-Th, with PCEs of 0.315 and 1.177%, respectively (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Because of the limited solubility of PITIC-ThF, we did not fabricate its binary device. We studied the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the blends to understand the phenomena behind the OPV performance. We observed high-intensity PL for the PM6:PITIC-Ph blend film, implying large-scale phase segregation within it (Fig. S13†). Despite having a high value of VOC (>1.0 V), the large-scale segregation in the PM6:PITIC-Ph blend film and the poor alignment of the LUMO energy levels of PM6 and PITIC-Ph (i.e., their LUMO energy levels were identical, hindering efficient exciton dissociation) led to poor OPV performance. Next, we incorporated the PITIC derivatives as third components in PM6:Y6-based ternary OPVs. We expected the relatively high LUMO energy level of PITIC-Ph to increase the value of VOC of its ternary device, with the complementary absorptions of PITIC-Th and PITIC-ThF (relative to PM6 and Y6) potentially increasing the values of JSC of their devices (Fig. 4a). First, we studied the miscibility of the PITIC derivatives, PM6, and Y6 to evaluate their D/A blend status, using the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) and the equation,  where D and A represent the individual D and A moieties in the blends. The values of χ allowed us to estimate the strength of the interactions in each pair of blend components and its effect on the domain size/phase segregation of the BHJ. We determined the values of χ from the surface energies (γ) of these materials, which were determined from contact angle measurements.47 We used water and diiodomethane (DIM) as probe solvents (Fig. S14†). Table S2† summarizes the values of χ, the contact angles, and the surface energies of the individual films. The calculated surface energies of the films of PITIC-Ph, PITIC-Th, PITIC-ThF, PM6, and Y6 were 49.17, 53.60, 46.50, 41.15 and 51.49 mJ m−2, respectively. The values of χ of the PM6 blends with PITIC-Ph, PITIC-Th, and PITIC-ThF were 0.36, 0.82, and 0.16, respectively. The interaction parameters for Y6 with PITIC-Ph, PITIC-Th, and PITIC-ThF were 0.03, 0.02, and 0.13, respectively. Typically, a large value of χ implies poor miscibility, such that the blend will undergo phase segregation. A small interaction parameter suggests strong interactions and the formation of a well-mixed blend morphology. We expected that PITIC-Ph and PITIC-Th were mixed well within the Y6 domains and were phase-segregated from the PM6 domains.

The binary-blend PM6:Y6 control devices exhibited a PCE of 15.0 ± 0.37%, with a value of JSC of 25.5 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, a value of VOC of 0.84 ± 0.01 V, and an FF of 70.5 ± 1.79% (Table 2). These values are comparable with those reported previously in the literature.6 We obtained a PCE of 14.0 ± 1.54% for the PITIC-Ph ternary device (prepared at a 1:1.2:0.1 blend ratio); this performance was lower than that of the PM6:Y6 device. Decreasing the blend ratio of PITIC-Ph (from 0.1 to 0.03–0.05) (Table S3†) increased the performance of the respective ternary PM6:Y6 devices dramatically, when 0.03 and 0.04 weight ratios of PITIC-Ph were presented. Relative to the binary control devices, the PCEs of the PITIC-Ph-containing PM6:Y6 devices increased greatly to 17.0 ± 0.35% (with a champion PCE of 17.5%.), due to the FF improving significantly from 70.5 ± 1.79 to 74.0 ± 1.50% (Table 2 and Fig. 4b). The embedding of PITIC-Ph increased the values of VOC and JSC of the devices moderately, from 0.84 ± 0.01 to 0.87 ± 0.01 V and from 25.5 ± 0.29 to 26.5 ± 0.70 mA cm−2, respectively. In comparison with the control devices, the OPV devices incorporating PITIC-Th and PITIC-ThF at a weight ratio of 0.04 displayed slightly higher PCEs (15.5 ± 0.35 and 15.7 ± 0.34%, respectively). We evaluated the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices [Fig. 4b] and calculated the current densities from their EQE responses and the solar flux, to support the values of JSC determined from the solar simulator. The values of JSC obtained from the EQE responses of the control and PITIC-Ph-, PITIC-Th-, and PITIC-ThF-containing devices were 24.30, 26.02, 25.17, and 24.15 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, only small mismatches existed between the values of JSC obtained from the EQE responses and the solar simulation. We calculated the shunt (Rsh) and series (Rs) resistances of the respective devices from their J–V curves (Table 2). These devices had similar values of Rs, implying that the bulk and interfacial resistances within the devices were nearly identical. The highest value of Rsh was that of the PITIC-Ph-containing devices, indicating its lower leakage current and the lowest degrees of free carrier recombination. We used the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method to determine the hole and electron mobilities in the blend films. For the normal device, the hole and electron mobilities were 7.79 and 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; for the PITIC-Ph-derived device, they were 7.92 and 3.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The greater electron mobility for the PITIC-Ph device was presumably one reason for its superior FF.

Fig. S15† presents the UV-Vis and PL spectra of these blend films. Because the blend ratios of the PITIC derivatives were low, we observed similar absorption spectra for all of the blend films. The high degrees of PL quenching indicated highly efficient exciton dissociation within the blend films, consistent with their excellent OPV performance. Fig. S16† displays the tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographical and phase images of the control PM6:Y6 blend film and the blends incorporating the PITIC derivatives. We observed similar RMS roughnesses (1–2 nm) and smooth surfaces for all of the blend films. The nearly identical phase images (with phase domain sizes of approximately 20–30 nm) of all of the blend films suggested that the presence of the PITIC derivatives did not alter the blend film morphology significantly. To obtain further understanding of the molecular arrangement within these blends, we employed grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the packing of the polymers. Fig. S17† reveals that PM6:Y6 had a lamellar stacking structure with a peak at 2.983 nm−1 (d-spacing of 2.106 nm) in the in-plane direction. The π-stacking peak was located at 17.357 nm−1 with a d-spacing of 0.362 nm in the out-of-plane direction (Table S4†). These features indicated that the crystallites of PM6:Y6 possessed a face-on orientation.49 After blending with the various PITIC derivatives, which had intrinsically weak crystallinity, we observed similar diffraction signals with analogous lamellar spacings (ca. 2.106–2.130 nm) and π-stacking spacings (0.358–0.364 nm), indicating that the blending of the PITIC derivatives did not suppress the crystallinity of PM6:Y6.
To determine the cause of the enhanced performance of the PITIC-Ph-containing device, we measured the photocurrent density with respect to the effective voltage (Jph–Veff) to evaluate the charge dissociation/generation within the devices. Fig. 5 presents the curves (under AM 1.5 G illumination, on a double-logarithmic scale) of the PM6:Y6 devices prepared with and without the PITIC derivatives as additives. Table S5† lists the parameters of the charge generation and dissociation dynamics of the devices, calculated from the Jph–Veff curves. We observed an increase in the value of Veff up to 0.2 V, but it became saturated at high current densities. The value of Jsat is related to the incident photon flux and should be independent of the applied bias and temperature.41 The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) is dependent on the value of Jsat. The values of Jsat and Gmax of the binary control and ternary PITIC-Ph-, PITIC-Th-, and PITIC-ThF-containing devices were 28.41, 28.26, 25.88, and 26.80 mA cm−2, respectively, and 1.77, 1.76, 1.61, and 1.67 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. The control and PITIC-Ph-containing devices exhibited the highest degrees of light harvesting among these systems. The calculated charge dissociation probabilities P(E, T) of the control and PITIC-Ph-, PITIC-Th-, and PITIC-ThF-containing devices were 87.92, 95.76, 96.21, and 94.81%, respectively. The trends in the values of P(E, T) and Gmax imply that the incorporation of PITIC-Ph improved the exciton dissociation at the D–A interfaces and ensured efficient charge transport/collection in the OPV device. As a result, we observed improvements in the FF and the value of JSC and, thereby, the PITIC-Ph-containing devices outperformed the others. We measured the J–V curves of the binary and ternary devices at various light intensities to evaluate their charge recombination processes. Fig. 5b and c show the plot of the curves of VOC and JSC at the various light intensities. We calculated the values of α (an exponential factor) for the following expression:JSC ∝ Plightαwhere Plight is the light intensity.50 The values of α for the binary and PITIC-Ph-, PITIC-Th-, and PITIC-ThF-containing devices were 0.970, 0.983, 0.980, and 0.976, respectively. The value of α reflects the order of bimolecular recombination within the device. The α value closer to 1 implies a suppression of bimolecular recombination; this behavior is correlated with the PITIC-Ph-containing devices exhibiting the best performance. We calculated the values of n from the following equation to evaluate trap-assisted recombination (degree of charge carrier recombination) behavior:VOC ∝ n(KT/q)ln(Plight)where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (K), and q is the elementary charge. The fitted values of n for the binary and PITIC-Ph-, PITIC-Th-, and PITIC-ThF-containing devices were 1.52, 1.41, 1.47, and 1.51, respectively. The lower value of n for the PITIC-Ph blend suggested a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination, consistent with the highest values of FF and Rsh being those of its respective device.

The stability of an OPV device determines its commercial potential and is correlated with many phenomena, including the degrees of photo, thermal, and chemical degradation of its active materials, its degree of encapsulation, the interfacial/electrode properties of each layer; and the blend morphology.51 These properties determine the long-term stability of OPVs in a complex manner, so careful investigation should be applied to examine each effect. Because PVs operate under the sun and temperatures can increase to over 50 °C, we focused on examining the thermal stabilities of our OPVs under accelerated high thermal stress. The optimized blend morphology would be metastable; its D/A moieties could move spontaneously to a low activation energy state to achieve thermodynamic stability. Durable OPV devices can take advantage of intermolecular interactions to suppress large-scale phase segregation. To systematically evaluate the thermal stability of the active layer blend films in the presence and absence of PITIC-Ph, we thermally aged them at 150 °C for various periods of time inside a glove box (to minimize the effects of O2 and H2O). To eliminate the effects of decay of MoO3/Ag contacts under thermal stress, we fabricated devices after applying various thermal stresses to the active layer films. Fig. 6 displays the performance with respect to time for the various devices. The binary devices provided PCEs of 15.1, 15.4, 15.9, and 14.9% after annealing at 150 °C for 0, 70, 140, and 280 h, respectively, revealing the thermal stability of the PM6:Y6 blend to a certain extent; the performance decreased by over 80% (to 1.6%), however, when the binary cells were subjected to extended thermal treatment (t = 560 h). In contrast, the PITIC-Ph-containing devices exhibited PCEs of 16.8, 15.2, 15.2, 16.0, and 16.4% after annealing at 150 °C for 0, 70, 140, 280, and 560 h, respectively, revealing the enhanced thermal stability of the PM6:Y6 blend in the presence of PITIC-Ph. We used AFM and optical microscopy (OM) to monitor the blend film after annealing for 560 h (Fig. 6a). Compared with the pristine blend film, the annealed blend film developed a dramatic degree of large-scale aggregation (up to a micrometer scale, with a great increase in the RMS roughness to 24.6 nm). We suspect that the low-molecular-weight Y6 preferred to diffuse into large aggregates at elevated temperatures, as depicted in the cartoon image in Fig. 6b. We observed no significant change in the morphology of the PITIC-Ph ternary blend film, with only a slight increase in its RMS roughness to 1.31 nm. As indicated by the extremely low value of the interaction parameter χY6:PITIC-Ph (0.03), the molecular interaction between Y6 and PITIC-Ph was strong, suggesting good miscibility. The value of χPM6:PITIC-Ph (0.36) was lower than that of χPM6:Y6 (0.54), suggesting that the presence of PITIC-Ph (within the Y6 moiety) provided a certain buffering effect that prevented large-area segregation. As a result, the presence of PITIC-Ph delayed the phase aggregation of Y6 and stabilized the morphology (Fig. 6b).

Conclusion
We have synthesized three indacenodithiophene conjugated polymers for use as third components in PM6:Y6-based ternary OPVs. The absorption behavior and energy levels of the polymers could be tuned effectively by altering the nature of the linkers (phenylene, thiophene, and difluorothiophene) which was demonstrated for the first time. Among these polymers, the absorption spectra of PITIC-Ph displayed a dramatic blue-shift, with a value of λmax of 551 nm, and the highest LUMO energy level, while PITIC-ThF extended the light harvesting to 739 nm. PITIC-Ph served well as the third component for the PM6:Y6 binary blend, altering the morphology of the blend film and providing efficient exciton dissociation and lower degrees of bimolecular/trap-assisted recombination. We observed an improvement in the PCE for the PITIC-Ph-containing ternary OPV, with a value of 17.0 ± 0.35% that is among the best OPV performances ever reported. The presence of PITIC-Ph effectively suppressed the thermally driven phase separation of the binary blend under thermal stress (the ternary blend was thermally stable at 150 °C for over 560 h). As evidenced by the optoelectronic and morphological characteristics of the blend films, the use of PITIC-Ph as an acceptor had dual functions: it simultaneously increased the PCE and stability of the respective device. This study provides new insights into the potential effects of third components in ternary OPVs.
Experimental section
Experimental
All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received (unless noted otherwise). PM6 and Y6 (Solarmer) were used without further treatment. The following steps were used to fabricate OPV devices having the inverted structural configuration ITO/ZnO/active layers/MoO3/Ag. ITO glass substrates [Sanyo, Japan (6.4 Ω per square)] were patterned lithographically to determine the effective area, then washed with detergent, treated ultrasonically with acetone, water, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), dried at 140 °C for 10 min, and cleaned with oxygen plasma for 5 min. Zinc acetate (3.15 g), ethanolamine (0.9 mL), and 2-methoxyethanol (29.1 mL) were used to prepare the sol–gel ZnO precursor solution, which was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The sol–gel ZnO precursor was passed through a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter before being deposited through spin-coating (3000 rpm) in air onto the ITO substrate, and then dried at 180 °C for 20 min in air (thickness: ca. 30 nm). The binary and ternary blends of PM6:Y6:PITIC were prepared at various ratios. Each mixture was dissolved in CF (7.3 mg mL−1 for the D component), with or without 0.5% CN as an additive, and stirred overnight. The active layer solution was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s (thickness: ca. 100 nm). Finally, MoO3 (thickness: 3 nm) and the Ag electrode (thickness: 100 nm) were deposited onto the active layer under a pressure of less than 10−6 Torr. The effective area of the ternary OPV device was 0.1 cm2.
Characterization
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-650 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves (PCE and Jph–Veff curves) of the devices inside a glove box were determined using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and an Enlitech simulator (AAA Class Solar Simulators) under AM 1.5 illumination (1000 W m−2). The illumination intensity of the EQE was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell cover with a KG-5 filter, and matched using an integration system combining a monochromator (Newport 74100), a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR 830), and a chopper to measure the EQE spectra. The surface morphology of the ternary blend films was measured using a Bruker dimension edge atomic force microscope, operated in tapping mode at room temperature. GIWAXS was performed at the TLS-BL23A beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan (X-ray wavelength: 0.83 Å; incident angle: 0.12°). The scattering intensities are reported as intensity versus Q [where Q = (4π/λ)sin(θ/2)], along with the scattering angles in these patterns; calibration was performed using silver behenate.
