    , Accepted 18th October 2017First published on 19th October 2017AbstractThis work highlights the utilization of a novel hole-transporting material (HTM) derived from benzothiadiazole: 4-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (CF-BTz-ThR) and aligned TiO2 nano-bundles (TiO2 NBs) as the electron transporting layer (ETL) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The aligned TiO2 NBs were grown on titanium (Ti)-coated FTO substrates using a facile hydrothermal method. The newly designed CF-BTz-ThR molecule with suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) favored the effective hole injection from perovskite deposited aligned TiO2 NBs thin film. The PSCs demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼15.4% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of ∼22.42 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼1.02 V. The efficiency data show the importance of proper molecular engineering whilst highlighting the advantages of dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have recently been emerged as the most researched photovoltaic technology due to excellent electron and hole conductivity and mobility of 5–10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1–5 cm2 V−1 s−1,1–4 respectively, with a direct band gap of ∼1.55 eV.5 Over a relatively short period of research and development, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20% has been achieved by PSCs.6–8 Traditionally, the metal oxide electron-transporting layer (ETL) is a key component in PSCs as it is responsible for transporting the electrons. The performance of PSCs is dependent on the size, shape, structure, and orientation of the metal oxides. The TiO2 nanoparticles can have numerous defect-rich grain boundaries within a random nanoparticulate network, and this can hamper the charge transport within the device,9 limit the fast flow of free electrons10 and subsequently affect the overall efficiency.11 Earlier, P. E. De Jongh observed that the structural disorder at the grain boundaries of crystalline particles contributed to the scattering of free electrons, thus reducing the electron mobility.11 To circumvent this, a wide range of more ordered TiO2 films with tunable pore sizes and periodic mesospaces, such as ‘well-organized mesoporous’ TiO2, can be used instead.12,13 Ordered 1D architectures of TiO2 electrode, which include nanowires14–16 nanorods17–19 and nanotubes,20,21 eliminate the drawbacks associated with the uniformity and randomization of the grain network22 and provide direct electrical pathways for the photogenerated electrons.23,24 These 1D architectures could be advantageous to deposit larger amounts of perovskite sensitizers, with the aim of improving the light-absorption ability.21 1D structures have also been reported to lower the charge recombination and improve the charge collection.25,26 Recently, Nazeeruddin et al. reported the development of highly ordered and transparent sub-micrometer TiO2 nanotube array films that yielded an encouraging photovoltaic performance of ∼14.8% under standard full-sun illumination.27 Additionally, a sub-micrometer, rutile-type, TiO2 nanorod-based device with a PCE of ∼9.4% was reported by Park and co-workers,28 whilst Xu et al. fabricated rutile-TiO2 nanowire-based PSCs, which achieved a PCE of ∼11.7%.14
To increase the power conversion efficiency of the PSCs, the valence band and the conduction band of the perovskite absorber need to be well aligned with the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of the hole transporting material (HTM) and the conduction band of the electron transporting layer (ETL), respectively. The use of HTMs ensures ohmic contact of perovskite layer with the back metal electrode by suppressing the charge recombination and transferring holes from the active perovskite material to the corresponding electrode. Therefore, HTMs with a high carrier mobility and a higher energy of HOMO level than the valence band of the perovskite material are essential. The spiro-derivative 2,20,7,70-tetrakis (N,N0-di-p-methoxy-phenyl-amine)-9,90-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is a model HTM due to its appropriate energy level alignment and good hole transporting properties for minimizing any losses in electrical potential and the charge recombination in the materials.29–31 However, Spiro-OMeTAD is costly due to complex synthetic and purification steps, and this limits its potential to be used in large-scale applications of PSCs. In addition the charge carrier mobility in spiro-OMeTAD is also an issue. Recently, several researchers have explored the utilization of dopant-free HTMs for high-performance PSCs.32,33 M. Franckevicius et al. have reported incorporating a dopant-free spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene]-based HTM within PSCs and achieving a PCE of ∼13.4%.34 Another report highlighted the development of a planar n–i–p PSC that lacked any electronic dopant in the HTM and showed a steady-state efficiency of up to ∼18.8%35 Thus, the development of cost-effective and efficient HTMs is a priority.
Donor–acceptor–acceptor (D–A–A) or donor–donor–acceptor (D–D–A) type small organic molecules are promising HTM candidates due to their versatile structural configurations.36 These molecules have tuneable optical and electrical properties and can be synthesized by a range of wet-processing procedures with low production cost. In this work, PSCs were constructed with dopant-free CF-BTz-ThR (as HTM) and aligned TiO2 NBs (the ETL). CF-BTz-ThR consists of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the core unit and n-hexyl bithiophene and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) benzene as π-conjugated components, which display planar and rigid geometry and have demonstrated compatible energy alignment with CH3NH3PbI3. The submicrometer-aligned TiO2 NBs were initially infiltrated with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite; dopant-free CF-BTz-ThR and gold were then deposited onto this layer. The device demonstrated a short circuit current density (Jsc) of ∼22.42 mA cm−2, a Voc of ∼1.02 V, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼15.4% under AM 1.5 illumination at an intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a PSC has been fabricated using aligned TiO2 NBs (as ETL) integrated with newly designed CF-BTz-ThR (as HTM).
Experimental
Preparation of aligned TiO2 NBs
A Titanium (Ti) thin film (∼400–600 nm) was deposited by RF sputtering on FTO substrate using the procedure reported elsewhere.37 Briefly, cleaned FTO substrates were used for the deposition using a Ti target (99.95%, ITASCO, Korea) as the source under a working pressure of ∼5 mTorr by applying RF power of ∼150 W in argon gas. After that, aligned TiO2 NBs were grown as follows: Ti-deposited FTO substrates were placed against the wall of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The sealed autoclave was heated at ∼220 °C for 20 h. After autoclaving, the prepared samples were rinsed with deionized (DI) water, followed by the dipping of the substrates into 0.4 M HCl aqueous solution for 2 h to exchange Na+ for H+, and the substrates were finally washed with DI water before being placed in a muffle furnace for annealing at 500 °C for 3 h. The color of the substrate changed to transparent, indicated that the Ti film fully converted into Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 in the presence of the NaOH solution. The synthesis of the CF-BTz-ThR hole transporting materials is shown in Scheme S1.†
Device fabrication
The perovskite devices were fabricated by depositing CH3NH3PbI3 on the aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO in two steps. First, PbI2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was coated by a spin coater at the speed of ∼2000 rpm for ∼40 s using PVDF membrane syringe filter (Jet Biofil). Then, PbI2/aligned TiO2 NBs substrates were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (synthesized according to a reported literature38) in 2-propanol. The thin films were heated at ∼100 °C for 30 min to form the CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO. Furthermore, 20 μl of dopant-free CF-BTz-ThR HTM (60 mg in 1 ml chlorobenzene) was then deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO by spin-coating at ∼3000 rpm for ∼30 s before the device was dried at ∼100 °C for 15 min to obtain CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO. Finally, the Au layer as a back contact (thickness ∼100 nm) was formed using thermal evaporation to achieve Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO as the fabricated PSC. For comparison, a PSC represented by Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NPs/FTO based on traditional TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) thin film as the ETL was also fabricated.
Characterizations
All the chemical reagents were commercially purchased and used without further purification. Flash column chromatography was performed on a column packed with silica gel (300–400 mesh) for the purification of organic molecules. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates of aluminum silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) were used to monitor reaction progress. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Hitachi S-4700) and atomic force spectroscopy (AFM, Nanoscope IV, Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) were used to investigate the quantitative and qualitative properties of the thin films. The crystalline nature and phases were studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54178 Å) with the Bragg angle ranging between 20 and 80°. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a JEOL FT-NMR spectrophotometer, with CDCl3 as the reference solvent (1H at 600 MHz and 13C at 100 MHz). The chemical shift values were measured as δ values in parts per million (ppm) compared to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out using a FTIR-4100 (JASCO) spectrometer. UltraViolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were measured with a V-670 (JASCO) spectrophotometer, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a FP-6500 (JASCO) fluorometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a WPG 100 potentiostat/galvanostat (WonA Tech) at a scan rate of ∼100 mV s−1. CF-BTz-ThR was dissolved in dichloromethane solvent, and the thin film was drop-casted on the ITO working electrode and dried at ∼60 °C for 4 h under nitrogen. CV measurements were performed in a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile (as the supporting electrolyte). For CV analysis, a three-electrode electrochemical system comprising a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode was used. Ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used to internally calibrate the potentials: the redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal standard reference. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a TA instruments Q-50 thermogravimetry analyzer at a scan rate of ∼10 °C min−1, under an inert atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was characterized by TA instrument DSC-2910 at heating and cooling rates of ∼10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The current density (J)–voltage (V) measurements were performed for elucidating the performances of PSCs using a computerized digital multimeter (Model 2000, Keithley) with a variable load under one sun illumination (1.5 AM at 100 mW cm−2). A 1000 W metal halide lamp supplied the light, and the intensity was adjusted to simulate 1.5 AM at 100 mW cm−2 using a Si photodetector fitted with a Ka-5 filter as a reference, which had been calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Golden CO, USA). All the fabricated PSCs were measured using a voltage step of ∼10 mV with 0 ms delay time and a scan rate of 0.02 V s −1. During the J–V measurements, a black mask was used to cover the active area (∼0.20 cm2). The operating temperature was maintained in the range 20–30 °C by a small cooling fan. To ensure accuracy and precision of the PCE results, five test cells of both the devices were measured under 1 sun illumination, and the average of the three most efficient cells from each device was considered. J–V testing of each device was repeated three times for the accuracy of the results. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was examined using an IPCE system for solar cells (constructed by PV Measurements, Inc., USA based on our design). Before the IPCE measurements were performed, the system was calibrated with a silicon photodiode, which itself had been calibrated using the NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as standard. The IPCE results of the fabricated PSCs were collected as a function of wavelengths ranging from ∼400 to ∼1000 nm using a 75 W Xe lamp as a light source for generating a monochromatic beam at a low chopping frequency.
Results and discussion
The morphology of the aligned TiO2 NBs was investigated by FESEM analysis, and the results are presented in Fig. 1. The RF-deposited Ti thin film on a FTO substrate has a uniform distribution of Ti layer having a thickness of ∼400–600 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The surface view [Fig. 1(b and c)] displays the standing nanorods in bundles over the surface of FTO substrate, with a high aspect ratio. At high magnification mode, the visible nano-bundles possess an average diameter of ∼50 nm. Moreover, the porous nature can be seen in the high magnification image of the nano-bundles, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(d). The morphology and roughness parameters of aligned TiO2 NBs are further confirmed by the topographic and three dimensional (3D) AFM images, as shown in Fig. S1(a and b).†

The XRD patterns of the aligned TiO2 NBs [Fig. 2(a)] show all of the diffraction peaks corresponding to the TiO2 anatase phase. These are at: ∼25.4° (101), ∼38.2° (004), ∼48.2° (200), ∼54.1° (105), ∼55.2° (211), ∼62.9° (204), ∼70.3° (220), and ∼75.3° (215), consistent with JCPDS 21-1272. From Fig. 2(a), the observed XRD patterns confirm the typical tetragonal anatase TiO2 with the space group of D4th19 – I4l/amd. The lattice constants of TiO2 at room temperature are a = ∼3.782 Å and c = ∼9.502 Å. Raman scattering spectroscopy has been used to further analyze the TiO2 anatase phase of the aligned TiO2 NBs. Fig. 2(b) shows a prominent Raman band at ∼184 cm−1, with other peaks at ∼396, ∼510, and ∼624 cm−1, corresponding to B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg respectively. The prominent peak is assigned to the Eg mode of the anatase phase; it usually arises from the vibrations of the anatase crystal structure in TiO2,39,40 indicating that the aligned TiO2 NBs are composed of purely the anatase phase. This result is in complete agreement with the XRD results.

The transmittance spectra of the Ti/FTO and aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO are compared in Fig. S2.† The Ti/FTO thin film has a low transmittance (∼22%), which is significantly improved after Ti is converted to TiO2 NBs. The XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NPs/FTO and CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO thin films are shown in Fig. S2(b).† Both thin films show the presence of perovskite and TiO2 and FTO phases, indicating the sensitization of perovskite over the TiO2 surface. The diffraction peak at ∼12.8° represents the unconverted PbI2 on the TiO2 surface. The CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO thin film exhibits a low intensity peak at ∼12.8°, which can likely be attributed to the diffusion of CH3NH+ and I− to the aligned TiO2 NBs. During sensitization, the PbI2 precursor infiltrates into aligned TiO2 NB: the pore size of the NBs determines the crystal size that might be confined within the NBs. As analyzed by BET surface analysis, the grown TiO2 NBs film possesses a high surface area of ∼138 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of ∼31.7 cm3 g−1. However, the TiO2 NPs thin film shows a low BET surface area (∼100 m2 g−1). Therefore, the conversion rate from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 is improved41 using a porous surface of aligned TiO2 NBs, whereas, for the NP film morphology, conversion starts at the surface but is likely hindered at the bottom due to the irregular dimensionality of the NPs.
The optical properties of CF-BTz-ThR have been analyzed by measuring its UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra; these are shown in Fig. 3. Two absorption peaks at ∼360 and ∼508 nm are observed (in o-dichlorobenzene), representing the π–π* transition and n–π* transitions of the chromophores, respectively. It is also seen that the wavelength of ∼508 nm is the maximum absorption and provides a reasonable estimate of the onset band gap (Eoptg) of ∼2.03 eV (Table 1). This peak also has a high absorption coefficient, which is clear evidence for the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon.42 Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CF-BTz-ThR in o-dichlorobenzene solution shows a strong emission band at ∼638 nm, originating from the electron-deficient –CF3 groups in the meta-positions on the benzene ring of the organic chromophore; the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing functional groups (–CF3) enhances the charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor. The thermal properties of CF-BTz-ThR were investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under an inert atmosphere, as displayed in Fig. S4(a and b).† From the electrical conductivity results (Fig. S4(d)†), CF-BTz-ThR has a conductivity of ∼8.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of CF-BTz-ThR thin film was carried out in a 0.1 M tetra butyl ammonium hexafluoro phosphate [nBu4N]+[PF6]− solution at a potential scan rate of ∼100 mV s−1. The CV plot (Fig. 4) shows a typical oxidation peak at onset value Eox = +0.33 V. From the CV data, HOMO (−5.42 eV) and LUMO (−3.39 eV) energy levels were estimated for the CF-BTz-ThR thin film, and the corresponding optical band gap (Eg) is found as ∼2.03 eV, as summarized in Table 1. Importantly, the presence of the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene acceptor unit in CF-BTz-ThR was found to be responsible for fluorescence emission in the red region due to strong electron-withdrawing groups (–CF3). An energy band diagram showing the band gaps and conduction band edges of CF-BTz-ThR is shown in Fig. 5. As reported,43 the energy levels of HTMs play a vital role in simultaneously enhancing charge recombination and transportation and determining the open circuit voltage (Voc).44 A suitable HOMO level of CF-BTz-ThR results from the presence of two strong trifluoromethyl groups attached to phenylene. Moreover, the fluorine atoms in CF-BTz-ThR decrease the HOMO level,45 and the estimated LUMO level of CF-BTz-ThR is much more positive than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.9 eV), resulting in reduced recombination. Thus, CF-BTz-ThR HTM is likely to have an overpotential, able to facilitate efficient photogenerated charge transfer at the interface.46 The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO PSCs under 1 sun irradiance were used to determine the photovoltaic performance, as shown in Fig. 6(a). A typical PSC consists of aligned TiO2 NBs (as ETL) and CF-BTz-ThR (HTM). The effect of the aligned TiO2 NBs structure on the performance of PSCs was compared with that of solar cells based on TiO2 NPs; the corresponding performance parameters are shown in Table 2. Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO PSC has a Jsc ∼ 22.44 mA cm−2 and a Voc ∼ 1.02 mV, resulting in a PCE of ∼15.4%. The PCE of Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NPs/FTO device is ∼13.6% with Jsc ∼ 20.73 mA cm−2 and Voc ∼ 1.02 V. The performance of the reference Au/Spiro-MeOTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NPs/FTO device (PCE ∼ 10.4%) is inferior to the CF-BTz-ThR-based devices. The superior Jsc of Au/CF-BTz-ThR/CH3NH3PbI3/aligned TiO2 NBs/FTO PSC can be attributed to the morphology of the vertically arranged TiO2 nano bundles. This morphology likely enhances the photocurrent by improving the charge extraction/collection. It is also probable that the aligned TiO2 NBs thin film facilitates electron transport, resulting in the observed Jsc and FF. Compared with the TiO2 NPs film, the aligned TiO2 NBs is able to reduce the number of grain boundaries on the film surface, thereby reducing the corresponding series resistance. As a result, the Jsc and FF of the PSC based on the aligned TiO2 NBs ETL are superior to the traditional TiO2 NPs ETL-based PSCs. Moreover, a high Jsc for the aligned TiO2 NBs based PSC is substantiated by the IPCE spectrum [Fig. 6(b)]. The IPCE values for aligned TiO2 NBs and TiO2 NPs based PSCs correlate with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements.

Conclusions
The unique and well-defined morphology of aligned TiO2 NBs acting as an ETL in combination with a novel benzothiadiazole substituted derivate, CF-BTz-ThR as HTM is utilized for the fabrication of high performance PSC. The fabricated PSC yields PCE of over 15% without dopants in the HTM. On comparison, the PSC with TiO2 NPs (as the ETL) has a lower PCE (13%), highlighting the value of incorporating NBs within perovskite solar cells. The results demonstrate that aligned TiO2 NBs (as the ETL) and dopant-free CF-BTz-ThR HTM have great future potential in PSCs.
