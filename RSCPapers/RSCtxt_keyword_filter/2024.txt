Nearly perfect absorption over a broad spectrum range can be achieved in <100 nm thick films on top of a one-dimensional photonic crystal or metal films. This phenomenon can be attributed to interference induced photonic localization, which enhances the absorption and reduces the reflection of the films. Perfect solar absorption and low carrier thermalization loss can be achieved when the light-trapping structures with a wedge-shaped spacer layer or semiconductor films are combined with spectrum-splitting structures.
1 Introduction
To reduce carbon dioxide release and cope with the increasing energy demand, photovoltaic solar cells have attracted significant attention. However, the cost efficiency and power conversion efficiency of solar cells are still relatively low. The high cost is mainly due to the use of expensive semiconductor materials, such as thick crystalline silicon films.1,2 The efficiency is primarily limited by thermalization loss.1–3
The best way to enhance cost efficiency is to reduce solar cells to nanoscale2,4–9 to reduce material usage. In solar cells, the carrier collection length should be shorter than the carrier diffusion length (i.e., the distance travelled by a carrier before recombination). Thus nanoscale solar cells can use low-cost materials with a lower carrier diffusion length (e.g., CuO, FeS2, and organic materials) to further reduce the cost.4 However, nanoscale materials are usually too thin to completely absorb the solar light. Plasmons, photonic crystals, and quasi-random nanostructures can enhance absorption.4,10–20 Many theoretical and experimental studies on interference-based light-trapping structures have demonstrated further improvement of the absorption of nanoscale thickness films compared with traditional light-trapping structures21–23 at the cost of the reduced working frequency range. Perfect broadband absorption is still difficult to achieve in <100 nm thick films.
Carrier thermalization loss results from energy mismatch between the photon energy Eω = ℏω and the bandgap of semiconductors Eg.1–3 Photons with energy below the bandgap of semiconductors are not absorbed, while photons with energy above the bandgap can create only a maximum open-circuit voltage Voc. The excess energy Eω − eVoc is converted to heat loss, where e is the electron charge.1–3 Multijunction solar cells can reduce carrier thermalization loss with the increased number of junctions. However, only 2- and 3-junction solar cells can be used for industrial production due to the limitation of lattice matching and current matching requirements.2,3 Another widely studied and demonstrated technique to reduce the thermalization loss is to use side-by-side subcells and a spectrum-splitting structure,3,24–26 which directs the solar light of different wavelengths to different subcells with different bandgaps Eg. The thermalization loss can be reduced to approximately 10% by using 8–10 different subcells.3 In this paper, CdS (Eg = 2.42 eV), Ga0.5In0.5P (Eg = 1.9 eV), GaAs (Eg = 1.42 eV), and In0.53Ga0.47As (Eg = 0.86 eV) single crystal compound semiconductor films are used in the calculation. These semiconductors have an appropriate band gap and also have been widely used in high efficiency solar cells. The optical properties of these semiconductors such as the extinction coefficient have been measured accurately.
In this paper, we show that by combining two distinct well-established techniques, the interference-based light-trapping structures and the spectrum-splitting structure, perfect broadband solar absorption can be achieved in nanoscale thickness semiconductor films (SFs). First, for the 32 nm GaAs films on top of a light-trapping structure, numerical and analytical results show narrow-band resonant absorption exceeding 90% (∼nine times larger than that of suspended GaAs films) as a result of photon localization. Second, we match the resonant absorption of the light-trapping structure with the spectrum-splitting structure by using a wedge-shaped spacer layer or SFs and demonstrate perfect broadband solar absorption in 30–240 nm thick SFs.
2 Model and theory
The light-trapping structure consists of a SF on top of a spacer layer and a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) [Fig. 1(a)] or a 130 nm thick Ag film [Fig. 1(b)] at the bottom as the resonant back reflector. As demonstrated previously, such structures without a wedge-shaped spacer layer or SFs can greatly enhance the absorption of graphene, MoS2, and ultra-thin SFs within a certain wavelength region.22,23,27–32 We should also point out that the physical mechanism is different with the proposed structures consisting of thick SFs on photonic crystals.33,34 The optical interference effects in thick SFs are unimportant due to the strong absorption and an antireflection coating layer must be used to reduce the reflection.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of SFs on (a) 1DPC and (b) Ag films with a spacer layer. (c) Schematic of a spectrum-splitting structure combined with a light-trapping structure. 
The 1DPC is composed of 8.5 periods of alternating doped ZnS and SiO2 layers. The refractive indices of ZnS and SiO2 at λ = 550 nm are nZnS = 2.59 and nSiO2 = 1.55, respectively. The permittivities of silver films are frequency dependent.35 Since the quantum confinement effect is significant only when the thickness of SFs is less than 20 nm at room temperature, the permittivities of thick semiconductor films are used in the calculation.35,36 All layers are nonmagnetic (μ = 1). The thickness of the ZnS (SiO2) layers is λpcs/4nZnS (λpcs/4nSiO2), where λpcs is the center wavelength. The spectrum-splitting structure is composed of a dense flint ZF13 prism and a low-dispersion convex lens [Fig. 1(c)]. The refractive index of ZF13 glass is nZF132 = zg1 − zg2λ2 + zg3λ−2 + zg4λ−4 − zg5λ−6 + zg6λ−8, where zg1 = 3.05344, zg2 = 1.2752 × 10−2, zg3 = 4.0609 × 10−2, zg4 = 2.2706 × 10−3, zg5 = 7.8087 × 10−5, and zg6 = 1.9874 × 10−5.
To model the absorption of SFs in this structure, the standard transfer matrix method is used.28,32 In the lth layer, the electric field of the TE mode light with incident angle θi is given by El(z,y) = [Aleiklz(z−zl) + Ble−iklz(z−zl)]eiklyyex,(1)and the magnetic field of the TM mode in the lth layer is given by Hl(z,y) = [Aleiklz(z−zl) + Ble−iklz(z−zl)]eiklyyex,(2)where klz = klrz + ikliz (kly = klry + ikliy) is the wave vector of the light in the z(y) direction, ex is the unit vectors in the x direction, and zl is the position of the lth layer in the z direction.
The electric fields of the TE mode or the magnetic fields of the TM mode in the (l + 1)th and lth layers are related by the transfer matrix utilizing the boundary conditions (3)where  for the TE (TM) mode, μl(ω) is the permeability, εl(ω) = εlr(ω) + iεli(ω) is the complex dielectric permittivity, and dl is the thickness of the lth layer. Thus, the light in the (l + 1)th layer is related to the incident fields by the transfer matrix (4)
Thus, we can obtain the absorbance of the lth layer l using the Poynting vector S = E × H28,32 l = [S(l−1)i + S(l+1)i − S(l−1)0 − S(l+1)0]/S0i,(5)where S(l−1)i and S(l−1)0 [S(l+1)i and S(l+1)0] are the incident and outgoing Poynting vectors in (l − 1)th and [(l + 1)th] layers, respectively, and S0i is the incident Poynting vector in air.
For a perfect reflecting mirror without a spacer layer, straightforward algebra gives the absorptance po = 1 − |(1 + γsm)/(1 − γsm)|2,(6)where ; ; nsm and dsm are the refractive index and the thickness of SFs, respectively, and ksm is the wave vector in the SFs. For thick metal film mirrors without the spacer layer, the absorptance is (7)where , , n21 = nmf − nsm, n12 = nmf + nsm, n10 = 1 − nsm, and n01 = nsm + 1, nmf are the refractive indices of metal films.
For the spectrum-splitting structure, the angle of refraction of light through a prism is given by sin[θrp(λ)] = sinθA − arcsin[sin(θip)/nZF13(λ)]nZF13(λ),(8)where θA is the prism vertex angle, and θip is the light incidence angle to the prism. The light incidence angle to the convex lens is θil(λ) = θrp(λ) − θA/2 − θp, where θp is the prism tilt angle. For perfect lens, the light is focused at x(λ) = f0tan[θil(λ)], where f0 is the focal length of the lens. For actual convex lens with aberrations, each of the refraction of light through the lens can be solved numerically using Snell's law.
3 Numerical results
As shown in Fig. 2(a), for 32 nm (96 nm) GaAs films, the maximum absorbance at the resonant wavelength λ = 530 nm of solar radiation is improved by the 1DPC from ∼10.8% (28.4%) for suspended films to ∼90.8% (95.5%) even without antireflection coating layers. The magnitude of the enhancement is much larger than that of thick SFs on a photonic crystal even with antireflection coating layers.33,34 This is because the SFs act as a 1D surface defect that leads to localization on the surface due to interference effects [Fig. 2(e) and (f)], thereby reducing the reflection and enhancing the absorption,28,30,32 similar to graphene and monolayer MoS2 on top of the 1DPC. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the 1DPC with increasing number N of periods has increasing reflectivity, photonic localization, and hence absorption. The SF resonant absorption with the 1DPC is close to that with a perfect reflection mirror (black solid circles) and slightly better than that with a Ag film (blue solid line and blue open circle), which has a lower reflectivity. However, the width of the resonant absorption for the 1DPC is smaller than that for the Ag film, due to the limited photonic band gap of the 1DPC. Different from the resonant absorption, the SF absorption on the Ag film almost coincides with that on a perfect reflection mirror.

(b) Absorptance of 96 nm GaAs films on the 1DPC as a function of the wavelength with different period numbers N of the 1DPC.

For oblique light incidence, the large refractive index of GaAs ensures, by Snell's law, that the light propagation angle θ′ in the GaAs film is small even with a large incident angle θi. Thus the resonant absorption wavelength ∝cosθ′ for the SFs on the 1DPC is less affected by the light incident angle [Fig. 2(c) and (d)], and favors the design of solar cells.
An essential ingredient of our proposal is the tunability of the resonant absorption wavelength λR of the light-trapping structure. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), for the 1DPC, λR = 4nsmdsm/(2m + 1) (m ∈ ) decreases with decreasing SF thickness dsm. This remains qualitatively true for the Ag film, since we still have the estimate λR ∼ 4nsmdsm/(2m + 1). Another approach to tune λR is to insert a transparent (e.g., AlAs) spacer layer, e.g., for the 100 nm GaAs film on the 1DPC with λpcs = 700 nm and Ag films, λR almost linearly increases with the thickness of the spacer layer [Fig. 3(c) and (d)]. The spacer layer can also act as the buffer layer to enhance or reduce the lattice distortion of the SFs.

Contour plots of the absorptance of 100 nm GaAs films on (c) 1DPC and (d) Ag films as a function of the light wavelength and the thickness of AlAs spacer layers. 
The problem with a given light-trapping structure is that enhanced absorption appears only within a certain range of wavelength. To solve this problem, we propose to combine it with the spectrum-splitting structure, which has been widely used experimentally to reduce the carrier thermalization loss in solar cells.3,24–26 With the spectrum-splitting structure, a dense flint ZF13 prism and a low-dispersion convex lens focus solar light of different wavelengths onto different locations on the SFs of the light-trapping structure [Fig. 1(c)]. By appropriately choosing the species and thicknesses of SFs or the thicknesses of the spacer layers to match the solar wavelength on each location (i.e., use the wedge-shaped spacer layer or SFs), perfect absorption can be achieved for each wavelength. Since the slope of the SFs is smaller than 2.5 × 10−5, the SF surface can be treated as parallel planes at each point. Thus, the transfer matrix method can be used in the calculation. The parameters include [Fig. 1(c)]: the prism vertex angle θA = 30°, the light incidence angle θi = 26.4° (the refracted light in the prism is parallel to the bottom plane of the prism), the prism tilt angle θp = 10° (the light is nearly parallel to the z direction), and the refractive index and the spherical radius of the convex lens are 1.5 and 0.6 m, respectively. CdS (Eg = 2.42 eV), Ga0.5In0.5P (Eg = 1.9 eV), GaAs (Eg = 1.42 eV), and In0.53Ga0.47As (Eg = 0.86 eV) films consist of side-by-side SFs.
Numerical results are shown in Fig. 4. When the thickness of SFs perfectly matches the spectrum splitting with various λpcs (i.e., for lights with wavelength λ0 focused at x = x0 point, the SF thickness at x = x0 is chosen to obtain maximum absorption), the absorption of side-by-side SFs is almost always >90% and the maximum absorption can be >99%. Furthermore, more types of SFs can be used in this structure because the lattice matching and current matching requirements are not restricted. Thus, the proposed structures can significantly reduce carrier thermalization loss. Apart from applications in solar cells, perfect wide-range absorption can also have applications in optoelectronic devices, such as photoelectric detectors. Different for nanowire array solar cells, the proposed structures have low surface recombination loss. For SFs with linearly varied thicknesses [solid line in the inset of Fig. 4(a) and (b)], only the absorption of the In0.53Ga0.47As film significantly decreases because the dispersion of ZF13 glass is too small to effectively separate different-wavelength light within this wavelength range.

The inset shows the thickness of side-by-side SFs as a function of the x coordinate. The absorptance of side-by-side SFs on (c) 1DPC and (d) Ag films with perfect lens (black open circle curves) and convex lens with different diameters DL. The inset in (c) and (d) shows a focused light spot of different wavelengths for DL = 8 and DL = 15 cm, respectively. 
The influence of lens aberrations on SF absorption is shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). An actual convex lens cannot focus parallel light to a perfect point because of lens aberrations, which increase with increased lens diameter DL [inset of Fig. 4(c) and (d)]. Lens aberrations reduce the light-trapping effect because obtaining the maximum absorption from the entire whole focused light spot is difficult by varying the thickness of SFs. The influence of lens aberrations is reduced when the spectrum-splitting structure with a strong dispersion ability is used. The changes in SF absorption are very small for DL < 8 cm. The absorption of GaAs and In0.53Ga0.47As significantly decreases for DL = 15 cm because of the low dispersion of ZF13 glass within the long wavelength range.
Perfect absorption can be achieved in the full solar spectrum by varying the spacer-layer thickness. Side-by-side SFs consist of 80 nm CdS, 80 nm Ga0.5In0.5P, 240 nm GaAs, and 240 nm In0.53Ga0.47As films. The refractive index of a spacer layer is 2.6. The absorptance of SFs combined with the spectrum-splitting structure can exceed 90% by varying the spacer-layer thickness [Fig. 5(a)]. The thickness of SFs does not have to satisfy dsm = (2m + 1)λ/4nsm. SFs with a large absorption coefficient can be thinner. The influence of the indium tin oxide transparency electrode on top of SFs is shown in Fig. 5(b). The absorptance of 20 nm indium tin oxide films is about 5%, and the absorptance of SFs shows about 5% reduction.

4 Discussion and conclusion
Finally, we discuss on the fabrication techniques and the potential improvement of the proposed structures. The length of the subcells is about 0.5–2 cm. The subcells can be fabricated separately and then joined using fasteners, adhesive, or welding. In each subcells, for SFs on top of the 1DPC (which can be regarded as a half of the semiconductor microcavity) or metal films with spacer layers, a similar structure has been fabricated in experiments.22 The difference in the latter is that the SFs or spacer layers are wedge-shaped layers, which can be grown by existing technology such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As shown by J. P. Prineas et al.,37 to reduce the speed of light 210 wedge-shaped semiconductor layers are grown by MBE. Single crystal compound semiconductors are used in the calculation. To fabricate single crystal compound semiconductors such as GaAs, the expensive MBE technique is used, which increases the cost. However, organic materials and amorphous semiconductors with lower carrier diffusion length are expected to be used in nanoscale solar cells, which can be fabricated by using low cost technology (e.g., nanoscale amorphous CuO can be fabricated by magnetron sputtering38). Even though strong light-trapping effects are observed in the proposed structures, to achieve perfect absorption in <20 nm SFs, a light-trapping structure with more strong photonic localization such as the microcavity should be used.39,40 For the proposed spectrum-splitting structure, dispersion ability within the long wavelength range is low because of the low dispersion of ZF13 glass that degrades performance. Prism and convex lens without an antireflection film can reflect about 10–15% solar light. Thus, various types of spectrum-splitting structures should be studied in the future.3,24–26
In conclusion, the optical absorption of SFs on top of the 1DPC and Ag films combined with spectrum-splitting structures is investigated. In these structures, the maximum optical absorptance of <100 nm SFs can be >90% because of photon localization. The absorption of SFs on the 1DPC is less affected by the incident angle of light and can be tuned by varying the thickness of the SFs and spacer layers. By using side-by-side nanoscale thickness SFs in combination with spectrum-splitting structures, perfect solar absorption can be achieved with low carrier thermalization loss. Our proposal can have significant applications in the development of ultra-thin and high-efficiency solar cells and in optoelectronic devices, such as photoelectric detectors.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Absorptance of different thickness GaAs films without a spacer layer as a function of the wavelength for suspended GaAs films (black line) and GaAs films with a 1DPC (red or grey line). (b) Absorptance of 96 nm GaAs films on the 1DPC as a function of the wavelength with different period numbers N of the 1DPC. The black solid-circle curve shows the absorptance of 96 nm GaAs films with the perfect reflection mirror. The blue solid line and blue open circle curve show the absorptance of 78 nm GaAs films on Ag films. The absorptance of 96 nm GaAs films on a 1DPC as a function of the light wavelength for different incident angles for (c) TE mode and (d) TM mode. Optical field distribution in (e) 32 and (f) 96 nm GaAs films on the 1DPC.	 

 	Fig. 3  Contour plots of the absorptance of the GaAs films on (a) 1DPC and (b) Ag films without spacer layers as a function of the light wavelength and the thickness of GaAs films with λpcs = 550 nm. Contour plots of the absorptance of 100 nm GaAs films on (c) 1DPC and (d) Ag films as a function of the light wavelength and the thickness of AlAs spacer layers.	 

 	Fig. 4  Absorptance of side-by-side SFs on (a) 1DPC and (b) Ag films for the SFs with thicknesses that perfectly match the spectrum-splitting structure (open circle curves) and for SFs with linearly varying thicknesses (solid lines). The inset shows the thickness of side-by-side SFs as a function of the x coordinate. The absorptance of side-by-side SFs on (c) 1DPC and (d) Ag films with perfect lens (black open circle curves) and convex lens with different diameters DL. The inset in (c) and (d) shows a focused light spot of different wavelengths for DL = 8 and DL = 15 cm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Absorptance of SFs on the 1DPC (solid circle curves) and Ag films (open circle curves) combined with the spectrum-splitting structure with various spacer layer thicknesses. The inset shows the spacer-layer thickness as a function of the x coordinate. (b) Absorptance of SFs (black solid circle curves) and indium tin oxide films (red open circle curves) on the 1DPC.
