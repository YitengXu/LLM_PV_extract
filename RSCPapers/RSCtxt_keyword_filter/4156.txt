    , Accepted 27th November 2016First published on 15th December 2016AbstractIn the present investigation, gold–silver@titania (Au–Ag@TiO2) plasmonic nanocomposite materials with different Au and Ag compositions were prepared using a simple one-step chemical reduction method and used as photoanodes in high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Au–Ag incorporated TiO2 photoanode demonstrated an enhanced solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 7.33%, which is ∼230% higher than the unmodified TiO2 photoanode (2.22%) under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). This superior solar energy conversion efficiency was mainly due to the synergistic effect between the Au and Ag, and their surface plasmon resonance effect, which improved the optical absorption and interfacial charge transfer by minimizing the charge recombination process. The influence of the Au–Ag composition on the overall energy conversion efficiency was also explored, and the optimized composition with TiO2 was found to be Au75–Ag25. This was reflected in the femtosecond transient absorption dynamics in which the electron–phonon interaction in the Au nanoparticles was measured to be 6.14 ps in TiO2/Au75:Ag25, compared to 2.38 ps for free Au and 4.02 ps for TiO2/Au100:Ag0. The slower dynamics indicates a more efficient electron–hole separation in TiO2/Au75:Ag25 that is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between TiO2 and the noble metal(s) that acts as an electron sink. The significant boost in the solar energy conversion efficiency with the Au–Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite showed its potential as a photoanode for high-efficiency DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar cells are attracting much attention for utilizing natural resources to produce electricity because of concerns over energy depletion and our high dependence on fossil fuels. Among the various types of solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for harvesting solar power because of their low cost, flexibility, ease of production, relatively high energy-conversion efficiency, and low toxicity to the environment.1 However, the efficiency of a DSSC is still lower than that of conventional crystalline silicon-based solar cells. The efficient operation of a DSSC greatly depends on the minimization of charge recombination occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Therefore, designing a photoanode with an efficient transport pathway from the photo-injected charge carriers to the current collector seems to be a possible alternative to enhance the performance of DSSCs.
There are active studies being conducted to overcome the deficiency of TiO2-based DSSCs, which can be divided into a few approaches such as efforts to increase the dye sensitization area through the control structure and morphology of the TiO2 to improve monolayer dye absorption.2,3 Research has also been carried out on ways to improve the light absorption in the visible region. There are two main solutions to this problem: (i) synthesizing a higher efficiency dye and (ii) improving the light absorption in the visible region by incorporating a noble metal into TiO2.4–6 In order to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs, it is essential to prevent the charge recombination process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces. The most common approach is surface modification with metal nanoparticles, non-metals, semiconductor coupling, and hybridization with carbon materials.7–10
In the present decade, the surface of TiO2 has been modified with noble metal nanoparticles such as silver (Ag) and gold (Au) with the aim of improving the efficiency of a DSSC. These noble metal nanoparticles play dual roles in DSSC performance, including the enhancement of the absorption coefficient of the dye and the optical absorption due to surface plasmon resonance.4–6 Moreover, they also play a role in improving the interfacial charge transfer process, and minimize charge recombination, thereby enhancing the electron transfer process in a DSSC.11–13 Hence, noble metal nanoparticles have been targeted for use in DSSCs with the goal of improving the interfacial charge transfer process and photon-to-electron conversion in the visible region. Recently, the performance of a DSSC with Au@TiO2 and Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite material-modified photoanodes has been actively investigated.14–19
Based on the above studies, Au@TiO2 and Ag@TiO2 have normally been used separately as photoanodes in DSSCs. Xu et al.14 reported the first fabrication of bimetallic Au–Ag alloy popcorn nanoparticles by a two-step synthesis method and used them as photoanodes. The Au–Ag alloy was first prepared before it was added into the TiO2 paste. It showed that by introducing the Au–Ag alloy into TiO2, the conversion efficiency improved from 5.26 to 6.09%. Recently, TiO2/Ag/Au have been incorporated into single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using DNA as a biological template and used as a photoanode in DSSCs. After integrating the nanocomposite into the commercial TiO2 paste using a stirring and sonication method, the conversion efficiency was seen to increase from 6.8 to 8.3%.20 Another Au–TiO2–Ag photoanode was prepared by Wang et al. by immersing the TiO2 film into Ag and Au before undergoing the photo-reduction process. The efficiency improved from 6.23 to 7.51% after introducing Au and Ag.21 To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explored the co-deposition of Au and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 as a photoanode for a DSSC by a simple one step method. In the present study, we successfully developed a facile synthesis method to co-deposit Au and Ag nanoparticles on a TiO2 surface using a simple chemical reduction method, and characterized it using various analytical techniques. The DSSC assembled with the Au–Ag@TiO2-modified photoanode showed an enhanced conversion efficiency of 7.33% compared to the one with the unmodified TiO2 (2.22%). Thus, the introduction of plasmonic Au and Ag nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface enhanced the efficiency due to the reduced band gap energy and retarded charge recombination. The influence of the Au–Ag ratio on the overall efficiency was also explored, and the optimum ratio was found to be 75:25. This Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite could be a potential candidate for solar energy conversion.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Materials and characterization techniques
Titanium dioxide (P25) was purchased from Acros Organics. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Merck. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl·H2O) was purchased from abcr.Gmbh & Co. KG. Indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass slides (7 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Xin Yan technology Ltd, China. The N719 (Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA) dye and Iodolyte Z-100 were received from Solaronix. The crystalline phases of the samples were studied via X-ray diffraction (XRD; D5000, Siemens) using copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1. The morphologies of the prepared samples were examined using a Hitachi-SU 8000 field emission scanning electron microscope and a JEOL JEM-2100 F high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The optical absorption properties in the spectral region of 190–900 nm were assessed using a Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV-vis absorption spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence and Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw inVia 2000 system with an argon laser emitting at 325 and 532 nm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using synchrotron radiation from beamline no. 3.2 at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute, Thailand. The femtosecond transient absorption setup is described in detail in the ESI.†
2.2 Synthesis of Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite materials
Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite materials were prepared using a simple one-pot chemical reduction method. Briefly, 500 mg of TiO2 was added to aqueous solutions that contained different compositions of HAuCl:AgNO3 (Au0:Ag100, Au25:Ag75, Au50:Ag50, Au75:Ag25, and Au100:Ag0). Each mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The reductions of Au(III) and Ag(I) were carried out by the drop-wise addition of NaBH4 until the color changed to greenish yellow or purple. The appearance of these greenish yellow or purple colors indicated the formation of the Ag@TiO2, Au–Ag@TiO2, or Au@TiO2 nanocomposite, after which the colloidal suspensions were continually stirred for another 30 min. The nanocomposite was collected and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times by centrifugation. Finally, the product was dried in an oven at 60 °C and stored under dark conditions.
2.3 Fabrication of Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite-modified photoanodes
Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite-modified photoanodes were fabricated using the following procedure. Initially, 300 mg of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite was mixed in an ethanolic solution and stirred for 30 min. A 0.1 M quantity of TTIP was slowly introduced into the above reaction mixture and stirred until a homogenous solution was obtained. Finally, the colloidal suspension of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite was coated on the conducting side of the ITO using the doctor-blade technique with the aid of Scotch-3M tape, and the thickness of the film was ∼12 μm. In order to obtain a stable photoanode, the film was dried at room temperature, sintered at 150 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace, and then allowed to cool naturally to room temperature.
2.4 Fabrication and photovoltaic performance evaluation of Au–Ag@TiO2 photoanode-based DSSCs
The fabricated Au–Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite-modified photoanodes were immersed in an ethanolic solution of 0.3 mM N719 (Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA) dye for 24 h at room temperature under dark conditions. The dye-coated plasmonic photoanodes were withdrawn from the solution and immediately but gently cleaned with ethanol. A platinum-sputtered ITO was placed on a dye-absorbed photoanode, and they were clamped firmly together. A redox electrolyte (Iodolyte Z-100, Solaronix) solution was introduced into the cell assembly by capillary action. An active area of 0.5 cm2 was used to measure the cell performance. A 150 W xenon arc lamp (Newport, Model 69907) containing a simulated AM 1.5G filter was used as a light source throughout the experiments. Prior to measuring the photovoltaic parameter, an Avaspec-2048 fiber optic spectrophotometer was used to measure the light intensity. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) measurements and electrochemical properties of the fabricated Au–Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite-modified photoanode-based DSSCs were studied using a computer-controlled VersaSTAT 3 (Princeton Applied Research, USA) electrochemical workstation.
3. Results and discussion
During the synthesis of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite, it was observed that the color of the nanocomposite changed during the stirring process, and the extent of this change depended on the Au–Ag ratio on the TiO2. The TiO2 nanocomposite without Au and Ag was white. After adding the Au and Ag precursors, the initial color of the mixture was a clear yellow. As the stirring process continued, the mixture with only Ag turned green and then greenish brown, whereas a purple color was observed when Au was added. The nanocomposite became darker in color as the Au content increased (Fig. 1). The different color of the nanocomposite that was obtained after the incorporation of the metal indicated that different visible light absorption was exhibited by the nanocomposite with the addition of different metals.

The back-scattered electrons (BSEs) and FESEM images indicated the general structure and distribution of Au and Ag within the synthesized Au–Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the FESEM image of the TiO2 nanoparticles, which appeared to be spherical and uniform in size. Upon the addition of Au and Ag nanoparticles, no significant change in morphology was observed for the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite (Fig. 2b). Since the distribution of Au and Ag cannot be clearly shown by the FESEM image, a BSE image of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite was taken. The quantity of back-scattered electrons is highly dependent on the atomic number of a sample. Materials with a higher atomic number will have more back-scattered electrons. Since Au and Ag have greater atomic numbers than titanium and oxygen, Au and Ag nanoparticles will be brighter than titanium dioxide. From the BSE image, it can be observed that the Au and Ag nanoparticles were homogenously distributed on the TiO2 nanoparticles. There are two particle size ranges observed on the TiO2 surface. It was believed that the Au and Ag had different particle sizes. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis of the Au–Ag@TiO2 thin film also confirmed that the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite, composed of Au and Ag elements, dispersed on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles with Ti and O signals (Fig. 2c). Further, TEM images of Au–Ag@TiO2 were also recorded, and are shown in Fig. 2d–f. Fig. 2d shows Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles, and it can be observed that the TiO2 nanoparticles are spherical in shape, with a particle size range of 20–25 nm. Further, the TEM image clearly shows that the small spherical Ag nanoparticles with a particle size range of 2–5 nm are well distributed and decorated on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles.

The TEM image of the Au@TiO2 nanoparticles is presented in Fig. 2e, and the Au particle size range is 8–20 nm. Thus, we can observe that the particle size of Au decoration is larger than the Ag particle size, which explains the BSE image of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite. Fig. 2f depicts the TEM image of Au–Ag@TiO2 (Au75–Ag25). It is also observed that the Au and Ag nanoparticles interact with TiO2, with most of the Au and Ag nanoparticles actually embedded within TiO2 and a few of them surrounding TiO2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 2g. The pattern clearly reveals that the bright concentric rings from the center outward belong to the diffraction from (111), (310), (312), and (421) rutile TiO2 and Au(222).
The XRD pattern obtained for Au–Ag@TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3, along with those of TiO2, Au/TiO2, and Ag/TiO2 for comparison. The TiO2, Ag@TiO2, Au@TiO2, and Au–Ag@TiO2 films were composed of mixed anatase and rutile phases, which agreed with the reference patterns JCPDS 83-2243 and 21-1276, respectively. The diffraction peaks observed at 25.5°, 38.4°, 48.2°, and 75° correspond to the anatase phase of TiO2 and are assigned to the (101), (004), (200), and (215) crystallographic planes, respectively. In contrast, the peaks at 54.9° and 63° are in good agreement with the rutile phase of TiO2 and are assigned to the (220) and (002) crystallographic planes, respectively. No XRD peak could be discerned because of the low content of Ag in the nanocomposite. However, for 100% Au composition, a peak at 44° could be identified that belongs to the (200) plane of a face-centered cubic gold phase (JCPDS 04-0784). It was difficult to differentiate the Ag from the TiO2 signals even at a 100% Ag composition due to the overlapping of the Ag signal with the rutile plane in TiO2. The XRD patterns clearly confirmed that the anatase and rutile phases were retained without a phase change after the deposition of Au and Ag nanoparticles. The additional peaks were due to the ITO substrate.

An alternative method to explore the crystallization is through Raman scattering. Raman scattering as a local probe is very sensitive to the crystalline structure and nanostructure of a material. Raman studies were performed in the range of 100–1000 cm−1, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The peaks at 143.32, 202.61, 397.92, 514.89, and 635.22 cm−1 were due to the anatase phase TiO2.19,22 It can be observed that the peaks became weak and broad with the addition of Au and Ag when the samples had a local lattice defect.23 The Raman peaks also showed a red-shift toward a lower frequency. This can be attributed to the strain induced by Au and Ag loading and may have been due to the changes in the crystalline size.24 However, no signals related to metal particles were identified for the samples because of the relatively low concentration of Au or Ag loaded onto TiO2 and its weak Raman scattering power. An interesting observation is that the peak intensities increased with the deposition of Ag, and the position of the Raman signal remained the same. This indicates that there was an interaction between Ag and TiO2 that affected the Raman resonance of TiO2.25,26 This observation shows that the deposition of Ag on TiO2 does not cause any phase transition, but may bring about an electronic environment change in the surroundings.19,22

The XPS spectra of TiO2, Ag@TiO2, Au@TiO2, and Au–Ag@TiO2 were recorded in order to identify the chemical states of the Ti, O, Au, and Ag elements and are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows the Ti 2p spectra of the samples, in which two peaks are observed at 453.2 and 459.1 eV corresponding to the binding energies of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 core levels, respectively, due to the presence of the Ti(IV) state.27 After the deposition of Au and Ag nanoparticles, it is observed that the Ti 2p peak was slightly shifted to lower binding energies due to its surrounding chemical environment.28Fig. 5b shows the O 1s spectra of TiO2, Ag@TiO2, Au@TiO2, and Au–Ag@TiO2. The binding energy of the O 1s state of the samples was located at 531 eV, which was assigned to the bulk oxides (O2−) in the P25 lattice. The O 1s state is slightly shifted to higher binding energies with the addition of Au or Ag, indicating an increase in electron density around the O atoms due to the interaction of the residue precursor with TiO2.17 The observed slight shift in the Ti 2p and O 1s core level spectra of the Au75:Ag25 sample is due to deposition of the bimetal (Au and Ag), thus influencing the surface properties of TiO2. Whereas the mono metal (Au and Ag) deposition on TiO2 does not significantly influence the surface properties. The Au 4f spectra of the Au@TiO2 and Au–Ag@TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 5c. The binding energies are 83.8 and 87.7 eV, respectively, which suggests that Au is in the metallic state. The binding energies found for the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 levels are 368.5 and 374.5 eV, respectively (Fig. 5d), with a peak separation of 6 eV due to metallic silver. Hence, the XPS analysis provides support for the existence of elements such as Ti, O, Au, and Ag in the nanocomposite materials.

The optical absorption properties of TiO2, Ag/TiO2, Au/TiO2, and Au–Ag@TiO2 were studied by recording the UV-visible absorption spectra, which are shown in Fig. 6a. The bare TiO2 nanoparticles did not show any absorption in the visible light region. The deposition of the bimetallic Au–Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 leads to a prominent increase in the absorbance in the visible region. An additional peak in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was also observed with the incorporation of Au and Ag. The maximum absorption values for Ag@TiO2 and Au@TiO2 were observed at 444 and 523 nm, respectively, due to the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Au and Ag nanoparticles. For various Au–Ag compositions in TiO2:Au25:Ag75, Au50:Ag50, and Au75:Ag25, the SPR band was observed in the 477–524 nm region (Fig. 6b). When the Au content was increased in the nanocomposite, it can be seen that there was a red-shift in the visible absorption edge of the nanocomposite. The deposition of Au and Ag nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 significantly influenced visible light absorption. The enhancement of absorption in the visible region was due to the SPR band, which arouse by the collective oscillation of electrons in the noble metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) stimulated by optical excitation.29 It was reported that the interfacial chemical interaction and charge transfer between the noble metal particles and the matrix will influence the free electron density and consequently affect the SPR frequency.30,31

(c) Plots of (αhν)2vs. hν obtained for Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposites with different compositions of Au–Ag. 
One of the main objectives of incorporating Au and Ag nanoparticles into TiO2 was to reduce the band gap energy (Ebg) of TiO2, with the aim of increasing the absorption in the visible region. Hence, the determination of the Ebg values of the Au/TiO2, Ag/TiO2, and Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposites was very important. The Ebg values were calculated using the well-known Tauc's plot method.25 The Ebg values of the nanocomposites with various Au or Ag contents were calculated, and the corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 6c. It is observed that the Ebg value of TiO2 (3.27 eV) showed a gradual decrease with the addition of Au and Ag, with values of 3.23, 3.19, 3.17, 3.11, and 3.21 eV for the Au–Ag nanoparticles at Au0:Ag100, Au25:Ag75, Au50:Ag50, Au75:Ag25, and Au100:Ag0, respectively. Remarkable reductions in the Ebg value were observed when Au and Ag nanoparticles were added to TiO2. This was because the free electron properties were exhibited with a downward shift in the conduction band and upward shift in the valence band, which then led to a decrease in the Ebg value.32,33
Understanding the charge recombination process of a photoanode material is crucial because it can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC. TiO2 will absorb incident photons with sufficient energy equal to or higher than the band-gap energy. This will produce photo-induced charge carriers (h+⋯e−), and the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes will release energy in the form of photoluminescence. Hence, a lower PL intensity indicates less charge recombination. TiO2 showed a broad and high PL intensity at around 580 nm due to the high photo-induced charge carrier recombination; whereas the PL intensity was minimized upon the addition of Au and Ag on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 7). This was mainly attributed to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the Au–Ag/TiO2 interface, which acted as an electron sink to efficiently prevent the electron–hole recombination process.34 The Au–Ag@TiO2 with an Au–Ag ratio of 75:25 showed the lowest PL emission intensity, which indicated the least electron–hole recombination compared to the other Au–Ag ratios.

The TiO2/Au100:Ag0 and TiO2/Au75:Ag25 systems were examined in a femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption experiment, by subjecting the samples to 400 nm laser pulse excitation. The transient spectra of Au nanoparticles are included for comparison. No transient signal was detected from pure TiO2 at the current excitation energy due to its wide band gap which can only be efficiently excited at ≤360 nm. As mentioned in the Experimental section, the pump pulse was attenuated to ∼150–200 nJ in order to avoid multiphoton excitation.

Fig. 8 shows the spectra of the three systems during the initial period of 450 fs after excitation. The transient spectra of Au show positive absorbance wings around the bleach band centered at ∼530 nm. The two photoinduced absorbance bands are the results of the change in the dielectric constant and the increase in the electron temperature of Au which result in broadening of the SPR band.35,36 The bleach band at 530 nm represents the temporal change in the SPR peak of Au. For the TiO2/Au:Ag nanocomposites, there is a clear shift of ∼50 nm, and the bleach band appears at 580 nm. This shift is indicative of incorporating the noble metal nanoparticles into TiO2. The bleach band in the three systems show a buildup of intensity with a slight red-shift during the first 450 fs (see Fig. 8 and Table 1) which is due to the electron–electron interaction on the surface of the metal.

More insight into the recovery dynamics of the bleach band in the three systems is shown in the temporal profiles in Fig. 9, and the data are summarized in Table 1. The first ps time constant (τ1 in Table 1) represents the electron–phonon interaction. The time constant is 2.38 ps for Au and gets longer in the TiO2 nanocomposites, being 4.02 ps for TiO2/Au100:Ag0 and 6.14 ps for TiO2/Au75:Ag25. The elongation in time indicates better electron–hole separation that is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between TiO2 and the noble metal(s) which acts as an electron sink.34 The longer separation time in the case of TiO2/Au75:Ag25 is consistent with its lowest PL emission intensity (Fig. 7). A longer time constant (τ2 in Table 1) was observed in all the samples, which represents the last stage of bleach recovery that is due to phonon–phonon interaction.

The photovoltaic performances of the Au–Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite-modified photoanode-based DSSCs with different Au–Ag ratios were evaluated under simulated solar AM 1.5G irradiation. Their obtained photocurrent densities and photovoltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 10a, and their evaluated photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. It can be observed from the J–V curve of Au–Ag@TiO2 that there was a significant boost in the short-circuit current up to 23.5 mA cm−2 compared to the TiO2 (5.83 mA cm−2), Ag/TiO2 (7.07 mA cm−2), and Au/TiO2 (14.11 mA cm−2)-based DSSCs. The value of the Au–Ag@TiO2 DSSC (η = 7.33%) was 230%, 160%, and 72% higher than those of the DSSCs based on pure TiO2 (η = 2.22%), Ag/TiO2 (η = 2.81%), and Au/TiO2 (η = 4.26%), respectively. The metal-modified photoanode displayed higher efficiency than the unmodified TiO2, indicating enhanced photovoltaic performance due to the presence of plasmonic metal nanoparticles. The low efficiency of the TiO2-based DSSC was due to its insufficient absorption of visible light. The significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite-modified photoanode-based DSSC is due to the synergetic effect and surface plasmon resonance effect of Au and Ag. The deposition of Au and Ag onto the TiO2 resulted in a change in the Fermi energy level. A large number of electrons accumulated over on the surface of the Ag nanoparticles due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. The accumulation of these electrons on the Au and Ag nanoparticles shifted the position of the Fermi level closer to the conduction band of TiO2.37 The excited electrons in the Ag nanoparticles transferred to the conduction band of TiO2 due to the SPR effect and were collected by the current collector (ITO), thus improving the photocurrent under irradiation in the visible region.38 In addition, the significant improvement in absorption in the visible region would also enhance the photovoltaic performance. The improved photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect exhibited by the bimetallic nanoparticles with TiO2, the effective interfacial charge transfer between the bimetallic nanoparticles and TiO2, and hence the minimized photo-generated electron–hole recombination process.

The optimization of the Au–Ag ratio on TiO2 is essential from the economic and high-performance perspectives for a DSSC. From the J–V curves, it was observed that the optimum ratio for Au–Ag is 75:25 wt%, as compared to 25:75 and 50:50 wt% ratios. The enhanced photovoltaic performance may have been due to the plasmonic effect and rapid interfacial charge transfer that arose from the Au and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2. When the Au–Ag wt% ratio on the TiO2 surface was increased beyond 75:25, it showed a decrease in the conversion efficiency to 4.26%. The observed results clearly revealed that the conversion efficiency of a DSSC increased with an increase in the Au content of the photoanode until it reached a maximum of 75 wt%. Then, a further increase in the Au content in the bimetal nanocomposite eventually led to a decrease in the conversion efficiency (Fig. 10a and Table 2). This was mainly due to a decrease in the adsorption edge and an increase in the band gap after reaching a value of 75% Au in the bimetal nanocomposite.
The photovoltaic performance of this present Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite-modified photoanode was compared with those of the few previously reported Au- and Ag-deposited TiO2 plasmonic photoanode-based DSSCs, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Various methods were reported for the fabrication of Ag– and Au–TiO2 nanocomposite photoanodes for the DSSC application.14,17,18,32,39–41 The conversion efficiency achieved by the Ag–TiO2 nanocomposite photoanode is around 5%, whereas Au–TiO2 gave an efficiency of around 6%. In another report, deposition of the bimetallic Au–Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 was also carried out by Xu et al.14 The fabrication of Au–Ag alloy popcorn nanoparticles is through a two-step synthesis method. The Au–Ag alloy was first prepared before being added into TiO2 paste and finally fabricated as a photoanode. It showed that by introducing the Au–Ag alloy into TiO2, the conversion efficiency improved from 5.26% to 6.09%. The final enhancement of efficiency, 7.85%, was achieved after modifying the counter electrode by a scattering layer. Very recently, Yu et al.20 reported on TiO2/Ag/Au incorporation with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using DNA as a biological template and used them as photoanodes in DSSCs. The Ag and Au nanoparticles were reduced and absorbed onto the SWNT@DNA complexes through a UV-C irradiation method. After integrating the nanocomposite into the commercial TiO2 paste using the stirring and sonication method, it showed that the conversion efficiency increases from 6.8% to 8.3%. An Au–TiO2–Ag thin film was also prepared and used as a photoanode by Wang et al. The photoanode was prepared by immersing the TiO2 film prepared by electrospinning into the Ag and Au precursors and followed by the reduction of the metal through UV photoreduction. The Au and Ag doped TiO2 film was immersed into tetrabutyl titanate solution to protect Au and Ag particles before calcinating it at 450 °C for 30 min. The efficiency achieved was 7.51% after introduction of Au and Ag compared with 6.23% for a pure TiO2 electrode. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explored the co-deposition of Au and Ag nanoparticles on TiO2 as a photoanode for a DSSC by a single step method. Our study based on the Au–Ag@TiO2 photoanode is totally different from the previous report.14,20,21 Since, we have employed a simple one-step chemical reduction approach for the deposition of Au–Ag on the TiO2 surface and the nanocomposite showed tunable SPR properties. This significantly enhanced overall efficiency to 7.33%, which is ∼230% higher than the bare TiO2 based DSSC. Even though the addition of Ag and Au may increase the total cost of the DSSC photoanode, significant improvements have been achieved upon the modification of the photoanode with Au and Ag metals. Hence, the vast improvement in the efficiency of the DSSC outweighs the cost induced by the metals.

The interfacial charge transfer process within the fabricated DSSC with the Au–Ag@TiO2 photoanode and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in the frequency range between 0.01 Hz and 100 KHz with 10 mV amplitude and 0.7 V applied potential. 0.7 V has been used in this study because all the Au@TiO2 based DSSCs have the Voc value of around 0.7 V and are shown in Fig. 10(b and c). Two typical semicircles are observed in Nyquist plots, the small semicircle in the high frequency ranges and the large semicircle in the low frequency ranges correspond to the resistances of the Pt/electrolyte interface and the electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interface, respectively. The small semicircle is fitted to a charge-transfer resistance (Rct2) and constant phase, while the large semicircle is fitted to a transfer resistance (Rct2) and constant phase. As Rct2 is not affected by the use of TiO2 based materials, we focused on the variations in Rct1 (Fig. 10b). The intersection of the high-frequency semicircle at the real axis represents the equivalent series resistance of the device (Rs); the semicircle in the middle frequency region between 1 and 1000 Hz represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) throughout the semiconductor and at the semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interfaces.42,43 The Rs values varied because different Au and Ag ratios were used in the photoanodes. The calculated Rs values for Au0:Ag0, Au0:Ag100, Au25:Ag75, Au50:Ag50, Au75:Ag25, and Au100:Ag0 were 18.13, 13.70, 13.38, 16.60, and 15.20 and 15.04 Ω, respectively; and the Rct1 values were 48.60, 72.74, 60.01, 58.47, 52.47, and 43.95 respectively. An increase in the Rct1 value of the Au–Ag@TiO2-based photoanode was observed with an increase in the Ag content. Thus, the photoanode that contained a high amount of Ag had a higher Rct1 value, which corresponded to an ineffective electron transfer process between the photoanode and electrolyte interface. The changes in Rs and Rct can mainly be attributed to the changes in the Au–Ag content in the photoanode, which contributed the most to the internal impedance. The decreases in Rs and Rct1 with an increase in the Au content were due to the high conductivity and catalytic activity of the Au in the nanocomposite. As demonstrated in the Nyquist plot, both the real (Z′) and imaginary (Z′′) parts of the total impedance, as well as the Rct1 value, increased in the order Au/TiO2 < TiO2 < Au–Ag@TiO2 < Ag/TiO2, which showed the crucial effect of Au and Ag incorporation on the charge transport. The Rs value also decreased with the increasing amount of Au. Therefore, the origin of the higher Jsc in the Au–Ag@TiO2 is expected to have arisen from Rs, Rct1, and the charge transport dynamics determined by the electron lifetime (τn). From the Bode phase plots (Fig. 10c), the frequency was apparently shifted to the lower frequency region with an increase in the amount of Ag. The maximum frequencies (ωmax) in the middle frequency regions of the Bode plots for TiO2, Au/TiO2, Ag/TiO2 and Au–Ag@TiO2 were 398.11, 1000, 501.17 and 630.57 Hz respectively. Since ωmax is inversely associated with the electron lifetime τn = 1/(2πf),44,45 a decrease in ωmax indicates a reduced rate for the charge-recombination process in the DSSC. Hence, electrons with longer τn values will survive the recombination, and are therefore characterized by the larger Rct1. However, the frequency was shifted to the higher frequency region with an increase in the amount of Au, which indicated that a higher charge-recombination occurred in the nanocomposite. The higher charge-recombination rate had a negative effect on the overall charge collection efficiency. However, this effect was offset by the significant enhancement in Jsc values with the increasing amount of Au in the bimetallic nanocomposite.
The operation principle of the DSSC based on the Ag@TiO2-modified photoelectrode under illumination is shown in Fig. 11. During light irradiation, the dye absorbs incident light and promotes electrons to the excited state. An excited electron is injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The dye is then oxidized by receiving an electron from the electrolyte through the redox system, and is ready to be used again. The electrolyte itself will regenerate via the platinum counter-electrode by an electron passing through the external circuit. In our study, the metal deposited onto the TiO2 surface could be used as a scattering element for plasmonic scattering to trap the light and was near-field coupled with the dye molecules.46 This will eventually improve the optical absorption of the dye, resulting in a significant enhancement of the photocurrent (Fig. 11). Whenever the TiO2 comes into contact with the metal, both will undergo a Fermi level equilibration to each other, resulting in the formation of a Schottky barrier and thus leading to large numbers of electrons being accumulated at the surface of the metal nanoparticles. This accumulation of electrons on the Ag nanoparticles will shift the position of the Fermi level closer to the conduction band of TiO2.47 The Schottky barrier formed between the metal nanoparticles and TiO2 helps the electrons to flow from the metal to the TiO2 conduction band via a rapid interfacial charge transfer process, where they are collected by the current collector (ITO), which improves photocurrent generation under irradiation.38 Once the electrons are transferred to the conduction band of TiO2, the photo-excited electrons from the dye, N719, will start to accumulate on the metal surface again. Furthermore, the formation of the Schottky barrier at the metal/TiO2 interface, which can act as an electron sink, will also help to prevent the electron–hole recombination process.34

4. Summary
In summary, a simple approach was shown to co-deposit Au and Ag nanoparticles in the preparation of TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposites via a chemical reduction method to fabricate novel photoanodes for DSSCs. The DSSC fabricated using the Au–Ag@TiO2-modified photoanode showed an enhanced solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 7.33% and a ∼230% improvement compared to the photoanode of a DSSC composed of unmodified TiO2 (2.22%) under simulated solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 with AM 1.5G. The Ag/TiO2 and Au/TiO2-modified photoanodes showed 26% and 92% efficiency enhancements compared to that of the TiO2 unmodified photoanode. These significant improvements were mainly due to the synergistic effect shown by the co-deposition of plasmonic Au and Ag on the TiO2 surface. The metal nanoparticles could enhance visible light absorption due the light harvesting properties in the visible region as a result of the surface plasmon effect. Moreover, these metal nanoparticles also significantly promoted an interfacial charge transfer, which minimized the charge recombination process. The improved solar energy conversion efficiency of the Au–Ag@TiO2 nanocomposite makes it a promising alternative to conventional photoanode-based DSSCs.
