    , Accepted 30th October 2018First published on 1st November 2018AbstractFully phenylated C60Ph6 has never been synthesized in the past two decades largely due to steric effect and poor thermodynamic stability of the initial intermediate towards its isostructural penta-phenyl adduct (C60Ph5X) that has one central site intact. Herein, we report a kinetic management strategy using nitrobenzene that can efficiently alleviate the steric effect in the substitution reaction of C60Cl6 to synthesize C60Ph6. As revealed by X-ray crystallography, the molecule of C60Ph6, in stark contrast to its isostructural C60Ph5Cl with the last chlorine intact, shows a favorable geometrical structure and molecular stacking for electron transport. Furthermore, C60Ph6 shows high LUMO energy of −3.51 eV (0.4 eV higher than that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), which is promising high open-circuit voltage for organic solar cells. The merits of both molecular packing and electrochemical property of C60Ph6 lead to high open-circuit voltage of 1.04 V for the OSC device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The present C60Ph6 exemplifies a novel class of electronic acceptors with fully aromatized groups on a fullerene cage.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have become promising renewable energy sources as they exhibit light weight, low temperature solution processing, and large scale fabrication on flexible substrates at low cost.1–7 Substantial improvement in the performance of OSCs renders them promising photovoltaic technology.8–10 The state-of-the-art BHJ organic solar cells typically consist of a photoactive blend film of a polymer/small molecule donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor. Functional fullerenes are the most widely used electron acceptors in organic solar cells.11–19 The electron acceptor is involved in electron transfer between the photovoltaic layers and thus requires electron delocalization to some extent.20,21 Typically, properties of a fullerene acceptor can be modulated depending on the functional groups on the fullerene cage.11–13 Due to electron delocalization, aromatic group such as benzene with typical ‘cyclic aromatization’ is reasonably expected to be a promising functional group for improving electron transport. In addition, the LUMO levels of fullerene derivatives can be boosted by increasing the number of functional aromatic groups on the fullerene cage.11–13,22–26 To obtain an electronic acceptor suitable for OSCs with higher open circuit voltage, multi-functional fullerene derivatives have been designed by attaching a number of functional aromatic groups.11–13
Synthesis and application of multi-functional fullerenes in optoelectronic devices have been dominated by C60 derivatives with a hexa-addend pattern around one of the C60's 12 pentagons (five functional groups are in the pentagonal rim and one is in position-1, as shown in Fig. 1).27–30 In a substitution/addition reaction for multi-functionalization of C60 involving functional groups with medium size, the penta-substituted/addend structure with one central site (position-1 in Fig. 1b) intact is always the dominant product, as reported in the past two decades.27–38 In the reaction between C60Cl6 and benzene, for example, C60Ph5X (X = H or Cl) is the most favorable product because of the so-called steric effect at position-1.32–36,39–41 However, all the available evidence convincingly points to extremely poor photovoltaic performance of C60Ar5X, which is likely due to the intact X group.28–30

Accordingly, the synthesis of fully arylated fullerene derivatives is highly desired for efficient electron acceptance. Here, we have synthesized C60Ph6, in which the phenyl group is well-known as the most typical group with electron ‘cyclic delocalization’; we also show affordable synthesis of C60Ph6 depending on both thermodynamic and kinetic controllability in the reaction starting from C60Cl6, a useful synthon in fullerene chemistry (Scheme 1).32–36,40–43 Based on enhanced photovoltaic performance of P3HT:C60Ph6, a new class of fully aromatized electron acceptors with higher electrochemical stability and more favorable molecular stacking in the solid state was disclosed.

2. Experimental and methods
Materials
C60 (99.9%) was purchased from Puyang Yongxin Fullerene Co., Ltd. FeCl3 (anhydrous, 98%), benzene (anhydrous, 99.9%), and nitrobenzene (99%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar Co. P3HT was obtained from FEM Technology Co., Inc. and used as received. Other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used as received without further purification unless otherwise mentioned.
Measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to C2D2Cl4 (6.00 ppm) and 13C NMR spectra were referenced to C2D2Cl4 (73.78 ppm). HPLC was carried out in a LC-20AT Shimadzu instrument with a 5PBB column (10 × 250 mm). HPLC analysis was performed using toluene/chloroform (1/1, v/v) as the eluent at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1 and detected using 330 nm wavelength at room temperature. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Cary5000 UV-vis spectrometer. TGA/DSC curves were recorded on an SDT-Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer. Mass spectrum was recorded on a Bruker Esquire HCT mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source in the negative ion mode. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CHI-660C electrochemical workstation with Pt disk, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode (0.01 mol L−1 AgNO3, 0.09 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile) as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)/acetonitrile (5:1) solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
Synthesis of C60Ph6
To a standard Schlenk tube containing FeCl3 (81 mg, 0.5 mmol, 10 equiv.), a nitrobenzene (10 mL) solution of C60Cl6 (46 mg, 0.05 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in dry benzene (0.2 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 80 °C and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting solution was washed with water to remove FeCl3 and dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate. The crude product was separated to remove most byproducts by silica gel column chromatography using petroleum cyclohexane/toluene (2/1, v/v) as eluents. Further purification by preparative HPLC using a Cosmosil 5PBB column with an eluent of toluene/chloroform (1/1, v/v) afforded C60Ph6 with high purity. 1H NMR (500 MHz, C2D2Cl4): δ (ppm) 7.85–7.83 (m, 4H), 7.62 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 4H), 7.39–7.35 (m, 6H), 7.32–7.30 (m, 2H), 7.30–7.22 (m, 6H), 6.93–6.91 (m, 3H), 6.75–6.72 (m, 3H), 6.41 (t, J = 7.73 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, C2D2Cl4): δ (ppm) 159.11, 157.41, 154.02, 149.99, 148.70, 148.63, 148.45, 148.42, 148.17, 148.05, 147.74, 147.71, 147.36, 147.13, 147.00, 145.54, 145.31, 144.70, 144.53, 144.14, 144.10, 143.99, 143.88, 143.64, 142.97, 142.64, 142.48, 141.86, 139.92, 139.90, 130.11, 129.88, 129.00, 128.71, 128.64, 128.44, 128.17, 127.72, 127.68, 127.28, 125.99, 125.93, 125.58, 73.08, 63.77, 61.57, 57.79.

Device fabrication and characterization
Using P3HT as the donor and C60Ph6 or C60Ph5Cl as the acceptor, BHJ OSCs with the typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene acceptor/Ca/Al were fabricated. The ITO-coated glass substrate (10 Ω cm−2, purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd China) was sequentially cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, dried with N2 and further treated in a UV ozone chamber for 10 min. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm thickness) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083) was coated on the clean ITO glass by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s; then, the PEDOT:PSS layer was heated at 140 °C in air for 10 min. For obtaining the photoactive layer in a glove box, the blend solution of P3HT and fullerene derivatives in o-DCB (1:1 w/w, 34 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer at 600 rpm for 60 s. The wet blend film was then put into a glass Petri dish to undergo solvent annealing process at 150 °C for 10 min, forming a photoactive layer with a thickness of ca. 200 nm. Finally, the top electrode cathode consisting of ca. 20 nm Ca layer and ca. 100 nm Al layer was deposited on the polymer photoactive layer by thermal evaporation under vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The area of the device is ∼0.10 cm2 for each solar cell discussed in this study. All the devices were encapsulated by epoxy kits (general purpose, Sigma Aldrich) in a glove box. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under an illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 using a 300 W Xenon solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar Simulators). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Merlin lock-in amplifier coupled with CS260 monochromator and a 300 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated by a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The measurement of electron mobility was conducted in the dark by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method on a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source meter for the electron-only devices. Electron-only devices with the structure ITO/Cs2CO3/blend/Ca/Al were fabricated by spin-coating the active layer on ITO/Cs2CO3 substrates followed by deposition of Ca/Al on the cathode electrode. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Pico SPM instrument (Molecular Imaging Co., USA) operated in the tapping mode.
3. Results and discussion
As previously reported,32–36,40–43 the reaction of C60Cl6 and benzene mainly results in a penta-phenyl compound (C60Ph5Cl) rather than a hexa-phenyl derivative (C60Ph6). The extreme difficulty in synthesizing hexa-arylated fullerene derivatives is assumed to be the steric effect in position-1.44,45 Considering the typicality of C60Ph6 in the family of fully aromatized fullerene, we paid special attention to the possibility of preparation of C60Ph6 in a viable yield (Scheme 1). A series of reactions for optimizing the experimental parameters such as catalyst, reaction time, temperature and solvent were conducted starting with C60Cl6 and benzene in a molar ratio of 1:40. In the reaction with dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane (DCE) or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) as the solvent, no C60Ph6 was detected in the mixed products (Table S1, ESI†). With o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as the solvent, a trace amount of C60Ph6 could be detected in the product mixture dominated by penta-phenyl derivative C60Ph5Cl. By using nitrobenzene as solvent media, the yield of C60Ph6 improved dramatically. Together with optimized reaction conditions of catalyst, reaction time and temperature, C60Ph6 was the main product with yield higher than that of C60Ph5Cl. As exemplified in the reaction reported in entry 2 of Table 1, an isolated yield up to 16.2% for C60Ph6 can be obtained in the optimal conditions of the reagent molar ratio of 10:40:1 for FeCl3/benzene/C60Cl6, reaction temperature of 80 °C and reaction time of 40 min. When FeCl3 was replaced by AlCl3, the yield reduced to 3.1%. Similarly, changing the reaction time or reaction temperature while retaining other optimal conditions resulted in a decreased yield.

To probe the possible mechanism responsible for the formation of C60Ph6, DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program. Scheme 2(A)–(D) shows the relative energies of [C60Cl5]+, which are the carbocations initially derived from C60Cl6. Clearly, each of the carbocation A–D can be the starting intermediate of the reaction with benzene to produce C60PhCl5; sequential repetition of the production of carbocation and further reaction with benzene can finally result in C60Ph6 or end at C60Ph5Cl due to the steric effect at the central position-1 (the central position-1 is shown in Fig. 1b). In other words, C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl might be obtained from [C60Cl5]+ (A) and [C60Cl5]+ (B–D), respectively. Higher energy of [C60Cl5]+ (A) over that of the other starting intermediates of [C60Cl5]+ (B–D) explains the absence of C60Ph6 in previous literatures.32–36,40–43 With nitrobenzene as the solvent, the relative stability of [C60Cl5]+ (A) increases but that of [C60Cl5]+ (B–D) decreases, implying an increased yield of C60Ph6 in the presence of nitrobenzene. Rather than the thermodynamic stability, the kinetic factor may be more critical for the formation of C60Ph6. One of the evidence to support the kinetic factor comes from the fact that C60Ph6 can be produced with a low yield by further reaction of C60Ph5Cl and benzene under the optimal reaction conditions with nitrobenzene as the solvent. The mechanism of how nitrobenzene kinetically controls the reaction to detour the steric effect at position-1 is still open for future investigation.
 Scheme 2  Relative energies of [C60Cl5]+ (ΔE, in kcal mol−1) derived from C60Cl6. 
The structure of C60Ph6 was unambiguously determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis (Fig. 1) and confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and APCI-MS (Fig. S2–S7, ESI†). The crystals of C60Ph6 were obtained by solvent evaporation of its toluene solution. As expected, the six phenyl groups occupied the 1, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 positions. Similar to the observation in C60Cl6,46,47 steric hindrance causes distinct bond length increase in position-1. The Cn (cage)–CPh (phenyl group) bond lengths (in Å) are 1.565 (C1–CPh), 1.505 (C9–CPh), 1.534 (average of C6–CPh and C12–CPh) and 1.528 (average of C15–CPh and C18–CPh), where CPh is the representative carbon atom of the phenyl groups that is in contact with the fullerene cage. Accordingly, the steric effect at position-1 is distinctly evident, which is in accordance with the incomplete phenylation and extreme difficulty in synthesizing a fully phenylated fullerene so far.
The molecules of C60Ph6 are one-dimensionally stacked along the z-axis. As shown in Fig. 1c, there are two π–π interactions between adjacent C60 cages, where the distances are 3.182 and 3.362 Å. The molecular assembly of C60Ph6, rather than shuttlecock packing pattern in its isostructural C60Ar5H solid with the closest fullerene–fullerene contact of about 4.035 Å,37 is similar to that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, the most widely used electron acceptor in OSCs) with unusually short fullerene–fullerene contact (PCBM·o-DCB ca. 3.171 Å).48
For an OSC device, the photovoltaic performance is strongly influenced by the carrier mobility in the zones of donors or acceptors, whereas the electron mobility of fullerene acceptor zones profoundly relies on the interaction between fullerene cages. The high propensity of the isostructural penta-aryl adducts (C60Ar5X) to self-assemble into shuttle-like structures could lead to unfavorable fullerene–fullerene contact in the solid state and in turn low electron mobility, which limits the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSC devices involved.29,37 Indeed, the electron mobility values of C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl in the electron-only devices of ITO/Cs2CO3/blend/Ca/Al structure, evaluated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S9, ESI†) and the Mott–Gurney law,49 are 7.83 × 10−6 and 1.69 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility of C60Ph6 is approximately five times higher than that of C60Ph5Cl. In contrast to C60Ar5H, which has poor photovoltaic performance (with the maximum PCE of ∼1.5%),28–30 C60Ph6 with favorable fullerene–fullerene packing mode facilitates the electron mobility among C60Ph6 molecules to some extent and expectably leads to higher short-circuit current density than that of C60Ar5H-containing OSC devices.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the as-synthesized fullerene derivatives, OSCs with the typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of ITO/poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):fullerene derivative/Ca/Al were fabricated. The J–V curves of the devices fabricated with synthesized C60Ph6 or C60Ph5Cl as the electron acceptor are shown in Fig. 2a; the data of open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices are summarized in Table 2. As listed, both Jsc and FF data of the device with C60Ph6 as the electron acceptor are apparently higher than those of C60Ph5Cl-containing device, which is partially due to the favorable self-assembled pattern of C60Ph6 that improves the electron mobility among C60Ph6 molecules, thus facilitating increase in Jsc and FF.50 Importantly, the BHJ solar cell with C60Ph6 as the electron acceptor has Voc of 1.04 V, which is one of the highest values for a fullerene-based OSC reported so far.51 The other fullerene-based devices with Voc values higher than 1.04 V are achieved by replacing the widely used P3HT with poly[2,7-(9-di-octyl-fluorene)-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (APFO3),52 indenofluorene-containing copolymer (PIFTBT8) or a smaller molecule with A–D–A structure (DCAO3TF).53 As expected, Voc of the C60Ph6-based OSC can be further improved when P3HT is replaced by proper electron donors such as APFO3, PIFTBT8 or DCAO3TF. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of OSCs with P3HT:C60Ph6 or P3HT:C60Ph5Cl as the blend active layer are shown in Fig. 2b. In contrast to the almost baseline-like curve for the C60Ph5Cl-based device, the higher EQE value of the OSC device based on P3HT:C60Ph6 is consistent with its higher Jsc value.

To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the stark difference in the photovoltaic performance between C60Ph5Cl and C60Ph6, the absorption, electrochemical properties and thermal stability were investigated. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl in toluene solution at a concentration of 10−5 mol L−1. The characteristic spectrum of C60Ph6 or C60Ph5Cl with three absorption peaks ranging from 300 to 500 nm is similar to those previously observed for isostructural C60Ph5H, thus suggesting that the optical property is independent of the type of substituents but relies on the parent fullerene cage (C60) and the addition patterns. In comparison with the results for C60Ph5Cl, the slightly red shift in absorption peaks at 365, 405 and 480 nm for C60Ph6 facilitates the photovoltaic performance to some extent.

The electrochemical properties of C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl, as analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, are shown in Fig. 4. C60Ph6 exhibits three reversible reduction waves in the potential range from 0 to −2.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+, indicating its electrochemical stability at the tri-anion stage and possibly beyond. In contrast, isostructural C60Ph5Cl exhibits worse electrochemical stability.54 Analogous to the hydrogen radicals released from C60Ph5H,55 unstable chlorine radicals can be easily generated by C60Ph5Cl in negatively charged conditions. The half-wave potentials and LUMO levels, estimated from the onset reduction potentials (Eonred) and the equation LUMO = −e(Eonred + 4.71) (eV),56 are listed in Table 3 for both C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl. The LUMO energy level of C60Ph6 is estimated at −3.51 eV, which is distinctly higher by 0.24 eV than that of C60Ph5Cl (−3.75 eV) and by 0.40 eV relative to that of PCBM (−3.91 eV).57 Based on a previous report58 and our experimental data, C60Ph6 with a high LUMO energy level results in the highest open-circuit voltage (1.04 V) for OSCs based on the widely used polymer donor P3HT. The poor electrochemical properties of C60Ph5Cl could be the main reason for the poor photovoltaic performance of incompletely phenylated C60Ph5Cl.

In addition, C60Ph6 exhibits good thermal stability with initial decomposition temperatures (Td) of 460–470 °C (Fig. S8, ESI†). The high thermal stability of C60Ph6 may be ascribed to the steric compression of phenyl groups, which can slow down the vibration of carbon–carbon bonds connected to C60 and thus may contribute to a higher lifetime of OSCs involved.
4. Conclusions
We have overcome the extreme difficulty in synthesizing fully phenylated C60 from the useful synthon C60Cl6. Under optimized reaction conditions with nitrobenzene as the solvent, a moderate yield of C60Ph6 has been achieved, breaking the rule of incompletely phenylated C60Ph5Cl being the dominant product. Geometrical structures and molecular packing of this typical fully aromatic derivative of C60 was unambiguously demonstrated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Due to the favorable self-assembled pattern and higher LUMO level of C60Ph6, Voc and best PCE of BHJ OSCs with C60Ph6 as the acceptor reached 1.04 V and 3.07%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of its isostructural fullerene derivatives C60Ph5X (X = Cl or H). Based on spectrometric, electrochemical and thermal properties as well as the structural data for both C60Ph6 and C60Ph5Cl, the poor photovoltaic performance of C60Ph5Cl can be ascribed to the unfavorable electrochemical stability and molecular packing in the solid state. The present study facilitates understanding of the relationship between structures and properties for a fullerene electron acceptor and suggests that fully arylated fullerene (rather than incomplete aromatization) is promising as an efficient electron acceptor for OSCs and possibly electron transport for perovskite solar cells. It is highly expectable to alter larger fullerene cages or more aromatic groups for developing efficient electron acceptors of fully aryl substituted fullerenes in the near future.
