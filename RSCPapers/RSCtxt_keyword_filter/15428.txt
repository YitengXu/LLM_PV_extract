    , Accepted 11th November 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractThe design and development of innovative heterostructures with multifunctional properties are technically very important for efficient practical energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrogen-doped carbon (N–C) layer sandwiched between MnCo2O4 and MnO2 (MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2) as a core@sandwich@shell type heterostructure on Ni foam. The thin layer of sandwiched N–C acts as a “superhighway” for good electron/ion transport and protects the MnCo2O4 and MnO2 from destructive morphological changes during repeated charge–discharge processes. The MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material is well characterized by standard techniques, and its energy storage performance is studied in a three-electrode system and solid-state asymmetric capacitor device. The resultant electrochemical performance is compared with those of MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C. The MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode exhibits an excellent areal/gravimetric capacity of 0.75 mA h cm−2/312 mA h g−1 at 3 mA cm−2 with ca. 89.6% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. A solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 as a cathode and nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel as an anode exhibits a high energy density of 68.2 W h kg−1 at 749.2 W kg−1 power density without compromising long cycle life (ca. 91.1% retention after 10000 cycles). The highly efficient energy storage performance of this new class of heterostructures synthesized with earth-abundant materials enables commercial applications.
1. Introduction
The development of environmentally friendly, economically viable, and high-capacity electrical energy storage materials has attracted substantial interest in modern electronics and electric vehicles. Energy production and storage from renewable sources (wind, solar, biomass, rivers, etc.) has yet to be improved to the point of safe, clean, and efficient intermittent energy supply to portable energy consumers.1–3 Therefore, high energy and power density devices are required for energy storage as well as for efficient utilization. Supercapacitors (SCs), being one of the most promising, practically safe, and environment friendly energy-storage devices, have attracted enormous amounts of attention in current energy research because of their high-power density (>10 kW kg−1), energy density (≤10 W h kg−1), instantaneous charge–discharge capacity, superior life cycle (>105 cycles), and improved resilience to temperature with nearly no maintenance requirement.4–6 However, SCs still suffer from a lack of energy density compared to the consumer needs. Principally, SCs work through electron migration and accumulation. According to the eminent energy storage mechanism, SCs are classified into two broad classes: electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), which commonly use carbon-based materials, and faradaic capacitors (FDCs), which use metal hydroxide/oxide/sulfide and conducting polymer-based materials. In general, EDLCs possess low energy density, high power density, and a long cycle life, while FDCs possess high energy density with low power density and a low cycle life due to low conductivity.7 In order to overcome these drawbacks and increase the energy density, power density, and cycle life of faradaic-based SCs, several methods have been proposed: (i) choosing an appropriate carbon and metal oxide material composite; (ii) effective morphological design of the electrode materials, such as 1D, 2D, and 3D (nanowires, nanosheets, micro-flowers, etc.); (iii) making core@shell type materials; (iv) widening of the operating potential window by choosing appropriate electrode materials in asymmetric supercapacitors; and (v) the selection of a perfect electrode–electrolyte couple. Among these methods, core@shell type materials have attracted immense attention in recent days due to the unique morphological architecture, and controlled shapes and sizes of the core and shell, which is beneficial for the design and fabrication of novel electrode materials. The rational reasons behind the core–shell materials improving the efficiency of the materials are: (I) the core–shell nanomaterials provide free buffer space with an open network between the core and shell in nanowire structures, which can be efficiently utilized by shortening the charge/ion diffusion path length, leading to a higher rate of migration of charge/ions to the surface of the active electrode for high capability and efficiency; (II) the synergistic effect of the core and shell intensifies the properties of individual components on faradaic rich sites for enhancing the efficiency of the materials and it also helps to preserve the core–shell structural integrity during the charge–discharge process; (III) both the core and the shell undergo facile electrochemical reactions with the electrolyte. Hence, this substantially improves the electrochemical properties.8,9
Three-dimensional hierarchical core@shell materials exhibit admirable properties. For example, binary transition metal oxides, particularly MCo2O4 (M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) with a 3D structure, possess a low band gap and variable oxidation states, thereby resulting in excellent electrical conductivity. However, these materials also suffer from several drawbacks such as low specific capacitance and a low operating potential window for practical applications.10 Among these materials, MnCo2O4 is the most promising due to its multiple oxidation states and the enhancement of its electrochemical properties, which is made possible with a precise design of the hierarchical morphology with a core@shell@shell configuration. The core@shell materials provide unique electrochemical properties for enhancing the efficiency of the overall electroactive material. N-Doped carbon is known to be a highly conductive material, and it acts as a superhighway network for the easy transport of electrons and electrolyte ions.11,12 Developing a core@shell material with N-doped carbon as an intermediate layer enhances the overall electrical conductivity and also improves the cycling stability of the material. Moreover, the N-doped intermediate carbon allows for the reversible electrostatic accumulation of the charged species and offers a suitable environment for the migration of charge/ions throughout the entire electrode as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interface.13,14 Typically, binary metal oxides uniquely act as both the “core material” and the “shell material” for the desired energy storage devices. Among the manganese-based composite oxides, MnO2-based composite materials suffer from low electrical conductivity caused by the undesirable aggregation of MnO2 nanoflakes. Therefore, many composite materials have been synthesized in order to overcome the drawbacks of MnO2-based materials. For example, Zhao et al. synthesized a MnO2/graphene/nickel foam composite for supercapacitors, which exhibit a specific capacitance of ca. 476 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.15 Li et al. presented sponge-like NiCo2O4/MnO2 ultrathin nanoflakes, which exhibit a high specific capacitance of ca. 935 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an ultra-long cycling stability of ca. 103.1% in 25000 cycles.16 Bao et al. synthesized a flexible Zn2SnO4/MnO2 core@shell nanocable-carbon microfiber hybrid composite electrode, which shows a specific capacitance of ca. 642.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.17 These results suggest that the rational design of composites is possibly beneficial toward the sufficient utilization of the active materials or the improvement of electrical conductivity for boosting the electrochemical performance. However, due to a lack of structural design, many reported core@shell materials possess low conductivity, resulting in loss of their morphology during repeated charge–discharge processes. Thus, a core@shell with sandwiched N–C “superhighway” material can enhance conductivity several fold, and it allows the core and shell structures to be retained. Moreover, it enhances the potential window of the electrode material due to the synergistic effect of the core, sandwiched N–C, and shell material. Hence, this motivated us to design and develop a core@shell material sandwiched with N–C (core@sandwich@shell), ensuring feasibility for further use in practical application.18,19
In this study, binder-free N–C sandwiched hierarchical MnCo2O4 and MnO2 core@sandwich@shell materials have been successfully synthesized and applied for supercapacitor applications. The direct growth of electroactive materials on conductive substrates aids the effective usage of the overall electrode by avoiding the usage of polymer binders and conductive additives, unlike the traditional method of making electrodes. The spinel 1D MnCo2O4 nanowire grown on nickel foam with pointing tips serves as the perfect scaffold for the coating of N-doped carbon. Finally, the decoration of the MnO2 nanoflakes leads to hierarchical complex architectures with improved surface areas for the rapid exchange of electrons and electrolyte ions, both between the core and shell and at the electrode–electrolyte interface. To the best of our knowledge, hybrid assemblies with controlled complex hierarchical structures obtained from multicomponent transition metal oxides such as MnCo2O4 and MnO2 sandwiched with N-doped carbon have not yet been reported. This motivated us to carry out the present work. The developed hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sandwich-type nanostructure by controlling the hetero-growth process of the multicomponent transition metal compound exhibited excellent charge storage performance in a three-electrode setup as well as in a real asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (≥97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), urea (≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium fluoride (98.0%, Alfa Aesar), dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide solution (28.0–30.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), potassium permanganate (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), Tris–HCl buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), and absolute ethanol anhydrous (99.9%, Daejung) were all used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of the 1D MnCo2O4 nanowires on Ni foam
One-dimensional MnCo2O4 nanowires were grown on pure Ni foam (a piece of Ni foam (2 cm × 4 cm) pretreated with 3 M HCl, DI water, absolute ethanol, and acetone under sonication in order to remove the oxidized layer as well as water soluble and other organic impurities) via a hydrothermal route. In a typical hydrothermal process, manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (0.5 mmol), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (1 mmol), urea (3 mmol), and ammonium fluoride (1 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred for ca. 45 min at room temperature. Then, the contents were transferred into an 80 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, containing pretreated bare Ni foam and then the autoclave was heated in a conventional oven and kept at 120 °C for 6 h. After the completion of the reaction, it was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. Next, the Ni foam with deposited precursor material was washed with water and ethanol several times and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 8 h. Finally, it was calcined in a tube furnace (Lenton®) at 350 °C for 3 h, with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere in order to obtain 1D MnCo2O4 nanowires.
2.3 Synthesis of the 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires on Ni foam
Dopamine hydrochloride (10 mg in 50 mL of Tris–HCl buffer (pH = 8.5)) solution was prepared with stirring for ca. 20 min at room temperature. Then, 0.75 mL of ammonium hydroxide solution was added to it and stirring was continued for another 30 min. Afterward, 1D MnCo2O4-coated Ni foam was immersed in the solution for ca. 24 h. The Ni foam was then washed with water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C for 8 h. Finally, it was calcined in a tube furnace (Lenton®) at 600 °C for 3 h (heating rate is 2 °C min−1) under an argon atmosphere in order to obtain 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires grown on Ni foam.
2.4 Synthesis of the hierarchical core@sandwich@shell type MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires on Ni foam
In a final preparation, the MnO2 shell was coated on the 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires. In detail, 50 mL of 0.02 M concentration of potassium permanganate solution was prepared and transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave containing MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires grown on Ni foam and heated at 150 °C for 2 h. After that, it was cooled naturally to room temperature. It was then washed with ethanol and water several times and dried in an oven overnight in order to obtain the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material.
2.5 Synthesis of the nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogel (NGH, negative electrode)
Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized according to the well-established modified Hummers' method, previously reported elsewhere.20 For NGH synthesis, 50 mg of GO was dispersed in 50 mL of DI water, and then 5 mmol of urea was added to it and stirred for an hour. The resultant solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. After the completion of the reaction, the contents were cooled to room temperature. The obtained product was taken out by using tweezers and washed with water in order to remove the unreacted urea. It was then dialyzed and lyophilized to get the final NGH material.
2.6 Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all of the samples were recorded in the 2θ range of 10–80° at 40 mA and 40 kV using Rigaku diffractometry, Japan, the scan rate was maintained at 2° min−1 and copper (Cu-Kα; λ = 1.5406 Å) was used as the target material. The morphological images of the samples were studied using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The FE-SEM and EDAX (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, which provides information on the chemical composition and ratio of contributing elements of the sample) analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss, SUPRA 40 VP field-emission scanning electron microscope, Germany, operating at 15 kV, and the elemental composition of the samples was analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray analysis facility coupled with a FE-SEM instrument installed at the Center for University-Wide Research Facilities (CURF), Chonbuk National University. For the FE-SEM studies, the material grown on Ni foam was stuck on conducting carbon tape, and platinum sputtering was carried out for ca. 100 s. The TEM and HR-TEM (high resolution-TEM) images were recorded by a Hitachi H-7650 electron microscope, Japan, operating at 200 kV. The crystalline nature of the samples was analyzed using selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and color mapping was performed with the same TEM instrument. The surface composition of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample was analyzed by using a Theta Probe AR-XPS System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK, installed at the Busan center of KBSI, where Al Kα was used as the X-ray source. Raman analysis of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 and MnCo2O4@N–C samples was performed using a Nanofinder 30, Tokyo instruments Co., Japan, in the wavenumber range of 200–2000 cm−1 (λ = 633 nm).
2.7 Electrochemical characterization
For the electrochemical measurements, in a three electrode system each of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 materials directly grown on Ni foam, having the mass loadings of ca. 1.8, 2.0, and 2.4 mg cm−2 respectively, is directly used as the working electrode, and platinum foil and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) respectively used as counter and reference electrodes. A freshly prepared 3.0 M KOH aqueous solution was used for electrochemical analysis. For negative electrode preparation, a mixture of NGH, carbon black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 was ground. Then N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was added in order to obtain the slurry. For homogeneity, the slurry was sonicated for ca. 30 min. Finally, the slurry was coated dropwise on Ni foam (1 cm × 1 cm) and dried at 60 °C for ca. 24 h in an oven. The electrochemical measurements (CV, GCD, and EIS) were carried out using a CHI 660D US electrochemical work station. The specific capacitances (Csp, F g−1) and specific capacities (Cs, mA h g−1) of the electrodes in a half-cell were calculated according to eqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)where ‘i’ is the current density (A), ‘t’ is the discharge time (s), ‘m’ is the mass loading on Ni foam (g), and ‘V’ is the potential window (V).  is the integral of the area under the discharge curve. The kinetics of the electrochemical reaction was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies at an open circuit voltage in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz using the same electrochemical work station.
In order to fabricate the solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device, MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 and NGH were employed as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, while cellulose paper was used as the separator and KOH/PVA gel as the solid electrolyte (in detail: 3 g KOH and 6 g polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were dissolved in 70 mL DI water, and then heated at 90 °C under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The electrodes and separator were soaked in the electrolyte for 10 min, assembled, and allowed to solidify at room temperature for 6 h). In ASC devices the mass of the positive and negative electrode materials was taken based on charge balance theory, i.e. q+ = q−. q+ = C+ × ΔV+ × m+(3) q− = C− × ΔV− × m−(4)where C+ and C− are the specific capacities of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, ΔV is the working potential window, and m+ and m− are the mass of the electroactive positive and negative electrodes, respectively. In order to maintain the mass balance in an ASC device, eqn (5) was employed: (5)
The charge balance mass ratio of NGH and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 was calculated and found to be ∼2.5. The cell capacity (Cc, mA h g−1), energy density (E, W h kg−1), and power density (P, W kg−1) of the hybrid ASC device were calculated using eqn (6)–(8): (6) (7) (8)where ‘M’ is the total electroactive mass of both cathode and anode electrodes (∼8.4 mg), respectively.2,4,13
3. Results and discussion
An effective hydrothermal approach was employed for the preparation of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 core@sandwich@shell nanowire materials. The schematic mechanism for the formation of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires is shown in Fig. 1. Ni foam has the typical morphology of a porous framework with a pore size of ca. 200–300 μm. Pure metallic Ni foam possesses high flexibility and conductivity, which makes the Ni foam a unique supporting backbone for the preferential growth of the MnCo2O4 nanowires. The growth of the MnCo2O4 nanowire takes “oriented attachment” and “self-assembly” processes.21–23 In the initial stage nitrate salts of manganese and cobalt are ionized to respective Mn2+ and Co2+ ions, and at elevated temperatures, urea undergoes decomposition and produces NH3 and CO2 in the aqueous solution. After achieving the optimum temperature (e.g. 120 °C), under high pressure hydrothermal conditions, NH3 slowly hydrolyses to release OH− ions into aqueous solution containing Mn2+ and Co2+ ions, leading to random nucleation of Mn(OH)HCO3 and Co(OH)HCO3 on the Ni foam; here, the Ni foam provides active nucleation centres in the supersaturated solution and controls the size of the nuclei by reducing the surface energy, which promotes the attachment and growth of the nanoparticles on the Ni foam uniformly.24 The size of the initially formed nuclei was controlled by the porous framework of the nickel foam, which decides the growth of Mn–Co LDH into one dimensional nanowires on Ni foam. Thus, the nanowire continuously grows from the nucleation site and crystallizes in the thermodynamically active stable wire-like networks perpendicular to the surface of the nickel foam. Here, ammonium fluoride acts as a structure directing agent, and it can promote the formation of 1D Mn–Co LDH nanowires by Ostwald ripening. At 350 °C, with a low heating rate (2 °C min−1), 1D Mn–Co LDH converted to produce MnCo2O4 in an argon atmosphere without disturbing its 1D nanowire structures. The possible reactions are as follows:2,25 (9) (10) (11)
 Fig. 1  Schematic mechanism for the formation of hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires. 
In the second step, N–C is coated on MnCo2O4 nanowires, and aqueous ammonia is used as the nitrogen source for the doping of nitrogen into the dopamine carbon shell. In the presence of ammonia, dopamine undergoes polymerization and forms a N–C thin layer uniformly on the surface of the 1D MnCo2O4 nanowire core. At 600 °C under an argon atmosphere, the thin layer of the dopamine coating leads to the formation of conducting N–C on the MnCo2O4 as 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires. In the final step, MnO2 is coated on theMnCo2O4@N–C nanowire, and the KMnO4 under high temperature (150 °C) dissociates to produce MnO2 nanoflakes, which can easily wrap around the 3D surface of the MnCo2O4@N–C and produces a hierarchical core@sandwich@shell type MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire architecture. To confirm the formation of the respective phase and structure at each step the as-synthesized materials were subjected to XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy analysis. The synthesized core@sandwich@shell materials possess several advantages in terms of electrochemical performance: (i) the MnCo2O4 core and MnO2 outer shell capacitive metal oxides connected by N–C make an ideal architecture for electron/ion migration because N–C is known to be a better “superhighway” channel for transferring charge species and ions between the crystalline core and shell, leading to better charge storage capability; (ii) the 2D MnO2 nanoflakes covered on the MnCo2O4@N–C possess high surface areas thereby providing a larger number of electroactive sites for faster faradaic redox reactions; (iii) the growth of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires is well decorated and immobilized on the Ni foam, allowing for complete utilization of the active electrode material by reducing the “dead volume” caused by binders and conductive additives.26–29 Therefore the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material is expected to show higher charge storage performance compared to the simple MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C.
First, the structural analysis and phase purity of the MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 samples were studied using powder XRD analysis, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2a. The XRD patterns of pure MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C show several prominent peaks at 2θ values of 18.52, 30.5, 35.99, 37.6, 41.66, 60.92, and 72.61°, which correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (440), and (620) planes of cubic MnCo2O4 (JCPDS file no. 23-1237), respectively. The intensity of the corresponding diffraction peaks is decreased due to the covered carbon shell, which could be possible due to the presence of an amorphous and thin layer of carbon (ca. 5 nm).8,30,31 The estimated crystallite sizes from the Debye–Scherrer formula of MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C are ca. 14.8 and 9.5 nm respectively, measured from the most intense peak. The XRD pattern of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample shows two types of reflections due to MnCo2O4 (JCPDS file no. 23-1237) and MnO2. The peaks at 2θ values of 12.75, 18.12, 28.84, 37.52, 49.81, and 69.71° correspond to the (110), (200), (310), (211), (411), and (541) planes of MnO2 (JCPDS no. 44-0141), respectively. Aside from that, there are three additional high intensity peaks in all of these samples at 2θ values of 44.2, 51.87, and 76.59°, corresponding to the Ni foam, which was used as the template for the growth of the electroactive materials.32 In order to know the porosity and specific surface area of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material, the powder material was collected from the Ni foam after ultrasonication and used for the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. For comparison, the specific surface areas of the MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C materials are also measured. The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 surface area was found to be ca. 193 m2 g−1, which is substantially higher (Fig. 2b) than that of MnCo2O4@N–C (ca. 88 m2 g−1) and MnCo2O4 (ca. 76 m2 g−1), and the corresponding sorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S1a and S1b.† The pore size distribution of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 was estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, and it was found to be in the range of 3–10 nm, which is suitable for the interaction of the electrolyte ions between the electrode and electrolyte (Fig. 2c).
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD analysis of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2, (b) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and (c) pore size distribution of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2. 
In order to identify the morphological features and elemental composition of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire sample, we have carried out both FE-SEM and EDAX analyses (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a–d show the FE-SEM images of Mn–Co LDH, MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire samples. The FE-SEM image of Mn–Co LDH shows a uniform 1D nanowire-like morphology with sharp pointing tips. The diameter at the middle of the Mn–Co LDH nanowires and length were measured to be ca. 95 ± 5 nm and ca. 3 μm, respectively. The calcination of Mn–Co LDH nanowires under an argon atmosphere at 350 °C leads to the formation of MnCo2O4 nanowires and allows them to retain their 1D nanowire morphology, which can permit faster electron transfer kinetics and enhance the faradaic reactions at or near the electrode surface. Fig. S2a and S2b† show the FE-SEM images of MnCo2O4 grown in binder free Ni foam under different magnifications calcined in an argon atmosphere. But when it was calcined under air atmosphere the nanowire structure is not retained (Fig. S2c†). The EDAX analysis of the MnCo2O4 nanowire (Fig. S3a†) shows the presence of manganese, cobalt, and oxygen, where the atomic percentage of cobalt is almost double that of manganese, which further indicates the formation of MnCo2O4. After the reaction with dopamine hydrochloride, followed by calcination at 600 °C under an argon atmosphere, the 1D MnCo2O4 nanowire core is well coated by a very thin layer of N–C carbon, resulting in the formation of MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell type nanowires, which is shown in Fig. 3c. After the coating of the N–C shell, the diameter of 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell slightly increases, and it is estimated to be ca. 100 ± 5 nm with uniformity in the shape and size of the nanowires. The thin layer of N–C provides a superhighway path for the migration and penetration of the ions/electrons through the core to the shell. On the other hand, the N-doped carbon material between the inner core and the outer shell metal oxides provides the charge balance scaffold to hold the material for long-term stability. It also helps to increase the active surface area of electrode materials in a given volume and fasten the charge transfer kinetics as well as the durability of the material for energy storage.33 The EDAX analysis (Fig. S3b†) confirms the presence of carbon and nitrogen along with cobalt and manganese in the same ratio as that in MnCo2O4. In the final step, the deposition of the MnO2 shell was carried out at 150 °C, and the uniformly interconnected dense porous ultrathin flakes of MnO2 can be seen on 1D MnCo2O4@N–C, (Fig. 3d), with the retention of its 1D morphology. At elevated temperatures (e.g. 150 °C), the KMnO4 gets reduced, and formed an ultrafine nanoflake-like morphology of MnO2, which apparently wraps around the surface of MnCo2O4@N–C, resulting in the formation of hierarchical core@sandwich@shell type MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire architectures. The EDAX spectra and color mapping of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire sample show the presence of manganese, cobalt, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (Fig. S4†). The atomic ratios of cobalt to manganese are estimated to be almost identical to the stoichiometric ratio of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2.

Further, in order to see the formation of core@sandwich@shell type MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires and to get the structure related information, we have carried out TEM and HR-TEM analyses. Fig. 4a, b and c show the TEM images of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 respectively, at the same magnification. The 1D nanowire morphology of the pure MnCo2O4 sample is well retained, even in the coatings of the N–C sandwich and MnO2 shell, without any structural change, but the diameter of the 1D MnCo2O4 nanowire core only increased from 95 ± 5 nm to 190 ± 5 nm after the coating of the N–C and MnO2 shells. The high magnification HRTEM image of MnCo2O4@N–C in Fig. S5a† confirms the uniform thin coating of the highly conductive N–C shell over the entire surface of the 1D MnCo2O4 core. The diameter of the 1D MnCo2O4@N–C core@sandwich nanowires was estimated to be ca. 100 ± 5 nm, and the nitrogen doped carbon shell thickness was found to be ca. 5 nm (Fig. S5b†). This clearly shows the solid interface/contact between the 1D MnCo2O4 and the N–C, and the N–C on the MnCo2O4 core facilitates fast electron transfer between the core and outer shell, and it increases the stability of the material, by reducing volume expansion during the charge–discharge process.34–36 An enlarged view of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire is shown in Fig. 4d, where the fine coating of the hierarchical flake-like hairy MnO2 outer shell on the backbone of the MnCo2O4@N–C core@sandwich nanowires (dark region) can clearly be seen. The perfect architecture of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material not only has a sophisticated morphology but is also expected to show more durability during the electrochemical studies than its counterparts. Fig. 4e shows the HR-TEM image of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire with a lattice spacing of ca. 0.37 and 0.28 nm, corresponding to the (211) and (310) planes of MnO2, respectively. The crystalline nature of the materials was studied using selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 4f). The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 shows a ring with a spot pattern, which confirms the polycrystalline nature of the materials. The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire shows diffraction rings corresponding to the (211), (111), (400), (521), (310), (541) and (440) planes of MnO2. Furthermore, the elemental color mapping of the final hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 confirms the presence of manganese, cobalt, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (Fig. 4g). Here, the cobalt and oxygen show as the prominent color in the core region, whereas the carbon and nitrogen show as a somewhat dim color at the middle, indicating the formation of N-doped carbon (N–C) in the intermediate shell. On the other hand, manganese shows the dark color throughout the structure, due to the constituent of the core as well as the shell. Fig. S6† shows the high magnification HRTEM images (Fig. S6a and S6b†), SAED pattern (Fig. S6c†), and elemental color mapping (Fig. S6d†) of the 1D MnCo2O4 nanowires. The HR-TEM image of the pure 1D MnCo2O4 sample shows a lattice spacing of ca. 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of MnCo2O4. The SAED pattern shows ring-like spots, confirming the crystalline nature of the compound. The 1D MnCo2O4 nanowire core shows diffraction rings corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of MnCo2O4. The elemental color mapping of 1D MnCo2O4 shows the prominent colors caused by manganese, cobalt, and oxygen, confirming that these elements are present in the material. Fig. S5† shows the high magnification HRTEM images (Fig. S5a and S5b†), SAED pattern (Fig. S5c†), and elemental color mapping (Fig. S5d†) of MnCo2O4@N–C. The HR-TEM image shows a lattice spacing of ca. 0.36 nm, corresponding to the (311) plane of MnCo2O4 in the MnCo2O4@N–C sample. The SAED pattern of MnCo2O4@N–C also shows a ring with a spot pattern, confirming the polycrystalline nature of the material. The 1D MnCo2O4@N–C nanowires show diffraction planes similar to those in the MnCo2O4 core with the absence of the (511) plane (Fig. S5†). The elemental color mappings of 1D MnCo2O4@N–C nanowires show the intense colors of manganese, cobalt, and oxygen elements in the core region and the faded colors of the nitrogen and carbon elements in the shell region (Fig. S5d†), confirming the formation of a N–C shell over the MnCo2O4 core.

In order to clarify the elemental composition and surface oxidation phenomena of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed, the results of which are shown in Fig. 5. The survey spectrum of hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 (Fig. 5a) shows the presence of manganese, cobalt, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The Mn 2p high-resolution deconvoluted spectrum shows peaks at 642.3 and 654.2 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of manganese, respectively (Fig. 5b). The spin–orbit coupling of each peak indicates the presence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ separated by a spin energy of 11.9 eV, similar to previously reported manganese-based materials.2,25 The presence of other satellite shakeup peaks further confirms the presence of Mn3+/4+ valences in the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 materials. Similarly, the Co 2p high-resolution spectrum shows peaks at 780.5 and 795.7 eV, corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of cobalt, respectively (Fig. 5c). The peak difference of 15.2 eV suggests the interaction between the spin–orbit doublets of two energy levels. The doublet splitting of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 as well as shakeup satellite peaks indicates the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ in MnCo2O4.37Fig. 5d shows the high-resolution fitting of C 1s. It has three shake up peaks at 284.8, 285.3, and 286.1 eV, corresponding to the CC (sp2), CN, and C–O, groups, respectively. The peak at 285.3 eV confirms the doping of nitrogen on carbon and is similar to the N 1s deconvoluted spectrum. The deconvoluted high-resolution spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 5e) revealed the presence of peaks at 398.7, 399.6, and 401.1 eV, corresponding to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and pyridine nitrogen, respectively. According to the peak intensity, pyrrolic and pyridinic N peaks are more prominent. Among the three types of nitrogen, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N can increase the ionic conductivity and help to improve the charge storage via increasing surface redox reactions.38Fig. 5f shows the high-resolution O 1s spectrum with peaks at 529.9, 531.7, and 533.2 eV, corresponding to a metal–oxygen bond (M–O–M), oxygen in hydroxide (R–OH), and physically adsorbed moisture (H–OH), respectively. The metal–oxygen bond seems very prominent, which confirms the presence of a bond between metal and oxygen.25,29 The atomic percentage of Mn, Co, O, C and N was measured to be ca. 20.83, 22.61, 40.34, 13.38, and 2.84%, respectively. The vibration bands due to metal and carbon in MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 and MnCo2O4@N–C are further examined by Raman spectroscopic analysis in the wavenumber range of 300–2000 cm−1 (λexi = 633 nm). The Raman spectrum shows an intense peak at 556 cm−1 (Fig. S7†), corresponding to the presence of birnessite α-MnO2.39,40 However, the peak corresponding to N–C is not clearly distinguishable because of a thin layer of N–C sandwiched between the MnCo2O4 core and MnO2 outer shell. Indeed, a thin layer of N–C is confirmed by the TEM and XPS analysis of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample.

4. Electrochemical performance
In order to check the practical application potential of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires, their charge storage performance was analysed in aqueous 3 M KOH and compared with those of pure MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C core@shell nanowires in a three-electrode system. Typical CV measurements were carried out in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.6 V. Fig. 6a shows the comparative CV plot of MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The pure MnCo2O4 nanorods show redox peaks, which are due to the battery-type nature of MnCo2O4, while in the cases of MnCo2O4@N–C and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2, the CV curves shows somewhat rectangular shapes with a redox peak. In the case of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample, the rectangular shape of the CV curve is mainly ascribed to the pseudocapacitive nature of MnO2, and redox peaks are attributed to MnCo2O4. The CV curves of the three electrode materials show a partly rectangular shape as well as distinguishable redox peaks. The rectangular CV curve behaviour is due to the pseudocapacitive nature of the manganese-based oxide sample and the redox peaks are due to the variable oxidation states of the cobalt ion. Among these three samples, MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires show a remarkably greater integrated area under the CV curves, indicating higher specific capacity compared to that of the MnCo2O4 and the MnCo2O4@N–C samples. This can be attributed to the larger surface area and nanoregime pore diameter of the electrode, as well as the synergistic interaction from the MnCo2O4 nanowire core arrays with a highly conductive N-doped carbon intermediate sandwich, along with an ultrathin MnO2 nanosheet outer shell. The CV curves of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample were analyzed at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1, and the corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. 6b, while those of the MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C samples are shown in Fig. S8a and S8c,† respectively. For all the samples (Fig. 6b, S8a and S8c†) when the scan rate is increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1 the anodic and cathodic peak current is increased, and the anodic and cathodic peak potentials are shifted towards positive and negative, respectively. This indicates a diffusion-controlled process with enlarged potential separation. It is observed that when the scan rate is increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1 the position of the anodic peak shifted from 0.31 to 0.42 V for the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample, while it shifted from 0.30 to 0.37 for the MnCo2O4 sample and it is 0.29 to 0.34 for the MnCo2O4@N–C sample, respectively. The shift in faradaic redox peaks can be attributed to good electrochemical reversibility.2,4 The area under the CV curve at different scan rates is apparently superior for the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample to that of the MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C samples, indicating better capacitance. The CV curves of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample show the presence of both faradaic and pseudocapacitive nature because of the presence of two different types of constituent materials (MnCo2O4 shows faradaic nature while MnO2 shows pseudocapacitive nature). Therefore, two phase charge control, linear diffusion-control, and surface-control give a clear idea about the nature of the materials, which can be determined using the power-law relationship (Ip = avb), where Ip is the peak intensity, v is the scan rate, and ‘a’ and ‘b’ indicate adjustable coefficients. For a reversible system, ‘a’ corresponds to the rate-limiting step governed by mass transport, while the value of ‘b’ indicates the electrochemical reaction. The percentage of faradaic and pseudocapacitive nature can be determined using the following equation, which is shown in Fig. S9.†I(V) = k1ν + k2ν1/2

(f) Cycling stability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 (the inset shows the first and last ten cycles of the GCD curves). 
The MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample shows ca. 37.8, 30.1, 23.4, 19.9, 17.8, 16.2, 14.9, 14, 13.3, 12.5, and 12% due to a faradaic nature and 62.2, 69.9, 76.6, 80.1, 82.2, 83.8, 85.1, 86.0, 86.3, 87.5, and 88% due to a pseudocapacitive nature at a scan rate of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mV s−1 respectively.2,27
In order to further quantify the electrochemical performance of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire electrodes, we have performed galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles in a 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at various current densities ranging from 3 to 50 mA cm−1 (Fig. 6c). The charge–discharge curves show linear charging–discharging in the potential range of −0.1 to 0.2 V with respect to time, indicating the pseudocapacitive behaviour due to the electrochemical adsorption/desorption of charge separation at the electrode and electrolyte interface caused by the N doped carbon and redox process by Mn2+ ions, while the potential range from 0.2 to 0.5 V shows small humps, showing typical faradaic behaviour due to redox reaction of cobalt at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The overall shapes of the GCD curves are in good agreement with CV analysis.41 On the other hand, the unsymmetrical charge–discharge behaviour of hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 is due to the certain kinetic irreversibility of the OH− ions of the electrolyte on the ultrathin MnO2 surface during the redox process, which results in dissimilarity in the charging and discharging time.42 The intermediate N–C would be expected to provide buffer space for electron conductivity, low diffusion resistance to charge/ions and easy penetration of the electrolyte into the high electroactive areas, and therefore can provide better capacitance in charge–discharge cycles. As compared to MnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4@N–C, hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 shows better symmetry in the charging and discharging curves. The GCD of MnCo2O4@N–C and MnCo2O4 electrodes is shown in Fig. S8b and S8d,† respectively. The GCD curve of the MnCo2O4 sample shows a battery-type nature whereas the MnCo2O4@N–C sample shows a nature similar to the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample. We have estimated the areal capacity (in mA h cm−2) using the GCD discharge curves for all three of the samples, and the corresponding plot of areal capacity vs. current density is displayed in Fig. 6d. The calculated areal capacity values of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 are ca. 0.75, 0.62, 0.58, 0.51, 0.46, 0.41, 0.38, 0.34, and 0.32 mA h cm−2 at current densities of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. At the same current densities the estimated gravimetric specific capacities are ca. 312, 288, 253, 205, 196, 176, 151, 142, and 137 mA h g−1, respectively. For the MnCo2O4@N–C electrode, the areal capacities were measured to be ca. 0.32, 0.28, 0.25, 0.22, 0.19, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15, and 0.14 mA h cm−2, and the estimated gravimetric specific capacities are ca. 155, 135, 120, 105, 91, 82, 76, 69, and 66 mA h g−1, respectively, while for the MnCo2O4 electrode the calculated area capacities are ca. 0.186, 0.17, 0.15, 0.14, 0.09, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03, and 0.02 mA h cm−2, and the corresponding gravimetric specific capacities are ca. 109, 100, 88, 82, 43, 35, 23, 18, and 14 mA h g−1 respectively. The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample retains ca. 44% of its initial capacity (ca. 137 mA h g−1 at a higher current density of 50 mA cm−2), which is better than that of MnCo2O4@N–C (ca. 42%) and MnCo2O4 (ca. 18%). The low rate capability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 sample can be due to the unsatisfactory electrical conductivity of the MnO2 outer shell at a higher scan rate. The decreasing trend of the areal capacity as well as the specific capacity upon increasing the current density in all three of the electrodes can be ascribed to the internal resistance of the active working electrode materials, thus resulting in higher IR drops at higher current densities.43,44 The lower specific capacity retention at higher current densities for MnCo2O4 can be attributed to the inadequate electrical conductivity. However, the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode material exhibits superior electrochemical properties in terms of specific/areal capacity compared to the other two electrodes, as well as recently reported metal oxide-based core@shell materials (Table S1†). As compared to MnCo2O4@Ni3S2 (0.4 V), MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 shows a high working potential window (0.6 V), which increases the energy density of the electroactive material. Carbon materials are known for better cycling stability and in the present case, the N–C intermediate shell provides higher structural stability, resulting in ca. 89.6% cycling stability after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of MnCo2O4@Ni3S2 (only 92% after 5000 cycles). The higher potential window as well as higher cycling stability are considered as important parameters for practical applications. The higher electrochemical performance of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode material can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the sandwiched MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 acts like a single bulk material, which provides free buffer space with the open network to accommodate electrolyte ions resulting in higher activity as well as higher structural stability; (ii) the heteroatom doped carbonaceous (N–C) intermediate shell is expected to provide good electron conductivity, low diffusion resistance to electrolyte ions and easy penetration within high electroactive areas; (iii) moreover, the highly conductive N–C intermediate shell acts as a mediator for the rapid transfer of electrolyte ions between the faradaic MnCo2O4 core and pseudocapacitive MnO2 shell, resulting in higher activity of the overall material; (iv) the pseudocapacitance nature of the uniformly decorated porous MnO2 shell provides direct transport channels for the electrolyte ions leading to improved specific capacity of the material.35,45
The charge transfer kinetic mechanism of hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrodes in high-frequency and low-frequency regions was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. S10a† shows the schematic representation of the ideal EIS Nyquist plot, which consists of different distinct regions (high-frequency related to charge transfer kinetics (Rct), middle frequency corresponding to Warburg impedance, and low frequency corresponding to capacitive nature).2,46 The EIS spectrum was recorded in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, and the Nyquist plot of the three materials is shown in Fig. 6e and the inset shows the equivalent circuit. The internal resistance (IR) of the electrodes was measured by plotting the voltage drop as a function of current density and it was found to be 0.53, 0.57 and 0.62 Ω for the samples MnCo2O4, MnCo2O4@N–C, and MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2, respectively. The estimated Rct of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 is ca. 0.15 Ω, which is lower than that of MnCo2O4@N–C (ca. 0.3 Ω) and MnCo2O4 (ca. 0.38 Ω), indicating better charge transfer kinetics than those of the other two samples. In addition, the straight line in the low-frequency region of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 is more inclined than that of the other two samples, suggesting a better capacitive nature.13,47 These results indicate faster electron-transfer kinetics of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2, which is ascribed to the synergistic interaction of the core, sandwich and shell. The long-term electrochemical performance of the electrodes is another critical factor for practical application. In order to study the durability, we have demonstrated the cycling stability performance of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrodes at a higher current density of 50 mA cm−1 for 10000 GCD cycles in an alkaline electrolyte (Fig. 6f). We have noticed 89.6% capacity retention even after 10000 cycles, which indicates excellent cycling stability of the electrode material. The inset of Fig. 6f shows the first and last ten cycles of the GCD curves, which show that it retains its initial pseudocapacitive nature, which is due to effective faradaic activity at the electrode surface.48 The Nyquist plot of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 recorded before and after 10000 cycles is shown in Fig. S10b,† and the plot recorded after 10000 cycles is almost identical to the initial one in the high frequency region. The only minor change is seen in the low frequency region, indicating a reduction in capacitive behaviour after a large number of cycles. This could be due to the removal of the loosely bound particles at the outer surface of the electrode during repeated charge–discharge cycles. Nevertheless, the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode material shows 99.5% coulombic efficiency at a current density of 50 mA cm−1 (Fig. 6f), which indicates very good reversibility of the material, and this can be ascribed to several attributes: (i) synergistic interaction of the core, sandwich and shell material; (ii) the interfacial contact of the MnO2 shell with highly conductive N–C can increase the electrical conductivity and also help accelerate the electron transport kinetics by increasing the surface area in a given volume of the electrode; (iii) the thin MnO2 nanosheets protect the MnCo2O4@N–C core and make the hierarchical pathways for the diffusion of electrolyte ions through the pore network in the entire electrode; (iv) the volume change during the faradaic redox process is accommodated by the ultrathin MnO2 shell and thus the maceration of the materials is prevented. Thus, the three electrode measurements show superior charge storage capability and excellent stability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode material.49,50
Furthermore, in order to evaluate the real charge storage performance of the hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode in a two electrode system for practical applications, we assembled a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device using the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 material as the positive electrode and an N-doped graphene hydrogel (NGH) material as the negative electrode, and these two are separated by a piece of cellulose paper (all are soaked in a PVA/KOH electrolyte solid-gel). The digital photograph of the final fabricated asymmetric device is shown in Fig. S11.† The reason for choosing NGH as the negative material is due to its high charge storage performance in the negative potential window. NGH is a stable anode material and has potential to store energy due to the presence of a porous high surface area and superior electrochemical properties. The optical image, FE-SEM image and electrochemical measurements (CV, GCD and EIS) of NGH are shown in Fig. S12(a–c).† The CV curve shows a perfect rectangular shape in the potential window of −1.0 to 0.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and similarly, the GCD plot results are also in accordance with the CV results with perfect EDLC charging–discharging. The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode shows CV in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.6 V due to the presence of faradaic redox features on the surface of the electrode, while NGH has the perfect EDLC in the potential window from −1.0 to 0.0 V, as shown in Fig. S13a.† Therefore, the device of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC can achieve a high operating potential window and result in improved energy density and power density. The selection of the working potential window plays an important role in obtaining high energy and power densities. First, the CV for the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device was carried out in different potential window ranges from 0.0–0.6 to 0.0–1.8 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 (Fig. 7a). The CV plot shows an almost rectangular shape up to 1.2 V, indicating an incomplete faradaic process, but when the potential window increased to more than 1.4 V, a well-defined resolved battery type oxidation and reduction peak was observed, suggesting a complete faradaic process on the surface of the electrode in the ASC device. However, when the potential window further increases beyond 1.6 V, it leads to a sharp increase in current due to oxygen evolution. Therefore, the CV operating potential window for the ACS device was fixed between 0.0 and 1.6 V. Fig. 7b shows the CV curves of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device recorded at different scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 in a fixed operating potential window of 0.0–1.6 V. The shapes of CV curves (Fig. 7b) and GCD curves (Fig. 7c) show the batter-type nature of the ASC device. The unsymmetrical CV curves and charge–discharge curves are due to a combination of hybrid materials. The well-resolved redox peaks with better reversibility are noticed, but at a high scan rate the reduction peaks become weaker, indicating an incomplete faradaic process at the surface of either the positive or the negative electrode.

The GCD curves of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device were analyzed at 1.6 V operating potential at various current densities ranging from 4 to 50 mA cm−2. Symmetrical charge–discharge plateaus with typical battery-type pseudocapacitive nature were observed (Fig. 7c). The plateau in the discharge curve (0.7–1.0 V) at lower current densities is due to the redox phenomena of the cobalt in the MnCo2O4 core material of the ASC device electrode. Furthermore, the plateau in the low potential region of 0–0.2 V at a lower current density can be due to the presence of redox reactions at the dangling bonds of the N-doped graphene hydrogel. The characteristics of the GCD curves consistent with the CV curves. There is a small IR drop (ca. 0.1 V) at a low current density, which is due to the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the cell.51 The cell capacity (Cc, mA h cm−2) of the ASC device was estimated as a function of current density, and the corresponding plot is shown in Fig. 7d. The cell capacities of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device were calculated to be ca. 85.3, 70.3, 64.9, 59.8, 52.2, 47.1, 44.8, and 41.9 mA h g−1 at current densities of 4, 8, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The decreasing trend of cell capacity with increasing current density could possibly be due to the IR drop caused by ESR and insufficient faradaic processes on the surface of the ASC electrodes. The MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device significantly displayed a better cell capacity of ca. 85.3 mA h g−1 at 4 mA cm−2, and still it retained 41.9 mA h g−1 (ca. 49.0%) of its initial cell capacity even at a higher current density of 50 mA cm−2, signifying better rate capability of the device. To assess the cycling stability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device, 10000 consecutive GCD cycles were recorded at a current density of 30 mA cm−2 and the estimated capacity retention is shown in Fig. 7e. After 10000 cycles, ca. 91.1% capacity retention of its initial cell capacity was observed, and the very slight decrease in cell capacity can be ascribed to exhaustion caused by the volume expansion of the device materials during the cycling process. The inset of Fig. 7e shows the last ten cycles, which shows almost identical charge–discharge shapes of the initial curves, suggesting excellent reversibility. In order to examine the feasibility of the ASC device, coulombic efficiency was estimated and is shown in Fig. 7e. It shows almost 99.2% coulombic efficiency, which indicates good reversibility and feasibility of the ASC device. The charge transfer kinetics of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device were determined by EIS studies before and after the stability test. The Nyquist plot (Fig. S13b†) of the ASC device shows that the Rs of the ASC before and after 10000 cycles was found to be the same (i.e. ca. 0.77 Ω), and there is not much change in the profile, which further validates its robustness.
The energy density and power density of the ACS device were estimated from GCD curves and are shown in the Ragone plot of Fig. 7f. Strikingly, the ASC device exhibits a remarkable energy density of ca. 68.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 749.2 W kg−1. Even at a high-power density of 11200 W kg−1, the hybrid ASC device still maintains an energy density of ca. 33.5 W h kg−1 (49%), demonstrating the superior charge storage capability of the ASC device. The observed results are better than those of previously reported metal oxide-based ASC device materials, such as NiCo2O4@MnO2//AG (energy density of 27.8 W h kg−1/at a power density of 400.3 W kg−1),52 MnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2//AC (48 W h kg−1/1.4 kW kg−1),53 MnO2@NiCo2O4//NC (46.2 W h kg−1/15.3 kW kg−1),54 NiFe2O4@MnO2//AC (45.2 W h kg−1/174 W kg−1),55 NiCo2O4/MnO2//MoO3@PPy (60.4 W h kg−1/960 W kg−1),56 and NiCo2O4@MnO2//AC (37.5 W h kg−1/187.5 W kg−1),57 and the overall comparison is shown in the Fig. 7f Ragone plot and Table S2.† More importantly, the practical applicability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device was tested by lighting a green LED bulb (working window is 1.8 V), which is shown in the inset of Fig. 7f. Overall, we conclude that the core@sandwich@shell type hybrid MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire demonstrated excellent charge storage capability and stability in the three electrode system and in the ASC device. Importantly, the employed metal precursors for the synthesis of MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 are earth abundant and cost-effective. Therefore, the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH based ASC can be an ideal system for modern practical applications.
5. Conclusion
In summary, hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowires were successfully grown on Ni foam through a facile, scalable, and economical hydrothermal method. Initially, a 1D MnCo2O4 core was grown on Ni foam, and then wrapped with an N-doped carbon intermediate sandwich, and finally coated with a MnO2 shell. The synthesized core@sandwich@shell material was systematically characterised and its charge storage capacity in a three electrode system and ASC device was studied. The hierarchical MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 nanowire electrode demonstrated a higher specific capacity/areal capacity of 312 mA h g−1/0.75 mA cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2, which can be ascribed to a synergistic effect of the MnCo2O4 core, N–C sandwich and MnO2 shell. This advanced architecture enables fast electron/ion transport, and thereby a faster faradaic process. The hierarchical electrodes display excellent rate capability (44%) and a better cycling stability of 89.6% at 50 mA cm−2 after 10000 cycles. The electrochemical performance of the hierarchical materials is significantly better than previously reported data. Moreover, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH device was fabricated using MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 as the positive electrode and NGH as the negative electrode, which delivers an exceptionally higher energy density of 68.2 W h kg−1 with a power density of 749.2 W kg−1 and retains 33.5 W h kg−1 (49.0%) energy density at a high-power density of 11200 W kg−1, which is better than previously reported data. Furthermore, the ASC device showed an excellent cycling stability of ca. 91.1% retention even after 10000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2. To see the practical applicability of the MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH ASC device, a LED bulb was lit by assembling two MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2//NGH based ASCs in series. In addition, the employed strategy in the present work for synthesizing the core@sandwich@shell type MnCo2O4@N–C@MnO2 electrode material is indeed the best way to fabricate supercapacitors and other energy storage materials for future electronics thus far.
