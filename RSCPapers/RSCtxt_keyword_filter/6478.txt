    , Accepted 11th February 2009First published on 2nd March 2009AbstractWe employed a binary spacer of orderly conjugated 3,4-ethyldioxythiophene and thienothiophene to construct a wide-spectral response organic chromophore for dye-sensitized solar cells, exhibiting a high power conversion efficiency of 9.8% measured under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) sunlight and an excellent stability.
Over the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have inspired tremendous excitement for their feasibility to afford photovoltaic devices with a perceptible high performance/price ratio.1 The predominant attribute of DSCs embodies a mesoporous semiconducting film coated with a quasi-monolayer of light-harvesting dye molecules and immersed in a redox electrolyte. This intriguing assembly with low-cost materials can perform efficiently the basic physical processes required by solar cells, such as light absorption, charge generation and charge transport. On the basis of systematic device engineering benefited from continuous efforts on material innovation and device physics, a state of the art DSC with a highly volatile electrolyte has achieved a validated efficiency of 11.1% measured at AM1.5G conditions.2
Taking account of the limited ruthenium resource, metal-free organic dyes with a high molar extinction coefficient have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their low-cost and good flexibility in molecular tailoring. In this context, enormous studies have been focused on molecular engineering of chromophores to attain a capability of panchromatic light-harvesting.3 Moreover, these exotic optoelectronic molecules need to be controllably assembled on titania nanocrystals for favorable energy alignments and stacking modes, which have significant influence on charge generation, charge collection, and rectification at the titania/dye/electrolyte nano-interface.4
In this communication we report a very promising sensitizer, coded C217 and presented in Fig. 1, which even with a preliminary optimization has already achieved a strikingly high efficiency of 9.8% measured under illumination of AM1.5G full sunlight. While employing a lipophilic dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine electron-donor (D) and hydrophilic cyanoacrylic acid electron-acceptor (A) like C206 and C211 reported previously,5,6 a distinguishable feature of this new amphiphilic D–π–A chromophore consists in a binary π-conjugated spacer. Here an electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene unit is connected to D to lift the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), while thienothiophene conjugated with A leads to a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy. Moreover, our calculation has shown that different from thiophene and thienothiophene, EDOT has a small torsion angle with respect to the adjoining phenyl fragment, ensuring efficient electronic communication between D and A. This new dye was prepared in a moderate yield and the synthetic details are described in the ESI.†

As presented in Fig. 2, the electronic absorption spectrum of the C217 dye has one intense visible absorption band centered at 552 nm, which is 36 nm red-shifted in contrast to C206. Note that in place of the binary conjugated spacer of 3,4-ethyldioxythiophene and thienothiophene, the bisthienothiophene possessed by the C211 dye shifts the absorption peak bathochromically only 8 nm compared to thienophene of C206. The molar extinction coefficient of the charge transfer transition absorption increases with the extension of the π-conjugation, i.e.C211 > C217 > C206.

We further performed the electronic state calculation of C217 with the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method in the Gaussian03W program suite to scrutinize the origin of electronic absorptions; see ESI.† The absorption peaking at 552 nm is mainly attributed to the π → π* transitions from HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO while the absorption at 386 nm is due to the electron transitions from HOMO to LUMO+1, HOMO−1 to LUMO, and HOMO−2 to LUMO. Obviously, the HOMO of the C217 dye is mainly populated over the substituted triphenylamine and its adjacent 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene unit, while the LUMO is delocalized through the cyanoacrylic acid and its adjacent thienothiophene group, both with sizable contribution from the latter. This spatial orientation of HOMO and LUMO is an ideal condition for dye-sensitized solar cells, which not only facilitates the ultrafast interfacial electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the TiO2 conduction band, but also slows down the recombination of injected electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized dye molecules due to their remoteness. In addition, the hole localized on the triphenylamine unit is spatially convenient for the electron donor to approach, facilitating the fast dye regeneration.
A sensitizer must form energy offsets with the mesoporous titania and the iodideelectron donor, i.e. two “type-II” heterointerfaces (titania/dye and dye/electrolyte) to overcome the exciton binding energy in an organic material for charge generation. Note that an excited dye can be an electron donor as well as an electron acceptor. A preferential charge generation at the dye/titania interface is endowed by the direct chemical bonding of sensitizers with their carboxylate group, while a charge transfer at the dye/electrolyte interface is expected to be relatively slow partially due to a physical contact. Comparative square-wave voltammograms of C206, C211 and C217 dyes presented in Fig. 3 were measured with an ultramicroelectrode in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Amongst these three dyes, C217 displays the lowest oxidization potential due to the electron-rich character of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. In comparison with C211 employing the bisthienothiophene unit, the binary conjugated spacer shifts the reduction potential of C217 negatively, which is slightly more positive than that of C206. These ensure a narrow band-gap as revealed by absorption measurements shown in Fig. 2.

The HOMO and LUMO vs. vacuum of C217 were derived from the redox onset potentials by the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −4.88 − Fϕredox.7 The energy offset by the measured LUMO (−3.45 eV vs. vacuum) of the C217 dye relative to the conduction band edge (−4.00 eV vs. vacuum)1b of TiO2 provides the thermodynamic driving force for charge generation. The energy offset by the HOMO of C217 (−4.93 eV vs. vacuum) in contrast to that (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum)6 of iodide could lead to fast dye regeneration, avoiding the geminate charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photoinjected electrons in the nanocrystalline titania film.
Some preliminary photovoltaic tests were measured to evaluate the potential of this C217 sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells. A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected TiO2 particles was used as a mesoporous negative electrode. A 7 μm thick film of 20-nm-sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the highly transparent FTO conducting glass electrode (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick) and subsequently coated by a 5 μm thick second layer of 400-nm-sized light scattering anatase particles. The detailed preparation procedures of TiO2 nanocrystals, pastes for screen-printing and double-layer nanostructured TiO2 films have been reported in a previous paper.8 The TiO2 electrode was stained by immersing into a dye solution containing 150 μM C217, 300 μM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, and 1 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene (1 : 1 : 2 v/v/v) for 72 h. After washing with chlorobenzene twice and drying by air flow, the sensitized titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized conducting glass counter-electrode. The electrodes were separated by a 30 μm thick Bynel hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum back-filling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode (TEC 15 Ω □−1, Libbey-Owens-Ford Industries, 2.2 mm thick), made with a sand-blasting drill, was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. Two electrolytes were used for device evaluation. Electrolyte in cell A: 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) in acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85 : 15 v/v); electrolyte in cell B: DMII/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate/I2/N-butylbenzimidazole/GNCS (molar ratio: 12 : 12 : 16 : 1.67 : 3.33 : 0.67).
The photocurrent action spectrum of cell A with the C217 sensitizer is shown in Fig. 4A. The incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) exceeds 90% from 440 to 590 nm. The maximum efficiency of absorbed photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (APCE) is unity over a broad spectral range. As shown in Fig. 4B, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of cell A at AM1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2), are 16.1 mA cm−2, 803 mV and 0.759, respectively, yielding an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 9.8%. Note that six cells show an efficiency range from 9.6 to 9.9%. Without using an antireflection coating, a ∼4% lower photocurrent was observed. Apart from a high Jsc related to a good light-harvesting, cell A with the C217chromophore exhibits a high Voc and FF, probably due to a desirable self-assembling of dye molecules on titania nanocrystals via the staining protocol discussed here. Note that when other solvents are used in the C217 staining, cells present much lower performance, mainly owing to fast charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface as revealed by measuring transient photoelectrical decays. From the overlap integral of the IPCE curve with the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.0 mA cm−2 is calculated, which is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density. Therefore there is a negligible spectral mismatch between our solar simulator and the standard AM1.5G sunlight. Note that reference cells made with the C206 and C211 sensitizers have efficiencies of 7.5 and 8.0%, respectively.6 Considering the necessity of avoiding the use of volatile solvents in flexible DSCs with a plastic matrix, we also fabricated cell B with a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte. Its device parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η) are 15.2 mA cm−2, 726 mV, 0.738 and 8.1%, respectively. This high efficiency is comparable to the record of solvent-free DSCs achieved with a ruthenium sensitizer.9 This high performance cell still retained >96% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h accelerated tests under full sunlight soaking at 60 °C.†

In summary, we have synthesized a high molar extinction coefficient organic sensitizer with a binary π-conjugated spacer exhibiting an almost panchromatic photocurrent response. In conjunction with a volatile acetonitrile electrolyte and a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte, unprecedented high efficiencies of 9.8 and 8.1% measured under AM1.5G full sunlight have been reached for organic dye-sensitized solar cells. For the first time, we have demonstrated a stable, >8% efficiency, solvent-free DSC based on metal-free organic sensitizers. This achievement will considerably encourage further molecular and energy-level engineering of low-cost metal-free organic dyes, boosting the practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells.
