    First published on 24th September 2021AbstractSince the discovery of N-doped carbon nanotubes as the first carbon-based metal-free electrocatalyst (C-MFEC) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 2009, C-MFECs have shown multifunctional electrocatalytic activities for many reactions beyond ORR, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and hydrogen peroxide production reaction (H2O2PR). Consequently, C-MFECs have attracted a great deal of interest for various applications, including metal–air batteries, water splitting devices, regenerative fuel cells, solar cells, fuel and chemical production, water purification, to mention a few. By altering the electronic configuration and/or modulating their spin angular momentum, both heteroatom(s) doping and structural defects (e.g., atomic vacancy, edge) have been demonstrated to create catalytic active sites in the skeleton of graphitic carbon materials. Although certain C-MFECs have been made to be comparable to or even better than their counterparts based on noble metals, transition metals and/or their hybrids, further research and development are necessary in order to translate C-MFECs for practical applications. In this article, we present a timely and comprehensive, but critical, review on recent advancements in the field of C-MFECs within the past five years or so by discussing various types of electrocatalytic reactions catalyzed by C-MFECs. An emphasis is given to potential applications of C-MFECs for energy conversion and storage. The structure–property relationship for and mechanistic understanding of C-MFECs will also be discussed, along with the current challenges and future perspectives.

1. Introduction
The continued expansion of electric automobile, electronic, and communication industries1–3 has led to an ever-increasing demand for compact and portable electronic devices, which requires advanced energy materials for cost-effective and efficient energy conversion and storage with no harmful effect on the environment.4–6 In this regard, some renewable energy technologies, including fuel cells, water splitting electrolyzers, and metal–air batteries, have been demonstrated to perform energy conversion and storage with minimum or no environmental concern. On the other hand, certain innovative electrocatalytic technologies have been developed to cost-effectively produce value-added chemicals and/or energy materials, such as ammonia (NH3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and many other hydrocarbons (e.g., CH3OH, C2H2).1,7
As a heart of the aforementioned technologies, several seemingly simple, but important, electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction, and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER, respectively), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and hydrogen peroxide production reaction (H2O2PR), need to be addressed.1,8 Traditionally, noble metal-based electrodes, such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), and their various compounds, are well-known as the best catalysts for such electrochemical reactions.4,9 However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metals have hindered their large-scale applications. Therefore, their alloys and compounds with transition metals, and even transition metals only, have been investigated extensively as cheaper alternatives of noble-metal-based catalysts for electrocatalysis.1,5 However, these transition metal-based electrocatalysts are still too expensive for large-scale applications and have multiple disadvantages, including a low selectivity, susceptibility to time-dependent drift, poor durability in harsh electrolytes (particularly acidic), easy to be poisoned by by-product gases, and negative environmental effects.4,5 In 2009, N-doped carbon nanotubes were discovered as an effective carbon-based metal-free electrocatalyst (C-MFEC) for ORR in fuel cells6 – one of the most promising renewable energy technologies to transfer hydrogen into clean electricity [http://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/alk/alk3.htm]. This pioneering work subverts the traditional belief that noble-metal-based catalysts (e.g., Pt) are necessary for the ORR in fuel cells. Since then, C-MFEC has emerged as a new field of research worldwide (Fig. 1).4,8,10
 Fig. 1  Electrocatalytic activities of C-MFECs. 
The doping-induced charge transfer from carbon atoms to the adjacent nitrogen atoms caused change in the chemisorption mode of O2 to facilitate the ORR on the N-doped C-MFECs.6 Detection of this innovative. This new fundamental understanding of ORR mechanism in nitrogen-doped C-MFECs is important, which has been applied to the development of various metal-free efficient ORR catalysts for other reactions even beyond ORR.4,8,10 Over the last decade or so, the field of C-MFECs has grown enormously.8 As a result, heteroatom doping, defect doping, and/or structural modification have been used to develop various multifunctional C-MFECs for ORR/OER/HER,11–13 two-electron transfer ORR to produce H2O2 (an energy carrier and green oxidizer),14 reduction of triiodide to iodide (I2RR) in dye-sensitive solar cells (DSSCs),15 CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct conversion of CO2 into fuel,16 N2 reduction reaction (NRR) for the synthesis of NH3 under ambient environment,17 and for the renewable generation of clean energy from sunlight and water.18
Despite the remarkable progress, however, much more research efforts are still necessary to fundamentally understand the catalytic behaviors and realize practical applications of C-MFECs,5,8 particularly for some newly explored reactions (e.g., NRR, CO2RR, CO2ER, and H2O2PR). Herein, we present a timely, comprehensive, but critical review on recent advances in the field of C-MFECs with an emphasis on potential applications of C-MFECs for energy conversion and storage. In this article, various electrocatalytic reactions catalyzed by C-MFECs will be discussed and summarized. This is followed by detailed elucidation of the structure–property relationships for mechanistic understanding of C-MFECs, along with current challenges and future perspectives. Finally, among their many potential applications, the use of multifunctional C-MFECs in advanced energy devices and integrated energy systems is highlighted.
2. Carbon nanomaterials for electrocatalysis
2.1. C-MFECs based on carbon allotropes
As schematically shown in Fig. 2, C-MFECs primarily consist of carbon allotropes with different hybridization states of carbon–carbon bonds (e.g., sp3, sp2). Having different structural dimensions, ranging from 0 to 3D (0, 1, 2 and 3D), carbon allotropes can have different specific surface areas, conductivities, electrochemical activities, and mechanical properties (Fig. 3).4,5,10,19–23 0D carbon-based electrocatalysts include sp2 hybridized fullerene,24 carbon onions,25 quantum dots,26 and sp3 nanodiamond.27,28 While carbon nanotubes (CNTs), both single-walled (SWCNT) and multiwalled (MWCNT), and graphene are typical 1D and 2D C-MFECs, respectively, 3D C-MFECs are consist of disordered carbon foams and highly-ordered carbon pillars.20

For 3D architecture, adapted with permission from ref. 20, copyright 2008 to American Chemical Society. The electronic, chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of C-MFECs are determined by the dominant hybridization state of the carbon–carbon bonds, and the dopants/edge (e.g., armchair and zigzag edges)/defects (e.g., pentagon). Hybrids: nanotube–graphene pillars or porous carbons.

Considerable recent efforts have been made to fabricate either ordered or disordered mesoporous 3D carbon materials via self-assembling (e.g., hydrothermal treatment followed by freeze-drying) of lower-dimensional carbon allotropes (Fig. 2).21,23 For electrocatalytic applications, 3D porous carbon nanomaterials possess multiple advantages, including a large surface area for enhanced exposure of the electrocatalytic active sites, the multidimensional conductive network for improved electron/ion transport with reliable mechanical stability, and high porosity for efficient electrolyte/reactant diffusion. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, for cost-efficient large-scale production of the highly ordered porous 3D carbon nanomaterials (e.g., pillared graphene) compared to the disordered 3D carbon foams.20,21
2.2. Physical characteristics of C-MFECs
For energy conversion and storage, it is highly desirable for C-MFECs to have high electrical and thermal conductivities for efficient charge transport and heat management.21 C-MFECs must also be mechanically stable and reliable to ensure a long-term operation life.21 Graphitic carbon allotropes with sp2 hybridization have been demonstrated to exhibit outstanding mechanical and conducting properties, as exemplified by graphene with an excellent electron mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), intrinsic conductivity (∼106 S m−1), and Young's modulus (∼1.0 TPa).21,30–32 Compared to the highly-ordered 3D carbon architectures of seamless junctions produced by CVD,33–36 however, the disordered 3D porous carbon materials (e.g., 3D graphene foams) are often made from self-assembling graphene oxide (GO) produced through acid oxidization of graphite flakes, followed by chemical reduction to form the reduced GO (designated as: rGO), leading to an electrical conductivity of only ∼0.1 to 2.98 × 104 S m−1 because of the undesired scattering of the charge carriers by the residual sp3 carbon bonded to oxygen in rGO.37
Generally speaking, CVD-grown carbon architectures possess a higher conductivity than their chemically-processed counterparts. Thus, the electrical conducting properties of carbon electrodes required for electrocatalytic applications can be enhanced by carbonization of C-MFECs at high temperatures (800–1000 °C).38,39 Indeed, N, S codoped porous carbon material synthesized by ball-milling of lyophilized melamine–nickel sulfate, followed by pyrolysis at 800 °C and acid etching (to remove the nickel species), was demonstrated to show an electrical conductivity of ca. 20–22 S m−1 with good trifunctional electrocatalytic activities.38
2.3. Electrocatalytic characteristics of C-MFECs

2.3.1 Multifunctional electrocatalytic activities for C-MFECs. 
To modulate the electrocatalytic activities of C-MFECs, various strategies, including heteroatom(s) doping and defect generation, have been developed.8,40 All of these strategies have been demonstrated to effectively modify the charge/spin distribution of the sp2-conjugated carbon networks (e.g., CNTs, graphene) or sp3-hybridized nanodiamonds. Specifically, the atomic sites with a positive charge and/or higher spin density can alter the chemisorption of the intermediates and the subsequent electron transfer for the break/formation of chemical bonds.8,29,40 While the modulated electron structures are favorable for effective adsorption of reaction intermediates, the valence orbital matching between the catalytic active site and the adsorbed reactant is considered to be important for facilitating electron transfer during the reaction.40 Furthermore, different atomic structures of dopants, defects, and edges (zigzag, armchair) can also contribute diversely to the electronic structure modulation, and hence tuning the electrocatalytic performance of C-MFECs.40
For heteroatom-doped C-MFECs, the doping process often redistributes charge density and/or spin density of carbon atoms in the lattice due to the difference in electronegativity/spin density between carbon atoms and heteroatoms, and thus effectively regulates the work function of the catalytic active centers (CACs) to enhance the adsorption of reactants at the CACs.29 Owing to the size difference between the carbon and dopant atoms, the local geometry in the proximity of heteroatom dopants also changed along with the doping/codoping/multidoping of heteroatom(s). When the large-size dopants, such as Se, Br, and I, are doped into the graphitic carbon lattice, the doping-induced spatial distortion could significantly enhance the catalytic activities. As schematically shown in Fig. 3, therefore, the electronegativity and atomic size of heteroatoms both play essential roles in regulating the catalytic performance of C-MFECs. For S-doped C-MFECs, however, charge redistribution is unlikely to occur due to the close electronegativity between sulfur (2.58) and carbon (2.55).41 Instead, the spin density redistribution induced by S-doping has been demonstrated to be responsible for the improved ORR catalytic activity.41–43 Moreover, such electronic and spin modulations can also be obtained by introducing lattice defects of atomic vacancies into C-MFECs as well as intermolecular charge-transfer and photo-induced charge-transfer over the whole pH range, as we should see below.
Intermolecular charge transfer for efficient ORR. 
As can be seen from the above discussion, doping graphitic carbon materials with heteroatoms and/or defects induced charge/spin redistributions to impart electrocatalytic activities to C-MFECs. In addition to the heteroatom(s)-doping-induced intramolecular charge-transfer, intermolecular charge transfer has also been reported to promote ORR and other reactions in C-MFECs.8 For instance, certain polyelectrolyte (e.g., PDDA) functionalized CNTs (either in an aligned or nonaligned form), and graphene were demonstrated to show efficient ORR electrocatalytic activities in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH), along with OER and HER.44,45 Recently, the intermolecular charge-transfer between adsorbed C60 molecules and SWCNTs was reported to induce high catalytic activities for ORR in not only alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) with an onset potential of 0.91 V (vs. RHE, same below unless otherwise stated), but also neutral electrolyte (phosphate buffer).46Fig. 4a schematically shows the electrocatalytic mechanism for C60/SWCNTs, while Fig. 4b reproduces the corresponding ORR results.46

In a similar but independent study, a new class of hybrid carbon-based materials composed of boron carbon nitride nanosheets and fullerene molecules (F/BCN) were reported as multifunctional catalysts for the HER/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the OER/ORR (Fig. 4c).48 Specifically, the remarkable ORR electrocatalytic properties of F/BCN (especially for 10 wt% fullerene in BCN nanosheets, 10% F/BCN) are associated with the positively charged N active sites at the interfaces between C60 and BCN sheets, the large amount of pyridinic N atoms in the BCN nanosheets of 10% F/BCN as Lewis base sites for the oxygen adsorption, and the possible influence of the “B–C–N” edge groups.48 Based on the calculated Gibbs free energy, the 10% F/BCN showed the low rate-limiting potential (0.81 eV), thus decreasing the energy barrier for the rate-determining catalytic step. A desirable low value of the potential (0.69 eV) of the limiting step (*O → *OOH) was calculated for OER, the local interactions as well as the intermolecular electron transfer between the fullerenes and the BCN nanosheets for the 10% F/BCN system decreased the uphill energy states toward the formation of catalytic intermediates, thus leading to the good catalytic activity towards OER. The value of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) is 0.03 eV for 10% F/BCN, which is very close to the ideal value of zero and in agreement with the superior HER performance. In addition, the 10% F/BCN catalyst generated the high current density of 1.47 mA cm−2 at 0.1 V vs. RHE for HOR, in good consistence with the theoretical ΔGH* value of −0.03 eV. Thus, the 10% F/BCN can act as a multifunctional C-MFEC towards ORR/OER/HER/HOR.48
In another study, CNTs modified by epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine copolymer (EDC) were also demonstrated to show intermolecular charge (electron) transfer from the CNT to EDC to serve as a C-MFEC with remarkable catalytic activity and stability (Fig. 4d and e).47 As shown in Fig. 4e, the CNT–EDC exhibited an ORR onset potential of 0.87 V and half-wave potential of 0.70 V with a large diffusion-limited current density of 3.52 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.47 Moreover, nitrobenzene groups have also been chemically adsorbed onto a graphene sheet to act as a p-type dopant for charge transfer with the graphene sheet, leading to a higher ORR activity than that of the pristine graphene.49 Thus, it can be envisioned that a proper match of the donor–acceptor pair for an efficient intermolecular charge-transfer could make the intermolecular charge-transfer route an effective approach for cost-effective mass production of high-performance C-MFECs. More research activities in this direction would be of great value.
The above heteroatom-/defect-free methodology provided a facile, efficient, and cost-effective way to the development of metal-free, multifunctional catalysts simply by adsorbing electron-acceptors with electron-donors. The methodology thus developed is simpler than the heteroatom-/defect-doping routes toward C-MFECs, which usually involve the energy-consuming pyrolysis process. Furthermore, heteroatom-/defect-free C-MFECs are prepared by adsorption, which causes no structural damage of the carbon materials to retain the structure integrity and good property of the constituents, along with a good stability for the resultant C-MFEC. In contrast, doping heteroatoms into the carbon skeleton often cause structure damage, leading to a poor catalytic stability.
Photo-enhanced ORR. 
Due to the photo-induced charge-transfer property intrinsically associated with C60 molecule, preliminary results have also demonstrated that C60/SWCNTs possess photo-induced electrocatalytic activities for ORR.46 In this context, g-C3N4 has also been reported to act as both a photon absorber and electrocatalyst for ORR.50 As such, g-C3N4 with proper band-gap engineering can be utilized for photo-induced ORR.50,51 Doping with non-metal elements is an effective way to tune the redox potentials (band-gap) and the photogenerated charge transport/transfer efficiency for g-C3N4.52 Furthermore, O-doping of g-C3N4 can restrain the recombination of electron–hole pairs and enhance the light absorption efficiency53 while doping with the elements of a large atomic number (S, Se) can weaken the O2 adsorption.54 Indeed, the ORR performance of g-C3N4 was reported to increase under visible light illumination, though detailed mechanistic understanding is needed.54
pH independent ORR. 
It is necessary for C-MFECs to show efficient ORR performance in various electrolytes having different pH values so that they could be used either in an alkaline or an acid electrolyte and be readily integrated into efficient devices/systems with a single electrolyte. As it is well known, most of the transition-/noble-metal-based ORR electrocatalysts are not stable in acidic electrolytes for long-term operation.55 C-MFECs are promising for such utilizations because of their structural diversity and excellent stability in different electrolytes. So far, a few pH-universal C-MFECs have been devised.56–61 Of particular interest, P/N-codoped porous carbon foams (P–N-GFs-HMPA) were prepared by solvothermal method, followed by pyrolysis utilizing graphene oxides and carbon nanotubes as carbon building blocks and hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) as the P and N sources.58 Interestingly, the use of HMPA could not only remarkably increase the content of both P and N, but also offer a high density of the coupled N–P moieties. This, together with the optimized open-porous local structures for efficient electron and electrolyte transports, makes the resultant P–N-GFs-HMPA foam exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR in acidic medium (0.1 M HClO4), having an E1/2 of about 0.78 V (0.82 V for Pt/C) and onset potential of about 0.98 V (0.93 V for Pt/C) with a limiting current density of 4.7 mA cm−2 (4.9 mA cm−2 for Pt/C). This electrocatalyst showed an onset potential of 1.04 V for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH), which is also superior to the Pt/C catalyst.58 These results indicated that highly efficient pH-universal C-MFECs for ORR electrocatalysis could be developed by proper heteroatom(s) doping and multidimensional structure engineering.
In view of the above discussions, therefore, electrocatalytic activities induced by the charge-/spin-redistribution (both intramolecular and intermolecular) via heteroatom-/defect-doping, spin-charge coupling, photo-irradiation, and pH-variation should be investigated further by combined experimental and theoretical approaches to identify CACs for specific electrochemical reactions. Insights thus gained will be used to guide the design and development of advanced multifunctional C-MFECs for integrated energy conversion and storage systems of practical significance.8,18,29,40,43,62
By integrating multiple CACs with specific functions through multi-doping with more than one kind of heteroatoms, multifunctional C-MFECs can be created for multiple electron transfer reactions (e.g., ORR, OER, HER, CO2RR, NRR).21,63 Unlike metal alloys that often suffer segregation problems, the heteroatom-doped multifunctional C-MFECs with covalent chemical bonds between the carbon base and dopant atoms should have no segregation issue, leading to good stability. Apart from the cost and stability benefits, multifunctional C-MFECs offer multiple advantages over traditional metal-based electrocatalysts for broad applications, particularly for integrated energy conversion and storage.18,62 However, identifying the intrinsic catalytic activities and the structures associated with each of the multiple CACs in a multifunctional C-MFEC is a challenging task. Further research work in this emerging area is needed.


2.3.2 Electrocatalytic active sites for heteroatom-/defect-doped C-MFECs. 
As briefly mentioned above, one of the powerful approaches to acquire high electrocatalytic activities for carbon materials is to dope/co-dope/multi-dope them with different heteroatom(s), such as nitrogen (N), sulphur (S), boron (B), phosphorus (P), fluorine (F) and oxygen (O).21,63 Upon doping with heteroatom(s), the C atoms adjacent to heteroatom dopants can become either negatively or positively charged, depending on their electronegativity mismatches and relative positions (Fig. 5a).64 Among many physical and chemical factors, including the effective surface area, availability of active reaction centers on the catalyst surface, electronic and ionic conductivities, stability in various electrolytes, and mechanical reliability, the doping-induced charge redistribution is the crucial factor to determine the chemical selectivity by regulating the adsorption of reactants/intermediates and the associated charge-transfer between the catalytic surface and absorbents, and hence the ultimate electrocatalytic performance of C-MFECs.21

Adapted with permission from ref. 66, copyright 2016 to American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Among the C-MFECs doped with various heteroatoms, N-doped C-MFECs have been most extensively studied. Now, it is well known that N dopants can form different configurations within the graphitic carbon lattice, such as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N.65Fig. 5b shows these N-configurations along with the corresponding binding energies obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analyses.65 For the design of efficient N-doped C-MFECs, it is essential to understand correlations between the specific nitrogen-binding configurations and the electrocatalytic activities for a particular reaction.66 Using HOPG model catalysts and nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (N-GNS) powder catalysts, Guo et al., have recently revealed that C-atoms next to the pyridinic N with Lewis basicity are the active sites for ORR in acidic electrolyte (0.1 M H2SO4).66 As shown in Fig. 5c, the LSV curves from HOPG samples with different contents of pyridinic N and graphitic N atoms confirmed the pyridinic N atoms as the active sites for ORR in an acidic electrolyte (0.1 M H2SO4).66 In another similar but independent recent study, Yao and co-workers have revealed that the zigzag lattice edge and the pentagonal Stone–Wales defect at the carbon lattice edge could also exhibit efficient ORR activities in acidic electrolyte.67 Although significant progress has been achieved, it is still difficult to distinguish contributions from the heteroatom(s), vacancy, or Stone–Wales defect for a specific C-MFEC as heteroatom-doping often introduces defects and/or vacancies. Furthermore, highly accurate methodologies to simultaneously control and probe the atomic-level location, structure, and chemistries of CACs remain elusive.68 It is necessary to integrate the synthesis, characterization, and modeling to elucidate the fundamental issues that control catalytic activities, and to track the dynamic material evolution in the reaction environments in situ. Insights thus gained could be used to guide the design and fabrication of advanced C-MFECs of practical significance.


2.3.3 Design and synthesis of efficient C-MFECs. 
The electrocatalytic performance of C-MFECs is highly dependent on the availability of active sites and their interactions with reactant/product/intermediate molecules and electrolyte ions. The activity of active sites varies with synthesis and processing conditions.21,69,70 For instance, chemically synthesized C-MFECs often need pyrolysis at high temperatures (700 to 1000 °C) for graphitization/formation of micro/mesopores, and the temperature at which the final product is annealed influence the electrocatalytic performance. It was demonstrated that annealing at 1000 °C is better than 900 °C for pH universal ORR catalyzed by chemically synthesized N/P-codoped graphitic carbon materials,57 while pyrolysis at 700 (for 2 h), 800 (for 2 h) and 900 °C (for 1 h) consecutively in Ar gas flow was reported to be effective for S/N-codoped graphite sheets with stereoscopic holes towards trifunctional (ORR–OER–HER) electrocatalysis.38
N/P/F-tridoped graphene sheets were also produced by pyrolyzing a mixture of GO, polyaniline, and ammonium hexafluorophosphate at 950 °C for 1 h for trifunctional ORR–OER–HER.62 Besides, a mesoporous carbon foam co-doped with N and P (NPMC), fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the polyaniline aerogel synthesized in the presence of phytic acid, followed by pyrolysis at different temperature (900 to 1100 °C, Fig. 6a), showed good bifunctional electrocatalytic properties for both ORR and OER.71 Although a larger surface area of ∼1663 m2 g−1 was obtained for NPMC-1100 in comparison to NPMC-1000 (surface area: 1548 m2 g−1), NPMC-1000 exhibited much better bifunctional electrocatalytic performance due to the decomposition of heteroatoms at 1100 °C.71 Thus, electrocatalytic activities of the C-MFECs depend on not only the surface area but also many other factors, such as pyrolysis temperature, dopant amount, conductivity, and stability.8

It was demonstrated that N-doping occurred at a temperature as low as 80 °C and up to 1100 °C for rGO by hydrothermal or thermal treatment of GO with urea/hydrazine or ammonia, showing the highest N-doping level at 500 °C.73–76 Generally speaking, heteroatom(s) doping in GO is a complicate process, which depends on its morphology, oxidation level, and nature of the functional groups.74–76 The thermal treatment above 900 °C generally results in the decomposition of some heteroatoms from the carbon skeleton.77 However, it is still an issue of controversy as annealing at 900 °C or above is often used to remove chemical residues and enhance the crystallinity and conductivity for C-MFECs obtained by chemical or hydrothermal methods.21,38 Furthermore, chemically fabricated 3D C-MFECs typically demonstrate a lower specific surface area and an inferior conductivity, along with the agglomeration of carbon nanosheets into stacked graphitic structures to further reduce electrocatalytic activities, making them less efficient than 3D C-MFECs produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD, vide infra).21 However, chemical processes are relatively simple and cost-effective for a large-scale production of C-MFECs for commercial applications.
Efficient C-MFECs can also be chemically synthesized from various polymers in large quantities at a low cost. In particular, the use of controlled polymerization methods, such as atom transfer radical polymerization and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, enabled the synthesis of polymers with controlled degrees of polymerization (DP), low dispersity, and complex but well-defined monomer sequence arrangements and architectures.78 In fact, well-defined polymeric precursors from controlled polymerization are very useful, especially those with different architectures that can be used for chain alignment, determination of the types of exposed surfaces, and/or control the size of conjugated domains.78–82 Polymer-based precursors that easily form carbon materials generally need to undergo a stabilization step (e.g., crosslinking) that can occur thermally, chemically, or their combination before reaching to pyrolytic temperatures.79–81 These stabilization reactions in many ways determine how effectively a polymer can be converted into carbon.78,82 In general, the activity of N-doped nanocarbons derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is related to two aspects of their electronic structure: (i) the synergistic interaction of frontier π (nonbonding electrons on zigzag edges of nanographitic domains) and σ (lone pairs of zigzag edge nitrogen elements) orbitals, and (ii) the propensity of extended polyaromatic systems toward open-shell states.78–83 The role of (i) is related to the nonbonding and radical character of zigzag π electrons, which places them at the Fermi energy and enhances their ability to participate in reduction reactions (e.g., ORR, HER), and the potential for lone pairs of zigzag-edge N-atoms to act as binding/coordination sites for reaction intermediates. The role of (ii) relates to the tendency of extended polyaromatic systems to develop open-shell states along their zigzag edges, which could lead to the tendency of spin polarized electronic density to accumulate at zigzag edges.
Synthetic polymers now represent a major class of precursors for developing cutting-edge porous carbons. Among them, conjugated polymers have emerged as an attractive family of carbon precursors84 as their robust conjugated structure ensures a stable and efficient transformation of designed polymer architectures into desirable carbon nanostructures. Moreover, the heteroatom(s) (e.g., N, S, B, F, and P) dopants can be integrated into the carbon framework of C-MFECs directly by introducing the heteroatom-containing monomers for polymerization.71,84–87 As such, precise control of the composition and structure of C-MFECs at the molecular level are possible by using structurally well-defined conjugated porous networks (e.g., conjugated microporous polymers, covalent organic frameworks) as the polymer precursors.85 In these cases, polymerization is generally followed by carbonization through pyrolysis at high temperatures.71,88
For large-scale production at a lower cost, however, C-MFECs fabricated by low-temperature polymer processing are attractive. In this regard, hierarchical 3D sulfur-modulated holey C2N aerogels (C2NA) were fabricated by a simple amination and polymerization of chloroanilic acid through a template-free scalable method, followed by a thermal reduction process at 200 °C.72Fig. 6b and c schematically shows procedures for the preparation of the 3D holey S–C2NA bifunctional catalyst, along with the morphological details (Fig. 6d).72 The resultant S–C2NA exhibited an ultrahigh surface area of 1943 m2 g−1 and superb electrocatalytic activities (with an onset potential of 0.98 V and a limiting current density of 6.6 mA cm−2) towards ORR in 0.1 M KOH, which is superior to commercial Pt/C (with an overpotential of 0.96 V and a limiting current density of 6.0 3 mA cm−2) catalyst. Furthermore, this S-C2N aerogel demonstrated an overpotential of 0.3 V at 10 mA cm−2 current density for OER (0.1 M KOH), which is even better than the state-of-the-art OER catalyst (i.e., RuO2, 0.32 V). Besides polymers, carbon-based materials have also been fabricated at low temperatures from ionic liquids, ionomers, glucose, and other precursors.89–97 To achieve commercialization success. However, the conductivity of low-temperature generated carbon materials need to be further improved as is their mechanical resilience.
Metal–organic framework derived C-MFECs. 
Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF) derived C-MFECs have also been demonstrated to have a high specific surface area and efficient electrocatalytic performance.98 Various MOFs obtained from metal ions, and polyfunctional organic ligands have been proved to be ideal sacrificial templates for fabricating various carbon-based nanomaterials,99 including porous carbons and heteroatom doped porous carbons via thermal decomposition under controlled atmospheres.98–104 The C-MFECs prepared by MOF-templated precursors possess multiple advantages, including a high specific surface area, tailorable porosity, diversity in ordered 3D carbon architectures, and easy functionalization with other heteroatoms or metal/metal oxides to replace precious and nonprecious metal-based electrodes for electrocatalysis.99–101 For C-MFECs derived from MOF, the sublimation of Zinc species or acid treatment process are involved to remove the metal species. For instance, nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials (NPC-1000-ts) produced simply by pyrolyzing bio-MOF-1 precursor (Fig. 7a) outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH) in terms of overpotential, limiting current density, and long term stability,102 prompting more research activities along this direction.

Self-assembling. 
Self-assembling driven by π–π stacking or electrostatic interactions has been proven another effective route to efficient C-MFECs. In particular, a 3D interconnected carbon composite was prepared by low-temperature self-assembling g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) and CNTs into g-C3N4 NS-CNT (Fig. 7b and c), which exhibited comparable OER performance (onset potential = 1.53 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH) with more favorable kinetics and better durability than noble-metal based catalysts (e.g., IrO2–CNT and derivatives).105
In other investigations, C-MFECs based on 3D graphene assemblies have been developed.106,107 Of particular interest, a stable aqueous dispersion of polymer-modified graphene sheets was prepared via in situ reduction of exfoliated graphite oxides in the presence of cationic poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI).106 The resultant water-soluble PEI-modified graphene sheets were then used for sequential self-assembly with acid-oxidized multiwalled CNTs, forming hybrid carbon films with an interconnected network of carbon structures with well-defined nanopores, which have great potential as C-MFECs. As mentioned earlier, C60 has also been adsorbed (self-assembled) onto SWCNTs as an electron acceptor to induce intermolecular charge-transfer with the SWCNTs, forming a class of new C60-SWCNT based C-MFECs with photo-responsive trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for ORR, OER, and HER over a whole pH range (cf.Fig. 4a and b).46
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 
Like conventional catalysts, the catalytic activities of C-MFECs are controlled by the intrinsic catalytic activity of individual catalytic active centres (CACs), such as their dopant type, active domain size, and strength to interact with reactants, and also by the surrounding environments and the density of CACs within the catalytic unit and substrate architectures. The design of 3D porous structures, where more CACs are exposed for participation in catalytic reactions can further improve catalytic activities. Thus, high-performance C-MFECs could be achieved by not only precisely controlling the type and size of each specific CAC, but also by controlling the microstructures of the catalyst itself and/or its support (e.g., 3-D architecture, porosity) to enhance the density and distribution of the CACs within the overall C-MFEC. In this context, an innovative strategy of fabricating 3D graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) hollow fibers with radially aligned CNTs (RACNTs) seamlessly sheathed by a cylindrical graphene layer was conceived through a one-step CVD using an anodized aluminum wire template (Fig. 8a).36 By controlling the diameter of aluminum wire and anodization time, the length of the RACNTs and diameter of the graphene hollow fiber were well-tuned, enabling efficient energy conversion and storage. The RACNTs were connected to a graphene sheet of homogeneously distributed open holes, as shown by the TEM images in Fig. 8b–g. These fibers, with a controllable surface area, meso-/micropores, and superior electrical properties, demonstrated excellent counter-electrode properties in dye-sensitized solar cells, having a power conversion efficiency of 6.8% and outperformed their counterpart with an expensive Pt wire counter electrode by a factor of 2.5 (2.74% efficiency).36

To realize a mechanically resilient and robust 3D carbon architecture, researchers effectively sandwiched CNTs and graphene into freestanding sp2 all-carbon hybrids, rendering the excellent loading transfer in 3D framework (Fig. 8h–m).108 The millimeter-scale aligned CNT/graphene sandwiches could be repeatedly compressed at high strains (ε ∼ 490%), with a highest energy absorption density of 237.1 kJ kg−1, an ultrahigh power density of 10.4 kW kg−1, and remarkable efficiency of 83% during steady operation, providing novel nanocomposites with outstanding mechanical energy storage performance and promising to electrochemical catalytic applications.108 It was found that the roots of aligned, which anchored on the graphene sheets, provided such excellent loading transfer between graphene and CNTs at high-stress loading, and the compressive modulus could reach as high as 2.3 GPa before the collapse of the structure, exhibiting superiority over other conventional material like steel.108 Furthermore, seamless and covalently bonded 3D graphene/CNT hybrid material was also fabricated with the aid of an Al2O3 as a floating buffer layer in CVD.111 The CVD-generated sp2 graphene/CNT interlinked networks have an electrical conductivity of 29.3–43.4 S cm−1, which is attractive for electrocatalytic applications.109,111,112
On the other hand, one-step growth of CNTs on both sides of graphene (G/CNT hybrid) was achieved on FeMgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) sheets at a high temperature over 950 °C.110 In this particular case, the thermally stable Fe nanoparticles and the uniform structure of the calcined LDH flakes were essential for the simultaneously catalytic deposition of single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) and graphene (Fig. 8n and o). The robust connection between the CVD-grown SWCNTs and graphene ensured a high electrically conductive pathway for efficient electrocatalysis. Moreover, 3D carbon nanostructure comprising few-layer graphene (FLG) sheets inherently connected with CNTs through sp2 carbons, resembling plant leaves (FLGs) growing on stems (CNTs) was also synthesized by plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), as shown in Fig. 8p–r.110 Unlike a random mixture of CNTs and graphene sheets (CNT/G) with poor CNT/graphene interfacial contacts, this CNT/FLG structure has intrinsic chemical bonding between the two constituent components with low interfacial resistances attractive for C-MFEC applications. Other carbon-supported vertically-oriented carbon nanostructures, such as MWCNTs and carbon foams, have also been prepared as potential C-MFECs by microwave plasma-enhanced CVD.113–115
As CNT–graphene hybrids hold great promise for C-MFECs, a large variety of growth methodologies have been reported to develop CNT–graphene hybrids via intermolecular induced intersections between the individual CNTs and graphene sheets.116–119 Also, the CVD approach is often used for simultaneous heteroatom-doping during the carbon growth,21 though CVD-synthesis of controllable ordered CNT–graphene porous hybrids is still challenging.21,112,116–118 It is evident that the trend to use CNT–graphene hybrids with multidimensionalities and multifunctionalities as C-MFECs will continue.
Ball milling. 
As mentioned above, the heteroatom(s) doping and defect(s) incorporation in carbon skeletons of C-MFECs can impart electrocatalytic activities for efficient energy conversion and storage. However, it is also well known that the heteroatoms and/or defects presented in graphitic carbon lattices act as scattering centers for charge carriers (electrons, ions) to reduce the conductivity and hence the electrocatalytic activity.8,120 To address this issue, edge-doped graphitic carbon sheets with heteroatom(s) and/or defect(s) selectively at the edges have been developed to keep the basal plane dopant- or defect-free for retaining their excellent conducting properties. Ball milling has been widely used for such selective edge engineering,120–122 which is basically a mechanochemical method that can be used for simultaneous exfoliation of graphite flakes and doping the edges of graphene nanoplatelets (less than 10 graphene layers). Fig. 9 schematically shows the ball milling method to produce edge-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (EFGnPs) from the pristine graphite in the presence of the target dopants (X = nonmetals, halogens, semimetals, or metalloids).121 Specifically, the electron accepting/donating properties of the heteroatoms in EFGnPs can generate variations of the overall electron-charge densities on neighboring carbon atoms to promote electrocatalytic activities effectively. The as-prepared EFGnPs with superior characteristics have shown excellent performance in various applications, including fuel cells, solar cells, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries (LIBs), vanadium redox-flow batteries (VRFBs), flame retardants, to mention a few.123–129

3. C-MFECs for various electrocatalytic reactions
3.1. Recent advances in C-MFECs for ORR
C-MFECs have been most extensively researched for ORR, and tremendous progress has been achieved since the first C-MFECs (i.e., N-doped CNT) was discovered for efficient ORR performance in 2009.6 Since then, various C-MFECs, including CNTs, graphene, graphene foams, graphene quantum dots (GQD), edge doped graphene flakes, mesoporous carbons, graphene–CNT based hybrids, carbon onions, carbon nano-cones, graphene nanoribbons, carbon cages, hollow carbons, and even nanodiamonds doped, codoped or tridoped with N, S, B, F, P, Se, and/or O, have been demonstrated to show ORR electrocatalytic properties comparable to or even better than those of the Pt-based commercial catalyst, in terms of overpotential, onset potential, limiting current density, and long-term stability.4,5,10,21,63 Examples include, but not limited to, B/N-codoped C-aerogels,130 defect-rich-N-carbons,131 biomass-derived mesoporous carbons,132–135 N/F/S-tridoped graphene,136 N-hierarchically porous hollow C-tubes,137 N and P co-doped hollow carbon spheres,138 N-rich C-onion,139 MOF-derived heteroatom(s) doped porous carbons,140 covalent organic framework derived N/P-codoped carbons,141 supramolecular assisted synthesized N-3D carbons,142 CNTs encapsulated in N/P-codoped carbons,143 zigzag edged graphene nanoribbons,144 hard-template derived S/N-codoped porous carbons,145 B/N-codoped porous carbons,146 oxidizing-laser induced graphene,147 oxygen doped g-C3N4 for photo-enhanced ORR,54 N-doped carbon nanotube arrays on carbon fiber cloth,148 N-doped holey carbon/graphene hybrids,149 N-doped interconnected C-web,150 S–rGO,151 porous B/N-sheets,152 N/P-codoped porous carbon networks,153 polymer-derived N/P-codoped mesoporous carbons,154 B-GQDs,155 S/N-codoped holey carbon sheets,38 CNT-graphene based hybrid 3D nanostructured carbons,156 3D aerogel containing N-holey carbon sheets,72 N/P-codoped mesoporous C sheets,57 and carbide-derived N-carbon.157 In particular, critical efforts have been made to develop C-MFECs for ORR over a wide range of pH values and to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the CACs to guide the design and development of efficient C-MFECs of practical significance for reducing/replacing metal-based ORR electrocatalysts.130–159 The materials, preparation methods, and the specific performance of the reported C-MECs for ORR are summarized in Table 1. Since the research and development of C-MFECs for ORR have been comprehensively reviewed previously,5 only recent advances are addressed below.

3.1.1. Recent advances in morphological designing for ORR. 
As mentioned above, the use of advanced materials design and synthesis to control and integrate CACs into 3D porous carbon architectures is critical to strengthen the catalytic activities of C-MFECs. To achieve this goal, nitrogen-enriched aromatic polymers and colloidal silica with different diameter were employed as precursor and hard templates, respectively, to produce the N doped porous carbon nanospheres with tunable diameters and pore sizes. The controlled self-assembly behavior of colloidal silica enables the generation of assembled carbon nanospheres with hierarchical structure after the removal of the silica for substantially improving the accessibility of activity sites during electrochemical catalysis. The above resultant carbon-based materials, having a high surface area, suitable pore volume, and numerous N-induced active sites, showed the high ORR activity in alkaline media.166–168 The ideal C-MFECs promising for large-scale production have also been prepared by combining two strategies: the use of a 2D covalent organic framework (COF) and the development of a suitable template to guide the pyrolysis at 1000 °C (Fig. 10a–c).141 By this approach, nanosized 2D graphitic carbon sheets (PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000) with high conductivity, hierarchical micropores/mesopores, and abundant N-/P-doped heteroatom catalytic edges were generated. The resultant PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000 catalyst showed a lower onset potential, and hence better ORR performance than that of the Pt/C. Subsequent annealing in NH3 atmosphere at 900 °C doubled its surface area from 495 to 1160 m2 g−1, and further enhanced the ORR performance for the (PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3) catalyst over the Pt/C in terms of the onset potential (0 V vs. −0.03 V) vs. Ag/AgCl, half-wave potentials (−0.11 V vs. −0.16 V) vs. Ag/AgCl, limit current density (7.2 mA cm−2vs. 6.0 mA cm−2), Tafel slope (110 mV dec−1vs. 121 mV dec−1), long-time stability, and methanol tolerance in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, as exemplified by Fig. 10d. The PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 also exhibited fantastic OER electrocatalysis in 0.1 M KOH solution, attaining a current density of −10 mA cm−2 at only 0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl that is one order of magnitude higher than that of the Pt/C (1.01 mA cm−2). The observed excellent electrocatalytic properties could be attributed to its special morphology, mesoporous structure, high conductivity, and the presence of heteroatoms (N and P) containing graphitic carbon edges. These results clearly demonstrated that rational structural design could lead to advanced ORR electrocatalysis by C-MFECs.

Another typical example for structural modulation induced advancement in ORR performance is graphdiyne (GDY), a two-dimensional carbon allotrope featured by its sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms (Fig. 10e).160 The N-doped GDY was synthesized with pyridine and NH3 as the N sources and showed an electrocatalytic activity at a potential above −0.8 V, similar to that of the commercial Pt/C, towards ORR in alkaline solution with a higher stability and better methanol tolerance than those of Pt/C.161,162 More recently, N-doped few-layer graphdiyne (NFLGDY) was also synthesized with the N-doping moieties in the form of sp-hybridized N (sp-N) atoms (Fig. 10a), through pericyclic replacement of the acetylene groups.163 This method allowed for specific control of the doping site and proportion of sp-N atoms. As shown in Fig. 10f, XPS spectra confirmed the sp-N doping. Combined experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the site-specific sp-N atoms are beneficial for O2 adsorption for electrocatalytic ORR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.163 The optimal sp-N-doped FLGDY exhibited a catalytic activity comparable to that of the Pt/C, with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.87 V (0.86 V for Pt/C) and kinetic current density (Jk) of 38.0 mA cm−2 at 0.75 V in 0.1 M KOH, as well as better stability and methanol resistance than those of the Pt/C in both alkaline (0.1 M KOH) and acidic (0.1 M HClO4) solutions (Fig. 10g).163 This strategy to incorporate sp-N atoms into carbon materials in a controllable manner could open new opportunities for site-specific doping of other C-MFECs.


3.1.2. Recent advances in edge engineering for ORR. 
The edges and/or lattice-grain boundaries on graphitic carbons generally possess unpaired dangling bonds, adsorbed active functional groups, and/or trapped charges, facilitating charge transfer to improve the ORR performance.169–175 The enhanced electrocatalytic activity at graphitic carbon edges has been demonstrated by micro-electrochemical testing systems developed to measure the ORR activities precisely at the edge and basal-plane regions on the surface of freshly exfoliated HOPG sheets,169 Ar plasma-treated edge-rich carbon nanomaterials (graphene and CNTs),170 and the edge and basal selectively exposed graphitic layers.171,172 Exposed monolayer graphene edge demonstrated ORR activity almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the graphene basal plane in 0.1 M PBS solution containing 0.1 M KCl.171 Furthermore, chemical and/or physical doping heteroatoms at the graphitic lattice edges have been demonstrated to enhance the ORR electrocatalysis.41,174 For instance, edge-selectively sulfurized graphene nanoplatelets, obtained by ball milling graphite and sulfur powders together, exhibited about 4 times higher ORR electrocatalytic activities over the pristine graphite powder in 0.1 M KOH solution.41 Theoretical calculations have revealed that C–C bond distortions in the carbon skeleton could lead to strong O2 binding while spin density distribution along the B/N-codoped carbon edges plays a key role in enhancing the adsorption strength of O2 to facilitate the ORR electrocatalysis.176
More recently, Shui and co-workers have demonstrated that the zigzag edges of graphitic carbon lattices are more active than the armchair edges (Fig. 11a–d). In this particular case, MWCNTs were partially unzipped to obtain zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons with N doping and a carbon nanotube backbone (N-GNR@CNT) for ORR in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (Fig. 11e and f), showing a peak areal power density of 0.161 W cm−2 and a peak mass power density of 520 W g−1 superior to most non-precious-metal electrocatalysts.144 Furthermore, the zigzag carbon showed stability better than a representative iron–nitrogen–carbon catalyst in a H2–O2 fuel cell at 0.5 V. DFT calculations coupled with experimental observations revealed that a zigzag carbon atom is the most active site for ORR among several types of carbon defects on graphene nanoribbons in an acid electrolyte. Further to this study, it should be interesting to selectively functionalize the zigzag edges with heteroatoms for ORR electrocatalysis and beyond.

3.1.3. Vacancy, hole, and Stone–Wales defect for ORR. 
The second law of thermodynamics implies that a certain number of disorders or defects is unavoidable in crystalline materials,40 including carbon nanomaterials. As mentioned above (Section 2.3.2), these intrinsic structural and edge defects (pentagonal, defects at the zigzag edge, etc.) even in dopant-free nanocarbons can impart considerable ORR activities.67,144,177 Different types of defects (Fig. 12a–i),178 including single/multiple vacancies, lattice reconstructions, non-hexagonal topologies, and dangling groups,40,178–180 have been reported to promote adsorption as well as chemical and electrochemical activities.

The experimental demonstration of defect-induced electrocatalytic activities for C-MFECs was first reported in 2015 when high ORR activities were observed for defective carbon nanocages and graphene-nanoribbon-supported carbon quantum dots.164,177 Specifically, the defective carbon nanocages showed the ORR activity even better than that of the B-doped carbon nanotubes and comparable to that of the N-doped carbon nanostructures. Fig. 12j shows a typical TEM image of the carbon nanocone (CNC700), its ORR performance, and the theoretical onset potentials for different types of defects, respectively.177 The theoretical and experimental results confirmed that both zigzag edge defect and a pentagon defect were responsible for the high ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 12k); both induce inhomogeneous charge distributions, as is the case with heteroatom doping.165 Subsequently, an N-doped edge-rich graphene mesh (NGM) was fabricated by direct carbonization of sticky rice as the carbon precursor (Fig. 12l), melamine as a nitrogen source, and Mg(OH)2 as a template, leading to excellent ORR (Eonset ≈ 0.89 V, E1/2 ≈ 0.77 V, Id = 6.41 mA cm−2) and OER electrocatalytic activities.180 Theoretical investigation and experimental observation again revealed that a nitrogen-free configuration with adjacent pentagon and heptagon carbon rings exhibited the lowest overpotential with 0.14 V for ORR and 0.21 V for OER.180
To confirm the defect-associated active sites more elaborately, a micro-electrocatalytic testing apparatus was recently devised to experimentally identify the active site location(s) in defective HOPG (D-HOPG, obtained by doping pyridinic N (Pr-N) at the HOPG edges and removing the N atoms through annealing at 1100 °C in N2 gas atmosphere leaving behind pentagonal defects near the lattice edges) towards the ORR.67Fig. 12m shows a typical HAADF-STEM image identifying the pentagonal defects on the D-HOPG, which possessed the lowest work function estimated by AFM studies (Fig. 12n). As determined by the macro- and micro-electrochemical measurements coupled with the work function and DFT calculations, Fig. 12o shows that the edge pentagon defect was the major active site for the acidic (0.1 M H2SO4) ORR electrocatalysis, superior to that of Pr–N in N-doped HOPG.67 Moreover, a N–S–C coordination-structured active site, originated from the integrity of edged thiophene S, graphitic N, and pentagon defects, was reconstructed from N-modified S defects in carbon aerogel with a 3D hierarchical macro–meso–micro-porous structure.165 This material exhibited an outstanding ORR activity (e.g., half-wave potentials of 0.76 V in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M HClO4; and 0.85 V in 0.1 M KOH) with a good stability and high current density in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. A combined experimental and computational study revealed that the pentagon S defect is essential for the ORR in an acidic electrolyte.165 Although considerable progress on defective C-MFECs has been made,181 more fundamental studies on the defect structures (e.g., Stone–Wales defects, edges, or heteroatoms) and associated electrocatalytic properties are essential before their practical potentials could be realized.

3.2. Recent advances in C-MFECs for OER
Much like ORR is important to fuel cell technologies, OER is the heart for metal–air batteries and water splitting. Unlike ORR, however, OER generally produces a high overpotential, at which most of the transition and noble metal-based electrocatalysts are unstable. Even carbon nanomaterials used for the OER electrolytic reactions may be oxidized.8,21 So far, numerous research effort has been devoted to fabricating various efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts,21,131,182–199 including, but not limited to, vertically aligned CNTs,182 N-doped porous carbon,183 S-doped carbon,184 acid-oxidized carbon textiles (carbon cloth),185 F-doped carbon,186 graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4)/carbon nanofiber,187 3D porous C3N4/carbon micro-flowers,188 benzene derived-graphyne,189 carbon quantum dot/graphene heterostructures,190 graphene-supported N-doped carbon,191 PANi hydrogel derived N/P-codoped aerogel,71 N/S-codoped C3N4 sponges sandwiched with carbon nanocrystals,192 N/P-codoped carbon nanospheres,193 N/P-codoped covalent organic polymers,194 hard-template (SiO2) assisted N/P-codoped porous carbon,158 N/S-codoped graphitic carbon foams,195 sp-N and S codoped few-layer graphdiyne,196 phytic-acid-doped conductive hydrogels,197 P/S-codoped C3N4,198 defect-rich N-doped carbons,131,200–202 N-doped/O-functionalized/edge-defect-rich vertically aligned graphene,203 and stacked nanofilm (G–BNG) of pure graphene (G) on boron and nitrogen (BN)-codoped graphene (BNG).204 Some of them show the OER performance comparable or even superior to various commercially available noble metal-based electrocatalysts, such as Pt/C, IrO2, and/or RuO2, in terms of onset potential, overpotential, stability, current density, and/or selectivity. The materials, preparation methods, and the specific performance for most of the reported C-MECs towards OER are summarized in Table 2.

For instance, graphene-supported N-doped carbon (G@NC) with a high degree of N doping (Fig. 13a) was synthesized by in situ self-assembling a glucaminium-based ionic liquid on the pristine graphene under hydrothermal condition.191Fig. 13b and c shows the electrocatalytic OER performance of the G@NC along with its reaction energy for OER. This carbon based nanohybrid with a 2D structure showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 330 mV and a Tafel slope of 52.6 mV dec−1, both of which are among the lowest reported values for metal-free OER catalysts and are even lower than those of the Ir- and Ru-based catalysts.191 An good stability of G@NC was found after 10 h of chronopotentiometric testing at 10 mA cm−2 as the current density at 2.0 V decreased by only 6.9% after 800 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. The observed outstanding electrocatalytic performance was attributed to the high graphitic-N content assembled on graphene, which greatly increased CACs for the OER, and the pristine graphene support acted as cocatalyst significantly promoting the OER activity of the C sites adjacent to the graphitic N atoms (Fig. 13c).191

As mentioned above, N/P-codoping has also attracted considerable recent attention for efficient OER electrocatalysis.71,158,193,194,205,209 Theoretical studies have revealed that N and P atoms prefer to bond with each other, forming embedded N–P clusters in graphene. As shown in Fig. 13d–h, the N–P complex defects (NxCP1C and NxCP12C) are energetically more favored than individual NC and PC defects, suggesting that heterogeneous clusters might have been embedded in graphene.208 The ORR and OER performance of the N–P clusters can be finely tuned over a wide range by changing the N:P ratio. Fig. 13h shows that the OER catalytic activity can be optimized when the N:P ratio reaches ∼2 while the catalytic performance for ORR would be maximized at the N:P ratio of ∼3. Thus, the NxCP1C clusters in the graphene sheet show great potential in achieving efficient OER/ORR bi-functional electrocatalysis.208 In a good agreement with recent experimental observations, these results shed light on the microscopic understanding of the active sites in the N/P-codoped graphene for ORR and OER, providing insight into the controlled growth of effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.
Recently, certain C-MFECs have also been demonstrated to show OER property via intermolecular charge transfer. Fig. 14a–c shows the high OER performance and good stability for the C60/SWCNTs in an O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, whereas the OER performance of the pure C60 and SWCNTs were relatively low.46 Exposure of C60/SWCNTs to visible light (mercury lamp, 1 W cm−2) enhanced the ORR/HER/OER electrocatalytic activities in either an O2-saturated KOH solution or in a phosphate buffer solution. Another example can be found for a stacked nanofilm (G–BNG) of pure graphene (G) on boron and nitrogen (BN)-codoped graphene (BNG) with a total thickness of about 2–3 nm,204 the B and N dopants in the bottom layer influence the π-bonding environment in the top G layer (Fig. 14d), facilitating the effective electron/charge transfer for OER electrocatalysis, making the G–BNG film promising for advanced renewable energy conversion systems. G–BNG showed a superior OER performance and stability (lowest Tafel slope of 143.22 mV dec−1 and a small overpotential of 0.58 V along with 81.6% retention of the current density at 1.8 V vs. RHE after 50000 s of operation) to that of a stacked G–G layer, G–BG film, or G–NG film in 0.1 M KOH medium. Good OER performance with a small overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1, and long term stability of a 12 h for sustained operation at 10 mA cm−2 with a negligible current loss of <4% was also obtained for a GH-BGQD hybrid, in which B-doped graphene quantum dots (B-GQDs) were anchored onto the porous graphene hydrogel (GH) of a large surface area via π–π stacking to induce the intermolecular charge-transfer.206 In another study, a modified dip-coat-dry method was developed for fabricating a carbon cloth (PA–PPy/CC) coated with a conductive and porous hydrogel layer by simply dipping the carbon cloth into a polypyrrole (Py) solution with phytic acid (PA) and (NH4)2S2O8.197 As a result, the PA–PPy/CC delivered excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope of 54.9 mV dec−1, and 20 h long-term stability due to the fast charge transfer associated with the conductive PPy network and the efficient mass transport through the vesicular nanostructure that also has a large surface area for a maximum exposure of the active sites.

In addition, a metal-free 2D/2D heterostructure hybrid, composing of exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) and N-doped graphene (NG), was demonstrated to show efficient charge transfer for efficient OER (Fig. 14e) with a lower overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm−2, better than that of the individual EBP (>500 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and NG (430 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and even comparable to that of the commercial RuO2 (300 mV at 10 mA cm−2).207 Moreover, the resultant EBP@NG remained 95.7% current density after a stability test for 10 hours, which was superior to the commercial Ir/C. The enhanced electrochemical stability was attributed to the protection of the NG by the ultrathin EBP, and the enhanced OER activity was arising from the abundant activated carbon sites on the positively charged NG induced by charge-transfer with the EBP. Thus, excellent OER performance can be achieved by rational design and development of C-MFECs with desirable structures to facilitate the charge transfer.
3.3. Recent advances in C-MFECs for HER
The electrocatalytic HER (2H+ + 2e− → H2) provides an efficient and clean pathway for the mass production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting and requires highly active electrocatalysts.210–212 Although photoreduction of water to hydrogen catalysed by poly(p-phenylene) was reported in 1985,213 the first C-MFEC based on g-C3N4 coupled with N-doped graphene (Fig. 15a) was introduced in 2014 to replace the costly Pt-based catalysts for electrocatalytic H2 evolution.13 As seen from energy diagrams of the pure g-C3N4 and g-C3N4@NG in Fig. 15a–d from DFT calculations, HER properties of the g-C3N4@NG are originated from an intrinsic chemical and electronic coupling that synergistically promotes the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics.13 Furthermore, HER results shown in Fig. 15e and f indicates that g-C3N4 is a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for efficient HER in acidic electrolytes even compared with various metal-based HER electrocatalysts. Indeed, the g-C3N4@NG outperformed many transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the HER.214,215

As shown in Fig. 16a–c, the graphitic planes in g-C3N4 are constructed from tri-s-triazine units connected by planar amino groups, providing abundant edges and active sites with low conductivity.216–221 In order to reduce the high intrinsic electrical resistance in g-C3N4, heteroatom(s) functionalization and hybridization with highly conducting carbon nanomaterials/polymers have been produced for enhancing the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4.214–226 Examples include, but not limited to, carbon doped g-C3N4 (C-rich g-C3N4),214 C3N4 quantum dot and graphene hybrids (CNQDs@G),215 C3N4-based polymers,216 N-doped g-C3N4,219 S-doped g-C3N4,222 S/Se codoped g-C3N4,225 and polymeric C3N4.220,221,226

Along with the materials synthesis, comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies have also been performed to examine the effects of dopant components on the catalytic performance of g-C3N4-based C-MFECs. For this purpose, g-C3N4 monoliths with three types of dopant elements (B, P, and S) embedded in different sites (either C or N) of the C–N skeleton were rationally designed and synthesized (Fig. 16d–f).226 It was revealed that S atom acted as the best dopant while B and P elements deteriorated the HER activity for g-C3N4 monoliths. For the S-doped g-C3N4, a low onset potential of only −55 mV was required to efficiently implement the HER, and an operational current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved at −186 mV.226 Furthermore, the S-doped g-C3N4 exhibited the lowest charge-transfer resistance with the most favorable overall HER kinetics resulted from both the high intrinsic activity of individual CACs and abundant exposed catalytic sites.
Recent theoretical investigation has revealed the favorable configurations for C3N4 based materials towards HER. Generally speaking, a favored HER catalyst should feature a |ΔGH*| value around zero to allow for optimal adsorption/desorption kinetics.226 Compared with the pristine g-C3N4 (−0.19 eV), the B- and P-doped composites featured more negative ΔGH* values (−2.25 and −1.87 eV, respectively), indicating a more difficult desorption process of the H* species. In contrast, the S-embedded hybrid catalyst exhibited a desired ΔGH* value of −0.03 eV, which is even close to that of the well-known Pt-based catalyst (|ΔGH*| = 0.09 eV). As such, S-doped g-C3N4 acted as an n-type semiconductor, and the S-atoms introduced an impurity band near the conducting band minimum (CBM), and the electrons could be excited into the CBM even by thermal excitation, favorable for H+ to capture electrons.226 Therefore, the dopant components within the g-C3N4 had distinct and substantial effects on the overall electrocatalytic activities.
In another study, g-C3N4 was hybridized/coupled with nanoporous graphene codoped with S and Se (g-C3N4@S–Se-pGr) to synergistically promote the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics and to show attractive electrocatalytic performance, including an exchange current density of 6.27 × 10−6 A cm−2, an on-set potential of 0.092 V, a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1, and an adsorption free energy of −0.13 eV with a long-term cycling stability comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalysts in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.226 Furthermore, the theoretical volcano relationship between the overpotential and the descriptor ϕ was established, from which the most active dopants could be predicted, as shown in Fig. 16g and h. The S, Se, and O sitting at the summit of the volcano are expected to be the most active heteroatom dopants for g-C3N4.227 On the surface of the heteroatom(s) doped g-C3N4, the hybridized energy levels of the two atoms split into two groups: the bonding orbital and anti-bonding states with the antibonding state being essential for absorption by accepting electrons. Also, it was concluded that doping near the g-C3N4 edge is promising for developing highly active g-C3N4-based C-MFECs for HER.227
Very recently, a 2D/2D van der Waals heterostructure of phosphorene/g-C3N4 was fabricated to show an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H2 production activity of 571 μmol h−1 g−1 in 18 v% lactic acid aqueous solution due to the intimate electronic coupling at the 2D/2D heterojunction interface.228 Owing to its p-type semiconducting characteristics, Graphdiyne has also been used as a hole transport layer in photoelectrochemical H2 production from water.229 The GDY based photocathode evolved H2 with 90 ± 5% faradaic efficiency for stable operation over 12 hours.229
Apart from C3N4-based metal-free catalysts, a series of non-metal heteroatom(s) (e.g., N, P, S, B, F) doped/codoped carbon materials have also been studied both experimentally and theoretically for HER.220–240 Examples include, but not limited to, N-doped CNTs,230 N-carbon nanosheets,231 N-doped graphene microtubes,232 N-doped carbon framework and CNT hybrids,233 N-doped amine (–NH2) functionalized graphene,234 N-doped graphene quantum dot decorated graphite foam,235 N-doped plasma etched 3D graphene,236 N-doped porous carbon,237 B-doped graphene,238 Ni-foam template-synthesized S-doped 3D graphene foam,239 B/N-codoped carbon,240 CNTs modified with various functional groups,241 N/P-codoped nanoporous graphene,242 N/P-codoped carbon network,243 N/P-codoped carbon nanofiber network,244 N/P-codoped holey graphene,245 N/P-codoped porous carbon derived from bacterium,246 N/S-codoped carbon tubes,247 N/S-codoped nanoporous graphene,248 N/S-codoped porous graphene sheets,38 and N/S-codoped porous carbon fabricated from human hair.249 Besides, heteroatom-free carbon materials, such as graphene sponge,250 graphene networks with abundant sharp edges,251 and C-MFECs based on black phosphorus or oxidized black phosphorus nanosheets, have also been demonstrated to show promising HER performance.252,253 The materials, preparation methods, and the specific performance of the reported C-MECs for the HER are summarized in Table 3.

Along with heteroatom(s) doping discussed above, the introduction of edges, vacancies, and/or holes into C-MFECs has also been exploited to effectively enhance the electrocatalytic HER performance. For instance, a 3D N/P-codoped graphene electrode (3DNG-P, Fig. 17a) with a freestanding 3D porous architecture, high-level N-doping, and plasma-induced enriched defects was developed as a highly active C-MFEC for HER to show a low overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm−2, small Tafel slope of 66 mV dec−1, and large exchange current density of 0.11 mA cm−2 in an acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4, Fig. 17b).236 A favorable HER activity (Fig. 17c) and stability over a wide pH range (0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M PBS, and 1.0 M KOH) were observed.

Also, a one-step CVD strategy was developed for the controllable growth of a 3D graphene network consisting of a large number of sharp edge sites (Fig. 17d).251 The resultant metal-free and dopant-free 3D graphene network showed highly efficient electrocatalytic HER performance with an extremely low onset potential of ca. 18 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and good stability, which is much lower than that of certain heteroatom-doped C-MFECs and even comparable to those of transition-metal-hybrids.251 As can be seen in Fig. 17e, the 3D graphene network with sharp edges showed a much better HER performance than these of vertical graphene sheets on a planar Si, 2D graphene, Si substrate, SiOx nanowire network, and even close to that of the 20% Pt/C in 0.5 M H2SO4. The combined experimental and DFT analyses revealed that the excellent HER performance observed for the 3D graphene network was attributed to the presence of abundant edge sites, good conductivity, and seamless contact between the graphene sheets and the substrate (Fig. 17f). Combining with in-depth theoretical investigations, therefore, the strategic designing of C-MFECs for providing high conducting properties and CASs are essential for realizing advanced HER electrocatalysis comparable to those of noble metal-based precious catalysts. Similarly, N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs, ∼5 nm) were attached to a graphite foam (GF) by a facile hydrothermal route,235 and the obtained N-GQDs/GF composite acted as an ultra-active free-standing electrode for electrochemical HER and activation of peroxymonosulfate to degrade phenol pollutants, showing an overpotential of only 72 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 for electrochemical HER with a Tafel slope of 84 mV dec−1 and an onset potential similar to that of Pt catalyst.235Fig. 17g and h show TEM image and HER performance of the N-GQDs/GF electrode.235 Despite the considerable progress that has been achieved with C-MFECs for HER, a deeper mechanistic understanding is needed for further improvement of their electrocatalytic performance.254
Although great progress has been made, the development of effective C-MFCs for acidic electrolytes is still challenging. The ORR reaction pathways and mechanisms in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are different,255 and the Gibbs free energy on the C-MFECs (defective graphene) towards ORR in acidic mediums obtained through a computational approach is higher than that in alkaline conditions.256 Some researchers speculated the stability of certain N functional groups on the surface of C-MFECs is relatively weak in the acidic medium257 due to an insufficient number of ORR “active sites” on the C-MFECs in acid medium.258,259 However, it is believed that the catalytic performance could be largely improved by combining co/multi-doping with other effects (dopant type, dopant location, defective, and electrode structure). Indeed, high ORR activities in acid electrolyte were reported for new active sites of edged pentagon defects and with N, S dopants.165
To improve the activities of C-MFECs towards HER, the most commonly used method is to tune the electronic structure of C-MFECs by N doping.260,261 However, both experiments and DFT calculations revealed that single-N dopant in a six-membered ring of the carbon skeleton cannot tune the electronic structure of C-MFECs to obtain a favorable adsorption energy for H*.260 Recent combined experimental and DFT studies indicate that the most promising C-MFECs to achieve the performance of precious metal catalysts are 3D graphene network with sharp edge sites251 and porous carbon with dual graphitic N dopants in one six-membered carbon rings.261 The carbon atom bonded with two adjacent graphitic N atoms is beneficial for activating C–H bonds, thereby leading to a low Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (ΔGH*) for the significantly improved HER performance, overwhelmed those of most transition-metal-based and carbon-based catalysts, and even approached the benchmarks of precious metals.261 Therefore, controlling the morphology of carbon materials and the location of heteroatoms shows great promise for improving the catalytic HER activity of C-MFECs.
For the OER catalytic activity on C-MFECs, the common problem is the oxidation of the carbon materials under the potential during catalyzing processes.8,21 Nevertheless, the long-term stability of the C-MFECs is highly dependent on the quality of the carbon materials (e.g., graphitization degree, nature of the dopants and/or defects). Very stable OER electrocatalysts with a long-term stability and durability in whole pH region have been demonstrated for C-MFECs of high quality. Even under harsh conditions for OER in the water-splitting process, the high catalytic activity of C-MFECs can significantly reduce the overpotential to further stabilize the carbon electrodes. For instance, the nanohybrid of N-doped carbon supported on graphene with a high content of N doping showed small values of overpotential and Tafel slop, both of which are among the lowest reported values for OER C-MFECs and even those of the precious metals Ir-/Ru-based catalysts.188
3.4. C-MFECs for electrochemical transformation
As mentioned above, renewable energy technologies, such as batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting, can help solve current energy and environmental challenges. The aforementioned ORR, OER, and HER dominate the energy conversion and storage processes in these renewable energy technologies. These electrocatalytic reactions provide a facile and scalable solution to store energy in and retrieve energy from chemical bonds through the interconversion between chemical and electrical energy. In this regard, C-MFECs have recently been demonstrated to act as cost-effective, eco-friendly, and efficient photo-/electro-catalysts for numerous chemical transformations under ambient temperature and pressure, including two-electron transfer ORR to produce H2O2,7 NRR for the synthesis of ammonia at ambient conditions, CO2RR for direct conversion of CO2 into various hydrocarbon-based fuels and value-added chemicals, along with CO2 evolution from carbon for energy applications, and photo-/electro-chemical generation of chemicals powered by renewable energy (solar, wind, etc.).4,8,262–264

3.4.1. C-MFECs for nitrogen reduction (NRR). 
Ammonia (NH3), as a key precursor for fertilizer production, efficient hydrogen carrier as a clean fuel, and one of the essential industrial chemicals for both human beings and the earth's ecosystem, plays an indispensable role in the agricultural, plastic, and pharmaceutical and textile industries.265–268 Having twice volumetric energy density as compared to liquid hydrogen, NH3 is an ideal hydrogen carrier for efficient energy storage. There are three typical pathways to synthesize NH3: azotobacter nitrogen fixation (in nature by nitrogenase enzymes), Haber–Bosch process (industrial production), and electrocatalysis. The conventional Haber–Bosch process for NH3 production involves the reaction of H2 and N2 at high temperatures (350–550 °C) and under high pressure (150–350 atm). Among these pathways, the electrocatalytic production of NH3 through NRR is very promising as it is energy efficient and can be cost-effectively performed at ambient conditions.6,8,266 Traditionally, noble/transition metal-based catalysts are required to promote the electrocatalytic NRR. The high cost of the precious metal catalysts, coupled with their limited reserve, however, has precluded the electrochemical NRR from large-scale commercial applications. Furthermore, metal-based NRR electrocatalysts often suffer from multiple drawbacks, including (i) the adsorption energy of N2 molecules with most of the transition metals is too weak for activation towards NRR, and (ii) the d orbital electrons in most of the transition metals generally trigger the formation of metal–H bonds for initiating undesired HER, leading to a low faradaic efficiency (FE) for NRR. Thus, the NRR performance of transition metal catalysts need to be further improved, though several transition metals can paralyze the HER at appropriate potentials.8,269,270
Since 2018, certain C-MFECs have been demonstrated to show great potential as NRR electrocatalysts. For the high catalytic performance and selectivity, however, electrocatalysts must be rationally designed to optimize the mass transport, chemi(physi)sorption, and proton/electron transfer. For NRR, the main side reaction is HER, in which most protons or H2O in the system are reduced to H2 rather than NH3, leading to a poor selectivity.8,266 Extensive investigations have been conducted to improve the NRR performance of C-MFECs.8,271Fig. 18a schematically shows the NRR process,271 which involves two major fundamental mechanisms, namely the dissociative and associative pathways with different intermediates, along with an alternative associative distal pathway (Fig. 18b–d).265,271

So far, N-doped porous carbon derived from MOFs,17,272 B-doped graphene,273 defect rich polymeric C3N4,274 B-doped BN edges,275 defect abundant carbon cloth,276 black P nanosheet decorated g-C3N4,277 S-dots/graphene nanohybrid,278 O-doped graphdiyne,279 N-doped heterocyclic carbine,280 P-doped C3N4 with surface N vacancies,281 N/P-codoped multilayer graphene,282 N/P-codoped porous carbon,283 polyaniline,284 and N-doped carbon nanospikes have been utilized for efficient electrocatalytic NRR in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes.285 In particular, a highly textured C-MFEC, consisting of N-doped carbon nanospikes (CNS, Fig. 19a), was developed for electrochemically reducing dissolved N2 gas to ammonia in an aqueous electrolyte under ambient conditions, showing a FE of 11.56 ± 0.85% at −1.19 V vs. RHE and maximum production rate of 97.18 ± 7.13 μg h−1 cm−2 (Fig. 19b and c).285 This catalyst has a surface composed of sharp spikes, which concentrates the electric field at the tips to promote the electroreduction of dissolved N2 molecules near the electrode.

Furthermore, B-doped graphene (BG) with different boron structures were rationally designed and synthesized to enhance the adsorption of N2 in an aqueous solution (0.05 M H2SO4) at ambient conditions (Fig. 19d).273 With a doping level of 6.2%, BG achieved an NH3 production rate of 9.8 μg h−1 cm−2 and an relatively good FE of 10.8% at −0.5 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. 19e. The observed remarkable NRR activity is attributed to the doping-induced charge polarization to positively charge the B atoms due to the larger electronegativity of carbon (2.55) than that of boron (2.04). DFT calculations revealed the reaction pathway in the acidic electrolyte to be N2 → N2* → NNH → N* + NH3(g) → NH* → NH2* → NH3* → NH3(g).8,273 Furthermore, the lower reaction energy barrier for the rate-determining step (N* → NH*) on BC3 (0.43 eV) than that on BCO2 (1.04 eV) and BC2O (1.30 eV) makes BC3 (see, Fig. 19d for the structure and electron distribution) most favorable among these B-doped carbon materials for electrocatalytic NRR.
In another related but independent study, S-dots and graphene nanohybrid (SDG) was fabricated and utilized as a metal-free electrocatalyst for ambient N2-to-NH3 conversion with an excellent selectivity.278 This electrocatalyst, when operated in 0.5 M LiClO4, exhibited a high NH3 yield of 28.56 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and a FE of 7.07% at −0.85 V vs. RHE, along with excellent electrochemical stability (Fig. 19f).278 N-doped C-MFECs have also been adapted for efficient NRR, DFT calculations revealed the preferable pathway for ammonia synthesis (*NN → *NHNH → *NH2NH2 → 2NH3) in an alkaline medium (e.g., 0.1 M KOH) and found that the NRR on pyridinic (0.45 eV) and pyrrolic N (0.56 eV) sites were energetically more favorable than the graphitic N sites.8,272
Certain defect engineering strategies have also been demonstrated to be efficient for imparting high NRR performance to the metal-free polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. In particular, nitrogen vacancy (NV) defects were controllably introduced onto PCN to produce tunable NVs contained PCN (denoted as: PCN-NVx, x represents the re-calcination hours in Ar). For PCN-NVx, the NH3 yield was 8.09 μg h−1 mgcat−1, and the FE is 11.59% (Fig. 20a and b).274 As shown in Fig. 20c–f, DFT calculations revealed that dinitrogen molecules could be chemisorbed on as the engineered nitrogen vacancies of PCN through constructing a dinuclear end-on bound structure for spatial electron transfer from adjacent C atoms.274 Furthermore, the NN bond length of adsorbed N2 increases dramatically, facilitating the activation process for electrocatalytic reduction of N2 into NH3.

The NRR reaction selectivity can also be effectively improved by using an electrolyte with a limited proton transfer rate and increased solubility of N2. Thus, the NRR electrolyte selection is also important. Two main types of electrolytes, namely the liquid and solid states, have been used for electrocatalytic NRR. A strong correlation between the solubility of N2 in the electrolytes and the NH3 production rate has been observed for various liquid electrolytes, including aqueous KOH, aqueous HCl, aqueous Li2SO4, and mixed alcohol/water.271 On the other hand, solid-state electrolytes, especially Nafion membranes as the solid H+ conductors, were demonstrated to be promising for enhancing the mass transfer of N2 toward the catalyst surface and inhibiting the occurrence of the HER, thereby effectively overcoming the low conversion and FE for NRR.266–268 To achieve high-performance NRR for C-MFECs. Therefore, appropriate electrolytes should be used, and the electrolytic NRR cell should be carefully constructed.269,270


3.4.2. C-MFECs for carbon dioxide conversion. 
The overuse of fossil fuels has caused excessive CO2 emissions, leading to severe environmental pollution and global warming, along with the associated climate change and sea-level rise.286–288 Therefore, it is important to reduce the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration by, for example, directly convert CO2 into fuels and/or commodity chemicals. In this context, CO2RR provides an attractive option to convert waste carbon emissions into valuable products. In fact, numerous chemicals can be produced from CO2, including alcohol, oxygenates, and synthesis gas (syngas). The use of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, and hydroelectric) to power electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals could also address the non-dispatchable issue of renewable energy by providing energy storage in chemical bonds.262 As such, CO2 fixation is recognized to be a much-needed component of a carbon-neutral energy strategy. Indeed, sunlight-driven conversion of CO2 to fuels is a particularly attractive means to store intermittent solar energy in the form of C–C and C–H bonds within C1–C3 hydrocarbons.289–292
There are various methods for CO2 conversion and utilization, including thermocatalytic, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysts.286,287,293,294 Although the thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into commodity chemicals or fuels aligns well with the current industrial reactor infrastructures, this energy-intensive process involves an elevated operation temperature (>200 °C) and a high pressure of ∼1 MPa with a low CO2 conversion efficiency.287 Furthermore, this process requires excessive H2 supply beyond the product stoichiometry as H2 is used as a reducing agent.294–296
Compared to the harsh thermochemical hydrogenation, the electrochemical conversion of the CO2 process is operated at ambient conditions and easy to scale up.286,287,293,297–302 Furthermore, electricity generated from renewable sources, such as solar, tidal, wind, and geothermal energy with a foreseen low price, can enable an energy transition from fossil fuel to a renewable energy powered electrocatalysis.286,287 Besides, water can be used as the proton source for CO2RR so that the external H2 supply is disregarded, more importantly, the CO2RR can enable to store intermittent renewable and off-peak electricity into chemicals and fuels, such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), formate (–COOH), methanol (CH3OH), ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (C2H5OH), and propanol (C3H7OH) with a high energy density and a big market potential, as shown in Fig. 21.302

As shown in Fig. 22a–c, the electrochemical CO2 splitting and conversion are generally carried out in single-, two-, and three-compartment electrolyzers.299 Single compartment cell is free from ohmic loss while the two-compartment set-up keeps the two electrodes to support separated reactions, which is suitable to examine the mechanism for CO2RR in a low CO2 environment.303 The three-compartment electrolyzer with flow gas and electrolyte (flow cell) is introduced to achieve a high production rate for CO2 electrolysis (Fig. 22d).303 However, the linear molecule CO2 is stable and chemically inert with a low electron affinity. As such, CO2 transformation is dominated by nucleophilic attacks at the carbon atom, which is an uphill process requiring a substantial input of energy (∼750 kJ mol−1 for the dissociation of the “CO” bond).286,287,293,297–300 Furthermore, CO2RR often occurs in an aqueous electrolyte, in which CO2 dissolves very poorly at acidic or neutral pH values. Therefore, various homogeneous and/or heterogeneous catalysts have been used to accelerate this kinetically slow reduction reaction. So far, major efforts have been made to develop heterogeneous electrocatalysts, including (bi-)metals, metal oxides and sulfides, organic frameworks, and C-MFECs, for CO2RR.286,287,293,297–302

(e) Bioelectrocatalytic pathways toward long-chain chemicals: syngas could be synthesized from CO2RR with a high selectivity by Ag- or Au-based catalysts (top left). Alternatively, CO2 can be converted into hydrocarbon and oxygenate chemicals using Cu-, Sn-, or Pd-based catalysts (bottom left), which can then be used as inputs for genetically engineered enzymes and bacteria to convert to more complex products.

Unlike metal-based catalysts, the carbon-based nanostructures naturally break the scaling relationship between the adsorption of reaction intermediates and related activation energies,287 thereby, C-MFECs are promising to reduce the overpotential for efficient CO2RR. Indeed, heteroatom-doped C-MFECs in various architectures with sp2 and/or sp3 hybridization have exhibited good performance for CO2RR, yielding C2 and CO products with a FE up to and even above 90% at a decent overpotential comparable to that of Cu and Ag-/Au-based catalysts, respectively.4,287 Besides, the heteroatom-doped C-MFECs with covalent chemical bonds between the carbon base and dopant atoms should have no segregation issue, leading to a good stability, whereas metal nanoparticles often suffer segregation problems during CO2RR. Therefore, C-MFECs are promising catalysts for CO2RR.
In 2013, N-doped carbon nanofiber (N-CNF) was used as the first C-MFEC for CO2RR to carbon monoxide (CO).16 The N-CNF demonstrated a current density 13 times higher towards CO2RR compared to the bulk Ag catalyst, demonstrating the promise for C-MFECs to replace costly metal-based electrocatalysts.16 Subsequently, considerable efforts have been devoted to CO2RR by C-MFECs to consistently show comparable or even superior efficiency to metal electrodes.4,8 In this context, N-CNF, N or B doped diamonds as well as B/N-codoped diamond have been examined for efficient CO2RR.304 There are many sequential reaction pathways for converting CO2 to chemicals/fuels, such as single- (C1) or multi-carbon (C2+) oxygenates and hydrocarbons. Leveraging these reaction sequences, one approach is to first convert CO2 into stable intermediate species that can be further upgraded to the desired product(s) using biocatalysts (e.g., enzymes, bacteria), as shown in Fig. 22e.262–265,305
Since the report on the first C-MFEC (i.e., N-CNF) for CO2RR in 2013,16 numerous N-doped C-MFECs having different structures have been developed to show efficient CO2RR activities comparable or superior to those of metal-based electrocatalysts, leading to various value-added chemical products. Examples include, but not limited to, N-doped nanocarbon,306 N-CNT and ultrathin carbon nanosheet hybrid,307 N-doped carbon wrapped CNT (CN-CNTs),308 N-rich C3N4 nanotubes,309 MOF derived N-doped porous carbon,310 N-doped CNTs,311,312 N-doped CNT penuts,313 N-doped porous carbon derived from coal,314 N-doped graphene foam,315 N-doped diamond,316 N/F-codoped holey carbon sheets,317 N/P-codoped fullerene-like carbon,318 N-doped graphene and CNT hybrid,319 N/S-codoped porous carbon nanofiber,320 S-doped and S/N-codoped polymer derived carbons,321 F-doped carbon,322 B/F/N-tridoped carbon,323 defect-rich graphene and carbon,324,325 graphitic and polymeric C3N4,326,327 C3N4/CNT composite,328,329 and 3D C3N4 based materials.330 Nevertheless, the role of different heteroatom species (such as graphitic N, pyridinic N, pyrrolic N) played306,308 and the effects of topological defects and edge defects (zigzag and armchair edges) on CO2RR require further studies.
To optimize the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance, Cui et al., developed a steam etching strategy to tune the nitrogen dopant types and levels.308Fig. 23a–f shows the fabrication procedures for CN-CNTs and their “N” type transformation via steam etching. It was found that H2O molecules prefer to bind to carbon atoms around graphitic and pyridinic “N”, leading to selective etching. After the steam etching, therefore, pyrrolicN became the majority nitrogen form (increased from 22.1 to 55.9% among the total N species) in the nitrogen-doped carbon network (designed as: CN-H-CNT) to act as the CACs for preferential CO2RR over HER to efficiently produce CO. As shown in Fig. 23b, the steam-etched CN-H-CNT catalyst showed excellent CO2RR performance while suppressed the HER activity with a maximum faradaic efficiency of ∼88% for the formation of CO under −0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 23g and h).308

Furthermore, a facile and scalable route for producing N,S-codoped hierarchically porous carbon nanofiber (NSHCF, Fig. 23i) membranes (ca. 400 cm2 membrane in a single process) has been reported recently.320 DFT calculations attributed the observed outstanding CO faradaic efficiency to the presence of codoped pyridinic N and carbon-bonded S atoms, which effectively decreased the Gibbs free energy of the key *COOH intermediate (Fig. 23j). The flexible free-standing NSHCF membranes were, which could be used directly as cathodes, efficient for electrochemical CO2RR with a 94% faradaic efficiency and ∼103 mA cm−2 current density for CO production at a catalyst load of only about 1.2 mg (Fig. 23k and l).320 As can be seen in Fig. 23m and n, the faradaic efficiency for CO production increased with increasing potential from −0.3 to −0.7 V and reached its maximum value of 94% at −0.7 V vs. RHE, along with a significantly dropped H2 faradaic efficiency from 67% at −0.3 V vs. RHE to 6% at −0.7 V vs. RHE.320 Furthermore, hierarchically porous structures of the NSHCF membranes maximized the exposure of active sites for CO2RR, leading to the ultra-high current density.310 Coupled with appropriate heteroatom(s) doping and advanced morphological characteristics, therefore, the pyridinic-N dopant could promote an efficient CO2RR to produce CO with a high faradaic efficiency. The pyridinic N with a lone pair in its σ orbital could act as a Lewis base site to enhance the CO2 adsorption.66,67,287 However, the graphitic N is not favorable for CO2 binding because its electrons only fill the π* antibonding orbital.287
To demonstrate the feasibility of replacing precious metal catalysts without sacrificing the CO2RR activity or selectivity, a pyrolyzed carbon nitride and MWCNT composite were fabricated to exhibit a high selectivity for production of CO over H2 (approximately 98% CO and 2% H2) with a high activity even in an electrochemical flow cell.329 Furthermore, the CO partial current density at intermediate cathode potentials (V = −1.46 V vs. Ag/AgCl) is up to 3.5 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art Ag nano-particle-based catalysts with the maximum current density as high as 90 mA cm−2. This carbon-based catalyst has a mass activity and energy efficiency (up to 48%) higher than those of the Ag nanoparticle counterpart. Similar results have also been reported for a N-CNF catalyst, which demonstrated approximately 98% CO production efficiency and a maximum current density (∼3.5 mA cm−2) 13 times higher than that of the bulk Ag catalyst towards CO2RR, demonstrating a promising possibility for C-MFECs to replace costly metal-based CO2RR electrocatalysts.16
Apart from C-MFECs based on CNTs and graphene for CO2RR, electrochemical CO2RR studies on N-doped nanocrystalline diamonds (NDC) revealed that the incorporation of N atoms enhanced catalytic activity of both NDC-1 (diamond-like) and NDC-4 (graphitic) in reducing CO2 to CO.316 As expected, the catalytic activity enhancement by N incorporation was much more dramatic in sp2-carbon (graphitic) structures when compared to the grain boundary mediated sp3-carbon (diamond-like) structures. In NDC-1, the FE for CO generation is limited to ∼10% with HER dominating over CO generation, whereas NDC-4 shows a FE up to 82% with an excellent activity and selectivity for CO2RR to CO.316 More interestingly, nanodiamond (sp3-C hybridized) based electrode fabricated by N-doping nanodiamond/Si rod array (NDD/Si RA) was demonstrated to be efficient for CO2RR to acetate331 to preferentially convert CO2 into acetate over formic acid with an onset potential of −0.36 V and a faradaic efficiency of 91.2–91.8% at −0.8 to −1.0 V, effectively overcoming the usual low-selectivity limitation for C2 production. Electro-kinetic data and in situ infrared spectra revealed the main pathway for CO2RR to acetate: CO2 → CO2˙− → (COO)2˙ → CH3COO−.
In view of the high energy value of formic acid, considerable efforts have been made to develop various C-MFECs for CO2RR to formic acid. For instance, B-doped diamond was utilized for electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid with a faradaic efficiency as high as 95% in an aqueous solution of RbBr,332 It was demonstrated that large cations (e.g., K+, Rb+, and Cs+) could give a high faradaic efficiency for the formic acid production whereas small cations (Li+ and Na+) promoted HER instead of CO2RR. This is because of the buffer effect by large cations to suppress the increase in pH near the cathode and to maintain the high concentration of CO2 molecules near the cathode. In another study, the same research group performed the CO2RR to HCOOH in a flow cell with boron-doped diamond, demonstrating a faradaic efficiency as high as 94.7% and a selectivity as high as 99% for the production of formic acid with a stable operation for 24 hours.333 At a current density of 15 mA cm−2, the rate of production increased to 473 μmol m−2 s−1 with a faradaic efficiency of 61%. These values of the faradaic efficiency and the production rate are comparable or even superior to those achieved by Sn and Pb electrodes.333
In addition to nanodiamond-based C-MFECs for CO2RR to formic acid and formates, other examples include, but not limited to, B-doped graphene,334 phenyl functionalized C3N4,335 N-doped nanoporous carbon and CNT composites,336 N-doped graphene,337 and N-doped PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, N-C61), which exhibited an excellent activity toward CO2RR for formate production with a high FE of 91.2% and good stability at a moderate overpotential of 0.7 V.338 A partial formate current density (jHCOO−) of 14.7 mA cm−2 was observed at −1.1 V vs. RHE, which is higher than that of several C-MFECs.338Fig. 24b and c shows the synthesis procedure for N-C61 and its performance for CO2RR to formate.338 As shown in Fig. 24d, a theoretical study has suggested that graphitic N-defects were most likely the CACs for formate formation.338 Nevertheless, it has also claimed that the pyrrolic N sites on graphene were CACs for CO2 conversion to formic acid owing to its lower overpotential (0.24 V) than that of other N-doping configurations on graphene.339

While B-doped diamond exhibited a high efficiency for CO2RR to formic acid production (Fig. 24e) as mentioned earlier,333 the B/N-codoped nanodiamond (BND) acted as an efficient and stable CO2RR electrode for C2 production of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) from CO2,340 which remained very challenging for the existing electrocatalysts due to their low activity, poor product selectivity and stability. For the BND catalyst, a good ethanol selectivity was achieved with a high faradaic efficiency of 93.2% (−1.0 V vs. RHE), which overcame the limitation of a low selectivity for multicarbon value fuels.340Fig. 24f shows the morphology of a representative BND surface with abundant grain boundaries, while Fig. 24g displays the faradaic efficiency of ethanol production for BND3 with 10% N in comparison with other catalysts.340 DFT calculations revealed the possible pathway for CO2RR towards ethanol: CO2 → *COOH → *CO → *COCO → *COCH2OH → *CH2OCH2OH → CH3CH2OH, in which the *COCO formation occurred easily on B dopants. Combined experimental analyses and DFT calculations indicated that the superior activity and selectivity of BND for CH3CH2OH production are mainly originated from the synergetic effect of B and N co-doping, the high content (up to 10%) of specific N–sp3C dopants, and the strong suppression of the competitive HER.340
Recently, various heteroatom(s) doped C-MFECs have also been reported for efficient photocatalytic CO2RR in addition to electrocatalytic CO2RR. In particular, g-C3N4 hybridized with different heteroatom-doped graphene materials were theoretically investigated for their catalytic CO2RR toward the production of deeply reduced hydrocarbons.335,341–349 It was revealed that the eight-electron reduction processes to CH4 are thermodynamically preferred on C3N4/N–G with a relatively low overall free energy change.341 Furthermore, phenyl grafted g-C3N4 was investigated for methane and formic acid production through CO2RR with a high yield,335 along with g-C3N4 for CO2 conversion to phenol,342 azine-based covalent organic frameworks (COF) as photocatalysts for CO2RR with H2O to CH4 and also for CO2 cyclic-addition to form cyclic carbonates,343,344 N-doped mesoporous carbon for ethanol production,345 N-doped carbon layer for artificial photosynthesis of CO,336 N-doped GO for ethanol and acetone production,347 and S/N-codoped nanoporous carbon electrode for efficient CO and CH4 production.348 In addition to pyridinic N, the thiophenic S was found to show a high catalytic activity and FE for CO formation.348 Moreover, N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) were demonstrated to be effective for converting CO2 into multi-carbon products at high FEs, high current densities, and low overpotentials.349 The NGQDs showed a high total FE (up to 90%) for CO2RR with a selectivity for ethylene and ethanol conversions reaching 45%. The C2 and C3 product distribution and the production rate for NGQD-catalyzed CO2RR were comparable to those obtained with copper nanoparticle-based electrocatalysts.349
Owing to their high specific surface area, chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural diversity, various porous organic polymers (POPs) have been reported for selective CO2 adsorption towards efficient CO2 fixation and conversion.350 CO2 fixation and conversion on conducting polymers can be tracked back in 1992.351 POPs synthesized from large varieties of reactive monomers via simple and convenient chemical routes could be ideal adsorbents for CO2 storage and fixation. A wide range of POPs have been synthesized from different multidentate amines, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, or triazine monomers through polycondensation reactions or solid-state condensation reactions, as shown in Fig. 25.350 Ease of synthesis, uniform pore width and surface basic sites (nitrogen and other heteroelements) play a crucial role in the CO2 absorption and conversion reactions. Therefore, the design and synthesis of porous polymer networks bearing a high concentration of heteroelements could be very useful not only for enhancing the CO2 uptake, but can eventually help to promote the CO2RR for the synthesis of value-added organic fine chemicals and fuels in an efficient way. This could lead to the solution for problems of low reactivity and efficiencies associated with heterogeneous catalysis for CO2 conversion.

CO2RR has attracted considerable research attention for producing value-added fuels and commodity chemicals. Recently, a general sol-pyrolysis process was developed to directly produce N-doped carbon nanomesh sheets from captured CO2 in ethanolamine solution.352 Construction of the C–S bond using CO2 as a C1 feedstock was also demonstrated as a green route for the synthesis of S-containing compounds and is of great significance.353 Apart from heterogeneous electrocatalysts discussed above, metal-free homogeneous electrocatalysis has also been adapted for efficient CO2RR to produce CO,354 methylamines,355 formate,356 methanol,357 methane,358 and methoxyborane.359Fig. 26 summarizes different proposed pathways toward various CO2RR products.302 Further advances in the mechanistic understanding of CO2RR are essential in order to move away from the current trial-and-error paradigm to achieve the accelerated and rational design of C-MFECs.

CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) through carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation by C-MFECs is also essential to producing the raw material (CO2) required for CO2RR electrocatalysis. Also, such CO oxidation to generate CO2 is well known as a water gas shift reaction.360 Recently, N-doped penta-graphene has been proposed to be an ideal C-MFEC for CO2ER through CO electrochemical oxidation.361 Furthermore, the exploitation of CO2RR and CO2ER in energy storage systems using C-MFECs represents an alternative approach towards clean recycling and utilization of CO2.362–364 In this regard, rechargeable metal-CO2 batteries (with Li, Na, K or Mg anodes) using different C-MFEC cathodes are very promising and being extensively explored recently (vide infra).362–370


3.4.3. CMFECs for H2O2 production reaction (H2O2PR). 
Renewable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production represents one of the iconic examples of electrochemical transformations. This simple inorganic molecule embraces a vast number of diversified applications, including as a green oxidizer for cleaning, bleaching products for cosmetic (e.g., hair) as well as the paper and pulp industries, fuel to power a rocket, and a clean energy carrier to run automobiles, making H2O2 a very versatile and multifunctional chemical related to a market of almost 4 billion dollars and projected to reach 6 billion by 2023.371–375 However, the industrial production of H2O2 still relies on a very energy-intensive synthetic process called the anthraquinone process that involves a multistep sequence consisting of a hydrogenation step over Pd catalyst, followed by oxidation and extraction, generating organic wastes from inefficient oxidation of the anthraquinone.373,376 In view of the importance of H2O2 mentioned above, there is a recent surge of interest in developing simple and sustainable protocols for cost-effective electrocatalytic/photocatalytic syntheses of H2O2 at ambient conditions.14,377–419 Nevertheless, catalysts based on precious noble metals (Pd, Pt, etc.), transition metals (Ag, etc.), metal oxides (e.g., BiVO4), bimetallic alloys (Pd–Hg) are required for the traditional electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 from ORR with a low yield, but a high energy consumption and H2 supply.382,384 In this context, C-MFECs are very promising as efficient and stable electrocatalytic/photocatalytic electrode materials for H2O2PR as ORR via a two-electron pathway can lead to efficient electro-/photo-synthesis of H2O2.380–382,384
Recently, numerous C-MFECs have been reported for efficient electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2O2PR. Examples include, but not limited to, C-dots,385 hierarchical porous carbons,386 defective carbon materials,387 fully or partially reduced graphene oxide-based C-MFECs,382,388–390 O-doped CNTs,7 edge-rich O-doped nanocarbons,391 lattice defect-rich O-doped graphene,392 activated carbon black cathode recycled from a zinc-air battery (ZAB),393 redox-active cationic covalent triazine networks,394 PEDOTs,395 activated porous carbon fibers,396 N-doped porous carbon derived from biomass,397 N-doped mesoporous carbon,398 N-doped graphitic C-nanohorns,399 ionic-liquid derived N-doped porous carbons,400 hard-template (SBA-15 silica) assisted N-doped orderly porous carbons,401 other N-doped porous carbons,14,402 N-doped graphene,403 F-doped porous carbons,404 C and N vacancy abundant g-C3N4,405,406 halogen-doped C3N4,407 holey C3N4,408 phosphate modified g-C3N4,409 defect containing C3N4,410,411 BN quantum dot and g-C3N4 hybrids,412 pyromellitic diimide (PDI) doped g-C3N4 and rGO hybrids,413 PDI-doped g-C3N4/BN/rGO hybrids,414 black P and polymeric-C3N4 hybrids,415 P-doped CNTs,416 N/S-codoped porous carbons,417,418 and N/P/Otridoped carbons derived from biomass.419 Among various N-doped defective C-MFECs, N-doped graphene derived from oxo-G with the lowest in-plane carbon lattice defects exhibited the highest H2O2 selectivity of >82% in 0.1 M KOH solution.392
Of particular interest, a highly efficient C-MFEC with abundant active and oxygenated graphitic edge sites (Fig. 27a and b) was prepared through the infiltration of an aromatic carbon precursor into mesoporous silica of a hexagonal mesostructure, followed by graphitization and then removal of the silica template.391 The mesopores in the silica template acted as nanoreactors, within which confined graphitization generated nano-sized graphite, while the silica framework, upon the removal, was transformed into mesopores. The resultant edge-rich orderly mesoporous carbon (GOMC) catalyst exhibited ca. 28 times higher activity and a H2O2 selectivity over 90% for H2O2PR than the basal plane-rich carbon nanotubes. The optimized nanocarbon catalyst showed a very high H2O2PR activity, surpassing previously-reported catalysts in alkaline media.391 Moreover, it can stably produce H2O2 for 16 h with a FE reaching 99% (Fig. 27c) and an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 24 ± 2 mM due to a fast electron transfer for the oxidized and edge-rich carbon nanocatalysts.391 This work provides an important guideline for the design and development of highly efficient carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2PR.

In another study, graphitized N-doped single-walled carbon nanohorns (CNHs) were fabricated for electrocatalytic H2O2PR with a high selectivity and FE.399Fig. 27d schematically shows the CNH structure and the associated H2O2PR mechanism.399 This catalyst was very efficient in acidic pH with a FE of about 98% and also showed excellent H2O2PR activities at either physiological or alkaline pH (Fig. 27e and f). Moreover, the very positive onset potentials observed at three different pH values (+0.40, +0.53, and +0.71 V at pH 1.0, 7.4, and 13.0, respectively), along with its good stability and excellent reproducibility, made this CNH material a benchmark catalyst for metal-free ORR to produce H2O2.399
Another attractive option to produce H2O2 is artificial photosynthesis by converting solar energy into chemical energy.414 For this purpose, g-C3N4 was functionalized by PDI and then hybridized with both BN and rGO nanosheets to fabricate g-C3N4–PDI/BN/rGO nanocomposites to produce H2O2 from water and O2 in the ambient atmosphere under visible light.414 In this case, BN and rGO acted as the trapping sites for the holes and electrons, respectively, on the photoexcited g-C3N4/PDI moiety to enhance the water oxidation and selective two-electron reduction of O2. This resulted in an efficient H2O2 production with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.27%, which was higher than that achieved by overall water splitting with powdered catalysts.414
To demonstrated the possible use of renewable energy as the power source for electrocatalytic production of H2O2, a self-powered system based on a Zn–air battery using the oxygenated activated carbon black (aCB) C-MFEC cathode was constructed to simultaneously produce electricity and H2O2, as shown in Fig. 27g–i.393 The battery with a power density of 360 W mgeo−2 at an operating voltage of 0.8 V exhibited a high H2O2 production rate of 5.93 mol mgeo−2 h−1. DFT calculations revealed that C–O–C and –CHO functional groups in aCB contributed more to the H2O2 production compared to other functional groups.393 The development of effective and energy-efficient water disinfection technologies coupled with H2O2 production systems is extremely urgent to relieve clean water scarcity and global energy shortage, more fundamental studies, along with detailed mechanistic understanding, are required to further develop H2O2PR-assisted water disinfection based on C-MFECs.

4. Multifunctional C-MFECs for energy devices and integrated energy systems
Imparting multifunctionality in C-MFECs for cost-effective construction of energy devices and/or integrated energy systems with a single metal-free electrocatalyst has attracted increasing attention recently. By creating a variety of co-existing active sites (e.g., doping with more than one different heteroatoms), C-MFECs can possess multiple catalytic functionalities, which is otherwise difficult using metal-based catalysts. This significant advantage allows for the design of new C-MFECs capable of catalyzing different electrochemical reactions simultaneously, such as the ORR in fuel cells (Fig. 28a),420 ORR and OER for metal–air batteries (MABs, Fig. 28b),421 OER and HER for overall water splitting (Fig. 28c),422 and CO2 reduction and evolution for metal-CO2 batteries (Fig. 28d).262

Trifunctional C-MFECs efficient for ORR, OER, and HER can be utilized for MAB and water splitting integrated systems.8,38,131 In this regard, S/N-codoped graphitic carbon sheets containing stereoscopic holes and defect-rich N-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets have been developed to show excellent ORR–OER–HER trifunctional electrocatalysis.38,131 Moreover, multifunctional electrocatalysis was also achieved over a wide pH range on C60/SWCNT hybrid electrode.46 Continued research and more in-depth mechanistic understanding along this direction should lead to the development of more advanced multifunctional C-MFECs for various electrocatalytic reactions, such as ORR, OER, HER, NRR, CO2RR, and H2O2PR, in many more integrated devices/systems, as those to be discussed below.
4.1. Recent advances in C-MFECs for ORR in fuel cells
Fuel cells oxidize a fuel via electrochemical catalytic reactions without burning,4,423 thereby avoiding the inefficiencies and pollution associated with traditional combustion technologies. Thus, fuel cells produce clean electricity with no pollutant emission. As shown in Fig. 28a, hydrogen oxidation occurs (from H2 to H+ ions) at the anode in a hydrogen fuel cell to generate electricity while the electrocatalytic ORR (O2 to OH− ions or H2O) takes place on the cathode.420 As listed in Table 4, however, there are a large variety of different type fuel cells with their most effective operation temperature being determined by the nature of electrolyte and charge-carrying medium, from about 60 °C for the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) up to 1000 °C for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).424 Owing to their chemical stability, high active surface area, good conducting property, and excellent thermomechanical reliability, C-MFECs are generally promised to replace Pt-based cathodes in PEMFCs, phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs), and alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) operating at 60–80 °C, ∼200 °C, and 60–220 °C, respectively.8,425,426 Carbon electrodes may be oxidized and become unstable at a high temperature. Therefore, molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs, 650 °C) and solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs, 600–1000 °C) work mainly with metal-based and ceramic electrodes, respectively.425

For the past 10 years or so, C-MFECs in various morphological forms have been utilized to show extraordinary ORR activities in various fuel cells.5,21 Specifically, N-doped CNTs and their graphene composites, when used as metal-free catalysts in acidic polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, have been demonstrated to exhibit a better long-term duribility and comparable gravimetric power density (limiting current of 2000 A g−1 at 0.1 V and a peak power density of 300 W g−1) with respect to the best known Fe/N/C based metal catalyst.427 In another study, MWCNTs were partially unzipped to generate zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons with a carbon nanotube backbone for electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells,144 which exhibited a peak areal power density of 0.161W cm−2 and a peak mass power density of 520W g−1, superior to most non-precious-metal electrocatalysts. Compared to a representative iron–nitrogen–carbon catalyst, the zigzag carbon cathode showed better stability in the fuel cell with hydrogen/oxygen gases at 0.5 V.144 Besides, N-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (N-HPCNSs) were synthesized from biomass water lettuces as the carbon precursor and showed a 3D hierarchical porous structure with a high surface area and uniform N-doping.59 A systematic electrochemical study revealed that the N-HPCNSs not only held numerous active sites but also manifested a high intrinsic activity for each of the active sites toward ORR in pH-universal electrolytes of alkali, acid, and neutral. With N-HPCNSs as the cathode electrocatalyst, various home-made fuel cells were set up, including Zn–air alkaline fuel cell, direct methanol fuel cell (acidic), and microbial fuel cell (neutral), further demonstrating the potential for C-MFECs to replace the high-cost Pt-based electrocatalysts in practical fuel cells. In 0. 5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the N-HPCNSs based direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) exhibited a Voc of around 0.654 V and a Pmax of 3.815 W m−2 with a current density of 15.51 A m−2. These values were close to those of the Pt/C-DMFC (Voc = 0.566 V, Pmax = 4.111 W m−2).59 Therefore, the as-developed pH-universal C-MFECs could open a promising avenue for developing the next-generation cathode electrocatalysts for fuel cells of practical significance.
4.2. Recent advances in C-MFECs for metal–air batteries
As a class of efficient energy storage devices, batteries can be user-friendly, highly compact, and portable with a high energy density and stability, attractive for portable electronic devices, electric automobile vehicles, and even large-scale electric grids. Having reasonably high energy densities (typically, 200–250 W h kg−1), Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in our electricity-dependent society.428 However, a higher energy density, and longer operation stability are needed for various specific applications, including hybrid and/or fully electric vehicles with a low greenhouse gas emission to replace fossil fuel vehicles.429 Metal–air batteries (MABs), consisting of a metal anode, an air-breathing cathode, and electrolyte, have the combined features of a LIB and fuel cell. The theoretical energy densities of MABs range from 700–10000 W h kg−1, which is 3–40 times higher than that of LIBs.3,29,109 In this regard, MABs are very promising candidates for LIBs.430Fig. 28b schematically shows the structure and mechanism of an MAB,421 which can be aqueous (for Zn–air battery, ZAB) or non-aqueous (for Li–air battery, LiAB) MAB depending on the nature of the electrolyte used.

Fig. 29 compared the mechanistic operating principles of Zn– and Li–air batteries.431 Because of the hazard potential for explosive reactivities of lithium with air or water and the possibility of igniting the flammable organic electrolytes used in most cases, ZABs are more popular than LiABs.432 Comparing with LIBs, Zn–air batteries with low fabrication cost of ca. 10 $ kW−1 h−1 possess a high theoretical energy density of about 11140 W h kg−1, which is very close to that of the gasoline energy density of 12200 W h kg−1.428 However, the practical advancement of MABs has been largely limited by the slow kinetics of ORR and/or OER during discharging and charging, respectively. As such, high performance bifunctional catalysts with a hierarchical tri-phase boundary for simultaneously interfacing with electrolyte and O2 gas are highly desirable.428,430 An ideal oxygen cathode in MABs should have a stable and highly conductive porous structure to facilitate both electron and O2 transport, and also a large specific surface area for a high uptake of the discharging product. Extensive research efforts have been made worldwide to develop efficient C-MFECs for cathodes in MABs.65,71,421,430,433 In spite of the numerous recent progress, the catalytic mechanism, the design principle for efficient ORR/OER bifunctional C-MFECs, and the structure–performance relationship for the cathodic catalysts in MABs are still far from being well understood.65,421,430 More in-depth experimental and theoretical investigations are needed.

As mentioned in Section 2.3.3, the N and P co-doped mesoporous carbon foam (NPMC) was the first C-MFEC reported to show good bifunctional electrocatalytic properties for both ORR and OER in a high-performance ZAB.71 Recently, 3D P and S codoped carbon nitride sponges sandwiched with carbon nanocrystals (P,S-CNS) have been developed for OER electrocatalysis in ZABs.192 These materials exhibited a high surface area (1474 m2 g−1) and superior ORR and OER bi-functional catalytic activities to those of the classical Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with attractive suitability and durability for both primary and rechargeable Zn–air batteries. In particular, the primary Zn–air battery with a P,S-CNS cathode exhibited a high open-circuit voltage (1.51 V), a high discharge peak power density (198 mW cm−2), a specific capacity (830 mA h g−1), high energy densities of 970 (845) W h kg−1 at current density of 5 (20) mA cm−2, and an excellent durability for 210 h after mechanical recharging.192 DFT calculations revealed that the excellent bifunctional catalytic activities are originated from the dual (P/S) doping and efficient mass/charge transfer intrinsically associated with the 3D sponge structure.
Flexible energy devices are essential to meet the specific needs of portable and wearable electronics and devices. Owing to their large specific surface areas, interconnected pore structures, and robust mechanical and electrical properties, C-MFECs play an important role in flexible batteries with high efficiency, low cost, mechanical reliability, and long-term stability.370 Of particular interest, a flexible air electrode (FAE) with a high oxygen electrocatalytic performance (for both OER and ORR) and good flexibility was developed to show excellent performance in a Zn–air battery.185 As shown in Fig. 30a, a facile two-step method involving mild acid oxidation of a commercial carbon cloth (CC), followed by air calcination, was adapted to directly activated CC for generating uniform nanoporous and super hydrophilic surface structures with optimized oxygen-containing functional groups and an enhanced specific surface area.185 The resultant two-step activated CC (CC-AC) exhibited superior oxygen electrocatalytic activity and durability to previously-reported other carbon materials with O doping.185 Particularly, the CC-AC exhibited a low OER overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, among one of the best C-MFECs for OER electrocatalysis.

(b and c) Galvanostatic cycling performance and typical cycles of the fabricated Zn–air battery at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 with CC-AC, CC-C, CC-A, and CC-Raw as the cathode.

An LED was powered by a flexible Zn–air battery under (e) flat and (f) bent condition. Reproduced with permission from ref. 185, copyright 2019 to Wiley-VCH. 
Furthermore, a rechargeable solid-state Zn–air battery was fabricated by using CC-AC as the flexible air-electrode (Fig. 30a). This configuration avoided the use of a current collector and non-conductive polymer binders, and the foldable battery thus prepared exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 1.37 V, a remarkable peak power density of 52.3 mW cm−3 at 77.5 mA cm−3 based on the whole device volumes with good cycling performance. The highly flexible CC-AC exhibited an Egap (Egap = EOER@10mA/cm2 − EORR1/2) of 0.81 V with the lowest charge voltage and the highest discharge voltage of 2.03 and 1.05 V, respectively. This small charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.98 V is comparable to other outstanding heteroatom(s)-doped but non-flexible C-MFECs.175 Moreover, the resultant flexible solid-state ZAB with a binder-free CC-AC air electrode exhibited an excellent duribility, retaining its electrocatalytic activity after 15 months of storage and 5000 cycles of an accelerated degradation test (ADT) at a rate of 50 mV s−1 even under bending deformations (Fig. 30b–f).
The excellent electrocatalytic properties observed for CC-AC are attributable to the following factors: (i) the formation of –COOH groups in the defective graphitic structure of CC-AC to act as the bi-functional active sites for both ORR and OER; (ii) the high electrochemically active surface area of CC-AC, arising from its nanoporous structure, to provide abundant electrocatalytic active sites; and the high hydrophilicity of CC-AC to enhance the affinity of electrolyte species on the electrocatalyst surface for facilitating the electron transfer and preventing the catalyst delamination during oxygen evolution.183
More recently, N/P-codoped carbon spheres (NPCSs) with a highly porous structure, prepared in the presence of phytic acid by pyrolysis, exhibited good bi-functional electrocatalytic performance for OER and ORR.205 Specifically, NPCSs exhibited a comparable half-wave potential (0.83 V vs. RHE) to that of the commercial Pt/C, but a larger current density for ORR, and was superior to RuO2 (overpotential, 320 mV) for OER with a smaller overpotential of 310 mV. DFT calculations revealed that heteroatom-doping at the edges of the porous carbon structure played a dominant role in achieving the high bi-functional catalytic activities,205 enabling the fabrication of high-performance Zn–air batteries in aqueous and solid-state electrolytes with a large energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability. The development of flexible and wearable batteries based on C-MFEC cathodes at a low cost can make a convincing leap towards metal-free electrocatalysis for efficient energy storage.
4.3. C-MFECs as the counter electrode for metal–CO2 batteries
Over the past two decades, Li-ion batteries have overwhelmed the portable electronics market. However, the current Li-ion batteries based on the insertion/extraction of Li+ ions between the cathode and anode electrodes have a limited energy density (e.g., 200–50 W h kg−1). To meet the high energy density requirement for long-distance electric vehicles (EVs), recent efforts have been devoted to the promising energy technologies based on metal–gas batteries with high theoretical energy densities, as exemplified by Li–O2 batteries (e.g., 700–10000 W h kg−1) discussed above.
With the greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) as the energy material at the cathodes, Li(Na)–CO2 batteries provide a new way for CO2 capture and the development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage systems. A rechargeable Li–CO2 battery generates electricity via a redox reaction between Li from anode and CO2 to form Li2CO3 product at the cathode during the discharge process, and stores energy by decomposing the Li2CO3 to release CO2 during the charge process. In 2011, CO2 was first introduced to Li(Na)–O2 batteries to improve their energy densities,434 indicating the great potential of Li(Na)–CO2 batteries. Compared with Li–O2 batteries, Li–CO2 batteries also have multiple advantages, including (1) possible protection and improvement of the cycling efficiency of Li anode by the discharged Li2CO3 layer; (2) enhancement in CO2 reduction reactions by the much higher solubility of CO2 than O2 in aprotic electrolytes; and (3) important platform for carbon capture to reduce the CO2 emissions. Because of the high thermodynamic stability of Li2CO3 (main discharge product in a Li–CO2 battery),435 however, the electrochemical CO2RR is sluggish, leading to a high charging overpotential, poor stability, and relatively low energy efficiency for Li–CO2 batteries.436,437 Consequently, most of the reported Li–CO2 batteries show only limited cycling life with a large potential gap between discharging and charging and poor rate capability. To make the Li–CO2 batteries usable, therefore, it is important to develop high performance cathode catalysts for the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions and to improve the kinetics for electrochemical formation and decomposition of Li2CO3 in Li–CO2 batteries.
Using B,N-codoped holey graphene as a highly efficient cathode, Dai and co-workers reported Li–CO2 batteries that exhibited a high reversibility, low potential gap, and an excellent rate performance with a long-term cycling durability over 200 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1.438 This work opened up the possibilities for the construction of long-term metal–CO2 batteries based on C-MFEC cathodes. Subsequently, a carbon composite of carbon quantum dots supported on holey graphene (CQD/hG) was developed as the air-cathode in Li–CO2 batteries (Fig. 31a), which achieved a low overpotential of 1.02 V (Li/Li+) at 0.1 A g−1, but a high discharge capacity of 12300 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, with a good cycling life up to 235 cycles even at a high current density of 1 A g−1.439 This CQD/hG composite architecture provides a high catalytic activity of the defect-rich carbon quantum dots for the formation and decomposition of Li2CO3 and fast electron/electrolyte transport through the 3D conducting hG.439 As shown in Fig. 31b–d, the same group has also developed a free-standing, binder-free, N-doped carbon architecture, consisting of vertically aligned N-doped CNTs sandwiched between two N-doped graphene layers of a seamless junction at the 3D CNT/G interfaces (3D NCNT/G), which was used for fabricating Li–CO2 batteries to show a large specific capacity of 17534.1 mA h g−1, high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3%, low overpotential (1.13 V), and good long-term stability up to 180 discharge–charge cycles with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 31e and f).440

Similarly, a Na–CO2 battery, based on a reversible reaction: 3CO2 + 4Na = 2Na2CO3 + C (Fig. 32a), with a carbon-based cathode based on tetraethylene glycol dimethyl-treated MWCNTs (TEG-MWCNTs) was developed to exhibit a capacity of 60000 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and ran for 200 cycles with a curtailed specific capacity of 2000 mA h g−1 at a charge voltage <3.7 V (Fig. 32b and c).441 The reduced electrochemical polarization was attributed to the porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and good wettability of electrolyte to the cathode.441 Further research demonstrated that the observed high catalytic activity is attributable to the higher value (−0.32 eV) of CO2 adsorption energy onto TEG-MWCNTs () than that of the pristine MWCNTs (−0.17 eV) (Fig. 32d).442

Although Li/Na–CO2 batteries have attracted great interest due to their high energy density and efficiency to transfer greenhouse CO2 waste into the energy source,438–442 the high cost of commercial lithium and the limited discharge potential of Na–CO2 batteries could hinder the wide practical applications. K+ has the smaller Stokes’ radius (3.6 Å) than Li+ (4.8 Å) and Na+ (4.6 Å) in propylene carbonate solvents, and thus the relatively good ion mobility and conductivity.444 As such, earth-abundant potassium ions are attractive as fast ionic charge carriers for electrochemical energy storage. Unlike the Li–CO2 or Na–CO2 that have been widely investigated, however, the development of K–CO2 battery is challenging due largely to the lack of efficient bifunctional catalysts for the discharge and charge reactions in K–CO2 batteries.443 To address these issues, Dai's group developed a facile method to produce 3D carbon architectures from N-doped CNTs and N-doped reduced graphene oxides (N-CNT/RGO) as the bifunctional cathodes in K–CO2 batteries (Fig. 32e and f).443 In this case, N-CNTs can effectively prevent re-stacking of the N-doped RGO sheets to maximize the exposure of active sites and also provide a mechanically stable porous structure with 3D conductive pathways for efficient electron/electrolyte/CO2 gas transport, along with sufficient space for effectively accommodating the K2CO3 (discharge product). As a result, the reported first K–CO2 battery with the N-CNT/RGO 3D C-MFEC cathode showed a higher discharge potential (Eθ = 2.48 V) than that of Na–CO2 batteries (Eθ = 2.35 V), and this K–CO2 battery can work over 250 cycles (1500 h) with a cut-off capacity of 300 mA h g−1 (Fig. 32g and h).443 This work opens new avenues for rational design and development of cost-effective metal–CO2 batteries with a high energy density and long cycling stabilty.443
In the light of the development of flexible metal–air batteries mentioned in the proceeding section, Hu et al. have developed a flexible Li–CO2 battery (Fig. 33a) with a poly(methacrylate)/poly(ethylene glycol)–LiClO4–3 wt% SiO2/porous CNT cathode, which exhibited a good cycling performance up to 100 cycles and a long operation time of 220 h at 55 °C445 as well as a good cycling life even under different degrees of bending. Recently, a quasi-solidus flexible Li–CO2 battery based on an effective N,S-codoped CNTs (NS-CNTs) as cathode catalyst and a polymer gel as a flexible electrolyte has also been reported.365 The NS-CNTs in the battery exhibited enhanced reversible generation and decomposition of Li2CO3, leading to flexible and high-performance Li–CO2 batteries with an ultra-long lifetime (Fig. 33b and c). Specifically, this newly-developed battery delivered a high capacity of 23560 mA h g−1, and ultra-long cycling over 538 cycles, as well as outstanding mechanical flexibility. Very recently, vertically aligned N-doped carbon nanotube (VA-NCNT) arrays on Ti wire are prepared as freestanding, binder-free cathodes for flexible quasi solid-state Li–CO2 battery (Fig. 33d–f).446 Thousands of vertical CNTs with a high degree of N-dopants, abundant defects and void space within the VA-NCNT arrays facilitate the CO2 diffusion and electrolyte permeation and provide numerous active sites and space for the formation and decomposition of the discharge product (Li2CO3). As a result, the flexible Li–CO2 battery showed an ultralong cycling life, and a good rate capability.446

Using bamboo-like N-doped CNT fibers as flexible C-MFECs for CO2 reduction/evolution reactions at an air-cathode, Wang's group has fabricated a flexible self-powered fiber-shaped Li–CO2 battery in conjunction with homemade solar cells to show an overall photochemical-electric energy conversion efficiency of around 4.6% (Fig. 33g).447 With a stable voltage output, they have further demonstrated the potential use of the developed flexible fiber-shaped Li–CO2 battery in wearable electronics for breath monitoring.
4.4. Recent advances in C-MFECs for water splitting
In a water-splitting cell, hydrogen is generated by direct decomposition of water. The energy required to cleave H–O–H bonds can be supplied by different means, such as electrical (current), thermal (heat), and light (electromagnetic radiation).8 Electrolytic or electrochemical catalytic water splitting is driven bypassing the electrical current through the water with the conversion of electrical energy to chemical energy at the electrode–solution interface via charge transfer reactions in the presence of an electrolyzer. On the anode, the water molecules decomposed to generate oxygen molecules and protons, while a HER takes place at the cathode to reduce the proton into H2 gas. Fig. 28c shows a photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical water-splitting cell, along with the working principle.434 Traditionally, electrolytic water splitting is powered by the electricity that is predominately produced through the combustion of coal or natural gas, leading to significant CO2 emission. To reduce/eliminate the detrimental environmental effect associated with the CO2 emission, however, renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, tide) is currently used to drive the electrochemical/catalytic water-splitting process. Another promising option for the renewable generation of hydrogen from water and sunlight with zero CO2-emission is photochemical/photocatalytic water splitting. In the water splitting, catalysts play a crucial role, and C-MFECs have emerged as a promising alternative to metal-based electrocatalysts, as we shall see later.
Since water splitting involves OER and HER, considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of earth-abundant electrocatalytic materials with a high electrocatalytic performance and long-term stability for OER and HER.448 Of particular interest, metal-free carbonaceous materials have recently studied as electrocatalysts for water splitting. In 2017, a facile route to N-doped MWCNTs was developed for the electrocatalysis towards OER and HER with prolonged stability,449,450 and then, N-doped carbon cloth also showed high performance for overall water splitting. Furthermore, a graphite foam (NSGF) codoped with N and S was fabricated from commercial graphite foils, which demonstrated excellent flexibility, mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and attractive electrocatalytic water splitting performance.195 Furthermore, N,F co-doped porous graphene nanosheets (NFPGNS, Fig. 34a) have also been utilized for bifunctional OER/HER electrocatalysis towards overall water splitting (Fig. 34b), and the related onset potential for water splitting was around 1.60 V, comparable to that of the Pt/C electrocatalyst.451

In addition to the above mentioned examples, a porous carbon co-doped with N and O was prepared through pyrolysis of ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework-8) based metal–organic framework, followed by H2SO4 etching to remove the metal species (Fig. 33c). The resulting N,O-codoped porous carbon electrode exhibited good OER–HER bifunctional electrocatalyses and a high performance for water splitting with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a constant potential of 1.82 V for over 8 h and a Faraday efficiency of over 98.0%.453 N,P,O-tri-doped porous graphite carbon@oxidized carbon cloth (PGC/OCC) was also fabricated for water splitting electrocatalysis, which showed a low overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 83 mV dec−1.454 Furthermore, this carbon cloth catalyst with its 3D porous architecture showed high bifunctional (OER–HER) eletrocatalytic performance for water electrolysis in alkaline medium (10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.66 V vs. RHE), which also displayed superior ectrocatalytic activities in strong acidic and neutral electrolytes. Such good OER and HER catalytic performance was attributable to the high conductivity of graphitized carbon, the 3D porous architecture between PGC and OCC, and the presence of many active sites induced by electron-rich “P” and “N” dopants.454 Moreover, defect-rich porous carbon was also prepared via a template-assisted synthesis and was utilized as a high-performance bifunctional (OER–HER) C-MFEC for electrochemical water splitting with practical significance (Fig. 34d).455
The good HER and OER performance of carbon-based catalyst was further demonstrated by constructing B-doped graphene quantum dots on a 3D-architectured graphene hydrogel (GH-BGQD) (Fig. 34e and f). The GH-BGQD possesses a high porosity and large specific surface area, exhibiting abundant catalytic active sites associated with the B-doped GQDs, improved electrolytic mass transport and ion/electron transfer. As a result, the GH-BGQD based electrode exhibited good OER and HER electrocatalyses for overall water splitting in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, showing an overpotential of 194 and 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER and OER, respectively, along with good prolonged durability (Fig. 34g and h).206
Along with the development of all-carbon composites for overall water-splitting, Yu and co-workers coupled the ultrathin few-layer thick exfoliated black phosphorus nanosheets (EBP) with N-doped graphene (NG) as a new 2D/2D heterostructure (EBP@NG) to achieve modulated and modified electronic energy states (Fig. 35a).207 The EBP has a lower Fermi level than that of NG, and hence the directional interfacial electron transfer, which can enrich the electron density over EBP to optimize the H adsorption/desorption for promoting HER while introducing electron deficient carbon sites on NG for facilitating OOH* intermediates formation to promote the OER process. Thus, the EBP@NG achieved remarkably high bifunctional HER and OER activities (Fig. 35b and c), which ensured in fabricating an optimized water electrolyzer performing under a low cell voltage of 1.54 V with a 10 mA cm−2 current density, even lower than the corresponding cell voltage (1.60 V) of a Pt/C@RuO2 counterpart.207

Very recently, a 3D porous fluorographdiyne network supported by carbon cloth (p-FGDY/CC) was reported as an attractive bifunctional metal-free HER/OER catalyst (Fig. 35d–g).452 The DFT calculations revealed that the fluorographdiyne had a high selectivity for the adsorption/desorption of various O/H intermediate species (Fig. 35h–j) to ensure a good bifunctional H2O redox performance under pH-universal electrochemical conditions (Fig. 35k, l).452 In particular, p-FGDY/CC exhibited low overpotentials of 82 and 92 mV at a 10 mA cm−2 current density for HER under alkaline (1.0 M KOH) and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) conditions, respectively. The resulting electrode is also foldable due to the high flexibility of the carbon cloth (Fig. 35m and n).452
As discussed above, many strategies have been developed to boost the ORR/OER/HER performance by controlling the porosity, regulating doping/codoping configurations, and constructing microarchitectures for sp2 carbon. For practical applications, it requires the development of active and stable C-MFECs. As is well-known, the first C-MFEC (i.e., N-doped carbon nanotubes) was demonstrated to show a more efficient catalytic activity and better long-term stability than those of commercially available platinum electrodes for ORR in alkaline electrolytes.6 Since then, various C-MFECs have been demonstrated to exhibited high ORR, OER, HER activities for fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and photo-electrochemical water splitting systems.4,10,65 It has been further demonstrated that N-doped carbon nanotubes and their graphene composites with porous structures perform better and are more durable than the state-of-the-art nonprecious iron-based catalyst even in acidic PEM fuel cells.427
Generally speaking, the long-term stability of the C-MFECs is highly dependent on the quality of the carbon materials (e.g., graphitization degree, nature of the dopants and/or defects).456 Very stable ORR and OER electrocatalysts with a long-term stability and durability in whole pH region have been demonstrated for C-MFECs of high quality with lower overpotentials for metal-free electrocatalysis in metal–O2 batteries.71,457 Even under harsh conditions for OER in the water-splitting process, the high catalytic activity of C-MFECs can significantly reduce the overpotential to further stabilize the carbon electrodes.458 Therefore, it is possible now that C-MFECs could take the race along with metal-based catalysts to the renewable energy technological marketplace. For industrial applications, however, it is also essential to develop simple and cost-efficient methods for the large-scale production of carbon catalytic materials with a well-defined structure. Currently, the synthesis processes for high-quality carbon materials often involve the high-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, which is time consuming and cost ineffective for large scale production. With so many efficient and cost-effective solution syntheses and self-assembling approaches toward C-MFECs with well-controlled structures and properties reviewed in Section 2.3.3 and more to be developed, there will be vast opportunities for numerous innovative carbon catalysts for practical applications. Continued research and development efforts in this exciting field will surely revolutionize future renewable energy technologies.
4.5. Multifunctional C-MFECs for integrated energy systems
As mentioned earlier, a proper combination of the defects, edges, and heteroatom dopants in C-MFECs can impart multifunctional activities. Imparting multifunctionalities in C-MFECs is a cost-effective approach to integrated devices/systems with a single electrocatalyst for various electrocatalytic reactions. In this context, Dai and Zhang reported the first ORR–OER–HER trifunctional C-MFEC based on a N, P, and F tri-doped graphene foam synthesized using a simple one-step annealing process (Fig. 36a).69 The resultant N/P/F tri-doped graphene foam was demonstrated to be an efficient OER–HER bifunctional catalyst for overall water-splitting for O2 and H2 gas production (Fig. 36b and c), which was operated by an integrated Zn–air batteries that possessed an air cathode fabricated using the same C-MFEC (Fig. 36d).69 Besides, 3D graphitic framework codoped with N and S (N/S-3DPG) was used as a low-cost, and highly efficient C-MFEC for HER to generate H2 gas-fuel through the photo-induced electrochemical water splitting, OER to generate O2, and ORR for producing clean electricity through a fuel cell utilizing the H2 and O2 gases from the aforementioned HER and OER processes, respectively.18

As sustainable energy, sunlight holds a great promise to solve current energy and environmental challenges, which, however, is intermittent. Nevertheless, solar energy can be converted into green chemical energy ready for use at any time. As shown in Fig. 36e–h, the N/S-3DPG multifunctional C-MFEC was incorporated into an integrated energy system operated by CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, producing H2 and O2 gases through the solar-powered electrochemical water splitting, followed by a H2–O2 fuel cell to produce electricity from those O2 and H2 gases obtained by water splitting. While the quantum efficiency of the solar cell itself was ca. 14.7%, the operating current density of the integrated device was 7.3 mA cm−2, which reached to 11.7% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (Fig. 36f–h),18 showing a great promise for C-MFECs as cost-effective multifunctional electrocatalysts in efficient integrated energy systems.
Very recently, P and N coordinated fullerene-like carbon (N,P-FC) was fabricated using a soft-template assisted pyrolysis process as an efficient multifunctional C-MFEC for CO2RR to CO, demonstrating a high FE of 83.3%, a high current density of 24 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V, a high reactants/intermediates selectivity, and a good electrocatalytic stability, as shown in Fig. 37a and b.318 The performance of the N,P-FC for CO2RR was found to strongly depend on the atomic ratio of P/N while it possessed an impressive ORR performance with an E1/2 of 0.910 V, which was 79 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C and outperformed most of the previously-reported C-MFECs.318Fig. 37c and d also shows an excellent Zn air battery performance utilizing the same carbon electrocatalyst.318 Combined theoretical calculations indicated that the active sites for CO2RR were the P-coordinated C atoms while the N-coordinated neighboring C atoms promoted the ORR.

Artificial photosynthetic devices, utilizing sunlight as energy-source and water as of electron-source to photo-electrochemically transform CO2 into organic compounds with a higher energy density (fuels or other carbon-contained feedstocks), are attractive for harvesting solar energy as value-added chemicals.8 This can be also realized by using a photovoltaic (PV) cell to provide photogenerated electrons and/or holes to an electrochemical cell (EC) for water oxidation at the anode and CO2RR at the cathode. However, such innovative PV-EC systems have rarely been reported,460–462 and most of which led to high CO or formate production,463–468 and only two reported systems produced high hydrocarbons or alcohols.469–471 Among them, a GaInP/GaInAs/Ge photovoltaic cell set a record high solar-to-CO conversion (13%) while IrO2 anode coupled to a four-terminal III–V/Si tandem cell demonstrated about 3% solar to-hydrocarbon conversion efficiency.460,469,472
Despite their unprecedented efficiency, the aforementioned artificial photosynthetic systems hardly meet the critical requirement for large-scale applications. In contrast, integrated energy devices/systems based on C-MFECs would be ideal in reducing cost and preserving environmental concerns as well.21,23 Wang et al., developed a silicon and nitrogen codoped porous carbon (SiNC) using a facial pyrolysis with self-sacrificial template, which used as a metal-free bifunctional catalyst, can electrocatalyze CO2-to-CO reaction with an over 90% selectivity at 490 mV overpotential and 1.0 mA cm−2 current density with a 470 mV overpotential towards neutral oxygen evolution.459 As shown in Fig. 37e–g, a CO2 splitting electrochemical cell based on the newly-developed SiNC efficient bifunctional electrodes exhibited 79% energy efficiency at a low cell voltage of 1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl (550 mV overpotential). Being powered by a commercial photovoltaic module (opening circuit potential of ca. 2 V), this CO2 splitting electrochemical cell showed a ca. 75% energy efficiency, leading to an overall solar-to-chemical efficiency of 15%. This work demonstrates the feasibility of photovoltaic CO2 splitting on metal-free bifunctional catalyst electrodes and provides the opportunities for highly efficient artificial photosynthesis with low-cost metal-free catalysts.
5. Conclusions
Thriving applications of C-MFECs have been conceived in the last decade since the discovery of the first C-MFEC primarily for ORR in an alkaline electrolyte in 2009. Since then, C-MFECs have already demonstrated promising electrochemical catalysis for OER, HER, NRR, CO2RR, CO2ER, H2O2PR, far beyond ORR, comparable or often superior to their counterparts based on noble and/or transitional metals. However, further advancements, particularly in terms of the energy/power density and long-term stability, are required for the utilization of C-MCEC electrodes in energy conversion and storage systems, such as fuel cells, metal–air batteries, water splitting devices, chemical conversion systems, fuel and chemical production systems, and water purification applications. There should be no doubt that continued and in-depth research initiatives and further advancements in C-MFECs can significantly improve current energy conversion, storage, and utilization technologies by replacing environmentally detrimental metal-based electrocatalysts, which would lead to a better human life towards energy sustainability and environmental remediation.

 	Fig. 2  Carbon-based allotropic nanomaterials from 0D fullerene through 1D CNTs and 2D graphene to 3D carbon architecture depending on hybridization states of C–C bonds. For 3D architecture, adapted with permission from ref. 20, copyright 2008 to American Chemical Society. The electronic, chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of C-MFECs are determined by the dominant hybridization state of the carbon–carbon bonds, and the dopants/edge (e.g., armchair and zigzag edges)/defects (e.g., pentagon). Hybrids: nanotube–graphene pillars or porous carbons.

Lower panel: Doping-induced charge-redistribution, spin redistribution, and charge-spin coupling based on the relative electronegativity of heteroatom dopants. Se, Br, and I are labeled with the superscript of *, denoting that these heteroatoms are too large to be incorporated into the carbon lattice and spatial distortion has to be considered as an important factor for inducing catalytic activities rather than pure contributions from charge and spin redistributions.
