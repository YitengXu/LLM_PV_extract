    , Accepted 1st April 2011First published on 12th May 2011AbstractA simple but very efficient reproducible approach was developed to fabricate novel mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) with tailored nanostructure by using porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membrane and colloidal silica as hard templates and phenolic resin as a carbon source. The as-prepared MCNFs with a channel diameter of ca. 200 nm reveal uniform one-dimensional (1D) nanofiber structure, created by the replication of the AAO template, and open interconnected spherical mesopores of ca. 30 nm in diameter embedded in the CNFs, mainly controlled by the particle size of the silica template. Due to their large mesopore size and volume, high specific surface area and unique nanostructure constituted by the 1D macro-scaled porous CNF and 3D interconnected mesopore structure, the MCNFs not only possess a large electrochemically active surface area, but also an open highway network favoring rapid electron transfer and fast mass transport. As a counter electrode in a CdSe quantum-dot-sensitized solar cell, the MCNF has demonstrated higher catalytic activity towards the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte and superior photovoltaic performance to its peers such as activated carbon (AC), hollow core/mesoporous shell carbon and ordered multimodal porous carbon, and the commonly used Pt electrode, revealing a fill factor of 0.60 and a power conversion efficiency of up to 4.81%. Excellent photovoltaic performance demonstrated by the MCNF suggests synergetic effects from the combination of 1D and 3D nanostructures.
1. Introduction
Although solar energy could provide enough power to satisfy the worldwide energy demand, the fabrication of efficient photovoltaic systems that are competitive with fossil fuel systems remains a challenge. Much effort and progress have been made in the development of renewable energy technologies such as solar cells, which are the most favorable ways to convert solar energy into electricity. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as the main energy source in the future.1–5 Although great progress has been made with dye-sensitized and bulk heterojunction solar cells, novel combinations of materials and device architectures are still sought to further improve the performance and cost of solar cells. Recently, quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have gained much attention, and various quantum-dot chalcogenide semiconductors such as CdS,1,6 PbS,7 and CdSe,8,9 and new sensitizers such as the material combination of TiO2-CdSe-ZnS-DT (molecular dipoles)10 have been investigated. Albeit various candidate sensitizers have been examined, CdSe QDs have received special attention due to their relatively easy synthesis and also the tunable band edge which offers the opportunity to harvest light energy in most of the visible region of the solar spectrum. Compared with DSSCs, QDSSCs have some obvious advantages including the size quantization effect on band gap tuning11 and the potential utilization of hot electrons.12 In addition, QDSSCs have other advantages such as higher molar extinction coefficients13 and enhanced charge separation due to large intrinsic dipole moments.14 Although QDSSCs are considered as one of the most promising low cost candidates for third generation photovoltaics,15 the solar power conversion efficiency (η) realized by the QDSSCs is much smaller than that by DSSCs, and has hindered their commercialization.
Numerous investigations have been made to enhance η mainly focusing on the development of a high performance photoanode.10,16–18 The cathode (i.e., counter electrode) is an equally important component of QDSSCs. Particularly, when a polysulfide is used as a redox electrolyte in QDSSCs, it still remains a major challenge to prepare a counter electrode without significant loss in photovoltaic performance due to high charge-transfer resistance resulting from the complexity of the redox chemistry of polysulfide.19,20Pt and Au loaded on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or porous metal sulfides such as Cu2S have been commonly used as the counter electrode in QDSSCs.17,18,21,22 However, for the polysulfide electrolyte a Pt counter electrode leads to a rather low fill factor (FF), and an Au electrode shows just a slight increase in the FF compared with Pt while Cu2S and CoS may poison the surface of the photoelectrode.19 In addition, the values for η have been reported to be very low for QDSSCs based on these counter electrodes (i.e., typically less than 2.3%), approximately one-fifth of that reported for DSSCs (ca. 11.4%).23 Thus, considerable enhancement in η is highly needed. Furthermore, cost consideration necessitates the development of alternative materials in lieu of noble metals. Recently, much attention has been paid to porous carbon materials particularly with novel hierarchical nanostructures as potential alternatives for application in QDSSCs, such as hollow macroporous core/mesoporous shell carbon (HCMSC)24 and ordered multimodal porous carbon (OMPC).25 Although these carbon materials have demonstrated considerable enhancement in η in QDSSCs or in other applications such as catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction26–28 and in Li storage29 due to their unique hierarchical nanostructures, their syntheses are generally complicated. Simpler but more efficient approaches are highly desirable for the fabrication of novel nanostructured carbon materials.
In this study, a novel porous carbon material, mesoporous carbon nanofiber (MCNF) with a tailored nanostructure was developed for the first time through nanocasting technology by using a commercially available porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membrane with uniform cylindrical channels as a hard template and colloidal silica as a co-template and phenolic resin as a carbon source. Compared with the other strategies for mesoporous CNF syntheses, which may involve separate preparation of a carbon precursor and utilization of surfactants as structural directing agents,30,31 making the synthesis process complicated and costly, the synthesis strategy developed in this study using easily available colloidal silica as the co-template provides a simpler and more efficient approach for the fabrication of MCNFs. In addition, the mesopores size can be more easily and effectively controlled through the selection of the silica template compared with that realized by increasing the temperature for the carbonization, in which the increase in the mesopores size was not significant (i.e., only some limited increase to 15 nm from 11 nm) even though the temperature was raised considerably from 623 to 973 K.32 When used as a counter electrode in a CdSe QDSSC, the MCNF material has demonstrated a FF of 0.60 and an η of 4.81%, which are both much higher than those achieved by activated carbon (AC) and Pt, and also markedly higher than those exhibited by other hierarchical nanostructured carbon materials such as HCMSC24 and OMPC.25 This implies a synergetic effect from the combination of 1D and 3D nanostructures.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of MCNFs
MCNFs were fabricated through nanocasting technology by using a commercially available AAO membrane as a hard template and colloidal silica as a co-template, and phenolic resin as a carbon source. To the best of our knowledge, colloidal silica particles with controllable size were used for the first time in this work as a porogen of AAO-templated CNF. Scheme 1 shows a typical schematic process for synthesis of the MCNFs. Typically, colloidal silica nanoparticles (NPs) of ca. 30 nm in diameter were prepared by mixing 900 ml ethanol, 15 ml deionized H2O, and 19 ml NH4OH followed by the addition of 27 ml tetraethyl orthosilicate. After stirring for 6 h, an appropriate amount of the as-prepared silica NPs were infiltrated within the nanopore channels of the AAO membrane (Whatman Anodisc 25) of ca. 200 nm in diameter. After drying at 353 K, 0.187 g of phenol was incorporated and followed by a heating treatment at 373 K under vacuum for 12 h. The phenol–silica-incorporated AAO was heat-treated with 0.169 g of paraformaldehyde at 403 K under vacuum for 24 h to yield a silica–phenol resin polymer composite. The AAO membrane was then completely removed by 5.0 M of HCl aqueous solution at 323 K. After being retrieved from the filtration and washing, the resultant silica–polymer nanofibers composite was carbonized at 973 K under N2 gas flow for 3 h to convert the polymer into carbon. The MCNFs were obtained after etching the silica template with a 48% HF aqueous solution.

2.2. Surface characterization of MCNFs
The examination of morphologies and nanostructures of the carbon materials (i.e., MCNF and AC) was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4700 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV, and TEM analysis was operated on EM 912 Omega microscope at 120 kV.
N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on a KICT SPA-3000 Gas Adsorption Analyzer after a sample was degassed at 423 K to 20 μTorr for 12 h. The specific surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Total pore volume was determined from the amount of gas adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. Micropore volumes of the porous carbons were calculated from the analysis of the adsorption isotherms using the Horvath–Kawzoe method. Pore size distribution (PSD) was derived from the analysis of the adsorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
2.3. 
          Electrode preparation, solar cell configuration and photovoltaic performance tests

          Carbon
          counter electrodes were fabricated as follows. 100 mg of MCNFs (or AC from Duksan Pharm. Co., Korea, for comparison) was dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min followed by overnight magnetic stirring. The carbon slurry was then coated onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm of thickness) with a carbon loading of ca. 120 μg cm−2 by using a doctor blade. Finally, the electrodes were heat-treated at 400 °C in air for 5 min using a hot-air gun (Leister CH6060 Sarnen, Switzerland). The Pt counter electrode was fabricated with an optimized Pt loading of ca. 50 μg cm−2 on FTO glass according to the method described elsewhere.33
The CdSe QD electrodes were fabricated according to the protocol described in our previous paper,6 which involves assembling 3.5 nm CdSe QDs onto a mesoporous TiO2 matrix followed by chemical bath seed growing, ZnS coating, and post-sintering at 400 °C. The ZnS coating was employed to retard the charge recombination at the interface of CdSe/electrolyte.
The as-prepared CdSe QD electrode (geometric surface area of ca. 0.2 cm2) and the carbon (or Pt) counter electrode (surface area of ca. 0.2 cm2) were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell with a 50 μm-thick hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn) as a spacer (i.e., separator). The polysulfide electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 0.5 M sulfur, and 0.1 M KCl in a mixed solution of methanol and H2O (volume ratio of 7:3).
The measurements of J–V curves of solar cells were conducted under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 using a 1000 W xenon light source, whose power of an AM 1.5 Oriel solar simulator was calibrated by using a KG5 filtered Si reference solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the cells were measured on an IPCE measuring system.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization of various electrode materials

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed to characterize the various counter electrode materials, i.e., MCNF, AC and Pt. Testing was conducted with a sandwich cell composed of two identical counter electrodes of 0.5 cm2, a 100-μm-thick Surlyn film as a spacer and the polysulfide electrolyte. For EIS measurements, an impedance analyzer (Parstat 2273, Princeton) was employed, and a zero-bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude were applied over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Software (Z-View) was used to analyze the equivalent circuit derived from the EIS measurements and calculate the kinetic parameters.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Surface and structural characteristics of MCNFs

Fig. 1 shows the representative SEM and TEM images of the MCNFs. From the SEM images shown here and ones in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† it is clear that the MCNFs are generated as uniform individual discrete nanofibers generally having lengths of ca. 5–60 μm and diameters of ca. 180–250 nm, which is basically consistent with the inner diameter of the AAO NT template. The high magnification SEM and TEM images reveal that the MCNFs have homogeneously distributed spherical open mesopores of ca. 20–35 nm in the wall, which is further confirmed by the PSD derived from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms as shown in Fig. 2, indicating a mean mesopore size of ca. 30 nm, which is consistent with the size of the colloidal silica template. Therefore, MCNFs possess a unique nanostructure, which is mainly composed of uniform 1D macro-scaled porous CNF and 3D interconnected open spherical mesopores of ca. 30 nm in diameter distributed uniformly along the entire walls and internal surface of the CNF. The MCNFs show a BET specific surface area of 921 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 1.50 cm3 g−1, which are mainly attributable to the presence of the mesopores in the walls (mesopore volume: 1.14 cm3 g−1, accounting for ca. 76% of the total pore volume).

In contrast, from the SEM image shown in Fig. S2,† there is no distinct well-defined nanostructure observed for the AC. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the derived PSD shown in Fig. S3† reveal a BET surface area of 1084 m2 g−1, and a total pore volume of 0.81 cm3 g−1, which is mainly attributable to the micropores centered at ca. 0.6 nm (micropous volume: 0.43 cm3 g−1, accounting for ca. 53% of the total pore volume). The data derived from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are summarized in Table 1 where the data reported for HCMSC24 and OMPC25 are also listed for clear comparison and discussion later.

Interestingly, the mean pore size of mesopores embedded in the walls of the CNFs and specific surface area for the MCNFs prepared in this study are much larger than those revealed by the mesoporous CNFs materials fabricated through other synthesis approaches.30,31 This is mainly attributable to the difference in the co-templates. The utilization of colloidal silica with a large NP size in this study ensures the successful replica of mesopores with large pore size, while the removal of the AAO membrane prior to the carbonization step generates a large surface area for the MCNF material as confirmed by our experiments. The combination of unique nanostructure, large mesopore size and volume, and particularly high specific surface area for the MCNF material enables the polysulfide electrolyte to have greater and faster access to the MCNF counter electrode. Hence, high catalytic activity can be expected from this electrode material.

The MCNF reveals an IPCE peak value of ca. 78%, which is almost comparable to that of highly efficient DSSCs and higher than that for Pt (ca. 71%) and AC (ca. 72%). As evident from Table 2, carbon materials have a slightly larger Jsc and a higher Voc than the Pt counter electrode. Larger Jsc values observed for the carbon materials compared to those for Pt are mainly attributable to the larger roughness factors for the former24 because the identical carbon loadings have been applied for fabricating the counter electrodes. The roughness factor for the MCNF is the smallest among these carbon materials according to their specific surface areas shown in Table 1. Thus, the larger Jsc values observed for the MCNF compared to AC are probably related to its superior nanostructural characters. Larger Voc values for carbon materials are probably caused by the positive shift of the formal potential for the polysulfide redox couple. A similar phenomenon has been reported for the I3−/I−redox couple when a glassy carbon electrode was employed as a working electrode.34 Generally, FF and η are two key parameters which effectively reflect the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.
Interestingly, MCNF demonstrates a FF of 0.60, which is much higher than that for Pt (0.35), and also markedly higher than that of other carbon materials even with hierarchical nanostructures such as HCMSC and OMPC. These results suggest that the electron transfer rates and the mass transport rates involved are faster with the MCNF electrode, which again is mainly attributable to the unique nanostructure of the MCNF material. The reason for this and a detailed explanation regarding the relationship between the solar cell performance and the nanostructure of the electrode materials will be discussed in detail in the next section. The best photovoltaic performance was also observed for the MCNF-based solar cell, which is mainly attributable to the highest FF for the MCNF material.
3.3. Insights into the mechanism for enhanced photovoltaic performance

EIS measurements are generally an effective technique to analyze the electrode reaction process and understand the reaction mechanisms involved. Representative Nyquist plots for the cells based on various electrode materials and the proposed equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 4. The first semicircle in the high-mid frequency region (i.e., 100 kHz to 49.42 Hz) is dominated by the RC (i.e., resistor capacitor) network of the electrode/electrolyte interface, consisting of the Rct and the capacitance of the electrical double layer (i.e., Cdl).3,35 By fitting the plots with Z-View software using the equivalent circuit, the kinetic parameters Rs, Rct, Zw and Cdl were derived from the Nyquist plots and are summarized in Table 3. Evidently, Pt electrode demonstrates a much larger Rct than the porous carbon materials. This phenomenon was not observed in conventional DSSCs based on Pt counter electrode and I3−/I−redox electrolyte, where Pt electrode shows a much lower Rct than the value observed for QDSSCs in this study, which is comparable to the Rct values observed for the hierarchical nanostructured carbon materials such as HCMSC24 and OMPC.25 The much larger Rct observed for the Pt counter electrode in this study is probably attributable to the attachment and poisoning of S in the polysulfide solution, increasing the charge-transfer resistance.36 It also suggests that the counter electrode does play a very important role in determining photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.

Interestingly, compared with its counterparts including hierarchical nanostructured carbon materials such as the HCMSC and OMPC, the MCNF shows the smallest Rct and Zw, which is mainly attributable to the large mesopore size and volume, and particularly to the unique nanostructure of the MCNFs which combines the uniform 1D macro-scaled porous fiber with the open 3D interconnected spherical mesopores. The combination of 1D and 3D nanostructures enables the MCNF to have both of the advantages of a 1D material (i.e., CNF) facilitating rapid electron transfer and a 3D nanostructure favoring fast mass transport. In the QDSSCs and DSSCs, FF and η are highly associated with charge transfer and mass transport,37–40 and therefore the greatly improved charge transfer and mass transport in the electrode materials enhance the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells considerably. In contrast, although the AC has a larger specific surface area and thus larger roughness factor than the MCNF because of the same carbon loading of ca. 120 μg cm−2 on the counter electrodes, the mesoporosity (i.e., 47 v/v%) for the AC is the smallest of all the tested carbon materials. Furthermore, the AC does not have a well-defined nanostructure favorable for charge transfer and mass transport as is evident from its SEM image and N2 adsorption isotherms shown in the Supporting Information.† Thus, it is very reasonable that the AC has the largest Rct and Zw, and accordingly the smallest FF and η among all the carbon materials. Evidently, although the roughness factor, which is mainly determined by specific surface area, is an important factor for good photovoltaic performance for porous materials, other factors, particularly the unique structural combination of 1D and 3D nanostructures, has more determinant impact on the enhanced photovoltaic performance of a QDSSC.
4. Conclusions
In this study, a simple but very efficient synthesis strategy was developed to fabricate new MCNFs with a tailored nanostructure through nanocasting technology by using an AAO membrane as a hard template and colloidal silica as a co-template and phenolic resin as a carbon source for the first time. This novel synthesis approach enables one to easily control the mesopore size through the selection of the particle size of the colloidal silica. In addition, colloidal silica samples can be easily fabricated with tailored particle sizes according to the protocols reported in the literature.41,42 The as-prepared MCNF material has a unique nanoarchitecture combining uniform 1D macro-scaled porous fiber and open 3D spherical mesopores embedded on the walls of the CNFs. Compared with reported mesoporous CNFs, the new MCNF material has a larger mesopore size and specific surface area, facilitating faster mass transport with resulting higher catalytic activity. When used as the counter electrode in QDSSCs, the MCNF has demonstrated excellent and superior photovoltaic performance to its peers, i.e., Pt and AC. Furthermore, due to the introduction of the 1D nanostructure of the CNF, the MCNF exhibits enhanced solar cell performance compared with other hierarchical nanostructured carbon materials such as the HCMSC and the OMPC.
With optimization of the mesopore size of the MCNFs and surface area through the controllable selection of meso-sized colloidal silica and the synthesis strategy for MCNF, the photovoltaic performance of MCNF-based QDSSCs and DSSCs are expected to be further improved. In addition, this material is also expected to have applications for Li ion batteries and low temperature fuel cells. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the synthesis strategy for the MCNFs can be expanded to generate TiO2 (or other semiconductors) nanotubes (NTs) and nanofibers with tailored mesopores on the walls, which can be utilized as a photoanode for solar cells to enhance light absorption and charge separation and hence photovoltaic performance. By combining a mesoprous TiO2 NTs photoanode and MCNFs cathode, the η of QDSSCs can be reasonably expected to reach and even exceed 6%. These investigations are in progress.
