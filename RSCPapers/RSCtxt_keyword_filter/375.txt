    , Accepted 17th March 2020First published on 18th March 2020AbstractAqueous polysulfide/iodide redox flow batteries (RFBs) are an attractive candidate for scalable energy storage with highly soluble active materials, which show great potential to reduce RFB cost. However, their energy efficiency is usually limited by poor kinetics reversibility and electrochemical activity of the redox reaction of polysulfide couples on the graphite felt electrode, which hinder its further practical applications. Here, Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals are successfully synthesized through the hot injection method, and then uniformly coated onto the surface of graphite felt as electrodes. These electrodes can successfully suppress the water splitting side reactions, especially the hydrogen evolution reaction. The ones with Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals can significantly boost electrocatalytic activities of S2−/Sx2− redox reactions for the proper adsorbability of polysulfide, which inturn improve the charge transfer process and selectively facilitate the electro-conversion reactions of polysulfides. Furthermore, the polysulfide/iodide flow battery with GF–Cu2CoGeS4 generates a high energy efficiency of 77.2% at 20 mA cm−2, a power density of 40.7 mW cm−2 and a stable energy efficiency retention of 92% after approximately 250 continuous cycles.
1. Introduction
Growing global energy demand requires large-scale and efficient use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. Meanwhile, renewable energy can solve environmental challenges caused by fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of these renewable resources limits further applications. Nowadays, different energy storage technologies are emerging as critical enablers for alleviating intermittency.1–4 Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been regarded as a viable technology for large-scale energy storage applications. Flow batteries realize the conversion and storage between the chemical energy stored by the ion and the electrical energy. Compared to traditional rechargeable batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, flow batteries have several advantages including decoupled power and energy, safety features and scalabilities.2,5 Aqueous all-vanadium flow batteries (VRBs) are the most investigated so far, since first proposed by Skyllas et al. in 1986, resulting from the minor cross-contamination of active species,6 but highly concentrated acidic supporting electrolytes (like 3.0 M H2SO4 and 6.0 M HCl) are needed.7 The high cost and toxicity hinder their further commercial applications.
Sulfur is abundant on earth and polysulfide has very high solubility and reversibility in aqueous media.8 Polysulfide-based flow batteries have been described in 1980,9 typically the aqueous polysulfide–bromine redox flow battery system.10–12 The feasibilities of polysulfide negative electrolyte and polybromine positive electrolyte flow batteries have been proven. However, it has serious safety concerns, including the volatilization of corrosive and toxic bromine gas. Highly soluble iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) couples are one of the most promising redox-active species for high energy density electrochemical energy storage. In addition, its kinetics is much higher than that of Br−/Br3−. Li et al. proposed a polysulfide–iodide flow battery system,13 and showed that the chemical cost of polysulfide/polyiodide electrolytes is lower than that of vanadium-based electrolytes by calculation. Hence, polysulfide/polyiodide redox flow batteries with a lower materials cost and apparently higher solubility of active species are a promising candidate for low-cost and large-scale flow battery energy storage applications.
As an important component of the polysulfide-based flow battery, the main role of the electrode is to catalyze redox reactions in the electrolyte. Traditionally, the preparation of different carbon materials, including carbon paper, graphite felt,14etc., has been the main focus. Lu et al. reported that an aqueous polysulfide-based battery delivered an energy efficiency (EE) of ca. 68% at 10 mA cm−2 for 70 cycles.13 However, the poor kinetic reversibility and electrochemical activity of the S2−/Sx2− redox reaction on the surface of the graphite felt electrode always restrict the EE and power density. So it is necessary to introduce an electrocatalyst on graphite felt surfaces to enhance the kinetics of the S2−/Sx2− redox couple. The electrocatalytic conversion reaction of the S2−/Sx2− is an important process and shortcoming for various energy conversion and storage devices, not only in polysulfide-based flow batteries, but also in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) and Li–S batteries. Various materials, especially metal sulfides, such as CoS,15 NiSx,16 WS2,17 PbS,18 CdS,19 CoS2,20 MoS2,21 VS2,22 and TiS2,23 are applied as electrocatalysts to improve the conversion efficiency of the S2−/Sx2− due to their good stability in sulfide-based chemical environments. Wang et al. reported that single crystalline NiCo2S4 for catalyzing the polysulfide redox couple in QDSSCs promoted electron transport.24 Recently, Lee et al. reported that hierarchical microspheres Cu2ZnSnS4 as a counter electrode in QDSSCs showed a high electrocatalytic activity for catalyzing the redox couple of polysulfide electrolyte.25 Multiple-metal compounds can provide more ways to adjust their physicochemical properties via the synergistic effect of their different component elements, which can also produce favorable coordination environments and electronic structures and be beneficial for their catalytic activities.
Ge-based sulfides have a higher ionic potential compared with the Sn-based one, which could promote the adsorption of electrolytes and enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency.26,27 Herein, Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals were successfully synthesized through the hot injection method and then uniformly coated onto the surface of graphite felt as electrodes. The ones containing Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals can selectively boost the electrocatalytic activities of S2−/Sx2− redox reactions and suppress the hydrogen evolution side reactions at the same time. The polysulfide/iodide flow battery with Cu2CoGeS4 can produce a high energy efficiency of 77.2% at 20 mA cm−2, a power density of 40.7 mW cm−2 and a stable energy efficiency retention of 92% after approximately 250 continuous cycles.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Cu2XGeS4 nanocrystals
In a typical synthesis, copper(II) acetylacetonate (0.26 g, 1 mmol), cobalt(II) acetylacetonate (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol) and germanium(IV) chloride (0.06 mL, 0.5 mmol) were mixed with oleylamine (10 mL) in a three-neck round bottom flask at 100 °C for 30 minutes to eliminate foreign water and dissolved oxygen. Then, the solution was heated to 140 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and a mixture solution of 1-dodecanethiol (0.37 mL) and tert-dodecylmercaptan (2.63 mL) was quickly injected into the flask. The mixture was subsequently heated to 280 °C and this temperature was maintained for 120 minutes to allow the growth of Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals. Finally, the products were washed with absolute ethanol and dispersed in trichloromethane for further use. Other Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals can be obtained by replacing cobalt(II) acetylacetonate with ferric(III) acetylacetonate (0.18 g, 0.5 mmol), nickel(II) acetylacetonate (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol), cadmium(II) acetylacetonate (0.16 g, 0.5 mmol), and manganese(II) acetylacetonate (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol), respectively.
2.2 Synthesis of GF–Cu2XGeS4 composite electrodes
The graphite felt was first cut into small pieces of 1.2 cm × 1.2 cm × 3 mm, immersed in 6 M sulfuric acid for 12 hours, then rinsed using deionized water to neutral, and finally annealed at 350 °C for 2 hours to improve the electrochemical activity and hydrophilicity of the graphite felt. The treated graphite felt was immersed in the as-synthesized Cu2XGeS4 dispersions for 12 hours, and then annealed at 400 °C for 30 minutes to remove the organic in the dispersion.28 Firstly, the size and weight of graphite felt are the same; then we calculated the amount of the catalysts through the change in total mass before and after. Thereby GF–Cu2XGeS4 composite electrodes were obtained.
2.3 Fabrication of a flow battery
The flow battery used in this study was similar to previous reports with interdigitated flow fields and a geometric active area of 1.44 cm2 (1.2 cm × 1.2 cm) and thickness of 3 mm.29 Carbon paper (Beijing Jinglong Carbon Technology Co., Ltd.) was used as the current collector. The treated graphite felt was used as the positive electrode. A GF–Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) composite electrodes were used at the negative side. Two Nafion membranes, one N117 (183 μm) and one N115 (127 μm) were used as separators to reduce electrolyte crossover. First, the Nafion membrane was placed in 5 wt% hydrogen peroxide at 80 °C for 1 hour, rinsed with deionized water, then transferred to 5 wt% sulfuric acid solution at 80 °C for 1 hour, rinsed, and finally placed in 1 M sodium hydroxide solution at 80 °C for 2 hours to enhance the Nafion membrane Na+ conductivity, and finally, washed to neutral. The negative electrolyte used was 5 mL 2 M Na2S2. Lu et al. reported that Br− can play an important role in stabilizing I2 and improving the discharge capacity;30 so, we used 5 mL 2 M NaI + 0.5 M I2 + 0.5 M NaBr as the positive electrolyte. The electrolyte was continuously bubbled in argon for 30 minutes at room temperature to remove oxygen before use. The electrolytes were pumped from the electrolyte reservoirs to the flow cell compartments by using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 14 mL min−1.
2.4 Characterization
XRD data were collected using a Bruker-D8 advance equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1; X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The morphologies of materials were conducted using a Nova NanoSEM 450 field-emission scanning electron microscope and a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. XPS was performed on an AXIS ULTRA DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The elemental content was tested by EDX and ICP-optical emission spectroscopy (iCAP7600). The UV-Vis absorption spectrum was obtained using a Lambda 750S (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA). Raman spectra were recorded using a DXR Raman spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at an excitation radiation wavelength of 532 nm.
2.5 Adsorption test
The GF–Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) with the same mass was added into 10 mL polysulfide (15 mM Na2S2) aqueous solution separately, and stirred for 12 hours. The UV-Vis spectrum of the solutions was further recorded for comparison.
2.6. Electrochemical tests
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation with Pt foil as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode at different scan rates. 0.06 M NaI + 0.02 M I2 + 0.03 M NaBr + 0.5 M NaCl mixed solutions were used as the positive electrolyte with a glassy carbon working electrode. 0.06 M Na2S + 0.02 M S + 0.5 M NaCl mixed solutions were used as the negative electrolyte with a CP–Cu2XGeS4 (carbon paper) working electrode. We also use pristine CP as the working electrode to better illustrate the catalytic properties of the synthesized materials. NaCl solutions are employed as a supporting electrolyte to improve the ion conductivity. The CP–Cu2XGeS4 working electrode was prepared by dropping 80 μL nanocrystalline dispersion onto carbon paper and then heat treated at 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded with a three-electrode system in 0.1 M KOH and 2 M Na2S4 electrolytes with different working electrodes at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The flow battery galvanostatic charge and discharge test was carried out on a LAND battery test system; the charging process was limited by the 50% of the theoretical capacity, and the discharging process was limited by a cut-off voltage of 0.1 V or 50% of the theoretical capacity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted using a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation with 10 mV amplitude voltage under potentiostatic conditions in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The impedance tests of different nanocrystals were conducted using a two-electrode system with CP–Cu2XGeS4 as positive and negative electrodes in the 0.06 M Na2S + 0.02 M S + 0.5 M NaCl mixed solutions. The EIS tests of the flow battery were recorded using a two-electrode system; the flow battery positive and negative electrodes correspond to the workstation. The polarization curves and power density measurements were obtained using a CHI760E workstation (CH Instrument) with a linear sweep voltammetry electrochemical technique.
3. Results and discussion
The Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals were successfully synthesized through the hot injection method (for details see the Experimental section). Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the Cu2XGeS4 nanocrystals. Seven distinct diffraction peaks appeared in the range of 2θ from 20° to 70°, at 2θ = 27.19°, 28.53°, 30.79°, 40.03°, 48.38°, 52.23° and 57.43°, corresponding to the (210), (002), (211), (022), (312), (023), and (232) planes.31 The two red lines are the Standard JCPDS card no. 26-535 of the Cu2MnGeS4 and no. 43-1387 of the Cu2CdGeS4. Since there is no corresponding peak standard card of Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni) in the database and elements Mn/Fe/Co/Ni belong to the same element period, the ionic radius is close; so, we think that Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni) and Cu2MnGeS4 have similar diffraction peaks, and the XRD patterns confirmed this point. Since the ionic radii of Cd, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni are 97, 80, 76, 74, and 72 pm, respectively, the interplanar spacing is not the same, making the corresponding diffraction peaks shift.32,33 In addition, there are no impurity peaks in the patterns. However, the XRD patterns alone do not fully explain the composition of the phase, so further characterization is required. Considering Cu2CoGeS4 as an example, Fig. 1b shows the XPS analysis results for the investigation of the composition and chemical valence of elements. The Cu 2p spectrum in Fig. 1a shows two characteristic peaks at 931.5 eV and 951.2 eV, and the peak splitting energy between the two peaks was 19.7 eV. These values are similar to the Cu+ values reported in the literature and can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2,34 respectively. The Co 2p spectrum shows characteristic peaks at 779.9 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 795.5 eV (Co 2p1/2), indicating the existence of Co2+, consistent with the literature report.35 The 3d peak of Ge appears at 30.53 eV, which indicates the existence of Ge4+ appears on it.36 The 2p peaks of S appeared at 161.4 eV and 162.6 eV, and belong to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, which is consistent with the S2− results reported in the literature.37 The XPS results show that there are no other valences for each element. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the crystal structure of the synthesized nanomaterials, room temperature Raman spectroscopy was conducted. It can be seen from Fig. S1† that two Raman peaks appear at 269, 328 cm−1 nearly. Since the Raman spectra of our synthesized nanomaterials are not well documented, the exclusion method is used to determine the purity of the phase. There are no Raman peaks of other binary or ternary compounds, such as, Cu2−xS (427 cm−1),32 CoS (475, 517 and 676 cm−1),38 CoS2 (292, 323 and 393 cm−1),39 Cu2GeS3 (272, 334 and 378 cm−1),40 GeS (238 cm−1),41 and GeS2 (342 cm−1).42 On the one hand, it might indicate that these impurities are not in the synthesized compound; on the other hand, it is possible that the content of these impurities is extremely low, below the detection limit of the Raman spectrum. In addition, the nanocrystals were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. S2†), which showed a Cu/X/Ge/S atomic ratio of 2/1/1/4 approximately, corresponding well with the elemental ratio of Cu2XGeS4.

Fig. 2 illustrates the TEM images of Cu2XGeS4 (Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, and Mn) nanocrystals. As can be seen from the figure, the nanocrystals have good dispersion and no agglomeration occurs. In addition, the TEM images show that the nanocrystals have a spherical morphology, while the shape is regular and the particle size is homogeneous. Fig. 2 shows a typical high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image as well. The clear lattice fringes indicate that the nanoparticles crystallize well. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image of Fig. 2f shows well-defined rings corresponding to the (002), (210), and (400) planes, which indicated the polycrystalline characteristics. Different nanocrystals have a similar morphology; the universal synthesis of Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals was demonstrated. In addition, it can be seen that the particle size distribution of various nanocrystals was relatively close, concentrated at 12–14 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on both the electrolytes to investigate the electrochemical properties of the redox couples. During the charge process, the S42− is reduced to S22− at the negative side and the I− is oxidized to the I3− at the positive side. During the discharge process, the reaction is reversed. Cyclic voltammetry of the anolyte with different CP–Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) working electrodes (details are shown in the Experimental section) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was conducted (Fig. 3a). The electrochemical test results show that Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) exhibits certain catalytic activity for the polysulfide couple. It is worth noting that there is multiple electron transfer in the voltage range of −1.2 to 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which has two oxidation peaks and one reduction peak. This suggests that polysulfide may undergo more Sx2− (x = 2–8) species electrochemical reaction.43 Among them, Cu2CoGeS4 shows a largest peak current density, indicating that the S2−/Sx2− redox kinetics are significantly improved. As the CV scan rate increased from 10 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1, the separation between reduction and oxidation peaks gradually increased (Fig. S3†), suggesting that the redox couple of S22−/S42− is quasi-reversible.44 Similarly, the peak current density shows a good linear response to the square root of the scanning rates (Fig. S3b†), which indicates that the reaction rate of the S22−/S42− redox couple is mainly limited by the diffusion process.45 Fig. S4† shows 200 consecutive cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1; it can be observed that 200 cycles almost overlap, indicating that Cu2CoGeS4 shows a good stability in the polysulfide system. In addition, two symmetrical CP–Cu2XGeS4 electrodes in the polysulfide electrolyte were used to test the impedance of different nanocrystals (Fig. 3b), and the fitting results also showed that Cu2CoGeS4 has the minimum interface transfer resistance (Table 1).

The adsorption behavior of different electrodes is one of the factors of the electrocatalytic process. As shown in Fig. 3c, the color of the Na2S2 aqueous solution has a significant change, and the adsorption performance was indicated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis). Fig. 3d shows the relationship between reduction peak current density and ΔAbs. for different electrodes. However, Cu2MnGeS4 has the highest adsorption ability, which is not good for the desorption of polysulfide ions and affects the charge transfer process, resulting in the smaller current of Cu2MnGeS4 than Cu2CoGeS4. Thus, the proper adsorption ability of the catalyst, Cu2CoGeS4, is beneficial to promote the catalytic activity to the redox of polysulfide.
In addition, linear sweep voltammetry curves for different materials in 2 M Na2S4 solution were recorded, and HER curves in KOH solutions of the same pH were obtained. The pristine untreated carbon paper (CP) working electrode was used for comparison. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the hydrogen evolution performance of different materials in 0.1 M KOH shows little difference, and the current density at −1.0 V is almost close, and hydrogen evolution performance is poor. However, there was a significant difference in the LSV curve in 2 M Na2S4 solution (Fig. 4b), and the parameters are summarized in Table 2. Cu2CoGeS4 shows the maximum current density, indicating that Cu2CoGeS4 selectivity enhances the reduction of S42− to S22−, but has little effect on the hydrogen evolution reaction.

For the polyiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, there are well-defined oxidation and reduction peaks in the potential range of 0–0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 4c). The peak separation is about 300 mV, which is similar to that reported previously.46 Hence, by averaging the oxidation and reduction peak potential at a low sweeping rate (Fig. 4c), a standard potential of 1.092 V could be obtained based on reactions (1) and (2):
Positive: I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−, E = 0.423 V(1)
Negative: 2S22− ↔ S42− + 2e−, E = −0.669 V(2)

Fig. 4d shows the polysulfide/iodide redox flow battery configurations. Firstly, the Cu2XGeS4 nanocrystals were loaded on the GF by dipping and annealing processes under a N2 atmosphere. Fig. 5 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of pristine GF and Cu2CoGeS4-modified GF. Fig. 5a and b show the smooth surface of pristine GF, respectively, Fig. 5c and d show that catalyst particles are distributed uniformly on the GF surfaces. Fig. S5† shows the elemental mapping diagram. It can be seen that no other elements are examined except Cu, Co, Ge and S, which further proves that the Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals are uniformly distributed on the GF surfaces.

Polysulfide/iodide flow batteries based on different GF–Cu2XGeS4 negative electrodes were assembled, and the galvanostatic cycling performance of different electrodes at 20 mA cm−2 current density was compared. Fig. 6 shows that the average energy efficiency (EE) of different electrodes was 50.2% (GF–Cu2CdGeS4), 38.5% (GF–Cu2FeGeS4), 39.6% (GF–Cu2MnGeS4), 53.8% (GF–Cu2NiGeS4), 70.2% (GF–Cu2CoGeS4), and 46.1% (pristine GF). The EE value of the electrode modified using Cu2CoGeS4 was significantly higher than that of other electrodes, delivering an EE of 70.4% at 20 mA cm−2 and 87.0% EE retention for 60 cycles, showing the best performance. Other composite electrodes have a large over-potential (highest charge voltage and lowest discharge voltage at the same current density) during the charge and discharge process (Fig. 7a), and more side reactions occurred, such as hydrogen evolution, resulting in a decrease in energy efficiency, even lower than that of pristine GF. In addition, the discharge polarization curves and power density curves of the cells were collected, as given in Fig. 7b, and clearly revealed that the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 composite electrode exhibited a peak power density of 40.7 mW cm−2, and it shows a significant improvement compared to the pristine GF electrode (11.8 mW cm−2). The discharge polarization curves show that the open circuit voltage of the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 cell is 1.026 V, which is consistent with the standard potential obtained in Fig. 4c. The polarization curves of charge and discharge (Fig. 7c) also show that Cu2CoGeS4 has a minimum overpotential. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interface charge transfer resistance (Rct) and evaluate the electrode electrochemical activity. The EIS plots of the flow batteries with different electrodes are simulated in Fig. 7d. The corresponding results are summarized in Table S1.† In the Nyquist diagram of the electrodes, the semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrolyte/electrode interface.47 It is obviously seen that the Rct1 of different electrodes is given, respectively that of Co, Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, and GF is 0.37, 0.98, 1.24, 3.08, 3.63, and 2.61 Ω cm2, and the Rct2 of different electrodes is 1.82, 4.32, 27.06, 32.57, 5.14, and 19.43 Ω cm2, respectively. It can be seen that the Rct of the Cu2CoGeS4 composite electrode is significantly reduced. The EIS results further indicated that the Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystal can facilitate the charge transfer process and increase the diffusion kinetics, which is also well consistent with the aforementioned CV results. Therefore, further performance tests were mainly focused on the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 composite electrode cell.

The battery performance of the graphite felt modified with the catalyst and pristine graphite felt was compared in terms of the coulombic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE), and energy efficiency (EE), which is also conducted at different current densities varying from 10 to 60 mA cm−2 with an increment of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8). The CE is the ratio of the discharge to charge capacity, while the VE value is the derivative of the CE and EE (VE = EE/CE). The EE of the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 cell decreased from 73.8% at 10 mA cm−2 to 35.2% at 60 mA cm−2. But the CE value remained above about 95% for all current densities. The observed trends in energy efficiency and voltage efficiency are mainly due to the increase in over-potential at higher current densities (Fig. 8c). The charge–discharge voltage profiles over time are provided in Fig. 8d; it can also be seen that the use of GF–Cu2CoGeS4 has a significantly reduced over-potential. The catalytic active sites in the Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals accelerate the electron transfer; hence, the cell performance was improved.

(d) Representative charge–discharge voltage profiles over time at 20 mA cm−2 current density. 
To further validate galvanostatic cycling performance, long cycling of the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 cell at 40 mA cm−2 was conducted (Fig. S7a†). We can conclude an EE of 50.0% and 87.0% retention for 80 cycles. Fig. S7b† shows the galvanostatic charge and discharge curves with 10% SOC at a current density of 20 mA cm−2. The first EE of the battery is up to 77.2%, and the EE retention was 92% after 250 cycles with several electrolyte refreshments. Fig. S6† shows the surface morphology of the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 electrode after 50 cycles at 20 mA cm−2. The composite electrode was washed with deionized water several times to remove the sulfide and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. We can still see that electrocatalysts distributed well on the surfaces of the GF. To further illustrate the stability of the GF–Cu2CoGeS4 electrode, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) tests on the negative electrolyte after 50 cycles to detect the content of Cu and Co were performed. The content of Cu is 3.2 ppm, and that of Co is 0.45 ppm, indicating that the stability of the composite electrode is better. In short, based on our results discussed above, we believe that developing composite electrodes and electrolytes will further improve the efficiency and cycling stability of polysulfide–iodide redox flow batteries.
4. Conclusions
In summary, Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals were successfully synthesized through the hot injection method. The different kinds of Cu2XGeS4 crystalline were uniformly coated onto the surfaces of GF, which can act as electrocatalysts in aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow batteries. These electrodes can successfully suppress the water splitting side reactions, especially the hydrogen evolution reaction. The ones with Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals can significantly boost electrocatalytic activities of S2−/Sx2− redox reactions for the proper adsorbability of polysulfides, which can improve the charge transfer process and selectively facilitate the electro-conversion reactions of polysulfides. Therefore, the flow battery with GF–Cu2CoGeS4 gives a high EE of 77.2% at 20 mA cm−2 and the EE retention of 92% after about 250 continuous cycles. And the composite electrode exhibits better mechanical stability, leading to more stable cycling performance. The current research represents an important trend that development of highly efficient polysulfide catalytic materials is important in improving the performance of polysulfide-based flow batteries, further boosting the development and application of flow batteries.
