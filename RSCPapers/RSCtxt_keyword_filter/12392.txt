    , Accepted 15th January 2016First published on 18th January 2016AbstractWe report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of two conjugated small-molecule acetylenic compounds based on a dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole (DT-DPP) core. In contrast with the parent molecule in which the DT-DPP core and the 9-(1-(3-dodecylthienyl)ethynyl)anthracen-10-yl endgroups are bridged through an acetylenic bond, incorporating a 1,4-phenylene moiety, connected to the same core and endgroups via the acetylenic linkage, leads to considerably enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE). Specifically, the lowering of the HOMO level of the resulting compound is supported by DFT calculation of the molecular structures, cyclic voltammetry experiments and increased open-circuit voltage (Voc). Moreover, while the lowest-energy absorption maximum is blueshifted, this molecular engineering produces a strong and broad absorption in the visible, as well as a high mobility of 4.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, thus contributing to improve the short-circuit current (Jsc), as evidenced by EQE measurements. The preliminary characterization of the solar cells based on the 1,4-phenylene engineered compound (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/acetylenic molecular compound:PC61BM/Al) yielded a PCE of ≈5% with Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.87 V, and FF = 63%, which is of considerable significance in view of synthetic accessibility and involving no high-boiling-point solvent additives or solvent vapor annealing, whereas a PCE of 3.86% was obtained for the parent compound with Jsc = 8.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.73 V, and FF = 64.6%. The present result may provide a simple approach for modulating the electronic properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells.
Introduction
Solution-processable organic semiconductors that contain an acetylenic linkage have received increasing attention as electron donors for bulk hetero-junction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs)1–6 because of the following advantages: (1) the weak electron withdrawing nature due to the sp-hybridized carbon atoms may provide a deeper HOMO level; (2) the cylinder-like π-electron density is more adaptable to conformational and steric constraints;7 (3) in synergy with other “green” synthetic routes,8,9 toxic stannyl intermediates or potentially risky lithiation reactions can be avoid.1a,6
Recently we reported a conjugated acetylenic molecular compound DT-DPP(AAnAT)26 based on a dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole core (DT-DPP) (Fig. 1).10–13 A PCE of 4.39% with Voc ≈ 0.77 V was obtained in a simple device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DT-DPP(AAnAT)2:PC61BM/Al) involving no high-boiling-point solvent additives or solvent vapor annealing.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of An-1, An-2 and DT-DPP(AAnAT)2. 
In this contribution, we further introduce two small molecular donors, An-1 and An-2, for OSCs, featuring an acetylenic linkage (Fig. 1) and illustrate simple and effective modulation of the electronic properties of the linear conjugated molecular system, leading to improved photovoltaic performance.

An-1 is an analogue of DT-DPP(AAnAT)2 with a longer alkyl chain and possesses a better solubility. An-2 is a derivative of An-1 by incorporating the 1,4-phenylene moiety, linked simultaneously to the DT-DPP core and 9-(1-(3-dodecylthienyl)ethynyl)anthracen-10-yl endgroups through an acetylenic bond. Since the 1,4-phenylene unit has a high aromatic resonance stabilization energy, π-electrons are relatively localized within the phenylene ring rather than delocalized over the whole molecule, so that the intramolecular charge transfer is partly confined with the strong electron-donating thiophene moieties away from the electron-accepting group (DT-DPP). This molecular engineering gives rise to a deeper HOMO level, a strong and broad absorption in the visible and enhanced hole mobility of An-2, and thus an improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of compounds An-1 and An-2 involves multiple Sonogashira coupling reactions, and is outlined in Scheme 1. The starting compounds 1 and 5 were prepared according to the literature methods.6,14 The intermediate bromo compound (2) was obtained in 66% yield by mono-Sonogashira reaction of compound 1 with 1,4-dibromobenzene, which further reacted with trimethylsilylacetylene to produce compound 3. The ensuing detrimethylsilylation with K2CO3 in THF/methanol led to 3-dodecyl-2-(2-(9-(2-(4-ethynylphenyl)-ethynyl)anthracen-10-yl)ethynyl)-thiophene (4). Finally two-fold Sonogashira reactions of compounds 1 and 4 with 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione afforded the target products An-1 and An-2, respectively. The identity and purity of the new compounds are evidenced by TLC, 1H NMR, MS (MALDI-TOF) and microanalysis (See Fig. S1–S9 in the ESI†). By introducing longer alkyl-chains, An-1 and An-2 exhibit good solubilities in common organic solvents, for instance, over 25 mg mL−1 in CHCl3.

Molecular modeling and optical properties
The theoretical calculation suggests that An-1 and An-2 are coplanar, except that the 3-alkylthienyl endgroups have dihedral angles of 11.1° and 12.6° against the neighboring anthracenyl rings. The detailed information on the various dihedral angles involving the relevant aryl rings are presented in Table S1 (ESI†).
The HOMO of An-1 appears to be delocalized over the whole molecular backbone, while the LUMO mainly localized on the DT-DPP core, anthracenyl and in-between acetylene bonds. However, both the HOMO and the LUMO of An-2 seem to be more localized on the DT-DPP core, 1, 4-phenylene and in-between acetylene bonds (Fig. 2).

The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are −4.65 and −2.94 eV for An-1 and −4.77 and −2.90 eV for An-2, respectively. This deeper HOMO level of An-2 supports the hypothesis of molecular design, which is further confirmed by the result obtained from the cyclic voltammetry measurement (Fig. 4 and Table 1).

An-1 shows a predominant absorption between 600 and 700 nm with the maxima at 632 nm in dilute CHCl3 solution, as observed in the analogue compound reported recently.6 Introducing an additional 1-ethynylphenylene-4-yl moiety produces a blue shift of this low-energy absorption, which further splits into two peaks at 583 and 623 nm, respectively. Moreover, the absorption intensity at around 331 and 467 nm increases considerably (Table 1).
In the solid state, the absorption spectra of both the compounds are largely redshifted, indicative of strong intermolecular interactions. Differing from An-1, which possesses a major absorption maximum at 653 nm with a lower energy shoulder at 735 nm, An-2 exhibits a broad absorption between 400 and 750 nm, featuring multiple peaks at 524, 625 and 691 nm with close intensities. No lower-energy absorption shoulder occurs for An-2. Based on the film absorption onset, the bandgap Eg is estimated as 1.54 and 1.65 eV for An-1 and An-2, respectively.
Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of An-1 and An-2 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 4 and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. Similar to DT-DPP(AAnAT)2, An-1 displayed a first reversible electron oxidation at ∼0.81 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a second quasi-reversible electron oxidation at a higher voltage.6 By contrast, An-2 exhibits a reversible electron oxidation at about 0.90 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the voltage range of 0–1.3 V. Based on the electrochemical data, the HOMO levels for An-1 and An-2 were estimated as −5.27 and −5.36 eV, respectively, with reference to the energy level of ferrocene. Consequently, the LUMO levels are derived as −3.74 eV for An-1 and −3.69 eV for An-2.
Thermal properties
For An-1 and An-2, thermogravimetric analysis reveals no mass variations until heated up to 300 °C (See Fig. S10 in the ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization shows that both compounds are crystalline solids. An-1 melts at ca. 220 °C and remelts after crystallization upon cooling. An-2 exhibits a similar behavior with an increased melting point of ca. 237 °C (Fig. 5).

Hole mobilities
In order to investigate the hole transport characteristics of An-1 and An-2, the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3(10 nm)/Al) were fabricated using MoO3 as the electron blocking layer. The measurements were performed on the as-cast and thermally annealed neat semiconductor films and their blends with PC61BM. At low voltage, the device current shows a clear quadratic dependence on the voltage, indicating SCLC characteristics (Fig. 6).

PEDOT:PSS was used as a hole injection layer at the anode, and a vacuum-deposited molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) layer as an electron-blocking layer at the cathode. (a) Neat donor films of An-1 and An-2 (b) the blend films. The active layer was spin-cast from 20 mg mL−1 of CHCl3 solution, spin speed: 3000 rpm. The measurements were carried out on the as-cast and thermally annealed films at 50 °C for 10 min. 
The hole mobilities of An-1 and An-2 are calculated by fitting the J1/2–V curves with the SCLC model in accordance with Mott–Gurney's square law:16 (1)where ε is the permittivity, ε = ε0εr (ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, εr is the relative permittivity and assumed as approximately 3.0), d is the thickness of the active layer, V is the applied voltage (effective voltage corrected by subtracting from the applied voltage (Vappl) the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) resulting from the series resistance.
The as-cast films of An-1 and An-2 show a high hole mobility (μh) of 2.30 × 10−4 and 3.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After mild annealing the neat active layer film at 50 °C for 10 min, μh further increases to 2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for An-1 and 4.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for An-2. The higher hole mobility of An-2 benefits for organic photovoltaic devices (Table 2).

Blending An-1 and An-2 with the electron acceptor PC61BM led to a reduction of hole mobility. For instance, the resulting μh turned out to be 5.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for An-1:PC61BM (2:3 w/w) and 7.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for An-2:PC61BM (1:1 w/w) after thermal treatment at 50 °C for 10 min.
Photovoltaic performance
The potentiality of solution-processed An-1 and An-2 was first examined as an electron donor (D) in BHJ solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al) using PC61BM as the electron acceptor (A) [ITO = indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS = poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) as the hole collection layer]. The measurements were carried out on the as-cast and thermally annealed active layer. All cells were tested under simulated AM 1.5 G with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic characteristics involving various electron donor (D):acceptor (A) weight ratios, namely 3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 1:2 (w/w), are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†) and the relevant data are summarized in Table 3.

The photovoltaic device that consisted of the as-cast active layer An-1:PC61BM (2:3 w/w) provided a PCE of 3.56% with Jsc = 7.40 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.73 V and FF = 65.88% (Fig. 7). Under the same circumstances, increasing the content of PC61BM to a weight ratio of 1:2 nevertheless resulted in a slight decrease of PCE to 3.19%.
 Fig. 7  Current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/An-1 or An-2:PC61BM/Al), under simulated AM1.5 G with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The active layer was spin-cast from chloroform solution (total concentration, 20 mg mL−1) with (w) or without (w/o) thermal annealing (TA) at 50 °C for 10 min. Device area: 0.16 cm2. 
Thermal annealing of the active layer at a mild temperature appeared to produce a generally modest increase of the PCEs (Table 3). For instance, while the active layer An-1:PC61BM (2:3, w/w) was annealed at 50 °C for ca. 10 min, the resulting PCE was increased to 3.86% with Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 8.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 64.59%.
Compared to DT-DPP(AAnAT)2, An-1 seems to give rise to a decreasing Jsc and thus PCE, which may be mainly attributed to its lower hole mobility (μh ≈ 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DT-DPP(AAnAT)2).6
By contrast, the analogue device containing a thermally annealed active layer An-2:PC61BM (1:1 w/w) produced a considerably improved PCE of 5.07% with Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2Voc = 0.87 V, and FF = 63.00%, whereas the unannealed device gave a Jsc of 9.08 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V, and an FF of 62.23, yielding a PCE of 4.86%.
The calculated Jsc values from the EQE measurements of the photovoltaic devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/the as-cast or thermally annealed active layer/Al) are 8.64 and 8.82 mA cm−2 for An1:PC61BM (2:3, w/w) and 9.67 and 10.64 mA cm−2 for An-2:PC61BM (1:1, w/w), respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental Jsc values (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  EQE plots of photovoltaic devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/An-1 or An-2:PC61BM/Al). Thermal annealing (TA): 50 °C. 
Overall, the strong and broad absorption in the visible, and the high hole mobility of An-2 as well as its lower HOMO level may contribute to its enhanced photovoltaic response, which is of considerable significance in view of the synthetic accessibility and involving no high-boiling solvent additive or solvent vapor annealing.1–6
Morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to study the surface morphology of the neat films of An-1 and An-2, and their blends with PC61BM (See Fig. S12 in the ESI†). The as-cast film of An-1 shows a smooth morphology with a root-mean-square roughness value of Rrms = 1.07 nm, while An-2 forms grain-like domains, indicating a stronger aggregating tendency, and yielding a higher Rrms of 3.70 nm (Fig. S12a and c, ESI†). Nevertheless, when mixed with PC61BM, the resulting blends, namely An-1:PC61BM = 2:3 and An-2:PC61BM = 1:1, tend to exhibit a similar surface morphology with a close Rrms of ca. 2.06 and 1.91 nm, respectively (Fig. S12e and g, ESI†). Thermally annealing the neat and blend films at 50 °C for 10 min appears to have no obvious effect on the film morphology (Fig. S12b, d, f and h, ESI†).
Experimental section

Mass spectrometry (MS) data were obtained on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF Analyzer. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Vario EL cube elemental analyzer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on an HP 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

Fabrication of hole-only devices
Hole-only devices were fabricated in the structure: ITO/PEDOT: PSS(40 nm)/active layer(100 nm)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al to measure the hole mobilities of neat donor films An-1 and An-2 and the donor–acceptor (PC61BM) blend films. PEDOT:PSS was used as a hole-injection layer at the anode, vacuum-deposited MoO3 as the electron blocking layer and Al as the cathode. The active layer films were spin-cast from chloroform solutions (concentration: 20 mg mL−1, spin speed: 3000 rpm).
Fabrication of organic solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. To fabricate photovoltaic devices, a hole-transport thin layer (ca. 40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm) was spin-cast onto the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 3500 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. The active layer was prepared by spin-casting chloroform solution (total concentration, 20 mg mL−1) at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a glove box with or without thermal annealing at 50 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the aluminum cathode (90 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer under high vacuum (<2–3 × 10−5 Pa). The cells were encapsulated by a thin glass slice. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The photovoltaic devices were characterized using a calibrated AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Conclusions
In summary, we have described a simple approach to modulate effectively the electronic properties of the aryl acetylenic molecular system based on the dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole unit. As compared to the parent molecule, introducing the 1,4-phenylene moiety linked through an acetylenic bond simultaneously to the central DT-DPP core and 9-(1-(3-dodecylthienyl)ethynyl)anthracen-10-yl endgroups produced several beneficial effects such as the lowering HOMO and LUMO levels, strong and broad absorption in the visible, and moreover enhanced hole mobility, thus contributing to increasing the photovoltaic response. Of importance, the resulting decrease of the HOMO level is clearly supported by the theoretical simulation of the molecular structures, cyclic voltammetry measurements and the increased open-circuit voltage of the BHJ solar cells by 0.14 V. Consequently, we achieved a PCE of ≈5.0% with Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.87 V and FF = 63% in a simple cell structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small-molecule acetylenic donor:PC61BM/Al) without involving solvent additives in the active layer or solvent vapour annealing. We are confident that further molecular and device engineering may afford considerably improved photovoltaic performance based on this class of facilely available materials.17 Besides, in view of the broad and intense absorption of 1,4-phenylene-containing a compound in the visible, the preliminary result on its utilization in the photo detector devices appears promising and shall be reported in due course.
