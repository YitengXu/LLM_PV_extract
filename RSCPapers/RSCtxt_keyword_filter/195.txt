    , Accepted 17th July 2012First published on 18th July 2012AbstractWe report the design, synthesis and characterization of two copolymers, PQTF and PQTTST, based on 3,3′′′-didodecylquaterthiophene (QT), fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole. The spectroscopic, thermal properties and electrochemical properties were investigated. Thermal gravimetric analysis showed that they have good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature higher than 400 °C. The UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that the introduction of a fluorene unit into the backbone of PQTF resulted in a blue-shift of the longest wavelength absorption and a reduction of the HOMO level to −5.32 eV, while the absorption spectra red-shifted, and the LUMO level reduced to −3.59 eV with the incorporation of a 2,5-dithienylsilole unit into the backbone of PQTTST. In comparison with the homopolymer PQT, the copolymers exhibited disordered alkyl chain stacking. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells fabricated with PQTTST and PC60BM displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 1.49%, short-circuit currents (Jsc) of 4.77 mA cm−2 and open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.72 V. This PCE is the highest recorded for QT-based polymer donor and PC60BM acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Polythiophene derivatives have attracted a great deal of attention in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties.1 A promising application is the use of these materials as the active semiconducting layer in organic solar cells, where solution processability can be exploited in the fabrication of large area, low-cost, and flexible devices.2,3 For example, a commonly used polymer donor material is the well-studied poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a PCE in excess of 5% has been reported for P3HT/[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) BHJ photovoltaic cells.4–6
Besides the P3HT polymer, many conjugated materials with a thiophene backbone have also been well studied. Recently, Ong et al. reported a new class of solution processable high-performance polythiophenes, poly(3,3′′′-didodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT)7,8 (Scheme 1), for organic field effect transistors (OFETs), which is similar to P3HT in structure and also shows similar absorption spectra. Compared to P3HT, PQT has longer alkyl side chains to induce a better crystalline structure for higher hole mobility (0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1),7 which is nearly twice as large as that of P3HT (0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1).9,10 In addition, PQT exhibits about 0.1 eV lower lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels (−5.1 eV) than P3HT.7 Such a lowered ionization energy could also be of interest for enhancing the chemical stability of the compound, as well as the device lifetime.11 Since the Voc of organic solar cells is limited by the difference of the HOMO level of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptor, solar cells using PQT as electron donor should reach a higher Voc than those based on P3HT.12 Hence, due to its lower HOMO level and higher hole mobility, together with a similar broad absorption spectrum to P3HT, which are the most important parameters for a successful polymer donor in photovoltaic devices, PQT offers the potential to be used in polymer/fullerene BHJ photovoltaic cells. However, BHJ photovoltaic devices using P3HT exhibited far superior properties to those using PQT.13–15 To the best of our knowledge, the PQT/PC60BM system produced the best device with an optimal PCE of 1.15% for a PC60BM loading of 80 wt%.16 By using the fullerene derivative PC70BM instead of PC60BM, a PCE of 1.4% could be obtained.17 The differences in device performance for these two similar polymers necessitate the study of the relationships between the solid structure and properties. Scherf et al. have made a comparative study between P3HT and PQT. The authors found that PQT forms nanoparticle dispersions in solution. The devices made from mixtures of PQT and fullerene consequently contained pre-formed PQT crystalline nanoparticles that cause mesoscopically demixed blends with low charge-separation efficiency.16 However, McGehee and coworkers observed that PC60BM molecules can intercalate into the alkyl chains and form a cocrystallized structure in solid state, which might be a reason for its low efficiency.18,19 Besides these morphological explorations, it is also of interest to design and synthesize QT-based copolymers with new functionalities.

In order to improve the PCEs, the most common and successful strategy is to decrease the band gaps of the polymer donors so as to maintain a broad overlap with the solar spectrum and ensure the effective harvesting of solar photons. This leads to a higher Jsc,20,21 and lowers the HOMO energy levels of the polymer donors to gain a larger Voc.22 In an effort to tailor the structure of PQT for optimized BHJ photovoltaic cells, we have synthesized two new QT-based copolymers, namely PQTF and PQTTST by introducing fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units as strategic building blocks. Fluorene has excellent oxidation stability and a high hole mobility, making it beneficial for reducing the HOMO energy level of the polymer donors.23 On the other hand, the 2,5-dithienylsilole units have high electron-accepting ability due to σ*–π* conjugation in the ring, which has thus been exploited to tune the LUMO energy level and to gain narrow band gaps.24,25 The influence on the thermal properties, morphology and energy levels by introducing fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units into the backbone have been investigated. A comparison between the photovoltaic properties based on the copolymer donors PQTF, PQTTST and the homopolymer PQT has also been carried out.
Experimental
Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over sodium and distilled under normal pressure from sodium benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen immediately prior to use. Commercial grade reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Commercially available PQT was purchased from American Dye Source with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 28000 g mol−1 and a polydispersity of 2. 5,5′′′-Dibromo-3,3′′′-didodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (M1),26 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-2-yl)-9,9′-dioctylfluorene (M2),27 5,5′′′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-3,3′′′-didodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (M3),28 and 1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenyl-2,5-bis(5′-bromo-2′-thienyl)-silole (M4)29,30 were synthesized according to the previously reported literature.
Instruments
The NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Mercury Plus 500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 3150 PC spectrophotometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of the copolymers was performed on a Shimadzu 10A series with polystyrene as the standard for calibration and THF as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Shimadzu thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (DSC) DTG-60H at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 on an AUTOLAB.PGSTAT30 potentiostat/galvanostat system (Ecochemie, Netherlands), which was equipped with a three-electrode cell. The polymer was cast onto a glass carbon disk as a working electrode and Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 mol L−1) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Scanning force microscopy was performed on a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100, operating in tapping mode. GIWAXS measurements were performed on Beamline 11.3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). A MAR image plate was used for signal collection.
The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (20 ± 5 ohms per sq) were bought from Thin Film Devices Inc., and were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in an oven overnight. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP A1 4083) (∼35 nm) was spin-coated on the ultraviolet ozone-treated ITO substrates. After annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air, the substrates were transferred to a glove box. Polymer–PCBM chlorobenzene solution was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at around 1000 rpm. The thickness of the film was ∼80–100 nm (KLA-TENCOR Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler). Finally, 1.5 nm of LiF and then a 100 nm thick Al cathode was deposited (area 6.5 mm2) on the active layer under high vacuum (2 × 10−4 Pa) using a thermal evaporator. All current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based Newport 91160300-W solar simulator. A Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as the white light source. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.
Synthesis of PQTF
Dibromoquaterthiophene (M1, 824.9 mg, 1 mmol), fluorene diboronate (M2, 642.6 mg, 1 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mol%) were added into a Schlenk tube in the glove box. Then degassed toluene (10 mL) and aqueous 2 M K2CO3 solution (5 mL) were added. The mixture was then heated to 85 °C for 48 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the organic layer was separated, concentrated, and precipitated into methanol. The resulting polymer was collected, dried, and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 24 h to remove the catalyst residue and low molecular weight oligomers. Finally, a deep red solid was obtained and dried overnight under vacuum at 50 °C. Yield: 64%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.69 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), 7.54 (s, 2H), 7.24 (s, 2H), 7.18 (d, 2H), 7.10 (d, 2H), 2.83 (br, 4H), 2.03 (br, 4H), 1.74 (br, 4H), 1.55–1.05 (br, 60H), 0.81 (m, 6H), 0.78 (m, 6H).
Synthesis of PQTTST
A degassed solution of the distannylquaterthiophene M3 (992.7 mg, 1 mmol), the 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-3,4-diphenylsilole monomer M4 (584.5 mg, 1 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mol %) in toluene (10 mL) was heated at 85 °C for 48 h under argon. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the organic layer was separated, concentrated, and precipitated into methanol. The resulting polymer was collected, dried, and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 24 h to remove the catalyst residue and low molecular weight oligomers. Finally, a black solid was obtained and dried overnight under vacuum at 50 °C. Yield: 53%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.24 (br, 6H), 7.10 (br, 2H), 7.04–6.95 (br, 9H), 6.77 (br, 3H), 2.71 (m, 4H), 1.57 (m, 4H), 1.50–1.10 (br, 36H), 0.80 (m, 6H).
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and characterization
The standard Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling procedures were used for the preparation of PQTF and PQTTST, and the synthetic route was shown in Scheme 1. PQTF and PQTTST had a better solubility than PQT in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF and toluene without gel formation. The structures of the copolymers were verified by 1H NMR (Fig. 1). For PQTF, the characteristic peaks of the doublet, doublet and singlet, respectively at 7.69, 7.61 and 7.54 ppm could be assigned to the protons of the fluorene unit, while the peaks of singlet, doublet and doublet, respectively at 7.24, 7.18, 7.10 ppm are attributed to the protons of the quaterthiophene unit. The signals of the α-protons of the octyl groups at the 9-position of fluorene and the dodecyl group at the 3-position of thiophene could also be detected at 2.03 and 2.83 ppm, respectively. PQTTST also exhibits broad peaks at 7.24, 7.10, 7.04–6.95, and 6.77 ppm, while the broad peak at 2.71 ppm is attributed to the α-protons of the dodecyl group at the 3-position of thiophene. The number-average and weight-average molecular weights for PQTF were 14990 and 29740, and those for PQTTST were 10800 and 25090, with a polydispersity of 2.0 and 2.3, respectively, as determined by GPC against polystyrene standards.

The thermal properties of PQTF and PQTTST were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The excellent thermal stability of both copolymers was manifested in their TGA profiles, showing decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss respectively at about 402 °C and 427 °C (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the DSC heating and cooling traces of the copolymers. The heating trace of PQTTST exhibited a glass transition at around 64 °C and a melting peak at 234 °C. During the cooling process, crystallization occurred at around 145 °C. For PQTF, a melting endothermal peak appeared at 189 °C on heating, and a crystallization exothermal peak appeared at 152 °C upon cooling, but the glass transition was not observed. Compared to the well-known liquid-crystalline polymer PQT, which exhibited at least two endotherms at about 120 °C and at 140 °C, respectively corresponding to crystal-to-liquid crystal and liquid crystal-to-isotropic phase transitions,7 no apparent liquid crystalline transitions were observed in both PQTF and PQTTST when heated up to 300 °C, probably due to the difference in molecular weight and backbone of the copolymers.31

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)
The structure order of the QT-based polymer thin films were studied by GIWAXS. Thin film samples were prepared on a silicon substrate by spin-coating from their chlorobenzene solutions. A 0.16° incident angle was used in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, PQT showed several obvious diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction, which characterized the structure normal to the substrates. This result is quite similar to other groups' observations,32 with an obvious (100) around 0.36 Å−1 (corresponding to a distance of 17.4 Å−1) and its second ordered peak in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the polymer adopted an edge-on orientation on the substrates. Also, a weak diffraction peak at 1.7 Å−1 in the in-plane direction was observed, which comes from π–π stacking. A shallow diffraction ring at 1.5 Å−1 was observed and was ascribed to some disordered peak, yet its nature is still not clear. Compared to PQT, PQTF and PQTTST showed a much weaker first ordered peak in diffraction, as shown in Fig. 4b, and the position is slightly shifted to low q, indicating a spacing change. A diffraction ring at 1.46 Å−1 and 1.35 Å−1 was observed for PQTF and PQTTST, respectively. They are similar to the 1.5 Å−1 diffraction from PQT, which we think come from disordered alkyl chain stacking.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers coated from the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution. It is obvious that the absorption maximum for PQT was found to be 535 nm with a shoulder at around 575 nm.7 The maximum absorption peaks of PQTF and PQTTST in the film were blue-shifted and red-shifted to 487 and 556 nm, respectively. We reasoned that this was caused by the change of conjugation length due to the introduction of fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units. Therefore, the optical band gaps (Eg) of PQT, PQTF and PQTTST, estimated from the absorption onset wavelength, were as low as 1.87, 2.0 and 1.79 eV, respectively. The lowered band gap of PQTTST provides favorable light harvesting properties.

The electrochemical properties of the polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). According to de Leeuw et al., the ionization potential (EHOMO) and electron affinity (ELUMO) are approximately equal to the onset of the first oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential (vs. Ag/Ag+) plus 4.7 eV, respectively.33 The anodic scan showed that the onset of oxidation for PQT, PQTF and PQTTST occurred at 0.36, 0.62 and 0.34 eV, respectively, which corresponded to HOMO levels of −5.06, −5.32 and −5.04 eV (Fig. 6). It is observed that the HOMO level of PQTF was significantly reduced (−5.32 eV) as a result of the incorporation of the higher ionization potential of the fluorene unit, which is beneficial for achieving a high Voc in solar cells. However, no significant change in the oxidative properties was observed between PQT and PQTTST. When scanning cathodically, all the copolymers exhibited reversible reduction waves, and the onset potentials of reduction for PQT, PQTF and PQTTST are −1.29, −1.27 and −1.11 eV, respectively, corresponding to LUMO levels of −3.41, −3.43 and −3.59 eV. The LUMO energy levels of PQT and PQTF were almost the same. However, the introduction of 2,5-diarylsilole units obviously reduced the LUMO level, which may be ascribed to the particularly low-lying LUMO of the 2,5-diarylsilole units. Compared to PQT, the incorporation of fluorene into the backbone of PQTF only reduced the HOMO level, while the LUMO level was hardly changed. In a similar manner, the incorporation of 2,5-diarylsilole in PQTTST only reduced the LUMO level, while the HOMO level was hardly influenced. PQTTST showed the smallest band gap of 1.45 eV, estimated from its redox properties (Table 1). Such a low band gap improves light absorption, leading to an enhanced Jsc. The energy levels and UV-vis absorption spectra are in good agreement.

Polymer solar cells
The photovoltaic characteristics were investigated with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC60BM/LiF/Al. For optimal photovoltaic performance, the best polymer/PC60BM weight ratio is approximately 1:4. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under solar simulator AM 1.5 illumination, and the photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 2. The PQT/PC60BM system showed a PCE of 1.03%, with a Jsc of 3.30 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.71 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44. This photovoltaic performance is similar to Scherf's report.16 Devices fabricated using PQTF and PQTTST as polymer donors showed considerably enhanced performance with a PCE of 1.39% and 1.49%, respectively. It is important to note that the value of the PCE for the PQTTST/PC60BM device is so far the highest recorded for QT-based polymer materials. The performance improvement from the PQT/PC60BM to the PQTF/PC60BM system was mainly attributed to the increase in both Voc (from 0.71 to 0.85 V) and the fill factor (from 0.44 to 0.51), while the performance improvement of the PQTTST/PC60BM system was mainly due to an increase of Jsc (from 3.30 to 4.77 mA cm−2).

The improvement in OPV performance by introducing fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units into the PQT backbone can be explained in terms of the energy level structures. Compared to PQT, PQTF has a lower HOMO level. Generally, the lower the HOMO levels of the polymer donor, the higher the Voc. However, a lower HOMO level would lead to an increased band gap in the polymer donor and less efficient light absorption (see UV-vis absorption part). Hence, the PQTF/PC60BM system showed the lowest Jsc of 3.08 mA cm−2. The theoretical upper limit for Jsc for a polymer solar cell is set by the number of excitons created during solar illumination. The increased Jsc value for PQTTST is corroborated by the thin-film absorption spectra and cyclic voltage of the polymers, where PQTTST possesses the lowest band gap among the polymers. Generally, low band gap polymers absorb more light, increasing the Jsc.
Since the film morphology is also important for device performances, the film surfaces are studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 8 shows tapping-mode topography of the homopolymer PQT and the copolymer/PC60BM (1:4 w/w) blend films on ITO substrates. All the blend films showed excellent miscibility between the polymer and PC60BM, showing uniform and pinhole-free surfaces. No nanoparticle aggregation could be identified for the blend films. All the polymer blend films show fine-scale phase separation in the range of 5–10 nm and have a root-mean-square (rms) roughness less than 1 nm. Compared with the PQTF blend film, PQTTST and PQT exhibit more smooth surface morphology.

Conclusions
Two alternative copolymers PQTF and PQTTST based on fluorene, 2,5-diarylsilole units and 3,3′′′-didodecylquaterthiophene were successfully synthesized by Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling reactions. Both copolymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and THF. They showed high thermal stability with degradation temperatures above 400 °C. However, no apparent liquid crystalline transitions were observed in both PQTF and PQTTST. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that, compared to the homopolymer PQT, the incorporation of a fluorene unit into the backbone only reduced the HOMO level, and the LUMO level was hardly influenced. The incorporation of 2,5-diarylsilole units into the backbone, however, obviously reduced the LUMO level, and the HOMO level was hardly influenced. Devices fabricated using PQTF and PQTTST as the polymer donor and PC60BM as acceptor showed considerably enhanced performances with a PCE of 1.39% and 1.49%, respectively, which is possibly due to the optimized energy levels and thin film morphologies.
