    , Accepted 21st October 2020First published on 10th November 2020AbstractIsomers with subtle differences in their molecular structure often exhibit different electronic/optoelectronic properties, charge-transport behaviors and photovoltaic performances. In this work, we describe BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β, three isomers with acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A–D–A) structures, in which a fused benzothiadiazole is the donor (D) unit and a single chlorine atom substituted at the δ, β or γ position of the benzene-fused end groups is the acceptor (A) unit. In general, changes in the position of the chlorine atom were found to lead to significantly different absorptions, energy levels, and photovoltaic performances. Compared to BTIC-2Cl-δ, the BTIC-2Cl-γ isomer shows similar UV/Vis absorption, energy levels, and molecular packing, but slightly better photovoltaic performance. A crystallographic analysis of BTIC-2Cl-δ indicates that the molecules easily form a three-dimensional (3D) network due to the noncovalent interactions of Cl⋯S, Cl⋯π and Cl⋯N. When blended with PBDB-TF as an electron-donor material, the devices based on BTIC-2Cl-γ exhibited higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 15.04% with an increased voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, which was better than that of BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices (14.13%) and much higher than that of BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices (7.39%). Our studies demonstrate that having the chlorine atom at the different positions of the end groups clearly affects the photovoltaic properties of the resulting acceptors.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have received much attention from both academia and industry due to their outstanding advantages of light weight, low cost, simple structure, flexibility and susceptibility to large area fabrication.1–3 At an early stage, fullerenes and their derivatives dominated the electron acceptor materials, but their power conversion efficiency (<12%)4,5 could not be improved due to their inherent shortcomings, which include weak absorption, insufficient stability, fixed energy levels and high cost.6–8 In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors (NFA) have reached many milestones in the past five years. Currently, the PCEs of single-junction OSC devices based on NFAs have exceeded 17%, approaching commercialization.9,10 Among them, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have come to the center of the stage of OSCs due to their simple synthesis, easily tunable molecular energy levels and outstanding photovoltaic performance.11–13
The concept of FREAs with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure was first proposed by Zhan et al.14 Subsequently, considerable efforts were devoted to tuning their structures. This included modification of the central cores,15 the bridge,16 the side chains17,18 and electron-withdrawing end groups.19,20 It was found that although the isomers often had very small variations in their molecular structures, these resulted in significant differences in the molecular stacking, absorption spectra, electronic structure and photovoltaic performance.21–23 An “isomeric effect” has been investigated in perylene diimide (PDI) isomers (bay/ortho isomers and 1,6-/1,7-regioisomers) with different photovoltaic performances.24,25 Regarding FREAs, examination of the isomerization of side chains and central cores was conducted. In 2016, Li et al.26 reported a new acceptor formed by the side-chain isomerization of ITIC with meta-alkyl phenyl substitution (m-ITIC), which showed significantly improved PCE (11.77%) due to its higher electron mobility and larger crystalline coherence. Some isomeric fused ring cores were also synthesized, including FNIC1 and FNIC2,27MeIC and MeIC1,28anti-Py-1 and syn-Py-2,29 and subtle structural changes were found to lead to very different optoelectronic properties and device performance. For example, OSCs based on PTB7-Th:FNIC2 (13.0%) blend films show a higher PCE than PTB7-Th:FNIC1 (10.3%) devices due to higher electron mobility, smaller ionization energy, and larger electron affinity. Yang et al. developed an asymmetrical small molecule acceptor named MeIC1, which is formed by isomerization of MeIC. Although the asymmetric isomer showed the same absorption range, its enhanced π–π stacking and electron mobility increased Voc and Jsc, and higher PCE of up to 12.58% was achieved. In addition, it was also proved that because of the position of the side chain on the thiophene spacer16 and regiochemistry of fluorine substitution, the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) unit also exhibited different optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.30 Although side chain and donor core isomers have been investigated, very limited attention has been paid to the isomeric effects in the end groups of FREAs because the benzene-fused end groups are often a mixture of two isomers that are very difficult to separate by common methods. Nevertheless, the design of isomeric end-capping groups has retained its importance in the construction of high-performance FREAs, and could provide a deeper understanding of the structure–property–performance relationship.
Herein, we report our synthesis of three non-fullerene FREAs, BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ and BTIC-2Cl-β (Scheme 1a), with isomeric chlorine-containing end groups. The structural difference between these three acceptors is the position of the Cl atom in the end groups. The Cl atom is located at the γ position of the benzene ring in BTIC-2Cl-γ, but at the δ position in BTIC-2Cl-δ and the β position in BTIC-2Cl-β. Our molecular design rationale is as follows: (1) the end groups IC-Cl-γ, IC-Cl-δ, and IC-Cl-β (Fig. S2†) all have one strong electron-withdrawing Cl atom, and with the downshift of energy levels, a stronger ability to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, and they are more easily synthesized.31–35 (2) The problem of the absence of site specificity of the monochlorinated IC end group isomers in the mixtures is resolved. The three isomers showed a similar absorption range (600–950 nm) and a very low bandgap (1.33–1.39 eV), but different molecular shapes, polarities and charge mobilities. OSCs based on the blends of BTIC-2Cl-γ and PBDB-TF exhibited an outstanding PCE of 15.04%, significantly higher than those of BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices (14.13%) and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices (7.39%). This study clearly showed that varying the position of the Cl atom in the end group is an effective strategy to design high performance A–D–A non-fullerene acceptors.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The molecular structures of the target molecules BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β are shown in Scheme 1a. Compounds BT-CHO, IC-Cl-δ, IC-Cl-γ, and IC-Cl-β (Fig. S1 and S2†) were synthesized according to a published procedure.17,20,35 Compounds BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β (Scheme 1b) were obtained as blue-black solids through the Knoevenagel condensation of BT-CHO with the corresponding end groups, which gave yields of over 90%. The molecular structures were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. At room temperature, they are all readily soluble in the common solvents, which aided their processing in solution.
The thermal stability of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β was studied with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S3†). From the TGA curves, the onset decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β under nitrogen were determined to be 312.8, 302.6, and 322.5 °C, respectively. No obvious melting peaks or glass transitions for the three acceptors were observed by DSC in the range of 50–250 °C. All these results indicated that the thermal stabilities of these three acceptors were adequate for their application in OSCs.
Single crystal structure
X-ray diffraction was used to understand the influence of the isomerization of the end groups on their molecular configuration and solid packing behavior. We successfully obtained single-crystals of BTIC-2Cl-δ by diffusing ethanol slowly into a solution of the compound in chloroform. The molecular geometry of BTIC-2Cl-δ (Fig. 1a and S4†) indicates that the molecular backbone of BTIC-2Cl-δ is planar. The branched alkyl chain on the N atom is distributed between both sides of the core, and the linear alkyl C11H23 chain on the thiophene unit is on one side of the π-core. This means that minor changes of the alkyl chains on the N atom may significantly affect the molecular stacking of solid BTIC-2Cl-δ. The dihedral angle between the IC-Cl-δ end group and the π-core was determined to be 9.3°, which is very small. Combined with its strong intramolecular S⋯O conformational locks (S⋯O distance: 2.67 Å), the BTIC-2Cl-δ molecular backbone shows good planarity. The BTIC-2Cl-δ dimers (Fig. 1b) exhibited partial overlap of the π-core unit of one molecule and the end group of adjacent molecules via the short π–π interactions of 3.34 Å and 3.38 Å (Fig. S5†). Different from Yang's single-crystal structure of Y6,36 no π–π interaction between two adjacent fused benzothiadiazole core units was observed. The short π–π stacking between the two adjacent molecules benefited from the multiple noncovalent interactions of Cl⋯S (3.84 Å), Cl⋯π (3.45 Å) (Fig. 1b), and Cl⋯N (3.07 Å) (Fig. S6†), and the good planarity of BTIC-2Cl-δ. The various noncovalent interactions in the BTIC-2Cl-δ crystal are also very beneficial for the molecular stacking and to build a 3D network (Fig. 1c and d), and it is possible that BTIC-2Cl-δ could deliver improved charge transport performance.

Absorption and energy levels

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β in dilute chloroform solution and thin-film states. In the chloroform solution, both of the isomers show strong and broad absorption in the 600–800 nm regions. Although BTIC-2Cl-γ (730 nm) shows a slight (4 nm and 6 nm) blue-shift of the maximum absorption peaks when compared with BTIC-2Cl-δ (734 nm) and BTIC-2Cl-β (736 nm), the maximum extinction coefficient of BTIC-2Cl-γ (1.83 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1) was slightly higher than that of BTIC-2Cl-δ (1.72 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1) or BTIC-2Cl-β (1.69 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1). In the thin film, all three isomers show broadened and more intense red-shifted absorption spectra, which indicated the existence of strong aggregation/crystallization forces in the film state. The larger redshift of BTIC-2Cl-γ (96.5 nm) when compared to those of BTIC-2Cl-δ (91.5 nm) and BTIC-2Cl-β (72 nm) may be related to the stronger intermolecular π–π packing caused by the increased length of the Cl–C bond when the Cl atom is at the γ position of the phenyl ring.37 The maximum absorption peak of BTIC-2Cl-γ (826.5 nm) is almost the same as that of BTIC-2Cl-δ (825.5 nm), and has a red-shift of about 20 nm compared to that of BTIC-2Cl-β (808 nm). For BTIC-2Cl-β, the much more blue-shifted absorption spectra than those of BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ may imply reduced aggregation properties in BTIC-2Cl-β when the IC-Cl-β end group is introduced. The optical band gaps of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β calculated from the absorption edge are determined to be 1.34, 1.33, and 1.39 eV, respectively. The narrow optical bandgaps of BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ assisted their forming good complementary absorption with the donor material, thereby capturing more sunlight and achieving a higher Jsc for their OSCs. The absorption spectra of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β-based blend films (Fig. S7†) were also investigated. All of them showed a slight blue shift compared to their pure films.

(d) Energy level diagrams for BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, BTIC-2Cl-β, and PBDB-TF. 
The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β in dichloromethane solution were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2c and Table 1).38,39 They all showed one irreversible reduction wave and two reversible oxidation waves. By comparing their oxidation potentials and reduction potentials with a ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0) redox couple, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β were determined to be −5.75/−4.14 eV, −5.74/−4.13 eV, and −5.64/−3.85 eV, respectively. The increase in the LUMO levels from BTIC-2Cl-β (−3.85 eV) to BTIC-2Cl-γ (−4.14 eV) is also consistent with the gradually enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect from BTIC-2Cl-β to BTIC-2Cl-γ. All these results indicate that the positional change of the chlorine atom in the end groups will affect their electrochemical and absorption properties, and the low LUMO energy also supported their obtaining a higher Voc in OSC devices.

Computational simulation
To further understand the effect of the chlorine isomerism in the end groups on the electronic properties of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β, DFT calculations were carried out using Gaussian software at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.40 To simplify the calculation, the alkyl chains of the molecules were all replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S8 and S9,† the dihedral angle between the central core and the end groups of BTIC-2Cl-γ was measured to be 0.493°, slightly higher than those of BTIC-2Cl-δ (0.246°) and BTIC-2Cl-β (0.138°). This shows that the largest steric hindrance occurs in BTIC-2Cl-γ when Cl was located at the γ position of the phenyl ring. These calculated results are also in accordance with the results of the UV-Vis spectra which showed 4 nm and 6 nm blue-shifts of BTIC-2Cl-γ when compared to BTIC-2Cl-δ and BTIC-2Cl-β in solution. The distributions of their electron density were also calculated, and it was shown that the LUMO energy levels were all distributed throughout the molecule, while the HOMO energy levels are mainly distributed on the D–A–D core unit. For BTIC-2Cl-γ, the calculated LUMO and HOMO are −3.549 and −5.596 eV, respectively; and the corresponding values for BTIC-2Cl-δ were calculated to be −3.562 and −5.595 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels of BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ were both lower than the corresponding values of BTIC-2Cl-β (HOMO: −5.543 eV, LUMO: −3.515 eV). These results are in good agreement with the electrochemical characterization, which supports the reliability of the calculation results.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β, three OSC devices were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-TF:chlorinated acceptor/MoO3/Ag. Due to its complementary absorption and energy levels when matched with the three chlorinated acceptors, PBDB-TF was chosen as the donor material.41 Chloroform was selected as the processing solvent and the total active layer blend solution of PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-γ (BTIC-2Cl-δ/BTIC-2Cl-β) (1:1.2, w/w) was 11 mg mL−1. Table 2 lists the key photovoltaic parameters of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-, BTIC-2Cl-δ-, and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices. As shown in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs (Fig. 3a), it is clear that the Voc of the BTIC-2Cl-γ (0.90 V)-based device is about 0.03 V higher than that of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based device (0.87 V). This is taken together with its slightly higher JSC (23.58 mA cm−2) and higher fill factor (FF, 70.98%) when compared with those of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based device (JSC = 23.18 mA cm−2, FF = 70.08). A higher PCE of 15.04% was obtained for the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based device, about 6.05% higher than that of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based device (14.13%). Although the BTIC-2Cl-β-based device showed the highest Voc (0.91 V), its PCE (7.39%) was the worst as a result of its sharply decreased JSC (16.71 mA cm−2) and FF (48.67%). A higher value of JSC × Voc was achieved for the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based device when compared with that of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based device, and this is responsible for the larger PCE of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based device. The very different photovoltaic performances of these three isomeric chlorinated acceptors also demonstrates the great potential of the strategy of the end group isomeric chlorination.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices are shown in Fig. 3b. The high and broad EQEs over the entire range from 300 to 840 nm suggest that all three acceptors and the polymer donor PBDB-TF make a considerable and complementary contribution to the final JSC values. The improved JSC values of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices resulted from their broader spectral response in the range of 300–800 nm, which is much higher than that of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices. A maximum value of 82.44% at 560 nm and over 72% in the 500–800 nm range indicated that a more highly efficient photoelectron conversion process is possible in the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices. Importantly, the rather high EQE values in the 670–810 nm range, where the light absorption can be mainly ascribed to the acceptor component BTIC-2Cl-γ, illustrate an efficient hole transfer process from BTIC-2Cl-γ to the polymer donor. Moreover, the quenching efficiencies for the polymer donor PBDB-TF and BTIC-2Cl-γ or BTIC-2Cl-δ were calculated to be 75% and 70% (Fig. S10†), respectively, and further support the aforementioned results. The integrated current densities of the BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices from the EQE spectra were calculated to be 22.67, 22.09, and 16.22 mA cm−2, respectively, showing a tolerable mismatch (3.58%, 4.93%, and 2.93%) with the JSC from J–V measurements.
The dependence of the photocurrent (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was characterized to study the effects of the different end groups on the photovoltaic performance of the resultant OSC devices. When the Veff reached about 1.1 V, it was found that the Jph of the devices could reach their saturation photocurrent (Jsat), suggesting a minimized charge recombination at the higher voltage. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Jsat of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based device (23.75 mA cm−2) was higher than that of devices based on BTIC-2Cl-δ (23.03 mA cm−2) and BTIC-2Cl-β (17.38 mA cm−2). The charge dissociation and charge collection probability [P(E,T)] of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices and the BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices under short-circuit current conditions is 89% and 72%, respectively, while the P(E,T) value of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices was increased to 91%. All these results indicate that the introduction of IC-Cl-γ end groups can optimize the morphology of the active layer and improve the charge dissociation and collection processes of the OSCs.
Correlations between the light intensity (Plight) and JSC were also measured. These can be described by the power-law equation JSC ∝ Plightα, where α denotes the extent of bimolecular recombination. As presented in Fig. 3d, the JSC of the three devices exhibits a linear dependence on light intensity; the α value of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based device is 0.96, higher than the α value of 0.95 observed in the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices, and much higher than the α value of the BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices (0.91). The increased α in BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices compared to BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices suggests their gradually weakened bimolecular recombination, which is also in accord with the changing trend of FF.
To understand why the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices delivered the best photovoltaic performance, their charge transport properties were also investigated. Here, the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al (Fig. S11 and Table S1†). The electron and hole mobilities for the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices were calculated to be 9.2 × 10−5 and 6.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When the IC-Cl-γ end groups were introduced, the electron and hole mobilities of the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices improved to 1.4 × 10−4 and 9.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As expected, the BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices show the poorest electron (2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobilities (1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). All these results demonstrate that the introduction of IC-Cl-γ end groups is very beneficial for increasing carrier mobility and leads to higher FF and Jsc, and finally, for the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices, the best photovoltaic performance.
Morphological characterization
To further investigate the effects of morphology on the photovoltaic performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the morphology of the blend films. From AFM (Fig. 4a–c), it can be seen that all of them show uniform and smooth surfaces, and the PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-γ blend film (0.762 nm) shows a slightly smaller root-mean-square (RMS) value than the PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-δ blend film (1.04 nm) or the PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-β blend film (1.12 nm), which may be due to their different crystallization tendencies. Their different morphologies were further confirmed by TEM. The morphology of PBDB-TF:BTIC-2Cl-γ blend films shows a more evident nanoscale phase separation and aggregated structure, which is favorable for exciton dissociation and charge generation, and therefore leads to slightly higher JSC and FF values.42

The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) method was also applied to investigate the microstructure and molecular packing of the BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β blend films. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, similar GIWAXS patterns and dominant face-on molecular orientation were observed in all these blend films. Compared with BTIC-2Cl-β, the BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ films show more obvious diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction and smaller π–π stacking distances [3.58 Å (BTIC-2Cl-γ), 3.59 Å (BTIC-2Cl-δ), and 3.63 Å (BTIC-2Cl-β)], indicating the stronger crystallinity of the BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ blend films. According to the (100) diffraction peaks (Fig. S12†), the lamellar distances of the BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β blend films were calculated to be 22.86, 21.73, and 20.06 Å, respectively. In the in-plane direction, the larger peak area and higher scattering intensity of the BTIC-2Cl-γ and BTIC-2Cl-δ blend films (Fig. S12†) also confirm their stronger crystallinity. From these results, it can be concluded that the single Cl atom at the different positions of the end groups will affect the π–π stacking distance and crystallinity of the blend films, and different FFs and PCEs for the devices can be achieved.

Energy loss investigation
To further investigate the energy loss (Eloss) of these three isomeric chlorinated devices, EL and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) measurements were also conducted (Fig. 6). Eloss is defined by the following equation:43Eloss = (Egap − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc) = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3
 Fig. 6  FTPS-EQE spectra (a) and EL quantum efficiencies (b) of the three devices. 
ΔE1 is the radiative recombination loss above the band gap, which is unavoidable for any type of solar cell according to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory. All of them show quite similar values of ΔE1 of about 0.27 eV [0.272 eV (BTIC-2Cl-γ), 0.271 eV (BTIC-2Cl-δ), and 0.273 eV (BTIC-2Cl-β)]. ΔE2 is the radiative recombination loss below the band gap and ΔE3 is the nonradiative recombination loss. The optical band gaps (Eg (eV)) of the BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices derived from the EQE spectra are calculated to be 1.51, 1.49, 1.52 eV, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based OSCs exhibit a relatively smaller ΔE3 of 0.234 eV than that those of the BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices (0.246 eV) and BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices (0.247 eV), indicating that IC-Cl-γ end groups on the BT core are an effective means to reduce the nonradiative recombination loss in OSC devices. Furthermore, the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices also show the smallest ΔE2 (0.092 eV) among them. As a result, the smallest Eloss of 0.608 eV was achieved for the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices due to their smaller ΔE2 and ΔE3.

Conclusions
In summary, three isomeric non-fullerene acceptors, BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β, with a single Cl atom in different positions of the end groups were developed for OSCs. The BTIC-2Cl-γ isomer shows a little larger band gap, higher extinction coefficient, and greater crystallinity compared to the BTIC-2Cl-δ isomer, and shows very different absorption and energy levels to those of BTIC-2Cl-β. Also, BTIC-2Cl-γ exhibits higher electron mobility and more homogeneous morphology, which is favorable for the exciton dissociation and charge generation. The BTIC-2Cl-δ molecule exhibited very short π–π distances between one molecule's terminal group and the adjacent molecule's core unit due to the short Cl⋯S, Cl⋯π, and Cl⋯N noncovalent interactions. These noncovalent interactions are very helpful in the formation of a continuous 3D network and lead to high electron mobility. When employing PBDB-TF as the donor material, an outstanding PCE of 15.04% for the BTIC-2Cl-γ-based devices was achieved, accompanied by a high Voc of 0.90 V, a JSC of 23.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.98%, higher than those achieved by the BTIC-2Cl-δ (14.13%) and BTIC-2Cl-β (7.39%)-based devices. These findings indicate that the isomeric effects of chlorination at the end groups afford a powerful strategy to tune the electronic structure and morphology of high-performance non-fullerene electron acceptors, and provide deeper insights into the structure–property relationships of isomeric effects of end groups in non-fullerene acceptor materials.
