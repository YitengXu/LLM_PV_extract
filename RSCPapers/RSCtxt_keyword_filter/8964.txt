    , Accepted 28th February 2013First published on 6th March 2013AbstractA series of liquid junction dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) was fabricated based on polymer membrane-encapsulated dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles, prepared using a surface-induced cross-linking polymerization reaction, to investigate the dependence of the solar cell performance on the encapsulating membrane layer thickness. The ion conductivity decreased as the membrane thickness increased; however, the long term-stability of the devices improved with increasing membrane thickness. Nanoparticles encapsulated in a thick membrane (ca. 37 nm), obtained using a 90 min polymerization time, exhibited excellent pore filling among TiO2 particles. This nanoparticle layer was used to fabricate a thin-layered, quasi-solid state DSC. The thick membrane prevented short-circuit paths from forming between the counter and the TiO2 electrode, thereby reducing the minimum necessary electrode separation distance. The quasi-solid state DSC yielded a high power conversion efficiency (7.6 → 8.1%) and excellent stability during heating at 65 °C over 30 days. These performance characteristics were superior to those obtained from a conventional DSC (7.5 → 3.5%) prepared using a TiO2 active layer with the same thickness. The reduced electrode separation distance shortened the charge transport pathways, which compensated for the reduced ion conductivity in the polymer gel electrolyte. Excellent pore filling on the TiO2 particles minimized the exposure of the dye to the liquid and reduced dye detachment.

Broader context
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Although DSCs have a low production cost, their low PCE and low thermal stability have limited commercial applications. This study describes the preparation of a novel multifunctional polymer gel electrolyte in which a cross-linking polymerization reaction is used to encapsulate TiO2 nanoparticles toward improving the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of a quasi-solid state DSC. The thick polymer membrane-encapsulated TiO2 nanoparticles prevented the development of short-circuit pathways, improved pore filling, reduced dye detachment from the TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces, and improved the photovoltaic performance, providing a very thin, novel quasi-solid state DSC. The thin DSC structure reduced the incidence of short-circuit pathways, thereby compensating for a decrease in the ion conductivity through the thick polymer gel electrolyte. The quasi-solid state DSC prepared using a nanoporous membrane polymer gel electrolyte exhibited a slightly better photovoltaic performance and excellent long-term stability upon heating at 65 °C relative to a DSC prepared based on a liquid electrolyte. This novel electrode encapsulation approach ameliorates some of the factors that limit the long-term stability of DSCs.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are composed of a mesoporous wide band gap oxide sensitized by light-absorbing dyes, a liquid electrolyte, and a redox species.1 Despite the successful demonstration of DSCs, a low thermal stability has limited the commercial applications of DSCs.2 DSC stability can degrade over time due to the irreversible oxidation of the dye, detachment of the dye molecules from the electrode surface in the presence of nucleophiles in water, or the decomposition of the liquid electrolytes containing I−/I3− redox species, which occurs at high temperatures due to an adsorptive equilibrium process.3 Recently, we revealed that the low power conversion efficiencies (PCE, η) of DSCs mainly arose from a gradual drop in the current density (J) over time. The poor stability was, therefore, ascribed to the desorption of dye molecules from the electrode surface at high temperatures. To improve device stability, we previously demonstrated that dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 surface-induced cross-linking polymerization resulted in the encapsulation of the dye-sensitized TiO2 particles (the dashed box in Fig. 1).4 Encapsulation improved the stability and increased the photovoltaic performance in liquid junction DSCs employing volatile electrolytes, such as acetonitrile (AN) or valeronitrile (VN). Additionally, the extended cross-linking polymerization reaction filled the pores between TiO2 particles with the polymer gel.

DSC instabilities arise principally from the volatilization of the supporting solvent5,6 out of the device, especially at high temperatures. Leakage is facilitated by the presence of highly volatile organic solvents, such as AN and VN, in the liquid electrolyte. A partial solution to the liquid electrolyte leakage problem could potentially be found in DSCs employing polymeric gel electrolytes containing a minimal amount of non-volatile solvents, such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC). Polyethylene glycol (PEG),7–9 polyacrylonitrile (PAN),10 polymers based on acrylate or methacrylate,11–13 or polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP)14–16 have been preliminarily tested for their utility as a polymer gel electrolyte into which are incorporated small amounts of a liquid electrolyte. Recently, more advanced polymer gel electrolytes have been tested in which a polymer solution is first gelled using a low molecular mass gelator5,17,18 or nanoparticles.19–21
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of devices prepared using polymer gel electrolytes remain low compared to the corresponding devices prepared using liquid electrolytes,22 mainly because the ion conductivities in polymer gel electrolytes are low. The thickness of a polymer gel electrolyte layer may be reduced to compensate for the lower ion conductivity; however, thin gel electrolyte layers may induce the development of short-circuit pathways between a counter electrode and a TiO2 electrode. The rough surface of a TiO2 electrode can also limit the degree to which the inter-electrode distance may be decreased. Polymer gel electrolytes are generally directly transferred and pressed into the upper TiO2 electrode surface during device fabrication. The inner areas between TiO2 particles may comprise only partially filled liquid junctions, as excellent filling of the pores between TiO2 particles is difficult to achieve due to the large polymer chain size relative to the pore size. This issue was identified independently by Durrant et al., using arylamine oligomers,23 and our group, using small molecular Spiro-OMeTAD.24
We postulated that the development of short-circuit pathways might be prevented and excellent pore filling with the polymer gel might be realized using a thicker polymer gel electrolyte membrane layer formed via a surface-induced cross-linking polymerization reaction that completely encapsulated the dye-sensitized TiO2 particles (indicated by the solid box in Fig. 1). The distance between two electrodes may be controlled by the thickness of the encapsulated polymer electrolyte. Here, we describe the preparation of a novel quasi-solid state DSC using polymer gel electrolyte-encapsulated dye-sensitized TiO2 particles. The gel electrolyte was prepared using a surface-induced cross-linking polymerization reaction. The polymer gel electrolyte was multifunctional in that it prevented the development of short-circuit pathways, improved pore filling, reduced dye detachment (due to the cosensitization effect), and improved photovoltaic performance (due to the encapsulation effect), as demonstrated previously. Before demonstrating this novel encapsulation approach, we sought to understand the effects of the encapsulation layer thickness on ion diffusion, and the effects of inter-electrode distance on the photovoltaic performance and ion conductivity within the liquid electrolyte. Once these relationships were characterized, a novel quasi-solid state DSC was fabricated to provide a proof of concept.
Results and discussion
N719-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films encapsulated by a network polymer film were prepared by first cosensitizing the TiO2 films with N719 and 3-(2-methyl-acryloylamino)propionic acid (MAP). A surface-induced cross-linking polymerization reaction using a solution containing 80:20 mol% methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer and 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) cross-linker in AN was then applied. The encapsulation layer thickness varied according to the reaction time. A maximum reaction time of 90 min yielded the thickest film. Fig. 2 shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of a N719-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film encapsulated by a network polymer film. The image clearly demonstrates the dependence of the film thickness on the cross-linking polymerization time. The network polymer film on the surfaces of the N719-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 particles (20 nm) grew uniformly. The cross-linkers created interconnections within the network polymer layers during polymerization, and these connections became more extensive for longer polymerization times (see Fig. S1† for cross-section SEM images). The void volume between particles, into which liquid electrolyte could flow, was thereby minimized (Fig. 2).

The ion transport properties of the nanoporous network polymer films with a range of thickness values were further investigated in symmetric cells employing TiO2 electrodes encapsulated by the surface-induced polymerization reaction and immobilized on an FTO conducting glass support. A solution containing AN and VN (85:15 v/v), with 0.05 M LiI, 0.6 M BMII, and 0.03 M I2, was introduced between the electrode pairs. The conductivity (σ) was calculated according to eqn (1):25,26 σ = d/(Rb × A)(1)where d is the distance between the two electrodes (42 μm), A is the active area of the device (0.25 cm2), and Rb is the bulk resistance obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectrum measured in this study (Fig. 3).

I3− ions formed upon the addition of I2 to LiI and BMII. The I3− ion size is much larger than the size of I−. The movement of I3− ions may be retarded by the thickness of the nanoporous network polymer layers. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the conductivities as a function of the polymerization time for the nanoporous network polymer layers with 3.0 nm nanopores.4 The conductivity of the polymer film prepared with a 15 min polymerization time (yielding a 4.5 nm layer) was 0.81 mS cm−1, smaller than that (1.20 mS cm−1) obtained without a polymer layer. This result indicated that the nanoporous network polymer layer retarded ion transport. As the thickness of the nanoporous network polymer layer increased, the conductivity decreased slightly to 0.51 mS cm−1 (90 min polymerization time, which yielded a 37 nm layer). This conductivity was less than half that of the neat TiO2 particles.

Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic performances of the optimized series of devices, measured 2 days after fabrication to ensure complete soaking of the electrolyte. The devices prepared using different polymerization times, producing a range of nanoporous network polymer layer thicknesses, yielded a short circuit current density (JSC) of 17.4–15.4 mA cm−2 and open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76–0.78 V, much higher than the values obtained from the control device (JSC = 13.8 mA cm−2 and 0.73 V) prepared from the dye solution alone without a polymer layer (Table 1). These results agreed well with our previous report,4 in which we revealed that the PCE mainly improved due to the prevention of dye aggregation and a reduction in the recombination reaction.4 It is noticed that the polymer layer did not act as an additional light scattering layer (see Fig. S2†). The thickness of the nanoporous network polymer layer also influenced the photovoltaic parameters. As the thickness increased, JSC and FF decreased linearly, which decreased the η. Thicker polymer layers probably hamper the movement of the redox species, as observed in the conductivity measurements; however, the η values (8.0–7.1%) for devices having nanoporous network polymer layers were much higher than the value obtained from a control device (η = 6.8%), suggesting that a quasi-solid state DSC employing a nanoporous network polymer layer could provide a high photovoltaic performance, despite reduced ion conductivity in the polymer gel electrolyte.

The JSC values of devices varied significantly over time upon heating at 65 °C (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). The JSC of the device prepared without a polymer layer on the TiO2 electrode surface was 13.8 mA cm−2 2 days after preparation. This value decreased to 10.9 mA cm−2 after 6 days of heating. Previous independent studies by Grätzel et al.27,28 and us4 have shown that the N719 dyes progressively desorb from the surfaces of the TiO2 electrodes upon extended heating.29,30 The FF values of the devices prepared with a porous network polymer layer increased gradually over the incubation time, and this trend was more pronounced for the devices with thicker membrane layers (e.g., 60 and 90 min in Fig. 5(a)). The control device displayed no such increase in the FF over the incubation time. These results indicated that the heating time was essential for achieving complete soaking of the electrolyte into the porous network polymer membrane layers in this type of device. Surprisingly, the JSC values remained constant over 580 h in the devices prepared with 60 and 90 min polymerization times (Fig. 5(a)). The JSC values of devices prepared using a 30 min polymerization time decreased slightly, probably due to the thinner membrane layer (ca. 18 nm). These results suggested that the thicker nanoporous network polymer layer encapsulating the dye-sensitized TiO2 particles reduced dye detachment. The thicker layer also prevented the development of short-circuit pathways between the two electrodes by introducing a physically stable polymer gel electrolyte.

With these results in hand, we fabricated a quasi-solid state DSC. The polymer membrane layer was sandwiched between a working electrode and a counter electrode, as shown in Fig. 1 (solid box), such that the electrodes were separated by a nanoscale distance. The thicker membrane obtained using a 90 min polymerization time was selected as it yielded minimal cavities between TiO2 particles to minimize the liquid junction areas (see Fig. 2(d)). A sintered TiO2 electrode with a 9 μm thick active layer and a 6 μm thick scattering layer was dipped into a solution containing 0.3 mM N719 dye and 0.3 mM MAP in tert-butanol and AN (1:1 v/v) for 18 h. A monomer solution containing MMA and HDDA (80:20 mol%) was then dropped onto the layer formed by the adsorbed dye and MAP, and the polymerization reaction proceeded at 80 °C for 90 min. The resulting electrode was dipped into an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M I2, 0.4 M tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in a solution containing EC and PC (4:1 v/v) to achieve complete soaking of the electrolyte into the porous network polymer membrane layer. Finally, a Pt counter electrode was laid over the working electrode and pressed to achieve a thin device. EC and PC, which are generally used in quasi-solid state DSCs, were used here in place of the volatile liquid AN.
The quantities of N719 on the electrode prepared from the coadsorption of N719 and MAP were 20% lower than the quantities of N719 adsorbed in the absence of MAP, consistent with our previous results,29–31 as shown in Fig. 6(a). The dye content remained almost unchanged upon formation of the cross-linked polymer network film, even after washing with excess AN. The thermally activated cross-linking polymerization process did not disrupt the N719 adsorbed to the TiO2 electrode, judging from the shapes of the UV-Vis absorption spectra.31

Fig. 6(b) shows the preliminary results for the photovoltaic performances of quasi-solid state DSCs prepared with a nanoporous network polymer layer electrolyte. The η of the quasi-solid state DSC was 7.6%, better than that obtained from a liquid junction control device (η = 7.5%) prepared from the dye solution alone. The excellent photovoltaic performance of the quasi-solid state DSC probably arose from the thinner device geometry (see Fig. S3† for impedance analysis) (Table 2).

We further investigated the effects of the distance between the two electrodes on the ion movement in the liquid electrolyte. Apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) were measured in symmetric cells as a function of the cell thickness (determined by the distance between the electrodes) as summarized in Table 3. As the cell thickness increased, the Dapp decreased linearly. This result demonstrated that a thinner DSC provided a better photovoltaic performance.

Long-term stabilities of devices were estimated as a function of heating time (at 65 °C). The JSC of the device (control) prepared without a polymer layer on the TiO2 electrode surface was 17.0 mA cm−2 after 1 day of heating, and this value decreased to 9.1 mA cm−2 after 30 days of heating. On the other hand, the JSC values for the quasi-solid state DSC remained nearly constant after heating for 30 days (Fig. 6(b)). These results indicated that the thick nanoporous network polymer layer encapsulated and stabilized the dye-sensitized TiO2 particles, acted as an excellent polymer gel electrolyte, prevented the development of short-circuit pathways between the two electrodes (see Fig. S4†), and permitted realization of a very thin device.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the thickness of a multifunctional polymer membrane applied to encapsulate the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 particles affected the ion conductivity and photovoltaic performance of a solar cell. Although the ion conductivity in the nanoporous membranes infused with the liquid electrolyte decreased slightly, the resulting quasi-solid state DSC exhibited a slight improvement in the photovoltaic performance with excellent long-term stability at high temperatures relative to a DSC prepared using the liquid electrolyte only. The improved performance appeared to result mainly from the enabled preparation of a thin device, the excellent pore filling, and the cosensitization and encapsulation effects. This novel concept offers a solution to the long-term stability problems associated with the use of liquid electrolytes, which have previously limited the practical application of DSCs.

Broader context
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Although DSCs have a low production cost, their low PCE and low thermal stability have limited commercial applications. This study describes the preparation of a novel multifunctional polymer gel electrolyte in which a cross-linking polymerization reaction is used to encapsulate TiO2 nanoparticles toward improving the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of a quasi-solid state DSC. The thick polymer membrane-encapsulated TiO2 nanoparticles prevented the development of short-circuit pathways, improved pore filling, reduced dye detachment from the TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces, and improved the photovoltaic performance, providing a very thin, novel quasi-solid state DSC. The thin DSC structure reduced the incidence of short-circuit pathways, thereby compensating for a decrease in the ion conductivity through the thick polymer gel electrolyte. The quasi-solid state DSC prepared using a nanoporous membrane polymer gel electrolyte exhibited a slightly better photovoltaic performance and excellent long-term stability upon heating at 65 °C relative to a DSC prepared based on a liquid electrolyte. This novel electrode encapsulation approach ameliorates some of the factors that limit the long-term stability of DSCs.
