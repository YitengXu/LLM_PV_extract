    , Accepted 1st February 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractA low-temperature carbon electrode with good perovskite compatibility is employed in hole-transport-material free perovskite solar cells, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.7% is obtained. The PCE is enhanced to 14.55% by an interface modification of PEDOT:PSS. The application of this carbon on ITO/PEN substrates is also demonstrated.
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have become a burgeoning generation of photovoltaic materials due to their remarkable performance by virtue of an adjustable band gap, high absorption coefficient, long electron hole diffusion length, low exciton binding energy and solution-based preparation processes.1–4 The high efficiency and low cost of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have come to the attention of more and more scholars, which leads to a paradigmatic shift in photovoltaic technology. Going forward at an unprecedented rate, their small laboratory devices have risen to a conspicuous PCE value of 23.7% from an initial 3.8%,5,6 which is unparalleled for a new type of solar cell, exhibiting a comparable performance to traditional commercial solar cells. However, expensive operationally unstable organic hole transport materials (HTMs) are required to realize high efficiency solar cells, which are usually susceptible to migration of halide ions and metal ions,7–9 resulting in degradation and increased costs of conversion, hampering the industrialization of solar cells to a large extent.
Because the perovskite light harvester could also serve as a hole transporter,10,11 the hole transport layer can be omitted in some device structures. Carbon electrode materials are considered as the most promising competitor to replace metal electrodes due to their low cost, high stability and hydrophobic nature.12–15 Excellent stability and efficiency has been reported from the initial 6.6% to over 15% for carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs),12–16 making them among the most promising solar cells for commercialization although with an incontestable gap in efficiency compared with traditional PSCs. A commercial carbon paste was first used for paintable C-PSCs by Zhang et al.17 The researchers achieved a PCE of 8.3% through a systematic optimization of the TiO2 thickness. Soon after, Ma et al. achieved a PCE of 8–9% with a commercial carbon paint based on optimized spin-coated MAPbI3.18 Wong used toluene to increase adhesion between perovskite and freestanding carbon nanotube (CNT) films and got a PCE of 9.9% despite a high sheet resistance of the CNT films leading to an unsatisfactory fill factor.19 Yang et al. developed different carbon materials, including candle soot, single-layered and multi-layered graphene, as hole extractors and obtained a PCE of 11%.20,21 But the existence of hazardous and toxic solvents usually limits the application of carbon pastes. Wei et al. fabricated a freestanding and flexible carbon paint to be pressed onto perovskites and obtained a PCE of 13.5%.22 Nevertheless, the poor interface contact between perovskite and carbon electrode still remains a major problem with low efficiency C-based HTM-free PSCs.
In a previous work, we developed a neoteric low-temperature carbon paste with high electrical conductivity. By applying the paste as an additional layer in the printable triple mesoscopic layer perovskite solar cells developed by the Han group,16,23,24 a power conversion efficiency of 14.04% was obtained.25 The interface contact between the perovskite and the low-temperature carbon electrode was improved through the high-temperature sintered carbon scaffold. Considering simplified fabrication processes and avoiding high temperatures, herein we applied this low-temperature carbon paste in paintable C-PSCs. Taking advantage of the good perovskite compatibility and excellent electrical conductivity of this carbon paste, we obtained an initially favourable average 10–10.5% PCE (champion 11.7%). By inserting a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer between the perovskite and the carbon electrodes, we meliorated the contact with the carbon electrodes, resulting in a more efficient hole injection and delivering an average 13.6% PCE (champion 14.55%). Furthermore, the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis of HTM-free low-temperature carbon-based PSCs on adding a thin PEDOT:PSS layer decreased apparently. Moreover, we further employed this carbon paste into flexible devices based on ITO/PEN substrates with high mechanical strength, which obtained an average 7.0% PCE (champion 8.5%).
Chlorobenzene and toluene are usually used in carbon pastes but their toxicity remains a problem.19–21 In this carbon paste, a mixture of titanium(IV)isopropoxide (TTIP), acetic acid (HAc) and terpineol (Terp) is used as a multi-component solvent, which is environmentally friendly. We first checked the compatibility of the solvents on perovskite. As shown in Fig. 1a, the solvents used in the carbon paste are evenly and statically aged after 12 hours of stirring. 2 ml of the aging mixture solvents are dropped on the surface of perovskite film for 1 minute, 2 minutes and 5 minutes respectively. The films are then rinsed with large amounts of chlorobenzene (CB) and annealed at 100 °C for another 20 minutes to evaporate the CB absolutely. Fig. 1b shows the UV-vis spectrum of the perovskite film without treatment and with treatment with multi-component solvents for one minute, two minutes and five minutes. The absorption spectra remained the same, indicating no obvious detriment to perovskite films with the treatment for a short time. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the perovskite film would be damaged with apparent cracks to some extent when the multi-component solvents are kept on the surface of perovskite films for more than 20 minutes. However, the time window is enough for us to complete the device fabrication. The TRPL decay of the perovskite film without treatment and with treatment is characterized in Fig. 1c. Consistent with the former examination, the TRPL decay shows a slight difference before and after treatment with multi-component solvents. The lifetime results of perovskite film and perovskite film after treatment with multi-component solvents are described in Table S1 (ESI†). We examined three points in every sample and found no evident difference in lifetime. Fig. S1a–d (ESI†) demonstrates the surface SEM image of the perovskite film before (a and c) and after (b and d) treatment with multi-component solvents. Although the image of the perovskite film is relatively fuzzy after the treatment with the multi-component solvent compared with the image before the treatment due to the difference in the electrical conductivity of the film surface, the crystal composition of the perovskite film is not damaged by the multi-component solvents. As a result, we believe that the multi-component solvents in the carbon paste has a negligible effect on the perovskite in the actual preparation of devices. The ability of this low temperature carbon to extract holes is characterized from Fig. S2 (ESI†), indicating that the carbon film could extract holes effectively.

Fig. 2a exhibits the schematic diagram of HTM-free C-PSCs which consisted of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/C layers. The cross-section SEM diagram based on low temperature C-PSCs shows that the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer is about 350–450 nm, and the thickness of the perovskite coating layer on the mesoporous TiO2 layer is about 300–400 nm in Fig. 2b. As we can see from Fig. 2c, based on the energy band diagram of the C-PSCs, photo-induced electrons in the perovskite are transmitted to the conduction band of TiO2. Meanwhile, the low-temperature carbon electrode with an appropriate work function (WF) is liable to facilitate the collection of photo-generated holes in the perovskite layer. The J–V characteristics at reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) of the typical C-PSC device under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) conditions are shown in Fig. 2d, and we achieve an average 10.6% PCE (champion 11.7%). The performance parameters of the champion device are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Severe hysteresis is observed, attributed to the poor contact between perovskite and carbon electrodes, which is proved in Fig. 2b. The manufacturing process of screen-painting carbon can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

As a cheap, dopant-free and air-stable alternative to expensive spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS has been used as the hole extraction material in order to facilitate the extraction of charge carriers at the interface between the transparent conductive oxide and the active perovskite layer in inverted PSCs. In addition, inverted PSCs using PEDOT:PSS typically show lower hysteresis than standard architecture PSCs. Unfortunately, PEDOT:PSS is usually dispersed in water thus limiting its application in PSCs with formal structures. In this work, we successfully inserted a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS by spin-coating a toluene based PEDOT:PSS dispersion on the top of the perovskite layer. Fig. 3a shows the fabrication procedure of a PSC consisting of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/PEDOT:PSS/C. The cross-sectional SEM image of a low temperature carbon electrode based PSC is shown in Fig. 3b. Notably, it is challenging for PEDOT:PSS (WF = ∼4.8 eV) and carbon (WF = 4.8–5.0 eV) to achieve aligned energy levels, as shown in Fig. 3c. Thus, the enhanced performance might mainly come from the more intimate contact between the perovskite and carbon which facilitates the collection of photo-generated holes of the perovskite layer. The J–V characteristics at RS and FS of the device are shown in Fig. 3d. An average 13.6% PCE (champion 14.55%) is obtained. A high FF of 0.72 is achieved, which is significantly higher than the values reported in the literature.26 The J–V hysteresis becomes less distinct when a PEDOT:PSS layer is inserted. We calculated the J–V hysteresis index as defined by the following equation: Hysteresis index = (JRS(0.8VOC) − JFS(0.8VOC))/(JRS(0.8VOC))(1)where JRS(0.8VOC) and JFS(0.8VOC) represent a photocurrent density at 80% of VOC for the RS and FS, respectively.27 The low-temperature carbon based PSC with an added PEDOT:PSS layer shows a smaller hysteresis index of 0.069 compared with the hysteresis index of 0.248 without adding a PEDOT:PSS layer, which indicates that the sufficient hole extraction and transportation on adding a PEDOT:PSS layer could considerably hinder the negative ionic charge accumulation at the perovskite/charge contact interfaces, hence ultimately resulting in a higher PCE and negligible J–V hysteresis. As we can see from Fig. S3 (ESI†), the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of perovskite film, perovskite/C, perovskite/PEDOT:PSS and perovskite/PEDOT:PSS/C to reveal the changes in charge carrier injection are expressed to further investigate the reasons for the enhancement in the photovoltaic performance. Table S4 (ESI†) shows lifetime results for perovskite film, perovskite/C, perovskite/PEDOT:PSS and perovskite/PEDOT:PSS/C, depending on the carrier decay function I = Ae−(t−to)/τ1 + Be−(t−to)/τ2, where I represents the PL intensity at time t, A and B are constants, τ1 is the faster component of the exciton spontaneous radiative recombination time, and τ2 is the slower component of the pure dephasing time of nonradiative recombination, such as the phonon scattering and Auger recombination losses.28 It is noticeable that the τ1 value decreases from 4.38 ns for perovskite/C to 3.52 ns for perovskite/PEDOT:PSS/C, which is remarkable compared with the τ1 value of 7.88 ns for perovskite film. The reduced τ1 value arises from the improved charge extraction ability from the perovskite film, a shorter PL lifetime suggests an increased hole extraction from the perovskite which is in agreement with the dependence of PCE. All of these characterizations verify that promoted hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface significantly reduces charge recombination and therefore generates photovoltaic performance enhancement, a thin PEDOT:PSS of about 85 nm is just like a more compact dust to contact with carbon better, as seen in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and integrated current density are measured as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The box diagrams of VOC (a), JSC (b), and FF (c) as the parameters of device performance, and (d) the histogram bar graph and normal distribution of PCE for 40 perovskite solar cells can also be seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

As shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the low-temperature carbon film printed on the flexible substrate of PET was annealed at 70 °C for 1 h, and twisted to perform a bending test in different angles. As we can see from the picture, there are no obvious cracks on the surface of the carbon film. The mixed functional additives (TTIP + HAc) in terpineol used in the low-temperature carbon paste could produce chemical reactions to form a binder, so as to increase the mechanical strength. The square resistance selected from the four groups of samples was tested before and after bending 100 times. As shown in Fig. 4b, there is no significant change in the square resistance before and after bending 100 times, which further confirms the high flexibility with a low film robustness, making it difficult to achieve high conductivity, as well as to minimize the series resistance losses. The surface SEM characterization of the low temperature carbon film was performed to study the influence of the presence of mixed functional additives. We find that the connection between carbon materials is very close and the film has a high roughness in Fig. S6b (ESI†), and we propose that the rough film could improve the contact with the perovskite layer. There are many obvious cracks on the carbon film without additive groups based on the SEM surface morphology in Fig. S6a (ESI†), and the surface of the film is so smooth that it may contact well with perovskite. The carbon paste was further used in flexible devices. Fig. 4c shows the schematic diagram of flexible C-PSCs. The PEN/ITO/mesoscopic SnO2/perovskite/PEDOT:PSS/C device displays a PCE of 7.04%, JSC of 18.50 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.84 V, and FF of 0.45 in Fig. 4d. The analysis of the device durability against repeated bending at various bending radii shows that the PCE decreases to 70% of its initial value after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 4 mm, due to the poor mechanical robustness of ITO.

In summary, we have successfully engineered HTM-free low-temperature C-based PSCs employing excellent carbon pastes with good perovskite compatibility and excellent electrical conductivity. A facile interface modification method by depositing a PEDOT:PSS solution of toluene dispersion on the perovskite layer was the first reported to meliorate the contact with carbon electrodes, which enhanced the PCE and reduced the J–V hysteresis. Moreover, we further employed this carbon paste in flexible devices based on ITO\PEN substrates with high mechanical strength. These results have established our carbon paste as a versatile and controllable route toward low-cost and large scale manufacturing of PSCs.
