    , Accepted 18th July 2021First published on 19th July 2021AbstractBuilding-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) system is one of the potential emerging technologies in this decade due to not only its promises on harvesting solar energy to mitigate the power required in buildings but also its capability of offering vast aesthetics to buildings. Compared to various kinds of solar cells, cost-effective polymer solar cells (PSCs) are preferable candidates to serve the purposes of BIPVs effectively. In this work, we have demonstrated an efficient PSC based on a blend of donor polymer, PM6, and non-fullerene acceptor, Y6, as an active layer and a metal-dielectric-metal electrode. The proposed PSC exhibits color tunability (blue, green, and red) straightforwardly through variation in the thickness (75 nm, 95 nm, and 125 nm, respectively) of the dielectric layer consisting of organic molecules, 1,4,5,8,9,11-Hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) sandwiched between 30 nm thick silver (Ag) metal or copper (Cu)–Ag or aluminum (Al)–Ag metal alloys. The optimized PSCs with blue, green, and red aesthetics exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 13.62%, 13.30%, and 13.43%, which is comparable to that (13.77%) of the reference PSC fabricated with 100 nm thick Al:Ag electrode. The outstanding device performance of the proposed PSCs, i.e., the ability to provide desired aesthetics without compromising PCEs of the devices has been thoroughly investigated by physical and electrical characterization. The results show a cost-effective route to fabricate an efficient colorful BIPV for successful commercialization.
1. Introduction
The rapid technological progress in the millennial era has increased the demand for electrical power undoubtedly. The electricity demand is estimated to increase by 28% in the next 30 years.1 Given the limitations of raw materials related to natural resources, renewable energy sources are feasible solutions to mitigate the recent surge in energy demand. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) system is an attractive renewable energy source that may reduce on-grid electrical consumption in the residential and commercial buildings. Generally, a BIPV system is designed for the roof or façade of a building. State-of-the-art BIPV systems are not only used for the roof, urban furniture, and façade but also as foil, tile, module, and solar cell glazing, which have been developed and commercialized recently.2,3 However, the key element for successful commercialization of BIPV is not only to reduce the electrical consumption per se but also to consider the aesthetics after integrating PV into buildings. This is boldly justified in the report by Soman et al., where they stated that 17% of PV customers were unsatisfied with their PV installation due to the aesthetic deterioration.4 In general, the limitation in aesthetics lies in the monopoly PV market of silicon offering only blue or black color. Therefore, the selection of proper semiconductor materials to achieve desired aesthetics is of paramount importance in BIPV studies.
Recently, polymer solar cell (PSC) has gained tremendous research interest due to improvements in its efficiency by leaps and bounds.5–8 Besides, PSC is fabricated by low-cost processes and is suitable for roll-to-roll fabrication.9–11 More importantly, the bandgap of PSCs could be adjusted straightforwardly by modifying the active layer, resulting in the ability to tune the colors sequentially. For example, Cui et al. tuned the bandgap of PSC using J52, PBDB-T, and PTB7-Th as polymer donors to achieve PSCs with purple, blue, and cyan, respectively.12 In another case, Yang et al. explored IDPSQ, SQ-BP, D-BDT-SQ and AzUSQ as small-molecule donors to fabricate purple, blue, green, and dark green colored PSCs with the efficiency of 2.96%, 4.36%, 4.91%, and 1.71%, respectively.13 It is obvious that the efficiencies of PSCs fabricated to exhibit different colors following the above-mentioned concept vary a lot. Therefore, the variation in active material is undesirable to achieve uniform high efficiency for each color.
Several optical manipulation techniques have been integrated into solar cells externally to achieve colorful PVs, recently. Selj et al. utilized silicon mononitride (SiN) as an anti-reflection coating to realize colorful solar cells.14 Photonic crystals have been applied to fabricate colorful solar cells by exploiting materials with low and high refractive indexes.15 Plasmonic resonance can be used to make colorful solar cells by designing the Ag nanostrip16 and the natural-colored object by implementing multilayer dielectric.17 Fabrication of colorful PSCs compared to the above techniques is comparatively simple and effective except for the drawback of variation in cell efficiency with different colors. This limitation is overcome by introducing the Fabry–Perot (FP) electrode in the PSC, where the color variation is created by the cavity effect in the electrode, ruling out the requirement to modify the active material.18 FP electrode structure is conceived by sandwiching a dielectric material in between two metal layers. The metals act as reflectors while the dielectric layer acts as the spacer between two metals. Therefore, constructive or destructive optical interference for a specific wavelength of the light could be formed by varying the thickness of the dielectric materials and consequently, the transmitted or reflected wavelengths could be tuned. In other words, the FP electrode could function as an optical filter, suggesting the feasibility to achieve a colorful electrode. However, ultrathin Ag deposited by the thermal evaporation process forms island-like film.19,20 Therefore, the rough surface morphology affects the transmittance and sheet resistance of the electrode.21 To get rid of this issue towards the improvement in the efficiency of colorful PSC, Xu et al. and Zhong et al. designed Au seeds for the Ag layer to achieve a smooth surface and successfully improved the efficiency of colorful PSC.21,22 Furthermore, Xue et al. introduced bisfulleropyrrolidinium tris(methoxyethoxy)phenyl iodide (Bis-FIMG) as the seed layer in colorful PSC, resulting in a smooth roughness and reduction of sheet resistance.23 In these cases, the metal reflector plays a crucial role to retain the device performance of colorful PSCs without losing efficiency. Various studies on transmissive colorful solar cells with metal cavities are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).24–35
In this work, we fabricated aesthetic highly colorful BIPVs based on PSCs with Fabry–Perot electrodes. Three different metals or metal alloys, i.e., silver (Ag), metal alloys of copper (Cu)–Ag and aluminum (Al)–Ag were studied to realize efficient BIPVs. As the spacer, we used 1,4,5,8,9,11-Hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) possessing good thermal stability in colorful PSC.36 The blue, green, and red electrodes were obtained by adjusting the HAT-CN thickness to 75, 95, and 125 nm, respectively, while the thickness of the metal reflectors was fixed at 30 nm. As a consequence, blue, green, and red colored PSCs with Ag-based FP electrodes achieved PCEs of 12.86%, 12.95% and 12.79%, respectively. PSCs of the Cu:Ag-based electrode were also similar PCEs (12.56%, 13.17%, 12.76% for blue, green and red, respectively) with a little lower open-circuit voltage (Voc). On the other hand, Al:Ag-based colorful PSC achieved higher efficiency (13.62%, 13.30%, 13.43% for blue, green, and red, respectively) than Cu:Ag-based colored PSCs due to favorable built-in potential even though both metal electrodes show almost similar roughness and transmittance. The study reveals that the metal reflector of the FP structure affects the performance of colorful PSC strongly, which has been addressed carefully by investigating the surface roughness and optical transmittance of the metal film along with the band structure of the devices.
2. Experiment
2.1. Materials
Chemicals such as silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), zinc acetate di-hydrate, ethanolamine, 2-methoxyethanol, ethanolamine, chloronaphthalene were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, HAT-CN from Shine materials, PBDB-T-2F (PM6) and Y6 (BTP-4F) from 1-materials. Indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1 was purchased from Lumtec Corporation.
2.2. Device fabrication
The patterned ITO on the glass substrate was cleaned with DI (deionized) water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonicator and dried with nitrogen flow. The substrate was then treated with UV-Ozone for 20 minutes to enhance the surface potential. The ZnO solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of zinc acetate into 10 ml 2-methoxy ethanol and 280 μl ethanolamine and was stirred overnight. ZnO solution was then coated on top of ITO at 5000 rpm and annealed at 200 °C for 15 minutes. The PM6:Y6 was dissolved in chloroform with 0.5% chloronaphthalene with a concentration of 17.5 mg ml−1 and a 1:1.2 ratio of PM6:Y6. The ZnO-coated substrate was transferred to the glove box and was coated with PM6:Y6 at 6000 rpm and annealed at 110 °C for 10 minutes. The samples were then moved to the evaporation chamber for depositing MoO3, HAT-CN, Ag, Al, Al:Ag, Cu:Ag at a fixed deposition rate of 0.3, 3, 5, 0.06:3, 0.06:3 Å s−1, respectively. 100 nm thick metals were deposited as electrodes for the opaque PSC devices, while 30 nm thick top and bottom metal reflectors with 75, 95 and 125 nm thick HAT-CN layers as spacers were deposited as FP electrodes for the blue, green and red colorful PSC devices, respectively.
2.3. Measurement analysis
The current density–voltage (J–V) plot of the devices was obtained using the Enlitech solar simulator (SS-X100R) using 0.02 cm2 shadow mask and calibrated with a silicon cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using the Enlitech QE system (QE-R3011). The sheet resistance of the metal electrodes was measured by a 4-point probe measurement system from Quatek (5601-Y) and converted to metal conductivity. Ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectra were measured using a UV-visible spectrometer, Jasco (V-700). Morphology of the thin metal films was observed using an atomic force microscope (AFM) from Bruker (Innova).
3. Results and discussion
To fabricate colorful PSCs with high efficiency, the Fabry–Perot electrode (metal/dielectric/metal) was introduced in the conventional inverted PV structure as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The structure of the proposed PSCs is as follows – ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, 80 nm)/MoO3 (7 nm)/metal/HAT-CN/metal electrode. The corresponding band diagrams of the devices are presented in Fig. 1(b). The color of PSCs follows the color of the FP electrode, as displayed in Fig. 1(c). Note that the photograph was taken by projecting one sunlight from the solar simulator to the cell placed on a white paper and capturing the image at a certain angle to obtain both reflected and transmitted images simultaneously. Even though the active layer has its intrinsic blue color, the colorful PSCs exhibit different colors tuned by the cavity length (by varying the thickness of the HAT-CN layer) in the electrode as shown in Fig. 1(d). In other words, the color of the electrodes dominates the intrinsic blue color of the active layer in PSCs. Four PSCs were fabricated with different thicknesses of the HAT-CN layer showing opaque (0 nm HAT-CN), blue (75 nm of HAT-CN), green (95 nm of HATC-CN), and red (125 nm of HAT-CN) colored devices. To achieve highly efficient colored PSCs, we fabricated devices with four different metals such as Ag, Al, Cu: Ag (Cu- doped Ag), and Al:Ag (Al-doped Ag) in the top electrode and investigated the performance of the devices.

A 100 nm metal electrode instead of an FP electrode was deposited on the active layer to fabricate four opaque PSC devices based on Ag, Al, Cu:Ag, and Al:Ag. The PSC with Ag electrode achieves a PCE of 15% that is comparable to that of a PSC with a similar structure reported previously.37–41Fig. 2(a) shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of all four opaque PSCs and the extracted cell parameters are furnished in Table 1 for clarity. It is obvious that the device performance of PSCs with different metal electrodes varies significantly. The PSC with Al electrode shows the lowest PCE compared to others. The Jsc of PSCs with Ag, Al, Cu:Ag or Al:Ag electrodes are 26.71, 25.72, 25.48, and 25.89 mA cm−2, respectively. A similar trend in EQE values for different metal electrodes is observed as shown in Fig. 2(b). The findings indicate that the application of different metals as top electrodes affects the absorption or charge extraction of the device, resulting in differences in device performance. Furthermore, PSCs with Ag, Al, Cu:Ag, Al:Ag-based electrodes achieve the fill factor of 69.33%, 57.01%, 67.27%, 67.00%, respectively. The low value of fill factor suggests poor charge transfer from the active layer to the electrode. The higher conductivity or lower sheet resistance may reduce the series resistance of the device and improve the fill factor of the device, which reflects the charge collection efficiency.42–44 To shed light on this fact, we measured the sheet resistance of the metal electrodes as presented in Fig. 3. It is obvious from Fig. 3(a) that sheet resistance (1.5 Ω □−1) of the Al electrode is higher than that (∼ 0.3 Ω □−1) of other electrodes. Interestingly, the conductivity data (Fig. 3(b)) of the metal electrodes follows a similar trend in the fill factor of the PSCs with different metal electrodes. In addition, PSCs with Ag, Al, Cu:Ag, Al:Ag electrodes exhibit Voc of 0.81, 0.74, 0.77, 0.79 V, respectively. The variation in Voc values should originate from the variation in built-in voltages contributed from the variation in the work function of the different metals and the band bending at the interface.45,46

For a systematic investigation on the development of efficient colorful PSCs, we fabricated blue, green, and red colored PSCs based on the FP electrode with aforementioned different metals (Ag, Cu:Ag, Al:Ag) and compared the device performance with opaque PSCs constituting of 100 nm respective metal (Ag, Al, Cu:Ag, Al:Ag) electrodes. Therefore, an opaque PSC with 100 nm Ag metal electrode was considered as a reference PSC and three colorful (blue, green, and red) PSCs with an FP electrode (Ag/HAT-CN/Ag) were studied initially. The J-V characteristics and EQE data of these devices are plotted in Fig. 4 and the extracted cell parameters are presented in Table 2. The reference, blue, green, and red PSCs exhibit PCEs of 15.04%, 12.86%, 12.95%, 12.79%, respectively. The result is comparable with our previous work.36Jsc of the colorful devices (24.35, 24.75, and 24.53 mA cm−2 for blue, green, and red, respectively) is lower compared to that (26.71 mA cm−2) of the reference (Fig. 4(a)), which is reasonable because colorful devices pass a specific wavelength to achieve a certain color as corroborated by the transmittance spectrum of the colorful electrode displayed in Fig. 4(b). The blue, green, and red PSCs show transmission peaks at the wavelength of 475 nm, 535 nm, and 650 nm, respectively, as expected. The fill factor of the colorful devices also gets lower, which could be attributed to the poor charge transfer in the metal–dielectric–metal (MDM) structure of the FP electrode. Moreover, the Voc of colorful devices is also lower than that of the reference device, suggesting lower built-in voltage formation at the colorful electrodes. Most interestingly, the PCE, Jsc, Voc of all three colorful PSCs (blue, green, and red) are comparable to each other, which justifies the application of FP electrodes in BIPV without sacrificing the device performances for different colored aesthetics.

Next, the Cu:Ag metal alloy was used as the metal reflector in the MDM structure. The J–V characteristics and the EQE data of the reference (100 nm Cu:Ag electrode) and the colorful PSCs (Cu:Ag in the MDM structure) are presented in Fig. 5. It is worthwhile to note that the difference in the J–V plot between the reference and colorful PSC gets smaller for the devices with Cu:Ag-based electrodes (Fig. 5(a)) compared to the Ag-based one (Fig. 4(a)). The cell parameters extracted from Fig. 5(a) are presented in Table 3. The reference, blue, green, and red PSCs achieve Jsc of 25.48, 24.89, 24.54, 24.93 mA cm−2, respectively. It is obvious that Jsc values of colorful devices are close to those of the reference device although the EQE of the colorful device shows a dip at the specific wavelengths as displayed in Fig. 5(b). The dips in the EQE curve correspond to the transmission peak of the MDM electrode. Thus, it proves that the electrode still passes a wavelength in order to achieve colorful PSC. However, the transmittance of the colorful electrode is smaller than the Ag-based colorful PSC. This could be the reason for the less difference in Jsc values between the reference and colorful PSC with Cu:Ag-based electrodes. Lesser transmissivity, i.e., the higher reflectivity of the electrode may cause re-absorption of the photon in the active layer, resulting in an increase of Jsc values. The fill factor of the reference, blue, green, and red PSCs are 67.27%, 64.85%, 68.61%, 66.19%, respectively. Note that the values of fill factors of colorful PSCs are similar to those of the reference PSC, suggesting the effective charge transfer in the colorful device even with MDM electrode structure. Interestingly, the Voc of all devices shows a similar value, indicating no loss in built-in voltage at the interface of the metal alloy electrodes in the MDM structure. Overall, the PCE of all devices also follows a similar trend. The reference, blue, green, and red devices exhibit the PCEs of 13.22%, 12.56%, 13.17%, and 12.76%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the PCE of the colorful devices reaches almost equal to that of the reference device.

Finally, another four devices say reference, blue, green, and red PSCs were fabricated with Al:Ag metal alloy as the metal reflector in the MDM structure. The J-V characteristics of all devices are portrayed in Fig. 6(a). Note that all devices show almost no significant difference in the J-V plot. All the cell parameters extracted from Fig. 6(a) are furnished in Table 4. The Jsc of the Al:Ag-based reference, blue, green, and red devices are 25.89, 25.27, 25.54, 25.28 mA cm−2, respectively. The Jsc values of the devices did not vary significantly as expected from the current density plot. Interestingly, the Jsc values of the colorful PSCs with Al:Ag-based electrodes are even higher than those of the Ag-based colorful PSCs. Although Jsc increases in the Al:Ag-based colorful PSC, the dip in the EQE spectrum corresponding to the transmission peak of the respective electrodes still exists as shown in Fig. 6(b). The transmittance of the Al:Ag-based electrodes is increased compared to that of the Cu:Ag-based electrodes. The reference, blue, green, and red devices achieve the fill factor of 67.00%, 67.93%, 65.88%, 66.82%, respectively, indicating better charge transportation in the Al:Ag metal alloy system compared to the Ag-based PSC. The Voc of the devices also reaches 0.79 V,

which is equal to that of the Ag-based colorful PSC suggesting better built-in voltage formation in the Al:Ag metal alloy system. Above all, the reference, blue, green, and red PSCs with Al:Ag-based electrodes show PCEs of 13.77%, 13.62%, 13.30%, and 13.43%, respectively. Surprisingly, the colorful PSCs with Al:Ag-based electrodes outperform the colorful PSCs with Ag-based electrodes. In addition, colorful PSCs with Al:Ag-based MDM structures show uniform PCE irrespective of the color of the devices. This result strongly suggests the efficacy of the MDM structure in the fabrication of efficient photovoltaic for successful aesthetic applications.
To investigate the effect of different metals and metal alloys in the performance of the colorful PSCs, we studied the optical characteristics of the thin metal film (30 nm thickness) used on the MDM structure. The Ag thin film shows higher transmittance in the visible range (Fig. 7(a)) compared to the metal alloy thin films (Cu:Ag and Al:Ag) justifying the higher transmittance of the Ag-based colorful electrode. However, the low reflectance of the Ag thin film (Fig. 7(b)) is responsible for the lower current density of Ag-based colorful devices compared to the opaque (reference, 100 nm Ag film) device. The low reflectance of the top electrode leads to higher photon loss in the device eliminating the possibility of re-absorption of the photons in the active layer and thus reduces the capability of harvesting light.47–49 Unlike the Ag thin film, both metal alloy thin films (Cu:Ag and Al:Ag) show a comparatively lower transmittance in the visible range (Fig. 7(a)). Consequently, both metal alloy thin films exhibit higher reflectance compared to the thin film Ag (Fig. 7(b)), increasing the possibility of photon re-absorption by the active layer, which results in the increase in Jsc of the corresponding devices.

To clarify the optical behavior as well as the details in charge transfer, the surface morphology of the metal thin films was explored by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughnesses of Ag, Cu:Ag, and Al:Ag metal films are 8.14, 1.65, 2.86 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. The Ag film shows the highest RMS roughness compared to the other films. Rough film morphology makes poor contact with the upper layer, which may affect the charge transport in the device. As a consequence, the Ag-based colorful device achieves a lower fill factor compared to the Ag-based reference sample as the thin Ag film forms islands.50 Irrespective of seed-layers (MoO3 or HAT-CN), the metal alloy electrode still achieves the smooth surface roughness as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The sheet resistance of Al:Ag metal alloy increases slowly with the thickness of the layer and increases abruptly after the thickness of 30 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). On the other hand, the surface morphology of the Al:Ag film with the thickness of 10 nm is comparable to that of the film with the thickness of 100 nm, as revealed by the RMS surface roughness in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Besides the poor contact, the surface roughness may affect the transmittance of the film. The comparatively smoother surface of metal alloy films may achieve higher reflectance and lower transmittance enhancing the possibility of photon re-absorption in the active layer.

However, the efficiency of a solar cell is strongly related to its transparency. Solar cells with a highly reflective electrode may achieve high performance at the expense of their transparency.51
Further optical analysis of the colorful electrode was performed to realize aesthetical features of the colorful PSC (Table 5). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transmission peaks from Ag-based blue, green, and red colorful electrodes were 72.20, 59.47, 51.36 nm, respectively. The Cu:Ag-based colorful electrode also showed almost similar color purity. However, the Al:Ag-based blue, green, red colorful electrode exhibited FWHM of 54.23, 43.93, 39.38 nm, respectively, which is significantly lower than that of the Ag-based and Cu:Ag-based colorful electrode. It is well-known that the reflectivity of a metal film is related to its surface roughness, i.e., a flat alloy can improve the specular reflectance of the FP electrode, which can reduce the FWHM of the transmission spectrum.52,53 Therefore, we can conclude that the Al:Ag-based colorful electrode offers better color purity than the colorful electrodes based on other metals or metal alloy electrodes by pushing the CIE colorimetric value closer to the pure color region or the edge of the CIE colorimetric diagram as indicated in Fig. 9. Notably, the blue and red electrodes become purer in the Al:Ag-based structure while the Ag and Cu:Ag-based structures show similar CIE colorimetric. Furthermore, Ag-based blue, green, and red colorful PSCs show transmittances of 38.49%, 40.43% and 38.35%, respectively (Fig. 9(a)). The Ag-based colorful electrode shows the highest transmittance originated from the higher transmittance of the Ag thin film. Comparing both metal alloy system, the Al:Ag-based colorful electrode show higher transmittance (Fig. 9(c)) than Cu:Ag-based colorful electrode (Fig. 9(b)) due to the better cavity effect with the Al:Ag thin film. Thus, to establish the feasible performance of colorful PSCs, Jsc values calculated from the EQE data and the color purity parameters are compared in Table 6. The Ag-based colorful PSC shows lower Jsc than that of Cu:Ag metal alloy-based one. The increase of Jsc is also observed in Al:Ag-based colorful PSC. The Al:Ag-based colorful PSC achieves the highest Jsc attributed to the higher reflectance of the metal film. The result follows the tendency of the device performance under one sun as discussed previously. The optical characteristic of the complete device structure also follows the trend of electrical characteristics, i.e., the Ag-based blue, green, and red colorful PSC exhibit the highest transmittance of 17.16%, 14.24% and 10.57%, respectively. In addition, Al:Ag-based PSC exhibits not only higher transmittance than that of Cu:Ag-based PSC, but also better color purity as corroborated by the narrower FWHM. It is worthwhile to mention that the complete PSC device structure exhibits lower transmittance than the electrode structure itself since the active layer in PSC absorbs a certain amount of incident light. Nevertheless, the Al:Ag-based device retains its color purity even in the complete structure, justifying its feasibility in the aesthetic applications of solar cells.

4. Conclusions
A highly efficient novel colorful PSC is fabricated following a metal–dielectric–metal electrode structure with a metal alloy. The application of metal alloy in the MDM structure improves the performance of PSC compared to pure Ag metal. A Cu:Ag-based colorful PSC achieves similar device performance as the Ag-based one with a built-in voltage of 0.77 V. However, the Al:Ag-based colorful devices outperforms all the other devices even the Ag-based one achieving PCEs of 13.62%, 13.30%, 13.43% for blue, green, red devices, respectively resulted from higher Jsc, Voc, and a fill factor. AFM studies revealed that the island formation in the Ag thin film was reduced in the metal alloy films, resulting in lower surface roughness which leads to better charge transportation in the device. The smoother surface also increases the reflectance of the film resulting in an increase in the current density of the device. The Al:Ag-based colorful devices exhibit not only higher cell efficiency, but also better color purity as revealed from the narrower FWHM of the transmission peaks. Therefore, the proposed highly efficient colorful PSCs show high potential as BIPV in aesthetic applications.
