    , Accepted 9th August 2017First published on 9th August 2017AbstractPhotovoltaics have been regarded as a promising solution to energy and environmental problems, however the state-of-the-art photovoltaics cannot harvest energy or therefore generate electricity in completely dark conditions. To address this issue, we present here the realization of physical proof-of-concept hybridized solar cells by tailoring photovoltaics with polyaniline and its derivates for harvesting energy from the sun and rain. Through interfacial engineering, the optimized polyaniline–graphene/PtCo tailored solar cell yields a photo efficiency of 9.09% under air mass 1.5 illumination and a dark efficiency of up to 25.58% as well as current and voltage under the stimulus of real rain. This work may enable scientists to explore advanced all-weather solar cells revolutionizing photovoltaics.
Introduction
Photovoltaics have guided an energy revolution by persistent advancements in both cell materials and fabrication technologies.1–6 The state-of-the-art solar cells generate electrons by absorbing photons under sunlight illumination,7 yielding maximized power conversion efficiencies of >26% for silicon solar cells, 14.3% for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), 22% for perovskite solar cells, 12% for organic solar cells, and 11% for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, etc. A prerequisite to realize electricity generation is to activate photoabsorbers under sunshine, but this leads to a relatively low power output in a rainy atmosphere and even zero efficiency in the dark. One promising solution to this impasse is to convert infrared energy into visible light by complicated up-conversion processes.8,9 The previous study in this field mainly focused on integrating nanostructured up-conversion materials with mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) film or p–n junctions, leading to a reduced light penetration for photoabsorber excitation. Moreover, the gigantic surface states can trap photogenerated electrons transporting along percolating TiO2 pathways. Therefore, the final photoelectric conversion efficiencies for the up-converting photovoltaics are still at the same level as those of traditional devices.
To address this issue, we have launched a constructive strategy of harvesting energy by hot-pressing reduced graphene oxide film with flexible DSSC panels,10 generating a cell efficiency of 6.53% under simulated sunlight irradiation (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) as well as microamp level current and a voltage of hundreds of microvolts under simulated rain. The mechanism behind this is the charging/discharging process for pseudocapacitance,11,12 arising from the electrical double-layer (EDL) created by absorbing cations (raindrops) onto electrons (graphene film). A golden rule in designing advanced photovoltaics is to maximize photoelectric conversion efficiency in the daytime and to supplement this with additional performances. Guided by this principle, graphene tailored conducting coatings have been built onto rigid DSSC architectures by a simple printing method, giving an efficiency of 9.8% and increased current and voltage signals.13 Using the same method, platinum alloys have been applied in rain-enabled solar cells,14 as a result of electron deviation from transition metal to platinum atoms because of the high electronegativity of platinum species. However, the high cost of platinum alloy film drives us to explore other cost-effective energy-harvesting materials. Moreover, a remaining problem for such rain-enabled photovoltaics is that they cannot produce electric power in the dark without rain.
To address the above-mentioned issues, we present here the fabrication of hybridized solar cells that consist of rain-enabled electrodes from nanostructured polyaniline (PANi) derivates, and a fluorescent photoanode. The common feature of PANi is that it presents a fully conjugated backbone with highly delocalized π electrons,15,16 which can combine with cations of rainwater for an emerging EDL at interfaces. Furthermore, the green-emitting photoanode absorbs unabsorbed flux ranging from visible to infrared light in the daytime and emits monochromatic green fluorescence lasting for several to hundreds of hours,17 covering part or the whole of the night. The emphases of the current work are to highlight how trifunctional hybridized photovoltaics can be realized by advanced interfacial design, and to explore dark performances.
Experimental section
Preparation of bilayer electrodes
The feasibility of synthesizing bilayer PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo electrodes on FTO/glass/ITO (FTO: fluorine doped tin oxide; ITO: indium tin oxide) substrates was confirmed by the following procedures. In detail, the required amount of indium nitrate was dissolved in diacetylmethane using diethanol amine (DEA) as an additive and refluxed at 60 °C for 3 h. Stannic chloride (at a molar ratio of In:Sn of 10:1) was dissolved in ethanol to form a homogeneous solution, which was added to the above-mentioned indium nitrate solution to obtain ITO sol. Subsequently, the ITO sol was coated onto the glass surface of a freshly cleaned FTO glass substrate (sheet resistance: 12 Ω square−1), dried with air, and calcined at 550 °C for 30 min. By repeating the steps several times, FTO/glass/ITO substrates were obtained. Finally, a cyclic voltammetry method employing a working electrode of FTO/glass/ITO substrate, a counter electrode (CE) of Pt sheet, and a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl was applied to prepare the bilayer electrodes. Prior to electrochemical deposition, 9.108 mL of aniline monomer and 12.882 mL of concentrated HCl aqueous solution (with a molar aniline/HCl ratio of 1.0:1.5) were mixed, and deionized water was added to obtain a total volume of 200 mL. The deposition processes for the PANi electrode were performed at room temperature for 20 min by scanning from −0.2 to +1.0 V at a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1. The PANi–graphene electrode was prepared according to the following details: 0.0612 g of graphene and 10 mL of aniline were mixed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Subsequently, the reagent was refluxed at 184 °C for 6 h in an N2 atmosphere to form aniline–graphene complexes. 1.48 mL of the resultant aniline–graphene solution was mixed with 1 M HCl aqueous solution, and deionized water was added to form a 50 mL homogeneous solution. The PANi–graphene electrode was also prepared by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method similar to that used for the PANi electrode. Finally, the PANi–graphene/PtCo electrode was prepared by a potentiostatic method using the bilayer PANi–graphene electrode as a working electrode and a mixture of H2PtCl6 and CoSO4 (2.63 mL of 1 mM H2PtCl6 aqueous solution, 0.196 g of CoSO4 and 0.142 g of Na2SO4 were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution). PtCo alloys were incorporated into the PANi–graphene electrode under a constant potential of −0.6 V for 10 min.
Similarly, the traditional FTO glass supported PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo counter electrodes were prepared according to previous procedures.
Preparation of photoanodes
Colloidal titanium dioxide (TiO2) film with a thickness of 10 μm and an active area of 0.25 cm2 was prepared by coating TiO2 colloid onto an FTO glass, drying in air, and calcining at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) film. A TiO2/long persistence phosphors (LPPs) composite photoanode was prepared by spin-coating 0.25 g mL−1 of green-emitting LPPs (H-1B, purchased from Shenzhen HuiDuoSheng Luminous Material Co., Ltd.) in ethanol onto colloidal TiO2 film at a rotation speed of 2000 rpm for 20 s. Subsequently, both TiO2 and TiO2/LPP electrodes were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min in air and finally sensitized by 0.25 mmol dm−3 of N719 dye ([cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid)-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate], purchased from DYESOL LTD, Australia) in ethanol solution for 24 h to obtain the final dye-sensitized m-TiO2 and m-TiO2/LPP photoanodes.
Assembly of photovoltaic
The hybridized solar cell was built by sandwiching a redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized m-TiO2/LPP photoanode and a counter electrode. The architectures for the hybridized solar cell and a traditional solar cell are glass|FTO|TiO2/LPP–electrolyte–PANi (PANi–graphene or PANi–graphene/PtCo)|FTO|glass|ITO|PANi (PANi–graphene or PANi–graphene/PtCo), and glass|FTO|TiO2–electrolyte–PANi (PANi–graphene or PANi–graphene/PtCo)|FTO|glass, respectively. A Surlyn film was utilized to seal the solar cell through a hot press. The redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM LiI, 100 mM tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM NaI, 50 mM I2, 100 mM KI and 500 mM 4-tert-butyl-pyridine.
Photovoltaic measurements
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of photovoltaics were recorded on a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation under irradiation by a simulated solar light from a 100 W Xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in an ambient atmosphere (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask was used to cover the top surface of the hybridized solar cell to avoid stray light. In order to control experimental errors, the photovoltaic performances of solar cells were repeatedly measured at least fifty times, and an average J–V curve was selected for comparison. Before dark J–V curve measurement, the solar cells were illuminated by a simulated solar light for 1 min. Immediately afterwards, the devices were placed in completely dark conditions and the dark J–V curves were recorded on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in air. The solar energy for dye excitation and electron generation in the dark is from the fluorescence of the FTO glass-supported m-TiO2/LPP films, therefore the corresponding fluorescent light intensities recorded by a standard silicon solar cell were used to calculate dark solar cell efficiency according to ηdark = Pmax/Pin, where Pmax and Pin were the maximized power outputs and fluorescent intensity of a m-TiO2/LPP photoanode, respectively.
Measurements for rain-enabled electric signals
A medical syringe filled with simulated rainwater was utilized to control the injection velocity. The inclination angle of the hybridized solar cell and the height between the electrode and the tip of the syringe were 30° and 8 cm, respectively. The electric signals including current and voltage were recorded on the CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation by connecting electrodes A and B, which were covered with silver paint and subsequently protected with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. The amperometric i–t curve (sample interval: 0.05 s) and open circuit potential–time (sample interval: 0.1 s) modes were selected to record current and voltage, respectively, using approximately linear baselines recorded without raindrops as benchmarks.
Characterizations
The top-view morphologies of the green-emitting TiO2/LPP photoanode were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S4800). The electrocatalytic properties of counter electrodes were evaluated by recording CV curves in a supporting electrolyte consisting of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile. Both Nyquist and Bode Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of photovoltaics were carried out in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 105 kHz and at an ac amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. The surface electron concentrations were determined by Hall-effect measurement (ACCENT HL5500PC).
Results and discussion
A traditional solar cell with a sandwiched structure is shown in Fig. 1a, including a dye-sensitized m-TiO2 photoanode, a I−/I3− redox electrolyte and a CE.18,19Fig. 2a shows the characteristic J–V curves of traditional solar cells recorded under simulated sunlight irradiation (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PANi CE tailored device yields a power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.48 ± 0.34% [short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 13.25 ± 1.63 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.643 ± 0.036 V, fill factor (FF) = 64.3 ± 10.1%], which is comparable to the levels previously reported.20,21 By studying interfacial engineering of solar cells, advanced hybridized photovoltaics can be made to meet application-specific requirements featuring high solar cell efficiency, large energy production, and long power-generation time for multi-purpose utilizations ranging from ocean observation platforms to aircrafts. Hybridized solar cells are defined as advanced photoelectric conversion devices that can persistently generate electricity by obeying photoelectric principles on sunny days and through other means in rainy, foggy, haze, windy, and night weathers.22

Combining PANi with graphene via covalent bonding23 allows rapid transfer from graphene to PANi, which is beneficial to the I3− reduction reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface and yields a cell efficiency of 7.60 ± 0.62% in an optimized device. Moreover, the decoration of a PtCo alloy on the PANi–graphene CE can further increase solar cell efficiency to 8.60 ± 0.90%. According to average photovoltaic performances for solar cell devices (ESI Fig. S1†), the enhancement in photoelectric conversion efficiency arises from the increased catalytic activity toward I3− → I−, which can be cross-checked by EIS plots and CV curves (ESI Fig. S2, S3 and Table S1†). Additionally, the resultant Jsc and Voc are important photoelectric parameters. In theory, Voc is dependent on the energy difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple. However, the real Voc output is lower than this theoretical value due to the backward recombination reactions between oxidized I3− species in the electrolyte and electrons at TiO2 pathways. Upon irradiation of the dye–TiO2 photoanode, the dye regeneration and future electron excitation are accelerated by the rapid I3− → I− conversion process at the CE/electrolyte interface. In this fashion, the electron concentration at the photoanode may be increased for a high Jsc output. Analogously, the enhanced potential drop promotes electrons to flow along percolating TiO2 pathways instead of recombining with electrolyte, allowing for an increased Voc. According to ESI Fig. S2 and S3,† PANi–graphene/PtCo and PANi–graphene electrodes have enhanced catalytic behaviors in comparison with pristine PANi CE. In general, the high-performance CE can rapidly reduce I3− into I− ions, which diffuse to the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface for dye recovery. In this fashion, the electron concentration at the photoanode is increased, producing a high potential drop. It is convenient for the electrons to transfer along threshold TiO2 pathways instead of participating in recombination reactions. Therefore, a solar cell having a highly catalytic CE is expected to yield a high Voc output.
Notably, all the J–V curves pass through the coordinate origin, yielding a zero value for both Jsc and Voc.24–29 This means that traditional photovoltaics cannot generate electricity in dark conditions. However, the average sunshine time is only ∼3000 hours per year in China (∼34.2% of total time); in other words, the photovoltaics generate relatively low or no power ∼65.8% of the total time. This proportion of low/no output is higher in rich rainfall areas such as South East Asia and South America. Therefore, it is profoundly important to create rain-enabled persistent electricity generation solar cells for use in all weathers.
Inspired by the electricity generated from moving an ionic liquid droplet on a strip monolayer graphene,30 we have developed reduced graphene oxide,10 platinum alloy,14 and graphene coating13 tailored hybridized solar cells through interfacial engineering. The theory can be summarized as follows: the cations in the raindrop absorb surface electrons from graphene (or the alloy) to form cation/electron pseudocapacitors, which are charged and discharged at the rainwater/graphene (or alloy) interface during the spreading and shrinking processes. Similarly, conducting polymers are inherently conducting in nature, arising from the conjugated π electron system in their structures. Among the family of conducting polymers, PANi is the most intensively studied because of reversible acid/base doping/dedoping, tunable colors and electricity. Using the architecture in Fig. 1b, a solar cell interface can be modified by a PANi layer; the corresponding electric signals under the stimulus of rainwater are shown in Fig. 3 and the data are summarized in Table 2. By reducing the injection velocity from 80 to 10 mL h−1, the average current, voltage and power increase from 1.5 ± 0.5 to 2.7 μA, from 39.7 ± 11.6 to 76.9 μV and from 85.0 ± 28.9 to 243.8 pW, respectively. These results demonstrate that PANi tailored solar cells can also persistently realize electricity generation in rainy weather by obeying the above-mentioned principle. Moreover, the electricity is highly dependent on the time interval between two raindrops. A potential mechanism behind this is that the charging/discharging process is not finished at a short time interval, which leads to a reduced electric signal. This suggests that PANi-tailored solar cells can yield increased power outputs in a light-rain atmosphere.

Due to the semiconducting behavior of PANi,31 the conjugated π electrons cannot produce satisfactory electricity outputs. However, graphene is a crystalline allotrope of two-dimensional carbon having a hexagonal pattern. The abundant π-bonds hybridize together to form both a π-band and π*-band, yielding high electronic conductivity. The imine group (–NH–) has a pair of lone-electrons which can share with carbon atoms in the conjugated graphene structure (–C) to form a covalent band.23 Therefore, aniline–graphene and therefore PANi–graphene which can be prepared by a reflux method can be used to further increase electrical signals. For example, the current, voltage and power outputs are 5.0 ± 0.4 μA, 92.4 ± 17.1 μV and 588.3 ± 105.6 pW for the PANi–graphene tailored solar cell, in comparison to 1.9 ± 0.3 μA, 59.9 ± 2.9 μV and 142.6 ± 34.0 pW for the device with the PANi electrode. Notably, the corresponding electric signals can be further elevated by incorporating PtCo alloy nanoparticles into the PANi–graphene. The electronegativities of Pt and Co are 2.28 and 1.88, respectively, leading to electron deviation from Co to Pt to form an electron-enriched Pt surface.32 In this fashion, the combination of PtCo alloy with PANi–graphene can maximize the electron density to create electricity in rainy weather, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3. This conclusion is cross-checked by Hall measurement, yielding surface electron concentrations of 3.452 × 1016, 3.685 × 1016 and 3.768 × 1016 cm−2 for PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the ionic concentration in simulated rainwater has a significant impact on electricity outputs. For example, the current, voltage and power of the PANi–graphene/PtCo tailored photovoltaics are 3.6 ± 1.1 μA, 89.3 ± 6.2 μV and 442.9 ± 101.5 pW under the stimulus of 0.2 M NaCl aqueous solution, while they are increased to 11.1 ± 0.4 μA, 176.2 ± 60.9 μV and 2269.3 ± 882.9 pW, respectively, by 1.0 M NaCl aqueous solution (Table 3). The ionic-strength dependence behavior makes the photovoltaics promising in the regions having acid rain. Resistance measurements are performed to cross-check that the current and voltage peaks under the stimulus of rainwater do not arise from deviations of ohmic resistance, as shown in ESI Fig. S4.† The ohmic resistances for PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo obtained by I–V curves are 23.44, 13.60 and 15.51 Ω, respectively, without raindrops. The nearly complete coincidence of the I–V curves in the presence of raindrops means that the ohmic resistances are unchanged during the spreading and shrinking processes of rainwater droplets. This result further confirms that the PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo tailored solar cells can create electricity in a rainy atmosphere.

Apart from electric signal values, the durability is a crucial parameter in evaluating the promising applications of photovoltaics. Therefore, we have recorded the long-term stability including current and voltage for at least 1000 s for our solar cells, as shown in ESI Fig. S5.† Although the baselines have fluctuations in comparison with the initial stage, the current and voltage outputs remain stable over 1000 s. These results demonstrate that the so-called rain-enabled photovoltaics have good durability under persistent dropping of simulated rainwater.
The electricity generation performances so far described were all carried out using simulated rainwater.10,13,14 However, the water environments between simulated (NaCl aqueous solution) and real rainwater have significant differences in ion species and concentration, therefore real rainwater was collected in Qingdao, China and used to stimulate the PANi–graphene/PtCo tailored solar cell (ESI Table S2†). As shown in Fig. 5, periodic current and voltage peaks are detected at an injection velocity of 40 mL h−1. The current, voltage and power are calculated to be 0.74 ± 0.37 μA, 15.53 ± 3.94 μV and 26.12 ± 1.24 pW, respectively. The reduced electric signals are attributed to the lower cation concentration in the real rainwater. This result suggests that these categories of solar cells can produce electricity on both sunny and rainy days, which is important if they are to be developed for practical applications.

From studying the interfacial engineering of solar cells, we have developed PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo electrodes which are promising photovoltaics for harvesting energy from sun and rain. However, it is still a challenging issue to produce energy in dark–light conditions with no rain. To address this issue, we further modify the mesoscopic TiO2 anode surface using green-emitting LPPs to build the solar cell architecture shown in Fig. 1c. The resultant m-TiO2/LPP photoanodes can be observed in SEM images (ESI Fig. S6†). Persistent luminescence is a phenomenon in which luminescence from LPPs lasts for hours after the quenching of excitation. Therefore, LPPs have been widely used as night-vision materials in security signs, emergency route signs, displays, traffic signage and medical diagnostics.33 Another feature of LPPs is that they can convert visible and near infrared light into monochromatic visible light. From the optical transmittance of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, as shown in Fig. 6a, one can find that the light with λ < 550 nm is completely absorbed by the photosensitive N719 dye, while the visible light having wavelength of 550–790 nm is partially absorbed, and the light loss is 59% at λ = 790 nm. Therefore not all the light can be utilized in this solar cell architecture. By incorporating green-emitting LPPs into the m-TiO2 anode, as shown in Fig. 1c, almost all of the visible light and 91% of the near-infrared light is absorbed by the LPP layer which subsequently emits monochromatic green photofluorescence for N719 dye excitation in the dark (Fig. 1d). This conclusion can also be supported by Fig. 6b; an emission peak at 513 nm is observed under an excitation wavelength of 900 nm, matching the absorption regions for N719 dyes. Upon irradiation under AM1.5 simulated sunlight, the characteristic J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. Obviously, the photovoltaic performances under simulated sunlight irradiation are markedly increased for the LPP tailored hybridized solar cells. The photo efficiencies for PANi, PANi–graphene and PANi–graphene/PtCo CE tailored solar cells are elevated to 6.91 ± 0.75%, 8.13 ± 0.8% and 9.04 ± 1.83%, respectively. According to the average photovoltaic parameters for hybridized solar cells (ESI Fig. S7 and S8†), the main reason behind this is that the green-emitting fluorescence can also irradiate N719 dyes for electron generation, broadening the light-absorption range. Moreover, the blocking effect of the large LPP particles reduces recombination reactions between I3− species with oxidated N719 dyes and electrons at TiO2 pathways. Therefore, Voc, which reflects the energy difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple, can be increased. When ceasing the simulated light and placing the solar cells in the dark, the final J–V curves do not pass through the coordinate origin, as shown in Fig. 7b. A Jsc of 0.049 ± 0.009 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.259 ± 0.021 V are determined for the PANi electrode tailored device, yielding an efficiency of 9.09 ± 2.76% in the dark. The ηdark is calculated according to ηdark = Pmax/Pin, where Pmax refers to the maximal power output and Pin is the photofluorescent light intensity of the TiO2/LPP photoanode. All the photovoltaic parameters in the dark are increased by replacing PANi with the high-efficiency PANi–graphene/PtCo electrode, and the final ηdark is 25.58 ± 16.3% in our experiment.

In comparison to the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of traditional DSSCs without LPPs (ESI Fig. S9†), one potential mechanism for the high dark efficiency of solar-cell devices with LPPs can be well understood. As shown in Fig. S9,† the maximal IPCE values are 88.1% and 78.0% for the hybridized solar cells with and without green-emitting LPPs, respectively. The increased IPCE is attributed to the re-absorption of green photofluorescence by the LPP and further excitation of organic dyes, therefore leading to increased Jsc outputs. The corresponding results recorded in the dark and on rainy days demonstrate that the hybridized solar cells reported here can realize persistent power generation in the daytime, on rainy days and at night. Moreover, this work poses a new question as to how to increase the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photovoltaics.
Apart from the high conversion efficiencies of so-called hybridized solar cells in the dark, the electricity outputs can last for several hours, as a result of emission of green fluorescence.34Fig. 8a shows the stacking J–V curves of the PANi–graphene/PtCo tailored solar cell at decay times over one hour. From Table 5, one can find that all photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and ηdark reduce with elongation of the decay time. For example, the initial Jsc, Voc, FF and ηdark are 0.089 mA cm−2, 0.331 V, 52.1% and 25.58%, and they decrease to 0.064 mA cm−2, 0.301 V, 45.0% and 14.44%, respectively, over one hour. By plotting these data as a function of decay time, as shown in Fig. 8c–e, it can be seen that the photovoltaic reduction mainly occurs in the first 5 min and subsequently the levels remain relatively constant for a long time. Therefore, the future focus for increasing dark performances may be placed on developing LPPs with high photofluorescence intensity and super-long afterglow. On–off switches are performed to evaluate the repeatability of the solar cells with and without LPPs by alternately changing days and nights, as shown in Fig. 8b. The traditional device with the PANi–graphene/PtCo electrode yields a photocurrent of 17.3 mA cm−2 under AM1.5 irradiation, while it increases to around 17.7 mA cm−2 by incorporating LPPs into the mesoscopic TiO2 anode. This result agrees well with the above-mentioned cell performances for the hybridized solar cells. By magnifying the dark current, as shown in ESI Fig. S10,† the current locates at zero for the traditional device, whereas it is approximately 890 μA cm−2 for the LPP tailored hybridized photovoltaics. In addition, the device has good repeatability after multiple cycles.

Conclusions
In summary, a hybridized solar cell is tailored with electron-enriching PANi and its derivates to harvest energy from both sun and rain. The photoelectric conversion efficiency can be increased to 8.60% under AM1.5 irradiation by modifying the solar cell interface with PANi–graphene/PtCo, and the electric signals under the stimulus of rainwater are also improved due to the increased electron density. Further interfacial studies are carried out by incorporating green-emitting LPPs with the aim of enhancing solar cell efficiency and power-generation ability at night, yielding a photo efficiency of 9.09% and a dark efficiency as high as 25.58%. The preliminary results demonstrate that the persistent electricity output for an optimized hybridized solar cell can last for one hour in completely dark conditions and has good repeatability when alternately irradiating and darkening the device. This work represents a significant step forward, as it realizes the concept of developing all-weather solar cells that can create electricity in daytime and rainy conditions as well as at night.
