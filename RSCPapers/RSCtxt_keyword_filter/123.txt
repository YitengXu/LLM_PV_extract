    , Accepted 9th January 2020First published on 11th January 2020AbstractA visible-light-active CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 nanowire (NW) photoelectrode was prepared by in situ growth of g-C3N4 on the surface of TiO2 NWs, followed by drop deposition of Zn-doped CuInSe2 quantum dots (CuInSe2:Zn QDs). It has a 2.205 eV band gap and can absorb visible light. The as-prepared ternary hybrid nanocomposite CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs shows high photon absorption and photocurrent generation efficiency, as well as a high bactericidal effect on Staphylococcus aureus.
1. Introduction
Finding a safe and green antibacterial method has become the goal of scientists all over the world as traditional antibacterial methods possess many drawbacks. TiO2 is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts, and has the advantages of low cost, non-toxicity and good stability.1,2 Among all TiO2 nanostructured materials, TiO2 nanowire arrays have achieved great success due to their short diameter that facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. However, its band gap is wider (3.2 eV), and the corresponding absorption starts at 387 nm (UV region), which severely limits visible light absorption.3–5 Many attempts have been made to expand the light absorption range of TiO2 while maintaining its excellent photocatalytic performance, including the sensitization of TiO2 using noble metals (for example, Au,6–8 Pt,7,9–11 and Ag12) and narrow-bandgap semiconductor combinations, such as CdS,13,14 PbS,9,15 CuO,16,17 Cu2O,18,19 Bi2S3,20,21 CdSe,22–25 and CdTe.23,26
As one of the most effective bactericidal materials, TiO2 photocatalysts have proven their successful inactivation of bacteria, viruses and cancer cells.27–29 Under the excitation of light, the ˙OH radicals and superoxide radicals produced by TiO2 nano-semiconductor materials have strong oxidizing abilities, which can lead to protein polypeptide chain breakage, lipid decomposition or sugar depolymerization, and then the death of bacteria or even viruses.30 Shang and co-workers developed a nitrogen–silver co-doped TiO2 visible light catalyst to achieve photoelectrocatalytic inactivation of E. coli and achieved good results.31 The experiment at the University of Tokyo has shown that photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria can simultaneously catalyse the decomposition of residues and avoid the secondary toxicity of bacteria to health.32 The method of TiO2 photocatalytic bactericide is undoubtedly an ideal and promising approach.
In this work, TiO2 nanowires (NWs) were prepared and modified with g-C3N4 and Zn-doped CuInSe2 quantum dots, a narrow-bandgap material with a 2.25 eV bandgap, to enhance the absorption in the visible light region. The photoelectric activity and the bactericidal effect of the composite against S. aureus were investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reagents and apparatus
Titanium foil was purchased from Sigma Aldrich China. Sodium fluoride and sodium hydrogen sulfate were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory. Both sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Tianjin Komi Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid solution were purchased from Star Co., Ltd (Zhuzhou, China). Zinc acetate, indium chloride, gallium chloride and urea were purchased from Sinopharm Group Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Cuprous chloride, arsenic powder, oleylamine, oleic acid, 1-octadecene, dodecanethiol, glutathione, ethanol and acetone were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All reagents were used directly without further purification. Ultrapure water was used throughout the experiments.
The titanium oxide nanomaterials were crystallized in a tube furnace (SK2-15, Changsha Far East Electric Power Plant). Photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Company). The surface topography of the prepared substrate was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and a field emission electron projection microscope (Titan G2 60-300, USA). The absorbance value of the relevant solution was obtained using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2550, Japan). A constant temperature shaking incubator (Guangdong Keli PYX-190Z-A), desktop centrifuge (Shanghai Anting TGL-16G), collector type magnetic stirrer (DF-101), and electronic analytical balance (Mettler AE163, Germany) were used.
2.2. Fabrication of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs photoelectrode
TiO2 NWs were prepared by alkaline hydrothermal growth.33 A 2 cm × 4 cm titanium sheet was sanded with an abrasive cloth and ultrasonically cleaned for 10 min in a mixed solution of methanol and acetone at a volume ratio of 3:1. The titanium sheet was placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined autoclave containing 25 mL of 2 M NaOH solution. After reacting at 250 °C for 2 h, the titanium sample was immersed in 25 mL of 0.6 mol L−1 HCl solution for 30 min to achieve Na+ exchange with H+. The sample was taken out of the HCl solution and rinsed several times with ultrapure water and dried with N2. The prepared electrode was calcined at 500 °C for 3 h at a heating and cooling rate of 6 °C min−1, then taken out for use.
CuInSe2:Zn quantum dots were synthesized based on the reported thermal decomposition method.34,35 The detailed process is as follows: selenium powder (0.19 mM), oleylamine (0.5 mL), diphenyl phosphine (0.2 mL) and oleic acid (50 μL) were mixed into a three-necked flask which was then evacuated to remove moisture and oxygen from the solution. This solution acted as the precursor for selenium. Then, 0.1 mmol of zinc acetate (0.1 mM), 0.075 mmol of cuprous chloride (0.075 mM), 0.1 mmol of indium chloride solid powder (0.1 mM), oleic acid (50 μL) and octadecene and dodecyl mercaptan (4 mL) were uniformly mixed in a three-necked flask and vacuumed cycled and placed under nitrogen. After heating the solution to 160 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1, the selenium precursor solution was injected. The solution was cooled to room temperature in an ice bath 5 min later. Excess ethanol was added. The mixture was centrifuged 3 times at 10000 rpm and dried by a nitrogen blower. The oleophilic CuInSe2:Zn quantum dots were then made hydrophilic by a surface ligand exchange.
TiO2 NWs were completely immersed in a 10% urea solution for various times which determined the loading of g-C3N4. After drying naturally, the electrode sheet was calcined in a muffle furnace at the following calcination conditions: the temperature was raised to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then maintained at 550 °C for 3 h to obtain g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs.
Then, 20 μL of CuInSe2:Zn quantum dots were added to the g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs, and dried in a blast drying oven at 60 °C. After drying, another 20 μL was added and dried. Continuing this cycle, the optimal amount of CuInSe2:Zn was obtained.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical property determination
All electrochemical properties were tested using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua) with the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs as the working electrode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was a 0.35 M Na2SO3 solution containing 0.24 M Na2S. The solar light source was simulated using a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Changtuo Company). The emitted light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was measured by a radiometer (OPHIR, Newport, USA).
2.4. Bactericidal activity measurements
The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was used as a model bacterium to evaluate the bactericidal effect of the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW composite electrode. The bactericidal activity test was carried out in a 72 mL stereo quartz reaction cell with the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrode at a size of 0.5 cm ×4 cm as the photoanode, Pt as the cathode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The xenon lamp with a power of 300 W (100 mW cm−2) was fixed at 10 cm in front of the reactor in which was added of 60 mL 5 × 108 CFU mL−1S. aureus bacteria suspension diluted with sterile saline. The survived bacteria were monitored by taking out plate counts. The bacterial solution diluted 10000 times with sterile saline was uniformly applied to the surface of a solid medium by an applicator. After 24 hours of incubation in a 37 °C incubator, the number of visible colonies was counted. The experiment was repeated three times. Experimental items were all sterilized by high pressure and high temperature (121 °C) for 20 minutes to ensure the aseptic operation of the experiment. Microscopic analysis of bacteria at different bactericidal time points was performed by a Nikon ultra-high resolution spectral confocal microscope under a 100-fold oil microscope.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Nano structural characterization

Fig. 1A shows the SEM images of the top view (inset) and cross section of TiO2 NWs. The TiO2 nanowires are arranged in an orderly manner with a smooth surface and a slight cross-linking at the top. After subsequently assembling with g-C3N4 and CuInSe2:Zn QDs, lots of tiny particles are deposited on the TiO2 nanowires, which consequently become rough, as shown in Fig. 1B. The EDS spectrum of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs (Fig. 1C) reveals the characteristic peaks of Ti, O, C, N, Cu, In, Se and Zn. Fig. 1D shows the XRD patterns of the prepared CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs in the range of 10–80°. The star represents the diffraction peak of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card number 21 1272),36 and two typical diffraction peaks of g-C3N437 can also be seen. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.77°, 44.43° and 54.64° are assigned to the (112), (220), and (312) crystal planes of the chalcopyrite (tetragonal) CuInSe2:Zn QDs (JCPDS 00-051-1221), respectively. Based on the XRD analysis we can confirm the successful deposition of g-C3N4 and CuInSe2:Zn QDs on the TiO2 NWs.

3.2. Photoelectrochemical properties of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs
Due to the narrow band gap of 2.25 eV, CuInSe2:Zn QDs can absorb visible light. While g-C3N4 has a band gap of 2.62 eV, it can absorb visible light and its heterojunction promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers. Incorporating the CuInSe2:Zn QDs and g-C3N4 with the TiO2 NWs would expand the absorption light range to the visible light region. The loading mass of CuInSe2:Zn and g-C3N4 was optimized at first. As shown in Fig. 2A, the photocurrents increase with the increase of CuInSe2:Zn QDs. The maximum photocurrent was obtained when 0.5 mL CuInSe2:Zn QDs was applied. The excessive CuInSe2:Zn QDs may block the TiO2 NWs, decreasing the transfer of electrons/holes.

Fig. 2B shows the dependence of photocurrent on the loaded g-C3N4 amount, which is represented by the immersion time (h) of the electrode in a 10% urea solution. The maximum photocurrent of 0.46mA cm−2 was achieved at 4 hours of immersion. It was 2.56 times that of the bare TiO2 NW electrode. By immersing in a urea solution, a g-C3N4 layer was fabricated on the surface of the TiO2 NW electrode after a 550 °C calcination.
The effects of the CuInSe2:Zn QDs and g-C3N4 in the enhancement of the photoelectrical performances were investigated by comparing the photocurrents and open circuit voltage of the unmodified and modified TiO2 NWs. Modifications of either g-C3N4 or CuInSe2:Zn (Fig. 3A curve c) can enhance the photocurrent. The highest photocurrent value of 3.25 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 is observed on the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs electrode. It is about 18 times that observed on the pure TiO2 NWs electrode (0.18 ± 0.02 mA cm−2). One can see that the modification with CuInSe2:Zn results in more increases in the photocurrent than the modification with g-C3N4, indicating that the higher absorption efficiency of visible light can be attributed to CuInSe2:Zn.

The recombination kinetics of the electrodes can be evaluated based on the instantaneous open circuit voltage (VOC) from the illuminated quasi-equilibrium state to the dark balance. A negative open circuit potential means there is an efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which contributes to a high photo-electric conversion efficiency.38 The open circuit potential became more negative as the TiO2 NWs were modified with CuInSe2:Zn QDs, g-C3N4, and CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4, indicating that the modification of CuInSe2:Zn QDs, g-C3N4 or both of them can help the separation of the photogenerated electrons/holes. The photovoltage decays upon returning the photoelectrodes to dark after 200 s of illumination. A slow decay rate implies that the photogenerated electrons/holes have a long lifetime.39 The decay rate follows a decreasing tendency: TiO2 NWs, g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs, CuInSe2:Zn/TiO2 NWs, CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs. The CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs have the longest lifetime of the photogenerated electrons/holes.
The I–V characteristics (Fig. 3C) further confirm the superior performance of the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrodes over those of CuInSe2:Zn/TiO2 NW, g-C3N4/TiO2 NW and pure TiO2 NW electrodes. The corresponding light to chemical energy conversion efficiencies are shown in Fig. 3D, which were calculated as follows:40–42 (1)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of the incident light (74 mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential, which is 1.23 VNHE, and the applied potential is Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode at open circuit conditions, under the same illumination, and in the same electrolyte. The voltage at which the photocurrent becomes zero was taken as Eaoc.
The efficiencies measured for the g-C3N4 (Fig. 3D curve b) and CuInSe2:Zn (Fig. 3D curve c) sensitized cells were 0.31% at −1.36 V vs. Ag/AgCl under irradiation and 1.09% at −1.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl under irradiation, respectively. For the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrodes (Fig. 3D curve d), a saturated photocurrent density of 3.25 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 represents a marked increase and the maximum photoconversion efficiency obtained for this device was 1.52% at −1.40 V vs. Ag/AgCl under irradiation. Considering that nanowires cannot carry more sensitizers, the result is quite remarkable.
The enhancement in photoelectric performance is due to the increase in absorption in the visible light region, which can be observed from the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3E. The separation of the photogenerated electrons/holes that leads to a long lifetime can be observed from the photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 3F. The sensitization with either g-C3N4 or CuInSe2:Zn QDs improves the light absorption in both the UV and visible light region. When both the CuInSe2:Zn QDs and g-C3N4 are used, the highest light absorption is obtained (Fig. 3C curve d).
Photoluminescence measures the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result, the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes can be judged based on the photoluminescence intensity. A low photoluminescence intensity corresponds to a low recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes, or a long lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes.43,44 From Fig. 3D, one can see that the modifications with g-C3N4 (curve b), CuInSe2:Zn QDs (curve c), and CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4 (curve d) result in gradual decreases of the photoluminescence intensity, indicating that the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes gradually increases in these materials.
3.3. Bactericidal effect
Typically, a slight bias can facilitate the efficient separation of electrons and holes, and improve the electrical adsorption of bacteria on the electrode surface, causing electrical sterilization and electrophoresis to increase the light living substance concentration.45,46Fig. 4 shows the bias potential-dependent photocurrent of the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrode under different conditions. One can see that under all situations, the optimal bias potential is almost the same around 0.3 V at which the maximum photocurrent is achieved. Since the number of electrons and holes is constant, continuing to increase the bias voltage will result in a decrease in the photoelectric density. While there is no S. aureus in the dark (curve d), there is no response because of no reaction and no illumination-resulting background current. A significant peak near 0.3 V was observed in curves (a) and (b) compared to the curves (c) and (d), which means that more S. aureus can be oxidized at this potential. Thus, in the principle of conservation, we selected a 0.3 V bias as the optimum bias voltage in the bactericidal assay.

Fig. 5A shows the antibacterial activity effect of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs on S. aureus in different processes. Direct photolysis (curve a) killed S. aureus much less than other processes. 54.6% and 74.1% of S. aureus were inactivated in photocatalytic (curve b) and electrochemical oxidation processes (curve c), respectively. The advantage of the external bias can be observed in effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers. Almost all S. aureus was inactivated in the photoelectrocatalytic (curve d) process. The results show that photoelectrocatalysis is the most effective sterilization process among the above four. The bactericidal effect in the photoelectrocatalytic process is enhanced by the synergistic effect of electrochemical oxidation and photocatalysis.47

(C) Antibacterial tests using the photoelectrode once (a) and repeatedly (b) under the same conditions. (D) Changes in FTIR spectra of S. aureus during the photoelectrocatalysis inactivation process. 

Fig. 5B compares the antibacterial activity effect of applying different photocatalysts under the same conditions. CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs (curve d) almost completely inactivated S. aureus after 60 min of photocatalytic inactivation at a 0.3 V bias, while CuInSe2:Zn/TiO2 NW (curve c), g-C3N4/TiO2 NW (curve b) and TiO2 NW (curve a) electrodes inactivated 75.5%, 61.6%, and 47.7% of S. aureus, respectively. When the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrode was illuminated by simulated sunlight, not only does g-C3N4 absorb more in the visible light region to generate more carriers, but also electrons are transferred from the conduction band of g-C3N4 to that of CuInSe2:Zn and the photogenerated electrons will continuously transfer across the CuInSe2:Zn/TiO2 interface to TiO2 NWs. Therefore, the efficient separation of electrons and holes makes the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrode have better antibacterial activity than other electrodes. In addition, we stored the used CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW photoelectrode and used it again after four weeks for bactericidal test to verify the recyclability of the material. Fig. 5C shows that CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs still inactivated approximately 90% S. aureus after 60 min photocatalytic inactivation at a 0.3 V bias, which indicates that the nanocomposite electrode has relatively good recyclability.

Fig. 5D shows the infrared spectrum of S. aureus after the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW photoelectrocatalytic inactivation under light at a 0.3 V bias. The functional groups are determined by reference to the peak positions of biomolecules and bacterial cells.48,49 The νas(PO2−) peak in the nucleic acid is located at 1237 cm−1, the aldehyde-based stretching vibration peak is at 1334 cm−1, the CO stretching vibration peak of the amino compound amide is located at 1656 cm−1, the νa(CH2) is located at 2920 cm−1, the amino compound CN peak is located at 1543 cm−1, the polypeptide sugar ring vibration peak is at 1083 cm−1, and νa(CH2) is located at 3380 cm−1. One can see that there is a complete characteristic peak spectrum at 0 minutes, whereas the characteristic peak of the bacteria's organic matter is reduced and weakened to varying degrees with increasing sterilization time. It is indicated that the bacterial structure is destroyed during the photoelectrocatalytic inactivation process of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs, especially the amino compound that comprises the bacterial cell membrane structure, the protein composed of the polypeptide sugar ring and the enzyme structure.
In order to better understand the photoelectrocatalytic inactivation process, we analyzed the bacterial CLSM pattern before and after photoelectrocatalytic antibacterial treatment, as shown in Fig. 6. At 0 min, the nucleus appeared dim blue, and no PI passed through the intact cell membrane, and the bacteria maintained a relatively full globular structure. However, after 60 minutes of photoelectron-catalysis, the amount of DAPI dye solution entering the cells increased, the nucleus was bright blue, and almost all cells were stained with PI, indicating that the integrity of the bacterial structure was destroyed, the cell membrane showed obvious damage, and the bacteria were inactivated. One can further prove that the photoelectrocatalytic inactivation with CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs severely destroys the bacterial structure and has a significant bactericidal effect.

3.4. Discussion on bactericidal reaction mechanisms

Scheme 1 briefly describes the transport of electrons and holes in CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs and the mechanism involved in the bactericidal reaction. When TiO2 NWs are activated under ultraviolet light, the excited state electrons will migrate directly from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), leaving holes at the VB. However, photogenerated electrons and holes have a short lifetime and they will soon recombine. The situation is improved when CuInSe2:Zn and g-C3N4 are modified onto TiO2 NWs. First, there is a difference in the Fermi level between CuInSe2:Zn and g-C3N4. The alignment of the Fermi level causes the band gaps of g-C3N4 and CuInSe2:Zn to move up and down, which is beneficial to the transmission of photogenerated electrons. Furthermore, due to the narrow band gap of g-C3N4 and CuInSe2:Zn, the composite electrode increases the absorption of visible light. When the CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NW electrode is illuminated, more photons can be captured and excited to migrate electrons from the VB to the CB. The generated photoelectrons flow from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of CuInSe2:Zn, and finally, to the CB of the TiO2 NWs. Photoelectrons accumulated in TiO2 NWs react with oxygen adsorbed on the surface, and the resulting product is O2− or ˙O2−, which is then combined with H+ to form H2O2. H2O2 reacts with ˙O2− to generate ˙OH. The photogenerated holes aggregate in the VB of g-C3N4, which forms a hole center and oxidizes with H2O to form ˙OH. The generated ˙OH can effectively attack the cell membrane, destroy the integrity of the membrane structure or electrolyze the molecules on the cell surface, resulting in a large number of cell lysis and bacterial death.50–53 The following equation is the process in which the electrons participate in the reaction after being excited in the VB of g-C3N4: g-C3N4 + hν → g-C3N4(e−) + g-C3N4(h+)(2) g-C3N4(e−) + CuInSe2:Zn → g-C3N4 + CuInSe2:Zn(e−)(3) CuInSe2:Zn(e−) + TiO2 → CuInSe2:Zn + TiO2(e−)(4) 2TiO2(e−) + 2H+ + O2 → H2O2 + 2TiO2(5) TiO2(e−) + O2 → O2−˙ + TiO2(6) H2O2 + O2−˙ → OH˙ + OH− + O2(7) g-C3N4(h+) + H2O → g-C3N4 + H+ + OH˙(8) OH˙ + bacteria → inactivated bacteria(9)

4. Conclusions
We have successfully prepared and characterized a ternary hybrid CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs photoelectrode. The g-C3N4 was grown in situ on the surface of the TiO2 NWs, followed by adsorption deposition of CuInSe2:Zn QDs by the hanging drop method. The prepared electrode exhibits highly efficient light harvesting and charge transfer. The nanocomposite CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 shows a higher efficiency in the photocatalytic inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus, compared with that of CuInSe2:Zn/TiO2 NWs, g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs or pure TiO2 NWs. In particular, after four weeks of storage, the recycled photoelectrode typically maintains about 90% of its initial photoelectrocatalytic bactericidal efficiency. The excellent photoelectrochemical activity of CuInSe2:Zn/g-C3N4/TiO2 NWs can be attributed to the synergistic effect of CuInSe2:Zn, g-C3N4 and TiO2 NWs.
