    , Accepted 12th November 2022First published on 14th November 2022AbstractThe active layer morphology of non-fullerene organic solar cells is one of the key factors affecting the power conversion efficiency (PCE); however, current experimental techniques cannot be used to directly observe the structural information at the electronic level. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations provide effective means to explore the morphology and properties of active layers. In this paper, the local molecular stacking of PM6:Y6 films is simulated based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and the simulation results show that the donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules are pi–pi stacked and some Y6 molecules are arranged in order. The excited state information of PM6:Y6 dimers was calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The results showed that ΔES1–CT < 0.1 eV, and dimers have very low exciton binding energy (Eb). The charge transfer processes of the D–A dimer are LE → CTX → CS and LE → CTX → CT1 → CS combined with hole–electron analysis. Moreover, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of J-type stacked dimers is similar to that of PM6:Y6 films. Finally, the electron transfer rates (kelectron) and hole transfer rates (khole) were calculated by Marcus theory, and the results showed that the PM6:Y6 system has high charge transfer rates, but the effect of molecular configuration on kelectron is less than that on khole. The properties of PM6:Y6 films were systematically investigated at the theoretical level in this work, and it demonstrated that PM6:Y6 films have pi–pi stacking, low ΔES1–CTX, low Eb, and high charge transfer rates.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received much attention in recent years because of their advantages such as low cost, flexibility, and light weight.1–10 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have a nanoscale donor/acceptor (D/A) interpenetrating-network structure that facilitates carrier transport in the active layer, which has been the mainstream of research.11–14 Recent studies have shown that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ OSCs has reached 16% to 19%.15–24 In addition to the nature of D/A molecules in the active layer, PCE is closely related to the conformation and stacking of molecules. Therefore, exploring the conformation and stacking of D/A molecules is beneficial for analyzing the formation, transport and separation processes of electrons and holes, and can provide guidance for the design and synthesis of high-performance photovoltaic materials. However, until now, experimental techniques have not been used to observe the structural information at the electronic level, which has been a barrier to designing higher performance photovoltaic materials.25,26 Quantum chemical methods can explore the electronic structure and accurately calculate the forces on atoms, and have been widely used in the microscopic mechanism of OSCs.27–30 In addition, the molecular dynamics (MD) method is used to simulate the dynamic evolution of molecules in the active layer of OSC films, which is of great significance to reveal the conformation and morphology of molecules.31–33 However, due to the low precision of molecular field parameters, the accuracy of classical MD simulation results is not high. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) can be used to accurately calculate electronic structures, and atomic and molecular interactions, and then simulate the trajectory of molecules over time to obtain the evolution of molecular morphology in the active layer.34,35 It is important to analyze molecular conformation, stacking and charge transfer processes. Among them, the tight-binding quantum mechanical approach Geometry Frequency Noncovalent-eXtended TB (GFN-xTB) focuses on molecular structural properties and performs robustly, and is widely applicable.36
In this work, AIMD simulations of the PM6:Y6 films (5010 atoms) were performed using cp2k software packages, based on the GFN-xTB method. The molecular conformations and stacking style of PM6 (2 repeating units of the PM6 molecule) and Y6 were obtained by trajectory analysis. Then, 4 D–A dimers were selected from AIMD simulation results, and its excited state information, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra and exciton binding energy (Eb) were calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) level by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. Finally, the charge transfer rates (kCT) and carrier mobility (μ) of PM6:Y6 were obtained by using semi-classical Marcus theory, and the process of electron–hole formation, transfer and separation is revealed. This study provides a theoretical explanation for the high PCE of the PM6:Y6 system, and a reference for estimating that of other high-performance organic photovoltaic systems.
2. Computational details
2.1 
          Ab initio molecular dynamics
The AIMD simulations were performed in the CP2K package37 using the GFN1-xTB38 method. Since PM6 of two structural units and Y6 molecules contain 314 atoms and 187 atoms, which requires a large amount of calculation, we only simulate the morphology of films composed of 10 PM6 molecules and 10 Y6 molecules (5010 atoms) and the random distribution of 10 Y6 molecules and 10 PM6 molecules in the box by using the packmol package.39 After several tests, the box size was finally selected as 60 × 60 × 60 Å. The MD simulations were first performed using the micro-canonical ensemble (NVE) for 5 ps with a step time of 1 fs to make the molecular spacing sufficiently narrow. Then, the system was heated to 500 K and simulated for 5 ps. Finally, the system was annealed at 300 K and simulated with the canonical ensemble (NVT) for 10 ps to obtain the morphology and molecular structure of PM6:Y6 films. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed in a Nose–Hoover thermostat; the cutoff can be set to 650 Ry; periodicity was set to XYZ; the electronic structure was evaluated by the xTB method in the Quickstep module.
2.2 Quantum calculations
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 package40 at the CAM-B3LYP41 (ω = 0.01)/6-31G(d,p) level considering the dispersion correction (DFT-D3).42 It has been demonstrated that UV-vis spectra of PM6 molecules with greater than or equal to two repeating units do not change significantly.31 Therefore, PM6 molecules with two repeating units were selected instead of polymers in this work. Standard exchange–correlation functions and hybridization density functionals (e.g., the very popular B3LYP43,44 function) do not provide accurate estimates of the variation of coulomb potential (1/r, where r is the distance between the two electrons) with distance to electrons, which results in larger errors in interactions between electrons and significant non-local distributions.45,46 The shortcomings of the conventional DFT approach are not sufficient to reasonably describe polymer conjugated molecules and are even less applicable to the CT states at these polymer cross-sections.47 In recent years, the range-separated (RS) density functional41,48,49 has performed well for the calculation of charge-transfer states. The RS density functional is the division of the coulomb interaction and exchange interaction between two electrons into a long-range region and a short-range region. The computationally self-consistent DFT function modulation is achieved by minimizing the error function, which is not dependent on experimental data. (1)
The RS density functional form is as in eqn (1), and the first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the short-range part, which comes from the DFT exchange potential, and the second term is the long-range part, which comes from the Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange potential. erf(x) is the error function, the constants α and β satisfy 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ β ≤ 1. When r12 is close to 0, α indicates the proportion of the exchange term in the short-range limit part, r12 gradually increases, the exchange potential is transferred from DFT to HF, r12 approaches infinity, and ‘α + β’ is the proportion of HF hybridization in the long-range limit part. The ω50–52 is the interval separation parameter in bohr−1, and the larger the ω, the larger the region covered by the long-range part. The RS density functional can accurately describe the CT states in isolated systems, and for different molecular systems, the partition parameter ω is obtained using self-consistent optimization, and one of the commonly used methods is minimizing the objective function J(ω):53 J(ω) = JN(ω) + JN+1(ω)(2) JN(ω) = |εHOMO(N) + IP(N)|(3) JN+1(ω) = |εHOMO(N + 1) + IP(N + 1)|(4)Here, εHOMO(N) refers to the HOMO energy of the neutral molecule containing N electrons, and IP(N) refers to the energy difference between the neutral molecule (N) and the cation (N − 1), also considering the ionization energy of the N + 1 electron anion, see eqn (4). The parameter ω regulates both J(N) and J(N+1), and to describe the energy difference more accurately, a J2 equation is constructed, see eqn (5) (5)When J2 takes the minimum value, ω is the optimal value. It has been proved that ω is more suitable for the excited state calculation of the PM6 molecule and Y6 molecule when ω is taken as 0.01 Bohr−1 in our previous work.31 In order to study the charge transfer process between donor–acceptor molecules, four D–A dimers were taken out from the AIMD simulation traces.
In addition, exciton binding energy has important effects on charge transfer. The Eb determines the exciton complexation tendency, and a lower Eb facilitates the charge separation efficiency.54Eb is defined as the energy difference between the fundamental band gap and the optical band gap. Eb = Efundg − Eoptg(6) Efundg = IP − EA(7)Efund in eqn (6) refers to the difference between ionization energy and affinity energy, Eopt refers to the energy level difference from S0 to S1, and the units of both Efund and Eopt are chosen as eV.
2.3 Charge transfer rate
The charge transfer process of D–A molecules can be approximated as the following two processes, the donor molecules change from neutral to cationic by electron transfer after excitation; the acceptor molecule changes from neutral to anionic through hole transfer after excitation. The charge transfer rate constant kCT for the CT states can be estimated according to the semiclassical Marcus theory as follows: (8)In eqn (8), ℏ is the approximate Planck constant; kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the temperature, set to 298.15 K; VDA denotes the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH)55 method to calculate the electronic coupling; λ is the reorganization energy (in this work, the chosen internal recombination energy λi is approximately equal to λ). ΔG is the difference in the Gibbs free energy during the exciton separation process, and it can be calculated using the Rehm–Weller equation56,57 as follows: ΔGCS = −ΔGCR − ΔES1 − ΔEb(9)In eqn (9), ΔES1 is the first excitation energy of the donor and ΔEb is the exciton binding energy. For the D/A dimer, λi can be calculated using eqn (10).58 λi = (λi1 + λi2)/2(10)
For hole transfer: λi1 = [E0D+ + E*A−] − [E0D0 + E*A−](11) λi2 = [E+D0 + E−A*] − [E+D+ + E−A−](12)
For electron transfer: λi1 = [E*D+ + E*A−] − [E0D0 + E*A*](13) λi2 = [E+D* + E−A0] − [E+D+ + E−A−](14)here E*/E0/E+/E− refers to the energy of excited/basic/cationic/anionic states, respectively; D*/D0/D+ denotes the equilibrium geometry of the donor molecule in excited/basic/cationic states; A*/A0/A− denotes the equilibrium geometry of the acceptor molecule in excited/basic/anionic states.
In eqn (8)VDA is the electron coupling integral, which can be calculated by the Generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH)59 method as follows: (15)In eqn (15), ΔE is the excitation energy difference between the initial and final states; μ is the leap dipole moment between the initial and final states; Δμij is the dipole moment difference between the initial and final states.
The carrier mobility (μ) can be obtained from the Einstein–Smoluchowski formula.60 (16) (17)Here, e is the meta-charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature (300 K), and D is the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient of the charge. In eqn (17), k is the charge transfer rate and r is the center-of-mass distance between the donor and acceptor molecules, obtained by using the Multiwfn software package.61
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Local morphologies
The molecule stacking of the active layer is one of the key factors affecting the PCE, and AIMD simulations can effectively investigate the morphological characteristics of the active layer. In this work, the molecule stacking of PM6 and Y6 was simulated in the 60 × 60 × 60 Å box. Fig. 1a shows the starting and equilibrium structure of the MD simulation for PM6:Y6 films. The initial structure is generated by the packmol package, so that PM6 and Y6 molecules are randomly and uniformly distributed in a 60 × 60 × 60 Å box. The molecular morphology of PM6:Y6 films was obtained after pre-equilibration, temperature increase, constant temperature, annealing and relaxation of the system. As seen from Fig. 1a, PM6 molecules and Y6 molecules gather in the middle of the box after 20 ps AIMD simulation. PM6 and Y6 form an interpenetrating-network structure, which can increase the contact area between the donor and acceptor. The interpenetrating-network structure is beneficial to improving the interfacial charge transfer efficiency. From the local magnified view, it can be seen that some Y6 molecules are orderly stacked and have significant pi–pi stacking. It is consistent with the experimental results, and can enhance electron delocalization and promote charge separation.12,62,63Fig. 1b shows the structure of four pairs of PM6:Y6 dimers extracted from the AIMD simulation results. The D/A interfacial distance of the dimers is about 3.5–3.8 Å, and it is the ideal molecular spacing for pi–pi stacking. Dimer-1 and dimer-3 are end-group pi–pi stacked (J-type), dimer-2 is face-to-face stacked (H-type) and dimer-4 is edge-to-face stacked. Although PM6 and Y6 molecules have different degrees of deformation, the dimers of J-type stacking show obvious parallel interfaces.

In order to explore the distribution ratio of the four dimers in the films, the electronic energy of each dimer was calculated by the DFT method. Fig. 2 shows the electron energy of each dimer, and the relative energy is based on the electron energy of dimer-1. Dimer-2 has the lowest electron energy, dimer-4 has the highest electron energy, and the electronic energy of dimer-1 and dimer-3 are between that of dimer-2 and dimer-4. H aggregation and J aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules increase the electron delocalization range, which can reduce the energy of the system. This indicates that the proportion of H-type (dimer-2) should be the largest, followed by J-type (dimer-1 and dimer-3), while the proportion of edge-to-face stacking (dimer-4) is the smallest in PM6:Y6 films.

3.2 Excited state analysis and UV-vis spectroscopy
To investigate the charge transfer mechanism of the donor–acceptor molecule, the first 20 excited states of each dimer were calculated by the TD-DFT method, as shown in ESI Tables S1–S4.† The maximum absorption wavelength of 820 nm (1.51 eV) for PM6:Y6 films was characterized by Lorena Perdigón-Toro et al.64
As shown in Fig. 3, the ES1 of dimers was 1.636 eV, 1.749 eV, 1.627 eV and 1.807 eV, respectively. The ES1 of dimer-1 and dimer-3 is approximately equal to the experimental value (1.51 eV) with a deviation of about 0.1 eV, the ES1 of dimer-2 and dimer-4 was overestimated by 0.2–0.3 eV compared to the experimental values. We attribute the low ES1 of dimer-1 and dimer-3 to dislocated parallel stacking (J-type) between end-groups, which favors interfacial electron transfer and thus reduces local excitation energy. The face-to-face stacking (H-type) structure of the D/A molecule of dimer-2 results in a strong coupling of the electrons between the donor and the acceptor molecule, which prevents the electron transition from the ground state to the low excited state.65 Dimer-4 shows significant edge-to-face stacking features with the donor and acceptor having minimal overlapping areas of the molecular plane, which limits electron delocalization and increases excitation energy. Therefore, dimer-4 has the highest ES1. It is by now generally accepted that the low energy-offset (ΔES1–CT) between the S1 state and the charge transfer (CT) state can effectively reduce the loss of open circuit voltage (Vloss). The studies of Natsuda et al.66 and Perdigón et al.67 have shown that ΔES1–CT of the PM6:Y6 system is below 0.1 eV. We define the CT state adjacent to the S1 as CTX state. The energy shift between the S1 and CTX (ΔES1–CTX) of dimers was 0.069 eV, 0.041 eV, 0.085 eV and 0.032 eV, respectively. The ΔES1–CTX of dimers, from the largest to smallest is dimer-3 > dimer-1 > dimer-2 > dimer-4. We speculate that this might be due to the relative concentration of energy levels near the highly excited state and the relative dispersion of energy levels near the low excited state. Different stacking methods will lead to slight differences in ΔES1–CTX, but they are all below 0.1 eV.
 Fig. 3  The excitation energies of the singlet (S1) excited state and adjacent charge-transfer states (CTX) of PM6/Y6 dimers. 
It is noteworthy that such a small D/A interface driving force (ΔES1–CT < 0.1 eV) is not conducive to free charge generation, but the PM6:Y6 films still have high carrier mobility. For this reason, we speculate that this is due to the low exciton binding energy (Eb) of PM6:Y6 resulting in the exciton separation efficiency being enhanced, which can increase the carrier mobility. The Eb of the four D/A dimers are given in Fig. 4 as 0.18 eV, 0.16 eV, 0.12 eV and 0.09 eV, respectively. Although the Eb values of the dimers vary slightly, they all remain at a low level. This is consistent with our expectation that sufficiently small exciton binding energies can compensate for the lack of interfacial driving force, allowing the PM6:Y6 films to spontaneously generate free charge carriers upon illumination.68

To further investigate the changes in electron density of local excited (LE) states and CT states of PM6:Y6 dimers after excitation, hole–electron density maps of excited states of each dimer were made based on the hole–electron analysis method. Fig. 5a and b show the hole–electron distribution states for the S1 state, the CTX state (the nearest charge-transfer excited state to S1), and the lowest CT state (CT1), with hole density in blue and electron density in orange. As seen in Fig. 5a, both holes and electrons of the S1 state of dimer-1 are on the Y6 molecule. The electrons are more concentrated in the end-group of Y6, and holes are mainly distributed in the middle part of Y6; the electron density of CTX is distributed on Y6, while the hole density is distributed on PM6, with obvious charge transfer characteristics; the hole and electron density distribution of CT1 is consistent with that of CTX, with significant charge transfer characteristics. From Fig. 5b, it can be seen that the electron density of the S1 state is mainly distributed on Y6, and it is more concentrated on the end-group. The hole density is more widely distributed on both Y6 and PM6; the electron density of CTX and CT1 states is gathered on Y6 molecules and holes are gathered on PM6 with charge transfer characteristics. As can be seen from Fig. S1,† the electron density of the S1 state of dimer-3 is mainly distributed on Y6, and it is more concentrated on the end-group of Y6. The electrons are mainly distributed on PM6, and to a lesser extent on Y6. The electron density and hole density of the S1 state of dimer-4 (Fig. S2†) are uniformly distributed over PM6 and Y6. Interestingly, the hole–electron density distribution of Y6 in dimer-1 is in the opposite orientation to that of the other three dimers. In dimer-1, the electrons are concentrated on the end-group of Y6, whereas the holes of the other dimers are concentrated on the end-group. This is due to the fact that the S1 state of dimer-1 is a LE on the Y6 molecule, and the strongly electronegative F atom on the end-group will attract electrons to transfer. In the S1 state of the remaining three dimers, hole and electron density are distributed on PM6 and Y6. Although the structure of the dimers has a great influence on the hole–electron distribution of the S1 state, the electron density of the CT state is distributed on Y6, while the hole density is distributed on PM6. This exhibits strong charge transfer characteristics. The charge transfer process (Fig. 5c) of the dimers is obtained from the previous analysis. That is, the local excitation of electrons on the Y6 or PM6 molecule forms a local excited state Y6*/PM6*. Then, the exciton diffuses to the D/A interface and dissociates into the CTX state. Finally, part of CTX dissociates to form a charge separated (CS) state (LE → CTX → CS). At the same time, the other part of the CTX state relaxes to the CT1 state and then dissociates into the CS state (LE → CTX → CT1 → CS).

It is by now generally accepted that broadening the absorption spectrum is one of the effective means to improve the PCE of OSCs. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PM6:Y6 films should be contributed to by many dimers. From the above discussion, it can be seen that the ES1 of dimer-1 and dimer-3 is very close to the maximum absorption wavelength of PM6:Y6 films, while the ES1 of dimer-2 and dimer-4 is quite different from the maximum absorption wavelength of the films. Therefore, the absorption peak of J-type dimers (dimer-1 and dimer-3) accounts for the main contribution of the UV-vis absorption spectrum of films and it is worth discussing. The UV-vis spectra of PM6:Y6 films, dimer-1 and dimer-3 are given in Fig. 5d. PM6:Y6 films have strong absorption at 500–900 nm. The absorption peak at 820 nm is usually considered as the characteristic absorption peak of Y6, and the characteristic absorption peak of PM6 is at 630 nm. The maximum absorption peak of dimer-1 is at 760 nm, which is blue-shifted by 60 nm compared to the maximum absorption peak of the films. The PM6 characteristic absorption peak of dimer-1 is redshifted by 40 nm compared to that of the films. The maximum absorption peak is about 80 nm blue-shifted compared with that of the films. However, it is worth noting that the UV-vis spectrum of dimer-3 is very similar to that of PM6:Y6 in solution. This suggests that in solution PM6 and Y6 molecules are likely to exist in the form of D–A dimers (J-type). The aggregation effect of the D–A molecules in the films broadens the range of the absorption spectrum, which results in a dimer with a slightly different UV-vis spectrum from that of the films. Although there are some differences between the positions of the absorption peaks of the dimer and the films, the number and characteristics of the absorption peaks showed consistency. Therefore, partial spectral characteristics of films can be predicted by studying D/A dimers.
3.3 Charge transfer rates and carrier mobility
The charge transfer rate is one of the important factors affecting the PCE of OSCs. To investigate the kinetic equilibrium of charge transfer in PM6:Y6 dimers, the charge transfer rates between each dimer were calculated in this work based on the Marcus theoretical equation. According to Marcus theory, low recombination energy (λ), low Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and high electron coupling (V) are beneficial to increase charge transfer rates (kCT).
The λelectron is generally higher than λhole in Table 1, we attribute this to the fact that PM6 has a higher deformation degree than Y6 during molecular dynamics simulations. PM6 has more conjugated units than Y6, so the rigid plane of PM6 is more prone to distortion. However, the λelectron or λhole of the dimers are very similar. This might be due to a significant deformation of the dimer structure compared to its optimal structure. Interestingly, we found that ΔGelectron is lower than ΔGhole, and it means that electron transfer is easier than hole transfer. This has been attributed to Y6 having a slightly lower excitation energy than PM6. The stacking direction of D/A molecules directly affects the strength of electron coupling. Dimer-2 has an H-type stacking with the largest D/A interface area; dimer-4 has a face-to-edge stacking with the smallest D/A interface area; dimer-1 and -dimer-3 have J-type stacking with the D/A interface area between that of dimer-2 and dimer-4. Thus, dimer-2 has the largest electron coupling, followed by dimer-1 and dimer-3, while dimer-4 has the smallest electron coupling. Under the combined action of factors such as λ, ΔG and V, the kCT-electron values of dimer-1, dimer-2 and dimer-3 are at the same level, but slightly higher than that of dimer-4. This suggests that the electron transfer rate of face-to-face stacking is better than that of face-to-edge stacking. However, the kCT-hole values do not show a similar trend. Both dimer-1 and dimer-3 have J-type stacking, but the hole transfer rates differ by two orders of magnitude. The hole–electron analysis (Fig. 5a, b, S1 and S2†) shows that in the CT state of the D–A dimer, the electron transfers to Y6 and the hole transfers to PM6. It can be found that when the plane of the PM6 molecule is far away from the Y6 molecule, the hole density distribution decreases correspondingly, while the electron density distribution on the Y6 molecule is relatively average, which is attributed to the fact that the surface area of the PM6 molecule is much larger than that of the Y6 molecule. Therefore, the closer the PM6 molecule is to the Y6 molecule, the easier it is for hole transfer to occur. Fig. 1b shows that the Y6 end-group of dimer-3 is located in the middle of the PM6 molecule, so the hole transfer rate is the highest. The Y6 molecule of dimer-2 has the highest degree of face-to-face stacking with the PM6 molecule, but the distance between PM6 and the Y6 molecule is larger due to the action of the branched chain, which will hinder hole transfer. Y6 molecules of dimer-1 and dimer-4 are located at the end of PM6 molecules, and the hole transfer process is the slowest. Therefore, we speculate that the molecular surface area is the potential reason why the D–A stacking direction has little effect on electron mobility, but has significant effect on hole mobility. Alexander J. Gillett et al.69 demonstrated kdissociation = 6.3 × 1010 s−1 by evaluating the electron absorption in transient absorption spectra. The kCT values in Table 1 are similar to their results, which indicates that the theoretical assessment of the charge transfer rates is reliable.

The minimum center-of-mass distance is 4.73 Å, and the maximum center-of-mass distance is 21.58 Å. The greater the centroid distance, the lower the degree of face-to-face overlap between the donor and acceptor. Table 2 shows that μelectron of dimers is about 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the μhole of the remaining dimer molecules is about 10−1 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μelectron of each dimer is approximately equal, while the μhole varies widely. This indicates that the D–A stacking orientation has a small effect on the μelectron, but significantly affects the μhole. It is noteworthy that the μ does not increase with increasing r. This indicates that the D/A center-of-mass distance has little effect on the charge mobility, but the charge mobility is greatly affected by the style of stacking. Liang et al.70 performed space charge-limited current measurements of carrier mobility, and the results show that μelectron-exp ≈ μhole-exp (2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The μelectron and μhole of D–A dimers is higher than the experimental value, which may be because not all molecules are packed as D–A dimers. Thus, the charge transfer is impeded in the films.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the morphology of PM6:Y6 films was obtained based on AIMD simulations, and the results showed that there was an obvious pi–pi stacking between PM6 and Y6, and the branched chains of Y6 molecules could effectively regulate the molecular spacing to keep it at 3.5–3.8 Å. Moreover, some Y6 molecules were aggregated in order, showing obvious pi–pi stacking. Further analysis of the excited states of PM6:Y6 dimers in the AIMD simulation results reveal that ΔES1–CT is less than 0.1 eV, and such a low ΔES1–CT can effectively reduce the Vloss. Meanwhile, the low Eb of PM6:Y6 can make up for the insufficient interfacial charge transfer driving force. The analysis of the hole–electron method indicates that the charge transfer process of the PM6:Y6 dimers is LE → CTX → CS and LE → CTX → CT1 → CS. In addition, we also found that J-type stacked D/A dimers have similar UV-vis spectra to that of PM6:Y6 films, but the absorption intensity is slightly lower. Finally, the charge transfer rates and carrier mobility of each dimer molecule were also calculated in this work. The results show that the PM6:Y6 dimers have excellent charge transfer rates (kdissociation ≈ 1011 s−1), and the effect of molecular configuration on μelectron is slightly lower than that on μhole. These results indicate that the end-group pi–pi stacking, low interfacial energy offset, low Eb and high charge transfer rates are the key factors for PM6:Y6 to possess high PCE.
