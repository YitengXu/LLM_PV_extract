    , Accepted 16th March 2019First published on 18th March 2019AbstractDesign of two-dimensional (2D) quaternary copper–zinc–tin–sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) nanosheets (NSs) consisting of purely earth abundant elements with desired morphologies, compositions and phases is challenging by conventional colloidal synthesis routes. Here we report the colloidal synthesis of ultra-thin (∼2 nm) phase-pure 2D wurtzite CZTS NSs using 2D copper sulfide (Cu2S) NSs as a template. We incorporated Zn(II) and Sn(IV) ions into the crystal lattice of Cu2S NSs retaining the 2D shape via controlled cation exchange reactions. The reaction protocol allows the achievement of the desired elemental composition of the NSs by varying the composition of the precursors. CZTS NSs with a large planar area exhibit a nearly temperature and frequency independent dielectric constant (>6.1) with a low dielectric loss over broad temperature and frequency ranges which makes the system an effective 2D dielectric material. The template based cation exchange reaction protocol provides a guideline to obtain phase-pure CZTS by avoiding the secondary phases often associated with the colloidal synthesis routes. This work demonstrates the realization of 2D quaternary dielectric non-oxide semiconductors composed of purely earth abundant elements for miniaturized energy storage devices using flexible solution processed routes.
Introduction
The dielectric property of a material is an important parameter for energy storage applications.1,2 Materials with robust dielectric properties are the key components of capacitors, which are vastly used in computing systems, numerous electronic and electrical devices.3 Dielectric capacitors store electrical energy via dielectric polarization and release stored energy for required uses. Hence, development of nanocrystals (NCs) with robust dielectric features is the need of capacitive devices for miniaturized electronics. However, a major technical barrier for capacitive devices at the nanoscale is associated with the leakage current arising from the tunneling of electrons. For example, well-known silicon oxide layers of ∼2 nm thickness are prone to a high leakage current.4 Hence, developing ultrathin NCs with a high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss and broad temperature and frequency stability would be suitable for nanoscale storage devices. Two-dimensional (2D) nanocrystals (NCs) are of pronounced interest owing to the large planar area with narrow thickness. As a consequence, unique physical, optical and electronic properties have been realized from 2D NCs.5–10 Besides graphene,5,6 a variety of 2D NCs such as metal sulfides,10–13 transition metal dichalcogenides,14 transition metal carbides,15 layered metal oxides16 and layered double hydroxides17 have been reported, which show promise in optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing, energy storage and conversion applications.11–13,18–22 Recently, 2D ultrathin binary metal sulphide NCs have been reported which exhibit superior dielectric properties at the nanoscale.23 Therefore, it would be interesting to design heavy metal free ultrathin multinary sulphide 2D materials composed of environment friendly earth abundant elements for dielectric applications. The quaternary copper chalcogenide alloy, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), is an important emerging absorber material with a high optical absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1) and direct band gap (1.45 eV to 1.51 eV).24,25 Therefore, a novel synthetic strategy to prepare ultrathin phase-pure planar 2D CZTS NSs with the desired composition and superior dielectric properties may be appealing for energy storage applications.
A number of factors such as difficulty in producing single-phase CZTS without a secondary phase, stoichiometric control, and impurities are detrimental for opto-electronic properties of CZTS. Simultaneous control of the crystal phase, stoichiometry and shape of the CZTS NCs is challenging, because multiple precursors having different reactivities lead to poor control over the nucleation and growth of the quaternary system. The formation of secondary phases during crystal growth often prevents the colloidal synthesis of high-quality CZTS NCs. Different approaches for controlling the shapes and structures of CZTS NCs lead to variations in the quality and viability for their possible use in various optoelectronic devices.26–34 Zhang et al. reported synthesis of 12 nm thick kesterite CZTS nanoplates by the reaction of covellite-phase CuS nanoplates with zinc 2,4-pentanedionate monohydrate and tin(IV) chloride bis(2,4-pentanedionate) at a temperature of 260 °C.35 Swihart et al. reported on the synthesis of kesterite CZTS nanoplatelets with an average size of ∼50 nm using covellite CuS nanoplatelet as templates via an intermediate copper–tin–sulfide nanoplatelet at 160 °C.36 Despite the breakthroughs in controlling the shapes of the CZTS NCs, a colloidal synthesis route of designing ultrathin 2D CZTS nanosheets (NSs) with a large dimension has not been reported to date.35,36
Here we report a facile approach to synthesize ultrathin phase-pure 2D CZTS NSs with a large planar area using Cu2S NSs as a template. An in situ partial cation exchange reaction replaces Cu(I) with Zn(II) and Sn(IV) in the copper sulfide crystal lattice. The 2D morphology of pristine Cu2S NSs is preserved during the cation exchange reaction. We studied the compositional tunability that controls the cation stoichiometry during the conversion of Cu2S NSs into CZTS NSs. A temperature and frequency independent dielectric constant (ε′ > 6.1) with a small dielectric loss (δ < 0.03 at 350 K) and high TCε′ (600 at 300 K) over a broad range suggests robust dielectric features of the 2D CZTS NSs. The capability to synthetically access phase-pure ultrathin CZTS NSs with controlled morphologies, compositions and robust dielectric features could be useful to realize potential nanoscale energy storage devices.
Results and discussion
The cation exchange method is a promising and versatile chemical transformation technique for designing NCs with a well-controlled composition, shape and crystal structure.37 Partial cation exchanges of binary NCs are well developed and can yield a wide range of alloyed structures with homogeneous distribution of elements by preserving the pristine anion lattices.37,38 Lesnyak et al. reported 20 nm wide alloyed CZTSeS nanoplatelets by an in situ cation exchange reaction of Cu2SeS nanoplatelets.32 They also reported copper indium zinc sulfide (CIZS) NCs via a sequential partial cation exchange of Cu2S NCs with In3+ and Zn2+ ions, which led to a broad tuning of photoluminescence.39 Cu2ZnGeSSe nanosheets of ∼5 nm thickness have been reported via a cation exchange approach using pre-synthesized Cu2Se nanosheets as a template.40 The cation exchange method also prevents the possibility of separated nucleation events of the corresponding binary and ternary compounds. We synthesized CZTS NSs through an in situ cation exchange reaction using Cu2S NSs as a template. First, Cu2S NSs have been prepared from the reaction of copper(I) chloride with oleic acid (OA), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) at 240 °C (see the Methods for details). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Cu2S NSs after 30 min of the reaction annealing time shows polygonal NSs with a size of ∼500 nm (Fig. 1a). The sizes of the Cu2S NSs can be controlled by varying the reaction annealing time. Increasing the annealing time resulted in well-defined faceted NSs with a larger planar area. At a lower annealing time of 10 min, stacked Cu2S NSs with a size of ∼200 nm can be obtained (Fig. S1a†). These smaller NSs grow into a polygonal shape with ∼700 nm size after 60 min of the reaction annealing time (Fig. S1b†).

There exist a variety of methods for the preparation of highly monodisperse copper sulfide NCs with different shapes e.g. spherical particles,41 hexagonal prisms,42 nanorods,43 or 2D nanoplates.35,44,45 Recently, hexagonal shaped covellite CuS nanoplates with an average plane length of 150 nm and thickness of about 4.8 nm prepared by the reaction of CuI–oleylamine with S–oleylamine complexes have been reported.35 The reaction of CuS nanoplates with zinc 2,4-pentanedionate monohydrate and tin(IV) chloride bis(2,4-pentanedionate) at high temperature (260 °C) leads to CZTS nanoplates.35 Interestingly, the reported CZTS nanoplates are of 12 nm thickness with a planar size of 150 nm, and are around three times thicker than the parental CuS nanoplates.35
Specific ligand combinations allow us to produce pristine large area ultrathin copper sulfide NSs. In our reaction, TOPO plays the key role in controlling the 2D shape of the Cu2S NCs. We have obtained irregular shaped NCs without using TOPO in the reaction medium (Fig. S2a and b†). On the other hand, the reaction results in smaller NSs with a lamellar structure in the presence of TOPO, however, in the absence of OA in the reaction medium (Fig. S2c and d†). We anticipate that TOPO forms a lamellar mesophase with CuCl and serves as a template for the formation of planar Cu2S NSs in a similar way of wurtzite CdSe NS formation.46 High resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of the Cu2S NSs prepared by 30 min annealing, exhibits predominant {002} lattice planes with a d-spacing of 0.34 ± 0.02 nm corresponding to the hexagonal crystal structure of bulk Cu2S (JCPDS # 840209) (Fig. 1b). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image also reveals a hexagonal crystal structure (inset, Fig. 1b). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared Cu2S NSs by 30 min annealing can be indexed mostly to the high chalcocite phase whose lattice parameters are compatible with the hexagonal phase (Fig. 1c).39
We have used the cation exchange method to prepare CZTS NSs from Cu2S NSs as a template. For the cation exchange reaction, we have transferred the as-prepared Cu2S NS suspension obtained after 30 min of the reaction annealing time to the Zn and Sn containing precursor solution and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 2 hours (Methods for details). The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra revealed that the incorporation of zinc and tin into Cu2S NSs has greatly altered the optical properties (Fig. 1d). Pristine Cu2S NSs exhibit broad absorption from the visible to NIR region, which is attributed to the oscillation of charge carriers, holes in this case associated with the Cu vacancies, created via oxidation processes.32 In contrary, the CZTS NSs exhibited absorption mostly in the visible region. The band gap of CZTS NSs is calculated to be ∼1.5 eV using a Tauc plot (Fig. S3†).24
TEM investigation of the CZTS NCs reveals 2D NSs with an average lateral length of ∼500 nm, which are similar in dimension to the pristine Cu2S NSs (Fig. 2a). Thus the size of the parental NSs is preserved in the product CZTS NSs since the anionic framework in Cu2S remains unaffected during the cation exchange reaction. However, the corners of CZTS NSs are modified in comparison to the original Cu2S NSs possibly because of the etching event by the ligands at the edges.35 A low contrast difference between the CZTS NSs and the background of lacey carbon of the TEM grid (Fig. 2a) and Moiré interference patterns obtained from the overlapped area indicate the narrow thickness of the NSs (Fig. S4†). We carried out quantitative composition analyses using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in TEM, which shows a ratio of ∼2:1:1:4 for Cu:Zn:Sn:S (Fig. 2b). The EDS observation reveals that the Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratio is around ∼1.0. Furthermore, we have prepared the ink of the 2D NSs by exchanging the OA and oleylamine (OlAm) with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) for thin film deposition on solid substrates by solution processed routes (Fig. S5 and S6†).

The peak positions are matched with the peaks from the literature.30,31 Black vertical lines represent the simulated XRD pattern of wurtzite CZTS.30,31 Inset: model crystal structure of the wurtzite phase. (e) Raman spectrum of CZTS NSs. (f) Tapping mode AFM image of the NSs. Inset: height profiles obtained from the image. Blue and green lines show single and double layers. 
HRTEM of the CZTS NSs shows excellent crystallinity (Fig. 2c and S7†) with well-resolved lattice planes with an interplanar spacing of 0.33 ± 0.02 nm corresponding to the (100) planes of the bulk wurtzite CZTS crystal structure.30,31 FFT analysis of a single NS shows sets of diffraction spots corresponding to the (010), (100), and (10) planes of wurtzite CZTS (inset of Fig. 2c). Although the kesterite phase of CZTS is thermodynamically stable, wurtzite CZTS in the present case resulted owing to the cation exchange within the anionic framework.26 Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the CZTS NSs (Fig. S8†) further confirm the wurtzite crystal structure with predominant (100), (110) and (103) diffraction planes of the wurtzite CZTS structure.30,31
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows reflections corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (113), and (112) planes of the hexagonal CZTS structure (Fig. 2d), which match well with those of the previously reported CZTS wurtzite structure.30,31 Interestingly, morphologies of the NSs contribute to the observed intensities of diffraction peaks, especially for the (002) peak.30 Since the NSs are highly oriented on the substrate, an intense (002) reflection indicates preferential growth along the 〈001〉 direction. The XRD pattern of the NSs matches well with the SAED pattern and HRTEM analyses, confirming the phase purity of NSs in the wurtzite crystal structure. Wurtzite CZTS can be considered as the derivative of wurtzite ZnS.30 Therefore, in the wurtzite CZTS crystal structure, sulfur anions remain in hexagonal close packed arrangements with Cu(I), Zn(II) and Sn(IV) cations randomly (inset of Fig. 2d). The Raman spectrum shows peaks at 258 cm−1 and 332 cm−1, respectively, which are corroborated with the bulk wurtzite CZTS (Fig. 2e).47 The broadening of Raman peaks can be attributed to the phonon confinement within the ultrathin NSs.48 Notably, there are no sharp peaks corresponding to ZnS (351 cm−1and 274 cm−1), SnS2 (315 cm−1), and Cu3SnS4 (318 cm−1, 348 cm−1 and 295 cm−1) crystal phases which further confirms the phase purity of CZTS NSs.49 The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image shows a flat morphology of the NSs (Fig. 2f). We have estimated a thickness of ∼4.5 nm of a single NS from the height profile (inset of Fig. 2f) including OA/OlAm layers on the top and bottom surfaces. Overlapped bi-layer NSs show a thickness of ∼9 nm indicating uniform thickness distribution of the NSs. The upright geometric chain length of OA/OlAm is ∼2 nm. However, one would not expect a perfect upright configuration when OA/OlAm is adsorbed on the surfaces of the NSs. We have estimated the actual thickness of the inorganic core of the NSs by subtracting the geometric height of the capping ligands, which reveals <2 nm thickness of the inorganic core. For further confirmation of the thickness, we have also performed AFM on the ligand exchanged CZTS NSs, where OA/OlAm ligands were replaced by a comparatively small length ligand MPA (molecular length is ∼0.6 nm). The AFM measurements suggest a thickness of ∼3.3 nm including the top and bottom layers of MPA. These measurements further confirm the actual thickness of the CZTS NSs to be ∼2 nm (Fig. S9†).
We have carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate the oxidation states of the constituent elements within the NSs. A survey spectrum of the as-synthesized NSs identifies the presence of Cu, Zn, Sn, S and C (Fig. S10†). The high-resolution spectra of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d, and S 2p are measured to determine the oxidation states of the constituent elements (Fig. S11†). The XPS spectrum of the Cu 2p state shows doublet peaks at 931.8 eV (2p3/2) and 951.6 eV (2p1/2) with a peak separation of 19.8 eV, which are supportive of the presence of the Cu(I) state in the NSs (Fig. S11a†).50 The peaks of Zn 2p appear at binding energies of 1021.3 eV and 1044.4 eV, respectively, (Fig. S11b†), which can be assigned to Zn(II) with a peak splitting of 23.1 eV.39,51 The Sn(IV) state was confirmed from the peaks located at 486.2 eV and 494.6 eV along with its characteristic peak separation of 8.4 eV (Fig. S11c†).51 The sulfur spectrum can be assigned to the presence of sulfides at binding energies of 161.3 eV and 162.6 eV of a doublet with a separation of 1.3 eV (Fig. S11d†).50,51 All these characterization techniques univocally suggest the phase purity of CZTS NSs.
Evidently, the Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratio significantly influences the qualities of CZTS NCs.52 We observed incorporation of a larger amount of Zn2+ ions compared to Sn4+ ions in the presence of OlAm during the cation exchange reactions. Limited incorporation of Sn4+ ions possibly occurs due to the lower reactivity of the Sn-precursor (Sn–OlAm complex) compared to that of the Zn-precursor (Zn–OlAm complex).32 In addition, Zn2+ has an ionic radius comparable to the Cu+ ion with 0.6 Å for both Zn2+ and Cu+ ions for the coordination number 4 and 0.74 Å and 0.77 Å for the coordination number 6, respectively. This facilitates incorporation and accommodation of Zn2+ ions into the crystal lattice of Cu2S. On the other hand, Sn4+ ions with a smaller radius exhibit larger charge density, which restricts their diffusion within the Cu2S crystal lattice. Hence, Zn2+ ions replace Cu+ ions more efficiently than Sn4+ ions. Therefore, to achieve equivalent content of Zn and Sn within CZTS NSs, an excess Sn-precursor is required in comparison to the Zn-precursor (Methods for synthesis details).
The control of the elemental composition in CZTS has been a topic of interest.53,54 Our attempt to synthesise CZTS NSs via a one pot colloidal synthesis route using the 2:1:1 mole ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn resulted in Sn doped Cu2S NSs (Fig. S12†). In the cation exchange reaction, the selection of the cationic sources and ligands is important as they play a crucial role in the resultant cationic composition (Table S1†). Though initially we started our experiments with zinc acetate, zinc chloride and tin chloride as Zn and Sn precursors, respectively, we later observed that the elemental composition of Zn and Sn is more controllable with the precursors zinc acetylacetonate [Zn(acac)2] and tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride [Sn(acac)2Cl2] (Table S1†). The cation exchange reaction with equal amounts of Zn and Sn salts (Cu:Zn:Sn = 1:0.5:0.5) in the presence of DDT, yielded a Zn-deficient and Cu and Sn rich composition of the NSs since the Zn–DDT complex reacted slowly at lower temperature (Fig. S13†). However, use of OlAm instead of DDT resulted in a Zn-rich and Cu and Sn deficient composition of the NSs (Fig. S14†). Evidently, OlAm binds strongly with Sn owing to its larger charge density thereby reducing the reactivity of the Sn precursors in comparison to the Zn precursors. Therefore, to obtain the Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratio around ∼1, we varied the Zn and Sn precursor amounts selectively using OlAm as the ligand. Finally, we have obtained the stoichiometry of 2:1:1:4 for Cu:Zn:Sn:S using an initial mole ratio of the precursors of Cu:Zn:Sn ∼1:0.08:0.8 in the cation exchange reaction (Fig. 2b). Our facile synthesis route suggests that the composition of the resulting CZTS NSs can be tuned by varying the amount of the precursors in the cation exchange reaction for optimization of the materials properties.
Along with the absorption coefficient and charge transport, the dielectric property is also another important parameter in photovoltaics since the exciton binding energy is inversely proportional to the square of the dielectric constant.55 A high dielectric material will eventually cause low exciton binding energy and subsequently high power conversion efficiency by enhancing the open-circuit voltage (VOC). However, a material having a high dielectric constant may not result in a robust solar cell; however, it could be promising as an energy storage material. In order to explore the CZTS NSs as a layered dielectric material, we have measured the dielectric properties in a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) configuration (Fig. S15†). Two identical flat circular indium (In) discs with a cross-sectional area of ∼1 mm2 were used as electrodes. The CZTS NS dispersions in chloroform were drop-cast on the In discs and then sandwiched to form a parallel-plate capacitor MIM configuration. The dielectric measurements were performed within the temperature range of 20–350 K over the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz using an HP Agilent 4194A impedance analyzer. The temperature dependency of ε′ at different frequencies shows a great stability over a broad temperature range (∼6.1 at 10 K and ∼7.1 at 350 K for 1 kHz frequency). We have observed low frequency dispersion over a broad range of temperatures (Fig. 3a). A low dielectric loss below 0.004 at low temperature (10 K) for frequencies up to 500 kHz is evidenced (Fig. 3b). The dielectric loss increases by one order of magnitude to ∼0.03 at 350 K for 100 kHz frequency; however, it remains within acceptable limits of applications even at the elevated temperature.56

(b) Plot of dielectric loss versus temperature at different frequencies. (c) Dielectric constant versus frequency plots at different temperatures. (d) Dielectric loss versus frequency plots at different temperatures. 
The dielectric loss dispersion in the range of 265–315 K indicates thermally activated relaxation in the NSs, which was earlier observed for other potential dielectric materials.57 A stable temperature coefficient of the dielectric constant (TCε′, 80 ppm K−1) is obtained over a wide temperature range 10–210 K (Fig. 3a, inset), which is comparable to H2CuTcO6 exhibiting one of the lowest TCε′ of all single component bulk materials.58 We have obtained a TCε′ of +600 ppm K−1 at 300 K for 100 kHz frequency, which is superior than that of most of the established dielectric materials (Table S2†).23,56–58
We have not observed appreciable dielectric relaxation in the frequency dependency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) of ε′ at different temperatures (Fig. 3c). Higher ε′ is obtained at a low frequency range which decreases in a higher frequency regime. At ∼100 kHz, ε′ eventually becomes frequency independent. The dielectric loss remains within 0.01 at 280 K for 100 kHz; however, it increases at higher temperatures in the low-frequency domain (Fig. 3d).56 Dielectric loss (<0.12) is extremely stable above 100 kHz for all measured temperatures. A temperature and frequency stable dielectric constant over a wide range suggests unique material properties of CZTS NSs.
We carried out impedance spectroscopy considering both the intrinsic (grains) and extrinsic (grain boundary or interfacial polarization) effects to elucidate the origin of the dielectric properties. Nyquist plots for all frequency ranges at different temperatures show different arcs of semicircles starting from the origin (Z′, Z′′ ≈ 0), which rules out any significant contribution from the contact resistance (Fig. 4a). The impedance semicircles become smaller with increasing temperature. Complex impedance spectra are analyzed considering an equivalent circuit having two parallel combinations of resistance (R) and capacitance (C) connected in a series (inset, Fig. 4a). The R1, CPE1 is associated with the grain while the R2, CPE2 is associated with the grain boundary. The experimental curves are fitted employing complex nonlinear curves to extract the contributions of the grain and grain boundary (ESI, Table S3†).

Our measurements reveal near ideality showing α ∼ 1 to 0.97 for the  component, where α measures the extent of non-ideality and α = 1 represents the ideal capacitor behavior.59,60 However, a deviation of α in the range of ∼0.87 to 0.97 was found for the  component. Since the arc in the impedance plot due to the grain occurs in a higher frequency range than the grain boundary,61 we attribute  to the grains while the  is attributed to the grain boundary. Since the inorganic core of the NSs is passivated with organic ligands (OA/OlAm), we considered the inorganic core NSs as grains and the terminal organic surfaces of the NSs as the grain boundaries. The intrinsic contribution  originates from the inorganic core 2D NSs. The surface boundaries of 2D NSs with a large lateral area result in higher NS-ligand bonds at the surfaces, which may contribute to the extrinsic effects .62 The other origin of extrinsic effects may be related to the sandwiched pattern or random stacking of 2D NSs within the measured devices, which creates internal barrier layer capacitance.56 To shed light on the conduction through the NSs, we have measured the activation energies for conduction of grains and grain boundaries. The activation energies for conduction of grains (0.43 eV) and grain boundaries (0.24 eV) are different suggesting lower potential barriers for the conduction process through the grain boundaries (Fig. 4b).23 We have found the activation energies for the relaxation processes of grains and the grain boundary to be 0.34 eV and 0.31 eV, respectively (Fig. 4c). The relaxation time constant appears to be in the order of 10−8 to 10−9 s.23 The activation energies for conduction and relaxation processes remain in the same order implying that both conduction and relaxation processes originate from the same intrinsic effect following the same mechanism. The AC conduction activation energies decrease at higher temperatures with an increase in the frequencies (Fig. S16†).63 This confirms that the applied field frequency improves the electronic hoping between the localized states. The activation energies follow the Arrhenius law with Ea ∼ 0.41 eV, which is closer to Ea obtained from the intrinsic part  indicating the intrinsic grain response (Fig. S16†). Our impedance analyses indicate that dielectric responses originate mostly from the grains of the 2D NSs.
Conclusion
In summary, ultrathin and phase-pure quaternary 2D CZTS NSs have been synthesized using partial cation exchange of binary Cu2S NS templates. The dimension of the pristine Cu2S NS templates can be altered by controlling the reaction parameters, which can eventually tune the dimension of the resultant CZTS NSs. The cation exchange protocol reported here leads to a large planar morphology with control over the morphology and crystallinity of the resulting NSs. Our template based approach circumvents the secondary products often associated during synthesis of quaternary NCs. We have shown a convenient approach for fine-tuning the cationic ratio within the NSs which enables us to fabricate the NSs with desired compositions. Our dielectric measurements establish for the first time CZTS NSs as a potential dielectric material with extraordinary temperature stability and low dielectric loss. The large planar area and robust dielectric properties depict unique features of the CZTS NSs as a potent dielectric material for energy storage applications. The formation of ink of CZTS NSs promises large scale thin film deposition using spray coating or ink jet printing on flexible substrates. In general, the results presented here show prospects to develop CZTS ink formulations from solution processed routes. The synthesis method developed here would be a promising approach which can also be extended for the synthesis of similar multinary compounds with desired phases, morphologies, and tunable compositions.

Synthesis of Cu2S NSs
The synthesis was performed using a standard Schlenk line technique. First, a Cu-precursor solution was prepared, 1 millimole (mmol) of CuCl (100 mg) was mixed with 4 mmol of OA (∼1.3 mL) and 6 mL of ODE in a three-neck round-bottom flask and the mixture was degassed under vacuum (pressure of 2–5 × 10−2 Torr) and vigorous stirring at 120 °C for 30 minutes. CuCl completely dissolved forming a clear blue solution. Afterward, the flask was cooled and 1.2 g TOPO (4 mmol) and 1 mL DDT (4 mmol) were added. The reaction flask was then filled with nitrogen and quickly heated to 240 °C (takes ∼10 min to reach the temperature). The color changed from whitish to orange to brown to black. The reaction mixture was kept at 240 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature.
Synthesis of CZTS NSs
The CZTS NSs were prepared by an in situ cation exchange reaction. At first the Zn and Sn precursor solution was prepared taking the salts in different mole ratios. In a typical reaction, to obtain the equivalent content of Zn and Sn within CZTS NSs, 0.08 mmol of Zn(acac)2 (21 mg) and 0.8 mmol of Sn(acac)2Cl2 (310 mg) were mixed with 1 mL of OlAm (∼3 mmol) and 6 mL of ODE in a three-neck round-bottom flask and the mixture was degassed under vacuum (pressure of 10−3 Torr) and vigorous stirring at 120 °C for 30 minutes. The zinc and tin salts were completely dissolved forming a clear orange solution. The flask was cooled. For the cation exchange, the crude reaction mixture of Cu2S NSs was used without further purification. The previously prepared whole Cu2S NS reaction products and ∼2 mL of TOP were added to the zinc and tin precursor dispersion. The temperature of the mixture was raised to 80 °C and kept for 2 hours. After cooling, the reaction product was purified by centrifugation of the crude reaction mixture with subsequent dissolving of the precipitate in chloroform/toluene. The NS solution was then washed 2–3 times by adding ethanol, precipitating NSs by centrifugation and re-dissolving them in chloroform/toluene.
Ligand exchange and phase transfer of CZTS NSs
The as-synthesized CZTS NSs (dispersed in organic solvents like chloroform, toluene, etc.) are exchanged with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) to obtain CZTS NS ink in water. First, 30 mg of hydrophobic CZTS NSs (TOPO, OlAm and OA capped) were dissolved in 3 mL of chloroform with stirring. The aqueous solution of MPA (1 mL MPA + 0.5 mL water + 0.5 mL methanol) was prepared and the pH of the MPA solution was adjusted to greater than 10 by adding 40% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. This MPA solution (pH > 10) was then added drop-wise to the CZTS NS solution in chloroform under vigorous stirring. Separation of two distinct layers of chloroform and CZTS NSs was observed upon stopping the stirring. The CZTS NSs were separated by centrifugation and washed two times with chloroform to remove exchanged ligands. The CZTS NSs were further dispersed in water and precipitated with acetone to remove excess MPA. Finally the resulting CZTS NSs were dispersed in water to form ink.
Characterization
Absorption spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the purified samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) incident radiation. A scanning rate of 0.02° per second in the 2θ range was employed. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images, HRTEM images and EDS spectra were recorded using an ultrahigh-resolution field emission gun (UHR-FEG) TEM instrument (model JEM 2100 F, JEOL) with a 200 kV electron source. Specimens of the samples were prepared by dropping a purified NS solution in chloroform onto a carbon-coated gold grid and then drying the grid in air. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed using an Oxford MFP on mica sheets. Raman spectra were collected at room temperature using an Ar-ion laser of wavelength 632 nm using a Horiba-JobinYvon (model T64000) Raman spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on an Omicron NanoTechnology (Serial no. 0571) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer by drop casting the NS solution on glass slides.
Device fabrication and characterization
The as-synthesized CZTS NSs were sandwiched within two identical flat circular indium discs in a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) configuration. NSs suspended in chloroform (100 mg mL−1) were drop-cast over two identical flat circular indium (In) discs with a cross-sectional area of ∼1 mm2 and then sandwiched to form a parallel-plate capacitor configuration. Dielectric measurements were performed using these indium electrodes within the temperature range of 20–350 K over the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz using an HP Agilent 4194A impedance analyzer.
