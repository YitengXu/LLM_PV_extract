    AbstractA solid organic ionic crystal, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII), was employed as a charge transfer intermediate (CTI) to fabricate all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In addition, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were incorporated into the CTI as the extended electron transfer materials (EETM), which can reduce charge diffusion length and serve simultaneously as catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of I3−. An all-solid-state DSSC with this hybrid SWCNT-EMII achieved a higher cell efficiency (1.88%), as compared to that containing bare EMII (0.41%). To further improve the cell efficiency, we utilized 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine (PMII), which acts simultaneously as a co-charge transfer intermediate and crystal growth inhibitor. The binary CTI (EMII mix with PMII) is in the form of solid as the weight percentage of PMII reaches 60%, at which a smoother surface morphology for the binary CTI is observed. The highest cell efficiency (3.49%) was obtained using a hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI. At-rest durability of the DSSC with the hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI was also studied and found to be far superior to that of a cell with an organic solvent electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and laser-induced photo-voltage transient were used to substantiate the results.
1. Introduction
Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as highly efficient and low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells.1,2 However, presence of organic liquid electrolytes in traditional DSSCs has some problems such as a lower long-term stability and a need for hermetic sealing due to the leakage and evaporation of the organic solvent. Therefore, solidification and quasi-solidification of DSSCs have been intensely studied with various approaches, such as using of p-type inorganic semiconductors,3–5 organic hole conducting materials,6–9 ionic gel electrolytes having a polymer or a gelator,10–13 and of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes containing dispersed nano-components.14–19 In these cases, imperfect filling of the dye-adsorbed porous TiO2 film by p-type inorganic semiconductors or polymers has resulted in poor efficiency for the cells. Moreover, the carrier diffusion length was limited in the case of conducting polymers due to their low conductivity. Although IL electrolytes solidified with nano-components can reduce leakages, it is not satisfactory, because they still contain some volatile components, e.g., 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) or the sublimate, iodine. Zhao et al. reported a solid-state DSSC utilizing imidazolium-type ionic crystal as transfer layer, and obtained a good cell efficiency of 3.1% under one sun irradiation by adopting 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate as a crystal growth inhibitor, lithium bis-trifluoro-methanesulfonylimide as a charge transport enhancer, and TBP as a carrier recombination inhibitor.20 As shown in their work, the cell efficiency remained 60% of the initial value after 30 days at room temperature. Besides, Ikeda et al. also constructed a solid-state DSSC with a poly(N-vinyl-carbazole) hole transporter mediated by an alkali iodide. They reached a cell efficiency of 2.0% under one sun irradiation, but without the incorporation of volatile components (TBP, iodine) in their devices.21
This paper presents the fabrication of high efficiency all-solid-state DSSCs with a hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI, consisting of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine (PMII), without the addition of iodine and TBP. This research assumes importance considering the 3.49% efficiency for the iodine-free all-solid-state DSSC and its unfailing stability in its preliminary observations, because stability is one of the two essential criteria for a good DSSC, other being the efficiency. The advantage of this device with respect to the hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI lies also in the fact that both ionic liquids and the SWCNTs were considered to be environmentally friendly. Thus, this kind of composite electrolyte is suitable for application in DSSCs.
2. Experimental
Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetical grade), iodine (I2, synthetical grade), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (PMII) were obtained from Merk, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) was obtained from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.); 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) was purchased from Acros; Ti(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, >98%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), ethanol (99.5%), neutral cleaner, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%) were obtained from Aldrich. The single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, >90%, specific surface area: >300 m2 g−1, diameter: 2 nm, length: 5–15 μm) were supplied from Scientech Corporation (Taipei, Taiwan).
The hybrid SWCNT-binary CTIs were prepared by mixing the solid powder (SWCNTs) and the binary ILs (PMII and EMII) mentioned above in a weight ratio of 1:9. At the same time, ACN was added to the composite to improve the mixing, and was removed on a hot plate at a temperature of 90 °C. The thermal stability of each component in the composite electrolyte was characterized by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TGA-7, Perkin-Elmer). The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC, Q20, TA instruments) was used to observe the variations of the binary CTI with various compositions. The morphology of the film was obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI ultra-high resolution FE-SEM with low vacuum mode, Nova NanoSEM 230). As for the organic solvent electrolyte, a mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL, Fluka) was used.
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 15 Ω sq.−1, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP (0.084 g) in ethanol (10 ml) for obtaining a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the conductive hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI. A 10 μm-thick film of TiO2 (Ti-Nanoxide T20/SP, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was coated, by the doctor blade method, onto the treated conducting glass, which was patterned to contain pieces of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 to be cut latter. The TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) in ACN and tBA (volume ratio of 1:1) at room temperature for 24 h. After dye-adsorption, a 25 μm-thick surlyn (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was coated on the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and attached by heating. The hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI was then put onto the dye-sensitized TiO2 film at 90 °C to ensure that the ILs can penetrate well into the porous structure and remove the residual ACN. The TiO2 electrode with the hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI was assembled with a platinum-sputtered conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq.−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) by clamps, and the edges were sealed by an UV glue (Optocast 3410 40 K GEN2, Alexander Jewels Co., LTD.).
The surface of the DSSCs was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan). The incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si Cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The thickness of TiO2 film was determined using a surface profilometer (Sloan Dektak 3030). EIS were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSCs and 10 mV, respectively, between the counter electrode and the FTO-TiO2-dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition. The impedance spectra were analyzed by an equivalent circuit model.22,23
The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained at the short-circuit condition. The light source was emitted from a 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel Instrument, model 6266) equipped with a water-based IR filter (Oriel Instrument, model 6123NS), and focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell under test. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined bleow, IPCE(λ) = 1240(JSC/λψ)(1)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and ψ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310). The photovoltage transients of the assembled devices were recorded with a digital oscilloscope (model LT322, LeCroy, USA). Pulsed laser excitation was applied by a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (model Quanta-Ray GCR-3-10, Spectra-Physics laser) with a 2 Hz repetition rate at 532 nm, and a 7 ns pulse width at half-height. The average electron lifetime could approximately be estimated by fitting a decay of the open-circuit voltage transient with exp(−t τe−1), where t is the time and τe is an average time constant before recombination.
3. Results and discussion
An IL usually has favorable properties from the viewpoint of a DSSC, such as negligible vapor pressure, high thermal stability, a wide electrochemical potential window, and high ionic conductivity.24–28 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are remarkable materials, which are being widely studied because of their extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties. Considering these aspects, an incombustible and non-volatile hybrid CTI, comprising of EMII and SWCNT, was incorporated into DSSCs for this study (Scheme 1). It is expected that this IL would allow perfect contact at the interface between the dye-coated porous TiO2 and the extended electron transfer material (EETM),18i.e., SWCNT, at a filling temperature of 90 °C.
 Scheme 1  A schematic illustration of the charge transport processes in the DSSC with hybrid SWCNT-EMII. 

Fig. 1a shows the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs using EMII as CTI with or without the incorporation of SWCNTs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. A higher efficiency (1.88%) solid-state DSSC with this hybrid SWCNT-EMII was obtained as compared to that containing a bare EMII (0.41%). This enhancement in the cell performance can be explained by employing the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique to analyze the interfacial resistance in these cells. Fig. 1b shows the EIS data of the DSSCs using EMII as CTI with or without the incorporation of SWCNTs. The corresponding values are listed in Table 1, and the equivalent circuit is illustrated in the inset of the figure. In general, the EIS spectra of an FTO/TiO2/dye/electrolyte/Pt/ITO device show three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The ohmic serial resistance (Rs) corresponds to the overall series resistance. The first and second semicircles correspond to the charge-transfer resistances at the counter electrode (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye/carrier mediator (Rct2), respectively. The third one represents the Warburg diffusion process (Rdiff) of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 1b, hybrid SWCNT-EMII cell has both smaller Rct2 and Rdiff than those of a bare EMII cell. From this analysis, it is clear that the presence of SWCNTs as the EETM facilitates electron transfer from counter electrode to I3− ions; a shorter diffusion length for I3− ions and thereby for I− ions created, which enables the redox couple to work more efficiently than they would in the absence of SWCNTs.

It is well known that electrolyte containing iodide and I2 exists in the form of polyiodides such as I3− or I5− (eqn (2)). An efficient transport of iodide and triiodide in the electrolyte is necessary for good performance of the conventional DSSC because the oxidized state of the dye (dye+) should be reduced by I− ions efficiently after the electrons from the excited state of the dye are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 under illumination (eqn (3)). Moreover, the electrons accumulated at the counter electrode through the external circuit will lead to concentration overpotentials for the electrolyte at the counter electrode and to loss of power of the DSSC, if the electrons are not transferred to I3− efficiently (eqn (4)). The reactions are as follows: (2) 3I− + 2dye+ → I3− + 2dye (at dye-sensitized TiO2/CTI)(3) I3− + 2e− → 3I− (at EETM/CTI)(4)
We emphasize that the cell works at high efficiency without the addition of iodide to the CTI in our study. Moreover, we also found that incorporation of I2 is not necessary to drive our device.29 On the contrary, I2 is detrimental in our case as can be seen in Fig. 2, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. Table 2 shows the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs with hybrid SWCNT-EMII containing various amounts of I2. These results demonstrate that the cell works most effectively with an iodine-free composite electrolyte. It is suggested that the iodide anion based ILs provide sufficient I− for the reduction of the oxidized dye under illumination (eqn (3)). Subsequently, I3− can be reduced back to I− at the EETM (eqn (4)).30 Increasing I2 content increases the local concentration of polyiodides in the porous dye-coated TiO2 matrix. It facilitates recombination of injected conduction band electrons with polyiodides, and increases the dark current as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, increasing the I2 content also enhances light absorption even in the visible range by the CTI existing in the porous dye-coated TiO2 matrix. This decreases the light-harvesting of dye molecules.31 Therefore, both VOC and JSC decrease with the increase in the wt% of I2.

To further improve the cell efficiency, we utilized 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine (PMII), which acts simultaneously as a CTI and a crystal growth inhibitor. From Fig. 3a, we can find that EMII and PMII have different colors, bright yellow and deep brown, respectively. With the increase of addition of PMII into EMII (0 to 80 wt%) the binary CTI (EMII mixed with PMII) turns uniformly into brown color. This means that the binary components do not exclude each other even in recrystallized conditions. Besides this, the binary CTI exhibits a solid-like form until the content of PMII is increased to a weight percent of 60%, and a smoother surface morphology of the binary CTI is observed in this case (Fig. 4b). By contrast, the bare EMII shows a rough surface containing some cavities (Fig. 4a). It is known that ionic crystallization would prevent the filling of solid-state electrolyte into the TiO2 porous structure and result in a decrease in photoelectrochemical responses of the device.3–5 Therefore, the inhibition of the crystal growth is expected to improve the cell performance of the solid-state DSSCs. To further investigate the thermal properties of the binary CTI, differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) scans were recorded (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, the melting point (Tm) of the binary CTI (the compositions were the same as those in Fig. 3a) decreases with the increase in the content of PMII, and reaches a weight percent of 60% PMII, close to the room temperature. These results are consistent with the picture of Fig. 3a. Thereby, the excess of PMII addition (80 wt% of PMII) does not exhibit solid-state at room temperature. Besides, we also found that the binary CTI (EMII/PMII = 40/60) with the addition of SWCNTs still has a solid-like form in an oven at 75 °C, which is higher than the melting point of binary CTI composed of EMII/PMII with a weight ratio of 40/60 (Fig. 3b). This implied that the presence of SWCNTs also plays a role of physical gelation for the binary CTI.

Fig. 6b shows the EIS of the DSSCs with hybrid SWCNT-EMII incorporating various amounts of PMII, measured at 100 mW cm−2. Table 3 also gives the corresponding fitting values. Smaller Rct2 and Rdiff. are observed for the solid-state DSSCs containing hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI, as compared to the case without adding PMII; which is consistent with our explanation that the presence of PMII leads to a less crystalline nature of the binary CTI, which penetrates deeper into the TiO2 and enhances the cell performance. At a weight ratio of 40:60 (EMII:PMII), a cell efficiency of 3.49% was achieved; the corresponding incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) reached 50% at 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 7, indicating the beneficial effect of PMII. The enhancement in the efficiency of the solid-state DSSC with PMII, with reference to the efficiency of the best cell without this IL (1.88%), is attributed to the less crystallization nature of the binary CTI, which provides better filling of the solid electrolyte into TiO2 and also higher conductivity for the electrolyte containing I− and I3− ions. In order to better elucidate charge transport and recombination processes within the solid-state DSSCs, the photovoltage transients of the devices with CTI containing bare EMII, hybrid SWCNT-EMII, and hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI (EMII:PMII = 40:60) were measured. When the dye was excited by laser, the photovoltages response in all DSSCs was instantaneous and reached maxima. As shown in Fig. 8, the highest peak photovoltage is found for a DSSC with hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI (EMII:PMII = 40:60), while the smallest value is noted for the bare EMII cell. This indicates that DSSCs in the presence of SWCNTs and crystal inhibitor (PMII) could generate the highest photovoltage under the same light illumination and active areas. The values of electron lifetime (τe) were found to be 0.2, 0.37, and 0.42 ms for CTI containing bare EMII, hybrid SWCNT-EMII, and hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI (EMII:PMII = 40:60), respectively. The increase in τe means that the incorporation of SWCNTs and crystal inhibitor (PMII) not only lower the interfacial charge recombination, but also improve charge transport of EMII-based solid electrolytes.

Fig. 9 shows the TGA traces for each component of the hybrid CTI used in this study. All the traces indicate that there is no weight loss of any component up to 250 °C. This thermal stability is beneficial for fabricating a durable DSSC. Fig. 10 shows the at-rest durability data of the DSSCs with hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI and organic liquid electrolyte. In this experiment, all cells were simultaneously sealed by surlyn and UV glue. The cell efficiency was measured once per day after storing it under dark at room temperature. Efficiencies were normalized to the average value of the preceding five days, because we had noticed that the cell efficiency reaches a stable value at room temperature in about 5 days. As expected, the proposed solid-state DSSCs showed excellent durability when compared with that of the cell with organic liquid electrolyte. It is noticed that the overall cell efficiency of the solid-state DSSC has increased about 1.5%, the overall cell efficiency of the DSSC with organic liquid electrolyte has decreased about 30% after more than 1,000 h, despite the fact that the boiling point of the organic solvent, GBL is 204 °C. These results proved that the all-solid-state DSSC with a hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI should avoid the problem of leakage or evaporation for traditional DSSCs. This study can provide the useful technique for fabrication of the DSSCs without losing their intrinsic performances. This study provides a different approach to prepare solid-state CTI with organic ionic salts having relatively lower melting points (<100 °C) in contrast to inorganic ionic salts mentioned in literature,21 which normally having melting points higher than ca. 300 °C. Our approach has advantage in that CTI can be filled in the porous TiO2 matrix under relatively low heating temperature (says, 90 °C). Another novel concept is also introduced, i.e., the melting point of the CTI is controlled through the adjustment of the composition of the binary CTI; this precludes a molecular design for organic ionic salts.20 At the same time, the charge transport is enhanced and both the carrier recombination and the crystallization of CTI is reduced through the incorporation of hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI, and without the incorporation of any volatile component (TBP, iodine etc).21 The solid-state DSSC in this study shows one of the best cell efficiencies, considering those reported in the literature (Ref. 20: 3.1%, Ref. 21: 2.0%).

Conclusions
Efficient solid-state DSSC was developed using a hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI without the addition of iodine and TBP. A high efficiency (3.49%) solid-state DSSC was achieved with a hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI containing EMII and PMII under AM1.5 full sunlight. It is established that the SWCNTs in the composite electrolyte serves simultaneously as the filler for physical gelation of electrolyte and as the catalyst for electrochemical reduction of I3−. Besides, we also confirmed that PMII serves simultaneously as a crystal growth inhibitor and a co-CTI. The photovoltage transients further confirm that the incorporations of SWCNT and crystal inhibitor (PMII) not only lower the interfacial charge recombination, but also improve the charge transport of EMII-based solid electrolytes. Finally, the stability of DSSC with the hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI is proved to be far superior to that with an organic solvent-based electrolyte. The DSSC with the hybrid SWCNT-binary CTI showed an excellent durability at room temperature for 1,000 h.
