    , Accepted 10th November 2016First published on 10th November 2016AbstractIn this work, ytterbium–erbium co-doped strontium molybdate (SrMoO4, SMO) nanophosphors (NPs), denoted as SMO:Yb/Er, have been successfully prepared. These NPs were then incorporated into TiO2 acceptor films in hybrid solar cells to enhance light harvesting by virtue of an up-conversion process where low energy photons can be converted into high energy photons through multi-photon processes. The results showed that the SMO:Yb/Er single crystal NPs are capable of turning near infrared photons into visible ones that can be easily captured by poly(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7). The results indicate that the electron transfer rate at the PTB7/TiO2 donor/acceptor interface has been boosted sharply from 0.59 to 1.35 × 109 s−1. Consequently, a hybrid solar cell based on SMO:Yb/Er NP-doped TiO2/PTB7 delivers a high power conversion efficiency of up to 3.61%, thus leading to an efficiency enhancement of around 28% as compared to that of the neat PTB7/TiO2 counterpart (2.81%). This work demonstrates a promising approach to engineering efficient photovoltaic devices by taking advantage of the versatility of rare-earth ion doped oxides that function by modifying light in the solar spectrum.
1. Introduction
Utilization of renewable solar energy has continued to receive wide attention and ongoing effort has been intensively invested in solar cells.1–5 However, one of the demerits or bottleneck issues that is limiting the further enhancement of photovoltaic devices is that the solar spectrum has not yet been fully utilized. Since the up-conversion (UC) luminescence of lanthanide (Ln) ions was revealed by Auzel in 1966,6 much more effort has been directed towards rare-earth (RE) phosphors,7–9 which can efficiently convert near infrared (NIR) light into visible light under the influence of low-cost infrared laser diodes (LDs). Among the RE ions, lanthanide ions have been intensively explored because of their great promise in a spectrum of applications, such as in lasers,10 light-harvesting materials in solar devices,11 biological imaging,12 optical thermometry,13 and others.9,14,15 After more than four decades of development, erbium–ytterbium (Er–Yb) UC systems have become the most frequently used energy conversion candidates for red, green and blue (RGB) emissions. In this system, the larger absorption cross section of Yb plays the role of a photo-sensitizer for NIR light to bridge the gap between Yb and Er, which bears a much smaller absorption cross section than Yb, due to the dipole-forbidden nature of intra-4f transitions.16–18 The NIR photo-induced energy can then be actively transported from Yb to Er ions, thus subsequently promoting the electrons of the Er ions in the ground or low-lying energy states to the high-lying excited levels via energy transfer (ET), leading to a higher photon energy conversion.19
Because of their excellent stability and their chemical, thermal and mechanical properties, metal oxides have been deemed as the ideal candidate host materials for rare-earth, in particular lanthanide, UC phosphors, such as ZrO2 and Y2O3. However, in accordance with the energy gap law,20 due to the high phonon energy of oxide materials, which can facilitate the undesired process of non-radiative relaxation from the activator's energy levels, such as Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+, the UC efficiency of lanthanide-doped oxide materials is still low.21–24 Therefore, this area still calls for more work to explore more versatile candidates to meet demands for highly efficient UC metal oxide host materials. Inspired by their excellent luminescent characteristics and unique electronic structures, and also their promising applications in the fields of lasers, luminescent materials and catalysts,25–27etc., the family of metal molybdates has received a lot of attention. Especially, special attention has been paid to strontium molybdate (SrMoO4) owing to its outstanding thermal and chemical stability, water stability and resistance against irradiation damage.28–31
Herein, we have synthesized Er3+ and Yb3+ co-doped strontium molybdate (SrMoO4) NPs for the first time and demonstrated their versatile application in organic/inorganic HSCs, in which TiO2 is used as the electron acceptor because of its photosensitivity, non-toxicity, low-cost and environmental stability, etc.,32–34 and the well-known conducting polymer poly(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7)35 is used as the electron donor. These HSCs are different from polymer solar cells (PSCs), which, as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), have been extensively studied due to their promising advantages including low-cost manufacture, robust and flexible mechanical properties, low-cost raw materials, and light weight, etc.36,37 However, these high performance conjugated polymers tend to photochemically degrade when exposed to light in the presence of water and/or oxygen, limiting the operating lifetime of OPV devices and raising the cost of OPVs as energy sources. In contrast, inorganic/organic hybrid solar cells (HSCs), with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architecture consisting of an organic conjugated polymer as the hole transporter and an inorganic semiconductor as the electron transporter in a photoactive layer, have attracted increasing attention. They have become of great interest to researchers due to the promising potential of exploiting the advantageous properties of both organic polymers and inorganic semiconductors, such as utilizing inexpensive and environmentally compatible raw materials and facile solution-processed manufacturing to enable access to potentially low-cost solar cells. Because of the large energy offset between a conjugated polymer and the inorganic semiconductor TiO2, the power conversion efficiency of HSCs is typically around 3–5%.38,39 One promising approach to increase this is to adjust the energy level alignment by doping with foreign ions. This is the very source of motivation for carrying out this present work. We report the utilization of the UC luminescence properties of Yb–Er ion co-doped nanophosphors (NPs) in hybrid solar cells (HSCs). The application of SrMoO4:Yb–Er single crystal NPs in organic/inorganic HSCs has rarely been explored so far. In addition to the UC luminescence properties and mechanisms of SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs, which exhibit strong visible light UC emissions under LD excitation, the doping effects of SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs including energetic photoexcited charge transfer in bulk-heterojunctions (BHJs) were also revealed. The effects of doping including UC properties and charge transfer dynamics induced by the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs will be studied by assembling novel HSCs based on lanthanide NPs and exploring their corresponding photovoltaic performances.
2. Experimental
2.1 The synthesis of SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs
Strontium molybdate (SrMoO4) NPs were prepared by a simple sol–gel method and were doped with different concentrations of RE ions relative to Sr2+ cations. In detail, the SrMoO4:xYb/1Er (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mol%) NPs were synthesized using a hydrothermal sol–gel approach.19 The pre-calculated amounts of Sr(NO3)2 (Analytical regent, AR), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (AR), (NH4)6Mo7O24 (AR) and Er(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in deionized (DI) water to prepare solutions of particular concentrations, followed by addition of the complexing agent citric acid (AR) to the solutions (the molar ratio of cation to citric acid was 1:1.5). Then, the pH was adjusted to neutral, around 7, using ammonia (AR). Prior to being calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in an ambient atmosphere, the resultant solutions were subjected to stirring for 1 h and subsequent drying in air at 130 °C until transformation into a black bulk. Finally, the products were pressed to flat disks for further spectral analysis. A TiO2 colloid and NP-doped TiO2 were synthesized by the same method used previously.40,41
2.2 Fabrication of HSCs
The optimized SrMoO4:Yb–Er NP doped TiO2 colloid was prepared as done in previous work.42,43 The TiO2 colloid was spin-coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, Hartford Glass Co., USA) to obtain a NP-doped or a bare TiO2 acceptor layer of a particular thickness, followed by sintering in air. Then, the FTO together with the TiO2 film was soaked in poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexy)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) toluene solution (0.15 mM) to load the PTB7 molecules. Next, a PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the BHJ. Finally, by using thermal evaporation, a Pt electrode of about 50 nm thickness was deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer under vacuum conditions.
2.3 Characterization
Phase identification of the prepared powders was performed on a MSAL XD-2/3 powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1540596 nm) at 30 kV and 40 mA and at 1 deg min−1. The morphology and microstructures of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs were examined using a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL Ltd) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were collected to analyze the phases. In addition, the morphology of the titania nanoparticles and the cross-sectional morphologies of the corresponding photovoltaic devices were determined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800).
The device performance of the fabricated HSCs was explored on an Electrochemical Workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA). Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a spectrometer (Bruker Optics 250IS/SM) with an intensified charge coupled device detector (Andor, IStar740). The samples were excited using 120 fs laser pulses at 400 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The time resolution of this experiment was determined to be ∼60 ps. UC emission spectra were recorded using an iHR550 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon) under 976 nm excitation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase and structure characterization
In order to identify the structure and phase of the prepared NPs, XRD and TEM were used to characterize them. The XRD pattern of the SrMoO4:2Yb/1Er NPs as shown in Fig. 1a is in good agreement with the standard diffraction of tetragonal phase strontium molybdate (SrMoO4) as per JCPDS No. 08-0482, in which there is a single tetragonal phase with the cell parameters of a = 5.39, b = 5.39, and c = 12.02 Å, and α = 90°, β = 90° and γ = 90°, and it belongs to the I41/a space group. The RE ions Yb3+ and Er3+ could have been doped into the lattice of the host substrate SrMoO4. On one hand, there is no peak detected for ytterbium and/or erbium oxide, though on the other hand, because Yb3+/Er3+ (0.87 Å/0.89 Å) have relatively closer effective ionic radii and charge quantities to Sr2+ sites (1.18 Å) than to Mo6+ sites (0.59 Å), this would favour the substitution of Sr for Yb/Er ions.

A typical TEM image of the NPs is depicted in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that the average particle size of the prepared uniform crystals ranges from 15 to 30 nm. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 1c indicates that the as-prepared SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs display good single crystallization without appreciable defects. The d-spacings that are estimated from the lattice fringes at atomic resolution are measured as d = 0.55 and 1.21 nm, corresponding to the crystal planes of (1 0 0) and (0 0 1), respectively. This is equivalent to the fact that the lattice spacings of d = 0.2698 and 0.3006 nm correspond to the (2 0 0) and (0 0 4) planes, respectively. Besides, the values of the distance spacings of d1 = 0.55, d2 = 1.21 and d3 = 0.50 nm obtained from the SAED pattern (Fig. 1d) are indexed as the crystal planes of (1 0 0), (0 0 1) and (1 0 1) and are consistent with those obtained from the XRD pattern. That is, d1′ = 0.2698, d2′ = 0.3006 and d3′ = 0.2462 nm, corresponding to the crystal planes (2 0 0), (0 0 4) and (2 0 2), respectively.
3.2 UC luminescence properties

Fig. 2 presents the UC emission spectra of SrMoO4:xYb/Er NPs excited at 976 nm using an incident power of 15 W cm2. The inset illustrates the green emission of the strong UC luminescence of the SrMoO4:2Yb/1Er NPs. As observed from Fig. 2, the intensities of the green (520, 529 and 550 nm) and red emissions (650 and 667 nm) exhibit an increasing trend with the initial loading concentration of Yb ions from 0 to 2 mol%. However, this is followed by a decrease in intensity upon further increasing the concentration to exceed 2 mol%, probably because of exciton quenching.44 The red and green emissions can be attributed to the transition of Er3+ ions, from 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and from 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2, respectively,45 and the intensities have been enhanced by a factor of about 22.2 and 31.7, respectively, at 2 mol% as compared with pure SrMoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs. Therefore, an initial loading concentration of Yb3+ ions at 2 mol% was employed next in this work.
 Fig. 2  Up-conversion emission spectra in SMO:xYb3+/1Er3+ (x = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mol%) NPs under 976 nm LD excitation. 
The enhancement of green (Igreen) and red (Ired) emission intensities as a function of the initial loading concentration of Yb3+ is displayed in Fig. 3. Simultaneously, the ratio of Igreen to (Igreen + Ired), denoted by Igreen/(Igreen + Ired), is also presented in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the intensities of both Igreen and Ired increase sharply with Yb3+ loading from 0 to 1 mol% and reach a peak at 2 mol%, followed by a drastic drop. This is probably because of paired or aggregated Yb3+ ions acting as quenchers at higher concentrations of Yb3+.46 With the increase in the concentration of Yb, the ratio firstly increases gradually and then levels off without obvious changes after the optimized concentration of 2 mol%, indicating that the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs favour green UC emissions.

3.3 Up-conversion mechanism of SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs
In order to explore the underlying photophysical mechanism of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs, the intensities of the UC luminescence (Iuc) at varied laser powers (INIR) were measured. Since Iuc is proportional to the n-power of INIR, i.e., Iuc ∝ (INIR)n, in which n is the number of photons needed to populate the high-lying energy levels, the ln–ln relationship of Iucversus INIR was plotted, as is displayed in Fig. 4. The number of photons required for green and red emission is n = 1.86 and n = 1.52, respectively, as derived from the slope of the ln–ln relationship of Iuc ∝ INIR. The values of both ngreen and nred are larger than 1 and are largely approximate to 2, indicating that a two-photon process in the Yb–Er co-doped SrMoO4 NPs is associated with the luminescence emissions.
 Fig. 4  The UC luminescence intensity (Iuc) as a function of the laser power (INIR). 
The proposed UC mechanisms of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs are presented in Fig. 5, in which both ground state absorption (GSA, |2F7/2, 1A1〉 → |2F5/2, 1A1〉) and excited state absorption (ESA, |2F5/2, 1A1〉 → |2F7/2, 1T1〉) are involved. As observed from Fig. 5, the ground state and the intermediate excited state of the photosensitizer Yb3+–MoO42− dimer complex are represented by |2F7/2, 1A1〉 and |2F5/2, 1A1〉, respectively. Meanwhile, the relevant 4 higher excited states are denoted by |2F7/2, T1〉, |2F7/2, 3T2〉, |2F7/2, 1T1〉 and |2F7/2, 1T2〉.19 After excitation at 976 nm, energy is transferred from the sensitizer Yb3+–MoO42− dimer to the relevant higher excited energy states by GSA and ESA processes. Thanks to the excellently matched electronic structures between the sensitizer Yb3+–MoO42− and the activator Er3+, an effective high excited state energy transfer (HESET) plays a dominant role in energy transfer (ET) from the |2F7/2, 3T2〉 state of the Yb3+–MoO42− dimer to the 4F7/2 level of the Er3+ ion. Subsequently, the green and red emissions can occur via multi-phonon relaxations of the lower-lying energy levels (2H11/2/4S3/2 for green emission and 4F9/2 for red emission) to the ground state. This can explain why the intensities have been enhanced sharply after the doping of SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs, as observed from Fig. 3. Likewise, the 4F9/2 level is populated via nonradiative decay from the 4S3/2 level to bridge the ∼3000 cm−1 energy gap between the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels. Such a HESET mechanism can effectively mitigate the disadvantages inherent to the photo-sensitizer such as exchange enhancement and lattice phonon quenching processes, thus resulting in strong visible UC emissions in the Yb–Er co-doped SrMoO4 NPs.

In order to further confirm the UC function of the SrMoO4:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs, the absorbance spectrum of PTB7 along with the PL spectrum of Er3+ and Yb3+ doped SrMoO4 NPs are provided in Fig. 6. The molecular structure of PTB7 is also displayed in Fig. 6a. As observed from Fig. 6b, there exist two absorption peaks located at around 620 and 675 nm for PTB7, respectively, while two closely overlapping peaks that are positioned at 660 and 670 nm, respectively, can be clearly observed from the PL spectrum of the Er3+ and Yb3+ doped SrMoO4 NPs.

When optimizing the concentration of Yb in the NPs, as shown in Fig. 2, the excitation power of the light used was 15 W cm−2 cm, which is much higher than that of a solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2. As the intensity of solar illumination in the NIR region in practice is much lower than that of a laser, the dependence of emission as a function of the excitation density has been explored elsewhere, and indicates that the intensity of PL emission or EQE increases with the increase in excitation power.47 In our work, the intensities of UC luminescence (Iuc) at varied laser powers (INIR) were measured (Fig. 4). It was found that the dependence of the PL intensity on the excitation power ranged from 40 to 570 mW for green emission and from 135 to 570 mW for red emission. This further confirmed that the intensity of PL spectra is proportional to the excitation power. In particular, the UC emission spectra (PL spectra) of the SrMoO4:Yb/Er phosphors under 976 nm NIR laser excitation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 were measured and the results indicated that although the PL intensity has been decreased under the lower laser irradiation, nonetheless, these NPs function well and exhibit identical red and green emission peaks as shown in Fig. 7a.

In a bid to find evidence of their working principle, solar cells with and without SrMoO4:Yb/Er NPs were tested under a 976 nm NIR laser with identical power densities of 15 W cm−2. The J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 7b unambiguously confirm that the NPs rendered the solar cell able to respond under concentrated NIR light, and resulted in a Voc of 0.650 V, a Jsc of 0.699 mA cm−2, a FF of 49%, and thus a PCE of 0.22%, which is much higher than that of the reference solar cell (PTB7/TiO2, 0.03%).
In order to reveal the role that the NPs play in the final spectrum response, EQE measurements were performed as shown in Fig. 7c. Both the EQE spectra with and without NP doping largely resemble the absorption profile of PTB7. However, an obvious broad EQE improvement ranging from 350–700 nm is observed after introducing the SrMoO4:Yb/Er NPs. The enhanced EQE with NP doping throughout the absorption spectrum is consistent with the faster charge transfer rate after the incorporation of NPs. Unfortunately, due to the wavelength limitation of the EQE instrument in the NIR range, we cannot provide explicit evidence of the nanophosphor-induced improvement in the NIR spectrum. However, the UC properties of NPs that can convert NIR photons into red or green ones,48 together with the good light utilization ability of PTB7 in the visible range, will undoubtedly lead to a better performance for the assembled hybrid solar cells based on NP:TiO2/PTB7.
3.4 Photoexcited charge transfer dynamics
Alongside the UC luminescence properties of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs, the charge transfer dynamics at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface also play a key role in the photovoltaic performance of HSCs.49,50 Herein, transient PL spectra of neat PTB7 films, PTB7/TiO2 and SrMoO4:Yb–Er NP doped TiO2/PTB7 BHJs were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 8. The PL spectrum of neat PTB7 presents a long tail, which is greatly quenched after about 1000 ps after interfacing with the acceptor layer, indicating an effective charge transfer at the interface within the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ). In the organic/inorganic BHJ architecture, the excitation of PTB7 molecules after interfacing with electron acceptors results in the dissociation of electron(e)–hole(h) pairs (reaction (1)); afterwards, the separated charge carriers might re-combine together (reaction (2)) or be injected into the electron acceptor via an additional deactivation pathway (reaction (3)): PTB7 + hν →PTB7 (h + e)(1) PTB7 (h + e) → PTB7 + hν′(2) PTB7(e) + SrMoO4:Yb–Er/TiO2 → PTB7 + SrMoO4:Yb–Er/TiO2(e)(3)Bleaching recovery (reaction (3)) is usually accompanied by complicated heterogeneous kinetics and can be well described by a single-exponential function. Therefore, the decay transients in Fig. 8 can be well fitted to a single-exponential decay using eqn (4) in a bid to simulate the photo-generation dynamics, ϕ(t) = δ(t) + Aexp(−t/τ)(4)where δ(t) is the electronic hyperpolarizability and the second term represents the charge transfer, especially for hot electron transfer. The fitted life times for PTB7, PTB7/TiO2 and SrMoO4:Yb–Er NP-doped TiO2/PTB7 are 1658, 840 and 511 ps, respectively, as listed in Table 1. Eqn (5) was used to estimate the average electron transfer rate ket, given by (5)Consequently, the charge transfer rates ket for TiO2/PTB7 and SrMoO4:Yb–Er NP-doped TiO2/PTB7 BHJs were evaluated to be 0.59 × 109 and 1.35 × 109 s−1, respectively. This reveals that faster charge transfer occurs at the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NP-doped TiO2/PTB7 interface, enhanced by almost 130% when compared with that of TiO2/PTB7, which favours electron collection, and so NP-doping might be used to improve the photovoltaic performance of devices.

3.5 Photovoltaic performances of HSCs
The interfacial morphology of organic/inorganic BHJs is crucial to the photovoltaic performances of devices.51 The SEM image of a porous electron acceptor film in Fig. 9a shows that the diameter of TiO2 crystals is about 10–30 nm, which is similar to the particle diameter of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs, thus making the NPs indistinguishable from the TiO2 crystals. Besides, the porous structure of the acceptor film is capable of favouring excellent interfacial contact in the BHJ by trapping the PTB7 molecules in the micro-pores52,53 through intermolecular forces.54–56 In a bid to probe the interface morphology, cross-sectional SEM images of the organic/inorganic BHJ before and after uptaking PTB7 molecules are shown in Fig. 9b and c, respectively, which indicate the intimate architecture and that the individual thickness of the photoactive layer is about 250 nm. The close contact interfacial engineering is vital for effective exciton separation and transfer, and is due to the short diffusion length of the polymer.51Fig. 9d depicts the J–V characteristics of the assembled solar devices based on the different loading amounts of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2 under the simulation of solar light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. The HSCs based on the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs exhibited improved device performances as compared to those without doping with NPs. After gradually increasing the loading amount of the SrMoO4:Yb–Er NPs from 0 wt% to 4.5 wt%, the photovoltaic parameters gradually increased, followed by a decrease when loading exceeded 6.0 wt%. Especially, the short-circuit current density increased from 8.59 at 0 wt% to 9.94 mA cm−2 at 4.5 wt%, but was followed by a drop at 6.0 wt%. Correspondingly, the PCE improved from 2.81% at 0 wt% to 3.61% at 4.5 wt%, which is attributed to doping effects and improved light harvesting of the HSCs. The slight decrease in device performance when exceeding 6 wt% loading of the NPs might be associated with the difficulty of forming a flat film at higher loading amounts, thus leading to the downward current density.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we have successfully doped prepared SrMoO4:xYb/1Er NPs into a mesoporous TiO2 acceptor film. The UC luminescent properties under 976 nm excitation and time-resolved PL luminescence were determined to probe the UC mechanism of the NPs and the charge transfer dynamics at the interface. It was found that energy was transferred from the Yb3+–MoO42− sensitizers to the Er3+ activators and the excited Er3+ ions gave out green and red emissions. In particular, the UC luminescence could be intensified by a HESET mechanism. Besides, because of a two-photon process inherited from doping with SrMoO4:2Yb/1Er NPs, NIR photons have been converted to visible photons, which are re-harvested by PTB7, thus leading to broader light harvesting. Apart from the enhanced harvesting of low-energy photons, the electron transport lifetime was shortened by almost 40% from 840 to 511 ps and, correspondingly, the electron transfer rate has been enhanced by almost 130%, from 0.59 to 1.35 × 109 s−1. Additionally, the PCE of the HSCs was improved from 2.81% for a conventional TiO2/PTB7 device to 3.67% for the SrMoO4:2Yb/1Er-doped TiO2/PTB7 device at 4.5 wt%. This work provides evidence that use of SrMoO4:xYb/1Er NPs as up-conversion phosphor materials has versatile and promising applications in pursuing efficient HSCs by tailoring the absorption cross-section of the solar spectrum and underscores the promising potential of versatile RE phosphors.
