    , Accepted 29th March 2016First published on 29th March 2016AbstractThe tremendous loss of 246 mV in open-circuit voltage (Voc) upon solvent annealing in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM solar cells that has been observed could be recovered by post-annealing. Following solvent annealing, subsequent thermal annealing of the active layer could not achieve full recovery of Voc, which is attributed to minor variation in morphology, crystalline behavior and absorption edge. However, after completing fabrication of the entire device, subsequent post-annealing succeeded in recovery of Voc to 225 mV on average. Through analysis of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) and short-circuit current (Jsc) versus light intensity, it is shown that the charge collection ability increased and bimolecular recombination decreased in the device after post-annealing. Based on dark J–V characteristics and fitting curves, the reverse saturation current (J0) value reduced to as low as 6.85 × 10−11 A cm−2, demonstrating that the method of post-annealing has an advantage over thermal annealing, as it leads to better interfacial contact between active layer and back electrode.
Introduction
With the development in molecular structure design of the active layer, morphology control and device structure, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved for solution-processed polymer/small molecule solar cells.1–3 The breakthrough in PCE greatly depends on the design of the donor and acceptor materials, but morphology control, such as thermal annealing,4 solvent vapor annealing,4–6 and additives, can raise PCE to a higher degree.1,2,7 Among the methods of morphology control, solvent vapor annealing seems to work better than others in small molecule solar cells due to high crystallinity and good compatibility with fullerene derivatives (poor phase separation in the film),8 especially in systems with the active layer over 200 nm in thickness.5
Initially, solvent vapor annealing (solvent annealing or slow growth) was tried as a means of solving carrier transport bottleneck and reducing series resistance caused by increased thickness of poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) film for more efficient absorption, which cannot be fully achieved by thermal annealing.9 Solvent annealing provides highly ordered donor (enhancing the phase separation simultaneously), enhanced absorption and hole mobility by slowing down the growth rate from solution to solid state, eventually leading to higher fill factor and photocurrent, and is superior to thermal annealing for bulk heterojunctions with relatively thick active layer.10 Gradually, an evident disadvantage of solvent annealing causing a reduction of 50–190 mV in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was noticed.11,12 Li et al.11 conjectured two mechanisms to explain this reduction of Voc in the P3HT:PC61BM system. The first possibility is the strong interchain–interlayer interactions (originating from the relatively high ordering of P3HT in solvent annealed films) leading to a translation from molecular energy level structure to band structure. The second possibility is that solvent annealed films show much stronger absorption intensity in the longer wavelength region, in other words, the red shift in UV-visible absorption spectra reduces the optical bandgap and eventually results in the loss of Voc. The improvement in crystalline ordering of P3HT may play a dominant role in the process of solvent annealing, indicating that solvent annealing exhibits a stronger effect on the crystalline or semi-crystalline system.
It is well known that Voc has become the main bottleneck in improving PCE (over 10%). Voc has been shown to be correlated to the energy difference between the effectively highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of acceptor in bulk heterojunctions, typically less than half the optical gap, with a range of 0.5–1 V.13 Other researchers have considered alternative factors that can limit Voc, including morphology of the active layer,14 regioregularity effect,15,16 ratio of donor to acceptor,2 shunt resistance,17 reverse saturation current,18 presence of non-radiative recombination pathways19 and existence of interface dipole.20
Solvent annealing can provide increased Jsc, and FF, but sacrifices “intrinsic” Voc, eventually achieving a highly efficient device. However, the recovery of Voc has not been paid attention. In this work, we succeeded in applying post-annealing to obtain an average recovery of 225 mV in Voc that had been reduced by solvent annealing in small molecule solar cells based on 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM). A best PCE of 7.2% with Voc of 792 mV, Jsc of 13.37 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.3% could be achieved. No matter how great its loss, Voc could be mostly recovered by post-annealing. However, Chen et al. reported that thermal annealing on the active layer can lower quasi-Fermi levels for electron and hole transport, eventually recovering the Voc of 30 mV caused by solvent annealing with chloroform.21 It is surprising that thermal annealing on the active layer could not fully recover Voc in our research, while thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3/Ag could eventually lead to the recovery of Voc. By analysis of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff), Jscversus light intensity, dark J–V characteristics and fitting curves, it is illustrated that the charge collection ability increased and recombination decreased in a device after thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3/Ag, originating from better contact between active layer and back electrode as well as fewer defects.
Experimental section
Materials

p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc. P3HT and DR3TBDTT were purchased from Solarmer Material Inc. Chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. The molecular structures are showing in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†
Device fabrication
Solution-processed small molecule solar cells with modified device architecture consisting of ITO glass/ZnO/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated according to the following procedure. The ITO-coated glass substrates were firstly cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 30 minutes each. After treating with UV/ozone for 20 min, ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm and a ZnO layer was generated at 220 °C in ambient atmosphere. Active layers were spun at 1750 rpm from solutions of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM at a weight ratio of 3:2, with an overall concentration of 35 mg mL−1. The solution was heated for 15 minutes at 90 °C prior to casting. A drop of chlorobenzene (about 10 μL) was added in a semi-closed Petri dish. Then, the ITO glass covered with the active layer was placed in the Petri dish for different lengths of time. A 7 nm thick layer of MoO3 was deposited by sequential thermal evaporation, followed by 90 nm of Ag. The detailed process was as follows. When the vacuum reached 4 × 10−6 mbar, MoO3 was deposited at a very slow rate of about 1 Å min−1 for the first 10 Å; next the process of evaporation was slowly accelerated—the maximum rate reached 3 Å min−1. The deposition time of 70 Å MoO3 was controlled at ∼30–35 min. Then, the metal Ag was deposited at a very slow rate of about 2 Å min−1 for the first 20 Å, followed by increasing the evaporation rate slowly; the maximum rate was 3 Å s−1 and 900 Å of Ag was deposited in ∼30–35 min. The specimens treated by solvent annealing were further annealed at 100 °C for 10 min after deposition of the active layer, MoO3 or Ag.
Characterizations
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were characterized using a Keithley 2400 meter. The currents were measured in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). All the measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The scan range was from −3 V to 1 V, and 3 mV for each step. Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL 2100F) observation were prepared by spin coating PEDOT:PSS onto ITO glass at 2000 rpm and drying at ambient atmosphere. Then, the active layers were spun at 1750 rpm, followed by solvent annealing for 1.5 h. The films were floated off the substrate in deionized water and collected on a copper mesh grid, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å). The UV-visible spectra of the specimens were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. For atomic force microscopy (AFM) a Digital Instrumental Nanoscope 31 operated in the tapping mode was used.
Result and discussion
The influence of solvent annealing and post-annealing on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM was studied by fabricating devices with inverted structures. Fig. 1a shows the energy levels of components in a device; the optical bandgap of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is ∼1.78 eV with HOMO energy level of −5.12 eV.22 The detailed current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of different devices (including the as-cast device for comparison, four groups and eight devices in total were tested) under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 1b. The solid black curve with square symbols indicates the photovoltaic performance of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system, exhibiting a PCE of 2.1% with Voc = 810 mV, Jsc = 6.70 mA cm−2, and fill factor FF = 39.0%. When different solvent annealing times were tested, an optimal PCE of 4.7% (Voc = 708 mV, Jsc = 10.34 mA cm−2, and FF = 63.7%) could be achieved with solvent annealing time τ = 0.5 h. When combined with post-annealing at 100 °C, a best PCE of 7.2% (Voc = 792 mV, Jsc = 13.37 mA cm−2, and FF = 68.3%) with solvent annealing time τ = 1.5 h was achieved. By combining the solvent annealing and post-annealing methods, a high short-circuit current and fill factor without voltage loss has been realized.

To further understand the significant increase in PCE attributing to the solvent annealing (SA) and post-annealing (PA) methods, the device parameters were investigated at different annealing times. More than 15 devices were fabricated for each condition, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The black curve in Fig. 2 refers to the specimens after solvent annealing whereas the red curve is for to the samples after SA & PA treatment. Each parameter, Jsc, FF, PCE and Voc, was analyzed independently. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Jsc values increased remarkably from 6.47 mA cm−2 to over 11.00 mA cm−2 on average upon solvent annealing treatment. However, no serious change of Jsc value could be observed as solvent annealing time further increased. The Jsc value slightly increased with increase of solvent annealing time after SA & PA treatment, with a maximal Jsc value of 13.37 mA cm−2 at a solvent annealing time of 1.5 h. Fig. 2b shows the fill factor values for devices after treating under different conditions. The as-cast devices possess the characteristic of low fill factor (∼38.5%), resulting from the properties of small molecule donors unable to form good phase-separated morphology with the acceptors. Appropriate solvent annealing time can raise the fill factor substantially, but overlong solvent annealing time may decrease the fill factor to values even lower than the as-cast devices. When combined with SA & PA, the average values of the fill factor significantly increased with increase of solvent annealing time τ, achieving an average value of over 66% (the maximal FF value could reach 73.5% at a solvent annealing time of 1.5 h). The variation of PCE with solvent annealing time is shown in Fig. 2c. The change of PCE with solvent annealing time has a similar trend to fill factor, with the highest PCE of 7.2% achieved by solvent annealing for 1.5 h and post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The most attractive parameter is Voc, decreasing with solvent annealing time as illustrated in Fig. 2d. The average Voc value drops sharply from 809 mV to 637 mV when treating by solvent annealing for 0.5 h, and continues to drop to 563 mV as τ increases to 1.5 h. The maximal loss of Voc was 246 mV, a loss of 30.4% as compared with the as-cast devices. To the best of our knowledge, such tremendous loss of Voc upon solvent annealing has not been reported previously. Combining solvent annealing with post-annealing, no matter how long the solvent annealing time, the loss of Voc caused by solvent annealing could be mostly recovered as compared with the as-cast devices (showing of a 22 mV loss).

Obviously, solvent annealing just affects the active layer; however, post-annealing may influence all layers, including the active layer, MoO3 buffer layer and Ag electrode layer. To investigate the effect of post-annealing on each layer or interface for the recovery of Voc, the active layer was first annealed by chlorobenzene for 1.5 h, followed by thermal treatment at 100 °C for 10 min after sequential deposition of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM, MoO3 or Ag layer. The ZnO layer was generated at 220 °C which was not taken into consideration. The processing conditions are shown in Scheme 1. The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1.† The device after solvent annealing for 1.5 h (Device II) showed an average Voc of 563 mV; further thermal annealing of the active layer (Device III) could recover a Voc as high as 127 mV (Fig. 3a). Although thermal annealing of the active layer could restore most of Voc, it is still 119 mV lower than the as-cast device (Device I), showing a Voc of 809 mV, which could not be ignored. Following thermal annealing of the MoO3 layer (Device IV) or Ag layer (Device V), the recovery of Voc could reach to 199 mV and 225 mV, respectively. It is demonstrated that thermal treatment has a positive effect not only on the active layer, but also on the interface between the active layer and MoO3/Ag layer. The fill factors (FFs) of devices with annealing at different layers are shown in Fig. 3b: both Device I and Device II have low FFs of 38.5% and 48.7%, respectively. Device III still shows a relatively low FF of 58.1%, which is below 60%. However, the FF has a significant improvement above 66% for Device IV and Device V. Similar to the trend of Voc change, the PCE increases upon thermal treatment layer by layer (Fig. 3c). Of note, as compared with Device II, the Jsc of Device III slightly decreases from 11.40 mA cm−2 to 10.89 mA cm−2 in Fig. 3d. Device IV and Device V show an obvious increase of Jsc to 11.63 mA cm−2 and 12.53 mA cm−2, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Summary of process conditions. The active layer was annealed by chlorobenzene for 1.5 h (SA), followed by: (Device II) depositing MoO3/Ag; (Device III) further thermal annealing, then depositing MoO3/Ag; (Device IV) depositing MoO3 with further thermal annealing, and finally depositing Ag; (Device V) depositing MoO3/Ag with subsequent post-annealing of the device. For comparison, Device I without any treatment was fabricated.

To understand the significant change in photovoltaic parameters influenced by solvent annealing and thermal annealing, in addition to the reason why Voc recovered upon thermal treatment layer by layer, we focus on the evolution of the morphology of the active layer in Device I, Device II and Device III. As seen in Fig. S2† and 4a, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is observed to be mixed well with PC71BM in the as-cast film, showing homogeneous morphology without serious phase separation. After annealing by chlorobenzene for 1.5 h, fibrils about 10–20 nm in diameter were distributed throughout the film forming a continuous network, indicating improved crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 upon solvent annealing. The subsequent thermal annealing may lead to reduction of fibril density, and the fibrils become less clear. X-ray diffraction was further performed to investigate the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the active layer. As reported previously, the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor was highly crystalline, showing three reflections.23 In Fig. 4b, the as-cast p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film exhibits no reflection peaks, showing that crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is seriously restricted by PC71BM. After solvent annealing for 1.5 h, the film shows third order reflection peaks at 2θ = 4.04, 8.04, and 11.96°, illustrating that solvent annealing strongly induces the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Further thermal annealing may lead to the appearance of less sharp reflection peaks as compared with the films with only solvent annealing treatment, showing that thermal annealing slightly reduces the crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The X-ray diffraction result is consistent with TEM observation. The optical properties of films were characterized by normalized UV-visible absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 4c. The as-cast p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film shows two prominent absorption peaks at 396 nm and 614 nm with a weak shoulder peak at 670 nm that is attributed to π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. After solvent annealing for 1.5 h, the absorption peaks show a red shift of about 12 nm, 10 nm and 8 nm, respectively, and the shoulder peak becomes more evident. For the solvent annealed films, the absorption spectra show no significant change before and after thermal annealing at 100 °C. The variation of the photovoltaic parameters Jsc and Voc should be related to the crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the corresponding absorbance of the films. The incomplete recovery of Voc for the device after thermal annealing at the active layer may be attributable to minor variation of morphology and crystallinity.

The scale bars in the TEM images show 200 nm. 
Thermal annealing treatment on the active layer can significantly recover the Voc; however, the Voc is still much lower than that of the as-cast device, leaving abundant scope to further enhance Voc. The Voc could be further recovered by thermal treatment after deposition of active layer/MoO3 or active layer/MoO3/Ag. Anyway, the annealing temperature of 100 °C is too low to change the internal structure of inorganic MoO3 and Ag layers. Thus, the interface between the active layer and MoO3 layer or the interface between the MoO3 and Ag layers becomes the determining factor. It has been demonstrated that a reduction of bimolecular recombination (rate constant krec) by one order of magnitude will increase Voc by about 80 mV,24 and the value of krec influences a range of factors including interface area, morphology, charge carrier mobility and interface electronic coupling, etc.25 We found that the fill factor of devices shows considerable enhancement, reaching above 66% on average after thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3 or active layer/MoO3/Ag. To explore why thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3 or active layer/MoO3/Ag is better than that on the active layer, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) is presented in Fig. 5a. Jph is given by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is the minimum driving force for charge extraction; no photocurrent is generated when Veff is below zero (Veff = V0 − Vapp, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Vapp is the external voltage; V0 is close to the built-in voltage VBI26). The detailed curves of JL, JD and Jphversus Vapp are shown in Fig. S3† and 5. In the ideal situation, the photocurrent increases linearly with the effective voltage at a small effective voltage, indicating that diffusion plays an important role in the experimental photocurrent, and then at higher effective voltage, the drift contribution is dominant and the photogenerated current tends to be saturated.27 The saturation value Jph,sat (A m−2) is determined by Jph,sat = qLGmax(1)where q is the elementary charge (q = 1.6 × 10−19 C), L is the thickness of the active layer (m), and Gmax is the number of absorbed photons (m−3 s−1). The Jph of a solar cell can be written as Jph = qLGmaxPc(2)
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices plotted on double logarithmic scale; (b) measured Jsc plotted against light intensity on double logarithmic scale, together with linear fits to the data (solid lines) for five devices. The inset α values are the slopes of the fitted lines. 
Thus, the charge collection probability (Pc) in the short-circuit condition can be calculated by Jph/Jph,sat. For Device I, the photocurrent increases linearly with effective voltage till a comparatively high reverse voltage without reaching saturation. After annealing by chlorobenzene (Device II), there exists a linear region (Veff < 0.2 V) and saturated region (0.2 V < Veff < 0.4 V) along with a region with photocurrent increasing sharply at high reverse voltage (Veff > 0.4 V). It is indicated that in Device II there exist a lot of photogenerated bound e–h pairs which cannot be dissociated into free charge carriers at low reverse voltage.28 In Device III, the saturated region (0.4 V < Veff < 2.0 V) becomes obvious and the photocurrent slightly increases with voltage at high reverse voltage. Upon thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3 (Device IV) or active layer/MoO3/Ag (Device V), the slope of the linear region becomes steeper with saturation photocurrent Jph,sat ≈ 135.6 and 138.3 A m−2, respectively. The detailed data are summarized in Table 2. Such enhancement implies that the bimolecular recombination decreased and charge collection ability increased in the device after post-annealing on active layer/MoO3/Ag, probably originating from good contact between inorganic and organic interface as well as fewer defects.

To gain deeper insight into recovery of Voc, we studied the recombination mechanism by measuring Jsc at various light intensities from 100 to 23 mW cm−2. A power law dependence of Jsc on illumination intensity is generally observed in organic solar cells and can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Iα(3)where I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor.29 The closer the value of α is to 1, the weaker are bimolecular recombination during sweep-out.30 In Fig. 5b, the data are plotted on a log–log scale and fitted. For Device I, the slope of α is 0.830, indicating considerable bimolecular recombination. After solvent annealing (Device II), the slope of α increases to 0.912, and further thermal annealing exhibits no serious influence on α (Device III). By thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3 (Device IV) or active layer/MoO3/Ag (Device V), the slope of α reaches as high as 0.965 and 0.978, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is markedly suppressed.
To quantitatively investigate the recovery of Voc, we analyzed reverse saturation current density in the dark (J0) and the ideal factor (n) of devices, which can be considered direct evidence of recombination loss in solar cells because of the relationship between J0, n and Voc2,18 (4)where K is Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, q is the elementary charge, and Jsc is the short-circuit current determined from the J–V curve. The values of J0 and n can be calculated based on the traditional equivalent circuit model.31,32 Under ideal conditions, n = 1, while the organic solar cells typically have n values in the range between 1.5 and 2.0.33 It should be noted that the lower are J0 and n, the lower is recombination. In this work, we fitted the J–V curve in the dark, and the fitting equation is as follows (5)where Rs is series resistance, and Rp is parallel resistance. The detailed data are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Based on eqn (4), the Voc is strongly dependent on the n value. Additionally, the variation of more than one order in J0 may obviously contribute to the change of Voc due to the exponential term. The saturation current J0 and the ideal factor n of Device I are as high as 9.61 × 10−10 A cm−2 and 2.00, indicating considerable internal recombination. The high Voc = 809 mV is probably determined by the large ideal factor n. In Device II, the sharp decrease of Voc may be associated with the dramatic reduction of n to 1.5. Devices III, IV and V show a similar n value at about 1.60. However, the J0 values exhibit a variation of more than one order of magnitude. Especially, the J0 value reduced to 6.85 × 10−11 A cm−2 for Device V. It is indicated that the thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3 or active layer/MoO3/Ag has an advantage over the thermal treatment on the active layer, leading to better interfacial contact between active layer and back electrode. The general rule for different active layers of organic solar cells was observed, as shown in Table S2.†

Conclusions
Upon solvent annealing, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system exhibited a tremendous loss of 246 mV in open-circuit voltage (Voc), which could be recovered by further thermal annealing layer by layer. By combining solvent annealing and post-annealing, a best PCE of 7.2% with Voc of 792 mV, Jsc of 13.37 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.3% could be achieved. It was found that thermal annealing on the active layer could not fully recover Voc, while thermal treatment on active layer/MoO3/Ag could eventually lead to recovery of Voc. The solvent annealing could induce formation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 nanofibrils with a diameter of 10–20 nm, and the nanofibrils became less clear after thermal annealing as revealed by TEM analysis. Both the X-ray diffraction and UV-visible results indicated that solvent annealing could induce crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 while the subsequent thermal annealing slightly reduced crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. By analysis of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff), Jscversus light intensity, dark J–V characteristics and fitting curves, it was shown that the charge collection ability increased and bimolecular recombination decreased in the device after post-annealing on active layer/MoO3/Ag, originating from better contact between active layer and back electrode as well as fewer defects.
