    , Accepted 15th December 2015First published on 17th December 2015AbstractThe fabrication and device parameters of inverted planar heterojunction (PHJ) organic–inorganic lead mixed-halide (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) using a:CuAlO2 as the hole selective buffer layer between the ITO electrode and PEDOT:PSS were demonstrated. Thin films of a:CuAlO2 were derived from a pre-fabricated polycrystalline CuAlO2 ceramic target by using the direct current (d.c.) magnetron sputtering technique. The one-step spin coating method was used to prepare the perovskite layer. A short circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.98 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.75 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.52% were achieved for the optimized device. These improved device parameters were also accompanied by improved stability as a result of sandwiching the ambient stable a:CuAlO2 layer with decent conductivity between the ITO and the PEDOT:PSS layers. The versatility of this material application was also demonstrated as a similar improvement in device performance and stability, which was observed by using the prepared a:CuAlO2 in another perovskite solar cell system based on CH3NH3PbI3 prepared by the two-step spin-coating method.
Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskites have shown great promise as light absorber layers in perovskite based solar cells.1–6 This is due to their possession of interesting properties such as high absorption coefficient, direct band gap, excellent charge transport properties and long exciton diffusion length.7–11 These unique properties have led to the rapid improvement in device performance within a short time with the best PCE currently above 20%.12
The two major device architectures commonly reported for perovskite based solar cells are: the planar heterojunction (PHJ)13,14 and the mesostructure.15,16 However, due to the limitations such as high temperature requirements for the formation of layers of metal oxide scaffolds and the pore filling problems,17–20 PHJ which has a simple structure in which the perovskite layer is sandwiched between a hole and an electron conductor stands out. The most widely used hole transport layer (HTL) in the PHJ device is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)21–27 which is acidic in nature.28,29 This acidic property of PEDOT:PSS poses great long-term danger to the underlaying ITO as it could be eroded after a while leading to a poorly stable device. Other materials such as nickel oxide (NiO),28,30–32 poly-(N-9′-hepta decanyl-2,7-cabazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di(thien-2-yl)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)) (PCDTBT),33,34 lead sulphide (PbS),35,36 graphene oxide (GO)37,38 and germanium dioxide (GeO2)29 have been demonstrated as alternative hole transporting materials and in some cases, possible replacements for the acidic PEDOT:PSS. Their PCEs are however usually lower than those reported for PEDOT:PSS based devices.
Another factor which is pivotal to the actual practical application and commercialization of perovskite based solar cells but has not been given adequate attention is the device stability. However few reports exist on the combination of advantages of MoO3 and PEDOT:PSS as a composite and bilayer HTL. MoO3 has been paid great attention due to its high transmittance, nontoxicity, and high work function.39–44 This combination has been found to promote the performance and stability of solar cells.45–48 Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells have been fabricated by inserting a solution-processed PEDOT/PSS anode buffer layer doped with solution processed metal oxides.45,46 However, to avoid the direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and ITO, which still occurs in such a configuration, a facile method was developed to fabricate a solution processed e-MoO3/PEDOT:PSS bilayer HTL for application in polymer solar cells.47 Furthermore, the solution processed MoO3/PEDOT:PSS bilayer has been used as the HTL in inverted CH3NH3PbI3 PHJ perovskite solar cells.48 This bilayer system improves the efficiency and stability of the solar cells by decreasing the series resistance, increasing the hole extraction efficiency and restraining the erosion of ITO by PEDOT:PSS.
p-Type CuAlO2 has been reported to possess decent optical transparency, chemical and thermal stability and can be prepared from cheap, easily accessible and non-toxic elements.49,50 Its conductivity could also be as high as 1 S cm−1.51 The application of the CuAlO2 bulk or film in perovskite solar cells is so far yet to be reported. This may be due to the high temperature needed for the preparation of its pure polycrystalline delafossite phase. However, Ahmed et al.,52 Nattestad et al.53 and Bandara et al.54 have reported the application of CuAlO2 nanoparticles as the HTL in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in which the device performance was explained to be a function of nanoparticle size distribution and morphology. The preparation and application of amorphous CuAlO2 (a:CuAlO2) which does not require high temperature processing have been reported. Li et al.55 prepared a:CuAlO2 thin films via radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering from sintered targets composed of Al(OH)3 and Cu2O precursors. They reported a direct band gap of 3.86 eV for the as-deposited film. Bu56 also grew amorphous p-type CuAlO2 thin films on n-type crystalline ZnO nanowires to form a heterojunction with photovoltaic properties. It is important to note that the magnetron sputtering technique is capable of generating a wide area, continuous and compact film which is without voids through which a direct contact between the acidic PEDOT:PSS and the ITO may occur. It is also a physical deposition method in which no solvent is required for sample deposition. It therefore does not create chances of wet chemical reactions between the a:CuAlO2 and ITO.
Here we demonstrate the application of an a:CuAlO2 as a hole selective interfacial layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS in the fabrication of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based solar cell with an inverted device architecture. The a:CuAlO2 layer was deposited by using the d.c. magnetron sputtering technique. The a:CuAlO2 due to its stability and decent conductivity served two purposes such as enhancing the extraction of photogenerated charges from the active CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer into the ITO and completely preventing the direct contact between the acidic PEDOT:PSS and ITO. These combined advantages ensure the improvement in the device parameters of the PSCs fabricated with a:CuAlO2 compared to the reference PSCs which are without a:CuAlO2. The optimized device having a 15 nm a:CuAlO2 layer showed improved stability by retaining about 80% of its initial PCE while the reference device only retained 35% of its PCE after storage under ambient conditions for 240 hours.
Results and discussion
The CuAlO2 polycrystalline ceramic sputter target and the resulting a:CuAlO2 thin films prepared by using the d.c. magnetron sputtering technique were characterized using XRD. Fig. S1(a)† displays the XRD patterns of the representative a:CuAlO2 and the pure delafossite crystal phase of the CuAlO2 ceramic target. All the peaks which can be attributed to the precursor materials as well as other intermediate species in the crystal phase transition are not found in the CuAlO2 XRD pattern. This indicates that pure CuAlO2 powder and ceramic target can be achieved by using our technique (Experimental section, ESI†). The need to maintain a Cu:Al:O ratio of 1:1:2 in the a:CuAlO2 films necessitated the use of a delafossite CuAlO2 ceramic target. A typical EDX spectrum confirming this atomic ratio for a:CuAlO2 is presented in Fig. S1(b).† The XRD pattern of the representative a:CuAlO2 thin film shows no obvious diffraction peaks. This confirms the amorphous nature of the film. The formation of such amorphous materials from a polycrystalline target is attributed to the introduction of a measure of structural disorder as the material is being deposited in vapour form onto the substrate.
The conductivity of the prepared a:CuAlO2 film which is expected to vary as a function of film thickness was studied and was compared with the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film (40 nm). To achieve this, Hall effect measurements were carried out on the samples using the van der Pauw method. Table 1 shows the parameters obtained for the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS and various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2 films. These results are within the range of values previously reported by other authors.27,54,57–60 The movement of charge carriers becomes easier if the packing density and consequently the conductivity of the films increase. Hence we speculate that an increase in packing density as a result of the increased film thickness makes substantial contribution to the electrical conductivity. However, activation energy also plays a vital role in thin film conductivity. Therefore, to further understand the origin of this phenomenon, we conducted a temperature dependent conductivity test on the thin films within the temperature range of 273 K and 300 K. The variation of logarithmic conductivity as a function of inverse of temperature (Arrhenius plot) is shown in Fig. S2.† This variation can be expressed by the equation  where σ0 is the conductivity at infinite temperature, EA is the thermal activation energy and k is the Boltzmann's constant. Activation energies of 0.16, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.005 eV were therefore extracted for PEDOT:PSS (40 nm), 5, 10, 15 and 20 nm a:CuAlO2, respectively. It was found that the activation energy decreases continuously while the electrical conductivity progressively increases. Such a relationship between EA and σ has previously been reported.61,62 We therefore conclude that the increase in the conductivity of the a:CuAlO2 films is due to the decrease in activation energy as the film thickness increases. From Table 1, it can also be seen that the obtained conductivity values for the prepared a:CuAlO2 are higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS film. It is known that inorganic materials show better electronic behaviour than their organic counterparts. As explained later, the insertion of a stable a:CuAlO2 with decent conductivity and suitable energy level alignment between the ITO electrode and PEDOT:PSS can lead to a reduction in series resistance (Rs) by eliminating the contact resistance created as a result of the harsh acidic effect of PEDOT:PSS on ITO. This leads to enhanced charge extraction.

In addition to the electronic properties, the workfunction (WF) of the a:CuAlO2 was also seen as a function of film thickness. From the UPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS and the various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2 obtained by using a helium lamp emitting at 21.2 eV as presented in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the secondary cut-off regions for films with 5, 10, 15 and 20 nm thicknesses are 16.2, 16.1, 16.0 and 15.9 eV, respectively. Thus, the calculated WFs for these films are 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1. It was observed from this measurement that the workfunction of the 15 nm a:CuAlO2 film matches with that of PEDOT:PSS.

AFM images in Fig. S3(a, c, e and g)† show a reduction in the root mean square (rms) roughness of the films from 1.24 nm to 0.63 nm as the thickness increased from 5 nm to 20 nm. The variation in WF is therefore due to the changes in the surface roughness as the film thickness increases. WF, a fundamental electronic property of materials, is extremely sensitive to surface conditions.63 Some existing results64–67 show that the larger the surface roughness is, the smaller the WF becomes.
Metal-oxide work functions can also be tuned over a continual range by changing the concentration of defects. The removal of oxygen tends to decrease the work function, whereas the addition of oxygen tends to increase the work function.68,69 Removal of oxygen through the formation of O vacancies results in cation centers with reduced oxidation states. As the concentration of the reduced cations increases, an oxide's electronegativity and subsequently its work function decrease. The formation of O vacancies is a result of interfacial redox interactions taking place at the electrode/metal oxide (in this case, ITO/a:CuAlO2) interface and it is induced by the difference in oxidation potentials (Epa) of the electrode and metal oxide. To confirm this we carried out cyclic voltammetry on separate films of ITO and a:CuAlO2 used in this work. A three-electrode scheme was used. ITO and sputtered a:CuAlO2 thin films were used in turn as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl wire in a 3.5 M KCl aqueous solution as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter-electrode. The electrolyte used was 0.1 M aqueous KCl. Fig. S5(a)† shows the voltammograms obtained for both films. It can be seen that the magnitude of the Epa of ITO (1.34 V) is greater than that of a:CuAlO2 (1.12 V). This suggests the removal of oxygen anions by the ITO electrode from the metal oxide buffer layer. This induces oxygen vacancies in the a:CuAlO2 buffer layer. Fig. S5(b)† shows the O 1s core level spectrum obtained from XPS analysis conducted on the ITO/a:CuAlO2 film. From the XPS pattern, it can be seen that the concentration of the created defect is a function of film thickness as a reduction in the intensity of oxygen anions is observed as the a:CuAlO2 film thickness decreases. The induced oxygen vacancies are defects which create cation centers with reduced oxidation states which are responsible for lowering the work function.
Fig. S3(b, d, f and h)† show the plan view SEM images of the a:CuAlO2 films on ITO. It can also be seen from these images that the surface roughness decreased as the film thickness increased and that a complete coverage of the ITO layer is achieved regardless of the thickness of the a:CuAlO2 film. This is due to the effectiveness of the sputter deposition technique. This complete coverage is important as it prevents the creation of voids through which a direct contact can be created between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the ITO layer. Fig. S4(a–e)† show the AFM images of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS films deposited on the 5, 10, 15 and 20 nm a:CuAlO2 films. The rms roughness of the PEDOT:PSS films are observed to be 1.23, 1.25, 1.24, 1.23 and 1.22 nm respectively showing that they are all comparable. This similarity in surface roughness indicates that the underlying a:CuAlO2 does not affect the surface properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer. This could be as a result of the significant difference between the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer and those of the a:CuAlO2 underlying films and the similarities in the thicknesses of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS films with a:CuAlO2 underlayers as they were all deposited by spin-coating at 4500 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for 20 min to yield a thickness of 40 nm (as analysed by AFM).
The optical properties of the ITO/a:CuAlO2 layers which are crucial to the magnitude of the absorbed incident photon by the absorber layer were studied and were compared to those of the neat ITO. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that due to the high transparency of the a:CuAlO2 thin films, the ITO/a:CuAlO2 layers exhibit remarkable transparency of up to 80% comparable to that of the neat ITO. This shows that the incorporation of thin films of a:CuAlO2 does not impair the optical properties required for the optimum operation of the solar cell.

XRD analysis of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx grown on the a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS bilayer and on the pristine PEDOT:PSS was conducted to confirm the effective formation of the perovskite layer with or without the incorporation of the a:CuAlO2. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns. The peaks denoted by (110), (220), (310) and (312) which are attributed to the pure CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite phase show that a complete reaction took place between the CH3NH3I and PbCl2 as the peaks which could be assigned to unreacted precursors or reaction intermediates do not exist in the pattern.

The similarities in peak patterns of various bilayer configurations and the pristine PEDOT:PSS confirms the effective formation of the perovskite absorber layer irrespective of the underlayers. Fig. 4 shows the plan view SEM images of a typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film on a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS layer with various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx on pristine PEDOT:PSS. Both films exhibit a homogeneous, compact and continuous morphology. Such morphology ensures high charge mobility and a low electron–hole recombination in perovskite based solar cells.

Photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency of the perovskite emission was then conducted to study its compatibility with our a:CuAlO2 thin film. Structures of ITO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and ITO/a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with various a:CuAlO2 thicknesses were compared. Excitation wavelength of 530 nm as confirmed from the absorbance spectra obtained from UV/Vis analysis (Fig. S6†) was used for the PL measurements. Fig. 5 shows the PL emission spectra with peaks of the ITO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx structure found around 770 nm. The sharp reduction in the PL intensities indicates that the PL quenching efficiencies increased significantly as PEDOT:PSS and a:CuAlO2 layers are being added to the structures with the structures having a:CuAlO2 showing comparable efficiency with the structures having pristine PEDOT:PSS. This shows that the addition of a:CuAlO2 does not impair the PL quenching efficiency of PEDOT:PSS and can enhance the extraction of photogenerated charge due to its increased conductivity.

Based on these properties, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based solar cells were fabricated using the a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS bilayer hole conductor and were compared with a reference device which was fabricated without a:CuAlO2. The PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of 40 nm was used in devices fabricated with and without a:CuAlO2. Six devices were fabricated in each case and the obtained device parameters were averaged. Fig. 6(a) shows the device structure of the fabricated device and Fig. 6(b) shows the energy level diagram of the device components as obtained from the literature along with various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2 as calculated from our UPS measurements.

In Fig. 7(a), the J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based solar cells with different a:CuAlO2 film thicknesses and the reference device are presented. The detailed device parameters extracted from the curves are presented in Table 2. From this table, it is seen that the reference device possesses a Jsc of 18.79 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, an FF of 0.67 and a PCE of 11.10%. Similarities were observed in the Voc of both the reference device and devices with various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2. This is a result of the similarities in their PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interfaces, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx bulk and the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM interfaces. An improvement was however observed in the Jsc, FF and consequently the PCE of the devices with a:CuAlO2.

This improvement stems from the enhanced charge extraction and reduced charge recombination due to the incorporation of an a:CuAlO2 with increased conductivities and suitable workfunctions as explained later. A slight decrease in the device parameters was observed as the a:CuAlO2 film thickness was increased to 20 nm. From these obtained parameters it is seen that the optimized device is the one with 15 nm a:CuAlO2 which exhibits a Jsc of 21.98 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, an FF of 0.75 and a PCE of 14.52%. Compared with the reference device, the PCE of the optimized device is increased by more than 30% as a result of about 17% and 12% improvements in its Jsc and FF, respectively. The EQE data obtained from the devices are shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be seen that the curves obtained confirm the J–V curve results with the optimized device exhibiting a much higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency compared to the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based device. A shape similarity is also observed in the EQE response of the devices with and without a:CuAlO2 and this supports the information obtained from the PL spectra that excitons are effectively quenched in devices with and without a:CuAlO2. These results confirm that the addition of an a:CuAlO2 buffer layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS is an effective way to improve device performance by increasing the electrical conductivity, charge extraction efficiency and restraining charge recombination.
The origin of this improved device performance can be traced to the increased conductivity of the added a:CuAlO2 layer and its formation of adequate energy level alignments with the PEDOT:PSS layer. Table 1 shows a comparison between the conductivities of the a:CuAlO2 layers and the PEDOT:PSS. Since the photoluminescence quenching efficiency of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 5) is not impaired by the addition of the a:CuAlO2 layer, the increased conductivity of a:CuAlO2 ensures enhanced extraction and transport of the photogenerated charges through the hole conducting bilayer into the electrode. This enhanced charge extraction ensures efficient charge separation and restrained recombination. As a result, there exists a reduction in the series resistances (Rs) of the devices with a:CuAlO2 while their shunt resistances (Rp) are comparable to that of the reference device as shown in Table 2.
In addition, the WF of various thicknesses of the a:CuAlO2 also affects the ease with which charges are extracted from the active layer into the electrode. The energy level diagram as obtained from the UPS analysis in Fig. 1 is presented in Fig. 6(b). It can be seen that the workfunction of the 15 nm a:CuAlO2 aligns perfectly with that of the PEDOT:PSS film. This contributes to the effective charge extraction as no energy barrier exists at the interface. It also explains why this device presents better performance than the other devices with a:CuAlO2 as they exhibit considerable energy barriers with the PEDOT:PSS. Despite these energy level barriers, it is observed that they still possess improved device parameters compared to the reference device. This is because the energy barriers created are suitable enough to form cascade energy alignments70–72 with the PEDOT:PSS layer and the ITO electrode. This is energetically favourable for charge transfer as it blocks the back flow of the extracted photogenerated charges and improves their injection into the electrode. Although this cascade energy alignment is not seen in the 20 nm a:CuAlO2 as it possesses a higher WF of 5.3 eV, enhanced photogenerated charge (hole) extraction can be due to the ohmic contact created at the ITO/a:CuAlO2 interface as a result of its increased conductivity. This lack of energy level alignment however creates a relative increase in Rs (Table 2) and explains why there exists a slight reduction in device parameters such as Jsc and FF of the device with 20 nm a:CuAlO2 compared to the optimized device.
To obtain a deeper insight of the role of the a:CuAlO2 buffer layer in the performance of perovskite solar cells, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the interface charge transport in the perovskite solar cell. It was observed that the a:CuAlO2 hole selective buffer layer can forcefully reduce the charge transfer resistance between the ITO and the PEDOT:PSS film, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The Nyquist plots of the devices were measured at 0.88 V under dark conditions and the equivalent circuit model for the perovskite solar cells is shown in the inset of Fig. 8(a). The fitted equivalent circuit model is composed of the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (RCT) which forms a parallel circuit with capacitor CCT. The parameters of the equivalent circuit with and without a:CuAlO2 are summarized in Table S1.† It is clear that the device without a:CuAlO2 exhibits the largest RCT of 384.03 Ω indicating the poorest charge transport properties as witnessed by the lowest Jsc (Table 2). The RCT is found to be notably decreased to 221.77 Ω for the optimized perovskite solar cells based on the 15 nm a:CuAlO2 suggesting that the contact resistance existing between the PEDOT:PSS layer and ITO electrode (which may be due to the harsh acidic effect of PEDOT:PSS on ITO) disappears with the addition of a:CuAlO2. Since the contact resistance contributes to the Rs in devices, we therefore conclude that the reduction in the Rs in devices with a:CuAlO2 results from the disappearance of contact resistance. These reductions in Rs and RCT imply more efficient extraction/transport of the holes resulting in increased Jsc and FF for the solar cells.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots measured at the Voc and (b) current density–voltage characteristics measured under dark conditions for devices with pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS with 5, 10, 15 and 20 nm a:CuAlO2 underlayers. 
The current density–voltage characteristics of these devices were also measured under dark conditions. From Fig. 8(b), it can be found that the dark currents of the a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS based devices are higher than those of the reference device. The highest dark current is found in the device with a:CuAlO2 (15 nm)/PEDOT:PSS which corresponds to the highest PCE among the devices. These increased dark currents indicate a reduction in series resistance (Rs)48 which leads to an improvement in the photogenerated charge extraction efficiency as explained earlier.
Although PEDOT:PSS is known to yield devices with high performance, its acidic properties limit its long term suitability. This is due to the fact that the underlying ITO stands a risk of been eroded after a while by this acidic top layer. This has an adverse effect on the stability of such device. The introduction of an inorganic metal oxide buffer layer which possesses good electrical and optical properties with ambient stability between the PEDOT:PSS and the ITO can therefore not be overemphasized. This is also advantageous for the perovskite based device as it combines both the excellent electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS and the metal oxide and the ambient stability properties of the metal oxide. To verify this, the stability of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based devices with various thicknesses of a:CuAlO2 and devices with pristine PEDOT:PSS was studied. This was done by storing unencapsulated forms of these devices under dark ambient conditions while their parameters are being tested under illumination every 24 h over a period of 240 h. From Fig. 9, it can be seen that the devices with a:CuAlO2 show improved stability through the test period with the optimized device retaining about 80% of its initial PCE whereas the reference device was only able to retain 35% of its initial PCE as a result of the significant reduction in its Jsc and FF. As mentioned above the reduced stability of the reference CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based devices is due to the gradual erosion of the ITO layer as a result of the acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS top layer.

To investigate the versatility of a:CuAlO2 in different PSC devices, we extended our investigation to the application of pristine a:CuAlO2 and a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS in devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite prepared by the two-step spin-coating method. The application of pristine a:CuAlO2 is informed by the necessity of developing solar cells which are totally free from the acidic environment created by PEDOT:PSS. The optimized 15 nm a:CuAlO2 hole extraction layer was adopted for this purpose. The resulting current density–voltage characteristics under AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW cm2) are shown in Fig. 10(a) and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table 3 (reference cell based on PEDOT:PSS was also fabricated and measured). As expected, due to similarities in energy band alignment, all the devices fabricated exhibited the same Voc (0.88 V). The pristine a:CuAlO2 (15 nm)-based solar cell exhibits higher Jsc (18.58 mA cm−2) than the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based device (16.41 mA cm−2). As previously discussed, this can be ascribed to the higher electrical conductivity exhibited by a:CuAlO2. However, the FF (0.70) of the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based solar cell is higher than that of the pristine a:CuAlO2 (0.62). Overall, no significant difference is observed in the PCEs of devices with pristine a:CuAlO2 and pristine PEDOT:PSS. This suggests the suitability of a:CuAlO2 as an alternative hole selective layer to PEDOT:PSS for perovskite solar cell systems fabricated by the two-step spin-coating method.

Employing a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS as the HTL significantly improves the device performance, with an increase in the Jsc and FF as shown in Fig. 10(a). This results in a maximum PCE of 12.48% which substantially surpasses the performance of pristine a:CuAlO2 and pristine PEDOT:PSS based devices. As discussed earlier, the enhanced Jsc and FF can be interpreted as a consequence of the reduction in series resistance of the device as the a:CuAlO2 sandwiched between ITO and PEDOT:PSS was able to eliminate the contact resistance created by the harsh acidic effect of PEDOT:PSS on ITO while still retaining its good electrical properties. This enables more efficient charge extraction from the perovskite absorber. These results confirm that the sandwiching of a:CuAlO2 between PEDOT:PSS and ITO is an effective way to improve the device performance by reducing the series resistance and increasing the charge extraction efficiency. The ambient stability of the PCEs of CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells without encapsulation was characterized and is presented in Fig. 10(b). The pristine a:CuAlO2-based solar cell shows markedly improved ambient stability as compared to the pristine PEDOT:PSS and a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS-based devices. The PCE of the pristine a:CuAlO2-based device remains above 90% of the initial value even after 240 h of storage in air. In addition, the a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS-based device retained 80% of its initial value while the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based device degraded to less than 35% of its initial PCE. As aforementioned, this lower stability might originate from the acidic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS that erodes the ITO electrode.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we fabricated CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite based solar cells with an inverted structure having an a:CuAlO2/PEDOT:PSS hole conductor bilayer. Due to the significant difference in the thicknesses of the a:CuAlO2 layer compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS top layer, the PEDOT:PSS top layer presented comparable surface properties with the pristine PEDOT:PSS. This creates a similarity in the growth of the perovskite layer. The decent conductivity of the a:CuAlO2 in the optimized device and its energy level alignment with PEDOT:PSS yielded an optimized device performance with a PCE of 14.52% which is significantly higher than that of the reference device (11.10%). This improvement in device parameters is due to the reduction in charge recombination as a result of enhanced charge separation and collection. On storage for 240 h under ambient conditions, the optimized device exhibited better stability as it retained about 80% of its initial PCE unlike the reference device which was just able to retain only 35% of its initial PCE. A similar improvement in performance and stability was also observed in devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 prepared by the two-step spin-coating method. The improved stability is due to the prevention of the erosion of the ITO layer by the acidic PEDOT:PSS layer as a result of the protective function of the a:CuAlO2 which is sandwiched between these two layers preventing a direct contact between them. This work presents a feasible approach to the concurrent improvement of the PCE and stability of inverted PHJ perovskite based solar cells.
