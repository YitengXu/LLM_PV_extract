    , Accepted 28th March 2011First published on 19th May 2011AbstractA new series of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-pyridine ruthenium complexes incorporating a carbene unit as an ancillary ligand were designed and successfully synthesized by using simple synthetic methods. The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these NHC-pyridine based ruthenium complexes were investigated. These complexes showed photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the range of 6.43 ∼ 7.24% under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). Interestingly, the modifications on the ancillary ligand of these sensitizers by removal of an alkoxyl group and replacement of the octyl chain with a 3,5-difluorobenzyl group showed a 13% increase in the conversion efficiency for the CifPR dye. These results demonstrated that structural modifications on the NHC-pyridine ancillary ligand of ruthenium complexes results in dye-sensitized solar cells exhibiting a comparable cell performance to that obtained using the standard N719 dye.
Introduction
With increasing renewable energy demands and the effect of global warming, alternative or sustainable energy sources are being extensively explored. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), reported by Grätzel, have attracted special attention from researchers for their photovoltaic applications with versatility, high light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency and low cost of manufacture.1,2 Presently, a wide range of ruthenium polypyridine complexes, non-ruthenium organometallic dyes and metal free organic sensitizers have been shown to provide respectable incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs).3,4 The most investigated efficient inorganic dyes exploited in DSSCs are ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes. Among them, the fairly stable ruthenium dye N7195 received significant attention for its photophysical and photochemical properties providing DSSCs with excellent photoelectric conversion efficiencies. To further enhance the efficiency or improve the long-term stability, alkyl,6–8alkoxy,9 conjugated,10–12 or other substituent groups13 were incorporated into the ancillary or anchoring ligand of amphiphilic bis(bipyridyl) Ru(II) dyes. The incorporation of an anionic carbon atom in the bidentate or tridentate ligand of the ruthenium polypyridine complexes to replace the NCS ligand, known as cyclometalated ruthenium complexes, exhibited an interesting approach for structural modification.14–18 However, the current design utilized similar strategies and kept the composition of the bipyridyl or polypyridyl cores of the ruthenium complexes unchanged. It is apparent that there is a need to further explore the strategy of designing ruthenium-based sensitizing dyes and expand the “design principles” to help guide dye discovery. It could be encouraging to replace the bipyridine ligand of the bipyridyl or polypyridyl complexes with neutral N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. During the course of investigating different types of NHC-pyridine ruthenium complexes as dyes to improve the flexibility of the molecular design,19 we developed sensitizers consisting of a divalent carbon replacing the nitrogen atom in the traditional bipyridine framework.
Since the first isolation and characterization of free NHC,20 many advances have been made on the syntheses, reactions and applications of NHCs bearing a unique set of electronic properties.21–24 The cyclic diaminocarbenes, which are members of a large family of persistent carbenes, represent the dominant architecture of stable carbenes reported to date. The NHC-pyridine ligands are stabilized by the presence of two heteroatoms interacting with the carbene centre.25 The research of metal-NHC complexes was extensively investigated, as catalytic reagents and luminescent emitters,26,27 but their photovoltaic applications are still relatively rare in the literature.28 Due to the unique electron-donating effect of the NHCs22,29,30 and the reported thermal stabilities of ruthenium carbene complexes,31,32 ancillary ligands incorporated with NHC ligands were introduced in the photosensitizers to study their sensitizing properties in DSSCs. The following design and examination of NHC-pyridine based ancillary ligands with various substituents could allow us to have a better understanding of how the molecular structures affect the photovoltaic performances. One of the possible avenues for the successful design of photosensitizers is the tuning of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the dyes, through modifying the ancillary ligands and their substituents.3,11,12 An ancillary ligand of ruthenium sensitizers bearing an imidazole-based carbene33,34 should have suitable ground- and excited-state energy levels for the injection of electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode and regeneration after electron donation. In addition, the strong electron donating capability of the NHC in the ancillary ligand, along with the two NCS ligands might facilitate the electron flow towards the nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductor surface. Herein, we report three electronically unsymmetrical imidazole-pyridine-based carbene photosensitizers (Fig. 1), which yielded photovoltaic efficiencies (η) of up to 7.24%, compared to that of N719 dye (8.63%), fabricated and measured under the same conditions.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and X ray structure
As shown in Fig. 1, the three new sensitizers [CiPoR (1), CifPoR (2) and CifPR (3)] and derivative 4 were synthesized and their structures were characterized using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The stepwise synthetic strategy towards the NHC–pyridine ruthenium dyes CiPoR (1) and CifPoR (2) are illustrated in Scheme 1. The ligands 6 and 7 were obtained through selective coupling of 2,6-difluoropyridine (5) with 1-hexanol and subsequent treatment with imidazole, followed by alkylation with 1-bromooctane and 3,5-difluorobenzyl bromide, respectively.35,36 The imidazole salts 6 and 7 were reacted with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in the presence of silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) in CH2Cl2 and then with 4,4′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine to yield the corresponding ruthenium–chloride complexes.37 The resulting chlorides were treated with KSCN in a solution of H2O and DMF at 80 °C to afford the corresponding ruthenium–thiocyanide complexes 8 and 9.9,11Hydrolysis of the esters 8 and 9 were carried out in H2O/DMF in the presence of KOH to give the desired sensitizers CiPoR (1) and CifPoR (2), respectively.

Sensitizer CifPR (3) was prepared from ester 4 using a method similar to that described for the synthesis of dye 1 (see Scheme S1 in the ESI†). To confirm the molecular geometry of the CifPR (3), we have grown dark red single crystals of its corresponding ester 4 (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of complex 4 revealed slightly distorted octahedral geometry around the ruthenium metal atom, indicated by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis. (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†). Except for the Ru –N(7) bond length, all other Ru–N bond lengths range from 2.039–2.068 Å, which is in the range that has been reported for typical bis(bipyridyl) ruthenium complexes.38–40 The Ru–N(pyridine) bond [Ru(1)–N(7), 2.111(4) Å] positioned trans to the NHC carbon atom is longer than that [Ru(1)–N(6), 2.051(5) Å] positioned trans to the NCS ligand. This can probably be attributed to the trans influence of the NHC ligand. The Ru–C(carbene) bond [Ru(1)–C(8)] of the ester 4 is located trans to one of pyridine nitrogen atoms (N7) of the 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine anchoring ligand. The Ru–C(carbene) bond [2.004(5) Å] is the shortest among all the ruthenium metal bonds and its distance indicates that this bond is a single bond featuring back-donation.
Absorption properties
The electronic absorption spectra of CiPoR (1), CifPoR (2) and CifPR (3) in CH3CN/tBuOH are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of the CifPR dye shows two bands centred around 384 nm [molar absorption coefficient (ε) = 0.88 × 104 M−1 cm−1] and 537 nm (ε = 0.60 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and a distinct shoulder at ca. 600 nm extending to 800 nm, which are due to metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions. The absorption bands of the CiPoR and CifPoR dyes are similar to those of the CifPR dye. In comparison to the N719 dye, these dyes exhibited a significant decrease in the molar extinction coefficient (Table 1). Although carbene based ruthenium dyes showed a similar molar extinction coefficient, the devices fabricated with CiPoR, CifPoR and CifPR resulted in different power conversion efficiencies. These results indicate that in the case of NHC-pyridine ruthenium sensitizers the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies and the intensities of the absorption bands in the UV-vis spectra might not be interrelated.19 These carbene complexes (featuring strong σ donors) exhibit low molar absorption coefficients at ca. 537–541 nm, but they provide comparable photoelectric conversion efficiencies to that of the N719 dye. Nevertheless, the relationships between the molar absorption coefficients and the photoelectric conversion efficiencies for metal-π-conjugation systems and metal-with-strong-σ-donor systems still need to be further evaluated.

Electrochemical properties
To further investigate whether the HOMO and LUMO of this new class of sensitizers match well with the redox potential of I−/I3− and the lower limit of the conduction band in TiO2, we determined their energy levels from their UV-vis absorption spectra and the cyclic voltammetry measurements. Table 1 reveals that the HOMO energy level of the CifPR dye is identical to that of the N719 dye. However, compared to the CifPR dye, further addition and/or changing of the substitution on the ancillary ligands of the CifPoR and CiPoR sensitizers shifted the oxidation potentials by 0.02 and 0.06 eV, respectively, thus destabilizing the HOMO energy levels of both sensitizers. The energy difference between the LUMO of the CifPR dye and the TiO2 film is smaller than that of the N719 dye, indicating stabilization of the LUMO energy level by 0.03 eV. Compared to the N719 dye, the LUMO of CifPoR was identical whereas the LUMO of the CiPoR dye was destabilized by 0.03 eV. Nevertheless, the LUMO energy levels of these dyes are sufficiently high compared to that of the TiO2 film, suggesting that electron injection from the excited dyes into the TiO2 conduction band is energetically favourable.
Performances of dye-sensitized solar cells
As shown in Fig. 3, the photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves and IPCEs of DSSCs with the CiPoR, CifPoR, CifPR and N719 sensitizers were recorded under irradiation with AM 1.5 simulated sunlight at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, while pertinent performance data are summarized in Table 1. As reported, increasing the film thickness resulted in an increase of the current density.41 Therefore, the thickness of the TiO2 electrode with a second scattering layer was optimized to around 15 μm. The solar cell of the CiPoR dye showed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.46 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 740 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.697, yielding 6.43% overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η). Interestingly, the modification by replacing the octyl chain of the CiPoR dye with the 3,5-difluorobenzyl group showed an 8% increase for CifPoR in the Jsc. Furthermore, the removal of the alkoxyl group from the pyridine unit of the CifPoR dye exhibited further enhancement in the conversion efficiency (η = 7.24%) for CifPR with photovoltaic parameters of Jsc = 13.44 mA cm−2, Voc = 770 mV and FF = 0.700. The constant increase in the conversion efficiency of these sensitizers with increasing Jsc and Voc values indicates the structural sensitivity of the NHC-pyridine based ruthenium sensitizers. When compared to the N719-sensitized cell (8.63%), the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the DSSC with CifPR sensitizer (7.24%) was found to be lower, most probably due to a smaller short-circuit current density. The photocurrent action spectra of the CiPoR, CifPoR, CifPR and N719-based devices are shown inset to Fig. 3. The IPCEs of the ruthenium complexes show broad features covering a large part of the visible spectrum from 350 nm to 800 nm, indicating a great potential to use these types of complexes as photosensitizers for DSSCs. Although the IPCE data of devices fabricated with these dyes are not closely related to the UV absorption spectra of these compounds, they show excellent agreement with their respective efficiencies (η). The photoaction spectra indicate that the complexes act as efficient sensitizers with a plateau between 500–550 nm regions with the maxima in the range of 45–61%. Furthermore, the IPCE curve of the device fabricated with the CifPR dye is slightly broad and red-shifted in the region from 675–770 nm.

Conclusions
In this study, we report on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of a novel series of ruthenium complexes with NHC-pyridine functionalized ancillary ligands exhibiting good cell conversion efficiencies. These dyes were obtained using simple synthetic strategies, amenable to prepare suitable quantities of various NHC-pyridine based sensitizers to evaluate their photoelectric properties. The minor structural modifications of the NHC-pyridine ligand around the metal have been found to affect the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency. We believe that such NHC-pyridine ligands, with appropriate substituents, might become alternative components in the engineering of ruthenium complexes and the resulting sensitizers could be attractive candidates for solar-cell applications. More detailed studies of the systematic optimization of carbene-based dyes with different pH values, complexes as tetra-butyl ammonium salts and doping conditions of these promising sensitizers will be published in due course.
Experimental
General methods
Reagents and starting materials were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, Fluka, Merck, Alfa Aesar, Acros and Matrix and used without further purification. The N719 dye was obtained from Solaronix. HPLC grade CH2Cl2, CH3CN and DMF were further dried using a patented solvent purifier (VAC 103991, Vacuum Atmospheres). The characterization of the intermediates and sensitizers was carried out by 1H and 13C NMR spectra using a Bruker 300 or 500 MHz spectrometer. UV-vis spectra have been recorded on Shimadzu UV3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry measurements were performed using a JMS-700 HRMS spectrometer.

Electrochemical measurement

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed using a CHI 627 C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments) and an electrochemical setup consisting of a conventional single-compartment three-electrode cell, with a silver wire (Ag/AgNO3 in acetonitrile) as the reference electrode, a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode and a Pt wire as the counter-electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte. For calibration, ferrocene was added as the internal reference. A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was typically used to record the cyclic voltammograms of CiPoR, CifPoR, CifPR and N719.
Preparation of TiO2 electrodes and DSSC devices
The preparation of the TiO2 nanoparticles was carried out by hydrothermal process using titanium(IV) n-butoxide [Ti(O-Bu)4] as the starting precursor and acetic acid (CH3COOH) as the peptizer. The reagent Ti(O-Bu)4 (ACROS, 99%) was added into 2 M aqueous CH3COOH at room temperature to initiate the reaction. The resulting mixture was then stirred vigorously for 5 d, until the formation of a homogeneous solution. After that, the above solution was transferred to an autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 5 h. Finally, the obtained TiO2 colloid solution was dried at 150 °C for 8 h. The resulting TiO2 nanoparticles were pure-anatase phase (a-TiO2 NPs), with an irregular polyhedral structure with an average diameter of 15–20 nm, which was confirmed by XRD and TEM analysis. To prepare the TiO2 electrode, doctor-blade technique was used by spreading the TiO2 paste onto fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, Hartford Glass; sheet resistance: 8 Ω/□; transmittance ≧ 80%; HAZE 5%). The TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing the a-TiO2 nanopowders with a mixture of distilled water, acetylacetone, polyethylene glycol (MW 20,000) and Triton X-100. Extensive stirring was performed to ensure the complete dispersion of the TiO2 NPs. Subsequently, the TiO2 electrodes were dried in air and heated at 100 °C for 15 min, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min.
A second layer (TiO2 scattering layer) was coated using a TiO2 paste containing a larger size of TiO2 purchased from Yong-Zhen Technomaterial (200–300 nm; QF-1125F). The average TiO2 film thickness was 15 μm, measured using an Alpha-step profiler (Perthometer S2). The resulting TiO2 electrode was scraped to an active area of 0.25 cm2 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm), followed by heat treatment at 80 °C. The electrodes were then immersed in solutions containing 3 × 10−4 M N719, CiPoR, CifPoR and CifPR in 1:1 CH3CN/tBuOH (v/v) for 36 h. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by sputter-deposition of 20-nm-thick Pt layers onto FTO substrates using a Hitachi E-1045 ion sputter. Before assembling the DSSCs, two holes were drilled on the counter electrodes. The Pt electrodes were then placed over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes. The edges of the cells were sealed with Surlyn 1702 (Dupont; thickness: 125 μm) spacer at 100 °C. To complete the DSSC fabricattion, the electrolyte was injected into the intervening space between the TiO2 and Pt electrodes through the two holes, which were then covered with a microscope slide and sealed with Surlyn 1702. The electrolyte comprised of 0.5 M Lithium Iodide (LiI), 0.05 M Iodide (I2), 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile (CH3CN).

          DSSC performance measurements
The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley model 2400 source measuring unit. An A-class solar simulator of 300-W Xenon light source (Oriel, #91160) with an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel, #81094) was used. The light intensity at the cell measuring position was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using an NREL-calibrated monocrystalline silica solar cell (PVM134 reference cell, PV Measurement, Inc.). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured by an equipment system, comprised of a 150-W Xenon lamp (Oriel, #66902), a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 130) and Keithley model 2400.
