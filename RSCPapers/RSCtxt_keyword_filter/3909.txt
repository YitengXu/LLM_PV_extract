    , Accepted 4th May 2007First published on 18th May 2007AbstractThe photovoltaic performance of liquid electrolyte and solid-state dye sensitized solar cells, employing a squarilium methoxy cyanide dye, are evaluated in terms of interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Dye adsorption to the metal oxide film resulted in a mixed population of aggregated and monomeric sensitizer dyes. Emission quenching data, coupled with transient absorption studies, indicate that efficient electron injection was only achieved by the monomeric dyes, with the aggregated dye population having an injection yield an order of magnitude lower. In liquid electrolyte devices, transient absorption studies indicate that photocurrent generation is further limited by slow kinetics of the regeneration of monomeric dye cations by the iodide/iodine redox couple. The regeneration dynamics are observed to be too slow (≫ 100 µs) to compete effectively with the recombination of injected electrons with dye cations. In contrast, for solid-state devices employing the organic hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD, the regeneration dynamics are fast enough (≪ 1 µs) to compete effectively with this recombination reaction, resulting in enhanced photocurrent generation.
Introduction
Ruthenium complexes have attracted much interest in the area of molecular solar cells due to their exceptional photophysical properties.1 Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on ruthenium polypiridine complexes such as cis-dithiocyanatobis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (called N3) and trithiocyanato(4,4′,4″-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (black dye) have given the best light-to-energy conversion efficiencies.2 Over the past decade, most studies have focused on changes in the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the complexes affected by the substitution or replacement of the pyridine rings by electron donor or aliphatic ligands, in order to control the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the complex and, thereby, improve the device performance.3 However, despite the broad metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band of these ruthenium complexes, which covers a wide spectral range from the UV to the visible region of the solar spectra, the lack of absorption in the near infrared region and the need for higher molecular extinction coefficients in the visible are still major challenges for researchers.
Recently there has been an increasing interest in the development of organic dyes,4 which appear to be also promising due to their outstanding photophysical properties. Organic dyes present higher molar extinction coefficients when compared with ruthenium complexes. This property allows efficient light harvesting to be achieved with thinner mesoporous metal oxide films. This advantage is particularly important for DSSCs employing solid-state hole transport materials, where efficient charge collection has only been demonstrated for film thickness of the order of 2 µm.4 For this reason organic dyes are an interesting approach for solid-state dye sensitized solar cells. Several groups have focused on the development of pure organic dyes4 such as coumarines, merocyanines, perylenes, hemicyanines, indolines and polyene dyes. Among them, indoline and thiophene dyes with an outstanding efficiency of ca. 8%, are so far the most efficient organic dyes for DSSCs.4a,4c However, many organic dyes have a tendency of forming molecular aggregates on the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles, which it has been suggested can result in a decrease in device efficiency. While the formation of molecular aggregates has been intensively studied and the low photocurrent has been usually assigned to intermolcular quenching,5 rather little attention has been placed on interfacial electron transfer kinetics of such organic DSSC devices. For example, cyanine dyes have been extensively explored as near infrared dyes for DSSCs5c,6 alongside other optoelectronic applications such as optical data storage7 and xerography.8 In fact, during our investigation, similar cyanine molecules were used as sensitizers for DSSCs.9
In this paper, we report the synthesis and study of the interfacial electron transfer dynamics for a cyanine dye derivative (MSqb) (Scheme 1) adsorbed onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 film. The organic dye shows an absorption band edge shifted to the red region (∼700 nm), obtained by expanding the π-conjugation system, and in addition the insertion of methoxy groups on the molecular structure to achieve the appropriate redox potentials to allow efficient charge regeneration from the electrolyte. Our aim is not only to study the effect of the dye structure upon the electron injection yield but also on the dye regeneration dynamics. Our data indicates that the efficiency of this regeneration reaction may be a critical factor in limiting the efficiency in organic dye sensitized solar cells.

Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The solvents used were of HPLC degree and those for electrochemical measurements were previously degassed with argon. Transparent conducting glass (TCO, F-doped SnO2, 14Ω cm−2) was purchased from Hartford Glass Company Inc. and washed with water and soap, ethanol and acetone successively under sonication for at least 10 min prior to utilization.
Synthesis of the squarilium methoxy cyanide dye
The squarilium methoxy cyanide dye was obtained following previous literature reports.9a All reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. A brief description of the procedure is described as follows:

5-Methoxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indol (1). 
4-Methoxyphenylhydrazine hydrochloride (4.37 g, 25 mmol) and 3-methyl-2-butanone (6.5 mL, 60 mmol) were refluxed in CH3COOH (80 mL) for 5 h. The red solution was neutralized with KOH at 0 °C. The mixture was then extracted with Et2O. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, Hexane–Et2O) to afford 1 (3,78 g, 80%) as a yellow solid.

1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): d 7.42 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 6.83 (m, 1H), 6.80 (d, J = 2.6 Hz, 1H), 3.82 (s, 3H), 2.24 (s, 3H), 1.28 (s, 6HH).
HRMS (FAB): Calc. for C12H15NO 190.1232; found 190.1235.



N-(p-Carboxybenzyl)-5-methoxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indol quaternary salt (2). 
A mixture of 1 (1.89 g, 10 mmol), p-chloromethyl benzoic acid (1.76 g, 10.1 mmol) and o-dichlorobenzene was refluxed under argon at 110° for 12 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the resulting solid was re-dissolved in the minimum amount of acetonitrile. A black dense oil was obtained. Acetone was then added until a precipitate appeared. The solid was then filtered off and washed with acetone to yield the pure product as a brown solid (1.4 g, 38%).

1H NMR (acetonitrile-d3, 300 MHz): d 7.92 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 6.83 (s, 1H), 6.81 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 3.82 (s, 3H), 2.24 (s, 3H), 1.28 (s, 6H).
HRMS (FAB): Calc. for C20H22NO3 324.1600; found 324.1601.


MSqb. 
Compound 2 (0.72 g, 2 mmol) and squaric acid (0.115 g, 1 mmol) were heated in an mixture of butanol (9 mL)–toluene (9 mL) with pyridine as a catalyst for 6 h. The solvent was evaporated and acetonitrile was added until a precipitate appeared. The precipitate was then filtered to obtain the pure product without further purification (green solid, 0.42 g, 58%). MP = 278 °C.

1H NMR (dmso-d6, 300 MHz): d 7.92 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 4H), 7.29 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 4H), 7.22 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, 2H), 7.19 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 6.86 (dd, J = 8.8 and 2.5 Hz, 2H), 5.66 (s, 2H), 5.43 (br. s, 4H), 3.77 (s, 6H) and 1.71 (s, 12H). HRMS (FAB): Calc. for C44H40N2O8 724.278; found 724.280.

Instruments
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrophotometer model 2101 PC. In the case of transparent 4 µm methoxy cyanide dye sensitized TiO2 films (MSqb/TiO2), the blank was obtained using identical dye-free mesoporous TiO2 films to correct the light scatter phenomena.
Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured using an Aminco Bowman spectrofluorometer model with a support for solid films. Fluorescence emission decays were recorded using an Edinburgh Instrument picosecond pulsed laser diode with a nominal wavelength of 635 nm (instrument response 350 ps). Transient absorption measurements were recorded as reported before.10 Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in dry solvents containing 1 mM of the cyanide dye and 0.1 M of dry tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte. Reference electrode Ag/AgCl; working electrode and counter electrode, Pt; scan rate 100 mV s−1; temperature 25 °C.
Squarilium methoxy cyanide dye sensitized TiO2 films (MSqb/TiO2)
Nanocrystalline TiO2 and ZrO2 particles and the mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 films were prepared as reported before.10 The 4 µm thick transparent TiO2 films were used for characterizations such as spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements. Double-layer mesoporous TiO2 films (8 µm) were employed for photovoltaic measurements with an additional layer of 4 µm thick scatter TiO2 particles (diameter ca. 100 nm). The TiO2 films were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. The film thicknesses were measured using a surface profiler model XP1 profilometer, Ambios Technology. The films were cut into pieces of 1 cm2 with an active area of 0.160 cm2 and immersed in a dye solution for at least 5 h. The dye solution (0.5 mM) was prepared in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile–4-tert-butyl alcohol with a volume ratio of 1 : 1. The electrolyte for MSqb liquid dye sensitized solar cells (Msqb/DSSCs) comprised tetra-butyl ammonium iodide 0.6 M (2.216 g), LiI 0.1 M (0.134 g), I2 0.1 M (0.253 g), and 4-tert-butyl pyridine 0.5 M (0.676 g) in 10 mL of acetonitrile, HPLC degree. This electrolyte was introduced through holes drilled in the counter electrode, which were sealed immediately with a microscope cover slide. For solid-state Msqb devices (MSqb/s-DSSCs) we employed spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor [chemical name: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methyloxyphenylamine)9,9′spirobifluoreno]. Several salts and additives such as tert-butyl pyridine, lithium bis-trifluorosulfinimid [Li(CF3SO2)2N] and the chemical dopant tris(p-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate, [N(p-C6H4Br)3][SbCl6]. A thin layer of evaporated gold was used as the counter electrode.
Light-to-energy conversion measurements
The I–V measurements for liquid based MSqb/DSSCs were realized using an Oriel© 250 W Xenon lamp with the appropriate Oriel© filters to simulate the desired 1.5 AM solar spectrum and a Keithley© 2400 source meter. I–V measurements for solid-state DSSCs have been carried out using a Steuernagel© constant 575 solar simulator and a Keithley© 2400 source meter. Calibration of this system has been carried out by comparative measurements of DSSCs with a Spectrolab© X-10 solar .
Results and discussion
UV-Vis absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of MSqb in solution and for the MSqb/TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the MSqb has a well-defined spectrum with a maximum at λ = 655 nm and a shoulder at λ = 600 nm when dry pure acetonitrile (ACN) is used as a solvent. As reported before,5a we assign this spectrum to the non-aggregated form of MSqb. The use of other solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dichloromethane (DCM) induces the formation of J- and H-aggregated dimers for MSqb dye (data not shown).
 Fig. 1  The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the monomer as the aggregated form of the MSqb (H-aggregate). 
The absorption spectrum of the MSqb sensitized TiO2 film shows clear evidence for significant aggregation of the MSqb dye. It is apparent that the absorption of the MSqb/TiO2 film has an absorption peak at λ = 600 nm unlike the MSqb dye in ACN. This spectrum is indicative of the presence of H-type MSqb aggregates. The residual peak at 650 nm is assigned to a sub-population of monomeric dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2, as evidenced by emission data shown below.
Luminescence and electrochemistry measurements
Emission data for the MSqb dye were obtained employing non-injecting mesporous ZrO2 films. Absorption spectra for MSqb/TiO2 and MSqb/ZrO2 were indistinguishable .The emission spectra of MSqb/ZrO2 films revealed a λmaxem = 706 nm. The corresponding excitation spectrum for this film exhibits a well defined band at 650 nm, corresponding to the absorption maximum of monomeric MSqb dyes, but a negligible contribution from the aggregated dye absorption band—indicative of rapid non-radiative quenching of photogenerated excited states in the dye aggregates.
The emission properties of the MSqb are summarized in Table 1.

The transient luminescence studies confirmed efficient electron injection for the MSqb sensitized TiO2 films, as shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Time resolved single photon counting decays of emission from MSqb sensitized on ZrO2 [black, (a)] and TiO2[grey, (b)]. The acquisition time for both samples was 600 seconds, λex = 635 nm and λem = 710 nm. Laser power at λex = 635 nm, 20 nJ cm−2. 
This comparison shows the transient luminescence decay of MSqb sensitized TiO2 and ZrO2 films, normalized to the same number of absorbed photons. ZrO2 film was employed as a control film, as the relatively high conduction band edge of this material prevents electron injection, consistent with the long excited lifetime observed for dyes adsorbed to this film. It can be noted that when compared to the control ZrO2 films, the MSqb luminescence is strongly quenched on the TiO2 film, consistent with efficient electron injection. In addition, despite the lower emission quantum yield of the MSqb/ZrO2 films, when compared to acetonitrile solution, a double exponential decay with a component of τ1 = 0.71 ns and τ2 = 1.2 ns was measured, which is in agreement with MSqb in ACN solution that also shows multi-exponential behaviour with τ1 = 0.6 ns and τ2 = 2.1 ns (Table 1). According to the steady-state emission spectra of the MSqb/ZrO2 film illustrated in Fig. 3, we have assigned the emission decay to the non-aggregated forms on the MSqb/ZrO2. We are aware that lower excitation wavelengths (λex < 635 nm) will be desirable to further prove our hypothesis by exciting the aggregates. Unfortunately, fast-pulsed laser diodes between 550 to 620 nm were not available in our instrument. Nonetheless, as illustrated elsewhere on the manuscript, we demonstrated that electron injection mainly occurs from monomers by using incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements.

Cyclic voltammograms were performed to determine the ground state oxidation potential for the MSqb dye. The oxidation potential of MSqb was found to be 0.451 V vs. SCE. From the MSqb/ZrO2 emission spectra we can consider that E0-0 = 1.8 eV which is the energy difference between the ground state oxidation potential [E0 (D+/D)] and the excited-state oxidation potential [E0 (D*/D+)] of the MSqb dye.
From this numbers we can estimated the excited-state oxidation potential to be ∼−1.35 vs. SCE, which is more negative than the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band edge4b estimated to be located at ∼−0.74 V vs. SCE suggesting that electron injection should be possible.
An analysis of the electronic structure of MSqb in vacuo was undertaken employing DFT calculations using the Spartan© 06 program package. A schematic representation of the molecular orbitals is illustrated in Fig. 4. The calculated energy for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Msqb was −4.47 eV while for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) the energy value found was −2.26 eV. Hence, as a result of these calculations, a HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.2 eV can be determined, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value obtained for E0-0.

Despite the high emission quenching observed in the luminescence experiments described above, the efficiencies of the liquid MSqb based DSSCs are low. We investigate such issues further measuring incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra.
As can be observed in Fig. 5, the IPCE shows mainly injection of electrons from the non-aggregated dyes of the MSqb/TiO2 film (λmax = 670 nm). On the other hand, it is well established that to achieve high electron injection yields, the electron injection rate must be fast enough to avoid kinetic competition with the de-excitation of the excited states (Fig. 6).

Katoh et al. have studied the electron transfer kinetics in TiO2 and ZnO sensitized films with coumarine dyes and they have observed ultra-fast (<150 fs) kinetics for the electron injection reaction.11 We have shown a high electron injection yield from the non-aggregated MSqb into the CB (conductive band) of TiO2. Moreover, the redox potential of the oxidized dye should accept electrons from the I− ions regenerating the ground state of the dye (Fig. 6) as the energetic driving force for the regeneration of the dye ground state is adequate. In order to seek further, we decided to perform laser transient absorption studies to investigate: (1) the electron recombination dynamics between the light induced MSqb cation and the injected electrons at the TiO2 surface and (2) the regeneration reaction between the electrolyte and the oxidized MSqb dye in the device.
Laser transient absorption measurements
The primary reason to use the extended carboxylated π system was to increase the UV-Vis band edge in the infrared region of the spectra, but also to achieve a controlled separation of the organic dye from the TiO2 surface. We have previously demonstrated, using ruthenium based dyes, the relationship between electron recombination dynamics and the HOMO distance of the anchored molecule.3a,12
The presence of the benzene ring as a spacer on the MSqb dye results in a ∼7 Å separation of the charged species to the nanoparticle surface. The DFT theoretical calculations described before illustrate that either the HOMO or the LUMO orbitals of MSqb are delocalised on the aromatic backbone of the molecule, in contrast with the ruthenium dye where the HOMO is situated mainly on the axial ligands and the LUMO orbital on the carboxyl bipyridine which anchor the dye to the TiO2 surface. The decay upon induced light absorption was monitored following laser excitation of the dye sensitized TiO2 film, in the absence of any applied bias or redox active electrolyte. Fig. 7 illustrates the charge recombination decay for MSqb on TiO2. The estimated half time, t50%, for MSqb/TiO2 is ∼0.1 ms.
 Fig. 7  Transient absorption data monitoring the electron recombination dynamics for the MSqb/TiO2 film. The inset shows the transient absorption spectra for the MSqb/TiO2 film monitored at 0.1 ms after excitation at 650 nm. 
This result is in good agreement with the recombination versus HOMO distance dependence observed for the Ru(dcbpy)2Cl2 complex (dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) with a distance of ∼7.4 Å, reported previously by Clifford et al.12a (ESI, Fig 1S‡). However, this value indicates that the electron recombination reaction is ∼10 times faster when compared with the ruthenium based dye N719 (chemical name: cis-bis(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipiridine-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) ditetrabutylammonium salt). This faster recombination cannot by itself explain the unexpected low efficiency of liquid MSqb DSSCs, the 0.1 ms half time still being slower than the regeneration half time observed for N719 in typical acetonitrile based electrolytes (∼1 µs).
This observation therefore raises the issue of whether the regeneration dynamics in MSqb DSSCs may be significantly slower than N719 based devices, potentially resulting in the observed cells’ lower performance. We have previously demonstrated13 that the presence of the I−/ I3− redox electrolyte induces, upon light excitation of the dye sensitized TiO2 film, a biphasic transient decay with a fast phase, assigned to the dye cation electron recombination kinetics, and a slow phase, assigned to the formation of I2−, with an estimated half time of t50%
					≈ 0.3 s for N719 (ESI Fig. 2S‡). However, the transient absorption data observed following excitation of the Msqb/TiO2 film in the presence the redox electrolyte strongly indicate a negligible yield of I2− (Fig. 8).

The absence of I−2 yield in the kinetics can be understood in terms of kinetic competition between the recombination reaction [Fig. 6, reaction (4), kRC] and the electron regeneration of the oxidized dye by the redox couple [Fig. 6, reaction (5), kRG]. Under normal conditions of device operation for N719 dye sensitized solar cells, kRG

					≈
					kRC and hence the back electron transfer reaction (4) limits the device performance. We have recently suggested the presence of an intermediate mechanism for dye sensitized solar cells, resulting in complex formation between the dye cation and the electrolyte, potentially necessary for successful regeneration dynamics.14 Although it has been only demonstrated in the case of ruthenium based DSSCs, we would like to stress that, in the case of organic dyes, it is an important issue to take into account for the design of organic DSSCs since the cation is only formed on the non-aggregated dyes as demonstrated in this work. Further to prove that the results described above are not mainly due to the lack of enough driving force between the oxidized dye and the redox electrolyte, we used an organic molecule as a hole conductor that has lower oxidation potential than our liquid redox electrolyte and we performed identical experiments. Schmidt-Mende et al. have reported a striking 4% solid-state solar cell using an indoline dye and spiro-OMeTAD as a molecular hole conductor which approaches the efficiencies obtained for such a dye when a liquid iodine/iodide electrolyte is employed (η
					≈ 8% under 100 mW cm−2 1.5 AM irradiation) and improves the efficiency reported for ruthenium based solid-state DSSCs.15 Interested by these results and the fact that the solid-state MSqb DSSCs showed relative higher efficiencies for solid-state devices, we explored the kinetics for dye regeneration using the organic hole conductor molecule instead of the liquid redox electrolyte. Klug and coworkers have shown previously that the hole transfer from the oxidized dye to the organic hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD occurs on the 100 ps timescale regenerating the dye’s original ground state.16Fig. 9 shows the decay for the spiro-OMeTAD cation upon excitation of the MSqb/TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD film.
 Fig. 9  Transient absorption kinetics obtained for MSqb/TiO2/spiro-OMETAD film upon excitation at λex = 650 nm (laser pulse intensity 25–50 µJ cm−2) and monitoring at λprobe = 570 nm (black decay). As control sample an MSqb/TiO2 was employed (grey decay). 
As can be seen, a long-lived positive signal is observed when we probe at λ = 570 nm upon excitation at λ = 650 nm. This is in clear contrast with the spectrum recorded for MSqb/TiO2 (Fig. 7 inset) where a broad negative feature can be observed which we have assigned to the bleaching of the MSqb ground state. Hence, the positive signal can only be due to the formation of the spiro-OMeTAD cation. Unfortunately, the hole injection kinetics are not resolved on the time scale employed in our experiments. It is obvious that kRG

Conclusions
In summary, we directly addressed the role of the molecular aggregates on the injection kinetics for a sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film. We find that upon light excitation the electron injection only occurs from the monomers and the yield remains high (∼95% of electrons are injected into the CB of TiO2) despite the presence of H-aggregates on the film. Moreover, the steady-state luminescence and the IPCE experiments also showed that only the non-aggregated Msqb dyes are directly involved in the electron injection dynamics. On the other hand, kinetic competition between kRC and kRG is observed to be important when an iodine/iodide standard electrolyte is used, resulting in a significant reduction in the yield of the regeneration reaction and therefore low device performance due to the fast electron recombination kinetics for MSqb/TiO2 films. The laser transient spectroscopy data shows negligible changes due to the presence of the electrolyte on the Msqb recombination dynamics, indicating the lack of I2− formation in contrast to what it has been observed for other efficient dyes. However, an extensive interest in organic dye sensitized solar cells is currently under way and the use of solid hole conductor electrolytes where the regeneration dynamics (polymer electrolytes, small organic molecules, etc…) may result in significant improvement of device performance. Thus, our studies of charge recombination dynamics between the oxidized organic dye and the organic hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD, show a remarkable yield of hole transfer and hence, we expect that, for dyes which do not form a stable intermediate with the liquid electrolyte, it will be possible to achieve higher efficiencies for the solid-state version of the dye sensitized solar cells similar to the devices based on a liquid electrolyte.
