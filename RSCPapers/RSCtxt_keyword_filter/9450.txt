For the last three years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been dramatically improved from 9.7% to 22.1%; however, a poor long-term stability still limits the commercialization of PSCs. In this study, we explore the effect of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite (PRC) passivation layer on the chemical and thermal stability of PSCs. The PRC passivation layer shows superior protection performance due to improved hydrophobicity and increased complexity of the O2 or H2O diffusion pathway. Moreover, the excellent thermal conductivity of rGO facilitates heat dissipation through the PRC layer. When the PRC layer is coated, the aging of PSCs is significantly prevented even under extreme conditions of humidity (>75%) and temperature (∼85 °C). Consequently, the PCE of PRC-passivated PSCs exhibits a negligible change in air, temperature of 35 °C, and humidity of 40% for 1000 h. Our study offers a simple and robust way to fabricate long-term stable and highly efficient PSCs, thus providing a path to PSC commercialization.
Introduction
Solar energy has attracted huge attention as a promising alternative to fossil energy, which is regarded as a major source of greenhouse effect. However, to replace fossil fuels on a worthwhile scale, manufacturing costs of solar cells need to be decreased further and/or their power conversion efficiency needs to be increased more. Recently, an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = halogen ions) semiconductor has been found to be an excellent light absorber for highly efficient and economically viable solar cells. Halide perovskites have outstanding optical and electronic properties such as high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1),1,2 large carrier diffusion length (>1 μm),3 high carrier mobility (25 cm2 V−1 s−1),4 and suitable bandgap spanning the energy of visible and near-infrared light.5 In addition, a simple and cheap synthesis process can be applied to the large-scale production of halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Thus, this emerging hybrid solar cell has the potential to meet the urgent need for low-cost and high-efficiency power generation.
The first type of PSC was similar to liquid electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells except that it used the halide perovskite as the light absorber. Its power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 3.8%.6 However, the liquid electrolyte-based PSCs had a critical problem since the liquid electrolyte easily dissolved the halide perovskite. Later, the liquid electrolyte was substituted with a solid hole transport material (HTM), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs increased to 9.7%.7 A series of recent systematic studies have dramatically improved the material properties and processing techniques of the halide perovskite, leading to the emergence of PSCs with a PCE of 22.1%.8
Despite these advantages, the commercialization of PSCs is still challenging due to the poor long-term stability of the halide perovskite. When exposed to water, heat or visible light, the halide perovskite phase dissociates into iodide compounds and by-products. While easy degradation of the halide perovskite is a pressing and urgent issue, there are relatively few studies on improving the long-term stability of PSCs.
One way to increase the stability of PSCs is to modify the perovskite layer. Br ions are incorporated into the I− site of methyl ammonium lead iodide (MALI, CH3NH3PbI3) to form a more stable structure than pure MALI,6 and new organic–inorganic compositions such as (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 have been tested.9,10 In addition, the HTM layer of the solar cells has been modified to improve the stability of PSCs. Single-wall carbon nanotubes were added to the organic polymer matrix of HTM to help PSCs maintain their performance at a high temperature and humidity.11 The dopant-free tetrathiafulvalene derivative is reported to enhance the durability of PSCs since HTM does not contain deliquescent additives such as lithium compounds used in spiro-OMeTAD.12 Another very promising way to circumvent the degradation problem is to coat an additional passivation layer on the halide perovskite. An Al2O3 buffer layer between the perovskite layer and the metal electrode can reduce shunting degradation by inhibiting a direct contact between the metal electrode and the perovskite.13 When TiO2 nanoparticles are coated with a thin oxide shell of Sb2S3, Y2O3 and MgO, direct contact between TiO2 and perovskite interfaces is blocked, and the degradation rate of the perovskite is reduced.14–17 Moreover, several polymer-sealing materials such polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),18 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),19 and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)11,20 have been tested as an encapsulation layer for perovskite solar cells. While they show a reasonable level of an encapsulation effect, each polymer exhibits its own strengths and weaknesses. Previous studies suggest that a passivation layer of a single constituent has a limitation in meeting the chemical, thermal and mechanical requirements of the passivation material for PSCs. In this study, PMMA-based composites are systematically examined as encapsulation materials. PMMA is a well-known polymer of good mechanical strength and chemical durability. However, previous studies did not address its limitations, including easy water penetration and low thermal conductivity. The objective of this study is to provide multi-functional properties to an encapsulation layer of PSCs by producing a composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO).
Herein, we present a simple method of fabricating highly efficient PSCs that exhibit outstanding stability under humid and high-temperature conditions by coating a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite (PRC) passivation layer on the top surface of PSCs. While studies of rGO in the perovskite solar cells have been reported in the past, they have only focused on improving the charge collection behavior of perovskite solar cells by adding highly conductive rGO into the mesoporous titania matrix.21,22
In this study, the combination of rGO and PMMA creates a hydrophobic surface through interaction between hydrophobic PMMA and hydrophilic rGO surfaces.23,24 The stability of PSCs using PRC exceeds that of unpassivated PSCs or PSCs with a pure PMMA passivation layer. Implementation of the PRC passivation layer onto PSCs dramatically suppresses the degradation process because the diffusion pathway of H2O, O2 and other gas molecules become more complex in the PRC layer.24 Furthermore, high thermal conductivity of rGO makes heat dissipate faster through the PRC layer and improves the thermal stability of PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a PRC-coated PSC. The thicknesses of the perovskite layer and the PRC layer are 550 nm and ∼3.5 μm, respectively. The coating of the top PRC passivation layer does not damage the underlying components of the solar cells (HTM, perovskite and Au layers). This damage-free coating requires controlling the solute concentration in the coating solution because an organic solvent (pure chlorobenzene) can dissolve the HTM layer of PSCs. The effect of solute concentration is examined by changing the concentration of PMMA dissolved in chlorobenzene. In addition, we characterize the surface roughness of pure PMMA and PRC coating layers. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the results of surface profile measurements. Adding 1 wt% rGO to PMMA does not change the surface roughness of the encapsulation layer. Fig. S2 and S3† show J–V curves of PRC/PSCs coated with the coating solution with different PMMA concentrations (pure chlorobenzene, 10 wt% PMMA-dissolved chlorobenzene (PRC10), 20 wt% PMMA-dissolved chlorobenzene (PRC20) and 30 wt% PMMA-dissolved chlorobenzene (PRC30)).

A decrease in Jsc and Voc indicates that the solvent of the coating solution dissolves the HTM layer (spiro-OMeTAD) and decreases the PV performance. However, when the PMMA concentration exceeds a critical point (30 wt% PMMA), the coating process has a negligible impact on the PCE of PSCs.
Note that the passivation layer coating changes the wettability of the surface. The bare PSC surface exhibits hydrophilic surface properties with a contact angle (CA) of ∼44.7°, as shown in Fig. 1b. After a top passivation layer is coated, the surface of the PSC becomes hydrophobic. The CA of PRC/PSCs increases to 85.2°, which is higher than that of pure PMMA-coated solar cells (69.0°). We also perform the contact angle measurements as a function of the amount of rGO in the mixture film. As the concentration of rGO is increased, the contact angle of the film increases initially and then saturates at ∼85°. When the rGO concentration reaches above 1 wt%, the contact angle does not change significantly (Fig. S4†). An increase in the CA of PRC/PSCs suggests that the hydroxyl group of the rGO nanosheet attracts the carbonyl group of amphiphilic PMMA molecules, containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic groups. The electrostatic attraction between hydrophilic oxides and the oxygen-containing bonds of PMMA (CO and C–O) reorients methyl methacrylate (MMA).24,25 Hence, only hydrophobic components of PMMA are exposed to the surface of the oxide–PMMA composites. This reorientation of MMA explains an increase in the CA of the rGO-added PMMA.

Fig. 2 shows typical J–V curves of PSCs with and without a passivation layer. The mean values of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of bare PSC, PMMA and PRC/PSCs are summarized in Table 1. Under each experimental condition, we test 10 devices. Though PCEs of PMMA- and PRC layer-coated PSCs show slightly lower Jsc, Voc and FF than bare PSCs, an overall change of 5% is observed in PCE through passivation layer coating.

To observe the effect of the passivation layer on stability, we keep each sample in a very humid condition (humidity >75%, temperature: ∼25 °C) and track the change in PV performance for 500 h.

Fig. 3 shows the normalized efficiency and Jsc of PSC with and without the passivation layer. The bare PSCs show rapid degradation of PCE within 3 h. While the PCE of bare PSCs decreases by almost 50% in 3 h and becomes less than 1% in 500 h, the PSC with a passivation layer (PMMA, PRC) does not exhibit a significant change in Jsc and PCE for 100 h even under high humidity (Fig. 3a). A difference between pure PMMA and PRC layer appears when the PSCs are exposed to high humidity for longer than 100 h. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PCE of PSCs with the PMMA passivation layer gradually decreases and becomes 50% of the initial value after 500 h exposure. However, the PRC layer protects the PSC well in the very humid ambience, and only 10% decrease in PCE is observed during the 500 h exposure. PCE and Jsc of the PRC-coated PSCs exposed to humidity >75% for 500 h are 13.0% and 21.8 mA cm−2, respectively. Hydrophobic carbon particles have been used as an electrode for TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells. Repulsion of water by the carbon electrode enhances the chemical stability of the solar cells; however, the porous carbon electrode does not fully prevent the diffusion of water and oxygen molecules into the perovskite layer. Therefore, the efficiency of the solar cells is low (∼3%) under 70% humidity, which calls for a different design of the carbon protection layer.26

We also perform an accelerated degradation test by dipping PSCs in water for 5 min. Fig. 4 shows a photograph and J–V curve of PSCs soaked in water for 5 min at 25 °C. The PCE of bare PSCs dramatically decreases to 0.3% soon after they are submerged (Table 2). The PCE of PMMA/PSC exhibits a moderate decrease in water and decreases to 10.1% after 5 min of the water-dipping test. In contrast, the PRC coating demonstrates high waterproof performance, which is required for the passivation layer of PSCs. The PCE of the PRC/PSCs is as high as 14.6% after the PSCs are dipped in water for 5 min.

Aging of PSCs is attributed to the dissociation of the perovskite phase by moisture, polar solvents, oxygen, and UV radiation, which is explained through a series of the following reactions:27,28 [(CH3NH3+)PbI3]n + H2O ⇔ [(CH3NH3+)n−1(PbI3)n][H3O+] + CH3NH2(1) [(CH3NH3+)n−1(PbI3)n][H3O+] ⇔ HI + PbI2 + [(CH3NH3+)PbI3]n−1 + H2O(2) 4HI(aq) + O2(g) ⇔ 2I2(s) + 2H2O(l)(3) 2HI(aq) ⇔ H2(g) + I2(s)(4)
These reactions explain the change in the colour of PSCs in Fig. 4a. The bare PSC shows a colour change from dark brown to yellow in water due to dissociation of the halide perovskite (bandgap: ∼1.5 eV) into PbI2 (bandgap: ∼2.3 eV), organic components and other iodides. If the halide perovskite remains intact, PRC/PSC retains the dark brown colour of the perovskite phase. Fig. S4† shows the UV absorption spectra of PSCs that were dipped in water for 0, 15 and 600 s. The absorption spectrum of the as-fabricated PSC exhibits a dramatic change at 780 nm wavelength, which corresponds to the bandgap of the MALI layer in the PSC. The absorption spectrum of the bare PSC significantly decreases within 15 s of being dipped in water (Fig. S5a†). However, the absorption spectra of PSCs with the passivation layer (Fig. S5b†) do not show any change, which is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 4a. After 600 s, the absorption spectra of PMMA/PSC shift slightly, which indicates the infiltration of moisture into the MALI layer. Moisture inside MALI destabilizes the perovskite phase and reacts with the highly hygroscopic lithium ions in the HTM layer.11 Therefore, Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE decrease to 17.1 mA cm−2, 0.91 V, 0.65 and 10.1%, respectively. In contrast, the absorption spectra of PRC/PSC do not change at all, suggesting that the hydrophobic PRC coating successfully blocks the penetration of water into the PSCs and prevents it from water damage.
Next, we analyse how the morphology, structure and photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite phase changes in a humid environment. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of HTM/perovskite/TiO2/FTO and PRC/HTM/perovskite/TiO2/FTO films, which are placed under very humid conditions (humidity >75%, temperature ∼25 °C) for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min. Perovskites with a tetragonal structure were observed at 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.8° peaks corresponding to the planes of (110), (220) and (310). In HTM/perovskite/TiO2/FTO films, the diffraction peaks of PbI2 appear in less than 10 min and keep growing at the expense of the perovskite layer. When the PRC layer is coated, the peak intensities of the perovskite phase do not show a significant change. In addition, a small peak of PbI2 is observed after the sample is exposed to water droplets for 5 min.

(humidity >75%, temperature ∼25 °C) (b) XRD patterns of the PRC/HTM/perovskite/TiO2/FTO films stored in very humid condition for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min. (humidity >75%, temperature ∼25 °C) (♦; perovskite, *; PbI2, ∇; FTO). 
The effect of the PRC coating layer on the perovskite layer is also confirmed in the microstructure of the perovskite layer. When the film is exposed to water droplets in the absence of the passivation layer, voids are formed in the film and the top electrode ruptures, as shown in Fig. 6. As the perovskite phase transforms to PbI2, the organic components (CH3 and NH3) of the perovskite phase are released in the form of a gas, and voids are left in the film.28 A change in the morphology (i.e. the breakdown of large grains and the formation of fine pores) decreases the crystallinity, light absorption coefficient and carrier mobility of the perovskite layer. This, in turn, reduces the recombination resistance and shortens the carrier lifetime.29 However, when the perovskite film is coated with PRC, the microstructure of the perovskite layer is maintained, and a noticeable change is not observed.
 Fig. 6  Cross-sectional SEM image in very humid condition (humidity >75%, temperature ∼25 °C) (a) bare PSCs, (b) PRC/PSCs. 
Fig. S6† shows the PL intensity of the perovskite films with and without PRC under very humid conditions for 60 min. In the perovskite film without the passivation layer, the quantum yield of PL decreases quickly in humid ambience. This is related to the decay of the photogenerated carriers through a non-radiative way. The lower PL intensity suggests that PbI2 phase and voids in the aged samples trap the charge carriers, reduce the carrier lifetime and decrease the quantum yield of the layer.30 This is consistent with a decrease in Jsc of the aged perovskite solar cells (Fig. 3 and 5).
Another important parameter affecting the stability of PSCs is temperature. Exposure of PSCs to humid environment at high temperature accelerates their dissociation. Therefore, the effect of temperature on the stability of PSCs with the passivation layer is also examined. When the solar cell module is exposed to sunlight, the module heats up. If the thermal conductivity of the constituents of the cell module is low, heat is not dissipated and a difference between the module temperature (Tmodule) and ambient temperature (Tamb) can be as large as 45 °C at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance.31 For instance, for an ambient temperature of ∼40 °C, the temperature inside an amorphous silicon solar cell module can increase to ∼85 °C, and the degradation of the solar cell module can accelerate. Fig. 7a shows a change in PV performance at 85 °C (humidity ∼35%). The efficiency of bare PSC and PMMA/PSC gradually decreases by 50% and 60% in 96 h, which is attributed to the decomposition of the MALI phase.32,33 Even when PMMA is coated on the PSCs, the stability of the PSCs at high temperature is not improved. On the other hand, the degradation of PV performance at 85 °C is significantly suppressed in PRC/PSCs. After 100 h, the PCE of PRC/PSCs is 12.6%, which is about 80% of the initial PCE.
 Fig. 7  (a) Change in PCE of PSCs at 85 °C for 96 h (normalized using PCEs of as-fabricated cells) and infrared thermal camera image of (b) the PMMA layer-coated glass plate (PMMA/glass) and (c) the PRC layer-coated glass plate (PRC/glass), (d) surface temperature variation in PMMA/glass and PRC/glass (PMMA/glass and PRC/glass were placed on the hot plate at 93 °C and heated from the bottom of the glass plate). 
To study the origin of the high stability of the PRC-coated solar cells, two different characterization methods are used. First, the temperature profile of PRC/PSCs is compared with that of pure PSCs and PMMA/PSCs. Fig. 7b and c show the infrared thermal camera image of PMMA and PRC passivation layer/glass, which are placed on a hot plate at 95 °C. The average surface temperature of the top PMMA layer is ∼95 °C, which is approximately similar to that of the bottom glass. However, the addition of rGO to the PMMA layer lowers the average surface temperature to ∼91 °C. In addition, we measure the temperature of the PMMA and PRC layers, which are coated on the perovskite solar cells with an 80 nm-thick Au top electrode. Since the Au layer dissipates the heat of the perovskite and HTM layers well, the surface temperature of the polymer on the top of the Au electrode is lower than that on the top of the electrode-free region, as shown in Fig. S7.† The average surface temperature of the PMMA layer on the solar cell is ∼75 °C and the temperature difference between the Au electrode region and electrode-free region is ∼10 °C. On the other hand, the surface temperature of the PRC layer on the perovskite cells ranges from 58 °C to 63 °C at the centre of the solar cell. This result shows that the addition of thermally conductive rGO to PMMA decreases not only the average surface temperature but also the temperature variation in the encapsulation layer. In previous studies, an increase in thermal conductivity was also observed by mixing a small amount of rGO with the matrix polymer.34,35 Fast heat dissipation of the PRC coating partially explains why PRC/PSCs exhibit high thermal stability. Since the difference between the inside temperature of the PSCs and the ambience temperature is reduced, the integrity of the perovskite phase at high temperature is well maintained.
It is well known that the perovskite solar cells are not stable at high temperatures. However, a recent study has reported that a perovskite material (CH3NH3PbI3) fabricated in an oxygen- and moisture-free condition does not change its morphology and chemical composition at least for a short time until 150 °C. Thermally activated ion migration and shape change are observed at 150 °C or higher.36 This indicates that thermal degradation of the solar cells at 80–90 °C is related to other constituents of the perovskite solar cells, such as HTM. In Li+-doped spiro-OMeTAD, which is a common HTM material for the perovskite solar cells, dopants such as lithium-bis(trifluoro-methanesulphonyl)-imide salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) evaporate at around 85 °C.37 The evaporation of dopants in the HTM layer reduces the conductivity and suppresses the redox reaction, leading to the degradation of perovskite solar cells. To explain the degradation of the perovskite solar cells at 90 °C, we study the chemical stability of HTM by performing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis for undoped sprio-OMeTAD and (sprio-OMeTAD + LiTFSI + tBP) films (Fig. S8†). While the IR spectra of undoped sprio-OMeTAD films do not age substantially, those of (sprio-OMeTAD + LiTFSI + tBP) films change quickly. Note that only the absorbance modes at 1058, 1134, 1196 and 1347 cm−1, which are assigned as the vibration modes of the dopants (LiTFSI and tBP), degrade at 90 °C and 35% humidity.38 This indicates that the chemical instability of the perovskite solar cells below 100 °C is initiated by the undoping of Li+ in (sprio-OMeTAD + LiTFSI + tBP) films. Since the undoping of Li+ first inactivates the hole transport layer at 90 °C, the performance of the solar cells also decreases.
This is why the PRC layer dramatically improves the stability of the solar cells at 80–90 °C in this study. Fast dissipation of heat through the PRC layer minimizes the thermal damage of the HTM layer at 80–90 °C. Without the PRC layer, the dopants of the HTM layer easily evaporate and the energy conversion efficiency of the solar cell drops from 16% to 8% within 20 h. Given that the temperature of the solar cell can increase to 80 °C at the outside, the PRC layer has the potential to extend the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells by stabilizing the doped HTM layer.31
Second, we electrochemically test the corrosion behavior of cold rolled steel (CRS) coated with Au/HTM, PMMA/Au/HTM, and PRC/Au/HTM layers to quantitatively understand the enhancement of PSC stability by the PRC passivation layer. Corrosion current is obtained from Tafel plots.39 The intersection point between the extrapolated cathodic and anodic polarization curves provides their corrosion potential and current. The experimentally measured Tafel plots are shown in Fig. 8a, and the values of corrosion potential/current (Ecorr, Icorr), polarization resistance (Rp), and protection efficiency (PEF) are summarized in Table 3. The uncoated CRS electrode exhibits a corrosion potential (Ecorr) of 0.717 V and a corrosion current (Icorr) of 20.09 μA cm−2. Ecorr and Icorr of the Au/HTM-coated CRS are close to those of the uncoated CRS. However, Ecorr (−0.290 V) and Icorr (0.182 μA cm−2) of PMMA/Au/HTM-coated CRS are very different from those of uncoated CRS. When PRC/Au/HTM is coated on CRS, the change is more significant. Icorr is 0.141 μA cm−2 and Ecorr increases from −0.717 to −0.281 V. The overall protection efficiency (PEF) is evaluated by the following expression:40PEF = [RP−1 (uncoated) − RP−1 (coated)]/RP−1 (uncoated)where RP is the polarization resistance, evaluated from the Tafel plots.41 While PEF of Au/HTM is only 75.6%, those of PMMA/Au/HTM and PRC/Au/HTM film are 95.8% and 97.7%, respectively. Compared to pure HTM and PMMA, the dispersion of rGO in the PMMA layer improves the protection capability by increasing the hydrophobicity and the complex diffusion length of external molecules, as shown in Fig. 8b.

We also measure the long-term stability of PRC/PSCs in air with moderate humidity, as shown Fig. S9† (at temperature ∼35 °C and humidity ∼40%). The PV performance of bare PSCs deteriorates rapidly during the first 100 h aging and then gradually changes by 1000 h. In contrast, PRC/PSCs do not exhibit any change in PV performance. Their efficiency is maintained at ∼15.8% for 1000 h. These results demonstrate the superior protective properties of PRC coating and its potential as a passivation layer of PSCs, which is required for commercialization.
Experimental
Fabrication of PSCs
Patterned FTO glasses were sequentially cleaned in acetone, deionized water, and ethanol with sonication for 15 min. To prepare the TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2), 0.5 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol was coated on FTO at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrate was dried at 125 °C for 10 min and annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrate was treated in TiCl4 (0.05 M, aqueous) for 30 min at 70 °C. It was rinsed with deionized (DI) water for 5 min and annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. The mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle (mp-TiO2 NPs, sharechem) layer with ∼200 nm thickness was spin-coated onto the prepared bl-TiO2/FTO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s using a TiO2 paste that was diluted in ethanol (1:5.5 wt. ratio), and then annealed in the furnace at 500 °C for 1 h.
The MALI perovskite layer was fabricated using the typical CH3NH3I·PbI2·DMSO adduct method, as previously reported.42 We dissolved 1.0 M PbI2, CH3NH3I and DMSO in the same molar ratio (1:1:1) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature for 1 h. The CH3NH3I·PbI2·DMSO solution was coated on mp-TiO2 at 4000 rpm for 25 s and 500 μl of diethyl ether was dipped on the substrate in 10 s. After spinning, the substrates were dried at 65 °C for 3 min and then 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, a hole transport layer was formed by spin coating on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s, which was prepared by dissolving of spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene (36 mg ml−1), 14.4 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 8.8 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoro-methanesulphonyl)-imide salt (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile (360 mg ml−1). All processes were carried out under air atmosphere. Finally, Au electrodes were deposited by an e-beam evaporator at 0.3 Å s−1 deposition rate.
PMMA/rGO composite passivation layer
The rGO nanosheet was synthesized by a modified Hummers' method, as previously reported22 (Fig. S10†). To develop the PMMA/rGO composite passivation layer, PMMA (Mw ∼15000 g mol−1) was dissolved in chlorobenzene with various wt% (0, 10, 20, and 30 wt%) to minimize damage and then rGO was added (PMMA:rGO weight ratio 99:1). To avoid the aggregation, the solution was sonicated for 1 h and immediately coated on the PSCs at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
Characterizations
The micro-structures of the rGO and PSC were measured using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (eLINE). The absorption spectra of PSCs were analysed using a UV/vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The phase transformation of perovskite was measured using X-ray diffraction patterns. The thermal dispersion of the passivation layer was measured using an infrared thermal camera image. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the PSCs were evaluated using a potentiostat (CHI 660C, CH Instrument), under AM 1.5 condition simulated by a solar simulator (PV Measurements, Inc.). The AM 1.5 sunlight was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell. The PSCs were masked with a metal aperture defining the active area of 0.14 cm2. The humidity and temperature were controlled by dehumidifiers (21 pint) in a fume-hood at 40 ± 7%, 35 °C ± 5 °C. To obtain the very humid condition (humidity >75%), we kept the PSCs in the desiccator containing water. The electrochemical corrosion property was measured using a potentiostat (Ecorr in mV versus Ag/AgCl electrode). Tafel plots were obtained by scanning the potential from −1 to 0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV min−1.24
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that long-term stable and highly efficient PSCs can be simply fabricated by coating them with a PRC layer. The addition of a PRC layer significantly increases the stability of PSCs in humid and hot environments. When the PRC-coated PSCs are submerged in water for 5 min, the decrease in PCE is less than 10%. The PRC coating also improves the stability of PSCs at high temperatures. After being exposed to air with 35% humidity at 90 °C for 100 h, the PCE of the PRC-coated PSCs is still as high as 12.6%. The superior coating performance of the PRC is attributed to the ability of the rGO that blocks the diffusion of external molecules and promotes heat dissipation. When the PRC layer is coated, the MALI phase of PSCs is not decomposed at a high humidity or a high temperature. In air with 40% humidity, the PRC-coated PCSs with PCE of 15.8% exhibit no change in PCE for 1000 h. Thus, our study offers a facile and robust way to fabricate highly stable PSCs, thus paving way toward the commercialization of PSCs.
