    , Accepted 31st January 2020First published on 31st January 2020AbstractA novel black organoammonium iodoplumbate semiconductor, namely phenyl viologen lead iodide C22H18N2(PbI3)2 (PhVPI), was successfully synthesized and characterized. This material showed physical and chemical properties suitable for photovoltaic applications. Indeed, low direct allowed band gap energy (Eg = 1.32 eV) and high thermal stability (up to at least 300 °C) compared to methylammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI, Eg = 1.5 eV) render PhVPI potentially attractive for solar cell fabrication. The compound was extensively characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (performed on both powder and single crystals), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), UV-photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), FT-IR spectroscopy, TG-DTA, and CHNS analysis. Reactivity towards water was monitored through X-ray powder diffraction carried out after prolonged immersion of the material in water at room temperature. Unlike its methyl ammonium counterpart, PhVPI proved to be unaffected by water exposure. The lack of reactivity towards water is to be attributed to the quaternary nature of the nitrogen atoms of the phenyl viologen units that prevents the formation of acid–base equilibria when in contact with water. On the other hand, PhVPI's thermal stability was evaluated by temperature-controlled powder XRD measurements following an hour-long isothermal treatment at 250 and 300 °C. In both cases no signs of decomposition could be detected. However, the compound melted incongruently at 332 °C producing, upon cooling, a mostly amorphous material. PhVPI was found to be slightly soluble in DMF (∼5 mM) and highly soluble in DMSO. Nevertheless, its solubility in DMF can be dramatically increased by adding an equimolar amount of DMSO. Therefore, phenyl viologen lead iodide can be amenable for the fabrication of solar devices by spin coating as actually done for MAPI-based cells. The crystal structure, determined by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation, turned out to be triclinic and consequently differs from the prototypal perovskite structure. In fact, it comprises infinite double chains of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra along the a-axis direction with phenyl viologen cations positioned between the columns. Finally, the present determination of PhVPI's electronic band structure achieved through UPS and UV-Vis DRS is instrumental in using the material for solar cells.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of the exceptional performances of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPI)-based thin film photovoltaic devices, plenty of scientific and technological efforts have been devoted to the study of the so-called perovskite solar cells. This research activity stemmed from the seminal paper of Kojima et al.1 published in 2009. Thus, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite devices has risen from a mere 3.8% to nearly 24% in 2019,2 corresponding to a 6-fold increase over the last ten years. Needless to say, investigations have been focusing mostly on improving the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the devices and enhancing the stability of the materials.3 Regarding the degradation of perovskites, it is well known that MAPI suffers from serious thermal-thermodynamic stability issues.4–8 In addition, MAPI's high reactivity towards water results in the formation of solid PbI2 and methylammonium iodide solution through a hydrolysis reaction. Nonetheless, its desirable properties such as a direct band gap matching the maximum absorption requirements in the solar spectrum (∼1.5 eV), availability of affordable precursor materials, and solution-processability still make MAPI an ideal candidate for low-cost/high efficiency solar cells. Hence, different approaches spanning from the use of solid solutions with other cations like cesium and/or formamidinium9–12 to the encapsulation of the devices in specific polymers13 have been attempted in order to overcome MAPI's stability limitations. However, no long-term satisfactory solution has been found yet. The chemical/thermal/thermodynamic stability problems of MAPI can be ascribed mainly to the acid–base equilibria brought about by the methylammonium cation: (1) CH3NH3PbI3(s) ⇄ PbI2(s) + CH3NH2(g) + HI(g)(2)
The former (1) accounts for MAPI deterioration by water, and the latter (2) constitutes the principal thermal/thermodynamic degradation route at moderate temperatures (above 60 °C). In fact, the reaction CH3NH3PbI3(s) ⇄ PbI2(s) + NH3(g) + CH3I(g)(3)represents the most thermodynamically favored process leading to MAPI decomposition. Nevertheless, process (2) has been experimentally proven to be the dominant thermal degradation path up to at least 500 K because of the high activation energy involved in the C–N bond breaking.4–6
The acidity of (organo)ammonium cations has been found to affect profoundly the stability of the corresponding lead iodide perovskites.14,15 Thus, effective strategies to mitigate and eventually eliminate perovskite stability issues should rely on cations not associated with any acid–base equilibria. While the choice of inorganic cations is very limited (until now practically restricted to cesium), the use of organic moieties like quaternary ammonium cations allows for almost limitless combinations. Besides, the interaction between the Pb–I framework and the organic units can be modulated by appropriately picking out the substituent groups.
Viologen cations are considered to be particularly attractive owing to their commercial availability and ease of synthesis and the “tunability” of their electronic properties by varying the substituents on the N atoms. Iodoplumbates of methyl viologen,16 isopropyl viologen17 and N,N-dimethyl-9,10-bis(4-pyridyl)anthracene18 have already been reported to show interesting semiconducting properties. In particular, their band gap absorption seems to arise from charge transfer processes.17 Unfortunately, their band gap energies are too high to be used in solar devices. For instance, the lowest Eg of the series (for isopropyl viologen lead iodide) is 1.86 eV.
The present work introduces a simple methodology, based on commercially available precursors, for the synthesis of a novel, black iodoplumbate belonging to the viologen family, i.e. phenyl viologen lead iodide (PhVPI). A detailed chemical, structural, and spectroscopic characterization was carried out on the new material. UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy revealed an Eg (direct allowed) equal to 1.32 eV, making PhVPI the first viologen lead iodide possessing a band gap ideal for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, combined UPS/UV-Vis DRS analyses allowed for the determination of the salient parameters of PhVPI's electronic band structure (i.e. Fermi level, conduction band, and valence band energy edge positions) with respect to the vacuum level (i.e. absolute values). Finally, the material turned out to be insensitive to water, thermally stable up to at least 300 °C and solution processable. Such promising results indicate the potential of PhVPI as a possible alternative to MAPI.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials preparation
Lead(II) nitrate Pb(NO3)2 (99%) and hydriodic acid HI 57% aqueous solution (<1.5% hypophosphorous acid as a stabilizer) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), benzotrifluoride and sodium iodide (>99.5%) were supplied by Sigma Aldrich. 1,1′-Diphenyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride (phenyl viologen dichloride, PhVCl2) was purchased from TCI Chemicals. The synthesis of PhVPI was performed by reacting an acetone solution containing PbI2 and NaI with a PhVCl2 water solution. PbI2 has been previously prepared by reacting aqueous lead nitrate with aqueous hydriodic acid. In a typical synthesis, 0.461 g of PbI2 (1 mmol) and 0.225 g of NaI (1.5 mmol) were dissolved in 9 ml of acetone and 0.191 g of PhVCl2 (1 mmol) was dissolved in 3 ml of distilled water at room temperature. The formation of a brownish precipitate occurred upon the dropwise addition of the PhVCl2 solution to the one containing PbI2 and NaI (in a 30 ml vial). After completing the addition, the vial was closed, shaken and left undisturbed for 1 h. The precipitate darkened with time until becoming black-brownish. After 1 h it was filtered with suction apparatus, washed multiple times with a acetone/water 3:1 vol:vol mixture and dried under suction for 1 h. The precipitate was then retrieved and dissolved in a minimum amount of DMF (∼80 ml). The resulting solution was filtered over a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter. The filtrate was exposed for 2 days to a DCM saturated atmosphere in a closed container. Finally, black crystals (Fig. 1A) were recovered through vacuum filtration, multiple washings with DCM, and drying under suction for 30 min. The overall process led to 0.615 g of the final product (83% yield based on PbI2). On the other hand, high-quality crystals dedicated to structure determination were grown either by slow cooling (1 °C h−1) of saturated solutions of PhVPI in DMF from 110 °C to room temperature or by exposing a solution of PhVPI in DMSO (100 mg ml−1) to benzotrifluoride vapor in a closed container for two weeks at room temperature. The best crystals were obtained by slow cooling of saturated solutions of PhVPI in DMF. A photo of a group of crystals is shown in Fig. 1B.

2.2 Single crystal X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements for structure determination were performed at the XRD1 beamline of the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility (Trieste, Italy).19,20 A suitable crystal was glued on a glass fiber and mounted onto a goniometer head. An X-ray wavelength of 0.7 Å and a silicon diode array area detector (Pilatus 2M; Dectris) were used for the diffraction experiments. Data collection was carried out at room temperature (293 K). Unit cell assignment, integration and data reduction were performed using the XDS program.21 The structures were solved using the dual space algorithm implemented in the SHELXT code.22 Fourier analysis and refinement were performed by the full-matrix least-squares methods based on F2 implemented in SHELXL (Version 2018/3).23 Anisotropic thermal motion refinement was used for all atoms with full occupancy. Hydrogen atoms were included at calculated positions with isotropic U factors = 1.2Ueq (Ueq being the equivalent isotropic thermal factor of the bonded non-hydrogen atom). Crystals showed non-merohedral twinning (reciprocal lattice two-fold twinning axis (001)), with a twin fraction of 21%, identified using the PLATON TwinRotMat algorithm.24 Twin domains are related by the following rotation matrix: [−1 0 0; 0 −1 0; 0.686 0.748 1], corresponding to a (001) two-fold twinning axis in the reciprocal lattice. Refinement significantly improved using this information, reducing R1 from 0.1234 to 0.0915.
2.3 Powder X-ray diffraction
A Panalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å) equipped with an X'Celerator RTMS detector was used for powder X-ray diffraction analysis (angular resolution in 2θ: 0.001°). A 0.04 rad soller slit, a 1° divergence slit, and a 20 mm mask were used on the incident beam path, whereas a 6.6 mm anti-scatter slit, a Ni Kβ filter, and a 0.04 rad collimator were positioned on the diffracted beam path. The scans were collected in the 6.5–90° 2θ angular range. Non-ambient powder XRD measurements in the same angular range were performed in a flowing He gas atmosphere (20 cm3 min−1 @ STP, purity 99.999%) at 250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C by using an Anton Paar XRK 900 chamber in conjunction with the aforementioned diffractometer. Data collection for each temperature was performed after an hour-long isothermal treatment. All optics employed in the ambient X-ray diffraction experiment, except for the incident beam mask (15 mm instead of 20 mm), were used in the non-ambient configuration as well.
2.4 Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA)
TG-DTA analysis was performed with a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx thermal analyzer. The measurements were carried out in sintered alumina crucibles under a flowing Ar atmosphere (85 cm3 min−1 @ STP, purity ≥ 99.9995%) with a scan rate of 10 K min−1 in the RT–500 °C temperature range.
2.5 UV-Vis spectroscopy
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were acquired with a Shimadzu (Japan) UV2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-2600 Plus integrating sphere (BaSO4 powder as reflectance reference). The nature of the band gap (i.e. direct or indirect, allowed or forbidden) was determined by comparing the absorption edge attained from the pseudoabsorbance spectrum with the values obtained using Tauc's plots25 employing different exponents.
2.6 FT-IR spectroscopy
A Bruker Alpha spectrophotometer was used to collect the FT-IR spectra in the 400–4000 cm−1 wavenumber range (resolution 1 cm−1). Data were acquired in DRIFT mode on samples dispersed in dry KBr powder.
2.7 CHN analysis
The C, H, and N contents of the material were determined by means of an EA 1110 CHNS-O instrument.
2.8 Photoelectron spectroscopy
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on a Vacuum Generators ESCA LAB MKII system employing the He I line radiation (hν = 21.2 eV) for the excitation of photoelectron emission. A 10 V bias voltage was applied to the sample to appreciate better the secondary electrons cut-off. The kinetic energy scale of the spectra was calibrated to the Fermi energy position of an Au reference. A small amount of PhVPI powder (300 mg) was pressed into a pellet and used for the UPS analysis. A graphene monolayer (SL) grown by CVD was transferred on the top surface of the pellet in order to ground the sample. Experimental details concerning the CVD growth of the graphene layer and its subsequent transfer on different surfaces can be found elsewhere.26
3. Results and discussion
General considerations: the material, both as powder and crystals, appears shiny black with a bright metallic luster (Fig. 1). As shown in Section 3.2, PhVPI proved to be insensitive to water. It is also completely stable in air at room temperature and, consequently, no special conditions or precautions are needed for storage and handling. The material was found to be highly resistive (1010–1011 Ω cm). Furthermore, PhVPI turned out to be PL-inactive at room temperature when excited with both 532 and 405 nm laser lights. The high resistivity and lack of PL signals at room temperature parallel the characteristics of solution-grown CH3NH3PbI3 crystals27 and other semiconductors like CdTe. Unfortunately, the extremely low conductivity of the material prevented the determination of the nature and concentration of the charge carriers through Hall effect measurements with the instrumentation available to the authors. The compound showed moderate solubility in DMF (∼5 mM) but high solubility in DMSO. Such findings allowed for solution processing of the pristine material in order to deposit thin films suitable for photovoltaic applications. In particular, a few trials of thin film deposition on 2 × 2 cm2 FTO glass slides were carried out by spin coating PhVPI solutions in DMSO or in a DMF/DMSO 1:1 vol:vol mixture. The thin films were deposited on the FTO glass through a hot casting technique keeping the substrate and the PhVPI solution at 150 °C. It is worth noticing that the relatively high temperature guaranteed the complete dissolution of PhVPI. Conversely, aggregation and partial precipitation of the solute did occur at room temperature in the DMSO/DMF solvent mixture. Spin ramp was started upon transferring the hot substrate on spin coating equipment. Then, 50 μl of the hot solution was dynamically dispensed on the spinning substrate. At the end of the procedure the films were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Different spin coating ramps, i.e. 3000 and 4000 rpm for 30 s, and different perovskite solution compositions (0.4 M in pure DMSO and 0.25 M in DMF/DMSO 1:1) were tested. The best results were achieved for 4000 rpm/30 s. Pictures of two films (one from the 0.4 M solution in DMSO and the other from the 0.25 M solution in DMF/DMSO 1:1) are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† while their X-ray diffraction patterns are displayed in Fig. S2 and S3 of the ESI.† XRD investigation revealed the presence of two preferred orientations: (010) perpendicular to the substrate surface and (002), for the film prepared from pure DMSO and from the DMSO/DMF solution, respectively. The peaks that do not belong to C22H18N2(PbI3)2 are due to reflections of the FTO layer. Because of the polycrystalline nature of the FTO coating, orientation effects caused by the substrate can reasonably be ruled out. Therefore, the difference in the films’ preferred direction of growth can fairly be attributed to the different PhVPI concentrations and the type of solvent used for the deposition.
3.1 Structural description
The C22H18N2(PbI3)2 unit cell is presented in Fig. 2A and the structural data are summarized in Table 1. The lattice is triclinic (space group P, no. 2) and the crystallographic constants at 293 K are a = 4.530(1) Å, b = 12.610(3) Å, c = 14.680(3) Å, α = 107.85(3)°, β = 93.47(3)° and γ = 98.10(3)°. The unit cell contains a single formula unit. The density obtained by the floating method (with a mixture of diiodomethane and dibromomethane) is 3.12 ± 0.02 g cm−3 and is in excellent agreement with the calculated one (3.142 g cm−3). Phenyl viologen cations and the PbI6 octahedra (arranged as double chains of edge-sharing units) are alternately located along the b axis and thus form layers parallel to the (001) plane. These layers are stacked along the c axis and this arrangement constructs the 3D architecture of the structure (Fig. 2B). The double chain arrangement of the PbI6 octahedra (Fig. 3) is rarely observed and parallels the one found in isopropyl viologen lead iodide.17 The PbI6 octahedra are highly distorted, with 6 different Pb–I distances, ranging from 3.007 to 3.469 Å. The phenyl viologen cations do not present a planar structure. Indeed, the two pyridine rings are coplanar, while the C1–C5–N10–C9 dihedral angle between the phenyl group and pyridine ring is 44(2)°. The phenyl viologen cation in the present compound possesses a center of symmetry. Furthermore, it shows a different arrangement of the four aromatic rings compared to the one observed in phenyl viologen dichloride. Specifically, in the former the two pyridine rings are coplanar, whereas in the latter are non-coplanar.28 The distance between the phenyl viologen units (i.e. the distance between equivalent atoms in adjacent phenyl viologen cations) is 4.53 Å. Despite the different crystal structure, the arrangement of both the Pb–I network and the viologen units resembles the one observed in isopropyl viologen lead iodide.17 In particular, the viologen units are stacked along the same direction of the Pb–I double chains of edge-sharing octahedra in both PhVPI and isopropyl viologen lead iodide. However, in isopropyl viologen lead iodide such a direction does not coincide with any of the unit cell axes. The bond lengths are reported in Table S1 of the ESI,† while a labeled presentation of the anion and cation units is shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The [PbI3−]n double chains and the stacks of phenyl viologen cations forming the layers parallel to the (001) plane interact through the following hydrogen bonds: H4⋯I3: 2.946, H2⋯I3: 3.079, H1⋯I2: 3.012, and H5⋯I1: 2.947 Å (Fig. S5 of the ESI†). All these values are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of both atoms H (1.2 Å) and I (1.98 Å). These short distances between the [PbI3−]n double chains and the phenyl viologen cations suggest the donor–acceptor hybrid semiconductor nature of the material, which allows charge transfer processes from the electron-rich [PbI3−]n double chains to the electron deficient phenyl viologen cations.29

3.2 Powder X-ray diffraction
The powder diffraction pattern of the as prepared compound is displayed in Fig. 4, panel A together with the attribution of the most relevant reflections. In Fig. 4, panel B, the calculated diffraction pattern is reported for comparison purposes. The XRD pattern demonstrating PhVPI's stability after prolonged immersion (12 h) in water at room temperature can be found in Fig. S6 of the ESI;† it can be clearly superimposed onto the pattern in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 panels A, B and C show the diffraction patterns of the same compound collected in the environmental chamber at temperatures of 250, 300 and 350 °C, respectively. Each pattern was acquired after an hour-long isothermal treatment. The absence of reflections belonging to degradation products implies that PhVPI is thermally stable up to at least 300 °C. The diffraction pattern collected at 300 °C shows a new peak next to the (010) reflection (at slightly lower 2θ values). Probably, the phenyl viologen units stacked along the b direction start decomposing (PhVCl2 decomposes at around 300 °C28) and, therefore, a new peak near the (010) reflection is generated. Conversely, at 350 °C, the material completely decomposes and, consequently, the diffraction pattern shows the features of an amorphous or a liquid phase with some weak unidentified reflections. This result is consistent with the DTA analysis showing an endothermal event occurring at 332 °C (see Section 3.3). PhVPI melting was verified by heating at 340 °C and then cooling at room temperature a powder sample sealed under an Ar atmosphere in a glass vial. The material was found as a solidified drop at the bottom of the vial, confirming that the material had melted. X-ray diffraction performed after cooling the sample provided evidence of incongruent melting. In fact, the XRD pattern did not correspond to the one of pristine PhVPI. Besides, the same unidentified peaks found for the sample heated at 350 °C were detected over the background of a mostly amorphous material. Furthermore, new unidentified peaks, probably stemming from an additional phase(s) now in the solid state (see Fig. 6), were also present. The occurrence of an incongruent melting process in a similar range of temperatures has also been described for methyl viologen lead iodide.16

3.3 TG-DTA
The TG-DTA pattern of PhVPI is reported in Fig. 7. The loss of volatile products starts at 389 °C and continues until the end of the measurement (at 500 °C). Two thermal events are also recognizable in the DTA profile: a first one at 332 °C (with a clear endothermal peak) corresponding to the incongruent melting of PhVPI (see Section 3.2) and a second event characterized by a discontinuity at 411 °C, which can be safely attributed to the melting of a small quantity of PbI2 formed during the PhVPI decomposition.

3.4 UV-Vis spectroscopy
The pseudoabsorbance spectrum of the powder product is shown in Fig. 8A, and the corresponding Tauc's plot is illustrated in Fig. 8B. The band gap obtained from the absorption onset is 1.32 eV. This value perfectly agrees with the one extrapolated from the Tauc's plot for an allowed direct band gap, i.e. 1.32 ± 0.01 eV. The absorption maximum in the visible range (i.e. 550 nm or 2.25 eV) may arise from a charge transfer process like the one occurring the isopropyl viologen lead iodide, as suggested by the crystal structure of PhVPI.17,29 This hypothesis is strongly supported by the structural similarities between the two compounds. Finally, the band gap energy value and its direct nature make PhVPI an ideal absorber of solar radiation from the Shockley–Queisser limit standpoint for single-junction solar cells.30

3.5 FT-IR spectroscopy
In Fig. 9 the FT-IR spectra of PhVPI and PhVCl2 are shown. The spectral similarities between the two phenyl viologen derivatives confirm the presence of the PhV2+ cation in PhVPI. Nonetheless, extra peaks in the PhVCl2 spectrum are visible in the typical ranges of water absorptions (400–700 cm−1, 1250–2100 cm−1 and 3400–4000 cm−1). Wavenumber shifts of some of the peaks can be ascribed to the different interactions between PhV2+ and the two different anionic sublattices in PhVCl2 and PhVPI.

3.6 CHNS analysis
The measured C, H and N contents (wt%) are 18.1, 1.2 and 2.0, respectively. The agreement with the calculated values for C22H18N2(PbI3)2 (17.8% C, H 1.2% and 1.9% N) is excellent.
3.7 Photoelectron spectroscopy
UPS investigation is aimed at evaluating the PhVPI's work function (WF) and valence band maximum (VBM) position. The black curve in Fig. S7 of the ESI† represents the raw photoemission spectrum of a pellet of the synthesized compound. Charging effects provoked by PhVPI's low conductivity resulted in an overall shift of the UPS spectrum to lower kinetic energies. Charge shift (approximately 1 eV) was also detected in the XPS spectrum (not reported). Needless to say, the charge build-up in the sample led to an underestimated value of the PhVPI's work function value (3.6 eV) extrapolated from the high-energy secondary cut-off.
In order to compensate for the surface charging a graphene monolayer (SL) was deposited on the PhVPI pellet to guarantee a good electrical contact between the sample and metal sample holder. The “grounded” UPS spectrum is shown in red in Fig. S7 of the ESI,† and it is clearly shifted towards high kinetic energies compared to the “ungrounded” case. Therefore, the graphene monolayer proved to be entirely effective in neutralizing the charge accumulation due to the photoemission.
The high-energy cut-off edge contribution to the UPS He I spectrum stems from the secondary electrons generated underneath the first atomic layers of the material and losing energy through inelastic collisions.31 The universal curve for the energy-dependent electron inelastic mean free path suggests that the secondary cut-off energy range in Fig. S7 of the ESI† corresponds to sampling depths over a nanometer. Hence, it can be assumed that the secondary edge contribution to the UPS spectrum is caused predominantly by photoelectrons originating from the PhVPI pellets rather than from the graphene monolayer. Thus, the material's work function was estimated to be 4.9 eV. Consequently, the analysis of the VBM region (Fig. S8 of the ESI†) could be performed by simply shifting the pristine PhVPI spectrum of 1.3 eV. Therefore, an approximate position of the VBM at 30.4 eV, i.e. about 0.8 eV below the Fermi level position (EF, located at 21.2 eV if the applied 10 V bias is taken into account), could be extrapolated. Finally, by combining the photoemission spectroscopy data with the results provided by UV-Vis DRS it was possible to locate the band energy edges with respect to the vacuum level: −4.4 eV and −5.7 eV for conduction (CB) and valence bands (VB), respectively. According to the present findings the material seems to possess a slight n-type character. A diagram reporting the positions of the CB, EF and VB is shown in Fig. 10.

4. Conclusion
Phenyl viologen lead iodide C22H18N2(PbI3)2 (PhVPI) was successfully synthesized and characterized. The new compound showed very promising potential as a photovoltaic material intended for the replacement of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) in perovskite solar cells. For instance, PhVPI's direct allowed band gap value of 1.32 eV lies within the optimum range set by the Shockley–Queisser limit for single junction solar cells. In addition, while CH3NH3PbI3-based photovoltaics are currently plagued by stability issues, PhVPI is completely insensitive to water under ambient conditions and highly thermally stable showing no appreciable degradation up to 300 °C. Its stability definitively benefits from the quaternary structure of the organoammonium cations, which does not produce the detrimental acid–base equilibria underlying the CH3NH3PbI3 degradation. Furthermore, PhVPI is also solution processable and the successful deposition of thin films from DMSO and DMSO/DMF solutions was demonstrated in this paper. Finally, the determination of the electron band energies with respect to the vacuum level (i.e. EF = −4.9 eV, CB = −4.4 eV, and VB = −5.7 eV) can pave the way for further investigation dedicated to the development of appropriate combinations of electron donor and acceptor materials to be used along with PhVPI in thin film solar cells.
