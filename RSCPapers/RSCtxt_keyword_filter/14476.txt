Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been the focus of research in photovoltaic systems since the pioneering report by Grätzel et al. in 1991 due to their high efficiency and economical fabrication processes.1 Recently, a cobalt-based redox mediator has been attracting world-wide attention as an alternative to traditional iodide/triiodide redox mediator, owing to the feasibility of the ease of tuning of the redox energy, negligible light absorption, and remarkable performance.2–5 However, the most unfavorable feature of the cobalt-based electrolyte compared to iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte is the lower diffusion coefficient due to the relatively large size of mediator molecules, leading to slow mass transport.6–10 Nowadays, various techniques, such as replacing the ligands of Co(III)/(II),3,11,12 employing non-platinum materials as the cathode,3,12–15 and optimizing the morphology of the TiO2,16–18 and so on, were also found to be beneficial for the mass transport of the cobalt-based electrolyte. However, these techniques are complicated and involve high-cost procedures of preparation, restricting the upcoming large-scale application. As we all know, graphene exhibits a favourable charge transport and catalytic performance,19–26 which is a promising class of electrocatalysts for DSSCs. Great effort has been dedicated to the investigation of the graphene-based counter electrodes (CEs) and a number of reports on graphene-based CEs have been published with a high performance based on a Co(III)/(II) redox couple.2,14,27 Recently, we reported on the application of graphene on top of a gold spattered film as CE in DSSCs using a cobalt electrolyte, which showed a lower charge transfer resistance compared to the platinum CE.27 In addition, carbon nanotubes (CNT) were added to the electrolyte and then used to fabricate DSSCs that showed higher efficiency, because CNT effectively supported the electron transfer from the counter electrode to the dye.28
In this regard, we investigated the functions of stacked graphene platelet nanofibers (SGNF) dispersed in the liquid electrolyte for achieving a significant improvement of the DSSC performance using a Co(III)/(II) redox couple. A certain amount of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte may play the roles of a solid-state electron mediator and a movable CE, which can improve the charge transport and accelerate the catalytic reactions of the Co(III)/(II) redox couple, thus increasing Jsc. Besides, we have designed and synthesized a new organic sensitizer (AQ308) by using the bulky triphenylamine donor, which can effectively inhibit the charge recombination between the electrons on the TiO2 surface and the mediator species in the electrolyte, especially for the cobalt redox system.29 The introduction of quinoxaline as the auxiliary acceptor can enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), broadening the absorption spectrum of the molecule (Scheme 1).30,31 As a result, the DSSC based on AQ308 achieves the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.81% (Jsc = 16.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 830 mV and FF = 70.56%) under standard AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight with SGNF (0.2 mg mL−1) dispersed in the cobalt-based electrolyte.
 Scheme 1  The structure of AQ308. 
The synthetic route to AQ308 is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis of AQ308 starts from the Suzuki coupling reaction of 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid, giving the corresponding aldehyde precursor 5. Compound 6 is synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction between compound 5 and tributyltin compound 3. The target sensitizer AQ308 is obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation in the presence of the cyanoacetic acid and compound 6. All the intermediates and target sensitizers are characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as HRMS. Besides, the stacked graphene platelet nanofibers (SGNF) are also characterized using SEM, FTIR, and XRD (see the ESI†).
The absorption spectra of AQ308 in CH2Cl2 solution and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The absorption band between 470 and 700 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor group to the cyanoacetic acid acceptor unit. The maximum molar absorption coefficient (εmax) at λmax has been evaluated to be 35528 (548 nm) for AQ308 in CH2Cl2. In addition, when the dye is adsorbed on a 4 μm TiO2 film (Fig. S1, ESI†), the maximum absorption peak is blue-shifted to 539 nm, which may be ascribed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.30 The ground state oxidation potential  of AQ308 determined by means of cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S2, ESI†) is 0.88 V, which is sufficiently higher than that of the redox potential of 0.56 V vs. NHE in [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+; thus this guarantees an ample driving force for dye regeneration. On the other hand, the excited-state oxidation potential  of AQ308, derived from ground state oxidation potential and optical energy gap , is −1.01 V. E0–0 is estimated from the absorption threshold from the absorption spectrum of dyes in solution. The  potential of the dye is more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring an efficient electron injection process from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2.

Fig. 1a shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of AQ308-based DSSCs with various amounts of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte, in which the IPCEs of DSSCs with the SGNF electrolyte are higher than those without SGNF electrolyte, leading to the higher Jsc. This may be attributed to two reasons: (1) as a solid-state electron mediator,32 SGNF can accelerate the charge transport from the platinum CE toward TiO2 photoanodes; and (2) SGNF may play a movable CE role to accelerate the catalytic reactions of Co(III)/(II) redox couple, thus improving the mass transport. The J–V curves of DSSCs based on AQ308 with the different amounts of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte are given in Fig. 1b and Table 1. The Jscs of DSSCs increase with the concentrations of SGNF from 0 to 0.2 mg mL−1, and then decrease with further increasing SGNF concentration to 0.4 mg mL−1, whereas fewer changes are observed in corresponding Voc. The DSSC containing 0.2 mg mL−1 SGNF in the electrolyte exhibits the best PCE of 9.81% with the Voc of 830 mV, Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 70.56%.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is also used to explore the functions of SGNF in the liquid electrolyte with Co(III)/(II) redox couple. A series of bias voltages ranging from −0.60 to −0.85 V were applied to DSSCs with different amounts of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte under dark conditions. Fig. 2a depicts the charge transfer resistance (Rct) (between the TiO2 films and the electrolyte) and chemical capacitance (Cchem) of DSSCs with different amounts of SGNF (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg mL−1, respectively) as functions of the IR (Internal Resistance) drop corrected potential. In DSSCs without the SGNF electrolyte, the Rct values are higher than the devices with the SGNF electrolyte. This indicates that the resistances of electron recombination decrease with an increased amount of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte, owing to the increased chance of existence of SGNF on the TiO2 surface, impelling the recombination process between the electrons on the TiO2 surface and electrolyte mediator. In addition, Fig. 2a shows that chemical capacitances (Cchem) augment with the increasing concentration of SGNF (from 0 to 0.2 mg mL−1), indicating that the electron-rich SGNF approaching the TiO2 surface raise the charge density of the TiO2 conduction band. However, the values of Cchem become smaller with 0.4 mg mL−1 of SGNF because the distinct increase of electron recombination negatively affects the electron density of TiO2 conduction band. Besides, the electron lifetimes positively correlated to the Voc values are calculated by the equation of τn = Rct × Cchem (Fig. 2b). With 0.2 mg mL−1 of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte, the AQ308-based DSSC possesses longer electron lifetimes, leading to higher Voc.

Notably, the fill factor (FF) values increase from 67.65 to 70.56% with the amounts of SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte from 0 to 0.2 mg mL−1, and then decrease with further increasing the SGNF amount to 0.4 mg mL−1. Compared to the device without the SGNF electrolyte, the lower CE charge transfer resistances of the devices with SGNF electrolyte contribute to their higher FF values,27 whereas little effect is observed for the Warburg diffusion resistance (Fig. 3a). The big difference in the CE charge transfer resistance may arise from the dispersed SGNF engaging in the catalytic reactions with the Co(III)/(II) redox couple, decreasing the whole charge transfer resistance between the platinum CE and Co(III) species. Based on that, the SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte may play a movable CE role to accelerate the catalytic reactions of Co(III)/(II) redox couple. But the increased dark current caused by too much SGNF in the electrolyte cannot be neglected (Fig. 3b), which will decrease the shunting resistance of device and thus drop the FF.33,34

Transient photocurrent spectroscopy (Fig. 4), using on/off modulation of the incident light, can indicate the effect of SGNF in the electrolyte on mass transport limitations of the Co(III)/(II) redox couple. We observe that the photocurrents of DSSCs with SGNF (0, and 0.4 mg mL−1) dispersed in the electrolyte quickly decay to lower steady-state current densities, but with SGNF (0.1, and 0.2 mg mL−1), steady-state current densities without decay are reached, indicating that an appropriate concentration of SGNF as a solid-state electron mediator can lead to the charge transport improvement. Such SGNF can increase the electrical conductivity of the system and more passages to result in fast charge transport (Fig. S4, ESI†).

In summary, a distinctive route for improving the performance of DSSCs with a quinoxaline-based organic sensitizer (AQ308) is proposed by SGNF dispersed in the Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox couple electrolyte. Acting as a solid-state electron mediator, the SGNF dispersed in the electrolyte can improve the charge transport from the platinum CE toward TiO2 photoanodes, and play a movable CE role to accelerate the catalytic reactions of the Co(III)/(II) redox couple. The result shows that appropriate concentrations of SGNF in electrolyte can decrease the CE charge transfer resistances and improve the FF. Importantly, the Jscs of AQ308-based DSSCs with SGNF electrolyte are higher than that without SGNF electrolyte, in which the DSSC containing 0.2 mg mL−1 SGNF exhibits the best PCE of 9.81% with the Voc of 830 mV, Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 70.56% under standard AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight. This finding has a straightforward application in the design for a higher efficiency of cobalt-mediator-based dye-sensitized solar cells.
