    , Accepted 25th April 2015First published on 7th May 2015AbstractComposition average dependent properties for blends of the conjugated polymer P3HT and the fullerenes [60]PCBM, [60]ICBA and their mixtures were studied using cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR techniques. We found that the blended fullerenes form an alloy and that when mixed with a third polymer component, the system exhibits pseudo-binary phase behaviour instead of the expected ternary phase behaviour. Our results experimentally confirm the earlier hypothesis that the unexpected composition average dependent IV-behaviour for these supposed ternary mixtures are indeed due to them behaving as pseudo-binary mixtures due to alloying of the fullerene components. This finding has vast implications for the understanding of polymer–fullerene mixtures and quite certainly also their application in organic solar cells where performance hinges critically on the blend behaviour which is also investigated in this study.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells have emerged as a low cost alternative to traditional silicon solar cells in recent years. The binary blend of conjugated polymer donor and fullerene acceptor, described as a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), is the most common variant and its continued development is buoyed by advances in efficiency,1 stability,2 and large-scale processing.3 Fundamental limitations in attainable peak efficiency have been identified and attributed to the interplay of donor and acceptor in the photoconversion process. Specifically, attempts to broaden the spectral response (i.e., increase the short circuit current Jsc) are countered by a diminishing open circuit voltage Voc. Tandem solar cells are designed to alleviate this unfavourable balancing act, but only at the expense of dramatic increases in complexity of manufacture.4 Recent work has focused on ternary blend BHJ solar cells5,6 as a potential route toward higher efficiency while maintaining the attractive simplicity of a single active layer. In a ternary blend either two donors are blended with one acceptor (D1:D2:A)7–12 or one donor with two acceptors (D:A1:A2).13–17 Higher efficiencies than either limiting binary blend have been observed due to both enhanced spectral response18 and the attainment of an intermediate composition dependent Voc.8,19 The origin of the composition-tunable Voc has been attributed to the formation of organic alloys,14 which have been described as miscible blends of the synergistic components (D1XD2(1−X) or A1XA2(1−X)). The proposed intimate interaction of these synergistic components accounts for the observed regular (materials-averaged) variation in Voc and CT state energies in these blends, rooted in what is rationalized as an averaging of HOMO and LUMO energies in the alloy.20 Support for the physical aspects of this model is largely indirect, with alloy behaviour observed in pairs of polymer donors with similar surface energies, but not observed in polymer pairs with strongly differing surface energies.12,14–16 A practical challenge for the application of ternary blends is the already complex optimization of film formation and morphology known with binary blends, which would be expected to increase dramatically in complexity when moving to ternary systems.
From a processing perspective, the generation of alloys greatly simplifies the challenges of device optimization in ternary systems, rendering them effectively binary or pseudo-binary blends. Considering more deeply the blending behavior in conjugated polymer–fullerene blends, the polymer solar cell in its most studied form comprises a binary mixture of a conjugated light absorbing donor polymer component and a fullerene acceptor component. The most studied example is the conjugated polymer poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) where the performance of the solar cell device typically has one optimum blending ratio of the two components in a binary phase diagram. In the case of P3HT:PCBM this ratio is around 1:1 (wt/wt) whereas that ratio for (2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy))-1,4-phenylenevinylene (MEHPPV) and PCBM is around 1:4 (wt/wt). There is no general rule as to what optimal mixing ratio with PCBM one should expect for a given conjugated polymer, but generally the best performing cases present a mixing ratio between 1:1 and 1:2 due to several other practical aspects that are competing with efficient carrier extraction.21 Most importantly the active layer comprising the polymer:fullerene mixture must be kept as thin as possible while having as high an optical cross section as possible. Since the [60]fullerene presents little optical absorption in the visible range the conjugated polymer content should be as high as possible. In addition to the optical absorption the performance also critically hinges on the demixing of the fullerene and polymer materials into a nanoscale phase separated bulk morphology compatible with the exciton diffusion length. The phase separation has also been found to be decisive for the efficiency with which the active layer mixture converts incoming photons into free charge carriers in an external circuit. All-in-all finding the route to how a given polymer–fullerene mixture becomes high performing has again-and-again presented an enormous optimization procedure for any new materials set.
Progressing to mixtures comprising more components has obviously been explored but has also been anticipated to be even more intricate or even impossible with the current experimental tools that comprise point sampling through mixing the appropriate ratio under a set of given conditions that may also present additional variability (temperature, solvents, drying time). This has been addressed in a study where clever machinery allowed for full exploration of the binary phase diagram and other parameters such as active layer film thickness by continuous gradient mixing while preparing the active layer for polymer solar cells.22 Such equipment and methodology would certainly speed up the process and enable exploration of mixing multiple components but for ternary or quaternary mixtures a totally new parallel testing approach would need to be developed.
However, the degree of increasing complexity when transitioning from binary to ternary mixtures may indeed be dependent on the phase behavior of the ternary system. Two distinct ternary system types appear to exist, that in which alloy formation of the synergistic components effectively yields a binary or pseudo-binary system and that in which a true ternary system likely results from mutual immiscibility of the three components.20 The latter case would seemingly present enormous challenges in optimization as noted earlier. Further, when there is no alloy formation or miscibility, despite the observed sensitization over the full wavelength range, light absorption is followed by rapid and efficient hole transfer to the lowest energy component resulting in a device Voc which corresponds to the low-Voc-component, limiting the potential of these systems to increase efficiency.10 For those cases in which alloy formation has been hypothesized or is likely, the addition of a small amount of a third component (whether a donor or an acceptor) in a binary system does lead to increased performance,10 and reports where the change in observed photovoltaic parameters, particularly Voc, show a linear or near linear dependence on the relative content of the third component thus representing true tuning capacity. The explanation proposed was that alloys were formed between two of the components and this was most clearly observed for the fullerenes PCBM and ICBA largely as inferred from electronic properties of the devices, including the regular variation of the CT energies with composition of the alloying pairs.13–17 The actual mixing of the two fullerene components was however not analyzed in detail. This led us to analyze mixtures of the fullerenes ([60]PCBM and [60]ICBA) and ternary mixtures with the conjugated polymer poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) using cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CP MAS) solid-state NMR techniques to shed further light on how alloying between components reduces the complexity of phase behavior. The ternary mixtures result in an intermediate Voc compared to binary blends with either PCBM or ICBA (an example of Voc of a ternary blend in comparison to the binary blends is shown in Fig. 1).

Here we present a study that provides direct physical observation of the alloy phase via solid-state. This results is further supported by an extensive device study that demonstrates the pseudo-binary nature of an alloying ternary system and the benefits of simplified phase, which in this case include a slightly higher performance for the ternary blend system than the corresponding binary mixtures.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) was obtained from BASF (Sepiolid P200, Mw = 40000, PD = 2), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM in 99% purity) was obtained from Merck and bisindacenofullerene (ICBA in 98% purity) was obtained from Plextronics. Chlorobenzene (99%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Sample preparation for NMR
The materials (200 mg total weight) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (100 mL) and casted in large petri dishes and left for solvent annealing (slow evaporation). The solids were then heated at 140 °C for 60 minutes to ensure that the morphological evolution matched previous experiments and had reached equilibrium.
2.3 NMR
All solid-state NMR experiments were carried out on an Avance II Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature using a standard 2.5 mm Bruker triple-resonance MAS probe. The 1H spectra were each recorded with a single scan using 30 kHz spinning and a 25 ms acquisition time. For all 13C experiments, cross-polarization (CP) from 1H to 13C with contact times of 2.0 ms was used to improve sensitivity and a spinning frequency of 10 kHz was used. Acquisition times were 30 ms, and relaxation delays 3 s. The 13C spectra shown in Fig. 2 and 3 were acquired with 1024 scans while the spectra in Fig. 4 used 14336 scans each.

2.4 Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
The optimum blend ratio was established by carefully mixing P3HT with either PCBM or ICBA in different mixing ratios keeping the solid concentration at a constant value of 40 mg ml−1. The solvent was chlorobenzene with 0.3 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene. The use of the additive was to improve printability. The solution was then heated at 70 °C for 2–3 hours prior to the fabrication of the solar cells. Solar cells with inverted geometry were processed on an ITO-free Flextrode substrate that comprises of printed Ag-grids/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO on PET substrate which was mass produced in a roll-to-roll machinery using Flexographic printing (Ag grids), rotary screen printing (PEDOT:PSS) and slot-die coating (ZnO).25,26 1 m of these substrates were cut from the roll of Flextrode and subsequent device stacks were fabricated using a laboratory roll-coater.23,24 Active inks were slot-die coated at a speed of 1 m min−1 and a flow-rate of 0.15 ml min−1, thus resulting in a wet-layer thickness of 15 μm and a dry layer thickness between 400–500 nm depending on the composition of the active ink. PEDOT:PSS was slot-die coated at a speed of 0.8 m min−1 and a flow-rate of 1.2 m min−1. PEDOT:PSS was dried on the roll coater at 80 °C for 45 minutes. The devices were completed by flexo-printing of a silver back electrode grid and subsequently dried in a hot-air oven at 140 °C for 10 minutes. The devices were encapsulated between two glass slides using an UV curable epoxy adhesive (LP655 from DELO) and the encapsulated devices were further annealed on a hot plate at 140 °C for 3 minutes. IV-data were recorded under a solar simulator at 1000 W m−2, AM1.5G. The solar simulator was calibrated prior to each measurement run. The active area for the solar cells over a 1 metre stretch of foil was in the range of 0.7–1 cm2 and was carefully assessed in each case using light beam induced current (LBIC) imaging.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Solid-state NMR
It was demonstrated earlier13,14 that the Voc of polymer solar cells based on a ternary mixture of P3HT, PCBM and ICBA followed a trend that was best explained by a binary phase system. This led us to further explore this phenomenon by recording solid state NMR spectra of the individual components and the mixture. The use of NMR on samples in a solid phase is in general complicated by low resolution and sensitivity due to signals broadened by anisotropic nuclear spin interactions, e.g. dipole–dipole couplings and chemical shielding anisotropies. By spinning the sample fast around an axis inclined by 54.74° relative to the orientation of the static magnetic field (i.e., magic-angle-spinning (MAS)) the most dominant effects from the anisotropic interactions are averaged out; however, the resolution in 1H NMR spectra still suffer from residual 1H–1H dipole–dipole couplings. The NMR active 13C nuclei have lower intrinsic NMR sensitivity than 1H and only a 1.1% natural abundance. The resulting low sensitivity of 13C spectra can be improved by transferring the magnetization from 1H to 13C using so-called cross-polarization (CP) techniques, and 13C spectra with the higher spectral resolution than for 1H prove to be highly valuable in this analysis. The resonance frequencies of the NMR active nuclei (i.e., 1H and 13C) in the samples and thereby the peak positions in the NMR spectra are intimately connected to the local shielding of the nuclei by the neighboring electrons and even small variations in the surroundings of a given nucleus are read out in chemical shift changes. In this manner, solid-state NMR techniques enable us to study the chemical environment of atoms in the molecules for a given material through analysis of their spectra, and when mixing two materials, a simple binary phase separation will result in a spectrum which resembles the sum of spectra of two materials. In Fig. 2, we show 1H MAS and 13C CP MAS solid-state NMR spectra of the individual functionalized fullerenes and of the PCBM–ICBA mixture. The 1H spectra are dominated by the aromatic protons at 6–9 ppm and for PCBM by an aliphatic signal around 3.5 ppm. The 13C NMR spectra show fullerene carbons resonating around 135–155 ppm, the benzene carbons at 120–140 ppm, the aliphatic carbons at 20–80 ppm, and the PCBM carbonyl signal is seen above 170 ppm. In the case where PCBM and ICBA present traditional binary phase behavior with separate crystallization of the components, as mentioned above, it would be expected the 1H and 13C spectra for the mixtures would resemble a simple weighted sum of the spectra for the individual components. Any deviation from this is interpreted as a solid solution (alloy) of the two components where the chemical environment for both is changed so as to represent random contacts between PCBM and ICBA molecules in the solid phase. A comparison of the simple weighted sum of the 1H and 13C spectra for individual components and the 1H and 13C spectra obtained for the mixture is shown in Fig. 3. In the alloy the signals in the 1H spectrum at 5–9 ppm are narrower and the signal at 3.5 ppm is shifted to 3.2 ppm. In the case of the 13C spectra the carbonyl signal in PCBM moves from 173.6 ppm to 172.6 ppm and the appearance of the aromatic signals at 120–140 ppm is significantly changed, e.g. the signal at 127.8 ppm in ICBA and the signals at 131.5 and 136.7 ppm in PCBM are not observed in the mixture. We thus have a clear observation that the chemical surrounding of the PCBM and ICBA side chains are significantly changed in the mixture compared to the individual components, and that the two functionalized fullerenes form a solid solution or an alloy.
A 2:1:1 mixture of the conjugated polymer P3HT and the two fullerenes PCBM and ICBA (named P3HT/PCBM/ICBA) is also analyzed using 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy. The spectrum of the mixture is shown in Fig. 4 together with individual spectra of P3HT and the PCBM/ICBA alloy. In Fig. 4, the spectrum of the ternary mixture is also directly compared to a weighted sum of the spectra of P3HT and PCBM/ICBA. It is seen that this sum shows the same signals as for the mixture, and it is concluded that the structure of the fullerene alloys is conserved also when the fullerenes are mixed with the conjugated polymer, while the P3HT polymer phase is not affected by the mixing.
3.2 Polymer solar cells
In order to further substantiate the NMR findings and to explore the implications of ternary blends on the polymer solar cell technology under industrially relevant processing conditions, we investigated the IV-properties of polymer solar cells based on an active layer with ternary blends by using as identical preparation conditions as possible for the active layer films and the NMR samples. Attempts to recover the pure active material from the substrate comprising silver, PEDOT:PSS and ZnO was not possible. Instead we employed similar drying time, drying temperature and wet film thickness. The samples for solar cells were dried on the Flextrode substrate comprising part of the solar cell stack and the samples for NMR were dried in large petri dishes in a hot air oven and later transferred to a vial. While we assume that the morphology of the films prepared by these two methods are near identical and only influenced by small variation the mode of preparation, there are further differences between the two samples arising from the mode of sample preparation for the measurements. For the solar cell two wet-processing steps follows on from the formation of the active layer and for the NMR sample it is mechanically scraped off and compressed into the NMR tube but not subject to wet processing. In spite of these inevitable differences, we assume that the bulk morphology is unaffected.
The type of device employed here warrants brief explanation. A low-cost upscalable method was employed which comprises an inverted device configuration, ambient processing, low-cost ITO replacement known as Flextrode (PET/Ag-grid/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO), and a combination of upscalable printing and coating methods without any use of vacuum steps. The device structure is shown in Fig. 5. While Flextrode is mass produced through a roll-to-roll process, the subsequent layers were fabricated on a laboratory roll coater through coating and printing methods that are directly transferrable to a full roll-to-roll setting but less demanding in terms of material quantities. All layers were processed in ambient conditions with a combination of slot-die coating, flexographic printing and rotary screen printing (Fig. 5). Such a structure, device design, and processing methods are pursued with the view of directly transferring them to large-area modules, for example in ref. 23–26, without significant processing and design changes. Although this device structure and the larger active areas (∼1 cm2) applied in this study results in lower PCE compared to other studies reported in literature, such a device structure however is proven to be more environmentally and economically favorable in spite of the loss in efficiency compared to ITO-based devices.27–29

In this study, firstly the blend ratio of P3HT with the individual fullerene compound, i.e. P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA were optimized. Both these binary mixtures had different optimized blending ratios at a film thickness of 400–500 nm with P3HT:PCBM at 1:1 wt/wt and P3HT:ICBA at 1.5:1 wt/wt. Such a film thickness is crucial in the ITO-free device structure employed as lower thicknesses results in shunts due to silver spikes present in the Flextrode and the processing of the solvent-based top Ag electrode which can diffuse through thin photoactive layer. IV curves of the hero cells at the optimized blend ratio of P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA are given in Fig. 6 and the corresponding IV-parameters in Table 1. Complete overview of the IV-parameters of all blend ratios investigated during the optimization process can be located in the Tables S1 and S2 (see ESI†).

The higher adducts of PCBM were patented by Plextronics in 2006 while ICBA was specifically published for the first time by Youjin He et al. in 2010.30,31 The same group investigated the performance of P3HT:PCBM based devices at or around the optimized mixing ratio of P3HT:PCBM, that is, at 1:1 wt/wt.31,32 Subsequent studies34 involving ICBA followed suit and unlike PCBM where plethora of papers present optimization of the blending ratios and other processing conditions, only a couple of papers present some optimization of P3HT:ICBA devices.32,33 These studies suggest that the optimized blending ratio with P3HT is 1:1 delivering a significantly higher PCE compared to P3HT:PCBM due to increased Voc albeit at some loss of FF and/or Jsc.13,31 In our experience, however, all the previous trials with ICBA where we applied 1:1 mixing ratio, we never achieved comparable performance to P3HT:PCBM mainly because of reduced Jsc and FF. In this study in which we conducted a thorough optimization with blending ratios, we observed that 1.5:1 wt/wt gives significantly higher PCE (almost double) compared to a 1:1 mixing ratio. Our observation is fully consistent with a detailed morphological study on P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA conducted by Lin et al. who found that ICBA disrupts the crystalline formation and phase segregation of P3HT as the ICBA weight fraction is increased in the blend. Specifically, phase separated crystalline P3HT domains were observed at 1.5:1 ratio whereas no crystallinity signals were observed at 1:1 wt/wt ratio suggesting that 1.5:1 blending ratio is more preferable for achieving higher performance in P3HT:ICBA based devices.33
The reason why the loss in Jsc and FF is not observed or is negligible in other studies could be attributed to the smaller active areas (generally less than 0.1 cm2) and lower active layer thicknesses (100–200 nm) generally employed in other studies. Both Jsc and FF are affected by poor morphology which increasingly manifests itself with increasing area and thickness. Nonetheless, the range of PCE in this study albeit significantly less than the maximum reported 5–6% range, is in agreement with other studies employing similar active layer thickness.32 The reason why optimum mixing ratio changes with increasing thickness warrants an in-depth study beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, the increase in Voc which is the primary proof for alloy formation in this study is in agreement with previous studies.
Based on the results of individual optimization of P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA, the performance of devices based on ternary blends was investigated by varying the composition of the fullerene components at P3HT:fullerene 1:1 wt/wt and 1.5:1 wt/wt which are the optimized values when the fullerene component is pure PCBM and pure ICBA respectively. The fullerene composition was investigated by varying the relative composition of PCBM and ICBA at both these P3HT:fullerene ratios. In the resulting ternary blends, Voc increases steadily from the characteristic Voc of P3HT:PCBM with increasing content of ICBA in the active blend (Fig. 6). This observation supports our NMR results as well as the earlier hypothesis by others12,13 that PCBM and ICBA form an alloy which translates to compositional dependent average electronic properties. Nevertheless, the increasing Voc do not imply a corresponding increase in PCE as the effect of the increasing Voc upon the addition of ICBA is mitigated by decreasing Jsc and decreasing FF. We observe that Voc of the ternary blend in our devices gets pinned on an intermediate value between pure binary samples and never reaches closer to that of pure ICBA-based binary blend that has highest Voc. This is unlike previous observations13 where a steady increase in Voc in ternary blends was observed with values reaching quite close to pure ICBA-based binary blend. We suspect that the effect could be caused due to the inverted device configuration used in this study along with higher thickness of the active layer compared to other studies where factors such as vertical phase segregation could undermine Voc of the device. In-depth analysis of this effect is beyond the aim and scope of this study.
Interestingly, in both the P3HT:fullerene blending ratios, the maximum PCE is achieved at a fullerene mixture between PCBM:ICBA at 2:1 wt/wt. With further increase in ICBA content, both FF and Jsc decreases. Overall, the maximum PCE is observed in ternary blends when PCBM:ICBA mixing ratio is 2:1 than in either of the binary blends. The variation in PCE in the experimental conditions investigated in this study is compiled in a ternary plot (Fig. 7) that follows the standard notation for ternary plot representations where each corner corresponds to 100% of that component whereas the line between the two opposite corners corresponds to 0% of that component. The corresponding IV-parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

4. Conclusions
We have confirmed alloy formation between PCBM and ICBA in binary mixtures of PCBM and ICBA and in ternary mixtures of P3HT, PCBM and ICBA through the use of solid state CP MAS NMR spectroscopy. The confirmation of alloying of PCBM and ICBA through intimate mixing that has been proposed earlier thus presents a tool whereby alloy formation can be sought to enable tuning of device parameters according to mixing ratios. We have demonstrated the use of this method for polymer solar cell devices based on ternary bends that when prepared using only ambient processing on flexible substrates enabled a higher performance under optimized conditions than individually optimized binary mixtures between the donor polymer with either of the fullerene acceptors.
