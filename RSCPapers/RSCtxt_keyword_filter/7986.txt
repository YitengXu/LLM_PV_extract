    , Accepted 27th June 2022First published on 27th June 2022AbstractCost-effective acceptors and device fabrication processes are decisive factors for commercializing organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a simple unfused-ring electron acceptor (ThPF-4F) cored with 3,4-bis(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl)thiophene has been developed for layer-by-layer (LBL) high-efficiency OSCs. PBDB-T was selected as the donor and a non-orthogonal solvent system was used to fabricate the device. LBL OSCs (PBDB-T/ThPF-4F) exhibit a better vertical gradient distribution of a donor and an acceptor in the active layers than bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) ones (PBDB-T:ThPF-4F) as revealed by film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy. The charge transport was thus facilitated with reduced recombination losses during charge transfer. LBL OSCs deliver a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.83% with a higher short-circuit current and fill factor in comparison to the optimized BHJ counterparts (11.10%). Importantly, the PCE of LBL OSCs is further improved to 11.97% by adding 10 wt% PC71BM in the PBDB-T layer. This work demonstrates the integration of the rational molecular design and facile device processing as a promising strategy to develop high-performance cost-effective OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising technology for the next generation of sustainable energy due to their unique technical advantages of solution-processing, light weight and semi-transparent properties.1–4 With the development of novel and high-efficiency organic photovoltaic materials, in particular, fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) materials,5,6 bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% for a single-junction device.7,8 Since FREAs are developed with delicate design strategies, the material cost and synthesis difficulty are increased inevitably.9–13 In this case, the development of unfused-ring electron acceptors (UFAs) with cost-effective synthesis has become an important direction in material design. Most researchers have focused on constructing non-covalent interactions in UFAs via side-chain engineering to achieve a high molecular planarity, but substituents on an intermediate electron-donating core can also affect the solubility and aggregation, which in turn affects the morphology of the photoactive layer.14–16 Besides the sophisticated molecular design to improve the device performance of UFA OSCs, many other strategies have been applied as well. For example, Bo et al. reported ternary BHJ OSCs with a high PCE of 14.09% or 14.10% by introducing the FREA (IDTT-OB) or UFA (FO-N) as a third component into PBDB-T:DO-2F binary OSCs, respectively.17,18
Although the ternary strategy effectively optimizes the performance of UFA based OSCs, there are certain challenges in the selection of appropriate third components.19 It is necessary to find other simple and efficient device optimization methods. Layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition processing has been demonstrated as an efficient method to boost OSC performance by collaboratively manipulating the microscopic phase separation and component distribution.20–22 Furthermore, sequentially depositing donor and acceptor layers via the LBL method makes it possible to regulate the donor and acceptor individually, thus reducing the processing complexity of OSCs to a certain extent.23–25 For example, Song and co-workers fabricated PM6/BTP-eC9 OSCs via the spin-coating LBL process to achieve an optimal PCE of 17.13%.26 Tao et al. achieved a PCE of 16.38% for sequential LBL deposition processed D18-Cl/Y6 OSCs, whose performance was further enhanced to 17.73% PCE after dual-solvent treatment to regulate the crystallization of D18-Cl.27 Meanwhile, Chen et al. fabricated OSCs with a PCE of 18.16% by combining LBL processing and the ternary device strategy, where an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP-S2 was added into a PM6:BO-4Cl blend.28 It is evident that LBL processing endows impetus for the realization of high-efficiency OSCs. However, such an LBL method has only been widely used in FREA based OSCs. There are few reports on high performance UFA based OSCs processed using the LBL approach.
In this work, we herein report a novel UFA (ThPF-4F) adopting 3,4-bis(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl)thiophene as the new electron-donating core for the LBL fabrication of high-efficiency OSCs. The phenyl alkyl side chains of ThPF-4F effectively strengthen the molecular steric hindrance and weaken the intermolecular aggregation. Featuring a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −4.02 eV and an optical bandgap of 1.34 eV, ThPF-4F exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum peak at 723 nm. Unlike traditional LBL OSCs requiring two orthogonal solvents to process the donor and acceptor layers, we performed sequential LBL deposition of the donor PBDB-T layer from its solution in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB):chlorobenzene (CB) mixture solvents while the acceptor film from its CB solution. The LBL processed OSCs exhibited an improved vertical phase separation of the donor and acceptor, which facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport for superior short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The layer-by-layer OSCs (PBDB-T/ThPF-4F) delivered an optimal PCE of 11.83%, which is higher than that (11.10%) of the BHJ counterparts (PBDB-T:ThPF-4F). Furthermore, incorporating 10 wt% PC71BM into the PBDB-T film endows the LBL OSCs with a further improved PCE of 11.97%, one of the efficiency records for single-junction UFA-based devices. This work opens a promising avenue to develop high-performance OSCs with easily accessible materials and process for the low-cost and large-scale applications.
Result and discussion
The synthetic route of the 3,4-bis(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl)thiophene core and the chemical structure of the acceptor ThPF-4F are presented in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 1a. The core unit was prepared via the Suzuki coupling reaction of two easily accessible reactants (ca. 3,4-dibromo-thiophene and 3-fluoro-4-methylphenylboronic acid). 3,4-Bis(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl) thiophene was introduced as the electron-donating core to conjugate with fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminals via a cyclopentadithiophene bridge.29 Unlike the traditional benzene-like cores, thiophenes possessing higher electron transport capabilities may afford the acceptors with higher JSC in OSCs. The phenyl side chain (3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl) effectively strengthens molecular steric hindrance and weakens the intermolecular aggregation. Fluorinated IC end groups were utilized to maintain deep energy levels and near-infrared light absorption while enhancing the molecular stacking. The synthesis details and structural characterization of ThPF-4F are provided in the ESI,† with NMR and mass spectra presented in Fig. S1–S7 (ESI†). Both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO distribute over the whole conjugated backbone (Fig. S8, ESI†). The HOMO level and the LUMO level of ThPF-4F were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The LUMO/HOMO levels of ThPF-4F are estimated to be −4.02/−5.49 eV, and the energy levels match well with those of the donor PBDB-T. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of ThPF-4F in both the solution and film are shown in Fig. 1b. ThPF-4F exhibits a strong absorption at 600–900 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 723 nm, which is complementary with the photon harvesting range of PBDB-T (Fig. S10, ESI†). The optical band gap of ThPF-4F is 1.34 eV by estimating from its absorption onset at 920 nm. The molecular energy level arrangement diagram and active layer phase distribution of the BHJ device and LBL device are shown in Fig. 1c and e. As shown in the SEM image for the cross-section of the LBL device, the active layer in the middle does not exhibit the standard delamination of the donor and acceptor, which may be the result of interdiffusion and interpenetration due to the use of the non-orthogonal solvent system during device fabrication (Fig. 1d).

In order to further evaluate the photovoltaic performance of ThPF-4F in OSCs, we fabricated both LBL and BHJ type devices for comparison. The reference BHJ OSCs were prepared from a mixture solution of donor and acceptor in designated weight ratios. The conventional devices for BHJ and LBL OSCs adopt the structure of ITO/poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/aliphatic amine-functionalized perylene-diimide (PDINN)/Ag. The PBDB-T/ThPF-4F active layer of LBL OSCs was prepared by sequentially spin-coating the pristine donor and acceptor thin films as the bottom and the upper layers in the active layers. The PBDB-T and ThPF-4F layers were not prepared from the conventional orthogonal solvent system, but from the PBDB-T solution in o-DCB:CB/CB (4:1, v/v) dual-solvent and ThPF-4F solution in CB. Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDB-T films prepared from its solutions in o-DCB, CB, and o-DCB:CB, respectively. The films prepared from o-DCB and o-DCB:CB solutions exhibit a ∼10 nm red shift for the maximum absorption peak compared to that from CB. However, considering the poor morphology of the PBDB-T film prepared from o-DCB, we cannot use it individually as the solvent to make the PBDB-T film. The ThPF-4F layer morphology could be precisely controlled by adding a 0.5 vol% CN additive. The BHJ OSCs were optimized from the donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio (1:0.8 to 1:1.2), solvent additives (0.5% DIO, or 0.25 ∼1.0% CN, by volume ratio) to thermal annealing temperature (Tables S1–S4, ESI†). The device fabrication parameters are optimized as a 1:1 D/A ratio, 0.5 vol% CN additive, and 100 °C thermal annealing for 10 min. The LBL processing was optimized from donor solutions, donor and acceptor concentrations, and additives in the ThPF-4F solution to spin-coating speed for two layers (Tables S5–S8, ESI†). The optimal LBL processing parameters are listed as PBDB-T (o-DCB:CB = 4/1, v/v), 13.5 mg mL−1 for the donor and acceptor solutions, ThPF-4F solution in CB with a 0.5 vol% CN additive, and 2500 rpm for PBDB-T deposition and 2750 rpm for ThPF-4F deposition).

The resultant PBDB-T/ThPF-4F based LBL OSCs present an optimum PCE of 11.83% with a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 22.20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.79%. In contrast, the PBDB-T:ThPF-4F based BHJ device achieved a PCE of 11.10%, with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 21.27 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.65%. Compared with the BHJ devices, LBL OSCs have higher JSC and higher FF. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the BHJ and LBL devices are displayed in Fig. 2b and c. The LBL OSCs exhibit a strong photoresponse in the range of 450–900 nm, which is significantly higher than BHJ devices. The improved EQE may be originated from either more efficient extraction of charge carriers or the reduction of geminate recombination and the suppression of nongeminate charge recombination.30 The integrated JSC values of LBL based OSCs and BHJ OSCs are 21.29 mA cm−2 and 20.21 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in accordance with the values tested J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).

To understand the charge generation and dissociation process in LBL and BHJ OSCs, we evaluated the impact of a photocurrent density (Jph) on an effective voltage (Veff).31–34Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current densities of devices when illuminated and placed in the dark, respectively. Veff is given by Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied bias voltage.35 The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss, defined by Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) under short circuit conditions. Jsat is the saturated Jph value when Veff is ≥ 2 V.36 The plot of Jphversus Veff with different device structures is shown in Fig. 2d. Jsat is calculated as 23.24 and 21.86 mA cm−2, while Pdiss values are calculated as 95% and 93% for LBL and BHJ OSCs, respectively. Usually, high Pdiss indicates more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction. Compared to BHJ OSCs, LBL OSCs can provide more D/A interfaces for charge extraction channels. In order to further study the charge recombination of BHJ devices and LBL devices, we plot both Voc and Jsc against the light intensity (Plight) in Fig. 2e. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed by Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where α is an exponential factor that reflects the biomolecular charge recombination.37 The extracted α values for BHJ OSCs and LBL OSCs are 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. The α values are very close to 1, indicating more weaker biomolecular recombination occurring in LBL OSCs.38–40 Moreover, the relationship between Voc and Plight was studied to further understand the charge recombination behavior.41,42 Generally, the slope of the fitting line close to 2kT/q (K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge) illustrates the monomolecular recombination dominates in OSCs, while the slope close to 1kT/q indicates the dominant bimolecular recombination.43 Monomolecular recombination or trap-assisted recombination refers to the annihilation of bonding hole–electron pairs due to morphological traps or interfacial defects in trap states or recombination center.44,45 In this work, slopes of 1.04kT/q and 1.06kT/q were obtained for BHJ and LBL OSCs, respectively. To this end, we can infer that the trap-assisted recombination is suppressed effectively in LBL OSC devices, since holes and electrons can be well separated at the donor/acceptor interface before further being transported through the donor and acceptor layers. On the other hand, changes in the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of PBDB-T can reflect changes in the exciton dissociation process.46 The fluorescence quenching efficiency of the polymer donor by the acceptor in BHJ OSCs is 73.45%, which is lower than that in the LBL device (80.84%), indicating that the photoinduced charge transfer of the LBL system is enhanced (Fig. 2f).
To study the charge transport properties of the BHJ OSCs and LBL OSCs, the charge mobilities were evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method,47,48 with the results shown in Fig. S15 and Table S9 (ESI†). The hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag, while the electron-only devices adopted the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag. For BHJ OSCs, the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) are calculated as 4.97 × 10−6 and 2.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The LBL devices exhibit higher μe and μh values of 6.81 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.11 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The corresponding μh/μe ratios are calculated to be 5.37 for BHJ and 4.57 for LBL OSCs. The more balanced charge transport in LBL OSCs accounts for their higher JSC and FF. The corresponding J0.5–V curves are presented in Fig. S15 (ESI†). The higher charge carrier mobilities and more balanced charge transport for LBL OSCs attribute to the reduced carrier recombination for higher JSC and FF. These results show the D/A interface created by the contact between the donor and the acceptor can effectively dissociate excitons.
The vertical phase distribution in the active layer ensures the interpenetration of the D/A network, simultaneously promotes the photogenerated exciton dissociation, charge extraction and separation in OSCs.49,50 The vertical phase distributions of the donor and acceptor in BHJ and LBL devices have been studied using film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy (FLAS).51–54Fig. 3a and d show the absorption spectra of the sublayers of the LBL and BHJ devices, respectively. The LBL devices show a higher degree of absorption response than BHJ ones, which is consistent with the UV-vis results (Fig. S11, ESI†). This further explains the reason why the LBL OSCs have higher JSC. PBDB-T shows a gradual weakening absorption peak intensity from the bottom to the top of the active layer, while ThPF-4F shows the opposite trend. This reflects the vertical gradient distributions of PDBDB-T and ThPF-4F in the active layer. The quantitative composition distribution of each component is plotted in Fig. 3b and e for the LBL and BHJ films, respectively. The enrichment of ThPF-4F in the cathode (PDINN/Ag) near region in the LBL film contributes to an efficient electron transport compared to the homogeneous distribution of the donor and acceptor in the BHJ film. We further performed numerical simulations on the distribution of excitons, using FLAS of the film and the performance of the optical interference between different layers in actual photovoltaic devices. Fig. 3c and 3f show the excitons generated within the entire active layers. Nevertheless, in LBL films, the excitons generated in the PBDB-T phase (the wavelength range 450–650 nm) are mainly located in the bottom part of the active layer. In the wavelength range of 450–650 nm, the exciton distribution intensity of the LBL device is higher than that in the BHJ device, which explains the reason why the former has a higher EQE response in this wavelength range. On the other hand, most of the photons absorbed by ThPF-4F, corresponding to the 600–900 nm wavelength range, generate excitons in the top part of the active layer. This shows that the vertical gradient distribution of the donor and acceptor in LBL OSCs provides a good channel for carrier transmission, which reduces the recombination loss and thus improves the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 3g). The optical exciton generation rate (G) curves of the LBL and BHJ devices are further simulated from FLAS under the illumination of solar AM1.5G by using a modified transfer-matrix optical method (Fig. S16, ESI†). Faster exciton generation can be observed in LBL films than BHJ ones when compared in the same depth of films.

To further study the phase separation morphology of the LBL and BHJ blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used.55 The neat PBDB-T film exhibits a fiber-like aggregation with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of around 1.34 nm, indicating that the neat PBDB-T film has a strong aggregation region resulting from its high crystalline property (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the neat ThPF-4F film exhibits a smooth surface with an RMS surface roughness of 0.65 nm (Fig. 4b). It is noted that the LBL deposited PBDB-T/ThPF-4F film exhibited a more uniform and smooth surface compared to the PBDB-T:ThPF-4F blend film, with RMS surface roughness values of 1.63 and 2.65 nm, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). The film morphology was further observed using TEM images (Fig. 4e–h). Due to the percolation behavior during LBL deposition, the PBDB-T/ThPF-4F film shows excellent miscibility and more appropriate nanoscale phase separation in comparison to the PBDB-T:ThPF-4F based BHJ film. Such a favorable morphology accounts for the observed excellent exciton dissociation and charge transport processes in the PBDB-T/ThPF-4F based LBL OSCs.

The contact angle measurement was carried out to analyze the surface composition of the donor and acceptor in the blend films. Fig. 5a shows the contact angle of water (H2O) or diiodomethane (CH2I2) on the PBDB-T, ThPF-4F, PBDB-T:ThPF-4F and PBDB-T/ThPF-4F blend films (Table S10, ESI†). The surface energy of each film is calculated according to the Wu model.56 The neat ThPF-4F film has a higher surface energy of 39.01 mN m−1, while the surface energy of the neat PBDB-T film is 33.09 mN m−1. The surface energy of the blend film indicates the enriched component on the top surface. The BHJ blend film shows a surface energy of 33.46 mN m−1. Compared with the BHJ film, the PBDB-T/ThPF-4F based LBL film shows a much lower surface energy of 32.68 mN m−1, suggesting the enrichment of the acceptor on the top surface. This is beneficial for the charge collection in LBL OSCs with the conventional device structure.

(b) J–V curves of the PBDB-T:PC71BM/ThPF-4F device and PBDB-T:ThPF-4F:PC71BM device. (c) Normalized PCE of the corresponding PBDB-T:PC71BM/ThPF-4F and PBDB-T:ThPF-4F:PC71BM OSCs working continuously under a light illumination of over 100 h. 
On the basis of the binary OSCs, we further improved the device performance by introducing a certain amount of PC71BM into the active layers. Therefore, the ternary LBL device (designated as PBDB-T:PC71BM/ThPF-4F) was fabricated by depositing the PBDB-T film from its o-DCB:CB solution with 10 wt% PC71BM addition. PBDB-T:PC71BM/ThPF-4F based LBL OSCs present an optimal PCE of 11.97%, with a VOC of 0.80 V, a JSC of 24.18 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.89%. Such a performance is much higher than the PBDB-T:ThPF-4F:PC71BM (1:1:0.1) BHJ devices, which exhibit a PCE of 11.40%, with a VOC of 0.81 V, a FF of 60.05% and a JSC of 23.43 mA cm−2. The corresponding J–V curves of the ternary blend based devices are shown in Fig. 5b. Considering the efficiency advantages of the LBL ternary OSCs, we further evaluated the light-soaking stability of the devices under continuous light illumination (an intensity of 100 mW cm−2) using white LEDs in an atmospheric environment for 100 h at a room temperature of 20 °C (Fig. 5c). During the successive operation and testing, the photovoltaic parameters were measured at a time interval of 10 h. The LBL OSCs retained 87% of their original PCE, while the ternary BHJ devices retained 84% of their original efficiency, respectively. The relatively better device stability is related to the good distribution of the donor and acceptor in LBL devices, which reduces the problem of donor or acceptor aggregation during the operation of BHJ devices.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new 3,4-bis(3-fluoro-4-methylphenyl) thiophene cored UFA (ThPF-4F) and fabricated high-performance OSCs with the polymer donor PBDB-T using LBL processing via a non-orthogonal solvent method. LBL OSCs (11.83%) exhibited better performance than the BHJ counterparts (11.10%). More specific studies show that LBL devices exhibit lower biomolecular recombination lower than BHJ ones, where trap-assisted recombination is suppressed and corresponding to the higher JSC. Further investigation reveals that the LBL active layer possesses a smoother surface morphology to contribute a higher FF. Film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy and contact angle measurement indicate that the layered structure of LBL is favorable for the accumulation of donors and acceptors in the vertical direction. This gradient distribution enables both sides to have a higher phase purity, which greatly enhances the light absorption in active layers with reduced energy loss. The ternary LBL OSCs by introducing 10 wt% PC71BM into the donor layer contribute further improved PCE of 11.97%, which is also higher than the corresponding ternary BHJ device. Our work demonstrates that the combination of UFAs with LBL device processing is promising to achieve cost-effective high-performance OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All commercially available chemical reagents were obtained and used directly without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium before use, and 1,2-dichloroethane was dried with calcium hydride. Polymer donors PBDB-T were purchased from Solarmer Materials, Inc.

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCE III nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscope with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard substance. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using an Evolution 220, Thermo Fisher spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D Chenhua, Shanghai) with a Pt plate as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) dichloromethane solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The CV curves were recorded and calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (−4.8 eV versus vacuum level). The materials were measured by coating a film on the surface of the working electrode. The HOMO and LUMO levels are calculated by the following formula: EHOMO = −[EOX + (4.8 − EFC/FC+)], ELUMO = −[ERED + (4.8 − EFC/FC+)], where EOX/ERED means the potential from the first oxidation or reduction peak and EFc/Fc+ means the half-wave potential of the external standard.
Theoretical calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set were performed utilizing Gaussian 09 to evaluate molecular conformations, energy levels and dipole moments. Particularly, n-hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups were replaced by methyl to shorten the computational time.
Device fabrication
Both layer-by-layer (LBL) and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs adopt the conventional device structure as ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINN/Ag. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 15 min each time. The cleaned ITO glass was subsequently dried by a nitrogen flow and applied a final 180 s oxygen plasma treatment to eliminate any remaining organic components. BHJ OSCs used the conventional method to prepare active layers out of mixture solutions of the donor and acceptor. The PBDB-T:ThPF-4F (1:1, w/w) solutions in chlorobenzene (CB) with a concentration of 10 mg mL-1 (for polymer) were added with 0.5 vol% CN as the additive and stirred overnight at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The mixture solution was spin-coated at 3000 rounds per minute (RPM) for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. After the device was cooled, the aliphatic amine-functionalized perylene-diimide (PDINN) solution (in methanol with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the top of the active layer, and the Ag (150 nm) layer was successively deposited by thermal evaporation. The hole transport layer (PEDOT:PSS), electron transport layer (PDINN) and Ag electrode for LBL OSCs were prepared in the same way as BHJ devices. The difference lies in the preparation method for the active layers. LBL OSCs adopt a layer-by-layer processing method for the active layer, where the bottom layer was the donor PBDB-T and the acceptor as the upper layer. The PBDB-T layer was prepared from its solution (13.5 mg mL−1) in a dual-solvent of o-DCB and CB. The best volume ratio for the o-DCB:CB mixture solvent is 4:1. The PBDB-T solution was spin-casted at 2500 rpm for 30 s. ThPF-4F solution in CB (13.5 mg mL−1) with 0.5 vol% CN was spin-coated at 2750 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min.
Device measurements
The device current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of solar cells were performed in the glovebox with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an Oriel 300 W Solar Simulator and calibrated by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter. The typical active area is 3.97 mm2 as defined by a metal mask with an aperture. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was also calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag and hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag were used to evaluate the charge mobility by the SCLC model. The charge mobility can be determined based on the Mott–Gurney equation with the Poole–Frenkel correction:  Here, εr is the dielectric constant of organic materials, ε0 is the free space permittivity, L is the thickness of the active layer, μ0 is the charge carrier mobility, and V is the applied voltage.
