    , Accepted 20th May 2016First published on 23rd May 2016AbstractThe perovskite solar cell is based on organic–inorganic lead halides such as methylammonium CH3NH3PbI3 or formamidinium HC(NH2)2PbI3 as light harvesters. Since the first report on a long-term, durable, 9.7% efficient solid-state perovskite solar cell in 2012, the perovskite solar cell has received great attention because of facile processing and superb photovoltaic performance. As a result, a power conversion efficiency exceeding 22% was certified in 2016. To achieve a high efficiency perovskite solar cell, understanding the crystal structure and opto-electronic properties of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are of importance. Growth of perovskite on substrate without traps and grain boundaries is equally important for attaining high efficiency. In this article, the emergence of the perovskite solar cell, the structural and opto-electronic characteristics of perovskite materials and the methodologies of perovskite crystal growth both from solution and on a substrate are reviewed.
1. Introduction
Light-absorbing materials being used for perovskite solar cells contain organic cations in the A-site of an APb(or Sn)X3 perovskite (X = I, Br or mixed halides) discovered in 1978.1,2 MAPbX3 (M = CH3NH3) changes its color from colorless for X = Cl to orange for X = Br, to red for X = mixed Br and I and to black for X = I, which indicates that the band gap of lead halide perovskite decreases as the anion size increases. This implies that methylammonium lead iodide is a potential candidate photovoltaic material because of its panchromatic light absorption property. However, little attention was paid to three-dimensional MAPbI3 because low-dimensional perovskite attracted more attention due to the transition of its electrical property from insulator to metal by lowering the dimensionality.3 In 2009, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 were first used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cell structures and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% was demonstrated,4 wherein the relatively low PCE was ascribed to the precursor concentration as low as 8 wt%. In 2011, Park et al. proposed a saturated concentration of about 40 wt% as an optimal precursor solution for perovskite coating, which eventually led to a PCE of 6.5%.5 Because organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite dissolves readily in polar solvents due to ionic bonding characteristics, the liquid junction structure, such as in a dye-sensitized solar cell may not be suitable for a perovskite solar cell. In 2012, Park et al. solved the problem by replacing liquid redox electrolyte with a solid hole conductor such as spiro-MeOTAD, which demonstrated a long-term durable high efficiency perovskite solar cell with a PCE approaching 10%.6 Snaith et al. also reported a solid-state perovskite solar cell with the same HTM but a different oxide, Al2O3, around the same time, which demonstrated a PCE approaching 11%.7
Reports on the solid-state perovskite solar cells triggered a surge of interest in perovskite solar cells. Searching the publications through Web of Science (http://ipscience.thomsonreuters.com/product/web-of-science/) found around 1300 peer-reviewed papers on perovskite solar cells published in 2015, which is almost three times higher than the number of publications in 2014. The pioneering studies on solid-state perovskite solar cells in 2012 obtained a certified PCE of 22.1% achieved in 2016 [http://www.nrel.gov].
2. Crystal structures
The unit cell of perovskite, ABX3, contains octahedral BX6 and cubo-octahedral AX12 units (Fig. 1). Perovskite phase formation can be simply expected from the Goldschmidt tolerance factor together with the octahedral factor based on effective ionic radii.8–11 When adopting the Pb2+ ion in the B site, the radii of A-site cations range from about 1.6 to about 2.5 Å, with a tolerance factor in the range of 0.8–1.0.12 Thus, CH3NH3+ (= MA) and HC(NH2)2+ (= FA) ions are suitable for A-site cations because of their radii of about 1.8–2.0 Å. Unlike the oxide perovskite formed at high temperature, halide perovskites, including organic cations form at relatively low temperature due to lower Madelung constant and more ionic characteristics.13

Kanatzidis et al. studied Sn- and Pb-based perovskites in detail, wherein MAPbI3, MASnI3, FAPbI3, FASnI3, and solid solution MASn1−xPbxI3 were investigated in terms of structures and opto-electronic properties.14 Materials were synthesized by three different approaches, including mortar grinding of starting materials in air at room temperature, a fusion of starting materials in a silica tube at high temperature and a solution growth of single crystals. The mortar grinding method and the high temperature fusion method produced unreacted precursors and nonstoichiometric products, respectively. For the high temperature process, it should be noticed that the prolonged heating of PbI2 in air might produce PbO due to liberation of I2. Eventually, it was found that the solution method led to stoichiometric perovskites and the lowest number of defects. In terms of structural phase transitions of organic–inorganic lead iodide perovskites, phases can be classified into the high temperature α-phase, the intermediate temperature β-phase, and the low temperature γ-phase, while the non-perovskite yellow phase is termed as the δ-phase.14 The δ-phase can be found in FAPbI3 (yellow color) with one-dimensional PbI6 octahedra. In Fig. 2, perovskite building blocks stabilized at room temperature are depicted, where Sn-based perovskites and FAPbI3 are stabilized as α-phase, whereas the room temperature structure of MAPbI3 is β-phase. Pseudo-cubic MAPbI3 with α-phase exists at temperatures higher than 50 °C.15 β-phase MAPbI3 has a tetragonal crystal system with space group I4cm and unit cell dimensions of a = 8.849(2) and c = 12.642(2) Å. The absorption coefficient of β-phase MAPbI3 is slightly higher than that of α-phase MAPbI3.

The thermogravimetric nature of Sn- and Pb-based perovskites is similar, wherein decomposition occurs before melting at temperatures higher than 300 °C. For instance, MAPbI3 is decomposed to MAI and PbI2, wherein loss of MAI occurs first in the form of organic amine and HI and loss of HI occurs next. The decomposition temperature of MAI is roughly 280 °C. For the resistivity, MASnI3, FASnI3 and FAPbI3 exhibited static resistance (ohmic behavior), whereas MAPbI3 shows non-ohmic characteristics (dynamic resistance) from the I–V measurements.14
3. Opto-electronic properties of polycrystalline and single crystal MAPbI3
Opto-electronic properties of organic–inorganic lead iodides may depend on synthetic routes and crystallinity. Because perovskite adopted for solar cells is usually prepared by a solution process, it is required to investigate opto-electronic properties of the solution-processed perovskite layers. Optical properties of MAPbI3 films were reviewed by Green et al.,16 wherein absorption coefficients were found to range from 2.5 × 104 cm−1 to 8.9 × 104 cm−1 at 620 nm. The real part of the refractive index of MAPbI3 is in the range of 2.3–2.6. The dielectric constant for MAPbI3 was measured to be 5–7 or a higher value of about 18 from capacitive measurement.17 Effective mass of electron and hole for the solution-processed MAPbI3 was estimated to be 0.23 and 0.29, respectively.18 Although balanced charge transport is expected, the electron diffusion length (≈130 nm) is 1.4 times longer than the hole diffusion length (≈90 nm) for the solution-processed MAPbI3,19 whereas hole diffusion length (≈800 nm) is 4.6 times longer than electron diffusion length (≈180 nm) for FAPbI3.20 Polycrystalline MAPbI3 was found to have relatively low charge diffusion length compared to the single crystal.21,22 Hall measurement revealed that MAPbI3 has close to n-type properties but FAPbI3 has p-type character.14 However, the measured data were not based on the perovskite morphology for real solar cell devices. A p-type MAPbI3 is theoretically feasible by doping some group IA, IB, or VIA elements, such as Na, K, Rb, Cu, and O, under iodine-rich growth conditions.23
Charge-carrier mobility, playing an important role in charge extraction to the electrode, was estimated to be about 27 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FAPbI3,24 which is similar to the charge-carrier mobility of the solution-processed MAPbI3.25 In the mixed iodide and bromide FAPb(BryI1−y)3, charge-carrier mobility decreased with increasing bromide up to y = 0.5 due to the presence of an amorphous phase, and gradually increased again with further increase in Br content.24
Open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic–inorganic perovskite was estimated using internal PL quantum yield (iQY).26 The optically-implied Voc, reflecting the maximum Voc, was evaluated for MAPbI3−xBrx. The Voc deficit (Eg/q − Voc) was about 400 mV at 1 sun for the composition with band gap up to 1.97 eV, which means that electrical Voc of about 1.2 V can be expected for the band gap of 1.6 eV.26
Opto-electronic properties of single crystal MAPbX3 (X = I, Br and mixed I and Br) grown by different methods were also investigated although full devices with single crystal perovskite layers were not realized.27–30Fig. 3 displays various methods for growing single crystals of perovskites.31 MAPbI3 single crystals can be grown by a top-seeded solution-growth (TSSG) method in Fig. 3A,28 a hot-solution cooling-down (HSCD) growth method based on lead acetate hydrate in Fig. 3B27 and an anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (ASVSC) method in Fig. 3C.29 Much higher carrier mobility and longer diffusion length were measured for the single crystal samples. However, a large discrepancy in the measured data was found, which indicates that charge transport behavior is highly sensitive to the material's morphologies and characterization methods. For instance, the presence of an amorphous phase or grain boundary inevitably reduces carrier transport mobility. To get the intrinsic charge carrier diffusion length, not only are precise measurements for carrier mobility and recombination lifetime needed, but also well-defined crystals are required. It is expected that the complete absence of grain boundaries in the single crystals will decrease charge recombination at the grain boundaries, which can increase the device Voc and fill factor (FF). Fig. 4 shows that the absorption edge and external quantum efficiency cutoff of MAPbI3 single crystals (3 mm and 200 μm thick) are extended to 850 nm, compared to the 800 nm absorption edge for polycrystalline thin film (300 nm thick), which is able to improve theoretical Jsc from 27.5 mA cm−2 to 33.0 mA cm−2. More than 25% is expected in case where the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite grains are effectively passivated.31

A solvothermal method was proposed to synthesize single crystals of the mixed halide perovskite MAPb(Br1−xClx)3. Interestingly, the Cl/Br ratio in the single crystals was found to be larger than that of the precursor solution, which is indicative of an unusual crystal growth mechanism.32
A 5 mm size single crystal of FAPbI3 grown by modified inverse temperature crystallization33 showed longer carrier lifetime of 484 ns than polycrystalline FAPbI3 with a lifetime of 227 ns. Carrier mobility of 4.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was estimated from SCLC (space charge limited current) measurement and the conductivity of a single FAPbI3 crystal was determined to be 1.1 × 10−7 Ω cm−1, approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of the MAPbI3 single crystal.
4. Methodologies for polycrystalline perovskite growth on substrate
4.1. Growth by solution-processed two-step method
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite films can form in mild conditions due to low lattice energy.13 A perovskite layer has been prepared on a substrate by spin-coating of the precursor solution containing MAI and PbI2 followed by evaporation of solvent; this is a one-step direct deposition method. Perovskite films are alternatively fabricated via deposition of MAI on the pre-deposited inorganic PbI2 film a two-step deposition method. Mitzi et al. proposed the first two-step sequential deposition method,34 wherein the pre-deposited PbI2 films by either vapor evaporation or spin coating were dipped in MAI solution to form MAPbI3. A 2-propanol solution containing MAI was used to avoid the dissolution of the PbI2 film. Grätzel et al. applied this two-step method to a perovskite solar cell in 2013,35 wherein the spin-coated and dried PbI2 layer was dipped in a 2-propanol solution with MAI. By this method, a certified PCE of 14.1% was obtained. However, the dipping process in the two-step deposition method may affect reproducibility of photovoltaic performance because morphology of the perovskite film is expected to depend on dipping time, concentration and temperature of the MAI solution. Consecutive two-step spin-coating technology was developed by Park et al.36 to solve the problem caused by the dipping process.
In the two-step spin-coating procedure, instead of dipping the PbI2 film in the MAI solution, spin-coating of the desired quantity of MAI solution induced well-defined nanocubic perovskite, wherein nanocuboid size was found to significantly depend on the concentration of MAI solution. Fig. 5 shows the two-step spin-coating procedure along with the crystal growth process, wherein perovskite crystals grow bigger for the low concentration such as 0.038 M MAI solution (Fig. 5b) but with small crystals already fully occupying the substrate in the initial stage for the high concentration of 0.063 M (Fig. 5c), inhibiting further growth. The cross-section SEM image revels that cuboids are well-developed in the capping layer (Fig. 5d).

The crystal growth mechanism could be explained by thermodynamic Gibbs free energy change.37 Interaction formula between grain sizes (Y) and MAI concentration (X) was derived based on volume and surface tension changes in Gibbs free energy in eqn (1). (1)
The observed grain sizes fit well with eqn (1). In addition to dependence of grain size on MAI concentration, reaction temperature was found to be a critical factor affecting grain size. Temperature (both the substrate and the MAI solution) was varied from −10 °C to 50 °C at the given MAI concentration of 0.050 M. The grain size increased with temperature, which can be explained thermodynamically as follows. The critical free energy is larger at high temperature than at low temperature, which leads to decrease in the number of nuclei, thus growth to bigger grains is expected. Fig. 6 shows the effects of MAI concentration and reaction temperature on perovskite film quality associated with grain size.

It was found that large cuboids (around 700–800 nm) prepared from 0.038 M MAI solution exhibited the highest Jsc compared to smaller ones, but the highest Voc was obtained from those of medium size (around 200 nm). On the other hand, the smallest cuboid prepared from 0.063 M MAI solution demonstrated poor photovoltaic parameters. High Jsc from large grains is ascribed to higher light harvesting efficiency, associated with improved internal light scattering, along with high charge extraction ability, as measured by photo-CELIV.36 High Voc was found to correlate with fast charge mobility, reducing probability for charge recombination, and minimal non-radiative recombination as evidenced by micro PL studies.38 In the two-step spin-coating procedure at ambient conditions with relatively high humidity, the morphology and photovoltaic performance of MAPbI3 was significantly dependent on the deposition conditions for the PbI2 layer. The pre-heated substrate at around 50 °C was required to produce inter-connected perovskite grains.39 Some modified two-step methods were also proposed to achieve better morphology and/or control of crystal growth via vapor treatment of the pre-coated PbI2 film,40 non-thermal inter-diffusion method,41 electrochemical deposition of PbO film,42 formation of an intermediate PbI2(DMSO)x (ref. 43) and deposition of (PbI2)1−x(PbCl2)x (x = 0.02–0.1) prior to treatment with MAI to determine the chloride effect on crystal growth.44 A morphology-controllable sequential deposition was developed by adding a very small amount of MAI in the precursor PbI2 film. The additive MAI eventually led to 10-fold faster formation of planar MAPbI3 film without PbI2 residue. The optimal composition was found to be PbI2·0.15MAI.45
4.2. Growth by anti-solvent method
Although a one-step coating procedure is better than two-step procedure in terms of processing time and cost, a simple one-step method was found to be inferior to a two-step method due to poor morphology.46 Anti-solvent engineering was proposed to control the crystal growth kinetics in the one-step coating procedure.47 The precursor of MAI and PbI2 dissolved in the mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), was spin-coated and treated with anti-solvent (not dissolving the MAPbI3) such as toluene while spinning the precursor solution. Perovskite film prepared by the solvent engineering technique showed well-developed grains with sizes ranging from 200 nm to 500 nm, which delivered a PCE as high as 18.4%.48
The fast deposition-crystallization (FDC) method was developed to obtain uniform MAPbI3 film,49 where a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution with MAI and PbI2 was first spin-coated and then anti-solvent was quickly added to promote fast nucleation and growth of MAPbI3. Chlorobenzene was most effective among the 12 tested solvents and large grains approaching micron scale were able to be obtained.
Growth of mixed halide perovskite films in the anti-solvent bath was reported.50 Crystal growth kinetics depends on Br content in the mixed iodide–bromide perovskite case. It was found that the growth of perovskite grains from a precursor solution tends to be more rapid with increasing Br content. Thus, an effective decoupling of the nucleation and the crystal growth is required for the case of Br-rich perovskites. This was enabled by introducing simple stirring during anti-solvent bathing (such as anhydrous diethyl ether), wherein stirring was effective in homogeneous crystal growth, as can be observed in Fig. 7.

4.3. Growth by Lewis acid–base adduct approach
In addition to oxidation or reduction as a result of Lewis acid–base reaction, a complex can form if the energy level of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the Lewis acid is similar to that of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the Lewis base. Lewis acid–base adduct approach was proposed to achieve high efficiency perovskite solar cells via high quality of MAPbI3 films.51 Equimolar MAI, PbI2 and DMSO were dissolved in DMF, and spin-coated. The coated transparent film was treated with diethyl ether to selectively remove DMF, leading to the MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct. Smooth and large grain MAPbI3 film could be got by eliminating DMSO from the adduct. The adduct formation was confirmed by FTIR, where the SO stretching vibration of DMSO shifted to lower wavenumber upon interacting with PbI2 and MAI, as can be observed in Fig. 8. The adduct-induced MAPbI3 layer showed higher charge carrier mobility and extraction than the control sample without adduct procedure. The reproducible performance with the best PCE of 19.7% was achieved using the adduct method.

The adduct approach was also applied to form the FAPbI3 layer. DMSO was found to be an effective Lewis base for high quality MAPbI3 film; however, DMSO was not working well for the FAPbI3 case. Thiourea was found to be better Lewis base for the FAPbI3 adduct approach, probably due to a similarity of functional groups between the formamidinium cation and thiourea. Grain size increased with increasing thiourea content,52 which indicates that the Lewis base plays important role in the nature of chemical bonding in the adduct and controlling crystal growth.
4.4. Growth by vapor deposition method
Organic–inorganic perovskite film can be prepared by vacuum deposition process. Snaith et al. reported first the vacuum-deposited MAPbI3 film using dual source.53 Vapor reaction of MAI with PbI2 in high vacuum conditions resulted in a highly flat surface, but a trace of PbI2 was detected in the X-ray diffraction pattern, which underlines the fact that the chemical reaction is hard to complete in a vapor process compared to a solution process. For full conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3, a vapor-assisted solution process (VASP) was proposed, in which the solution-processed PbI2 film was treated with MAI vapor.54 The as-deposited PbI2 films were annealed in MAI vapor at 150 °C in an N2 atmosphere for full conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3, where an annealing time of at least 2 h was required. For the vapor deposition method, stoichiometry control seems to be difficult. Thus, development of a single source is required to obtain stoichiometric perovskite film.
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was introduced to form FAPbI3 films, wherein PbCl2 deposited substrate was exposed to FAI vapor using a two-zone tube furnace.55 Careful adjustments of vaporizing temperature, FAI concentration and substrate temperature are required to form high quality FAPbI3 film. Similarly, MAPbI3 could be prepared by CVD via a two-zone tube furnace. MAI and PbI2 or PbCl2 were placed in the high temperature zone, which was transported to the low temperature zone with substrate by means of the argon gas flow.56 However, the prepared MAPbI3 exhibited electron diffusion lengths of about 130 nm, being close to that in the conventional, solution-processed MAPbI3. A low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) under fully open-air conditions was successfully applied to form perovskite film.57 Perovskite prepared by LPCVD showed a better moisture tolerance property, probably due to its single crystalline nature.
A hybrid vapor/solid deposition was also developed, wherein high quality MAPbI3 perovskite was prepared via direct gas/solid deposition of spin coating HI + PbI2 precursor solution in a low concentration CH3NH2 atmosphere. This method was successfully applied to form the different lead halide perovskites MAPbI2Br and C2H5NH3PbI3 by spin coating HBr + PbI2 precursor solution in a CH3NH2 atmosphere and HI + PbI2 in a C2H5NH2 atmosphere, respectively.58
4.5. Solvent vapor annealing method
Solvent vapor annealing methods were proposed to improve perovskite crystallinity and morphology. Post-treatment of perovskite film with methanol vapor led to improved carrier lifetime, suppression of recombination and reduced dark current compared to the un-treated perovskite.59 Solvent polarity was found to affect perovskite grain morphology. Fig. 9 shows a schematic of the solvent annealing method.

A room temperature mixed solvent-vapor annealing (rtMSVA) method was also proposed to fabricate perovskite solar cells without the need for thermal annealing. The one-step spin-coated perovskite film was post-treated with vapor of the DMF/CB (chlorobenzene) mixed solvent in closed Petri dishes to convert colorless film to crystalline perovskite film in 6 min. The rtMSVA is expected to be a useful method for flexible plastic devices because this method provides a non-thermal annealing process.60
4.6. Growth of nanowire MAPbI3
One-dimensional (1D) perovskite nanowire was fabricated by the solution-processed two-step method, wherein a small amount of aprotic solvent in isopropanol solution of MAI was used to form a nanowire.61Fig. 10 shows effect of aprotic solvent DMF concentration included in isopropanol solution of MAI. In the presence of DMF, morphology changes from 3D to 1D nanowire. 50 μL DMF in 5 mL isopropanol was found to be the optimal formulation to form long perovskite nanowires. The anisotropic growth of MAPbI3 in the presence of DMF can be explained by a liquid catalyst cluster model, i.e., partial dissolution of PbI2 by polar aprotic solvent provides a key process for nanowire growth. Thus, the solubility of PbI2 in the aprotic solvent can affect nanowire formation. DMF was found to be a better solvent in forming nanowires than DMSO because of the solubility difference. GBL could not lead to nanowires due to the less soluble nature of PbI2 in GBL.

5. Conclusions
Crystal growth methodologies and opto-electronic properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskites were reviewed. To design highly efficient perovskite solar cells, it is important to understand basic opto-electronic and physical properties, such as absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric constant, effective mass and charge diffusion lengths, because they are related to light absorption, charge transport and collection. Crystal growth engineering is equally important for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. When growing crystals, one should consider a way to minimize non-radiative recombination. Anti-solvent engineering and adduct methods are highly effective procedures for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. Vapor methods, either in vacuum or in air, have been recently proposed to form highly crystalline perovskite films. Although a PCE as high as 22% was already certified by the solution-processed method, hysteresis and stability are still challenging issues to overcome in perovskite solar cells.
