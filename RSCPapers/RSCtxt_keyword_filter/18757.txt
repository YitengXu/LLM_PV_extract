    , Accepted 27th November 2018First published on 30th November 2018AbstractIn this work, two new indolo-[3,2-b]-carbazole (ICz) core-based non-fullerene acceptors (ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2) with an A–π–D–π–A backbone were designed, synthesized, and characterized and the influence of molecular engineering on the terminal end groups on their performance in organic solar cells (OSCs) was systematically examined. The ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 acceptors showed strong and wide-ranging absorption profiles from 350–800 nm in solution and film with high molar extinction coefficients of 6.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. These acceptors were employed along with a low band gap D–A conjugated polymer P as a donor for polymer solar cells and, after optimization of the active layers, the P:ICz-Rd2- and P:ICz-RdCN2-based devices offered overall power conversion efficiencies of 7.88% and 9.76%, which are higher than that of their PC71BM-processed counterpart (5.89%). The enhanced power conversion efficiencies for these non-fullerene acceptors may be related to the wide absorption spectra of the active layers and their low voltage loss.
1. Introduction
Fullerene-based acceptors, such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), are widely empolyed electron transport materials in solution-processed bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) solar cells with polymer or small molecule donor materials and have attained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 12%.1–7 However, further improvement of the PCEs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is a great challenge in view of the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene-based acceptors, including weak light absorption in the visible region of solar radiation, strong tendency of molecular aggregation, difficulty in adjusting the energy levels via molecular alteration due to the narrow functionalization of fullerene, and their expensive synthesis and purification. To overcome these shortcomings, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been demonsterated as promising replacements of fullerene-based acceptors. In (BHJ) solar cells, two types of developments have attracted tremendous attention; one is the evolution of novel materials and another is the development and improvement of device fabrication strategy regarding mechanical flexibility, light weight, and low cost. Recently, non-fullerene (NF) OSCs have made significant progress with PCEs of up to 14% due to the development of new active materials and efficient device optimization.8–12 Among the reported NFAs, calamitic-type acceptors with an A–D–A configuration have been demonstrated to be the most successful to date. NFAs having a fused-ring central donor (ladder type) unit have attracted most interest in this research field because indacenodithiophene (IDT)13–17 and indacenodi-[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT)18–21 core-based acceptors have achieved incredible PCEs in OSCs. Ladder-type NFAs show extended absorption toward longer wave lengths, efficient intramolecular charge transfer, and appropriate aggregation and crystalinity.22 Because of these reasons, reseachers are concentrating on the development of novel ladder-type NFAs to improve the performance of OSCs. The current synthetic strategy for the development of efficient calamitic-type NFAs are mainly concentrated on modulation of the π-conjugated central core,13,23–27 π-spacer,28–33 terminal electron-withdrawing groups,9,34–37 and solubilizing group side alkyl chain.21,38–40 Among these, the development of a new π-conjugated central core is considerded as the most adaptable method to develop a large number of calamitic-type NFAs via molecular engineering. The optical and electronic properties of such a type of π-conjugated backbone can be tailored easily via the incorporation of a D/A unit to increase the π-conjugation and to reduce the band gap of molecules. Hence, it is of paramount importance to develop a novel ladder-type central core unit with better geometrical and optoelectronic properties to further enhance the performance of NFA-based OSCs.
Carbazole is an electron-rich heterocyclic aromatic compound containing two six-membered (benzene) rings fused on either side of a nitrogen containing a five-membered ring. To date, a variety of carbazole-based NFAs have been explored for OSC applications (Fig. 1 and Table S3, ESI†). Lim et al. developed three NFAs using carbazole as a central donor unit flanked with different electron-withdrawing units. OSCs based on these acceptors offered a highest PCE of up to 2.56% using poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as a donor molecule.7 NFA with carbazole as the central donor and malononitrile as a terminal group attached via a benzothiadiazole linker was explored by Beaujuge and co-workers and delivered a PCE of over 5.3% in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with the polymer donor PCE10.41 Another NFA (N7) based on carbazole as the core and diketopyrolopyrole (DPP) as the terminal unit was developed and achieved a PCE of over 2.30% after blending with P3HT as the donor material.42 Sun et al. reported a carbazole-based ladder-type NFA (DTCC-IC) with a dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) central electron-donating core flanked with a strong electron-difficient 3-(dicyanomethylene)indane-1-one (IC) and then an OSC device based on a PTB7-Th:DTCC-IC blend film achieved a PCE of up to 6%.43 Jen and co-workers explored two new NFAs (DTPC-IC and DTCP-DFIC) with ultranarrow band gaps based on a dithienopicenocarbazole (DTPC) core terminated with IC and DFIC end groups that offered PCEs of up to 10.21% when fabricated with a PTB7-Th donor material.44

The carbazole derivative ICZ is a fused five-membered ladder-type rigid and planar π-conjugated moiety containing two binding states for an alkyl substituent that increases the solubility of the resultant organic semiconductors. ICZ shows the maximum absorption at wavelengths of 336 nm and 342 nm, which can be red-shifted via introduction of aromatic units at both ends. ICZ has been employed to develop organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) materials and hole-transport materials (HTM) for organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).45–50 ICZ is an electron-donor unit and its derivatives are highly planar and rigid with remarkable photophysical properties, such as thermal- and photodurability, good morphological stability, and advantageous charge-transport properties.
In this work, we report on the design, synthesis, and characterization of new calamitic-type NFAs (ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2) bearing indolo-[3,2-b]-carbazole as a central donor unit, electron-difficient benzothiadiazole as the π-spacer, strong electron-withdrawing groups 3-ethyl rhodanine and dicyano-n-hexyl rhodanine as the terminal end groups, and two 2-ethyl hexyl side chain as the solubilizing groups, respectively (Fig. 2c). The synthesis of these molecules was expected to acquire new n-type semiconductors with excellent performance. It has been observed that increasing the strength of terminal acceptor groups in calamitic-type acceptor molecules shifts the absorption band toward a longer wavelength and simultaneously lowers the position of the FMO energy levels and reduces the band gap. These two non-fullerenes were used as acceptors along with a low band gap D–A coplymer P as the donor for the fabrication of solution-processed polymer solar cells. This polymer showed a strong absorption spectrum in the 650–950 nm wavelength region,45 which is complementary to these NFSMAs. After optimization of the active layers, the overall PCEs of the ICz-Rd2- and ICz-RdCN2-based PSCs were about 7.88% and 9.76% with energy losses of 0.48 eV and 0.51 eV, respectively. These values are quite high compared to PC71BM (PCE = 5.89% and energy loss = 0.82 eV). Moreover, the higher PCE of ICz-RdCN2-based PSCs than that of the ICz-Rd2 counterpart may be related to their better exciton-dissociation efficiency and charge-collection efficiency, due to the compact π–π stacking distance and high electron mobility.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Design and synthesis
The synthetic routes of the two new NFAs (ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2) are illustrated in Scheme 1. The detail synthetic schemes are provided in the ESI† (Scheme S1). A Suzuki-cross-coupling reaction of compound 4 with Br-BT-CHO in the presence of [Pd(PPh3)4] catalyst yielded the dialdahyde compound 5. ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 were obtained via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction using compound 5 and 3-ethyl rhodanine and n-hexyl dicyano rhodanine, respectively. ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 showed good solubility in organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (DCM), o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), at room temperature. The structures of all intermediates and final molecules were fully distinguished by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MASS, and FT-IR spectroscopy (ESI,† Fig. S2–S25). Their optoelectronic characterstics were studied by UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3) and cyclic voltammetry analysis (ESI,† Fig. S1(b)). In addition, their optimized geometry, frontier molecular orbital (FMO), and electronic dispersal energy levels were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 4).

2.2 Photophysical and electronic properties
To assess the light-harvesting properties of compounds ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2, their UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in chloroform (CHCl3) solution and in thin film prepared by spin-coating from CHCl3 solution (Fig. 3), and the detailed optical parameters are listed in Table 1. ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 exhibited strong and broad absorption profiles ranging from 350–800 nm with molar extinction coefficients of 6.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively (ESI,† Fig. S1(a)). The absorption band at shorter wavelength was accredited to the π–π* transition, whereas the absorption band at longer wavelength region was assigned to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition from donor to acceptor units in the molecule. The charge-transfer (CT) absorption bands of ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 in the thin films were red-shifted by 41 nm and 60 nm compared to their solution spectra, indicating that strong intermolecular π–π interaction occurred in the solid state, respectively. Furthermore, ICz-RdCN2 exhibited broad absorption spectrum in thin film with a resolved shoulder peak at 594 nm, which is advantageous to enhance the short circuit current density (Jsc) of OSCs. In comparison with ICz-Rd2, ICz-RdCN2 exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum both in solution and in thin film condition, indicating a strong ICT transition in ICz-RdCN2 due to the presence of dicyanomethylene groups at the terminal acceptor units.

The electrochemical characteristics of both acceptors were evaluated by performing cyclic-voltammetry (CV) experiments in dry DCM solution (ESI,† Fig. S1(b)). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.59 eV and −3.88 eV for ICz-Rd2 and −5.58 eV and −3.98 eV for ICz-RdCN2, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of both acceptor molecules were almost similar, while the 0.1 eV lower LUMO energy level of ICz-RdCN2 than that of ICz-Rd2 could be attributed to the stronger electron-accepting property of n-hexyl dicyano rhodanine compared with 3-ethylrhodanine unit. The optical band gaps of ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 were calculated from the onset to be 1.71 eV and 1.61 eV, respectively. The polymer donor P was selected for device fabrication because of its complimentary absorption and well-matching frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels with both acceptors.51 The polymer donor P exhibited strong absorption ranging from the 560–920 nm wavelength region with maximum absorption at 760 nm and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P were −5.15/−3.56 eV. It is remarkable that the ΔLUMO and ΔHOMO offsets were 0.20 eV and 0.44 eV between P and ICz-Rd2, and 0.26 eV and 0.43 eV between P and ICz-RdCN2, respectively, which were all lower than the recommended threshold value of 0.3 eV for efficient photoinduced exciton dissociation in BHJ OSCs.42 Even though the energy level offset is small it may not limit the charge-separation properties because of efficient charge generation observed in some D/A systems with extremely low energy level offsets.41,55,56
The molecular geometries and electronic distribution in the FMO energy levels of the acceptors were investigated via performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Gaussian 09 suite employing the CAM-B3LYP functional and 6-311G(d,p) basis set (Fig. 4a). Considering the insignificant effect on the electronic properties, all the side chains were replaced with methyl groups. Geometry optimizations were carried out with full relaxation of all the atoms in the gas phase without a solvent effect. The UV-vis absorption profiles of ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 were calculated with their optimized geometries (Fig. 4b and Table S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the electron-density distributions in the HOMO energy levels were equally localized all over the molecule, while the electron-density distributions in the LUMO energy levels were highly localized on the electron-withdrawing groups. The planar fused ring backbones formed in NFA molecules by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units can help to elongate the effective conjugation length, facilitate the π-electron delocalization, reduce the energy band gap, and extend the light absorption.52 Co-planar geometries and rigid structures are helpful for lowering the re-organization energy and facilitating the π–π stacking of acceptor molecules, which will enhance the intrinsic charge carrier mobility and give ordered micro-phase domains.53 However, due to the high degree of co-planarity, materials tend to become insoluble and unprocessable. Hence, there is a trade-off between planarity and solubility. Therefore, while designing NFAs, an appropriate molecular design strategy is desired.54
2.3 Characteristics of photovoltaic devices
Both ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 exhibited complementary absorption spectra to the conjugated D–A polymer P. The polymer donor P was selected for OSC device fabrication because of the favourable energy offset as discussed above. To investigate the photovoltaic performances of ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 acceptors, BHJ OSCs with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P:ICz-Rd2 or ICz-RdCN2/PFN/Al were chosen. For comparison, OSC devices based on a P:PC71BM blend film were also fabricated under the same optimized conditions. The best performance photovoltaic characteristics of these devices are summarized in Table 2. Detailed information on the fabrication and optimization of devices, like the donor/acceptor ratio and the thickness of the active layer, are described in the ESI.† Optimized OSC devices with a blend ratio of 1:1 and an active layer thickness of 90 ± 5 nm gave the best performance for both P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 blend films. The optimized fabrication process was described in the ESI.† The current voltage (J–V) curve (Fig. 5a) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in (Fig. 5b) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The ICz-Rd2-based device without any post treatment gave an overall PCE of 4.90% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.63 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 39%. In contrast, an ICz-RdCN2-based device offered a PCE of 5.92% with a higher Voc of 1.04 V, Jsc of 13.24 mA cm−2, and an FF of 43%. To improve the photovoltaic performance of these devices, we enrolled a solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process of blend film before the deposition of a PFN layer. For the ICz-Rd2-based device after the chloroform SVA process, the PCE rose to 7.88%, together with an increasing Voc of 1.04 V, Jsc of 14.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 54%. P:ICz-RdCN2 film-based OSCs offered a PCE of 9.76% with a Voc of 1.01 V, Jsc of 15.58 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62% in SVA conditions. Compared to ICz-Rd2, ICz-RdCN2-based devices achieved a lower Voc but higher Jsc and FF. Due to the higher LUMO level, ICz-Rd2-based devices offered a higher Voc.57–61 Benefiting from the red-shifted absorption profile, the ICz-RdCN2-based OSC devices achieved a higher Jsc. We also studied the photovoltaic performance of the P:PC71BM-film-based device with SVA treatment. The SVA-treated P: PC71BM active layer showed an overall PCE of 5.89% (Jsc of 13.36 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V, and FF of 63%), which was much lower than that of OSCs based on ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 acceptors. The high PCE of these acceptors was mainly due to the higher values of Jsc and Voc related to the complementary strong absorption of the donor P and NFA acceptors and higher value of the LUMO energy level, respectively. The higher values of Jsc and Voc were closely related to the complementary strong absorption of the donor P and acceptor materials, which were responsible for the high PCEs of OSCs based on these acceptors.

 Fig. 5  (a) Current–voltage curves under illumination and (b) IPCE spectra of the OSC devices based on ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 acceptors processed under different optimized conditions. 
The corresponding IPCE spectra of P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 blend films with and without SVA treatment are exhibited in Fig. 5b. The IPCE spectra of the optimized OSCs exhibited a broader photoresponse covering the range of 350 to 920 nm, which originates from the complementary absorptions of both the donor and acceptor materials. The IPCE response at shorter wavelengths from 350–600 nm (650 nm for ICz-RdCN2) was mainly due to the acceptors, while that in the region of longer wavelengths corresponded to the polymer donor. The IPCE spectra of the OSCs closely resembled the absorption spectra of both components NFAs and P, indicating that both components in the active layer contributed to the photoinduced current generation. The IPCE intensity of P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 blend films increased via SVA treatment, indicting the enhanced photocurrent conversion efficiency of the devices. The OSC device based on ICz-RdCN2 reached a maximum value of 58.4% at 510 nm and covered a broader range compared to ICz-Rd2-based devices (62.3% at 542 nm), indicating the more efficient photocurrent conversion of the ICz-RdCN2-based device. It can be seen from Fig. 5b that the IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on ICz-Rd2 showed a dip around 630 nm, which disappears in the ICz-RdCN2 counterpart and may be one of the reasons for the high value of Jsc for ICz-RdCN2-based devices. The Jsc values measured from the integration of the IPCE spectra of the OSCs were about 11.54 mA cm−2 and 13.95 mA cm−2 for ICz-Rd2 and 13.16 mA cm−2 and 15.46 mA cm−2 for ICz-RdCN2 devices with and without SVA treatment, respectively, which are in good agreement with the values observed from the J–V characteristics of the devices. The higher values of Jsc after SVA treatment may be accredited to the more effective charge transfer in the BHJ active layer, which enhances the charge-carrier mobility.
To examine the photogenerated charge transfer in blend film, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat P, ICz-Rd2, ICz-RdCN2, and the blend film of donor P with ICz-Rd2 or ICz-RdCN2 were measured and are presented in Fig. 6. It can be easily observed that pristine P, ICz-Rd2, and ICz-RdCN2 showed a strong PL peaks at 862 nm, 672 nm, and 698 nm when excited at 760 nm, 582 nm, and 643 nm, respectively. The donor and acceptor blends showed significant fluorescence quenching, demonstrating that effective photoinduced charge transport occurs from the donor to acceptors (ICz-Rd2 or ICz-RdCN2) in the blend films in spite of the small LUMO offset.

Electron mobilities of the pristine ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 thin films were measured by fitting the dark current–voltage (J–V) parameters with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 7a).55 The electron mobility of ICz-RdCN2 (2.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that for ICz-Rd2 (1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results indicate that employing a stronger electron-withdrawing terminal units is an effective strategy not only for the broadening of the absorption profile but also for improving the intermolecular interactions and compact π–π stacking distance, thus enhancing the electron mobility for NAFs having an A–D–A configuration.

The higher values of Jsc and FF of ICz-RdCN2-based devices are responsible for its high PCE compared to the ICz-Rd2 counterpart. The values of Jsc and FF of OSCs are associated with the light-harvesting efficiency, exciton-generation efficiency, and charge-collection efficiency of the photoactive layer. The plots of photocurrent density (Jph, described as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and under dark conditions, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff, defined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage) for four devices based on ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2 (without SVA and with SVA conditions) were measured to investigate the exciton generation, dissociation, and charge-collection efficiency (Fig. 7(b)).62Veff determines the internal electric field in the blend film, which is responsible for the charge generation and charge collection in the OSCs. The OSC devices without SVA treatment could not come to saturation point even at the highest value of Veff, which designates that the low charge generation probability and charge collection is responsible for the low values of Jsc, FF, and PCE. However, in the case of SVA-treated ICz-Rd2- and ICz-RdCN2-based OSC devices, the onset values of Veff to saturate Jph were 0.68 V and 0.47 V, respectively, and completely saturated at the Veff of 1.38 V, suggesting that at a high value of Veff, all the excitons are generated after the absorption of light in the active layer and segregated into charge carriers and extracted by the corresponding electrodes. The low onset values of Veff for ICz-RdCN2-based device indicated that the low internal electric field was enough for charge generation compared to that for the ICz-Rd2 counterpart. At a high value of Veff, Jph is independent of Veff and the saturation photocurrent (Jphsat) is only limited by the light-harvesting efficiency of the active layer. The value of the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) could be estimated from the expression Gmax = Jphsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the blend film. The values of Gmax for SVA-treated OSCs were about 1.05 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.13 × 1028 m−3 s−1, for ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2, respectively, indicating the light-harvesting efficiency of the OSC based on ICz-RdCN2 was higher than that for the ICz-Rd2 counterpart. The exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll) efficiencies of ICz-Rd2- and ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs were calculated from the Jph/Jphsat relationship (where Jphsat is the saturation photocurrent density) at short circuit and maximum power point conditions, respectively. The values of Pdiss/Pcoll for the ICz-Rd2- and ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs were about 0.92/0.95 and 0.74/0.83, respectively. The improved values of both Pdiss and Pcoll for ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs may be another reason for the high values of Jsc and FF, leading to a higher value of PCE.
The other factor effecting the photovoltaic performance is the charge recombination behavior in OSC devices. To investigate the charge-recombination behavior, light intensity (P)-dependent photocurrent (Jsc) measurement were carried out in optimized P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 active-layers-based OSCs at different illumination intensities (Fig. 7c). The relationship between P and Jsc can be described by the power law equation Jsc ∝ Pγin,63 where, γ represents the power law exponent, which can be measured from the slope of the Jscvs. Pin plots. The value of γ (<1) was 0.932 for P:ICz-Rd2 and 0.969 for P:ICz-RdCN2 active-layers-based devices, indicating the presence of some bimolecular recombination. The higher value of γ for P:ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs indicates the lower bimolecular recombination than the ICz-Rd2 counterpart. This decreased γ value resulted in the higher Jsc and better performance of ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs.
One of the key drawbacks of using fullerene derivatives as an acceptor in OSCs is a large energy loss (Eloss). Eloss can be define as Eloss = Eg/q − Voc, where Eg is the optical band gap of the active materials, which is lower in the range of 0.7–1.0 eV. The Eloss of OSCs originates from the three parts, including the unavoidable large driving force for exciton dissociation (≈0.2–0.3 eV), and additional radiative and non-radiative recombination losses.58,59 We estimated the value of Eloss for our devices using the optical band gap for P (since it is smaller than that for NFAs). The values of Eloss for OSCs based on SVA-treated P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 blend films were 0.48 eV and 0.51 eV, respectively, which were quite a bit smaller than that of P:PC71BM (0.82 eV). As the ΔELUMO for both P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 was very low, about 0.20–0.26 eV, compared to P:PC71BM (0.54 eV), this reduces the radiative recombination loss, which may be attributed to the low value of Eloss.59,64
To investigate the molecular stacking of pristine NFA films, X-ray diffraction analysis was performed (Fig. 8). Both the NFAs showed the same (100) lamellar diffraction peak (2θ = 4.65) and different (010) π–π diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.96 and 23.52 for ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2, respectively. The (010) peak corresponding to ICz-RdCN2 was stronger than that of ICz-Rd2, indicating a more ordered packing. The π–π stacking distance of ICz-RdCN2 was estimated to be 0.38 nm, which was slightly lower than that for ICz-RdCN2 (0.398 nm). Therefore, ICz-RdCN2 exhibited more ordered and compact stacking as compared to ICz-Rd2, which is advantageous for facile charge transport in OSCs.

Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were employed to obtain information about the morphology of the active layers, with the TEM images of the optimized P:ICz-Rd2 and P:ICz-RdCN2 shown in Fig. 9. Both the active layers shown exhibited the rough feature with appropriate phase separation. The P:ICz-RdCN2 active layer showed slightly more phase separation than that for P:ICz-Rd2, resulting in greater exciton dissociation and charge-transfer efficiency, which is consistent with the values of Jsc and FF for the resulting PSCs.

3. Conclusions
Two new indolo-[3,2-b]-carbazole-based non-fullerene acceptors (ICz-Rd2 and ICz-RdCN2) were designed and synthesized for OSCs. These NFAs showed better planarity, good solubility, strong and broad absorption ranging from 350–800 nm, high molar extinction coefficients, and appropriate FMO energy levels matched with the donor materials. These molecules were employed as acceptors along with a conjugated polymer P as the donor having a strong absorption band in the wavelength region of 550 nm to 950 nm and a HOMO/LUMO energy level of about −5.15/−3.56 eV. After optimization of the active layer (i.e., 1:1 donor to acceptor weight ratio and SVA treatment), the ICz-Rd2- and ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs showed overall PCEs of 7.88% and 9.76% with energy losses of 0.51 eV and 0.48 eV, respectively. The PCE of OSCs based on these NFAs was higher and the voltage loss is lower than that of PC71BM-based counterparts. Moreover, the enhanced values of PCE for ICz-RdCN2-based OSCs as compared to the ICz-Rd2 counterpart, irrespective of the processing conditions, may be related to improved exciton dissociation, charge collection, and balanced charge transport in the P:ICz-RdCN2 active layer. We demonstrate that indolo-[3,2-b]-carbazole could be used as a central core to develop n-type semiconductor materials and the performance of acceptors could be improved via molecular modifications at the π-spacer and terminal acceptor units. The low cost and easy synthesis of ICZ-based NFAs make them potential alternatives to fullerene-based acceptors.
