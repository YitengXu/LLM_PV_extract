    , Accepted 11th April 2023First published on 12th April 2023AbstractImprovement of the photoconversion efficiency and operational stability under environmental conditions is a principal challenge confronted to move forward toward commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) devices the world over. Herein, enhancement of sunlight harvesting by increasing light scattering via embedding mesoporous TiO2 beads in a photoanode matrix and delaying electrolyte leakage using gel polymer electrolyte, regarded as two approaches to address this challenge, respectively. Photoanodes with various thicknesses and architectures of mesoporous TiO2 beads and nanoparticles are employed in the assembly of DSSC devices in the presence of gel polymer electrolyte. Optical and microstructural analysis showed submicron spherical beads with suitable monodispersity consisting of pure anatase TiO2 nanocrystals and very fine pores. Compared to TiO2 nanoparticles, such a 3D hierarchical structure showed a higher specific surface area (85 m2 g−1) and sunlight scattering (∼20%) but a lower amount of dye-sensitizer adsorption. The photovoltaic characteristics of the assembled devices with various architectures of photoanodes were recorded under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight. The highest photoconversion efficiency of 9.8% was achieved for the photoanode based on mesoporous TiO2 beads in the presence of gel polymer electrolyte, which was comparable to that in liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, it showed a longer operational stability under realistic ambient conditions.
1. Introduction
Global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels poses a serious threat which has consequences for the climate and human life. It is anticipated that fossil and mineral fuel reserves around the world will approach inevitable exhaustion in the coming 40 years for oil, 60 years for natural gas, and 200 years for coal.1 Under these critical circumstances, interest in solar cells as devices that could produce clean, low-cost and non-limited energy is increasing rapidly. The imitation of photosynthesis of chlorophyllin was a strategy that allowed O'Regan and Grätzel2 to make a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using much cheaper and more accessible materials than those used for other solar cells.
The photoanode of a DSSC is a mesoporous layer that should provide a suitable skeletal medium to anchor sensitizing dye molecules, penetrate electrolyte and transfer sunlight-generating electrons to the collector electrode. It is often made up of TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes of about 15–25 nm, in which the surface area and dye absorption capability are generally improved by decreasing the particle size. On the other hand, surface defects which act as electron traps will promote electron–hole recombination, leading to a decrease in photocurrent density of a nanoparticulate photoanode. Furthermore, the light scattering effect in nanosized particles is much smaller than that in submicron particles with diameters comparable to the wavelength of the incident sunlight.3 Thus, an ideal photoanode layer should highly absorb dye-sensitizer molecules and have enhanced light scattering properties, thereby special attention has been recently paid to developing DSSC devices.4–6 Mixing of fine and coarse particles, applying a bilayer structure consisting of an underlying light-absorbing fine layer and a coarse film as a light scattering layer on top, and the use of 3D hierarchical structures are three main architectural approaches to encourage its sunlight-scattering characteristics.7 In a mixed structure, large particles with sizes comparable to visible light wavelengths are introduced into the nanocrystalline film.8 The major problem with using this structure is the decrease of dye absorption of the photoanode layer. In the second approach, an extra internal resistance would be created in the inhomogeneous interface of fine/coarse structured layers that limits charge transfer and deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices. Meanwhile, 3D hierarchical structures in a photoanode could suitably represent both light scattering and dye-loading properties.9 Such a structure contains nanocrystalline aggregates which provide a high surface area; besides that, due to the comparable sizes of the hierarchical particles to the visible region, the light scattering effect is achieved in the photoanode. Mesoporous TiO2 beads as promising 3D hierarchical structures not only have exceptionally high surface areas and dye-loading properties but also are capable of scattering sunlight in the photoanode layer.10,11
The most popular electrolyte used in dye-sensitized solar cells is liquid electrolyte with a triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple. In spite of the good photovoltaic performance of this kind of electrolyte, it suffers from some limitations such as leakage and solvent evaporation, chemical decomposition, corrosion of the counter electrode, dye absorption, and ineffective sealing of these cells in long-term applications.12,13 Another accepted concept to improve the operational stability of DSSC devices is the replacement of this liquid electrolyte with quasi-solid-state or polymeric gel materials.14–18 These kinds of electrolytes are usually prepared by trapping liquid electrolyte containing mineral salts in a three-dimensional closed polymer chain. However, we may lose the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC devices with this replacement.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the contribution of mesoporous TiO2 beads in the photoanode of DSSC devices in the presence of gel polymer electrolyte. In this work, mesoporous TiO2 beads with submicron diameters were synthesized by a two-step sol–gel and solvothermal procedure. Photoanode layers with different architectures of TiO2 nanoparticles (as reference samples) and synthesized mesoporous TiO2 beads were prepared for the application of DSSC devices in the presence of gel polymer electrolyte. The photovoltaic metrics and operational performance stability of fabricated devices were recorded under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles
Full details of the synthesis procedure of TiO2 nanoparticles can be found in our previous work.19 Briefly, 4.43 ml titanium tetraisopropoxide as the titania precursor was poured into 21.54 mL of 1-octanol and stirred for 15 min. 2 ml of deionized water was then added dropwise to this solution and stirred vigorously for 30 min to complete the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Such a prepared sol was transferred into a PTFE Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave which was filled up to 70% and kept at 180 °C for 4 h to allow the solvothermal process to occur. Finally, the precipitated TiO2 nanopowders (N hereafter) were washed several times and dehydrated at ambient temperature.
2.2. Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 beads
Mesoporous TiO2 beads were synthesized via optimized conditions of combined sol–gel and solvothermal processes.20 The first transparent solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g hexadecyl amine (HDA) as a structure-directing agent in 25 ml of ethanol. After stirring for 30 min, 0.27 ml deionized water and 0.2 ml of an aqueous KCl solution (0.1 M) were added and magnetically stirred for 10 min. The second solution was prepared by dissolving 1.09 g TTIP as the titanium precursor in 25 ml of ethanol. The two solutions mentioned were combined under vigorous stirring conditions until a milky suspension was observed. The final solution was then kept in the lab atmosphere for 18 hours to allow all sediments to deposit and rinsed three times with ethanol. To obtain crystalline mesoporous TiO2 beads, a solvothermal process was carried out at 160 °C for 16 h in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel containing a mixture of 0.4 g of the above prepared powder, 18 ml ethanol and 9 ml deionized water. The final crystalline beads were formed after removing organic components with calcination at 500 °C for two hours (denoted as mesoporous TiO2 beads (B hereafter)).
2.3. Gel polymer electrolyte preparation
First, a liquid electrolyte containing a iodide/triiodide redox couple was prepared. The gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was then prepared by addition of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) as a gelator agent in a liquid electrolyte. 25 weight percent HPC was employed in the GPE to attain the highest ionic conductivity of 17.8 mS cm−1 and a viscosity of 350 cP, optimized in our previous work.21 Practically, HPC powder was added slowly to the liquid electrolyte under stirring and left in the lab atmosphere for 15 h. A homogenous gel polymer electrolyte was finally obtained by heating the electrolyte for 4 h at 60 °C.
2.4. Photoanode and counter electrode preparation
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were carefully washed with ethanol and acetone. A compact TiO2 blocking layer was applied via TiCl4 treatment in a 40 mM aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. The titania-coated substrates were dried at 60 °C and finally heat treated at 450 °C for 30 min. Mesoscopic TiO2 layers with different thicknesses were spin-coated using a homemade TiO2 paste,22 containing different weight ratios of N and B particles, as given in Table 1.

After drying at 60 °C for 10 min, the samples were heated at 400 °C for 2 hours in order to eliminate the organic additives from the mesoscopic scaffold. A secondary TiCl4 post-treatment was carried out in a 20 mM aqueous solution with the above-mentioned procedure to enlarge sites for dye absorption. The mesoporous photoanode films were soaked in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of ruthenium(II) dye (Ruthenium 535-bis TBA dye, N719) and kept there for 18 h. After complete dye uptake, the dye-loaded electrodes were washed with ethanol and dried at ambient temperature, and then stored in a dark box.
The counter electrode of the DSSC devices was made by drop-coating a 0.02 mol L−1 chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate solution in isopropanol on a clean FTO substrate carrying a small hole. The platinum-coated substrate was cured at 500 °C for 30 min.
2.5. DSSC device assembling
The Pt-coated counter electrode was pressed to the photoanode and kept at 120 °C for 5 min in order to melt the thin thermoplastic frame (Surlyn) and achieve proper sealing. Immediately, liquid or gel polymer electrolytes were injected using a vacuum pump through the small hole located on the counter electrode to completely fill the Surlyn-created gap between the counter electrode and photoanode. In this research, we applied two different approaches to investigate the photovoltaic performance of mesoporous TiO2 beads as 3D hierarchical photoanodes in DSSC devices. First, we applied liquid and gel polymer electrolytes into the devices with a double-layer photoanode of TiO2 beads. Second, in the same electrolyte, we used various architectures of TiO2 mesoporous beads in the photoanode layer (as shown schematically in Table 1).
2.6. Measurements and characterization
The structural properties of the photoelectrode were studied using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips PW1730 model; Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). In addition, the morphology and microstructure of the synthesized powders and constructed photoanodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN-MIRA3). The specific surface area, porosity, and pore volume were measured using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 analyzer (Micromeritics, Aachen, Germany) with nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms, applying Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equations at 77.35 K. The degassing process of the as-prepared nanopowders was conducted at 120 °C for 20 h. The scattering properties and bandgap were determined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, AvaSpec-2048-TEC). The dye absorption of the photoelectrode was spectroscopically determined using UV-vis spectroscopy (Jenway 6705). N719-dye molecules were allowed to desorb from the sensitized photoanodes into an aqueous NaOH solution (0.1 M) and then analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy and compared with respect to the macroscopic geometric area of the electrodes. Photovoltaic measurements were carried out under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm2) using a “Zahner CIMPS pcs” solar simulator with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. S1,† XRD analysis of the products obtained from the first step, the sol–gel process, revealed that the TiO2 mesoporous beads had an amorphous structure before solvothermal treatment. In other words, the amorphous beads transformed into a crystalline phase of TiO2 due to the elevated temperature and pressure during the solvothermal procedure. The XRD patterns of the reference TiO2 nanoparticles and solvothermally treated mesoporous TiO2 beads are shown in Fig. 1.

It reveals that well-defined crystalline phases of TiO2 with narrow and strong diffraction peaks appeared in all three samples. The peaks appeared at 2θ values of approximately 25.5°, 38°, 48°, 54°, 55°, 63°, 69°, 70.5° and 75.5°, nominated to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 0 4), (1 1 6), (2 2 0) and (2 1 5) crystal planes, which correspond to reflections from the tetragonal crystalline lattice of the TiO2 anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272). Compared to the reference pattern, the diffraction peaks of the TiO2 beads were slightly broadened and shifted. The widening of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the strongest peak at (1 0 1) planes could be a sign of smaller crystallite sizes for the TiO2 beads. The average crystallite sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 beads were calculated to be around 12 and 7 nm, respectively, using the Scherrer equation.23
The slight shift of diffraction peaks to higher angles for the pre-heated TiO2 beads may be related to the thermal stress they experienced during the calcination process at 500 °C for two hours. Moreover, the XRD patterns imply that during the calcination process of the TiO2 beads, the crystalline phase of anatase did not change and organic components were only eliminated. However, the higher intensity and greater narrowing of diffraction peaks in the heat treated TiO2 beads indicate a higher degree of crystalline perfection and growth of anatase crystals.
As shown in Fig. 2, the FESEM images of the TiO2 beads indicate that these structures contained monodisperse beads before and after the solvothermal process. The mean diameter of these beads is approximately 522 nm (as shown in the histograms in Fig. S2†), which is much larger than that of TiO2 nanoparticles as the commonly employed morphology in DSSC applications (Fig. S3†). Thus, we expect an increase in scattering of incident sunlight and more effective light sweeping in the photoanode caused by these mesoporous TiO2 beads due to their comparable size to the wavelength of visible light. Fig. 2(a and b) show that the synthesized beads exhibit a dense structure before the solvothermal process, having extra smooth surfaces without any porosity and granular features. Such a dense spherical morphology would be obtained from the formation of hybrid micelles resulting from the dense liquid phase rich in HDA and titanium oligomers.24 In fact, the Ti[OCH(CH3)]4−x(OH)x species that were formed by the hydrolysis of the TTIP as the titanium precursor will interact with amine groups of HDA via hydrogen bonds, resulting in a hybrid composite with a hydrophobic end due to the presence of long-chain alkyl groups. As the population of Ti oligomers becomes larger, the newly created hybrid micelles become denser over time, leading to the formation of dense TiO2 beads with smooth surfaces. Fig. 2(c and d) show that some fine granular features appeared in the solvothermally treated TiO2 beads, leading to the formation of mesoporous structures with comparatively rough surfaces. Previous studies on the solvothermal details of TiO2 mesoporous beads have demonstrated that amorphous beads transform into the anatase crystalline phase due to the elevated temperature and pressure during this process.25 Such a transition from amorphous to crystalline growth along with elimination of organic components not only results in the formation of fine nanocrystals and a mesoporous structure but also in the production of a rough texture on the surface of TiO2 beads. Moreover, a shrinkage of about 20% occurred in the bead diameter during the solvothermal process, as shown in the insets of Fig. 2b and d. TiO2 beads with an average diameter of 571 nm were synthesized by a sol–gel process and their diameter decreased down to 448 nm after a solvothermal process.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms along with the corresponding pore size distribution plots for the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (N) as reference samples and mesoporous TiO2 beads (B) before and after solvothermal (ST) treatment are presented in Fig. 3. The sorption metrics of the samples extracted from this figure are also summarized in Table 2. The TiO2 beads exhibit a unique isotherm and an incredibly low SBET value of 8.96 m2 g−1 before the solvothermal process. This manner reflects the presence of a dense structure without any capillary condensation of N2 gas within the fine mesopores, which is in agreement with the FESEM images in Fig. 2(a and b), showing an extra smooth surface for such beads.

TiO2 nanoparticles and solvothermally treated mesoporous beads have resulted in type IV isotherms, according to the IUPAC classification.26 This type of isotherm indicates that under relative low pressures, only a monolayer of adsorbed gas forms, but as the relative pressure goes higher than 0.7, N2 gas condenses up to saturation pressure in the tiny capillary pores of mesoporous structures. The TiO2 beads after the solvothermal process exhibited a greater volume of adsorbed N2 than before saturation, associated with a higher SBET value of 85.00 m2 g−1, in comparison with the reference TiO2 nanoparticles with SBET = 64.37 m2 g−1. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the corresponding pore size distribution plots. The synthesized TiO2 beads before the solvothermal process exhibited an essentially flat chart in size-direction without any gas volume adsorbed, suggesting a pore-free microstructure. However, the pore size distribution plots of the TiO2 nanoparticles and solvothermally treated beads demonstrate a wide range of mesopores with a maximum peak (rp, peak), as shown in Table 2. Mesoporous TiO2 beads display a wider pore size distribution and the related maximum peak appeared at a larger pore diameter. Such a porous characteristic promotes a suitable skeletal medium to penetrate the GPE and sensitizing dye molecules in the photoanodes of DSSCs made up of these TiO2 beads.
It is noteworthy that ammonia has been proposed previously as a promising candidate for use in the solvothermal process of mesoporous anatase beads to valorize the rapid growth of TiO2 crystals, producing elongated crystals with enlarged pores. This is an important factor in the photoanode of a DSSC device which could strongly affect the penetration of electrolyte, especially when GPE is used. Here, in order to investigate the above-mentioned protocol, we applied an ammonia solution (25% in water) in the solvothermal procedure by 7.3% and 14.6% volume fraction of the Teflon vessel. The influence of ammonia content on the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of mesoporous TiO2 beads is shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1.† It is obvious that by increasing the ammonia content in the solvothermal procedure, the pore size of mesoporous TiO2 beads increases from 19.05 to 21.04 nm, leading to a decrease in specific surface areas by 15%.
In order to evaluate the sunlight scattering properties of different photoanode electrodes, their diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) results are compared with those of TiO2 nanoparticles in Fig. 4. As expected, the mesoporous TiO2 beads exhibited the highest sunlight scattering properties. This beneficial scattering effect can be attributed to the unique spherical shape and large size of mono-dispersed mesoporous TiO2 beads (as shown in Fig. 2). In a DSSC device, light scattering in the photoanode is expected to improve the incident sunlight absorption because of the enlargement of the pathways of photons in the mesoporous film and optical confinement.27 These promising characteristics of mesoporous TiO2 beads stress their large potential to improve the performance of DSSC devices when used in photoanode construction. It is evident that NB15 and B/N electrodes show intermediate scattering properties between those of TiO2 nanoparticles and beads. However, the NB15 film has higher scattering than the B/N film due to a synergetic effect between nanoparticles and beads.

Fig. 5 shows the top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of double layer photoanodes made of TiO2 nanoparticles and mesoporous TiO2 beads with various architectures employed in the DSSC devices, schematically illustrated in Table 1. Comparison of the average size and spherical shape of TiO2 beads applied on the photoanode with those of the pristine powders (Fig. 2) indicates that fortunately the preparation procedure of our homemade paste and its post-heating had no influence on the configuration of the beads. As shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 5, the top view images of the photoanodes suggest the good texture uniformity of deposited continuous layers on the substrates, revealing submicron mesoporous beads. It should be noted that the nanoporous structures observed on the surface of the photoanodes are due to the elimination of organic additives from the paste during the annealing process.

Such a mesoporous scaffold would be desirable to increase the surface area and dye absorption of the photoanode layer. As shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 5, the cross-sectional images of the photoanodes indicate that thickness uniformity was obtained in all cases in spite of the very simple spin-coating method used. For each choice of architecture of TiO2 particles, the film thickness is an important parameter which should be considered for each type of DSSC because it can strongly impact on the concentration of adsorbed dye molecules and the photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated final devices.
To understand how the architecture of the photoanode layer may influence the dye-sensitizer adsorption, the UV-vis absorption spectra of N719-dye desorbed solutions from different photoanode electrodes were spectroscopically compared (Fig. 6 and S5†). Thus, N719-dye-loaded photoanodes were washed in ethanol to remove the physically harbored dye molecules and then they were immersed in a 0.1 M aqueous solution of NaOH to forcedly exude the chemically bonded dyes. The resulting, reddish-stained solution was used for UV-vis absorption spectroscopic recording, peaking at wavelengths of 230.9, 244.8, 306.5, 372.3 and 497.2 nm. The first three peaks that belong to the ultra-violet region were assigned to ligand-centered charge-transfer transitions, and the next two peaks that belong to the visible region were attributed to metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions.28 As shown in Table 2, since the powder of mesoporous TiO2 beads exhibited the largest SBET, it could be expected to provide the highest N719-dye-loading on the related photoanode. However, as shown in Fig. 6, the electrode that consisted of TiO2 nanoparticles exuded the highest dye-desorption into NaOH aqueous solution. If we compare the cross-sectional views of these two electrodes from the SEM graphs (shown in Fig. 5(b and d)), we can observe that the control photoanode based on nanoparticles has a higher film thickness of 16 μm, in comparison with the TiO2 bead electrode with a thickness of approximately 12 μm, resulting in higher levels of dye-loading. It is also noteworthy that sensitizing N719-dye molecules have certainly different interactions with the surface (1 0 1) sites of anatase TiO2 located on the nanoparticle and mesoporous bead morphologies. For the purpose of having both dye-adsorption and light scattering effects, mixed-photoanodes containing different weight percentages of nanoparticles and mesoporous TiO2 beads were also considered. As shown in Fig. S5,† the density of N719-dye-uptake on the mixed-photoanodes increases with increasing mesoporous bead contents up to 15 wt% (NB15) and then decreases. Such an improved dye-loading might be due to the enlarged pores on the bimodal texture of the mixed-photoanode which consisted of coarse TiO2 beads and fine nanoparticles (as shown in Fig. 5e). When we used the TiO2 nanoparticles as the underlying active layer and the mesoporous beads as the scattering layer on top (B/N sample), the amount of N719-dye adsorption dramatically decreased. It seems that the dye-loading of this photoanode is mainly controlled by TiO2 beads located on the film surface and weakly affected by nanoparticles.

The photovoltaic behaviors of double layer photoanodes with various architectures of mesoporous TiO2 beads and nanoparticles employed in the DSSC device assembly in the presence of GPE were investigated, and the resulting metrics are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3. It is clear that film thickness has a strong impact on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices.

It can tailor the light scattering, light diffusion length, series and shunt resistances, localized trap levels, electron–hole recombination and adsorbed-dye concentration of photoanodes. The photovoltaic metrics of the fabricated devices indicate that as the film thickness increases, the VOC (open-circuit voltage) and fill factor (FF) of the DSSC decreases. It seems that by increasing the photoanode thickness in a certain architecture, the specific surface area increases, leading to the enhancement of the trap levels and electron–hole recombination rate. Hence, back electron transferring of injected electrons from the photoanode occurs more rapidly, causing the loss of VOC.29 Furthermore, the increased thickness of the photoanode leads to promotion of the internal series resistance of the device, lowering the fill factor. However, in some architectures, the measured characteristics under illumination have apparently deviated from the rules mentioned, which might be due to interference of other factors such as elevated scattering of incident sunlight.30 It is well-known that the resulting JSC (short-circuit current density) in a DSSC is mainly controlled by light scattering, the electron–hole recombination rate and levels of the loaded dye-sensitizer as the photon capturing antenna from sunlight. In our case, as the film thickness increases, the specific surface area and dye-loading of the photoanode improved, suggesting an enhancement in JSC. On the other hand, increasing the film thickness beyond a certain threshold leads the electron–hole recombination losses to dominate and the JSC produced to fall. Moreover, keeping in mind that electrons have a constant mean free path in an electronic device, when the photoanode layer is too thick, less population of charge carriers has a chance to touch the counter electrode, resulting in lower values of JSC. It is noteworthy that in a mesoporous film too thick, GPE does not allow for efficient penetration throughout the photoanode layer and formation of an interpenetrating GPE/TiO2 network, limiting the resulting JSC and photovoltaic performance of the DSSC device. The trade-off between the factors mentioned is a fundamental controversy of DSSCs that determines the JSC and photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. Optimum thicknesses of 16.3, 13.4, 15.6 and 9 + 8.9 μm were achieved for N, B, mixed N&B and Bscattering/Nactive architectures, producing PCE values of 7, 9.8, 7.8 and 6.3%, respectively, under simulated AM 1.5 illumination. As shown in Fig. 7(a and b), comparison of N and B photoanodes indicates that employing mesoporous TiO2 beads could cause an increase in the JSC value and FF of a DSSC device and a decrease in VOC. Here, the N719-dye absorption spectroscopic records (shown in Fig. 6) exhibit a lower value of dye-loading for the B photoanode than the pristine N one. Hence, we can declare that the higher JSC obtained may be dictated by higher scattering of incident sunlight in mesoporous TiO2 beads (as shown in Fig. 4) and more effective light sweeping. Furthermore, since the porosity characterization of N and B samples (shown in Fig. 3) demonstrated a wider pore size distribution and a larger pore diameter for mesoporous TiO2 beads than those for nanoparticles, the B photoanode can provide a more suitable skeletal medium to penetrate the GPE and produce a higher photocurrent density. Among the investigated TiO2 architectures, the highest values of JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2 and PCE of 9.8% (VOC of 0.67 V and FF of 0.74) were achieved in the DSSC device containing a 13.4 μm thick photoanode made up of pure mesoporous TiO2 beads in the presence of GPE. It is interesting here to compare the photovoltaic characteristics of this device with those of the device in the presence of liquid electrolyte (shown in Fig. S6 and Table S2†). By replacing the liquid electrolyte with GPE, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices did not get any worse but just got better. This might be due to the high ionic conductivities obtained for this kind of GPE based on an I3−/I− redox couple and also the deeper penetration of electrolyte inside the pores. Fig. 7(c) shows the beneficial effect of mesoporous TiO2 beads with large sizes embedded in a nanoparticulate matrix on the performance of the photoanode of DSSCs in the presence of GPE. We can observe that the JSC and VOC parameters exhibit the same trend as a function of TiO2 bead incorporation, increasing up to 15 wt% and then decreasing. It seems that there is a trade-off between incident sunlight scattering and dye loading in a photoanode. As the TiO2 bead content was increased, the sunlight scattering increased and prolongs the presence of photons in the photoanode layer, leading to improvement in the resulting JSC, peaking at 15 wt% content. At a higher TiO2 bead content, the dye loading decreased (as shown in Fig. 6) and JSC decreased. Meanwhile, the highest values of JSC (16.5 mA cm−2) and PCE (7.8%) were obtained in the NB15 device, although it showed the lowest FF. This can be explained by the internal resistance of the cells being the most effective parameter for the fill factor. The optimum porosity and surface area of the photoelectrodes were achieved at a specific weight percentage of TiO2 beads, improving electrolyte diffusion into the film, decreasing the internal resistance and eventually the FF.
As expected, the open circuit voltages of all the fabricated DSSCs were almost the same, being in the range 0.62–0.70 V. This can be explained by the fact that the differences between the Fermi levels of TiO2 and the redox potentials of the electrolyte are the same.

Fig. 7d shows the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices based on B/N photoanodes in which the scattering layers of mesoporous TiO2 beads with various thicknesses have been applied on the underlying photoactive layer of TiO2 nanoparticles with a constant thickness of about 10 μm. The photovoltaic performance of these DSSCs based on B/N photoanodes is poorer than those of other architectures. A dramatic decrease in N719-dye adsorption (as shown in Fig. 6) and an inhomogeneous nanoparticle/bead interface with extra charge resistance are two main problems that correspond to the deteriorative performance of related DSSC devices. In this case, the highest values of JSC (13.6 mA cm−2) and PCE (6.3%) were achieved in the B/N photoanode with an 8.9 μm-thick scattering layer on top.
Nyquist plots of the devices, the equivalent circuit employed to fit the electrochemical impedance curves and the resultant parameters are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4, respectively. Basically, the high-frequency semicircle is related to electrochemical reaction of the Pt counter electrode and the electron transfer resistance at the electrolyte/Pt interface, whereas the middle-frequency semicircle is attributed to electron transport and transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The resistance of the electrolyte is related to the low-frequency semicircle.31 For all devices, the obtained RS resistance from the first real intercept on the Nyquist plot, which is ascribed to the sheet resistance of FTO and the contact resistance between FTO and TiO2, is almost the same since the same FTO substrates were used to fabricate the DSCs.

Two semicircles including a small one at a high frequency and a large semicircle at a low frequency were observed in the Nyquist plots. The large semicircle is assigned to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and attributed to parallel association of the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/TiO2 interface with a constant phase element (CPEct). The small semicircle is related to the parallel connection of the interfacial capacitance (CPEPt) at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the charge transfer resistance (RPt). It should be noted that in the fitting method Cμ (electron chemical capacitance) is replaced by the CPE because of the non-ideal capacitive response of the TiO2/solution interface, whereas Cμ is an equilibrium property. Comparison of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values revealed an increase in the order TiO2 beads (38.8 Ω) < NB15 (46.8 Ω) < TiO2 nanoparticles (73.0 Ω) < B/N (119.2 Ω) while their (CPE2) or (Cμ) values are in a reverse order as follows: TiO2 beads (2.8 mF) > NB15 (2.0 mF) > TiO2 nanoparticles (1.9 mF) > BN (1.8 mF). It can be observed that the DSSC made of TiO2 beads showed the lowest Rct (the smallest arc) amongst all devices, implying more efficient electron transfer. Therefore, TiO2 beads containing ultra-fine particles may reduce the imperfect binding sites at the active layer/scattering layer interface with the active layer. Furthermore, TiO2 nanoparticles have poor connection due to their smooth surface and addition of TiO2 beads to the nanoparticles may improve the particle connections and retard charge recombination in the electrode (compare NB15 and B/N). We also found that the B/N solar cell had the largest arc, indicating the greatest transfer resistance. Not only poor connection of TiO2 nanoparticles may increase the charge transfer resistance but also their poor connection with the FTO substrate may result in direct contact between FTO and electrolyte (i.e., reaction between photogenerated electrons and tri-iodide species) and eventually may hinder electron transport. Since the nanoparticles are located between TiO2 beads they can improve connection of particles and connection of the deposited film with FTO, enhancing the NB15 performance in comparison with B/N.
A comparison of the photovoltaic parameters of the assembled DSSC devices based on liquid and GPEs recorded during an ageing test and the normalized metrics is shown in Fig. 9. The devices were kept in a dark box under ambient conditions and the photovoltaic performance was measured at various time intervals. It is clear from these plots that the operational stability of different DSSC devices under simulated sunlight is mainly controlled by the electrolyte type, liquid or gel polymer, and weakly affected by the photoanode architectures. Between the two electrolytes, the values of the parameters JSC and PCE for liquid-based DSSC devices decreased sharply after a few hours of initial operation of the device due to electrolyte leakage and degradation. Its performance neared to dead point, with less than 10% of its initial PCE, after only 200 hours of device operation. Meanwhile, the GPE carrying DSSC devices with various architectures of photoanodes were less affected, suggesting that HPC as a gelator could significantly retard the leakage and destruction of the liquid electrolyte. In the period of test time mentioned, the GPE-based device with mesoporous TiO2 beads in the photoanode texture could retain about 50% of the initial JSC and PCE metrics.

There was not a spatial variation of VOC and FF parameters during the time test for all the constructed devices. Comparing the performance of the N photoanodes with that of 3D hierarchical photoanodes containing mesoporous TiO2 beads, it is observed that the JSC and PCE values of the control device with a TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode were affected more rapidly by passing of aging time. It seems that volatile organic components of the electrolyte were trapped in mesoporous TiO2 beads and could more effectively prevent the escape of electrolyte components from the DSSC device.
4. Conclusions
In this work, mesoporous TiO2 beads with submicron diameters were synthesized by a two-step sol–gel and solvothermal procedure. Some double layer photoanodes with various architectures of synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (as reference samples) and mesoporous TiO2 beads were prepared for the application of DSSC devices in the presence of liquid and gel polymer electrolytes. The structural and optical characterization of mesoporous TiO2 beads suggested the formation of large spherical beads with a crystalline pure anatase phase which could provide higher specific surface areas and sunlight-scattering properties but lower levels of N719-dye loading, when compared with those of TiO2 nanoparticles. The photovoltaic metrics of the fabricated DSSC devices were improved by incorporating the mesoporous TiO2 beads, thanks to higher densities of short-circuit current and fill factor. Among all the fabricated DSSC devices, the photoanode based on pure mesoporous TiO2 beads exhibited the highest PCE value of 9.8%, which was approximately 40% higher than that of the control device with TiO2 nanoparticles. By replacing the liquid electrolyte with GPE in this device, it did not lose photovoltaic performance and exhibited higher operational stability under realistic outdoor conditions.
