    , Accepted 13th March 2009First published on 23rd March 2009AbstractMolecular bulk heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 1.70% have been fabricated using as donor BODIPY dyes with complementary light-harvesting properties.
Donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are a focus of increasing interest motivated by the possibility to realize large area, light-weight, and flexible energy sources.1 A major advantage of BHJ solar cells lies in the simplicity of fabrication by means of cost-effective and low environmental impact technologies. The most efficient BHJ solar cells reported to date with conversion efficiencies of ∼5% are based on [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)2 as acceptor and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT as donor.3 Despite their conceptual simplicity, the fabrication of these BHJ solar cells is rather delicate and requires some specific procedures such as processing from solutions of high-boiling point and toxic solvents, post-fabrication thermal treatment or use of additives that make device fabrication rather tricky.1,3
On the other hand, due to the limitations imposed by the insufficient absorption of the solar spectrum by P3HT, progress in conversion efficiency requires the synthesis of new donor materials specifically designed for organic solar cells.4 An intensively investigated route involves the synthesis of low band gap polymers in order to extend the absorption towards longer wavelengths.5 However, band gap engineering in the context of organic solar cells is not trivial since a red shift of the main absorption band can often lead to the opening of a window in the visible spectral region as well as to a reduction of the open circuit voltage.5,6 A possible solution to this problem consists of the broadening of the absorption band of conjugated polymers by attachment of conjugated side chains.7
Recent years have seen the emergence of a new approach based on the use of soluble small conjugated molecules as donors in BHJ solar cells.8–10 In fact, molecular donors present some specific advantages in terms of structural definition, charge-carrier mobility and reproducibility of synthesis and purification.
Derivatives of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) form an important class of dyes which are subjects of considerable interest owing to a unique combination of facile synthesis, stability, high absorption coefficients and high photoluminescence efficiencies.10 We have shown recently that donors based on extensively conjugated BODIPY derivatives can lead to molecular BHJ with some of the highest conversion efficiencies reported to date for this type of organic solar cell.11
A particularly interesting feature of BODIPY concerns the multiple possibilities of substitution of the structure that should allow the tuning of the various relevant parameters for solar cells such as absorption spectral range, open-circuit voltage or hole-transport properties with much less interdependence than in conjugated polymers.10 On such a basis, it should be possible to realize BHJ solar cells using mixtures of homologous dyes absorbing different parts of the solar spectrum but with small differences in the energy levels of their frontier orbitals.
We show here for the first time that a combination of dyes with complementary absorption properties leads to synergistic effects that produce a large extension of the photoresponse of molecular BHJ cells and thus a significant increase of the power conversion efficiency. We note that previous attempts to extend the photoresponse of polymer organic solar cells by doping with dye molecules have been reported but met with limited success.12
The synthesis and characterization of compounds 1 and 2 (Chart 1) have been already reported.11 Both compounds exhibit high molecular extinction coefficients (>105 M−1 cm−1) and high photoluminescence quantum yields.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of thin films spin-cast on glass from chloroform solutions show a first band with a maximum in the 350–370 nm region followed by a main absorption band with λmax at 590 and 675 nm for compounds 1 and 2 respectively (Fig. 1). The absorption onset leads to estimated values of the band gap (Eg) of 1.95 and 1.70 eV for 1 and 2 respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the absorption spectra of two dyes are clearly complementary and their addition can be expected to improve the light-harvesting properties of the resulting solar cells.

Fig. 2 shows the relative positions of the energy levels of dyes 1 and 2 and of the various components of the resulting BHJ solar cell. The HOMO and LUMO levels (−5.69 and −3.66 eV for dye 1 and −5.56 and −3.75 eV for dye 2) suggest that both compounds can give rise to photo-induced charge transfer to PCBM.

        BHJ solar cells have been realized by spin-coating chloroform containing dyes 1, 2 and PCBM in 1:1:2 weight ratio solutions (total concentration 12 mg ml−1). Fig. 3 shows the typical incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum recorded under monochromatic irradiation.

Comparison of Fig. 3 with Fig. 1 clearly shows that the IPCE spectrum is indeed the sum of the individual contributions of donor dyes 1 and 2. A first peak of 25% is observed around 450 nm which can be attributed to the contribution of PCBM and of the first absorption band of the dyes. A maximum of 37% is observed at ca 580 nm corresponding to dye 1, followed by a third peak of 32% around 675 nm corresponding to dye 2.

Fig. 4 shows the current density (J) vs voltage (V) characteristics of a cell based on 1 and 2 and PCBM. Clear rectification behaviour is observed in the dark. Under simulated solar illumination with an incident power light of 100 mW cm−2, the device delivers a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.70 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.866 V. Combined with a filling factor FF of 42% these results lead to a power conversion efficiency of 1.70%. Comparison of these results to those of the BHJ cells based on the individual dyes 1 and 211 shows that in addition to higher Jsc and conversion efficiency expected from the extended IPCE spectrum, the multi-donor cell shows a 70 mV larger Voc value than the cells based on dye 1 with the lowest HOMO level (0.796 V).11 Although we have no definitive explanation for the origin of this synergistic effect, it is worth noting that we have already reported large and unexpected differences of Voc for series of donors of the same family with similar HOMO levels but that lead to drastically different Jsc values.13

To summarize we have shown that the association of donors with appropriate energy levels and complementary light-harvesting properties can produce a significant improvement of the conversion efficiency of molecular BHJ solar cells. Together with recent results on merocyanine dyes,9e our results represent the highest power conversion efficiency reported so far for BHJ solar cells based on small molecules.
It is clear that these preliminary results raise many questions regarding the optimization of the devices i.e. respective ratios of dyes and acceptor, eventual use of more than two dyesetc. as well as fundamental problems related to the relative differences in the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of the various components and to the effects of multiple donors on the elemental processes of exciton diffusion, charge separation, transport and collection. Although the elucidation of these various complex questions will require further detailed investigations, the first evidence of the effectiveness of cooperative effects in multi-donor molecular BHJ solar cells reported in this preliminary communication already open exciting perspectives for future research.
