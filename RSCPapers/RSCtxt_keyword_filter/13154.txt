    , Accepted 24th June 2021First published on 25th June 2021AbstractCuSCN has been considered as one of the most promising inorganic hole transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, damaging effects during the deposition of CuSCN and interfacial degradation are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells. In this work, we demonstrated that a new method based on interfacial engineering could overcome the issues mentioned above effectively. With the introduction of an ultrathin PMMA layer between the interface of CH3NH3PbI3 and CuSCN, the corresponding perovskite solar cells exhibited enhanced power conversion efficiency and thermal stability, which mainly benefited from the reduction of trap density of perovskite thin films by PMMA and the prevention from the degradation reaction between CH3NH3PbI3 and CuSCN. As a result, the present interfacial engineering method realized an enhanced efficiency over 19%, and superior device stability with 90% retainment of the efficiency after aging at 85 °C for 96 h.
1. Introduction
Owing to unprecedented advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low processing cost, organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently gained tremendous interests.1–3 The great enhancement of device efficiency recorded from an initial 3.8% to recently certified 25.5%,4,5 thanks to the fascinating optical and electrical properties of perovskites, involves low excitation binding energy, high charge carrier mobility, large optical absorption coefficient and long excitation diffusion length.6–9 To achieve efficient hole transportation and extraction, hole transporting materials have been demonstrated to be crucial for high efficiency perovskite solar cells.10–12 For instance, organic hole transport materials (HTMs), such as spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene) and PTAA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl)]amine), have been developed and investigated intensively in perovskite solar cells, which yielded the highest efficiency so far.13,14 However, the high cost and unsatisfactory thermal stability limit their commercial worth in PSCs.15,16
As alternative candidates, inorganic hole transporting materials have received increasing attention due to their advantages such as low cost, high hole mobility and thermal durability.17–23 Inorganic HTMs that can be deposited via low temperature processes are preferred.24–27 Among them, CuSCN has been demonstrated to be one of the most promising inorganic candidates due to its outstanding thermal stability, higher mobility of 10−2–10−1 cm2 V−1 S−1, and matched HOMO energy level for PSCs.28–30 Generally, alkyl sulfides (dipropyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide) were frequently used as solvents for CuSCN thin film deposition.31–34 However, the solution of CuSCN in alkyl sulfides would damage the perovskite layer during the casting process, which induced certain defect sites between the interface of MAPbI3/CuSCN.35–37 The resulting aggravated charge recombination was detrimental to the photovoltaic performance.38,39 In addition, an interface degradation issue was also reported, particularly at elevated temperatures, which led to a decline in long-term stability.40 So far, significant research interest has been devoted to addressing such issues for the development of CuSCN-based PSCs.41–45
Interfacial engineering of CuSCN-based PSCs has been investigated intensively and demonstrated to be a valid strategy for improving device performance.46–55 For instance, Park et al. introduced an ultrathin 2D perovskite layer between the interface of MAPbI3/CuSCN to passivate defects effectively, and achieved a significant enhancement of PCE as well as device stability.46 A remarkable improvement of the VOC for the CuSCN-based PSCs was achieved by depositing various functional molecules onto the perovskite layer, as a result of effectively mitigating the interfacial defects.47 The interfacial modification via insertion of NiOx thin film prevented MAPbI3 from being damaged by DES (diethyl sulfide) solvent, resulting in thermally stable PSCs.48 Moreover, the incorporation of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) between the perovskite layer and CuSCN layer improved the PCE and moisture durability of CuSCN-based PSCs by preventing the degradation of light harvesting layer.49 A two-dimensional perovskite (PDA)2PbI4 was introduced between the perovskite layer and CuSCN layer to enhance the PCE and moisture stability of CuSCN-based PSCs through removing the defects on the surface of perovskite film.50 In addition, CuSCN-based PSCs with double-layer HTMs, such as PTAA/CuSCN, P3HT/CuSCN, Cu2O/CuSCN, CuGaO2/CuSCN and spiro-MeOTAD/CuSCN, displayed enhanced photovoltaic performance and ambient stability.51–55 Liu et al. introduced PMMA into CuSCN-based PSCs by depositing PMMA film onto Au electrode as encapsulating material to improve thermal stability by preventing the volatilization of MASCN, whereas it seems that the degradation reaction between CuSCN and CH3NH3PbI3 was still not retarded completely.40
In this work, we introduced an ultrathin insulating polymer PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) between the interface of the perovskite layer and CuSCN hole transporting layer, which was demonstrated to act as a multifunctional component in the devices. Firstly, the compact PMMA thin film could prevent the perovskite from being damaged by the alkyl sulfides during the solution process deposition of CuSCN. Secondly, the defect-sites located at the interface between perovskite/CuSCN can be reduced, probably due to the interaction of carbonyl in PMMA molecules with under-coordinated Pb atoms in perovskite films. Thirdly, the introduction of the PMMA thin film effectively avoided the direct contact of the perovskite and CuSCN, which retarded the potential reaction between MAPbI3 and CuSCN at elevated temperature and thus avoided interface decomposition. As a result, enhanced device performances were achieved involving increased power conversion efficiency up to 19.2% and superior device stability.
2. Experimental
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2, >98%), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, >98%, MW: ∼120000) tin(IV) oxide (SnO2, 15% colloidal dispersion in H2O), and cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN, >99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was prepared according to the method reported previously.6
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 10 Ω sq−1) was etched with Zn powder and hydrochloric acid (3 mol L−1) into a certain pattern, then washed sequentially with ethanol, acetone, and deionized water. All FTO glasses were cleaned in a UV ozone cleaner for 20 min before use. The diluted SnO2 nanoparticle solution (2.67% in water) was spin-coated on the FTO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 150 °C for 30 min. The MAPbI3 solution (1.2 mol L−1, DMSO/DMF = 1/4) was spin-coated on top of SnO2 layer at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 20 s with dripping of 200 mL chlorobenzene, then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The PMMA solution in chlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the perovskite thin film at 4000 rpm s−1 for 30 s. The CuSCN solution (30 mg mL−1 in diethyl sulfide) was drop casted within 3 seconds on the substrate containing the perovskite film spinning at 5000 rpm, and the substrate was spun for 30 seconds. Finally, 100 nm Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum.
Characterization
XRD measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) between 5° and 50° at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The absorption spectra of the samples were conducted on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-2700). ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on a NICOLET iS10 spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. AFM images were obtained by using Veeco IIIa MultiMode AFM scanning probe microscope. SEM images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission microscope operated at 5–10 kV. The space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) of the hole-only devices were tested with an electrochemical station (Keithley 2000). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a ThermoFisher ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer by using an Al Ka X-ray source. The current–voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2, which was carried out on a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under AM1.5 illumination (standard 100 mW cm−2) cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport silicon solar cell. Monochromatic incident-photon-to-current conversion-efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with monochromatic incident light at 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2 in direct current mode with a Newport 70356 spectrometer.
The steady state photoluminescence was measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Shimadzu FL-3600, excitation at 532 nm), and photoluminescence decay was determined with the single photon counting technique by HORIBA 3-D fluorescence spectrometer with a laser excitation of 635 nm. The PL lifetime was obtained by fitting the PL measured from perovskite films with or without ultrathin PMMA layer via a double-exponential decay function: (1)where I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time t, t is the time after a laser pulse excitation, C1 and C2 are coefficients, and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay lifetimes, respectively. We evaluated the decay lifetime of the perovskites using the average life time.
3. Results and discussion
The normal planar structure of PSCs based on CuSCN with a configuration of FTO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PMMA/CuSCN/Ag is shown in Fig. 1. PSCs based on CuSCN without and with PMMA modification were denoted as pristine devices and PMMA modified devices, respectively. It was noted that the same thin film deposition methods were employed during the fabrication of both pristine devices and PMMA modified devices, except for the introduction of PMMA in the latter. A cross-section SEM image of the PMMA modified device is displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which indicated that the thicknesses of CH3NH3PbI3 and CuSCN layers were approximately 400 nm and 70 nm, respectively. The PMMA layer was not clearly observed due to its ultrathin thickness. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the grain size of MAPbI3 was approximately 200 nm.

The surface morphology of perovskite thin films with or without PMMA was further investigated by atom force microscopy (AFM) characterization. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the surface roughness of the perovskite thin film decreased from 6.47 nm to 4.67 nm after PMMA treatment, suggesting that a smooth surface of the perovskite layer was achieved by the ultrathin PMMA layer, which may also fill the grain boundaries of the perovskite thin film, that was beneficial for achieving close contact between MAPbI3 and CuSCN.56,57

Steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine perovskite thin film and that treated with PMMA ultrathin layer were characterized. As shown in Fig. 3a, the pristine perovskite thin films exhibited a characteristic PL peak at 760 nm, while the PL intensity was increased by 300% after PMMA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3b, MAPbI3 film displayed an average PL lifetime of 98 ns, while MAPbI3/PMMA film exhibited relatively longer average PL lifetimes of 150 ns. The PL results indicate that the nonradiative recombination in the grain boundaries perovskite thin film may be retarded by the introduction of PMMA ultrathin layer.58,59 As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the main peak located at 138.3 eV can be assigned to the saturated Pb2+, which formed hexacoordinated (PbI6)4+ octahedra.60 The small peak centered at 136.8 eV can be assigned to under-coordinated Pb atoms that have been attributed to the metallic Pb (Pb0) according to the research reported previously.61,62 The under-coordinated Pb atoms may exhibit metallic characteristic because of iodide deficiencies at the surface of the perovskite film. The results suggested the existence of under-coordinated Pb atoms on the surface and/or grain boundaries of perovskite film, which acted as defect sites and induced nonradiative charge recombination.63,64 Moreover, the FTIR characterization (Fig. S5, ESI†) suggests that the PMMA carbonyl group could strongly interact with PbI2 and/or MAI in perovskite thin film.65 As a result, the PMMA interlayer may remove under-coordinated Pb atom defects at the MAPbI3/CuSCN interface through the formation of PMMA-PbI2 adduct.

In order to further investigate the variation of the trap density in perovskite thin films before and after PMMA treatment, we constructed hole-only devices with the configuration of ITO/NiO/MAPbI3/with or without PMMA layer/CuSCN/Ag, respectively.66 The J–V curves of hole-only devices without or with PMMA measured under dark are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. The trap state density could be estimated from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). The trap-state densities of hole-only devices without or with PMMA were 1.78 × 1016 and 1.02 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. These results suggest that the PMMA layer can suppress the defects in perovskite thin films.
The photovoltaic performance of pristine devices and PMMA modified devices has been investigated. The statistics of power conversion efficiency of 20 cells for each type are shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 for the champion devices with or without the inserted PMMA layer are shown in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. A small hysteresis with efficiency difference from 0.3% to 0.6% was observed between the forward and reverse scans, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). The pristine device exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.36% with a VOC of 1.03 V, a JSC of 22.07 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.72. The PMMA modified devices exhibited obvious enhanced PCE of 19.20% with a VOC of 1.10 V, a JSC of 22.38 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.78. The stable power output of the champion devices without or with the introduction of ultrathin PMMA layer were calculated by recording their photocurrent at the applied potential near the maximum power point (Fig. S8, ESI†). The data were also close to the values obtained from J–V measurement. The results implied that the interfacial engineering of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells via introducing an ultrathin PMMA layer between MAPbI3 and CuSCN was beneficial for device performance. Similar JSC for both pristine and PMMA modified devices was obtained in J–V measurement, which was associated with the results from IPCE characterization and close to their integrated current densities, respectively (Fig. 4c). The increased VOC and FF strongly implied that the introduced ultrathin PMMA layer was beneficial for the retardation of the charge recombination loss, which was ascribed to the elimination of trap-state density at MAPbI3/PMMA interface.

The dark-current densities (J0) of pristine device and PMMA modified device were measured, which was related to their nonradiative recombination of charge carriers. As shown in Fig. 4d, J0 of pristine device and PMMA modified device were 8.85 × 10−3 mA cm−2 and 1.13 × 10−4 mA cm−2, respectively. The lower J0 for PMMA modified device suggested a reduction in non-recombination rate, which was in favour of the improvement of photovoltaic performance.67,68 Impedance spectroscopy was employed to measure recombination resistance (Rrec). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the Rrec values of pristine device and PMMA modified devices were 1175 Ω and 3852 Ω, respectively. A larger Rrec for PMMA modified devices implied that the probability of charge recombination was decreased.69–71
We then investigated the effect of the introduced ultrathin PMMA layer on the device stability. The photovoltaic parameters of both pristine and PMMA modified devices were monitored at 85 °C. It was noted that an inert N2 atmosphere was employed to eliminate the influence of moisture. As shown in Fig. 5, there has been a sharp and rapid decline in the photovoltaic performance of the pristine device without the interfacial PMMA layer, involving the photocurrent, photovoltage as well as fill factor. Whereas, the PMMA modified device exhibited a superior stability. To gain further insight into this difference, the absorption spectra of the aging devices were recorded. As shown in Fig. 6a, the absorption intensity of the pristine device showed a declining trend during the aging process, which indicated that the light harvester perovskites maybe partly degraded. Dissimilarly, the absorption spectra of the PMMA modified device exhibited almost no change with increasing degradation time (Fig. 6d), which indicated that the degradation of perovskites can be prevented efficiently by the inserted PMMA layer.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to study the phase composition transmutation of both pristine device and PMMA modified device in the thermal aging process, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, with increasing the aging time, an obvious peak located at 12.7° that can be assigned to the (001) plane of PbI2 was observed and its intensity was increased gradually. Moreover, a new peak at 25.5° appeared (Fig. 6c), which was assigned to the (111) plane of CuI. Meanwhile, the intensity of the characterized diffraction peak of MAPbI3 (110) at 14.2° decreased gradually. The results implied that the reaction between CH3NH3PbI3 and CuSCN caused the formation of CuI and PbI2. On the other hand, the XRD spectra of the PMMA modified device showed almost no change (Fig. 6d–f), which suggested the benefit of the inserted PMMA layer for the retardation of interfacial decomposition between MAPbI3 and CuSCN.
The cross-section SEM images of both pristine devices and PMMA modified devices before and after aging for four days were obtained, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a and c, both pristine devices and PMMA modified devices showed similar layer by layer morphologies due to the same device fabrication process, except for the inserted ultrathin PMMA film in the latter. Before thermal aging, both pristine and PMMA modified devices showed perovskite layer and CuSCN layer with clear demarcation. After thermal aging, the dividing line between MAPbI3 and CuSCN layer disappeared in the pristine device (Fig. 7b), which implied thermal induced degradation between these two materials. Whereas PMMA modified devices exhibited unchanged morphologies during the thermal aging (Fig. 7d). The result further demonstrated that the ultrathin PMMA layers were effective on the retardation of interfacial degradation and improvement of the device stability, which was consistent with absorption and XRD studies.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new interfacial engineering strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells by introducing an ultra-thin PMMA layer between the interface of the perovskite and CuSCN. The PMMA layer can not only reduce the defects in perovskite thin films, but also prevent the interface damage caused by the reaction between perovskite and hole transporting layer, which was demonstrated by valid optical and electronic characterizations. As a result, CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells employing PMMA as an interfacial layer exhibited an enhanced efficiency of 19.2%. Moreover, the insertion of the PMMA interlayer improved the thermal stability of the corresponding perovskite solar cells.
