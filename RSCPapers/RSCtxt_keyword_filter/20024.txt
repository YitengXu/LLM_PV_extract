, Accepted 31st July 2013First published on 8th August 2013AbstractIn this work, the electron transport layer of PBDTTT-C-T/PC70BM polymer solar cells were subjected to UV–ozone treatment, leading to improved cell performances from 6.46% to 8.34%. The solar cell efficiency reached a maximum of 8.34% after an optimal 5 minute UV–ozone treatment, and then decreased if treated for a longer time. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanism behind the effects of UV–ozone treatment on the improvement of charge transport and cell performance is not fully understood. We have developed a fundamental understanding of the UV–ozone treatment mechanism, which explains both the enhancements in charge transport and photovoltaic performance at an optimal treatment time, and also the phenomenon whereby further treatment time leads to a drop in cell efficiency. Transient photocurrent measurements indicated that the cell charge transport times were 1370 ns, 770 ns, 832 ns, 867 ns, and 1150 ns for the 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min UV–ozone treatment times, respectively. Therefore the 5 min UV–ozone treatment time led to the shortest transport time and the most efficient charge transport in the cells. The 5 min UV–ozone treated sample exhibited the highest peak intensity (E2) in the Raman spectra of the treated films, at about 437 cm−1, indicating that it possessed the best wurtzite phase crystallinity of the ZnO films. Further increasing the UV–ozone treatment time from 5 to 20 min induced the formation of p-type defects (e.g. interstitial oxygen atoms), pushing the ZnO Fermi-level further away from the vacuum level, and decreasing the wurtzite crystallinity.
Introduction
Despite their lower efficiency, organic solar cells are receiving much attention due to their potentially low cost, light weight, flexibility and ease of fabrication into large areas by roll-to-roll processing.1–7 In a typical inverted structure bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cell (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag), the use of acidic PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer, as in a regular structure BHJ polymer solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al), can be avoided by using MoO3 as an electron blocking layer.8–10 High work function metals (e.g. Au, Ag) are used as the top electrode for hole collection, making inverted structure BHJ polymer solar cells a promising candidate for roll-to-roll processing.11,12 Also, the use of an n-type metal oxide as an electron transport layer provides additional interfacial area for exciton dissociation due to the close proximity of its Fermi level to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, leading to higher photo-current generation.13 ZnO and TiO2 are commonly used electron transport layer materials.
The most commonly used polymer in a BHJ cell, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has a large band-gap (∼1.9 eV) which limits the light harvesting ability of the cell. New polymer materials with low band gaps are being synthesized to increase light harvesting, which can increase current density (Jsc) provided other parameters such as carrier mobility, intermolecular interaction and molecular chain packing are optimized.14,15 One such polymer with a low band gap (∼1.58 eV) and high charge carrier mobility (μh = 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1) is poly{[4,8-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2-(2′-ethyl-hexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl]} (PBDTTT-C-T).16
So’s and Reynolds’ groups reported that UV–ozone treatment of a ZnO–poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) composite sol–gel film can improve the device performance and this is attributed to the removal of PVP by the UV–ozone treatment.17 They also performed X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and found that the quantity of both Zn–O bonds and O2− ions in the ZnO wurtzite structure had been significantly increased by the UV–ozone treatment, resulting in the surface of the ZnO nanoclusters being oxygen-rich.17 However, the origin of the observed improvements in cell performance after UV–ozone treatment for an optimal period of time, followed by a decrease in efficiency for longer treatment times, are not fully understood.
In this work, we significantly increased the performance of a PBDTTT-C-T/PC70BM solar cell, and studied the origin and mechanism of the effects of UV–ozone treatment on the electron transport layer, explaining both the observed improvement in cell performance after the optimal treatment time and also the decrease in efficiency after longer treatment times. In contrast to the previous report,17 the ZnO sol–gel was prepared without using PVP. Since PVP was not used in our ZnO preparation, the obtained ZnO surface had a much lower carbon content and this provided us with a much simpler case to study the mechanism of the UV–ozone treatment in the absence of organic impurities. Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the effects of the oxygen species introduced by the UV–ozone treatment, which not only improved the ZnO film quality by forming additional Zn–O bonds, but also led to the formation of defects, the quantity of which increased with longer UV–ozone exposure times. An improvement in the wurtzite phase crystallinity of the ZnO film was observed in the Raman spectra of the ZnO film treated with UV–ozone for 5 min, as evidenced by the increased E2 mode peak intensity. However, further increases in the treatment time induced higher defect densities, shown by the lowering of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the E1 mode, and the down-shifting of the Fermi levels of the ZnO films in the Kelvin probe measurement. The defect type could be concluded to be p-type, as the Fermi-level moved away from the vacuum energy level with longer UV–ozone treatment time. In addition, excess atomic oxygen species produced by the photo-catalytic breakdown of ozone during the UV–ozone treatment could easily diffuse into the ZnO film, where they could form new Zn–O bonds, occupying pores and gaps and leading to a smoothening of the ZnO surface,18 as evidenced by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Transient photocurrent (TPC) analysis was performed on all of the cells and showed that the shortest transport time taken by carriers was seen in the 5 min UV–ozone treated samples, further proving that 5 min was the optimal treatment time, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 8.34% in polymer solar cells.
Experimental section
PBDTTT-C-T was purchased from Solarmer Material, Inc. PC70BM was obtained from Nano C. MoO3 was ordered from Sigma Aldrich. Silver was purchased from Kurt J Lesker Company.
UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. For active layer absorption spectroscopy, ITO/ZnO was used as a blank reference. For the transmittance spectroscopy of ZnO, air was used as a blank reference. An Agilent 5500 SPM microscope was used to record AFM (topographic) images in tapping mode. Gwyddion was used for AFM image analysis. A green laser (532 nm) with a hole (50 μm) and grating (1800) was used to obtain Raman spectra of ZnO films coated on glass substrates. LabRam HR from HORIBA scientific was used to analyse the Raman spectra.
Transient photocurrents (TPCs) were measured using a dye laser coupled with a nitrogen laser to generate pulses at a specific wavelength (650 nm) to create a short transient photocurrent (pulse width < 1 ns) in the cell. The transient photocurrent was then measured by using a 20 ohm external series resistance to operate the device under a short circuit condition. The generated transient photocurrents were recorded using an Agilent MSO 07034B mixed oscilloscope (350 GHz, 2 GSa s−1). Obtained data were fitted with a mono-exponential decaying function to calculate the charge transport time in the device.
ZnO sol–gel solutions were prepared by dissolving 1 g zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and 0.28 g ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 10 ml 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH). The solution was stirred vigorously overnight and mildly heated at 60 °C.
Patterned ITO coated glasses were cleaned by ultra-sonication in detergent solution, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min each, and then dried under compressed nitrogen gas. Oxygen plasma treatment was performed for 20 min to remove any organic impurities from the ITO surface. The ZnO sol–gel solution was then spin coated at 4500 rpm for 1 min using a 0.2 micron PTFE filter. The resulting films were ramp heated at 30 °C min−1 and kept at 300 °C for 1 hour. Samples were then successively rinsed with de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and dried with nitrogen gas. UV–ozone treatment was then performed on various samples coated with a ZnO film, with different treatment times. Samples were moved to a N2 filled glove box and the active layer was spin coated at 800 rpm for 1 min and kept inside a closed glass Petri dish for a further 20 min. Samples were then transferred to an evaporator where a 6 nm thick MoO3 layer followed by an 80 nm thick Ag anode were deposited at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The devices were tested under simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 with an AM 1.5 filter. The area of the cell was 0.16 cm2.
Results and discussion
The PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM films (Fig. 1a) showed a wide absorption with a peak at 650 nm and an optical band gap of ∼1.57 eV, classifying PBDTTT-C-T as a low band gap polymer. Another peak at around 450 nm is due to PC70BM. The ZnO UV-visible transmittance spectra (Fig. 1b) showed a transmittance of above 85% in the visible range. Absorption of light below 350 nm by ZnO film helps to protect the polymer layer from UV-light induced degradation.8

Fig. 2 shows the AFM topographic image of the ZnO layer. The root mean square (rms) roughness of the ZnO film surface was found to decrease with longer UV–ozone treatment time. Specifically, rms values of 6.03 nm, 5.31 nm, 5.09 nm, 3.57 nm, and 2.86 nm were found for as-deposited (0 min), 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 20 min UV–ozone treated ZnO samples respectively. However this finding is different from a previous report by Small et al., where they found the rms roughness of the ZnO film increased with longer UV–ozone treatment time.17 The difference between their approach and ours is that they used PVP to prepare their ZnO–PVP nanocomposite electron transport layer, which can result in a nanocomposite containing a significant amount of carbon based impurities from the PVP. Their final ZnO film showed an increase in rms roughness from 7.07 to 9.18 nm after the UV–ozone treatment, and they attributed this to more ZnO nanoclusters being exposed at the surface after the removal of PVP by the UV–ozone treatment.17

In our case, we did not use PVP to prepare the ZnO electron transport layer and thus it had a much lower carbon content. The change in the surface rms value was mainly caused by the ZnO itself rather than the carbon content on the ZnO surface. This is consistent with another report by Tang et al., who reported that the excess atomic oxygen species produced by the photo-catalytic breakdown of ozone during the UV–ozone treatment could easily diffuse into the ZnO film, forming new Zn–O bonds that can fill in the pores and gaps, resulting in the smoothening of the ZnO surface.18 This can be further supported by the lower ZnO film surface rms roughness values (2.86–6.05 nm) in our samples than those reported by Small et al. (7.07–9.18 nm).17
Fig. 3 shows the inverted polymer solar cell device structure. Fig. 4 and Table 1 show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the photovoltaic parameters respectively, using ZnO films with different UV–ozone treatment times (as deposited, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min). The results shown in Table 1 are based on the average performance of 25 devices, with 5 of each ZnO film type. The current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) were highest for the 5 min UV–ozone treated sample and lowest for the as-deposited device, while decreasing trends in both Jsc and FF were found when the UV–ozone treatment time was increased from 5 to 20 min. This trend in device performance could be explained by the lowest series resistance in the 5 min UV–ozone treated sample, yielding a FF of 60.55%, Jsc of 17.90 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 8.34% (best performing cell). An increase in series resistance was observed when increasing the treatment time, resulting in a lower value of FF, Jsc and efficiency, as shown in Table 1. The highest cell performance for the 5 min treated device was due to the improved wurtzite phase crystallinity and charge transport of the ZnO film, attributed to the formation of new Zn–O bonds when those Zn atoms that are unbound or bound to impurities, bond with oxygen introduced by the UV–ozone treatment.19 However, extended treatment time also increases defect density due to the introduction of interstitial oxygen atoms.20 The improvement of the wurtzite crystallinity due to the formation of new Zn–O bonds, and the increase in defect density due to the introduction of interstitial oxygen atoms, are supported by the Raman spectra, transient photocurrents, and Kelvin probe measurements, which will be discussed later.

The open circuit voltage (Voc) was found to be comparable (∼0.75–0.77 V) for the as-deposited and UV–ozone treated devices with different treatment times. This is in contrast to a previous report by Olson et al. who found that UV–ozone treatment decreased the Voc in a P3HT/ZnO hybrid solar cell, where ZnO functioned as an electron acceptor.21 The reason for the decrease was that the Fermi level of ZnO was pushed further away from the vacuum level. This resulted in a lower energy difference between the ZnO Fermi level and the P3HT HOMO, and thus a smaller Voc. However, the role of ZnO in our device is not to act as an electron acceptor, but just an electron transport layer. Thus, the Fermi level variation should not directly affect the Voc, which is the reason why Voc remained comparable in our series of devices. This is consistent with the report by Small et al.17 In order to verify the J–V measurements, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the five device types were measured and compared in Fig. 4b.
The highest current density was obtained in the 5 min UV–ozone treated sample and lowest in the as-deposited device. The EQEs also followed a decreasing trend with increased UV–ozone treatment time from 5 to 20 min. The maximum EQE for the 5 min UV–ozone treated sample was 71.2% with a calculated Jsc of 18.63 mA cm−2 using  The calculated Jsc is very close to the measured Jsc (17.90 mA cm−2) from the J–V measurement within an error of less than 4%.
To understand the molecular origin of the improvement of device performance, Raman spectroscopy measurement of the ZnO films subjected to different UV–ozone treatment times was carried out. Fig. 5a shows the Raman spectra of the sol–gel method processed ZnO surfaces with different treatment times and Fig. 5b shows their fitted Raman curves after baseline correction using the Lorentz function. All of the fitted curves in Fig. 5b have coefficients of determination (R2) of above 0.93, meaning that the fitted curves are well correlated with the actual data set. Previous reports showed that the optical phonon E2 mode observed at about 437 cm−1 represents the characteristic Raman active peak for the wurtzite hexagonal crystalline phase of ZnO,22,23 while the longitudinal optical (LO) E1 mode observed at ∼580 cm−1 depends on the defect density in the ZnO film.20 The Raman inactive phonon mode B2 observed at 276 cm−1 represents the presence of an electric field arising from the adsorption of ambient oxygen by carbon impurities in the film.24 As shown in Fig. 5b, the intensities of both the E2 and E1 (LO) peaks of the as-deposited ZnO film are lower than those of the UV–ozone treated films. The 5 min UV–ozone treated sample exhibited the highest peak intensity (E2) at about 437 cm−1, indicating the best wurtzite phase crystallinity of the ZnO films.22,23 This can be attributed to the formation of new Zn–O bonds when the unbound Zn atoms or those that are bound to impurities, bond with oxygen introduced by the UV–ozone treatment.19 The E2 peak intensity starts to decrease gradually as UV–ozone treatment time is increased from 5 to 20 min, suggesting a decrease in wurtzite hexagonal crystallinity. As the UV–ozone treatment time is increased further, excess oxygen species are produced by the photo-catalytic breakdown of ozone and some oxygen species diffuse into the ZnO film.25 This can form p-type defects (e.g. interstitial oxygens) and thereby decreases the film crystallinity. All of the UV–ozone treated samples have an almost constant E1(LO) mode peak intensity at ∼577 cm−1, which is enhanced compared to the as-deposited sample. However, the FWHMs of the E1(LO) mode for the as deposited, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min UV–ozone treated samples are 84.93, 74.92, 69.61, 66.60, and 69.48, respectively, indicating an increase in the E1(LO) peak sharpness with longer UV–ozone treatment time. A previous report has shown that the enhanced E1(LO) peak sharpness indicated an increase in defect density.20 The formation of p-type defects is further confirmed by the Fermi level measurement that will be discussed later. This caused poorer charge transport and higher series resistance,26 which led to a lower FF and Jsc in the 10, 15 and 20 min samples than the 5 min UV–ozone treated samples. An increase in the B2 peak intensity at ∼276 cm−1 with longer UV–ozone treatment times is shown in Fig. 5a. This suggests that oxygen species are adsorbed by carbon impurities, forming CO2−, which is responsible for the lowered lattice symmetry and enhanced E1(LO) mode, leading to more defects in the film.24

To understand the effects of UV–ozone treatment on charge transport, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were performed on PBDTTT-C-T/PC70BM solar cells with different UV–ozone treatment times. Their TPC decay curves are shown in Fig. 6. The charge transport times were determined to be 1370, 770, 832, 867, and 1150 nano-seconds (ns) for the as deposited, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min UV–ozone treated ZnO samples respectively (Table 2). The 5 min UV–ozone treated cell shows the shortest charge transport time (770 ns) among all of the cells, which is consistent with the corresponding lowest series resistance observed in the J–V measurements. This indicates that the 5 min UV–ozone treated cell exhibited the most efficient charge transport with the fewest detects in the electron transport layer and/or the most effective PC70BM–ZnO contact. However, the charge transport time increased as the UV–ozone treatment time was increased beyond 5 min. This was caused by the formation of p-type defects such as interstitial oxygens due to the presence of excess oxygen species, which also decreased crystallinity, as evidenced by the reduction in the E2 peak intensity as discussed above. The defects can act as trap centers for generated charge carriers, which is supported by the observed decrease in FF for longer UV–ozone treatment times. The formation of p-type defects in ZnO is further supported by the Fermi level (work function) measurements, whose results are shown in Table 3. An increase in the UV–ozone treatment time from 0 to 20 min pushed the ZnO Fermi-level from −4.53 to −4.86 eV away from the vacuum level. This could be due to the excess oxygen species that induced p-type defects such as interstitial oxygens in the ZnO film.27,28

Conclusion
In conclusion, we provide insights on the effects of UV–ozone treatment on the electron transport layer that explains both the improvement of cell performance when subjected to the optimal treatment time, and also the observed decrease in efficiency with increasing treatment time. UV–ozone treatment of 5 min was found to be optimal, resulting in the highest performance with a cell efficiency of 8.34% under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for an inverted PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM solar cell. The transient photocurrent measurements showed that the UV–ozone treatment time of 5 min led to the shortest transport time (770 ns) and also the most efficient charge transport in the cells tested. The 5 min UV–ozone treated sample also exhibited the best wurtzite phase crystallinity of the ZnO films, as evidenced by the highest intensity of the peak (E2) in the fitted Raman spectra, at about 437 cm−1. Further increase in the UV–ozone treatment time from 5 to 20 min induced the formation of p-type defects (e.g. interstitial oxygens), pushed the ZnO Fermi-level further away from the vacuum level, and decreased the wurtzite crystallinity.
