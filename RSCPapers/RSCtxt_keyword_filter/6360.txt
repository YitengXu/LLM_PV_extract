    , Accepted 25th May 2017First published on 25th May 2017AbstractDye regeneration was improved by using an optimum quantity of graphene, which was dispersed in a polymer that suppresses back electron transfer. Using this approach, DSSCs with an efficiency of 10.4% have been fabricated.
Tremendous progress has been made in the design of dyes and photoanodes to improve the efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Dye regeneration and electron recombination are vital issues in DSSCs. Recombination occurs between electrons in TiO2 and holes in either dyes or electrolytes.1,2 This recombination is known as back electron transfer (BET), which is one of the key events that affects the efficiency of DSSCs. It is essential to note that the electron injection from the dye to TiO2 occurs in the picosecond time scale and the dye regeneration takes place in the nanosecond time scale.3 Contrary to this, electron transport from TiO2 to conducting glass occurs at the millisecond time scale.4,5 This high residence time of electrons in TiO2 increases the possibility of BET. The addition of additives and the modification of TiO2 with silanes are two of the approaches to suppress the BET.6–8 Inorganic oxides such as Al2O3, HfO2, and In2O3 have been used as barrier layers to suppress BET. The insulating nature of these oxides affects the charge injection from the dyes to TiO2.9–11 Polymers have also been used as a barrier layer. However, the increase in the efficiency was not significant. Recently, we used conjugated polymers with defined band edges as a barrier layer.12 We have identified a polymer that has HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.8 eV and −3.1 eV, respectively, as a suitable polymer to suppress the BET.
By using polymer P1 (ESI,† Scheme S1), we were able to suppress processes 6 and 7 (Scheme 1). Considering the wide band gap and the twist in the polymer backbone, the charge carrier mobility of this polymer is very low. Therefore, it was not possible to modulate process 3, which is the dye regeneration. We hypothesized that addition of graphene to P1 is likely to increase the efficiency of process 3 without compromising the advantages gained by P1. In fact, we found that the efficiency of P1 and graphene composite (P1–G) coated DSSCs is 10.4%. The control device that did not have a P1–G coating exhibited an efficiency of 7.5%. Thus, the difference in efficiency is ∼3%. This significant increase in the efficiency of the DSSCs is due to the suppressed BET and the increased dye generation efficiency imparted by the P1–G barrier layer.

DSSC devices were fabricated using N719 as a dye and iodolyte as an electrolyte. The efficiency was found to be 7.5%. In the next set of experiments, DSSCs were fabricated by coating P1–G on top of dye modified TiO2. To obtain an optimized quantity of graphene and its uniform dispersion in a blocking layer, we prepared the suspension of P1 with various graphene concentrations between 0.03 wt% and 0.15 wt%. The effect of incorporation of P1–G with various graphene loadings on the current density (Jsc), voltage (Voc), and PCE of DSSCs is summarized in Table 1. The measured J–V curves are shown in Fig. 1a. It is observed that the DSSC devices with a P1–G layer have shown a linear increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 0.03 wt% to 0.09 wt% of graphene. This results in an increase in the PCE of the devices. Beyond this concentration (0.09 wt%), the device performance was found to decrease (ESI,† Table S1). The change in the open circuit voltage (Voc) also followed a similar trend. A maximum FF of 71% was observed for the devices with P1–G (0.09 wt%). Henceforth, P1–G (0.09 wt%) will be mentioned as P1–G-0.09. Overall, the best efficiency (η) of 10.4% was observed for P1–G-0.09, which is 28% higher than that observed for standard devices (7.5%). The IPCE spectra of all the devices were recorded, and the best photon to electron conversion efficiency of 85% was observed for P1–G-0.09 coated devices (Fig. 1b). The IPCE of the devices was found to be in the following order: standard devices (65%) < P1–G-0.12 (80%) < P1–G-0.09 (85%). This result clearly reveals that P1–G predominantly enhances the charge collection at the electrodes. We attribute this increase to the suppressed BET and efficient dye regeneration while using P1–G as a barrier layer. Generally, Jsc would be affected by the electron transfer kinetics and the dye absorption. In our experiments, the photoanodes are adsorbed with the same quantity of the dye (∼22 × 10−7 mol cm−2). Thus, the higher PCE with P1–G is predominantly due to the electron transfer reactions instead of dye loading.

 Fig. 1  (a) Photocurrent–voltage curves for DSSCs with P1–G and (b) their IPCE spectra. 
The electron transfer kinetics and its dependency on PCE can be monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The whole DSSC cell was used for impedance analysis. The spectrum was recorded at the frequency range of 10 mHz to 3 MHz by applying a voltage of 0.6 V under dark conditions (Fig. 2a). The Nyquist plot shows two distinct semicircles, the semicircle at a high frequency represents the charge transfer at the counter electrode and the larger semicircle corresponds to the charge transport at TiO2–dye/electrolyte interfaces.13,14 We elucidated the change in charge transfer kinetics across these interfaces by introducing the P1–G layer and compared the results with the devices without this layer. The calculated parameters are shown in Table 1. The recombination resistance (Rrec) of the standard devices, P1–G-0.09 and P1–G-0.12 were found to be 110, 158, and 130 Ω, respectively (Fig. 2b). The Rrec of P1–G devices were higher than that of the standard device. The higher recombination resistance (158 Ω) observed for P1–G-0.09 devices indicates the decreased recombination in the presence of this layer. This decreased recombination can be ascribed to the high LUMO energy level of P1 that does not allow electron transfer. Thus, the BET through polymer to redox electrolytes is precluded. The Rrec of the devices with P1–G-0.12 is 21% lesser than that measured for the devices with P1–G-0.09. The decreased Rrec at higher graphene loading could be related to the exposure of graphene to the redox electrolyte that is likely to facilitate BET with the redox electrolyte. This trend clearly reveals the importance of optimizing the graphene loading to P1, which is essential to prepare a perfect blocking (barrier) layer. From the available data, the optimized graphene loading was found to be 0.09 wt% which shows a relatively higher Rrec with reduced BET.

Generally, the increased Rrec leads to electron accumulation at TiO2. This accumulation can be measured in terms of chemical capacitance (Cμ). In order to correlate the Rrec with DSSC cell efficiency, we resorted to calculating the capacitance from the impedance spectra of DSSCs. Fig. 2c represents the capacitance as a function of applied bias. The capacitance for the devices with P1–G-0.09 was found to be 8.1 × 10−3 F cm−2, which is higher than that measured for standard devices (4.7 × 10−3 F cm−2). This increased capacitance indicates that P1–G-0.09 precludes the BET and increase the electron density at TiO2.15 To further understand the charge accumulation and recombination process in P1–G coated cells, we calculated the electron lifetime at photoanodes. The lifetime can be calculated using the following equation: τn = Rrec·Cμ.16 The τn as a function of forward bias is shown in Fig. 2d. The measured lifetime of the P1–G-0.09 devices was found to be 113 ms, which is two times higher than the lifetime measured for standard devices (45 ms). This increased electron lifetime is due to the enhanced charge accumulation at the photoanodes. Slightly lower Cμ was observed for P1–G-0.12, which is a result of the reduced electron lifetime. This is due to the increased BET in the presence of an increased quantity of graphene in P1–G-0.12.17 The increase in capacitance is due to the increase in charge carrier density that alters the Fermi level of TiO2 photoanodes. Since the Voc is a measure of the difference between the Fermi level of photoanodes and the potential of a redox electrolyte, the change in Voc with respect to P1–G was determined. In the case of cells with P1–G, the Voc was 0.74 V, which is 30 mV higher than that of Voc observed for standard cells. This increase is due to the decreased recombination and increased accumulation of electrons at the photoanode.9
To evaluate the change in Voc while using the P1–G layer, we have analyzed the cells with various illuminating light intensities. The variation in Voc as a function of light intensity has shown a linear progression with a slope of 0.12 for devices with P1–G-0.09. This slope is higher than that of the devices without P1–G (0.09) (ESI,† Fig. S3C). This study reveals that the P1–G layer suppresses the recombination and increases the dye regeneration that invariably increases the charge accumulation at TiO2, which leads to increased Voc. In the next set of experiments, we evaluated the origin of the increase in Jsc of the cells made of P1–G blocking layers using a chronoamperometric photocurrent transient response. Fig. 3a shows the on–off switch on the cells with and without the P1–G layer by alternate irradiation at 0 mW cm−2 and 100 mW cm−2. An abrupt increase in the current without any delay time at the on state reveals that the P1–G layer efficiently increases the photo-excited charge accumulation at anodes.18 The response of standard devices without the P1–G layer is also provided in Fig. 3a, wherein the current generation was not similar to that of the devices with P1–G. These results confirm the photo-generated charge accumulation (capacitance) associated with P1–G coated devices. There are two possibilities for the photocurrent generation in DSSCs: (i) the majority of photoexcited electrons transferred from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and further transferred to the FTO current collectors and (ii) reduced electron transfer loss (recombination loss) at TiO2/electrolyte interfaces. Our approach of introducing the P1–G layer in DSSCs efficiently improves the regeneration of the dye and charge accumulation at TiO2. To further explain this, we have performed the EIS of the cells under illumination and in the absence of illumination (Fig. 3c and d). In the EIS spectra, the diameter of the semicircle was found to be larger for the dark measurements, which became smaller while the devices were illuminated with light. This is due to the photocurrent generation upon illumination. Interestingly, the measured capacitance for the P1–G devices under light illumination is 5.9 × 10−2 F cm−2 which is one order of magnitude higher than the capacitance measured for standard devices (7.1 × 10−3 F cm−2) under the same conditions.17 This result reveals that the charge accumulation at TiO2 is significantly enhanced when using the P1–G layer. If this is true, it should be reflected in the observed Voc of the devices. To check this, we have performed the photovoltage transient decay measurements (Fig. 3b). The results show that the observed Voc for P1–G devices was significantly higher than that of the standard devices. The Voc and photocurrent decay measurements have shown less hysteresis changes in various on–off cycles confirming the stability of the fabricated DSSCs.

Next, we reconfirm the dye regeneration process when using P1–G layers. The dye regeneration reactions can be studied using cyclic voltammetric measurements. We performed the CV of the devices with and without barrier layers (Fig. 4a). The CV of DSSCs with the P1–G layer shows four redox peaks (Red1: I3− + 2e− → 3I−, Red2: 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−, Ox1: 3I− → I3− + 2e−, Ox2: 2I3− → 3I2 + 2e−) (Fig. 4a). The ratio of the current density between the anodic and cathodic peaks can be related to the dye regeneration process. The peak ratio was found to be ∼16 for the P1–G devices, indicating that the charge injection from a redox electrolyte to the HOMO of the dye through P1–G is high. Whereas, the standard devices (TiO2 surfaces) have shown a peak ratio of 0.9, representing an equal chance of both dye regeneration and recombination processes in the devices. These results clearly indicate that graphene facilitates the electron transport from P1 to the photoanodes during the dye regeneration process with less recombination.12 To corroborate this, we have performed the photoluminescence studies of P1 and P1–G thin films (Fig. 4b). The results show that the photoluminescence intensity of P1 was found to be 9.3 × 104 a.u., which was quenched upon introducing graphene (P1–G) to a lower intensity (5.2 × 104 a.u.). This quenching indicates that graphene acts as an efficient scavenger for electrons at P1, directing the electrons to the HOMO of the dye for regeneration. The conductivity measured for the P1–G layer also supports a similar finding that graphene facilitates the enhanced dye regeneration (ESI,† Fig. S4). These experiments clearly prove that graphene facilitated the dye regeneration process in the P1–G devices. The standard and P1–G coated device performances were monitored at various time intervals (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 h). We were gratified to see the significant enhancement in the device stability for the P1–G coated devices (ESI,† Fig. S5). The PCE of a freshly fabricated standard cell was found to be 7.5%, and it decreased to 2.6% after 150 h of exposure to ambient conditions. This decreased performance for the standard device could be due to the detachment of dyes when the dyes are exposed to the redox electrolyte for a longer period. Interestingly, in the case of the P1–G-0.09 coated devices, the PCE was calculated to be 10.4%, which decreased by 30% after 150 h. These data reveal the efficacy of P1 in precluding the detachment of dyes from TiO2.

In summary, we have used a polymer with a LUMO energy of −3.1 eV as a barrier layer to suppress the recombination of electrons residing in either the dye or TiO2 with that of the holes in the electrolyte. An optimum quantity of graphene (0.09 wt%) was used to facilitate the dye regeneration process. Due to these desirable processes, the capacitance of the devices with P1–G was found to be 8.1 × 10−3 F cm−2. The electron lifetime at TiO2 for the P1–G coated devices increased to 113 ms that is 2.5 times more than that observed for control devices. Overall, the device efficiency of the P1–G coated devices was 10.4%, which is 28% higher than that of control devices.
