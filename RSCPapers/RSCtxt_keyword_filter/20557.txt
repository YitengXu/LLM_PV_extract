    , Accepted 11th September 2018First published on 12th September 2018AbstractRecently organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for photovoltaics because of their relatively high efficiency and low processing costs. However, for possible commercialisation, long-term stability remains a key obstacle, especially when compared to silicon or GaAs. Thus, future research will significantly focus on stability. The most relevant industry standards for the stability of solar cells are issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), summarized in the so-called IEC 61215 norm. The IEC 61215 is a series of very detailed, time-consuming and interconnected stress tests that provide accelerated aging conditions to extrapolate the potential long-term lifetime of a solar module. Established silicon, for example, passes the full IEC 61215. To gain the confidence of investors and customers, passing the full IEC 61215 is a necessary minimum requirement for the commercialization of perovskites. Interestingly, the IEC 61215 is not openly accessible which may be one reason why there are often references to outdated versions. To remedy this situation, we introduce and analyse the most current IEC 61215 stability standards for solar cells and to which degree perovskites have passed them. We then elaborate on the most pertinent challenges for the long-term stability of PSCs in the coming years. This includes less explored stability tests such as potential-induced degradation (IEC TS 62804-1) and ammonia corrosion (IEC 62716). From this, it is evident that currently underappreciated degradation modes such as mechanical stability, high applied voltages and reverse bias, where especially hot spots could become problematic, must be considered in the coming years when evaluating the long-term stability of PSCs.Michael SalibaDr Michael Saliba is a research group leader at the Adolphe Merkle Institute, Switzerland.

Introduction
Perovskite with an ABX3 structure – where A is Cs, methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), B is Pb or Sn and X is Cl, Br or I – have emerged in recent years with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of now 22.8%.1 One of the most relevant researched topics for PSCs is long-term stability that has not followed yet the spectacular gains in efficiency. Nevertheless, recently perovskites have made significant progress in long-term stability where most publications now also report relatively stable devices when compared to early reports. For example, in 2013, Burschka et al. reported PSCs that retained 80% of the initial efficiency of 8–9% after 500 h of continuous illumination at 45 °C.2 Only three years later, using polymeric buffer layers, PSCs were reported that retained over 95% of the initial efficiency after 500 h of continuous illumination at 85 °C at maximum power point (MPP) tracking.3 Recently, promising results were reported using thick metal oxide buffer layers where encapsulated devices passed 1000 h at 85 °C in the dark with a relative humidity (RH) of 85% without efficiency loss.4,5 This bodes well for PSCs that have incrementally improved with respect to light and heat-induced degradation. Many of the above aging conditions are selected because they resemble the so-called IEC 61215 standard, fully entitled as the “terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules – design qualification and type approval”. The IEC 61215 is a series of very detailed, time-consuming and interconnected stress tests that provide accelerated aging conditions to extrapolate the potential long-term lifetime of a solar module. All established technologies, such as Si and GaAs, pass the full IEC 61215. It is highly unlikely that investors and customers would adopt PSCs if they did not pass the same strict stability tests. Thus, passing the IEC 61215 is a necessary minimum requirement for the commercialisation of perovskites (or any other solar cell material). We note that as the understanding of perovskites progresses, further stress tests may be required that account for specific perovskite behaviour such as hysteresis and reversible losses.6–9 Otherwise it unlikely that PSCs can be a viable industrial option on a global scale, especially when considering the attractive option of a perovskite on silicon tandem where perovskites would have to be as stable as the silicon cell.4,10 In this sense, passing limited laboratory tests for a few months will be insufficient in the real world where solar cells have to withstand years of exposure to various harsh conditions. This is all the more urgent as the frontrunner silicon has already a proven stability for decades enabling consumer confidence in terms of return on investment. The importance of the IEC stress tests for solar cells is also universally acknowledged by perovskite companies such as Frontier Energy Solutions and Saule Technologies that focus on satisfying the IEC 61646 standard, which was recently incorporated into the IEC 61215.11
To pass the IEC 61215, the first step must be to exactly outline it. Interestingly, the IEC standards are often found only in an industrial context as they are not freely accessible and come at a considerable monetary cost. We believe this could partially be the reason why there are occasionally conflicting or outdated accounts on the precise IEC testing parameters in the scientific literature. For example, often it is not reported that during the thermal cycling, which is one of the required tests, a current is applied to the solar cells. This is important since high series resistance can induce elevated local heat that possibly exceeds 85 °C, often considered the maximum reachable temperature.
Here, we provide a detailed review of the most current IEC 61215 tests for photovoltaics and then discuss in how far PSCs pass it. We then outline stability aspects which have to be understood and improved before PSCs may be commercialised, e.g. reverse bias behaviour, which is connected to hot spots which are small points on a solar module that are excessively heated as shown in Fig. 1B. For example, one of the biggest challenges for commercialized silicon modules in the last 10 years are hot spots as shown in Fig. 1A. A test which is already challenging for relatively stable silicon will likely also be challenging for PSCs. Other examples are mechanical (Fig. 1C), high voltage and humidity freeze stability.
 Fig. 1  Three examples of future challenges on the path of commercialization for the stability of PSCs: module, mechanical and electric field stability.

The IEC 61215 is only a minimum requirement. To guarantee lifetimes of 25 years, see silicon, it is necessary to pass the IEC test multiple times. For example, it was found that 500 thermal cycles, compared to 200 cycles in the IEC 61215, suffice to extrapolate usage of up to 25 years.12,13 There are additional IEC tests for solar cells to ensure the usage in certain areas such as ammonia corrosion (IEC 62716), important for agricultural regions, or to test observed degradation pathways from field tests such as potential-induced degradation (IEC TS 62804) as shown in Fig. 1D. Table S1 in the ESI† contains a full list of all the different IEC tests used in this review.
Design qualification and type approval of photovoltaic modules – IEC 61215
The IEC is the leading global organization developing consensus-based international standards for electric technologies. Standards are developed based on field experience and regularly updated. The newest version of the IEC 61215 is based on nearly 40 years of experience.14 The standard aims at testing industrial modules whereas research labs mostly use small-area, single solar cells. We, therefore, focus on all parameters of the IEC test which can also be used for single cells. Nevertheless, in the long-run perovskites will have to transition towards modules. Therefore, module stability is important and should also become a focus of the research in the long run. This will have to include a critical assessment of upscaling methods for PSCs. Especially encapsulation of large-scale perovskite modules will be a key challenge because this often requires elevated temperatures that can harm the perovskite absorber.
Official module testing for the IEC 61215 standard starts by using ten modules that are handled according to the flowchart in Fig. 2. All modules are initially tested to confirm the producer's specifications such as efficiency. After five initial tests, the modules are separated and subjected to one of the sequences called A, B, C, D or E, and afterwards tested again for efficiency and safety. Each sequence contains several stress tests aiming specifically for one of the identified main degradation causes that commonly occurs. They are briefly (see below for a more detailed account):
 Fig. 2  Full test flow for design qualification and type approval of PV modules. We note that there are five testing sequences called A, B, C, D and E. Each test is briefly described in Table S2† and important stability tests (marked in green) for PSCs are described in more detail in the main text.

• Sequence A, the control sequence, contains mild conditions to provide basic characterisation.
• Sequence B tests hot-spots and outdoor behaviour.
• Sequence C combines several stress tests where the modules are first preconditioned with UV light and then subjected to 50 thermal and 10 humidity freeze cycles.
• Sequence D contains 200 thermal cycles.
• Sequence E is the damp-heat test together with the mechanical stability tests.
All tests are listed in Table S2.† The standard is approved for the module series if all modules pass the requirements of each sequence. If one module fails, two additional new modules are tested again for the respective sequence. In general, after each test sequence (or for test Sequence B after the bypass diode test), the degradation should not be more than around 5%, more details in ESI Note 1.† Other general passing criteria are that after each test the wet leakage current test is repeated, and no evidence of any visual defect should be seen. Fig. 2 shows the relevant tests for PSCs, marked in green.15
In the following, we present the components of the different sequences in more detail and with respect to PSCs.
Measuring at standard test conditions (STC)
The module is kept at room temperature of 25 ± 2 °C. The JV-curve is measured under light with 1000 ± 100 W m−2 in accordance with IEC 60904-1 (also used for the certification measurement). The irradiance is measured by a suitable reference device. The light source should be either natural sunlight or at least a class BBA simulator containing UV light.16
Hot-spot endurance test (Sequence B)
Hot-spots occur when single cells in the module do not work correctly and large amounts of current accumulate in small spots, the “hot spots”, or over the whole cell. This can lead to high temperatures in a short amount of time. The overheating under operation can be due to internal factors such as faulty or mismatched cells, or external factors such as shadowing or soiling. This forces the cell into reverse bias dissipating power which can lead to overheating. Depending on the module the solder can melt, the encapsulant or the front/backsheet can decay, or the substrate, as well as the cover glass, can crack. The reverse bias behaviour varies depending on the shunt resistance of the cell. If the shunt resistance is low, the worst-case occurs when the whole cell is shadowed. This often comes from localized shunts where large currents flow into small areas. This can lead to rapid, excessive heating. For high shunt resistance cells, the worst case occurs after a long time of partial shading which can lead slowly to the breakdown of the junction or high temperatures in the cell. Both cell types can suffer from hot spot damage. The major technical issue is to find the worst-case scenario because it depends on the connection type of the cells in the module. Once the worst-case is identified, the module is exposed to it at 50 ± 10 °C under 1000 W m−2 irradiance with the maximum power dissipating for at least 1 h. If the temperature is still increasing after 1 h, the test is extended up to 5 h. In other words, the worst and most vulnerable cells of the module are forced into reverse power and produce as much heat as possible for up to 5 h mimicking accelerated aging.16 We note that hot spot damage is one of the most severe degradation modes reported over the last 35 years. This is shown in Fig. 1A where many other degradation routes, for example, the discoloration of the encapsulant, were significantly reduced through better materials.17
The stability behaviour of PSCs under reverse bias is rather unexplored. There are studies on, for example, photodetectors with MAPbI3 working under reverse bias,18–20 but the different architectures hamper a conclusive stability assessment. Bowring et al. report one of the few examples focusing on reverse bias behaviour of PSCs.21 They found degradation at reverse bias which, however, is mostly recoverable. Interestingly, the recovery takes significantly longer when the shading is repeated. This could be a substantial challenge for permanent shadows that commonly occur in residential areas or from accidental soiling. Moreover, there are still unexplored questions with respect to partial shadowing and if perovskites show a different stability behaviour for the high or low shunt resistance regime compared to crystalline solar cells.
In addition, the architecture matters too. For example, Abate and co-workers observed a reversible loss component which becomes, surprisingly, a reversible bonus for inverted architectures.7,8 Furthermore, the high temperatures, which can potentially exceed 85 °C, could become a new challenge for materials other than the perovskite in the architecture.22,23 Bowring et al. reported that the silver metal contact melted because of excessive local heating (see Fig. 3A).21 They found that the heating at reverse bias at −5 V is either uniform across the electrode (Fig. 3B) or localized (Fig. 3C). For an ITO metal electrode, the heating occurred across the whole area. On the other hand, most cells with a metal electrode, such as gold or silver, show local heating due to defects. The hot spot test shows that perovskite modules will have to face new stability challenges. One first step to study hot spot behaviour could be to measure the stability of single solar cells under reverse bias, at 50 °C and full illumination for 1 to 5 h, as prescribed by the IEC 61215, to simulate possible stress in modules. We note that in most commercial modules bypass diodes are installed which can prevent hot spot damage. However, we note that bypass diodes also have to withstand the bypass diode thermal stress test (see Table S2†).

Outdoor exposure test (Sequence B)
Preliminary resilience to outdoor conditions is tested. This may reveal synergistic degradation processes which do not occur under laboratory conditions. The cells are mounted normal to the local latitude ±5°. A resistive load or MPP tracker is attached to the module. The module should be exposed to at least 60 kW h m−2.16
Apart from harsh conditions that are constantly applied during outdoor exposure, it could also be the fast-changing conditions that induce detrimental degradation. For example, it was reported that polymer coated devices retained over 95% of the initial efficiency after 90 days of outdoor exposure in Turin (Italy) surpassing even the outdoor requirements of the IEC 61215 (Fig. 4B).24 Other outdoor testing reports of encapsulated devices, with a similar architecture, showed 80% of the initial energy output remained after 9 days.9 Reyna et al. reported that encapsulated devices had a T80 (80% of the initial efficiency) of 36 days.25

UV preconditioning (Sequence C)
The cells are exposed to UV-light before 50 thermal cycles and the humidity freeze test. With this, materials and adhesive bonds, that are prone to degrade under UV light, can be identified. The module is kept at 60 ± 5 °C. If the light source has a negligible spectral part in the visible range the module can be set to short-circuit, otherwise it is driven at MPP. Between 280 and 400 nm, the light source should not exceed 250 W m−2 (about five times the level of the sun). Furthermore, between 3 and 10% of the irradiance should be between 280 and 320 nm. In total, the module should be subjected to at least 15 kW h m−2 of UV irradiation between 280 and 400 nm.16 We note that the failure rates of photovoltaic modules for the UV-test are very low in many reports.26–28 This is related to the low UV dosage which is already reached after a few months of outdoor exposure. One of the biggest challenges in field tests was the discolouration and eventual failure of the encapsulant, mostly ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). Often this was caused by unstable additives. Currently, a new test, the IEC 61730, is developed testing only the encapsulation material for UV stability. This could become an additional IEC test or be eventually included in the IEC 61215.12
The role of UV-stability for perovskites is still discussed. It is clear that PSCs are sensitive to UV-light when the perovskite is in contact with TiO2.29 However, the presence of TiO2 is not mandatory. Several reports with SnO2 or BaSnO3 showed high performances with encouraging stability under UV-light.30,31 Nevertheless, it is not established yet if perovskites have to withstand direct UV exposure as there may exist possible preventative solutions. Bella et al.,24 for example, reported two polymer coatings which downshifted the incoming UV-light and protected also the underlying perovskite from humidity. Five devices were aged for over 6 months under UV-illumination of 50 W m−2 retaining on average 98% of the initial efficiency (see Fig. 4A). The amount of UV-light even exceeded the requirement of the IEC 61215. Potentially, one possible solution is the usage of a UV filter, although this would come at additional manufacturing costs and stability challenges.
Humidity freeze test (Sequence C)
High temperatures and humidity followed by temperatures below zero are tested combining the thermal cycling and the heat damp test. The modules are measured again in a climatic chamber. A continuous current is applied (no more than 0.5% of the measured STC peak power current). As shown in Fig. 5, ten cycles from −40 to 85 ± 2 °C are performed. One cycle takes about 1 day. The 85 °C step is held for at least 20 h with a RH of 85 ± 5%. The minimum temperature of −40 °C is held for at least 30 min. The temperature ramp from 0 to −40 °C (200–72 °C h−1) can be twice as fast as the temperature ramp from 85 to 0 °C (100–72 °C h−1). In addition to the general passing criteria, no interruption of the current should be observed. Afterwards, the module is recovered for 2 or 4 h at 23 ± 5 °C and a RH of less than 75% at open-circuit.16
 Fig. 5  Humidity-freeze cycle profile. In total 10 cycles are performed after the UV and 50 thermal cycle tests. One cycle takes roughly around one day. The minimum temperature ramp is 72 °C h−1. Copyright © 2016 IEC Geneva, Switzerland http://www.iec.ch. 
To the best of our knowledge, for PSCs there are no reports for the humidity freeze test. Most works at the moment focus on stability under light, or conditions which are similar to thermal cycling or damp heat test.
Thermal cycling test (Sequence C or D)
The modules are brought into a climatic chamber with temperature control. Air circulates inside to minimize condensation. The modules are cycled 50 (Sequence C) or 200 times (Sequence D) between −40 to 85 °C with at least a dwell time of 10 minutes (see Fig. 6). During the heating step from −40 to 80 °C, a continuous current is applied depending on the technology. For crystalline silicon, the current is equal to the peak power current under STC and for amorphous silicon, CIGS and CdTe it is equal to 10% of the peak power current. During the cooling and at temperatures above 80 °C, the current is reduced to less than 1% of the peak power current. The heating and cooling rates during the cycles should be between 45 and 100 °C h−1. The time for one cycle should not be longer than 6 h. Additionally, no interruption of the current should be observed. Afterwards, the module has a minimum recovery time of 1 h at 23 ± 5 °C and a RH of less than 75% at open circuit.16 It is important to apply a current during the cycling to cause local heating that can have a different effect compared to environmental heating. For example, for high series resistances, the current enhances local heating. The maximum temperature of 85 °C will also impose a minimum requirement that perovskites will have to withstand. The degradation cause for crystalline solar cells was not the maximum temperature but rather thermal fatigue which might be different for PSCs.

During the heating from −40 to 80 °C a current of 10% of the maximum power current for CIGS, CdTe and amorphous silicon. For crystalline silicon it is 100%. The heating and cooling should not be lower than 45 °C h−1. Copyright © 2016 IEC Geneva, Switzerland http://www.iec.ch. 
Damp heat test (Sequence E)
Humidity exposure on a long-time scale is tested. The module is held at 85 ± 2 °C at a RH of 85 ± 5% for 1000–1048 h. Afterwards, the module is recovered for 2 to 4 h at 23 ± 5 °C and a RH of less than 75% at short-circuit.16
In 2017, encapsulated perovskite devices at around 10% PCE passed the damp heat test: 1000 hours at 85 °C and 85% RH without degradation as shown in Fig. 7A.4 An industrial encapsulation process was successfully applied to an MA-free, CsFA perovskite. The perovskite absorber was protected by an ITO capping layer and encapsulated with EVA, glass and butyl rubber edge seal. The encapsulation successfully protected the PSCs from humidity. Moreover, it was reported that the elasticity of the encapsulant on top of the device is an important factor.32 The rigid Surlyn encapsulant delaminated after 200 temperature cycles while the flexible EVA encapsulant did not as shown in Fig. 7B. The EVA-covered devices were mechanically more stable over the course of the temperature cycling and showed no signs of cracking, blistering or delamination. It is noteworthy that all nine tested solar cells retained over 90% of the initial efficiency.32 The study also highlights that each layer needs to be individually stable to ensure overall mechanical stability.32,33 Shi et al.34 reported on polyisobutylene (PIB) encapsulated devices with FAPbI3 and PTAA as the HTM. Their devices of around 8% PCE passed 200 thermal cycles from −40 to 85 °C and 540 h at 85 °C with 85% RH without efficiency losses. Interestingly, the PIB does not seem to react with the perovskite even when in direct contact. The same study also used EVA, but the devices degraded by more than 50% while stored under ambient conditions. We note that the encapsulation material needs to be carefully selected because it may react with the glue. Matteocci et al.,35 for example, found that a Kapton layer deposited prior to the encapsulation significantly lowered the degradation from the encapsulation.

It seems that two points are important for passing the heat damp test and the thermal cycling test. First, a temperature stable architecture is needed, where especially the perovskite composition is important. Here, often MA-free perovskites are used because of the volatility of MA.36 Second, encapsulation can successfully prevent against humidity indicating that humidity stability can be managed with external protective layers. Thus, heat and light stability may be more challenging for long-term stability because they affect the intrinsic stability behaviour of perovskites. It has to be seen if it is possible to pass the thermal cycling test potentially also with MA since just recently promising results were published which showed the MAPbI3 devices of around 10–13% PCE which had no efficiency loss after 1000 h on a hot plate at 85 °C as shown in Fig. 7E.37
Hail test (Sequence E)
Eleven shots of ice balls (25 mm diameter) with a weight of 7.53 g are fired with a speed of 82.8 km h−1 at sensitive locations of the module. The hail size, mass and speed can change if locations on the module are hard to reach. The locations and the hail size are indicated in Tables S3 and S4,† respectively. In the following, the hail test is discussed together with the static mechanical load test as both assess the mechanical stability of PSCs.16
Static mechanical load test (Sequence E)
The module is mounted on a rigid structure. The mounting method should be conducted as a worst case scenario as given by the producer of the module. Often, this is achieved by the largest possible distance between the fixing points. A static load of at least 2400 Pa is put on the module (or higher if stated by the manufacturer). The load is then gradually and uniformly applied for 1 h to the surface while the internal circuit is monitored continuously. Then the load is applied to the back surface or as an uplift to the front for 1 h. Both steps are repeated twice so that in total three cycles of at least 2400 Pa are applied to the front and the back side. In addition to the general passing criteria, no open-circuit fault should occur.16
It was reported that flexible PSCs were bent 5000 times with a radius of 2 mm and retained 85% of the initial efficiency. However, it is unclear if bending a device demonstrates mechanical stability since relatively little pressure is applied.38 For organic photovoltaics (OPV), similar results were reported. There, remarkable bending stability was shown but at the same time instability due to thermomechanical stress occurred.39–41 Rolston et al.33,38 reported extremely fragile PSCs under applied load. They found that especially the charge transport layers such as PC61BM are fragile and easy to break but also that the perovskite itself exhibited low mechanical stability. These results are similar to Cheacharoen et al.32,38,42 One interesting experiment would be to measure PSCs before and after applying a mechanical load of up to 2400 Pa for 1 h. This experiment should be feasible for most laboratories. We note that mechanical stability is an important metric for commercialisation that perovskites have to show in addition to being highly efficient, low cost and stable under light, heat and humidity. Any hail storm could otherwise be already a threat and could necessitate further, costly encapsulation to protect from mechanical degradation. Moreover, for flexible PSCs, a rigid encapsulation would be unpractical and therefore it is necessary to optimize the perovskite composition also for mechanical stability.
Wet leakage current test (before and after Sequence A–E)
The insulation of the module under wet conditions is tested. The module is horizontally immersed in a tank with a solution (with a resistivity of 3500 Ω cm−1 or less) at 22 ± 2 °C. The voltage on the module is then increased for 2 min to 500 V or the maximum sustainable voltage of the system, depending on which one is higher. Then the insulation resistance is measured. The applied voltage is reduced to zero and the module is discharged. For modules with an area less than 0.1 m2, the insulation resistance should be >400 MΩ. If the module has an area of more than 0.1 m2 the insulation resistance should be >40 MΩ for every additional m2.16
The wet leakage current test is repeated after most tests because it assesses the integrity and safety of the module as well as the encapsulation.4 Importantly, after the damp heat and the humidity freeze test, delamination of the module or the edge sealing can occur.4 To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports for encapsulated PSCs regarding the wet leakage current test although it is a well-known method to measure the quality of the encapsulation after stress testing.
In addition, other tests, as for example, the insulation test of the IEC 61215, require high voltages. For the insulation test, 1000 V plus twice the maximum system voltage is applied (for systems with a lower voltage than 50 V only 500 V plus twice the system voltage is applied). Thus, to pass the IEC 61215, solar cells need to withstand high voltages for a few minutes. This could become a challenge for PSCs. Bae et al. found that PSCs degraded within minutes when a bias was applied which exceeded the maximum power voltage.43 Although this test was conducted under light, it is an indication that PSCs are sensitive to high applied voltages which could become problematic.
Initial and final stabilization (before and after Sequence A–E, respectively)
The modules need to be electrically stabilized using light soaking. The module is seen as stable if the electrical power output fulfils:  x is a technology-specific parameter. For CIGS, CdTe and amorphous silicon, it is 0.02 and for crystalline silicon 0.01. Pmax, Pmin and Paverage are determined from three consecutive power measurements.16
The initial and final stabilization procedure varies depending on the technology. For each technology, all modules are exposed to at least two light doses. After the preconditioning, as shown in Table 1, the power is measured with a JV-curve at STC. The procedure is repeated until the maximum power is stabilized as previously described. At least two light doses, as described in Table 1, are applied. For the final stabilization, the test conditions are the same for CIGS, CdTe and amorphous silicon. For crystalline silicon, it is not necessary to perform the final stabilization. After that, the JV-curve at STC is measured again.

In field tests, silicon modules degrade with less than 1% efficiency per year and degradation under light is not significantly accelerated. Therefore, it is not surprising that the IEC 61215, which was mainly designed for silicon, contains only short amounts of continuous light exposure of up to 43 kW h m−2, which rather aims at stabilizing the power output. Not much insight was gained from testing for longer times under light because it is not a hard stress factor for silicon. Instead, test conditions combining, for example, heat and humidity were found to pinpoint the main weakness of the PV-modules as briefly summarized in Table 2.

Since PSCs have unique properties under prolonged light exposure, such as ion migration, it is likely that additional specific standard tests are needed such as longer light exposure times. As proposed recently, the devices should be measured under real working conditions at MPP for at least 100 h to account for the different ionic movements, slow and fast, in the perovskite. Furthermore, a remeasurement after a recovery in the dark may be considered when reversible and irreversible degradation is analysed.6
Outlook on stress tests that go beyond the IEC 61215 to guarantee lifetimes of up to 25 years
The IEC 61215 is the minimum requirement which solar cells must withstand to be used in the field. The IEC 61215 cannot provide warranties of up to 25 years. Thus, the International PV Quality Assurance Task Force works with the IEC on developing comparable information about the relative module durability.48 It is for example consensus that 200 thermal cycles are not sufficient to simulate an effective 25 years of cumulative stress on a module.12 Thus, there is an on-going discussion on how to correctly determine a calibration curve for accelerated aging where extreme stress conditions in the short-term can be extrapolated to outdoor stability in the long-term. One plan, for example, is to develop a new testing protocol, the IEC 62892-1, where the maximum temperature of 85 °C during cycling is increased to simulate higher stress levels. It is based on the work of Bosco et al. who compared the material damage, which was accumulated in several cities, with the damage accumulated from thermal cycling.49 It suggests that 25 years of usage in Chennai (India), for example, correlate with around 630 thermal cycles from −40 to 85 °C. For Phoenix and Tucson (USA), 470 and 560 cycles are required, respectively. Already the increase of just 10 °C from 85 °C to 95 °C as the maximum temperature would reduce the required thermal cycles drastically. For Phoenix, for example, the required cycle number would be lowered from 470 to 154 cycles. This testing protocol is still in progress but it outlines clearly what might come as additional geographic requirements for PV systems. Other developed tests of the IEC account for the usage in certain areas. Some of these tests are already adopted by the industry to show the quality of their modules or to ensure the usage in harmful environments for photovoltaic modules, e.g. in agricultural areas or close proximity to the sea. In the following, we present these additional qualification tests.
Industry standards – an extension of the IEC 61215
Industry sometimes repeats the IEC 61215 test several times to extrapolate for longer stabilities. Especially in the last years, guarantees of up to 25 years are given for photovoltaic modules for which the IEC tests alone are inadequate. Typically, those warranties cover a degradation of more than 3% in the first year and following an annually degradation of 0.6–0.7% per year for 24 years. In Table 3 and Fig. 8, a typical extended testing procedure, which aims at giving a guarantee of 25 years of lifetime, is shown and compared to the IEC 61215. The test is supposed to be performed analogously to the IEC 61215, however with the conditions outlined in Table 3. Thus, to ensure long lifetimes of 25 years, perovskites would need to pass conditions similar to this test.

Ammonia corrosion testing – IEC 62716
Here, agricultural areas are considered that are frequently close to stables where the environment is highly corrosive and wet. Ammonia can cause corrosion of the metallic parts and degrade non-metallic parts such as plastics and encapsulants.
The cells are exposed for 8 h to 6667 ppm of ammonia (NH3) at 60 ± 3 °C. The density corresponds to 2 L of groundwater in a room volume of 300 L. The saturation should be close to 100%. The sample should be wet from ammonia. Afterwards, the test chamber is ventilated to expel all ammonia. The concentration should be 0 ppm and is then left at 18–28 °C at a maximum RH of 75% for 16 h. This is repeated 20 times, i.e. a total of 480 h. For crystalline silicon, the degradation should be less than 5% of the initial efficiency. For thin-film technologies, the degradation should be less than 10% of the initial efficiency.
This test could be of particular interest for PSCs as ammonia (NH3) is similar to the MA (CH3NH3) cation and can, therefore, modify the ABX3 structure.50 Thus, the encapsulation in an ammonia environment may need to be particularly resilient as the active perovskite material is at an increased risk of degradation when exposed to ammonia. Bao et al. found, for example, that MAPbI3 films turned from brown to colourless within one second when they were exposed to ammonia and degraded permanently after longer times.50 This could even have implication for the leaking of perovskite materials as the ammonia may exchange with some of the perovskite constituents that could then be dispersed more easily in the environment.
IEC TS 62804-1 – test methods for the detection of potential-induced degradation for crystalline silicon
One of the main criticisms of the IEC 61215 is that it does not contain any tests regarding the potential induced damage, which was one of the early main concern for the silicon PV community.12,51 It was found that a voltage potential between the active circuit of the module and the grounded module surface can lead to degradation through, for example, ionic transport. The IEC TS 62804-1 offers, therefore, an informative analysis of the susceptibility for crystalline silicon under high applied voltages at high temperature and humidity. There are two different ways of testing for crystalline silicon. The first method tests the stress towards the edges of the module. The grounded module is kept at 60 ± 2 °C with a RH of 85 ± 3%. After a stabilization phase of 12 to 24 h, the maximum system voltage is applied for 96 h. If no degradation is measured, the test can be repeated at 65 or 85 °C. The second test method is for the whole module and the packaging materials. The whole glass surface of the module is covered with a conductive material such as aluminium. The module is then kept at 25 ± 1 °C and a RH of less than 60%. The maximum system voltage is applied for 168 h. If no degradation is measured. The test can be repeated at 50 or 60 °C.
This test could be especially interesting for perovskites because it was found that under illumination and under an applied electric field, ion migration occurs showing the susceptibility of PSCs to already small electrical fields.7
Conclusions
In the last years, PSCs made enormous progress regarding not only efficiency but also stability. Within 9 years, stability improved from a few minutes to a few months and now even over one year.52–54 This development is the foundation for a possible commercialization. One important precondition for that is to pass international stability standards for PV, i.e. the IEC 61215 test for solar cells. To pass the test, it is necessary for a solar cell to be stable under numerous conditions (see Tables 2 and S2†). It is, therefore, increasingly important to not only investigate isolated stability conditions such as illumination but also heat, cold, humidity, UV-light, high bias voltage, outdoor conditions and mechanical load. Several reports showed that it is possible for perovskites to pass single tests of the IEC 61215.4,24,34,37 This includes promising results for thermal cycling, damp heat, outdoor and UV-light. However, there are relatively few PSC reports about mechanical, reverse bias, high voltage and humidity freeze stability. Hence, more severe steps must be taken now if commercialisation is to become a reality. For example, it is important to investigate how PSCs behave under mechanical load. It is highly unlikely that a solar cell will be commercialized which degrades or breaks under mechanical load. Every snowfall or hail storm would otherwise be already a potential risk. In addition, stability under reverse bias is important, which is connected to hot spot damage. This is one of the most severe reported field degradations for new silicon solar cells, a technology that is proven to be significantly more stable than PSCs. There is no reason why it should be different for perovskites, a material which is known for its sensitivity and even uses organic components. Accordingly, hot spots could require perovskites to withstand not only 85 °C but also even higher temperatures. Another important aspect of the IEC 61215 is the sequential testing. Most tests are performed in a sequence to simulate certain stress conditions. The UV test is a preconditioning for the quality of the encapsulation through 50 thermal cycles and 10 humidity freeze cycle. Especially the humidity freeze test could become challenging for PSCs as it combines heat and humidity with freezing temperature. These tests form the challenge, which perovskites will face in the coming years.
A likely scenario, should perovskites be commercialized, is that the IEC will develop specific standards for perovskites. These will probably be based on the established IEC 61215 standard and will then be tailored for specific perovskite properties as it was done already for CdTe, CIGS and GaAs. Since perovskites show a strong degradation under light and also show other effects like reversible degradation, it is likely that the standard for perovskites would also contain further tests to account for specific degradation causes. One possible test would be a continuous measurement at MPP for at least 100 h and a measurement after a recovery in the dark.6 Another possible test could be light cycling. These tests will then either be published as their own standard or potentially be integrated later into the IEC 61215. This procedure is already adopted for CIGS, CdTe and GaAs. These tests also showed that already established tests for silicon are usually the starting point for testing other solar cell types. Thus, this review provides the starting reference with most current IEC 61215 standard to develop stability standards for PSCs.

 	Fig. 1  Three examples of future challenges on the path of commercialization for the stability of PSCs: module, mechanical and electric field stability. Through the usage of a solar cell in a module new degradation processes can happen as hot spot damage, one of the stress tests of the IEC 61215. (A) Most significant degradation modes for crystalline silicon modules installed in the last 10 years. Bar colour indicates the severity of the degradation. Reprinted from (ref. 17) with permission from John Wiley and Sons; (B) modified infrared image of a PV module in field operation in a hot spot situation. Bottom left solar cell is shaded because of the plant. This is shown in the right picture at 30 °C which is above the average temperature of the module temperature. Reprinted from (ref. 55) with permission from IEA PVPS. Another important stability topic is mechanical stability as in the static mechanical load and hail test of the IEC 61215. (C) Measured cohesion (GC) and degradation rate as a function of the active solar cell material. It shows a correlation between mechanical integrity and long-term stability. It also shows the poor mechanical stability of PSCs. Reprinted from (ref. 38) with permission from John Wiley and Sons. Electric field stability as for example under high applied voltages and humidity as in IEC TS 62804-1. (D) Testing of conventional multicrystalline silicon modules replicas in a climate chamber at 85% relative humidity and as on the nameplate rated system voltage of (−600 V) applied to the cell circuit at 60 and 85 °C to simulate possible field degradation. Reprinted from (ref. 56) with permission from John Wiley and Sons.	 

 	Fig. 2  Full test flow for design qualification and type approval of PV modules. We note that there are five testing sequences called A, B, C, D and E. Each test is briefly described in Table S2† and important stability tests (marked in green) for PSCs are described in more detail in the main text.

 	Fig. 3  Reverse bias testing for perovskite solar cells (A) SEM image of a hole in the silver metal electrode of a PSCs which developed through excessively heating of local defects (hot spot) as shown in Fig. 1B and (C). (B and C) Infrared images of PSCs at −5 V showing two different heating behaviour, uniform (B) or locally (C). Devices with an ITO top electrode showed mostly a uniform heating and devices with metal electrodes like gold or silver generally showed a local heating. Reprinted from (ref. 21) with permission from John Wiley and Sons.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) UV-test of devices without, front, front/back coating each 5 devices. The front coating is a downshifting luminescent fluorophore. The back coating is a moisture-resistant fluoropolymeric layer. In the first three months the devices were kept in an Ar atmosphere. Afterwards, for 3 months, the devices were stored under air at 50% RH. A photograph of a front-coated device after the test is shown. (B) Outdoor ageing of 5 devices of front/back coated devices. Reprinted from (ref. 24) with permission from AAAS.	 

 	Fig. 5  Humidity-freeze cycle profile. In total 10 cycles are performed after the UV and 50 thermal cycle tests. One cycle takes roughly around one day. The minimum temperature ramp is 72 °C h−1. Copyright © 2016 IEC Geneva, Switzerland http://www.iec.ch.	 

 	Fig. 6  Thermal cycling and current profile. The cycles are repeated for 50 (Sequence C) or 200 (Sequence D) times. During the heating from −40 to 80 °C a current of 10% of the maximum power current for CIGS, CdTe and amorphous silicon. For crystalline silicon it is 100%. The heating and cooling should not be lower than 45 °C h−1. Copyright © 2016 IEC Geneva, Switzerland http://www.iec.ch.	 

 	Fig. 7  (A) Testing of two encapsulated CsFA devices at 85 °C with 85% RH without efficiency loss after 1000 h. Reprinted from (ref. 4) with permission from Nature Publishing Group. (B) Nine encapsulated CsFA devices under thermal cycling from −40 to 85 °C. All devices retained more than 90% of the initial efficiency. All devices in A and B were encapsulated with EVA, glass and an edge seal of butyl rubber. (C) Picture of the nine devices after the thermal cycling. Reproduced from (ref. 32) with permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry. (D) Schematic of different barrier layers with Ag/ITO/SnO2/PCBM (Spun or Evap)/C60/MAPbI3/NiOx/ITO; (E) Normalized efficiency of MAPbI3 devices with architecture as shown previously at 85 °C in N2 glovebox.
