    , Accepted 22nd March 2013First published on 27th March 2013AbstractA simple and scalable method was proposed to fabricate graphene papers, and the graphene sheets were prepared using conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The CVD graphene papers possess much higher electrical conductivity of 1097 S cm−1, compared with other reported carbon-related papers (graphene, carbon nanotube, etc.). The graphene papers have good flexibility with only <5% loss of electrical conductivity after mechanically bending 500 times. Such free-standing graphene papers can replace expensive Pt/FTO counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells with better energy conversion efficiency, and also be used as anodes of lithium ion batteries possessing a superior high-rate capacity and cycling performance. The highly conductive, free-standing and flexible graphene papers reveal potential in high-performance, flexible energy conversion and storage devices.
Introduction
Advanced energy conversion and storage systems such as solar cells and lithium ion batteries must have not only excellent performances, but also possess flexibility, lightweight and stability characteristics in order to satisfy various practical applications.1,2 However, the fabrication of these devices is still a major challenge due to the lack of reliable electrode materials combining electronically superior conductivity, high mechanical flexibility, and high chemical stability.
To date, chemically stable carbon based materials have been widely applied in the fields of energy storage and conversion devices.3,4 Among numerous carbon nanostructures (carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers, etc.), unique two dimensional (2D) graphene sheets, consisting of a single-layer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, have attracted tremendous attention. Their excellent properties,5–8 such as excellent electronic mobility, high specific surface area, high thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, etc., make graphene use as excellent flexible electrode materials. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO), chemically exfoliated from commercially available graphite, can be assembled into well-ordered and free-standing graphene papers.9 The graphene papers have extremely superior mechanical strength, compared with many other paper-like materials (CNTs, graphite-based papers), and show great potential applications in the fields of energy storage,10,11 biosensors,12,13 actuator,14,15 shape memory devices,12,16etc. However, the electronic conductivities of most graphene papers are as low as ∼100 S cm−1 due to graphene domain boundaries, defects and residual oxygen-containing groups.17,18 When more effective reduction strategies were used such as high temperature thermal reduction, metal-assisted reduction, etc.,19,20 further improvement of electrical conductivity was obtained, however on cost of the flexibility of graphene paper. Moreover, a large number of contact resistances between small-size graphene sheets also drastically degrade the electrical transport properties. In addition, some adhesives or surfactants have been added to improve the dispersion or binding of graphene, but these can also cause an undesirable decrease in the film conductivity. Thus, highly conductive and flexible papers are still demanded for the photovoltaic and energy storage devices.
In this paper, highly conductive and flexible graphene papers were fabricated. The paper-like material preparation involves simple filtration of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene aqueous solution without any adhesives or surfactants. The CVD graphene papers not only have outstanding mechanical flexibility, but also exhibit extremely high electrical conductivities (up to 1097 S cm−1), significantly superior to the reported graphene- and CNT-based papers. Moreover, the flexible graphene paper as a counter electrode was integrated into a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which exhibits better photovoltaic (PV) performance, compared with conventionally expensive Pt/FTO counter electrode. The graphene paper as an anode also was applied in a lithium ion battery with high capability and excellent cycling stability.
Experimental
Graphene preparation
Nickel foams (Changsha Lyrun Material Co., Ltd, 350 g m−2 in areal density, ≥95% in porosity level, 110 PPI in pore number, and 1.2 mm in thickness) were used to prepare graphene sheets by CVD method in a quartz tube, and a mixture gas of 300 sccm Ar and 50 sccm H2 was introduced to remove the residual air for 30 min. The quartz tube was heated rapidly to 1000 °C and annealed for 10 min under H2 and Ar gas flow. Then, a 10 sccm CH4 flow was introduced to grow graphene on the Ni foam surface for 10 min, and the sample was subsequently cooled down rapidly to room temperature. Finally, the sample was immersed in a 5 M HCl solution for completely etching the Ni foam, and the CVD graphene powder was obtained by filtering the solution and drying in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h.
Graphene paper fabrication
Graphene sheets were dispersed in deionized water, and the concentration was about 0.2 mg mL−1. After bath sonication for 5 min, the graphene suspension was further probe-sonicated at the power of 200 W for 30 min. Graphene paper was made by vacuum filtration of the graphene suspension using a vacuum filtration assembly and cellulose filter paper (pore size, 0.45 μm; diameter, 47 mm;), as reported previously,11,12 followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C, and peeled off from the filter. The thickness of graphene papers was controlled by adjusting the volume and/or the concentration of the graphene suspension. The graphene papers were peeled off from the filter to obtain free-standing papers. Additionally MoS2/graphene and WS2/graphene composite papers were also prepared by using the same procedure with the addition of 50% MoS2 (Alfa, No. 12213, 98% in purity) and 50% WS2 (Alfa, No. 11829, 99.8% in purity) particles, respectively.
DSSC fabrication using graphene based counter electrodes
12 μm thick transparent films of commercial TiO2 particles P25 were coated on FTO-glass substrates by using the doctor blade technique. The electrodes were sintered in dry air at 450 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the electrodes were immersed in a 0.3 mM acetonitrile and tert-butanol mixed solution (volume ration 1:1) of dye N719 overnight. Graphene, MoS2/graphene, WS2/graphene papers, and Pt sputtered on graphene and FTO were used as the counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile. Finally, the photoanode and the counter electrode were assembled and clipped in a sandwich-type arrangement with the electrolyte solution in between.
Li ion battery preparation based on graphene anode
The flexible graphene papers were used as anodes in a Li ion battery. Firstly, the graphene papers were punched a disc, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h in vacuum. The CR2016 coin cells were then assembled in an argon-filled glove box using lithium metal as the cathode, Celgard 2016 as the separator, and 1 M LiPF6 (dissolved in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate with a 1:1 volume ratio) as the electrolyte. Accordingly, the reference cells were fabricated using the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) assembled papers as anodes, where the reduced graphene oxide was prepared by using a modified Hummer's method (the fabrication procedure described in the ESI†).
Characterization and measurements
The morphologies and structures of graphene papers were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510 and Hitachi S-4800), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100F), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Raman spectrum of graphene was obtained with Raman spectroscopy with laser excitation energy of 532 nm. The electrical properties of graphene papers were measured by the Van der Pauw method with an Accent HL5500. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley Model 2440 source meter under AM 1.5 illumination. A 1000 W Oriel solar simulator was used as a light source and the power of the light was calibrated to one sun light intensity by using a NREL-calibrated Si cell (Oriel 91150). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a Pt wire as auxiliary electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode, and graphene paper as working electrode on a CHI 660 electrochemistry workstation, and the scan rate is 50 mV s−1. Charge–discharge characteristics of lithium ion batteries were tested at various rates in the voltage range of 0.001–2.5 V (vs. Li+/Li) on a CT2001A cell test instrument (LAND Electronic Co.) at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Graphene paper preparation, structure and properties
Graphene papers were fabricated by simply filtering graphene suspension through a sheet of filter membrane. During vacuum filtration, the graphene sheets were attached to the cellulose fibers, and were subsequently assembled onto the filter membrane surface to form the composite structure of graphene/filter membrane (Fig. 1a). The graphene composite membrane is mechanically stable and flexible, and can be shaped into desired structures with a knife and bent into large angles, as shown in Fig. 1b. The free-standing graphene paper can also be obtained by peeling off the filter membrane from the composite structure (Fig. 1c), and are lightweight (∼0.5 mg cm−2). It is interesting to note that the free-standing graphene paper was bent over 500 cycles without any damage to show its excellent mechanical flexibility (Fig. 1d).

In order to investigate the morphology and structure of graphene paper, SEM, TEM images and Raman spectrum were obtained. It is clear from Fig. 2a that the graphene sheets are microscale flat in the lateral dimension and thin layers with some wrinkles. Fig. S1, ESI† also shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the graphene paper. The oriented layered structure was observed from the fracture edge of the graphene paper. The graphene sheets have very large sizes of more than 50 μm (Fig. S2, ESI†), much larger than RGO (their preparation procedure described in the ESI†). The quality and layer number of graphene were further studied by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2b. The graphene sheets are few-layer structure (Fig. 2b), and a large number of TEM observations reveal that the average layer number of graphene is 8.21 The clear hexagonal spots of SAED pattern indicate well-crystallized CVD graphene (inset of Fig. 2b). Raman spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the graphene paper contains only G and 2D bands in the absence of D band in all the graphene samples, suggesting high graphene quality.22 This result is consistent with TEM characteristics.

Electrical measurements of the free-standing graphene papers with the thickness of about 25 μm were conducted using four-probe technique with silver electrodes. It clearly reveals that the graphene papers show extremely outstanding electrical property, and the electrical conductivities reach up to 1097 S cm−1 (Fig. 2c), much higher than those of graphene papers from chemical reduction (72 S cm−1),17 thermal reduction at 1200 °C (303 S cm−1)19 and Al-assisted reduction (381 S cm−1)20 of GO and mechanical milling of graphite (277 S cm−1).23 The specific electrical conductivities are listed in Fig. 2c and Table 1. In order to evaluate the mechanical stability performance of graphene papers, the graphene papers were conducted by using various radii of curvatures. The free-standing and conductive paper can be bent down to a 2 mm radius (Fig. 2d) or folded without any measurable change in electrical conductivity. Fatigue tests show that the conductive paper can be bent to a 2 mm radius for 500 times with the resistance increase of less than 5%.

Such high electrical conductivity of the graphene paper is mainly attributed to the high graphene quality and preparation procedure. Firstly, the graphene sheets directed by 3D Ni foam template are high crystalline and have a perfect crystal structure. The graphene sheets greatly reduces the possibility of scattering electrons inside graphene, and their large-size can also significantly eliminate the contact resistance between graphene sheets. Furthermore, the simple fabrication process forms self-assembling ordered graphene papers without extra any adhesives or surfactants. Therefore, the electrical properties of graphene papers are significantly superior to assembled papers from graphene, CNT, activated carbon, graphite and other carbon-based materials reported previously.17,24,25 Moreover, the excellent mechanical flexibility of graphene papers is likely due to the combined effect of the intrinsic flexibility of individual large size graphene sheets and preparation procedure. Graphene is the strongest material in nature, and graphene sheets can be assembled into layer by layer structure using vacuum filtration method. The large size of graphene sheets makes them overlap as much as possible, which makes graphene papers retain good flexibility. For comparison, using the same preparation method, the free-standing films of WRC graphene26 and RGO cannot maintain the mechanical stability. Thus, the outstanding electrical property, flexibility and free-standing characterization of the graphene papers provide them with potential applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, and photovoltaic devices, etc.
Graphene papers as the counter electrodes of DSSCs
In order to demonstrate the applications of highly conductive and flexible graphene papers in DSSCs, the prototype device containing a free-standing graphene based counter electrode, a dye-sensitized porous TiO2 photoanode and electrolyte between the two electrodes was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 3a. The reference device was prepared by using widely-used Pt/FTO counter electrode in DSSC. This study is mainly based on the substitution of expensive FTO and noble metal Pt (30–50% cost in DSSCs) with our highly conductive papers. Fig. 3b illustrates the J–V curves of the DSSCs based on Pt/graphene, graphene, MoS2/graphene and WS2/graphene counter electrodes, respectively. Sheet resistances (Rs), open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), fill factors (FF), and power conversion efficiencies (PCE, η) for DSSCs with different counter electrodes are listed in Table 2. The performance of the DSSC with bare graphene paper (sheet resistance Rs = 0.3 Ω sq−1, electrical conductivity σ = 1097 S cm−1) shows a Jsc of 12.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.54 V, a FF of 31.6%, and an overall PCE of 2.16%.

The DSSC fabricated from bare graphene counter electrode shows low FF and poor cell efficiency due to the low catalytic capability of CVD graphene to the redox of electrolyte, which is consistent with our previous results.27 Thus, the necessity of introducing an effective catalyst onto the graphene paper is appreciated. The Pt/graphene counter electrode exhibits a high efficiency of 6.09%, and the corresponding Jsc, Voc and FF are 13.3 mA cm−2, 0.70 V and 65.9%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b. The cell efficiency of Pt/graphene is much higher than that of Pt/FTO (Voc = 0.71 V, Jsc = 13.0 mA cm−2, FF = 62.0%, η = 5.76%). Moreover, Pt, as a catalyst material, is a scarce resource and is very expensive. Thus, the composites of graphene/layered sulfide have been considered as potential candidates for replacing Pt catalyst in the counter electrode due to their large surface area, highly electrical conductivity, and good catalytic activity.28,29MS2/graphene (M = Mo, W) papers were prepared by filtering 50 wt% sulfide particles and graphene suspension. The MS2 particles were uniformly dispersed between graphene sheets (Fig. S4, ESI†), and their sheet resistances are 0.43 Ω sq−1 (MoS2) and 0.48 Ω sq−1 (WS2), comparable to that of the bare graphene paper. The corresponding DSSC efficiencies are 4.41% and 4.37%, respectively.
In order to further investigate the catalyst activity of Pt/FTO, graphene, Pt/graphene, and MS2/graphene (M = Mo, W) counter electrodes, the CV curves were performed under I−/I3− electrochemical system, as shown in Fig. 3c. These counter electrodes exhibit different electrochemical activity towards I−/I3− redox reaction. No significant current was observed at the potential range from 0.5 V to 1.0 V for bare graphene electrode due to the poor catalytic activity of the electrode, consistent with the DSSC performance. For Pt/FTO and Pt/graphene counter electrodes, their CV curves possess two typical pairs of redox peaks. The left peaks are corresponding to the redox reaction between I− and I3−, and the right ones are the reaction between I3− and I2−.30 Although the cathodic current density of Pt/graphene electrode is comparable to Pt/FTO, the cathodic peak potentials are more positive than that of Pt/FTO to reveal a lower overpotential for reduction of I3− to I−. Thus, the graphene papers effectively replaced FTO in the counter electrode with better cell efficiency. The improved cell efficiency is mainly attributed to highly electrical conductivity of graphene papers and synergistic catalytic ability of graphene and Pt. Moreover, CV profiles from MS2/graphene (M = Mo, W) counter electrodes have no distinct two pair of redox peaks, compared with Pt/FTO and Pt/graphene electrodes, indicating that the MS2/graphene counter electrodes exhibit relatively lower catalyst activity towards I−/I3− redox reaction. Accordingly, the corresponding efficiencies are slightly lower than those of Pt/FTO and Pt/graphene counter electrodes, but still reach up to 77% and 76% of that with a Pt/FTO electrode. Thus, in combination with good flexibility of graphene, the FTO-free and Pt-free disulfide/graphene counter electrodes have potential for use in low-cost and flexible DSSCs.
Graphene papers as the anodes of lithium ion batteries
Graphene has been expected to be an efficient anode material in the lithium ion batteries, but there are only very few investigations reported due to very poor reversibility.31–33 Very recently, the RGO paper anode was first reported to possess the initial discharge capacity of 680 mA h g−1, but the capacity dramatically dropped to only 84 mA h g−1 only at the second cycle.31 The large irreversible capacity mainly results from the imperfectly-stacked (stack faults) RGO sheets to create enormous barriers for lithium ion diffusion. Of course, the graphite oxide (GO) sheets have too many vertical extended atoms or clusters out of the graphene plane, which prevent the reduced GO sheets becoming tightly packed paper. As better anode materials, graphite and commercial hard carbon have short lithium diffusion distance and enormous diffusion pathways, and exhibit a high capacity (more than 372 mA h g−1) and a good ability for lithium insertion/desertion.34,35 This is because that graphite and hard carbon have good crystal structure and the relatively tight stacking of single-layer graphene-like sheets, and can eventually form more stable intercalation/de-intercalation of lithium process, compared with the RGO. Therefore, it is expected that high-quality, few-layer graphene sheets with a large surface area can act as an excellent anode in lithium ion batteries.
In this work, the few-layer CVD graphene sheets without any vertically extended atoms have nearly perfect crystal structure, and the assembled graphene papers exhibit outstanding electrical properties. The more tightly packed graphene sheets are favorable for rapid transport and collection of both electron and lithium ion. In order to verify CVD graphene paper to be an efficient anode in Li-ion battery, the lithium storage performance was investigated. The discharge/charge profile of the graphene paper at a current density of 50.0 mA g−1 is shown in Fig. 4a. The first discharge capacity of the graphene paper is as high as 1027.8 mAh g−1. With the increase of discharge/charge time, the capacity shows a decrease trend from 849 mAh g−1 at the second discharge to 701 mAh g−1 at the tenth discharge. Eventually, the stable discharge capacity of 630 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 was achieved after 40 discharge/charge cycles, much higher than the reported data for RGO paper (∼362 mAh g−1) (Fig. 4b) and previously reported carbon black, CNTs, RGO and CNTs/RGO papers.31,36–38

(b) Specific capacity comparison of CVD graphene and RGO papers at a current density of 50 mA g−1. (c) The rate performance of graphene paper at different current densities. 
The rate performance of the graphene paper was further investigated. Fig. 4c presents the cycle performance of graphene papers at different current densities of 50 mA g−1, 200 mA g−1, and 500 mA g−1. The graphene paper has high specific capacities of 701 mAh g−1 (50 mA g−1) and 413 mAh g−1 (200 mA g−1), respectively. At the current density of 500 mA g−1, the reversible capacity was 191 mAh g−1, and the capacity remained about 160 mAh g−1 after 100 discharge/charge cycles (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating a good rate performance and excellent electrochemical stability. The reversibility is demonstrated that the capacity of 659 mAh g−1 was reached again once the current density was returned to 50 mA g−1.
Compared with the RGO paper with enormous defects, CVD graphene paper exhibits a large capability and excellent cycling stability under fast charge/discharge conditions, which is attributed to several possible reasons. Firstly, CVD graphene sheets prepared at a high temperature of 1000 °C have very good crystal quality, significantly superior to RGO. The graphene sheets have few-layer structure, and relatively tight stacking between graphene layers is similar to graphite. Secondly, the thicknesses of graphene sheets generally are less than 3 nm (according to the average layer number of graphene sheets), far lower than that of graphite flakes. Obviously, the graphene sheets have much larger surface area, compared with conventional graphite flakes, to provide more lithium insertion active sites. Moreover, when the graphene sheets were assembled into graphene papers, many spaces formed between graphene sheets, which are also favorable to the intercalation/de-intercalation of lithium ion. Eventually, the high-quality graphene exhibits a large reversible capacity, which is much higher than those of RGO, even graphite and hard carbon. In addition, graphene papers have outstanding electrical properties, resulting in excellent high-rate charge/discharge performances. Therefore, the encouraging results may open up an avenue for graphene as an anode material in lithium ion batteries.
The highly conductive graphene papers not only are used as an active anode material for the insertion and exaction of lithium ion, but also can act as stable current collectors directly integrated in lithium ion battery for the substitution of conventional metal foils. The weight of the graphene collector (0.5 mg cm−2) can be largely reduced by over 80% compared with the metal collectors, mainly copper (10 mg cm−2) and aluminum (5 mg cm−2). The graphene papers can greatly increase energy density of lithium ion batteries. Therefore, the highly conductive graphene papers show the potential in flexible lithium ion batteries with high reversible capacity, good cycle performance, and high-rate discharge/charge capability.
Conclusions
Free-standing and flexible graphene papers were prepared by the simple filtration of high quality CVD graphene aqueous solution. The as-prepared graphene papers have a highly electrical conductivity (1097 S cm−1), are lightweight (0.5 mg cm−2) and have good flexibility, superior to other reported graphene, CNT-based papers. As the counter electrodes of DSSCs, the Pt/graphene counter electrode show better performance, compared with the Pt/FTO counter electrode, and the MoS2/graphene and WS2/graphene papers, as the low cost FTO-free and Pt-free counter electrodes, exhibits the efficiencies of 4.41% and 4.37%, respectively. The graphene paper was also employed in a lithium ion battery as an integrated electrode combining both active component and current collector, and presents good high-rate capability and cycling performance. Due to its excellent electrical conductivity, high thermal and chemical stability, and desirable flexibility, the graphene paper may find applications in high-performance, flexible energy conversion and storage devices.
