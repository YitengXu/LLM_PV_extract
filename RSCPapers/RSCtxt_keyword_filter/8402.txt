The effect of the proportion of CNTs to graphene on the dye-adsorption ability of bonding layers was investigated and the optimal proportion of 2:1 provided a greatest degree of dye absorption. The DSSC efficiencies firstly increased and then decreased with increasing amount of CNT–G hybrid. The optimized DSSC efficiency of 6.17% was achieved at a suitable concentration (0.1 wt%) of CNT–G, which is due to a balance between electron transport and light harvesting in the photoanode.
1. Introduction
Since their initial introduction by Grätzel et al., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attracting interest from academics and practitioners alike.1 Despite 12.3% solar conversion efficiency already achieved with these cells, any further improvement in performance would provide considerate benefits.2–4 In recent years, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as TiO2 NTAs have received particular attention as photoanodes of DSSCs due to their direct and fast transport pathway for carriers.5–9
Compared to either hydrothermal or template approaches, the anodic oxidation is more convenient and simpler to obtain uniform and orderly arranged TiO2 NTs.10 As far as we know, Grimes and his coworkers reported the fabrication of a self-assembled TiO2 NTs membrane by anodic oxidation of Ti foil in HF-containing acidic electrolyte for the first time.11 Later, ultra-long TiO2 NTs have been synthesized after a systematic optimization of the anodization procedure.12 However, the wider applications of TiO2 NTAs in DSSCs are restricted due to both the opaque substrates and a poor electric contact between the membrane and the substrate.13 Thus, a few attempts have been tried to obtain the full transparent photoanodes based on the TiO2 NTAs.14–18 Additionally, in order to fix the free-standing TiO2 NTA membranes, a blocking layer consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was usually deposited onto the transparent conductive substrates as the bonding layers.19 In our previous report, a novel 3-layer TiO2 NP/NT/NP photoanode were fabricated, which exhibited a high efficiency of ∼7.76%.20 However, further improvement in DSSC efficiency is limited by the electron transferring in the TiO2 NPs layers.
Recently, a few studies have demonstrated that the incorporation of carbon materials might facilitate electron transfer process in mesoporous TiO2 films.21–23 Yang et al. introduced graphene into a TiO2 matrix as a 2-D bridge for the photoanode of DSSCs and the cell performance was enhanced.24 In a previous study, we also reported that the introduction of 1-D CNTs into a TiO2 matrix can improve the performance of the cell.25 CNTs not only benefit from the 1D structure that provides fast electron transport pathway, their highly conductive character also plays a critical role in DSSCs. Lately, a 3-D hybrid material was reported comprising pristine CNTs (1-D) and chemically converted graphene (2-D).26–28 In this system, the combined use of these two materials in the matrix resulted in a twin effect influencing both the electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of the photoanode. Nevertheless, there were still few reports on the carbon nanotube–graphene–TiO2 (CNT–G–TiO2) nanocomposite films as the bonding layers in TiO2-nanotube-based DSSCs. In this study, we succeeded in preparation of CNT–G–TiO2 bonding layers and investigated the effect of CNT–G contents on the total performance of DSSCs.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Preparation of free-standing NTAs
TiO2 NTAs were obtained via an optimized three-step anodic oxidation process, according to our previous research.20 Typically, a Ti foil was dipped into an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.3 wt% ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and 2 vol% H2O and a constant voltage of 60 V was applied versus a Pt counter electrode for 1 h. Afterwards, the samples were ultrasonically washed with deionized water to remove the precipitates on the NT surface, followed by a second anodization process for 3 h under the same conditions with the first anodization. Further, the obtained samples were washed ultrasonically again in the methanol and annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in ambience. During the third anodization process, the duration was set up as 1 h under the same conditions as the first anodization. Finally, the samples were immersed in 10% H2O2 aqueous solution in order to detach the NTAs membrane from Ti substrate.
2.2. Fabrication of the DSSCs
Prior to the assembly of DSSCs, the CNTs with diameters of 10–20 nm and purity of >95% (Shenzhen Nanotech., China) were treated by H2SO4/HNO3 solutions as the report by Chen et al.29 Graphene nanoplatelets, grade 3, were purchased from The Sixth Element, Inc. (China).
CNTs and graphene were suspended in ethanol (10 mL) with various ratios of CNTs to graphene (1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1) and then sonicated for 1 h. The CNT–G–TiO2 pastes were prepared by adding the above suspension into the TiO2 NPs pastes (size about 10 nm, Wuhan Geao) in which the CNT–G concentrations varied from 0 to 0.15 wt% with the interval of 0.05. Using the same method, CNT–TiO2, G–TiO2 pastes and the pure were then printed on the FTO glass substrates (15 Ω □−1, Dalian Hepta Chroma) by spin-coating as bonding layers. The film thickness was controlled by 3 M adhesive tape (Magic, USA). The trimmed TiO2 NTAs membranes (5 × 5 mm2) were transferred onto the bonding layers and then annealed at 450 °C for 1 h. The above prepared samples were then immersed into a 3 mM ethanol solution of N719 (Dalian Hepta Chroma) for 24 h. Finally, the dye-adsorbed anodes and Pt-coated counter electrodes were stacked and sealed with 60 μm thick thermal-plastic Surlyn (DHS-SN1760) spacer at 110 °C for 15 s. An iodide-based liquid electrolyte (0.6 M DMPII, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiI in MPN, Dalian Hepta Chroma) was injected into the devices by capillary force.
2.3. Characterization and measurements
The morphology and structure of electrode materials were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800). UV-vis adsorption spectroscopy (UV-vis, Cary 300) were used to study the dye adsorption density and the sunlight absorbance of the bonding layers. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator (Beijing Trusttech). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was made under illumination by using an electrochemical test station (CHI660D).
3. Results and discussion
Scheme 1 shows the novel structure of CNT–G–TiO2 NP/TiO2 NT bilayer photoanode. Several reports have shown that TiO2 particles can be dispersed effectively through the incorporation of carbon materials into the TiO2 matrix, yielding a coarse surface and a highly porous morphology.30–32 Here, we discuss the influence of TiO2 matrices on dye adsorption and microstructural morphology following the incorporation of CNTs, graphene, and CNT–graphene hybrid materials into the matrix. As we all know, π-stacking interactions between the π-conjugated aromatic surface of the graphene and the wall of the CNTs binds the two components. The acid–CNTs distributing on the graphene surface could generate a larger anchoring surface area for TiO2, thereby enhancing the quantity of dye that could be adsorbed. The 3-D structure of the hybrid material leads to more substantial pores than adding pristine CNTs (1-D) and graphene (2-D), as shown in Scheme 2, which is also confirmed by the SEM images in Fig. 1. Compared to the dense film using CNTs or graphene individually, the 3-D structure of the CNT–G hybrid material leads to a film with rough, coarse and porous morphology, which could improve their ability to adsorb dye. Scheme 2 shows the novel structure of CNT–G–TiO2 NP/TiO2 NT bilayer photoanode.

UV-vis spectra of N719 dye solutions formed by desorption of dye from composite films using a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 2. When compared with the pristine TiO2 film, it is evident that a greater quantity of dye was adsorbed by the composite films, which was caused by the particular morphology of the CNT–G hybrid material. In general, graphene presents much larger surface area than CNTs. Ideally, the increase of graphene content in CNT–G hybrids could provide more loading sites for TiO2 particles which is benefit for dye adsorption in the film. However, as the increase of graphene content, graphene layers are easily aggregated together and the effective surface area will decrease. In fact, CNTs disturbing on graphene layers play a key role in relaxing graphene aggregation as its good mechanical properties. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2, CNT–G hybrid exhibiting the greatest level of dye adsorption was achieved at a ratio of 2:1. For this reason, we used a hybrid material with a ratio of 2:1 to prepare composite materials with TiO2 particles for further investigation.

Fig. 3a and b shows the side-view FESEM image of TiO2 NTA membrane and CNT–G–TiO2 NPs/TiO2 NTs electrode respectively. It is found that the membrane is composed of a large number of uniform, smooth, aligned, and densely packed TiO2 NTs with the diameters of ∼100 nm, and no micro-cracks are observed. A clear, abrupt interface is observed between the layers, suggesting that an expected bilayer structure is obtained.

Fig. 4 displays the J–V curves of DSSCs based on CNT–G–TiO2 NPs/TiO2 NTs bilayer structure photoanodes with different hybrid carbon material contents, guaranteeing the ratio of CNTs to graphene is 2:1. Meanwhile, the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, including short-current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (η). As is seen, the η value of DSSCs firstly increases and then decreases with increase of the CNT–G content. The highest power conversion efficiency, ∼6.17%, is obtained at 0.1 wt%, which is about 27% higher than those made with the pure TiO2 photoanodes. Carbon materials in the linking layer exhibit both positive and negative influence on photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. On the one hand, the excellent electron conductivity of CNT–G hybrid could accelerate electron transfer from TiO2 NTs to the FTO conductive substrate. The recombination between photo-induced electron and I3− in electrolyte is reduced at the same time. It is the reason that both Jsc and Voc values of DSSCs increase as the addition of carbon materials. On the other hand, sunlight is seriously absorbed when it penetrates the films containing carbon materials. As shown in Fig. 5, the absorbance intensity of the films with CNT–G hybrids is higher than that of pure TiO2 over the whole range. The higher the content of carbon material exist in composites, the less dye molecules absorb sunlight in DSSCs. Therefore, the Jsc and η decrease as the carbon content reach to 0.15%.

To gain insight into the electrochemical effect of CNT–G hybrid introduction in the binding layer, EIS of corresponding DSSCs measured at frequencies ranging from 10−2 to 105 Hz are illustrated in Fig. 6. The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs mainly consist of two semicircles, which are related to charge transfer process at the Pt/electrolyte and electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interfaces.33 Compared to the cells fabricated with the pure TiO2 photoanode, the semicircles (R3) at low frequency of DSSCs containing CNT–G–TiO2 photoanodes are much smaller (the fitting results are shown in Table 1). It indicates that CNT–G hybrid material can enhance the electron electrical conductivity and charge mobility process. The smallest value of R3 is achieved at a content of 0.1 wt%, which is consistent to the J–V measurement results. However, when the content was further increased, the R3 value increases, leading to a lower η. The behavior might be induced by the double functions of carbon materials in the binding layer. CNT–G hybrids not only improve the electron transfer process in photoanode, but they also provide reaction sites for I3− reduction on the carbon/electrolyte interface which is harmful for electron collection in photoanode. In detail, when carbon content is low in the binding layer (0.05 and 0.1), electroconductivity enhancement are dominant. However, carbon content reaches further to 0.15, the influence of electron recombination induced by carbon materials on photoanode are not ignorable.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, DSSCs based on the novel CNT–G–TiO2 NPs/TiO2 NTs bilayer structure photoanodes were fabricated. SEM images and observations of dye absorption of the CNT–G hybrid material indicate that both the surface morphology and distribution of pores can be improved through the incorporation of structured CNTs and graphene (2:1). The photoelectric properties of DSSCs showed that incorporation of 0.1 wt% CNT–G hybrid material into the TiO2 pastes improved the total solar cell efficiency by 38% due to the enhanced quantity of absorbed dye and electron transport rate. However, content of CNT–G hybrid material loading beyond the optimal concentration can cause the decrease of the efficiency due to the light shielding and electron recombination enhancement. The results provide an effective technique to improve electron transfer process in photoanode for DSSCs.
