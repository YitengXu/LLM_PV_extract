    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 5th June 2019AbstractLead halide perovskites are promising optoelectronic materials due to their unique properties such as strong light absorption, high carrier mobility, easily tunable bandgap, and compatibility with solution processable techniques. Most of the perovskite photodetectors are made of polycrystalline films, which are inferior due to large defective grain boundaries with respect to their single-crystalline (SC) counterparts. We have successfully grown SC lead halide perovskite wafers as large as 10 mm by combining the space-confined growth and seed-induced crystallization methods. In contrast, the single space-confined growth method only produces multiple SCs with sizes smaller than 3 mm. Due to the absence of grain-boundaries, the trap density of the prepared large SC perovskite wafer is only 2.36 × 1010 cm−3, much lower than that of polycrystalline thin films. The photodetectors based on the SC perovskite wafer with excellent crystalline quality show a light on/off current ratio of 4.3 × 103, a response time of 770 μs, and a linear dynamic range of 119 dB. At the lowest detectable illumination power density of 80 nW cm−2, the prepared photodetector shows the highest external quantum efficiency, responsivity and detectivity of 904%, 3.87 A W−1, and 1.77 × 1013 Jones, respectively. Moreover, a natural SC perovskite device without any modification possesses good stability with its photocurrent maintained above 80% of its original value after 30 days of storage in air. The results indicate that high-performance photodetectors based on SC perovskite wafers may become competitive in future semiconductor information applications.
Introduction
Photodetectors which capture light signals and instantaneously convert them into electric signals are widely applied in many fields such as video cameras, analytical spectrometers, medical imaging, light control, environmental monitoring and so on.1–5 Various types of semiconductors including both inorganic materials (e.g., Si, InGaAs, ZnO) and organic materials have been applied in photodetectors.6–10 As we know, organic semiconductors with distinctive advantages like easily tunable bandgaps and compatibility with solution processable techniques, show a relatively lower carrier mobility with respect to their inorganic counterparts, limiting their applications in semiconductor optoelectronic devices. Recently, lead halide perovskites, as the hybrid of organic groups and inorganic ions containing all the advantages of both organic and inorganic semiconductors, have been proposed for functional components like solar cells, light emitting diodes, photodetectors, lasers, etc.11–19 So far, polycrystalline perovskite films have shown a great success in solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency exceeding 23%.20 However, the inevitable defective grain boundaries in polycrystalline films can deteriorate the device performance by causing a higher carrier recombination loss.21 In contrast, single-crystalline (SC) perovskites can decrease the defective grain boundaries thereby greatly reducing the trap density due to the defective states, resulting in higher carrier mobility, longer carrier lifetime, and longer diffusion length.22–28 These characteristics make the SC perovskites ideal for realizing photodetection which is simultaneously sensitive and fast.
Preparation of SC perovskites is the first key step for obtaining high performance photodetectors. Bulk SC perovskites have been prepared using liquid growth strategies including cooling crystallization,22,29–31 antisolvent diffusion assisted crystallization,32–37 and inverse temperature crystallization.38–42 With respect to large bulk crystals, SC perovskite films or wafers with a small thickness value and planar facets which enable easier mass integration with electronic and optical devices were also developed.38,43 Later, the growth methods resorting to the space-confined means and/or surface-modification processes24,26,44–48 were also exploited for yielding high quality planar SC perovskites, which show the advantages of easily manipulation, free of surface contamination, and good compatibility with device fabrication, compared with the mechanical cutting technique.38,49,50 For example, in 2016, the Liu group successfully achieved thickness-tunable SC perovskite wafers (from ∼mm to 150 μm thickness) by confining the crystal growth using two thin glass slides with spacers.24 To enable the crystal growth using a constant fresh solution, the dynamic flow was achieved using a peristaltic pump during the growth process. Using the same strategy, the Kuang group also obtained SC perovskite films, based on which they developed solar cells and narrowband photodetectors.45 By applying pressure, the Hu and Ma groups further shrunk the thickness of the planar SC perovskites down to the nanometer scale.44,51
In this work, we have successfully developed SC lead halide perovskite wafers by combining the space-confined growth44 and seed-induced crystallization methods.38 In the beginning, we tried the single space-confined growth process for growing SC perovskite wafers. To reduce the complexity of the apparatus, the dynamic flow control system24 was not used, and only small wafers were produced. However, when the advance-synthesized small perovskite wafer was added into the precursor solution as the seed, a 10 mm large perovskite wafer was produced. The trap state density of the prepared large SC perovskite wafer was only 2.36 × 1010 cm−3, much lower than that of the reported polycrystalline thin films. On top of the perovskite wafer, patched electrodes comprised of gold and aluminum with a side length of 220 μm and a gap width of 20 μm were evaporated for making stable photoconductive type photodetectors. The device showed a dark current of 6.6 pA, five orders lower than that reported in ref. 24, correspondingly the light on/off current ratio was elevated from 56 to 4.3 × 103 under 1 V bias. Further characterization of the prepared photodetector was also carried out. Our work contributes to the development of high performance integrated photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.
Fabrication and characterization methods
The space-confined growth method and the seed-induced crystallization method are simultaneously utilized to grow large SC MAPbI3 perovskite wafers as shown in Fig. 1. Two thin glass slides aligned in parallel were separated by spacers to confine the crystal growth in the gap. The spacers were made of ∼170 μm thick glass strips, which defined the thickness of the SC MAPbI3 wafer. The assembled glass apparatus was immersed in the precursor solution made of CH3NH3I and PbI2 dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (GBL), which was then placed on a heater 100 °C for ∼24 hours as shown in Fig. 1(a). This step was terminated when regular hexagonal SCs with a side length of ∼1–2 mm appeared in that confined space, one of which was harvested as the seed crystal for growing large wafer. Next, the seed crystal was sandwiched in the glass apparatus identical to that producing the seed and then immersed in a fresh precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Then, after ∼24 hours, a large SC MAPbI3 wafer with a regular shape and a lateral dimension of 10 mm was produced, as shown in Fig. 1(c). For comparison, the seed crystal was left in the solution of Fig. 1(a) for another ∼24 hours. In order to prevent further damage to the surface of the SC wafer by the residual precursor solution, the large SC MAPbI3 wafer was quickly soaked in anhydrous diethyl ether for half an hour and then was dried in a vacuum oven. It is mentioned that if the large SC wafer is placed in the fresh precursor solution again, it can grow larger in accordance with the findings of bulk MAPbI3 crystals.38

(d) The schematic illustration of the fabricated photodetectors based on the as-grown perovskite wafer during electrical measurements. Inset: Loading the mask made of a Cu square mesh on the wafer for preparing photodetector arrays. 
With the obtained SC MAPbI3 wafer, photoconductive type photodetector arrays were fabricated by successively depositing, on the wafer surface, 50 nm thick Au and 200 nm thick Al, as the electrodes, in a thermal evaporator system. The evaporation pressure was about 5 × 10−4 Pa, and the evaporation rate of both the Au and Al films was 1 Å s−1. Here, a copper square mesh with a hole and bar widths of 220 μm and 20 μm, respectively, was loaded on the MAPbI3 wafer as the electrode mask, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(d). During electrical measurements, two neighbouring metal squares are applied with probes as shown in the schematic illustration of Fig. 1(d). Correspondingly, the effective illumination area of each device is about 4.4 × 10−5 cm2. In order to measure the trap state density of the SC wafer, Au electrodes of 50 nm thickness were evaporated on both sides of the MAPbI3 SC wafer for realizing the hole-only device.
The thickness of the prepared SC MAPbI3 wafer was measured using an optical microscope (Nikon, LV-150). The absorption spectra of SC MAPbI3 wafers were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature were recorded using a home-built fluorescence spectrophotometer system.52 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of the SC MAPbI3 wafer was measured using a diffractometer (Hao Yuan Instrument, DX-2700) in the θ–θ geometry to confirm the composition. The current–voltage (I–V) and transient photo response characteristics of the MAPbI3 photodetectors in the dark and under illumination were measured using a semiconductor analyzer (Agilent B1500). For the transient response and LDR measurements, the light source was supplied using a collimated LED (505 nm, Thorlabs) and laser (532 nm, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech. Co., Ltd), respectively, with the light intensities characterized using a power meter (Ophir NOVA II). For the wavelength dependent photo response measurement, a xenon lamp (ZOLIX GLORIA-X150A) combined with a monochromator (ZOLIX 0mni-λ 3005) was utilized. During I–V measurements, all MAPbI3 photodetector devices and the hole-only device were placed on a probe station which is placed in a shield box (PRCBE, mini) with the probes approaching the electrodes under a microscope. The hole-only device sandwiched between two thick glasses stands vertically on the station with the probes approaching the electrodes as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
From the I–V measurement results, the light on/off current ratio (Il/Id), responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE), and detectivity (D*) of photodetectors can be derived by the following equations. (1) (2) (3)Here, Jl is the current density under light illumination, Jd is the dark current density, and Pin is the illumination power density. h is the Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, and e is the electron charge.
Results and discussions

Fig. 2(a) shows the photo of the selected seed with a dimension of 1 or 2 mm harvested at the end of the step as shown in Fig. 1(a), which was sandwiched between two glass slides to induce the growth of the large SC perovskite wafer in the fresh precursor solution. The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the cross sectional view of the apparatus. After the completion of growth, the small seed turned into a large SC perovskite wafer with a lateral dimension of ∼10 mm as shown in Fig. 2(b). The inset of Fig. 2(b) shows the corresponding cross sectional view which shows that the large SC perovskite wafer is confined in-between the two glass slides. It is noted that, besides the product of interest, some bulk perovskite particles due to inhomogeneous nucleation formed at structural inhomogeneities53 were also harvested surrounding the glass slides, which are not favorable for the device integration. For device fabrication, the large thin wafer was taken out (Fig. S2, ESI†), leaving the small crystals inside the beaker. As can be seen from the microscopic image of Fig. 2(c), the prepared SC perovskite wafer has flat surfaces with a typical thickness of ∼170 μm, close to the thickness of the reported thinnest wafer in ref. 24. Instead, the control experiment using only the space-confined growth method does not yield any large SC perovskite wafer. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the seed crystal, left in the precursor solution, didn’t grow up.

Fig. 3(a) shows the absorption spectrum of the prepared large SC MAPbI3 wafer which covers a wavelength range from 300 nm to 900 nm. Compared to the microcrystalline MAPbI3 films which show an absorption edge at ∼800 nm,54,55 the prepared SC MAPbI3 wafer shows a much broader absorption band with the onset redshifted to ∼867 nm, calculated by the absorption versus energy plot as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). This indicates that the SC MAPbI3 shows a smaller bandgap than its microcrystalline counterparts. This result is in good agreement with the literature.24 The steady-state PL spectrum of the SC MAPbI3 wafer excited using a 325 nm laser is shown in Fig. 3(b), with the emission peak located at 780 nm and a FWHM of 41 nm, in accordance with the result shown in ref. 56. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results to probe the crystalline quality and the structural information of the as-grown SC MAPbI3 wafer are shown in Fig. 3(c). It is found that there are only two sharp diffraction peaks locating at the crystal planes of [200] and [400], indicating a preferable orientation along the [100] direction. From the rocking curve shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c), the FWHM of the [200] diffraction peak was determined to be only 0.05°, reflecting that the wafer is highly single crystalline in quality.24 In order to measure the trap state density of the SC wafer, the single hole device with selected hole injection was prepared as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(d), and its space-charge-limited current under different biases was studied in darkness as shown in Fig. 3(d). At low bias, an ohmic contact was observed. At the trap-filled limit voltage VTFL, its I–V characteristic curve begins to rise sharply. The value of VTFL can be determined from the trap state density:57 (4)where d is the thickness of the SC wafer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the MAPbI3 wafer.58 The density of trap states for the as-grown large MAPbI3 wafer is calculated to be only 2.36 × 1010 cm−3, being well consistent with the previous reports.22

The as-grown large SC perovskite wafer with such a lower trap state density can be an attractive candidate in optoelectronic applications. In this work, a planar metal–semiconductor–metal type photodetector array with an electrode picture as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) was developed based on the prepared SC wafer. Firstly, the I–V curves at different light intensities as well as that under dark were measured at 505 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(a). It shows that, with an increase in the power density of the incident light, the photocurrent increases nonlinearly (the rising rate of photocurrent increases first and then decreases), indicating a saturation effect of photocurrent due to the Schottky contact formed between SC MAPbI3 and Au electrodes.59 The higher the power density of light is, the greater the light on/off current ratio is. From the logarithmic I–V curves shown in Fig. 4(b), it is clearly observed that, at a bias of 1 V, the dark current is only 6.6 pA owing to the superior crystalline property of the as-grown SC MAPbI3 wafer as indicated by a trap state density of 2.36 × 1010 cm−3. The corresponding photocurrent at Pin = 10.2 mW cm−2 is as high as 28.6 nA, providing a light on/off current ratio of ∼4.3 × 103. It is noted that, compared with the device shown in the literature24 with a relatively large effective illumination area which shows a dark current of 0.8 μA and a light on/off current ratio of ∼56 under a 515 nm LED laser illumination of 24.4 mW cm−2 at 1 V bias, our device with a shrunken effective area has a three order lower dark current, and the light on/off current ratio is 77 times greater.

(e) Stability test with the photodetector stored in air at a temperature of 19 °C and a humidity of 10%. (f) Wavelength-dependent photocurrent illuminated with monochromatic light from a Xe lamp. 
The transient photocurrent response of the SC MAPbI3 based photodetector was evaluated at 1 V bias under 505 nm, 10.2 mW cm−2 illumination as shown in Fig. 4(c). It is seen that the photodetector shows a stable step response when the light is on and off. Here, the rise time (Trise) and the fall time (Tfall), which are defined as the time for the photocurrent to rise from 10% to 90% (fall from 90% to 10%) during the on and off cycles under light illumination, are measured to be 350 μs and 420 μs, respectively. The sum of the rise time and the fall time, which is counted as the response time, equals to 770 μs. As was known, the SC perovskites are much stable than their microcrystalline or polycrystalline counterparts.60 Thus we also tested the stability of the fabricated photodetector. The sample was stored in air at a temperature of 19 °C and a humidity of 10% with the dark current and photocurrent being tested every 5 days under 505 nm, 10.2 mW cm−2 illumination. It is shown in Fig. 4(e) that in 30 days, the dark current changed negligibly while the photocurrent retained above 80% of its original value. This reveals a good stability of the natural SC perovskite device without any modification. In contrast, the photodetectors prepared on the polycrystalline thin film show a higher dark current, a slower response speed and a worse stability as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

Fig. 4(f) shows the spectral photoresponse measured using a 150 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator, of which the illuminations have a power density of ∼μW cm−2 (Fig. S5, ESI†). It is found that our device exhibits a broadband detection ability from 300 nm to 850 nm due to its broadband absorption property. Here, the photo current at 500 nm with a power intensity of 42.4 μW cm−2 is in the order of 10−10 A, in agreement with the LDR measurements shown in Fig. 5(a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrents measured under 1 V bias at different illumination power densities (532 nm). (b–d) Represent the corresponding EQE, R, and D* values at different illumination power densities. 
Most applications require photodetectors with the ability to detect the incident light with the power density varied over a wide range. So we also characterized the LDR of the photodetector. Specifically, the LDR is the linear change in photocurrent as a function of incident light intensity over a range. The definition of LDR is shown in eqn (5).25 (5)where Psat and Plow represent the highest and lowest illumination power densities, respectively. Out of this range, the photocurrent begins to deviate from the linear region, thus the light signal cannot be accurately detected. Here, we used a 532 nm laser to characterize the LDR at a bias of 1 V. The power dependent photocurrent curve is shown in Fig. 5(a), with Psat = 74 mW cm−2 and Plow = 80 nW cm−2, with the LDR which was evaluated to be 119 dB. The EQE, R, and D* of the SC MAPbI3 photodetector are also derived as shown in Fig. 5(b–d), respectively. It is clearly witnessed that the EQE, R, and D* values increase with a decrease in the power density of the incident light, consistent with the results in the literatures.24,59 At the lowest detectable illumination power density of 80 nW cm−2, the highest EQE, R, and D* values are obtained to be 904%, 3.87 A W−1, and 1.77 × 1013 Jones, respectively. The high performance achieved for the photodetectors based on the SC MAPbI3 wafer is attributed to the high crystalline quality, few grain boundaries, and low trap state density.
Conclusions
In this paper, a large SC MAPbI3 wafer was prepared by simultaneously utilizing the space-confined and seed-induced crystallization methods. This approach can not only avoid the contamination of the surface of the SC wafer caused by the mechanical cutting technique, but also enable the production of the large SC wafer without using the bulky dynamic flow control system for growing the crystal in a constant fresh solution. Based on the as-grown large SC wafer, the arrays of metal–semiconductor–metal type photodetectors each with a tiny effective illumination area of 220 × 20 μm2 were prepared. Our photodetector device showed an extremely low dark current of 6.6 pA under 1 V, because its crystalline property was excellent with a trap state density which was measured to be as small as 2.36 × 1010 cm−3. Compared with the device using the interdigital electrode with a large effective area, our photodetector showed a dark current three orders lower, and correspondingly the light on/off current ratio was enhanced by around 77 times, reaching 4.3 × 103 under 505 nm, 10.2 mW cm−2 illumination. It was demonstrated that the fabricated photodetector could respond stably under on/off illumination with a fast response time of 770 μs. After 30 days storage in air without any modification, its performance did not degrade apparently. Moreover, the LDR was measured to be up to 119 dB with the highest and lowest detectable illumination power density of 74 mW cm−2 and 80 nW cm−2. At a power density of 80 nW cm−2, the EQE, R and D* values can reach 904%, 3.87 A W−1, and 1.77 × 1013 Jones, respectively. In conclusion, we have proposed an alternative approach to produce large SC MAPbI3 wafers, based on which, highly sensitive photodetectors have been demonstrated. The proposed approach can also be applied to grow large SC wafers made of other perovskite materials. Our work contributes to the development of high performance semiconductor optoelectronic devices.
