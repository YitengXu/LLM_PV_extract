    , Accepted 2nd June 2017First published on 2nd June 2017AbstractHeteroatomic conjugated polymers (HCPs) can have complicated molecular structures with several heteroatoms in the repeat unit, which is helpful for designing color-tunable emitters, photovoltaic donors and high mobility materials. In order to understand their relatively complex molecular superstructure characteristics in depth, heteroatomic substitution-induced diverse non-covalent interactions must be investigated. Here, we systematically studied the gelation processing and its influence on the optoelectronic properties of a series of sp2 nitrogen (N) substituted polyfluorenes (PF8-co-DAF8) towards highly stable blue polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). This heteroatomic substitution allows for diverse chain C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds, correlating with an excellent gelation behavior at room temperature. Films with a gelation superstructure show a weak interchain π–π interaction and energy transfer compared to non-gelation ones. PLEDs based on a gelation film give a stable, deep-blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.17) and a luminous efficiency (L.E.) of 1.30 cd A−1, while non-gelation film-based PLEDs display a stable, sky-blue emission (CIE: 0.20, 0.24; L.E.: 2.13 cd A−1). Diverse non-covalent interactions originating from the heteroatomic substitution cause a complicated molecular aggregation behavior in solution that can significantly affect the chain rearrangement in the film-casting process, thereby dominating the optoelectrical properties.
Introduction
Heteroatomic substitution has emerged as a versatile tool to tune the electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs).1 To construct high performance heteroatomic CPs (HCPs), a range of heteroatoms are introduced into an aromatic ring for the design of p–n type polymers, also called donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers (Third Generation CPs), to control electron transfer and tune energy levels.2 Actually, the unique electronic structure of heteroatoms, such as sp2 nitrogen (N), fluorine (F) and sulfur (S), also induced the formation of a wide variety of inter- or intrachain non-covalent interactions (chalcogen–chalcogen interaction and hydrogen-bonding),3 for the control of molecular aggregation and chain packing4 or formation of complexes5 in precursor solution and films. Even weak interactions between chains such as van der Waals forces are sufficient to form large scale regular aggregates; thus the close-packing of chromophores can significantly affect the molecular geometry, altering mobility, color purity and emission efficiency.6 All these provide an effective approach to control energy transfer processes and exciton or charge behaviour of HCPs.7 Molecular gelation processing proven especially beneficial to probe the formation of “precursor aggregation structure” in solution state. Such structure, in turn, dominates the structural development during the film-casting post-process, which can further determine device performance.8 In polymer solar cells, the controllable gelation behavior of donor HCPs was used to optimize film morphology and molecular crystallinity, ultimately enhancing the power conversion efficiency up to nearly 11%.9 How effective is this approach in preparing high-performance materials for other optoelectronic devices is an interesting question – particularly regarding HCPs. A few works have explored the effect of heteroatomic substitution on molecular self-organization behaviour, via a supramolecular approach,6 which could also offer further benefits for optoelectronic devices based on HCPs. With the rapid development of the Third Generation CPs,2a a typical series of HCPs have more complex molecular structures with many heteroatoms in the repeat unit, resulting in diverse intra- or interchain non-covalent interactions. A deeper understanding of the heteroatom-induced molecular aggregation behavior in solution and film needs further investigation. In this work, we will focus on the gelation processing of a series of fluorene-based HCPs and uncover in-depth its effect on optoelectrical properties.
Over the last few decades, as a typical example, the sp2 nitrogen heteroatomic substitution of polyfluorene has proven to be a useful method to construct fluorene-based HCPs.1a,10 However, in contrast to the numerous studies on controlling optical properties via tuning the electronic structure,1 less attention has been given to explore molecular aggregation in the precursor solution and the effect on electroluminescence (EL) properties.1a In comparison to pyridine, bipyridine and other nitrogen (sp2) heterocycles, 4,5-diazafluorene (DAF) is a rigid planar sp2 nitrogen heteroatomic fluorene, with the replacement of carbon atoms at the 4- and 5-position of fluorene with nitrogen atoms.11 In previous works, we synthesized polydiazafluorenes via the Suzuki polymerisation route, which typically resulted in a lower molecular weight and a lower emission efficiency in the film state.11,12 For the present work, our HCPs are based on a series of polydiazafluorenes, called PF8-co-DAF8 (Fig. 1a), which were synthesized via Yamamoto polymerization to increase the molecular weight.12b The heteroatomic polyfluorenes serve as an example of HCPs to investigate the effects of their gelation processing on optoelectronic properties (Fig. 1b). The strong C–H⋯N hydrogen-bonding interactions are the driving force for the PF8-co-DAF8 gelation behaviour in toluene at room temperature. The optoelectrical properties of gelation- and non-gelation films and their devices are intimately linked to the degree of energy transfer (i.e. strength of the C–H⋯N bonds) among the active materials. In both cases, highly efficient, stable blue PLEDs were produced, with a deep-blue emission from the gelation film (weaker interchain π–π interaction and energy transfer) but a sky-blue emission from the non-gelation film.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of PF8-co-DAF8 and PF8
PF8-co-DAF8, with various fractions of nitrogen heteroatomic substitution, and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) were synthesized by Yamamoto polycondensation following our previous studies.8a,b,13 From the 1H NMR spectra of PF8-co-DAF8 in CDCl3 (Fig. S1, ESI†) it can be seen that a new peak appears at chemical shift (δ) 9.06 ppm associated with the aromatic proton adjacent to the nitrogen at 6 position (H–C6, Fig. 1a).14 The fraction of nitrogen heteroatomic substitution is determined by comparing the integrated area of the δ = 9.06 ppm peak with those from the other proton peaks, lying between δ = 8.05 and 7.69 ppm. Polymer samples with about 20%, 30% and 50% nitrogen heteroatomic fraction were synthesized (Fig. 1a). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were obtained by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. S2, ESI†) with found for values of 6.99 × 104 (1.42), 6.69 × 104 (1.46) and 5.49 × 104 (1.88) for the 20%, 30% and 50% PF8-co-DAF8 compounds, respectively. The control polymer, PF8, also shown in Fig. 1a, produced values of 4.66 × 104 (1.97). Overall the Yamamoto polycondensation route provided much higher Mn compared to that obtained via Suzuki polycondensation.12a Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed here to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the PF8-co-DAF8 compounds (Fig. S3, ESI†). These results indicated that the HOMO levels showed little change with nitrogen substitution, with values of −5.790, −5.800, and −5.805 eV for the 20%, 30% and 50% compounds respectively. The LUMO levels, however, consistently decreased with the increasing fraction of nitrogen heteroatomic substitution, with measured values of −2.241 (20%), −2.313 (30%) and −2.363 (50%). This reduction in LUMO energy levels is consistent with the increasing number of electron-withdrawing segments (i.e. DAF8). The resulting electrochemical bandgaps were measured to be 3.549, 3.487 and 3.442 eV for the 20%, 30%, and 50% compounds of PF8-co-DAF8 and were lower than that of PF8 (3.68 eV).15 In the absence of any other effects one would therefore expect the PF8-co-DAF8 polymers to have less deep blue emission, which is not the case.
Supramolecular interaction induced by sp2 nitrogen substitution in PF8-co-DAF8
Single crystal structures of monomers provide an effective and direct means to screen interchain supramolecular interactions of polymers in solution and solid. First of all, single crystals of DBrDAF8 were grown from n-hexane solution and subjected to single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. Crystallographic analysis, performed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements, suggested a cross-distribution of the n-octyl chains at 9-position onto opposite sides of the diazofluorene monomer (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1c, it is obvious that there are two kinds of hydrogen bonding interactions with a characteristic distance of 2.642 Å or 2.620 Å involving N (4, 5)⋯H–C8 (8-position in DAF8) interactions between DBrDAF8 molecules, which is consistent with our previous works.11 Besides, the sp2 N also can interact with the alkyl chain via H-bonding with a distance of 2.683 Å. According to the NMR results above, the δ value of H–C6 is higher than that of H–C8 (Fig. S1, ESI†), suggesting more electron deficiency than that of H–C8, which can also induce the formation of N⋯H–C8 interactions (but not shown in the single crystal data). Actually, these weaker supramolecular N (4, 5)⋯H–C (6, 8) interactions are complicated and significantly strengthened in the corresponding polymer due to the strong aggregation and pervasive conformational order.
Solvent-dependent 1H NMR measurements are also explored here to identify the non-covalent interactions among PF8-co-DAF8 chains. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the 1H NMR spectra of PF8-co-DAF8 (20%) and PF8 in various deuterated solvents, i.e. CHCl3 (CDCl3) and toluene (d8-toluene), are introduced to investigate the effect of supramolecular motifs on chain aggregation. A new peak appears at a chemical shift (δ) value of 9.06 ppm in the spectrum of PF8-co-DAF8 in CDCl3 which is absent in the corresponding spectrum of PF8 (Fig. S1, ESI†). As noted earlier, this peak is associated with the aromatic proton at the 6-position (H–C6) adjacent to nitrogen (Fig. S1, ESI†). The sensitivity of this peak to the local chemical environment is particularly apparent when comparing the spectra of PF8-co-DAF8 in d8-toluene and CDCl3 (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1, ESI†). The original single peak at 9.06 ppm, observed for CDCl3 solutions, splits into two peaks, at 9.31 and 9.13 ppm, revealing two protons in d8-toluene. These peaks are confirmed to be related to the local chemical environment near the nitrogen sites of PF8-co-DAF8 as no evidence of similar peaks is present in the spectra of PF8 in d8-toluene (Fig. S4, ESI†). Furthermore, the signals from H protons spanning the other aromatic region (7.5–8.3 ppm) also split into multiple peaks in d8-toluene, which may also support the formation of N⋯H–C hydrogen-bonds. The rationale behind this behaviour is as follows: owing to the excellent solubility in CDCl3, PF8-co-DAF8 chains are well-dissolved in the isotropic phase and form weak non-covalent hydrogen-bonding interactions (C–D⋯N,3b similar to the weak hydrogen-bonding interaction between N (4, 5) and C–H at the n-octyl chain in the DBrDAF8 single crystals) between PF8-co-DAF8 and CDCl3. Therefore, the H atom at the 6-position (H–C6) site experiences the same chemical environment resulting in only one NMR signal peak. If, however, the PF8-co-DAF8 chains are surrounded by toluene molecules, they are subject to swelling and provide more opportunities to generate interchain interactions of the C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds.16 To confirm the above hypothesis, we explored the effect of adding methanol to PF8-co-DAF8 (20%) in d8-toluene solutions since methanol can act to disrupt the interchain hydrogen-bonding interactions. With the addition of methanol, the separation between peaks 9.31 and 9.13 ppm reduces. Comparing the two traces in Fig. 2, the signal peak around 9.13 ppm (C6–H⋯N hydrogen bond) is shifted down-field to 9.21 ppm while the peak at 9.31 ppm (C6–H) remains largely unchanged at 9.29 ppm. What is more, the peak at 7.88 ppm is downshifted to 7.93 ppm with the addition of methanol, confirming the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions between N (4, 5) and H–C8, consistent with the results of single crystal data. Therefore, the NMR and single crystal characterization provided a clear insight into the supramolecular effect of diazafluorenes, highlighting two different chemical environments, namely the free proton and an associated proton. These distinct environments will have an impact on the chain self-organization, photophysics and electroluminescence properties of PF8-co-DAF8. It is concluded that the incorporation of heteroatoms can induce the formation of diverse inter- or intra-chain hydrogen bonds.

PF8-co-DAF8 gelation mechanisms
Gelation processes provide an effective platform to study the supramolecular self-organization of p–n HCPs. In turn, they are useful to identify suitable solvents for preparing high-quality solution processed polymer thin films.9 In preparation for the future device work, we first examine the effects of solvent and the gelation process for PF8-co-DAF8. Photographs of typical PF8-co-DAF8 gels, prepared by a heating–cooling process, are shown in Fig. 1b. PF8-co-DAF8 can readily form a gel in toluene with a critical gel concentration (CGC) that depends on the heteroatomic nitrogen fraction; specifically a CGC of 3 mg mL−1 is required for a 50% fraction, 10 mg mL−1 for 30% and 20 mg mL−1 for 20% (Table S1, ESI†). In what follows, for stronger aggregation and excellent gelation behavior, we focus on 50% PF8-co-DAF8 dissolved in several solvents with different Hildebrand solubility parameters and polarity points, including CHCl3, bromobenzene, triethylbenzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Table S2, ESI†). Gels of PF8-co-DAF8 can be obtained from toluene or triethylbenzene at room temperature and generally exhibit better gel forming ability than PF8 in toluene.17 As a non-polar organic semiconductor (non-polar hydrocarbons), PF8 has a Hildebrand solubility parameter of 9.1–9.3 (cal cm−3)1/2 with moderate solubility in toluene (8.9 (cal cm−3)1/2).19 The introduction of (polar) nitrogen atoms increases the polarity of PF8-co-DAF8, resulting in poorer solubility in non-polar toluene compared to PF8; this property is the key to generate nanoscale phase separation. Likewise, due to the excellent solubility in either CHCl3 or THF solvents, a gel could not be formed. Considering the earlier NMR studies, we conclude that the interchain C–H⋯N hydrogen interactions of PF8-co-DAF8 are facilitated in the gel-forming solvents (i.e. toluene and triethylbenzene), but are absent in the non-gel solvents (i.e. CHCl3 and THF). Indeed the C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interaction may be considered as a driving force to form PF8-co-DAF8 gels. Such interactions could be further enhanced, for example by increasing the fraction of nitrogen heteroatomic substitution and resulting in a lower CGC. Overall, the experimental observations demonstrate that the C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interaction serves as a driving force for the formation of PF8-co-DAF8/toluene gels.
The effect of molecular coordination, i.e. from the sp2 nitrogen atom, on the gelation behaviour, was also investigated via the inclusion of Lewis acids.10b,12b As the first example, B(C6F5)3 was added to the solution, with the fraction calculated as a molar equivalent of the approximate number of DAF8 units. Upon addition of 0.2 mol equivalents of B(C6F5)3, PF8-co-DAF8 (50%, 5 mg mL−1) precipitated rather than forming gels, despite allowing the solution to age for over 72 hours at room temperature. However, nearly complete recovery of the gelation process was observed if the mixed solution was subsequently titrated with pyridine. A similar behaviour was also observed in further studies using another Lewis acid (i.e. 0.2 mol equivalents of Al3+). The NMR spectra in Fig. 2 again point towards the disruption of C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions among PF8-co-DAF8 chains due to the coordinating interaction between the nitrogen atom (sp2) and B(C6F5)3; both signal peaks, originally at 9.31 ppm and 9.13 ppm, are subsequently shifted upfield for the formation of the coordinated N (δ+)⋯B (δ−) bond during the addition of B(C6F5)3 (Fig. 2, upper trace). Furthermore, the strength of the H–C6 signal peak is diminished, which is qualitatively similar to that when small amounts of methanol are added. It should be noted that the signal of H–C8 is also upshifted, ascribed to the formation of the coordinated -N (δ+)⋯B (δ−) bond.10b In this regard, NMR traces from the coordination study further support the view of C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions as a driving force for the gelation process of PF8-co-DAF8.
Optical properties of PF8-co-DAF8 in various states
Compounds of 20% and 50% PF8-co-DAF8 were chosen to further investigate the effect of the gelation process on the optical properties (Fig. 3). To aid the discussions we introduce the terms “gelation film” or “non-gelation film” to distinguish between spin-coated films originating from a fresh gelation solution (toluene) or a non-gelation solution (CHCl3), respectively. In dilute toluene solutions (10−3 mg mL−1), the absorption peak of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 occurs at 391 nm (Fig. 3a and Table 1), and the emission spectrum consisted of three vibronic peaks at 428, 451 and 486 nm, assigned to the 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 singlet transition (Table S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3b, the emission peaks of the 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gel start from 427 nm, with a long spectral tail to 650 nm. The emission from the 50% PF8-co-DAF8 gel displays even longer wavelength emission, around 490 nm, owing to the stronger C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interaction and energy transfer.3 For other solvents, in which Δδ is small and PF8-co-DAF8 polymer chains are well-dissolved, the maximum peak absorption of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 is similar to that shown in Fig. 3a. With respect to emission, however, a noticeable red-shift of the peak (∼10 nm) is observed for 20% PF8-co-DAF8 in CHCl3 compared with that in toluene, ascribed to the stabilisation of the polar excited state by solvation.18

Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra from PF8-co-DAF8 and PF8 thin films (∼80 nm) are also presented in Fig. 3c and d. The maximum absorbance peak from 20% and 50% PF8-co-DAF8 films occurs at about 391 and 399 nm, respectively, similar to that found for PF8 (391 nm). The PL spectra of the 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation film consisted of two emission peaks at 440 and 460 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 100 nm. However, for the equivalent film prepared from a non-gelation (CHCl3) solution, a strong shoulder emission peak is observed around 495 nm with the longer wavelength peak increasing in size. For 50% PF8-co-DAF8 thin films, the emission peak at 440 nm shows significant quenching in comparison with the 495 nm peak, consistent with stronger interchain interactions and energy transfer, similar to our previous work.12b Here the longer wavelength emission intensities from gelation films are weaker compared to the spectra from non-gelation films.8e Emission from the PF8 films displays the expected glassy phase (from pristine CHCl3 solutions) and the red-shifted, so-called β-phase emission when spin coated from toluene solutions.19 When comparing the control (PF8) and PF8-co-DAF8 spectra, the latter display broad and somewhat featureless PL spectra ascribed to the formation of C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions and stronger interchain energy transfer.6 Meanwhile, we also obtained PL and excitation spectra (PLE) of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation and non-gelation films at −196 °C (77 K). As shown in Fig. 4, the PL spectra of the 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation film consisted of three emission peaks at 444, 475 and 504 nm, similar to classical well-resolved sharp emission peaks (0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 intrachain singlet transition) of the polyfluorene single chain. The small peak shifts are probably due to restriction of the conformational motion (longer effective conjugation length) in the solid films.8d And the corresponding PLE spectrum had only one peak at 385 nm, similar to the absorption peak, which also suggested weaker interchain aggregation and energy transfer. However, it is easy to see that the PL spectrum of the PF8-co-DAF8 non-gelation film at −196 °C (77 K) has the maximum emission peak at 503 nm with the shoulder peaks at 445 and 478 nm, which is consistent with the PL spectra at room temperature, confirming the J aggregation6 in non-gelation films. Significantly different from gelation films, the PLE spectrum of PF8-co-DAF8 non-gelation films had two identical data sets showing the growth of an excitation shoulder at 410 nm, below the π–π* edge, which suggested stronger interchain aggregation and energy transfer in the film states.6,8a Besides, the PLQY of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation and non-gelation films was about 41% and 38%. Owing to the aggregation-induced quenching effect, 50% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation and non-gelation films had lower PLQY, about 28% and 24%, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence decay analysis was carried out on all samples. In the dilute toluene solution, the 20% PF8-co-DAF8 shows a single exponential response with decay times ranging from 386 to 409 ps across the emission spectrum. These are entirely comparable with literature values from polyfluorenes under the same conditions.20 However, the spread of lifetime, across the emission spectra, recorded from the 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gel and film is considerably larger, i.e. 334 ps (gel) and 468 ps (film) at shorter wavelengths (440 nm) and 611 ps (gel) and 698 ps (film) for the longer wavelengths (492 nm) (Table 1 and Table S3, ESI†). This behaviour fits with the notion of a Förster-type interchain energy transfer from the blue emission (427 nm) to the longer wavelength, sky blue emission (492 nm) in the gel and film states.

Morphology of PF8-co-DAF8 gelation and non-gelation films
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) were explored here to further investigate the PF8-co-DAF8 film morphologies spun from toluene and CHCl3 solution (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5, ESI†). From the AFM images (Fig. S5, ESI†), both spun films show a smooth surface with an average roughness of 0.68–0.75 nm, revealing that PF8-co-DAF8 has excellent solution-processed film-forming properties. GIXD was also carried out to characterize the molecular ordering and aggregation of PF8-co-DAF8 films on silicon substrates. As shown in the GIXD images (Fig. 5), the PF8-co-DAF8 films spin-coated from toluene or CHCl3 solution showed both a weak crystalline order and amorphous states, confirming that PF8-co-DAF8 is a candidate for the construction of stable and high-efficiency PLEDs. A broad diffraction ring at about Q = 1.409 Å−1 is observed at all azimuthal angles for PF8-co-DAF8 films spin-coated from toluene solution, which may come from the average chain spacing of the polymers. 4.46 Å is larger than the commonly reported π–π interaction distance for polydiarylfluorene and PF8;8b thus the imperfect conjugated backbone (twists, large torsional angles, etc.) retards the molecular packing, orientation and aggregation in solid state.3b Meanwhile, at this distance, the intermolecular electron coupling is weak, resulting in weaker interchain energy transfer and effectively suppressing low energy band emission. However, for the PF8-co-DAF8 film spin-coated from CHCl3 solution, the center of the broad diffraction ring is about Q = 1.440 Å−1, larger than those of PF8-co-DAF8 gelation films. Besides, it is easy to observe that the X-ray diffraction intensity is also significantly stronger. Consequently, the corresponding distance of π–π interaction is calculated to be about 4.36 Å, shorter than those of gelation films. In this regard, the interchain π–π interaction in the non-gelation films is stronger than that in gelation films, inducing more possible electron coupling and energy transfer in the solid state. These results can also explain why low energy emission at 494 nm of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 is stronger in films spin coated from CHCl3 solution.

Aggregation mechanism of PF8-co-DAF8 in the gel and thin film
A presumable aggregation behaviour of PF8-co-DAF8 in various states is proposed in Fig. 6. PF8-co-DAF8 in both dilute toluene and CHCl3 solution (c = 10−3 mg mL−1) exhibited feature emission of a single polyfluorene chain (about 428, 451 and 486 nm), indicating that there is a weaker interchain interaction (C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interaction). In fact, PF8-co-DAF8 has excellent solubility in CHCl3, and shows the wormlike single chain, which may be attributed to the formation of weaker C–H (CHCl3)⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions according to single crystal data in Fig. 1. PF8-co-DAF8 in gelation solvents (toluene) exhibited a more extensive and rigid chain in the aggregate compared with that in non-gelation solvents owing to the formation of intra- and interchain C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions, which can be disrupted by adding proton solvents such as CH3OH, by adding Lewis acids or by a heating process. With the increasing concentration of CGC, PF8-co-DAF8 can dissolve in toluene at 80 °C with a more extended wormlike conformation and cross-linked aggregates assisted by C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions (440, 460 and 490 nm). Similar to PPFOH gels, the PF8-co-DAF8 gels were obtained in toluene at room temperature and they consisted of an elastic cross-linked network of the polymer main chain assisted by C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds and the solvents filling in the porous spaces of the network. However, it should be noted that some chains in aggregates exhibited tight packing interaction of fluorene segments driven by stronger hydrogen bonding interactions during the phase-separation process for PF8-co-DAF8 with high nitrogen substitution (50%). Therefore, PF8-co-DAF8 (50%) gels showed stronger emission intensity at 490 nm than PF8-co-DAF8 (20%) gels for the efficient energy transfer from single chains to gelation structures. In this framework, the unique stronger emission of PF8-co-DAF8 (20% or 50%) gels and PF8-co-DAF8 50% spun film at 494 nm can be reasonable. The emission band at 490 nm in the PF8-co-DAF8 50% spun film from toluene originates via energy transfer from the isotropic single polymer chains of PF8-co-DAF8 to the multiple polymer chains due to the stronger C–H⋯N supramolecular interactions. In fact, compared to PF8, the formation of C–H⋯N supramolecular interactions allows for more rigid chain structure and conformation, which may suppress stronger molecular aggregation, chain rotation and conformational transition. On the other hand, the weaker hydrogen-bonding interactions between PF8-co-DAF8 and CHCl3 may induce slight chain aggregation and result in stronger interchain π–π interactions in the non-gelation films than those in gelation films, which may further result in more possible electron coupling and efficient energy transfer in the solid states. These diverse conformational orders in the aggregates of PF8-co-DAF8 in solution may propagate into the mesoscale morphology of the films from the fast solvent evaporation. Therefore, the non-gelation film exhibited stronger emission peaks at 460 and 490 nm compared to gelation films in the corresponding PL and EL spectra. All the unique properties induced by these different molecular aggregation behaviours will significantly affect the electrical properties of PF8-co-DAF8.

Gelation effect on the electroluminescence properties of PF8-co-DAF8
In this final section we examine the effects of gelation on electroluminescence (EL) properties. The basic structure of PLEDs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/emission layer (EML)/TPBI/LiF/Al, where ITO, PEDOT:PSS and TPBI represent indium tin oxide, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(styrene-sulfonate) and 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenziphenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene, respectively. PEDOT:PSS and LiF served as hole- and electron-injecting layers, respectively. TPBI is inserted between the EML and LiF to act as an electron transporting and hole blocking layer. PF8-co-DAF8 films spun-coated from toluene (gelation film) and CHCl3 (non-gelation film) are used as EML with similar thickness.
EL spectra and device characteristics from PLEDs are displayed in Fig. 7. EL spectra, from devices with 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation films, show two emission peaks at 460 nm with a shoulder at 440 nm and a FWHM of 70 nm, similar to PL spectra. The corresponding CIE coordinates were found to vary from (0.16, 0.17) to (0.17, 0.17) for applied voltages of 8 V to 13 V, demonstrating excellent EL spectral stability. PLEDs fabricated from the non-gelation counterpart also exhibited high EL spectral stability (Fig. 7b), with the maximum response now appearing at 492 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.20, 0.24) to (0.20, 0.25) for increasing applied voltages (12 V to 16 V). We easily observed that EL spectra consisted of the maximum emission peak at 492 and the shoulder peak at 440 nm. In fact, the EL spectra of both gelation and non-gelation films have stronger emission peaks at 440 and 460 nm (but they disappeared in the EL of non-gelation films for larger FWHM), attributed to the 0–0 and 0–1 singlet transition of the single polyfluorene chain, similar to their PL spectra. Since there are excited chain–chain J aggregations and efficient energy transfer in the non-gelation films,6 a significantly stronger emission at about 490 nm is observed in the EL spectra of non-gelation films, consistent with the analysis in Fig. 4 and 6. Similar spectral stability was also observed from PLEDs containing 50% PF8-co-DAF8 (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). In contrast to the 20% case, both 50% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation- and non-gelation films displayed virtually identical spectra; a main emission peak appeared at 490 nm with a shoulder peak at 440 nm, which is similar to that of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 non-gelation films. The red-shift in the spectra from the devices with a higher fraction of heteroatomic substitution (50%) can be argued through the stronger C–H⋯N supramolecular interactions available and a greater degree of energy transfer. Besides, the interchain energy transfer is also more effective in the non-gelation film compared to the gelation film, which reasonably explains the maximum emission peak at about 490 nm in the EL spectra of 20% PF8-co-DAF8 non-gelation films. A further role of interchain energy transfer, involving C–H⋯N supramolecular assemblies, may be appreciated by comparing these results with PF8 (amorphous) devices. The resulting EL spectra, shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), had a number of clear peaks – the shortest wavelength appearing around 424 nm consistent with the previous works.21 Under increasing bias, a significant color change from blue to white occurs due to the clear growth of green band emission around 520 nm, a feature associated with excimer emission via chain aggregation.8a As demonstrated before, the incorporation of sp2 nitrogen leads to a decrease in the LUMO energy level, which improves the electron injection/transportation and further balances the charge injection/transportation for PF8-co-DAF8 PLEDs. In this regard, it is clear that those compounds with nitrogen heteroatomic substitutions, providing C–H⋯N supramolecular interactions, are able to effectively suppress chain aggregation and the resulting excimer emission.

Luminance (c) and luminous efficiency (d) versus voltage curve of PF8-co-DAF8- and PF8-based PLEDs. Insets in (a) and (b) show PLEDs driven at 10 mA cm−2. 
In terms of PLED performance metrics, devices based on 20% PF8-co-DAF8 gelation films show a deep blue emission (Fig. 7a inset) with a turn-on voltage of 7.0 V and a maximum luminance of 1381 cd m−2 (Table 2, Fig. 7c and d). A maximum luminous efficiency (L.E.) of 1.30 cd A−1 was recorded with a driving voltage of 9.5 V. PLEDs based on non-gelation films display a saturated sky-blue emission with somewhat higher turn-on voltages (10.5 V) and a higher maximum recorded luminance of 1409 cd m−2. The maximum L.E. recorded is 2.13 cd A−1 at 12.5 V. In comparison to devices based on the 20% fraction, the equivalent set of results for devices based on the 50% fraction was less favourable. For PLEDs containing gelation (non-gelation) films for the emissive layers, turn-on voltages were 10.5 V (13 V), recorded maximum luminance values were 213 cd m−2 (235 cd m−2) and L.E. values were 0.25 cd A−1 (0.49 cd A−1) (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Lower PLQY and stronger molecular aggregation can reasonably explain why the PLEDs made of 50% fraction PF8-co-DAF8 gelation films show lower device performance than those made of 20% PF8-co-DAF8. For comparison purposes, performance metrics of the PF8 (amorphous) devices are also shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. Overall, the PF8 devices were generally found to be inferior with a maximum luminance of 735 cd m−2 and a maximum L.E. of 0.35 cd A−1. Notwithstanding the rather basic device structure used for the present study, the overall results are encouraging and clearly demonstrate some of the benefits of the supramolecular approach, such as the spectral stability.

Conclusions
In this work, we have synthesized and examined a series of sp2 nitrogen substituted heteroatomic conjugated polymers, PF8-co-DAF8, and systemically investigated the effects of gelation processing on their optoelectronic properties. The solvent-dependent 1H NMR measurement is proved to be a powerful tool to identify the various non-covalent interactions and study the effect of supramolecular motifs on chain aggregation. In examining different solvents, the presence of C–H⋯N bonding interactions appears to act as a driving force for the formation of PF8-co-DAF8 gels at room temperature. Solution-processed PLEDs, using gelation and non-gelation films for the emissive layers, demonstrated the impact on optoelectronic properties. PLEDs using gelation films, i.e. 20% PF8-co-DAF8 from toluene, provided a deep blue emission (CIE: 0.16, 0.17) with excellent EL spectral stability, whereas PLEDs containing non-gelation films processed from CHCl3 solution exhibited stable sky-blue emission (CIE: 0.20, 0.24). Both results in our work suggest that a weaker energy transfer process is present in the films spun from a gelation state. Overall, we have demonstrated that both aggregation and morphology control of HCPs are the key factors to improve optoelectronic device performance.
