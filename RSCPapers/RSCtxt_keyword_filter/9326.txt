In this work, we report a novel, inverted PSSC with the configuration of FTO/NiO/meso-Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag. The first implementation of the hybrid interfacial layer of an ultrathin NiO compact layer (10–20 nm) plus an inert mesoporous Al2O3 (meso-Al2O3) scaffold, featuring high optical transparency and specific dual blocking effect, leads to minimal light absorption loss and interfacial recombination loss. The device performance has been significantly improved with respect to the control PSSCs without the meso-Al2O3 layer. Synchronized improvements in photovoltage, photocurrent and fill factor lead to a high efficiency of >13%, which is the highest reported so far for NiO based PSSCs. Small hysteresis and stable power output under working conditions have been demonstrated for this type of solar cells. The results also highlight the general and critical importance of interfacial control in PSSCs, and their effects on device performance.

Broader context
During the past 2–3 years, the low-cost perovskite solar cell (PSSC) has achieved a rapid evolution on performance record, up to 20.1% in efficiency. This striking achievement has greatly inspired the photovoltaic community. Currently, two open questions need to be further resolved for PSSC research. One is IV scan hysteresis which can easily lead to an overestimation on the real cell performance, and the other one is about stability. Correct choices of interfacial materials with different properties, and in-depth research on the associated diverse cell configurations, will certainly be beneficial for enhancing understanding, improving performance and resolving obstacles in PSSCs. In this study, NiO/PCBM interfacial materials based on an inverted cell structure have been studied. As demonstrated thoroughly, the interfacial optimization for this type of solar cell is even more critical in comparison to that in regular PSSCs based on TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD. When correlated with different cell configurations, some general rules for interfacial optimization in PSSCs have been uncovered. Firstly, the performance of NiO based PSSCs has been improved remarkably to >13%; small hysteresis and stable power output have also been demonstrated. These results strongly highlight the great future potential for this type of solar cell.

Introduction
As a newly emerged hot research topic in next generation solar cells, the perovskite solar cell (PSSC) has attained great success by elevating the power conversion efficiency of solar cells to over 15% within only several years since its discovery,1–6 which is competitively high when compared to other kinds of thin film solar cells that have existed for decades. The achieved success is closely associated with the specific photoelectrical properties of perovskite light absorbers, such as, appropriate and direct band gap, small exiton binding energy, and long and balanced ambipolar charge transport properties.7,8 In addition to the original concept being borrowed from the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), the basic configuration of the PSSC in the beginning was also based on perovskite quantum dots or ultra-small sensitizers, sandwiched between n-type mesoporous TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD hole transport material.2,4 Since then, this classic cell configuration has become diverse and fundamentally very different. For example, planar structured PSSCs (without a mesoporous TiO2 layer),4,9–12 and meso-superstructured PSSCs (with inert mesoporous Al2O3 (ref. 13–15) or ZrO2 (ref. 16) scaffolds) have also been demonstrated with competitive performance, which in principle cannot work in a normal DSSC system. Recent mechanism studies have gradually uncovered the scientific truth in diverse PSSC configurations.17–22 In principle, all of them can work efficiently by successful interfacial charge separation/collection at different time scales. However, in practice, many groups reported inconsistent results and demonstrated that one cell configuration was superior while the other was inferior. The debates actually reflect the high difficulty and complexity on process control for PSSC preparation. In many cases, the interfacial control of PSSCs, related to the photoelectrical properties of the interfacial materials and their nanoscale morphologies, largely decides the real cell performance.14,15,23,24
Indeed, the interfacial engineering, as a fundamental, generic requisite, has been successfully implemented in types of thin film solar cells.25–27 But in PSSCs, it is in its infancy. To explore more interfacial materials and enhance understanding on their property/morphology control correlated to solar cell performance is important to the current research on PSSCs. In conventional PSSCs, TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD are the most successful couple owing to their good optical transparency and perfect band alignment with respect to CH3NH3PbI3, but there are still many groups that attempt to use alternative electron selective materials with higher conductivity, such as TiO2/graphene composite,28 ZnO,29 and hole transport materials such as PTAA,30 TTF (recently published by our group),31 and CuSCN.32 Recently emerged inverted PSSCs with reversed current flow direction (photo-induced holes instead of electrons collected though the front conductive glass substrate) allow the use of new interfacial materials, such as PEDOT:PSS, NiO and PCBM, which are classic in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs).33–42 New materials and diverse cell configurations will certainly be of benefit for enhancing understanding, improving performance, and resolving some obstacles hard to remove in conventional PSSCs, such as current–voltage scan hysteresis.35,36,44
PEDOT:PSS and NiO have been critically compared as hole selective interfacial materials in high performance OPVs.45–48 In many cases, NiO based devices were reported with better stability and competitive performance (normally with higher photovoltage, Voc, which is due to the deeper valence band position of NiO than the work function of PEDOT:PSS, frequently cited as −5.2 eV versus −5.0–5.1 eV).33–43 But in inverted PSSCs (see the performance summary in Table S1†), there are several papers reporting 14–15% efficiencies on the basis of PEDOT:PSS,35,36 NiO based devices were reported with much lower efficiencies (the best 11.6%).39–43 Their much lower fill factor (FF, 0.55–0.69 versus ∼0.78) and limited photocurrent density (Jsc) offset its advantage on increased Voc (the best 1.05 V versus 0.866–0.94 V). The inconsistent performance of NiO in OPVs and PSSCs strongly suggests that it still has much room to further tap the potential of this stable, low cost and effective hole selective interfacial material in inverted PSSCs.
In this work, a compact NiO layer prepared by a facile spray pyrolysis method onto FTO glass with ultrathin thickness (10–20 nm), plus an inert mesoporous Al2O3 (meso-Al2O3) scaffold, was employed as a “hybrid interfacial layer” for effective hole selective extraction. In comparison to conventional meso-superstructured PSSCs starting from a compact TiO2 layer, where meso-Al2O3 could be replaced by mesoporous TiO2 with even higher performance records,5 the necessity of meso-Al2O3 has caused some dispute. That situation will not exist in our inverted PSSCs starting from a compact NiO layer. We believe that the introduction of meso-Al2O3 in inverted PSSCs is with increased necessity because there is almost no choice of transparent p-type semiconductors. The superiority of the hybrid interfacial layer of ultrathin compact NiO/meso-Al2O3 in minimizing light harvesting and interfacial recombination losses has been clearly demonstrated with sufficient and solid support from data. Furthermore, through careful and sufficient comparable studies, the critical requirement of interfacial control in inverted PSSCs towards high device performance has been fully clarified. We believe that these results in high performance inverted PSSCs have important significance when corroborated with those obtained in conventional PSSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All solvents and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of analytically pure quality and used as received. PbI2 (99%), Al2O3 nanoparticle dispersion in isopropanol (<50 nm, 20 wt%), and nickel acetylacetonate (95%) were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Super dehydrated solvents of dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol, toluene and chlorobenzene were purchased from Wako Co., Japan.
Fabrication of perovskite films
CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were prepared in a N2 protected glove box in two different ways: (1) two step sequential method: first, 70 °C DMF solutions of PbI2 (with concentrations of 460–550 mg ml−1) were spin-coated onto warm FTO glasses at a rotation speed of 6000 rpm for 30 seconds, then after, they were dried for 20 min at 70 °C on a hotplate and cooled for 5 min. Then, the PbI2 films were immersed in 10 mg ml−1 isopropanol solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) for 15 or 25 min. The brown perovskite films were soaked in isopropanol quickly and dried by spinning on a spin-coater. Finally, the films were dried at 70 °C on a hotplate for a further 20 min. (2) One step solvent extraction method: first, a 50 μl 1.25 M DMSO solution of PbI2/MAI mixture was spread onto warm FTO glass; then, the spin-coater was started at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for 10 seconds and 5000 rpm for another 30 seconds. 800 μl toluene was added quickly 10 seconds after the 5000 rpm spin-coating started. The films were then heated at 100 °C on a hotplate for 10 min.
Fabrication of compact NiO and mesoporous Al2O3 films
NiO films were prepared by spray pyrolysis method. The washed FTO glasses were firstly heated up to 500 °C on a hotplate. 10 ml of an acetonitrile solution of nickel acetylacetonate was sprayed within 10 min by air nozzle onto the FTO glasses from a distance of about 20 cm above the glass. For NiO-1 film, the concentration of the solution was set at 0.04 M, for NiO-2 film, it was set at 0.08 M. Afterwards, the coated FTO glasses were kept at 500 °C for 30 min to promote crystallization. For transparent meso-Al2O3 film preparation, 2.0 g of Al2O3 nanoparticle dispersion in isopropanol (20 wt%) was added to 12.0 g of α-terpinol and 2.0 g of an ethanol solution of ethyl cellulose (10 wt%). The mixture was then treated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and stirred for another 30 min to form a homogenous paste. The paste was subsequently spin-coated onto FTO glass at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds to form a uniform film. After the wet film was dried at 80 °C on a hotplate for 30 min, it was transferred to a muffle furnace and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. A meso-Al2O3 film of 90–100 nm thickness was finally obtained.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
After the perovskite film was deposited on the NiO or NiO/meso-Al2O3 coated FTO glass, 20 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene solution of PCBM was spin-coated at a rotation speed of 1800 rpm for 30 seconds. The corresponding PCBM film thickness was around 60–80 nm. After PCBM coating, the film was dried at 70 °C on a hotplate for 15 min. Then, 100 μl saturated methanol solution of bathocuproine (BCP) was dropwise added on top of PCBM during 6000 rpm spin-coating. The film was then dried at 70 °C on a hotplate for 15 min. All of these processes were done in a N2 protected glove box. Finally, one batch of films was quickly transferred to the evaporator, 100 nm thick Ag films were coated under high vacuum (10−4 Pa).
Characterization
The morphologies of the films were characterized using a JSM-6500F field-emission scanning electron microscope. TEM observations were carried out on a JEM-ARM200F transmission electron microscope. TEM samples were prepared using a FIB cutting technique. XRD patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, RINT-2500) with a CuKα radiation source. UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV/Vis 3600 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1287 and 1255B): the solar cells were kept in the dark and under different bias potentials at frequencies ranging from 106–10−1 Hz. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a digital source meter (2400, Keithley) under a simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (WXS-90L2, Wacom). The simulated light intensity was calibrated with a silicon photodiode. The active area of each device of 0.09 cm2 was determined by using a mask slightly smaller than the active area. IPCE were measured with a mono-chromatic incident light of 1016 photons per cm2 in DC mode (CEP-2000, Bunko-Keiki).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the typical cell configuration of our inverted PSSC. An ultrathin NiO compact layer on FTO was used for hole selective collection from CH3NH3PbI3. A meso-Al2O3 scaffold layer covers the surface of the NiO layer. The inert meso-Al2O3 scaffold was involved in the fabrication of an inverted PSSC for the first time. Different from mesoporous NiO scaffolds with p-type semiconductivity,40,43 the hole transport paths in this kind cell could be constrained to the high mobility perovskite channels (μh = 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1)34 since the hole injection from CH3NH3PbI3 to Al2O3 is energetically forbidden.49 The structural advantage of introducing the hybrid interfacial layer of compact NiO/meso-Al2O3 into the inverted PSSC is believed to be with ever increased necessity. That is because unlike n-type semiconductors, e.g., TiO2, ZnO, etc., there is a very limited choice of p-type metal oxides with such high optical transparency. As a consequence, the compact NiO blocking layer should be controlled to be as thin as possible to prevent light absorption loss. However, full coverage of an ultrathin NiO layer on the surface of rough FTO glass becomes a great challenge. In this case, an additional meso-Al2O3 layer can play the role of defect-complement for the ultrathin NiO layer (as denoted by the red oval arrows in Fig. 1a). Besides, using highly transparent meso-Al2O3 to replace greenish mesoporous NiO (absorption due to oscillator strength d–d interband transitions)45 will certainly be of benefit for highlighting the achievement of the harvesting efficiency of PSSCs. This intrinsic drawback of mesoporous NiO, as well as its low hole mobility (10−5 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),50 have been widely proved in p-type sensitized solar cells, in which such properties largely hinder the achievement of a high Jsc value for those solar cells.39–43,51,52 CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on top of the NiO/meso-Al2O3 interfacial layer. Its morphology, associated with preparation conditions and methods, is critical to the solar cell performance, which will be clarified later in this work. PCBM and BCP layers were spin-coated subsequently to cover the perovskite layer. Ag deposited on top by thermal evaporation was used for electron collection. Fig. 1b shows the corresponding energy level diagram of our inverted PSSC. The valence band position of spray pyrolysis deposited NiO was measured in our lab by photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S1†). The band edge positions of Al2O3 and CH3NH3PbI3, HOMO/LUMO positions of PCBM and BCP, and work functions of FTO and Ag are cited from literature.33–42 The appropriate type-II band alignments between NiO/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM allow efficient hole and electron selective extraction at their interfaces.34,39,49 Therefore, the high external quantum efficiency in this inverted PSSC can be theoretically guaranteed. The potential offsets are ∼0.3 eV and ∼0.2 eV at the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and NiO/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces, which are close to the optimum minimums required to drive the interfacial charge transfer and are of definite benefit for the achievement of high Voc of this inverted PSSC. The dual blocking roles of the hybrid interfacial layer have been highlighted by the dashed red arrows in Fig. 1b. The first blocking function undertaken by the compact NiO layer is due to its deeper valence band rather than the work function of FTO, which can prevent hole leakage from FTO substrate to CH3NH3PbI3. The second blocking function is fulfilled by the inert meso-Al2O3 scaffold: firstly, some pinholes of the ultrathin NiO layer can be filled by Al2O3 nanoparticles, which help to block the shunt paths between FTO/CH3NH3PbI3; secondly, possible shunt paths between NiO and PCBM can be blocked via the meso-Al2O3 layer with perovskite filling inside.

In order to clarify the dual blocking effect of the compact NiO/meso-Al2O3 layer, five kinds of interfacial layers have been compared in the control experiments. They are (1) “bare FTO” without any blocking layers, (2) a spray pyrolysis deposited thin NiO-1 film of 10–20 nm thickness, (3) a thick NiO-2 film of 30–50 nm thickness, (4) a meso-Al2O3 film (∼90 nm) covering on bare FTO and (5) a meso-Al2O3 film covering on NiO-1 coated FTO (denoted as NiO–meso Al2O3), respectively. For easier reading, hereafter the solar cells based on these five interfacial layers are denoted as “Cell bare FTO”, “Cell NiO-1”, “Cell NiO-2”, “Cell meso-Al2O3” and “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”. The morphologies of these interfacial layers are depicted in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2a, it is shown that “bare FTO” consists of submicron FTO crystals with pyramid shapes (roughness ≈ 100 nm). In comparison to surface flat ITO glass (roughness < 10 nm), to fully cover the rough FTO glass becomes a greater challenge. Especially for colored NiO, the compact blocking layer thickness cannot be so high due to its optical limitation. In conventional PSSCs, the optimized thickness of compact TiO2 as suggested by values in the literature could range from 20–100 nm.3,4,23 In contrast, compact NiO film of >50 nm thickness is believed to be unacceptable due to optical loss, which cannot be ignored. As commonly reported for OPVs,45–48 critically thin NiO films (normally 5–20 nm thickness) was a prerequisite for high performance. In recently reported inverted PSSCs, it has also been confirmed that a slight change in the thickness of sol–gel derived NiO blocking layers could largely tune the device performance.41,42 In this work, we firstly introduced a spray pyrolysis method to deposit the ultrathin compact NiO films onto FTO glasses for PSSC application. Spray pyrolysis is a low-cost, easy scale-up method, which has been applied to deposit a wide variety of metal oxides films, including the successful example of compact TiO2layers in conventional PSSCs.53 The crystallinity and therefore conductivity of as-deposited NiO films could be improved due to the sintering at elevated temperature (500 °C) allowed by FTO glasses.50 The morphologies of NiO-1 and NiO-2 films are shown in Fig. 2b and c. It can be observed that the NiO coatings can perfectly replicate the morphology of FTO crystals. The results reflect that crystal growth of the NiO films occurs in a highly controlled manner, which should take advantage of monomeric dispersion of nickel acetylacetonate molecules in inert acetonitrile solvent and their instantaneous decomposition at 500 °C on the FTO surface. TEM images shown in Fig. 2e and f confirm that the compact NiO layers cover the FTO crystals well. The crystal lattice difference between FTO and NiO could be clearly identified from the high resolution image (Fig. 2e). Note that, some low-lying gaps between FTO crystals may not be well blocked by the compact NiO layer, which is hard to observe by electron microscopy. In comparison to NiO-1 film deposited from a 0.04 M nickel acetylacetonate precursor, NiO-2 film deposited from a higher concentration (0.08 M) of precursor is observed to consist of a ∼20 nm thick compact layer plus a 10–20 nm thick accumulated nanoparticle layer (Fig. 2f). The generation of the accumulated layer in NiO-2 film should be due to the faster deposition rate of the Ni source and such a layer makes the NiO-2 film look rougher than the NiO-1 film (Fig. 2b and c). Fig. 2d depicts the full coverage of meso-Al2O3 film on FTO glass, the thickness of which is controlled at 90–100 nm. In particular, most of the low-lying gaps of the FTO surface have been filled by Al2O3 nanoparticles. In addition, we confirm that the greater thickness of meso-Al2O3 will create a pore filling problem in some perovskites.

The critical requirement on NiO film thickness is related to the effective light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of inverted PSSCs, which can be identified from the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3a, it is known that NiO-1 and NiO–meso Al2O3 films possess a very similar transmittance to that of bare FTO glass. An additional meso-Al2O3 layer even has some anti-reflective effect, in which the reflection is even slightly lower than that of bare FTO. In contrast, the transmittance of NiO-2 film is definitely lower than that of NiO-1 and NiO–meso Al2O3 films (by 5–10% in the visible range). After considering the reflection loss of substrate and the light absorption loss due to the interfacial materials, the calculated effective LHEs in the 500–600 nm region for “Cell NiO-1”, and “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” (Fig. 3b) are in the range of 81–84%, whilst that for “Cell NiO-2” in the same region is around 76–79%.

The absorption is calculated by “100% − transmittance − reflectance”. (b) Light extinction by different layers. LHE is calculated by considering reflection loss of a real cell and absorption loss by FTO glass and front interfacial layers (NiO and meso-Al2O3). 
At the beginning of this research, the CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared by the well-known two step sequential solution method, namely, firstly to spin-coat PbI2 films (concentration of PbI2 in DMF is 550 mg ml−1) onto FTO glasses and then to immerse them in MAI solution for 15 min. Shown in Fig. 4a are cross sectional SEM images of two typical cells, i.e., “Cell NiO-1” (left) and “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” (right). Their structural difference mostly rests with the meso-Al2O3 layer. The thicknesses of CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM layers between the two solar cells are similar. Typical light and dark J–V characteristic curves of the five compared solar cells are shown in Fig. 4b and c, and their performance parameters are listed in Table 1. “Cell bare FTO” and “Cell meso-Al2O3” are included for easier identification of the roles of the interfacial layers. “Cell NiO-1”, “Cell NiO-2” and “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” are the cells developed in this work, for high performance. The average performance parameters of the three kinds of solar cell by statistical analysis on one batch of 10 cells (see Fig. S3†) has also been provided in Table 1. The performance of the solar cells within the same batch represents good coherence, strengthening the reliability of the changeable tendencies of the performance parameters. Two important tendencies are notable: (1) Jsc decreases from “Cell NiO-1” (15.9 mA cm−2) to “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” (15.1 mA cm−2) to “Cell NiO-2” (14.1 mA cm−2), (2) FF increases from 0.62 for “Cell NiO-1” to 0.66 for “Cell NiO-2” and reaches a maximum at 0.72 for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”. The overall power conversion efficiency is tuned accordingly, the maximum of which is achieved by “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” (η = 11.3% on average), higher than that of “Cell NiO-1” (η = 10.1% on average) by 11.9% and “Cell NiO-2” (η = 9.5% on average) by 18.9%. By integration of the IPCE spectrum with respect to the solar spectrum, the mismatches between the calculated Jsc and measured data for our solar cells are within 5%, confirming that reliable measurements were obtained for these devices (Fig. S4†). The shape of the IPCE spectra of “Cell NiO-1” and “Cell NiO-2” are kept nearly the same; but in the whole spectral range, the IPCE for “Cell NiO-2” is around 10% less than that of “Cell NiO-1” (Fig. S4†). It is believed that such a decrease is mostly derived from their effective light harvesting difference according to Fig. 3b. Large FF improvement is the biggest advantage for introducing the dual blocking interfacial layer of NiO/meso-Al2O3 in “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”, which offsets its small loss in Jsc and leads to a solid improvement in the overall efficiency. The high FF of >0.7 is an outstanding feature of our NiO/meso-Al2O3 based PSSCs in comparison to previously reported NiO based PSSCs (Table S1†).39–43 Though, by preparing a thicker NiO film, the FF of “Cell NiO-2” is also improved to some extent (0.66 versus 0.62), but too much loss of Jsc leads to an even lower efficiency. These comparisons highlight the necessity and superiority of employing of such a NiO/meso Al2O3 interfacial layer.

The dual blocking effect could be clearly identified by comparing dark J–V curves of the five controlled solar cells (Fig. 4c). Associated with the five different interfacial layers, different forward bias onset voltages and leakage current densities can be clearly identified. The onset voltages increase from ∼400 mV for “Cell bare FTO”, ∼900 mV for “Cell NiO-1, NiO-2” to ∼940 mV for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”. Such a tendency is consistent with their detected Voc, in the sequence of Cell NiO–meso Al2O3 (1039 mV) > Cell NiO-1, Cell NiO-2 (1021–1022 mV) > Cell bare FTO (198 mV). Basically, the onset voltages of the dark J–V curves depend on the energy barriers of the effective junctions presented in the solar cells. For example, a significantly higher forward bias onset voltage for “Cell NiO-1” (∼910 mV) compared with that for “Cell bare FTO” (∼400 mV) is consistent with the potential offsets changing from “Evb,NiO − ELUMO,PCBM” (∼1.0 eV) to “Ework function,FTO − ELUMO,PCBM” (∼0.5 eV). This result, on the one hand, highlights the effectiveness of the NiO blocking layer; but on the other hand, reflects the presence of short contacts between FTO and PCBM in “Cell bare FTO”. It is clear that the perovskite layer made by the two-step method has some pinholes. Such pinholes could be largely removed by introducing a meso-Al2O3 layer. This point is well supported by the dark J–V curve of “Cell meso-Al2O3”. In such a cell, there is also no NiO compact layer; instead, an additional meso-Al2O3 layer is present. Due to such a structural difference, the onset voltage of “Cell meso-Al2O3” becomes as high as ∼940 mV. Plausibly, the inserted meso-Al2O3 layer acts as the holder for a well-defined perovskite layer covering on top of the FTO. Therefore, PCBM and FTO (or NiO) are spatially separated in “Cell meso-Al2O3” (or “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”) (see Fig. S2†). The leakage current at different bias ranges is the result of: (1) beyond the forward onset voltage, after overcoming the energetic barrier, holes flowing freely from FTO, via valence band states of NiO (in “Cell NiO-1” and “Cell NiO-2”), or via valence band states of CH3NH3PbI3 (in “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”), to PCBM/Ag; (2) below the onset voltage to near zero bias, holes leaking from FTO to PCBM/Ag at a limited rate through different pathways: via NiO gap states and FTO not fully covered by NiO (which theoretically exist) in “Cell NiO-1” and “Cell NiO-2” where NiO/PCBM shunt paths are present; or via the NiO gap states to perovskite in “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” where NiO/PCBM shunt paths and uncovered FTO were further blocked by meso-Al2O3. Therefore, leakage current density in “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” is observed to be smaller than that for “Cell NiO-2” and much smaller than that for “Cell NiO-1”. This sequence reflects the blocking effect of different interfacial layers as in the sequence: NiO–meso Al2O3 > NiO-2 > NiO-1. A thicker NiO layer with a stronger blocking effect should be due to full coverage of the NiO-2 film on the FTO surface and its higher resistance. The combined interfacial layer of NiO/meso-Al2O3 with the best, dual blocking effect should be due to the removal of the NiO/PCBM shunt paths and further passivation of FTO with no NiO covering. Shunt resistances (Rsh) of FF of the solar cells are accordingly improved, just in the reverse sequence of their leakage current (see Table 1). Whilst, series resistance (Rs) for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” is very close to that for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”, reflecting that the additional meso-Al2O3 layer will not increase charge transfer difficulty.
In order to further clarify the different blocking effect of the interfacial layers, we resorted to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which recently has been successfully introduced to the PSSC system in order to monitor the interfacial changes.54,55 Similar to the literature, in our inverted PSSCs, two evident arcs can also be identified from the Nyquist plots, which can be well fitted by the inset equivalent circuit in Fig. S5a.† It is found that only the resistance (R3) associated with the lower frequency feature changes largely due to different interfacial materials in the three compared solar cells (Fig. S5b†). The results strongly support that such low frequency featured resistance, R3, should be assigned to the recombination resistance of the solar cells (denoted as Rrec), which is similar in time scale and value to conventional PSSCs.54,55 The dependencies of Rrec on the applied potential are shown in Fig. 4d. It can be clearly found that over the entire potential range tested, Rrec for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” is higher than that for “Cell NiO-2”, and they are much higher than that for “Cell NiO-1”. Higher recombination resistance reflects the superior blocking effect of the interfacial material NiO–meso Al2O3, which explains its smallest leakage current densities as shown in Fig. 4c. Furthermore, increased Rrec will contribute to the shunt resistance of the solar cells.54,55 As discussed before, increased shunt resistances of the solar cells are the main reason for the increased FF from “Cell NiO-1”, “Cell NiO-2” to “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3”. The higher frequency featured resistance, R2, according to literature, should be assigned to the charge transport resistance within the solar cells.54,55 It is found that R2 for “Cell NiO-1” is smaller than that for “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” and they are both smaller than that for “Cell NiO-2” (Fig. S5b†). Such a sequence of R2 is reasonable. That is because the NiO film in “Cell NiO-2” is thicker and the charge transport path through the perovskite inside the meso-Al2O3 pore channels in “Cell NiO–meso Al2O3” is narrower, both of which will result in higher resistance.
Regarding the relatively low Jsc of the inverted PSSCs in Table 1, the quality of the perovskite films has been further optimized via different deposition methods and detailed conditions. After fully tapping the potential of the classic two step sequential method by testing about 20 batches of solar cells, we gradually recognized the dilemma of such a method towards the simultaneous achievement of high Jsc and FF. We then turned to the newly emerged one step solvent extraction method36 for flatter perovskite film deposition and quickly got the best performances. The performance parameters of four representative solar cells during the optimization process are listed in Table 2. Their J–V characteristic curves and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The perovskite films for “Cell 1” and “Cell 2” were made by the classic two step sequential method by immersing the PbI2 films in MAI solution for a longer time of 25 min. Note that the perovskite films of solar cells in Table 1 were treated in MAI solution for 15 min. A longer immersion time of the PbI2 film in MAI solution could lead to a completed conversion of PbI2 to perovskite, which could increase the light absorption of the films (Fig. S6†). As reflected from the IPCE spectra in Fig. S7,† it is known that a longer immersion time would lead to an increased IPCE in both the short wavelength region (<500 nm) and long wavelength region (700–800 nm). It is noteworthy that, in the short wavelength region, the improved IPCE should be due to the removal of PbI2 which has competitive light absorption to that for the perovskite in the same region. From the IPCE spectra in Fig. S7,† it is known that the highest Jsc could be obtained by the PbI2 film by spin-coating in 490 mg ml−1 solution, followed by immersion in MAI solution for 25 min. However, longer immersion time in MAI solution would lead to an excessive growth of some rod-like perovskite crystals of sub-micron size, as shown in Fig. 6c. With such large crystals, the surface of the perovskite film became increasingly rough, which is hard to fully cover with the thin PCBM layer. As shown in Fig. 6d and e, by increasing the concentration of PCBM solution from 20 mg ml−1 to 30 mg ml−1 and decreasing the rotation speed of spin-coating from 1800 rpm to 1000 rpm, the thickness of the PCBM layer could be increased from 60–80 nm (in “Cell 1”) to ∼150 nm (in “Cell 2”). A thicker PCBM film could cover the rough surface of the perovskite film better, leading to a much improved FF for the corresponding “Cell 2” than for “Cell 1” (0.75 versus 0.58). However, a thicker PCBM film could create a higher electron transport resistance, and limit LHE of the solar cell due to hindering light reflection from the metal electrode (especially, in the wavelength region of 600–800 nm where the perovskite layer absorbs weak).36 As a consequence of these factors, the Jsc of “Cell 2” decreases to 16.0 mA cm−2, from 18.1 mA cm−2 for that seen for “Cell 1”. The points are well supported by their IPCE spectra in Fig. 5b. The calculated Jsc from IPCEs are 18.0 mA cm−2 for “Cell 1” and 16.3 mA cm−2 for “Cell 2”, respectively. With the trade-off between low Jsc and high FF values, “Cell 2” achieved the best performance among the solar cells with perovskite films made by the two step sequential method, with an efficiency of 12.7%.

The insets in (d) and (e) show images of the corresponding cross-sectional views. (b) depicts the film in “Cell 3”, (d) depicts the film in “Cell 1” and (e) depicts the film in “Cell 2”. 
Obviously, a Jsc value of 16.0 mA cm−2 for “Cell 2” is not a satisfactory result. However, as is the case for “Cell 1”, many strategies that involved the tuning of the conditions of the two step sequential method towards the improvement of the Jsc values through improved light harvesting in the perovskites, failed to simultaneously achieve high FF values. Another example shown in Fig. S8† is that the perovskite film obtained by immersing hot PbI2 film (70 °C, instead of normally cool film) in MAI solution for 15 min. The average crystal size of such a film is largely increased to ∼500 nm, which provides the film with strong light scattering. The IPCE of the corresponding solar cell is improved, Jsc can also reach 18.3 mA cm−2, but its FF and Voc values decrease a lot.
From the above, it is clear that it is very hard to further improve the cell performance on the basis of the perovskite films made by the two step sequential method. The point is that the perovskite film with a greater roughness cannot be well covered by a thin PCBM layer. Note that the normally reported spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers in conventional PSSCs are within the thicknesses of ∼300 nm, the thickness of PCBM layer should be kept within 150 nm. Both the optical and electrical properties of PCBM may account for the thickness limitation.36 Such critical thickness of PCBM requires a flatter perovskite surface. The one step solvent extraction method just meets this demand. See the morphology of the perovskite film made by such a “one step” method shown in Fig. 6a. The average perovskite crystal size in “Cell 3” made by the one-step method is about 250 nm, which is relatively larger than that in “Cell 2” made by the two-step method (∼170 nm). In particular, the morphology of the crystals in “Cell 2” is mostly tetragonal-like with one corner perpendicular to the glass surface; while that in “Cell 3” is mostly tabular-like without any sharp bulges. The surface roughness for these two perovskite films is quite different: in “Cell 2” it is ∼50–300 nm, while that in “Cell 3” is within 20 nm. For such a flat perovskite film made by the one-step method, it becomes much easier to be fully covered by the thin (∼60 nm) PCBM layer (Fig. 6b). We then obtained the best performance of the NiO–meso Al2O3 based inverted PSSCs (“Cell 3” in Table 2) with an efficiency of 13.5%, with a much improved Jsc value of 18.0 mA cm−2 and simultaneously high FF (0.72) and Voc (1.04 V) values. By contrast, for “Cell 4” with a planar cell structure without meso-Al2O3, though based on the same perovskite film made by the one step method, its performance is very inferior due to a much lower FF (0.63) and Voc (0.96 V) values. (Fig. 5a and Table 2). The average values of Voc and FF for one batch of 10 cells between the PSSCs prepared using the same conditions as “Cell 3” and “Cell 4” obeys the same tendencies (Fig. S9,†Table 2), which further highlights the superiority of the hybrid interfacial layer with dual blocking effect in inverted PSSCs.
The J–V curves of “Cell 3” obtained at different scanning rates with a delay time ranging from 50 to 500 ms are shown in Fig. 7a. The detected efficiencies are very close, reflecting that the solar cell reaches an equilibrium state and its output should be very close to the real value. It is known that J–V scan hysteresis could lead to overestimation of the real device performance. The J–V curves of “Cell 3” obtained at different scanning directions are shown in Fig. 7b. The J–V hysteresis is still present in the cell but the degree is very small in comparison to many conventional PSSCs with planar or meso-superstructured configurations.44,56 It is interesting that in the reverse scan mode, the detected Voc of the cell is even higher with a value of 1.07 V, and the Jsc and FF values are a little inferior, leading to a slightly lower efficiency of 12.8%. Such a hysteresis phenomenon is contrary to that in observed for conventional PSSCs, in which J–V scanning in the reverse direction (from Voc to Jsc) normally leads to higher FF values. It seems that this hysteresis difference may be related to the different properties of charge extraction layers, when TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD in conventional PSSCs were replaced by NiO/PCBM in our inverted PSSCs. Similar J–V hysteresis could be found in the cell made under the same conditions as those for “Cell 2”, with the perovskite being made by the two step method and a morphology different to that observed for “Cell 3” (see Fig. S10†). Therefore, we suspect that the hysteresis of PSSCs may be related more to the interfacial conditions rather than the morphology of the perovskite itself. This point is worthy for further study on the basis of this cell configuration, which may help to resolve some critical debates, when corroborated with the data obtained in conventional PSSCs. The steady photocurrent output of “Cell 3” measured on an electrochemical workstation under different bias potentials and continuous light illumination are shown in Fig. 7c. The equilibrium photocurrent densities of “Cell 3” generated at 0.80, 0.84 and 0.88 V are 16.6, 16.2 and 15.0 mA cm−2, respectively. Accordingly, the calculated power densities under these potentials are 13.28, 13.61 and 13.20 mW cm−2, corresponding to solar conversion efficiencies of 13.28%, 13.61% and 13.20% respectively. These results in Fig. 7a–c reflect that the notable >13% efficiency for our inverted PSSCs is quite reliable. The continuous photocurrent outputs under illumination both at maximum power and under short-circuit conditions represent good stability: no performance degradation has been monitored over the duration of 10 minutes. This is very different from recently reported planar PSSCs based on compact TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD, of which the output continuously degraded within minutes,56 highlighting the potential advantage of the inverted cell structure.

(c) steady photocurrent output over 10 minutes at different bias potentials of “Cell 3” under 1 sun illumination. 
Furthermore, in comparison to PEDOT:PSS based inverted PSSCs with the best efficiencies of ∼15%,36,37 the Jsc and FF values of our best cell are still a little inferior but are very close now (Table S1†). More importantly, the Voc value of the NiO/meso-Al2O3 based PSSC is definitely higher by ∼100–200 mV. The Voc value of 1.0–1.1 V is closer to that of the champion cells with conventional cell configurations based on TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD. This implies, from the perspective of energy level alignment, that the potential of the NiO/meso-Al2O3 interfacial layer should be superior to that of PEDOT:PSS. Through the further optimization of the quality of the perovskite film and the multiple interfaces, there is great promise to achieve a new record based on this cell configuration of inverted PSSC.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a hybrid interfacial layer of “compact NiO/meso-Al2O3” for an inverted PSSC, which leads to solid improvements in photovoltaic performance. The hybrid interfacial layer composed of an ultrathin NiO compact layer (10–20 nm) and a thin meso-Al2O3 layer (90 nm) exerts an important “dual blocking effect”. On the one hand, it strongly passivates the FTO/CH3NH3PbI3 interface; on the other hand, it helps to block the shunt paths between NiO/PCBM via the meso-Al2O3 layer with perovskite filling inside. The interfacial recombination loss could be sufficiently minimized. Moreover, ultrathin NiO and transparent meso-Al2O3 guarantee an excellent optical transmittance, which can minimize the optical loss in a NiO based PSSC system. A high efficiency of >13% has been achieved with a high FF (>0.7), a Jsc of ∼18 mA cm−2 value and Voc values of above 1.0 V, by using the “hybrid interfacial layer” strategy. This is substantial progress in NiO based PSSCs, in view of the great challenge presented by the critical balance between the high optical transmittance and the efficient electrical blocking at the interface. The concept of using a hybrid interfacial layer should be extendable to a wide variety of thin film solar cells. These results also highlight the general importance of suppressing interfacial losses and their adverse effects on photovoltaic performance.

Broader context
During the past 2–3 years, the low-cost perovskite solar cell (PSSC) has achieved a rapid evolution on performance record, up to 20.1% in efficiency. This striking achievement has greatly inspired the photovoltaic community. Currently, two open questions need to be further resolved for PSSC research. One is IV scan hysteresis which can easily lead to an overestimation on the real cell performance, and the other one is about stability. Correct choices of interfacial materials with different properties, and in-depth research on the associated diverse cell configurations, will certainly be beneficial for enhancing understanding, improving performance and resolving obstacles in PSSCs. In this study, NiO/PCBM interfacial materials based on an inverted cell structure have been studied. As demonstrated thoroughly, the interfacial optimization for this type of solar cell is even more critical in comparison to that in regular PSSCs based on TiO2/spiro-OMeTAD. When correlated with different cell configurations, some general rules for interfacial optimization in PSSCs have been uncovered. Firstly, the performance of NiO based PSSCs has been improved remarkably to >13%; small hysteresis and stable power output have also been demonstrated. These results strongly highlight the great future potential for this type of solar cell.

 	Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis spectra (diffuse transmittance, reflection) of bare FTO glass (black curves), NiO-1 (red curves), NiO–meso Al2O3 (cyan curves) and NiO-2 (blue curves) films on FTO glasses. The absorption is calculated by “100% − transmittance − reflectance”. (b) Light extinction by different layers. LHE is calculated by considering reflection loss of a real cell and absorption loss by FTO glass and front interfacial layers (NiO and meso-Al2O3).
