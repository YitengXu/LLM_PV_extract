This article provides an overview of recent progress in OFETs based on solution processable small molecules that can be converted to insoluble organic semiconducting materials on films by thermal or photochemical removal of leaving groups after fabrication of the film.Hiroko Yamada studied chemistry at Kyoto University where she received a PhD.

He was awarded the synthetic organic chemistry award, Japan in 1985 for collaborative work with Prof. A. Kaji, T. Tanikaga and T. Tanaka. His former research interests were organic synthesis by nitro compounds, and pyrrole and porphyrin synthesis, which have subsequently changed to material science based on his former research.1 IntroductionOrganic semiconductors have emerged as an important class of new materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and sensor materials.1–6 Recent progress in this field has been remarkable, and televisions based on OLEDs are now in industrial production. On the other hand, other applications of organic semiconductors such as OFETs or solar cells are still far from practical realization, for the device efficiency of organic materials in such applications is poor compared to those of Si-based devices. However, organic materials have their own advantages such as low-cost, large-area and/or low temperature device fabrication based on solution processes. Such processes offer the possibility of depositing materials from solution, enabling patterning by, e.g., ink jet printing.7 The OFET devices consist of deposited conductors (gate, source, and drain electrodes), an insulator (SiO2 or plastics) and organic semiconductors. The thin-film transistor works as a switch between on and off states. When a bias is applied to the gate electrode, the gate is biased negatively or positively to induce hole or electron transport, respectively, in the organic semiconductor layers. This movement of holes or electrons is termed p-channel or n-channel transport, respectively. In order for OFETs to be used in driving circuits for display applications, they need to exhibit high carrier output, good switching speed, and high contrast between the on and off states. These characteristics are related to several important parameters, namely, charge-carrier field effect mobility (μ), threshold voltage (Vth), sub-threshold voltage (S), and on/off current ratio (ION/IOFF). In OFETs, the device performance is affected by factors such as grain size, depth of grain boundary, contact resistance between organic semiconductors and electrodes, and the interface between insulators and organic semiconductors. Annealing processes, surface treatment of the dielectric layer, and variation of the deposition rate have been widely used to control the molecular order of the active thin film layer. Thus, the mobility of pentacene OFETs has been improved dramatically and now it exceeds that of amorphous SiH.4Advances in OFET technology have typically focused on development of organic materials with high charge carrier mobility or solution processability. Solution processability is key to realizing low-cost, large-area electronic products on flexible substrates. In order to form OFETs from solution, the materials have to be soluble and be able to form uniform, large-area films, in which semiconducting materials are well ordered. There are three classes of solution processable organic semiconductors: type A, polymeric semiconductors; type B, small molecules with solubilizing groups; and type C, small molecules with thermally or photochemically removable groups.In general, polymeric materials are suitable for use in a solution process, because they tend to form amorphous thin films in most cases. For example, conjugated polymers have been extensively studied as OLED materials but their carrier mobilities are too low to be applicable to OFETs. Recently, polymeric materials 1–4, which have a microcrystalline morphology with strong π–π interaction have been prepared to increase the carrier mobility in OFETs, as shown in Chart 1. The mobilities of the polymer OFETs are now >0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.8–11 Chart 1  Recently developed polymer semiconductors for OFETs. However, the efficiency of polymeric materials as semiconductors is still lower than that of small molecules such as 5–14 in Chart 2.2–6,12–30 Small molecules afford polycrystalline thin films by vacuum deposition, which results in a reliable and efficient OFET. Vacuum deposited pentacene (5), a typical semiconducting small molecule, affords an OFET with very high mobility of >1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.14–19 For high carrier mobility, π-orbital overlap between adjacent molecules is important. The majority of unsubstituted acenes crystallize in herringbone structures, in which molecules minimize π-orbital repulsion by adopting an edge-to-face arrangement, forming a two-dimensional layer. If the face-to-face arrangement can be attained by the introduction of substituents, carrier mobilities will be improved compared to the corresponding unsubstituted (and insoluble) acenes. The introduction of substituents, however, frequently lowers performance below that of their insoluble, vacuum-deposited counterparts, because (1) substituents inhibit π–π stacking of molecules and therefore inhibit charge transfer between molecules; and (2) solubilizing groups often consist of insulating hydrocarbons, which can lower the overall conductivity of materials.2 So far only a few films prepared from solutions of substituted acenes have been reported to show mobilities higher than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Chart 2.3,20–23 Now it is a challenge to develop small molecules which exhibit high mobility and are suitable for a solution process. Chart 2  Recently developed organic semiconductors of small molecules for OFETs. In this paper, we report our strategy to develop small molecules of type C, rendered soluble by the presence of solubilizing groups, which are removed after spin-coating or printing by a thermal or photochemical process. Compared to thin films of type A or B, thin films of type C are ideal for device fabrication, for such semiconductors become insoluble after conversion from precursor films. Thus, development of type C semiconductors, whose OFETs display good performance such as high mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1), high on/off current ratio (>105), low Vth, and good durability, is a goal worth pursuing. After mentioning thiophene derivatives and acene compounds, we discuss in detail the OFET properties of spun-cast films of porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives created using this method.2 Thiophene derivatives2.1 Solution processable thiophene oligomersThiophene polymers and oligomers are among the most promising organic semiconductors.2,12,13,31–37 As described in the introduction, polythiophenes have been thoroughly studied as solution processable materials for OFETs, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and so on (Chart 1).31 Thiophene oligomers, particularly α,ω-dihexyl- and α,ω-diethylsexithiophenes (11a and 11b), have also been reported to exhibit carrier mobilities as high as 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Chart 2), but due to their limited solubility they require vacuum deposition to form thin films.27 Since there have been many reports on solution processable oligothiophenes and their applications in OFETs, OPVs, and so on,2,12,13,32–37 we will only focus on a series of oligothiophenes containing thermally removable solubilizing groups.Fréchet and co-workers have reported thiophene oligomers (tetramer to heptamer: 15a–e) with branched secondary esters at the α- and ω-positions of the oligomers, as shown in Scheme 1.38–41 After spin-casting films from chloroform onto SiO2, the solubilizing groups could be removed via an ester thermolysis reaction by heating to give thiophene oligomers, 16a–e. The reported carrier mobilities were 0.02–0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1. Scheme 1 2.2 Isothianaphthene oligomersIsothianaphthene (17a: ITN) is an important unit of polyisothianaphthene, a well-known low-band-gap conducting polymer.42–44 Because of its o-benzoquinodimethane structure, ITN is unstable due to its high reactivity at the 1- and 3-positions,45 and there have been limited reports on the synthesis of poly- and oligo-ITN compounds.42–44,46–55 In 2002, Ono and co-workers reported a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene(BCOD)-ring fused thiophene, namely 4,7-dihydro-4,7-ethano-2-benzo[c]thiophene (18a: BCOD-ITN), as a synthon of 1,3-unsubstituted ITN (17a),56 according to the synthetic scheme shown in Scheme 2. Compound 18a was prepared from 2-bromothiophene (19) in 6 steps. Ono and co-workers have reported the synthesis of the ITN oligomers 17a–c (n = 1–3), α,ω-diformyl ITN oligomers 25a–c (n = 1–3), and the α,ω-dicyano ITN dimer 27 from their corresponding BCOD-fused precursors, 18a–c (n = 1–3), 26a–c (n =1–3), and 28, respectively, as shown in Scheme 3. A retro-Diels–Alder reaction was carried out at 270–280 °C for 10–15 min. The reactivity was relatively low compared to that of BCOD-fused pyrrole. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the precursors, 26a–c and 28, and ITN oligomers, 25a–c and 27, are shown in Fig. 1.57 The absorption spectra of the ITN oligomers showed a bathochromic shift of 102 nm for 25a, 117 nm for 25b, 150 nm for 25c, and 118 nm for 27 compared to the corresponding precursors 26a–c and 28, respectively. The ITN precursors could be used as building blocks of core-modified porphyrins, as described in section 4.

But in order to utilize the pentacene itself, the soluble pentacene precursors, which can be easily converted to pentacene on substrates, have shown promise. Some Diels–Alder adducts of pentacene have been utilized for this purpose.58–68The first precursor based on this concept, 29, was reported by Müllen and co-workers.58,59 The leaving group was tetrachlorobenzene and the carrier mobility was 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. An IBM group has reported some N-sulfinylamide adducts of pentacenes, namely 30a and 30b.60,69 The retro-Diels–Alder reaction of such adducts gave pentacene, yielding the highest mobility in a pentacene film prepared by a solution process, 0.89 cm2 V−1 s−1. Recently a CO adduct, 31, of pentacene was reported by Chow and co-workers (Table 1). The leaving group was a CO molecule and the weight loss was only 9%, but the mobility was merely 8.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.68 Diels–Alder adducts of pentacene with thiophosgene, 32,64 and azodicarboxylate diesters, 33,65 have also been reported as pentacene precursors (Table 1), but the mobilities of pentacene films prepared from solutions of these precursors are unknown.

By contrast, photochemical conversion of precursors to pentacene would have the advantage of conversion at ambient temperature, allowing flexible plastics to be used as substrates. Furthermore, light patterning of substrates could be possible.70 Afzali et al. have reported photothermal patterning of pentacene by photopolymerization of pentacene-linked monomers, 34, followed by a retro-Diels–Alder reaction to separate pentacene from polymers (Table 1).61 The mobility was 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ION/IOFF was 2 × 105. Hamers and co-workers have reported that precursor 30b is photopatternable in the presence of a photoacid generator (PAG), as shown in Table 1.62 The mobility was 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ION/IOFF was 8 × 104. The resulting pentacene films included impurities, such as polymers or PAGs, which might have lowered their mobilities.The direct photoconversion of precursors to pentacene was reported by our group.71,72 A 1,2-diketone precursor (35) of pentacene was prepared by two routes, as shown in Scheme 4. Route A was a preparation starting from the reaction of tetraene 36 with benzyne, followed by oxidations. Route B started from the Diels–Alder reaction of pentacene with vinylenecarbonate, with subsequent deprotection and Swern oxidation. The diketone precursor of pentacene had an n–π* absorption at 460 nm and could be converted to pentacene quantitatively in solution and as a film by photoirradiation at the n–π* absorption wavelength. The leaving groups were two carbon monoxide molecules, comprising 17 wt% of the precursor molecule (Table 1). When a toluene solution of the diketone precursor was irradiated under argon, generation of pentacene and corresponding disappearance of diketone was monitored by the change in absorption spectra at the beginning of the reaction. After a while, pentacene started to precipitate because of its low solubility in toluene. The absorption spectra during the photoirradiation of the n–π* absorption of the diketone at 463 nm are shown in Fig. 2. During photoirradiation, the n–π* absorption of the diketone moiety decreased, while the typical absorption of pentacene began to be observed. After 25 min, the pentacene absorption started to decrease because it precipitated from solution. Photoconversion was also successful in a film. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of a film before and after irradiation are shown in Fig. 3. The OFET performance of the pentacene film prepared by spin-coating of the precursor and subsequent photoirradiation is shown in Fig. 4. The device was fabricated as a top-contact structure on highly doped n-type SiO2 (500 nm) after treatment with methylsilsesquioxane (MSQ). The carrier mobility of the film was 0.34 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ION/IOFF was 2 × 106.73 Scheme 4  Fig. 2  The change of the absorption spectra during the photolysis (λex = 463 nm) of α-diketone 35 in toluene under Ar atmosphere.

Fig. 4  Id–Vd curve of a pentacene film prepared by the solution process of precursor 35. The n–π* absorption of the diketone precursor overlapped the π–π* absorption of pentacene, so both the precursor and pentacene absorbed radiation, and singlet oxygen was generated by energy transfer from the triplet excited state of pentacene. The reactivity of pentacene with singlet oxygen to give the 6,13-peroxide is extremely high, so device manufacture involving pentacene has to be carried out under an inert gas. Yamada et al. have also reported the diketone precursors71,74,75 of air-stable 2,6-dianthrylanthracene (40a)71 and 2,6-dithiophenylanthracene(40b).76 The photocleavage reaction proceeded similarly under oxygen and argon when only the n–π* absorption was excited, without generating the 6,13-peroxide. The authors also succeeded in patterning using a mask during photoirradiation in air.75 Neckers and co-workers have prepared diketone precursors of hexacene77 and heptacene78 (41 and 42), applying synthetic route A of pentacene (Scheme 4). Because of their instability towards oxygen and their low solubility in common organic solvents, hexacene and heptacene were not isolated. The photocleavage reaction was detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectra and absorption spectra in a PMMA matrix (Chart 3).

For example, chlorophyll (containing Mg) is a key component in photosynthesis and heme (containing Fe) regulates oxygen transfer in hemoglobin. Development of porphyrin-based organic electronics may lead to totally biocompatible, inexpensive electronic devices. Mechanically and electrically stable phthalocyanines (Pcs) and their films are resistant to solvents and repetitive thermal stress; they are widely used as photoconductors in laser printers and as electronic materials. Organic synthesis leads to substitutions at their cores and periphery for particular applications. Comprehensive handbooks on the synthesis, structure, properties and applications of porphyrins and Pcs are available.79 Among the many known porphyrins and related compounds, tetrabenzoporphyrins (43, MTBPs), MPcs (44), and fluorinated Pcs (45, F16MPcs) shown in Chart 4 are particularly useful as p- or n-type semiconductors for OLEDs, OFETs and OPVs, since they accept or donate electrons easily due to their large π-electron frameworks. As they are more stable toward light and heat than acenes or oligothiophenes, they hold greater promise for practical applications in electronics. Chart 4  Benzoporphyrins (MTBPs), phthalocyanines (Pcs), and fluorinated phthalocyanines (F16MPcs). Pcs are promising active materials for OFETs due to their stability, and have been studied widely for a long time. Among various metal complexes CuPc and NiPc show better mobility than other MPcs, but they are as low as 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1,80 too low for use in display applications. Much effort has been expended on improving the performance of OFETs based on Pcs. Thin films obtained by a sandwich type device consisting of two kinds of Pc metal complexes displayed a mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1.81 The mobility of an OFET based on single-crystal CuPc was 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest value reported so far for Pc-based OFETs.82 Strong π-orbital overlap existed along the b axis of CuPc crystals.Fine control of crystal structures in thin films is crucial to improving the performance of OFETs. Efforts to control Pcs and related compounds using the LB technique or discotic liquid crystals have been extensive, but the resulting mobilities were usually in the range of 10−3 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.83 A recent report of an OFET based on amphiphilic rare earth triple decker complexes with tris(Pcs), 46, showed a remarkably high mobility of 0.24–0.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 because of intramolecular π–π stacking and intermolecular J aggregation in the LB film, as shown in Fig. 5.84 Fig. 5  Schematic molecular structure of the triple-decker compounds and the device. Fluorinated copper phthalocyanine (45, F16CuPc) is one of the few molecules exhibiting air-stable n-channel semiconducting behavior. The OFET mobility was 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a thin film fabricated on SiO2 by vapor deposition.85The structure of the F16CuPc film on SiO2 depended on its thickness, which could be controlled by the deposition rate and temperature.86 This suggested that the mobility in OFETs based on Pcs could be improved by suitable choice of fabrication technique. High-performance air stable n-type OFETs based on single crystalline submicro- and nanometer ribbons of F16CuPc have been reported, whose mobility was 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.87 Such ribbons could be grown in situ by a physical vapor transport technique on the surface of Si/SiO2 substrates during synthesis.4.2 Synthesis of soluble precursorsAs TBP and Pcs, being pigments, are generally insoluble in organic solvents, soluble precursors are required to allow their use in fabrication by solution processes. BCOD-fused porphyrins (47, MCPs), soluble precursors of TBPs, were prepared from BCOD-fused pyrrole 48a in about 50% yield by a standard method (LiAlH4, H+, oxidation), as shown in Scheme 5.88–90 As CP was soluble in organic solvents, it could be purified by column chromatography to give a pure sample (99.9%, estimated by HPLC), which was converted to pure TBP in quantitative yield by heating at 180–200 °C. Thus, insoluble TBP was prepared in a highly pure form by this thermal process. Thermal analyses (with heating at 10 °C min−1) of the conversion process from CP to TBP are shown in Fig. 6. The conversion took place between 150 and 200 °C. The decrease in mass corresponded to elimination of four ethylene molecules, demonstrating quantitative conversion from 2HCP to 2HTBP. The conversion seemed to proceed in two or three steps, judging from the multiple exothermic peaks observed. Scheme 5  Fig. 6  Thermogravimetric analysis (left axis) and differential thermal analysis (right axis) of conversion process from CP (47) to TBP (43). This strategy was very convenient for the preparation of pigments such as MTBP and MPc in a highly pure state without purification steps. The requisite BCOD-fused pyrroles were prepared by the Diels–Alder reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene 49 with β-(phenylsulfonyl)nitroethylene (51a)91 to give adduct 52a followed by the reaction with ethyl isocyanoacetate (Barton–Zard reaction, BZ reaction).89,92 This process was later improved by the use of (E)-1,2-bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene (51b)93 prior to the BZ reaction (Scheme 6).94,95 (Z)-1,2-Bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene96 was also effective for this purpose. The Diels–Alder reaction of sulfonylacetylene 53 along with a subsequent BZ reaction was the simplest way to the requisite pyrrole.97 Combinations of 1,3-cyclohexadienes with various dienophiles and sulfonylation afforded substituted BCOD-fused pyrroles, regarded as masked isoindoles as shown in Scheme 6.98 Scheme 6 Using 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene (59) instead of 49, the more soluble TBP precursor 62 was prepared, whose solubility was more than 100 times higher than that of 47 in methanol and 60 times higher in n-hexane (Scheme 7).99 This higher solubility will increase the likelihood of the solution process finding industrial use because such precursors can be dissolved in non-chlorinated solvents. Scheme 7 Pure [2,3]naphthoporphyrin, 66, was also prepared by the retro-Diels–Alder strategy from the precursor 65 (Scheme 8).100 The reaction of the tripyrrane 67 with diformylheterocycles 68 afforded the corresponding heteroporphyrins 69, which were easily converted into tetrabenzoheteroporphyrins 70 by a retro-Diels–Alder reaction, as shown in Scheme 9.101,102 Using this procedure, heteroporphyrins 70, carbaporphyrin 71, and azuliporphyrin 72 could also be prepared. Scheme 8  Scheme 9 The condensation of BCOD-fused tripyrrane with appropriate pyrrole dialdehydes and the subsequent retro-Diels–Alder reaction afforded acenaphthotribenzoporphyrin 74 and fluoranthene-fused TBP 76 (Scheme 10).95 The absorptions of these new porphyrins were very intense at both Soret and Q band regions as shown in Fig. 7, where the solid lines show the UV-Vis spectra of precursors 73 and 75, and the bold lines those of corresponding π-expanded porphyrins 74 and 76, respectively. The absorptions of 74 and 76 covered a wide wavelength range, indicating that they were good candidates for use as dyes for OPVs. Yamada et al. have prepared 5,15-dialkynyl BCOD-fused porphyrin 79 and 5-alkenyl-15-alkynyl BCOD-fused porphyrin 80 by a [2 + 2] condensation reaction. Glaser–Hey coupling of porphyrin 82 gave butadiyne-linked BCOD-fused porphyrin dimer 83 which was converted to benzoporphyrin dimer 84 (Scheme 11). This dimer absorbed over a wide wavelength range, compared to its precursor 83, as shown in Fig. 8.103 The Osuka group has developed meso–meso, β–β, β–β triply linked porphyrin arrays, 85 and 86. (Scheme 12).104 Dibenzoporphyrin dimer 86 has an enlarged π-electronic network, and therefore exhibited extremely red-shifted absorption spectra (λmax = 1150 nm) and a large two-photon absorption cross section (15400 GM). These phenomena have shown a promise of being useful in optoelectronic applications.

Scheme 11  Fig. 8  UV-Vis spectra of 83 (solid line) and 84 (bold line) in DMF.  Scheme 12 The retro-Diels–Alder strategy was extended to the synthesis of MPcs 89 and related compounds 90 as demonstrated in Scheme 13. TG analysis of an Mg complex of the BCOD-fused MPc verified the expected retro-Diels–Alder reaction with loss of 20% of the total mass, corresponding to a loss of four ethylene units and two of H2O. This reaction initiated at 200 °C and was complete by 250 °C (Fig. 9). Thus, pure naphthalocyanine was prepared by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of soluble precursors 87, opening a new way to solution processable pigment semiconductors.105 A soluble BCOD-fused tetra(pyrazino)tetraazaporphyrin 88 was prepared by the reaction of BCOD-fused dicyanopyrazine. The retro-Diels–Alder reaction of 88 gave tetra(quinoxalino)tetraazaporphyrin 90 in quantitative yield, which was a good candidate for an n-type organic semiconductor.106 Scheme 13  Fig. 9  Thermogravimetric analysis of conversion process from precursor 87 to naphthalocyanine 89. 4.3 OFETs by solution processingSpin-coating of 2HCP followed by heating at 210 °C afforded 2HTBP thin films, which could be used as semiconductors for OFETs (Scheme 5).The electronic properties of the 2HTBP thin film were studied by CV, which gave Eox = 0.43 V and Ered = −1.77 V (both vs. Ag/Ag+), corresponding to a HOMO energy level of 5.08 eV and LUMO energy level of 2.89 eV. The HOMO–LUMO gap determined by CV data was consistent with the value of 2.2 eV estimated from the absorption spectra of this film. The proposed band structures of a 2HTBP OFET based on these values are as shown in Fig. 10. From gate-to-source in Fig. 10(a), holes accumulated at the SiO2/TBP interface for a gate electrode biased negatively relative to the source. Similarly, from drain-to-source in Fig. 10(b), holes in the channel traveled from source to drain when the drain was biased negatively relative to the source.107 Fig. 10  Proposed energy band diagrams for a 2HTBP OFET with Au S/D electrodes.

(b) Drain to source.104 Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of 2HCP and 2HTBP are shown in Fig. 11.108 2HCP films were amorphous, but once converted to 2HTBP, the films displayed distinct needle-shaped crystallites. Thus, polycrystalline 2HTBP thin films were readily obtained by spin-coating 2HCP and subsequent heating. Fig. 11  A STEM bright-field image of an amorphous 2HCP precursor film and a thermally annealed, polycrystalline 2HTBP film. The 2HTBP OFETs were fabricated in either coplanar (bottom-contact) or staggered (top-contact) device structures. The Aramaki group first used bottom-contact devices for a TBP OFET as shown in Fig. 12.109 Source and drain electrodes were formed by photolithography of Au (90 nm)/Cr (10 nm) on top of 300 nm thermally-grown SiO2 on heavily doped n-type Si. The standard channel length was 10 μm and the channel width 500 μm. The semiconductor thin film was prepared by heating a spun-cast thin film of CP at 210 °C for 5 min. The I–V characteristics of the OFETs are shown in Fig. 13.110 The mobility, threshold voltage, and ION/IOFF were determined from the data of Fig. 13 as follows: μ = 0.017 cm2 V−1 s−1, Vth = −0.3 V, and ION/IOFF = 1 × 105.110 The mobility of the 2HTBP OFET was 10 times better than that of an 2HPc OFET deposited under vacuum: μ = 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (30 °C), and 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (120 °C). A TBP-OFET was also fabricated by vacuum deposition at 10−6 Torr at various temperatures, and gave μ = 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 25 °C, 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 80 °C, and 5.6 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 150 °C. These results clearly showed that spin-coated and thermally converted thin film led to better OFET performance than vacuum deposited OFETs.

An AFM image of the converted film is shown in Fig. 14.110 The 2HCP film was amorphous and its surface quite smooth. After conversion, the surface of the film became rough with many cracks, because the thickness of the film was reduced by 20%. Therefore, this film was not suitable for a top gate device structure, because smoothness at the interface between the semiconductor and the insulator is important for OFET performance. Fig. 14  AFM Image of the 2HTBP film. The mobility of the 2HTBP OFET was dependent on the channel length, as shown in Fig. 15.110 The dependence was opposite to that of other OFETs such as pentacene OFETs, in which the semiconductor near the electrode was assumed to be inferior. In the case of 2HTBP, the grain boundary was an important factor governing mobility. Short channels had few grain boundaries, increasing mobility. Fig. 15  Mobility of a 2HTBP OFET as a function of channel length. Kanicki and co-workers have studied 2HTBP OFETs using the staggered (top-contact) S/D electrodes shown in Fig. 16.108 All processing except thermal annealing and evaporation was done in air. Compared to bottom contact S/D electrodes, this type of top contact S/D electrode avoided the problem of high contact resistance due to poor step coverage over the S/D electrodes, or poor adhesion of the metal to the organic semiconductors. Poor step coverage introduces morphological discontinuities in the organic semiconductor near the electrode. The authors discussed a possible relation between thin-film microstructure and OFET behavior in terms of nonlinearity in the extraction of the device’s electrical parameters. They concluded that 2HTBP formed channel regions with a degree of crystallinity higher than their organic polymer counterparts. The nature of 2HTBP was more comparable to that of micro- and poly-crystalline silicon TFTs. Fig. 16  (a) Top view of a 2HTBP OFET displaying the polycrystalline thin film and source and drain electrodes. The chemical structure of the TBP molecule is also shown. (b) A schematic view of the staggered source and drain electrode configuration used in this study. Many organic semiconductors, including 2HTBP, exhibit environmental drawbacks. Exposure of the 2HTBP OFET to ambient atmosphere leads to significant changes, namely, increase in overall conductivity, lower ION/IOFF, and larger sub-threshold swing. However, thermal annealing under N2 or vacuum regains most of the original performance. In order to minimize O2 and H2O exposure, fabrication and testing are carried out in an inert environment, or OFET devices are over-coated with impermeable materials.111After conversion from a precursor thin film, 2HTBP becomes insoluble, making it ideal for post-processing steps such as metallization or encapsulation. For example, 2HTBP OFETs are coated with a soluble n-type semiconductor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as shown in Fig. 17.112 The top coating extends the lifetime of the device in that the field-effect mobility, sub-threshold slope, and off-state current are maintained at their as-fabricated states for a long time. Fig. 17  A schematic view of PCBM-coated 2HTBP OFET. OFETs incorporating metal porphyrins such as CuTBP113 or NiTBP114 were also fabricated by a solution process using the corresponding soluble precursors, and offered better performance than those using TBP itself. XRD patterns from drop-cast NiCP and NiTBP thin films are shown in Fig. 18, which shows that the pattern for drop-cast NiCP displayed no measurable peaks. Upon heating, numerous diffraction peaks appeared, indicative of the formation of crystal planes. XRD spectra from both drop-cast and NiTBP powder were used to define the NiTBP unit cell via the Pawley and Rietveld powder refinement methods combined with Pareto optimization both to match the experimental XRD spectra and to minimize the potential energy. The unit cell was monoclinic with P21/n symmetry (Fig. 19). Fig. 18  XRD spectra of NiTBP and NiCP powders and thin films.  Fig. 19  Proposed molecular structure of the monoclinic NiTBP unit cell. The output characteristics of NiTBP OFETs are shown in Fig. 20 from which it could be determined that the mobility of this transistor was on the order of 0.1 and 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in the linear and saturation regimes. These were the highest values among solution processed OFETs using porphyrins or Pcs as semiconductors. OFETs based on CuTBP exhibited a similar performance with mobility 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. A polarized optical micrograph of a spun-cast CuTBP thin film is shown in Fig. 21, displaying its polycrystalline nature. The electrodes seen there were 20 μm wide, indicating that CuTBP formed domains of approximately equal size. By comparison, NiTBP formed crystals with size approaching 1 μm,114 and TBP on the order of 2 μm in diameter.109 Fig. 20  Output characteristics for a NiTBP OFET.  Fig. 21  Polarized optical micrograph of a continuous, spun-cast CuTBP thin-film on thermally oxidized c-Si. The electrodes in the figure are 20 μm wide. Solution processed 2HTBP OFETs were fabricated using precursor 2HCP, deposited on a thermal SiO2 gate insulator patterned with nanometer-scale trenches. Thermal conversion of 2HCP to 2HTBP was enhanced by ordered TBP aggregation in the prepatterned trenches (Fig. 22). OFETs with channels parallel to trench direction growth were found to have carrier mobility approaching one order of magnitude greater than transistors fabricated with the channel oriented perpendicular to dendrite growth.115 Fig. 22  (a) Schematic cross section of nanostructured TBP OFETs and (b) top view schematic of nanostructured OFETs structures. Both fractal and micrometer-scale ordered nanorod aggregation were observed in precursor-route TBP thin films deposited on bare SiO2, as shown in Fig. 23(a) and (b).115 Thinner regions of the same film, with sparser surface coverage, displayed fractal aggregation. For a thin film with denser surface coverage, nanorod-type aggregation was predominant. Typical rod-shaped TBP aggregates were 60 nm wide and 300 nm long. AFM height micrographs of a TBP thin film are shown in Fig. 23(c) and (d). Upon thermal conversion of 2HCP, 2HTBP demonstrated preferential alignment along the trench direction.

The axes dimensions are (a) 3 μm, (b) 2 μm, (c) 2.2 μm and (d) 25.2 μm. Samples in (c) and (d) have a trench periodicity of 450 nm and a trench depth of 10 nm. 4.4 Thin film organic solar cellsPorphyrins and Pcs tend to aggregate face-to-face through π–π stacking interactions. Therefore they are ideal for electronic conduction and have been extensively used for plastic OP V−1 s−1.1,116–118 Generally, vacuum deposited Pcs are used for p-type semiconductors, but porphyrins have also been investigated.119–122 Shao and Yang have reported a heterojunction OPV fabricated by vacuum deposition of PtOEP and C60, as ITO|PEDOT|PtOEP|C60|BCP|Al. Its fill factor was 0.57 and power-conversion efficiency, 2.1%.123Soluble precursors of 2HTBP were used not only for OFETs but also for thin film organic solar cells. Spin-coating of soluble p- and n-type semiconductors provided a simple method for fabrication of solar cells, as illustrated in Fig. 24. 2HTBP films on ITO electrodes (ITO|2HTBP) were prepared by continuous spin-coating of a soluble precursor, 2HCP, on ITO electrodes followed by thermal conversion of 2HCP to 2HTBP by simply heating the electrodes. Photocurrent generation was observed using a three-electrode system with ITO|2HTBP as a working electrode, Pt as a counter electrode, Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode, and hexyl viologen (HV) as an electron acceptor. A two-layer structure of 2HTBP and PCBM films and a three-layer structure of films of 2HTBP, a 2HTBP-PCBM mixture, and PCBM on ITO electrodes were also prepared by spin-coating. IPCE values up to 7% were obtained for the three-layer structure. Action spectra of the three-layer structure showed that overall, visible light from 380 to 700 nm could be utilized to sensitize the photocurrent generation system.124 Fig. 24  Schematic diagram of photoenergy conversion system using 2HTBP and PCBM. Very recently, OPVs based on TBP films prepared by solution processing of CP followed by thermal conversion have been reported by Sato et al.,125 who prepared heterojunction and bulk heterojunction structures combining 2HTBP as a donor and fullerenes, PCBM and/or [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid n-butyl ester (PCBNB) as acceptors. In the p–n heterojunction structure, power energy conversion (η) was 2.2% and in the p–i–n structure the efficiency increased to η = 3%.5 ConclusionInsoluble small molecules (pigments) such as pentacene, TBP, or Pc could be used to fabricate thin film electronics by a solution process using their soluble precursors with thermally or photochemically removable groups. This technology has advantages over the conventional vacuum deposition of small molecules and solution processes involving soluble polymers or oligomers because of its simplicity and excellent performance. This soluble precursor route also offers the possibility of developing new conducting small molecules. For example, naphthalocyanines are unstable under the conditions of vacuum deposition, leading to difficulties in device production. However, the solution process involving soluble precursors makes the construction of OFET devices under mild conditions possible. Thus, this process not only holds promise for the creation of cheap, large-area, patternable, plastic devices, but also for the development of new semiconducting small molecules.
