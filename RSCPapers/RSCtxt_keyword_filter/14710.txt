    , Accepted 27th September 2012First published on 3rd October 2012AbstractWe demonstrate Schottky-barrier solar cells employing a stack of layer-structured semiconductor molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanomembranes, synthesized by the chemical-vapor-deposition method, as the critical photoactive layer. An MoS2 nanomembrane forms a Schottky-barrier with a metal contact by the layer-transfer process onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. Two vibrational modes in MoS2 nanomembranes, E12g (in-plane) and A1g (perpendicular-to-plane), were verified by Raman spectroscopy. With a simple stacked structure of ITO–MoS2–Au, the fabricated solar cell demonstrates a photo-conversion efficiency of 0.7% for ∼110 nm MoS2 and 1.8% for ∼220 nm MoS2. The improvement is attributed to a substantial increase in photonic absorption. The MoS2 nanomembrane exhibits efficient photo-absorption in the spectral region of 350–950 nm, as confirmed by the external quantum efficiency. A sizable increase in MoS2 thickness results in only minor change in Mott–Schottky behavior, indicating that defect density is insensitive to nanomembrane thickness attributed to the dangling-bond-free layered structure.
Introduction
Schottky-barrier solar cells have the appealing advantage of low-cost manufacture attributable to their simple and versatile fabrication process and thin-film-like structure (reduced active material consumption as compared with p–n or p–i–n junction bulk semiconductor solar cells). Schottky-barrier solar cells rely mostly on a single semiconductor material (either p-or n-type doped) in association with a metal, leading to energy barrier formation and carrier dissociation at the metal–semiconductor (M–S) interface. Various M–S material systems have been used in Schottky-barrier solar cells, including Al–amorphous carbon nitride,1 Au, Al, Mg and Ca–PbSe quantum dots,2 Al–SnS,3 and Au–GaAs.4 Recently, carbon derivatives have attracted attention due to their promising optical/electrical properties. Schottky junctions made by carbon nanotube–CdSe,5 graphene–CdS nanowire,6 graphene, carbon nanotube–Si,7,8 and graphene–Si nanowire9–11 have been reported. In general, M–S interfacial behavior and carrier mobility/photon absorption in the semiconductor material are key factors that impact the overall performance of Schottky-barrier solar cells. While a group of semiconductors such as boron doped diamond,12 GaAs,13,14 InP,15 SiGe,16 GaP,17 GaN,18 and SiC19 can be used, the design of an M–S system with appropriate material work function difference is an essential factor to determine the Schottky-barrier height and efficiency of carrier separation.
The development of Schottky-barrier solar cells has been decelerated over the past decade due to several fundamental material challenges, including interfacial oxide layer formation and Fermi-level pinning caused by interfacial states (which are inevitable at M–S interfaces).20–24
While poor interface properties play a substantial role in the impeded improvement of energy-conversion efficiency, searching for a new class of semiconductor materials free of interfacial states (hence without Fermi level pinning) would be of strategic significance to the ultimate realization of highly efficient Schottky-barrier solar cells.
Transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors exhibit two dimensional (2D) layered lattice structures with strong in-plane covalent bonds and weak interlayer van der Waals interaction. Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), a layered semiconductor, has recently attracted attention in the fields of nanoelectronics,25–30 energy storage31–33 and photovoltaics.34 Nanosheets of monolayer or multilayer MoS2 can be obtained via mechanical or chemical exfoliation,35,36 similar to the way graphene is produced. Recently, direct assembly of MoS2 nanosheets on SiO2 by the chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) method has been demonstrated.37 MoS2 exhibits direct energy bandgap (∼1.85 eV) in monolayer and indirect bandgap (∼1.3 eV) in multilayer/bulk form, respectively.38 On electronic properties, it has been recently reported that MoS2 shows carrier mobility values of ∼200 cm2 V−1 s−1 in monolayer and ∼517 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a few layers, suggesting promising conducting capacity.39,40 Most importantly, the unique structure of layered semiconductors provides inherent advantages of forming a smooth surface free of any dangling chemical bonds, potentially enabling the design of highly efficient Schottky-barrier solar cells. Various metal contacts, including Ag, Al, Au, Co and Fe, have been investigated for the formation of Schottky-barriers with MoS2 bulk crystals. No Fermi level pinning was observed even for a high density of material defect (∼1014 cm−3).41
In this paper we demonstrate solar cells employing a layer-structured semiconductor MoS2 nanomembrane–metal (Au) Schottky barrier. The CVD-assembled MoS2 nanomembrane also functions as the key photo-active layer. The solar cells are made by a simple stack structure of ITO–MoS2–Au. Basic material properties of MoS2, major solar cell device performance metrics, and the impact of MoS2 nanomembrane thickness are discussed. The MoS2–Au Schottky-barrier interface is characterized by capacitance vs. voltage (C–V) measurements.
Experimental section
Large-area (up to several square centimeters) semiconductor MoS2 nanomembranes were synthesized by the CVD approach. Fig. 1(a) is the schematic of the CVD growth furnace system showing Ar as a carrier gas and a sulphur (S) source flowing towards a molybdenum (Mo)-coated Si–SiO2 substrate (where vapor–solid reaction occurs to assemble the MoS2 nanomembrane). CVD growth of MoS2 silicon coated with 100 nm of SiO2 was used as the substrate for the pre-deposition of Mo. A thin Mo metal layer was deposited with an approximate thickness of 50 nm by the electron-beam evaporation method. The CVD growth process started with flowing Ar of 200 sccm in the quartz-tube chamber with a pressure level of ∼1 Torr. The furnace was subsequently heated up to 750 °C and stabilized over one hour. Pure S powder, placed upstream in the chamber, was heated to just above its melting temperature (∼115 °C). The S vapor flowed over the Mo thin film pre-deposited on the SiO2–Si substrate for approximately 30 minutes. Vapor–solid reaction took place at an elevated temperature (∼750 °C), leading to the growth of an MoS2 nanomembrane driven by increase in enthalpy. While the Mo–Mo bond is relatively weak (metallic in nature), the Mo–S bond is a strong ionic one and therefore more thermodynamically stable. As the temperature increases, Mo atoms gain sufficient thermal energy (exceeding the activation energy) and make covalent bonds with S atoms. After the completion of CVD growth, the sample was annealed at 1000 °C for one hour to improve the crystalline quality and the uniformity of the resultant nanomembrane. The major steps in the MoS2 layer transfer sequence are depicted in Fig. 1(b) starting from the Si–SiO2 substrate, Mo metal deposition, MoS2 growth, and transfer to the target substrate in which the solar cells were fabricated.

(e) Free-floating MoS2 nanomembrane in KOH to be transferred onto an ITO-coated glass substrate for solar cell fabrication. 
The CVD-assembled MoS2 nanomembrane was transferred from the growth substrate (SiO2–Si) to an indium tin oxide (ITO – serving as transparent electrode) coated device substrate, involving a wet chemistry etching step of the SiO2 layer in the growth substrate to yield a freestanding MoS2 nanomembrane in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. Fig. 1(c)–(e) show the optical images of the process to separate the MoS2 nanomembrane from SiO2–Si substrate. The MoS2 nanomembrane was transferred onto the transparent conducting oxide (ITO) substrate to fabricate the Schottky-barrier solar cell. KOH solution with a concentration of 15 M was prepared in which the MoS2–Si–SiO2 substrate was immersed to etch away the SiO2. A slow and smooth KOH etching of SiO2 released the MoS2 nanomembrane partially from the Si substrate. Within approximately 10 minutes a completely free-floating MoS2 nanomembrane in KOH solution was obtained. The thickness of the MoS2 nanomembrane is determined by that of the Mo film deposited by electron beam evaporation (it is hence scalable). The surface morphology and thickness of the as-grown MoS2 nanomembrane was characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, dimension 3100). Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Scientific) with a laser of 532 nm was performed on the samples to confirm the growth of MoS2via identified vibrational modes.
After transferring the MoS2 nanomembrane onto the ITO-coated glass substrate, deposition of 50 nm of Au contact was made by electron-beam evaporation to form a Schottky-barrier (with MoS2). The J–V characteristics of the solar cell were measured under both dark and standard AM 1.5 illumination conditions using an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer. An Xe arc lamp was used to simulate the solar light. The EQE characteristics of the solar cells were measured in the wavelength range of 350–950 nm using a Newport monochromator (equipped with the same Xe arc lamp that was used to measure the J–V characteristics). The C–V measurement was performed on the solar cell using a B1520A-FG Multi Frequency Capacitance Measurement Unit Module attached to an Agilent B1500A using a frequency of 1 kHz and AC perturbation of 10 mV at room temperature.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) is the micrograph showing the surface morphology of an MoS2 nanomembrane after being transferred onto the ITO substrate, as obtained from the 2D mapping measurement of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The AFM line-scan was carried out, from point A to point B as shown in Fig. 2(a), to measure the physical thickness of the MoS2 nanomembrane. The step height between MoS2 and the ITO substrate, as seen in Fig. 2(b), confirmed the thickness of the MoS2 nanomembrane to be about 55 nm, an average value from the measured data. We believe that the as-grown MoS2 nanomembrane on the Si–SiO2 substrate in our CVD process is highly uniform in thickness, as reported by Y. Zhan et al. in a similar growth experiment.37 The variation in AFM line-scan data (approximately ±5 nm) could arise from deformation of the MoS2 nanomembrane as a result of the layer transfer process. We expect that micro-level wrinkles might have been formed on the MoS2 nanomembrane caused by various types of mechanical interactions during the wet chemistry etching and transferring process.

Material characterization using Raman spectroscopy was conducted on two transferred MoS2 nanomembrane samples with different physical thicknesses. While the as-assembled MoS2 exhibits an average thickness of ∼55 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b), stacked MoS2 nanomembranes were prepared via multiple (two and four, respectively, in our experiment) transfers.
The samples were subsequently used for Raman spectroscopic investigation. The expected thicknesses of the two samples are ∼110 nm (two transfers) and ∼220 nm (four transfers), respectively. Prior research results show that there is a significant difference in the signature modes in Raman spectra for monolayer, bilayer and few-layer MoS2.37 In our experiment, a much thicker stack of MoS2 was employed to enhance the photo-absorption in the Schottky-barrier solar cells. Fig. 3(a) shows the Raman spectra of the MoS2 nanomembrane samples with thicknesses of ∼110 nm and ∼220 nm, respectively. Two significant Raman active modes were identified at the wavenumbers of 383 cm−1 and 408 cm−1 which correspond to E12g and A1g modes respectively.

The samples were prepared by multiple transfers/stacking of CVD-grown MoS2. (b) Schematic showing the two Raman active modes corresponding to the signature peaks observed in MoS2. 

Fig. 3(b) displays schematically both E12g and A1g modes. In the E12g mode both Mo and S atoms vibrate along the in-plane direction (yet opposite to each other), whereas in the A1g mode the S atoms vibrate in the perpendicular-to-plane direction. The Raman signature peaks observed in our experiment confirm both in-plane and perpendicular-to-plane Raman active modes. As we used relatively thick MoS2 (>100 nm), there are no blue- and red-shifts for the E12g and A1g modes, different from that observed in monolayer/bilayer MoS2 nanomembranes.37 The significant variation in the peak intensity of Raman spectra, as observed in the two examined samples, was due to the substantial difference in physical thickness (∼100 nm).

Fig. 4(a) shows the schematic cross-sectional view of the MoS2 nanomembrane–Au Schottky-barrier solar cell. The MoS2 nanomembrane was transferred onto an ITO substrate (serving as the window layer through which the solar cell is illuminated). Fig. 4(b) shows the energy band diagram of the fabricated Schottky-barrier solar cell structure with a stack of ITO–MoS2–Au.

(b) Energy band diagram of the solar cell with formation of a Schottky-barrier between the MoS2 nanomembrane and Au metal contact. 
In general, if the metal work function is higher than that of the n-type semiconductor, then an ideal Schottky-barrier could be formed. In our experiment, Au (work function: ∼5.1 eV) forms a barrier on the MoS2 semiconductor (work function: ∼4.6 eV). The ITO used in this study is a heavily n-type doped transparent conductive oxide with a work function of ∼4.5 eV. It forms an almost perfect ohmic contact with the n-type doped MoS2 nanomembrane. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Fermi level of ITO is above the conduction band due to its heavily doped nature. Although layer-dependent optical properties (e.g., change of bandgap with number of layers) has been demonstrated in ultra-thin MoS2 (from a monolayer to six layers) as reported by K. F. Mak et al.,39 the bulk properties dominate in thicker stacks of MoS2. In our experiment, MoS2 nanomembrane stacks (∼110 nm and 220 nm) were used for the fabrication of solar cells. Therefore layer dependency of the optical bandgap becomes negligible. We consider the MoS2 stack with an optical bandgap of ∼1.3 eV which effectively absorbs photons in the wavelength region of 350–950 nm. The Schottky-barrier solar cells are illuminated through the ITO window layer which does not absorb any photons in the visible light spectral region, as its bandgap is ∼3.8 eV and more than 95% optically transparent.
Incident photons generate electron–hole pairs in the MoS2 nanomembrane and electrons are subsequently excited to the conduction band (EC) of MoS2. As the work function difference between Au and MoS2 results in a Schottky-barrier, the photo-excited electrons move from the EC of MoS2 towards the Fermi level of ITO (where they can be collected to the load). A larger work function difference between Au and n-type MoS2 would generate a higher electric field in the depletion region of MoS2. The built-in electric field facilitates the dissociation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs, transporting separated carriers towards ITO and Au contacts. The processes of photo-excitation in MoS2 and electron transport from MoS2 to ITO are demonstrated in Fig. 4(b).

Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the dark and illuminated J–V characteristics of the fabricated Schottky-barrier solar cells with MoS2 thicknesses of ∼110 nm and 220 nm, respectively. The output power as a function of voltage in each solar cell is shown in the insets of Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. For the Schottky-barrier solar cell with MoS2 thickness of 110 nm key metrics JSC (short-circuit current density), VOC (open-circuit voltage), PMAX (maximum power), FF (fill factor) and η (photo-conversion efficiency) are 2.52 mA cm−2, 590 mV, 1.22 × 10−4 W, 0.48 and 0.7%, respectively. For the solar cell with MoS2 thickness of ∼220 nm, JSC, VOC, PMAX, FF and η are 5.37 mA cm−2, 597 mV, 2.99 × 10−4 W, 0.55 and 1.8% respectively. It is observed that an increase of MoS2 thickness helps to significantly enhance JSC of the solar cell (by 113%) due to more efficient photo-absorption in the thicker MoS2 stack, and hence creates a noteworthy change in overall device performance. It should be noted that there is no sizable change in VOC between solar cells with different thicknesses of MoS2 stacks (merely 1% change). It is evident that an increase in thickness of the MoS2 stack would not cause a notable change in the band structure (hence no change in the Fermi level) due to the absence of layer-dependent properties.
 Fig. 5  Measured dark and illuminated J–V characteristics of the Schottky-barrier solar cells with a stack of MoS2 nanomembrane having thicknesses of (a) ∼110 nm and (b) ∼220 nm. Inset of each figure shows the power output as a function of voltage for the fabricated solar cell. (c) Recombination process via electron–hole capture by interfacial trap states present in conventional and layered semiconductors, showing significantly fewer traps in the latter. This leads to reduced probability of carrier recombination in a layered semiconductor. 

Fig. 5(c) shows the schematic to compare carrier recombination in conventional and layered semiconductors. Process 1 represents optical excitation leading to electron–hole pair generation. In conventional semiconductors, the amount of interface states (recombination centers) in the bandgap is huge due to unsaturated chemical dangling bonds which capture electrons from the conduction band (Process 2) and holes from the valence band (Process 3), leading to recombination. In layered semiconductors, the amount of interface states is significantly less due to the self-saturated surface bonds which do not actively participate in the recombination process. Thus, we attribute the enhancement in solar cell performance to the increase in MoS2 thickness which improved photon absorption. We expect that as a layered material, defect density in MoS2 does not increase drastically with increasing thickness compared to a conventional semiconductor.

Fig. 6 shows External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two Schottky-barrier solar cells with different MoS2 thicknesses in the wavelength range of 350–950 nm. The maximum EQE values of 41% and 52% were measured for solar cells with ∼110 nm and ∼220 nm of MoS2 stack, respectively, at wavelength of 600 nm. The increase in MoS2 thickness plays a vital role in photo-absorption. Our prior work on MoS2-based solar cells34 employing a combination of monolayer/multi-layer stacks of MoS2 on TiO2 (serving as electron acceptor) has shown photon absorption of MoS2 in the wavelength region of 350–750 nm. The measured EQE spectra in the extended wavelength region, as compared with the previously reported values (up to ∼950 nm),34 suggests that an MoS2 nanomembrane with an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV could effectively absorb photons in both visible and near infrared spectral regions due to the absence of the layer-dependent optical properties of MoS2 as governed by its physical thickness.

Fig. 7(a) shows the Mott–Schottky (C−2–V) characteristics of the Schottky-barrier solar cells. The C−2–V characteristics were used to estimate the Schottky-barrier heights associated with each of the two fabricated solar cells. Fig. 7(b) shows schematically the energy-level alignment at the MoS2–Au interface under zero, forward and reverse voltage bias conditions. Since the MoS2 samples are n-type doped, Fermi levels in MoS2 and Au shift upwards and downwards, respectively, with reference to the equilibrium Fermi level at zero voltage bias, yielding the maximum barrier height. In the case of reverse voltage bias, the situation becomes opposite. We found that both solar cells (with different MoS2 thickness) resulted in nearly the same Schottky-barrier height (∼1.0 eV), as measured from the linear extrapolation in the reverse-biasing region (from 1 V to 4 V). It can be understood that a change of the MoS2 should not make a difference in the Schottky-barrier height. While we expect that MoS2 thickness (down to a few layers) may change the Schottky-barrier height, the layer dependence becomes insignificant in the nanomembranes used in our experiment. The observed linear behavior of the Mott–Schottky plots suggests that the MoS2 nanomembranes possess a relatively low density of surface defects.

(b) Schematic showing MoS2–Au interfacial energy level change at zero (equilibrium), forward, and reverse bias conditions and the effect on Schottky barrier height. 
J. M. Luther et al. reported a Schottky-barrier solar cell using PbSe quantum dots.2 The result showed significant variation in the voltage-dependent C−2 for two PbSe samples (thickness difference > 300 nm).2 In our study, MoS2–Au solar cells (with active layer thickness difference of 100 nm) exhibit no significant change in the C−2 values with reverse bias. This could be attributed to the layered MoS2 nanomembrane (defect-free or with negligibly low density of defects) as compared with conventional semiconductors in which unsaturated dangling bonds make the M–S interface highly defective. In layered semiconductors the crystal lattice planes are weakly bound by van der Waals' interactions and hence the surface exhibits self-saturated electronic bonds which are no longer active for surface reaction with the environment. The nature of a self-saturated surface in layered MoS2 nanomembrane eliminates Fermi level pinning and interfacial oxide layer formation (both could impede the transport significantly). The voltage-bias-dependent C−2 values are almost identical in both device samples (with different thicknesses) due to negligible change in the trap states at MoS2–Au interface where carriers are stored and released, affecting the junction capacitance. This is a key appealing property of layered semiconductors for solar cell applications as compared with bulk/thin film semiconductors which possess a particular type of electronic bonding along and across the crystal planes (leading to defective bulk and surface upon cleaving).
We project that the performance of the MoS2 nanomembrane-based Schottky-barrier solar cell could be further improved. Layered semiconductors are typically very sensitive to growth conditions such as temperature and pressure. Temperature fluctuation across the growth furnace plays a significant role in influencing the solid–vapor reaction between pre-deposited Mo and S vapor, and eventually the electronic quality of the MoS2 nanomembrane. In addition, defects and impurities introduced during the CVD growth and deformation formed during layer transfer would all contribute to reduced carrier mobility and degraded carrier transport properties. We expect that further optimization of the growth process, use of a cleaner fabrication environment, and direct assembly of MoS2 nanomembranes on an ITO substrate would produce less defective materials, leading to improved solar cell performance.
Conclusions
Schottky-barrier solar cells have been demonstrated using layer-assembled, CVD-grown MoS2 semiconductor nanomembranes as the critical photo-active layer. While relatively thick MoS2 nanomembranes are used in this experiment, the material is scalable via a controlled CVD growth process and large-area solar cell fabrication is potentially feasible. The dependency of solar cell performance on MoS2 thickness was evaluated. Further improvement in solar cell performance is expected through optimizing the growth process, eliminating structural deformation (induced during fabrication), and minimizing the amount of surface defects and impurities. The reported results would promote continued efforts towards developing highly efficient Schottky-barrier solar cells taking advantage of the unique interfacial properties of layered semiconductor nanostructures.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the CVD growth setup showing the reaction of sulphur vapor with Mo film pre-deposited on Si–SiO2 substrate for the growth of an MoS2 nanomembrane. (b) Major process steps involved in the synthesis of the MoS2 nanomembrane, layer transfer, and subsequent fabrication of a Schottky-barrier solar cell. The KOH wet etching process was used to detach the MoS2 nanomembrane from SiO2–Si substrate. (c and d) Partially floating MoS2 nanomembrane in KOH solution. (e) Free-floating MoS2 nanomembrane in KOH to be transferred onto an ITO-coated glass substrate for solar cell fabrication.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) 2D mapping micrograph of AFM surface scan obtained on an as-assembled MoS2 nanomembrane after transferring onto an ITO substrate. The line-scan measurement was performed from point A to B to evaluate the physical thickness of MoS2. (b) Measured step profile of the MoS2 nanomembrane on ITO substrate.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Raman spectra obtained on two samples of MoS2 nanomembranes with thicknesses of ∼110 nm and ∼220 nm, respectively. The samples were prepared by multiple transfers/stacking of CVD-grown MoS2. (b) Schematic showing the two Raman active modes corresponding to the signature peaks observed in MoS2.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic cross-sectional view of the demonstrated Schottky barrier solar cell structure showing a stack of MoS2 nanomembrane on an ITO substrate with Au contact. (b) Energy band diagram of the solar cell with formation of a Schottky-barrier between the MoS2 nanomembrane and Au metal contact.	 

 	Fig. 5  Measured dark and illuminated J–V characteristics of the Schottky-barrier solar cells with a stack of MoS2 nanomembrane having thicknesses of (a) ∼110 nm and (b) ∼220 nm. Inset of each figure shows the power output as a function of voltage for the fabricated solar cell. (c) Recombination process via electron–hole capture by interfacial trap states present in conventional and layered semiconductors, showing significantly fewer traps in the latter. This leads to reduced probability of carrier recombination in a layered semiconductor.	 

 	Fig. 6  Measured EQE spectra of the Schottky-barrier solar cells with a stack of MoS2 nanomembranes having thicknesses of ∼110 nm and ∼220 nm, respectively, in the wavelength region of 350–950 nm. This confirms an optical bandgap of approximately 1.3 eV for the prepared MoS2 nanomembranes.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) The measured Mott–Schottky (C−2–V) plot of the Schottky-barrier solar cells with a stack of MoS2 nanomembranes having thicknesses of ∼110 nm and ∼220 nm, respectively, showing a linear C−2 dependency (shown in the circled region) on the applied reverse bias, VR. (b) Schematic showing MoS2–Au interfacial energy level change at zero (equilibrium), forward, and reverse bias conditions and the effect on Schottky barrier height.
