    , Accepted 30th June 2015First published on 1st July 2015AbstractThe content and ratio of two stacking styles, namely H-aggregation and J-aggregation, of 5,5′-bis{(4-(7-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene, DTS(PTTh2)2, had a profound influence on the performance of solar cells based on DTS(PTTh2)2/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) (7/3, w/w) blend films. It was found that the H/J ratio could be tuned from 0.30 to 1.40 by controlling the boiling point of the main solvent, the content of additives and the selective dissolution by additives (such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH) and 1,4-diiodobutane (DIB)) of the DTS(PTTh2)2 side chains. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM was firstly improved, then decreased with increasing H/J ratio. The best PCE of 6.51% was achieved by adding 0.20 vol% 1,6-diiodohexane (DIO) into solutions in thiophene (Th), which improved it by 203% compared to the reference without additives, when the H/J ratio was 1.01. Balance between the two stacking styles is needed for the device to obtain best performance. On one hand, J-aggregation was favorable for forming more excitons because a lower energy was needed to excite the J-aggregation. On the other hand, the H-aggregation favored exciton dissociation for two reasons: providing excitons with a longer lifetime and stronger driving force for exciton dissociation. In addition, the complementary light absorption of the two stacking styles is advantageous for maximal light absorption.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with rapidly increasing efficiency values are springing up as a promising alternative to their more costly inorganic counterparts.1–6 Recently, solution-processed small-molecule bulk-heterojunction (SM BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted increasing attention due to their intrinsic advantages such as well-defined structures, easy synthesis and purification and little batch-to-batch variations.7,8 Among the numerous conjugated small molecules for SM BHJ solar cells, one promising new donor small molecule is DTS(PTTh2)2 (Scheme 1), which has an absorption onset at 815 nm and an excellent field-effect hole mobility of about 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.7 The domain size of DTS(PTTh2)2 in the active layer of a BHJ device based on a DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM (7/3, w/w) blend is 20–30 nm without any treatments. These features provide devices based on the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM system with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and an excellent PCE value of 6.7% under an AM1.5G irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. Most recent studies concerned with the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM system focused on tuning the film morphology including the crystallinity and crystal size and the influence of morphology on the device performance including the photoconductivity, PCE, Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) etc.7,9–11 Attractive items in SM BHJ solar cells, including the photocurrent response,12 charge generation13 and carrier transport,14 were also explored in depth. Adding solvent additives, i.e., 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), was a powerful strategy to enhance the device performance and yielded excellent results.7,11 However, it is also very important to clarify the detailed mechanism about the enormous positive influence of a small amount of solvent additives on greatly improving the device performance in terms of molecular order, which is helpful to better correlate the structures and device performance and guide the processing of functional conjugated molecules.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of DTS(PTTh2)2 and PC70BM. 
As is known, H-aggregation and J-aggregation are two common stacking styles of conjugated molecules which could reflect the molecular order of conjugated molecules.15–17 Adjacent molecules are stacked face-to-face to form the H-aggregation, and head-to-tail to form the J-aggregation.18
As to the relationship between absorption peaks and H-/J-aggregation, there are two viewpoints. One is that the three peaks (0–0, 0–1, 0–2) taken together represent a vibronic progression, due to a symmetric vinyl stretching and/or ring breathing mode (or modes) in the region from 1200 to 1500 cm−1. The ratio of the 0–0 peak to the 0–1 peak is very sensitive to the exciton bandwidth. In particular, the peak ratio decreases with the bandwidth for H-aggregation and increases with the bandwidth for J-aggregation.19–21 The other is that the red-shift absorption peak (compared to the absorption peak of the monomer) represented J-aggregation and the blue-shift one represented H-aggregation.16,22–24 Each of the two viewpoints has its own merits. Here, we adopted the latter one due to the fact that it is more direct and allowed us to intuitively compare H- and J-aggregation.
The H-/J-aggregation state has multiple influences on many important factors concerning the performance of solar cells. Firstly, the absorption peaks of H-aggregation and J-aggregation are blue-shifted and red-shifted compared to those in the isolated state, respectively.16,25 If the two stacking styles coexist, the absorption range could be enlarged. Secondly, H-aggregation has a higher lowest excited level19 which provides a stronger driving force for exciton dissociation, and excitons may have a longer lifetime in H-aggregation because the excited electrons have to go though an inner conversion to a lower excited level before the transition back to the ground state.15 On the other hand, a lower energy is needed to excite J-aggregation which is favorable to form more excitons and therefore leads to a high photocurrent. Thirdly, the stacking style can influence the carrier mobility. The holes in H-aggregation move faster along the π–π stacking direction due to the larger overlap of the π–π stacking than that in J-aggregation.17 Thus, it is found that the H-/J-aggregation state in films exerts a complex influence on the final device performance and needs an optimization. So far, the strategies for controlling the molecular stacking styles can be divided into two categories. One is chemical methods including changing the number of side chains attached to the small molecule,17 the chemical structures26,27 and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the side chains.28 The other is physical methods including choosing a proper solvent, controlling the salt concentration or the pH value, thermal annealing,29etc., which are practical in applications and should be paid attention to.
In our work, proper solvents and additives were chosen as the strategy to simultaneously increase the total quantity of H- and J-aggregation and to tune the ratio of H-/J-aggregation considering its simplicity in practical applications. We found that DTS(PTTh2)2 molecules could stack in both stacking styles, and the H-/J-aggregation state was influenced by three parameters including the boiling point of the main solvent, selective solubility of the side chains and backbone by additives, and the content of additives in the main solvent. Taking use of the three factors, the relative amount of the two stacking styles could be controlled, and balancing between the two stacking styles was needed to obtain the best device performance. It was found that diiodoalkanes were one kind of solvent additive which promoted the formation of H-aggregation. By tuning the H/J ratio, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.51% was achieved.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
DTS(PTTh2)2 and PC70BM were purchased from 1-Material Inc. and American Dye Source, respectively. The molecular structures are shown in Scheme 1. Chloroform (CF), tetralin (TL), acetophenone (ATP) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory, China. Chlorobenzene (CB), thiophene (Th), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH), and 1,4-diiodobutane (DIB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the materials were used as received.
2.2 H- and J-aggregation of DTS(PTTh2)2
Both the main solvent and additive had an influence on the H- and J-aggregation of DTS(PTTh2)2 in the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM blend system. First, two kinds of main solvent with different boiling points, namely CB and Th, were chosen. Solutions of DTS(PTTh2)2 and PC70BM at a weight ratio of 7:3 were made. Films of those were allowed to dry for several hours before characterization. The total amount of H- and J-aggregation increased using CB, and the J-aggregation increased more because of its better thermal stabilization and slower film forming rate in CB due to the higher boiling point. Then, two classes of additives were chose to better control H- and J-aggregation of DTS(PTTh2)2 in the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM (7/3, w/w) blend system. One class consisted of DIO, DIH and DIB, with high boiling points and selective solubility of alkyl side chains. TL, ATP, and NMP make up the other class, with high boiling points and no selectivity for any side chain. The additives were added to the Th solutions which were stirred for 30 min before casting. The effects of all additives, with the same content of 0.25%, on H- and J-aggregation were compared and so was a series of DIO of various content, namely 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 1, and 2%. Finally, the ratio of H/J was controlled on a scale from 0.30 to 1.40.
2.3 Characterization
The morphology of the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM film was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM was applied to investigate the morphological information in the bulk of the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM film. Images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Thin films were first floated on deionized water and then transferred onto a copper grid. The samples were dried at room temperature for 12 h before the TEM experiments.
The aggregation of DTS(PTTh2)2 in the films was studied by UV-vis absorption spectra. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with an AvaSpec-3648 750 spectrometer with AvaLight-DS and AvaLight-Hal sources for ultraviolet and visible light, respectively. The stacking style of DTS(PTTh2)2 was also characterized by the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) which was recorded with a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. A 508 nm excitation wavelength was selected.
The crystallinity of the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM film was analyzed using out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements. The GIXD profiles were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current.
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PV cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a computer controlled setup made by the Beijing 7-Star Optical Instruments Co., Ltd.
2.4 Solar-cell fabrication
The solar cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. The ITO-coated glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, then ultrasonicated in each water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and dried by a nitrogen flow. After drying the ITO substrates for 10 hours, a 9 nm thick MoOx layer was evaporated on this well-cleaned ITO glass in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa. A solution of the DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM (7/3, w/w) blend in thiophene (chlorobenzene) with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1 (40 mg ml−1) with or without additives was spin-cast on top of the MoOx layer to produce a 100 nm thick active layer. Finally, a layer of Al (100 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa to complete the device fabrication. The cell active area was 12 mm2, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Tuning of H- and J-aggregation through additive and solvent selection
As is known, molecular stacking styles can be reflected in the UV-vis absorption spectrum.30,31 DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM blend films were made from Th and CB solutions, and UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1(A). Obviously, all the spectra show a triplet, namely at 610, 650 and 720 nm, which indicates that H- and J-aggregation coexist and was supported by the PL spectra, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In detail, the peaks each represent H-aggregation, monomers and J-aggregation.16 The spectrum of the film made from the CB solution is red-shifted, and the peak at 720 nm is much higher, indicating more J-aggregation in the relevant film. This is contributed to the higher boiling point of CB. In other words, a solution with a high boiling point extends the time of film formation, and as a result facilitates J-aggregation formation due to the fact that J-aggregation is the more stable stacking style with a lower lowest excited level, and molecules tend to stack in J-aggregation in terms of thermodynamics. The boiling point is high, thus, there is more time for the molecules to stack. As a consequence, J-aggregation will increase compared to H-aggregation. In order to intuitively compare the two spectra, the spectra were fitted and the peak areas represent the amount of the corresponding aggregation.16 Before fitting, the spectra of PCBM were deducted. It is worth to note that the main solvents and additives had hardly any influence on the spectra of PCBM which was propitious to study the spectra of DTS(PTTh2)2. The H/J values are listed in Table 1 (detailed information about how we got the values is shown in S2, ESI†), which are consistent with the above view. The crystal properties were characterized by GIXD, as shown in Fig. 1(B). The mean crystal size, L, can be estimated using Scherrer's relation:32–34  where λ = 0.154 nm is the wavelength of the incident beam, 2θ is the angle between the incident and scattered X-ray wavevectors, and Δ2θ is the full width at half maximum of the peak. The results are shown in Table 1, and the crystal size of the thin film made from CB was larger than the one made from Th. In order to get a proper crystal size, we chose Th as the main solvent in the following experiments.

Then, the influence of additives on the molecular stacking style was studied. As is known, the side chains have a strong influence on the aggregation style. Besides, it was proved here that additives interacting with the side chains could also influence the aggregation state. Additives with different physical properties, namely DIO, DIH, DIB, ATP, TL and NMP, were chosen. These additives can be divided into two classes. One class consisted of DIO, DIH and DIB, which are all alkanes functionalized by iodine and enable selective solubility of the alkyl side chains. The rest make up the other class without any selectivity for the side chains. The common ground of all the additives is a higher boiling point shown in Table 2 than that of the main solvent. All the samples here were based on blend films of DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM with a weight ratio of 7/3 without special notation.

The effect of different additives was studied by UV-vis absorption (Fig. 2(A)) and GIXD (Fig. 2(B)). In the GIXD profiles of the samples, those with additives show a higher peak in the 2θ region between 4 and 5.5 degrees, indicating that all of the additives can elevate the crystallinity to a great extent. In other words, the total amount of H- and J-aggregation increased. Instead, the change of the absorption peak after adding diverse additives is notably different. Compared to the reference without additives, the absorption peaks around 720 nm for the thin films using additives increased, except those with DIO, DIH and DIB whose absorption peaks around 720 nm decreased and the shoulder absorption peak around 610 nm increased. It is found that solvent additives can affect the stacking styles in different ways. More precisely, DIO, DIH and DIB each promote the formation of H-aggregation, while the other additives promote J-aggregation. For clarity, the spectra of the samples were fitted and the H/J values were calculated, as shown in Table 3. The results indicate that DIO, DIH and DIB largely promote H-aggregation while other additives have little influence on the relative amount of H-/J-aggregation. By combining the GIXD profiles and UV-vis spectra, it can be concluded that the effect of the latter additives is to improve the crystallinity of DTS(PTTh2)2 and H- and J-aggregation are increased in almost the same proportion.

In order to study the influence of the content of DIO on H- and J-aggregation, a series of thin films were made from solutions with different DIO content, including 0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 1, and 2%. The corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The height of the peak at 720 nm decreases relatively and the shoulder at 610 nm increases with increasing content of DIO until 1%. When the concentration increases beyond 1%, J-aggregation gradually prevails over H-aggregation, indicated by the remarkable red shift and increasing height of the peak around 720 nm. For clarity, the spectra of the samples were fitted and the H/J values were calculated, as shown in Table 4. The results indicate that the biggest value of 1.40 of H/J was achieved when using 1% DIO. According to Table 4, a broken line graph was obtained, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The value of H/J was found to quickly increase, especially early on, when the DIO content was small and increased from 0% to 0.35%. Then, the speed became slower. A turning point occurred at a content of 1%, and then the value of H/J quickly decreased.

In summary, three parameters of the solvents and additives had an influence on the stacking style of DTS(PTTh2)2. Firstly, J-aggregation was favoured for a solvent with a high boiling point. Secondly, alkanes substituted by heteroatoms as additives could promote H-aggregation; in other words, additives which dissolve the side chains selectively promote H-aggregation formation. The additives without selective solubility for the side chains promoted J-aggregation. Thirdly, increasing the amount of diiodoalkane additives improved H-aggregation, but when the amount overran a threshold, a negative effect emerged, which was different from those of the other additives.
In order to detect the packing structures of H-/J-aggregation, we prepared two DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM thin films with high crystallinity and different H/J ratios which were key to reflect the structural difference of H-aggregation and J-aggregation when measured by GIXD. On of them was processed with 5% DIO which can improve the crystallinity and H/J ratio, and the other was heated at 200 °C for 10 min which can improve the crystallinity and decrease the H/J ratio because J-aggregation is the thermally stable state. Here we chose heat treatment, instead of adding additives, such as ATP, NMP, TL, because they can neither improve crystallinity to a enough largely extent nor decrease H/J ratio. UV-vis of the two thin films is shown in Fig. 4(B). Obviously, the H/J ratio of the thin film processed with 5% DIO is much higher than the one of the film heated at 200 °C for 10 min. The corresponding GIXD patterns are shown in Fig. 4(A). Fortunately, the crystallinity of both thin films is high enough so that we can observe doublets which imply the difference of H-aggregation and J-aggregation in the (001) direction. For the thin film processed with 5% DIO, which had a higher H/J ratio, the first peak at 4.71 degrees corresponding to a space distance of 1.88 nm is higher than the second one at 5.12 degrees corresponding to a space distance of 1.73 nm. For the other thin film with a lower H/J ratio, the first peak at 4.31 degrees corresponding to a space distance of 2.05 nm is lower than the second one at 4.54 degrees corresponding to a space distance of 1.96 nm. So, we can conclude that the first/second peak corresponds to the space distance of H-/J-aggregation. For the second thin film, both (001) space distances of H- and J-aggregation are larger than those of the first thin film, maybe implying poorer crystal structures. Considering that the (001) space distance of H-aggregation is larger than that of J-aggregation, we speculated that J-aggregation has a displacement along the (001) direction; the details are shown in Scheme 2.

 Scheme 2  Schemes of the stacking structures of H-/J-aggregation of DTS(PTTh2)2. The different colours represent the different directions of DTS(PTTh2)2. In detail, green stands for downward DTS(PTTh2)2, and purple for the upward ones. 
Here, we try to clarify the mechanism of how the additives with different physical properties control the stacking styles. On one hand, the high boiling points of these solvent additives could help to promote J-aggregation by increasing the time for the molecule stacking, as mentioned above. On the other hand, alkanes substituted by heteroatoms could promote H-aggregation due to their different solubility for alkyl side chains and the conjugated backbones. In order to clarify this mechanism, the process of film formation from solutions containing additives is shown in Scheme 3. In both of the pristine solutions, the additives and DTS(PTTh2)2 uniformly dispersed in Th. Then, a great deal of main solvent volatilizes because of its lower boiling point. In the following process, different changes occurred. In the system of Th/DIO, when the amount of DIO was comparative to that of Th, the side chains were dissolved in DIO and the backbone was dissolved in Th, according to the like-dissolves-like theory. As a result of further Th evaporation, the molecular backbones started to freeze and the repulsion between the side chains and conjugated backbone accelerated this process. So, the backbone didn't have enough time to tune its configuration, which favoured H-aggregation. It was noted that when the amount of DIO was large, i.e., beyond 1%, H-aggregation decreased. This phenomenon could be explained by this mechanism, too. If the content of DIO was too high, the molecular backbone would be dissolved by DIO to some extent. So the backbone had more time to tune its configuration to form J-aggregation. As for the additives without selectivity for the side chains, taking TL for example, when all of Th volatilized, the backbones could still move due to the fact that TL could dissolve both the side chains and backbone, which allowed the backbone to fully tune its configuration to form more J-aggregation with a better thermodynamic stability. Obviously, the process of solidifying the backbone in the system with DIO was faster than that with TL, i.e. DIO shortened the freezing process of the backbone contributing to H-aggregation, while TL lengthened the process to favor J-aggregation.
 Scheme 3  The three subsequent stages of film formation from solutions containing DIO or TL. (1) and (1,) are the pristine stage. A great deal of main solvent volatilizes because of its lower boiling point. In (2) and (2,), all of the Th has volatilized. In (3) and (3,), DIO or TL evaporates totally. 
3.2 Influence of H-/J-aggregation on the photophysical process
The H-/J-aggregation state has multiple influences on many important factors concerning the performance of solar cells, among which the electronic energy level structure is essential. So, we firstly analysed the electronic energy level structure (shown in Scheme 4). Coupling interactions between adjacent molecules result in the splitting of the lowest excited energy level. The stronger the coupling interaction, the larger the splitting. Adjacent molecules in H-aggregation have a stronger coupling interaction due to the larger area of π–π overlap. Therefore, the splitting of the lowest excited energy level in H-aggregation is larger than that in J-aggregation. Here, we call the higher lowest excited energy level ν2, and the lower lowest excited energy level ν1. As for H-aggregation, the electron jumps from HOMO to ν2 after absorbing a photon. Thus, the band gap between ν2 of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor in H-aggregation (ΔEH,L) is larger than that between ν1 and LUMO of the acceptor in J-aggregation (ΔEJ,L), which provides a larger driving force for exciton dissociation.

The distinct change of energy level following the transformation of the stacking style was also observed in an experiment. CV curves of thin films casted from a Th solution of DTS(PTTh2)2 with 0.2% DIO, 0.2% TL or without additive, are shown in Fig. 5. H- and J-aggregation were dominant in the samples treated with DIO/TL, while the monomer was the primary state in the untreated sample. According to the CV curves, the corresponding HOMO and LOMO energy levels were calculated and are listed in Table 5. The HOMO levels in both samples treated with additives were elevated due to the fact that H- and J-aggregation states were more ordered than that of the monomer.35 As shown in Scheme 4, the band gaps between HOMOs of the acceptor and donor in H-aggregation (ΔEH,H) and J-aggregation (ΔEJ,H) are larger than that between HOMOs of the donor monomer and acceptor (ΔEM,H), which provides a larger driving force for hole transfer from PCBM to DTS(PTTh2)2 and exciton dissociation. The LUMO in the sample treated with DIO was the highest among the three samples, which was ascribed to H-aggregation. It was noted that the LUMO in the sample treated with TL was higher than that of the pristine sample, which seemed to be incompatible with the energy level of J-aggregation. In fact, this phenomenon was logical, because there was still a great deal of H-aggregation in the sample. The rise of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor would make for efficient exciton dissociation.

Beside exciton dissociation, many other photophysical processes were affected following the change of the electronic energy level structure. The first and most obvious one was light absorption. For H-aggregation, the band gap between LUMO (ν2) and HOMO is larger than that of the monomer, as mentioned above, leading to the fact that an electron has to absorb light of higher energy to jump from the HOMO to ν2, i.e. the absorption peak of H-aggregation is blue-shifted. The situation is opposite in J-aggregation. To show the shift quantitatively, we gave an example absorption spectrum and the corresponding fitted curves, as shown in Fig. 6. The absorption peaks of H-aggregation, the monomer, and J-aggregation are at 601, 655 and 717 nm, respectively. They complement each other well, which enlarges the absorption region and improves the efficiency in solar energy utilization.

Then, it was found that more excitons formed in J-aggregation under the same sunlight. Here, the saturated photocurrent of the device with different H/J values was compared. The photocurrent originates from excitons. With increasing negative bias, the photocurrent will get saturated.36 In other words, a saturated photocurrent is the biggest photocurrent when the applied bias voltage is high enough and the total exciton generation rate can be directly extracted from the saturated photocurrent.37 Here, we can't get the saturated photocurrent of all the devices due to a limited applied bias voltage, but the saturated photocurrent of these devices can be compared qualitatively according to the tendency of the J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 7. Three devices of the four, whose saturated photocurrent can be compared without doubt, are based on the solutions with 0.15%, 0.2%, and 0.25% DIO, and the sequence is 0.15% > 0.2% > 0.25%, which is inversely correlated to the H/J value, indicating that an active layer with more J-aggregation can obtain a higher saturated photocurrent. In other words, J-aggregation yielded a better photoresponse, and as a result a better light conversion efficiency,38 which was consistent with the viewpoint of Yang Yang et al., who demonstrated a significant contribution of J-aggregation to the photocurrent.39,40 This may be attributed to the fact that a lower energy is needed to excite J-aggregation due to the lower LUMO energy level.

3.3 Optimization of the device performance by tuning the balance between H- and J-aggregation
According to the discussion in part 2.2, the stacking style of the donor has a profound influence on the photophysical processes. The light absorption of H- and J-aggregation is complementary: J-aggregation makes for efficient exciton generation, and H-aggregation provides more driving force for exciton dissociation. These factors all have particularly close ties to the device performance. In order to figure out the relationship between the stacking style of the donor and device performance, the following experiments were performed.
We chose a series of diiodoalkanes including DIO, DIH and DIB to tune the stacking style of the donor. With increasing alkyl chain length, the increase in H-aggregation became more and more significant with the same content, as shown in Table 6. As for one kind of additive, the relative amount of H-aggregation firstly increased with increasing additive content. Then, with further increasing additive content, the relative amount of H-aggregation instead decreased. We made devices based on a 20 mg ml−1 DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM (7/3, w/w) solution in Th with different amounts of DIO, namely 0.15%, 0.2%, and 0.25% (v/v). The J–V curves of the solar cell devices made from the blend solution with or without additives are depicted in Fig. 7, and the summary of the device performance is shown in Table 6. The device made from the solution with 0.2% DIO had the best PCE of 6.51%. The H/J values of the three devices based on solutions with 0%, 0.15%, 0.2%, and 0.25% DIO are 0.36, 0.75, 1.01, and 1.25, respectively, as shown in Table 6. By considering both the device performance and stacking type, it is found that there is maybe a balance between H-aggregation and J-aggregation favoring the optimal device performance and the balance H/J value is about 1.

For further confirmation, we compared the device performance based on the other two additives with different amounts, as shown in Table 6. For DIH, the best device performance occurred when the ratio of H/J was 0.96 which is very close to 1. As for DIB, the best device performance occurred when the ratio of H/J was 0.86 which was the highest value obtained using DIB due to its lowest ability among the three to improve H-aggregation.
As is known, the morphology, in particular the crystal size, of the active layer influences the device performance to a great extent.41 We compared three devices with similar crystal size, so that the influence of the crystal size on the device performance can be neglected. The crystal sizes of the active layers based on different amounts of the three additives are listed in Table 6. Among all of the devices, we chose three based on solutions with 0.5% DIB, 0.25% DIH, and 0.25% DIO, and the crystal sizes were 25.1 nm, 26.7 nm, and 25.7 nm, respectively, which were similar. The corresponding TEM images were obtained, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Obviously, the TEM images show similar morphologies, too. As shown in Table 6, the device based on the solution with 0.25% DIH whose H/J value is 0.96 is the best. So now, we can determinately conclude that there is a balance between H-aggregation and J-aggregation favoring the optimal device performance and the balance H/J value is about 1.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, it was found that the molecules of DTS(PTTh2)2 can stack in two stacking styles, J-aggregation and H-aggregation. They were influenced by three factors: the boiling point of the main solvent, selective solubility for the side chains and backbone by the additives and the amount of additive. The relative amount of the two stacking styles could be controlled by tuning the physical parameters of the main solvent and additives. A higher boiling point of the main solvent led to more J-aggregation, and a larger selective dissolution of the side chains compared with that of the backbone by the additives, and an optimal content of additive in the solvent led to more H-aggregation. The stacking style had a profound influence on the performance of the device based on DTS(PTTh2)2/PC70BM (7:3 w/w). It is concluded that a balance between the two stacking styles is necessary for the device to obtain best performance. Firstly, the complementary light absorption of the two stacking styles is advantageous for maximal light absorption. Secondly, H-aggregation could promote exciton dissociation, while J-aggregation could promote the formation of more excitons. By taking use of additives alone to systematically tune the ratio of the two stacking styles of DTS(PTTh2)2, we obtained a best PCE of 6.51%, which was improved by 203% compared to that of the reference without additives. The results here are thought to be helpful to better understand the correlation between molecular order and device performance, and guide the optimization of production of new devices.
