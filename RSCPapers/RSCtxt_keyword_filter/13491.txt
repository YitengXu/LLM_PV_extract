    , Accepted 20th December 2012First published on 22nd January 2013AbstractAn interparticle binding agent, or nanoglue, was synthesized by a sol–gel process, which facilitated the preparation of well-interconnected TiO2 electrodes at low-temperatures for plastic dye-sensitized solar cells. The viscosity of the nanoglue-based pastes was seven times higher than that obtained in pastes without any nanoglue. The increased viscosity was sufficiently high enough for coating thick films to fabricate TiO2 electrodes. The structural and photovoltaic properties of the films were extensively investigated by varying the amounts of nanoglue. A reduced pore size and greatly enhanced surface area were observed in the nanoglue-based films. Improved interparticle connectivity, resulting in faster electron transport, was confirmed by photocurrent transient spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance measurements of the nanoglue-based films. The electron diffusion length and charge collection efficiency were also enhanced in these nanoglue-based films. A maximum conversion efficiency of 5.43% was achieved in films containing 20 wt% nanoglue fabricated on a plastic substrate under one-sun illumination, even without any additional treatment.
Introduction
The increasing energy demand and shortage of fossil fuels have driven the scientific community to develop new sources of clean and sustainable energy. The supply of energy from the sun to the earth is enormous and inexhaustible and a good choice to fulfill these ever-growing demands. Photovoltaic technology is one of the most favorable methods to convert solar energy to electrical energy, and therefore, it is receiving considerable attention these days. Recent global-scale investments in new generation solar cells are stimulating a large number of studies on photovoltaic materials such as dye-sensitized semiconductors, organic heterojunction films, and organic–inorganic hybrid structures. Among these, dye-sensitized mesoscopic titanium oxide films, which have a junction comprising organic redox electrolytes, could be used to realize high efficiency photovoltaic cells known as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1 Recently, the efficiency of DSCs has been increased to 12.3% under one-sun illumination using a small test cell fabricated with high temperature sintered nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes fabricated on a conducting rigid glass substrate.2 The principal advantage of DSCs over silicon solar cells is the possibility of fabricating it using simple wet-coating processes under vacuum-free and ambient conditions. Dramatic cost reduction in high-speed manufacturing can be accomplished by continuous roll-to-roll printing processes using a flexible plastic substrate. Lightweight and flexible plastic solar cells can be installed even on non-flat surfaces, which makes them a possible ubiquitous power source for mobile electronics.3 In the case of conventional glass–substrate-based DSCs, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes are usually prepared by coating water- and/or alcohol-based TiO2 paste containing organic binders. These organic binders are used to increase the viscosity of the paste to enable the printing process and the formation of mechanically stable TiO2 films with appropriate thickness and porosity. The subsequent sintering process, usually carried out at around 450 °C, is essential to achieve better electrical contact between TiO2 nanoparticles and remove organic binders.1 However, this high temperature sintering processing cannot be applied for the fabrication of TiO2 electrodes on plastic substrates as the plastic substrates thermally degrade at high temperatures (>150 °C). In addition, it is noteworthy that pastes with sufficient viscosity are necessary in order to make a continuous coating possible. Therefore, the critical challenges faced while fabricating plastic-based DSCs include developing processable viscous pastes without the addition of organic binders and fabricating well-interconnected electrodes with low-temperature processing (≤150 °C). Several techniques such as chemical sintering,4–8 mechanical pressing,9–11 hydrothermal crystallization,12 electrophoretic deposition,13,14 microwave irradiation,15 and UV light irradiation16,17 have been proposed to fabricate well-interconnected TiO2 electrodes. Most of these techniques, however, require a film to be formed on the plastic substrate initially, followed by an additional step for film treatment, which is not favorable for continuous roll-to-roll coating processes. To date, only a few highly viscous pastes suitable for a single-step coating process have been developed.7,8,18 Previously, the effects of an interparticle binding agent, or nanoglue, on the interparticle connectivity and electron transport8 have been briefly investigated. The nanoglue particles could induce better interparticle connectivity between the neighboring TiO2 nanoparticles through a dehydration reaction of the abundant hydroxyl functional groups on its surface. However, some fundamental properties and the effects of this novel inorganic binder are still unknown, and this knowledge is essential and needs to be explored in detail using diverse techniques. In this article, we present our extensive study on the structural properties and electron transport and recombination behaviors of nanoglue-based films carried out by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) adsorption studies, viscometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and photocurrent transient spectroscopy. The concomitant effects on the photovoltaic properties of the electrodes were also investigated by using photovoltage–current curves and measuring the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE).
Experimental
TiO2 particles (P25, 21 nm, Degussa) were dispersed in ethanol solution with 20 wt% solid phase using an ultrafine grinding mill (Ultra Apex Mill, Model UAM-015, Kotobuki), and nanoglue containing 5 nm sized TiO2 particles was synthesized by a sol–gel process. To prepare the nanoglue particles, the diluted titanium precursor in alcoholic solvent was slowly added dropwise into a mixture of distilled water and acetic acid. After aging, TiO2 particles were subsequently collected by centrifugation and finally concentrated to 15 wt% gel by adjusting the amount of solvent, which is a nanoglue.8
The viscous alcoholic paste for TiO2 films was prepared by blending the dispersed P25/alcohol solution and the nanoglue gel, followed by sonication and vigorous agitation for 10 min. The weight ratio of TiO2 particles in the nanoglue was varied from 0 to 30 wt% for optimization. The final concentration of TiO2 particle in the pastes was fixed at 15 wt%.
The TiO2 films were coated by the doctor blade method with a 3M tape spacer onto a transparent conducting glass substrate (2.3 mm in thickness and with a sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1, Pilkington TEC8) or a plastic substrate (ITO/PEN, 200 μm in thickness exhibiting a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1, and a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm, Peccell Tech. Inc.). After slowly drying at ambient temperature, the TiO2 films were sintered at 150 °C for 30 min and then slowly cooled to 80 °C. The films were then immersed into a solution of 0.5 mM N719 (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium, Everlight Chemical Industrial Co.) in anhydrous ethanol for dye loading at 40 °C for 3 h with slow and continuous agitation. A Pt counter electrode was prepared by spreading a drop of 7 mM solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O in 2-propanol on FTO/glass, followed by drying at ambient temperature, and then annealed at 400 °C for 20 min. The two electrodes were assembled using a 60 μm thick hot melt Surlyn (Dupont 1702). An electrolyte solution comprising 0.4 M tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), 0.1 M LiI, 0.02 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) dissolved in acetonitrile was introduced through a drilled hole on the counter electrode. The thickness of the TiO2 films after thermal treatment was measured by a surface profiler (Alpha-step IQ, KLA-Tencor). The active area of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 films was about 0.45 cm2, which was measured by an image analysis program equipped with a digital microscope camera (Moticam 1000).
The viscosity of TiO2 pastes was determined by a Brookfield DV-II+ Pro Viscometer maintained at a temperature of 25 °C with a Brookfield circulating temperature bath.
The amounts of dye absorption on the TiO2 films were quantitatively estimated by desorbing the dye in basic solution, as follows. After dye absorption in dye solution, the sensitized films, with a known area and thickness, were rinsed with anhydrous ethanol, and then dried in a dry nitrogen flow. Then the sensitized films immersed in a measured volume of 0.1 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water–ethanol (50:50 v/v) for 24 h to eliminate the dye from TiO2 films. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the resulted solution was recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-Vis spectrometer.
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was carried out with an electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun (FEI Tecnai F20, Philips Electron Optics, Holland). Powder XRD (Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractormeter) was carried out using Cu-Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm and supplied with a voltage of 40 kV and current of 100 mA. Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed using the Keithley model 2400 source measure unit. A solar simulator (Yamashida Denso) equipped with a 1000 W xenon lamp was used as the light source, and the light intensity was adjusted with a National renewable energy laboratory (NREL) calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-3 filter, for approximating one-sun light intensity. The cell was covered with a black mask with an appropriately sized aperture to exclude any interference from diffused light during measurement. The IPCE was measured using a system specially designed for DSCs (PV measurements, Inc.). The surface area and pore distribution properties were analyzed (Quantachrome NOVA 2000e analyzer) after the samples were degassed in vacuum at 250 °C for 2 h. The surface area was determined from the BET isotherm, and the pore volume and size distributions were measured using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. EIS was carried out with a potentiostat (Solartron 1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260) with frequencies ranging from 10−1 to 106 Hz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. Impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectrum using Z-view software. The impedance measurements were carried out in the dark by sweeping the applied potential. For the photocurrent transient spectroscopic studies, the cells were probed with a weak laser pulse at 532 nm and superimposed on a relatively intense background (bias) illumination at 680 nm obtained with a 0.5 W diode laser (Model: BWF1-670-300E/55370, B&W TEK Inc.) by using a setup similar to that of a previously reported system.19
Results and discussion
1 Physical properties of the nanoglue-based TiO2 slurry
The HR-TEM image in Fig. 1(a) clearly shows a single TiO2 particle with the size of about 5 nm and the lattice plane of anatase (101) with an interlayer spacing of 0.352 nm. Fig. 1(b) shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. ‘A’ represents anatase and (hkl) indicates the reflection planes of the nanoglue particle corresponding to anatase in (101), (004), (200), and (105) planes. The results obtained from the pattern are in good agreement with the HR-TEM image of a single nanoglue particle. It is worth noting that TiO2 particles with anatase phase are desirable for fabricating high efficiency DSCs.20

(d) Thixotropic behavior of the nanoglue gel with a concentration of 5 wt% in ethanol, before agitation (left) and after agitation (right). 
During the experiments, the nanoglue particles were well dispersed along with the P25 particles before being coated onto the FTO/glass substrates, and the thus formed TiO2 films were partially scratched off from the substrate during the analysis using TEM. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the smaller nanoglue particles were located between the larger P25 particles, which served as interparticle binding sites to bridge the P25 particles, leading to better interconnection, and thereby faster electron transport between the particles in DSCs. As mentioned before, the viscosities of water- or alcohol-based TiO2 slurries free of organic binders are normally too low to perform coating of thick films. Therefore, sufficiently viscous TiO2 pastes, without any organic binder additives, are essential to facilitate the construction of photoelectrodes in plastic-based DSCs. The nanoglue gel was expected to serve as an inorganic binder to increase the viscosity of TiO2 pastes. As shown in Fig. 1(d), despite the low concentration of nanoglue (5 wt%) in ethanol, the nanoglue-based colloid displayed a high viscosity (left image in Fig. 1(d)) and remained attached to the bottom of the bottle without flowing down. After manual agitation, the viscous gel became fluid-like due to the disruption of hydrogen bonding between the nanoglue particles and flowed down to the bottom (right image in Fig. 1(d)). With the help of such a viscous nanoglue gel, the preparation and formulation of viscous TiO2 pastes was significantly simplified.
The most general method to prepare viscous binder-free TiO2 pastes is adding a Ti precursor to the TiO2 slurry. The added Ti precursor not only increased the viscosity of the TiO2 slurry facilitating easy coating but also improved the interconnection between the nanoparticles by a crystallization process. However, the completion of crystallization generally takes a long period of time when hydrothermal21 or water cook treatments22 are adopted as low-temperature sintering methods. Moreover, the Ti precursor in the paste is usually unstable because of its acute sensitivity to humidity and temperature. Consequently, the long-term stability of the pastes becomes a concern. However, in the case of a paste containing a pure anatase-based nanoglue, such as the one used in this work, the post-treatment after coating merely involves drying at 150 °C for only 0.5 h or even shorter; this could be easily performed under normal conditions. With regard to stability, we could not observe any noticeable changes in the composition and morphology even after three weeks of storage, as shown in Fig. 2. The size of the particles in the nanoglue remained at 5.2 nm without exhibiting any noticeable growth, and the anatase phase was also maintained after three weeks of storage. Therefore, the nanoglue, containing well-crystallized pure anatase particles, can be expected to be used as a base material for preparing DSC pastes, taking its processability and long-term stability into consideration.

Various TiO2 pastes were prepared by dispersing varying amounts of the nanoglue gel in the P25/alcohol solution, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The paste without any nanoglue displayed a very low viscosity and flowed down like a liquid to the bottom of the bottle. In contrast, all the pastes with the nanoglue gel clearly exhibited sufficiently high enough viscosities to adhere to the bottom even when the bottle was inverted. The viscosities of the pastes were measured to quantitatively investigate the effect of the addition of the nanoglue. It can be seen from the plot shown in Fig. 3 that the paste containing only 15 wt% of P25 particles in ethanol displayed a viscosity of 10 cP irrespective of shear stress. However, the viscosity of the nanoglue-based pastes increased significantly by increasing the amount of nanoglue. The interaction between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the P25 particles and/or that of the nanoglue particles accounts for the observed viscosity enhancement. The paste obtained with 30 wt% of nanoglue was seven times more viscous than the paste produced without adding any nanoglue.

2 Physical properties of the nanoglue-based TiO2 films
The amount of nanoglue added had a great effect on the structural properties such as the morphology, pore size, and surface area of the films. The amount of dye absorption and electron transport behavior depends on the structural properties of the films. Fig. 4 displays the SEM images of the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the films with different amounts of nanoglue. A porous structure with relatively larger pores was observed for the film without nanoglue (a-1 in Fig. 4). The SEM image of the surface morphology at a low magnification exhibited a smooth surface without any cracks23 (a-2 in Fig. 4). It is well known that crack-free electrodes are essential for high-performance DSCs. By increasing the amounts of nanoglue, denser and relatively smaller pores were observed. This can be observed in Fig. 4 (b-1), (c-1), (d-1), and (e-1) of films containing 10, 12.5, 20, and 30 wt% of nanoglue, respectively. However, tiny cracks were initially generated in the film with 20 wt% nanoglue (Fig. 4 (d-2)), and many larger cracks were observed on the surface of the film with 30 wt% nanoglue (Fig. 4 (e-2)). The generation of cracks was attributed to the increased internal stress due to excessive addition of nanoglue to the films.24 SEM images shown in Fig. 4 (a-3) and (d-3) show the cross-sectional morphologies of the films without and with 20 wt% nanoglue, respectively. In comparison to films without the nanoglue, the films with 20 wt% nanoglue showed denser interior structures.

Among these, (1) denotes surface morphologies at high magnifications, (2) denotes surface morphologies at low magnifications, and (3) indicates cross-sectional morphologies. 
The structural properties of the films were also quantitatively studied by BET analysis and dye desorption experiments, which are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the smaller nanoglue particles (5 nm) were well dispersed among the larger P25 particles and were located either between the P25 particles or in the pores between the P25 particles, thereby bridging neighboring P25 particles and chemically bonding them together. Consequently, the total pore volume, average pore diameter, and porosity clearly decreased by increasing the amount of nanoglue since the voids between the P25 particles are partially filled by the smaller-sized nanoglue particles. On the other hand, it is also well known that the smaller particles provide relatively high surface area than larger ones. Therefore, the surface area of films increased remarkably from 68.52 m2 g−1 to 116.90 m2 g−1 by adding smaller nanoglue particles, which is desirable for dye loading and light harvesting. The dye loading capacity of the nanoglue-based films was higher than that of the films obtained without the nanoglue. The increased dye loading capacity is expected to lead to enhanced photovoltaic properties of the films, especially, the short-circuit current density (JSC) and efficiency (η).

3 Electronic properties of the nanoglue-based TiO2 films
EIS was carried out in the dark to elucidate the correlation between electron transport and the amount of nanoglue in the film. Under forward bias, electrons were injected from the FTO substrate into the TiO2 particles, and the film was charged by this electron propagation through the mesoscopic TiO2 network. Meanwhile, a fraction of the injected conduction band electrons was lost by the reduction of I−3 ions in the electrolyte. The fitted data of the electron transport resistances and the capacitances obtained from the Nyquist plots for various samples with varying amounts of nanoglue measured under different forward biases are plotted in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The equivalent circuit for the fitting process is given in Fig. 5(c). The time constant can be calculated by eqn (1). τr = RctCμ(1)where Rct and Cμ are the charge transport resistance and the chemical capacitance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, respectively. The time constant τr is known to be the parameter that determines the lifetime of the injected electron in the conduction band of TiO2. The chemical capacitance is an equilibrium property that relates the variation of the carrier density to the displacement of the Fermi level.25 The calculated time constant is plotted in Fig. 5(c). Rct gradually decreased with increasing amounts of nanoglue, indicating that more recombination between electrons (in the conduction band of TiO2) with I−3 took place at the TiO2–electrolyte interface due to the increased number of recombination sites (such as surface defects) since the smaller nanoglue particles have more surface states (defect sites) than larger P25 particles. However, Cμ did not show any remarkable change. In addition, the time constant τr exhibited clear differences and decreased as the amount of nanoglue in the films increased, which indicates the shorter electron life time of injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and accounts for the gradual decrease in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) for cells containing larger amounts of nanoglue.
 Fig. 5  (a) Charge transfer resistance, (b) chemical capacitance, and (c) calculated electron lifetime at the TiO2–electrolyte interface. The cells were prepared with films containing various amounts of nanoglue. The impedance was measured in the dark by sweeping forward bias potentials. The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset in (c). 
With a decrease in the forward bias potential from 0.70 to 0.60 V, electron transport in the mesoscopic TiO2 film appeared to exhibit a distinct Warburg-like diffusion behavior in the high-frequency region, and the interfacial charge recombination process at the interface of TiO2–dye–electrolyte was denoted by a semicircle in the low-frequency region of the Nyquist plot. These behaviors observed in the electronic properties of the DSC are well described by a transmission line model,26–29 as shown in Scheme 1. In the transmission line model, there are two channels in parallel, one representing electron transport through TiO2 and the other denoting the redox species transport in the electrolyte present in the pores. The charge transfer process related to the recombination of electrons with I−3 ions at the TiO2–electrolyte interface is described by these two channels. If L is the thickness of the mesoscopic TiO2 film, the electron transport resistance in the TiO2 film is Rt (=rctL), while the interfacial charge recombination resistance is Rct (=rct/L) and the chemical capacitance is Cμ (=cμL).

The impedance spectra of the films shown in Fig. 6(a) exhibited ideal characteristics of the diffusion-recombination model with Rct ≫ Rt, which were measured at a forward bias of 0.7 V in the dark. In this case, the electron transport and recombination behavior could be quantitatively examined by fitting the spectra in Fig. 6(a) by Z-view software.
 Fig. 6  (a) Impedance spectra of cells made from films containing various amounts of nanoglue. The spectra were measured in the dark with a moderate forward applied potential. (b) Fitted Rt and Rct and calculated Dn values from the impedance spectra. 
From the fitted data, we could calculate the evolution of parameters such as chemical electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) based on eqn (2).25 Dn = L2/(RtCμ)(2)
The fitted Rt and Rct values and the calculated Dn values were plotted as shown in Fig. 6(b). The Rt decreased with increasing amounts of nanoglue, exhibited the lowest value in films containing 20 wt% nanoglue, and then increased slightly in films containing 30 wt% nanoglue. The calculated Dn showed an increasing trend with nanoglue addition, reached its maximum value for films with 20 wt% nanoglue, and then finally reduced marginally for the highest amount of nanoglue used in this study. The decreasing Rt and increasing Dn tendencies clearly indicate that the enhanced electron transport behavior in nanoglue-based films mainly stems from the improved nanoparticle interconnection induced by the presence of the nanoglue. At the same time, the large cracks generated by adding 30 wt% nanoglue seemed undesirable for electron transport, resulting in a marginal increase in Rt and decrease in Dn. Photocurrent transient spectroscopy was also performed to investigate the electron transport behavior in TiO2 films, as is shown in Fig. 7. The tendency of electron diffusion coefficient (De) gradation measured from the photocurrent transient spectroscopic analysis is in good agreement with that obtained from EIS. Furthermore, it was also noticed that the Rct decreases as the amount of nanoglue was increased, which is unfavorable for the realization of efficient DSCs due to the severe recombination. However, the final conversion efficiency still revealed an increasing gradation even in cells with films containing up to 20 wt% of nanoglue.
 Fig. 7  Electron diffusion coefficient De of cells containing different amounts of nanoglue. De values were derived from the electron collection time using the equation De = L2/(2.35τc), where L is the thickness of the TiO2 film and τc is the collection time constant. 
The competition between the collection and recombination of electrons in the DSCs can be expressed in terms of the electron diffusion length (Ln) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc). For an efficient cell, it is essential to accomplish larger Ln and higher ηcc values at any bias voltage between short-circuit and open-circuit.30 The Ln and ηcc can be calculated according to eqn (3) and (4).26,31 (3) (4)
For the calculations, the values of Rct and Rt were taken from the EIS results. The highest values of Ln and ηcc were 7.5 μm and 87%, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. These values were achieved with the cells containing films with 20 wt% nanoglue. This suggests that the electron transport was dominant over electron recombination, which originates from the glue induced interconnection of TiO2 particles and critically governs the cell performance.

4 Device performances
The photocurrent–voltage curves and IPCE are plotted in Fig. 9 to examine the effect of nanoglue content on the photovoltaic properties of the films, which are also summarized in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, the cell based on P25 without any added nanoglue showed a JSC value of 5.90 mA cm−2. The values gradually increased with an increase in the amount of nanoglue and exhibited a maximum value of 7.40 mA cm−2 in samples containing 20 wt% of nanoglue. The IPCE values in Fig. 9(b) also confirmed the increasing tendency of JSC value with increasing amounts of nanoglue. It can also be noted that VOC decreased from 779 to 750 mV with increasing amounts of nanoglue. However, the fill factor (FF) showed similar values irrespective of the amount of nanoglue. Consequently, η presented the highest value of 4.09% in the samples with 20 wt% nanoglue, and JSC was considered to be a critical factor for the determination of conversion efficiency. Considering the relatively thin film thickness of less than 3 μm, a cell prepared by a low-temperature process exhibiting an efficiency of 4.09% can be assumed to be an efficient photovoltaic device.5 The photovoltaic properties are also compared in Fig. 10. It is evident that JSC and η represented similar trends.

 Fig. 10  Comparison of the photovoltaic properties of cells based on films containing various amounts of nanoglue. 
For better cell performance, large TiO2 particles (320 nm) were used as light scattering centers and their weight ratio in the paste was fixed at 30 wt% for all the particles. In addition, the main P25 particles in the original paste were also replaced by autoclaved TiO2 particles with a diameter of 20 nm, synthesized by an in-house process, according to procedures described elsewhere.4 Viscous pastes containing the nanoglue, 20 nm sized particles, and large scattering particles were formulated according to the process previously described in the Experimental section. To examine the performance on flexible substrates, this optimized paste was coated onto a plastic ITO/PEN substrate. The film thickness, maintained at around 6.45 μm, was slightly lesser than the maximum diffusion length of 7.5 μm. The photocurrent–voltage curves together with the IPCE data were plotted and are shown in Fig. 11. The JSC value of the cell fabricated on the plastic substrate reached 10.75 mA cm−2; VOC, 732 mV; FF, 69%; and conversion efficiency, 5.43%. The observed conversion efficiency is one of the best results reported so far for cells fabricated with N719 dye.5–7,9 It is expected that further improvement in the cell conversion efficiency can be achieved by adopting new organic dyes with higher molar extinction coefficients,31 optimizing the electrolyte component,7 and even modifying the surface of the ITO for better electron rectification with a highly crystalline TiO2 thin film as the blocking layer.32 Related experimentation is under way at present.

Conclusions
To summarize, an interparticle binding agent, or nanoglue, which facilitates the preparation of well-interconnected TiO2 films at low-temperatures was synthesized by a sol–gel process. The nanoglue, which exhibited a good long-term stability, contained well-crystallized 5 nm TiO2 particles in the anatase phase. The viscosity of the nanoglue-based pastes remarkably increased, facilitating easy coating of TiO2 films. The amount of nanoglue was observed to exercise a significant effect on the structural properties of the films. Smaller pore size and increased surface area were observed in the nanoglue-based films. With the addition of nanoglue, the dye loading capacity was also enhanced, which resulted in higher light harvesting capability. The variations in the photovoltaic properties of the films containing various amounts of the nanoglue were extensively studied. We conclude that the electron transport was facilitated by the addition of nanoglue, which improved the interparticle connections through chemical bonding, and thereby, resulted in faster electron transport. As a result, the electron diffusion length and charge collection efficiency were both enhanced in the nanoglue-based cells. By the optimization of the paste components, a high conversion efficiency of 5.43% was achieved in cells fabricated on a plastic substrate, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported in the literature for such cells. Further experimentation toward improving the conversion efficiency of the plastic solar cells is underway.
