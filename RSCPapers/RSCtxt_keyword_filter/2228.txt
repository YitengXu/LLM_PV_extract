Introduction
In the past few years, solution-processable organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites with the structural formula ABX3 (A = MA+ (CH3NH3+), and FA+ (CH3(NH2)2+), B = Pb2+, Sn2+, and X = I−, Br−, and Cl−) have gained a wide range of interest due to their enormous applications in light-harvesting and -emitting devices, including high-efficiency photovoltaics, photo-detectors, LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and lasers.1–4 Despite the exciting progress made in organic–inorganic hybrid compounds, their universal instability attributed to organic cations under environmental stresses remains a major obstacle for their application on an industrial scale.5 Thus, all-inorganic perovskites without volatile organic components are highly desired. Compared to the enthusiastic discussions of these organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the studies on their inorganic analogues, such as CsPbX3, are not as advanced. Nonetheless, Cs-based perovskites were shown to exhibit better compositional stability against environmental stresses.6–8 One such inspiring example is CsPbI3, which is distinguished as a direct-bandgap photoelectric material9 by virtue of its added advantages of high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, low defect density, and long carrier diffusion lifetimes.10–13 Recently, an encouraging high power conversion efficiency of 10.77% was obtained based on CsPbI3 quantum dot (QD) solar cells, which stands out among QD solar cell technologies.6 However, akin to the notorious phase-related stability issue encountered by bulk CsPbI3, QD CsPbI3 also spontaneously transformed from its desired cubic phase to the inactive orthorhombic phase when it was deposited as a thin solid film and directly exposed to ambient air.6 For bulk CsPbI3, it adopts a desired cubic phase (“black phase” or α-CsPbI3) with a bandgap of 1.73 eV at elevated temperature (>305 °C). The common phase of CsPbI3 at room temperature is a large-bandgap, orthorhombic “yellow” phase (δ-CsPbI3) which is undesirable for photovoltaic applications. From the standpoint of thermodynamics, the yellow δ-phase is enthalpically favored, while black α-CsPbI3 is entropically favored. The phase transition is the result of their competing contributions.14 Another theory to explain the phase-related stability issue is that the cesium cation is too small to form a stable perovskite structure.14,15 In view of the above, such poorly understood undesirable spontaneous phase transitions faced by both bulk and QD CsPbI3 not only exclude the actual potential use of them but also prevent the studies revealing their intrinsic physicochemical properties. Many methods have been developed or suggested to access the metastable bulk or QD CsPbI3 such as dimension engineering,16 alloying with Br− in X sites,17 anion exchange,18 using hydroiodic acid in the film deposition,19 or solvent engineering.20 Nevertheless, dimension engineering leads to a lower power conversion efficiency due to introduction of a two-dimensional (2D) structure. Alloying with Br− in X sites results in an undesirable increase in the band gap and the loss of absorption in the red-light region. The rest of the methods could not get stable α-CsPbI3 after long-time storage, especially when they were exposed to moist ambient air. Very recently, additive methods including employing small molecules and polymers, such as two-dimensional ethylenediamine lead iodide (EDAPbI4),21 sulfobetaine zwitterions,22 poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),23 and poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP),24 were developed to stabilize α-CsPbI3 by several groups.
In this work, it was demonstrated that employing a small quantity of triple cation NH3+C2H4NH2+C2H4NH3+ (denoted as DETA3+, in the form of diethylenetriamine iodide (DETAI3)) without introducing the layered low-dimensional structure could effectively stabilize α-CsPbI3 for 60 d via a facile one-step deposition method without any encapsulation. Through utilizing multiple characterization methods (FT-IR, XRD, UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, PL, TRPL, XPS, Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurement), we ascribed the remarkable improvement of phase-stability for CsPbI3 to three aspects: the reduction of CsPbI3 crystalline grains, avoiding spontaneous octahedral tilting and enhancement of the hydrophobicity of inorganic perovskite layers. The reduction of CsPbI3 crystalline grains was caused by the retarded crystallization process resulted from the Lewis acid–base interaction between the electron lone pairs in the oxygen atoms of DMF with the precursor cation DETA3+. Ionic bonds between NH3+ or RNH2+ groups in DETA3+ and I− of [PbI6]4− in CsPbI3 lattices on the surfaces or grain boundaries were expected to cross-link the adjacent CsPbI3 crystal units, avoid the octahedral tilting and keep the Pb–I–Pb bond at 180°,25 rendering them less prone to the unwanted phase transition to a δ structure. The enhancement of the hydrophobicity of inorganic perovskite layers was caused by the oil-wet (hydrophobic) hydrocarbon chains of DETA3+ aggregated on the surfaces. The best solar cell showed a PCE of 7.89% and retained 92% of its initial PCE after storage for 1008 h in a dark dry box (Note 1, ESI†) without any encapsulation. Additionally, some other polycationic organic ammonium iodides, such as ethylenediamine iodide (EDAI2) and pyrazine iodide (PZI2), were found to be effective in stabilizing α-CsPbI3, signifying that introducing a small quantity of polycationic organic ammonium iodide into the precursor was a general effective approach to solve the phase-related issue of CsPbI3.
Results and discussion
The CsPbI3 thin films were deposited by spin-coating a precursor solution containing stoichiometric amounts of CsI and HPbI3 dissolved in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. A small quantity of DETAI3 was introduced into CsPbI3 precursor, and these samples are denoted as CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.075). The as-spun films were difficult to crystallize during spin-coating because of the Lewis acid–base interaction between the electron lone pairs in the oxygen atoms of DMF and the precursor cations, Cs+ and Pb2+ and DETA3+.26 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements were conducted to confirm the Lewis acid–base interaction, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The intensity of the transmittance peak at 1656 cm−1 decreased from 13.2% to 12.7%, 11.6%, and 10.5% upon adding 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% DETAI3 to the precursor, respectively, signifying that the effective CO bond strength in DMF was weakened owing to the Lewis acid–base interaction between DETA3+ and DMF. Further evidence for the existence of the Lewis acid–base interaction was confirmed by the Tyndall effect, as shown in Fig. 1c. When a red laser passed through the solutions, the light beam could be observed, which signifies that these solutions were colloidal dispersions in the mesoscale. As a result, the complete conversion time to perovskite from the precursors was prolonged from ∼20 min (x = 0) to ∼40 min (x = 0.075), indicating that the crystallization process was retarded due to the Lewis acid–base interaction between DETA3+ and DMF. A previous study revealed that a slow crystallization process was beneficial for the formation of high-quality perovskite films.27 The retarded crystallization process would induce the formation of more CsPbI3 nuclei during the annealing process so that crystalline grains were expected to be smaller with the addition of DETAI3. To verify this theory, the morphology of the perovskite films synthesized from the four different precursors was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. With the content (x) of DETAI3 increasing, the crystalline grains of CsPbI3 decreased from an average 289 nm (x = 0) to an average 75 nm (x = 0.075). Reducing grain size would lead to an increase of the surface/volume ratio, giving rise to the stabilization of certain phases which were unstable in the bulk material because of the dominant contribution of surface energy to the total Gibbs energy. A similar mechanism could be observed in other material systems.28–30 Hence, the reduction of the CsPbI3 grain size was considered to be an important inducement for the stabilization effect. However, only reduction of the grain size is not enough to stabilize CsPbI3 at the black α-phase for a long time. Previous studies19,20 showed that introducing hydroiodic acid could also reduce the grain size of CsPbI3 but failed to keep it at the black α-phase for a long time. Other important reasons for this phase-stability improvement will be explained in the ensuing chapters. To test if the phase-stability was improved, we conducted UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to CsPbI3·xDETAI3 films. The as-prepared fresh CsPbI3 films showed an absorbance onset of ∼717 nm in Fig. 3a, signifying a bandgap of 1.73 eV, consistent with previous reports.17,19 After these films were aged for less than 12 h in a dark dry box, the black α-CsPbI3 films turned into a yellow δ-phase spontaneously with an absorbance peak located at ∼416 nm as shown in Fig. 3e, indicating an undesirable large bandgap for photovoltaic applications.31 In Fig. 3c, the UV-vis spectrum of the CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3 film aged for 60 d shows no significant difference compared with that of fresh ones, showing the long-term phase stability of these films. XRD spectra of fresh CsPbI3 films and CsPbI3 films aged for less than 12 h are shown in Fig. 3b. The as-prepared CsPbI3 crystallized in the high-symmetry cubic α-CsPbI3 structure (space group Pm3m, a = 6.2 Å). After being aged for less than 12 h, these films turned into an orthorhombic δ phase (space group Pnma, a = 10.462 Å, b = 4.797 Å, c = 17.788 Å, Fig. 1d). As confirmed in Fig. 3d, the XRD spectrum of CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3 films aged for 60 d shows no obvious difference compared with that of fresh ones, consistent with the results of UV-vis spectra.

The above results demonstrate the superior improvement in the phase stability of CsPbI3 by introducing a small quantity of DETAI3. We adopted a planar configuration (FTO/compact-TiO2/CsPbI3·xDETAI3/HTM/Au) to fabricate PSCs based on these CsPbI3·xDETAI3 perovskites, as shown in Fig. 4a. The photovoltaic parameters extracted from J–V curves (Fig. 4b) are listed in Table 1. We found that CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0.025 to 0.075) devices showed a better performance than that based on pure CsPbI3. As shown in Fig. 2, the size of pinholes decreased from ∼210 nm (x = 0) to ∼40 nm (x = 0.05). In addition, some bright areas could be found in the edge of the pinholes in the CsPbI3·DETAI3 (x = 0) samples. This is evidence of the fringe effect. The increase of the secondary electron scattering areas close to the sample surfaces resulted in the abnormal increase of secondary electron emission in the edge region. Consequently, the brightness of the edge of the pinholes increased. Bare compact-TiO2 could even been seen in the CsPbI3·DETAI3 (x = 0) samples. This information suggested that pinholes were very deep in the CsPbI3·DETAI3 (x = 0) samples, which would cause severe combination and consequent reduction of VOC and FF. However, when a small quantity of DETAI3 was added to the precursor, the fringe effect disappeared. The enhancement of VOC, FF and PCE is ascribed to the surface passivation effect of DETAI3, the reduction of the size and depth of pinholes and higher-quality films with reduced trap-assisted recombination. The slight decrease in JSC resulted from the reduction of the crystal size and the augmentation of numbers of grain boundaries. The best performing solar cell using CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3 showed a PCE of 7.89% in a reverse voltage scan. Although the devices presented here are not the most efficient, with further optimization it is likely that they could perform as well as the hybrid organic–inorganic material with higher stability. Hysteresis between different scan directions similar to that of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs was also found in our planar structures (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 4c, the device performance was highly reproducible, caused by the reduction of the size and depth of pinholes and higher-quality films with reduced trap-assisted recombination (longer carrier lifetime). The maximum power point tracking test based on the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0, 0.05) PSC was conducted at a bias voltage of 0.54 V and 0.83 V, respectively, for 120 min in a humid environment (∼30 °C, 60–70% RH), as shown in Fig. S2.† The CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0) PSC could only retain 3% of the initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking test. The color of the film (x = 0) changed from dark brown to light yellow after the maximum power point tracking test, which suggested a phase transition from the α to the δ phase. However, the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0.05) PSC could retain about 91% of its initial PCE. In addition, there was no obvious change of the color of perovskite films after the maximum power point tracking test, signifying no phase transition. The integrated JSC calculated from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) agrees with the values extracted from J–V curves (Fig. 4c). As shown in Fig. 4e, the CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3 films could remain stable for 48 h at 80 °C, showing good thermal stability. The best solar cell based on CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3 films exhibited good stability because it could retain around 92% of the initial efficiency after storing in a dark dry box for 1008 h without any encapsulation (Fig. 4f).

XRD patterns of CsPbI3·xDETAI3 are shown in Fig. 5a. Irrespective of their DETAI3 content (x), all of the XRD patterns could be indexed to the α-CsPbI3. No peaks (below 2θ = 10°) in CsPbI3·xDETAI3 samples were found, which suggests that a layered low-dimensional structure was not formed. We noted that with the increase of the content (x) of DETAI3, the intensity of the XRD peaks decreased, indicating the decrease of crystal size. Such a confinement effect was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 2), the blueshift of the absorption onset (Fig. 5b) and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 5c). These results match well with a previous report32 which is ascribed to the blueshift of optical spectra to the reduced crystal size even when the crystal size is bigger than the Bohr radius. Since it is important to understand the photophysical properties of the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 films for developing high-performance solar cells, we investigated the steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) with 420 nm photo-excitation and the results are shown in Fig. 5c and d. In Fig. 5c, we found a slight blueshift of the PL peak with the content (x) of DETAI3 increasing. The PL decay profiles obtained at the ∼720 nm PL peak using a time-correlated single photon counting technique elucidates the differences in the charge carrier recombination behaviors of the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 films. The decay profiles of these films could be fitted by the following mono-exponential function (1), which gave an exponential decay constant. (1)

The carrier lifetime (τ) of each kind of CsPbI3·xDETAI3 film is shown in Fig. 5d. The pure CsPbI3 films exhibited a carrier lifetime of 10.9 ns, yet with the 5% addition of DETAI3, the lifetime was prolonged to 19.5 ns. The carrier lifetime in these perovskite films accounted for various radiative and non-radiative losses responsible for photoexcited carrier recombination.33 The longer lifetime caused by adding DETAI3 suggested higher-quality films with reduced trap-assisted recombination.
To further investigate the composition and chemical environment of the constituents in perovskite materials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on these films, as shown in Fig. 6. The binding energy of 400.3 eV corresponding to the N 1s of DETAI3 established the presence of DETAI3 in these films (Fig. 6a). The atomic ratio of Cs, Pb, I, N and Pb/Cs ratio, I/Cs ratio were listed in Table 2. For pure CsPbI3, the Pb/Cs ratio and I/Cs ratio were 0.62 and 2.3, respectively, which should be 1.0 and 3.0, suggesting large vacancies of Pb and I on the surface of CsPbI3 films. The large vacancies of Pb and I on the surface of CsPbI3 films gave another reasonable explanation of its unstable black phase. The excess Cs ions were expected to generate a large number of dangling bonds which could absorb moisture to accelerate its phase transition. Nevertheless, by adding 5% DETAI3 to the precursor, the Pb/Cs ratio and I/Cs ratio increased to 0.85 and 3.35, respectively. Additionally, we note that by increasing the content (x) of DETAI3, a slight shift of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and I 3d toward small binding energy increases in these films, suggesting that DETAI3 was incorporated or absorbed into the CsPbI3 crystal and formed chemical bonds with the CsPbI3 lattice. To clarify that DETAI3 was incorporated into the CsPbI3 crystal or just absorbed on the surface of CsPbI3, Raman spectroscopy was conducted on CsPbI3·xDETAI3 films and DETAI3 powder, as shown in Fig. 7. No Raman peaks of DETAI3, such as 767 cm−1, 882 cm−1 and 2953 cm−1, could be found in the samples of CsPbI3·xDETAI3 films. This information suggested that DETAI3 was not incorporated into CsPbI3 lattices but surface absorbed because signals from surface DETAI3 were too weak to be detected by normal Raman measurements34 but XPS measurements confirmed that DETAI3 was existent in CsPbI3·xDETAI3 samples. We assumed that DETAI3 was absorbed on the surface and grain boundaries by the ionic bonds of the NH3+ or RNH2+ group of DETAI3 with I− in the CsPbI3 crystal, as shown in Fig. 8. The length of a DETA3+ cation is estimated to be 6.6 Å, while the length of a unit of α-CsPbI3 is 6.2 Å. Therefore, it seemed to be impossible to incorporate DETAI3 into α-CsPbI3 lattices because it is so large that it violates the geometric tolerance factor rules regarding perovskite structure stabilization. Hence, a DETA3+ cation was expected to cross-link a CsPbI3 unit with the adjacent one on the surface of CsPbI3 grains by ionic bonds. As depicted in Fig. 6, the Cs ion radius (1.67 Å) is not large enough to fill the cuboctahedral voids between [PbI6]4− polyhedral frames,16,19,35 and hence octahedral tilting is spontaneous and the bond angle (θ) of the Pb–I–Pb bond could not remain at 180°, giving rise to the spontaneous phase transition from α to δ at room temperature. These ionic bonds confirmed by the XPS measurements worked like a plank used to fix unstable structures to cross-link the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal units, avoid the octahedral tilting and keep the Pb–I–Pb bond at 180°.

As a proof-of-concept, analogues of DETAI3 with two amino groups such as ethylenediamine iodide (EDAI2) and pyrazine iodide (PZI2) were added to the CsPbI3 precursor. XRD patterns showed that CsPbI3 films with EDAI2 or PZI2 could keep the α phase for 60 d in a dark dry box, as shown in Fig. S3.† This result matched well with our theory of ionic bonds on the surface or grain boundaries. However, we also tried other analogues with a single amino group such as ammonium iodide (NH4I), methylamine iodide (MAI), and butylamine iodide (BAI) with the percentage of 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% into the CsPbI3 precursor. All of them failed to stabilize CsPbI3 at the black α-phase within 12 h even in a dark dry box. These small molecules with a single amino group were expected to form ionic bonds on the surface and grain boundaries like their three cation analogues. But they failed to cross-link adjacent units of CsPbI3 due to the single amino group and so they could not stabilize CsPbI3 at the black α-phase. To clarify if the chemical bond formed between DETAI3 and the CsPbI3 crystal is the ionic bond between NH3+ or RNH2+ groups and I− of [PbI6]4− or hydrogen bond between the H atom of NH3+ or RNH2+ groups and I− of [PbI6]4−, the formamidinium cation (CH3(NH2)2+, FA+) with two NH2 groups and guanidinium cation (C(NH2)3+, Gua+) with three NH2 groups were added to the CsPbI3 precursor. Both of them failed to stabilize CsPbI3. If the chemical bonds formed at the surface were hydrogen bonds, then FA+ and Gua+ would also work even more effective than DETA3+ as their molecules are smaller so that they could incorporate into the CsPbI3 crystal lattice to avoid the octahedral tilting. This information further suggested that NH3+ or NH2+ groups worked as an entirety to form ionic bonds with I− of [PbI6]4− rather than hydrogen bonds.
A previous report revealed that the moisture adsorbed on the CsPbI3 surfaces could effectively catalyze the α to δ phase transition at room temperature by importing vacancies to the crystal lattices and lowering the energy barrier to nucleation.36 Hence, we studied the moisture resistance of these inorganic perovskite films using contact angle measurements with water, as shown in Fig. 9a–c. For pristine α-CsPbI3 films, the contact angle with water is 50.8°. When a small amount of DETAI3 (x = 0.05) was added, the contact angle increased to 66.1°. The increasing contact angle against water demonstrated a more hydrophobic layer, providing another rational explanation for its enhanced phase stability. The hydrocarbon chains (CH2–CH2) of DETAI3 aligned or aggregated to form a hydrocarbon chain surface, and then separated from the surrounding water which greatly improved its hydrophobicity, as shown in Fig. 9d and e. Nevertheless, the contact angle decreased sharply to 21.5° for γ-CsPbI3, indicating more hygroscopicity of this structure. The decreasing contact angle from 50.8° to 21.5° agreed with previous studies14,37 for the role of moisture in the phase transition process at room temperature. We conducted the stability test in a humid environment (∼30 °C, 60–70% RH). The phase transition from α to δ could be observed by the change in color of films from brown to yellow. We took photographs of CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0, 0.05) films. As depicted in Fig. S4,† the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0) film showed a fast phase transition within 1 h. When it was exposed to a humid environment for 55 min, the color of the film turned light yellow, suggesting a complete phase transition. However, the color of the CsPbI3·xDETAI3 (x = 0.05) film remained unchanged after it was exposed to a humid environment for 55 min. In fact, it could keep the α phase for ∼6 h in the humid environment. The above discussions suggested that the phase-stability of CsPbI3 was remarkably improved in a humid environment.

Conclusions
In summary, a small quantity of triple cation DETA3+ was introduced in the precursor to stabilize α-CsPbI3 for at least 60 d via a facile one-step deposition method without any encapsulation. Reasons for the remarkable improvement of phase-stability for CsPbI3 were generalized into three aspects: the reduction of CsPbI3 crystalline grains, avoiding spontaneous octahedral tilting caused by ionic bonds between NH3+ or RNH2+ groups of DETA3+ and I− of [PbI6]4− in CsPbI3 perovskite crystals and enhancement of the hydrophobicity of inorganic perovskite layers. The best solar cell with the configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/CsPbI3·0.05DETAI3/P3HT/Au showed a PCE of 7.89% with and improved VOC and FF of up to 1.06 V and 0.61, respectively, and retained 92% of its initial PCE after storage for 1008 h in a dark dry box without any encapsulation. Besides, EDAI2 and PZI2 were also found to be effective to stabilize α-CsPbI3 as a proof-of-concept for our ionic bond theory, indicating that employing a small quantity of polycationic organic ammonium iodide with two or three amino groups is a general effective approach to solve the formidable phase-related issue encountered by CsPbI3. We believe that our results represent a turning point among those attempts to stabilize α-CsPbI3, paving the way for its actual use and further studies. Based on our findings, more analogues of DETAI3 with better photoelectric properties for CsPbI3 are expected to be found or designed by the community. Moreover, the method of this phase manipulation was also expected to be utilized in stabilizing the black active phase of other perovskite photoelectrical materials, such as FAPbI3, CsSnI3, and FASnI3 in the future.
