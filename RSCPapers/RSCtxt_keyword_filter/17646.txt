    , Accepted 20th April 2015First published on 21st April 2015AbstractThe co-sensitization of N719 with conjugated polyphenylenes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was demonstrated. The conjugated polyphenylenes (6-BC and 7-BC), which contain two triphenylamine (TPA) groups as electron donors and carboxylic acids as adsorption groups, were prepared from thermally triggered Bergman cyclization polymerization of two maleimide-based enediynes, 6 and 7. Both the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the co-sensitized DSSCs were enhanced due to the increase in light harvesting and the retardation of electron recombination and dye aggregation when N719 was co-sensitized with the conjugated polyphenylenes. The co-sensitized (7-BC + N719) DSSC showed a high efficiency of 9.68% (VOC of 750 mV, JSC of 18.18 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.71), exhibiting an improvement of 16% compared to the devices sensitized with N719 (PCE of 8.34%) alone under identical conditions.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), one of the most promising candidates for renewable energy, are under intense investigation because of their easy fabrication, low price and high energy conversion efficiency.1,2 Among its constituents, the sensitizer plays a critical role in light-harvesting, and the subsequent charge injection into the conduction band of TiO2 directly affects the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Although various types of sensitizers, such as porphyrin compounds3–8 and metal-free organic dyes,9–13 have been rapidly developed in recent years, Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes14–17 (such as N749 and N3, N719) are regarded as classic sensitizers because of their panchromatic absorption. To date, DSSC sensitizers based on ruthenium complexes have an overall solar energy conversion efficiency (η) exceeding 11%.18 The wide absorptions, which range from the visible to near-infrared (IR) regions, endow DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes with high efficiency; however, their low molar extinction coefficients limit the further enhancement of the efficiency. A major drawback limiting the advancement of DSSCs is uncontrolled charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface19 regardless of the photophysical nature of the dyes. Actually, in most cases, the recombination of the electron in the conduction band of TiO2 with the electrolyte is considered to be the most detrimental to the PCE of DSSCs. To this end, several strategies have been developed to disrupt the undesirable interaction between the electrolyte and the TiO2 electrode such as passivating the surface states of TiO2 with co-adsorbents20–23 (CDCA and DPA), adding a blocking/tunneling layer at the TiO2 surface24–26 (Al2O3, ZnO, and SiO2), incorporating an alkyl chain in the dye backbone,27–29 and post-surface passivation by polymerization.30,31
The co-sensitization of two or more dyes (having complementary absorption bands) is a profound strategy to extend and increase light harvesting ability, and thus the photocurrent in DSSCs. Studies focused on ruthenium complexes co-sensitized with metal-free organic dyes,32–35 hydrophobic organic small molecules18,19 or quantum dots36–38 showed the fact that the ideal candidate for a co-adsorbent should have the following three characteristics. First, it should have a large molar extinction coefficient in the infrared or around 400 nm region to compensate for light-harvest loss by the electrolytes (I−/I3−). Second, the structure of the molecule should effectively suppress the aggregation of the dye on the TiO2 surface. Third, it should be able to reduce the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 film with I3− by forming a compact molecular monolayer covering the bare TiO2 surface.
Here, we developed an effective method to optimize DSSCs based on N719 by co-sensitizing it with conjugated polyphenylenes prepared from maleimide-based enediynes through thermally triggered Bergman cyclization polymerization.39 The polyphenylenes with carboxylic acid groups adsorbed on the unoccupied loci on the TiO2 surface serve as an electrolyte-blocking shell. Both the JSC and the VOC of the co-sensitized DSSCs were significantly enhanced relative to the DSSCs sensitized with N719 alone. By making electron injection more effective and reducing electron recombination, a PCE of 9.68% was obtained for the DSSC based on the co-adsorption system, which was an increase of 16% in comparison with that of a system sensitized by N719 alone. Our approach provides a new strategy for optimizing DSSCs.

Polymerization
The Bergman cyclization polymerizations were performed under vacuum in a sealed glass tube in a heating bath set at the exothermic peak temperature (DSC) of the corresponding enediyne compound for 8 h. The heating bath for the polymerization of 6 used diphenyl ether to reach 260 °C, while xylene was used at 150 °C for 7.
Characterizations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 MHz NMR using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High resolution mass spectra (HR-MS) were obtained using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. MALDI-TOF MS of the polymers were performed on a Mass spectrometer 4800 plus MALDI-TOF/TOF MS Analyzer (AB Sciex, USA) equipped with a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm and operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV in reflection mode. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed with a Bruker EMX-8/2.7. The spectrometer settings were: sweep width, 40 G; time constant, 163.84 ms; conversion time, 40.96 ms; scan time, 83.89 s; 1024 points; modulation amplitude, 1.00 G; and microwave power, 2.0 mW. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a Pyris Diamond thermal analysis work station equipped with a model 822e DSC module under a constant nitrogen flow. The absorption spectra of sensitizer dyes in solution and adsorbed on titania films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained on a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a three-electrode cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl solution. Ferrocene (Fc) was used as an internal reference and 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in CHCl3. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
A 17 μm thick double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode, composed of a 12 μm-thick nanoporous layer and a 5 μm-thick scattering layer (area: 0.25 cm2), was prepared by screen printing on a conducting glass substrate. Dye solutions of 6-BC, 7-BC and compound 8 with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M in CHCl3, and mixed solutions of 6-BC + N719 (1:1) and 7-BC + N719 (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) in acetonitrile/n-butyl alcohol = 1:1 were used to uptake the dye onto the TiO2 film. The TiO2 films were immersed in the dye solution for 16 h. Photovoltaic measurements were performed in a sandwich-type solar cell in conjunction with an electrolyte consisting of a solution of I2 (0.05 M), LiI (0.1 M), dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M), and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (0.5 M) in acetonitrile. The dye-deposited TiO2 film and a piece of platinum-coated conducting glass were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) of the sealed solar cells was measured with a black metal mask of 0.25 cm2 by illuminating the cell through the conducting glass from the anode side with a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10) at AM 1.5 illumination (light intensities: 100 mW cm−2). Monochromatic IPCE was measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons per cm under 100 mW cm−2 in the director current mode measurements, which were made on a CEP-2000 system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co. Ltd.).
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements
EIS experiments were carried out in the dark using a ZAHNER ZENNIUM electrochemical workstation with frequency ranging from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential amplitude of 5 mV. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the ZSimpWin software (v3.10) in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits.
Results and discussion
Conjugated polyphenylenes can be facilely prepared by the thermally triggered Bergman cyclization of maleimide-based enediynes at an elevated temperature.40 The conjugated polyphenylenes (6-BC and 7-BC) with triphenylamine as the electron donor, carboxylic acids as the acceptor/anchor and the maleimide-based enediyne as the bridge between the electron donor and acceptor was synthesized with a similar strategy and used as the co-adsorbents with N719 in DSSCs. The general synthetic routes to prepare the conjugated polyphenylenes are shown in Scheme 1, and the details of the syntheses of the precursors and their characterization data are provided in the ESI.† The enediyne compounds 6 and 7 with ester groups were synthesized via Sonogashira coupling reaction. A methylene bridge is present between the maleimide and the electron acceptor in enediyne 6, while in enediyne 7, a π-bridge (phenylene group) is present, with the expectation of more effective intramolecular electron transport through the bridging group. The two compounds with the enediyne structure undergo thermally triggered Bergman cyclization and the two adjacent carbonyl groups in the maleimide moiety lower the energy barrier of Bergman cyclization, permitting the reaction to take place at moderate temperatures. Moreover, the tert-butyl group was deprotected under the reaction temperatures (>150 °C), forming carboxylic acids as the adsorption groups. The tert-butyl ester protecting groups of compound 7 were removed by treating with trifluoroacetic acid to afford the corresponding carboxylic acid functionalized enediyne compound 8, which was used as a control in a DSSC.

The thermally triggered Bergman cyclization of the enediyne compounds was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. S4a and b† show exothermal peaks at 214 °C for compound 6 and at 138 °C for compound 7, respectively. The thermal-triggered Bergman cyclization polymerization of two enediyne compounds was conducted in a sealed bottle under vacuum to eliminate any species that may quench radicals. The enediyne compounds were heated in a heating bath set around their peak temperature for 8 hours. Purple solids were obtained in a quantitative yield.
The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the oligomer part of 7-BC is shown in Fig. 1a. Several sets of peaks with an m/z interval of 751.24 are observed, which is consistent with the calculated m/z value of a monomer unit of enediyne 7 with the tert-butyl group being removed (751.26). The occurrence of the Bergman cyclization was further confirmed with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).40 Freshly prepared 7-BC was dissolved in chloroform and subjected to EPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1b, the intense peak at around 3519 G indicates the presence of carbon-centered radicals in the sample.41 Moreover, we demonstrated the obvious diminution of the peak at 2177 cm−1 (Fig. S5†) in the FT-IR spectra, which corresponds to the stretching vibration absorption of CC. This further verified the occurrence of Bergman cyclization polymerization.

The UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2a. Both the polymers, 6-BC and 7-BC with similar backbone structure, show a broad absorption range covering a large proportion of the visible region and even extend to near-infrared (NIR) region, indicating the formation of conjugated systems after Bergman cyclization polymerization.42 The higher absorption intensity of 7-BC is mainly due to the presence of the phenyl group, which enhances the degree of conjugation and is conducive to intramolecular electron transfer. The intensive absorption at 307 nm (ε = 67400 M−1 cm−1, shown in Table 1) was assigned to the localized π–π* transitions of the conjugated systems. The defined peak at 486 nm (ε = 19840 M−1 cm−1) corresponds to the n–π* transition in the maleimide moiety. In addition, the mixtures of 7-BC + N719 showed considerably more intensive absorption in all the UV-vis and NIR regions relative to dye N719, while 6-BC + N719 (1:1) only shows negligible enhancement over N719. Moreover, with the decreased ratio of 7-BC, the enhancement effect of 7-BC + N719 mixture system was decreased. The absorptions of the enediyne monomer compound 8 and those of its mixture with N719 were not that strong (Fig. S8†).

The UV-vis absorption of N719, 6-BC, 7-BC, 6-BC + N719 (1:1), 7-BC + N719 on thin TiO2 film (∼4 μm) is shown in Fig. 2b. To obtain the most suitable mixture ratio to optimize the optical absorption properties of the device, films dipped with 7-BC were mixed with N719 in different ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). The maximum absorption peaks of 7-BC + N719 in different ratios on TiO2 films was consistent with respect to those in solution (530 nm), which excludes H or J aggregation in their interactions with the surface of TiO2.43 With decreased 7-BC content, the absorption intensity of the 7-BC + N719 mixture system decreased as well, despite the weak film absorption of 7-BC alone. In contrast, the absorption intensity of 6-BC alone was relatively strong (Fig. S9†), indicating a good adsorption on TiO2. With the intense adsorption competition between 6-BC and N719, the absorption of 6-BC + N719 (1:1) decreased sharply because of the lower adsorbing capacity of N719.
To estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and thus to evaluate the feasibilities of electron injection and dye regeneration, the electrochemical and optical properties of the organic dyes are of prime importance. The electrochemical properties of 6-BC and 7-BC in CHCl3 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3). The measurement shows oxidation potentials of 0.78 V and 0.76 V (vs. NHE) for 6-BC and 7-BC, respectively, which correspond to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the polyphenylene compounds. These values are more positive than the redox couple I−/I3− (∼0.4 V vs. NHE), and thus achieve favorable kinetics for dye regeneration. On the other hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was calculated to be −2.32 V (vs. NHE) for 6-BC and −1.49 V (vs. NHE) for 7-BC, both of which are higher than the conduction band of TiO2 (∼−0.5 V vs. NHE),15 thus enabling efficient charge injection kinetics. The photophysical and electrochemical properties parameters are tabulated in Table 1.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammetry curves of 6-BC and 7-BC in a CHCl3 solution (0.1 M Bu4NPF6). 
Polyphenylene co-adsorbents and dye compound 8, 6-BC, 7-BC, N719 and compound 8 + N719, 6-BC + N719, 7-BC + N719 (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) based devices are denoted as device 1–9, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra of these liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs. Their photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. All the devices based on the two polyphenylene co-adsorbents (6-BC and 7-BC) and enediyne compound 8 showed poor power conversion efficiencies of 0.16% and 0.06%, respectively, under AM 1.5 simulated sun light. Although two conjugated polyphenylene co-adsorbents showed broad light absorption ranges, their performances as sensitizers in DSSCs are not as high as expected. This is because the HOMO energy levels of 6-BC and 7-BC were 0.78 V and 0.76 V, respectively, which are close to the energy level of I−/I3−, leading to a hard regeneration of oxidation state of the dye. In addition, to inject electrons effectively, the energies of the excited dye states (LUMO level) should not only be higher than ECB of TiO2, but also have good orbital overlap with the conduction band of TiO2 (higher than ECB about 0.3 eV (ref. 15, 44 and 45)). Though the LUMO level of 6-BC and 7-BC is higher than the ECB of TiO2, the difference values are very high for an effective overlap with the ECB of TiO2. Thus, the process of electron injection is suppressed and the performances of the DSSC devices based on the polyphenylenes alone are poor. For the co-adsorption systems, devices showed more encouraging results. Devices based on 6-BC + N719 (1:1) showed an efficiency of 7.53%, slightly lower than the device based on N719 (η = 8.34%) alone. This may be caused by the decrease in the absorption of N719 because there is intense competitive adsorption between 6-BC and N719 (see above). Devices based on 7-BC + N719 (1:1) and (1:3) showed efficiencies of 9.02% (VOC of 748 mV, JSC of 17.96 mA cm−2, FF of 0.67) and 8.76% (VOC of 748 mV, JSC of 17.84 mA cm−2, FF of 0.66), respectively, with both the VOC and JSC slightly increased over the N719 (VOC of 731 mV, JSC of 17.33 mA cm−2, FF of 0.66) device. In particular, the device based on 7-BC + N719 (1:2) showed the most optimal performance with a power conversion efficiency of 9.68% (VOC of 750 mV, JSC of 18.18 mA cm−2, FF of 0.71), which was 16% higher in comparison with that of N719 sensitized alone. Compared with the efficiency of the device based on enediyne compound 8 co-sensitized with N719 (η = 5.99%), it can be perceived that the conjugated polyphenylenes generated by the thermally triggered Bergman cyclization polymerization play an important role for the performance improvement of DSSCs.

To investigate the improvement in the co-sensitization of JSC, IPCE spectra were carefully compared with individual sensitization values. The IPCE is associated with the product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), charge injection efficiency (ηinj), and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll).46 As shown in Fig. 4b, the co-sensitizer 7-BC makes a preferable contribution to IPCE improvement in the whole light harvesting range of N719, even though the device based on 7-BC alone showed an IPCE band in a narrow range of UV with a low value (37%). The DSSC sensitized with N719 exhibited a broad IPCE spectrum across the entire visible region extending up to 800 nm and exhibited IPCE values >70% in the range of 470–570 nm. On this basis, 7-BC + N719 systems improved the light harvesting efficiency effectively in the full absorption range. Notably, for the 7-BC + N719 (1:2) device, the value reached the highest at 76%, indicating that the photoinduced charge injection is considerably efficient for this co-sensitization system at short-circuits.
It is observed that the photoelectric properties of all the systems are different from those obtained from the UV-vis absorption measurements on TiO2 films. Though the light harvesting ability of all the 7-BC + N719 co-adsorption systems on film were slightly poorer than N719 alone because the adsorption capacity of N719 was decreased, the performances of the corresponding devices are better than N719. This is probably because the adsorbed 7-BC plays an important role in blocking I3− from approaching the TiO2 surface and reduces electron recombination, which is corroborated by the results of dark current tests (Fig. S11†), or in restraining N719 aggregation to effectively promote the electron injected. Moreover, these benefits counteract the initial loss of light harvesting. In addition, the results of the AM 1.5 studies were in accordance the IPCE results of 6-BC + N719 and 7-BC + N719, suggesting that there are several advantages for using conjugated polyphenylenes with more effective intramolecular electron transport.
The high photocurrent of DSSCs based on 7-BC + N719 is obvious from its higher IPCE response than that of N719. In addition, the insight into its slight higher VOC (about 20 mV higher than N719) is worth being investigated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study electron recombination in DSSCs based on 6-BC + N719 (1:1), 7-BC + N719 (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) and N719 under an bias applied voltage of −0.70 V in the dark. The Nyquist plot, Bode plot, and equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. 5a–c, respectively. In Fig. 5c, RS, RCE and Rrec represent series resistance and charge-transfer resistances at the counter electrode (CE) and dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, respectively.47 The series resistance (RS) and electrolyte reduction resistance (RCE) correspond to the first semicircle and the Rrec corresponds to the middle semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 5a). Generally, for good DSSCs, the VOC performance is closely sensitive to charge transport processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.48–50 Obviously, with the same electrode material and same electrolyte, five DSSCs show close RS and RCE value (see in Table 3). The strategy to restrain charge recombination will increase the radius of the second semicircle (in Nyquist plots), moving the phase angle peak (in Bode plots) to low frequency and increasing the Rrec value.50 Apparently, in Fig. 5a and b, the larger width of the second semicircle of 7-BC + N719 (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) cells and the lower frequency of the phase angle peak indicate a larger charge-transfer resistance (compared to the N719 cell) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Moreover, the Rrec of the 7-BC + N719 in the ratios of 1:1–1:3 are 364.9 Ω, 418.9 Ω and 394.8 Ω, respectively, which are higher than those of N719 (209.8 Ω) and 6-BC + N719 (1:1) (184.2 Ω). The electron lifetime τe can be calculated from the equation 1/2πfp,51 where fp is the peak frequency of lower frequency region in the Bode phase plots. The calculated electron lifetime decreased in the order of 7-BC + N719 (1:2) (115.3 ms) > 7-BC + N719 (1:3) (106.1 ms) > 7-BC + N719 (1:1) (99.5 ms) > N719 (78.4 ms) > 6-BC + N719 (1:1) (53.9 ms), well in line with VOC together with Rrec. Two plausible mechanisms may account for the significantly increased VOC: (1) the aggregation of N719 molecules was effectively inhibited due to the existence of the conjugated polyphenylene 7-BC; therefore, the electron injections were improved; (2) electron recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte was suppressed owning to the formation of an electrolyte-blocking shell with 7-BC on unoccupied loci, lengthening the electron lifetimes.

A long-term stability test was performed for 7-BC + N719 (1:2) co-sensitization system, which showed that the DSSC was stable after 1000 h under full sunlight intensity. The values changed over time for VOC, JSC, FF and PCE, and are plotted in Fig. 6. VOC increased slightly during the first 200 h, and decreased slightly to 745 mV by the end of the test, which is only 5 mV lower than the initial value (750 mV), indicating the good adsorption stability of the co-sensitization system. JSC exhibited a slightly decreasing trend during the period of 1000 h and finally reached 16.84 mA cm−2, which may originate from slow dye degradation. The PCE of the device slowly degraded to 9.13%, remaining at 95% of the initial value after 1000 h of visible-light absorption. The high device stability demonstrates that the dye desorption process on TiO2 surface is negligible.

Conclusions

N719 co-sensitization with conjugated polyphenylenes from maleimide-based enediynes through thermally triggered Bergman cyclization polymerization was investigated. The conjugated polyphenylene oligomers on the TiO2 electrode act as an electrolyte-blocking shell that effectively suppresses electron recombination with the electrolyte, and restrains the aggregation of N719 to effectively promote electron injection, leading to efficiency enhancement. An improved PCE up to 9.68% was obtained due to the increased JSC, in addition to an enhanced VOC relative to that of N719 (PCE = 8.34%) sensitized alone. The JSC was increased because the light absorption loss induced by the decreased adsorption capacity of N719 was counteracted by more effective electron injection. The enhancement in VOC was caused by the significant inhibition of electron recombination and dye aggregation when N719 was co-sensitized with 7-BC. Overall, our approach provides a new strategy for optimizing DSSCs.
