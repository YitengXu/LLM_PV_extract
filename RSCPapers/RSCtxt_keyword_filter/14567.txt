To facilitate the electron extraction efficiency in pero-HSCs and to make this efficiency comparable with that of the holes, we fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) pero-HSCs by mixing perovskite materials with water-/alcohol-soluble fullerene derivatives. The observed enhanced short-circuit current densities (JSC) and enlarged fill factors (FF) were a result of the balance in the charge carrier extraction efficiency and the enlarged interfacial area between the perovskite materials and the fullerene derivatives. Significantly improved power conversion efficiencies were obtained for these BHJ pero-HSCs. A greater than 22% increase in power conversion efficiency was observed for the BHJ pero-HSCs compared with planar heterojunction pero-HSCs. A remarkable 86.7% FF, the highest reported value for pero-HSCs, was observed for the BHJ pero-HSCs. Our strategy of using a BHJ structure in pero-HSCs offers an efficient and simple way to further increase the performance of these devices.

Broader context
Efficiently and economically harnessing solar energy via photovoltaic (PV) devices is one of the most promising solutions to the global energy crisis. However, over 80% of the available PVs are silicon-based and/or inorganic thin-film solar cells, which are expensive and require critical processing techniques. Organic PV cells have been developed to lower the costs, but their efficiency still lags behind their inorganic counterparts. Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have shown great potential as novel, highly efficient and low-cost PV devices. However, the fundamental limitation of unbalanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite materials requires a mesoporous structure and/or a highly conductive electron transfer layer to balance the charge extraction efficiencies, which complicates device processing. We report here a simple method of fabricating bulk heterojunction (BHJ) perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) from a BHJ composite consisting of perovskite materials blended with water-/alcohol-soluble fullerene derivatives to balance the charge extraction efficiencies. A greater than 22% enhanced efficiency was observed from these BHJ pero-HSCs compared with planar heterojunction pero-HSCs. This fabrication method for BHJ pero-HSCs offers an efficient and simple way to increase the efficiency of pero-HSCs.

Introduction
Cost-effective and high-performance photovoltaic cells are currently being investigated in both the academic and industrial sectors.1–7 Methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX3) perovskites have attracted much attention as novel photovoltaic materials as a result of their excellent optical and electrical properties.8–10 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >17% have been reported for perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs).11 However, as a result of the unbalanced electron–hole diffusion lengths (the diffusion length for the electrons is shorter than that for the holes; Leff, e−/Leff, h+ < 1),12 there is a fundamental limitation to increasing the PCEs of pero-HSCs.13 To circumvent these problems, meso-superstructured pero-HSCs (MS pero-HSCs) and planar heterojunction pero-HSCs (PHJ pero-HSCs) have been developed. In MS pero-HSCs, meso-structured titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as the electron transport layer (ETL) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is used as the insulating scaffold to ensure efficient charge carrier separation by enlarging the interfacial area.14–17 However, the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 contributes an additional charge transport resistance within TiO2 itself,18 resulting in low PCEs for MS pero-HSCs. In addition, TiO2 needs to be sintered at high temperatures, which means that MS pero-HSCs are incompatible with large-scale, high-throughput manufacturing and fabrication on flexible plastic substrates. In PHJ pero-HSCs, solution-processed n-type materials, such as fullerene derivatives with high electrical conductivity, are required for the ETL.19–22 However, the electron extraction efficiencies of these n-type materials are still not high enough because the interface between the perovskite materials and fullerene derivatives is insufficient, which prevents any further increase in the PCE of PHJ pero-HSCs. In addition, in both MS pero-HSCs and PHJ pero-HSCs, the coarse surface of the solution-processed perovskite layer not only creates a poor contact between the fullerene derivative and the perovskite film, which decreases the electron extraction efficiency, but also introduces a large shunt resistance, resulting in a large leakage current and a low fill factor (FF). As a result, low PCEs are observed for these pero-HSCs.23–26
We report here bulk heterojunction (BHJ) pero-HSCs fabricated by blending perovskite materials with fullerene derivatives to improve the electron extraction efficiency. An increased short-circuit current density (JSC) and an increased FF with correspondingly enhanced PCEs were observed for these BHJ pero-HSCs. A remarkable FF of 86.7%, the highest reported for pero-HSCs, was obtained for the BHJ pero-HSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from Clevious and 1-Material Inc., respectively, and were used as received without further purification. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide, ethanol (99.5%), hydroiodic acid (99.99%) and methylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received without further purification. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized following a previously reported method.27
A10C60 fullerene derivative
A10C60 is a fullerene derivative, where A is a carboxylic acid group regiospecifically functionalized on the C60 head, which imparts hydrophilicity on the surface of C60. A10C60 was synthesized according to a previously reported method.28 An HP 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption spectrum of a thin film of A10C60 spin-cast onto a quartz substrate from an ethanol solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a Gamry Reference 3000 instrument. We used a saturated silver chloride (AgCl) reference electrode, a glassy carbon working electrode and a platinum electrode counter. The CV curves were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere in an ethanol solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte. The concentrations of the analytes were between 0.50 and 1.0 mmol L−1. The potentials were calibrated with respect to the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode.
Preparation of the perovskite precursor
A PbI2 solution with a concentration of 400 mg mL−1 was prepared by dissolving PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide. The PbI2 solution was stored overnight to give a clear PbI2 supernatant after stirring at 70 °C for 12 h. A pure MAI solution with a concentration of 70 mg mL−1 was prepared by dissolving MAI in ethanol for further attenuation. A10C60 solutions with concentrations from 0 to 40 mg mL−1 were prepared by dissolving A10C60 in ethanol. A mixed MAI:A10C60 solution was prepared by simultaneously mixing the MAI and A10C60 solutions together. The concentration of MAI in both the pristine MAI ethanol solution and the MAI:A10C60 ethanol solution was 35 mg mL−1; the concentration of A10C60 in the MAI:A10C60 ethanol solution ranged from 2.5 to 20 mg mL−1.
Preparation of perovskite film
The CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared by a two-step solution deposition method. PbI2 was first spin-cast on the top of the pre-heated (70 °C) substrate from the warm (70 °C) PbI2 supernatant, followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min and then cooling to room temperature. Either a pure MAI layer or a MAI:A10C60 BHJ composite layer was then spin-coated on top of the PbI2 layer from the corresponding ethanol solutions, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 2 h to covert PbI2 and MAI to CH3NH3PbI3.
Characterization of perovskite film
Top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL-7401 field-emission scanning electron microscope. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Digital Instrument NanoScope NS3A system to observe the surface morphologies and thicknesses of various thin films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the thin films coated on polyethylene terephthalate substrates were obtained using a Bruker AXS Dimension D8 X-ray system. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60, CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM and CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM thin films were obtained on a Picoharp 300 instrument after pre-amplification by PAM 102.
Fabrication of pero-HSCs
Both PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs were fabricated on pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass. After the pre-cleaned ITO substrates had been treated with UV-ozone for 20 min under an ambient atmosphere, an approximately 40 nm thick film of PEDOT:PSS was spin-cast on top of the ITO substrates, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min under an ambient atmosphere. Either a CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 layer was then spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer from the corresponding solution by the described two-step deposition method. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 thin films were measured to be about 300 nm. An approximately 200 nm thick PC61BM ETL was then spin-cast from a chlorobenzene solution on to the top of either the CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 layer. Finally, an approximately 100 nm thick layer of Al was deposited thermally on top of the PC61BM ETL through a shadow mask under a vacuum with a base pressure of 6 × 10−6 mbar. The area of the device was measured to be 0.045 cm2.
Characterization of pero-HSCs
The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the pero-HSCs were obtained using a Keithley Model 2400 source measuring unit. A Newport Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) full-spectrum solar simulator was used as the light source. The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 and was calibrated using a monosilicon detector with a KG-5 visible color filter from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to reduce the spectral mismatch. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with the IPCE measurement set-up used at European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) for cells and mini-modules: a 300 W steady-state xenon lamp provides the source light; up to 64 filters (8–20 nm width, range 300–1200 nm) are available on four filter wheels to produce the monochromatic input, which is chopped at 75 Hz, superimposed on the bias light and measured via the usual lock-in technique (the bias light is necessary to examine the device close to the operating irradiance conditions). After collecting the IPCE data, the software integrated the data with the AM1.5G spectrum and gave the calculated JSC value, which was helpful for checking the accuracy of the measurement. To extract the Nyquist plots, impedance spectra were obtained using an HP 4194A impedance/gain-phase analyzer, in the dark or under 1 sun illumination, with an oscillating voltage of 10 mV and a frequency of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The pero-HSCs were held at their respective open-circuit potentials obtained from the (J–V) measurements while the impedance spectra were recorded.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the A10C60 thin film. The inset shows the molecular structure of A10C60, where the C60 head is regiospecifically functionalized by 10 carboxylic acid groups. Similar to PC61BM,29 A10C60 has a strong absorption at wavelengths < 500 nm, which implies that A10C60 contributes the photocurrent in the pero-HSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM/Al. Fig. 1b shows the CV curve of A10C60. The ELUMO and EHOMO values of A10C60 are estimated to be −4.1 and −6.1 eV, respectively, according to the empirical equations ELUMO = −e[Eonsetred + 4.4] and EHOMO = −e[Eonsetox + 4.4],30 where ELUMO is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, Eonsetred is the reduction potential, EHOMO is the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level and Eonsetox is the oxidization potential. Both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of A10C60 are nearly the same as those of PC61BM.29 These results indicate that the 10 carboxylic acid groups within C60 do not change the optical and electrical properties of C60, but significantly tune A10C60 to possess hydrophobicity.

Fig. 2a shows the device structures of the BHJ pero-HSCs: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM/Al. For comparison, Fig. 2b shows the device structure of the PHJ pero-HSCs: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Al. Fig. 2c shows the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of CH3NH3PbI3, A10C60 and PC61BM and the work functions of the ITO, PEDOT:PSS and Al electrodes. In both devices, PC61BM acts as the ETL. Based on the band alignment, there is no energy barrier to the electrons transported from A10C60 to PC61BM ETL, thus there is a higher electron extraction efficiency and, consequently, a higher JSC is expected from the BHJ pero-HSCs.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of the PHJ pero-HSCs and the BHJ pero-HSCs. The PHJ pero-HSCs have a JSC of 17.31 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, a FF of 77.2% and a corresponding PCE of 11.45%. The device performance parameters of PHJ pero-HSCs are comparable with previously reported values.31 However, the BHJ pero-HSCs have a JSC of 19.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V, a FF of 81.6% and a corresponding PCE of 13.97%. The PCE of the BHJ pero-HSCs is >22% higher than that of the PHJ pero-HSCs. The VOC values from both the PHJ pero-HSCs and the BHJ pero-HSCs are the same, which is in good agreement with the band alignment shown in Fig. 2c. However, enhanced values of the JSC and FF are seen for the BHJ pero-HSCs. The enhanced JSC value indicates that more electrons are extracted from the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite through the PC61BM ETL to the corresponding Al electrode. The significantly enlarged FF (81.6%) promisingly indicates that more balanced charge carriers are obtained from the BHJ pero-HSCs.32

The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) are estimated from the slopes of the J–V curves under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the RS and RSH values from both the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs. Compared with the PHJ pero-HSCs, the smaller RS value from the BHJ pero-HSCs originates from both the smaller contact resistance and the bulk resistance of the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite, which indicates that high photocurrents are anticipated to be generated from the BHJ pero-HSCs at low applied voltages; the larger RSH for the BHJ pero-HSCs indicates that short circuits or current leakages are minimized. As a result, high JSC values, a large FF and consequently high PCE values are observed for the BHJ pero-HSCs. These results are consistent with those observed from the J–V characteristics of the PHJ pero-HSCs and the BHJ pero-HSCs (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3b presents the IPCE spectra of both the PHJ pero-HSCs and the BHJ pero-HSCs. The IPCE spectra specify the ratio of the extracted electrons to the incident photons at a given wavelength. The PHJ pero-HSCs show a wide response from the visible to the near-infrared region, with more than about 60% of the IPCE in the range 500–800 nm, which indicates that the charge-transfer complexes are formed in the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films.33 The BHJ pero-HSCs exhibit a strong photo-response over the entire spectral region, with over 85% of the IPCE in the range 375–800 nm. In contrast with the PHJ pero-HSCs, an obvious enhanced IPCE from the BHJ pero-HSCs is seen in the range 350–500 nm, which probably originates from the contribution of A10C60 in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ active layer resulting from the strong absorption of A10C60 between 350 and 500 nm (Fig. 1a). The photocurrent densities estimated from the IPCE spectra are 16.21 and 18.83 mA cm−2 for the PHJ pero-HSCs and BHJ pero-HSCs, respectively. These values are consistent with those obtained from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 4 shows a histogram of the photovoltaic parameters for the BHJ pero-HSCs. Over 200 BHJ pero-HSCs devices were fabricated and characterized. Fig. 4 shows that the reproducibility of the JSC, FF, VOC and PCE were fairly high. The relative standard deviation was 1.3%, which is extremely low compared with previous reported data.34

A major issue in the pero-HSCs was the hysteresis of the photocurrent.35 It has been reported36,37 that the origin of this photocurrent hysteresis can be ascribed to traps, the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite materials and/or the electro-migration of ions in the pero-HSCs. To investigate the photocurrent hysteresis in the BHJ pero-HSCs, we measured the J–V characteristics using different scan directions [reverse scans (from a positive to a negative bias) and forward scans (from a negative to a positive bias)] and different scan rates (a high scan rate of 0.6 V s−1 and a low scan rate of 0.03 V s−1).37Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent hysteresis results for the BHJ pero-HSCs. Table 2 summarizes the device performance parameters of the BHJ pero-HSCs using different scan directions and rates. Larger PCEs were seen for the BHJ pero-HSCs under the reverse scans compared with those under the forward scans. At a high scan rate of 0.6 V s−1, the average PCE was 14.10%, higher than the 13.00% obtained at a low scan rate of 0.03 V s−1. These are similar to previously reported values.37 However, the differences in the PCEs of the BHJ pero-HSCs using either different scan directions or different scan rates were smaller than those reported from PHJ pero-HSCs,37,38 indicating that the photocurrent hysteresis in the BHJ pero-HSCs is weaker than that in the PHJ pero-HSCs.

To investigate the contribution of A10C60 in the BHJ pero-HSCs fabricated from the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite, the change in device performance of the BHJ pero-HSCs with the concentration (by weight) of A10C60 in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite was studied. Fig. 6a and b show the J–V characteristics and the IPCE spectra of the BHJ pero-HSCs. Fig. 6c shows the JSC, VOC, FF and PCE values plotted against the ratios of A10C60 to CH3NH3PbI3. Table 3 summarizes the photovoltaic performance parameters. As the ratio of A10C60 to CH3NH3PbI3 was increased from 1.6 to 12.8%, the VOC had a similar value of 0.88 ± 0.04 V, but the JSC value increased from 17.28 to 20.17 mA cm−2, an increment of about 17%, and the FF initially increased from 79.7 to 86.7% and then decreased to 72.3%. Consequently, the PCE initially increased from 11.75 to 13.97% and then decreased to 12.83%. The FF of 86.7% is the highest reported value for pero-HSCs.

The increased JSC values with increasing ratios of A10C60 to CH3NH3PbI3 probably originate from the strong absorption of A10C60, which contributes the photocurrent at wavelengths < 500 nm and more balanced electron–hole transport by blending more A10C60 with CH3NH3PbI3. In addition, the film morphology of CH3NH3PbI3A10C60 is modified by A10C60. A larger amount of A10C60 probably forms a larger domain, which is favorable for electron transport from the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite to the PC61BM ETL, resulting in an increased JSC value from the BHJ pero-HSCs containing large amounts of A10C60.
Based on the IPCE spectra, the JSC values of the pero-HSCs containing different concentrations of A10C60 were estimated by integrating the IPCE spectra from 375 to 800 nm. Table 3 summarizes the estimated JSC values. These estimated JSC values are consistent with those observed from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 6a).
XRD was used to study the differences between the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films to help understand the different photovoltaic performances of the PHJ pero-HSCs and the BHJ pero-HSCs. Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. The pristine A10C60 thin film was also investigated for comparison. Diffraction peaks were observed at 13.9, 28.5, 32.0, 40.6 and 43.6° for both the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. These peaks correspond to the (110), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes,39,40 respectively, which indicates that CH3NH3PbI3 was formed with an orthorhombic crystal structure in both pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. No representative peak for PbI2 was detected in either the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 or the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films, indicating that PbI2 and MAI react completely to generate CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystals. However, there were small peaks at 17 and 25° in the spectra of pristine A10C60 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films, although the intensities were relatively weak in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. These results indicate that a small-scale A10C60 crystallinity is formed in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. In addition, the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin film had a more intense diffraction peak at 32.0° than the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, indicating that the high crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film was formed by the introduction of A10C60 into the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite. In summary, the A10C60 in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite did not change the crystal structure of the CH3NH3PbI3, but influenced the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 on a small scale, indicating that these two materials were not miscible.

Both AFM images and top-view SEM images were obtained to study the morphological differences between pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. Fig. 8 shows the AFM topographic images of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. Both thin films show a relatively smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of about 10 nm. Such a flat surface suggests that either the CH3NH3PbI3 layer or the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite layer was completely covered by a PC61BM layer with a thickness of about 200 nm, which resulted in indirect contact between the active perovskite layer and the top cathode. A small Rq value indicates a smoother surface with less sharp traps or pinholes, which results in a high JSC value and a large FF.41Fig. 8c and d show the phase images of CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. A binary phase pattern was seen in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films (Fig. 8d), similar to that of the bi-continuous phase morphology observed for the BHJ composite in polymer solar cells.42 The BHJ interpenetrating network was essential for the efficient extraction of electrons from the BHJ composite because the enlarged interface areas between A10C60 and CH3NH3PbI3 facilitate more dissociation of the excitons. As a result, more free electrons were extracted from CH3NH3PbI3 into the n-type A10C60 as a result of the decreased travel length.43 Thus the electron extraction efficiency was improved, resulting in a balanced charge carrier extraction efficiency and an enlarged FF was observed for the BHJ pero-HSCs.

Fig. 9 compares the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films. Many large voids were seen in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, whereas fewer large voids were seen in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composites thin films. This indicates that the thin films formed by the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composites were more homogeneous than the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. Thus it was speculated that these large voids were filled by A10C60 and a new phase of A10C60, making the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films more compact and denser. The insets in Fig. 9c and d show high-resolution images of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films at a magnification of ×50000. It is clear that the crystal sizes in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin film (Fig. 9a) are almost identical and homogeneous, whereas the crystal sizes in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films (Fig. 9b) are inhomogeneous. The inhomogeneous crystal domains observed in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films are of two different sizes: the domain size identical to that shown in Fig. 9a is probably formed of CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystals, whereas the other type with different domain sizes is probably formed from A10C60 crystals.

Cross-sectional SEM images of (e) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM and (f) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM (some of the A10C60 domains inside CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 can be observed in the region marked by broken lines). 

Fig. 9e and f show the cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM devices, respectively. The thickness of each layer was consistent with that in the final devices. Fig. 9e shows the PHJ structure of CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM, where the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 layer is sandwiched between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the PC61BM ETL. In contrast, Fig. 9f shows the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 composite layer sandwiched between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the PC61BM ETL. The A10C60 domains could be clearly seen in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 composite layer. This observation confirms that A10C60 was mixed with CH3NH3PbI3 to form the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite layer.
To further understand the underlying device performance of both the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs, the PL of the CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM, CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 and (CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60)/PC61BM thin films was investigated. Fig. 10a shows the PL spectra of these thin films. A more striking PL quenching effect was seen with the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films than with the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, which indicates that efficient electron extraction took place in the H3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite thin films rather in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. The enlarged PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM and CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60/PC61BM thin films in Fig. 10a (inset) clearly demonstrate that more PL quenching took place in the (CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60)/PC61BM thin films than in the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin films. These results indicate that more efficient electron extraction occurred in the (CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60)/PC61BM thin films than in the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin films. Therefore the PL spectra further confirm that the high electron extraction efficiency originated from the enlarged interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 and A10C60 in the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite.

(b) Nyquist plots of PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs measured in the dark and at an applied voltage close to the open-circuit voltage of the pero-HSCs. (c) Recombination resistance resulting from impedance spectrometry measurements fitted for different applied biases at 1 sun illumination. 
To investigate the electrical properties of the interfaces, impedance spectrometry was used to study the internal series resistance (RS) of both the BHJ pero-HSCs and the PHJ pero-HSCs. The impedance spectrometry analysis enabled us to monitor the detailed electrical properties of the interfaces that could not be determined by the direct current measurements. The RS consists of the sheet resistance (RSHEET) of the electrodes, the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at the interfaces between the electrode and the carrier selective layer and between the carrier selective layer and the internal BHJ active layer.44 The main difference between the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs is the RCT at the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and A10C60. Fig. 10b shows the Nyquist plots of both the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs in the dark at an applied voltage close to the VOC of the pero-HSCs. From the plots, RCT values of 0.85 and 0.66 kΩ were obtained for the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs, respectively. In the PHJ pero-HSCs, a large RCT value indicated that the large charge-transfer resistance resulted from the inferior contact at the interface with the PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3. For the BHJ pero-HSCs, a small RCT was obtained as a result of the larger interfacial area between CH3NH3PbI3 and A10C60. Therefore a higher PCE is expected from the BHJ pero-HSCs than from the PHJ pero-HSCs.

Fig. 10c shows the recombination resistance as a function of the applied bias in the relevant voltage range. The recombination processes were associated with the feature observed in the low-frequency region of the Nyquist plot of the pero-HSCs. The recombination rate was inversely proportional to the recombination resistance. In this study, the major difference in the device structure was the introduction of A10C60 into CH3NH3PbI3 to form the CH3NH3PbI3:A10C60 BHJ composite. The recombination resistance was significantly enhanced at a low applied bias, which was in good agreement with the large FF observed for the BHJ pero-PSCs.45 On the other hand, at a high applied bias, close to the VOC, both the PHJ and BHJ pero-HSCs had a similar recombination resistance, indicating a similar VOC for both cells.46 These observations were consistent with those of the J–V characteristics (Fig. 3a).
Conclusions
BHJ pero-HSCs were fabricated to address the fundamental limitation of the unbalanced electron–hole diffusion length in pero-HSCs. High-efficiency BHJ pero-HSCs were fabricated by solution-processing the BHJ composite from an ethanol solution consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and A10C60 rather than from a pristine CH3NH3PbI3 ethanol solution. XRD, AFM, TEM, PL and impedance spectrometry studies showed that the high efficiency of the BHJ pero-HSCs originated from the balanced charge carrier extraction efficiency and enlarged interfacial area between the CH3NH3PbI3 and A10C60. The fabrication of these BHJ pero-HSCs offers an efficient and simple way to increase the efficiency of pero-HSCs.

Broader context
Efficiently and economically harnessing solar energy via photovoltaic (PV) devices is one of the most promising solutions to the global energy crisis. However, over 80% of the available PVs are silicon-based and/or inorganic thin-film solar cells, which are expensive and require critical processing techniques. Organic PV cells have been developed to lower the costs, but their efficiency still lags behind their inorganic counterparts. Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have shown great potential as novel, highly efficient and low-cost PV devices. However, the fundamental limitation of unbalanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite materials requires a mesoporous structure and/or a highly conductive electron transfer layer to balance the charge extraction efficiencies, which complicates device processing. We report here a simple method of fabricating bulk heterojunction (BHJ) perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) from a BHJ composite consisting of perovskite materials blended with water-/alcohol-soluble fullerene derivatives to balance the charge extraction efficiencies. A greater than 22% enhanced efficiency was observed from these BHJ pero-HSCs compared with planar heterojunction pero-HSCs. This fabrication method for BHJ pero-HSCs offers an efficient and simple way to increase the efficiency of pero-HSCs.
