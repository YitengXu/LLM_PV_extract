    , Accepted 16th March 2023First published on 18th March 2023AbstractLead halide perovskites have been widely studied in the fields of photovoltaics and optoelectronics for over a decade. The toxicity of lead poses a big challenge to the potential applications of the materials. In recent years, lead-free halide perovskites have received significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and environment-friendly character. Tin halide perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for lead-free optoelectronic materials. It is of fundamental importance to understand the surface properties of tin halide perovskites that remain largely unknown. Using the density functional theory (DFT) method, we explore the surface energy and surface stability of low-index surfaces of cubic CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), i.e., (100), (110), and (111) surfaces. We calculate the stability phase diagrams of these surfaces and find that the (100) surface is more stable than the (110) and (111) surfaces. Interestingly, Br2-terminated (110) and CsBr3-terminated (111) polar surfaces are relatively more stable in CsSnBr3 than those in CsPbBr3 due to a higher level of valence band maximum and thus lesser energy cost in removing electrons to compensate for the polarity of the former. We calculate the surface energies of CsSnX3 surfaces that are difficult to access from experiments. The surface energies are very low in comparison with that of oxide perovskites. The origin of this lies in the relatively low binding strength of halide perovskites because of the soft nature of their structures. Furthermore, the connection between exfoliation energy and the cleavage energy in CsSnX3 is discussed.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskites have received extensive attention due to their low preparation cost and excellent photovoltaic properties, making them the most promising solar cell materials.1 Halide perovskites show excellent semiconducting properties, such as adjustable band gaps, high light absorption, and long carrier diffusion length.2–6 Due to these properties, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead halide perovskite-based thin-film solar cells currently reaches up to the highest value of 25.7%.7 However, large-scale commercial applications of perovskite solar cells still face certain challenges, such as the toxicity of lead (Pb) and poor stability.8 Pb is a heavy metal element that is harmful to the environment and human health. Therefore, the exploration of lead-free materials with good photovoltaic properties has attracted considerable attention.9,10
Tin (Sn) and lead (Pb) belong to the same group of the periodic table and have similar valence electron configurations. The most notable feature of Sn is its lower toxicity.11 Replacing Pb with Sn is a hot topic in lead-free perovskite solar cell research.12 Sn-perovskites have smaller band gaps, which are closer to the ideal band gap for the highest Shockley–Queasier theoretical efficiency13 in comparison with the corresponding Pb-perovskites. The degradation product of Sn-perovskites exposed to ambient air is suggested to be environment-friendly SnO2.14,15 The PCE of Sn-perovskite solar cells has been raised up to 14.81%.10,16–18 However, the development of Sn-perovskite-based solar cells also encounters bottlenecks. Firstly, the conversion efficiency, at present, is far from the theoretical efficiency and is also much lower than that of Pb-perovskites.19,20 Secondly, Sn (II) is easily oxidized to Sn (VI), which results in the degradation of Sn-perovskites.21 The oxidation and the degradation of Sn-perovskites generally initiate at the surface.15,22 Therefore, understanding the surface properties of Sn-perovskites is extremely important, especially thermodynamic stability and surface energy.
Previous studies mainly focus on the interaction between adsorbates (e.g., O2, H2O, and ligands) and Sn-perovskite surfaces.23–28 The works involved in the surface energy and surface stability of pristine surfaces of all-inorganic Sn-perovskites are very limited.29–32 Termination-dependent stability was investigated for the (001) surfaces of orthorhombic CsSnI3.29,31 Chu et al. calculated the surface energies of CsSnCl3 (100), (110), and (111) surfaces using density functional theory and found that SnCl2-terminated (100) surface possesses the lowest surface energy.32 Similarly, the surface energies of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) have been explored using the first-principles method in previous studies.33,34
Up to now, there has been a lack of systematic understanding of the surface energy and surface stability of all-inorganic Sn-perovskites. For example, the relative stability of (100) surfaces with respect to (110) and (111) surfaces (especially the cases whose polarity is compensated by changing surface composition) of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) in cubic phase remain largely unsolved. Besides, it is unclear how surface stability depends on the chemical nature of halide and the type of surface termination. Furthermore, the values of surface energies and cleavage energies for these compounds are deficient since it is generally difficult to measure these quantities of solids from experiments. In this work, taking all-inorganic CsSnX3 as typical examples, we investigate the surface energy and surface stability of Sn-perovskites via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We calculate the surface energies, cleavage energies, and phase diagrams of low-index surfaces (i.e., (100), (110), and (111)) for cubic CsSnX3. We then analyze and discuss the applications of the results. Our results provide general insights into understanding the stability of Sn-perovskite surfaces.
2. Computational methods
All calculations are carried out using density functional theory (DFT) and the projector augmented wave (PAW) methods within the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).35–38 PBEsol functional within generalized gradient approximation is used for geometry optimizations and total energy calculations.39 This functional was designed to provide a more accurate description of the equilibrium properties of solids and surfaces. A kinetic energy cutoff of 350 eV is used for plane-wave expansion. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh40 of 8 × 8 × 8 is used for cubic perovskite unit cells, and scaled meshes are used for slabs. Test calculations demonstrate that the choices of these two parameters can ensure the convergence of surface energies (Table S2, ESI†). The convergence threshold of total energy is set at 10−5 eV. The convergence criteria of forces in structure relaxation are 0.01 eV Å−1. Spin-orbital coupling (SOC) produces a negligible effect on the formation energies of CsX, SnX2, and CsSnX3 bulk systems, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). We also examine the influence of SOC on the phase diagram (Fig. S1, ESI†) and surface energies of CsSnBr3 (Table S3, ESI†) and find that the effect of SOC on these properties is negligible. Thus, SOC is ignored in the following calculations.
Structure models of surfaces are built from cubic perovskites. Calculated lattice constants of cubic CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3 are 5.511, 5.756, and 6.127 Å, respectively. These theoretical values agree well with the experimental values (experimental lattice constants of cubic CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3 are 5.56, 5.804, and 6.219 Å, respectively).41–43 We consider the low-index surfaces of perovskites, i.e., (100), (110), and (111) surfaces, which are the most commonly emerged surfaces for halide perovskites. Using CsSnBr3 as an example, the atomic models of these surfaces are presented in Fig. 1. Along the [100] direction, CsSnX3 consists of alternating CsX and SnX2 layers (Fig. 1b), which produces two terminations for (100) surfaces, (100)-CsX and (100)-SnX2. Along the [110] direction, CsSnX3 displays a stacking order of alternating CsSnX and X2 charged layers with +2/−2 charges under the assumption of formal charge states (Cs+, Sn2+, and X−) (Fig. 1c and d). This order leads to two ideal terminations for (110) surfaces, (110)-CsSnX and (110)-X2. Notably, these polar surfaces are unstable due to the increased potential energy with the increasing number of layers. The divergence of potential can be avoided by changing the surface charges to half of the bulk value (i.e., +1 or −1 for (110) polar surfaces).44 This can be done via approaches like surface charge transfer and surface stoichiometry change, as has been demonstrated in CsPbBr3.33 For CsPbBr3, polarity-compensated (110) surfaces with Cs and PbBr terminations are more stable than the ideal terminations.33 Apart from polar surfaces, we also consider polarity-compensated (110) surfaces for CsSnX3, (110)-SnX, and (110)-Cs. These two terminations possess half charge value of ideal layers (+2) and are thus expected to compensate for the polarity. Similarly, a stacking order of alternating Sn and CsX3 charged layers along the [111] direction leads to polar surfaces, (111)-Sn and (111)-CsX3 (Fig. 1e). Another termination with Br adsorbed on (111)-Sn is also considered due to its compensated polarity (marked as (111)-Br (Fig. 1f)). Symmetric slabs with two equivalent terminations are used, which can help avoid spurious dipole interaction between periodic surfaces. Three layers in the middle of the slabs are fixed to mimic the bulk, while other layers are relaxed to reach their equilibrium states. The vacuum layers are thicker than 15 Å along the surface normal.

The cleaving surfaces are marked in the bulk structural model. 
We analyze the surface energies (Esurf) of CsSnX3 by considering their dependence on the chemical potentials of elements. The Esurf is calculated according to the following equation:45 (1)where Exslab (eV) is the total energy of slab X from the DFT calculation. NCs, NSn and NX are the number of atoms (Cs, Sn, and X) in the slab; μCs, μCs and μX are their chemical potentials; S is the area of the symmetrical surface. This method has been utilized in calculating the surface energies of cubic SrTiO3 and CsPbBr3 surfaces.33,44 For the convenience of discussion, we use relative chemical potential Δμi: Δμi = μi − Ei(2)where Ei (eV per atom) is the total energy of the element phase. Allowed ranges of chemical potentials can be obtained by avoiding the formation of element substances (Cs, Pb, and X2) and binaries (CsX and SnX2). The formation energies (Ef) of binaries (CsX/SnX2) and perovskites CsSnX3 with respect to element substances (Cs, Sn, and X2) are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
Based on eqn (1) and (2), the Esurf can be written as a function of ΔμCs and ΔμX: (3)where  and Ebulk is the total energy of CsSnX3 bulk. The boundaries of surface phase diagrams are determined from the condition of equal surface energies for two surfaces. With all possible terminations of (100), (110), and (111) surfaces considered, the most stable termination with the lowest surface energy is presented in phase diagrams (Fig. 2). We also calculate Esurf as a function of ΔμX by fixing the value of ΔμCs at typical conditions (a detailed discussion about the choice of conditions in ESI†) and present the results in Fig. 3. The cleavage energy (Ecl) describes the energy cost of cleaving a bulk into two surfaces. This quantity can be calculated from the total energies of complementary symmetric unrelaxed slabs, e.g., (100)-CsBr and (100)-SnBr2 for (100) surfaces. Taking (100)-CsBr and (100)-SnBr2 surfaces as an example, the Ecl can be calculated as follows:46,47 (4)where Nbulk is the total number of unit cells of CsSnX3 in two slabs.

3. Results
Surface phase diagrams show the relative stability of different terminations of each surface with varied chemical potential conditions. Fig. 2 displays the phase diagrams of the low-index surfaces of CsSnX3. Taking CsSnBr3 as a typical example, we discuss the relative stability of possible terminations of low-index surfaces. Fig. 2d–f show the phase diagrams of (100), (110), and (111) surfaces of CsSnBr3, respectively. For (100) surfaces, (100)-CsBr surface is more stable than (100)-SnBr2 case at Cs-rich condition (higher ΔμCs) (yellow area of Fig. 2d). (100)-SnBr2 surface is the ground state under the Cs-poor condition (orange area). At the condition of thermodynamically stable CsSnBr3 bulk (stable area enclosed by two red lines), CsBr-termination is the ground state for a large part of the stable area, while a very small part of the area is occupied by SnBr2-termination. This suggests that CsBr-termination should be the dominant surface to emerge in the synthesized CsSnBr3 samples, while there is a possibility for SnBr2-termination to emerge.
Since (110)-CsSnBr and (110)-Br2 are polar surfaces, these two surfaces may be unstable. This can be seen from Fig. 2e, where (110)-CsSnBr is not a stable termination as it does not appear in the phase diagram. In contrast, polarity-compensated (110)-Cs and (110)-SnBr surfaces show higher stability. (110)-SnBr surface is stable under the condition of Cs-poor, while (110)-Cs surface is in the ground state under the condition of Cs-rich. Unexpectedly, the (110)-Br2 polar surface shows considerable stability, indicating that this surface dominates the allowed chemical potential region of stable CsSnBr3 bulk. Under the condition of Br-poor, (110)-Cs and (110)-SnBr surfaces are more stable. Similar to the case of the (110) surface, the (111) surface also exhibits polarity. (111)-Sn and (111)-CsBr3 are polar surfaces and thus should be less stable in comparison with compensated (111)-Br surface. Interestingly, (111)-CsBr3 surface is the ground state at Br-rich condition (Fig. 2f). At the Br-poor condition, compensated (111)-Br surface is the most stable configuration.
We then illustrate the influence of halide on the surface phase diagram. Fig. 2a–c and g–i show the phase diagrams of CsSnCl3 and CsSnI3, respectively. It is seen that the relative stability of the low-index surfaces of these two compounds is similar to that of CsSnBr3. The main difference among these three materials occurs at (100) and (110) surfaces. For (100) surfaces, there is a clear trend that the stability of (100)-CsX increases, while that of (100)-SnX2 decreases as X goes from Cl to Br to I. This is indicated by the increased area occupied by (100)-CsX (yellow) at the condition of stable bulk. As aforementioned, in the case of CsSnBr3, (100)-CsBr dominates the region of stable bulk, while (100)-SnBr2 makes a minor contribution. However, (100)-SnCl2 and (100)-CsCl surfaces show comparable stability in the condition of stable CsSnCl3 bulk. Moreover, CsI-termination becomes the sole stable configuration under the condition of stable CsSnI3. For (110) surfaces, the portion of the stable bulk region occupied by (110)-Cs increases as the atomic number of X becomes larger, while (110)-SnX displays an inverse trend. These results indicate that the nature of X affects the surface stability of CsSnX3 surfaces.
To obtain a quantitative comparison among three compounds, we calculate the cleavage energies of CsSnX3, as shown in Table 1. Cleavage energy is the energy cost of cleaving bulk CsSnX3 into two complementary surfaces. It is seen that the Ecl values of non-polar surfaces are much lower than those of polar surfaces regardless of the X element. For example, the Ecl of non-polar (110) surface is about half of the value of the polar (110) surface. Moreover, relatively low values of the Ecl of non-polar (110) surfaces suggest that changing the surface composition is an effective polarity-compensated scheme, as in the case of (110)-Cs and (110)-SnX surfaces. Notably, for all surfaces, their cleavage energies display a decreasing trend, with X changing from Cl to Br to I. This trend is in accordance with the trend of the formation energies of CsSnX3 (7.46, 6.80, and 4.67 eV for CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3, respectively). This can be understood in that cleavage energy is closely related to the cohesive strength of compounds. It is worth noting that the cleavage energies of (100) surfaces are much lower than those of (110) and (111) surfaces, suggesting higher stability of (100) surfaces.

To illustrate the relative stability of (100), (110), and (111) surfaces more clearly, we calculate the Esurf as a function of ΔμX with all terminations of these surfaces considered (Fig. 3). The Esurf is calculated by fixing the value of ΔμCs at typical conditions (ESI†). Overall, the Esurf of CsX, Cs, X2, and CsX3-surfaces show a downward trend with an increase in ΔμX, while the others (SnX2, SnX, CsSnX, X, and Sn-terminations) have an opposite trend. Thus, CsX, Cs, X2, and CsX3-surfaces possess enhanced stability with increasing ΔμX. At the condition of stable CsSnX3 bulk (red areas), (100) surfaces are the most stable regardless of the nature of the halide. However, the stability of a specific termination of (100) surface, CsX or SnX2, depends on the halide. The X-dependent trend, i.e., the stability of (100)-CsX enhances and that of (100)-SnX2 decreases as X goes from Cl to Br to I, is consistent with the conclusion from Fig. 2a, d, and g. Besides, unlike CsSnCl3 and CsSnBr3, at the condition of I-rich, (111)-CsI3 is not the ground state surface for CsSnI3. In this case, (110)-Cs surface is more stable.
To summarize, based on Table 1 and Fig. 3, the stability of (100) surfaces is the best regardless of the chemical nature of X at stable bulk conditions. Nevertheless, the relative stability of (100)-CsX with respect to (100)-SnX2 depends on X. The probability of obtaining (100)-CsX termination becomes larger from Cl to Br to I. In order to obtain deeper insight into the absolute values of the Esurf of (100) surfaces, we calculate the Esurf of these three species for (100) surfaces, as listed in Table 2. The Esurf of (100)-CsX are extremely low, ranging from 0.043 to 0.069 J m−2 at CsX-rich condition. At SnX2-rich conditions, (100)-SnX2 surfaces generally possess higher surface energies in the range of (0.055, 0.130) J m−2. The surface energy of (100)-SnCl2 at the SnCl2-rich condition is lower than that of (100)-CsCl at the CsCl-rich condition, which is consistent with a previous study.32 The surface energies of both CsI- and PbI2-surfaces for CsSnI3 at the CsX-rich condition are very close to the values reported in a previous study.29 Higher stability of CsX-termination for CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 than SnX2-termination is in good accordance with previous works.29,30 Higher stability of CsX-termination for Br and I-cases originates from higher ionicity and stronger relaxation effect of the CsX surface layer in comparison with SnX2 layers.33

Notably, the surface energies of CsSnX3 (100) surfaces are very low compared to the Esurf of oxide perovskites. This can be figured out from a comparison of the Esurf values between CsSnX3 and SrTiO3, a model material of oxide perovskites. Taking the average of the Esurf of two (100) terminations, the values are calculated to be 0.102, 0.110, and 0.099 J m−2 for CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3, respectively, independent of chemical potentials. They are about one magnitude smaller than the Esurf of SrTiO3 (100) surfaces with a value of 1.14 J m−2.48 Low surface energy of halide perovskites is closely related to the soft nature of the structures. It is well-known that halide perovskites show relatively low stability, even all-inorganic type, in comparison with oxide perovskites. This can be evaluated from the decomposed energies (ΔHf) of perovskites with respect to their binary phases CsX and SnI2 (SrO and TiO2 for SrTiO3). The ΔHf values of CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3 are 0.31, 0.25, and 0.12 eV per chemical formula unit, respectively. These values are much lower than the ΔHf of SrTiO3 with the value of about 1.3 eV,48 which is similar to the distinction in surface energies between two types of perovskites. A close correlation between surface energy and the binding strength of element metals has been clarified in previous studies. It is well-accepted that surface energy is approximately proportional to the bulk cohesive energy of a metal (i.e., sublimation energy). This approximation was utilized in calculating the surface energies from the cohesive energies of metals.49,50
4. Discussion
We first discuss the effect of Sn on surface stability by comparing it with the surface phase diagrams of CsPbBr3 in our previous work.33 The main difference is that (110)-Br2 and (111)-CsBr3 polar surfaces show higher stability in CsSnBr3. This can be figured out by making a comparison of the phase diagrams of (110) and (111) surfaces between CsSnBr3 and CsPbBr3. At the condition of stable bulk, the regions of (110)-Br2 surface and (111)-CsBr3 are significantly larger in CsSnBr3 than that in CsPbBr3. The origin of the difference can be attributed to the fact that the valence band maximum (VBM) of CsSnX3 is higher than that of CsPbX3 for a specific X. It is well-known that the VBM of CsMX3 (M = Sn, Pb) is contributed by antibonding interaction from X-p and M-s orbitals. The s–p antibonding hybridization is stronger in CsSnX3 than that in Pb-counterpart as the energy level of Sn 5s is higher than that of Pb 6s51 and closer to that of X p. Stronger antibonding interaction makes the VBM of CsSnX3 higher than that of CsPbX3. This trend has been verified in previous theoretical and experimental works. Lang and co-authors calculated the natural band offset among CsSnX3 and CsPbX3 (X = Cl, B, I) in the cubic phase by using both PBE and GW methods.52 They found that the VBM of CsMX3 goes down as M varies from Sn to Pb. This energy order of VBM for CsMX3 was also confirmed by a systematic ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) study.53
(110)-Br2 and (111)-CsBr3 surfaces exhibit polar character due to an unbalanced charge (−2e per unit cell area) at the surface. According to the electrostatic principle, these two surfaces can be stable by removing one electron from the surface region. The removed electron is from the electronic states near the VBM, leaving VBM unoccupied.33 The higher the level of VBM, the less energy cost in removing electrons and thus more stable for this surface. Therefore, the electron-deficient polar surfaces like (110)-Br2 and (111)-CsBr3 are more stable in CsSnBr3 than CsPbBr3 due to the higher VBM energy of the former.
Besides, higher stability is also reflected in the lower cleavage energy of CsSnBr3 polar surfaces. Using Br-containing compounds as example, the relative stability of CsSnX3 and CsPbX3 surfaces can be quantitatively evaluated by comparing the difference in their cleavage energies (list in Table S4 of ESI†). Notably, the Ecl of polar surfaces of CsSnBr3 are significantly lower than those of the Pb case for (110) and (111) cases, while the Ecl values of nonpolar surfaces are close for the two compounds. The energy cost in cleaving the bulk into polar surfaces is lower in CsSnBr3 than in CsPbBr3, which is consistent with the results from the phase diagrams.
We now discuss the connection of our results to experiments. Based on our calculations, the surface energies of (100) surfaces are lower than those of (110) surfaces. According to the principle of Wulff construction, the surface with lower surface energy tends to expose a larger portion of surface area, as the equilibrium crystal shapes of materials are determined from the minimization of surface energy.54 Our theoretical results are in accordance with previous experimental findings. Chen et al. have fabricated CsSnX3 (X = Br, I) nanowires using the vapor-phase growth method on mica substrate.55 They found that these wires show a triangular cross-section and grow along the [001] direction of the cubic phase. Two side exposed facets of nanowires are (100) planes, while the bottom facet in contact with the mica substrate is the (110) plane of the cubic phase. Thus, (100) surfaces are more favorable for exposure as side walls. To avoid the exposure of the (110) surface, the growth of this facet upon substrate may be more favorable in energy.
The surface energies of Sn-perovskites are closely linked to the chemical potential of each constituent in the compounds. Fine-tuning the condition of chemical potential for each element is essential to obtain the target facet. This may not be realized by using SnX2 as a reactant as it contains both tin and halide in a fixed ratio of 1:2. In a previous study, Kang et al. used stannous oxalate and ammonium halides as Sn and halide sources in synthesizing CsSnX3 NCs.56 Based on combined theoretical and experimental investigations, Liu et al. proposed another approach to tune the molar ratio of Cs, Sn, and X in a wide range by properly selecting reactant precursors.57 Based on our results and these findings, the equilibrium crystals of CsSnX3 with target surfaces may be synthesized via tuning the molar ratio of Cs, Sn, and X reactant precursors. For example, to obtain the (100)-CsCl surface, the CsCl-rich condition is favorable and thus Cs and Cl precursors should be chosen over the stoichiometric ratio of CsSnCl3. If the (100)-CsBr surface is the target, a similar reaction condition can be applied in synthesizing CsSnBr3.
We finally discuss the possible implications of our results in obtaining two-dimensional (2D) perovskites. There is a close connection between the cleavage energy of surfaces and the exfoliation energy of 2D materials. The cleavage energy is the energy needed to cut a bulk material into two parts with surfaces. Similarly, the exfoliation energy is the energy cost of peeling off an ultra-thin layer in atomic thickness from the surface of bulk material.58 When the ultra-thin layer becomes thick, the exfoliation energy converges with the cleavage energy. The exfoliation energy is not very sensitive to the thickness of the ultra-thin layer since it is generally a short-range quantity that is mainly determined by the local bonds at the surfaces. Thus, the exfoliation energy may be close to the cleavage energy, even if the ultra-thin layer is a monolayer. We calculated the monolayer exfoliation energy of 2D CsSnX3 (i.e., the energy required in peeling off one-unit-cell CsSnX3 from CsSnX3 (100) surface) using the slab method (calculation method in ESI† and Fig. S2). Here, 2D perovskites are the ultra-thin slices of the halide perovskite bulk (3D) through (100) plane. The monolayer exfoliation energies calculated from unrelaxed slabs are 0.330, 0.307, and 0.281 J m−2 for CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3, respectively. These values account for a large part of cleavage energies, which are 0.380, 0.355, and 0.312 J m−2 for CsSnCl3, CsSnBr3, and CsSnI3, respectively. The difference between monolayer exfoliation energy and cleavage energy accounts for 15% of monolayer exfoliation energy for CsSnCl3. The corresponding quantities are 16% for CsSnBr3 and 11% for CsSnI3. In a previous study, Jung et al. found that the difference between monolayer exfoliation energy and the cleavage energy is small for some common van der Waals (vdW) 2D materials.58 The differences are 14%, 12%, 6.7%, and 5.8% of the monolayer exfoliation energies for h-BN, graphene, MoS2, and phosphorene, respectively.58 Our results reveal the closeness of monolayer exfoliation energy to the cleavage energy in CsSnX3 and also some similarity of the exfoliation energy of 2D CsSnX3 to vdW 2D materials.
The lower the exfoliation energy for a 2D material, the easier it is to peel off from the bulk surface, implying the ease of possibly fabricating it in experiments. The monolayer exfoliation energies (0.281–0.330 J m−2) of CsSnX3 (100) surfaces are in the range of calculated exfoliation energies (0.29–0.51 J m−2) for common vdW-type 2D materials (MoS2, phosphorene, graphene, and h-BN),58 implying that 2D CsSnX3 may be exfoliated from the corresponding bulk. Low exfoliation energies of 2D CsSnX3 and their closeness to those of vdW 2D materials are consistent with the low binding strength of halide perovskites. This type of 2D perovskite has been fabricated by experiments in two model materials of halide perovskites, MAPbI3 and CsPbBr3. Liu et al. synthesized 2D MAPbI3 with a thickness down to one unit cell limit.59 In another study, Yu et al. reported the fabrication of two-dimensional CsPbBr3 with the thickness of two-unit cells.60 As far as we know, there are no experimental reports on this type of 2D CsSnX3 up to now. Our theoretical results thus provide some guidance for synthesizing 2D CsSnX3 in experiments.
5. Conclusion
We utilized the first-principles methods to investigate the surface energy and surface stability of cubic CsSnX3. We found that no matter which element X (Cl or Br or I) is, the non-polar (100) surface is more stable than the (110) and (111) surfaces. With X changing from Cl to Br to I, the stability of CsX termination is enhanced in comparison with SnX2 termination. This originates from higher ionicity and stronger relaxation effect of the CsX surface layer compared with that of SnX2 layers. Interestingly, Br2-terminated (110) and CsBr3-terminated (111) polar surfaces are relatively more stable in CsSnBr3 than those in CsPbBr3 due to a higher level of VBM and thus less energy cost in removing an electron to compensate for the polarity. We obtain the surface energies of CsSnX3 surfaces, which are difficult to be accessed from experiments. The surface energies are very low compared to that of oxide perovskites because of the relatively low binding strength of halide perovskites. The termination-dependent absolute values of surface energies should be useful in understanding the nucleation, growth, and phase stability of Sn-perovskites. Furthermore, we demonstrate the closeness of monolayer exfoliation energy to the cleavage energy in CsSnX3 and reveal the weak binding strength between perovskite layers, which implies the ease of possibly fabricating 2D CsSnX3 in experiments. Our results provide an overall picture of the stability of low-index surfaces of CsSnX3.
