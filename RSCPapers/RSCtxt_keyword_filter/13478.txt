    , Accepted 8th April 2016First published on 12th April 2016AbstractThe interaction of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite and selective contacts is crucial to get efficient, stable and hysteresis-free perovskite-based solar cells. In this report, we analyze the vibrational properties of methylammonium lead halide perovskites deposited on different substrates by infrared absorption (IR) measurements (4000–500 cm−1). The materials employed as substrates are not only characterized by different chemical natures (TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3), but also by different morphologies. For all of them, we have investigated the influence of these substrate properties on perovskite formation and its degradation by humidity. The effect of selective-hole contact (Spiro-OmeTad and P3HT) layers on the degradation rate by moisture has also been studied. Our IR results reveal the existence of a strong interaction between perovskite and all ZnO materials considered, evidenced by a shift of the peaks related to the N–H vibrational modes. The interaction even induces a morphological change in ZnO nanoparticles after perovskite deposition, pointing to an acid–base reaction that takes place through the NH3+ groups of the methylammonium cation. Our IR and X-ray diffraction results also indicate that this specific interaction favors perovskite decomposition and PbI2 formation for ZnO/perovskite films subjected to humid conditions. Although no interaction is observed for TiO2, Al2O3, and the hole selective contact, the morphology and chemical nature of both contacts appear to play an important role in the rate of degradation upon exposure to moisture.
1. Introduction
The origin of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells.1,2 When CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) was for the first time used as a sensitizer of TiO2, a power conversion efficiency of 3.5% was achieved in combination with a liquid electrolyte.3 The power conversion efficiency was increased to 6.5% after optimization of the titania surface, perovskite processing and the concentration of liquid electrolytes.4 Nevertheless, there was a significant improvement in efficiency and stability when MAPbI3 was combined with solid organic hole-selective materials (HSMs)5 in a thin film6,7 or mesoporous8–10 configuration. In particular, certified power conversion efficiencies higher than 20% have recently been reported.11,12
Most state-of-the-art PSCs employ a compact and mesoporous TiO2 layer to provide a porous substrate on which the perovskite is deposited. Additionally, on top of that, a hole-selective layer is also deposited. In these photovoltaic devices, the charge extraction is carried out, thanks to these selective contacts: TiO2 (n-contact layer) and HSM (p-contact layer). Therefore, the electrons are transferred to TiO2, a wide bandgap semiconductor metal oxide, whereas holes are collected by the HSM. Thus, the TiO2 layer not only acts as a scaffold of the perovskite material, but also extracts the photogenerated electrons. Nevertheless, in 2013 Snaith et al.6 demonstrated that the perovskite material in contact with an insulating mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold was also capable of producing efficiencies exceeding 12%. In addition, special attention has recently been paid to ZnO as an n-contact layer. This oxide draws interest due to its capability to fabricate flexible devices and reduce the production costs because of the wide variety of techniques and the lower temperature processing that are required to deposit this material.13–21 Additionally, organic n-type materials such as fullerenes can also be used as electron selective contacts.22,23
The most extended perovskite materials used in photovoltaic applications are hybrid organic–inorganic compounds with a 3D crystal structure of general chemical formula ABX3 (A = organic cation, B = Pb and X = halide). Methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA) and formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+, FA) are the most common organic cations, whereas I, Cl and Br are the halides. The chemical nature of this combination of species not only characterizes the structural properties, but also the optoelectronic behavior,24,25 such as the hysteresis effects26–29 or the determination of the bandgap.25,30 For instance, bandgaps of 1.57 and 1.48 eV were found for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively.30
Bearing in mind that the interaction between both organic and inorganic components and the chemical nature of the perovskite are governed by a variety of chemical bonds, including hydrogen bonds, the study of the vibrational modes of these perovskite materials can provide valuable clues to understand their optoelectronic properties, photovoltaic behavior and stability. Several studies on the vibrational properties of perovskite materials have been carried out by Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Quarti et al.31 combined computational and experimental data to explain the basis of Raman spectra of MAPbI3. Gottesman et al.32 observed extremely slow changes in Raman spectra under illumination conditions with respect to darkness, which were associated with structural changes. Ledinsky et al.33 studied the relationship between the structural changes of perovskite and its degradation. These authors also discussed their Raman spectra based on the ratio of iodine-to-bromine atoms in perovskite layers. Onoda-Yamamuro et al.34 showed the variation of the IR spectra of hybrid halide perovskites at different temperatures. Mosconi et al.35 investigated the influence of temperature on IR spectra of MAPbI3 to study the dynamics of MA in these hybrid perovskites. Pérez-Osorio et al.36 reported the vibrational properties of MAPbI3 using Raman and IR data and combining theoretical and experimental data. Glaser et al.37 analyzed the shifts of the peaks associated with the NH3+ stretching vibrations when the halide atoms in the hybrid halide perovskites are changed. Müller et al.38 proposed a molecular model that explains the interaction of water molecules and MA using IR spectroscopy performed under different ambient conditions. Very recently, Bakulin et al. resolved in time the reorientation of MAI on the MAPbI3 lattice using 2-dimensional IR.39
To date, all previous reports have studied the vibrational properties of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites focusing on the interaction between the organic cations and halide ions and/or the influence of different conditions. Nevertheless, the importance of the perovskite/substrate interface to get efficient, stable and hysteresis-free devices is well known.23,40–43 In particular, the nature and structural properties of the materials that can be used as scaffolds and/or electron selective layers, not only determine the perovskite morphology and loading, but also the quality of the interaction in the interface. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report yet in which (1) the interaction between the hybrid halide perovskite (MAPbI3) and substrates (TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3) and (2) its influence on the degradation upon exposure to moisture have been studied. In this work, it is shown by FTIR spectroscopy analysis how the perovskite/ZnO interaction is different with respect to TiO2 and Al2O3. Taking into account the shift of the peak positions related to N–H (stretching and bending) and their instability in the presence of acidic groups, we infer that the perovskite interacts with the ZnO surface through the amine group. In addition, different mechanisms of moisture-induced degradation take place depending on the nature and morphological properties of substrates.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of n-contact oxide layers and MAPbI3 films
The silicon wafer was cut and cleaned by sonication in acetone and 2-propanol followed by drying in a N2 stream. The n-contact oxide layers were deposited using different materials and methods (Table 1). To deposit a dense TiO2 layer (cTiO2), 0.65 ml of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) and 0.38 ml of acetylacetone (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) were mixed with 5 ml of ethanol. This solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s over the substrates. The mesoporous TiO2 layers were prepared with 18NR-T (mTiO2) and 18NR-AO (sTiO2) acquired from Dyesol. The commercial TiO2 nanoparticle pastes were diluted 2:7 (w:w) in pure ethanol and spin-coated (5000 rpm, 30 s). The TiO2 layers were then sintered for 30 min at 500 °C. The ZnO layers were prepared using a colloidal suspension of ZnO nanoparticles obtained by a forced hydrolysis method diluted 1:1 (w:w) in ethanol (hZnO)44 or using a solution of commercial ZnO nanoparticles in ethanol: Pi-Kem (pZnO) and Evonik (eZnO). These solutions were spread onto the substrate by spin-coating (5000 rpm, 30 s) and then calcined for 30 min at 450 °C. Al2O3 thin films were prepared in a glancing angle configuration in an electron bombardment evaporator in a high vacuum system with a base pressure below 5 × 10−6 mbar. Aluminum pellets were used as precursors and evaporation was carried out at 5 × 10−4 mbar by dosing oxygen to the system. The substrates were placed at oblique angles of 85° and 65° with respect to the evaporator and deposition was performed at room temperature. To ensure the oxidation of the thin films, additional annealing in air was performed at 500 °C for 12 hours. The thickness of the samples was monitored using a Quartz Crystal Monitor, which at the mentioned oblique geometries, is ca. 300 and 530 nm for Al2O3 (85°) and Al2O3 (65°) thin films, respectively. These experimental conditions ensure highly transparent and porous thin films with a microstructure consisting of tilted columns.45,46

For perovskite (MAPbI3) synthesis, a 40 wt% solution that contains a mixture of PbCl2:CH3NH3I (1:3 in molar ratio) using DMF as solvent was deposited by spin-coating (2000 rpm, 60 s) onto the different substrates. The film was subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a vacuum and under a relative humidity lower than 15%. The CH3NH3I precursor was acquired from Dyesol.
The hole-selective material (HSM) solutions were prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OmeTad (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) or 20 mg of P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. Then 50 μL of each HSM solution were dropped on the substrate and spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
2.2 FTIR spectroscopy of thin films
The infrared spectra were measured in a transmittance mode using a Bruker IFS 66/S spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. The spectra were obtained by averaging 350 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 and 2.2 KHz as the scanning velocity in the 4000–500 cm−1 range. Spectra were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere and non-polarized light. All spectra were referenced to the spectrum of the bare-Si substrate.
2.3 Microstructural characterization
SEM analyses of the samples were performed using S5200 and S4800 microscopes from Hitachi, working between 2 and 5 kV. Secondary and backscattered electron (BSE) images were recorded at the same time using the S5200 apparatus giving additional composition information. X-ray diffraction patterns in a Bragg–Brentano configuration were acquired using a D8 Discover diffractometer (Bruker AXS).
3. Results and discussion
The thin films employed in this work were prepared using different methods and materials obtaining substrates with different microstructures and morphologies (see the ESI,† Fig. S1). A compact layer of TiO2 was used for the cTiO2 substrate, whereas a layer consisting of 20 and 20–100 nm TiO2 nanoparticles was employed for mTiO2 and sTiO2, respectively. eZnO, hZnO and pZnO substrates were prepared using ZnO nanoparticles of 20–50, 40–100 and 100–200 nm, respectively. In contrast to these nanoparticle films, a layer of Al2O3 nanocolumns deposited at 85° and 65° with respect to the source was used as Al2O3 (85°) and Al2O3 (65°) films, respectively.

Fig. 1 and Table 2 show the FTIR spectra and characteristic vibrational bands of MAPbI3 deposited on mTiO2, hZnO and Al2O3 (85°) substrates, whose main peaks are related to the frequency of vibrational modes of the organic cation10,36 (see the ESI,† Fig. S2). In Fig. 1A, the weak and broad peak at around 3500 cm−1 is related to O–H stretching vibrations as a consequence of carrying out the measurements under ambient conditions.38 However, the strong peaks between 3300 and 2900 cm−1 are related to the N–H stretching vibrations associated with the NH3+ group of the MA cation.10,36–38,47 In particular, this doublet has been attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric N–H stretching vibrations. The two latter vibrational modes exhibit the peaks at 3175 cm−1 (asym, ν1) and 3130 cm−1 (sym, ν2) when the perovskite is deposited on mTiO2 and Al2O3 (85°). However, a significant shift of these peaks (≈25 cm−1) was found for hZnO. In particular, the asymmetric and symmetric vibrational modes were assigned to peaks at 3205 and 3155 cm−1, respectively. In contrast, no shift was found for the asymmetric (ν3) and symmetric (ν4) C–H stretching vibrations (2975 and 2932 cm−1, respectively).10,36,37

Fig. 1B shows weaker vibrational modes of MAPbI3 mainly related to the bending and rocking modes in the range of 1800–800 cm−1. Following ref. 10, 36 and 37, we propose the following attribution of these peaks to the vibrational modes of MAPbI3: ν7 (1582 cm−1) is the asymmetric NH3+ bending, ν9 (1468 cm−1) is the symmetric NH3+ bending, ν10 (1422 cm−1) is the asymmetric CH3 bending mode, ν11 and ν13 (1250 and 910 cm−1, respectively) are the CH3–NH3+ rocking modes and ν12 (960 cm−1) is the C–N stretching mode. In Fig. 1B, the ν7, ν9, ν10 and ν11 peaks are observed at the same position when MAPbI3 is deposited on mTiO2, hZnO and Al2O3 (85°) substrates. In contrast, significant changes appear when hZnO is compared with respect to mTiO2 and Al2O3 (85°). Firstly, ν12 and ν13 peaks undergo a similar shift (≈25 cm−1) to ν1 and ν2. Secondly, the ν7/ν9 ratio is larger, so that the asymmetric N–H bending seems to be stronger. Thirdly, the ν9 peak changes its shape and an additional (ν8) peak becomes visible, which is also attributed to bending vibrations of NH3+. Therefore, bearing in mind that the ν5 and ν6 peaks were attributed to vibrational coupled modes37 (ν7 + ν11 and ν8/9 + ν11, respectively), only the ν6 peak shifts. Since similar results were found for TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3 substrates prepared using different preparation procedures and possessing different structural properties (see the ESI,† Fig. S3), we infer that the interactions found are attributable to the chemical nature of the oxide only, and not to the different morphologies of the substrate and the perovskite film deposited on it. Thus, it seems that the specific interface area between perovskite and substrates, which in fact determines the electron injection and recombination rates in complete PSCs, does not affect the frequency of vibrational modes of MAPbI3.
A similar displacement of peaks was also found previously by Glaser when different halides (X = Cl, Br and I) were used.37 These changes were tentatively explained by the Lorentz–Lorentz shift consequence of different interactions between MA and Pb–X. However, in our case the same perovskite (MAPbI3) has been used and not all peaks undergo a shift. As it was mentioned above, only (asym and sym) N–H stretching, (sym) N–H bending and C–N rocking vibrational modes of MAPbI3 are displaced when ZnO was used as a substrate. In particular, Bellanato et al.48 showed that the interaction between the NH3+ group and the support materials can cause not only the displacement of the position, but also a variation in the intensity of the peaks or even the appearance of new peaks, which could explain our results for ZnO. Therefore, the changes in the FTIR spectra seem to be mainly due to the different substrates used and to the fact that the interaction appears to occur through the NH3+ group, suggesting an acid–base reaction. This possible reaction could take place as a consequence of the instability of ZnO in the presence of an acidic group in contrast to TiO2 and Al2O3.49 This hypothesis seems to be supported by Fig. 2, where a morphological change in nanoparticles appears for hZnO substrates only after the deposition of the perovskite. In particular, Fig. 2e shows the formation of acicular ZnO particles in contrast to the spherical form of the hZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 2b). The size of the ZnO particles has also considerably increased after the deposition from 100 to 200 nm in diameter to lengths over 500 nm (see the ESI,† Fig. S4). These observations confirm the existence of a chemical reaction between perovskite and ZnO, which even causes the re-dissolution of the ZnO substrate and generation of a new morphology.

It is well known that moisture exposure shows both detrimental and beneficial effects on perovskite materials. For instance, during the perovskite processing small amounts of water can improve the optoelectronic properties, and hence the efficiency of the devices.9,38,50,51 Nevertheless, its prolonged exposure causes the formation of colorless hydrated CH3NH3PbI3·H2O or (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O with negative consequences for its photovoltaic performance.52–55 In order to study the interaction between water molecules and perovskite materials, the optoelectronic properties, perovskite morphology and crystal structure were analyzed in numerous papers. However, in this paper attention has been paid to the influence of the nature of the substrate itself on the degradation of the perovskite. To investigate the effects of water molecules on perovskite, the samples were stored under humid conditions (85% RH) for different times (see Scheme 1 in the ESI†) at room temperature and in the darkness.

Fig. 3A shows the FTIR spectra of perovskite deposited on the mTiO2 layer before and after exposure to moisture for 1, 3 and 5 hours. Müller et al.38 proposed a molecular model in which the water molecules modify the hydrogen bonds between MA and halide atoms forming new hydrogen bonds. Therefore, a shift and decrease of the asymmetric NH3+ stretching vibration mode (ν1) were found. In contrast to this result, Fig. 3A shows a decrease of the whole FTIR spectrum after exposure to moisture where the peaks appear at the same wavenumber. The decrease of the most intense absorption bands (ν1, ν2, ν9 and ν13) is stronger for longer exposure times to moisture. For instance, the signals corresponding to ν1 and ν2 vibrational modes are reduced to 77% and 65% of their initial values after 1 and 5 hours, respectively. Since these modes correspond to the N–H stretching vibrations, this observation strongly suggests that water molecules interact again with the perovskite via the ammonium group. The behavior of the ν9 peak (N–H bending) corroborates this interpretation. The formation of hydrates likely modifies the relative concentration of these groups in the sample. In addition, bearing in mind that the perovskite degradation is carried out by water surface adsorption and infiltration processes,38,56 it has been found that the degradation process also depends on the nanostructure of substrates (see the ESI,† Fig. S5). The general observation is that the degree of degradation increases in the order sTiO2 > cTiO2 > mTiO2. However, no direct relation between the particle size and degradation rate is detected.
 Fig. 3  (A) FTIR spectra of perovskite films deposited on mTiO2 films before (red line) and after (blue line) exposure to moisture for 1, 3 and 5 hours in the range of 4000–750 cm−1. (B) FTIR spectra of perovskite films deposited on hZnO and Al2O3 (85°) before (red line) and after (blue line) exposure to moisture for 3 hours in the range of 4000–600 cm−1. Labels indicate the fraction of signal intensity that remains after moisture exposure. 
On the other hand, it has been found that the perovskite degradation also depends on the nature of substrates. Fig. 3B shows FTIR spectra of perovskite deposited on hZnO and Al2O3 (85°) layers before and after exposure to moisture to study the influence of the chemical nature of the substrate on the interaction between the perovskite and water molecules. For both Al2O3 and ZnO film substrates, the spectral changes after exposure to moisture show the same behavior as observed for TiO2 in the sense that the intensity of the main peaks (ν1, ν2, ν9 and ν13) decreases. However, several differences can be observed. In the case of Al2O3 substrates, it seems that this oxide promotes the inclusion of water droplets as suggested by the behavior of the broad peak associated with the O–H stretching (≈3500 cm−1), which increases after the exposure. This is sort of expected as alumina is a hygroscopic material that tends to capture ambient moisture.
When ZnO was used as a substrate, the broad 3500 cm−1 peak gives rise to two well-defined peaks at 3500 and 3450 cm−1, associated with O–H vibrations in separated water molecules.38 In contrast to Al2O3, this observation indicates that isolated water molecules percolate within the structure in the case of ZnO. Additionally, the ν13 peak, which was assigned to the CH3–NH3+ rocking vibrational mode, shifts from 925 to 910 cm−1 and a new peak appears at 720 cm−1. Similar results were found for pZnO and eZnO (see the ESI,† Fig. S6). Nevertheless, a new additional peak at 1045 cm−1 appears after exposure to moisture for both pZnO and eZnO with respect to hZnO. This difference could be related to the different synthesis methods of ZnO, which determine the number of oxygen vacancies and then their reactivity. For instance, a clear difference was reported by Dong et al.49 during the perovskite formation process when ZnO films obtained by ALD and solution methods were employed as substrates. In any case, all these observations clearly indicate that the ZnO substrate induces a chemical change in the perovskite in the presence of moisture, and that this change is associated with the chemical nature of the oxide rather than the structural properties such as surface area, particle size or porosity. However, the fact that the perovskite tends to react with ZnO, and change its morphology, can also contribute to enhanced percolation of water molecules into the interface.
The peculiar results obtained when ZnO is used as a substrate, both with and without moisture, highlight the importance of specific interactions between perovskite and ZnO. In this regard, Zhang et al.42 claimed recently that the following decomposition is catalyzed by ZnO.CH3NH3PbI3 → CH3NH2 + PbI2 + HIThe formation of the amino group favors the acid–base reaction with water, which explains why all peaks related to the NH3+ group become affected. The PbI2 compound cannot be detected in the studied FTIR range (4000–500 cm−1).36 However, in Fig. 4 the yellowish coloration of the film after exposure to water suggests that PbI2 has formed in the presence of ZnO.

In order to analyze the influence of humidity on the crystal structure of perovskite the XRD patterns were recorded. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of perovskite deposited on mTiO2, hZnO and Al2O3 (85°) substrates before and after exposure to moisture (85% RH, 5 h). Characteristic diffraction peaks of perovskite appear when the MAPbI3 layer was deposited on all the different substrates. For instance, the stronger diffraction peaks, related to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of tetragonal perovskite, appear at 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.9°, respectively. Similar results were previously reported.42,51–53 When the MAPbI3 layer was subjected to moisture exposure, the characteristic diffraction peaks remained at the same positions. In spite of the decrease of the signal intensity, the persistence of these diffraction peaks guarantees the presence of crystalline MAPbI3. Nevertheless, there are some observable changes between the XRD patterns of perovskite before and after moisture exposure in relation to the nature of substrates. For instance, when the MAPbI3 layer was deposited on mTiO2, the diffraction peaks only suffer a decrease of signal intensity. However, additional diffraction peaks appear when the MAPbI3 layer was deposited on hZnO not only after moisture exposure, but also before it. The diffraction peaks at 12.7°, 25.95°, 38.7° and 52.48° were attributed to the presence of crystalline PbI2.42,52,53 In particular, similar results were found by Zhang et al. as a consequence of the decomposition of MAPbI3 due to a long annealing time.42 In any case, after exposure to moisture the signal of diffraction peaks associated with the crystalline MAPbI3 decreases, whereas the intensity of peaks attributed to PbI2 increase. A similar result was found when the MAPbI3 layer was deposited on the Al2O3 (85°) substrate after exposure to moisture. However, in this case no characteristic peaks associated with PbI2 appear either before or after exposure to moisture. This result brings to light the specific interaction that takes place between the perovskite material and substrates and it seems to point at different perovskite formation and degradation processes, involving the decomposition of the perovskite in accordance with the reaction indicated above.

Taking into account the effects of prolonged exposure to moisture on photoelectronic properties of PSCs, special attention has been paid to ensure long-term device stability, which is one of the most critical issues for their commercialization. Different strategies have been carried out to guarantee the stability of the perovskite films.57–60 At this point, it is important to remark that the HSMs not only collect the photogenerated holes, but also protect the underlying perovskite films against humidity.52 In order to determine how the FTIR technique can help assess how the nature of HSMs affects the perovskite degradation process, we have performed FTIR measurements of perovskite films in combination with two of the most employed HSMs.

Fig. 6 shows the FTIR spectra of MAPbI3 deposited on mTiO2 and hZnO films before and after exposure to moisture (RH 85%, 25 h) using Spiro-OmeTad and P3HT as HSMs and the uncovered perovskite film, which was used as control. It is important to state that the presence of the HSM does not modify the FTIR spectra of the perovskite, whose peaks appear at the same wavenumber. The combination of both materials produces the superposition of FTIR spectra of perovskite and HSMs. The FTIR spectra of both HSMs are shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S7). For both mTiO2 and hZnO substrates, the FTIR spectral changes after exposure to moisture show the same trends described above independently of which HSMs have been deposited. However, the signal of the peaks associated with the HSMs does not undergo any changes. This effect confirms that the decrease of the signal intensity of the peaks related to the vibrational modes of perovskite is a consequence of its degradation. In order to determine the influence of HSMs on the perovskite degradation process, we have analyzed the decrease of ν1 and ν2 vibrational mode intensities of MAPbI3. When the mTiO2 film was used as a substrate, these peaks are reduced to 82% and 92% of the original signal in combination with Spiro-OmeTad and P3HT, respectively. However, for the uncovered perovskite the signal is reduced to 47%. Even in the case of hZnO, for which as already discussed the degradation is faster, the same trend is maintained. These results infer that P3HT acts as a more efficient barrier than Spiro-OmeTad to prevent the perovskite degradation under humidity making the penetration/percolation of water molecules more difficult. Similar results were previously reported using UV-Vis spectroscopy as a testing tool.52

4. Conclusions
In this report, we have performed an experimental analysis of the vibrational properties of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites in the presence of various substrates used as selective layers in perovskite-based solar cells. In particular, we studied the influence of the chemical nature and morphological properties of the substrates on the perovskite formation and the influence of these substrates and HSMs on the degradation process upon moisture exposure.
In relation to the chemical nature of substrates, comparison of FTIR spectra of perovskites deposited on ZnO and the rest of the materials (TiO2 an Al2O3) shows that the peaks corresponding to N–H vibrational modes shifted (≈25 cm−1), which suggests the existence of a specific interaction between perovskite and ZnO. This observation is common to the three types of ZnO materials studied and points out that this interaction is driven by the NH3+ group of the organic cation. This specific interaction appears to be also behind the stronger perovskite degradation by moisture in the presence of ZnO. SEM images show that the perovskite even induces a change in the morphology of the ZnO substrate after deposition. Furthermore, FTIR spectra and XRD measurements strongly suggest that this oxide favors the degradation of the perovskite and the formation of PbI2. In addition, it is demonstrated that the morphological properties of substrates and the presence of HSMs also play an important role in the degradation rate of perovskite. In particular, a slower degradation rate was found when P3HT was used as the HSM.
The results reported here that the interaction between perovskite and selective contacts is crucial in the formation and stability of an interface suited for photovoltaic performance. In fact, the particular chemical nature of perovskite and metal oxide, as well as the morphology of the latter, can have a dramatic impact on the stability of the active film. On the other hand, the FTIR technique is shown to be a simple and effective technique to detect this kind of interaction.
