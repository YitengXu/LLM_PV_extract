    , Accepted 13th May 2020First published on 1st June 2020AbstractThe rapid growth of the global economy and urbanization have resulted in major worldwide issues such as greenhouse gas emission, air pollution and the energy crisis. Artificial ambient light is one of the greatest inventions in human history, but it is also one of the primary energy consumption constituents and a focus of the global grand energy challenge. Therefore, low cost and low energy consumption lighting technology is in high demand. In this review, we will summarise and discuss one of the emerging lighting technologies – white electroluminescence light-emitting diodes enabled by hybrid colloidal quantum dots (WQLEDs), which have attracted intense attention because of promising potential in both flat-panel backlighting and solid-state lighting. WQLEDs have unique high luminescence efficiency, broad colour tunability and solution processability. Over the past few decades, the development of colloidal quantum dot synthesis, material engineering and device architecture has highlighted the tremendous improvements in WQLED formation. As WQLED efficiencies approach those of molecular organic LEDs, we identify the critical scientific and technological challenges and provide an outlook for ongoing strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Introduction
Energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gasses have been grand global challenges ever since the Kyoto protocol in 1997. Technological advances in saving energy have drawn considerable attention from the general public, government, industry and academia. Lighting accounts for 22% of electricity use and 8% of all the energy use in the United States. In the UK about 8 TW h energy was consumed by different types of lighting in 2018. Conventional lighting methods result in massive energy waste due to their inferior power conversion efficiency, which indicates that replacement with novel lighting technology such as energy-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can directly contribute to the reduction of energy consumption as well as building environment-friendly societies. For instance, solid-state lighting (SSL), such as semiconductor LEDs, has already led to reduced electricity usage in the United States and could reduce the electricity used for lighting by 33% in the next decade.
The use of colloidal quantum dots (QDs), as emissive materials, is gaining massive attention in SSL, especially as potential materials employed in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), which have potential to replace current high energy-consumption lighting sources such as incandescent and fluorescent lamps.1,2 QDs are promising semiconductor nanocrystals with several unique physical and chemical properties, such as outstanding band-gap tunability, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), narrow linewidth and good solution processability.3–7 These properties of QDs have motivated increasingly intensive research aimed at applying them in the next generation of optoelectronics, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs),8–10 solar cells,11–16 photodetectors,15,17 and field-effect transistors.11,18,19 In fact, with high colour purity and wide colour gamut, televisions, monitors and tablets containing QDs have already appeared and are beginning to thrive in the consumer market.20 Remarkably, over the past few decades, the performance of QD-based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) has been substantially improved through innovative attempts such as novel designs of QD materials,21–23 development of charge transport layers and innovation of device architecture.9,24–26 For instance, Cd-based high-performance blue, and green monochromic QLEDs have been fabricated, while red devices presented the record-high EQE of 20% according to the theoretical limit.8,22,26 In parallel, investigations on multicoloured QLEDs have been implemented for their general applications to ambient lighting.27–31 With that development, the future of QD-based WLEDs (WQLEDs) can be visualized. In this short review, we present the progress and perspectives of using QDs for WQLED applications.
There are two main approaches to generating white emission through WQLEDs. The first, and currently mainstream, approach relies on a combination of the converted blue light from the chip and the remaining transmitted blue light to generate white emission. This strategy is known as phosphor-converted WQLEDs (pc-WQLEDs). At an early stage, the photoluminescence (PL) emission of colloidal QDs was mainly used in SSL sources in display backlighting. Many comprehensive reviews on this topic have been published, from conversion materials to devices, particularly the latest applications of perovskite QD materials.32–38 The second approach, which may prove superior in the longer term, is the development of white electroluminescence (EL) emission from colloidal QD LEDs, which is being pursued academically and commercially.6,9,39
This review mainly focuses on the EL mode approach to WQLEDs, with mention of pc-WQLEDs. We firstly give a brief tutorial on the fundamental colour science of WQLEDs, including the principles of human white light perception, the figures of merit for metrics, spectrum and characteristics of current white-lighting technologies and the working mechanism of PL mode WQLEDs and EL mode WQLEDs. We discuss the cases for, and the challenges in the use of QD materials for fabrication of PL mode WQLEDs. We summarize device architectures in Cd-based EL WQLEDs from initial single hybrid-QDs to more complex tandem structures as well as heavy-metal-free QD-based WQLEDs such as InP, Cu-chalcogenide-based and perovskite-based WQLEDs. In the end, we propose some potential solutions to develop better performance WQLEDs seeking to connect current academic achievement to the practical realization of WQLEDs for highly efficient ambient lighting.
2. Foundation of WQLEDs
2.1 What is ambient white light?
Ambient white light can be defined as a mixture of different wavelengths of photons primarily in the visible spectrum. As Newton described, if we have all the rainbow colour light and focus it onto one spot, then a white light can be obtained. Or by refracting a white light, a beam of white light can be converted to a rainbow-colour spectrum. Generally, white light can be generated from a variety of sources, such as the Sun and many other artificial sources.40,41 White light may be used for lighting in our daily life, but it can also be applied in other scenarios such as optical communication.42–44
2.2 The metrology of lighting sources
Before we go for comparison of different lighting technologies, it is necessary to go through several key parameters that are used to characterise WQLEDs. The efficiency of white lighting sources is quantified by their ability to generate a visual sensation, called luminous efficacy (LE). LE is based on convolution of the spectral power distribution (SPD) with the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, which peaks in the green range at 550 nm. LE is calculated by taking the ratio of the generated visual sensation to the power used to produce the light, and it is expressed in lumens per watt, instead of in percentage. As seen in eqn (1), the photometric equivalent to the radiant flux is the luminous flux ΦV and according to the definition, LE is expressed in eqn (2). (1) (2)where V(λ), S(λ) and P denote human eye sensitivity, spectral power distribution and consumed power, respectively.
The sensation of white lighting colour is complicated to determine, but it can be defined by chromaticity coordinates, colour temperature and colour rendering. As shown in Fig. 1a, chromaticity coordinates usually quantify the radiation of colour, and their values can be calculated using tristimulus values X, Y, Z obtained by integrating the spectrum with the standard colour-matching functions x, y, z from a standard observer (introduced by Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) in 1931), as shown in eqn (3). Thus, for a constant energy white point on the CIE chromaticity diagram, it was expected that x = y = z = 1/3. (3)

The correlated colour temperature (CCT) of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black body radiator, determined by Planck's law, that radiates light of comparable hue to that light source. White light may be classified as being warm, neutral and cold concerning the emission of ideal white light reference. As the temperature of a typical black body increases from 2000 K to 10000 K, the emitted white light shifts from lower colour temperatures (2700–3000 K), called “warm-white” (yellowish), to neutral-white (3500–4000 K) and to temperatures over 5000 K, which are called “cool-white” (bluish).
Colour-rendering index (CRI) is another crucial parameter representing the ability to regenerate object colours as viewed under an ideal white light source, such as standardized daylight and a Planckian radiator. By illuminating eight test colour samples and six supplementary ones selected from the colour palette introduced by MUNSELL, first with an ideal white-light source, then with the white-light source of interest, it is possible to quantify the deviation in the reflected spectra.45,46 According to this definition, sunlight and incandescent bulbs have a CRI value of 100, which is ideal, and values above 80 are typically regarded sufficient for indoor white lighting. In general, the higher the CRI value, the lower the possible LE because of the human visual response peaks at 550 nm. This means 550 nm light would have a very high LE of radiation (683 lm W−1 according to eqn (1)) but would just render the objects that can reflect at 550 nm wavelength. Hence, we can also presume that there is a trade-off: the wider the spectrum, the better the colour rendering value but the lower the luminous efficacy.
2.3 Spectrum and characteristics of different artificial white lights
Since the development of incandescent light bulbs in the late 1800s, various methods have been investigated for producing white light as an ambient lighting source. The incandescent bulbs are cheap, with a well-established manufacturing process. Even though their LE has improved from 1.51 lm W−1 to 16 lm W−1, the majority of their energy is transformed into heat, limiting the device efficiency. The fluorescent light bulb is another conventional and widely used white lighting source, and its LE has improved from 50 to 100 lm W−1 over the 60 years since its invention in 1938. Compared with sunlight (standard white light), while the spectrum of incandescent light is continuous but insufficient in the blue and green range, fluorescent light emits more discretely, as shown in the light spectral distribution (Fig. 2). White-light sources based on reliable and energy-efficient LEDs have only been made available in recent decades through developments in semiconductors. Nowadays, current commercial white LEDs reach 150 lm W−1, which is far higher than traditional incandescent lights and fluorescent lights. In terms of CRI, incandescent and halogen lights are capable of producing a white light of 100 CRI, but the CRI value of the fluorescent lights is the lowest (<80), while most white LEDs range between these two extremes (Fig. 1b). Since the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the QD emission spectrum is ∼30–40 nm,47,48 compared with ∼50–100 nm in inorganic phosphors,49 QDs can be excellent luminescence sources for saturated emission colour and therefore higher CRI. Furthermore, old-generation white LEDs typically emit a cool bluish colour with high CCT (>5000 K) and low CRI (as seen in Fig. 1b) due to the blue-chip and yellow phosphor combination and the lack of a narrow red-light component.3 The narrow spectral emission of the QDs can offer more selective supplementary optical down-conversion to achieve efficient high CRI lighting sources.

From a human health perspective, fluorescent light contains mercury, a neuro-toxic hazardous element, and it is difficult to recycle fluorescent light tubes. As can be noticed in Fig. 2, the spectrum of fluorescent light consists of a certain amount of ultraviolet (UV) light; the potential UV leakage can lead to the user getting retina-damage at close range or skin-burn. The 100–120 hertz flickering may lead to eye fatigue and headaches.50 In general, there is increasing concern about the impact on the human circadian system from the blue light component in white lighting. Fluorescent and white LEDs emit more blue light than a sunset or an incandescent light. When people are subjected to these blue-rich white lighting sources, photosensitive cells in the brain will be adversely influenced, which can have side effects on such characteristics as sleep and waking cycles, metabolism, reproduction, mental alertness, blood pressure, heart rate, hormone production, and the immune system.41 Consequently, it is of great importance to reduce the proportion of short-wavelength blue-light in general purpose white lighting and keep white light indirect, flicker-free and dimmable, suitably matching with the human circadian system. From the perspective of room lighting applications, large area panel lighting is much desired.1
2.4 Working mechanism of WQLEDs
There are two main approaches to realising WQLEDs. The first and mainstream approach combines blue or UV chips with a colour conversion layer consisting of a phosphor and a transparent polymer resin. The WQLEDs in this mode are usually referred to as pc-WQLEDs and are physically based on the PL behaviour of SSL materials. A typical configuration of a pc-WQLED involves a cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce3+) and a blue inorganic LED. As shown in Fig. 3a, some portion of the emission from the blue LED excites a conversion phosphor to generate yellow emission, and when this emission is combined with the remaining portion of blue light, the human brain perceives white light, albeit with low CRI and CCT due to the missing red component.3,51 To address this issue, an extra red phosphor can be added but the emission spectra of conventional red phosphors are unfortunately too broad to avoid loss in LE. Alternatively, red/green/blue (R/G/B) conversion layers can be integrated simultaneously over a UV chip, where a full conversion occurs with all UV light absorbed and converted (Fig. 3b).

The second approach is essentially the EL process in the luminescent QD materials, where white emission is generated by electron–hole pair recombination at the junctions formed within three primary-colour luminescent QD materials. The architecture of EL mode WQLEDs can be classified into three types according to the number of layers, namely, single-layer mixed, multilayer and tandem structure (Fig. 3c). For the single mixed-QD WQLEDs, the emitting layer (EML) consists of a mixture of three R/G/B QD materials, which are sandwiched between an electron-injecting cathode and a hole-injecting anode. A typical WQLED consists of (i) a front transparent electrode – e.g., indium tin oxide (ITO), (ii) electron/hole transport and hole/electron blocking layers, (iii) QD emitting layer, and (iv) a back electrode – e.g., Al or Au. In earlier times, the blue emitting QDs were replaced with a blue-emitting molecule or polymer since high-performance blue QDs were difficult to fabricate.41,52–55 For multilayered and tandem configuration WQLEDs R/G/B layers are coated subsequently, and different multiple transparent interconnecting layers (ICLs) are inserted between EMLs.
Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are the main parameters used to quantitatively assess the quantum efficiency of WQLEDs. IQE is the efficiency of the charge recombination process inside the WQLEDs. EQE is defined as the ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of injected electrons, and may be expressed as:EQE = ηrχηPLηocwhere ηr is the fraction of injected charges that generate excitons in the QDs, χ is the fraction of generated excitons in spin-allowed optical transitions and usually close to unity, ηPL is the PLQY for this optical transition and ηoc is the fraction of emitted photons that are coupled out of the WQLEDs. As WQLEDs often consist of solid-state phase QD films, ηPL directly limits the maximum device-efficiency, which is associated with non-radiative Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) of excitons to non-luminescent sites before non-radiative recombination,56–58 non-radiative energy transfer to adjacent conducting layers,59 injected-charge-induced Auger recombination and electric-field-induced exciton dissociation.60–62
3. Viable approaches for PL mode WQLEDs
Since the 1990s, the successful commercialisation of GaN blue-emitting LEDs has enabled WLEDs using SSL materials.63 However, WLEDs based on a blue-chip and YAG phosphor can only exhibit a yellowish-white colour, with CCT of 4000–8000 K, corresponding to the neutral and cool-white specifications, and their CRI is typically lower than 80. However, in many applications such as indoor illumination, WLEDs are required to provide warm enough light with CCT > 4000 K and CRI higher than 80.38,64
The rapidly developing solution-processed QDs exhibit great potential to be a better candidate for next-generation WLED phosphor materials.34,65,66 Unlike conventional phosphor materials, which might suffer from insufficient blue-light excitation and substantial scattering loss of light, the excitation and emission of QD materials can be easily shifted by changing size or composition.67 The QD materials are sufficiently small to suppress light scattering and so high quantum efficiency and photostable QD materials are promising substitutes for conventional phosphors.
Early-stage research started from Cd-based QD materials because they feature excellent tunability, relatively small overlap between emission and absorption spectra, and facile processability. In 2007, Nizamoglu et al. reported CdSe/ZnS core–shell WQLEDs. When QDs were combined in single, binary, ternary and quaternary manners and then hybridized with InGaN/GaN LEDs, tristimulus coordinates (TCs), CCT and CRI parameters could be readily tuned.37 Similarly, a blue/green two-wavelength InGaN/GaN LED coated with red-emitting CdSe/ZnS QDs, and a blue InGaN/GaN LED with single yellow-emitting CdSe/ZnSe QDs and a dual red- and green-emitting CdSe/ZnSe have also been reported, with the latter achieving CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33) and CRI of 91.68 Therefore, high colour rendering properties can be obtained by combining multiple-colour QDs as phosphor materials. Jang et al. fabricated WQLEDs via hybridizing Sr3SiO5:Ce3+,Li+ phosphors and CdSe QDs on blue InGaN chips and their devices exhibited CRI of 90.1 and CCT of 8864 K.69 Moreover, silica-coated InP/ZnS QDs together with green- and yellow-emitting phosphors have been successfully applied by Ziegler et al. in the fabrication of WQLEDs, allowing prototype LED chips with 53 lm W−1 luminous efficiency.70
CdSe/ZnS is the most studied core–shell QD structure, but the significant lattice mismatch (ca. 12%) between CdSe and ZnS inevitably induces strain at the core–shell interface, which negatively affects both the PL efficiency and stability of CdSe/ZnS QDs.71–73 Likewise, InP/ZnS core–shell QDs, with a significant lattice mismatch of 7.7% between the core and shell, possess a moderate quantum yield (QY).74 To overcome this issue, an intermediate shell is usually introduced prior to an outer shell.75–77 Apart from II–VI type semiconductor QDs, II–III–VI type, as Cd-free QDs, are also readily achievable through controlling the stoichiometry between group II, III, and VI ions or forming the solid solution between structurally similar phases, and is consequently applied in WQLEDs. To date, Cu-III–VI QDs and their alloys with ZnS have been used in nearly all reports on WQLED applications, mainly due to two reasons. First, the emission of Cu-III–VI QDs can be tailored not only by size, but also by controlling the composition, defect type, and composite concentration, and by alloying with other elements such as Ga and Zn.32 Second, Cu-III–VI QDs are characterised by a broad emission spectrum, which is negative for displays but beneficial to white lighting.78–82 For example, Song et al. fabricated WQLEDs by using two combinations of ZnS coated Cu–In–Ga–S (CIGS) QDs and by optimising the In/Ga ratio, reaching conversion efficiencies of 83%, CRI up to 78, and luminous efficacies up to 82.3 lm W−1.56 Chen et al. combined red- and green-emitting CuInS (CIS)-based QDs within the same resin and the device reached a high CRI of up to 95 and a luminous efficiency of up to 70 lm W−1.83
Metal halide perovskites have emerged recently, which could be suitable phosphor candidates.3–5 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of comprehensive studies on using perovskite QDs as phosphor materials for white lighting. Apart from some standard features of QD materials, metal halide perovskite QDs bear unique properties such as long carrier lifetimes, high carrier mobility and high defect tolerance.84–88 Indeed, in the WQLEDs, the halide perovskites could be used together with a YAG phosphor, or replacing YAG, or to obtain R/G/B colours on UV LEDs, respectively.34
4. Viable approaches for EL mode WQLEDs
4.1 Cd-based WQLEDs
In the early development stage, researchers used II–VI semiconductor QDs, such as CdSe, in combination with an emitting polymer to fabricate WQLEDs since CdSe QDs exhibit size-dependent colour tunability, high PLQY and good solution processability.89–92 For example, Gigli et al., demonstrated hybrid organic/inorganic WQLEDs using blue-emitting poly[(9,9-dihexyloxyfluoren-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(2-methoxy-5-{2-ethylhexyloxy}phenylen-1,4-diyl)] (PFH-MEH) polymer doped with red-emitting CdSe/ZnS core–shell structured QDs and Alq3 small molecules. By accurately adjusting the concentration ratio of the QDs/PFH-MEH blend, the authors successfully controlled the Förster energy and charge-transfer in devices and achieved the fabrication of relatively pure WQLEDs, with CIE coordinates at (0.30, 0.33).93 In 2006, the same research group realized the first hybrid WQLEDs with emission originating only from the R/G/B ternary CdSe/ZnS QDs.94 The structures of the WQLED and its control device are presented in Fig. 4a and b, wherein R-, G-, and B-CdSe/ZnS QDs are blended optimally with the (4,4′,N,N′-diphenylcarbazole) (CBP) host, thereby obtaining the maximum brightness at 1050 cd m−2 at 58 mA cm−2 and turn-on voltage at 6 V in air. Additionally, according to the PL and EL spectra (Fig. 4d), it is claimed that the exciton generation on QDs happens via two mechanisms: (I) direct charge injection and recombination on the ternary CdSe/ZnS QDs and (II) Förster energy transfer from adjacent CBP and Alq3 (Fig. 2c). But it should be noticed that this WQLED exhibited quite a low current efficiency (CE) at 1.8 cd A−1, which is mainly because of low QY from QDs and insufficient charge injection from the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL).

Later on, a mixed-monolayer of R/G/B three colour emitting CdSe/ZnS WQLED was demonstrated, which can generate a broad spectral emission.27 Although the fabricated device showed a CRI of 86 as compared to a 5500 K blackbody reference and CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.41), its low EQE of 0.36% is unfavourable and far from the application requirement. To be more specific, compared with that of red and green CdSe/ZnS QDs, the performance of blue QDs is weaker due to their less efficient electron and hole injections and less probable exciton energy transfer from neighbouring polymer layers. As a result, blue QDs become the most challenging part in the mixed-monolayer WQLEDs for better performance. In 2015, Ki-Heon et al. reported the fabrication of multicolour-emissive WQLEDs via a solution-processing of ZnO NPs EHL and poly(9-vinlycarbazole) (PVK) EHL, which reached a record high EL performance including peak luminance values of 23352 cd m−2, CE of 21.8 cd A−1, and 10.9% EQE.28
In addition to mixing primary colour QDs in a single emitting layer, multilayer WQLEDs via the layer-by-layer deposition method can reduce inter-QD FRET with less contact between different R/G/B coloured QDs, and thus better device performance can be expected. However, in the conventional deposition process (spin-coating, dip-coating, etc.), the previously coated QD layer will be damaged by subsequently coating miscible QD layers. So, the traditional wet coating method would be incompatible with the sequential stacking of different coloured QD EMLs. How to avoid the inhomogeneous QD films and fabricate a desirable morphology between QD layers became one of the main concerns for multilayered WQLEDs. In this regard, novel methods have been proposed for the formation of multilayered QD EMLs. For instance, Bae et al. introduced a layer-by-layer way by using electrostatic interactions between each QD layer via the sequential deposition of oppositely charged green and red QDs.95 Besides, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp-based dry transfer printing has been used for the realization of R/G/B QD full-colour display devices.39,96 However, the transfer printed WQLEDs inevitably result in spectral overlap, which means that the device would not possess highly colour-pure R/G/B constituents. Moreover, the WQLEDs, as mentioned above exhibit only a mediocre performance in terms of luminance and CE.39,96
Recently, Yang et al. reported all-solution-processed R/G/B full-colour WQLEDs with a standard structure, where sequentially coated R/G/B QD EMLs were sandwiched by PVK and ZnO NPs (Fig. 5a and c).97 The creative point is that an ultrathin ZnO NP buffer layer was inserted between different-coloured QD EMLs, so that the underlying QD layer was protected from the subsequent solution coating process. (The PL results are presented in Fig. 5b(i) and (ii), which the hexane rinsing test proved.) Even though Fig. 5d(i) shows that the three primary colour emission spectra were well-separated with marginal overlap, the emission colour of the as-obtained WQLEDs was still unstable as the emission intensities increased dissimilarly with rising voltage (Fig. 5d(ii)). Some previous studies also presented similar voltage-dependent spectral variance, and the smaller bandgap QDs would generally contribute less EL when the devices are biased at higher working voltage.28,98,99 Specifically, as shown in the energy band diagram within the multilayered WQLED, the electron injection barrier from the ETL to red QDs is much lower than the hole injection barrier from the HTL to blue QDs. Then the exciton formation zone can be at the blue QD EML. But under higher voltage bias, HTL-to-blue QD hole injection becomes sufficient, leading to exciton generation across the whole QD EMLs and marginally changed luminance, CE and EQE (Fig. 5f).

Consequently, it is still challenging to avoid migration of the exciton recombination zone inside the multilayered WQLEDs, which hinders further improvement of the WQLED performance matching the over 20% state-of-the-art monochromatic QLEDs.26,100–102 As mentioned above, adoption of the inserted ZnO layer in multilayered WQLEDs will potentially bring about the following problems: (1) as an ETL material, ZnO would prevent sufficient hole injection between the QD EMLs and thus further impair the balanced charge injection process, especially hole injection from B-QDs to G/R-QDs; (2) adoption of the ZnO layer could also introduce defects which may quench excitons and adversely affect the device performance; (3) ∼3 nm ZnO cannot entirely suppress intrinsic inter-QD FRET. Other architectures should be applied to realize higher current efficiency, purer colour emission and more stable WQLEDs for efficient lighting and backlight applications.
Tandem architectures have been broadly applied in the manufacture of white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) in industry because tandem WOLEDs have proved their excellent function, stable performance and long lifetime in applications such as OLED TVs and OLED lighting panels.103–105 This development experience has been brought into the fabrication of tandem WQLEDs. Typically, in a tandem device, two or more EL units are serially connected through a transparent ICL, thus the CE and EQE of tandem LEDs are usually two or more times higher than those of the single LEDs as current passes through more than one EL layer. However, there are still barriers preventing the development of tandem WQLEDs. First, QD EMLs are usually deposited by solution-processing, whereas most efficient small molecule ICLs can be easily washed away by the solvents when QDs are subsequently coated. Second, it is challenging to maintain every homogeneous layer in good condition because the tandem structure contains more functional layers than any other. This is even more challenging with WQLEDs due to the requirement of successive deposition of the three R/G/B layers. Therefore, to date, all-solution-processed tandem WQLEDs have seldom been reported.
In 2017, Zhang et al. first achieved a white tandem WQLED by serially connecting R/G/B CdZnSeS/ZnS QDs EMLs using a proposed ZnMgO/(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio-phene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (PEDOT:PSS) heterojunction ICL.98 Unfortunately, the resultant WQLEDs exhibited a low CE of 4.75 cd A−1 and a CIE coordinate of (0.30, 0.44), which can be attributed to morphology deterioration between the pre-deposited ZnMgO and the post-deposited PEDOT:PSS associated with their hydrophilicity mismatch. Replacing hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS with other hydrophobic ICL materials or adjusting hydrophilicity by interface engineering could be one solution to this problem.
By replacing the aqueous PEDOT:PSS with PMA (polyoxometalate phosphomolybdic acid), Cao et al. reported tandem WQLEDs with a high CE of 60.4 cd A−1 and EQE of 27.3% at a luminance of 100000 cd m2.106 The device architecture is presented in Fig. 6a, and a cross-sectional STEM image in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6d gives the energy level diagram of this tandem WQLED and the energy level diagram of red QDs/ZnO/PMA/HTL/red QDs is shown in Fig. 6e, which explains the charge formation and injection within the heterointerface between the neighbouring QD EMLs. To be more precise, when a device is under forward bias, the shifting of the vacuum level will lead to smooth electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of PMA to that of ZnO before injection into the CB of the QD EML. In contrast, the hole on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTL transfers in the opposite direction to the valence band (VB) of the other adjacent QD EML.107,108 Consequently, each layer of R/G/B EMLs is spatially separate, and FRET is thus effectively prohibited in the tandem WQLEDs. Even when driving bias varies, the recombination zone in tandem WQLEDs will not migrate owing to inserted ICLs. Therefore, WQLEDs naturally exhibit a comparable level of efficiency with that of the latest monochromatic QLEDs, which is far better than mixed-QD and multilayered WQLEDs mentioned above.

4.2 InP WLEDs
Despite apparent advantages such as the high PLQY, narrow emission linewidth and excellent photostability of Cd-based QDs,109–111 the inherent toxicity of cadmium makes it environmentally restricted and its broad commercialisation is thus doubted by both academia and the public.112 InP with a bandgap of 1.35 eV has been considered as one of the potential alternatives to Cd-based QDs because it can provide comparable emission wavelength but without the toxicity problem.113–115
Similar to Cd-based WQLEDs, in the initial period, InP-based WQLEDs were first realized by integration of green InP QDs with R/B emissive polymers. In 2012, research by Sun et al. demonstrated a hybrid WQLED based on one-pot solvothermal synthesised InP/ZnS core–shell QDs sandwiched by poly(N,N′-bis-4-butylphenyl-N,N′-bisphenyl)benzidine (Poly-TPD) and 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), which exhibited a high CRI of 91 (Fig. 7a and b).29 Then, the same research group reported another InP-based WQLED with the same device architecture but higher CRI of 95 and better CIE coordinates of (0.349, 0.342).116 Analogous to multilayered Cd-based WQLEDs, ternary combination InP-based WQLEDs also exhibited distinctive voltage dependence since the EL spectra, and CIE chromaticity coordinates of WQLEDs shifted as a function of bias (Fig. 7c and d). Meanwhile, there has been some development of monochromatic InP QLEDs,117–120 but colour purity and emission spectrum tunability are still much inferior to that of the well-developed Cd-based QDs. The inferior properties stem from the strong coordinating strength of indium ligands and hard core–shell formation, which induce difficulties in the synthesis procedure, especially in the case of blue light-emitting InP QDs. As a result, high-performance fully colloidal InP QD-based WLEDs are rarely reported.

4.3 CIGS WQLEDs
Cu chalcogenide QDs are also good candidates to replace toxic heavy-metal (Cd and Pb) compound semiconductors in solution-processed WQLEDs. Among the broad variety of Cu chalcogenide QDs, Cu (In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS/CIGSe) QDs and their alloys with ZnS have been used as the EL material in many Cu-based WQLEDs.121–123 The emission wavelength of CIGS QDs can be easily controlled by varying the composition,122–125 which enables not only high colour gamut and broad PL emission to achieve high CRI but also relatively long lifetimes in WQLEDs.32 For example, WQLEDs were obtained by Zhang et al. using red-emitting ZnCuInS/ZnS core/shell QDs and the blue-green emission of Poly-TPD in a bilayer structure, whose CRI reached up to 92 as compared to that of the 5310 K blackbody reference (Fig. 8a and b).126 Recently, Teng et al. fabricated WQLEDs by using yellow Cu–In–Zn–S/ZnS core/shell QDs blended with poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine) (TFB), whose EL colours were reported to be tunable from blue-green to white by varying the thermal annealing temperatures.127 The resultant WQLEDs exhibited a low turn-on voltage of 2.5 V and a maximum luminance of 1500 cd m−2, with a CRI of 90 and CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.32).

As mentioned above, CIGS QDs naturally tend to have a broad PL emission, and this will be disadvantageous in the fabrication of monochromatic QLEDs, which means that the reports focus on multilayered and tandem CIGS-based WQLEDs. In this sense, use of a single QD emitter rather than multiple ones as the EML may be highly advantageous for CIGS-based WQLEDs, by either doping impurity ions such as Cu+ and Mn2+ into the QD host,128 or introducing radiative charge recombination at defect-associated intragap states in QDs.129,130 In 2016, Yang et al. obtained high, broad visible coverage emission CGS/ZnS QDs with the highest QY of 76% by optimally controlling the off-stoichiometry of Cu/Ga and adjusting the ZnS-shelling period of Cu/Ga.30 In this WQLED, a very stable white-light emission can be maintained regardless of the change of bias voltage, whose emission is attributed solely to the radiative recombination of the injected charged QD EML, instead of including any contribution from HTL emission (Fig. 8c–g).
4.4 Perovskite WQLEDs
Hybrid organic–inorganic and all-inorganic metal halide perovskite QDs (HOIP and AIP QDs) have been intensively studied during the past few years.35,131,132 The first known halide perovskite was based on organic cations, featuring small exciton binding energy, strong absorption and high carrier mobility, and therefore proved successful in photovoltaic (PV) devices.85,133,134 Apart from in PV devices, perovskite materials have also shown superb properties when they were applied in other optoelectronic devices, including displays, WLEDs and others.135–138 The first breakthrough of perovskite-based LEDs was a MAPbBr3 green LED reported in 2014, which exhibited a bright luminance of 364 cd m−2 and EQE of 0.1% at room temperature.139 Only one year later, by elaborate interfacial engineering, MAPbBr3-based monochromatic LEDs have achieved a 20-fold enhancement in LE and outstanding improvement in terms of luminance and EQE, reaching 20000 cd m−2 and 3.5%, respectively.140 It should be pointed out that despite remarkable progress in green- and red-perovskite-based LEDs, the efficiency of blue perovskite-based QLEDs has not reached a comparable level, which reasonably hampers the fabrication of HOIP-based WQLEDs where the desired R/G/B HOIP QDs are prerequisites.
In 2015, the first fabrication of CsPbX3-based AIP QLEDs was reported by Song et al. with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al (Fig. 9a).141 Noticeably, the colour of the devices can be adjusted from blue to green and orange by changing the content and anion category, which achieved luminances of 742 cd m−2, 946 cd m−2, and 528 cd m−2, with external quantum efficiencies of 0.07%, 0.12%, and 0.09%, respectively. As seen in Fig. 9b and c, the FWHM was smaller than 30 nm for all colours, and three-colour QLEDs can cover the upper left part of the CIE diagram.

For both HOIP and AIP QDs, applications in WQLEDs are rarely reported. For instance, Yang et al. synthesized CsPbBrxCl3−x QDs, with a blue emission peak at 470 nm and with a narrow bandwidth.142 The authors then demonstrated WQLEDs by blending blue-emitting CsPbBrxCl3−x QDs with the orange-emitting polymer, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH:PPV) as the EML (Fig. 9d). Within the active EML, Dexter energy-transfer and Förster energy transfer were verified to coincide, allowing the device to reach a brightness of 350 cd m−2 and CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.33, 0.34) (Fig. 9e and f). Nevertheless, only at a high driving bias of 8 V can the ultimate light be emitted, and an ideal CIE coordinate reached, indicating that a reduction of turn-on voltage is required for better performance. Blending two types of perovskite materials is another method for perovskite-based WQLED fabrication. Mao et al. demonstrated an all-perovskite WQLED with stacking of two-dimensional red-emitting (CH3CH2CH2NH3)2CsPb2I7 perovskite and cyan colour CsPb(Br,Cl)3 QDs as EMLs.143 By carefully choosing the mixture of bis(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole)-phenylphosphine oxide (BIPO) and Poly-TPD as the ICL, the device not only exhibited CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.32) and CCT of 6000 K, but also maintained steady CIE coordinates in a wide range of driving current density from 2.94 to 56.29 mA cm−2. Despite satisfactory device performance obtained in recent years, the stability of HOIP and AIP QD WLEDs remains a significant issue in this early stage materials platform.144 It has gradually become clear that perovskites lack structural and chemical stability in the presence of moisture or heat. Phase segregation, ion migration and some electrochemical reactions also account for degradation of the perovskite materials in optoelectronic devices.145–147
To sum up, the Cd-based WQLEDs exhibit exceptional and stable device performance, with tandem WQLEDs reaching a high CE of 60.4 cd A−1 and EQE of 27.3% at a luminance of 100000 cd m2.106 Nevertheless, the heavy-metal property of Cd-based QDs prevents their widespread application in general white-lighting scenarios due to public health and environmental concerns. InP and CIGS are emerging as promising alternative nanocrystals for WQLEDs due to their nontoxicity and partially abundant composition. However, the emission linewidth of the typical InP QDs reported is wider (50–80 nm) than that of CdSe (15–40 nm), which leads to a worse colour purity compared to that of CdSe.29,148 CIGS QDs, on the other hand, may encounter more challenges because the control of these quaternary composition QD surface stoichiometry/defects and assembly/deposition/combination during the synthesis stage is rather complicated, in particular, a comprehensive understanding and theoretical models for the origin of PL broadness, and composition-dependent emission wavelength and PLQY is still lacking.32 As for the perovskite-based WQLEDs, it is easier to achieve higher PLQY, and narrower emission linewidth compared to Cd-based, InP and CIGS QDs; but the perovskite stability and corresponding device lifetime need to be further improved.
5 Outlook and opportunities for future hybrid WQLEDs
As highlighted in this review, there has been a rapid development of WQLEDs over the past decade. The intensive research on QD material properties and application in lighting has continuously produced breakthroughs beyond the state-of-the-art SSL in terms of colour purity, device-efficiency and versatility.
5.1 PL mode hybrid WQLEDs
The WQLEDs based on PL mode mainly rely on the adoption of novel QD-based phosphor materials since the InGaN/GaN blue-chip has already been commercialised. The main challenge for PL mode WQLEDs lies in new methods to achieve CCT > 4000 K and CRI higher than 80. However, improving the photostability and reducing the thermal quenching is supposed to be another challenge since PL mode LEDs generally work at high flux and temperature (>100 W cm−2 150 °C) and QD materials may be unstable under long operation time under these conditions.33 The cores of QDs are usually passivated with shells to improve QD photostability and thermal stability since pure cores may not maintain long-term stability in solution and suffer from photo-oxidation.149–151 For example, ZnS is an ideal outer shell material for QD materials as it shows better photo-oxidation resistance to CdSe QDs than the CdS shell under continuous UV irradiation, which is attributed to the larger bandgap difference between CdSe and ZnS, lowering the photogenerated charge carrier density.152 Therefore, optimal design of strain-graded core/shell interfaces, alloyed QDs or gradient composition shell structures could be solutions to the photostability and thermal quenching problems in PL mode hybrid WQLEDS. Remote type WLEDs may provide an alternative way to solve the stability issues; however, more work should be done to approach the industrial requirements.49
5.2 EL mode hybrid WQLEDs
In terms of EL mode WQLEDs, considerable progress has been achieved in both QD materials and device architectures. The early-stage EL mode WQLEDs are mainly based on the development of Cd-based QD WLEDs. Work has progressed from a mixed-QD single emission layer to the stacking of R/G/B multilayered and then to a tandem structure where inter-connecting transfer layers have been inserted. At present, the performance of Cd-based WLEDs has reached the same level as that of the latest WOLEDs.103–105 However, even though embedded charge transport layers can suppress non-radiative Auger recombination and FRET between adjacent EMLs and avoid intermixing problems, the balance of hole and electron transport will inevitably be another issue to be confronted. Moreover, for tandem Cd-based WQLEDs, how to develop a novel fabrication process and at the same time maintain balanced charge carrier injection are the remaining challenges to be investigated in future studies.
Meanwhile, heavy-metal-free environment-friendly WQLEDs have become the new research trend. Currently, the device performance of InP and Cu chalcogenide-based WQLEDs is far below the requirement of practical applications, and it is mandatory to improve their red- and green-QLEDs to catch up with Cd-based counterparts before realising full-colour WQLEDs.74 As for InP and CIGS blue-emitting QLEDs, it is difficult to efficiently inject carriers into blue QDs due to their wide bandgap, corresponding to energy transfer in the QD films, interface charge transfer between blue QDs and CTLs, and electric field-induced quenching in blue QLEDs. It is also hard to achieve high efficiency and sharp and narrow PL intensity in ternary and quadruple Cu chalcogenide-based blue-emitting QDs. However, the broad PL emission and relatively long lifetimes may represent a disadvantage in monochromatic LEDs, but it is an advantage to secure a high-colour CRI in WQLEDs (Table 1).

The PLQYs for perovskite QDs are approaching nearly 100% in both solutions and solids, rendering desirable device efficiencies.153–155 However, the blue-emitting perovskite-based LED devices remain low efficiency, which might be related to poor electrochemical stability and low PLQY. This can be attributed to surface defects that inherently induce nonradiative electron–hole recombination. Given the physical and chemical nature of perovskite-based QD materials, their stability against moisture, heat, oxygen, and electric field will continue to be an area of intense research. The lack of data about the device stability and the degradation mechanism of the WQLEDs – i.e., loss of efficiency and colour changes (CRI, CCT, etc.) – complicates the path through new achievements toward highly stable perovskite-based WQLEDs.
5.3 Future opportunities for hybrid QD WQLEDs
The field of WQLEDs has made tremendous strides, and the need for lower cost, and higher efficiency devices will continue to drive materials and device innovation. While WQLEDs incorporating Cd-free QDs have been demonstrated, much of the understanding of WQLED EL-mode performance is linked to Cd-containing QDs. While the percentage of heavy metals in WQLEDs can be small, demonstration of the high-performing Cd-free EL-mode WQLEDs will likely be the future focus because they are crucial to securing widespread industry and government support for ambient lighting. As the colloidal QD-based LEDs have been successfully commercialised in high-definition televisions (HDTVs), it will become possible for WQLEDs to build their market share in global ambient lighting applications.
In terms of device structure opportunities, the most pertinent investigations for improving the WQLED performance should be comparative studies that seek to determine white colour hybridization pathways of making high-performance tandem structures. For instance, while perovskite-based QDs can provide very high colour purity luminescence with FWHM around 20 nm, CIGS-based QDs usually generate broad PL emission, which means by hybridization of green and blue perovskite-based QDs with red CIGS-based QDs, it is possible to accomplish successful colour rendition of illumination together with an excellent spectral overlap between the responsivity of the human eye and the emission spectrum of the WQLED. Additionally, high quantum efficiency blue-emitting multi-shelled InP-based and ZnSeTe QDs have recently enabled high-performance blue QLEDs, which can be alternatives to current low-efficiency perovskite-based and CIGS-based blue QDs and thus applied in tandem WQLEDs.120,156,157 Furthermore, the CIGS-based QDs are more air- and moisture-stable than the perovskite-based QDs and InP-based QDs. Therefore, covering blue and green all-inorganic perovskite-based QDs or InP-based QDs with red-emitting CIGS-based QDs in tandem may be a solution to the realisation of high CRI, proper CCT, high LE and long-time operation of WQLEDs. Meanwhile, the optimized InP/ZnSe/ZnS and carbon dots are also able to generate impressive EQE; therefore, these two types of QD materials can also be blue-emitting layers in the tandem structure.31,158
In terms of materials opportunities, ‘single particle’ type white QDs, including alloyed CIGS-based, carbon dot-based, and perovskite-based QDs can be regarded as a most promising approach for WQLED material innovation. These ‘single particle’ type WQLEDs have outstanding advantages for subsequent device fabrication since only one white emitting QD layer is involved in the final device structure, which excludes multiple colour layer deposition, phase separation, emission quenching, and colour instability issues.131,159,160 In addition, two-dimensional (2D) materials, including carbon nanosheets, graphene nanosheets and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exhibit strong emission covering the whole visible spectrum and therefore are potential white QDs or hybrid white emitter materials for WQLEDs.161–169 Although the electrical control of circularly polarized light emission in TMDC LEDs has been theoretically and experimentally reported, there are still several ongoing challenges to practical device applications such as room temperature EL polarization and mechanisms for electrically controlling circularly polarized light emission. Based on these emerging ‘single particle’ white QDs and 2D materials, it might also be possible to construct double-heterostructure LEDs by sandwiching the white QDs between two large-bandgap TMDCs with opposite doping polarity, allowing for the confinement of light and carriers simultaneously. Given the large variety of available 2D materials and white QDs in combining them, these heterostructures may not only compete as light emitters in the visible spectral SSL, but they could also trigger the development of applications in the less explored large-area flexible ambient lighting.
