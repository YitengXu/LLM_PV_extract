    AbstractThe development of new polymerization reactions is of critical importance to macromolecule science. In this critical review, we summarize the research efforts to incubate alkyne–azide click reactions into a versatile polymerization technique for the synthesis of poly(triazole)s (PTAs) with linear and hyperbranched structures. Cu(I)- and Ru(II)-catalyzed click polymerizations afforded 1,4- and 1,5-regioregular PTAs, respectively. Whereas traditional thermal cycloadditions normally generate regiorandom products, PTAs with 1,4-regioisomer contents up to 95% were created by utilizing the electronic effect involved in the thermal click polymerizations of aroylacetylenes with azides. The PTAs showed unique functional properties, such as luminescence, chromism, fluorescence imaging, emission superquenching, chain helicity, optical nonlinearity, light refractivity, photovoltaic effect, cytocompatibility and biodegradability (145 references).

1. Introduction
The exploration of new types of monomers and development of new polymerization reactions occupy a crucial position in polymer research. It is well-known that the molecular structures of monomers often determine the structures and properties of their polymers. Needless to say, without effective polymerization routes being established, monomeric species cannot be converted to polymeric products. Olefinic monomers have been the main source of building blocks for the construction of conventional polymers. The olefinic polymerizations string the monomeric units together by carbon–carbon single bonds, which are electronically saturated. Because of this structural feature, olefinic polymers are electronically inactive and have generally been used as commodity materials.
“Plastic electronics” offer an attractive vista that miniature electronic devices can be fabricated with readily processable polymers. To realize this fascinating possibility, polymers with electronic activities must be synthesized. This calls for the exploration of building blocks other than olefinic monomers. Among the various monomers searched for by researchers, alkynes have been identified as one of the versatile building blocks for the construction of electroactive polymers. Many reactions, such as addition, metathesis and cyclotrimerization, have been utilized to transform triple bonds to double bonds and aromatic rings in alkyne polymerizations.1–24 Due to their π-conjugated structures, the polymers show exotic properties that are inaccessible by olefin polymers and have found high-tech applications in electronics, optics, photonics, etc.
The main chains of the alkyne polymers, like those of the olefin polymers, are comprised of pure carbon–carbon bonds. This is in contrast to biopolymers, whose backbones usually contain heteroatoms. Proteins, for example, possess carbon–nitrogen backbones. Incorporation of heteroatoms into the backbones of alkyne polymers is expected to generate new polymers with novel structures and unique properties. For example, the polarizability, hydrophilicity, charge transfer and supramolecular interactions associated with heteroatoms may enhance the electronic and optical effects of the polymers, and endow them with biological compatibility and activities.
When an alkyne reacts with an azide through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition mechanism, a 1,2,3-triazole ring is generated. Successful utilization of this reaction for polymer synthesis will lead to the development of a new polymerization process for the preparation of poly(triazole)s (PTAs) with heteroatom-containing backbones, and to the inclusion of azides into the list of monomeric building blocks, in addition to alkynes. The alkyne–azide cycloaddition reaction was investigated by Huisgen about half a century ago: stirring a mixture of alkyne and azide at an elevated temperature (e.g., 98 °C) for a prolonged time (e.g., 18 h) produced a mixture of regiorandom triazole adducts. The discovery that the copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction proceeds in a regioselective way at a fast rate under mild conditions has significantly boosted the synthetic value of this reaction.25,26 The CuAAC is so powerful that it has been referred to as a “click reaction” and hailed as the cream of the crop of click chemistry.
The click reaction is featured with a number of remarkable advantages, including high efficiency, regioselectivity, atom economy, and tolerance to functional groups.27 Thanks to the great enthusiasm among chemists for click chemistry, the click reaction has quickly found widespread applications in a great diversity of areas, particularly in the area of bioconjugation.28–39 The utility of click reactions in the area of polymer research has also been explored. Whilst extensive studies have been done on the modifications and functionalizations of preformed polymers employing post-polymerization click reactions,40–56 a large amount of research effort has been devoted to nurture the click reaction into a new polymerization technique.
Although an attempt to use the cycloaddition of azidoalkynes to prepare PTAs was made in the 1960s,57,58 the system might not be deemed as a click polymerization, as it does not seem to meet the criteria defined by Sharpless for a click reaction. The genuine research on click polymerization was started after the discovery of CuAAC by Sharpless and Meldal in 2002. The click polymerization has now been established as an effective synthetic route to processable, regioregular and functional PTAs. In this critical review, we present an account of the research activities and accomplishments in this area of research. Alkynes and azides have been proven to be versatile building blocks for the construction of heteroatom polymers with linear and hyperbranched structures, and metal-mediated and metal-free click polymerizations have been developed for the syntheses of regioregular PTAs.59–63 Judicious structural designs and careful process optimizations have led to the generation of PTAs with tractability and functionality that are difficult to access by the polymers with pure carbon–carbon backbones, such as the regioregularity-dependant fluorescence, structure-tunable refractivity, and bioconjugation with DNAs.
2. PTAs with hyperbranched structures
2.1 Cu(I)-catalyzed polymerizations
Soon after the invention of the CuAAC reaction,25,26 polymer chemists began to explore the possibility of utilizing this click reaction to synthesize dendritic oligomers and hyperbranched polymers.64,65 In 2004, Voit et al. tried to prepare hyperbranched poly(triazole)s (hb-PTAs) by the polymerization of 3,5-bis(propargyloxy)benzyl azide (1) mediated by CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate (SA; Scheme 1).65 Unfortunately, however, a rubbery substance precipitated out from the reaction mixture, which was insoluble in organic solvents. Furthermore, 1 is an AB2-monomer that is difficult to prepare and prone to self-oligomerization during storage due to the coexistence of two mutually reactive functional groups (A and B) in one molecule. Although imperfect, this work is the first attempt in the area of research on click polymerization.

The area remained silent afterward mainly due to the hard-to-tackle problem of insolubility of the polymeric products. In 2008, Katritzky et al. tried to prepare hb-PTAs through an A2 + B3 approach.66 The advantage of this strategy is that the monomers can be made with ease and can be stored for a long period of time, thus circumventing the problems encountered by the AB2 system. The polymerization was carried out using bispropiolate derivative 2 and triazide 3 as monomers in the presence of CuSO4/SA in an aqueous medium (Scheme 2). Disappointingly, however, the obtained polymer products were still insoluble.
 Scheme 2  Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization of dipropiolates 2 and triazide 3. 
Our research groups have been interested in the exploration of alkyne polymerizations, in an effort to develop alkynes into a group of versatile building blocks for the construction of new polymers with linear and hyperbranched structures, and advanced functional properties.6–11 Because alkynes play an indispensible role in click chemistry, we naturally expanded our research program into the territory of alkyne–azide click polymerization and embarked on the syntheses of hb-PTAs from 2007.67 We took an A2 + B3 approach and used easy-to-prepare diazides 4 and triyne 5 as monomers (Scheme 3). The monomers are very stable, with no structural changes detected after they have been stored at ambient temperature in a dark place for more than two years.
 Scheme 3  Syntheses of 1,4- and 1,5-regioregular hb-PTAs 6 and 7 by Cu- and Ru-catalyzed click polymerizations of A2 + B3 monomers, respectively. Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene. 
We first tried the click polymerizations of the monomers under the typical Sharpless conditions. Mixing diazides 4 and triyne 5 in the presence of CuSO4/SA in a mixture of water and tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a volume ratio of 1:5 led to immediate formation of precipitates. Although the obtained hb-PTAs could be dissolved in highly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), they are insoluble in such common solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM) and THF. This indicates that the “standard recipe” for the CuAAC reaction is not suitable for the synthesis of processable hb-PTAs.
The poor solubility is probably due to the incompatibility of the growing hb-PTA species with the aqueous reaction medium, which causes the reaction products to agglomerate or precipitate during the polymerization process. To avoid using an aqueous medium, we prepared an organosoluble catalyst of Cu(PPh3)3Br by refluxing CuBr and PPh3 in chloroform, and employed it to mediate the click polymerizations of 4 and 5. Delightfully, the reactions proceeded smoothly in DMF at 60 °C, giving 1,4-regioregular hb-PTAs 6 with good solubility in common organic solvents. The solutions of the polymers in DMSO-d6 showed well-resolved and fine-structured 1H NMR spectra, which enabled detailed structural characterizations of the polymerization products.
Almost at the same time, a similar approach was taken by Shi and coworkers: they minimized the amount of water used in the solvent mixture in their synthesis of hb-PTA 10, with nonlinear optical (NLO) activity, from the A2 + B3 monomers (Scheme 4).68,69 The site-isolation effect offered by the three-dimensionally (3D) branched molecular structure of an hb-PTA was anticipated to enhance its NLO activity. The PTA was prepared by the slow addition of a DMF solution of diazide 8 into triyne 9, in a DMF–water mixture containing a small amount of water at room temperature, in the presence of CuSO4/SA. After 24 h reaction, polymer 10 with a moderate molecular weight was obtained in a satisfactory yield. The hb-PTA was soluble in cyclopentanone, cylcohexanone, DMF and DMSO.

Li et al. reported the syntheses of NLO PTAs 13 from AB2 monomers 11 in 2009.70 They elaborately synthesized 11 by azo coupling reactions at 0 °C, which helped to lower the reactivity of the azido and ethynyl groups and to reduce the likelihood of self-oligomerization of the monomers during their preparation. The AB2 monomers were fairly stable and could be kept under ambient conditions for nearly one month. The monomers were click polymerized in the presence of a mixture of CuSO4 and SA in a DMF–water (20:1 v/v) mixture, followed by the end-capping with monoyne 12 (Scheme 5). Thanks to the end-capping modification, the obtained PTAs had good processability. The success of Li and coworkers in the preparation of soluble hb-PTAs was ascribed to the use of a minimal amount of water in the polymerization reaction, in nice agreement with our early observation (vide ut supra).

2.2 Ru(II)-catalyzed polymerizations
Most alkyne–azide click reactions have been mediated by copper(I) catalysts, which generate 1,4-disubstituted triazoles. Synthesis of 1,5-disubstituted triazoles is of interest because different regioisomers may exhibit different properties, thus providing a platform for investigating their structure–property relationships. In 2005, Jia et al. reported that the ruthenium(II) complex Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl (Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene) catalyzed a 1,5-regioselective click reaction, giving 1,5-disubstituted triazoles in high yields under mild reaction conditions.59 The Ru(II)-mediated click reaction worked for not only terminal but also internal alkynes, thereby broadening the scope of alkyne reactants and the area of research on click chemistry.59,60
Since Jia et al.’s discovery, several research groups have worked on the exploration of new ruthenium catalysts. In addition to Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl, other ruthenium complexes, such as Cp*RuCl(nbd) (nbd = 2,5-norbornadiene), Cp*RuCl(cod) (cod = 1,5-cylcooctadiene), [Cp*RuCl2]2 and [Cp*RuCl2]4, have been found to be effective, regioselective catalysts for click reactions.59–63 We worked on the utilization of the Ru catalysts for the development of 1,5-regioselective alkyne–azide click polymerizations.67 Employing Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl as catalyst, we tried to polymerize 4 and 5 in THF (Scheme 3). The reactions proceeded well, giving soluble 1,5-regioregular hb-PTAs 7 in good yields in as short as 30 min.
The preparation of the Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl complex, however, is not a trivial task and requires high synthetic skill. Dichlor-(1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium oligomer, i.e., [Cp*RuCl2]n, is a precursor to Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl, and can be readily prepared in high yield by simply refluxing an ethanol solution of RuCl3·nH2O and Cp*H for a few hours. We examined whether this precursor could work as a catalyst for click polymerization and found that it catalyzed the click polymerization of 4 and 5 at a moderate temperature (40 °C), furnishing soluble 1,5-regioregular hb-PTAs 7 in high yields (>83%) in 2 h. The results are exciting, because the ready synthetic accessibility of the catalyst is certainly an advantage that will help to populate its utility in the syntheses of new PTAs.
3. PTAs with linear structures
3.1 Cu(I)-catalyzed polymerizations

3.1.1 Syntheses of photonically active PTAs. 
About one year after Voit’s attempt on hb-PTA synthesis,65 researchers commenced preparing linear PTAs using the click polymerization technique. The first report along the line was on the synthesis of fluorene-containing conjugated PTAs.71 The fluorene ring is a well-known monomeric building block for the construction of π-conjugated light-emitting polymers such as polyfluorene. The triazole ring is electron deficient, and PTAs are thus expected to show electron-transport properties. Combination of the fluorene and triazole units in a single macromolecular chain is envisaged to create new polymeric materials with unique optoelectronic activities.
Reek et al. prepared π-conjugated linear PTAs by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerizations of 2,7-diazidofluorenes 14 and 15 and aromatic diynes 18–20 (Scheme 6 and Table 1).71 The reactions were carried out in a degassed THF–acetonitrile (9:1 v/v) mixture using Cu/Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst and tris-(benzyltriazoyl)amine as ligand. An only partially soluble product was obtained from the polymerization of 14 and 18. When the alkyl chain was lengthened from hexyl in 14 to dodecyl in 15, soluble polymer 27 with a high molecular weight was obtained (Table 1, entry 2). PTAs 28–30 were prepared using similar synthetic procedures, followed by capping the chain ends with azidobenzene and 2-ethynylpyridine. The molecular weight of the polymer obtained from the click polymerization of 15 and 18, conducted at −10 °C for 65 h, was higher than that of the polymer obtained at 25 °C for 170 h, suggestive of an exothermic nature of the click polymerization reaction.

In 2006, Bunz et al. prepared conjugated PTAs from 2,7-diazidofluorenes (15 and 16), 4,4′-diazidobiphenyl (38) and 2,5-dialkyl-1,4-diethynylbenzenes (21 and 22) in the presence of CuSO4/SA at room temperature (Schemes 6 and 7 and Table 1).72 The linear polymers were obtained after 10 days reaction in high yields, but their molecular weights were only moderate (<10000) due to the limited solubilities of the PTAs in the reaction mixtures. The polymer obtained from the click polymerization of 16 and 21 was even insoluble, although the polymers with branched (22) or long (15) alkyl chains were readily dissolved in chloroform and DCM.
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of PTA 39 by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization of diazide 38 and diyne 22 in THF. 
In 2008, the team led by Lee and Jin prepared conjugated PTAs for solar cell applications.73,74 2,7-Diazidofluorene 17 and diynes containing fluorene (23 and 26), benzothiadiazole (24) and carbazole (25) moieties were subjected to the click polymerizations at 30–35 °C in THF in the presence of CuSO4/SA/triethylamine (TEA) for 48 h (Table 1). PTAs with moderate molecular weights were obtained in high yields. The polymers were soluble in many organic solvents, including chlorobenzene, chloroform, THF, toluene and xylene. The TEA ligand was found to play an important role in the click polymerizations. Without TEA, the polymerization did not proceed even after the reaction mixtures had been stirred at room temperature for 10 days.
Polymers intended for optical and photonic applications must be extremely pure, because the impurities can serve as charge traps to diminish the optical and photonic effects. To make the polymers pure enough for the evaluation of solar cell performances, the PTAs prepared by the team of Lee and Jin were thoroughly purified by multiple Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The thus purified PTAs showed small polydispersity indices (PDIs) and were used as polymer matrices for the fabrication of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The detailed performance data of the devices will be discussed in Section 4 of this review article.
The Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization was also used to synthesize linear PTAs with NLO activities. To compare with the NLO effect of hb-PTA 10 (Scheme 4), Shi et al. prepared its linear congener 41 under similar conditions from 8 and 1,4-bis(propargyloxy)benzene 40 (Scheme 8).69 Polymer 41 was obtained in moderate yield, but its molecular weight (13400) was higher than that of 10 (7400). The solubility of the linear polymer was poorer than that of its hyperbranched counterpart. It dissolved in dimethylacetamide (DMAc), DMF and DMSO but was only partially soluble in cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, probably due to the stronger interactions between the linear PTA chains.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of nonlinear optically active chromophore-containing PTA 41 by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization of diazide 8 and diyne 40 in DMF. 
In addition to the Cu(I) species generated in situ from the CuSO4/SA mixture, other Cu(I) compounds have also been employed as catalysts to mediate click polymerizations. In 2008, Michinobu et al. reported a biomass-based PTA (44), which was prepared by the CuBr-catalyzed click polymerization of 42 and 43 (Scheme 9).75 The pseudoaromatic ring, 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC), is a metabolic product of lignin, which shows such unique properties as solvatochromic light emission, facile sublimation under laboratory conditions, and strong affinity to metal ions. Stirring a mixture of 42 with 43 in degassed DMF in the presence of CuBr at 20 °C for 70 h resulted in the formation of 44 with a high weight-average molecular weight (Mw > 106). Such a high Mw is difficult to achieve by a polycondensation reaction. PTA 44 is soluble in the polar solvents DMF and DMSO, sparsely soluble in THF, but insoluble in other organic solvents. It is fluorescent, with a Stokes shift much larger than that of PDC.
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of PDC-containing PTA 44 by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization of diyne 42 and diazide 43, where PDC = 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid. 
We also utilized the Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerization to synthesize optoelectronic PTAs.76 Tetraphenylethene (TPE) is a luminogen that shows the unique phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission (AIE): it is non-emissive in dilute solutions, but is induced to emit efficiently by aggregate formation.77–81 Attracted by its facile synthesis, ready functionalization and high quantum yield in the solid state, we tried to prepare AIE-active PTAs 47 and 48 with the TPE units embedded in their main chains by click polymerization (Scheme 10). We first attempted to polymerize 40 and 45 under typical click reaction conditions. Although the monomers can be polymerized by CuSO4/SA in a THF–water mixture, the resultant polymer was insoluble (Table 2), possibly due to the low solvating power of the aqueous mixture to the PTA chains.

We then tried the click polymerizations in organic media using the organosoluble catalyst Cu(PPh3)3Br. Delightfully, the polymerization of 40 and 45 in THF at 60 °C for 12 h gave a soluble PTA (47) with a high molecular weight in a high yield. The click polymerization of 40 and 46 carried out under similar conditions gave an insoluble product, probably due to the higher reactivity of 46 than that of 45. Shortening the reaction time to 2.5 h enabled the synthesis of soluble PTA 48 in a high yield. While 47 was soluble in chloroform, THF and DMF, its congener with a shorter alkyl spacer (48) dissolved completely in polar solvents but only partially in THF.


3.1.2 Syntheses of thermally stable PTAs. 
The triazole ring is thermally stable, and PTAs are thus expected to show high resistance to thermolysis. Qing et al. synthesized thermally stable PTAs using click polymerization.82,83Scheme 11 depicts the synthetic route to a polymer functionalized by perfluorocyclobutane (PFCB; 51). When the polymerization of 49 and 50 was carried out in isobutanol–water, acetonitrile–water or THF–water mixtures (1:1 v/v) in the presence of CuSO4/SA for 24 h at room temperature, the products were obtained in poor yields. When the reaction was conducted in an acetonitrile–water mixture with a volume ratio of 1:2 using CuI as the catalyst, an emulsion was obtained after removal of acetonitrile. Further drying of the product resulted in an extremely low yield of polymer.

The problem of low polymer yield was solved by adding TEA ligand into the polymerization mixture. PFCB-containing PTA 51 with high molecular weights (up to 25600) were obtained in good yields (65–75%) when the polymerizations of 49 and 50 were catalyzed by CuSO4/SA/TEA in a mixture of isobutanol–water (1:1 v/v) for 10–12 h at 80 °C. The obtained PTAs were thermally very stable, with no crystal and glass transitions detected when the polymers were heated to a temperature as high as 410 °C.
Nagao and Takasu prepared thermally stable “click polyesters” by CuBr-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition polymerizations.84 Ester-containing diynes and diazidoalkanes were polymerized in the presence of CuBr in DMF at 50 °C, producing PTAs with high molecular weights in excellent yields (85–90%) after 30–48 h reactions. Scheme 12 presents some examples of the click polymerizations. When diazidobutane 54 was polymerized with a symmetric diyne 52, an insoluble product was formed. When a methyl group was introduced to the diyne to break the structural symmetry, the resultant PTA (55) became soluble. The PTAs were thermally more stable than their monomers.

Benzoxazine can undergo thermal ring-opening reactions.85 Poly(benzoxazine)s enjoy such advantages as practically zero shrinkage after thermal curing, high char yield and low water adsorption. Normally, the polymers were synthesized by polycondensations, but the their molecular weights were often low (<104) due to the involved branching and side reactions. Ishida et al. applied the CuI-catalyzed click polymerization to the preparations of benzoxazine-containing PTAs with high molecular weights (>105).86
An example of this reaction is shown in Scheme 13. The click polymerization of diyne 56 and diazide 57 was carried out in a DMF–pyridine (4:1 v/v) mixture in the presence of CuI at room temperature for 16 h. A benzoxazine-containing PTA (58) with a molecular weight as high as 106 was obtained. The polymer was thermally cross-linkable, as revealed by the differential scanning calorimetry measurement. It showed a clear peak associated with the thermal cross-linking reaction, with onset and maximum temperatures of 182 and 242 °C, respectively. Thermogravimetric measurement of the polymer revealed that its char yield was 51% after pyrolysis, due to the high cross-linking density in the PTA.

Drockenmuller et al. demonstrated that linear PTAs with varying compositions could be prepared by step growth click polymerization of α-azide-ω-alkynes.87 As shown in Scheme 14, monomers 59–61 were homo- and copolymerized using Cu(PPh3)3Br as the catalyst and N,N-diisopropylethylamine as the ligand in chloroform, furnishing homo- or co-PTAs 62 with satisfactory molecular weights. The authors showed that the solubility and stability of the polymers could be modulated by changing the compositions of their repeat units.

3.1.3 Syntheses of biologically compatible PTAs. 
The click polymerization is a powerful tool for synthesizing biomaterials, because both the reactants (alkynes and azides) and product (triazole) of the click reaction are biocompatible. Reineke and coworkers showed that the Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerizations of trehalose-functionalized diazide 63 and bispropiolamides 64 (Scheme 15) were an effective route to cytocompatible glycopolymers for biomedical applications, such as cellular delivery of nucleic acids.88 The structures of the PTAs were designed according to the following rationale. Trehalose is well-known for its unique properties as cryo- and lyoprotectants, as it prevents aggregation, fusion and lysis of lipid membranes and proteins. Bispropiolamides, on the other hand, are expected to aid DNA encapsulation and polyanion neutralization and to promote cell surface interactions of the polyplexes with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans.
 Scheme 15  Syntheses of trehalose-containing PTAs 65 by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerizations of diazide 63 and diynes 64. 
As shown in Scheme 15, the trehalose-containing diazide and bispropiolamide monomers were click polymerized in a t-butanol–water mixture containing CuSO4/SA at 50 °C for 4–24 h. Water-soluble linear PTAs 65 with high molecular weights were obtained after cleavage of the acetyl and t-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups. Polymer 65 could form exceptionally stable polyplexes with DNA that do not dissociate in the presence of salt, serum and cellular proteins.
Peptide-based polymers have attracted much interest in the past decades, because their primary structures allow specific cleavage by endogenous proteases. The synthesis of polymers with peptide backbones, however, remains a challenge. Hennink, Liskamp and coworkers prepared such polymers by CuOAc-catalyzed click polymerization with the aid of microwave irradiation.89,90 The triazole rings formed during the click reaction are similar to the native peptide bond in terms of distance and planarity. The researchers synthesized AB-type monomers 66 and 68 with the consideration that the resultant PTAs are soluble in water and contain units recognizable by proteases. As shown in Scheme 16, 66 and 68 contain lysine and phenylalanine moieties: the former and latter are recognition units by trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. Furthermore, 68 has an ester bond that can be cleaved by chemical hydrolysis.
 Scheme 16  Syntheses of biodegradable peptide-containing PTAs 67 and 69 by microwave-assisted, Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerizations of AB-type monomers 66 and 68, respectively. 
PTAs 67 and 69 were prepared from monomers 66 and 68 in degassed DMF by microwave-assisted, CuOAc-catalyzed click polymerizations at 100 °C for 30 min. The molecular weights of the PTAs were found to be dependent on monomer concentration: while oligomers were formed at low monomer concentrations, polymers with high molecular weights were obtained at high monomer concentrations. The polymers were biodegradable in the presence of chymotrypsin and trypsin proteases. The microwave-assisted click polymerization thus offers a convenient synthetic route to biomedical polymers.


3.1.4 Syntheses of PTAs from macromonomers. 
All of the PTAs discussed above were synthesized from low molecular weight monomers. In 2005, Matyjaszewski et al. took a novel synthetic approach to PTAs and conducted click polymerizations of macromonomers prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of olefinic monomers.91,92 Macromonomers 70 (Mw = 2850) and 72 (2200) were prepared from bromo-terminated oligostyrenes, which were synthesized by ATRP using CuBr and pentamethyldiethylenetriamine as the catalyst and propargyl 2-bromoisobutyrate or dimethyl 2,6-dibromoheptadioate as the initiator.
Macromonomer 70 was click polymerized in the presence of CuBr in DMF at room temperature under nitrogen for 89 h, producing PTA 71 with an Mw of 104300 (Scheme 17). PTA 74 was prepared using similar synthetic procedures. After 40 h reaction, 74 with an Mw of 55800 was obtained from diazide macromonomer 72 and propargyl ether 73. Studies of the ligand effects on the click polymerizations revealed that aliphatic amines greatly enhanced the polymerization rate compared to pyridine-based ligands, whilst tridentate ligands offered faster reaction rates relative to the tetradentate ones.
 Scheme 17  Syntheses of linear PTAs 71 and 74 by CuBr-catalyzed click polymerizations of macromonomers 70 and 72, respectively. 
Chow et al. reported the synthesis of dendronized PTA 76 by the polymerization of AB-type macromonomer 75.93 The dendronized macromonomers with 1–3 generations (G1–G3) were polymerized in the presence of CuSO4/SA in a mixture of THF, DMF and water (1:1:1 by vol.) at 25 °C for 4 days, affording dendronized PTAs 76 with high molecular weights (Scheme 18). Among the PTAs, only the polymer containing the G2 dendritic units formed organogels due to the “right” distance between the dendronized polymer chains, as well as its appropriate size to accommodate the solvent molecules.
 Scheme 18  Syntheses of dendronized PTAs 76 by Cu(I)-catalyzed click polymerizations of AB-type macromonomers 75; Gm denotes the number of generation of the dendron unit (m = 1–3). 
Click polymerization was combined with self-assembly to synthesize block copolymers from macromonomers (Scheme 19).94 Zhu and coworkers first prepared diyne (77) and diazide (78) macromonomers containing PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO triblock copolymer chains, where PEO and PPO denote poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide), respectively. Equal molar amounts of 77 and 78 were mixed in water and stirred at 0 °C for 8 h, and then 25 °C for another 8 h. This induced 77 and 78 to self-assemble into core-shell micelles with PPO and PEO blocks as cores and shells, respectively. Click polymerizations were initiated by adding CuSO4/SA into the micelles. After 24 h reaction, multiblock copolymer 79 was obtained in a good yield, whose Mw was 5-fold higher than those of the starting macromonomers.

3.1.5 Syntheses of PTAs with well-defined conformations. 
The click polymerization was employed to create PTAs with well-defined chain conformations through the sensible design of monomer structures. An example was the synthesis of helical PTAs reported by Hecht et al.95,96 The click polymerizations of 3,5-diazidobenzoate (80) and 2,6-diethynylpyridines (81 and 82) were mediated by a mixture of Cu(CH3CN)4PF6, Cu and dimethylethylenediamine in acetonitrile (Scheme 20). The PTAs were end-capped successively by 1-azido-4-toluene and 1-ethynyl-4-toluene. Helical PTAs 85 and 86 with Mw of 1600–5300 and PDI of 1.5–2.3 were successfully obtained. The polymers served as ligands for various metal ions, such as Zn2+, Fe2+ and Eu3+, and formed metal-containing gels due to the chelating of the 2,6-bis(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine unit.

Poly(pseudorotaxane)s with long polymer chains threading through cyclic beads have been widely used as components for the generation of functional supramolecular materials and the construction of “molecular machines”. Steinke, Tuncle and coworkers designed and prepared poly(pseudorotaxane)s containing cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) rings by cycloaddition of ionized azides and alkynes, but long reaction times were often needed even at elevated temperatures.97–99 Yui and coworkers, however, prepared poly(pseudorotaxane) 89, with CB[7] and 2,6-(o-dimethyl)-β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) rings strung together by a PTA chain, via click polymerization in a much shorter time (Scheme 21).100 Pseudorotaxane monomers of CB[7]/N,N′-[1,3-phenylene-bis(methylene)]-2-dipropyn-1-aminium 87 and β-CD/α,ω-bisazidooligo(propylene glycol) (OPG) 88 were polymerized in water at pH 5 in the presence of CuSO4/SA. The reaction mixture was vigorously shaken and heated with microwave irradiation for 30 min, furnishing PTA 89 with m/z in the range of 2368–24444, as measured by MALDI-TOF. The resultant poly(pseudorotaxane) was soluble in water at pH 11, retaining the CB and CD beads in the PTA chain without dethreading. The CB bead moved to the block of the OPG chain due to the deprotonation of the ammonium units, showing a pH-responsive movement in the supramolecular machine.

3.2 Metal-free polymerizations
The click polymerization reactions discussed so far have all been mediated by metallic catalysts. One potential problem for a metal-mediated polymerization is that catalyst residue is difficult to completely remove from the polymer product. The metallic residue is detrimental to the electronic and optical properties of polymeric materials. Luminescence of a polymer, for example, can be quenched or weakened by the metal traps. Organometallic catalysts such as organoruthenium complexes are cytotoxic, expensive and difficult to prepare.101,102 The development of non-metallic or metal-free polymerizations is thus highly desirable. For a metal-free system to be qualified as a click polymerization, it must meet the definition for a click reaction: high regioselectivity, good yield, mild reaction conditions, etc. The well-known thermal cycloaddition between alkynes and azides does not meet the criteria: for example, it is a regiorandom reaction and generates triazole products with a roughly equal ratio of 1,4- and 1,5-isomers.
In the past decade, our groups have been working on the development of new polymerization reactions for acetylenic monomers.6–11 During the course of research, we have found that propiolates and aroylacetylenes are more reactive than “normal” acetylene derivatives, due to the electron-withdrawing effect of their carbonyl groups. For example, bispropiolate and bis(aroylacetylene) monomers can be polycyclotrimerized in a regioselective manner in the presence of a secondary amine or in refluxing DMF.103–108 It is thus envisaged that the reactions between propiolates or aroylacetylenes and azides can be fast and regioselective, thus satisfying the requirements for a click reaction.
In 2008, Katritzky and coworkers attempted cycloaddition polymerizations of bispropiolates 90 with diazide 91 in the absence of metallic catalysts (Scheme 22). Polymers 93 were obtained after the reaction mixture had been stirred for 6–7 days at room temperature.66 If the polymerization reactions were conducted at elevated temperatures, i.e., 50–60 °C, PTAs 94 were obtained in 4–48 h from monomers 90 and 92. The obtained polymers had moderate molecular weights but their regioregularities were unknown.
 Scheme 22  1,3-Dipolar polycycloadditions of dipropiolates 90 with diazides 91 and 92. 
We initiated a systematic investigation of metal-free click polymerizations from 2006.109,110 We ran a metal-free model reaction of benzoylacetylene with benzyl azide and found that it furnished the expected triazole, but not the cyclotrimerization product. Encouraged by the result, we further studied the effect of solvent on the metal-free reaction and found that the triazole products with fractions of 1,4-isomers (F1,4) higher than 90% were obtained when the reactions were conducted in DMF, DMSO, DMAc and their mixtures with other solvents. These products are distinctly different from those of Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, which are regiorandom mixtures with F1,4 of ∼50%.111 The aroylacetylene–azide cycloaddition is featured with high yield, good regioselectivity, fast reaction and mild conditions, and can thus be referred to as a “click reaction”.
We tried to utilize the metal-free aroylacetylene–azide click reaction to prepare poly(aroyltriazole)s (PATAs), a subgroup of PTAs (Scheme 23). We first tested the click polymerization of diazide 97 and bis(aroylacetylene) 98. Delightfully, PATA 104 with a high molecular weight (Mw ∼ 19000) was obtained in a high yield (84%) in a short time (6 h) at a moderate temperature (100 °C; Table 3). The polymer was completely soluble in common organic solvents, enabling its structural characterization by “wet” spectroscopic methods. The analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that 104 possessed a high regioregularity, with an F1,4 of 89%.

We continued our study in the area. We were particularly interested in the syntheses of PATAs with unique optical and electronic properties. To that end, functionalized azides and aroylacetylenes were designed and prepared. For example, a triphenylamine group was introduced into bis(aroylacetylene) 99, while TPE luminogen was incorporated into diazides 45, 46 and 100, which were expected to impart new photophysical properties to the polymers. The functionalized monomer pairs were subjected to metal-free polymerizations and the results are given in Table 3. All of the click polymerizations propagated smoothly under the optimized reaction conditions, furnishing PATAs with high molecular weights (Mw up to 26700) and regioregularities (F1,4 up to ∼95%) in high yields (up to 95%).
4. Functional properties
Thanks to the successful development of various alkyne–azide click polymerization systems, a large number of linear and hyperbranched PTAs has been generated. In this section, we discuss their functional properties, such as photoluminescence (PL), chemosensing, fluorescent imaging, photonic patterning, optical nonlinearity, photovoltaic effect, light refractivity, and biological activity.
4.1 Aggregation-induced emission
Reek et al. observed that fluorene-containing PTAs 27–30 were highly emissive in THF with PL peaks located at 360–380 nm.71 Among the PTAs, 30 showed the highest quantum yield (ΦF = 55%). The solutions of linear PTAs containing fluorene and biphenyl units prepared by Bunz et al. emitted blue light.72 The highest ΦF (48%) was achieved with PTAs 33 and 39. Interestingly, the PL peaks of the PTAs were red-shifted upon addition of acid, showing a novel acidichromic effect. Fig. 1 shows the PL spectra of PTA 32 before and after protonation. The emissions of 32 in chloroform and methanol are narrow and structured due to its well-defined excited state. The protonation of its triazole rings at the 3-position by HCl or TFA bathochromically shifts its emission to ∼430 nm and broadens its PL spectrum, due to the acid-caused perturbation to its excited state.

One problem associated with the light emissions of the fluorene-containing PTAs was that they were non-emissive in the solid state, although they were highly luminescent in the solution state.72 This implies that the polymer emissions are quenched by chromophore aggregation in the solid state; in other words, the polymers suffer from the notorious effect of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) of light emission. If the PTAs are to be used as light emitters, this problem must be solved, because luminophores are commonly utilized as solid films in real-world technological applications.112–116
In 2001, we discovered a photophysical phenomenon that was exactly opposite to the ACQ effect discussed above, viz., aggregation-induced emission (AIE).117–125 We found that a variety of propeller-shaped molecules, such as TPE, were non-emissive in their dilute solutions but became luminescent when they were aggregated. The AIE effect was rationalized to be caused by the restriction of the intramolecular rotations (RIR) in the propeller-shaped luminogenic molecules by the aggregate formation in the solid state.116,126–129
We explored the possibility of preparing AIE polymers by taking advantage of the AIE effect and click polymerization.76,110 TPE-containing PTAs (47 and 48) and PATAs (107, 108 and 109) were synthesized by Cu(PPh3)3Br-catalyzed and metal-free click polymerizations, respectively, in high yields. Fig. 2 shows the PL spectra of PTA 47 in the THF–water mixtures with different water contents. The polymer is virtually non-luminescent in the THF solution and its PL spectrum is almost a flat line parallel to the abscissa. When large amounts of water (>60 vol%) are added into THF, strong emission is recorded under identical measurement conditions, due to the activation of the RIR process by aggregate formation.
 Fig. 2  (a) PL spectra of 47 in the THF–water mixtures containing different water fractions (fw). (b) Variations in the quantum yields of 47 and 48 with water fractions in the aqueous mixtures (THF–water for 47; DMF–water for 48). Reproduced with permission from ref. 76. Copyright 2009, American Chemical Society. 
The changes in the emission efficiencies of the polymers in the aqueous mixtures with different water contents further verify their AIE attributes. Two examples are given in Fig. 2(b): both 47 and 48 show negligibly small ΦF values (0.16–0.18%) in their THF solutions. The ΦF value of 47 remains almost unchanged until ∼50% water is added into THF, while that of 48 commences to increase at a lower water fraction (10%) due to its lower solubility in the aqueous mixture. The highest ΦF values of 47 and 48 are recorded at 90% water content, which are respectively 94- and 110-fold higher than those of the polymers in their THF solutions. Similar phenomena were observed for polymers 107–109: their THF solutions are non-emissive but their aggregates in the aqueous mixtures with high water contents emit efficiently.
4.2 Luminescence superquenching by explosives
The strong emissions of the aggregates of polymers 47, 48 and 107–109 make them promising candidates for chemosensor applications. Nitroaromatics such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol or picric acid (PA) are warfare explosives, and their sensitive detection is of antiterrorism implications.130,131 Due to its commercial availability, PA was chosen as a model explosive to study the sensing performances of the AIE polymers. The data for 47 are discussed below as an example. Fig. 3(a) shows the results of the nanoaggregates of 47 suspended in a 90% aqueous mixture as a chemosensor for PA detection. Progressive addition of PA to the nanoaggregates leads to a gradual decrease in the PL intensity. The emission quenching is sensitive and can be clearly discerned at a PA concentration as low as 0.1 μg mL−1, or about 0.1 ppm.
 Fig. 3  (a) PL spectra of 47 in a THF–water mixture (1:9 v/v) containing different amounts of picric acid (PA). (b) Plot of I0/I−1 vs. concentration of PA; I and I0 are the peak intensities in the presence and absence of PA, respectively. Inset: chemical structure of PA, and fluorescence images of 47 adsorbed in the filter papers (i) before and (ii) after being partially dipped into a toluene solution of PA (50 μg mL−1). Reproduced with permission from ref. 76. Copyright 2009, American Chemical Society. 
When the PA concentration is ≤50 μM, the Stern–Volmer plot of the nanoaggregates of 47 is a linear line [Fig. 3(b)]. Fitting of the data in the low PA concentration region gives a quenching constant of 98720 M−1 with an R2 value as high as 0.988. Interestingly, when the PA concentration is increased to beyond 50 μM, the emission quenching curve deviates from linearity and bends upward. In other words, a higher explosive concentration leads to a higher quenching efficiency. Clearly, a novel superamplification effect is involved in the process of emission quenching by the explosive.
The emission spectrum of 47 overlaps with the absorption spectrum of PA in the wavelength region of ∼385–485 nm, which enables energy transfer from the excited state of the polymer to the ground state of the quencher. In other words, the light emitted from 47 is absorbed by PA. Due to the AIE nature of 47, the emission of its nanoaggregates suspended in the aqueous medium is strong and can be sensitively quenched by PA. The polymer nanoaggregates in the THF–water mixture contain many cavities or voids, which can accommodate many PA molecules. Inside the PTA nanoaggregates, one quencher molecule can interact with multiple luminogenic units in the polymer chains, thus causing the observed amplification effect of emission quenching.
The explosive detection by PTA 47 can be realized not only under the “wet” conditions but also in a “dry” setting. As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 3(b), the polymers adsorbed by a filter paper show strong PL upon photoexcitation. The emission is greatly attenuated after the paper strip has been dipped into a toluene solution of PA. This demonstrates a prototype device based on an AIE polymer for the real-world sensing of explosives.
4.3 Patterned fluorescence imaging
PATAs 107–109 contain many benzoyltriazole units, which are structurally similar to benzophenone, a well-known photo-sensitive group.103,132 The PATAs are thus anticipated to be photoresponsive. Indeed, UV irradiation of a thin solid film of 107, cast on a silica wafer substrate, through a copper negative photomask for 1 min readily bleached the exposed area, while the unexposed area remained luminescent, thereby generating a two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence image without going through a development process [Fig. 4(a)].133,134 When a photoirradiated thin film of the polymer was developed using an appropriate solvent, a well-resolved 3D photoresist pattern was fabricated [Fig. 4(b)]. The radical species created by the photolysis of the benzoyltriazole moieties might have been responsible for the quenching of the polymer emission and for the formation of the cross-linking networks.

Like the linear PATAs discussed above, hb-PTAs 6 and 7 were also photo-cross-linkable and could be used to create fluorescence patterns.67 The photo-cross-linking may be due to the coupling or combination reactions of the nitrene and methylene radicals, which are generated by the photoinduced denitrogenation of the azide groups on the peripheries of the hb-PTAs.135,136 For the purpose of comparison, their regio-random cousins 110a and 110b were synthesized by thermally activated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar polycycloaddition of diazides 4 and triyne 5 in refluxing dioxane for 72 h. The structures of the regiorandom hb-PTAs are shown in Fig. 5.

When thin films of hb-PTAs 6, 7 and 110 were irradiated with a UV light for 5 min through a photomask, the exposed regions were readily cross-linked and became insoluble. 3D photoresist patterns with high resolutions, as evidenced by the sharp line edges and uniform film thickness, were generated after development. Fig. 6(a) shows a photograph of the pattern formed by hb-PTA 110a taken under normal room lighting. Interestingly, the patterned lines emit a white light when observed under a fluorescence microscope with UV excitation [Fig. 6(b)], whereas the emission colors from the patterns generated from regioregular 6a and 7a are yellow and blue, respectively, although the colors shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 6 were somewhat distorted by the photographing process. Similar phenomena were observed for the patterns generated by the photolyses of hb-PTAs 110b, 6b and 7b.

The variation in the emission colors of the photopatterns of PTAs 6, 7 and 110 stems from the difference in their photo-physical properties. Fig. 7 shows the absorption and emission spectra of PTAs 6b, 7b and 110b as examples. The absorption spectra of 6b and 7b in DCM solutions peak at 343 nm and 334 nm, respectively, because the 1,4-isomeric unit in 6b is conformationally more planar, and thus, electronically more conjugated than the 1,5-isomeric units in 7b. As expected, the absorption peak of 110b (338 nm) is located in between those of its regioregular cousins, because the regiorandom polymer contains about 50% of the 1,4- and 1,5-regioisomeric units.

The PL spectra of DCM solutions of the PTAs peak in the wavelength region of 409–416 nm. The spectrum of the film of 6b is red-shifted and broadened, in comparison to that of its solution [Fig. 7(a)]. Its full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) is 133 nm, which is more than 2-fold wider than that of the solution. Due to the steric congestion, 7b shows little change in the fwhm between its solution and film spectra. The film of 110b shows the broadest spectrum, with an fwhm as wide as 155 nm, because it contains almost equal amounts of 1,4- and 1,5-regioisomeric units. This offers an attractive way to tune the color of film emission of a polymer by simply changing its regiostructure, without going through the trouble of designing and synthesizing an entirely new polymer with a completely different chemical structure.
4.4 Optical nonlinearity
Shi et al. studied the NLO activity of hb-PTA 10 and compared it with that of its linear counterpart 41.69 The hb-PTA showed a second-harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient (d33) of 96.8 pm V−1, which is 4.1-fold higher than that of its linear cousin. This indicates that the 3D globular structure of the hb-PTA has enabled better spatial isolation of the NLO chromophores, and hence endowed the polymer with a higher NLO effect.137 Depoling experiments were conducted by monitoring the real-time decays of the corona-poled polymer films when they were heated from 30 to 200 °C without applying an electric field. It was found that the onset decay temperature for 10 was 165 °C, much higher than that for 41 (123 °C; Fig. 8). This further proves that the hyperbranched polymers are superior to their linear congeners as NLO materials.

Li et al. investigated the NLO performances of hb-PTAs 13, which were synthesized from click polymerizations of AB2-type azo-containing monomers.70 The d33 values of 13a and 13b were measured by the corona poling technique to be 77.9 and 124.4 pm V−1, respectively. The researchers ascribed the difference in the d33 values to the “isolation group” effect. Dynamic thermal orientation stabilities of the polymers were measured by depoling experiments. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the onset decay temperatures for 13a and 13b are 118 and 93 °C, respectively, indicating that the hb-PTAs possess high orientational stabilities.

Two-photon absorption (TPA) is also an NLO phenomenon. Materials capable of undergoing TPA processes have attracted considerable interest because of their potential applications in fluorescence imaging, optical limiting, photodynamic therapy, optical data storage, 3D microfabrication, etc.138,139 PATAs 105 and 106 contain electron-donating triphenylamine units (D), while their aroyltriazole units generated during the click polymerizations are electron-accepting (A).140 It is known that polymers containing both D and A groups may show large TPA cross-sections (δ).141 We conducted TPA measurements of the polymers.142,143 The variations in the δ values of 105b and 106a with wavelength are shown in Fig. 10. High δ values (up to 437 GM at 760 nm) were obtained, which may allow the polymers to find biomedical applications in, for example, two-photon fluorescence imaging of biological systems with minimal photoinduced cytotoxicity and damage.

4.5 Photovoltaic effect
Solar cells are under hot pursuit of scientists and technologists as clean and inexpensive energy sources. The applications of PTAs in the fabrication of efficient photovoltaic devices have been explored by Jin and coworkers.73,74 The researchers utilized the fluorene-containing PTAs as polymer matrices to trap liquid electrolytes and form quasi-solid-state electrolytes in the construction of dye-sensitized solar cells with a device configuration of SnO2/F/TiO2/N719/solid-state electrolyte/Pt, where N719 = cis-bis(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylate-4′-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate)ruthenium(II). It was found that among the PTAs examined by the researchers, polymer 34 showed the best performance and displayed the highest power conversion efficiency (4.62%; Fig. 11).

4.6 Light refraction
PATAs 107–109 were optically transparent: they practically did not absorb any light at wavelengths longer than 395 nm. The PATAs contain polarizable benzoyltriazole units and are thus anticipated to show high refractive indices (RI).110 Indeed, the polymers were highly refractive: for example, 107 showed RI values of 1.653–1.623 in the wavelength region of 600–1700 nm (Fig. 12). Its congeners with longer spacers, i.e., 108 and 109, displayed lower RI values in the same wavelength region, but the RI values are still higher than those of many commercial plastics. The difference between the refractivities of polymers 107 and 109 at the telecommunications-important wavelength of 1550 nm was as large as 0.077. Evidently, the RI of a PATA can be tuned to a large extent by a small change in its alkyl spacer length.
 Fig. 12  Light refraction spectra of thin films of PATAs 107–109 and their modified Abbé numbers (ν′D). Reproduced with permission from ref. 110. Copyright 2009, Wiley-VCH. 
The linear PATAs exhibited high modified Abbé numbers (ν′D).144 The ν′D value for polymer 109, for example, was as high as 273 (Fig. 12). Since optical dispersion is inversely proportional to the Abbé number,145 the chromatic aberrations of the polymers are thus extremely low (down to 3.7 × 10−3). The very stable light refractivity over a wide wavelength span (∼600–1700 nm) is truly striking, which makes the polymers promising for a diversity of photonic applications, especially in the technologically important IR region.
4.7 Cytocomplexation and biodegradation
Reineke et al. used water-soluble cationic PTAs 65 to check their capabilities to bind and charge-neutralize DNA strands using a gel electrophoretic shift assay technique.88 Each of the polymers was allowed to combine with plasmid DNA (pDNA) in the N/P range of 0–15, where N/P denotes the ratio of the secondary amine units (N) in the polymer to the phosphate units (P) in the pDNA (Fig. 13). All of the polymers were found to form polyplexes with pDNA and to neutralize pDNA at low N/P ratios (1.0–1.5), with 65c giving the lowest N/P ratio, or the best result. The ethidium bromide (EB) exclusion assays revealed that the polyplexes of PTA 65c displayed the lowest fluorescence intensities at all the N/P ratios examined in the study [Fig. 13(b)], indicating that the polymer has the highest binding affinity to pDNA.

Polymeric delivery systems have been proven effective for cell transfection in vitro in the absence of serum, but the transfection in the presence of serum remains challenging. PTAs 65 were examined for their ability to deliver the pDNA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) into HeLa cells, which were evaluated by the percentage of the cells positive for FITC-labeled pDNA. The relative amount of the pDNA delivered per cell was qualitatively assessed by the average fluorescence intensity measured with a cytometer. As shown in Fig. 14(a), all of the polymers can deliver pDNA into HeLa cells, and 99% of the cells can be transfected in the serum-free medium of Opti-MEM. A large variation in the transfection efficiency, however, is observed in the DMEM containing 10% serum [Fig. 14(b)]. It is remarkable that even in the serum-containing DMEM, PTA 65c can still transfect 99% of HeLa cells.88 This polymer is thus the most effective vector, thanks to its high pDNA affinity.

The PTAs prepared by Hennik, Liskamp and coworkers (67 and 69) were biodegraded in the presence of chymotrypsin and trypsin due to the cleavage of their amide bonds by the proteases, as depicted in Fig. 15(a).89 Polymer 69 could also be chemically hydrolyzed owing to the breakage of its ester bonds. When the amide bonds in the PTAs were cleaved by chymotrypsin and trypsin, primary amines were generated. These primary amines in the degradation products and those in the lysine residues could be quantified by ninhydrin assay. Upon incubation of the PTAs in the medium with a defined pH, an increase in the amount of primary amine was observed until a plateau was reached.

Panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 15 show the variations in the concentrations of primary amines in trypsin-incubated 67 and 69 with time, as determined by the ninhydrin assays. At a trypsin concentration of 0.016 μM, polymer 67 is completely degraded in 50 h, as evidenced by the doubling in the amine concentration at pH 7.5. Since 69 is relatively stable at pH 5.0, its trypsin-induced degradation was investigated at this pH instead of pH 7.5, in an effort to avoid the interference from chemical hydrolysis. It can be seen from Fig. 15(c) that 69 is biodegraded at a trypsin concentration of 0.8 μM, with a plateau reached in 30 h.
5. Conclusion and perspective
In this critical review, we summarized the recent studies of click polymerizations. The enthusiastic efforts in the area of research have resulted in fruitful outcomes. Alkynes have been a group of useful monomers,6–11 whose versatility has now been further expanded to the syntheses of polymers with heteroatom backbones or skeletons via click polymerizations with azides. While azides have traditionally seldom been used as monomers for polymer syntheses, they are now added into the palettes of synthetic polymer chemists as new colorants. The Cu(I)- and Ru(II)-catalyzed click polymerizations yielded 1,4- and 1,5-regioregular PTAs, respectively. The metal-free thermal click polymerizations afforded PATAs with F1,4 up to 95%, which is truly remarkable, taking into account that the conventional thermal alkyne–azide 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions gave only regiorandom products.
Accompanying the development of the click polymerization into a useful polymerization technique, a variety of PTAs with linear and hyperbranched structures has been generated. The triazole ring in the polymer backbone or skeleton endowed the PTAs with novel structures and unique functionalities. PTAs with chain helicity, for example, were readily created, thanks to the nonlinear arrangement of the two substituents in one triazole ring. An acidichromic effect was observed in the PTAs, owing to the protonation of the triazole ring in the presence of acid. The high photosensitivity and polarizability of the triazole ring made the PTAs photo-cross-linkable and light-refractive, while the difference in the π-conjugations between the 1,4- and 1,5-isomeric units resulted in the regiostructure-dependant color of emission. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions of the heterocyclic triazole units with biological polymers enabled specific binding of the PTA chains to the DNA strands.
While the research in the area has progressed rapidly, many possibilities are still awaiting for exploration. Opportunities are plentiful but mainly exist in such areas as monomer design, catalyst development and reaction control. The design of new alkyne/azide monomers with mono- and multifunctionalities will aid the synthesis of new PTAs with tailor-made structures and properties. The development of new metallic and non-metallic catalysts with easy accessibility, excellent efficiency and high regioselectivity will help to widen the applicability of the click polymerization technique, and the control of the click polymerization reactions will facilitate the production of PTAs with precise regiostructures, defined conformations, uniform chain lengths, and ready macroscopic processability in high yields.
The most noteworthy feature of the click polymerization is its ability to create polymers with heteroatom backbones or skeletons. Its potential applications in the area of biomaterials research have been demonstrated, but much remains to be done. Noting the structural similarity of the heteroatom-containing backbones or skeletons of the PTAs with those of biopolymers, one direction for future development with great promise in the area is the syntheses of PTAs by click polymerizations, with cytocompatibility and bioactivity. The remarkable advantages of the click polymerizations will attract more researchers to this exciting area of research. It is anticipated that through the collective research efforts of scientists and technologists, the click polymerizations will be further developed and will find widespread applications as a useful tool in the areas of multi-disciplinary research, especially for the synthesis of functional polymers and the development of advanced materials.
