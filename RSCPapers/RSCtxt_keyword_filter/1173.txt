    , Accepted 12th September 2014First published on 12th September 2014AbstractTwo solution-processed asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs) with cyclopenta[b]indolinyl (1a) and cyclopenta[b]indolyl (1b) as end cappers have been designed and synthesized. Although the internal molecular structure variations are minimal, the presence of the cyclopenta[b]indolinyl group endows 1a more planar molecular structure, which results in a much more compact solid-state structure (density is 1.317 g cm−3 for 1a but is 1.187 g cm−3 for 1b), dramatically affecting charge transport in the thin films. The hole mobility of 1a:PC71BM blended film is about 7 times higher than that of 1b:PC71BM. Consequently, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on 1a of up to 4.1%, approximately 80% higher than that of 1b, is one of the highest PCEs achieved for ASQ-based bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) device structure is a quite promising technique for renewable energy source applications due to its low cost and potential for fabrication of large-area flexible devices.1–3 In addition, BHJ-OPVs based on small molecular (SM) photoactive materials have attracted great interest recently because of their unique advantages over their polymer counterparts, such as well-defined molecular structure and molecular weight, facile synthesis and high purity without batch-to-batch variations.3–5
Among the SMOPV materials hitherto exploited, squaraine derivatives have been considered to be excellent electron donor candidates because of their intense absorption bands in the visible and NIR regions, as well as excellent photochemical/photophysical stability.6–9 So far, recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of squaraine-based solution-processed BHJ-SMOPVs is as high as 5.50%.10 It is noteworthy that the squaraine dye used in this report has a symmetrical molecular structure (SQ, D–A–D). Compared with SQs, the device performance of BHJ-SMOPVs based on asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs, D–A–D′) is much inferior to that of SQ ones, e.g., the corresponding PCEs are only 0.20–2.05%.6,11–13 The low PCEs of these devices should be ascribed to the relatively low open circuit voltages (Voc, 0.24–0.69 V), fill factors (FF, 0.27–0.40) and short circuit current density (Jsc, 1.40–9.05 mA cm−2).6,11–13 However, asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs, D–A–D′) should be more advantageous with regard to the fine-tuning of optoelectronic properties14,15 and often exhibit better solubility in common organic solvents16 than SQs. In fact, ASQs are more promising candidates relative to SQs in many optoelectronic applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells, bioimaging probes, and nonlinear optical materials.17–19
Recently, we have reported two asymmetrical squaraines and rendered a very high Voc of 1.12 V based on its single BHJ SMOPVs.20 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was limited to 2.82% due to its low FF of 0.38 and Jsc of 7.00 mA cm−2. Despite of the excellent absorption properties of squaraine dyes, most of the squaraine dyes based BHJ-OPVs suffer from low FF and Jsc,6,11–13,20–23 which may be mostly ascribed to the low hole mobility of the optical active layer.21–23 Therefore, through rational molecular design, good planar squaraine materials can be obtained to promote better intermolecular packing for enhanced carrier mobility, essentially improving the FF and Jsc of the corresponding BHJ-OPV devices to elevate the PCE, which is greatly significant in expanding the application of squaraine materials in the OPV field.23–25
In this paper, we report the design and synthesis of two novel ASQ compounds 1a and 1b (structures shown in Scheme 1), which possess similar structures, but bearing cyclopenta[b]indolinyl (1a) and cyclopenta[b]indolyl-modified moieties (1b). Herein, indolinyl and indolyl groups rather than alkyl(phenyl)amino or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl groups were selected as the substituents due to their higher molecular rigidity and better planarity,26–28 while a cyclopentyl segment was fused onto the indoline or indole segments to endow the compounds with good solution-processing capability. More importantly, the different hybridization status of the C1 and C2 in 1a (sp3) and 1b (sp2) and the different electron-donating capability of the N atoms of the two compounds (marked in Scheme 1) would have great effect on the steric and electronic configurations of the substituents, thus the two objective compounds might show different molecular geometries, hence different intermolecular packing properties. This is quite propitious for us to gain further insight into the correlations between molecular structures and photovoltaic properties. Preliminary results show that compound 1a bearing cyclopenta[b]indolinyl unit displays a much more planar geometry, and under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination at room temperature, its BHJ-OPV device renders a rather high FF of 0.50 and Jsc of 10.49 mA cm−2, leading to a maximum PCE of 4.1%, which is one of the highest PCEs for ASQ-based BHJ SMOPVs.6,11–13,20

2. Experimental section
2.1 General
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance AV II-400 MHz instrument with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. High resolution mass spectra were measured on a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 infrared spectrometer with KBr pellets under ambient atmosphere. Absorption spectra of the target compounds in 5 × 10−6 mol L−1 chloroform solution and thin film states were measured with a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer.
2.2 Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry was performed in 0.10 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6/anhydrous acetonitrile (2.5 × 10−4 mol L−1) with a LK 2005A electrochemical work station, using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 mol L−1 in acetonitrile) reference electrode. Solutions were deoxygenated by Ar bubbling for 30 min prior to each experiment. At the end of each measurement, ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple was used as an internal potential reference.
2.3 X-ray crystallography
The crystallographic data for 1a and 1b reported here had been deposited in the ESI.† Single crystal samples of 1a and 1b were obtained from CH2Cl2/MeOH and CH2Cl2/acetone, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were obtained on an Xcalibur E X-ray single crystal diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. The data collection was executed using CrysAlisPro program. The structures were determined using direct method and successive Fourier difference syntheses (SHELXS-97) and refined using full-matrix least squares procedure on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms (SHELXL-97). Additional refinement details and the resulting factors for 1a and 1b are given in Supporting Information.
2.4 Device preparation
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated-glass substrate (sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) with a layered structure of glass/ITO/MoO3/ASQ:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The ITO substrates were cleaned through sequential sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 10 min each, and finally blow-dried by high purity nitrogen. The substrate was treated by UV-ozone for 5 min, then immediately transferred into a high vacuum chamber for the deposition of 80 Å MoO3 at a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.5 Å s−1. Subsequently, the photoactive layer was fabricated by spin-casting a blend of the target compounds and PC71BM in chloroform solution with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 (1500 rpm, 50 s) under a N2-filling glove box at 25 °C. Then the substrates were loaded into a vacuum chamber to finish the deposition of LiF (8 Å) and Al (1000 Å) at a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.05 Å s−1 and 1.5 Å s−1, respectively. Deposition rate and film thickness were monitored in situ using a quartz crystal oscillator mounted to the substrate holder. The active area of OPV cells was 6 mm2. To obtain the average data related to device performance, several batches of devices (8 cells per batch) for each set of conditions were fabricated and tested. The current–voltage curves under illumination were measured using an Abet solar simulator with a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), after spectral mismatch correction under an ambient atmosphere at 25 °C. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/ASQ:PC71BM (80 nm)/Au (100 nm). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed in air using a QE/IPCE Measurements Solar Cell Scan 100 (ZOLIX) system. Samples for atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were prepared by casting ASQ:PC71BM blended thin films on ITO-coated glass substrates with pre-deposited MoO3 layer (8 nm).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The synthetic routes to compounds 1a and 1b are outlined in Scheme 2. Intermediates 2, 3a and 3b were prepared according to literature reports.20,29 Intermediates 4a and 4b were synthesized through the Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling of 3a/3b with 1-bromo-3,5-dimethoxybenzene. Then, methoxy groups of 4a and 4b were converted into hydroxy groups with BBr3 to render compounds 5a and 5b respectively. Finally, the two objective molecules 1a and 1b were prepared by condensation of 2 with 5a and 5b, respectively. The molecular structures of the 1a and 1b were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR-ESI-MS, and confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. It is noteworthy that both the two compounds show good solubility in common organic solvents like chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. Additionally, high quality films could be obtained through spin-coating, suggesting that they are very suitable for solution processing.
3.2 Single crystal X-ray crystallography
To confirm the molecular structures and gain insight into the intermolecular packing properties of 1a and 1b, their crystal structures were determined via single crystal X-ray crystallography. Both of 1a and 1b display monoclinic crystal system with same space group of P21/n, and their ORTEP diagrams as well as intermolecular packing patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The bond lengths of both C8–N1 (1.376 Å) and C4–C5 (1.419 Å) bonds in 1a are shorter than the corresponding ones in 1b (C27–N2: 1.411 Å; C22–C24: 1.433 Å), hence in comparison with cyclopenta[b]indolyl group, the cyclopenta[b]indolinyl substituent should contribute more significantly to the extension of conjugation system in the objective compound, which might be attributed to its more electron-donating nitrogen atom. This deduction is further confirmed by 1H NMR characterization results, since the H1 signal of phenyl ring in 1a is found to show more shielding effect than that in 1b (6.36 ppm vs. 6.56 ppm). As expected, both indoline and indole subunits are found to show nearly coplanar geometries. Due to the different hybridization states of the C1 and C2 atoms (marked in Scheme 1) in 1a and 1b, the cyclopentane ring of 1a is found to align almost orthogonally to the indoline segment; yet that of 1b is nearly coplanar with the indole segment. Nevertheless, despite the more planar conformation of cyclopenta[b]indolyl relative to cyclopenta[b]indolinyl segment, the dihedral angles between phenyl and indolyl/indolinyl moieties were observed to be 36.67° for 1b and 9.87° for 1a; while the torsional angles between the squarate ring and phenyl unit were calculated to be 4.93° for 1b and 0.84° for 1a. In addition, the hydrogen bond lengths (O⋯H–O) were measured to be 1.783 Å and 1.794 Å in 1b, but 1.560 Å and 1.625 Å in 1a; and the corresponding phenolic protons of 1b (12.24 ppm, 12.16 ppm) show more downfield-shifted 1H NMR signals than those of 1a (12.36 ppm), confirming that the intramolecular H-bonding interactions in 1b are weaker than those in 1a. Consequently, the molecular backbone of 1a possesses a more planar configuration relative to 1b, which might promote more effective intermolecular packing.
 Fig. 1  ORTEP and packing diagrams of 1a and 1b in their crystal structures. 
As illustrated in Fig. 1, both 1a and 1b were found to exhibit relatively strong edge-to-π intermolecular stacking effect. But for 1a, the distance between its two nearest neighboring molecules is 3.354 Å, which is shorter than that of 1b (3.465 Å); moreover, the density of 1a is much higher than that of 1b (1.317 g cm−3vs. 1.187 g cm−3) in single crystal states. Thus, the intermolecular stacking of compound 1a was confirmed to be more effective than that of 1b, which should be propitious to the enhancement of charge carrier mobility.24,25,30–32
3.3 Photophysical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra of 1a and 1b in dilute chloroform solution and thin solid films samples spin-casted from chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2, and the data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, analogous to some ASQ dyes, 1a and 1b both exhibit an intense absorption band with intramolecular-charge-transfer (ICT) transition feature.12,33 The λmax of 1a and 1b are 681 nm and 638 nm, respectively, and the much bathochromic-shifted λmax of 1a relative to 1b suggests that 1a owns a more extended molecular conjugation system. In addition to its more red-shifted ICT absorption band, 1a possesses a higher absorption coefficient than that of 1b (2.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1vs. 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1). This might be attributed to the more efficient ICT effect within compound 1a due to its better molecular planarity. In film states, both the two compounds display drastically broadened and red-shifted absorption bands (data shown in Table 1), which should arise from their intense intermolecular interactions in condensed state. It is noteworthy that although in dilute solution, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the absorption band of 1a (39 nm) is much narrower than that of 1b (78 nm), it becomes slightly broader than that of 1b in film state (174 nm vs. 165 nm), which may be attributed to the more condensed packing of 1a relative to 1b. Through their absorption spectra in solid film state, the optical band gaps of 1a and 1b were estimated to be 1.54 eV and 1.64 eV, both close to the ideal bandgap (1.50 eV) of photovoltaic donor materials.34

3.4 Electrochemical characterization
To estimate the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of the objective compounds, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on 1a and 1b in acetonitrile solution with Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the objective compounds were determined from the peak of the first oxidation and reduction waves by comparison with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple whose energy level is 4.80 eV below vacuum.35 The cyclic voltammograms of 1a and 1b are shown in Fig. 3, and the data are summarized in Table 1. During the anodic scan from 0 to 1.0 V, both the two compounds show reversible two-electron oxidation processes, with the peaks of the first oxidation wave located at 0.37 V for 1a and 0.52 V for 1b. Consequently, the HOMO levels of 1a and 1b were estimated to be −5.10 eV and −5.22 eV, and the relatively low HOMO levels of both compounds would benefit much to achieve relatively high Voc in BHJ-OPV devices.36 The lower HOMO energy level of compound 1b relative to 1a can be rationally ascribed to the presence of the less electron-rich cyclopenta[b]indolyl substituent. Upon cathodic scan, 1a and 1b were observed to show irreversible reduction signals with peak waves of −1.20 V for 1a and −1.15 V for 1b; accordingly, their LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.59 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively. Taking into account that the LUMO energy level of PC71BM is as low as −4.00 eV,37 in the blending system of PC71BM:1a (or 1b), efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation could be realized.34 The electrochemical band gaps (ΔECV) of compounds 1a and 1b were calculated to be 1.51 eV and 1.59 eV, respectively, which is in line with their corresponding optical band gaps.

3.5 Theoretical calculation
To gain insight into the origin of the dissimilar electrochemical properties of 1a and 1b induced by different substituents, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 software. For the singlet ground states (S0) of 1a and 1b, the optimized molecular structures were calculated at B3LYP/6-31G level. The optimized structures of the compounds along with the numbering of important atoms, the main geometrical parameters calculated, and some experimental data of 1a and 1b derived from X-ray crystallography can be found in Supporting Information. The close similarity in bond lengths and bond angles between calculated and experimental values reveals the reliability of our computational results. The electronic densities of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the two objective compounds are depicted in Fig. 4. For both 1a and 1b, the indolinyl and indolyl segments were observed to contribute significantly to the HOMOs, but little to the LUMOs; therefore, the LUMO energy levels of 1a and 1b should be similar, while the HOMO energy level of compound 1a should be higher than that of 1b due to the more electron-donating indolinyl relative to the indolyl group.

3.6 Photovoltaic cell properties
Since both 1a and 1b show desirable solubility in common solvents, intense absorption in red and near infrared region, BHJ-OPV cells using 1a and 1b as electron donor materials and [6,6]-phenylC71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptor material were fabricated in order to evaluate their photovoltaic performance. The device structure was ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/ASQ:PC71BM (80 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm), where MoO3 and LiF served as anode and cathode modification layers,38 and the weight ratio of ASQ:PC71BM was selected as 1:8. The typical J–V curves of these BHJ-OPV cells are shown in Fig. 5, and the representative characterization data are summarized in Table 2.

The 1b-based OPV shows a higher Voc than that of 1a (0.95 vs. 0.83 V), which should stem from the lower HOMO energy level of compound 1b relative to 1a. Nevertheless, BHJ-OPV device with 1a:PC71BM composite system as active layer shows a significantly high FF of up to 0.47, together with a high Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2; while the 1b-based device has a moderate FF of 0.32 and Jsc of 6.67 mA cm−2. Consequently, BHJ-OPV device based on 1a shows an impressive PCE of 3.6%, which is much higher than that of the 1b-based device (PCE: 2.0%).
The EQE curves of the two devices are shown in Fig. 6. Obviously, squaraine dyes contribute more to the absorption in the long wavelength region (550–800 nm), while PC71BM contributes more to the absorption in the short wavelength region (300–550 nm). Under the same blend ratio, the EQE data in 300–550 nm region for 1a are much higher than that of 1b, possibly due to the higher charge carrier mobility of 1a:PC71BM film, while the higher integral value in 550–800 nm for 1a may be echoing the results of its better absorption and higher carrier mobility.
 Fig. 6  (a) External quantum efficiency curves of the two BHJ-OPVs and J–V characteristics of (b) pristine and (c) blend films single carrier devices used for hole mobility measurement. 
To verify this hypothesis, four hole-only devices were designed according to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model,39–41 and the structures were ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/active layer (80 nm)/Au (100 nm), where the active layers were 1a, 1b, 1a:PC71BM (1:8), or 1b:PC71BM (1:8) respectively. The hole mobility of these pristine ASQ films as well as ASQ:PC71BM composite films was calculated by fitting the J–V characteristics of the devices (shown in Fig. 6) using the Mott–Gurney law.42 As expected, the results indicate that the hole mobility of 1a in pristine and blending film states are both much higher than those of 1b. In pristine film state, the hole mobility of 1a (1.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is about 2 times higher than that of 1b (4.88 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1); while in composition film state, the hole mobility of the 1a:PC71BM blending film is calculated to be 9.18 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 7 times higher than that of 1b:PC71BM one (1.16 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). The subtle structural variation in the end-capping substituents of 1a and 1b result in drastically different hole mobility in both pristine and blending films due to the different intermolecular packing of these two ASQ compounds.
As the quality of interpenetrating network within the blending films would also have great effect on the carrier mobility,43,44 atomic force microscopies (AFM) measurements were conducted on the blending films of 1a or 1b with PC71BM (1:8). As shown in Fig. S2,† the two film samples show obviously different morphology. The 1a:PC71BM blended film shows a smoother surface with a smaller surface roughness (0.25 nm vs. 0.44 nm) than that of 1b:PC71BM, implying the interpenetrating network formed by 1a:PC71BM may be more beneficial to carrier transport.
Most importantly, the FF of 1a-based device is up to 0.47, which is much higher than many devices using squaraine derivatives as photovoltaic donor materials (0.27–0.40).6,11–13,20–23 Nevertheless, the FF of 1b-based device is only 0.32, which is much lower than that of 1a, mostly due to its much lower hole mobility of its blended film. Besides hole mobility, the series resistance (RS) of device is also a factor affecting FF and low series resistance leads to high FF.30 The RS of devices were defined from the slope of J–V curves in Fig. 5, which shows that the RS of 1a-based device is much lower than that of 1b (10.87 Ω cm2vs. 61.24 Ω cm2). Consequently, the much higher FF of 1a-based device relative to 1b-based one can be rationally attributed to the higher hole mobility as well as lower RS of the 1a-device. Furthermore, in accordance with the literature report,8 our experimental results reveal that higher density of the squaraine dye would result in higher FF of the OPV device. Thereupon, for photovoltaic materials, density, the easily measured physical quantity, might also be an important property deserving of investigation.
It is noteworthy that the photovoltaic characterizations on 1a and 1b are quite preliminary, since only the as-prepared ASQs:PC71BM blending films were used as the photoactive layer, and no optimization on the device structure, layer thickness as well as post-treatment conditions was conducted for achieving higher PCEs. Therefore, much improved photovoltaic performance should be expected when further optimizations like thermo-annealing,38 solvent-annealing10 and incorporation of additives45 are carried out. For example, after the active layers were thermo-annealed at 90 °C for 10 min, the 1a and 1b based devices both show increased Jsc and FF, resulting in a maximum PCE of 4.1% and 2.4%, respectively (vide Table 2). Moreover, the PCE of 4.1% is one of the highest PCEs for ASQ-based BHJ SMOSCs,6,11–13,20 suggesting that ASQs are indeed quite promising photovoltaic materials.
4. Conclusion
Two ASQ derivatives bearing similar molecular skeleton but different electron-donating end-cappers, namely 1a and 1b, have been designed and synthesized. The small variations in their molecular structures result in dramatically different electronic and steric structures, and hence different photovoltaic performances. In comparison with compound 1b bearing cyclopenta[b]indolyl substituent, compound 1a with cyclopenta[b]indolinyl as end-capper shows more planar molecular geometry, more intense intermolecular interactions, higher density in crystalline state, bathochromic-shifted absorption spectra, higher absorption coefficient, and higher hole mobility. Consequently, BHJ-SMOPV device based on 1a displays drastically higher FF and Jsc than those of 1b-device, and a high PCE of 4.1% is achieved. All these preliminary results demonstrate that ASQs are quite promising candidates for SMOPV application, and their optoelectronic properties could be easily fine-tuned by manipulating the character of D and D′ subunits. Moreover, for 1a and 1b, the higher density of the squaraine dye would result in higher FF of the OPV device, which is in accordance with the literature report. Therefore, density might also be an important physical quantity deserving of investigation for the evaluation of the photovoltaic performance of organic materials.
