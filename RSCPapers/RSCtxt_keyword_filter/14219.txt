    , Accepted 18th September 2008First published on 31st October 2008AbstractThis work reports on the preparation of Cr-doped TiO2 (Cr–TiO2) and its utilization in the photoanode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Pure TiO2 and 10% Cr–TiO2 sols were individually obtained viahydrolysis followed by a hydrothermal process at 250 °C for 12 h. The TiO2 sol was first coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a polymer binder and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The Cr–TiO2 sol was then deposited on the TiO2 layer through the same procedure, thus forming two different layers on the substrate. We found that the photovoltaic efficiency was improved by ca. 18.3% when the double layer was adopted as the photoanode of a DSSC instead of only the TiO2 layer. We assume that this improvement was caused by the repression of electron recombination occurring in the double layer. Further characterizations were carried out to clarify the function of the double layer.
1. Introduction
The development of a DSSC has been recognized as a promising research field for next generation alternative energy sources due to its reasonable photovoltaic efficiency with low production costs and a quick brief fabrication process.1–6 Many researchers have been intensively investigating DSSCs, especially since the outstanding breakthroughs made by the Grätzel group (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL) when they developed DSSCs with conversion efficiencies close to 10% for the first time.7–11 In the decade since, efficiencies over 10% have been obtained.1,3,12–16 This rapid progress seems to have paralleled the meteoric development in nanotechnology over the past ten years since the preparation of core materials for DSSCs—such as the photoanode (semiconductor), the sensitizer (dye), and the electrolyte—has been intimately tied to nanotechnology development.
A DSSC is mainly composed of a dye-adsorbed semiconductor film deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte. If the dye is illuminated, excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor and migrate through the semiconductor layer. When the electrons reach the TCO surface, they transfer to the counter-electrode through an external circuit. The electrolyte is then reduced by accepting electrons from the counter-electrode, which then regenerates the oxidized dye by donating electrons. This operation continues as long as the illumination is maintained and none of these constituents are entirely deactivated.
Many investigators have made great efforts to enhance the performance of DSSCs by improving the constituents' properties. These efforts can largely be classified into four categories of development: sensitizers,17–21 anodic materials,22–28 electrolytes,29–31 and the modification of anodic materials, especially TiO2.32–34 Apparently, TiO2 has been most frequently used as an anodic material in DSSCs due to its chemical stability and moderate charge transport capability. Although other semiconductors such as ZnO, SnO2, CdS, and Nb2O5 have been widely applied, none of them have shown better performance than TiO2.22–25 However, the electrons injected into the TiO2 layer are sometimes able to return to the sensitizer or the electrolyte due to an electron recombination phenomenon. This back electron transfer causes a reduction in conversion efficiency; hence many researchers have investigated modifications to the TiO2 layer. Two approaches are mainly used—coating the TiO2 either with an insulator35–37 or with another semiconductor.38–40 In the case of the former, it is required that the coating be thin enough to make the injected electrons pass through the insulator (namely, the tunneling effect), while a semiconductor with a higher conduction band edge than TiO2 possesses has to be employed for the latter approach. Back electron transfer can be remarkably reduced for both cases if the modification materials build up energy barriers causing the suppression of the charge recombination reaction.40–42 Meanwhile, surface dipoles could potentially be shaped rather than the energy barriers, depending on the modification process. It has been shown that surface dipoles shift the conduction band edge of TiO2 toward a negative potential. In this case, back electron transfer is not hindered and overall conversion efficiency is improved due to photovoltage enhancement.35,40,43–45
The coating methods mentioned above have been intensively studied, but little attention has been paid to applying a junction to the photoanode of a DSSC.46 Due to a potential gradient in the junction, the injected electrons are expected to mostly move to the TCO side. This implies that the suppression of charge recombination results in an improvement of conversion efficiency. We have tried to generate a double layer by sequentially depositing a pure TiO2 (n-type) and a metal-doped TiO2 layer (p-type) onto a TCO substrate. We chose chromium as a dopant since some investigators have reported that TiO2, an n-type semiconductor, could be converted to a p-type semiconductor via an appropriate addition of chromium.47–50 The double layer was named the ‘p-n homojunction’ because both layers are mainly composed of the same semiconductor, TiO2. A few TiO2-based p-n homojunctions have been developed; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have been applied to a photoanode in a DSSC. Consequently, we have examined whether the double layer shows the characteristics of a junction and whether the conversion efficiency of a DSSC is improved due to the function of our new type of photoanode.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals

Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, Junsei) and chromium(III) nitrate [Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Sigma-Aldrich] were selected as Ti and Cr precursors, respectively. Ethylcellulose [(C12H22O5)n, TCI] was chosen to give viscosity to the TiO2 sols for deposition onto glass substrates. Commercial N719 [RuL2(NCS) 2(TBA) 2H2·4H2O,L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate, TBA = tetrabutylammonium, Dyesol] dye was employed as the sensitizer. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMImI, C6H11IN2, TCI), lithium iodide (LiI, Aldrich), and iodine (I2, Wako) were adopted to prepare an electrolyte. All of the chemicals were used without any further purification in this study.
2.2. Procedures

2.2.1. TiO2 preparation. 
A TiO2 sol was prepared viahydrolysis of a Ti precursor, TTIP, followed by hydrothermal synthesis (reported in 45). To start, 24.467 ml of TTIP was dispersed in 4.673 ml of acetic acid, and this solution was stirred for 15 min. The solution was poured into 117 ml of deionized water while being simultaneously and vigorously stirred for 1 h to complete the hydrolysis. Then, 1.507 ml of 69% nitric acid was injected into the solution, and the mixture was heated to 78 °C over 40 min and held at that temperature for another 75 min. After cooling, we adjusted the mixture volume to 150 ml by adding deionized water. The resulting mixture was poured into a 200 ml stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 250 °C for 12 h. When the hydrothermal synthesis was complete, 0.904 ml of nitric acid was injected and the mixture was stirred for another 20 min. The mixture was then enriched using a rotary-evaporator to minimize loss during the subsequent centrifuging and washing process. Consequently, we obtained a TiO2 gel that was dissolved in absolute ethanol to finally acquire a 10 wt.% TiO2 colloidal solution.
For the case of Cr doping, we used Cr(NO3)3 melted in deionized water. Before conducting the TiO2hydrolysis described above, 3.713 g of Cr(NO3)3 was liquefied in 117 ml of deionized water, and then the prepared TTIP solution was poured into the aqueous Cr(NO3)3 solution at one time to obtain 10 at.% Cr–TiO2. A green precipitate was instantaneously formed, whereas a white one had appeared during the hydrolysis of pure TiO2. Except for this doping process, the preparation of a Cr–TiO2 sol followed the procedure described above.


2.2.2. DSSC preparation. 
The TiO2 and Cr–TiO2 sols were individually mixed with a polymer binder, ethylcellulose, dissolved in α-Terpineol, giving two different pastes. Each paste (pure TiO2 paste and Cr–TiO2 paste) was coated onto an FTO (Fluorine-doped tin oxide, sheet resistance: ∼10 Ω, 20 mm × 30 mm, Asahi Glass, Japan) substrate using a doctor blade, followed by firing at 500 °C for 30 min. In addition, the Cr–TiO2 paste was also coated onto one of the sintered TiO2 films and calcined again under the heating condition described above. To control film thickness, we used 3M Magic Tape in the doctor-blade process, and it was found that thickness depended on how many folds of tape were used. Consequently, three kinds of film (thickness: ca. 12–15 µm, active area: 0.26 cm2), TiO2/FTO, Cr–TiO2/FTO, and Cr–TiO2/TiO2/FTO, were fabricated and named T/F, CT/F, and CT/T/F, respectively.
After the resultant films were cooled, they were immersed in a 0.3 mM ethanolic N719 solution for ca. 12 h, and the dye-adsorbed films (photoanodes) were rinsed with absolute ethanol. Thermally treated platinum counter electrodes were applied to the photoanodes and sealed with a 30 µm-thick Surlyn film (Solaronix). The electrolyte, composed of 0.6 M EMImI, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile, was introduced into the cells through one of the two small holes drilled on the counter electrodes.

2.3. Characterization studies

2.3.1. Material characterizations. 

Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation and a scintillation counter detector. The patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 20–80°. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using VG Multilab ESCA 2000 (ThermoVG scientific) with Mg Kα radiation. The C 1s photoelectron peak (binding energy at 284.6 eV) was used as the energy reference. The electrical properties were measured by using a HL5500PC-M (Bio-Rad) Hall-effect measurement system. I–V measurement was carried out by using an I–V test system (Luft) equipped with a Keithley model 4200 SourceMeter. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were obtained from a Cary 5000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped with an internal diffuse reflectance integrating sphere.


2.3.2. Photoelectrical characterizations. 

            IPCE (incident photon to current conversion efficiency) results were acquired from an IPCE G1218a (PV Measurement). This system applies monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon arc lamp (Ushio UXL-75XE) filtered by a dual-grafting monochromator and individual filters onto the test devices. An ellipsoidal reflector collects light from the lamp and focuses it on the monochromatic entrance slit via a mechanical chopper to create a small modulated signal. While the modulated, monochromatic light was applied to the test devices, a continuous bias light (ca. 1 sun) was also applied. Photocurrent-voltage measurement was performed with a Keithley model 2400 SourceMeter and a Newport 91192 solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel). Light intensity was adjusted to simulated AM 1.5 radiation at 100 mW cm−2 with a Radiant Power Energy Meter (model 70260, Oriel).

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of T/F and CT/F. We found that both samples have six diffraction lines (denoted by dots) at 2θ values of 26.3°, 33.6°, 37.7°, 51.4°, 61.5°, and 65.6° indicating crystallinity of the FTO. The samples also exhibited anatase crystalline phases having diffraction lines of (101), (004), (200), (105), and (204) planes at 2θ values of 25.1, 37.7, 47.9, 54.4, and 61.5, respectively. These coincide with the value of JCPDS Card No. 21-1272. Cr–TiO2 indicated diffraction patterns similar to those of pure TiO2 without any peaks characteristic of oxidized chromium.

          X-Ray diffraction patterns of T/F and CT/F, respectively. The intensities of these patterns were normalized. 
We present the XPS spectra of CT/F in Fig. 2. As already mentioned, carbon was used as the energy reference material, and its characteristic peak appeared at around 285 eV (Fig. 2a). The O 1s peak was located at 530.2 eV with an asymmetric pattern as presented in Fig. 2b. The primary peak at 530.2 eV indicates the O2− ion, while the additional shoulder at a higher energy side implies surface OH−groups or chemisorbed H2O.51 In the case of Ti 2p, two peaks were detected at 458.9 and 464.6 eV (Fig. 2c), which correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. The binding energies were shifted toward the higher energy side compared to those of pure TiO2 (458.4 and 464.2 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively). Thus, we assumed that Cr doping had affected the chemical states of TiO2 by means of Cr substitution for Ti. The peaks at 577.5 eV and 587.0 eV (Fig. 2d) were identified as Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2, respectively,51–54 indicating the presence of Cr in the sample. Since oxidized chromium was not observed (as shown in Fig. 1), it was certain that Cr ions had been successfully implanted into the TiO2 lattice during the doping process. Therefore, we believe that Cr3+ ions were incorporated into the TiO2 lattice.

We conducted Hall measurements for T/F and CT/F, and the results are presented in Table 1. It was found that un-doped TiO2 showed n-type characteristics, and the carrier concentration decreased by one order of magnitude (from 1 × 1018 to 1 × 1017 cm−3) when it was doped with 0.5–1 at.% Cr. Because the carrier type was still n-type in this range of Cr doping concentration, we tried to dope TiO2 more heavily. It was revealed that CT/F composed of 10 at.% Cr–TiO2 exhibited p-type conductivity with a carrier concentration of the order of 1 × 1016 cm−3. TiO2 is generally known as an n-type semiconductor, however, some groups have reported that its electronic characteristics can be converted from n-type to p-type viaCr addition.47–50 In particular, Ruiz et al. proved that the electronic band structure of TiO2 was altered incrementally as the amount of Cr dopant increased and the carrier type transformed.50 The carrier type transformation of our sample was also confirmed by another electrical analysis, I–V measurement. We applied both a forward (V > 0) and a reverse (V < 0) bias ranging from −10 V to 10 V to obtain a typical I–V curve. According to the results shown in Fig. 3, the CT/T/F recording with an onset voltage of ca. 3.7 V exhibited definite rectifying characteristics. The rectifying current for the sample was 1.35 mA under forward bias (10 V), while the current was almost zero under reverse bias (−10 V). T/F and CT/F exhibited nearly the same current of ca. 1 × 10−2 under both forward and reverse bias (Fig. 3 inset). This diode-like characteristic of the CT/T/F electrode indicates it is a p-n junction. Although pure TiO2 is generally known as an n-type semiconductor,1,46,50 we also confirmed its carrier type through Hall measurement (Table 1). Therefore, we believe that our 10 at.% Cr–TiO2 is a p-type semiconductor.

It was necessary to establish the electronic band structures of TiO2 and Cr–TiO2 in order to understand the electron transfer process when CT/T/F is applied to the photoanode of a DSSC. To this end, we obtained the XPS valence band spectra and the absorption patterns of TiO2 and Cr–TiO2. The XPS results for the two samples in the valence band region are presented in Fig. 4a. The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the two samples are illustrated in Fig. 4b and plotted as Kubelka–Munk functions versus wavelength of light. Based on the results of the XPS valence band spectra and DRS, we established the band structures for TiO2 and Cr–TiO2 (Fig. 5a). The valence band edge of TiO2 was located at 2.8 eV, and the calculated band-gap energy was found to be 3.1 eV (†λth = 396 nm). Therefore, the conduction band edge should be placed at −0.3 eV. In addition, Fermi level seemed to be situated at around −0.2 eV, since it is known that the Fermi level of TiO2 lies about 3 eV away from the upper edge of the O 2p band,55 which is consistent with n-type characteristics (Fig. 5b). We have also indicated the band structures of various TiO2 samples in Fig. 5a.56–58 Our TiO2 showed somewhat different band edge positions and band-gap energy from the samples. On the other hand, Cr–TiO2 exhibited conduction and valence band edges at −1.5 and 0.7 eV, respectively, which are both lower than the energy levels for the Ti 3d and O 2p band edges of TiO2. It was confirmed that the valence band of TiO2 shifted to the lower binding energy side in the wake of Cr doping thus its Fermi level went down toward the valence band edge, which resulted in the gradual alteration from n- to p-type.50 Accordingly, we expected that our 10 at.% Cr–TiO2 would also become a p-type semiconductor. We do not know exactly where the Fermi level of Cr–TiO2 is located, but it must lie within 1.1 eV of the valence band edge, as shown in Fig. 5b (−0.4 eV < EF < 0.7 eV). This means that the conduction band edge of Cr–TiO2 would always be placed at the lower binding energy side rather than that of TiO2, because each Fermi level for the two semiconductors adjoins the other when they constitute a junction. In Fig. 6, we present the band structure of the junction when it was applied to the photoanode of a DSSC. We named it the ‘p-n homojunction’ due to its TiO2 basis. In this system, the electrons injected from an excited dye pass through the conduction bands of the junction and reach the FTO substrate. However, the electrons rarely move in the opposite direction since they are theoretically unable to overcome the energy barrier resulting from the potential gradient in the junction. Therefore, electron recombination is possibly decreased while electrons are flowing through the junction. From what we can see, this leads an improvement in the photovoltaic efficiency of a DSSC.

Fig. 7a shows the ICPE spectra (defined as the number of electrons generated by illumination divided by the number of incident photons) for the DSSCs with T/F, CT/F, and CT/T/F. According to the results, the IPCE curve for the DSSC using CT/T/F exhibited an upward shift with respect to those employing either T/F or CT/F in most of the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm. We consider that the improved IPCE was caused by the enhancement of electron transfer in the CT/T/F photoanode. In other words, CT/T/F acting as the p-n homojunction minimized electron loss by recombination and resulted in the observed IPCE increase. We expected that the improved IPCE would be associated with an increase in short circuit current density (Jsc). It was confirmed that Jsc was enhanced by ca. 17% when a DSSC was fabricated with CT/T/F instead of T/F (Table 2, Fig. 7b). This Jsc improvement gave rise to the increase in photovoltaic efficiency. The DSSC with CT/T/F exhibited a conversion efficiency of 8.4%, which was an improvement of ca. 18.3% compared with T/F (Table 2).

4. Conclusions

        Cr–TiO2 semiconductors with various doping levels were prepared, and 10 at.% Cr–TiO2 was ascertained to be a p-type semiconductor. This semiconductor was additionally coated on a pure TiO2 film deposited on an FTO substrate (CT/T/F), and it was applied to the photoanode of a DSSC. The DSSC with a CT/T/F photoanode achieved greater conversion efficiency than that of the widely used TiO2 photoanode (T/F). It was clarified that the CT/T/F electrode was acting as a diode, i.e., a p-n homojunction with an energy barrier. We expected that the energy barrier prevented electron loss by repressing the recombination rate, this leads to the enhancement of Jsc, which results in greater photovoltaic efficiency.
