    , Accepted 5th March 2015First published on 5th March 2015AbstractA novel quinacridone-based polymer containing a vinylene linkage, PQTE, was synthesized and exhibited higher performance both in organic thin-film transistors and solar cells than that of the reference polymer PQ2T. On introducing the vinylene linkage, a strong interchain interaction is obtained with a short π–π stacking distance of 3.49 Å in the polymer PQTE, which is responsible for the highest mobility of 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported to date for quinacridone-based semiconductors. More significantly, the incorporation of a thienylene–vinylene–thienylene unit contributes to good miscibility between PQTE and PC71BM. Because of the effective intercalation of PC71BM in the PQTE lamellar structure, a high power conversion efficiency of 3.9% was achieved without any additives or post-treatments. Our rational molecular design qualifies quinacridone as a promising building block simultaneously in high performance polymer thin-film transistors and solar cells.
Introduction
Recent interest in polymer semiconductors has been motivated by their potential application in large-area and roll-to-roll organic electronics like organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) and organic photovoltaics (OPV).1,2 Molecular engineering of polymers allows for the adjustment of photo/electrochemical properties, solubility, packing, morphology of thin films and thus achievement of high performance.3,4 The common structural feature of these polymer semiconductors is the alternating electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units linked along polymer chains.5,6 Over the years, great effort has been made towards the search for efficient donor or acceptor units and the combination between these units. Impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >8% in OPV7–9 and the remarkable mobility of >10 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFT10–12 have been achieved by incorporating attractive units, such as benzodithiophene, diketopyrrolopyrrole, benzothiodiazole, isoindigo, arylene diimides, etc. Among these remarkable developments on OPV devices, cosolvents, small-molecule additives, and post-treatments, such as thermal annealing and solvent-vapour annealing, have been proved to be useful strategies to improve the microstructure of blend films. These additional processes increase fabrication costs and are unable to fulfill commercial requirements, which make them unfavourable. Therefore, the development of new building blocks with excellent properties both in photonics and electronics, as well as a simple fabrication process, is still a major challenge for material chemists.13
Recently, we have paid much attention to the quinacridone (QA) unit. It is a five-ring planar structure and is widely used as a magenta toner with excellent stability.14–17 The fact that nitrogen atoms can be functionalized with alkyl groups make it possible to use them in photoelectrical devices via solution processibility. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies are reported in the field of OTFT18,19 and OPVs15,20–24 based on this unit. In our group, we have reported a polymer PQBOC8 containing QA and benzothiodiazole.25 Although the effective conjugation is limited along the polymer backbone, this polymer still exhibited reasonable hole mobility in OFET and high PCE in OPV, simultaneously.23 Moreover, the crystalline ultra-thin film of this polymer showed high photoresponsivity.26 These encouraging results indicate that QA would be a promising building block for semiconducting polymers. Nevertheless, the mobilities of all these reported QA-based polymers are relatively low because of the large π–π stacking distance (∼4 Å).27 On the other hand, despite using additives or post-treatment methods, the PCE of QA-based polymers is still limited to 2–3%.24,27 Therefore, a rational design of the polymer backbone for QA-based polymers is urgently needed for further advancement of optoelectronic performance.
On the basis of the above considerations, we first introduce vinylene linkage into a QA-containing polymer, namely PQTE. In view of its rigid transconfiguration, thienylene–vinylene–thienylene in the polymer PQTE is expected to result in much planar configuration and strong interchain interaction.28,29 For comparison, a polymer PQ2T containing QA and bithiophene was also synthesized. As a result, the introduction of vinylene linkage improves not only the crystallinity of thin films but also the miscibility with PC71BM. In OTFTs, a PQTE film exhibited a short π–π stacking distance of 3.49 Å and high mobility up to 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1. In solar cells, as a donor material, PQTE exhibited PCE up to 3.9% because of the better miscibility with PC71BM than that of PQ2T, though PQTE showed a stronger intermolecular interaction. It is noteworthy that the PCE of PQTE is among the highest performance for QA-based polymers even though these devices were fabricated without any additives or post-treatments.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of two polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Monomer QA2Br was synthesized according to our previous work.25 The Stille-coupling reaction between the monomer QA2Br and (E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2-yl)ethene afforded the polymer PQTE, while in comparison, monomer QA2Br reacted with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene under the same reaction conditions affording the polymer PQ2T. Both of the polymers are purified by successive Soxhlet extractions. More detailed descriptions of the synthesis are available in the Experimental section. The two polymers have almost identical number-average molecular weights (Mn = 20.60 kDa for PQTE and Mn = 20.11 kDa for PQ2T) with very low polydispersity indexes (PDI) close to 1, as shown in Table 1, Fig. S1 and S2.† The two polymers showed very good thermal stability, which was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PQTE showed a little lower decomposition temperature Td of 405.3 °C while PQ2T exhibited a higher Td up to 436.3 °C (Fig. S3†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to investigate the thermal transition of polymers. No obvious thermal transition peak was observed in the range of 25–300 °C for the two polymers before decomposition, which is probably attributed to the rigid backbone limiting the chain motion.30

Optical and electronic properties
The absorption spectra of the two polymers both in dilute chloroform solution and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 1, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with PQ2T, PQTE showed red-shift absorption both in solution and thin films owing to an extended π-conjugation induced by the integration of vinylene linkage. For PQ2T, the maximum absorption peak was featureless and no obvious spectral shift was observed in the solid state compared with that in the dilute solution, indicating that the polymer might form pre-aggregates in solution.31 In the case of polymer PQTE, the maximum absorption profile was significantly sharper and there was a prominent shoulder peak at a longer wavelength (∼499 nm). Moreover, the shoulder peak became much finer and stronger in the thin film, which demonstrates that the vinylene linkage in PQTE led to a much stronger aggregate in the solid state. However, a slightly bathochromic shift (∼10 nm) was observed going from solution to thin film for PQTE which was also observed in other polymers.32 Density-functional theory (DFT, B3LYP/6-31G) was performed to model the electron density distributions of two trimers, as shown in Fig. S4.† From their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), we can observe that the QA unit exhibited a weak electro-deficient character and HOMO is not delocalized over the whole backbone.19 This is consistent with the fact that the weak shoulder peaks at around 550–630 nm can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Because of the weak electro-deficient character of the quinacridone unit, the reduction curves cannot be determined, and only oxidation curves are provided in Fig. 1b. The HOMO levels of PQTE and PQ2T calculated from the onset oxidation potential33 are almost identical (−5.3 eV) and approximated the work function of gold. This indicates that hole injection will be easy from the gold electrode to polymers. Using their optical band gaps, the LUMO levels are calculated to be −3.38 eV and −3.28 eV for PQTE and PQ2T, respectively. Similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels indicate that the incorporation of vinylene linkage cannot significantly influence the electrochemical properties of polymers.

OFET properties
To probe how the incorporation of vinylene linkage affects the charge transport of PQTE, bottom-gate/top-contact transistors were fabricated with a channel length of 30 μm and channel width of 500 μm. The insulator was a 300 nm SiO2 layer passivated with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The polymer solution was heated and stirred at 80 °C for 5 hours before being spin-coated on the substrate. The film thickness was about 35–40 nm. All films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Au was used as source and drain electrodes by vacuum deposition. Fig. 2 shows the typical output and transfer curves of FETs based on the two polymers. Carrier transport performances are summarized in Table 2. PQTE based FETs exhibit a maximum hole mobility as high as 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an average value of 0.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 10−6–10−7. This value is the highest mobility reported so far for quinacridone-based polymers. For PQ2T-based FETs, the highest mobility is calculated to be 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the average value of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff of 10−6–10−7, which is slightly higher than the value reported by the Kazuo Takimiya group. We attribute this enhancement to the lower PDI of PQ2T in our work. Smaller threshold voltages (VT) are also observed for PQTE devices (−9.8 V) than those of PQ2T devices (−12.0 V). The high mobility and low VT of TFTs based on PQTE are perhaps due to the preferable orientation of the PQTE film.

Ordering structure of OFET film
To shed light on the structural effect by introduction of vinylene linkage into PQTE, geometry optimization and molecular ordering were determined by DFT and two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD), respectively. The dihedral angle in PQTE trimers is slightly smaller than that of PQ2T trimmers suggesting a better coplanar structure in PQTE (Fig. S4†). Comparing the XRD pattern of two polymer films, as shown in Fig. 3, both polymers PQTE and PQ2T show (h00) diffractions up to the fourth order indicating that these polymers are long-range-ordered. However, large arcing diffraction of PQ2T suggested that there is no preferential orientation in the film which is consistent with the ref. 19. In contrast, the film of PQTE shows much centralized points along the qz axis and distinctly observable (010) diffraction along the qxy axis. The results indicate that the film of PQTE formed a preferentially ordered edge-on orientation on the substrate.34 The lamellar distances calculated from the out of plane patterns (Fig. 3c and Table S1†) are 21.6 Å and 22.7 Å for PQTE and PQ2T, respectively. Shorter lamellar distance of PQTE means that alkyl chains are packed more intensely between the adjacent polymer chains than those of PQ2T. From the in plane pattern, PQTE shows a strong (010) reflection peak corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.49 Å which is one of the shortest distances for polymers containing QA units. For a PQ2T film, a weak (010) reflection peak could be observed in the out of plane with the corresponding π–π stacking distance of 3.59 Å. Moreover, the presence of (h00) peaks corresponding to the lamellar structure further confirms that both face-on and edge-on orientations exist in this polymer film. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) further demonstrated the difference in morphology between the two polymers (Fig. S5†). PQTE films exhibit a uniform intertwined fibre structures with obviously crystalline zones, which is the result of a strong intermolecular interaction. In contrast, a PQ2T film shows a nodule-like morphology with relatively loosely packed grains. According to the result mentioned above, it is confirmed that the insert of vinylene linkage shortens the π–π stacking distance of the adjacent polymer chains because of good planarity and extended π-conjugation of vinylene linkage. Strong interchain interaction improves the crystallinity of the PQTE film. These observations are in good agreement with the mobility analysis.

Solar cell properties
Bulk heterojuction solar cells were fabricated by employing PQTE or PQ2T as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor. The typical device configuration is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. J–V curves of the optimized photovoltaic devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are displayed in Fig. 4b. The solar cell parameters are collected in Table 3 and Table S2.† The optimum polymer:PC71BM ratio was found to be 1:2. The blend solution was spin coated in chlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of the active layer is about 100–115 nm. Note that no processing additives were used at the time of spin coating. Even without any post-treatment, the highest PCE for PQTE was 3.90% with a Jsc of 9.74 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.73 V and a modest FF of 55%. For PQ2T, the devices exhibited a moderate PCE of 2.71% with a slight increase in Voc (0.74 V) and FF (56%) but lower Jsc of 6.95 mA cm−2 compared with the PQTE-based devices. It is noteworthy that a PCE of 3.90% is among the highest efficiencies reported for quinacridone-based polymers via a simple device architecture without any additives or post-treatments, which is a unique property of PQTE. In Fig. 4b, high photo-to-current responses were obtained in the range from 350 to 600 nm for two polymer/PC71BM blend films. For PQTE-based devices, the higher response verified the higher Jsc value, which supports the results from J–V characteristics.

Film morphology and microstructure in the solar cells
The morphology of active layers was examined by bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and AFM, respectively. In Fig. 5a, well distributed nano-fibrillar structures are observed in PQTE/PC71BM blend films. This interpenetrating network is beneficial for charge dissociation.35 For PQ2T-based devices, macrophase separation limits the probability of exciton dissociation leading to poor Jsc (Fig. 5b). In addition, the results of AFM images (Fig. S6†) reveal that the grains in PQTE/PC71BM blend films are fairly homogeneous in size and shape. However, the PQ2T/PC71BM blend film shows large aggregates and the size is about 200–300 nm, indicating the poor dispersion of PC71BM in the polymer matrix. We note that the pure film of PQTE shows a higher degree of crystallinity and order than the film of PQ2T. What is more, the polymer chains are closer than those of PQ2T. However, PQTE unexpectedly exhibits better miscibility with PC71BM while the PQ2T/PC71BM blend film is apt to aggregate into large domains. This result could be explained by using DFT calculation and the experimental data collected from 2D-GIXRD of blend films. In blend films, thiophene–vinylene–thiophene (TVT) or bithiophene (BT) as a donor unit in a polymer backbone would interact with electro-deficient PC71BM via electrostatic interaction. In consideration of the length of donor units (Fig. 5c), a TVT unit with a length of 9.0 Å is larger than the size of PC71BM (7.2–8.0 Å),36 which provides enough volume to accommodate the fullerene molecules. In contrast, a short BT unit (6.5 Å) would expel the fullerene resulting in self-aggregation of polymer chains and large domains of PC71BM.37 This is further confirmed by the results of 2D-GIXRD. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3,† in PQTE/PC71BM blend film, the lamellar distance shows 2.5 Å larger than that of the polymer-only film. The significant increase indicates that PC71BM molecules probably intercalate on the crystal lattice of PQTE because of sufficient volume.38 In contrast, the lamellar distance of the PQ2T/PC71BM blend film exhibits negligible increases of 0.2 Å compared with the polymer-only film, suggesting that PC71BM molecules cannot intercalate well on PQ2T. As a result, good intercalation of PC71BM into the lamellar structure of PQTE is responsible for this high PCE.

Conclusions
We synthesized a novel quinacridone-based polymer, PQTE, containing a thiophene–vinylene–thiophene unit. PQ2T without a vinylene linkage was also synthesized for comparison. As a result, the incorporation of a vinylene linkage can efficiently shorten the π–π stacking distance and improve the crystallinity of thin films. In TFTs, a strong intermolecular interaction of PQTE enhances the charge carrier mobility up to 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1. In solar cells, a high PCE of 3.9% was obtained by using PQTE as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor while PQ2T-based devices showed a moderate PCE of 2.70%. It is noteworthy that high PCE was obtained without any additives or post-treatments. Better miscibility was observed in PQTE/PC71BM blend films compared with that of PQ2T/PC71BM blend films although strong interchain interaction existed in the polymer PQTE. We suppose that good intercalation of PC71BM into the lamellar structure of PQTE is responsible for this high PCE. Our findings indicate that a rational molecular modification makes quinacridone a promising building block for application in high-performance optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and (E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2-yl)ethene were purchased from SunaTech Inc. and used without further purification. All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Number-average and weight-average were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Waters 515 chromatograph connected to a Waters 2410 refractive index detector, using THF as the eluent and polystyrene standards as the calibrants. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were recorded by using a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a nitrogen flow, heated from room temperature to 800 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed using a METTLER TOLEDO Instrument with a DSC822 calorimeter. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum working electrode coated with a thin film layer of the polymer, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode with ferrocenium–ferrocene (Fc+–Fc) as the internal standard. Tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was investigated with a Bruker Multimode 8 using a tapping mode with a scan speed of 1 Hz. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM-2011 operated at 100 kV. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data were obtained at 1W1A, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The films were illuminated at a constant incidence angle of 0.2° (λ = 2dsinθ = 1.5464 Å).

Synthesis of PQTE. 
Monomer QA2Br (150 mg, 0.131 mmol) and (E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2-yl)ethene (68 mg, 0.131 mmol) were added into a Schlenk tube and subsequently dissolved in 6 mL degassed chlorobenzene. The solution was degassed before Pd2(dba)3 (2.4 mg, 0.003 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (6.4 mg, 0.021 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was further degassed and subsequently sealed. The solution was heated and stirred at 130 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was added to vigorously stirred methanol and filtered. The resulting precipitate was purified by Soxhlet extraction successively with methanol, acetone, hexane, and finally with chloroform, and then precipitated in methanol again. The polymer PQTE was obtained as a purple solid (167 mg, 78%).


Synthesis of PQ2T. 
A procedure similar to that described above was used to synthesize PQ2T (171 mg, 80%).

General procedure for devices fabrication

OFET devices fabrication and characterization. 
Bottom-gate/top-contact FET devices were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates. First, the substrates were cleaned and treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The polymer solution in chlorobenzene (6 mg mL−1) was spin coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 50 s to obtain a film with thickness of ∼35 nm. The samples were further placed on a hot plate at 150 °C in N2 for 30 min. Gold source and drain electrodes (60 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the organic layer through a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and width (W) were 30 μm and 500 μm, respectively. OFETs were determined at room temperature in air by using a Keithley 4200 SCS (semiconductor characterization system). The mobility of the OTFTs in the saturation region was extracted from the following equation: IDS = Ciμ(W/2L)(VG − VT)2, where IDS is the drain current, Ci is the capacitance of the SiO2 dielectric layer (Ci = 10 nF cm−2), μ is field-effect hole mobility, VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.


Fabrication and characterization of OPV devices. 
For conventional devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/PC71BM/Ca/Al, the ITO substrates were cleaned and exposed to 30 min UV/O3 treatment, and then PEDOT:PSS (2000 rpm for 30 min) was spin-coated and subsequently subjected to thermal annealing treatment at 150 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the chlorobenzene solution of the polymer/PC71BM mixture was spin-coated at a speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then the Ca/Al cathode was successively deposited on the photoactive layer by vacuum evaporation (20 nm/80 nm). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The measurements were conducted under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. EQE measurements were carried out using an oriel IQE 200 (Newport).
