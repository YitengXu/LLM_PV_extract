    , Accepted 14th August 2020First published on 15th August 2020AbstractAlkali ion (Cs+, Rb+ and K+) incorporated hybrid perovskite polycrystalline films have shown great potential for obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. A study on the intrinsic influence of different alkali ions on perovskites is urgently needed to gain insights into the optoelectronic performance improvement. Single crystals with fewer defects can be ideal candidates for the study of intrinsic properties. Herein, for the first time, we prepared a series of perovskite (FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45) single crystals with Cs+, Rb+, and K+ cascade doping using the “inverse temperature crystallization” method and systematically characterized their structure and optoelectronic properties, as well as phase, humidity and thermal stability. Our work highlights the structure–property relationship, that is, diversified A-site occupation (especially the FAMACsRb system) can significantly promote the carrier transport behavior of perovskites, as well as achieving better thermal and humidity stability, while K+ doping degrades the intrinsic properties of perovskites, which is probably due to the interstitial occupation of K+. These findings deepen the understanding of the influence of alkali ion doping on the intrinsic properties of perovskite materials, which will provide an exemplary paradigm for further exploration.
Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic perovskite (ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation, such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+) or Cs+; B is a divalent cation, normally Pb2+ or Sn2+; and X is a halide ion, e.g. Cl−, Br−, or I−) solar cells (PSCs) has reached 25.2%, which mainly originates from perovskite component optimization, process engineering, device structure adjustment, additive engineering, etc.1–5 In particular, alkali metal ion (Cs, Rb, K, etc.) doping has shown great potential for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs, by either acting as a perovskite composition or serving as an additive. Previous studies have shown that the main purpose of doping with alkali ions is to achieve the following effects:
(1) To interfere the carrier behavior in the material. For example, Saliba et al. doped Rb into (FA, MA, Cs)Pb(I, Br)3 perovskites and proved that the density of defect states was greatly reduced and non-radiative recombination was suppressed.6 Hu et al. studied the effect of Cs and Rb doping on the carrier transport and defects in the polycrystalline perovskite films, which had fewer defects, large carrier mobility, and thus the high stable output power of the devices.7 With regard to K ion doping, Park et al. speculated that the formation energy of interstitial K was small due to its smaller ion radius, which inhibited the formation of Frankel I− defects and reduced the hysteresis.8 Abdi-Jalebi et al. demonstrated substantial mitigation of both non-radiative losses and photoinduced ion migration in perovskite films and interfaces by decorating the Cs0.06FA0.79MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 surfaces and grain boundaries with passivating KI layers.9
(2) To improve the material stability. On one hand, Cs and Rb can partially replace the A-site ions to participate in the lattice, which can improve the phase stability of the formamidinium (FA) based perovskite. On the other hand, appropriate amounts of K and Na, as interstitial ions, can improve the stability by blocking the ion migration channel and reduce the device hysteresis.8,10,11 For instance, Lee et al. firstly studied the stability of (FA, Cs)PbI3 and found that the phase stability of the perovskite film against illumination and moisture was significantly improved when 10% of FA was replaced by Cs, which was attributed to the enhanced interaction between FA and iodide due to the contraction of the cubo-octahedral volume.10 Meanwhile, Zhou et al. introduced Cs into a FA-based perovskite in a two-step method and obtained largely improved phase stability of polycrystalline perovskite films.12 Furthermore, the MA-free (FA, Cs, Rb)PbI3 perovskite system developed by Turrencruz et al. exhibited excellent stability due to improved crystal quality and the stability of the composition itself.13
(3) To adjust the film quality and crystal orientation. Many works have shown that alkali ions will participate in and affect the crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. For instance, Chang et al. found that Na or K doping could increase the grain size of the perovskite film, thus improving the charge carrier lifetime.14 Zheng et al. reported a controllable approach to manipulate the facet orientation within ABX3 hybrid perovskite polycrystalline films by cation cascade doping at the A-site, which was found to facilitate photocarrier transport across the absorber and pertaining interface in the resultant device.15
Despite the aforementioned progress, most studies were conducted on perovskite polycrystalline films to improve the stability and efficiency of the resulting devices. However, the defects in polycrystalline films are difficult to decouple to understand the intrinsic properties of alkali ion-doped perovskites. Compared to polycrystalline films, single crystals are regarded as the best platform to reflect the intrinsic properties of materials for fundamental understanding due to its low defect density and simple structure. Up to now, there has been a lack of understanding of the effect of alkali ion doping on perovskite single crystals, and it is worth establishing a correlation between doping ions and the intrinsic properties of perovskite materials.
In this work, we synthesized a series of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 single crystals with cascade doping of a series of alkali ions and systematically characterized the effect of these ions on the optoelectronic and stability properties of perovskites. First of all, we determined the exact content of alkali metal ions in each single crystal. Furthermore, we found that all single crystals belonged to the simple cubic phase in the temperature range from 180 K to 360 K, except the FAMACsRbK perovskite which changed to a body-centered cubic phase at 180 K. However, their carrier dynamics varied dramatically. Compared to FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (FAMA) single crystals, the alkali ion doped ones exhibit fewer defects and improved carrier lifetime and mobility. Interestingly, CsRb and Cs doping led to single crystals outperforming those with CsRbK doping. Moreover, the CsRb doped single crystals possessed the best moisture and thermal stability. An in-depth study revealed that the alkali ions occupied different sites of the perovskite lattice, which mainly contributed to the variation in the properties of materials. Simply, with richer occupant diversity at A-sites (CsRb), the improvement in the properties of materials was greater, but the interstitial occupants of alkali cations (K) will degrade the performance of materials. The mechanism of K doping effects is discussed in detail. The understanding about the influence of alkali doping on the intrinsic properties of materials sheds light on the application of perovskites in various optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers and photodetectors.
Results and discussion
The Cs, Rb, and K cascade doped FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 single crystals in this work were simply marked as FAMACs, FAMACsRb, and FAMACsRbK, respectively. Due to the retrograde solubility of the perovskite in the γ-butyrolactone solvent, we adopted the “inverse temperature crystallization” method to synthesize the single crystals as shown in Fig. 1a and introduced Cs, Rb, and K cations through the addition of KI, RbI and CsI compounds to maintain a constant ratio of I/Br in precursor solutions.16,17 After forming the single crystal seeds by continuously heating the solutions, we lifted the solution temperature by 1 °C at an interval of 1 h. Since the nucleation consumed solutes and then reduced the supersaturation of the solution and the growth speed of crystals, increasing the temperature during the growth process could provide enough supersaturation and supply the solutes timely, which accelerated the growth process and improved the quality of the single crystals. More growth details can be found in the Experimental section.

The photos of various single crystals (Fig. 1b–e) showed that they had an average size of ∼3 mm with uniform size distribution. All crystals were black with regular rhombic dodecahedron shapes, indicating the availability of the inverse temperature crystallization method. Most importantly, this phenomenon suggested that the involvement of alkali ions had no dramatic impact on the nucleation and growth process of FAMA single crystals.
We first performed a detailed characterization of its actual alkali metal ion content through inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The ratio of each alkali ion to Pb determined via ICP-AES is shown in Table 1. In order to eliminate the influence of surface residues, the newly prepared crystals were washed three times with γ-butyrolactone before the test.

The actual content of Cs was about 4.1%, which was close to the feed ratio in the precursor. Due to the mismatched ion radius, the actual doping contents of Rb and K was very low (∼0.1%), but not zero, which indicated that the cascade doping method could introduce a small amount of Rb or K into the bulk perovskite. In contrast, Rb could hardly be detected in FAMARb samples (only Rb doped, see the Experimental section for details). However, the actual positions occupied by different alkali metal ions in the perovskite lattice may be different, which will be discussed later.
To further demonstrate the phase evolution of single crystals, we performed single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization at different temperatures. The (0kl) diffraction patterns of single crystals at room temperature (∼300 K) are shown in Fig. 1f–i, and the corresponding patterns at low (180 K) and high (360 K) temperatures are shown in Fig. 1j–m and n–q, respectively. The diffraction patterns of all single crystals were clear, indicating the high quality of single crystals. Previous studies have shown that the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite single crystal would change from a cubic phase to a tetragonal phase when the temperature was reduced from room temperature to 255–285 K.18 However, our results indicated that the FAMA single crystals always maintained a pure cubic phase at various temperatures (Fig. 1f, j and n). This may be related to the 15% bromine substitution in the composition, which led to a stabilizing effect on the cubic phase due to the reduced defect density.19 In addition, both FAMACs and FAMACsRb single crystals maintained the pure cubic phase at all temperatures, further proving that Cs and CsRb doped perovskites obtained good phase and thermal cycling stability. However, the FAMACsRbK perovskite maintained a cubic phase at 300 K and 360 K, while it changed to a body-centered cubic phase at 180 K, indicating the phase instability associated with K ion doping. We speculated that K ions actually occupied interstitial sites instead of A-sites due to the unmatched ionic radius of K ions to accommodate the A-site occupation, which led to phase instability. The effect of interstitial K ions will be discussed further below.
In order to observe the effect of Cs, Rb, K cascade doping on the perovskite lattice constant, we ground the single crystals and performed powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. The normalized PXRD data are shown in Fig. 2, and the diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 20.0°, 24.6°, 28.4°, 31.87°, and 35.0° (Fig. 2a) were assigned to the (001), (011), (111), (002), (012), and (112) crystal planes20 of the cubic phase perovskites, respectively. We then selected the peak of the (012) plane centered at 31.8–32° to analyze the peak position shift in detail (Fig. 2b). The positions of the (012) peak corresponding to FAMA, FAMACs, FAMACsRb, and FAMACsRbK were 31.85°, 31.89°, 31.91°, and 31.90°, respectively, which clearly indicated that the decrease of the lattice constant in cascade doped single crystals followed the sequence from FAMA through FAMACs to FAMACsRb.

It was also observed that the peak shift from the FAMACs to FAMACsRb is smaller than that from the FAMA to the FAMACs sample, which indicated that Cs could be easily incorporated into the lattice of the FAMA sample to significantly reduce the perovskite lattice constant, while Rb could only partially enter the lattice and occupy the A-site so that the peak shift tendency upon Rb doping was decreased. Further analyzing FAMACsRbK, we found that the corresponding lattice constant did not decrease further, which indicated that K cannot substitute the A-site within the perovskite lattice due to its very small size. We speculated that K may be incorporated into the lattice in the form of interstitial ions, which affected the carrier behavior of perovskites as shown in the following characterizations.8Fig. 2c shows the possible occupation of different alkali metal ions in the FAMA based crystal lattice.
We characterized the optoelectronic properties of single crystals by measuring their UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. It can be seen from Fig. 3a that the absorption band edge was located at 820 nm, which was about 50 nm red-shifted compared to the PL peak position. This anti-Stokes shift was always observed in perovskite crystals with a certain thickness, which was caused by below-bandgap absorption.21 Thus, the absorption spectrum of the single crystals cannot reflect its optical band gap well. At the same time, PL always originated from the direct band gap. Therefore, for perovskite single crystals, PL was a more reliable method to determine the optical band gap due to the existence of a large anti-Stokes shift. The PL emission peaks of FAMA, FAMACs, FAMACsRb, and FAMACsRbK single crystals were located at 762 nm, 765 nm, 767 nm, and 768 nm, and the corresponding band gaps were 1.627, 1.621, 1.617 and 1.615 eV, respectively. This red-shift along with the Cs, Rb, K cascade doping indicated the reduced bandgap of the corresponding single crystals. It is generally recognized that, for a hybrid ABX3 perovskite, the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are mainly composed of Pb 6p orbitals, hybrid orbitals of Pb 6s and X 5p, respectively.22 However, the size of A-site ions can still affect the orbital overlap of Pb and X, then result in the band gap variations of perovskites. Therefore, we speculated that the small amount of Cs, Rb, K cascade doping induced the shrinkage of the crystal lattice (Fig. 2b), thus increasing the overlap of Pb and X and then decreasing the band gap.23

The TRPL spectra of single crystals are shown in Fig. 3b, and the carrier lifetime values extracted from the bi-exponentially fitted TRPL spectra are listed in Table 2. The short lifetime (τ1) corresponds to the surface recombination process, where the surface traps assisted the carrier recombination.24 The long lifetime (τ2) resulted from the bulk recombination process, in which an electron from the CBM recombined with a hole from the VBM.25 The long τ1 and τ2 indicated low surface defects and the high quality of single crystals. Compared to FAMA single crystals with τ1 = 16.30 ns and τ2 = 971.67 ns, both τ1 and τ2 greatly improved in FAMACsRb and FAMACs single crystals (FAMACs: τ1 = 24.13 ns, τ2 = 1832.52 ns; FAMACsRb: τ1 = 29.14 ns, τ2 = 1739.20 ns), while the FAMACsRbK single crystals exhibited shorter τ1 = 10.55 ns and longer τ2 = 1537.31 ns. In addition, the proportions of the τ1 and τ2 components in FAMA were 77% and 23%, respectively, indicating strong surface non-radiative recombination. The proportion of the τ1 component decreased from 77% to 74%/70% after the Cs/CsRb doping, while that of FAMACsRbK rose to 80%. It was concluded that Cs, Rb cascade doping could improve the bulk quality of single crystals, among which the FAMACsRb and FAMACs single crystals exhibited the highest carrier lifetime, which was in line with a previous work wherein alkali metal ions were doped into polycrystalline perovskite thin films.7 Meanwhile, longer τ1 and a lower proportion of τ1 in FAMACsRb and FAMACs single crystals suggested that surface defect recombination was effectively inhibited in these samples, which may be due to the better defect passivation of Cs and Rb. Compared with Cs and CsRb, the cascade doping of K ions weakened both τ1 and τ2, which fully proved that interstitial doping will have a negative impact on the carrier lifetime.

In addition, in order to understand the influence of the alkali metal ion cascade doping on the microstructure of perovskites, we performed X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterizations on the FAMACs and FAMACsRb single crystals. The experimental details are shown in the characterization section. XANES is useful in identifying the chemical state of the absorbing element and hence inferring its chemical species. For FAMACs and FAMACsRb, the Pb L3 edge energy positions (E0 = 13035.0 eV) were not changed as shown in Fig. 3c, which indicated that there were no detectable changes in the oxidation state of Pb(II) in these two samples. Furthermore, the fine structure from the X-ray absorption spectra in the high energy range (beyond the ionization potential) is a powerful tool to determine the chemical environment such as interatomic distances.26,27 Thus, based on the R space EXAFS data (Fig. 3d), we could conclude that FAMACs and FAMACsRb have the same local coordination structure around Pb sites. Therefore, the microstructure of alkali metal ion doped perovskites showed no visible difference, which excluded the possible interaction between alkali metal ions and Pb ions.
To explore the effect of Cs, Rb, K cascade doping on the carrier mobility of perovskite single crystals, we performed space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement. The dark J–V curves were obtained based on the ITO/NiOx/perovskite single crystal/Au structure. The trap density (ntrap) and mobility (μ) were estimated according to the equations: JD = 9εε0μV2/8L3 and VTFL = entL2/2εε0, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the measured and calculated results for all single crystals. It can be seen that the mobility of FAMA single crystals approached 21.69 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was consistent with our previous reports,28 while the mobility values of Cs, CsRb, and CsRbK doped perovskite single crystals were 41.69 cm2 V−1 s−1, 46.43 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 36.21 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The enhanced mobility and reduced trap density for Cs, Rb, K cascade doped perovskites implied the higher quality of the corresponding single crystals, which was in accordance with our TRPL results.

Based on these results, we speculated that FAMACsRb and FAMACs single crystals were of higher quality compared to FAMA, and we attribute this to the contraction of the cubo-octahedral volume upon Cs and Rb doping, which in turn enhanced the interaction between A-site ions and iodide and greatly reduced the trap density. However, although FAMACsRb single crystals exhibited the highest carrier mobility which was consistent with the results of the CsRb doped polycrystalline films,7 we still argue that there is some difference between the published results and our work: although the doped Rb ions mainly located at the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline film, the doping of Rb in single crystals (without GBs) still improved the corresponding carrier mobility, indicating that Rb could also play a positive role in the perovskite bulk through partial A-site substitution. The stable cubic phase and large carrier mobility of the CsRb doped perovskite system highlight the potential application in fabricating high-efficiency PSCs. Unexpectedly, K cascade doping significantly reduced the carrier mobility compared to FAMACs and FAMACsRb, which was not consistent with the trend observed in polycrystalline films in previous reports.9,14 The results based on the single crystal platform fully indicated that interstitial doping will decrease the carrier mobility of the perovskite, but K ions may have a passivating effect on the interface and grain boundaries of the polycrystalline film, so their overall effect is positive.
For further application of perovskite materials toward commercialization, the highly-efficient PSCs should also have the competitively intrinsic stability of the absorber. To characterize the humidity and thermal stability of alkali metal ion doped perovskites, we measured the PXRD data after heating the single crystal powders at 300 °C under 85% relative humidity (RH) for 5 min (Fig. 5a). The intensity of the perovskite (001) diffraction peak was normalized to compare the relative content of the secondary phase (PbI2). For freshly prepared single crystals, the signal of PbI2 was absent (Fig. 2a); however, PbI2 emerged in all aged single crystals at 300 °C under 85% RH for 5 min, indicating the partial decomposition of perovskites after humidity and thermal stressors.

(c) Diagram of the proposed mechanism of alkali ion doping, which improves the humidity and thermal stability of the perovskite. 
Furthermore, we used the ratio of the (001) peak intensity of PbI2 at 12.7° compared to the (001) peak intensity of the perovskite at 14.1° to quantify the decomposition degree of the single crystal (Fig. 5b). The FAMA single crystal exhibited the most severe decomposition, with the ratio of PbI2/perovskite reaching 12%. Fortunately, all alkali metal ion doped single crystals could effectively suppress the decomposition of perovskites. Among them, FAMACsRb showed the best resistance to humidity and heat, and the PbI2/perovskite ratio was only 3%. The other two kinds of perovskite single crystals, FAMACsRbK and FAMACs, had relatively poor resistance to heat and humidity, with keeping the PbI2/perovskite ratio at 5% and 7%, respectively. Specifically, the doped Cs and Rb could occupy the A-site and reduce the intrinsic defect (most of which were vacancy defects) density of single crystals, which was proved by our SCLC measurement.29,30 Combining with the reported results,31,32 we reasonably speculated that vacancy defects are important channels for water molecules invading the perovskite single crystals, so FAMACs and FAMACsRb with fewer vacancy defects and tighter lattices exhibited significantly improved moisture and heat resistance stability. The diagram of the proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 5c. On the contrary, the cascade doping of CsRbK reduced the resistance to moisture and heat. According to previous studies, we attributed this phenomenon to the microstrain increase caused by a small amount of K ions which occupied the interstitial sites of the perovskite crystal.15 Overall, the FAMACsRb perovskite exhibits excellent humidity and thermal stability, as well as the best carrier performance, which ensure its greater prospect of wide application.
Conclusion
We systematically synthesized FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 single crystals doped with Cs+, Rb+, and K+ in a cascade manner to analyze their collective and individual impacts on the intrinsic properties of the perovskite. The results revealed that the cascade doping of alkali ions with a smaller size could reduce the lattice constant and shrink the energy band gap. With various characterizations, it was found that the optoelectronic and carrier transport properties were improved profoundly upon CsRb and Cs cation doping, while the effect is reduced upon CsRbK doping. Among all perovskite single crystals, the FAMACsRb perovskite exhibited the best stability in courses of humidity and thermal stressors. We explain these differences in the structure–property relationship. Diversified occupants at the A-site will improve the intrinsic properties of the perovskite, while additional interstitials such as K-interstitials will degrade the properties of materials. It thus suggests the introduction of A-site doping with a rational design of materials to avoid the occurrence of extra interstitial defects. This understanding about the intrinsic properties of perovskites doped using alkali ions may shed light on further applications of hybrid halide perovskites with alkali doping.

K0.05(Rb0.05(Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95)0.95)PbI2.55Br0.45 single crystals. 
Except for the different molar ratios of KI, RbI, CsI, FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 and the different initial heating temperature (87 °C), the remaining procedure was the same as that used to obtain FAMA single crystals. The product was marked as FAMACsRbK single crystals.

Characterization
The test samples for inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Prodigy 7-Leeman) were obtained by dissolving a certain amount of perovskite single crystals in 5% nitric acid solutions. The actual concentrations measured are shown in the table below.

In order to compare with cascade doping, we also tested the actual content of Rb in samples doped with Rb (5%) only. Compared with the FAMACsRb sample, Rb could hardly be detected in the FAMARb sample. The results confirmed the effectiveness of cascade doping.
Single crystal X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by measuring the single crystal particles at different temperatures (180 K, 300 K, and 360 K) using a single crystal X-ray diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.071073 nm). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data of single crystals were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX-2400 diffractometer. The absorption of perovskite single crystal particles was measured using an UH4150 UV-Visible/NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of single crystal particles were characterized using an FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd), and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained using a 470 nm excitation wavelength. We measured the dark current–voltage curves of Au/perovskite/Au devices using a Keithley 4200 system to calculate the mobility of single crystals according to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model. Both sides of the single crystal sheets cleaved from large particles were deposited using an 80 nm Au layer to form the hole-only device. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy at the Pb L3 (E0 = 13035.0 eV) edge was performed at the BL14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) operated at 3.5 GeV in the “top-up” mode with a constant current of 200 mA. The XAFS data were recorded in the transmission mode using Oxford ion chambers. The energy was calibrated according to the absorption edge of pure Pb foil. Athena and Artemis codes were used to extract the data and fit the profiles.
