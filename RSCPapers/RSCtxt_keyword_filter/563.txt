    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 27th October 2022AbstractHigh-performance electrocatalysts with cost-effectiveness are the key to advances in the areas of energy conversion and storage. To achieve this, nitrogen doped carbon supported iron-doped titanium nitride nanoparticles (TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst) were prepared and optimized as a cathode catalyst for Zn–air batteries. The optimized Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst display remarkable activity and durability for the ORR, which even surpassed those of Pt/C. The Zn–air battery assembled with the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C air-cathode presents a high maximum power density and possesses a specific capacity comparable to that of Pt/C. The remarkable performance was attributed to the introduction of the Fe dopant into the lattice of TiN, which can promote the graphitization degree of carbon matrices indirectly, optimize the particle size of TiN nanoparticles, and mediate the relative percentage of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N. More importantly, the electronic structure and active sites were modulated, the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step decreased in the ORR process by doping Fe ions, and therefore improves the ORR activity and Zn–air battery performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst as a substitute for the commercial Pt/C catalyst in energy conversion devices.
1. Introduction
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a vital reaction in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies such as metal–air batteries and fuel cells.1–3 Unfortunately, the sluggish kinetics of the cathode reactions of the ORR is a major barrier for the commercialization of Zn–air batteries.4,5 To date, the most efficient and widely employed ORR catalysts are noble metal-based catalysts, for instance, Pt/C exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic activity.6,7 Extensive research on low-cost non-precious metal catalysts with desirable ORR performance has been inspired by the prohibitive cost and scarcity of precious metals. Transition metal-based materials have generally been regarded as the most promising substitutes for noble metal-based catalysts among the many alternative non-precious metal catalysts, which include transition metal nitrides,8 hydroxides,9–11 sulfides,12–14 and phosphides.15 In particular, titanium nitride (TiN), with a similar electronic structure to precious metals, has drawn considerable research attention due to its prospective applications as electrocatalysts, solar cells, fuel cells, and so on. Notably, TiN as a material with high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, great hardness, corrosion resistance and electrochemical durability has been reported as a catalyst support, which increases the electron transfer rate during the catalytic process.16–19 However, titanium nitride's intrinsic ORR activity is poor. The performance of the ORR can be improved by combining titanium nitride with other substances or by introducing another transition metal to TiN.
The use of material composites can be a valid strategy for boosting ORR's catalytic activity. The improved electrical conductivity of TiN-based composites and the particular catalyst–support synergistic interaction have been identified to accelerate the ORR kinetics, hence enhancing the ORR catalysis of the composites. In particular, the employment of other transition metals with the iron-based catalyst allows for the reduction of the incredibly high energy barrier for the elimination of the O* intermediate thanks to quantum dot heterostructures, implying that improved electrocatalytic performances for the ORR are anticipated from such quantum dot heterostructures.20–22 Fu et al. loaded carbon nanotubes with Fe3C–TiN heterostructure quantum dots (FCTN@CNTs) that display higher ORR performance comparable to Pt/C (Eonset 1.06 and E1/2 0.95 V) in alkaline medium, which is ascribed to the heterostructure interface between TiN and Fe3C.23 The outstanding ORR activity of the Fe–N–CNS composite created by Li et al. was owing to the increased specific surface area and synergistic promotion of evenly dispersed TiN on Fe–N–CNS.24
Notably, doping d-electron-rich transition metals into catalytic materials is an appealing modification strategy for improving electrocatalytic performance. An excellent catalyst should be able to dissociate O2, but the basis of dissociation is for catalysts to supply electrons for the dissociation of O2 in the form of chemisorption. However, various catalytic materials are limited in their ability to dissociate O2 due to a lack of d electrons, which further restricts the catalytic activity of the ORR. By doping transition metals with enriched d-electrons, it is possible to cause the enrichment of d electrons in the intrinsic materials and accelerate the reaction kinetics. In addition, newly created active sites for O2 adsorption may also be produced as a result of doping, increasing the number of O2 dissociation active sites, which may also increase ORR activity.25 As reported, Wang et al. tuned the d-band center by transition metal doping to provide the superior HER activity of Co4N. Yao et al. showed that through doping Cr to Co4N, remarkable HER catalytic activity under alkaline conditions was achieved. Additionally, Tian et al. demonstrated that Ni doping increases the catalytic activity and durability of the ORR. Xia's group optimized the doping level of Co to synthesize the Ti0.8Co0.2N catalytic material, demonstrating outstanding ORR performance.26–29 Although numerous previous studies have demonstrated that heteroatom doping could regulate the structure of titanium nitride for tuning the ORR activity, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Herein, iron-doped titanium nitride nanoparticles highly dispersed on the nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst (TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst) as a highly effective Zn–air battery cathode catalyst were prepared and optimized. The results show that iron-doping can modulate the structure of titanium nitride nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon and tailor the electronic structure of TiN, which is beneficial for decreasing the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step and improving the ORR activity. As expected, the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst displayed enhanced activity and excellent durability. The Zn–air battery assembled with the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C air-cathode possesses a higher open circuit voltage, a maximum power density, and a specific capacity similar to that of Pt/C.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of catalysts
In typical synthesis, 2 g poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (P123) was added to 8 ml titanium isopropanolate (TTIP) and stirred overnight to form a homogeneous solution. The above homogeneous solution was solely dropped into an ethanol solution (64 mL) which contains 1.2 ml HCl (38%) under stirring. After 10 min, 8 mL 1.4 mM FeSO4·4H2O solution was poured into the above-mentioned mixture, which was then agitated for 12 hours at 40 °C. 6 g of DCDA was introduced afterward, and the precursor was obtained by drying at 45 °C while stirring. Finally, the precursor was heated at a rate of 5 °C per minute for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmosphere at 800 °C to pyrolyze it. The Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC materials were collected after naturally cooling down to room temperature. Lastly, the target catalyst (Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C) was obtained by 1:1 ball milling of the prepared catalyst and conductive carbon. For comparison, the TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst with different iron concentrations was prepared by changing the concentration of the FeSO4 solution.
2.2 Electrochemical measurements
At room temperature, all electrocatalytic tests were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation employing a three-electrode system. As the working electrode, a rotating disk electrode (RDE) composed of glassy carbon was uniformly coated with a TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst, while the counter and reference electrodes were made of Pt foil and an Ag/AgCl electrode. In this investigation, all potential measurements were converted to potential vs. RHE using cyclic voltammetry in an H2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 from −1.1 to −0.7 V (Fig. S3†). The average value of the current passing through the zero potential twice is taken as the calibration value (0.9565 V). The working electrode was created by ultrasonically blending 5 mg of catalyst with 0.6 ml of deionized water, 0.4 ml of ethanol, and 0.05 ml of Nafion to create a homogeneous ink. A mass loading of 0.36 mg cm−2 of the catalysts (Fig. S4†) and 72.9 μgPt cm−2 of Pt/C were applied to the glassy-carbon electrode using the catalyst ink. RDE measurements were performed in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 to assess the ORR activities of the catalysts.
2.3 Zn–air battery
The Zn–air battery was assembled with a 1 mm polished zinc plate (≥99.9%) employed as an anode and an air cathode with 1 mg cm−2 catalysts coated on the carbon paper. A cellulose membrane was sandwiched between the electrodes to avoid the H2O2 diffusing to the anode and the 6 M KOH solution to the electrodes. Battery tests were performed on a LAND CT2001A tester at room temperature. The long-term galvanostatic discharge was conducted at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.
2.4 DFT calculations
GGA-level spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) utilizing a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 450 eV. To represent the electron exchange and correlation, the Perdew–Wang (PW91) functional was employed. The electrical and geometric convergence criteria were 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV, respectively. According to the established computational model, TiN and Ti0.95Fe0.05N catalysts are supported on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate with a vacuum layer thickness of 15 Å. All atoms are permitted to relax during the geometric optimization process. To imitate the genuine adsorption process, only the surface and subsurface atoms are released during the calculation, while the bottom atoms are fixed. The four associative reaction steps were considered when calculating ORR activity.ΔG1: O2(g) + H+ + e− + * → OOH*ΔG2: OOH* + H+ + e− → O* + H2O(l)ΔG3: O* + H+ + e− + → OH*ΔG4: OH* + H+ + e− + * → H2O(l) + *The ORR overpotential was obtained using a reaction energy diagram, drawn with the following eqn (1). ΔG(U) = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS + neU(1)where ΔE is the reaction energy, ΔZPE is the zero-point energy correction, ΔS is the change in entropy, ne is the number of electrons, and U is the applied potential.
Moreover, the onset potential was calculated using the following eqn (2): Uonset = −max(ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4)(2)where Uonset is the onset potential.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the catalysts
To analyze the structural characteristics of the as-made catalysts, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained and are illustrated in Fig. 1a. The major diffraction peaks of the as-made catalysts are well ascribed to the face-centered cubic (FCC) TiN (PDF # 38-1420). Interestingly, the TiN diffraction peaks shifted to higher degrees (Fig. 1b), confirming the slight decrease in the lattice spacing. The fact that Fe has a smaller ionic radius than Ti may have caused compression of the unit cell parameters.30 And no peak related to metal iron or iron nitride could be seen in the XRD patterns of the catalysts with varied Fe contents. This obviously demonstrated that TiN was successfully prepared and Ti ions were replaced by Fe ions in the face-centered cubic structure of TiN. Besides that, the diffraction peak at 25.9° was assigned to graphitic carbon.31 Raman analysis, which has a high sensitivity to crystallinity and microstructure, can offer precise details about the molecular interactions and chemical structure of TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 1c, the Raman pattern of all the as-made catalysts contains three peaks: the O–Ti–O type bending vibration is represented by the Eg peaks at 145 cm−1, while the peaks at 390 cm−1 and 615 cm−1 correspond to B1g for the perpendicular vibrations of the Ti atomic planes and A1g for the optical modes of TiN, respectively.32–34 Notably, the increased intensity and blue shift of the titanium vibrational modes indicate the increase of nitrogen vacancies; likewise, the nitrogen vibrational modes indicate the presence of titanium vacancies.35 Typical D (around 1360 cm−1) and G (1590 cm−1) bands, which represent the structural defects of sp3 hybridization and the graphitized carbon of sp2 hybridization were both observed for all of the as-made catalysts as shown in Fig. 1d.36 The ID/IG peak intensity ratios can be utilized to assess the carbon defects and degree of graphitization. Specifically, the ID/IG ratio of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C is higher than the other prepared catalysts, demonstrating that it has the highest degree of graphitization as well as excellent electrical conductivity and stability,37,38 which is beneficial for improving electron transfer in the ORR process.

FESEM, TEM and HRTEM were employed to characterize the structure and morphology of the as-made catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2a and S1,† the interconnected sphere-like structure is well retained on the TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalysts without noticeable changes after introducing Fe ions. The nanoparticles are distributed on the carbon matrices (Fig. 2b and d and S2†), and the particle size in Ti0.95Fe0.5N/NC/C catalysts is about 34.65 nm, which is smaller than that in TiN/NC/C catalysts (36.75 nm). The nanoparticles and carbon matrices constitute the N-doped carbon and carbon as revealed by the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(c, e and f)). The lattice spacing of nanoparticles in TiN/NC/C and Ti0.95Fe0.5N/NC/C catalysts is 0.215 nm and 0.220 nm, respectively, corresponding to the FCC TiN (2 0 0) crystal plane. The change in lattice spacing may be attributed to lattice distortion caused by Fe introduction, which is consistent with the XRD analysis. The elemental distribution of the area in Fig. 2g was illustrated according to TEM-EDS elemental mapping analysis. The carbon element is distributed in the whole network structure, and the signal strength of nitrogen is also detected, illustrating that nitrogen atoms are doped into the framework of carbon. As we designed, the signal intensity of iron in this area is related to the distribution of titanium. Combined with the XRD results, it is found that iron doped into TiN successfully.

3.2 ORR performance of the catalysts
The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves obtained by a rotating disk electrode (RDE) test. The CV curves of the as-prepared catalysts in N2-saturated and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions are shown in Fig. S5,† all catalysts show well-defined cathodic peaks in O2-saturated solutions, which indicates that their catalytic performances are derived from the ORR. Additionally, the onset potential and half-wave potential of the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst are the closest to those of Pt/C. It is worth noting that the limiting current density (0.2 V, 5.96 mA cm−2) is superior to Pt/C (Fig. 3(a and c) and Table S1†). By contrast, we can confirm that the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst is more electrocatalytically active than TiN/NC/C, Ti0.97Fe0.03N/NC/C, Ti0.93Fe0.07N/NC/C and Ti0.91Fe0.09N/NC/C. According to the LSV curves, the corresponding Tafel slopes of the catalysts were calculated and are shown in Fig. 3b and S6.† The Tafel slope of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C is 72 mV dec−1, which is slightly lower than that of Pt/C (94 mV dec−1) and those of the other as-prepared catalysts doped with various concertation of iron ions. It was confirmed that Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C has a faster electron transfer rate, which resulted in a prominent ORR efficiency. To gain more about the ORR performance of the investigated catalysts, EIS measurements were carried out in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, as shown in Fig. 3f. The Nyquist plots of the synthesized catalysts all exhibit excellent interfacial diffusion resistance relative to Pt/C, suggesting that the iron-doped catalysts reduce the interfacial resistance on the cathode reaction surface and possess high electron transport ability in the ORR process. Further evidence of negligible charge transfer resistance at the catalyst electrolyte interface is the absence of a discernible semicircle in the high-frequency region, which corresponds to the charge transfer process at the cathode interface.39

(c) ORR performance plot of the as-prepared catalysts. (d and e) K–L plots of the TiN/NC/C and Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalysts between 0.27 and 0.52 V. (f) Nyquist plots of the above catalysts in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. 
In addition, the kinetic progress of the catalyst was estimated using the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation. As displayed in Fig. 3(d and e) and S6,† all of the catalysts display massive linearity and parallelism in their as-prepared states, which are related to the favorable first-order reaction kinetics for dissolved oxygen concentration and oxygen molecule electron transfer numbers at various potentials during the ORR process. Compared with the others, better linearity and parallelism are observed for Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C, illustrating that doping with appropriate concentrations of iron ions is favorable for ORR kinetics. The value of average electron transfer numbers (n) for Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C is 3.64, which is close to Pt/C (3.73) and higher than the other as-prepared catalysts (Fig. S7†), demonstrating that doped-iron species can alter the ORR pathway and high selectivity towards the direct four-electron transfer pathway.
Generally, a superior methanol crossover effect and durability are crucial features to consider in determining catalysts applied in zinc–air batteries. The methanol tolerance of the catalysts was investigated using chronoamperometry in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, as shown in Fig. 4a, along with that of the Pt/C as a benchmark. Upon introducing 3 M methanol into the electrolyte, the current density of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C had no alteration, however, there was a considerable drop in the current density of Pt/C. Similar results were obtained for TiN/NC/C, Ti0.97Fe0.03N/NC/C, Ti0.93Fe0.07N/NC/C and Ti0.91Fe0.09N/NC/C (Fig. S8a†), demonstrating that the as-prepared catalysts are extremely resistant to the methanol crossover effect. Furthermore, the ORR durability of TiN/NC/C, Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C and Pt/C catalysts were also investigated by chronoamperometry at −0.5 V. It can be seen from Fig. 4b that Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C exhibited a very slight attenuation with 95.6% of its initial current density, and the initial current retention of TiN/NC/C and Pt/C are 79.8% and 59.6% respectively, demonstrating that the Fe dopant can improve the ORR durability of TiN/NC/C catalysts. The initial current retention of Ti0.97Fe0.03N/NC/C, Ti0.93Fe0.07N/NC/C and Ti0.91Fe0.09N/NC/C is 84.1%, 84.3% and 86.5%, respectively (Fig. S8b†), illustrating that doping appropriate concentrations of iron ions is also favorable for ORR durability.

3.3 Zn–air battery performance
According to the aforementioned findings, doping iron into TiN may enhance the ORR performance of the TiN/NC/C catalyst. In particular, Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C exhibits optimized ORR activity and kinetics that are on par with or superior to Pt/C. To further assess the electrocatalytic performance of TixFe1−xN/NC/C, the Zn–air batteries were assembled. The discharge polarization and corresponding power density curves are shown in Fig. 4c and S9a.† The Zn–air battery with the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst possesses a higher open circuit voltage of 1.35 V and a maximum power density of 135.5 mA cm−2, which is comparable to Pt/C, higher than the other as-prepared catalysts. Zn–air batteries employing the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst have a discharge plateau voltage of 1.29 V, which is similar to the Pt/C voltage (1.30 V). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4d, the Zn–air battery based on Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C delivered a specific capacity and energy density of 755.6 mA h gZn−1 and 944.5 W h kgZn−1 respectively, which is equivalent to PtC's performance (756.2 mA h gZn−1 and 930.1 W h kgZn−1), indicating that Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C has potential to substitute the noble metal catalysts in practical applications of Zn–air batteries. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4d, a light-emitting diode (LED) could be powered by two batteries. To further evaluate the commercial application potential of the as-prepared catalysts, the long-term charge and discharge cycling stability required further investigation at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 for 10 min per cycle. As shown in Fig. S9c,† after 1590 charge–discharge cycles, the discharge voltage of the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst only decreases by 0.107 V, which is superior to that of Pt/C (which decreases by 0.308 V), confirming that Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C has huge potential for the commercial market.
3.4 Origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance
To better understand the catalytic properties and the effective role of Fe species, the origin of activity and oxygen reduction mechanisms were further probed via XPS analysis and DFT calculations. First, the surface chemical composition and valence states of the as-made catalysts were analyzed. As expected, the existence of Ti, C, N, O and Fe elements is shown in the XPS survey spectrum of the TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst, and the composition results are presented in Fig. S10a and Table S2.† It is worth noting that the peak intensities of O 1s increase with the increasing iron doping concentrations, probably due to the formation of small oxide clusters at the interface of iron. As seen in Fig. 5a and Table S3,† four peaks from the high-resolution C 1s spectra can be deconvoluted, with the associated energies being 284.8, 286.1, 287.3, and 283.6 eV for C–C, C–N, CN, and CC, respectively,40 demonstrating that nitrogen-doped carbon materials were successfully synthesized. The pyridine nitrogen adjacent to the carbon is the active site of the metal-free catalyst in nitrogen-doped carbon materials. Importantly, the relative percentage of the C–N composition in Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C was higher than that in TiN/NC/C, illustrating that more active sites are exposed after doping. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into six peaks, in which energies at 396.5, 397.5, 398.4, 399.3, 400.8 and 402.3 eV correspond to the N–Ti–O, Ti–N, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and oxidized-N, respectively (Fig. 5b and Table S4†).41 Ti–N and Ti–N–O demonstrate the successful synthesis of TiN and the partial oxidation of TiN, respectively. Furthermore, the content of Ti–N is connected to the degree of iron doped, and a particular level of doping is helpful for the generation of TiN. As reported, graphitic N and pyridinic N both play a vital role in ORR performance.42–44 The nitrogen content of each component and the amounts of rational pyridine nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen in Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C are altered by iron doping, resulting in enhanced ORR catalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and stability.
 Fig. 5  The high-resolution spectrum of (a) C 1s, (b) N 1s, (c) Ti 2p, (c) and (d) Fe 2p. 

Fig. 5c depicts the high-resolution Ti 2p spectrum, and to further confirm the formation of the Ti–N and N–Ti–O bonds, the recorded Ti 2p spectra for the prepared catalysts were fitted to two pairs of doublet peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 at 464.5 and 459.1 eV, respectively (Table S5†). The peaks ∼457.1 eV arise from Ti–N/O.27 The dominant binding energy of ∼461.7 eV is assigned to the Ti–N bond, which is consistent with the result of the N 1s spectrum. The peaks at ∼459.1 and 464.4 eV could be attributed to the oxygen atoms related to titanium atoms to form N–Ti–O groups. The spectral peaks of N–Ti–O in TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalysts have a more negative shift with the increase of iron doping content as compared to TiN/NC/C, suggesting a rise in the Ti atoms' d-band electrons. To put it another way, in Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C, the doped Fe atom provides the Ti atom with electrons. By effectively reducing the filled electrons in the antibonding states and increasing the Ti atoms' occupation fraction of the d-band near the Fermi level, this electron compensation boosted ORR activity by enabling the transfer of d electrons to the adsorbed oxygen species for dissociation. Notably, TiN/NC/C has the highest Ti–O composition ratio among the as-prepared catalysts, whereas Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C possesses the lowest N–Ti–O composition ratio, indicating that the TiN surface's oxide layer can be significantly reduced by iron doping, exposing more active sites and improving ORR performance. Fig. 5(d) displays the high-resolution Fe 2p spectra of the prepared TixFe1−xN/NC/C catalyst. The binding energies of the 2p3/2 orbitals of Fe2+ and Fe3+ are attributed to the peaks located at 710.5 and 714.4 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, the satellite peak corresponds to the peak at 719.6 eV (Table S6†). In addition, the peak at 710.5 eV in the Fe2+ 2p3/2 suggests that iron ions may bind with N to form Fe–N bonds, which would be an effective catalytically active site.
The electronic properties of the TiN/NC/C and Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalysts were confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The calculated density of states (DOS) of the TiN/NC/C and Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C structures determine their metallic characteristics when all electronic states pass through the Fermi level. Fig. 6a demonstrates that doping Fe ions into the lattice of carbon TiN resulted in a noteworthy change in the electronic structure of TiN. The Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst possesses a higher density of electronic states near the Fermi level, implying that the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst has a higher charge transfer rate, which is advantageous for improving the catalytic reaction. The proposed mechanism of the ORR is shown in Fig. 6c, where ΔGOH*, ΔGO*, ΔGOOH*, and  are the ORR essential reaction step free energy changes.45Fig. 6b shows the Gibbs energy change for the TiN/NC/C and Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalysts. At U = 0 V, a positive ΔG will result in an overpotential value higher than 1.23 V, indicating the poor ORR catalytic activity of TiN/NC/C. The formation of OOH* is regarded to be a crucial step in achieving high ORR activity. Fig. 6b demonstrates that the reaction energy barrier for the formation of OOH* on the surface of the TiN/NC/C structure is higher than that for Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C. Additionally, we evaluated the ORR onset potential over the as-prepared catalysts; the calculated Uonset value of TiN/NC/C is −0.04 V, which is lower than the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C value of 0.47 V, demonstrating that iron doping boosts the catalyst's ORR activity significantly. Additionally, when the voltage was increased to 1.23 V, an uphill process corresponding to an adsorption reaction was seen on both catalysts, generating an obvious reaction energy barrier. In summary, iron doping boosts the charge transfer rate of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C, reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier of OOH* formation, and thus enhances ORR catalytic activity.

The high ORR performance of the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst is associated with the morphology, composition and atomic structures. (I) The catalyst possesses effective mass and charge transport capabilities during the ORR process owing to the unique interconnected sphere-like structure, as well as the uniform distribution increases the specific area of the catalytic material, which is beneficial for exposing more catalytically active sites for the ORR. (II) In the catalyst structure, nitrogen-doped carbon as the substrate inhibits particle agglomeration effectively. Moreover, Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C possesses the highest content of C–N bonding and pyridine nitrogen, which can act as active sites in the ORR process, respectively. In addition, the graphitization degree of carbon matrices related to the electron transfer rate during the ORR process was optimized indirectly. (III) The electronic structure of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C is affected by receiving electrons from the doped Fe atoms, and increases the number of d-band electrons of Ti atoms close to the Fermi level and directly supplies d-electrons for adsorbed oxygen species, facilitating the 4-electron-dominated pathway of the ORR. (IV) Combining this with the DOS analysis, after iron doping, there is a considerable rise in the density of electronic states close to the Fermi level, indicating that Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C has a faster charge transfer rate. Additionally, the rate-determining step of Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C is greatly reduced when compared to TiN/NC/C by assessing the binding energy of the intermediate stage of adsorption.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, a simple method was designed to tailor the microstructure of TiN/NC/C to improve the ORR performance by doping Fe ions into the lattice of TiN. As expected, the optimal Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst displayed excellent ORR activity and durability over the onset potential and half-wave potential. Moreover, its limiting current density (0.2 V, 5.96 mA cm−2) and durability were superior to Pt/C (20%). The remarkable performance improvement was attributed to the introduction of the Fe ion dopant, which not only improves the graphitization degree of carbon matrices, optimizes the particle size, increases the relative percentage of pyridinic-N and C–N, but also tailors the electronic structure of TiN, and therefore facilitates the electron transfer and increases the active sites for the ORR process. Importantly, the Zn–air battery assembled with the Ti0.95Fe0.05N/NC/C catalyst has a maximum power density and specific capacity comparable to that of Pt/C. Our strategy could pave the way for the development of low-cost, high-stability Zn–air electrocatalysts.
