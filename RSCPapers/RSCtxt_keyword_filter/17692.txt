    , Accepted 3rd May 2019First published on 6th May 2019AbstractHere, we report the synthesis and photophysical and electrochemical characterization of new dyes based on 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as anchoring units to TiO2 surfaces. In our design, we employed bis-triphenylamine(bis-TPA)-based electron-donor and co-donor units linked through thiophene and fluorene spacers to these rhodanine-based anchoring acceptors. A detailed relationship amongst the dye structures, their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their photovoltaic behavior is described in this work. The new dyes showed broad absorption spectra and interesting emission properties. Likewise, a strong push–pull electronic interaction was also predicted by DFT theoretical calculations showing that the HOMO level was exclusively localized on the TPA-based co-donor units, while the LUMO level was mainly localized on the rhodanine-based acceptors. Dye RDA-3 showed the best photovoltaic performance with an overall conversion efficiency of 3.17% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Charge-transfer (CT) materials have had much attention in the last decades, owing primarily to the possibility of tuning their properties through organic synthesis, resulting in applications in different fields such as photovoltaics (PV),1–4 non-linear optics,5,6 artificial photosynthesis7–9 and Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs).10–13 In the field of PV, Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) have aroused great interest, fast becoming a potential renewable energy source with Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCE) up to 14.3%.14 Since the original work published by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991,15 DSSCs continue being a hot topic nowadays.16–21 In a conventional DSSC device, a photoanode of nano-crystalline TiO2 on a transparent conducting oxide is sensitized with an organic or metal-based dye followed by an electrolyte redox couple and a counter electrode.
Looking at the structures of organic sensitizers, generally these are based on an electron-donor moiety linked covalently to an electron-acceptor moiety (D–A system) that also acts as anchoring group to the TiO2 surface. Different synthetic strategies have been studied to improve the photophysical and electrochemical properties of new organic dyes, which can be summarized by: (i) the use of bulky co-donor systems to block the approach of the electrolyte redox couple to the semiconductor surface avoiding the electronic recombinant processes; (ii) the improvement of the light harvesting in the red region of the visible spectrum through the introduction of π-conjugated linkers and (iii) the development of novel anchoring units with better optical, electrochemical and stability properties than the most widely used acceptor cyanoacrylic acid.
Taking this into consideration, our group has contributed to this issue, reporting in 2011 the synthesis of 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (DR) as an acceptor unit for non-linear optical applications,22 and later, the synthesis of organic dyes containing DR as anchoring units to the TiO2 surface, which showed great optical and electrochemical properties with moderate efficiencies.23 Since then, several groups have incorporated the electron-deficient DR derivative as an acceptor group in D–A systems to build PV devices showing efficiencies up to 10%.24–28 However, to date, there are no studies comparing the photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as the photovoltaic performances of DR and rhodanine-3-acetic acid (RAA) in DSSC applications.
Here, we report for the first time the comparison of the PV performances of DR and RAA as anchoring units to the TiO2 surface by means of the synthesis of new organic dyes with electron-donor and co-donor units of bis-triphenylamine (bis-TPA) linked through thiophene and fluorene spacers to these anchoring units (see Fig. 1). To get a better understanding of the prepared molecules, photophysical and electrochemical characterization as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Here, we report the incorporation of electron-deficient rhodanine rings into different conjugated electron-rich systems (ERSs) based on the co-donor-donor moiety of bis-TPA (Scheme 1). DR was synthetized with a moderate yield (55%) by a Knoevenagel reaction using equimolar quantities of rhodanine, malononitrile and KOH.22 The ERS based on bis-TPA (2) was synthesized by a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction between 4,4′-diformyltriphenylamine and triphenylaminephosphonate 1 with a yield of 53% (Scheme S1 in the ESI†). Likewise, ERSs based on bis-TPA and π-conjugated spacers of thiophene and fluorene (5a–b) were also prepared by a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction with yields of 85% and 59%, respectively.29 The target molecules were obtained with moderate yields (52–66%) by a Knoevenagel condensation using the corresponding active methylene rhodanine (DR or RAA). It is worth noting that DR showed decomposition products during the Knoevenagel reaction under acid conditions, therefore, DR target molecules were obtained through a basic treatment as can be seen in Scheme 1. The structural identities of all compounds were fully identified by 1H and 13C NMR, as well as mass spectrometry (see the ESI†).

Photophysical, electrochemical and theorical characterization
All the synthesized dyes showed strong absorption in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 435 and 514 nm (Fig. 2a), featuring two bands corresponding to π → π* and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions between the bis-TPA-based donor and the rhodanine-based acceptor. The low energy bands, in almost all dyes, were red-shifted with the increase of the π-conjugation, except for fluorene-based dyes, which showed a blue-shifted single one. Comparing DR-dyes with RAA-dyes, the introduction of DR improved the light harvesting in a wide range of the spectrum, showing the highest molar absorption coefficients (ε) (Table 1), however RAA showed a slightly broader absorption range in all cases, being more evident for RDA-3. Interestingly, the use of RDA in RDA-1 led to a slight bathochromic shift of the low energy band (by 32 nm) in comparison with DCR-1, which could denote a stronger electron-withdrawing ability. The introduction of thiophene as the π-spacer in DCR-2 and RDA-2 improved the light-harvesting ranges with ε values of 25600 and 38100 M−1 cm−1 for the low energy bands, which were bathochromically shifted by ∼60 nm and 47 nm regarding DCR-1 and RDA-1, respectively. Dyes DCR-3 and RDA-3, using fluorene as the π-spacer, showed the highest ε values with a hypsochromic shift of the low energy bands in comparison with thiophene-based dyes.

Fig. 2b shows the normalized emission spectra for all dyes at an excitation wavelength of 378 nm, featuring a single band bathochromically shifted with the increase of the conjugation (e.g. the π-spacer of fluorene in DCR-3 shifted by 117 nm the λemmax in comparison with DCR-1). To figure out whether the fluorescence spectra were independent of the excitation wavelength, emission was recorded exciting each dye at its lower energy wavelength (λAbs) according to Table 1. Dyes DCR-2, DCR-3 and RDA-3 showed a single band independently of λex, while DCR-1, RDA-1 and RDA-2, interestingly, showed different fluorescence maxima with the variation of λex (Fig. 2c). When excited at 378 nm, DCR-1 showed two emission bands at 431 and 458 nm, while for RDA-1 and RDA-2 a single band at 431 and 447 nm was observed, respectively. The first emission band for DCR-1 (431 nm) is exactly overlapped with that for RDA-1 (Fig. 2b and c). However, when excited at the low energy λAbs, a single band was observed for DCR-1, RDA-1 and RDA-2 at 511, 558 and 557 nm, respectively, which were weaker than the former (Fig. 2d). This particular behavior, commonly known as the red-edge effect, results from a variety of solute–solvent interactions in the ground and excited states under conditions of restricted mobility.30 This phenomenon does not fit with Vavilov's law and Kasha's rule, which state that the emission energy is independent of the excitation energy within the absorption band and the fluorescence normally occurs from the lowest vibrational level of the first excited electronic state, respectively.31 Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of the dyes relative to PRODAN were measured in dichloromethane at a dilution with an absorbance ∼0.05 using an excitation wavelength of 378 nm (Section 1.3 in the ESI†). The dyes had ΦF in the range 0.76–7.03 × 10−3 showing lower values for the RAA-based dyes than those for their analogous RD-based dyes, which confirmed that their higher fluorescence quenching resulted from their stronger electron-withdrawing ability (Table 1). As expected, the trend of the ΦF values agrees with the calculated E0–0 values showing that the lower the gap between the ground and excited state, the less efficient the radiative process.32 Something interesting happened with RDA-2, its ΦF was lower by an order of magnitude than that for DCR-2, which might seem incongruent. It could be explained through the larger overlap between the absorption and emission spectra; both maximum emission peaks for RDA-2 at 447 and 557 nm are overlapping the absorption spectrum. For the case of DCR-1 and RDA-1, their second emission maxima do not overlap with their corresponding absorption spectra.
Cyclic voltammetry was employed to calculate the oxidation potentials for each dye and Table 2 summarizes all data. The oxidation potential vs. NHE (Eox) corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and its energy was calculated as previously reported.33 Owing to the excited state energy (ELUMO) being important in determining the feasibility of an electron transferring from the dye into the conduction band of the TiO2, we also calculated ELUMO using the energy of the ground state oxidation (EHOMO) and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) as previously reported.34

The presence of the bis-TPA-based electron-donor led to two oxidation potentials that were separated from each other by ∼200 mV, which is evidence of a redox gradient phenomenon that potentiates the ICT. As expected, the use of π-conjugated spacers shifted cathodically both potentials. Comparing DR- and RAA-based dyes, we could conclude that the HOMO levels remain almost unchanged in both types of dyes, however, the use of RAA led to a small LUMO stabilization that could be attributed to a slightly stronger acceptor ability in comparison with DR, which was unexpected considering the presence of nitriles in DR, which would lead to a stronger acceptor ability. Such stabilization was most evident for the case of DCR-1 and RDA-1, where there was a difference of 0.24 eV between their LUMO energies. This finding demonstrates a weak electronic coupling between the ERSs and the nitriles of DR, which could affect negatively the PV performances. The oxidative potentials (Eox) of the dyes yield HOMO level energies in the range of −5.77 to −5.61 eV, lower than that of the electrolyte redox couple (∼−4.90 eV), ensuring that there is efficient dye regeneration (ΔEgap1, Fig. 3). Likewise, the LUMO levels ranging from −3.38 to −3.09 eV were higher than the TiO2 conduction band level (∼−3.9 eV), ensuring electron injection (ΔEgap2, Fig. 3).

To understand better the optical properties of the new rhodanine-based dyes, DFT theoretical calculations using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) functional were performed. Transition state energies were also calculated by means of a self-consistent field (SCF) method using the mentioned functional and the conductor polarized continuum model (CPCM) in THF. Fig. 4 shows two relevant structural parameters for evaluating ICT in the new dyes, the dihedral angles (Φ1 and Φ2) between the electron reservoirs (D and A) and the π-spacer, and the length between D and A. The dihedral angles correspond to the deviation from coplanarity of the π-spacer regarding the D and A. It is worth noting that although semiplanar geometries are necessary for efficient ICT, the deviation from coplanarity could inhibit the formation of π-stacked aggregation of the dyes. According to the optimized structures, the use of different acceptor units in the dyes led to some changes in the coplanarity. These changes were more pronounced for the case of fluorene-based dyes, where the use of rhodanine-3-acetic acid in RDA-3 led to an increase of the dihedral angle Φ1 of 7.8° in comparison with DCR-3. We could hypothesize that the electron recombination between the dyes and TiO2 resulting from the dye aggregation could decrease due to the presence of the second unit of TPA, and for the case of fluorene-based dyes, the presence of the two C8H17 chains.
 Fig. 4  Optimized structures of the new dyes. 
Since the DSSC performance depends exclusively on electron transfer processes, the study of the topology of the frontier orbitals for the dyes is necessary. As expected, the HOMO level of the dyes was predicted to be mainly localized on the two TPA units, while the LUMO level was mainly localized on the π-spacers and the rhodanine-based acceptors. It is important to mention that for DCR-(1–2) and RDA-(1–2) the topology of the frontier orbitals showed a HOMO–LUMO overlap with a contribution to the LUMO topology from the first TPA unit. However, that was not observed for fluorene-based dyes (DCR-3 and RDA-3), showing almost a nodal point in the topology of the frontier orbitals, exactly on the double bond between the bis-TPA and the fluorene π-spacer, thus demonstrating a stronger push–pull interaction. This push–pull behavior exhibited by fluorene-based dyes is also related to the larger length between D and A.
Transition state calculations showed a bathochromic shift of the more probable transitions with the increase of the conjugation. It is worth noting in Table 3 that all dyes showed absorption bands with oscillator strength >1.0. The higher the oscillator strength for an electronic transition, the larger the absorption coefficient of the transition.35 However, for the case of DCR-2 and RDA-2, although calculations predicted the largest shift of the low energy transitions toward the red region of the visible spectrum with energies of 2.41 and 2.58 eV, these dyes showed lower oscillator strength than their homologs. Calculations predicted three different transitions for DCR-2 with oscillator strengths of 0.7650, 1.2886 and 1.6646, all of them contributing to the CT process of the D–A system, while for RDA-2 only two probable transitions were predicted. Two transitions were also predicted for DCR-3 and RDA-3, the first ones were bathochromically shifted in comparison with DCR-1 and RDA-1, and the low energy transitions were hypsochromic shifted, which could explain the single band in the absorption spectra for these dyes (Fig. 2a). The high energy transitions were predicted to be mainly π–π* transitions and described by HOMO → LUMO+1 (H → L+1) and H → L+2 transitions, while the low energy transitions corresponded to ICT transitions, which were mainly described by H → L, H−1 → L and H−2 → L transitions.

To figure out what are the implications of the low oscillator strength of the thiophene-based dyes, we calculated the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), which is an important factor in photoexcitation and photoconversion processes.36 We can define the LHE by eqn (1): LHE = 1 − 10−f(1)where f corresponds to the oscillator strength of each probable transition. From eqn (1) we can state that the higher the oscillator strength for an electronic transition, the larger the LHE of the transition. An important parameter to evaluate the DSSC performance corresponds to the Incident Photon to Electron Conversion (IPCE), which depends on the LHE as in eqn (2):37 IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ηc(2)where ϕinj and ηc correspond to the electron collection efficiency and electron injection efficiency, respectively. Therefore, the improvement of the light harvesting ability (broad absorption spectrum and a high molar extinction coefficient) of the dyes increases the IPCE values, thereby increasing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of DSSC devices. The calculated LHE, given in Table 3, showed that the use of thiophene as π-spacers led to lower values for ICT transitions, with RDA-2 having the lowest LHE values, which could affect negatively the photovoltaic performances from these dyes.
PV performance
The photovoltaic properties for the synthesized dyes are summarized in Table 4. Likewise, Fig. 5 shows the incident photo-conversion efficiency (IPCE) as well as the current density–voltage characteristics for DSSCs composed of the rhodanine-based dyes and the standard N719. As mentioned before, the synthesized dyes meet all energetic requirements for DSSC applications, with the HOMO and LUMO level energies lower than that of the electrolyte redox couple (∼−4.90 eV) and higher than the TiO2 conduction band level (∼−3.9 eV) (Fig. 3), making thermodynamically favourable the dye regeneration and electron injection to the conduction band of the TiO2, respectively (Fig. 3).

 Fig. 5  (a) IPCE spectra for rhodanine-based devices; (b) current density–voltage characteristics for DSSC devices. 
DSSC devices based on the synthesized dyes showed IPCE values >50% in a broad range. As expected according to the photophysical characterization, the DR-based dyes showed narrower IPCE spectra, affecting negatively the overall efficiencies in comparison with the RAA-based analogs, except for the dye based on thiophene as the π-spacer (DCR-2) in which the use of DR slightly increased the photocurrent response.
The photocurrent responses of the DSSCs based on RDA-1 showed higher IPCE values (>45% in a range of 380–506 nm) than those for DCR-1 (>35% in a range of 377–481 nm), therefore giving higher efficiency. The broadening of the IPCE spectrum led to a larger photocurrent, which explains the higher efficiency observed for the reference dye N719 of 6.31%. Likewise, we synthesized the dye TPAM-1 as a reference using cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor unit (Fig S3 in the ESI†), which can allow us to compare the effect of the anchoring unit on efficiencies. TPAM-1 showed a high efficiency (6.13%, Table S1 in the ESI†) with PV characteristics near to N719. The higher efficiency of TPAM-1 in comparison with DCR-1 and RDA-1 is due to a higher photocurrent response with IPCE values exceeding 90% in the range between 375 and 500 nm, even being higher than the response of the N719 DSSC (76% in the range of 516–531 nm).29,38 For the case of DCR-2 and RDA-2, although the presence of the π-conjugated spacer based on thiophene notably improved the breadth of the IPCE curve, the maximum values reached by their DSSC devices were of 32% at 395 nm and 24% at 412 nm, respectively, resulting in the lowest photocurrent responses. The lowest IPCE values for the thiophene-based dyes can be attributed to the lowest LHE values, which agreed with the theoretical characterization. Thiophene also led to lower Voc and FF values which, in combination with the photocurrent response, resulted in an overall decrease in efficiency. The introduction of fluorene improved the photocurrent response as well as the Voc and FF values. The DSSC device based on RDA-3 showed the highest efficiency of 3.17% with a Voc of 0.721 V, a Jsc of 6.64 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.660. It agrees with the theoretical calculations, which predicted a better push–pull behavior for fluorene-based dyes with the HOMO orbital exclusively on bis-TPA and LUMO on the π-spacer and the rhodanine ring and, moreover, with the highest calculated LHE values.
Some previous studies have shown that the driving force of the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 strongly depends on the good electronic coupling between the LUMO level of the dye and the electronic states of the TiO2. As can be seen in Table 3, the LUMO level of all synthesized dyes was predicted to be exclusively on the anchoring unit, ensuring a good electronic coupling. However, for the case of the RAA-based dyes, it is worth noting that the carboxylic group of the anchoring unit was away from the LUMO topology which, in combination with its affinity to predominantly inject electrons into surface trap states of the TiO2, led to low efficiencies (Fig. 6a).39 For the DR-based dyes, we hypothesized that the dependence of the anchoring to the TiO2 on the DR tautomerism reduced the strength of the dye–Ti bond leading to dye-desorption from the TiO2 surface (Fig. 6b). It was evident with the sonication of the DR-based devices in dichloromethane for five minutes resulting in a red coloration of the solvent, which was not seen for DSSC devices based on RAA-dyes. Likewise, it has also been demonstrated that the presence of S and O atoms in the rhodanine ring lead to an interaction between the dye and the I2 (redox electrolyte) through halogen bonding near the TiO2 surface, resulting in a higher concentration of I2 in the vicinity of the dye-coated TiO2 surface and, therefore, accelerating the interfacial charge recombination,40 all in all affecting negatively the PV performance.

Conclusions

DR- and RAA-based dyes were successfully synthesized in moderate yields, showing absorption properties shifted toward the visible region of the solar spectrum. Regarding the emission properties, dyes DCR-1, RDA-1 and RDA-2 showed the red-edge effect in which the fluorescence spectrum depends on the excitation wavelength. Both photophysical and electrochemical characterization showed a slightly stronger acceptor ability of RAA than DR, which demonstrates a weak electronic coupling between the ERSs and the nitriles of DR, which affected negatively the PV performances. DSSC devices based on DCR-(1–3) and RDA-(1–3) showed moderate overall efficiencies ranging from 1.63–3.17%, respectively, owing mainly to a weak driving force for the electron injection from the dyes to the conduction band of the TiO2. Dye RDA-3 showed the better PV behavior with a Voc of 0.721 V, a Jsc of 6.64 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.660 resulting in an efficiency of 3.17%.
