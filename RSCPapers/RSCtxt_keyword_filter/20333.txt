    , Accepted 19th October 2011First published on 17th November 2011AbstractRecently many efforts have been devoted to the investigation of organic nano- and micro-materials due to their unique properties and broad applications in organic field-effect transistors, organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, photodetectors and superhydrophobic materials. In comparison with physical vapour deposition, solution processing provides a more convenient and cost-effective approach to obtain organic nano- and micro-materials with various morphologies, including wires, sheets and flowers. In this review, we use the basic concepts of supramolecular chemistry to discuss the molecular design strategy and growth mechanisms of various organic nano- and micro-structures, and their relationship with the corresponding applications.Ting LeiTing Lei received his B.Sc. degree in chemistry from Peking University in 2008, while he was working in Prof. Pei's group.

Introduction
Organic nanomaterials, especially electronically active ones, have attracted increasing attentions in the last decade.1–5 Inorganic materials, such as nanowires,6,7quantum dots8 and carbon nanotubes,9 are the major types of nanomaterials, if not exclusive. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic materials can provide advantages such as unlimited choices of building blocks, versatile modification of materials from the molecular level, high flexibility, low cost, and ease for large-area fabrication, which open up a bright vista for the next generation nanotechnologies and electronic devices.
The fabrication of organic nanomaterials relies mainly on two methods, physical vapour deposition (PVD) and solution processing. PVD is commonly carried out in a quartz tube by sublimating organic molecules at high temperature (250–450 °C), and then the organic vapour is cooled and crystallized in the low-temperature zone. This approach is usually used for organic molecules with low molecular weight and high thermostability,10,11 which limits its scope for large molecules, oligomers and polymers. In contrast, without high temperature or complex facilities, solution processing is more convenient and can be used for large-area fabrication. At the same time, the growth conditions are easily adjusted by changing the solvents, temperature and even dopants to control the growth of organic nanomaterials. Therefore, solution-processed organic nanomaterials become more and more popular.
In this contribution, we describe recent progress in growth, self-assembly and applications of solution-processed organic nanomaterials. We also discuss the design strategy, different growth mechanisms, and their device performances in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), photodetectors and superhydrophobic materials etc.
Molecular design strategy and synthesis
Organic nanomaterials are formed by the self-assembly of organic molecules through different kinds of intermolecular interactions. The development of supramolecular chemistry paves the way to craft the growth of organic nanomaterials.12
π–π Interactions
π–π Interaction is the most favourable supramolecular interaction in the design of organic nanomaterials, especially for optoelectronic applications, because it not only provides a strong and directional interaction to render molecules growing in a certain direction, but also forms carrier transporting pathways by the overlap of molecular orbitals.13,14 Despite the fact that π–π interaction is popular in this field, the strength of the π–π interaction and the causes of the interaction vary largely. The strength of π–π interaction ranges from 0 to 50 kJ mol−1, sometimes comparable with van der Waals interactions, and sometimes even surpassing moderate hydrogen bonding.12,13 The design strategy of π–π interacted nanomaterials is originated from the design of discotic liquid crystal molecules.15,16 Both the strong π–π interaction between aromatic cores and the relatively weak interaction of side alkyl chains make these molecules show strong one-dimensional (1D) growth tendency. Under certain circumstances, the growth of the other two dimensions is confined, which results in 1D micro/nanowires.17 Construction of large aromatic cores is the central topic to design and synthesize novel materials used for 1D organic nanomaterials. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, developed by Müllen et al., are very powerful to construct large fused aromatic cores (Scheme 1),15 such as hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC, 1) and its derivatives.14 Nuckolls et al. reported the synthesis of an HBC isomer 2, because the strain in the periphery of the compound made the molecule bend significantly away from planarity, where iodo-oxidative photocyclization reaction was employed.18 Several aromatic cores containing thiophene units have been realized in our lab.19–21 The oxidative C–C bond formation between two β-positions of thiophene units produced the target molecule 3 in 83% yield.

Sulphur–sulphur interactions
Along with π–π interactions, several weak non-covalent interactions play important roles in organic crystals. C–H⋯π interactions widely exist in oligoacenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as pentacene22 and perylene.2 However, computational study showed that this kind of interaction always hindered the carrier transport in organic crystal because it reduced the face-to-face overlaps of aromatic cores.22 Sulphur–sulphur interactions behave as a very important driving force to shorten the intermolecular distance in crystals, which appear in several organic semiconductors.23,24 Recently, we synthesized tetrathienoanthracene 4 to investigated its OFET performance.21 Perepichka et al. also synthesized 4 and its isomer 5 to compare their crystal packing and device performance.25 As indicated in Fig. 1a and b, there are several close S⋯S interactions existing in the crystals. They found that both solution-processed and vacuum-deposited films, isomer 5 showed higher hole mobility than 4. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of perylo[1,12-b,c,d]thiophene 7 and dithioperylene 8.26,27 After incorporating sulphur atoms into the perylene core, S⋯S interactions drove these molecules to form ideal face-to-face packing in crystals. Compound 7 was used to fabricate single-crystalline micrometre wire-based FETs through physical vapour deposition. The transistor devices exhibited p-channel behaviour with a mobility of 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.26 High mobility up to 2.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved from 1D single crystal nanoribbons fabricated with 8 by solution process.27

Donor–acceptor interactions
The weak interaction between electron-rich and electron-deficient aromatic units has been proven to be a unique driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies.28,29 On the other hand, an electron donor and acceptor (EDA) interaction is beneficial for organic solar cells, as an interpenetrating network is required to achieve highly efficient charge separation.30 Recently, a truxene derivative 9 with a C3 symmetric conjugated plane and its oxidized counterpart, truxenone 10, were used to construct 1D microwires (Fig. 2).31 In this system, absorption spectra, 1H NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optimal microscopy (POM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to explore their donor–acceptor interaction. A Job plot demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry, as expected for EDA interactions. Furthermore, DSC, POM and XRD showed that a novel phase formed after their 1:1 mixing. The perfect match in structure, size, and symmetry of 9 and 10 provided an ideal platform for investigating the co-assembly between electron-rich and electron-deficient molecules.

Hydrophobic interactions
Although the strength of the hydrophobic interaction is hard to evaluate, it is extremely important for life processes, such as the formation of membranes, micelles and protein folding. Experimental data show that the stabilization of the compact state of a protein is, attributed to hydrophobic interactions, originating from van der Waals interactions among the aggregated non-polar groups in the protein and the strong entropic compensation when water molecules in the surfaces of every separated non-polar group are distributed back into the bulk solvent after the aggregation.32 Using hydrophobic interactions to stabilize supramolecular structures has frequently been reported, and is well summarized by Lee and Stupp et al.33,34 A typical example using hydrophobic interactions to built organic nanomaterials was reported by Aida et al. They synthesized HBC derivatives containing both hydrophobic alkyl and hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol (TEG) chains (Fig. 3). These molecules self-assembled into well-defined 1D bilayer tubular structures.35–37 The structures were mainly stabilized by the π–π interactions from the HBC cores, van der Waals interactions of the alkyl chains and hydrophobic interactions. The alkyl chains were buried in the bilayer wall to avoid contacting with the hydrophilic environment.

Very recently, we reported a two-dimensional bilayered nanosheet constructed from a butterfly-shaped molecule (Fig. 4).38 This molecule also possessed both hydrophobic alkyl chains and hydrophilic TEG chains. It formed free-standing films in solution, which could be easily transferred to a substrate for direct device fabrication. XRD of the multilayer nanosheets gave well defined diffraction patterns that were attributed to the reflections from (001) to (005) planes, suggesting a typical lamellar structure. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) showed the π–π stacking interaction of the nanosheets parallel to the surface of the film. Atom force microscopy (AFM) height analysis showed such individual thin films with a uniform height of approximately 4.0 nm. Therefore, we concluded that the bilayer sheet was formed through strong π–π stacking, assisted by van der Waals interactions of long aliphatic chains. Since the exteriors of the bilayer sheets were surrounded by TEG chains, further aggregation was inhibited.

          Hydrogen-bonding interactions

Nanowires based on π–π interactions have been intensively explored. However, because of serious self-quenching in π–π interacting systems, it is a great challenge to obtain highly fluorescent nanowires through self-assembly. Different from other non-covalent interactions, hydrogen bonding is directional and relatively strong.39,40 Normal hydrogen bonds typically range in strength from ca. 4 to 60 kJ mol−1, which is one order of magnitude larger than van der Waals forces (<5 kJ mol−1).12 Geometrical matching and directionality of hydrogen bonding provides an alternative method to form 1D nanowires with various properties. Recently, we reported a supramolecular polymer constructed by multiple hydrogen bonds, which formed uniform nanowires and possessed high solid-state fluorescent quantum efficiency (ΦF: 22%) (Fig. 5).41 The monomers containing a shape-persistent three-dimensional (3D) skeleton and hydrogen bonds were introduced in the vertical direction. The introduction of multiple hydrogen bonds not only provided a strong tendency of self-assembly in the vertical direction, but also lowered the possibility of the mismatch of hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the rigid 3D structure effectively reduced the self-quenching and aggregation to achieve high fluorescence efficiency in solid state. Interestingly, we also obtained single molecular nanowires with a width of only one single molecule from highly diluted solution because the horizontal van der Waals interaction was relatively weak (Fig. 5c).

Controlled growth and growth mechanism of organic nanomaterials
In order to obtain organic nanomaterials in expected sizes, shapes and morphologies, controlling both the self-assembly and the crystallization processes are very important. Several methods to control the growth of organic molecules into 1D nanomaterials have been proposed by Zang and Moore et al. recently, including rapid solution dispersion, phase transfer, vapour diffusion, seeded growth and sol–gel processing.4 Although solution-processed organic nanomaterials can be modulated by several factors and many interesting morphologies have been reported, the growth mechanisms of organic nanomaterials and impact factors remain obscure. Simply, the growth of organic nanomaterials is always explained with traditional crystallographic knowledge—the confined growth of organic crystals. However, in-depth understanding of the growth mechanism and the molecular structure–morphology relationship requires inspirations from other domains and perspectives.

Alkyl chain effect and π–π stacking
Recently, Zang et al. reported the effect of side-chain substituents on the morphology of self-assembled perylene diimide molecules.42 Two molecules, N,N′-di(nonyldecyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide 13 and N,N′-di(dodecyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide 14, were synthesized to investigate their self-assembly behaviours (Fig. 6). These molecules exhibited different self-assembly behaviours in solution. Compared to 13 with branched alkyl chains, the emission from the aggregates of 14 was red-shifted significantly (about 30 nm), and its fluorescent quantum yield decreased by about three times. Moreover, the aggregates of 14 showed a pronounced absorption band at longer wavelength. These observations indicated a stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in the aggregates of 14, which ultimately led to distinct outcomes of self-assembly: while 13 formed zero-dimensional nanoparticles, 14 formed 1D nanobelts (Fig. 6).

Isomeric effect and solvent effect
Competition between solute–solute interactions and solute–solvent interactions determines the equilibration of crystallization and dissolution, which control the growth of organic nanomaterials. Increasing the solute–solute interactions enhances the self-assembly of molecules, while increasing the solute–solvent interactions destroys the aggregates. Moreover, the solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions are determined by the molecular structure of the solute. Therefore, revealing the two mutually competitive interactions from the molecular level is critical for controlling the morphology of organic nanomaterials.
In order to understand the solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions, we synthesized three similar molecules (17a, 17b, and 17c as shown in Scheme 2) to investigate their self-assembly behaviours. These molecules have an identical truxenone core and different peripheries, which were obtained through a facile approach.43
 Scheme 2  Synthetic approach to three truxenone derivatives 17a–c. 
Interestingly, the constitutional isomers, 17a and 17b, exhibited surprisingly large differences in solubility and DSC behaviours, suggesting different aggregation pathways. 17b could readily dissolve in CHCl3, while it is difficult to find a solvent to perform 1H NMR titration experiments with the poor solubility of 17a. DSC features of 17a showed a melting point (Tm) at around 179 °C before decomposition (Td); compound 17b, on the other hand, exhibited a distinct glass transition temperature (Tg) at around 95 °C and a melting transition (Tm) at 128 °C. With more substituents, 17c had better solubility as expected, and no Tg and Tm above 50 °C were observed before its Td.
The SEM images showed the 1D microstructures of 17a, 17b, and 17c in THF, dioxane, and n-hexane (Fig. 7), respectively. The responses of 17a–c to these solvents differ greatly as a function of the solvent polarity. After heating their THF solution at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1, then cooling down to room temperature, only 17a formed 1D microbelts; 17b and 17c did not show any 1D structures under the same conditions. Upon changing to the moderately polar solvent dioxane, microbelts of 17a with a similar width and length distribution to those observed with THF were obtained. In addition, uniform microbelts of 17b clearly emerged, and microfibers of several hundreds of micrometres in length were readily formed from 17c. Upon further decreasing the solvent polarity to n-hexane, no assembly structure of 17a was observed due to its poor solubility. In contrast, microbelts of 17b not only grew longer but also tended to be more rigid and straight, and irregular structures for 17c were again observed in n-hexane.
 Fig. 7  
            SEM images of 17a–c microstructures formed from 1: THF; 2: dioxane; 3: n-hexane. Scale bars: 10 μm. 
The extensive calculations on their molecular properties demonstrated that for 17c, the steric repulsion between the two adjacent side chains forced the alkoxy chains to flip out of the molecular plane in the equilibrium geometry. As a result, 17c has a dipole moment of 1.99 D, whereas 17a and 17b are nonpolar due to their C3h symmetry and nearly planar structures. This significant difference increased the solubility of 17c in polar solvents such as THF. Moreover, the additional three hexyloxy chains increased van der Waals interaction between 17c and n-hexane molecules, which hampered the growth of the 1D structure of 17c in hexane.
For 17a and 17b, we found that the traceless quadruple moment of 17a was about 50% larger than that of 17b, suggesting a much stronger electrostatic interaction in stacked complexes of 17a. To break such a strong intermolecular interaction in 17a, a polar solvent such as THF should be employed to provide sufficient solubility for initiating the 1D self-assembly process. In the case of 17b, with much weaker intermolecular interaction between the aromatic cores, instead of considering the solubility issue, less interference from solvent molecules became the key to obtain 1D assembly of 17b successfully.
Organic microtwist and temperature effect
Chiral structures represent a fascinating type of architecture in nature, such as nanoscale DNA double-helix and macroscale chiral biominerals.44 The twisted organic nanomaterials were usually observed in gel networks.34,45 We reported an interesting example of well-separated microtwists from achiral X-shaped π-conjugated molecules via solution processing (Fig. 8).46 Microwires of 18a were obtained through dissolving the molecules in a mixture of CHCl3 and EtOH (2:3 v/v) at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 and then evaporating the solvents slowly (Fig. 8b). Surprisingly, by accelerating the precipitation rate of 18a, i.e. cooling the hot homogeneous solution quickly to room temperature, multilevel branched structures with chiral twist were obtained. For 18b, with longer alkyl chains, it self-assembled into a perfect twisted structure with uniform pitch. More importantly, branching was almost completely suppressed. Meanwhile, equal numbers of P and M twisted structures were obtained because there was no asymmetric factor present either in the molecules or in the environment.

(h) Schematic representation of the formation of bifurcated microstructure and twisted ribbons under different conditions. 
We also observed that by simply adjusting the growth temperature for the microstructure, control over the pitch of the microtwist was easily achieved. Fig. 8c–e shows SEM images of the twists obtained at various temperatures. The general trend is that the slower the precipitation process, the larger the pitch. We speculated that the formation of the microtwist was due to its special crystal growth kinetics. We built a simple kinetic model and compared it with the experimental results, which were found to be in good accordance with each other. Therefore, we concluded that the imbalance of the growth rate between the centre and the edge provided the driving force for twisting.
Organic nano/micro-tube formed by etching
Nanotubular structures are very attractive due to their broad applications such as nano-transporters, nano-reaction containers, and high surface-area sensors.40 Zhang and Lee et al. reported a single crystal micro-tube with a rectangular cross section formed by a molecule 19.4719 is a typical intramolecular-charge-transfer compound, and the intermolecular D–A interaction is the main driving force to direction the growth of the microtube (Fig. 9). The preparation is simple, and no surfactant, template, or catalyst was employed. Based on the observation of time-dependent growth, they proposed that the tubular structures were formed by etching or dissolving the center of a solid rectangular nanorod by THF. Because a high density of defects, which formed at the initial stage of crystallization, probably existed at the center of the rectangular nanorods, after the nanorods were formed, a higher etching or dissolution rate at the center than that of the exterior layer led to the formation of the hollow nanotubes.

Organic flowers formed by hierarchical self-assembly
Besides 1D ones, 2D and 3D nanostructures are also attractive. Several organic nanostructures, such as nanosheets36 and nano/micro-flowers48–51 have been reported. Nakanishi et al. reported a flower-shaped morphology based on hierarchically organized supramolecular nano-to-micro-architecture, readily prepared by self-organization of fullerene derivative 20 (Fig. 10).48 The flower-like structures displayed well-defined diffraction peaks from (001) to (006) planes with a d-spacing value of 4.12 nm, consistent with high resolution (HR) cryo-TEM analysis at the flake edge of a flower-shaped object. The black dot in Fig. 10c marks the peak originating from the packing distance of neighbouring C60 moieties (d = 0.91 nm), which indicated a significant C60/C60 π–π interaction. Therefore, the authors proposed that the flowers were formed through π–π interaction of C60 and van der Waals interaction of the interdigitated aliphatic chains. Very interestingly, after tracking the growth process of the flowers, Nakanishi et al. observed that disk-like assemblies were also formed. The rolling distortions took place in every quarter of the disk, resulting in square-shaped objects having four corners with conical shapes. When the rolling-up proceeded continuously, spatial congestions occurred at the four corners, resulting in crumpling, bending, stretching, and fracture of the disks. After completing these transformations, the bilayer growth at the edges continued, fixing the spatial conformation of the crumpled sheets (Fig. 10e). The nano/micro-flowers were formed by hierarchical assembly, which firstly formed disk-like multilayer structures, and then the disks continued to roll-up into a flower.

(e) Schematic representation of the formation mechanism of the flower-shaped supramolecular assembly. Reproduced with permission from ref. 48. Copyright 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. 
A similar formation mechanism of flower-shaped supramolecular assemblies was also observed in the process of slowly cooling down a hot homogeneous solution of 21 and 22 to various temperatures.48 As shown in Fig. 11a–f, only platelike and elliptical precursors were observed at the initial stage for 21. We note that such flat objects consisted of stacked layers instead of a single layer. The edges of such precursors started to bifurcate in every direction (Fig. 11a, b, and c), and then to roll up to minimize the total elastic energy.52 When the rolling-up behaviours proceeded continuously, the inner layers had more space to consequently bifurcate (Fig. 11d and e), resulting in a 3D flower-shaped object. Tracing the growth mechanism of flower-shaped assemblies formed by 22 gave a similar result (Fig. 11g–l). The formation mechanism indicates that the formation of the microscopic flower-like assemblies was determined by both spatial and energy factors. Moreover, we also found that slow aging was essential for the formation of flower-shaped assemblies.

Applications of organic nanomaterials

Reduction in size often does more than simply make things smaller. Many properties of materials, such as mechanical and optoelectronic properties, will change below a certain size scale.51 Size dependent properties in inorganic nanomaterials are widely and systematically investigated.6–9,53 However, their counterparts, organic nanomaterials, are seldom investigated. Recently, organic nanomaterials have exhibited very interesting properties and applications, which cannot be realized in bulky systems. Moreover, these nanostructures are mostly obtained from simple solution processes, which are practical for low-cost and large-area fabrications.
Organic field-effect transistors
OFETs are of great importance for fabricating circuits, displays, and radio-frequency identification devices.2,54 Generally, OFETs are fabricated into a polycrystalline film by PVD and solution processing. However, the mobility of the film is limited by defects such as inevitable grain boundaries. On the other hand, even details of the fabrication procedure, such as evaporation speed, substrate temperature and surface treatment, dramatically affect the final device performance. Therefore, it is hard to evaluate the intrinsic performance of organic molecules. Single crystal OFETs (SC-OFETs), ideally with long-range order and no defects, exhibited promising applications for evaluating the limitation of a specific material and understanding the mechanism of carrier transport in devices. At the same time, mobilities of SC-OFETs are usually better than their polycrystalline counterparts. But it is in general more difficult to obtain single crystals of organic molecules, and their fragility and brittleness prevented their large-scale fabrication, especially flexible device fabrication.
1D organic nanostructure provides another opportunity to achieve high mobility via easy processing. The 1D nanostructures are similar to single crystals with little grain boundaries, meanwhile they can be easily obtained either by PVD55,56 or solution processing. Fig. 12 shows several recently developed organic nanostructures used for OFETs through solution processing. Hexathiapentacene (HTP, 23) containing a pentacene core and hexa-sulphur periphery, was firstly reported for the fabrication of vacuum deposited thin film OFETs.57 It gave a hole mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1. Bao et al. obtained single-crystal nanowires using HTP through solution processing (Fig. 12a).58SAED showed that the nanowires were growing along the 100 direction, which the π–π stacking pointed towards. The hole mobilites of single nanowires could be as high as 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 with current on/off ratios >103. The previously discussed dithioperylene 8nanowires fabricated by Wang and Pei et al. also showed high mobility up to 2.13 cm2 V−1 s−1.27 The nano/microwires of our molecule 3 were firstly obtained from CH2Cl2 solution, which showed a poor mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.17 However, by enhancing the crystallinity and crystal surface through a slow crystallization process in a mixture of THF/hexane, optimizing the interface between the dielectric layer, reducing the channel length through an improved plastic fiber mask method, and realizing asymmetric metal electrodes for source and drain, a hole mobility up to 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained using the same molecule.59Triisopropylsilylethynyl pentacene (TIPS-PEN, 25) is a popular pentacene derivative used for solution-processed thin film transistor fabrication.60 The thin film OFETs fabricated with TIPS-PEN through solution processing reached a high mobility up to 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio up to ∼108.61 Cho et al. reported the single-crystalline microribbons of TIPS-PEN preparation using the solvent-exchange method. The microribbons exhibited excellent performance showing a high mobility of 1.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 105 (Fig. 12e).62 Recently, we described the synthesis of a series of aceno[2,1,3]thiadiazole derivatives (26, Fig. 12f).63 These molecules exhibited a column-like crystal packing, which were different from other TIPS-PEN derivatives. Although these molecules were designed for ambipolar transport, only hole-transporting was observed. The highest mobility of the nanowires fabricated with 26 was 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1. n-Type semiconducting nanowires are seldom reported due to the deficiency of air-stable n-type molecules. Bao et al. reported n-type nanowires fabricated with perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PTCDI, 24) (Fig. 12d).64 The highest mobility measured for 24 was 0.027 cm2 V−1 s−1. Complementary inverters based on n-channel PTCDInanowire transistors and p-channel HTPnanowire OFETs were also fabricated and a gain as high as 8 was achieved. All the above nanowires have a common feature that the long axis of their crystal is along the π–π stacking direction. This result suggests that the π–π interactions are the main driving force to form such anisotropic crystals, and fortunately it is helpful for carrier transport because the π–π stacking direction is always a higher carrier transporting direction in SC-FETs.

Small molecules are not the exclusive ingredients for nanowire cuisine. Hu et al. reported well-defined, highly crystalline nanowires of a rigid rod conjugated polymer, a poly(para-phenylene ethynylene) derivative with thioacetate end groups (TA-PPE, 27).65 The TA-PPE nanowires were obtained by slow self-assembly from a solution under a certain solvent pressure in a closed jar. The nanowires were highly crystalline with an orthorhombic crystal unit. OFETs based on these nanowires exhibited charge carrier mobility as high as 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than that of thin film transistors of the same polymer. Interestingly, the π–π stacking direction of the nanowires was predominantly perpendicular to the long axis of the nanowires (Fig. 12g), which was different from those small molecules discussed above. Compared with 1D ones, 2D organic nanomaterials for optoelectronics are seldom reported. Recently, we obtained a novel 2D nanosheet, and structure analysis showed that the π–π stacking interaction of the nanosheet was parallel to the surface of the sheet. Organic transistors with the highest mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been successfully achieved (Fig. 12h).38
In order to deposit and align nanowires precisely in a desired position to fabricate large-scale integrated devices, Several bottom-up methods for inorganic materials have been exploited, such as vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) processes, the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) assembly technique, electric-field-assisted alignment and dip coating.7,66,67 However, simple and scalable patterning techniques to fabricate aligned arrays and devices for organic nanowires are rarely reported. Recently, we reported position- and size-controllable organic nanowire arrays made by a simple dip-coating method (Fig. 13).68Nanowire arrays with tunable length, desirable density and periodicity were realized by optimizing slip-stick motion, solvent evaporation conditions and the solution concentration. Parallel organic nanowires were directly grown and aligned on the substrate, and a hole mobility of 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved. Bao et al. reported a filtration-and-transfer (FAT) alignment method. The FAT method enables facile control over both the alignment and density of MWs. They fabricated transistors composed of BPE-PTCDI mirowire networks by the FAT method.69 Aligned microwires were transferred to the channel area of bottom contact substrates. The devices showed an average mobility of 0.24–0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 with current on/off ratios of 105 to 106.

Organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics
Although organic nanostructures are extensively investigated for OFETs, they are rarely directly used for fabrication of OLEDs and OPVs. We developed a novel approach to improve the performance of polymer OLEDs by blending a nanostructured dopant 28 as hole-transporting material into an electron-dominated F8BTpolymer matrix (Fig. 14).70 Because the organic nanowires of 28 self-assembled in situ within the device after spin-coating the mixture of F8BT and 28, the fabrication of the nanoscale blended film is as simple as regular polymer blending. At a 2.5 wt% concentration of nanowires, the luminous efficiency of F8BT device increased from 4.29 to 8.25 cd A−1, and external quantum efficiency increased from 1.0 to 1.92%. For pristine F8BT devices, the hole mobility was beyond the detectable limit. But for devices doped with 1, 2.5, and 5 wt% nanowires, the hole mobilities were 2 × 10−7, 5 × 10−7, and 1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Apparently, the device performance was improved as a result of increased hole mobility of the device by doping the nanowires.

To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells, a good phase separation and high carrier mobilities are required.71 Nuckolls et al. reported a new type of organic semiconductor device structure, in which organic nanostructures were used as the donor of the solar cells.72 They synthesized a new molecule, dibenzotetrathienocoronene 29, which self-assembled into columnar superstructures (Fig. 15b). The devices were fabricated by spin-coating 29 on PEDOT:PSS, followed by evaporation C60 to form a bilayered structure (Fig. 15e). The highest PCE of 1.9% was obtained for the devices annealed at 150 °C before C60 deposition. The authors found that after annealing, some nanostructures were formed (Fig. 15c and d). This was an interesting heat-induced self-assembly process, which led to a large effective interfacial area and interdigitated networks.

Photodetectors
In our group, highly sensitive, air-stable photo-detectors based on organic crystalline nanowires of 3 were also fabricated.73 The photoconductivity gain was about 1.3 × 103, while the responsivity was about 420 A W−1 at a field of 2 × 104 V cm−1. The highest on/off ratio reached 1000. Fig. 16a showed the on/off switching properties of the detector using Au as electrode. The rise time of the photocurrent curve was short, while the falling time was long. The slow decay of the photocurrent after switching off the light suggested a typical trap releasing current. Compared with the devices using Au electrodes, devices fabricated with Al electrodes had a much lower photoconductivity gain and faster switching, we assumed that thermal evaporation of heavy metal Au onto the organic nanowires produced much more surface states than the evaporation of Al. Therefore, the long lifetime of the trapped photogenerated carriers in the surface states gave rise to the high photo gain and the slow photocurrent decay of the Au-electrode device.

Photowaveguides
1D organic nanomaterials for active waveguide with high efficiency are required to process good fluorescent emission, proper crystal dimensions, and smooth crystal surfaces.5 However, for conventional 1D organic nanomaterials formed by π–π stacking, the fluorescent quantum efficiencies are quite low because of strong intermolecular electronic interactions. In order to enhance emission in solid state, we attempted to enlarge the intermolecular distance of adjacent aromatic rings by introducing steric hindrance. Five molecules were designed based on pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline (PyQ) units following this principle (Scheme 3).74
 Scheme 3  Five molecular structures based on PyQ. 
We systematically analysed the photophysical properties of these five molecules, which showed typical D–A characteristics. The crystal structures were also resolved to understand the molecular packing in these molecules. The microfibers formed by molecules 30 and 31 exhibited relatively low self-quenching, together with desirable crystal dimensions and surfaces. They were proved to be low-loss waveguide materials (0.02–0.05 dB/μm), as shown in Fig. 17.

We also investigated the photowaveguide properties of the X-shaped molecules, which could form both microwires (Fig. 8a) and microtwists (Fig. 18).75 The microwires showed excellent properties in low-loss long-distance (4.9 dB/100 μm, >200 μm) photowaveguide in a single wire. However, microtwists showed only a medium performance (8.3 dB/100 μm) because the microtwists were not well crystallized and the surfaces were imperfect. Usually, waveguiding materials have simple geometric shapes such as wires or ribbons. This is the first investigation of waveguiding property for a chiral material. Interestingly, we also observed coupling effect between microwires (Fig. 18c and d), which indicated the potential of organic nanostructures in building complex optical system in micrometre or submicrometre scale.

Gas and explosives detection
Organic molecules have been widely explored as sensors used for gas sensing, explosives detection, and biological applications. Traditionally, organic molecules used for detection are stored in solution or fabricated into films.76,77 However, solution is not suitable for practical applications such as portable devices; film is good for practical usage but it always has a small surface area, which limits its detection scope. Organic nanostructures with high surface areas provide another choice. We reported that by simply drop casting the solution of 3 in different solvents, three different well-controllable organic nanostructures, including 1D microbelts and 3D flower-shaped nanostructures (type A and type B), were facilely self-assembled (Fig. 19).78 In the application of those structures to detect explosives, with the evolution of structures from netted 1D microbelts to flower-shaped nanostructures, the detection speed of the chemosensors for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was improved by more than 700 times. Our investigation revealed that the morphology control is crucial for detection due to largely different surface areas.

Superhydrophobic materials
Most organic materials are intrinsically hydrophobic. However, in order to realize superhydrophobic materials, the fractal morphology of the two-tier roughness on both micro- and nanometre scales is required.79,80 Nakanishi et al. used their fullerene derivatives to self-assemble into globular objects of macroscopic dimensions with a wrinkled, flake-like sub-micrometre structure at the outer surface. The films formed by globular objects possessed high thermal stability and durability towards various polar solvents, with a water contact angle of 152.0°.47
We reported two kinds of microscale flower-shaped morphologies with nanometre petals formed from the hierarchical self-assembly of 21 and 22.50 As shown in Fig. 20, two kinds of flowers exhibited distinct morphologies. The films formed by two morphologies showed excellent water-repelling characteristics as superhydrophobic surfaces. One film displayed a superhydrophobic surface (contact angle > 161°) with little sliding angles (<3°); another film presented an adhesive superhydrophobic surface, and the water droplets were pinned on the surface even when it was turned upside down. Interestingly, the transition process from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state was easily realized by slightly changing the chemical structures.

The film was analysed with the Cassie model. (f) Water droplet on the surface of nanoflowers of 22, which was analysed with the Wenzel model. 
Modification of nanowires
It is difficult to design a new molecule with expected morphology. Therefore, modifying a well-developed molecule for a special purpose becomes a common approach to extend its application. Aida et al. used this strategy to functionalize their amphiphilic HBC molecule to realize diverse functions such as photoconductivity.36 However, this strategy is not general for other molecules, especially for π–π interacting systems because the introduced functional groups always interfere with the original π–π interactions, resulting in unexpected morphologies. Therefore, direct modification of the surface of nanomaterials is more convenient and versatile. In order to demonstrate this approach, we developed a facile method to modify the surface of a fragile organic 1D microstructure (Fig. 21).81 The bulk molecules and surface modifiers were designed with orthogonal solubility to protect the molecular crystals from destruction under the reaction conditions. Because the microwires formed by Blue-Br (34) were insoluble in ethanol, while Red-OH was soluble, the reactions were performed in ethanol using K2CO3 as a base. After attempting various conditions (Fig. 21d), we proved that Red-OH was covalently bonded to the nanowires. The nanowires emitted white light with CIE coordinates of (x = 0.32, y = 0.36). Moreover, using fluorescent lifetime mapping (Fig. 21c), we found that the modification happened on the surface of the nanowires. Compared with other methods, our strategy not only needs a very small amount of the modifiers, but also well preserves the morphologies.

Another approach to surface modification of organic nanostructures is non-covalent modification. Although this modification is not stable in solution, it works well under dry conditions. After our covalent approach, Zang et al. reported an interfacial modification of the electron-deficient nanofibrils formed by perylene diimide 36 with electron-rich carbazole 37 (Fig. 22).82 This surface modification formed a “surface heterojunction”, and the nanofibril showed high photoconductivity with fast photoresponse. In this design, the alkyl chains not only guaranteed the absorption of the modifiers, but also spatially separated the photogenerated charge carriers to prevent their combination.

Summary and perspectives
The past couple of years have witnessed great growth in the development of organic nano- or micro-materials. The development of supramolecular chemistry provided fruitful principles to help us design molecules and control the growth of the materials by solution processes. Detailed investigation of the growth mechanisms of various types of nano/micro-materials also provided us with further insight into the design and control of the nano/micro-structures. However, we have to admit that our understanding towards design strategies and growth mechanisms is, sometimes, superficial, and controlling the growth still needs some fortune.
Compared with bulk organic materials, reduction in size really exhibited attractive and exciting properties: nano/micro-structures for OFETs combined the high performance of single crystals and the flexibility of thin films; nano/micro-structures increased the carrier mobility of OLEDs, and enhanced the charge separation of the OPVs; because of their high surface area, they also improved the detection limit of organic materials; organic materials are usually hydrophobic, but nanoflowers realized superhydrophobic properties. Reduction in size of organic materials indeed offered traditional organic materials novel and unique properties, which show a bright future for further investigation of organic nano/micro-materials.
