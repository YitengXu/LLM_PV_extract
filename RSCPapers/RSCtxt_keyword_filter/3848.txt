    , Accepted 28th March 2013First published on 4th April 2013AbstractA method for the synthesis of metal nanoparticle coatings for plasmonic solar cells which can meet large scale industrial demands is demonstrated. A UV pulsed laser is utilized to fabricate Au and Ag nanoparticles on the surface of polymer materials which form the substrates for plasmonic organic photovoltaic devices to enhance their performance. Control of the particles' size and density is demonstrated. The optical and electrical effects of these embedded particles on the power conversion efficiency are examined rigorously using both experimental and computer simulation. Gold nanoparticles of particular size and spatial distribution enhance the device efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose design considerations for utilizing the entire AM1.5 spectrum using plasmonic structures towards enhancing the efficiency of polymer solar cells using broad spectrum plasmonics.
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are attracting significant interest, mainly due to their perceived lower cost, ease of manufacture based on roll-to-roll processing, mechanical flexibility, light weight suitable for portability, and relatively high power conversion efficiencies comparable with hydrogenated amorphous silicon. Despite these advantages, OPV devices suffer from inefficient light absorption due to the relatively smaller thickness of active layer, a fundamental requirement to mitigate its low mobility and thereby lower extraction and transportation efficacies of the generated charges. Another performance bottleneck is the limited utilization of the entire AM1.5 spectrum, a limitation which arises from the physical properties of the materials, such as the band gap of the photo-active layer. It has been demonstrated that structuring the front surface of a material with a refractive index n with small micron sized pyramids can enhance efficiency proportional to 4n2 by scattering light into different angles and thus increasing the absorption path.1 However, this approach is difficult to implement in thin film OPVs, where the total active layer thickness is only a few hundreds of nanometers. In addition, structuring the surface does not allow one to utilize wavelengths which are not directly absorbed in the active material. These unabsorbed wavelengths can cause thermal effects at the back and front contact by exciting phonons. This thermal effect may lead to a further decrease in efficiency and life time, if careful precautions are not taken. Incorporation of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) with sizes smaller than the wavelengths of light in the AM1.5G solar spectrum to create and utilize surface plasmons for trapping the light into the photonic devices2,3 is a promising alternative solution.4–6 It has been shown that the high contrast between the refractive index of metal and the surrounding medium works much like a very fine waveguide coupling efficiently the light (forward scattering) into the absorber.7,8 The strong local electric field due to surface plasmons can enhance the exciton dissociation in OPVs contributing positively to power conversion.9,10 Furthermore recent studies demonstrated that the NPs can lead to an enhancement of the OPV device structural stability as well.11–13
Methods to synthesize and incorporate MNPs are in abundance. Chemical synthesis can give precise control of size, however, it produces a lot of hazardous wastes,14,15 with a requirement of an additional process step for deposition. Photo-reduction is similar to chemical synthesis although light is used to decompose the precursor and create metal nanoparticles.16 Thermal annealing of thin metal films inside ovens within an inert atmosphere requires extended time periods and the processing area is limited to the oven's dimensions, while the process is incompatible with flexible plastic substrates.17 e-Beam lithography allows for superior control over the minimum feature size but can only be used for small areas in practice due to severe time demand for processing. Herein, we present a method for fabricating metal nanoparticles of various sizes directly on polymers by rapid laser annealing of thin metal coatings. The method features rapid processing times in air or vacuum, allowing the raster scanning of large areas very fast, favorable for industrial production of OPVs on flexible substrates such as in roll-to-roll processes.18 The ability to control the metal nanoparticle dimensions,19 and the possibility to create alloy nano-particles20 for tuning the surface plasmon resonance, linked with no chemical wastes, are distinct advantages of the process. Finally, nano-growth processes involving lasers are known for the excellent quality of produced nanostructures.21
When a thin metal film is laser irradiated at adequate fluence, metal nanoparticles can be formed if the molten film is unstable on the substrate surface.22–25 For very short light pulses in the order of nanoseconds (ns) the heating and cooling transient periods are extremely short.24,26 This short time scale implies that the laser-induced thermal effects are localized and heat diffusion is limited within an epidermic layer only on the surface of the irradiated area. Therefore this method allows fabrication of metal nanoparticles directly onto substrates made of temperature sensitive materials such as polymers without damaging their physical properties.
OPVs were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with the following device structure: glass/ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/metal nanoparticles/PEDOT:PSS/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-c61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al as shown in Fig. 1. All substrates were initially cleaned by ultrasonication in water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, respectively, and subsequently blow dried with nitrogen. Oxygen plasma treatment was applied for 5 min to further clean the samples and enhance the ITO electrical properties.27 PEDOT:PSS from Baytron was spin cast on top to form the first layer with an average thickness of 35 nm. The substrates were annealed for 10 min at 150 °C in air and transferred into a thermal evaporator for Au deposition. A thin gold layer was deposited on four substrates at different thicknesses ranging from 0.6, 1, 3 and 5 nm at a deposition rate of 0.2 Å s−1. Thereafter all substrates were placed on a translation stage set to move at a speed of 60 mm min−1 where they were laser annealed in air using a 248 nm KrF excimer pulsed laser at the fluence of 53 mJ cm−2 and a repetition rate of 20 Hz to fabricate metal nanoparticles. A second PEDOT:PSS layer was applied subsequently by drop casting and spinning at 8500 rpm each substrate to create a thin film of ∼8 nm followed by thermal treatment for 10 min at 150 °C in air. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box and solution with a blend of P3HT:PCBM (20 mg:20 mg) in 1 ml of o-dichlorobenzene was spin cast on top of the second PEDOT:PSS layer. The stratified structure was dried at 120 °C for 10 min and films of BCP (7 nm) and Al (90 nm) were evaporated through a shadow mask to form the back contact (Fig. 1g).

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-meter under AM 1.5 G using an Oriel solar simulator and with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. A calibration cell from Newport was used to calibrate the solar simulator intensity. The external quantum efficiencies of the devices were acquired using a Bentham PVE300 photovoltaic characterization system. The Hall mobility of the PEDOT:PSS with Au nanoparticles was measured using a PCB SPCB-01 Hall effect probe from ECOPIA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersion X-ray (EDX) spectrum were acquired using a Quanta 200 F microscope from FEI. The photoluminescence (PL) of the samples was measured using a Cary Eclipse spectrometer from Varian exciting them with a beam at 570 nm wavelength. For the Raman measurements, a Renishaw micro-Raman 2000 system with a 782 nm laser at 4 mW was used. A (50×) optical lens was used to focus the laser down to approximately 1 μm diameter spot. The detector integration time was set as 1 s and 50 accumulations at the same location were acquired to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

Fig. 2a–e shows SEM images of MNPs formed on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer after laser annealed at 53 mJ cm−2 for all Au films with a thickness of 0.6, 1, 3, and 5 nm, respectively. An EDX study on a representative film with the initial Au thickness of 1 nm revealed that Au particles exist on the substrates (Fig. 2, inset).

Analyzing the MNP layers one can observe that the irradiated thin Au films with 0.6 and 1 nm thickness produced large particles with wide separations, while for thicker Au films of 3 and 5 nm, dense nanoparticle films with smaller size particles were produced. For thick metal films, the energy is mainly absorbed in the metal, breaking the initial film to small droplets. Due to the very short solidification time small particles are formed without any aggregation between them. Conversely, in 0.6 and 1 nm thin films, the lower metal thicknesses allow higher transparency. Hence, extra energy is absorbed into the PEDOT:PSS layer underneath raising its temperature. That accumulation of extra thermal energy in the substrate subsequently decreases the cooling rate, allowing extra time for aggregation of small particles into bigger ones and consequently particles with longer separation distances are formed.
The PEDOT:PSS layer serves a dual functionality. First, it serves as an electron blocking layer for organic solar cells in the active layer and second, as a buffer layer to prevent ITO from being thermally damaged upon UV laser irradiation and lower its conductivity. Furthermore, the second PEDOT:PSS thin layer (∼8 nm) spin coated on top of the metal nanoparticle films (MNFs) was used to minimize the film roughness and prevent recombination of electron–hole pairs on the surface of metal nanoparticles. This extra film was kept very thin to minimize the degradation of the surface plasmon induced localized electric field.28

Fig. 3 displays the optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signature for all substrates with different Au particle sizes, as well as the current–voltage curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of solar cells made with them. For large particle MNFs in Fig. 2b and c with 65 nm and 45 nm diameters, respectively, and wide spatial separation, the absorption is relatively low (Fig. 3a). The lower values at long wavelengths, which were recorded for MNFs with 45 nm particle diameters compared to the reference substrate (ITO coated glass with spin coated and laser annealed two PEDOT:PSS layers), can be attributed to forward scattering, which dominates in the extinction of particles with big diameters. Vice versa for dense MNFs with small diameter particles of 22 nm and 15 nm (Fig. 2d and e), the absorption component in the particles' extinction is prominent. The characteristic peak near 370 nm observed at all absorption curves (Fig. 3a) can be attributed to the PEDOT:PSS.29

Colors represent results for substrates with the same particles diameter, black for 65 nm particles, red for 45 nm, blue for 22 nm, pink for 15 nm and green for no particles (reference). 
The hypothesis that forward scattering at long wavelengths is stronger for MNFs with big particles while absorption is dominant at small particles was verified by a theoretical model (Fig. 3b and c). The scattering and absorption components of extinction were calculated with a simulation tool30 by considering a single Au particle with diameter equal to the real ones acquired from the SEM images for each different substrate. The model simulated the particles embedded in a dielectric medium with refractive index 1.53 similar to that of PEDOT:PSS,31 and is shown in Fig. 3b and c.
The fabricated plasmonic cells and the reference one were characterized under AM1.5G at 1000 W m−2 to determine their performance. Fig. 3d and e shows the current density–voltage (J–V) and the EQE for each cell.
The samples with the relatively large particles, 65 nm and 45 nm diameter, show an enhancement in the short circuit current density, compared to the reference cell (Fig. 3d). An analysis of the EQE measurements is displayed in Fig. 3e, and shows the photocurrents for the films with big particles (65 and 45 nm) to be higher compared to reference for almost the entire active spectrum of the photoactive film. The photocurrent reaches its maximum near 600–650 nm, the region where the scattering is maximum in agreement with the simulations (Fig. 3b and c). For the samples with small particles (22 and 15 nm) the generated photocurrent is reduced below the recorded response of the reference cell for wavelengths between 400 nm and 650 nm. This effect could be due to strong absorption of light occurring at nanoparticles, a hypothesis that agrees well with our simulations. Thus, a lower number of photons interact with the photoactive layer. Intriguingly, enhanced photocurrent is observed for all films with metal nanoparticles in the region 300–400 nm in comparison with the reference. That enhancement could indicate that the charges are extracted more efficiently from the films with metal nanoparticles, an assumption which is verified by the mobility measurements for the PEDOT:PSS films. Indeed as shown in Table 1 the enhanced charge extraction in the PEDOT:PSS films doped with the relatively big particles is prominent, attributed to the lower sheet resistance, as opposed to the small particles where they exhibit higher sheet resistance4 with a concomitant decrease in the film's mobility.

Thus, the current density enhancement can be attributed to two parameters. First, the improved extraction and collection of charges as a result of the higher mobility of nanoparticles containing PEDOT:PSS films. This can be seen in the EQE as a photo-current enhancement through the entire photoactive spectrum of the P3HT:PCBM blend. Second, for samples with big particles (65 and 45 nm) the increased number of photons penetrate into the active layer, due to enhanced forward scattering components, in agreement with previous studies.32 This increases the number of photo-generated electrons and induces a characteristic EQE peak near the surface plasmon resonance (630 nm) of particles.
The difference in refractive index between the Au particles and PEDOT:PSS forms a planar waveguide7 managing efficiently the incoming light. In addition, the strong local electric field can enhance the exciton dissociation in the active layer, a concept which has been proven experimentally at other studies.33–35 In contrast, in dense particle films the absorption of light at metal nanoparticles near the SPR dominates. This results in a reduced number of photons in the active layer (Fig. 3e), affecting the total performance of the solar cells. The exciton dissociation in dense films with small nanoparticles (22 and 15 nm) is better than that of the reference, as the PL indicates lower quenching (Fig. 4a) in agreement with previous studies.36,37 The lower PL quenching can be attributed to the strong local electric field at the particles' vicinity which promotes the exciton dissociation.33–35 Furthermore, the high density of particles with small separation distances causes an extra shadowing effect, undesirable for high efficiency photovoltaics.

The PL study verified that extra quenching occurring in all films with particles compared to the reference, which is a desirable effect for enhancing the short circuit current. The lower quenching in films with big particles strengthens the assumption that the power conversion enhancement is mainly due to the dominant scattering effect for the large particles (Fig. 3 and 4) and with only a small contribution of the SPR generated E-field for those substrates. Furthermore, the higher mobility at PEDOT:PSS films doped with big Au particles (Table 1) provides a better charge transportation mechanism minimizing the current losses.
The higher quenching for dense NMFs of relatively small (15 nm) Au particles and the relatively high generated current compared to the film with slightly bigger particles (22 nm) is a consequence of the stronger SPR E-field at small particles where the absorption is dominating. However, the reduced photon flux which reaches the active layer due to the SPR absorption and shadowing effect from nanoparticles leads to reduced efficiencies.
A Raman study (Fig. 4b) was performed to determine the crystallization levels in the active layer.38 A higher crystallization may be expected in the devices with higher metal quantities in PEDOT:PSS due to the higher heat capacity and thermal-conductivity. This could result in higher heat transfer rates during the cell annealing process enabling enhancement of the phase separation in the blended active layer with consequently higher performances. A 782 nm laser was used as a probe light for the measurements. The wavelength of the probe light was chosen carefully to be as far away from the SPR as possible to eliminate signal distortion from effects such as surface enhanced Raman scattering.
The Raman signal for different metal thickness indicates that the crystallization and phase separation were similar for all substrates, independent of the metal nanoparticles size and density in the PEDOT:PSS film. Thus, it is suggested that the variations in power conversion efficiencies are purely due to the optical and electromagnetic modes which metal nanoparticles exhibit, as well as the improved charge extraction consequences of the enhanced mobility at the PEDOT:PSS films containing metal nanoparticles, other than any physical change in the PEDOT:PSS.
Having demonstrated that metal nanoparticles can enhance or suppress the power conversion by interacting with the impinging light, a further study was performed to determine their role in the electron–hole recombination process, critical to achieve the optimum power conversion. It has been reported by different groups that plain metal particles on the front contact39 or inside the active layer40 of photovoltaic cells can degrade their efficiency. This is an effect which is debated in the plasmonic solar cells community. Considering that the local field from SPR rapidly dissipates with distance, one would expect that the shorter the distance between the nanoparticles and the active layer, the stronger the expected effect due to the SPR electric field.
To investigate this hypothesis, a series of plasmonic substrates were prepared as described previously with an identical initial metal film thickness of 5 nm Ag. After laser annealing, metal nanoparticles with an average size of 17 nm were produced. The substrates were coated with a second PEDOT:PSS layer using different spin coating speeds of 5500, 6500, 7500 and 8500 rpm to achieve different thicknesses. One substrate was left without a second PEDOT:PSS layer. Ag particles were used instead of Au, in this case, because they exhibit a stronger SPR field.7 Hence the effect should be stronger. The corresponding absorption spectra are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As expected, the absorption in the substrate without the second PEDOT:PSS layer is lower compared to the films with the additional layer. Interestingly, for the device with no second layer of PEDOT:PSS, the efficiency was lower compared with those that have the thin PEDOT:PSS second layer (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†).
The film with the thinnest PEDOT:PSS (∼8 nm) for the second layer spun at 8500 rpm gave the highest performance. This sample had the best fill factor among the samples with the additional layer. Indeed, the particles in that sample were closer to the active layer, compared to those formed with the thicker second PEDOT:PSS layer. Thus one should expect that in this sample the SPR E-field is stronger at the active layer, thus the effect from particles SPR should be stronger and higher efficiency should be observed. Increasing the thickness of the second PEDOT:PSS layer damps the efficiency, indicating that the thickness of PEDOT:PSS affects both the fill factor of the solar cell as well as the effect of the surface plasmon induced E-field at the active layer, since the E-field degrades very fast with distance.28
Analyzing more carefully the device structure, the active layer is a blend of two semiconducting materials, therefore for the front contact surface it is expected that both donor and acceptor materials coexist in the same layer (Fig. 4d). For a device without a second PEDOT:PSS layer, although the surface plasmon field can enhance the exciton dissociation, the areas where a metal nanoparticle is at the boundary between donor and acceptor regions, it can act as an ohmic link between the two semiconducting materials. Vice versa for devices with the second layer, the PEDOT:PSS acts as an electron block layer reducing the probability of electron–hole recombination on the MNP's surface.
Thus, the decrease in cell's performance which was observed in some case studies reported in the literature with the incorporation of metal nanoparticles is expected to be due to holes and electrons recombining at the metal nanoparticle, reducing the output current. Furthermore the strong light absorption into small particles, at wavelengths where the photoactive layer is active, leads to reduced photocurrent.
Conclusions
In summary, it has been demonstrated experimentally and verified theoretically that metal nanoparticles produced by in situ laser annealing of metal thin films deposited on the front contact of a polymer heterojunction solar cell can enhance or suppress the efficiency of the solar cell depending on the MNPs size, spacing, density in the film, and their distance from the photoactive layer. All experimental results were obtained from relatively large area 0.73 cm2 solar cells, demonstrating that this method can be easily used for up-scaled devices. Furthermore due to its versatility the laser nanostructuring method can be applied to other polymers or inorganic material models. Intuitively, we can note some key features for designing broadband polymer plasmonic solar cells.
Metal nanoparticles independent of their position (front–back electrode, photoactive layer) in the solar cell structure should be isolated from the active material with a very thin layer such as PEDOT:PSS or by encapsulating the MNPs within a dielectric coating to facilitate the strong local surface plasmon electric field but prevent recombination of dissociated electron–hole pairs on their surface.
Metal nanoparticles placed at the front contact (before the active layer) should generally be large where the scattering component dominates to minimize losses from absorption of light in particles (Fig. 4c and d). Generally, Au nanoparticles have stronger scattering mode than absorption.7 In addition, the Fermi level of Au aligns well with PEDOT:PSS 4.7–5.5 eV, favourable for the front contacts minimizing the probability for charge trapping. Calculations performed to optimize particle size for the specified surrounding material allow efficient waveguide modes (45–65 nm for PEDOT:PSS based on our experimental data) as well as wide space distributions to minimize possible shadowing effects.
Nanoparticles in the active layer have to be small in order for the absorption mode to dominate and a strong electric dipole to occur due to their SPR. The strong electric field can enhance the efficiency of exciton dissociation and consequently the current intensity. The optimum size of nanoparticles should be calculated in accordance with the type of encapsulating dielectric for optimum results. Generally, Ag metal nanoparticles have stronger absorption and local SPR. Although Ag is a good material for particles with SPR, the ideal particles for exciton dissociation enhancement should exhibit strong surface plasmon resonance at wavelengths away from the useful absorption spectrum for the active layer (indicated with the blue color in Fig. 4d). This can allow the entire AM1.5 G spectrum to be utilized and to minimize the undesirable thermal effects from wavelengths which are not absorbed in the active layer. Such particles with SPR in the infrared spectrum have been reported before with ITO and Cu2−xSe.41,42
Nanostructures at the back contact should be a combination of both big and small sizes, carefully designed to achieve the desired effects. For small features, the absorption mode dominates, enhancing the surface plasmon waves developed across the boundary of the back metal contact and the photoactive layer,43,44 enhancing the exciton dissociation with the strong E-field.6,45 Large particles would increase the scattering and redistribution of the unabsorbed photons in the active layer at different angles, increasing the active path and therefore the probability that photons are absorbed.6 Assuming that these particles are all part of the back contact, careful consideration must be taken into account regarding the materials used, to avoid misalignment of the electronic band level, which can introduce charge trapping states and therefore reduction in the Jsc and degradation in the Voc.
