    , Accepted 17th June 2016First published on 21st June 2016AbstractWe have devised a new porphyrin dye Y1A1 for photovoltaic applications under both light sources of AM1.5G standard conditions and low light intensity at 300–2400 lux. The dye Y1A1 is tailored with two 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl groups at meso-10,20-positions which helps the solubility of the molecule in solvents and avoids involvement of the hazardous chemical n-butyllithium, which is used during the synthesis of some typical high efficiency porphyrins such as YD2-o-C8 and LD-series dyes. The dye is also structurally simple so that large-scale synthesis for future industrial applications becomes feasible. The Y1A1-based cells were found to exhibit higher performance using I−/I3− rather than Co2+/3+ electrolytes in the presence of CDCA co-adsorbent. The addition of Li+ additive to the GuSCN-free electrolyte benefits the performance in terms of higher capacitance at the compensation of surface charge recombination and electron lifetime. The optimized cells based on Y1A1 showed a power conversion efficiency of 9.22% under AM1.5G conditions and as high as 19.5% when illuminated under 350 lux of LED light.
Introduction
Solar cells are well-known devices for converting energy from the sun into a flow of electrons. To provide controllable and comparable testing conditions for solar cells, standard 1 Sun conditions (100 mW cm−2) are generally used in laboratories for mimicking outdoor environments which typically shed light with an intensity of >100000 lux. In contrast, the indoor light inside buildings can be considered as low light or dim light due to its relatively lower photon flux. These buildings including homes, schools, offices, factories, hospitals and stores require light sources with brightness typically ranging between 300–500 lux. The higher light level demand of specific areas such as laboratories, reading rooms, production halls, first aid rooms and showrooms requires light illumination of 500–1500 lux. With the concept of indoor energy-harvesting aiming at these reachable light sources, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are certainly one of the most promising light-to-electricity conversion technologies.1 DSCs have drawn growing attention since the pioneering work initiated by Grätzel's group.2 In the past two decades, molecular engineering of dyes has yielded several kinds of molecular architectures for efficient solar-to-electricity conversion.3,4 These high performance dyes include ruthenium polypyridyl complexes,5,6 arylamine-based organic dyes7–12 and porphyrin-based dyes.13–15
The absorption of typical porphyrins consists of intense Soret bands and moderate Q bands, with absorption coefficients of hundreds of thousands as well as tens of thousands M−1 cm−1, respectively. The unique light-harvesting properties ensure minimum loading of porphyrin dyes on compact TiO2 layers.16–21 Dyes such as YD2-o-C8,21 GY50,17 SM315,22 XW-4,23 XW-11,24 WW-6,25 LD31 and LD1426 have been proven to be high efficiency dyes, with a characteristic push–pull type geometry with D–ZnP–π–A or D–π–ZnP–π–A frameworks, where D, ZnP, π and A usually denote the arylamino donor, zinc porphyrin, acetylene and aryl carboxylic acceptor/anchor groups, respectively. Apart from engineering of semiconductors27 and counter electrodes, considerable efforts have focused on molecular engineering of donor22,24,25,28 and acceptor entities,29,30 π-conjugated spacers,31–34 and the use of co-sensitization counterparts23,26,35 and suitable electrolytes36 in order to achieve high efficiencies. Recent reports have shown that enlarged open-circuit voltage and conversion efficiency can be obtained for DSCs using Co2+/3+ trisbipyridine complexes as redox shuttles.21 However, efforts should be made to suppress fast interfacial charge recombination of cobalt complexes. For example, introduction of bulky arylamine donors25 and/or long hydrophobic alkyl substituents22 has been shown to successfully decrease the charge recombination rate, thus increasing the photovoltage and power conversion efficiency.
Due to insufficient absorption of porphyrins in the green region, usually ancillary dyes are utilized as co-sensitizers to achieve a stable conversion efficiency over the entire visible region in the IPCE spectrum and reduce back electron transfer. Recent reports have demonstrated that DSC devices using I−/I3− electrolytes can achieve a high power conversion efficiency of >10% by judicious molecular engineering of porphyrin dyes and employing co-sensitization techniques.36 However, these porphyrin molecules are generally functionalized with multiple groups which complicate the dye synthesis and are expensive. Relatively simple D–π–ZnP–π–A dyes such as LD1637 perform exceptionally well (VOC = 0.71 V; JSC = 20.59 mA cm−2; η = 10.24%) using I−/I3−-based electrolytes. The inclusion of 2,6-dialkoxyphenyl groups at the meso-10,20-positions of porphyrins appear to be key since the first introduction of such groups in the porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 improved its ability to retard intermolecular aggregation and back electron transfer.21 Nevertheless, the introduction of 2,6-dialkoxyphenyl simultaneously introduces disadvantages such as synthetic complexity38,39 and utilization of hazardous chemicals, e.g., n-butyllithium, which largely limit large-scale dye synthesis and potential industrial applications. With substituted bulkier amine, the dye WW-5 with meso-10,20-functionalized mesityl groups exhibits a promising conversion efficiency of 10.3% (VOC = 0.766 V; JSC = 18.43 mA cm−2) which is comparable to the conversion efficiency of 10.5% (VOC = 0.809 V; JSC = 17.69 mA cm−2) of WW-6 which is functionalized with 2,6-dialkoxylphenyl groups.25 Again, the latter two with sophisticated design of a bulky donor make the dye synthesis more time-consuming and less industrially applicable.
In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become an attractive research area because of their high cell performance. The drawbacks of the high cost of hole-transporting materials, instability of devices and environmentally detrimental lead-based materials limit the application of perovskite photovoltaics in the near future. In this regard, dye-sensitized solar cells based on porphyrin photosensitizers and less harmful iodide–triiodide electrolytes offer a compromising solution to energy conversion in ambient environments. Obviously, it appears to be an essential requirement to develop relatively simple and cost-effective dyes for practical encapsulation of DSCs into end products for the community. That is, the molecular design of sensitizers should be a trade-off between large scale syntheses and device efficiency. DSCs should also rely on minimum co-sensitizers and cobalt-based electrolytes as well as exhibit sufficient power generation in both outdoor and indoor environments so that feasible applications of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells would become possible.
In this study, we have developed a new porphyrin dye Y1A1 (Fig. 1) which is structurally simple and there is no need to use hazardous chemicals for its synthesis and it demonstrates promising DSC performance under 1 Sun and dim light conditions. The Y1A1-based DSC shows a power conversion efficiency of 9.22% under AM1.5 conditions and 13.5–19.5% under light illumination of 300–2400 lux. It is undoubtedly an important breakthrough for DSCs to step toward practical applications.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic strategy of Y1A1 involves stepwise functionalization of porphyrin rings,19,32,40e.g., bromination and successive Sonogashira cross coupling of the porphyrin (Scheme 1).41 The formation of porphyrin 1 involved condensation and oxidation of dipyrromethane and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, which can be easily obtained via direct methylation of commercially available 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde.42,43 With the aforementioned starting materials, it is easier to prepare the porphyrin via Lindsey's approach44 in tens of grams without handling a huge quantity of n-butyl lithium for the synthesis of 2,6-dialkoxybenzaldehyde, which is an intermediate generally used for the preparation of highly efficient porphyrin dyes.21–23,25,26,31–33,37,45–50 Further metallation of porphyrin 1 with zinc acetate followed by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide gave 5,15-dibromoporphyrin 2. Sonogashira coupling of 2 with trimethylsilyl acetylene (TMSA) and subsequent de-protection of the silyl group yielded the diethynyl-substituted porphyrin intermediate, which underwent second Sonogashira coupling with N,N-bis(octyloxy)-para-iodoaniline and para-iodobenzoic acid to give the push–pull porphyrin dye Y1A1 as a dark-green powder. Like the 10,20-bis(2,6-bis(alkyloxy)phenyl)porphyrin analogues, Y1A1 is air-stable and soluble in common organic solvents owing to its lateral alkylaniline and two 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl groups.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
As a push–pull type of porphyrin dye, Y1A1 exhibits extensive absorption in the visible region with the Soret band and Q band at 459 nm (ε = 2.49 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and 678 nm (ε = 1.07 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively (Fig. 2 and S1 in the ESI†). This electronic excitation pattern quite resembles that of the 2,6-bis(alkyloxy)phenyl analogues23,32,37,46 with larger absorption coefficients for the Soret band. The superior spectral coverage is beneficial to remarkable light-harvesting from irradiation light sources, as illustrated by the spectral overlap of Y1A1 and solar irradiance (Fig. 2a). It is found that Y1A1 also has good spectral overlap with commercial light sources such as T5 fluorescent and LED lamps, especially in the region of Soret absorption (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon inspired us to investigate the light-to-electricity conversion in an ambient environment. Unlike the AM1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2), the indoor environment is usually full of various dim light sources, including fluorescent and LED lamps. Compared to that in the solution phase, the thin film samples of the Y1A1 dye showed much more broadened Soret and Q bands owing to the aggregation of dye molecules (Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI†). This phenomenon remains almost unchanged in the case when CDCA is co-adsorbed during the dye immersion process, indicating the limited influence of CDCA on the intermolecular interactions of Y1A1 on the TiO2 surface.

The electrochemical properties of Y1A1 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Two reversible oxidation waves were observed at +0.85 and +1.03 V vs. NHE (Fig. S3a in the ESI†), corresponding to electron abstraction at arylamine and porphyrin cores, respectively.18,20,32 A reversible reduction was also observed at −0.99 V due to electron addition to the porphyrin–ethynylbenzoic acid conjugate.32,51 The calculated first excited state energy level of Y1A1 is −0.96 V vs. NHE. The differences between its energy levels and those of iodine-based electrolytes and TiO2 conduction band Fermi level (TiO2cb) are 0.45 and 0.49 V, respectively (Fig. S3b in the ESI†). This ensures a sufficient driving force for charge injection from the dye LUMO to TiO2cb and dye regeneration by redox electrolytes.
Photovoltaic performances
Although Y1A1 shows similar electrochemical and photophysical properties to other D–ZnP–π–A or D–π–ZnP–π–A type porphyrins, solar cells fabricated with them exhibit quite different behavior, indicating that the peripheral functional groups undoubtedly play a crucial role in device performance. Fig. 3 displays the J–V plot of solar cells fabricated with Y1A1 or the benchmark dye (YD2-o-C8) in the presence of CDCA co-adsorbent. The electrolyte systems that underwent tests are those based on Co2+/3+ (including Co(bpy)32+ (0.165 M), Co(bpy)33+ (0.045 M), tBP (0.8 M) and LiTFSI (0.1 M)) or I−/I3− (including I2 (0.05 M), LiI (0.05 M), PMII (1 M) and tBP (0.5 M)). A conversion efficiency of 7.42% with high VOC and JSC was observed for YD2-o-C8 whereas a relatively lower conversion efficiency of 5.12% for Y1A1 was observed under the same conditions when a cobalt electrolyte was employed (Fig. 3a and Table 1). This is due to the effective insulation of the cobalt electrolyte from the TiO2 surface and anti-aggregation of dye molecules owing to the introduction of hydrophobic octyloxy chains of meso-phenyls in YD2-o-C8. Replacement of the cobalt electrolyte by I−/I3− leads to a lower FF with decreased VOC and increased JSC for both dyes. Eventually there is no significant increase in the efficiency of YD2-o-C8 (7.54%). However, a dramatic increase in the current density and hence the efficiency (8.11%) was observed for Y1A1. This is evidenced by a fairly constant elevated IPCE covering the range 400–750 nm (Fig. 3b). The better permeation ability of iodide/triiodide-based electrolytes allows the usage of thicker TiO2 layers for more dye loading benefiting the light-harvesting capability. Furthermore, since co-adsorption of CDCA does not significantly affect the intermolecular interactions of Y1A1 on TiO2, it is suggested that the enhanced IPCE is partially attributed to adsorbed CDCA which serves as a passivation layer on the TiO2 surface.

The Y1A1-based DSCs were further tested under conditions with a variety of parameters to study the effect of different additives and co-adsorbent CDCA. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2. In the presence of GuSCN as an electrolyte additive, the device exhibited a conversion efficiency of 3.77% as shown in entry A in Table 2, with a VOC and JSC of 0.71 V and 6.86 mA cm−2, respectively. As expected, the presence of LiI as the electrolyte additive leads to a dramatic increase of efficiency (η = 6.44%) owing to approximately doubled JSC at the compensation of a slight drop in VOC and FF (entry C). It is rationalized that lithium cations caused a downward shift of the conduction band edge which eventually leads to enhanced injection efficiency.52–54 Co-adsorption of CDCA with the dye under the aforementioned electrolyte conditions leads to a slight increase in performance with an efficiency of up to 3.90% for entry B and 7.36% for entry D. Again, co-adsorbed CDCA fills the vacancies on the TiO2 surface, which helps to reduce charge recombination via surface passivation. We note that the GuSCN additive is often considered to promote the efficiency as a collective result of offsetting the slower charge recombination (via surface passivation) and downward shifted conduction band edge.55,56 Alternatively, removing GuSCN in our case probably would not affect the recombination since the surface can also be passivated by CDCA. Furthermore, the cell can gain more photocurrent in terms of the negatively shifted conduction band edge. It turns out that the GuSCN-free device (entry E) has the best conversion efficiency of 9.22% (JSC = 18.57 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.658 V; FF = 0.753) and outperforms other LiI and/or CDCA-containing devices. It is noted that the removal of the CDCA co-adsorbent from device E results in a declined conversion efficiency of 7.87% (VOC = 0.656 V; JSC = 16.13 mA cm−2; FF = 0.744) primarily due to decreased JSC, indicating that CDCA is non-negligible (entry F). In combination with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, the efficiency of Y1A1-based devices is superior to those based on YD22 (η = 7.56%),32 XW-4 (η = 7.94%) and YD2 (η = 8.8%). Although some other dyes such as LD16 (η = 10.24%)37 and YD2-o-C8 (η = 9.4%)19 perform even better, from the viewpoint of practical applications, all these dyes suffer from difficulties in bulk synthesis as mentioned above. A brief comparison of the dyes together with the corresponding photophysical properties and device performance parameters is summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† With the amenability of feasible large-scale synthesis, Y1A1 still exhibits exceptional competitiveness to other high performance dyes.

To unveil the internal features of devices, these devices were probed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with different bias under dark conditions. The interfacial charge recombination resistances (Rct), chemical capacitances (Cμ) and recombination lifetimes (τ0) were obtained from fitting experimental data with the transmission line model proposed by J. Bisquert57,58 and were plotted as a logarithmic function of the applied bias (Fig. 5). The Li+-containing devices C/D/E have lower Rct compared to the Li+-free devices A/B at identical applied bias, showing increased surface charge recombination of the former cases (Fig. 5a). The ∼80 mV potential difference between the sets of lines A/B and C/D/E explains the relatively low VOC of the latter than the former as seen in the aforementioned photovoltaic measurements. The presence of Li+ also increases Cμ owing to the positive shift of the conduction band (Fig. 5b).59 Nevertheless, co-adsorption of CDCA causes virtually no changes in Rct and Cμ for the Li+-free devices (B versus A) and Li+-containing devices (D versus C), showing limited influence on band edge movement. The slight difference in the slopes between the sets of Li+-free devices A/B and Li+-containing devices C/D in Fig. 5b probably implies dissimilar energetic distribution of the trap sites.60 We note that the removal of GuSCN (device E) leads to indistinguishable changes in Rct but moderate increase in Cμ, compared to those of devices C/D. This probably indicates that the presence of Li+ with or without guanidinium cations does not induce new traps, echoing our observation in photovoltaic measurements. The electron lifetime (τ0), calculated based on the formula τ0 = RctCμ, is plotted against the applied bias (Fig. 5c). At the indicated applied bias, the Li+-free devices A/B exhibit longer electron lifetimes than Li+-containing ones, whereas CDCA also helps to extend the lifetime (B versus A and D versus C). Eventually, the Li+-containing and GuSCN-free device E has the best performance benefitting from the lowest Rct and highest Cμ at the compensation of reduced electron lifetime. A schematic representation of the density of states of the TiO2 conduction band edge is given in Fig. S4 in the ESI† which shows the proposed influences of electrolyte additives and the CDCA co-adsorbent. The presence of Li+ differentiates device C from A in terms of the downward shifted conduction band position toward the electrolyte redox potential, leading to enhanced injection and recombination simultaneously. Co-adsorption of CDCA results in a slight upward shift in conduction band energy whereas the distribution of trap sites remains roughly unaffected (the cases of B and D). A combined effect of CDCA co-adsorption together with the removal of the GuSCN additive of device E causes upward shifted conduction band energy as well as an increased amount of trap sites, leading to the best performance.

With the promising conversion efficiency of Y1A1 device E, we were encouraged to further test its performance under the illumination of dim light. In this study, the light sources utilized are commercially available T5 and T8 fluorescent lamps as well as LED planar light. The results are displayed in Fig. 6 and listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 6a, the generated electric power (Pmax) is linearly correlated with the incident light power (Pin) with a slope of ca. 0.18. That is, with an illumination intensity of 300–2400 lux (96.8–716.6 μW cm−2), Y1A1 generates an electric power of 16.5–121.0 μW cm−2, corresponding to the conversion efficiencies of 13.5–19.5% (Fig. 6b and Table S2 in the ESI†). The DSCs based on the porphyrin dye Y1A1 greatly outperform those using organic dyes, where the conversion efficiencies of ca. 4.9–5.7% (corresponding to 16–19 μW cm−2) under ca. 1200 lux of incident light were reported.61 The device exhibits a smooth JSC increment of ca. 0.12 μA cm−2 lux−1 with a VOC of 0.47–0.57 V toward increasing light intensity (Fig. 6c and d). It is noted that the device Y1A1 performs slightly better under LED light rather than under fluorescent lamps as indicated in Fig. 6b. For example, the cell generates a power of 18.1 μW cm−2 (η = 16.4%), 16.6 μW cm−2 (η = 14.2%) and 20.3 μW cm−2 (η = 19.5%) under the illumination of T5 and T8 fluorescent lamps and LED planar light, respectively, at an intensity of 104 μW cm−2 (350 lux). This is rationalized as better spectral overlap between LED irradiation and light absorption of Y1A1 as mentioned in photophysical measurements. Furthermore, this superior spectral overlap also explains the higher efficiency of Y1A1 under commercial light sources than that under simulated sunlight, resulting in the potential applications of Y1A1-based solar cells toward indoor light-harvesting and energy conversion. It is noteworthy that our porphyrin-based DSCs show comparable photocurrent generation but lower voltage generation (JSC = 75.1–83 μA cm−2; VOC = ca. 0.49 V) as compared to reported perovskite-based cells (JSC = 62–81 μA cm−2; VOC = 0.53–0.83 V),62 under illumination of 600 lux light. This finding also hints that future design of porphyrin-sensitized cells with the least VOC = ca. 0.6 V under dim light irradiation could be the core competence in competing with other photovoltaic technologies for indoor applications.

The results are based on devices fabricated under conditions E in Table 2. 
To evaluate the stability of the Y1A1 sensitizer in indoor environments, a Y1A1-sensitized cell fabricated with an MPN-based electrolyte was aged in a programmable oven. It is found that the PCE decayed by only 2.7% (from 5.22% to 5.08%, shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI†) after applying a 750 hour aging treatment consisting of heating at 30 °C for 250 hours, 40 °C for 300 hours and 30 °C for 200 hours, representing that Y1A1 is preliminarily stable in this simulated indoor environment. It was found that the decay can be attributed to the corrosion of the counter electrode after the devices were analyzed by EIS (shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI†), because the Rct of the counter electrode detected in the high frequency region has been increased from 2.88 to 5.68 Ω cm2.63,64 No obvious change in the middle frequency arc was observed, which represents the charge transfer behavior at the TiO2/sensitizer interface, indicating that Y1A1 is anchored firmly on the TiO2 surface. Detailed assessment of the stability of Y1A1 is ongoing and will be discussed in the near future.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a new push–pull porphyrin dye Y1A1 for high performance dye-sensitized solar cells. Porphyrin Y1A1-based DSCs exhibited excellent cell performance comparable with the highest performing porphyrin-sensitized solar cells and are inexpensive, which allow their large-scale synthesis. Solar cells photosensitized by Y1A1 have been evidenced to show better performance in combination with I−/I3− than with Co2+/3+ electrolytes. The influences of Li+ and GuSCN additives as well as the CDCA co-adsorbent were also scrutinized in our study. An optimized device of Y1A1 showed the best conversion efficiency of 9.22% (VOC = 0.658 V; JSC = 18.57 mA cm−2; FF = 0.753) in the presence of 0.3 mM CDCA when the electrolyte consists of I2 (0.05 M), LiI (0.07 M), PMII (1 M) and tBP (0.5 M). The device showed superior performance with an output voltage of ca. 0.5 V and conversion efficiencies of 13.5–19.5% under light illumination of 300–2400 lux. In other words, with power generation ranging from 16.5 to 121 mW cm−2 under dim light, the Y1A1-based cell exhibits great potential as a renewable power supply suitable for indoor applications such as the internet of things (IoTs) in the near future.

Device fabrication
For the DSC device fabrication, a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was cleaned (3.1 mm thick, 13 Ω sq−1, 8% haze) by super-sonication in detergent, DI water, and acetone successively. The TiO2 film which consisted of a transparent layer (porous 20 nm particles, eternal materials ltd. R.O.C Taiwan) and scattering layer (400 nm particles, CCIS, Japan) was subsequently screen-printed onto the substrate to a moderate thickness and then was sintered in progressive steps, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min under air flow. The average thickness of the sintered TiO2 film was measured to be 12 + 3 μm with a portable roughness tester (SURFCOM FLEX, ACCRETECH in Japan). After the post-treatment with 40 mM TiCl4 and annealing at 450 °C for 1 h, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into a 0.15 mM porphyrin sensitizer (Y1A1) solution containing 0.3 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (or not) in a THF/EtOH mixture (v/v, 1:1) for two hours. For the fabrication of the cathode, we used the cleaned FTO glass (2.2 mm thick, 8 Ω sq−1) to prepare the platinum (Pt) counter electrode by a two-step dip-coating method in which it was first immersed into a surfactant agent and then into a poly-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (PVP) and Pt solution mixture (PVP–Pt). After rinsing with DI water, the PVP–Pt counter electrode was sintered at 325 °C for one hour. The preparation of PVP–Pt solution was reported in a previous study.65,66 The TiO2 film was rinsed with ethanol after sensitization and then was sealed with a platinum deposited counter electrode at 120 °C with a hot melt film (surlyn, 30 μm), and the formulated electrolyte was injected into the hole drilled from the cathode. The injection hole was sealed by using a thin cover glass with Surlyn at a high temperature of 120 °C and then with a 0.36 cm2 mask attached to the front side. The cobalt-based electrolyte contained 0.165 M [Co(bpy)3][TFSI]2, 0.045 M [Co(bpy)3][TFSI]3, 0.1 M LiTFSI, and 0.8 M tBP in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). Parameters for optimization of the Y1A1 device via engineering of the iodine-based electrolytes is listed in Table 3.

Characterization
The solution-phase UV-visible absorption and emission spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer and JASCO FP-6000 spectrofluorometer, respectively. FAB-MS mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker APEX II spectrometer operating in the positive ion detection mode. Electrochemical tests were performed on a CH Instruments 750A potentiostat using deoxygenated THF as the solvent. Standard cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments based on a three-electrode system were conducted. The working electrode used a BAS glassy carbon (0.07 cm2) disk, while the reference and auxiliary electrodes used Ag/AgCl (saturated) and platinum wire, respectively. Potentials were reported with reference to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple at 23 °C in THF. The working electrode was polished with 0.03 μm aluminium on felt pads (Buehler) and treated ultrasonically for 1 min before each experiment. The reproducibility of individual potential values was within ±5 mV. The J–V curves were measured by using a solar simulator (PEC-L15) under AM1.5G conditions at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 connected to a source meter (Keithley 2400C). The EIS measurements were performed in the dark by using an electrochemical interface workstation (Schlumberger SI-1286) with a HF frequency response analyzer (Schlumberger SI-1255). The impedance data were recorded at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz and at an AC amplitude of 10 mV. A DC potential equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of DSC was applied. The data were analyzed using Z-View software with a relevant equivalent circuit. The thin-film UV-visible measurement was conducted on a sample film with a UV-vis spectrometer (HP8453).
Measurement of thin film absorption for Y1A1 with and without co-adsorption
The FTO substrate containing a 2 μm-thick TiO2 film (porous 20 nm particles, Eternal materials ltd., Taiwan) was immersed into 0.15 mM Y1A1 solution (1:1 THF/EtOH, v/v) with or without 0.3 mM CDCA for two hours. The TiO2 film was rinsed with ethanol after sensitizing and then the UV-visible spectra were recorded with a UV-visible spectrometer.
Measurement of device performance under dim light
Stabilized dim light sources used in this study were home-designed. This system is composed of standard office lighting of a T5 fluorescent lamp (FH14D-EX/T, China Electric Mfg Corporation, Taiwan) or planar LED light (FOP/A/40W/757/U/2x2, Everlight, Taiwan) which is mounted on motor-controlled tracks, and the bottom of the instrument is equipped with a third-party calibrated spectroradiometer (ISM-Lux, Isuzu Optics, Japan). Constant dim levels are achieved by controlling the height of T5 lighting. After the illumination was steadily fixed at the required Lux, the DSC sample was put right at the position of the detecting head of the spectroradiometer. The J–V curves were obtained with a computer-controlled digital source meter (Keithley 2400C, USA) at various dim light levels.
