    , Accepted 1st August 2016First published on 1st August 2016AbstractWurtz-stannite Cu2CdGeS4 nanocrystals were synthesized via a facile hot-injection method at a low temperature. They exhibited low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface and high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Moreover, this DSSC showed a power conversion efficiency of 7.67%, comparable to the Pt-based device (7.54%).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great attention due to their relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low cost and easy fabrication.1–3 As a component playing a significant role in DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) collects electrons from external circuits, transfers electrons to electrolytes, and then catalyzes the reduction of I3− to I−.4 To effectively utilize the photogenerated electrons for the cyclic reactions of iodine redox couples in electrolyte solutions, CE materials should possess low charge resistance, high catalytic activity, and good chemical stability. Platinum (Pt) has been recognized as one of the most efficient CE materials, but is easily corroded by electrolytes, and such corrosion deteriorates the long-term performances of Pt devices.5 Recently, metal sulfides were demonstrated to be promising CE materials in DSSCs.6–10 For example, DSSCs with CoS as the CE material showed a PCE comparable to that of Pt, and this result opened the door to the use of transition metal sulfides in DSSCs.11 However, most studies of sulfide CE materials have mainly focused on binary compounds (e.g., FeS2,6 Co3S4,9,12 NiS,13,14 MoS215 and WS216), whose fixed chemical compositions impede further improvement in their catalytic activity.
Multinary compounds may provide more ways to tune their physical chemistry properties, such as conductivity, band gap and the adsorption–desorption energy of iodine, which are important parameters to adjust when attempting to find highly efficient CE materials.17,18 Additionally, the synergistic effects of the different component elements of multinary compounds can also produce a favourable local coordination environment and electronic structure,19 which is beneficial for enhancing their catalytic activity. Therefore, compared to the simpler compounds, multinary sulfides are expected to show better catalytic activities for the reduction of I3− in DSSCs.20–22 Recently, Park found that under AM 1.5 illumination, the DSSCs with Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnS4 CEs exhibited, respectively, PCE values of 5.6% and 4.0%, which are higher than those of binary and ternary sulfides, i.e., CuS (1.5%), SnS2 (2.4%), Cu2SnS4 (3.2%), and Cu2SnS3 (3.6%).20 Xin et al. reported that Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x displayed a better catalytic activity than did Cu2ZnSnS4 toward the reduction of I3−.23 Also, compared with Sn4+, germanium (Ge)-based sulfides have higher ionic potentials due to the effective static potential of Ge4+,24–26 which could lead to higher polarizability and promote the adsorption of I3−. Thus, Ge-based multinary sulfides may constitute a new and promising type of CE material, and should be studied intensively; in our previous work, DSSCs containing ternary Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals displayed a PCE comparable to those containing Pt.26
As a member of I2–II–IV–VI4 family, orthorhombic Cu2CdGeS4 has a crystal structure similar to that of wurtzite-stannite-structured Cu2ZnSnS4 (Fig. S1, ESI†),27,28 which is expected to show excellent catalytic activity toward iodine redox couples in DSSCs as well.29 However, bulk or thin films of Cu2CdGeS4 have been prepared only by the chemical vapour deposition method or gradient freezing at high temperature (1283 K).30–32 Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a facile method to fabricate Cu2CdGeS4 nanomaterials. In the current investigation, high-quality and monodispersed Cu2CdGeS4 nanocrystals (NCs) were prepared using a facile hot-injection method for the first time. When being employed as a CE material in DSSCs, these NCs exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−, and the device achieved a PCE of 7.67% under AM 1.5 illumination, comparable with that based on Pt (7.54%).
A powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1a) analysis of the as-obtained Cu2CdGeS4 NCs showed that all of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to orthorhombic Cu2CdGeS4 (JCPDS No. 74-0515, space group: Pmn21, a = 7.692 Å, b = 6.555 Å and c = 6.299 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was further used to evaluate the composition of the Cu2CdGeS4 NCs (Fig. S2, ESI†). Strong Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks were observed to be located at 931.82 and 951.64 eV, i.e., with a peak splitting of 19.82 eV, and these peak features are consistent with the reported values for Cu+.33 No Cu2+ satellite peak at 942 eV was observed (Fig. S2a, ESI†), indicating the absence of binary and ternary compounds.22,33 Cd 3d peaks were observed at 404.51 and 411.27 eV, and the 6.76 eV difference between these peaks is consistent with the standard 6.74 eV splitting, suggesting the presence of Cd2+.34 The peak located at 30.81 eV in the Ge 3d spectrum indicated the presence of Ge4+.35 The binding energy of S 2p at 161.57 eV is in agreement with that of S2−.36 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed the Cu:Cd:Ge:S atomic ratio to be 26.44:12.25:12.94:46.36, close to the stoichiometric composition of Cu2CdGeS4 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1b) showed that monodispersed Cu2CdGeS4 NCs with an average size of 18 nm could be prepared on a large scale. Cu2CdGeS4 NCs were observed in an high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1c) to be highly crystalline and to display lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 3.3 Å, 3.2 Å and 3.3 Å, which can be ascribed to the (210), (020) and (−210) planes of orthorhombic Cu2CdGeS4. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1d also revealed the wurtzite structure of the Cu2CdGeS4 NCs.

To study the growth of Cu2CdGeS4 NCs, samples collected at different intervals were examined using XRD (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the products obtained at different reaction times. 
Amorphous products were obtained when the reaction was carried out for 6 min, and crystalline products with the wurtzite structure were obtained when the reaction time was 8 min. Besides Cd and S, Cu was also detected by EDX in the obtained products (Fig. S4, ESI†), implying the formation of a CuxCdyS solid solution due to the rapid diffusion of Cd2+ into CuxS (Fig. S5, ESI†).37 Similar phenomena were also found for the formation of Cu-based multinary sulfide NCs.38–40 With further diffusion of Ge4+ into CuxCdyS, the CuxCdyS gradually transformed into quaternary Cu2CdGeS4 when the reaction time was 12 min, and pure Cu2CdGeS4 NCs with the wurtz-stannite phase was obtained after 70 min.
DSSCs with sandwich-like structures were assembled and tested under 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a, and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The performances of the devices were found to depend on the thickness of the Cu2CdGeS4 layer (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†). When the thickness was about 0.5 μm, the highest PCE of 7.67% was achieved, with a Jsc of 15.89 mA cm−2, Voc of 723 mV, and FF of 66.8%. Meanwhile, the DSSC with a Pt CE exhibited a Jsc of 15.89 mA cm−2, Voc of 726 mV, FF of 65.2%, and PCE of 7.54%. Comparable performances of Cu2CdGeS4 and Pt CEs were also indicated by their similar incident photon to charge carrier efficiency spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†).

To investigate the catalytic activity of Cu2CdGeS4 toward the reduction of I3−, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM of LiI, 1 mM of I2 and 0.1 M of LiClO4 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 with a pyrolytic Pt CE for comparison (Fig. 3b). Both electrodes exhibited two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks. The left one, i.e., that in the low-potential region, corresponded to the oxidation (Ox-1) and reduction (Red-1) of I−/I3−, whereas the right one, i.e., that in the high-potential region, was assigned to the oxidation (Ox-2) and reduction (Red-2) of I2/I3−.41 The profiles and locations of the redox peaks of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE are close to those of the Pt CE, suggesting similar electrocatalytic behaviours. The catalytic activities of the CEs can also be evaluated by the peak current density of Red-1 (JRed1) and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red-1 and Ox-1.42 The Cu2CdGeS4 CE displayed a peak current density of 1.97 mA cm−2, higher than that of the Pt CE (1.83 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the Epp of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE (349 mV) was also found to be smaller than that of the Pt CE (398 mV). The higher peak current density and lower Epp suggested a high catalytic activity of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE for the reduction of I3−, which is a paramount prerequisite for a robust CE in a DSSC.43 Moreover, the linear relationship between square roots of the scan rates and peak current densities indicated that the I−/I3− redox reactions on the Cu2CdGeS4 CE were diffusion controlled (Fig. S8, ESI†).44
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations were further carried out with symmetric cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) to investigate the interfacial charge transfer and mass diffusion kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots derived from dark conditions with a bias DC voltage of 0 V are illustrated in Fig. 3c. The high-frequency cutoff on the real axis was used to determine the internal resistance (Rs), which consists of the electrolytic resistance and contact resistance between the CE materials and the FTO substrate. The radius of the left semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) related to the electrocatalytic activity of the CE, while the right one in the low-frequency zone represents the Nernst diffusion impedance in bulk electrolyte (ZN), derived from the diffusion of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte solution.45 The values of Rs, Rct and ZN were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots, which are summarized in Table 1. Regarding the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, the simulated Rct value of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE was determined to be 1.78 Ω cm2, smaller than that of the Pt CE (2.11 Ω cm2). The result suggested a higher electrocatalytic activity of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE for the reduction of I3− in DSSCs, which could promote regeneration of the dye on photoanodes and further improve the photocurrent density of DSSCs. In addition, the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of Cu2CdGeS4 CE was determined to be 0.63 Ω cm2, comparable with that of the Pt CE (1.67 Ω cm2), revealing faster diffusion kinetics of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte.
Tafel polarization curves are shown in Fig. 3d. The exchange current density (J0) of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE was found to be larger than that of the Pt CE. The J0 value can also be calculated from J0 = RT/nFRct,46 where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant and Rct is charge transfer resistance obtained from the EIS plots. The Rct values calculated from Tafel polarization curves matched the order derived from EIS. In addition, the intersection of the cathodic branch with the y-axis can be regarded as limited current density (Jlim), a parameter depending on the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the redox couple in the electrolyte solution.7Jlim is proportional to Dn: specifically, Jlim = the 2nFCDn/l, where l is the distance between the electrodes in a dummy cell, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3−, and C is the concentration of I3−. Dn can also be obtained by applying the Randles–Sevcik theory:47 here, Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5ν0.5, where Jred is the peak current density of Red1, K is 2.69 × 105, A is the active area of dummy cell, and ν is the scan rate for CV curves. The calculated Dn values were found to be 6.45 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 for the Cu2CdGeS4 CE and 3.21 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1 for the Pt CE. The higher Dn calculated for the Cu2CdGeS4 CE implied its higher diffusion velocity. Note that a higher diffusion velocity generally improves the photovoltaic performances of devices. Apparently, the Dn values from the CV curves and Tafel polarization curves followed the same sequence.
It is well known that the main electrochemical process on the surfaces of CEs involves transferring electrons from the CE to electron acceptors in the electrolyte solution. Thus, the energy structure of the CE materials affects the catalytic performances of DSSCs. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a three-electrode system to determine the energy level of Cu2CdGeS4 NCs (Fig. S9, ESI†). The onset reduction potential (Ered) appeared at −0.75 V relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Then, the conduction band (ECB) of Cu2CdGeS4 NCs was determined to be −3.96 eV from the vacuum level, and the valence band (EVB) was estimated to be −6.09 eV according to the optical band gap of 2.11 eV (Fig. S10, ESI†).48 Apparently, the good match of the energy level of Cu2CdGeS4 with the potential of I−/I3− is beneficial for the charge transfer from the Cu2CdGeS4 CE to the electrolyte (Fig. 4). Thus, the as-prepared Cu2CdGeS4 CE displayed better electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− than did Pt CE.

The start-up behaviour, multiple start/stop capability and photocurrent stability are also important for DSSCs. Fig. 5a shows the start/stop switching of the DSSCs containing the Cu2CdGeS4 CE as determined by alternating between turning on and off the illumination, with the device based on the Pt CE as a reference. The abrupt increase in current density under irradiation meant a fast start-up of the solar cell, and the lack of a delay in starting the cell suggested a high catalytic activity of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE for the redox couple. About 93.96% of the initial photocurrent density was measured after eight cycles, implying a good capability of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE to start multiple times. Additionally, the photocurrent density of the solar cells with the Cu2CdGeS4 CE and Pt CE after 3600 s was about 93.4% and 88.5% of the initial values, respectively (Fig. 5b), demonstrating the better stability of the Cu2CdGeS4 CE, which is in good agreement with the multicycle voltammograms (Fig. S11, ESI†) and EIS sequential scanning (Fig. S12, ESI†).

The on–off plots were achieved by alternately irradiating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening DSSC devices at 0 V, whereas the photocurrent stability was evaluated under a sustained irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 at 0.45 V. 
In conclusion, wurtz-stannite Cu2CdGeS4 NCs have been successfully prepared via a facile hot-injection method, and they display high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−, and excellent electrochemical stability. The DSSC based on the Cu2CdGeS4 CE displayed a PCE of 7.67%, comparable with that of the Pt CE (7.54%). The results may pave the way to synthesize other multinary sulfide CE materials for the purpose of producing highly efficient DSSCs.
