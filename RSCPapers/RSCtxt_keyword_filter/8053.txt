    , Accepted 20th September 2017First published on 20th September 2017AbstractRecently, inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a p–i–n configuration have drawn tremendous interest due to their high efficiency and reduced hysteresis. It has been demonstrated that p–i–n planar PSCs employing organic hole transport materials can obtain excellent photovoltaic performance, but their high cost and poor stability have restrained their further development. Herein, we employ Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide treated NiOx (Li-treated NiOx) as an excellent and robust hole transport layer (HTL) for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs. Compared to the pristine NiOx, the Li-treated NiOx exhibits enhanced electrical conductivity and better band alignment, enabling fast and efficient hole transport as well as exciton separation. The PSC with a Li-treated NiOx HTL shows a significantly improved fill factor and efficiency (from 0.75, 14.46% to 0.79, 17.09%) as well as less hysteresis with satisfactory long-term stability. Furthermore, we obtain a champion efficiency of 18.03% via graded heterojunction engineering. Therefore, our results suggest Li-treated NiOx film is an effective and promising hole transport material for efficient PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received increased attention from researchers recently. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly developed from the original 3.8% to 22.1% since 2009,1–8 attributed to perovskite's high extinction coefficient, adjustable optical band gap, long charge carrier diffusion length and simple fabrication processing.9–14 The regular device architecture of PSCs consists of a methylammonium lead halide perovskite absorber (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Cl, Br) sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL).15–17 In general, electron transport materials are metal oxides or organic molecules such as TiO2,18,19 SnO2,20–24 fullerene (C60),25–27 or phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).28–31 Hole transport materials are mainly organic molecules such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),15,32–34 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),7,22,35 or poly(triarylamine) (PTAA).36,37 The ETLs and the HTLs are both necessary for highly efficient PSCs. However, these organic hole transport materials are either expensive or environmentally unstable which can result in rapid degradation of the perovskite. Therefore, some inorganic metallic compounds have been explored as HTLs to substitute these organic materials.
Compared to those with organic hole transport materials, PSCs based on inorganic hole transport materials such as CuSCN,38–40 NiOx,41–48 CuPc,27,49 and CuOx50 have shown not only low cost but also better stability. Attributed to good energy level matching and great electrical properties, for example, NiOx as an HTL has gained researchers' attention. The PCE has progressed from 7% to over 19% in recent years,51–54 which indicates the great potential of NiOx as a promising HTL in PSCs. The PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS normally show insufficient stability, due to the hygroscopic and acidic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS itself.41,48 NiOx with excellent chemical stability could possibly alleviate this concern.41,44 Although rapid progress in utilizing NiOx HTLs in PSCs has been achieved, the optimization of its electrical and optical properties is still needed to further enhance device performance.
It is well-known that bulk doping can modulate the energy level and conductivity of inorganic charge transport materials, which can boost the PCE of PSCs.44–47,54 Kim et al. employed copper-doped NiOx as an HTL to increase its conductivity and get a deeper valence band maximum (VBM) so that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) were enhanced simultaneously, which led to a PCE of 15.40%.44 Similarly, Chen and Wu et al. adopted the codoping of lithium and magnesium to improve the electrical properties of the NiOx film and obtain good match of the energy bands, which resulted in a certified PCE of >19%.45–47 In addition, surface treatment is also a significant approach to enhance photovoltaic parameters of devices. Bai et al. adopted cholamine as a modification between the perovskite absorber and NiOx HTL to facilitate the carrier transport and achieved a high FF of 0.8 and a PCE of ∼16%.52 Therefore, bulk doping and surface treatment are two good strategies to increase the performance of PSCs.
In this work, we demonstrate efficient inverted heterojunction PSCs based on a solution-processed NiOx HTL. We found that Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) was beneficial for improving the electrical properties of metal oxides.55 Graetzel et al. adopted surface treatment via Li-TFSI to achieve n-doping of TiO2 so that the charge collection ability was improved, which increased the performance of PSCs. So we investigated the annealing temperature of the NiOx film, and ulteriorly treated the surface of the NiOx film with Li-TFSI, which increased the carrier concentration and the electrical conductivity of the NiOx film. Therefore, the charge extraction and transport at the interface of the perovskite and NiOx layer were enhanced effectively, which resulted in increased Jsc and FF. In addition, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the NiOx film was lifted, which enhanced the electron blocking ability and realized less recombination. In the meantime, the VBM of the NiOx film was also lifted, which made the Li-treated NiOx possess suitable VBM band offsets both with the perovskite absorber and with the FTO electrode, making exciton separation more efficient. All these variations induced improvement in the PCE and hysteresis. Finally, we fabricated an efficient p–i–n inverted planar PSC with a best PCE of 18.03% and showed negligible hysteresis. Compared to the device based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL, the device using the Li-treated NiOx HTL demonstrated better long-term stability and could still maintain over 80% of its initial PCE after 600 h. These results indicate that surface treatment is a promising method to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a demonstrates the schematic device configuration of the inverted MAPbI3-based PSC, which is composed of FTO/Li-treated NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM/Bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. As we know, NiOx as an inorganic hole transport material has been widely applied in PSCs. However, the low electrical conductivity of NiOx films limited the hole transport ability to some extent. Therefore, we explored an appropriate annealing temperature for the NiOx film and further utilized Li-TFSI to treat the surface of the NiOx film, to obtain better photovoltaic performance.

We have fabricated PSCs using NiOx with different annealing temperatures as HTLs. Fig. S1 (ESI†) demonstrates the J–V curves of the PSCs employing NiOx HTLs with different annealing temperatures and their photovoltaic parameter statistics are shown in Table S1 (ESI†), from which we know that 400 °C is an optimal annealing temperature. On this basis, we have further prepared PSCs employing a Li-treated NiOx HTL. Unless specified otherwise, the concentration of the Li-TFSI solution is 20 mg mL−1.
To testify whether lithium diffused into the NiOx film, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement for the Li-treated NiOx film to reveal a dynamic process as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Because it is difficult to detect lithium, we used a solution of 100 mg mL−1 to treat the NiOx film here. The peak of Li 1s demonstrated the existence of lithium, which indicated that lithium could also diffuse into the NiOx film and achieve p-doping of NiOx after the same annealing process with 20 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI solution treatment.55,56 To explore the effect of Li-TFSI treatment on the NiOx film, Hall effect measurements were conducted to obtain the NiOx and Li-treated NiOx films' electrical properties. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the Li-treated NiOx film is more conductive than the pristine NiOx film. This result is beneficial for decreased transport resistance, which can facilitate carrier transport. In addition, an up-shifted Fermi level was calculated by conducting ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Higher CBM and VBM are observed in Fig. 1b. In particular, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the NiOx film was lifted, which enhanced the electron blocking ability and realized less recombination. In the meantime, the VBM of the NiOx film was also lifted, which made the Li-treated NiOx possess suitable VBM band offsets with both the perovskite absorber and the FTO electrode, which induced exciton dissociation at the interface of the NiOx and perovskite absorber more quickly. Therefore, larger FF and Jsc could be obtained. Fig. S4 (ESI†) demonstrates the ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) transmission spectra of FTO substrates with pristine NiOx and Li-treated NiOx films. We can see that Li-TFSI treatment nearly has no influence on the transmittance of the FTO substrate with the NiOx film, so Li-TFSI treatment hardly affects the light absorption of the perovskite absorber. As we know, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite absorber layer are quite significant factors for the performance of PSCs. And these factors can be influenced by the smoothness and roughness of the substrates. Hence, in order to figure out the surface morphology and roughness of the original NiOx and Li-treated NiOx films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to characterize these factors. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the Li-treated NiOx thin film on FTO demonstrates a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 10.3 nm, which is smaller than the RMS roughness of 11.5 nm of the pristine NiOx thin film on FTO. This result indicates that Li-TFSI treatment can decrease the RMS roughness, which is beneficial for depositing the perovskite layer. Here, we employed a fast deposition crystallization method to fabricate the perovskite absorber on the NiOx substrates according to a literature report.50 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to characterize the morphology of the perovskite films on the NiOx substrates. As shown in Fig. 2, the top view SEM images of perovskite films deposited on both the pristine NiOx and Li-treated NiOx substrates demonstrate full surface coverage, which guarantees good light absorption. Nevertheless the perovskite film deposited on the Li-treated NiOx substrate has a slightly larger grain size than that on the pristine NiOx substrate, which can reduce the grain boundary of the perovskite film. Fewer traps and defects are produced so that carrier recombination is suppressed, which is favorable for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC with Li-TFSI treatment is exhibited in Fig. 2c. The thickness of each layer has been optimized (∼250 nm for perovskite). Fig. 2d shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the perovskite on the different substrates. The sharp diffraction peaks of the perovskite at 14.1° and 28.4° are assigned to the (110) and (220) planes, which indicates the formation and crystallinity of the perovskite films. And we analyzed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks at 14.1° and 28.4° deposited on the pristine NiOx and the Li-treated NiOx substrates and obtained a FWHM of 0.10° and 0.09° at 14.1°, and 0.14° and 0.12° at 28.4°, respectively. The narrower FWHM explains the better crystallinity of the perovskite on the Li-treated NiOx substrate, which promotes the absorbance of the perovskite layer at 350–500 nm as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). This result is also in agreement with the top-view SEM images, and is mainly attributed to the smaller RMS roughness of NiOx after Li-TFSI treatment. The improved film morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film also result in preferable photovoltaic performance.

To further understand the effect of Li-TFSI treatment on the photovoltaic performance, we fabricated PSCs based on the pristine NiOx and the Li-treated NiOx HTL. Fig. 3a shows the best current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the NiOx-based devices with and without Li-TFSI treatment. It is obvious that the device based on the Li-treated NiOx HTL has better photovoltaic performance, compared to the device based on the pristine NiOx HTL. As shown in Table 1, the PSC based on the pristine NiOx HTL exhibits a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 18.43 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.75, thus resulting in a PCE of 14.46% in the reverse scanning direction. After treating the surface of the NiOx substrate with Li-TFSI, the PSC obtains a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 20.06 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.79, resulting in a PCE of 17.09% under the same conditions. A 15.4% increase of the PCE was achieved by modifying the surface of the NiOx film with Li-TFSI. In addition, the device based on the Li-treated NiOx HTL demonstrates negligible hysteresis in contrast to the device without Li-TFSI treatment. Besides, to verify the measured photovoltaic performance, we have measured the steady-state photocurrent density at the maximum power output point under continuous light soaking in Fig. 3b. The current densities of both devices remain at approximately 18.35 mA cm−2 and 19.42 mA cm−2 (see Fig. S8, ESI†), corresponding to PCEs of 13.76% and 15.92%, respectively, which are comparable to the consequences of the J–V curves. So the authenticity of the photovoltaic performance is affirmed. What's more, to examine the influence of the concentration of Li-TFSI on the performance of the device, we treated the surface of the NiOx film with different concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI solution. The J–V curves of the PSCs based on different concentrations of Li-TFSI are demonstrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†). We found that the concentration of 20 mg mL−1 is the most appropriate for the performance of the device (Table S3, ESI†). To verify the reproducibility of the inverted PSCs employing the Li-treated NiOx HTL, statistical histograms of the PCEs of 30 devices with and without Li-TFSI treatment, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3c. The average PCE for the 30 devices with Li-TFSI treatment is 15.26%, with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 18.83 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.76. In contrast, the average PCE for the 30 devices without Li-TFSI treatment is 12.25%, corresponding to a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 16.61 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.71. Obviously, Li-TFSI treatment can improve the performance of PSCs.

In order to further improve the PCE, we adopted graded heterojunction engineering to fabricate the perovskite absorber.46 Similarly, we employed an antisolvent method to prepare the perovskite film, but moderate PCBM was added into the antisolvent to form a graded heterojunction (GHJ). So a best efficiency of 18.03% was ultimately obtained, corresponding to a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 20.70 mA cm−2 and a FF of 78.8% as shown in Fig. 4a. In addition, the statistical histogram of the PCEs of 30 devices is displayed in Fig. 4b. The improvement of PCE may be due to the passivation of the perovskite grain boundary and the formation of the GHJ, which facilitates the transfer of electrons.46,57 Therefore, the PSCs based on a surface treated NiOx substrate demonstrate a promising future for commercial applications.

To illustrate the immanent cause of the performance improvement in the PSC with Li-TFSI treatment, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as shown in Fig. 3d. It is easily seen that the Li-treated NiOx-based PSC has a higher IPCE value in the range of 350–750 nm than the pristine NiOx-based PSC, which may be attributed to the better crystallinity and higher absorbance of the perovskite absorber. As a result, the integrated Jsc values of the PSCs with and without Li-TFSI treatment are 19.69 mA cm−2 and 18.35 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values of both devices. We performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) to study the carrier kinetics at the interface of the NiOx and perovskite. As we know from Fig. 5a, both NiOx-based samples show distinct PL quenching of perovskite films, demonstrating the efficient extraction of charge carriers from the perovskite layer to the NiOx layer. For a Li-treated NiOx sample, faster PL quenching is observed, which indicates that Li-TFSI treatment can accelerate the hole transport and extraction at the interface of NiOx and perovskite, thus resulting in less hysteresis and improved FF and Jsc. Furthermore, to understand the mechanism of carrier transport, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz under dark conditions. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots of the devices with and without Li-TFSI treatment at a bias of 0 V. A semicircle at the low frequency is observed for the devices, which is usually assigned to the recombination process of charge carriers. And the intercept of the curves on the real axis at high frequency corresponds to the transport resistance (Rs). By fitting the Nyquist plot with an equivalent circuit exhibited in the inset, we could qualitatively contrast the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) and Rs. The device based on the pristine NiOx displays a larger Rs value and a smaller Rrec value compared to the device based on the Li-treated NiOx. This implies that Li-TFSI treatment can decrease the Rs of the whole device which is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and increase the Rrec of the device due to the better crystallinity of the perovskite layer. Therefore, the extraction and transport process of the charge carriers is accelerated and the recombination rate of the carriers is suppressed, which results in a higher Jsc and FF so that a better photovoltaic performance is obtained.

It is known that the stability of PSCs is very significant to the future commercialization, which deserves to be solved at present. Taking the importance into account, we have also tested the long-term stability of the devices under an ambient environment (RH: below 10%, temperature: 25 °C). As shown in Fig. 6, the Li-treated NiOx-based device demonstrates better stability than the PEDOT:PSS-based device. Because of the high acidity and hydroscopicity, the PCE of the device employing PEDOT:PSS as the HTL decreases to only ∼20% of its initial PCE after 600 h stored in the ambient environment. However, the Li-treated NiOx-based device retained over 80% of its original PCE under the same conditions.

Conclusions
In summary, we employed solution-processed NiOx as a HTL to substitute PEDOT:PSS, whose optimized annealing temperature is 400 °C. In addition, the surface of the NiOx film was treated with Li-TFSI, which could improve the electrical conductivity and carrier concentration of the NiOx film and tailor its band level, resulting in enhanced hole transport and less hysteresis of the device. PL measurements and EIS results revealed the carrier transport dynamic process at the NiOx/perovskite interface and confirmed the facilitated hole transport ability of the Li-treated NiOx HTL. As a result, the PCE of PSCs was promoted from 14.46% to 18.03% via graded heterojunction engineering, which was mainly attributed to the improved Jsc and FF. Meanwhile, compared to PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, the device using the Li-treated NiOx HTL also showed better stability when stored in the ambient environment for 600 h. The latter could still retain over 80% of the initial PCE, which is due to the stable nature of the NiOx film and robust interface features. Our work has provided a facial surface treatment strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs.
