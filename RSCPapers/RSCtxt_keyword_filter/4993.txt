    , Accepted 30th August 2020First published on 1st September 2020AbstractTwo donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type polymers (PE64 and PE65) with pentacyclic dithieno[2,3-d; 2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b; 4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) as the electron-donating (D) unit and quinoxaline (Qx) as the electron-accepting (A) unit were designed to extend the application of DTBDT in non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). The impact of introducing chlorine atoms at the two-dimensional thiophene side chain of the DTBDT unit on the photovoltaic performance was investigated by blending with two distinct non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) of ITIC and Y6. We found that chlorinated polymer PE65 exhibited superior charge separation and transport due to the balanced crystallinity and miscibility when blending with acceptors. Thus, PE65 exhibited higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 13.01% (Y6 as the acceptor) and 9.13% (ITIC as the acceptor) than non-chlorinated polymer PE64 (4.69% for PE64:ITIC and 3.54% for PE64:Y6). It is noteworthy that all three parameters (open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor, abbreviated as VOC, JSC and FF) are largely improved simultaneously, which can be attributed to the adjusted energy levels, molecular crystallinity, blend film morphology and charge carrier mobility. The magnitude of differences of photovoltaic performance between PE64 and PE65 demonstrates the significance of introducing chlorine atoms at the thiophene side chain of the DTBDT unit on tuning the photoelectric and morphological properties and constructing various promising p-type photovoltaic polymers.
1 Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention due to their light weight, low cost, and potential for fabricating large-area flexible modules.1–3 Generally, BHJ type OSCs use conjugated polymers as the donors and fullerene derivatives or non-fullerene materials as the acceptors. Conjugated polymers are commonly characterized by alternating electron-donating (D) units and electron-accepting (A) units either with or without a π bridge linker. In the past few years, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing new D–π–A conjugated polymers to match with all sorts of acceptor materials.4,5 With the emergence of the unique and high-performance acceptor 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6), a library of D–π–A polymers have been designed to further improve the PCEs of OSCs.6–9 Recently, the PCE of a single-junction device has been increased to over 18% owing to engineering of the A unit of D–π–A polymers.10
Lots of conjugated A units have been exploited to construct conjugated polymers up to now, such as benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),11 benzothiadiazole (BT),12 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),13 quinoxaline (Qx),14 benzotriazole (BTA),15–17 phthalimide (PhI),18 and so on. The Qx moiety has an easy synthetic procedure and modifiable structure, and thus has been used to construct D–π–A copolymers used in both fullerene and non-fullerene devices.19,20 The D units frequently copolymerized with Qx include fluorene (F),21 carbazole (Cz),22 dibenzosilole,23 cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),24 indacenodithiophene (IDT)25 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-d]dithiophene (BDT).26 BDT, as a widely used D unit, has a planar and rigid molecular framework and high stability against oxidation and thus has received enormous attention for constructing D–π–A polymers.27–29 It has been reported that the BDT-Qx copolymers exhibited promising photovoltaic performance relative to other D-Qx combinations. For example, relatively high PCEs over 9% and 11% were reported for fluorinated-BDT-Qx based polymers with fullerene and non-fullerene as the acceptor.30,31 Introducing a chlorine atom onto the Qx moiety realized an impressive PCE of 8.16% when mixed with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).32 The relatively low performance of the reported Qx-based polymers is mainly owing to the poor molecular crystallinity and carrier mobility. Extending the planarity of the primary units is a common and effective strategy to realize strong crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility.
The five-numbered dithieno[2,3-d; 2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b; 4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) derived from the three-numbered BDT by flanking one thiophene ring features a large planar backbone.33,34Fig. 1 summarizes the PCEs of the DTBDT-based OSCs reported to date. The larger conjugated plane of DTBDT can effectively improve light-harvesting and facilitate charge transport, and thus simultaneously improve the JSC and FF of OSCs.35–37 A classic DTBDT-based copolymer, PDBT-T1, incorporating BDD as the A unit realized high PCEs of 9.7% and 10.3% when paired with PC71BM and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC), respectively.38,39 Another high-performance DTBDT-BDD copolymer, PDBT-F, afforded a high PCE of 11.02% when combined with IDIC.40 These reports displayed the huge potential of the DTBDT building block in the D–π–A copolymers in OSCs with non-fullerene acceptors.

It is well known that halogenated thienyl side chains of BDT are essential to enhance the device performance.41–46 However, the effect of chlorine substituents on the DTBDT-based polymer has not been understood. Keeping these analyses in mind, in this study we aim to investigate the photovoltaic performance of new DTBDT-Qx polymers and the influence of the chlorinated DTBDT on the final device efficiency. As shown in Scheme 1, two polymers PE64 and PE65 were designed and synthesized. Two typical NFAs, 3,9-bis (2-methylene(3-(1,1dicyanomethylene)indanone))5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl) dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) and Y6, were selected as the acceptors because Y6 and ITIC have different central cores and terminal groups. Additionally, Y6 has not been used to match with any DTBDT-based or Qx-based polymers, while ITIC has been widely used to match with either DTBDT-based or Qx-based polymers. The results showed that PE65-based OSCs exhibited higher VOCJSC, FF and PCE when mixed with Y6 and ITIC compared with PE64. The PCE over 13% of PE65:Y6 devices is the highest PCE value among the reported Qx-based polymers. The chlorine atoms on the DTBDT unit displayed comprehensive effects on the photoelectric and morphological properties of copolymers. This work demonstrates that the combination of DTBDT with Qx and chlorination of DTBDT are efficient to further enhance the absorption and improve the hole mobility of Qx-based polymers.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of monomers and polymers are depicted in Fig. S1.† Branched 2-butyloctyl side chains are used in PE65 to improve the polymer solubility. PE64 and PE65 were synthesized through the commonly used Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling polycondensation. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra are shown in Fig. S2.†PE64 and PE65 exhibit adequate solubility in common chlorinated solvents for the solution procedure. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) are determined to be 23.3 kDa/2.5 for PE64 and 24.6 kDa/2.6 for PE65 by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography. Their thermal properties are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S3a.† They all exhibit excellent thermal stability and the decomposition temperatures (Td) with 5% weight-loss for PE64 and PE65 are 405 °C and 395 °C, respectively. Fig. S3b† shows no obvious endo- and exothermal peaks in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves in the range of 35 °C–325 °C.

Fig. 2 depicts the optimized geometries and calculated surface contour plots of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO energy levels by using density functional theory (DFT) using the hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP with the split-valence 6-31g(d) basis set. Two repeating units of the polymer main chain were used for optimization. The long alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculation procedure. From the top and side views, the backbones of polymers adopted more linear conformations owing to the larger conjugated planar structure of the DTBDT unit. Along the polymer backbone, the dihedral angles between the DTBDT unit and adjacent π-bridged thiophene units are 14.3°, 15.8° and 14.1° in PE64. The PE65 backbone shows slightly larger dihedral angles of 15.4°, 14.7° and 15.1°. This slight difference may be due to the weaker electron-donating quality of the chlorinated-DTBDT due to the strong electronegativity of chlorine in PE65. Therefore, the effect of chlorination on the thienyl side chain of DTBDT on the polymer backbone is small. The torsion of the peripheral thienyl rings relative to DTBDT changes from 75.8° in PE64 to 77.8° in PE65. Although chlorination hardly has a steric impact on the backbone torsion, the chloro-substituent pointing outwards may induce intermolecular interaction through Cl⋯S or Cl⋯π.47 Like the energy level distribution of most D–A copolymers, the LUMO levels are mainly localized in the electron-accepting Qx unit, while the HOMO levels are delocalized over the whole backbone in both PE64 and PE65. The energies of the LUMO and HOMO levels were calculated to be in the decreasing order of PE64 (ELUMO = −2.56 eV, EHOMO = −4.75 eV) and PE65 (ELUMO = −2.65 eV, EHOMO = −4.88 eV). The lower HOMO energy of PE65 is likely due to the influence of the chlorine atom on the DTBDT moiety. The chlorine atoms only have a remote influence on the LUMO, which is primarily localized on the Qx moiety. The down-shifted HOMO energy level of PE65 is expected to improve the VOC of OSCs compared with PE64.

The ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PE64, PE65, ITIC and Y6 in both a chloroform solution and the thin film state are displayed in Fig. 3a and b. The relevant data are summarized in Table 1. All of the absorption spectra recorded from the dilute chloroform solutions feature three absorption bands. The first one at 340–360 nm and the second one at 450–470 nm can be assigned to the localized π–π* transitions. The third broader band from 560 to 600 nm in the long wavelength region corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units. The differences in position and intensity of the absorptions are mainly due to the effect of chlorine atoms in the polymers. The red-shifted absorption of PE64 (ca. 10–18 nm) could be ascribed to the stronger aggregation in film than in solution. In contrast, PE65 exhibited a similar absorption spectrum in the solid film to that in solution with a small absorption maximum red-shift of 0–5 nm, indicating strong intermolecular interactions existing in both the solution and film state. The changes in absorption peaks and bands indicate that the side-chain impacts the aggregation of polymers in solution and the thin film. The maximum absorption coefficients of PE64 and PE65 are estimated to be 6.13 × 104 and 6.59 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Therefore, PE65 exhibits better sunlight harvesting ability. Besides, the absorption onsets of thin films at 728 nm for PE64 and 725 nm for PE65 correspond to similar optical bandgaps Eg of 1.70 eV for PE64 and 1.71 eV for PE65. Consequently, both PE64 and PE65 exhibited broad and strong absorption in the range of 300−700 nm, which is well complementary with that of ITIC and Y6.

The electrochemical properties of polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods. Fig. 3c shows the positive and negative potential scans of both PE64 and PE65. The onset reduction and oxidation potentials (φred/φox) of PE64 and PE65 are −0.89 V/0.75 V and −0.92 V/0.87 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, according to the equation ELUMO/HOMO = −e(φred/ox + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+) (eV), where φFc/Fc+ is the redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple in the electrochemical measurement system.48 The energy level of Fc/Fc+ is 0.38 V calculated via the formula φFc/Fc+ = (Ep(anodic) + Ep(cathodic))/2.49 The ELUMO/HOMO values of PE64 and PE65 are calculated to be −3.53 eV/−5.16 eV and −3.50 eV/−5.29 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps are 1.63 eV for PE64 and 1.79 eV for PE65. Our previous reports revealed that ELUMO/HOMO of PE61 based on the BDT and Qx unit is −3.44 eV/−5.19 eV.50 Clearly, the HOMO level of PE64 is slightly higher than that of PE61 due to the stronger electron-donating effect of the DTBDT unit than of the BDT unit. The low-lying HOMO levels of the chlorinated polymer PE65 could be attributed to the fact that the empty 3d molecular orbitals of chlorine atoms can effectively accept π-electrons from the conjugated core. Although the replacement of BDT with DTBDT should have some negative influence on VOC in OSCs, the introduction of chlorine atoms on the DTBDT moiety expanded the energy band gap and increased the VOC of devices. In order to minimize the CV experimental errors, CV measurements of these acceptors are simultaneously conducted with polymer donors. The variation trend of energy levels obtained from CV experiments agrees with that obtained from DFT calculation. The schematic energy level alignment of donors and acceptors is shown in Fig. 3d.
2.2 Photovoltaic performances
The photovoltaic performances of these two polymers were evaluated by fabricating OSC devices with the conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) (∼30 nm)/polymer:acceptor/perylenediimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO) (∼10 nm)/Al (80 nm). The performance parameters JSC, VOC, FF and PCE under various conditions are summarized in Tables S1–S5.† In these different devices, the optimal D/A ratio ranges from 1:1 to 1:1.2. Different additives have been used in these four systems to obtain optimal performance, and the causes are complex. In terms of annealing temperature, the optimal annealing temperature of ITIC is 150 °C, while the annealing temperature of Y6 is 110 °C, which is mainly related to their crystallinity. The performance of PDINO is better than that of Ca, which is mainly reflected in the significant improvement of JSC. PDINO also significantly increased the FF in PE64, but decreased the FF in PE65.
The typical current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal devices are displayed in Fig. 4, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 2. The PE64:ITIC device (1:1, 150 °C, 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) shows a low PCE of 4.69% with a moderate VOC of 0.79 V, the lowest JSC of 12.43 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.47. PE65:ITIC (1:1, 150 °C, 0.5% diphenyl ether (DPE)) offers the highest VOC of 0.94 V, an FF of 0.67, a JSC of 14.40 mA cm−2, and a final high PCE of 9.13%. On the other hand, PE64:Y6 devices (1:1, 110 °C, 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN)) give a PCE of 3.54% with a VOC of 0.50 V, a JSC of 14.40 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.50. The huge energy level difference between PE64 and Y6 results in serious energy loss. The PE65:Y6 device (1:1.2, 110 °C, 0.5% DPE) exhibits the highest PCE of 13.01% with a moderate VOC of 0.77 V, the highest JSC of 25.20 mA cm−2, and an FF value of 0.67. Obviously, PE65-based devices showed larger VOC,JSC and FF than PE64 when blended with ITIC or Y6 as the acceptor. In addition, we believe the improvement will be larger if we also choose the same 2-butyloctyl side chains in PE64.51

Comparing the PE65:ITIC and PE65:Y6 systems, it is found that low JSC is the main reason that restricts the ITIC devices. In addition to the broad absorption range of Y6, the binding energy of Y6 is very low, which is conducive to exciton dissociation. The improved VOC values in PE65 devices originate from the down-shifted HOMO energy levels of PE65 relative to PE64. The larger VOC values of ITIC systems than of Y6 are attributed to the high-lying LUMO value of ITIC than of Y6. According to the definition of voltage loss Eloss = Eg − eVOC, PE64:ITIC (Eloss = 0.80 eV) and PE64:Y6 (Eloss = 0.90 eV) show larger voltage losses than PE65:ITIC (Eloss = 0.65 eV) and PE65:Y6 (Eloss = 0.63 eV) devices. Therefore, PE65 significantly decreases the voltage loss whether mixed with the ITIC acceptor or Y6 acceptor to achieve higher PCEs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the four devices prepared under the optimal conditions are plotted in Fig. 4b. It is quite clear that the EQE of the PE65 based device is higher in the whole range than that of the PE64 based device. PE65:Y6 shows the largest EQE values with a maximum EQE (EQEmax) over 80% in the broadest region of 300–950 nm. This may be the main reason for the largely enhanced JSC values in the PE65:Y6 devices. The integrated JSC values achieved from the EQE curves are 12.31, 12.11, 14.00 and 23.38 mA cm−2 for PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6, respectively. They are in good agreement with the measured J−V results within 5% mismatch.
2.3 Charge transport and recombination
The charge carrier mobilities of PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6 were measured by space-charge limited current (SCLC) characterization. The hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:acceptor/Au and the electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/isopropanol liquid (TIPD)/polymer:acceptor/Al were prepared. The typical J–V curves of hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 5. Slope 1 and 2, respectively corresponding to the Ohmic and SCLC regions, are marked. According to the equation of Mott–Gurney, the hole mobilities (μh) are calculated to be 3.1 × 10−6, 8.9 × 10−5, 8.0 × 10−6 and 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6, respectively. Their electron mobilities (μe) are 3.0 × 10−5, 2.5 × 10−4, 2.2 × 10−4 and 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μe/μh ratios are calculated to be 9.7 for PE64:ITIC, 2.8 for PE65:ITIC, 27.5 for PE64:Y6 and 0.9 for PE65:Y6. PE65:Y6 exhibits the fastest hole and electron mobilities. The balanced charge carrier mobilities in PE65:ITIC and PE65:Y6 are beneficial for suppressing space charge accumulation and thus promoting the charge extraction. These results indicate that the modification of the conjugated side chains is very effective in increasing the charge mobility for DTBDT-Qx polymers.

The charge recombination behaviors in these four devices were investigated by probing the dependence of VOC and JSC on the light intensity (Plight). The light intensity dependence of VOC data is fitted to the linear law: VOC ∝ nkBT/qlnPlight, where T, q, and kB are the temperature in Kelvin, elementary charge, and Boltzmann constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, the slopes for PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6, and PE65:Y6 devices are 1.28 kBT/q, 1.18 kBT/q, 0.94 kBT/q and 1.25 kBT/q, respectively. The n values approaching 1 indicate that the bimolecular recombination is dominant in PE65:ITIC and PE64:Y6. In the systems of PE64:ITIC and PE65:Y6, there is some trap-assisted recombination. Fig. 6b displays the dependence of JSC on the Plight in these devices. According to the equation: JSC ∝ Plightα, when the α value equals 1, the free-charge carriers can be efficiently collected at electrodes without bimolecular recombination. The same α value of 0.93 for both PE64:ITIC and PE65:ITIC devices proves the presence of bimolecular recombination, indicating that the effect of polymer side chains on the bimolecular recombination is small in the ITIC systems. The PE64:Y6 device showed the smallest α value of 0.84, which reveals that the bimolecular recombination is the most serious in this system. An α value equal to 0.96 in PE65:Y6 indicates that the bimolecular recombination is almost negligible. These analyses are consistent with the highest JSC and PCE of PE65:Y6. The significantly different recombination mechanism between PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6 reveals that the chlorination effectively reduced the biomolecular recombination and boosted the photovoltaic performance in the Y6 system. Such variation may be attributed to the different crystallinity, π–π stacking distance and miscibility of PE64 and PE65 with Y6. The influence of side-chain modification on the crystalline domains, molecular orientation and blending morphology of four devices will be discussed below.

2.4 Molecular packing and film morphology
The molecular ordering in the blend films was studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane GIWAXS profiles of these blend films are shown in Fig. 7. The in-plane (100) and out-of-plane (010) peaks, as well as the calculated lamellar (d) and π–π distances (dπ–π), are summarized in Table S6.† The coherence lengths were estimated using the equation 2πK/FWHM, where FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the (100) and (010) peaks and the Scherrer constant K is equal to 0.93. The ITIC neat film exhibits an in-plane (100) peak at qxy = 0.37 Å−1 and out-of-plane (010) peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1. The same in-plane (100) peak at qxy = 0.27 Å−1 can be observed for PE64:ITIC and PE65:ITIC. PE64:ITIC and PE65:ITIC blend films exhibit slightly different out-of-plane (010) peaks at qz = 1.70 Å−1 (dπ–π = 3.70 Å−1) and qz = 1.71 Å−1 (dπ–π = 3.70 Å−1), respectively. The out-of-plane (010) and in-plane (100) peaks of the Y6 neat film are located at qz = 1.74 Å−1 and qxy = 0.28 Å−1, respectively. PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6 blend films show (010) peaks at qz = 1.71 Å−1 (dπ–π = 3.70 Å−1) and 1.72 Å−1 (dπ–π = 3.65 Å−1) and (100) peaks at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 and 0.27 Å−1, respectively. A smaller π–π spacing of PE65:Y6 could boost the effective carrier transfer and reduce recombination.36

The scattering rings of the blend films PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC and PE64:Y6 suggest an isotropic crystalline nature. Compared with PE64:Y6, the PE65:Y6 blend film adopts a preferential face-on orientation. The strengthened π–π stacking in PE65:Y6 films can be attributed to the side chain modification in polymer PE65. Why did PE65 not exhibit obvious face-on orientation after blending with the ITIC acceptor? After comparing the diffraction peaks of neat film and blend films, it can be seen that the crystalline domains of ITIC were easily destroyed by adding polymers PE64 or PE65. However, the diffraction peaks of Y6-based blend films are similar to those of the neat Y6 film due to the strong intermolecular interaction in Y6. The (100)/(010) coherence lengths of PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6 blend films are calculated to be 81.0 Å/12.23 Å, 73.2 Å/18.21 Å, 75.0 Å/13.82 Å and 126.7 Å/31.08 Å, respectively. The larger crystalline domains are beneficial for charge transport in the PE65:Y6 system.
The morphology and phase separation of optimal BHJ films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses to understand the effect of side chains on the microstructures of active layers containing different acceptors. Fig. 8 displays the height images of these blend films. The root-mean-square (Rq) surface roughness of PE64:ITIC, PE65:ITIC, PE64:Y6 and PE65:Y6 films are estimated to be 1.80, 1.90, 3.05 and 1.78 nm, respectively. Thus, the changed side chains of polymer donors lead to a small change in the morphology of ITIC-based blend films. The lower FF and JSC of PE64:ITIC are due to severe phase separation, while PE65:ITIC has better phase separation. For the Y6 acceptor, the chlorination of the polymer side chain contributes towards forming a smoother surface, which would facilitate the charge collection at the electrode interface. Combined with the surface morphology, it is found that PDINO is more beneficial for reducing the effect of the rough surface on charge transfer.

TEM images show that PE64:ITIC and PE64:Y6 films formed larger phase separation than PE65:ITIC and PE65:Y6 blend films. The results prove again that the modification of side chains with chlorine atoms is important to realize better miscibility of polymers with acceptors. The better phase separation in PE65:ITIC and PE65:Y6 facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport and results in higher JSC and FF values than of PE64:ITIC and PE64:Y6 devices. In short, the chlorination of side chains on DTBDT can change the miscibility with acceptors. Combined with the charge transport analyses, it can be concluded that the chlorination of the polymer tends to form aggregated domains with appropriate sizes favourable for charge separation and transport.
3 Conclusions
In summary, two D–π–A type copolymers named PE64 and PE65 incorporating an electron-donating DTBDT unit and electron-accepting Qx unit were designed and prepared. PE65 shows a much deeper HOMO level of −5.29 eV in comparison with the chlorine-free polymer PE64, which leads to higher Voc. Furthermore, the chlorination of the side chain on the DTBDT unit is beneficial for forming face-on orientation and favorable phase separation, which facilitate the charge transfer and reduce recombination to significantly improve photovoltaic parameters. Notably, the OSCs based on PE65:Y6 exhibited a high PCE of 13.01% with simultaneously enhanced Jsc and FF, which is one of the highest PCE of Qx-based copolymers. This achievement is due to the combination of a large conjugated DTBDT plane. These results indicate that the chlorination of the thiophene side chain of DTBDT can not only impact the photoelectric properties of copolymers but also adjust the microstructure of active layers. The adjustment of phase separation is much more obvious when using Y6 as the acceptor.
