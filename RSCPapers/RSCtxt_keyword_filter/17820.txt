    , Accepted 29th December 2022First published on 6th January 2023AbstractTin-halide perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have aroused unprecedented attention owing to their low toxicity, high carrier mobility, and high theoretical efficiency. However, the solvents used in fabricating these devices are always toxic. Herein, we demonstrated a non-toxic solvent system of N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to dissolve the perovskite raw materials. The coordination ability with Sn2+, colloidal chemistry, crystallization process, carrier transport, and recombination dynamics were systematically studied. Our results revealed that DEF has a slightly weaker coordination ability with Sn2+, rendering the formation of smaller colloids in the precursor solution. Smoother perovskite film with a larger grain size was obtained due to the decreased nucleation sites and retarded crystal growth. Moreover, the as-fabricated TPSC device with DEF showed enhanced carrier mobility and suppressed non-radiative recombination with a lower defect density. As a result, the DEF device achieved a comparable power conversion efficiency to the device fabricated with the toxic N,N-diethylformamide (DMF) solvent. This work sheds light on green solvent selection for the large-scale fabrication of TPSCs.
Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attained rapid growth with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.7%.1–4 This superior performance is mainly attributed to their prominent features, such as long carrier diffusion length,5 fast carrier mobility,6,7 tunable band gap,8–10 solution processbility.11,12 However, considering their prospects for commercialization, there are still some issues to deal with. One of the most significant concerns is that the high-efficiency PSCs use toxic lead. Great efforts have been devoted to prevent lead leakage and develop lead-free alternatives.13,14 Among the analogs of lead, including tin,15 bismuth,16 germanium,17 antimony,18 and copper,19 tin-halide perovskites are the most promising candidates. To date, the PCE of tin-halide PSCs (TPSCs) has been pushed to a record of 14.81%.20 Nevertheless, toxicity issues are still present in the fabrication process.21–24
Solution processing is a universally adopted technique for the deposition of halide perovskite thin films, including but not limited to spin coating,25,26 spraying,27,28 and blade coating.29,30 However, most of the precursor solvents used to dissolve the precursor raw materials are toxic, to some degree. As shown in Tables S1 and S2,† we list the acute toxicity and score the safety, health, and environmental hazards of some commonly used solvents.31 Obviously, N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are marked as non-toxic solvents. On the contrary, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is known to be harmful to the liver, while 1,3-dimethyl-tetrahydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one (DMPU) has an impact on spleen health, and both DMF and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) are bad for reproduction.32 Therefore, in spite of the rapid progress in the photovoltaic industry, low-toxic or non-toxic precursor solvents are still urgently needed for the fabrication of TPSCs. In addition, the unit prices of DMF, DEF and DMSO were also compared in Table S3.† Recently, Abate et al. prepared TPSCs with a PCE of 6.2% by using DEF and DMPU as solvents.33 However, the highly toxic DMPU was still present and the function of DEF has not been carefully investigated. Wang et al. used DEF to prepare MAPbI3, while the obtained perovskite film was discontinuous due to the formation of adducts in the precursor solution, and the corresponding device achieved a PCE of only 5.7%.34 Therefore, as a promising green solvent, DEF has clearly not yet received the attention it deserves.
Herein, we demonstrate a binary solvent system of DEF and DMSO for the fabrication of TPSCs. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption, 13C NMR along with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed to characterize the coordinating ability of DEF with SnI2. Changes in the type of SnI2-solvent complexes confirmed the weakened coordination between DEF and Sn2+via a carbonyl group. From the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results, it could be seen that DEF tended to form smaller and more uniform colloidal particles in the precursor solution. The declined crystal nucleation site and slower growth rate led to the enlarged grain size of the tin-halide perovskite film. As a result, a smooth film morphology with a lower surface roughness was obtained with DEF. The excellent carrier transport and suppressed charge recombination helped the DEF device to achieve a comparable photovoltaic performance compared to the device using toxic DMF solvent.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the electrostatic potential (ESP) of DMF and DEF molecules. In terms of the molecular structure, both of them could coordinate with Sn2+via a carbonyl group, to form the SnI2-solvent complex in the precursor solution. As displayed in the electrostatic potential image, compared with DMF, the negative charge density around the carbonyl group in DEF was reduced, which might undermine its coordination ability with Sn2+. In addition, the larger and longer alkyl chains in DEF can increase the steric hindrance, to impede the interaction between the solvent and solute.35 Therefore, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were performed to characterize the coordination ability of DMF and DEF to SnI2. First, SnI2 was dissolved in pure DMF and DEF, respectively (Fig. S1†). The stretching vibration peak of CO in DMF and DEF was downshifted from 1672 cm−1 and 1670 cm−1 to 1668 cm−1 (−4 cm−1) and 1668 cm−1 (−2 cm−1), separately. Meanwhile, we found a stronger peak broadening in DEF. The fewer wavenumber shifts and larger peak broadening indicated a weaker coordination of DEF with SnI2.36,37 Similarly, FTIR spectroscopy was also performed on the perovskite solution dissolved in pure DMF and DEF (Fig. S2†), respectively. The characteristic peak of CO was downshifted 3 cm−1 in DEF, while it was downshifted 6 cm−1 in DMF. The smaller wavenumber shifts of CO in DEF was consistent with the results obtained using the SnI2 solution. Then, 13C NMR was conducted to further investigate the interaction between the solvent and SnI2. In Fig. 1b and Fig. S3,† the NMR peak of CO in DMF was located at 162.2 ppm. After introducing SnI2, the characteristic peak exhibited a 0.3 ppm chemical shifts, indicating the coordination between DMF and SnI2. As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S4,† the SnI2 solution in DEF showed a 0.1 ppm shifts from 161.9 ppm to 162.0 ppm, compared with pure DEF. The increased chemical shifts demonstrated a slightly stronger coordination ability of DMF with SnI2 than DEF.

In addition, UV–vis absorption spectra are capable of characterizing the interaction between the solvent and solute. As shown in Fig. 1d, SnI2 was dissolved in DMF/DMSO and DEF/DMSO solvent systems, respectively. The distinct absorption peak at 265 nm corresponded to the [SnI2(solvent)4] complex.38,39 Obviously, in the solvent system with DEF, there was a shoulder peak around 320 nm, and the absorption tail was extended to about 400 nm. This type of absorption spectrum could be assigned to the presence of [SnI3(solvent)3]−. The strong coordination ability of the solvent generally results in the generation of more plumbate ions with higher solvent coordination numbers.40 Thus, the results of the UV–vis spectra further confirmed the weak coordination effect of DEF. Recently, Abate et al.33 reported a similar lower binding energy of DEF with Sn2+ compared with DMF, using density functional theory (DFT) simulation. To better demonstrate the weak coordination effect, we conducted gradient tests of the UV–vis absorption spectra of SnI2 solution with different DMF and DEF volume ratios. As shown in Fig. S5,† with the increasing volume proportion of DMF, no new absorption peaks appeared. However, with the increasing volume of DEF, absorption peaks of high iodide complexes, like [SnI3(solvent)3]− and [SnI4(solvent)2]2−, started to appear in the solution. Overall, the coordination ability with SnI2 of the above three solvents was DMSO > DMF > DEF.
Further, dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization was performed to analyze the precursor colloid size in solution. As shown in Fig. 1e, with the increasing coordination between the solvent and SnI2, the colloid particle size was gradually enlarged. The increase in the high iodide coordination complex tends to reduce the colloid size.41 Similarly, the perovskite precursor solution with DEF exhibited smaller but more uniformly distributed sizes (Fig. 1f). In order to clarify the effect of DEF on the perovskite films, the X-ray diffraction patterns were investigated (Fig. 2a). The peaks at 14.3°, 28.6°, and 43.4° corresponded to the (100), (200), and (300) crystal plane, respectively. The similar crystalline orientation and intensity of the DMF and DEF films indicated that the precursor solvent with DEF could induce good crystallization. It has been reported that even for the same composition, changes of the precursor solvent could tune the bandgap of the films, to some degree.42 Therefore, we conducted diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S6,† the perovskite film prepared with DEF demonstrated a negligible bandgap change (6 meV) compared with the DMF film, which excludes the influence of the bandgap in the following analysis.

Subsequently, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2b and c) results displayed a surface roughness of 32.9 nm for the DMF film, and 18.3 nm for the DEF film, respectively. The perovskite film prepared with non-toxic solvent exhibited a smoother morphology as well as larger grain size. During the spin-coating process, the smaller colloid particles in the DEF/DMSO precursor solution made it more difficult to reach supersaturation after dropping the anti-solvent.43 Therefore, a lower density of nucleation sites was obtained in the film fabricated with DEF. In the subsequent annealing process, a higher boiling point of DEF further retarded the crystal growth (Table S4†). Eventually, the DEF film showed a lower roughness and increased grain size.
In Fig. 2d–f and Fig. S7,† the carrier-transport properties were investigated by photo-CELIV measurement with an electron-only structure of ITO/SnO2/FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25/C60-ETPA44/BCP/Ag. The electron mobility was calculated by the following equation: (1)where A, tmax, Δj, d, and j0 correspond to the extraction speed, the time of the maximum extraction current, the maximum extraction peak, the film thickness, and the displacement current. As a result, the DEF film obtained a much higher mobility under different light intensities. Reducing the roughness of the film surface could optimize the contact between the absorption layer and charge-transport layer, thus facilitating the carrier mobility.45,46 Subsequently, we adopted the space charge limited current (SCLC) (Fig. 2g) method to evaluate the trap density in the perovskite films with the following equation: (2)where ε, ε0, and L belong to the relative dielectric constant, permittivity of vacuum, and the film thickness (∼200 nm). VTFL could be obtained from the SCLC plot so that the trap density was calculated quantitatively. The DMF film showed a trap density of 2.48 × 1015 cm−3. The decreased trap density in the DEF film (1.87 × 1015 cm−3) was attributed to the increased grain size and smoother film morphology, which inhibited the non-radiative recombination at the grain boundaries and interface.47 In addition, as shown in Fig. 2h, the perovskite film with DEF demonstrated an enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity. Moreover, the average carrier lifetime was extended from 10.3 ns to 13.8 ns (Fig. 2i and Table S5†).
Given the enhanced carrier mobility and suppressed recombination, inverted TPSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25/C60-ETPA/BCP/Ag were fabricated to study the photovoltaic performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the related parameters were displayed in Fig. 3a and Table S6.† Under forward scanning, the DEF device exhibited a PCE of 10.08% (9.88% ± 0.29%), which was slightly higher than the 9.61% (9.17% ± 0.28%) PCE of the DMF device. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the DEF device reached 805 mV, 45 mV higher than the DMF device (760 mV). Fig. 3b and Table S7† show the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The DMF device demonstrated an integrated current density (Jint) of 18.7 mA cm−2. The DEF device obtained a Jint of 18.1 mA cm−2. Simultaneously, the steady-state power output and the stabilized current density (Fig. 3c) were measured under bias voltages of 612 mV (DMF) and 636 mV (DEF), separately. The stable output PCE of the DEF device manifested the promise of the non-toxic solvent system for preparing reliable TPSCs. In addition, 15 independent devices were manufactured and the distribution of the statistics are summarized in Fig. 3d and e and Fig. S8.† The good reproducibility of the devices reflects the suitability of the DEF/DMSO solvent system for the reliable fabrication of TPSCs.

Transient photovoltage decay (TPV) was identified to investigate the charge-recombination behaviors (Fig. 3f). The TPV lifetime was prolonged from 5.97 μs (DMF) to 9.53 μs (DEF). The slower TPV decay of the DEF device could be ascribed to the decreased defects and suppressed non-radiative recombination. Meanwhile, transient photocurrent decay (TPC) was performed to compare the charge-transport ability (Fig. 3g). The DEF device exhibited a photocurrent decay time of 0.66 μs while the decay time for DMF device was 0.83 μs. The faster TPC decay was attributed to the better charge extraction and transport in the device prepared with DEF. Furthermore, Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. 3h) were conducted and the built-in potential (Vbi) was acquired from the following equation: (3)where A, V, and C refer to the effective area of devices, the applied potential, and the capacitance. Here, Vbi was increased from 580 mV for the DMF device to 630 mV for the DEF device, which was consistent with the elevated Voc. The boosted Vbi implied a stronger driving force in the DEF device for charge separation.43Fig. 3i depicted the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. The DEF device showed a higher charge-recombination resistance (Rrec) value of 13.7 kΩ compared to the DMF device of 11.7 kΩ. The promoted Rrec implied a restricted recombination, which further validated the enhancement of Voc.
In addition, the perovskite film with DEF had a larger water contact angle than the DMF film (Fig. 4a). The reduction of the grain boundaries could not only reduce the recombination, but also effectively inhibit the invasion of water molecules, leading to the larger water contact angle of the DEF perovskite film.48 The enhanced hydrophobicity of the DEF perovskite film was attributed to a better stability.49 Finally, the stability of the devices was recorded under N2 atmosphere for 1000 h (Fig. 4b). The DEF devices maintained 92.4% of the original PCE, while the DMF devices retained 85.3% of the initial PCE. The improved stability for the DEF device could be originated from the enhanced perovskite film quality.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a binary non-toxic solvent system with DEF and DMSO by replacing toxic DMF with the green solvent DEF. With the DLS, UV–vis, 13C NMR and FTIR measurements, DEF had a slightly weaker coordination ability with SnI2 compared with DMF, thus rendering the formation of smaller colloid sizes in the precursor solution. The reduced nucleation sites and slow crystal growth led to a denser and smoother perovskite film with a larger grain size. The decreased surface roughness of the DEF perovskite film facilitated the charge transfer and inhibited carrier recombination at the interface between the perovskite absorption layer and electron-transport materials. The increased open-voltage value was ascribed to the suppressed grain boundary non-radiative recombination. After optimizing the volume ratio of DEF and DMSO, we achieved a PCE of 10.08%, slightly higher than the device prepared with the toxic solvent DMF. Meanwhile, the DEF device could maintain 92.4% of its original PCE after 1000 h storage under a N2 atmosphere. Therefore, our work sheds light on minimizing the environmental and health hazards associated with the fabrication of TPSCs, without sacrificing the device's photovoltaic performance.
