    , Accepted 15th October 2018First published on 15th October 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for power sources to sustainably drive next-generation wearable electronics, following the advances in PSCs and future desires of harvesting and storing energy integration. However, the natural brittle property of crystals for elastic deformation restricts the mechanical robustness, which definitely results in degraded efficiency. In fact, the crystalline quality and “cask effect” impact large-area reproducibility of PSCs. Inspired by the highly crystalline and tough nacre, herein, we report biomimetic crystallization to grow high-quality perovskite films with an elastic “brick-and-mortar” structure. The antithetic solubility of the composite matrix facilitates perpendicular micro-parallel crystallization and affords stretchability to resolve the “cask effect” of flexible PSCs. We successfully fabricate PSC chips (1 cm2 area) with average efficiencies of 19.59% and 15.01% on glass and stretchable substrates, respectively. Importantly, a recorded 56.02 cm2 area wearable solar-power source with 7.91% certified conversion efficiency is achieved. This skin fitting power source shows bendability, stretchability and twistability and is practically assembled in wearable electronics.

Broader context
Advancements in wearable electronics and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have triggered tremendous potentials for flexible solar power sources. However, the natural brittle property of perovskite films hinders wearable PSCs. Our new findings report a major breakthrough in flexible PSCs to overcome this issue. We introduce “brick-and-mortar” microstructures for wearable PSCs via biomimetic crystallization, which simultaneously possess advanced photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. The rigid and wearable PSC chips with average PCE values of up to 19.59% and 15.01% are successfully fabricated. More importantly, a bendable and stretchable wearable power source is achieved while maintaining high efficiency of 7.91% in a recorded large-area PSC module. The PSC module can easily charge commercial wearable devices in a variety of body movements. This rigid-flexible combination strategy opens up a new approach for perovskite materials in wearable and flexible electronics.

Introduction
Wearable electronics provide convenience, portability and functional integration for modern electronic devices and industries, promoting daily life of humans rapidly and profoundly.1,2 As the core component of electronic devices, the power source for harvesting and storing energy primarily affects the future development and application.3,4 Solar irradiance, a clean, convenient and sustainable energy, can be perfectly integrated with wearable electronics, especially outdoors, where solar energy is plentiful.4,5 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become promising candidates due to their low weights, low-cost properties and remarkable photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE).6–11 Recently, great efforts in interfacial nano-structure modification12–15 and optimization of flexible substrates5,16–18 have been reported to improve the performance of flexible PSCs. However, the natural brittle property of perovskite (PVK) films hinders wearable PSCs. It is difficult to achieve the requirements of bendability, stretchability and twistability for adapting complex body movements.19–21 Besides, the “cask effect” of flexible devices further limits realization of large-scale PCE and good reproducibility.22,23
In nature, benefitting from two types of organic matrixes, i.e., insoluble and soluble, the nacre shows prominent crystallinity and toughness.24 The matrixes promote biomineralization and result in construction of a tough “brick-and-mortar” microstructure. Concerning the mechanism, the insoluble matrix acts as a scaffold, whereas the soluble matrix controls and facilitates the crystal-orientated growth. Some nacre-like structures have been applied in flexible devices.25,26 Inspired by the nacre, herein, we demonstrate a biomimetic crystallization approach via introducing an antithetic soluble composite matrix to achieve wearable PSCs, which simultaneously possess advanced PCE and mechanical robustness (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the insoluble poly(styrene-co-butadiene) (SBS) scaffold reduces the number of nucleation sites and promotes heterogeneous nucleation because of the lower nucleation free energy barrier.27,28 Meanwhile, the interaction between soluble polyurethane (PU) and PbX2 (X = I and Br) can suppress the crystallization speed of high-quality PVK in flexible PSCs (please see solubility in Fig. S1, ESI†).29 Similar to nacre biomineralization, this synergistic effect of the matrix greatly improves crystallization and mechanical performance of PVK devices. With this strategy, rigid and wearable PSC chips with average PCE values of up to 19.59% and 15.01% are successfully fabricated. More significantly, a 56.02 cm2 area wearable solar-power source (7.91% PCE) exhibits essential reproducibility and mechanical flexibility due to the wearable structure design and filling of elastomer matrix into the grain boundary. The PSC module can easily charge commercial wearable devices (for example, here, a smartwatch is used) in a variety of body movements (Fig. 1c and Movie S1, ESI†).

Results and discussion
Mechanism and quality of biomimetic crystallization
The optimized concentration of the polymer matrix is investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (please see details in Fig. S2, ESI†). The concentrations of SBS and PU are 0.04 wt% and 0.6 mg ml−1 in the following discussion. The morphology of various PVK films is observed using SEM (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S3, ESI†) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. S4, ESI†), and the corresponding grain-size distribution is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The PVK films without any matrix (defined as reference) show a rough surface with an average grain size of 360 nm. The difference in crystallinity of PVK films on rigid or flexible substrates results in clear disparity of PSC performance.30 After the incorporation of the polymer matrix, smooth PVK films and enhanced crystallization are detected. The reduced roughness can be verified because SBS exists on the film surface. Remarkably, the PVK films grown based on SBS–PU biomimetic matrix afford large crystals with dimension larger than 700 nm. It has been proven that the perovskite films tend to break more at the grain boundaries than crystals.19,29 Therefore, the SBS–PU perovskite films achieve better mechanical stability with decreased area of the grain boundaries. From the sectional views, SBS promotes the PVK films to grow in an oriented direction. The SBS–PU-based PVK films grow as a perpendicular micro-parallel structure, enhancing the ability to overcome the “cask effect” for device performance. To verify the morphology, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are obtained (Fig. 2c). The samples based on polymer matrix show high crystallinity with stronger and sharper PVK characteristic peaks, especially the (111) plane of trigonal phase. The 2D-XRD images are further illustrated in Fig. 2d and Fig. S6 (ESI†). Compared with the reference sample, the SBS–PU-based PVK films show two brighter spots at 14.0° and 29.1°, which correspond to (111) and (222) planes. The shorter ring shape of the (111) plane and greater brightness difference between (111) plane and (123) plane also confirm vertical crystal orientation.25,31,32

(f) Time-resolved photoluminescence of PVK films. 
To further explore the mechanism of uniaxial-orientation, we investigate the crystallization rate using a high-speed camera (Fig. S7 and Movie S2, ESI†). The result clearly indicates that both polymer matrixes can retard crystal growth in spite of different mechanisms. For the SBS-based PVK film, insoluble SBS can act as a scaffold and reduce nucleation free-energy barrier, inducing heterogeneous nucleation.27,33 For the PU-based PVK film, there is chemical interaction to suppress the crystallization rate, as reported previously.29 To prove the mechanism, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†). Compared with the results of pure PU, the stretching vibration of CO bond (at ∼1710 cm−1) for PVK films with PU shifts to a lower wavenumber, which indicates interaction between PU with PbX2. Moreover, this interaction reduces the content of metallic lead in high-quality PVK films (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in Fig. S8b, ESI†).34 Thus, the synergistic effect of SBS and PU can retard crystallization and facilitate oriented growth.
Subsequently, a distinct increase in optical absorption is observed (Fig. 2e). In Fig. S9 (ESI†), the carriers’ generation rate is simulated, and the value of SBS–PU-based devices is nearly twice that of the reference devices. The presence of matrix significantly benefits the utilization rate of incident light in PVK layers. Besides, photoluminescence spectra are used to analyze the excitation and recombination of carriers. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows a clear degree of improvement when PVK films are incorporated with the SBS–PU matrix. Additionally, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves are fitted to a bi-exponential rate law (Fig. 2f).35 The reference films demonstrate fast- and slow-phase lifetimes of τ1 = 2.1 ns and τ2 = 16.6 ns, respectively. In contrast, the samples based on SBS–PU exhibit slower decays of τ1 = 8.1 ns and τ2 = 178.7 ns, respectively, which indicate lower intensity of traps. The carriers’ trap density and the carrier mobility of various PVK films are measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method36,37 (please see details in Fig. S11a and b, ESI†). The carriers’ trap density of SBS–PU-based devices is calculated to be ∼1.7 × 1015 cm−3, which is much lower than that of the reference devices (∼7.1 × 1015 cm−3). The mobility also increases from 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 (reference) to 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 S−1 (SBS–PU). The lower dark current density of the devices can circuitously prove the presence of less defects and recombination centres in the PVK films with SBS–PU (Fig. S11c, ESI†). The current-sensing AFM results in Fig. S12 (ESI†) are in accordance with the results of SCLC analyses. The device based on SBS–PU-PVK (1.12 nA) films reveals more average light-generated current than reference devices (0.07 nA).38 Hence, the abovementioned results indicate that biomimetic crystallization can provide high-quality PVK films and offer great potential to achieve advanced performance of flexible optoelectronics.
PCE of PSC chip and power source
To validate biomimetic crystallization, we first fabricate PSCs on a conventional rigid substrate, and the device structure is Glass/ITO/NiO/PVK/PC61BM/BCP/Ag. For J (current density)–V (voltage) and I (current)–V curves, all devices are measured under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation, 100 mW cm−2, and the effective area is defined by a certified aperture. We achieve remarkable PCE of 20.25% (backward scan) with a small hysteresis (18.75%, forward scan) based on the SBS–PU matrix, as shown in Fig. 3a. PSCs show clear enhancement of average PCE from 17.89% (reference) to 19.59% (SBS–PU, please see details in Fig. S13, ESI†). Furthermore, wearable PSCs (35 mm × 35 mm) with the configuration of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PVK/polyethylenimine (PEI)/PEDOT:PSS/PDMS are prepared, as shown Fig. 1b and Fig. S14 (ESI†). As for this structure, the top passivation PDMS can shift the mechanical neutral plane from substrate to PVK layer and present a semi-transparent structure for diversified applications (Fig. S15, ESI†).22,39,40 The highly conductive and smooth PEDOT:PSS electrode is a significant factor for achieving high PCE over large area. Expectedly, an improvement of average PCE from 7.98% (reference) to 15.01% (SBS–PU) with 1.01 cm2 area is obtained, as shown in Fig. 3b and Table S1 (ESI†). The SBS–PU-based PSCs demonstrate the best PCE of 15.61% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.70 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.78; also, Jsc is in good agreement with the corresponding integrated value from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. S16, ESI†). Moreover, there is negligible hysteresis between forward (15.52%) and backward (15.61%) scanning directions for SBS–PU-based PSCs (Fig. 3c). The non-hysteresis performance can be ascribed to the same PEDOT:PSS electrodes.

(e) I–V curves of a wearable solar-power source with SBS–PU. The inset shows the corresponding photograph. (f) Steady-state PCE and current of a wearable solar-power source with SBS–PU at the voltage near the maximum power point. 
Reproducibility is a crucial factor for flexible PSCs and possibility of future practical applications.7,23,41–43 We fabricate more than fifty samples (one hundred samples for SBS–PU) for each device from different batches to explore reproducibility. The specific parameters are listed and summarized in Table S2 and Fig. S17 (ESI†), and the corresponding device performance distributions are illustrated in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The devices based on SBS–PU show favorable reliability with narrower PCE distribution; more than 80% of PCEs are portioned between 14.5% and 15.5%. The satisfactory performance and reproducibility can be ascribed to high-quality PVK films with a micro-parallel structure. As the effective area increases, PCE is inevitably reduced, which is mainly due to more defects and recombination centers in PVK films, specifically the “cask effect” in flexible devices.22,41 Thus, PCE of reference and SBS–PU-based PSCs with different aperture areas is investigated in Fig. 3d. Compared with reference devices, which exhibit an apparent loss of PCE, PSCs with the SBS–PU matrix show a large-area generalization performance with PCE of 12.86% based on 9.33 cm2 area; this can be due to better interfacial contact with smoother PVK films (Fig. S4, ESI†), which indeed provides feasibility for a wearable module.
Therefore, we fabricate a wearable PSC power source from six single chips based on SBS–PU devices, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3e. The photovoltaic metrics of the PSC module are provided in Fig. 3e. Under standard solar irradiation, the wearable PSC module exhibits PCE of 7.95% based on an area of 56 cm2, which can output 445.1 mW maximum power at 1.60 V bias voltage. Consequently, the wearable PSC module is certified by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) of China. A PCE value of 7.91% with 56.02 cm2 effective area is tested (Fig. S19, ESI†). Steady-state PCE and current of the wearable PSC module are monitored (Fig. 3f). The module shows stabilized performance under solar irradiation, enabling a great prospect in the field of wearable power sources. Several representative performances of flexible PSCs are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). We fabricate a record wearable PSC module with the highest certified PCE value. More encouragingly, the module with a sufficient area indicates excellent reproducibility and applicability for a wearable power source.
Mechanical stability of wearable PSC power source
The mechanical stabilities of bending, stretching and twisting are the basic specifications for practical wearable PSCs.17,39 Since twisting can be regarded as a combination of bending and stretching movements, the bending and stretching stabilities are analyzed, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the normalized average PCE of PSCs is varied after bending 100 cycles within a curvature radius from 5 to 2 mm. The SBS–PU-based PSCs demonstrate an excellent bending tolerance, even maintaining 97% of pristine value in a narrow 2 mm curvature. On the contrary, the reference devices suffer a clear decrease to 68% of the original PCE. Afterwards, continuous 5000 cycles of bending tests are performed with different radii of curvature, as shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. S20a–c (ESI†); the insets show the photographs taken during the bending test. The PCE of reference devices exhibits a decrease over 300 bending cycles because of the fragile PVK crystals.19,21,29 After filling the elastic matrix into the grain boundary, PSCs generally maintain 80% original value after 5000 cycles. Notably, the SBS–PU-based PSCs show no clear decrease even at a curvature radius of 2 mm.

(b) Normalized average PCE of PSCs as a function of bending cycles with a radius of 2 mm. (c) J–V curves of the champion PSCs measured under 0%, 10% and 20% stretching, respectively. (d) Normalized average PCE of PSCs as a function of stretching cycles with 10% and 20% stretching. Finite-element simulation (e and g) and the corresponding mises stress of cut line (f and h) under bending test and 10% stretching, respectively. 
The rigid-flexible combination can afford stretchability for fragile functional devices in wearable electronics.44,45 Furthermore, the stretchable performance of elastic SBS–PU matrix in PVK films is investigated. In Fig. 4c, the J–V curves of PSCs with SBS–PU under stretchable condition are exhibited. The devices still show PCE values of 13.1% and 11.2% under 10% and 20% stretching, respectively. In addition, the tensile durability of 10% and 20% stretching is also detected (Fig. 4d). As expected, PCE of reference devices is slumped. However, SBS–PU PSCs retain 86% and 73% of original PCE after 10% and 20% stretching tests, respectively, for 5000 cycles. Moreover, flexible PSCs are subjected to crumpling tests for 5000 cycles, and the corresponding normalized PCE is shown in Fig. S20d (ESI†). PSCs with SBS–PU exhibit excellent twistability for wearable applications. Hence, PSCs via biomimetic crystallization show great feasibility in mechanical stability.
To explore the improvement of mechanical stability, the Young's modulus of various PVK films is measured via limit deflection curves (Fig. S21, ESI†).46 The Young's modulus of SBS–PU-based PVK films decreases from 260 MPa (reference device) to 193 MPa, indicating that less stress is experienced under deformation. Based on Young's modulus and other mechanical parameters, as shown in Table S4 (ESI†), the finite-element method is used to model (Fig. S22, ESI†) and simulate bending or stretching tests, respectively. As presented in Fig. 4e and f, the SBS–PU-based PVK films can effectively release the bending stress, and the corresponding Von Mises stress of the cut line is reduced over the whole PVK functional layer. More noticeable results are observed in Fig. 4g and h. The PVK films with SBS–PU matrix load less mises stress under 10% stretching state. The morphological statistics of mechanical stability also confirm the experimental change in PCE and finite-element simulation (Fig. S23, ESI†). A single matrix can prevent the PVK films is revealed. Additionally, the cracked, broken and exfoliated morphology of SBS–PU-based PVK films changes significantly during the bending, stretching and crumpling test. These results are related to the perpendicular micro-parallel structure. Every individual crystal cannot impact and destruct others due to this rigid-flexible combination.
Conclusions
Inspired by the crystal growth mechanism and microarchitecture of the nacre, we introduce a “brick-and-mortar” microstructure for wearable PSCs via biomimetic crystallization. An antithetic soluble SBS–PU composite matrix is proposed to facilitate crystal-orientated growth, which affords flexibility to the PVK films. Accordingly, a bendable and stretchable wearable power source is achieved while maintaining high efficiency in a recorded large-area PSC module. This rigid-flexible combination approach opens up a new strategy for perovskite materials in flexible and wearable electronics.
Experimental
Fabrication of substrates and electrodes
For the wearable devices, pre-stretched PDMS (sylgard 184, 110 μm) was selected as the substrate, and it was attached on a pre-cleaned glass for the following process. To fabricate transparent electrodes for wearable PSCs, a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus CLEVIOSTM PH1000) aqueous solution with 5 wt% glycol and 0.5 wt% Zonyl FS-300 (Dupont) was spun onto the PDMS substrates at 1000 rpm for 30 s, followed by 1500 rpm for 10 s, and subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The conductivity was over 4000 S cm−1, which is comparable to that of PET/ITO. The sheet resistance of final PEDOT:PSS electrode was about 40 Ω □−1.17,47 To match the energy level of device, a hole-transport layer (HTL) PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus CLEVIOSTM Al4083) was then spin-coated onto PH1000 anode at 5000 rpm for 1 min, which was heated at 100 °C for 15 min. As for cathode, the PEI (Aldrich, 0.1 wt% diluted by isopropanol) layer was spin-coated on top at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then dried in air for 10 min. The 3 M copper tape was used to adhere to the electrode using silver glue.
Fabrication of PSC chip
The PVK films were prepared via a single-step process from a solution containing 549 mg PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 46 mg PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 150 mg HC(NH2)2I (Xi’an p-OLED Corp.), 40 mg CH3NH3I (Xi’an p-OLED Corp.) and an appropriate concentration of PU (Sigma-Aldrich) in 800 μl anhydrous DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 μl anhydrous DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) mixture solvent. The spin-coating was started at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 seconds. A trace of SBS (Aladdin) anhydrous chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was drop-casted quickly within 7 seconds after reaching high speed. Then, the perovskite films were heated at 100 °C on a hotplate for 30 min. After that, ∼60 nm-thick [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, ADS) was spin-coated from a anhydrous chlorobenzene solution (20 mg ml−1) at 2000 rpm for 40 s. After drying, the top PEI/PEDOT:PSS/PDMS electrode was deposited via a film-transfer lamination technique:48 the bottom device was first exposed to air-plasma for about 2 s (flash). Then, PEI/PEDOT:PSS/PDMS electrode was transferred onto the PC61BM film and encapsulated using a vacuum-laminator. The top PDMS layer provided passivation for device encapsulation. It showed excellent long-term stability with different humidities and thermal conditions (Fig. S24, for more details, please see the ESI†).
Fabrication of wearable module
Three single chips (9.33 cm2) were fabricated in a parallel circuit to create a unit. Two units were fabricated in series to complete the wearable solar cell module (certified 56.02 cm2). All circuits were fabricated using a gold-wire bonding machine. The wearable experiments were tested under LED light irradiation (∼20 klx solar irradiance).
Characterizations of solar cells
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were characterized using a Keithley 2400 instrument. The currents were measured under a solar simulator (Enli Tech, 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G irradiation). The reference silicon solar cell was corrected from NREL. All the measurements were performed in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The scan range is from 0 V to 1.2 V or from 1.2 V to 0 V and 8.0 mV for each step. The delay time is 30 ms, and the scan rate is 267 mV s−1. All the J–V curves were based on 150 points. All the active areas were corrected by calibrated masks (1.01, 2.24, 3.99, 6.23 and 9.33 cm2). The repeated bending and stretching cycles were performed using a custom-made stretching machine, which was actuated by a stepper motor. All the results of bending tests were averaged from over 20 samples. The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency spectra (IPCE) were detected under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and calibration of the incident light was performed using a monocrystalline silicon diode.
Characterizations
The morphology of films was measured by SEM (JEOL, JSM-7500F, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV and AFM (nanoscope multimode Bruker). The CSAFM images and limit deflection curves were investigated using specific probes. XRD and 2D-XRD images were recorded using a D8-Discover 25 diffractometer (Bruker). Absorbance spectra measurement was analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy (SHIMADZU, UV-2600). FTIR spectra were recorded using an infrared spectrometer (Bruker TENSOR-27). XPS studies were performed using a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromated Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All recorded peaks were corrected for electrostatic effects by setting the C−C component of the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV. The base pressure in the XPS analysis chamber was 2 × 10−9 mbar. Steady-state photoluminescence and TRPL measurements at the peak emission of ∼770 nm (on the excitation at 470 nm) were carried out using a steady state and lifetime spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd). All the PL samples were fabricated on PDMS/PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The thickness of all the samples was detected using a surface profiler (Bruker).

Broader context
Advancements in wearable electronics and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have triggered tremendous potentials for flexible solar power sources. However, the natural brittle property of perovskite films hinders wearable PSCs. Our new findings report a major breakthrough in flexible PSCs to overcome this issue. We introduce “brick-and-mortar” microstructures for wearable PSCs via biomimetic crystallization, which simultaneously possess advanced photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. The rigid and wearable PSC chips with average PCE values of up to 19.59% and 15.01% are successfully fabricated. More importantly, a bendable and stretchable wearable power source is achieved while maintaining high efficiency of 7.91% in a recorded large-area PSC module. The PSC module can easily charge commercial wearable devices in a variety of body movements. This rigid-flexible combination strategy opens up a new approach for perovskite materials in wearable and flexible electronics.
