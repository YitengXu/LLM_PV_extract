    , Accepted 23rd March 2020First published on 24th March 2020AbstractIt is challenging to afford efficient and stable organic solar cells based on an as-cast active layer without any external treatments. We present a planar organic electron acceptor, BPTCN, with high electron mobility as a third component in nonfullerene ternary polymer solar cells, which comprises an electron-deficient 4,7-bis(5H-4,6-dioxothieno[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole core, doubly endcapped by 2-(3-ethyl-5-methylene-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile through the alkylated thiophene-2,5-ylene unit. It shows a π–π stacking distance of 3.60 Å and μe of 1.31 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. BPTCN exhibits an absorption maximum at 569 nm in the as-cast film and good miscibility with the NIR-absorption acceptor COi8DFIC, leading to complete förster energy transfer in the blends. Adding BPTCN into the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend produces multiple beneficial effects: (i) facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface while suppressing bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, as revealed by analysis of the Jph–Veff, Jsc–Ilight and Voc–Ilight characteristics, (ii) increasing hole and in particular electron transport; and (iii) generally promoting the crystallinity of the polymer donor PTB7-Th, as revealed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction results. Moreover, the phase purity is greatly improved in the ternary blend PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:BPTCN (1:1.05:0.45 by weight). Consequently, the tentatively optimized ternary solar cell provides a PCE of 11.62% with a Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 25.93 mA cm−2 and FF = 60.61% in comparison with the binary systems PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC (PCE of 9.41%) and PTB7-Th:BPTCN (6.42%) in the absence of any extra treatments. After thermal aging at 80 °C for 450 h, this ternary solar cell exhibits increased stability with the PCE retaining 84.39% of the initial value.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE)1–10 and operational lifetime upon extended thermal and/or light stress11–18 since the emergence of a new generation of nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFAs).19 Recently, PCEs of 16−18%5–10 have been obtained for single-junction and tandem polymer solar cells. Generally, the self-assembly of solution-processed active components that consist of electron donors and acceptors requires additional treatments such as thermal annealing,20,21 solvent vapor annealing (SVA)22 and high-boiling-point solvent additives23 in order to improve the morphology and hence energy conversion. However, it is both demanding and fascinating to afford high-performance solar cells directly from the spontaneous assembly of the active layer, even without a solvent additive. In this context, only a few polymer solar cells have been reported with PCEs of up to ca. 16%24–29 while the device stability remains to be addressed.
In contrast to the binary counterparts, the ternary organic solar cells that generally contain either two electron donors and one acceptor or one donor and two acceptors offer a facile strategy to tune component crystallinity, domain size, and domain purity through manipulating their interactions. Moreover, the multicomponent cells may present additional advantages with complimentary light absorption, improved carrier transport and interfacial charge transfer.30–34
In this contribution, we describe a spontaneously assembled ternary nonfullerene polymer solar cell by introducing a new high mobility small molecular electron acceptor (BPTCN) into the NIR-responsive PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC cell (Fig. 1). The electron acceptor COi8DFIC reported previously showed extended absorption at 600–1000 nm with a maximal peak at 830 nm in the solid film. The inverted PSCs comprising the as-cast active layer PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC (1:1, wt/wt) showed a 9.93% PCE with Jsc = 22.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, and FF = 61.8%, which was increased to ∼12% with Jsc = 26.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, and FF = 68.2% through utilizing a solvent additive (DIO). As a result, the electron mobility of the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend more than doubled to a value of 3.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.25 Nevertheless, the binary PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC morphology appeared unstable, leading to large phase separation under continuous thermal stress and severe loss of PCE.14

BPTCN is a linearly conjugated compound with high planarity, involving the electron-deficient 4,7-bis(5H-4,6-dioxothieno[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole core, further functionalized by 2-(3-ethyl-5-methylene-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile through the alkylated thiophene-2,5-ylene moiety (Fig. 2). It is crystalline with a m.p. of 314 °C and electron mobility of 1.31 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The BPTCN film exhibits an absorption maximum at 569 nm, complementary to 693 nm of the electron donor PTB7-Th and 830 nm of COi8DFIC. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and RSoXS morphological characterizations reveal that BPTCN generally promotes the crystallinity of the polymer donor PTB7-Th and moreover the phase purity of the ternary blend at a proper weight loading, thus suppressing bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the ternary solar cell. Consequently, the inverted polymer solar cell (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:BPTCN/MoO3/Al) produced a Jsc of 25.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V and a FF of 60.61%. It is worth mentioning that a PCE of 11.62% was achieved without any extra manipulation to purposely optimize the active layer morphology. Furthermore, with respect to the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC cell, the ternary PSCs exhibited increased stability while retaining 84.39% of the initial PCE after 450 h of continuous thermal aging at 80 °C.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and molecular modeling of BPTCN
The synthetic route of BPTCN is shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed synthetic procedures are given in the ESI.† First, the Suzuki coupling of 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) with 5-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-1-iodo-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (2) led to (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione) (3) in 69% yield, which further gave nearly quantitatively the dibromo compound (4) via bromination. Then, the Stille coupling of compound 4 with (5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-3-octylthiophen-2-yl)tributylstannane (5) yielded the bis-acetal compound 6. After hydrolysis, compound 6 was converted into the bis-formyl compound 7, which was treated with 2-(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile to produce BPTCNvia Knoevenagel condensation. The new electron acceptor was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and microanalysis (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 software at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to explore the molecular geometry of the ground state of BPTCN. To simplify the calculations, the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). BPTCN exhibited a highly planar structure that would facilitate electron transport.
Thermal, absorption and electrochemical properties of BPTCN

BPTCN exhibited a decomposition temperature of 382 °C at 5% weight loss (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry measurement showed that it was a crystalline compound with a m.p. of ca. 314 °C. Upon cooling from the melt, it crystallized at 257 °C. However, it should be noted that BPTCN appeared to experience complex morphological transitions subject to repeated heating, which need further study.
In dilute chloroform solution, BPTCN showed an absorption peak at 449 nm with an extinction coefficient of 8.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, redshifted to 569 nm in the thin film (see Fig. 1 and Fig. S4 in the ESI†). This large redshift indicated strong intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state. The optical bandgap (Eg) was estimated as 1.72 eV for BPTCN from the absorption onset of the film at ca. 720 nm.
Cyclovoltammetry performed on BPTCN revealed three successive quasi-reversible electron reductions. According to the onset reduction potential of −0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the LUMO level of BPTCN was roughly estimated as −3.66 eV with reference to the energy level of ferrocene of −4.8 eV vs. vacuum level (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Under similar conditions, the LUMO of PC71BM was about −3.78 eV. The HOMO level of BPTCN was then calculated as −5.38 eV, according to the equation EHOMO = ELUMO − Eg. The energy level diagrams of PTB7-Th, BPTCN and COi8DFIC are plotted in Fig. 1c.
The optical properties of the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2) blends
The as-cast thin film of the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend exhibited two major well-formed absorption peaks at 739 and 835 nm, respectively, vs. 578 and 707 nm for PTB7-Th:BPTCN (Fig. 3). Introducing BPTCN into PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC from 20 to 40 wt% (A2/[A1 + A2]) produced no obvious change in the peak intensity at about 710 nm while the absorbance at the peak ca. 835 nm gradually decreased. In contrast with the ternary blends, we observed no significant spectral shift upon adding BPTCN up to 40 wt% into the NIR-absorption acceptor COi8DFIC (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the blend films PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC(A1):BPTCN (A2). Their blends (wt/wt) were spin-cast on quartz glass from a 10 mg mL−1 CHCl3 solution (total concentration) at a speed of 2000 rpm. 
Further, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat COi8DFIC and BPTCN, and PTB7-Th (D):COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2) blend films to evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the donor–acceptor(s) blends. The as-cast BPTCN and COi8DFIC films showed respectively a maximal emission peak at 732 and 982 nm (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, both the photoluminescence of BPTCN and COi8DFIC in the binary blends PTB7-Th:BPTCN and PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC was severely quenched with a respective efficiency of 87.5% and 87.1%. With regard to the binary PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC film, the PL quenching was enhanced in the ternary blends (Fig. 4b). Introducing 30 wt% BPTCN provided the highest quenching efficiency of 92.9%, which suggests that BPTCN as a second electron acceptor would facilitate exciton dissociation and hence electron transfer in the resulting blends.35

We note that very efficient Förster energy transfer occurred from BPTCN to COi8DFIC (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†). Unlike the neat COi8DFIC film, the COi8DFIC:BPTCN blend exhibited a new dominant emission at 913 nm, in addition to a shoulder at ca. 985 nm, which was apparently ascribed to COi8DFIC. Even at 40 wt% loading, no emission from BPTCN was present, indicating the possibly good miscibility between the two electron donors.
Photovoltaic performance

Characterization of the binary polymer solar cells. 
The photovoltaic response of the new electron acceptor was first evaluated in the inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:BPTCN (100 nm)/MoO3/Al). All the cells were tested under simulated AM1.5G with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The active layer was spin-cast from chloroform solution. The representative current density (J)–voltage (V) curves involving various donor and acceptor weight ratios are shown in Fig. 5, and the relevant data are listed in Table S1 (see ESI†). The best device based on the as-cast layer PTB7-Th:BPTCN (1:1.8 wt/wt) possessed a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 14.68 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.04%, giving a PCE of 6.42% (Fig. 5a). The calculated Jsc based on the EQE measurement was ca.14.12 mA cm−2, close to the experimental value (Fig. 5b).

With increasing BPTCN content up to 40 wt% (A2/[A1 + A2]), the PCE efficiency was dramatically improved. The ternary solar cell with 30 wt% BPTCN displayed a highest PCE of 11.62% with Jsc = 25.93 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V, and FF = 60.61% versus 9.41% for the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC cell (Jsc = 23.65 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, and FF = 55.26%) with no DIO treatment. The enhanced PCEs of the ternary solar cells over the binary systems PTB7-T:COi8DFIC and PTB7-Th:BPTCN primarily stemmed from the simultaneous improvement in Jsc and FF (Table 1).
The high Jsc value of the ternary solar cell with 30 wt% BPTCN was verified from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 6b). Compared with the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC cell, this ternary device showed an enhanced photo-response in the wavelength range of ca. 360–720 nm, while the response decreased in the wavelength range of ca. 720–1000 nm, which was supported by the corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 3). Noticeably, it showed a maximum EQE of 81% at 712 nm with more than 65% in a broad solar spectrum of 418–873 nm. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves based on PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC: 30 wt% BPTCN and PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC were 24.61 and 22.52 mA cm−2, respectively. The results shall be discussed below, including charge transport, charge recombination and active layer morphological characterization.

Charge carrier mobility
The hole- and electron-transport characteristics in the binary and ternary solar cells were investigated in the hole-only and electron-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/BHJ layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al) and (ITO/ZnO(40 nm)/BHJ layer/PFN-Br(10 nm)/Al), respectively (see Fig. S8 and Table S2 in the ESI†). The hole/electron mobility (μh/μe) was calculated to be 3.47 × 10−4/7.08 × 10−6 for the as-cast blend PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC (1:1.5, wt/wt) and 6.26 × 10−4/1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th:BPTCN (1:1.8, wt/wt). The electron mobility of the pure BPTCN film was as high as 1.31 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Upon incorporating BPTCN up to 60 wt% (A2/[A1 + A2]), both μh and μe of the as-cast ternary film PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:BPTCN increased, with respect to the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend. Notably, at 30 wt% BPTCN loading, μh and μe reached the highest values and became closer, due to the largely improved μe amounting to 2.77 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, hence contributing to increasing the FF.
Charge transfer, recombination, and extraction
In order to investigate the exciton generation and dissociation processes of the ternary solar cells, the exciton generation rates and charge collection probabilities were revealed by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) against the effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 7a. Jph is defined as JLigh–JDark, where JLight and JDark are the photocurrent densities under light illumination and in the dark, respectively. And Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied bias.36,37 The photogenerated excitons were almost dissociated into free charge carriers when Veff reached ∼2 V, and thus Jph could reach saturation (Jsat). We adopted the ratio of Jph/Jsat to evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge collection probability P(E, T) in the devices.38 Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E, T) values were 0.90, 0.91, 0.93, 0.92 and 0.89 for the solar cells with 0, 20, 30, 40 and 100 wt% BPTCN (A2/[A1 + A2]), respectively. It seemed that introducing BPTCN could improve charge dissociation and collection in the ternary devices, as evidenced by the increased PL quenching in Fig. 4 and the reduced Rs and meanwhile increased Rsh values in Table 1.
 Fig. 7  (a) Jph–Veff, (b) Jsc–Ilight and (c) Voc–Ilight curves of the solar cells (ITO/ZnO/as-cast PTB7-Th (D):COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2)/MoO3/Al). 
We also determined the relationship between the Jsc and the incident light intensity (Ilight) to further understand the charge recombination in the binary and ternary devices (Fig. 7b). The relationship can be described by Jsc ∝ Iαlight, where the exponential factor α is the recombination parameter. If α is close to 1, bimolecular recombination would be suppressed. The lower the α value, the higher the occurrence of bimolecular recombination.39–41 The α values were calculated as 0.947, 0.961, 0.973, 0.962 and 0.928 for the solar cells with 0, 20, 30, 40 and 100 wt% BPTCN (A2/[A1 + A2]), respectively. The α value of the ternary cell involving 30 wt% BPTCN was closest to 1, implying the least bimolecular recombination, and hence this was consistent with its improved Jsc and FF.
The dependence of Voc on Ilight was further used to probe the charge recombination, which can be expressed as: Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Ilight), where k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively.37 Bimolecular recombination may be the dominant mechanism if the coefficient n approaches 1. Otherwise, if n is substantially larger than 1, trap-assisted recombination becomes more serious.42,43 Derived from the corresponding slopes of the Voc–Ilight curves (Fig. 7c), n was obtained as 1.51, 1.26, 1.04, 1.08 and 1.80 for the solar cells with 0, 20 30, 40 and 100 wt% BPTCN, respectively. The n of 1.04 for the highest performing ternary PSCs is very close to unity and significantly less than that of the BPTCN- or COi8DFIC-based binary cell.
Film morphology
The structure order of the as-cast pure and blend films was investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD).44 The neat films of PTB7-Th, COi8DFIC and BPTCN exhibited a (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.263, 0.356 and 0.315 Å−1, yielding a lamella distance of 23.83, 17.62 and 19.90 Å, respectively (see Fig. S9 and Table S3 in the ESI†). When the blends of COi8DFIC and BPTCN were concerned, the resulting crystal coherence length (CCL) was maintained upon the addition of 30% BPTCN. The detailed information of the interaction between the two acceptors in the (100) direction may be uncovered by BPTCN's good crystallinity feature. As for the ternary blends, we note that adding BPTCN into the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend increased the (100) diffraction signal (Fig. 8). This observation is in good coincidence with the emerging absorption peak at about 710 nm in the ternary blend, attributable to PTB7-Th (Fig. 3). The crystal size estimated from the Scherrer equation was 5.88, 10.06, 5.25, and 4.05 nm upon 20, 30, 40 and 60 wt% BPTCN loading (A2/[A1 + A2]), compared to 7.5 nm in the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend.
 Fig. 8  (a) GIXD diffractograms and (b) out-of-plane (solid line) and in-plane (dotted line) line-cut profiles of the PTB7-Th (D):COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2) blends, and (c) RSoXS of PTB7-Th (D):COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2) blends (A2/[A1 + A2], wt%). 
In the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, the neat COi8DFIC film displayed a distinct (010) diffraction peak at 1.66 Å−1 with a π–π stacking distance of 3.78 Å and a CCL of 18.02 Å, while BPTCN showed a (010) diffraction peak at 1.74 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π distance of 3.60 Å and a CCL of 9.05 Å (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†). The mixture of these two acceptors (0.7:0.3 wt/wt) changed the (010) CCL to an intermediate value of 11.07 Å, indicative of BPTCN's good miscibility with COi8DFIC and the total crystallinity being reduced. The compatibility between the two acceptors is also echoed by the photoluminescence quenching (Fig. 4b) and atomic force microscopy measurements. The PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend exhibited a root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) of 1.84 nm, which was reduced by about half when adding BPTCN from 20 to 60 wt%. In contrast, PTB7-Th:BPTCN displayed the smallest Rrms of only 0.796 nm (see Fig. S10 in the ESI†).
Among the ternary blends, PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC: 30 wt% BPTCN showed the (010) diffraction peak with the largest CCL of 17.15 Å (Fig. 8 and see Table S3 in the ESI†). As can be seen from the GIXD characterizations, introducing BPTCN into the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend could generally improve the crystallinity of PTB7-Th, while BPTCN is well miscible with COi8DFIC with the latter's crystal lattice being preserved (Fig. 8b).
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was applied to study the phase separation and the average composition distribution in the ternary PTB7-Th (D):COi8DFIC (A1):BPTCN (A2) blends. As shown in Fig. 8c, we observed no obvious peak in the RSoXS scattering profiles,45–47 due to the speculation that both the acceptors COi8DFIC and BPTCN may have less contrast with the polymer donor PTB7-Th. However, scattering curve fitting could be used to solve this problem. The scattering curves in Fig. 8c could be treated using the Debye-Beuche equation , where I(q) is the scattering intensity, K is a constant, α is the correlation length and Q is the scattering invariant. By fitting the data in the low q region, we obtained correlation lengths of 21.1, 22.0, 33.3, 24.2, 23.2 and 14.6 nm for the active layers with 0, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 100 wt% BPTCN (A2/[A1 + A2]). It occurred to us that the detected smaller-sized phase separation failed to produce the best Jsc and PCE.48 On the other hand, regarding the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend, incorporating 30 wt% BPTCN greatly increased the scattering intensity, leading to enhanced phase purity and Jsc values of the corresponding solar cell by suppressing bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination. Notably, the PTB7-Th:BPTCN blend exhibited the lowest scattering intensity.
Thermal stability of polymer solar cells
Finally, we determined the thermal stability of the ternary polymer solar cell in comparison with the binary systems. The devices were encapsulated immediately after preparation in a nitrogen atmosphere using epoxy glue and glass lids before heating on the hot plate in the glove box. The photo-voltaic measurements were carried out outside the glove box at room temperature with 50% humidity. After continuous aging at 80 °C for over 450 h, the PCE of the ternary cell (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC: 30 wt% BPTCN/MoO3/Al, A2/[A1 + A2]) almost leveled off following an early rapid decline, remaining at 84.39% of the initial value, while it dropped to 72.4% and 69.6% for the binary PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC and PTB7-Th:BPTCN cells, respectively (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†). The decrease of the efficiency was due to the losses of Jsc and FF.
Conclusion
In summary, we have reported a medium bandgap electron acceptor, BPTCN, with high electron mobility for NIR-responsive nonfullerene ternary polymer solar cells. The new compound is planar and crystalline with an absorption maximum at 569 nm in the as-cast film. It exhibited a shorter π–π stacking distance of 3.60 Å relative to 3.78 Å for the NIR absorption acceptor COi8DFIC and enhanced electron mobility of 1.31 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Both the acceptors are well miscible and efficient förster energy transfer occurred in their blends. Adding BPTCN into the donor/acceptor PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blend could generally improve the crystallinity of the polymer donor PTB7-Th and moreover the phase purity of the resulting ternary blend if loaded at a proper weight ratio. Consequently, the hole and electron mobilities in the ternary blends PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:BPTCN were increased. In addition to enhancing thermal stability, it is remarkable that through suppressing bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, the optimum polymer solar cell based on the as-cast ternary blend provided an improved PCE of 11.62% without any external treatments. The present findings show that ternary solar cells may offer an opportunity to afford both high performance and stability via a spontaneously assembled active layer.
