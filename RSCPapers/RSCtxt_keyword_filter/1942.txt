    First published on 16th June 2011AbstractThe cycloaddition of readily available nitrile imines to [60]fullerene affording 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes is a versatile procedure for the functionalization of fullerenes. In contrast to other functionalization methods these cycloadducts are obtained generally in good yields as single isomers, thus avoiding the formation of undesired stereoisomers. This tutorial review discusses these less known fullerene compounds that display, however, interesting electrochemical and photophysical properties. Owing to their outstanding electron acceptor character, similar to pristine C60, and their remarkable thermal stability, these cycloadducts are good candidates for incorporation in photovoltaic devices. However, more work is needed in order to design better pyrazolinofullerenes exhibiting improved performances for PV applications.

Introduction
After the initial excitement provoked by the discovery of fullerenes and their further preparation at the laboratory scale, chemists all over the world carried out different derivatization studies which resulted in a nowadays well-established chemical reactivity of fullerenes.1 This understanding has allowed a fast development of the chemistry of less-accessible carbon nanotubes and, more recently, graphenes, by using similar synthetic protocols to those previously tested in fullerenes.2 Furthermore, the scarce and chemically different endohedral fullerenes—in which a positively charged metal or metal complex within the cage is stabilized by the electrons spread on the fullerene surface—have also been chemically modified based on the chemistry developed on the hollow fullerenes.3 Thus, the development of new chemical procedures for the functionalization of carbon nanostructures4 is of utmost importance for the application of these new carbon allotropes either in bio-medical applications5 or in materials science.6
In this regard, although cycloaddition reactions on fullerenes have been thoroughly studied ranging from [1+2] to [8+2] cycloadditions and, particularly, [3+2] and [4+2] thermal cycloadditions, not all of them have been studied to the same extent.7 Thus 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethyne ylides to fullerenes to form fulleropyrrolidines has been studied in detail since it was reported by Prato et al. in 1993.8 The synthesis of fulleropyrrolidines is probably the easiest and most general procedure for preparing fullerene derivatives due to its versatility and availability of starting materials, which has allowed preparation of a huge number of derivatives for different practical purposes.9
The aim of the present review is to highlight the remarkable properties that readily available 2-pyrazolinofullerenes—resulting from a [3+2] cyclization on the fullerene surface—exhibit. The synthesis of these modified fullerenes is mainly carried out from well known hydrazones, which has allowed a great chemical versatility based on the two positions (C-3 and N-1) available for chemical functionalization on the pyrazoline ring fused to the fullerene sphere. Controlling the nature of the organic addend at these positions allows the fine tuning of the electronic and electrochemical properties of the resulting pyrazolinofullerenes and, therefore, their further applications for practical purposes. This family of fullerenes has some important advantages over other fullerene cycloadducts such as the lack of a tetrahedral carbon on the pyrazoline ring (without considering those of the fused fullerene cage) thus avoiding the formation of undesired stereoisomers which frequently leads to the use of fullerene materials as isomeric mixtures rather than single compounds.10 Furthermore 2-pyrazolinofullerenes exhibit a remarkable thermal stability. This behavior is in contrast to that observed for other related cycloadducts, and it could have a strong impact on the stability of devices such as photovoltaic solar cells; where the increase of the temperature by exposing fullerene based materials to the sun could result in a retro-cycloaddition process and, consequently, a loss of efficiency and/or performance of the device.
In the following, after description of the synthetic protocols used to prepare 2-pyrazolinofullerenes, we have organized the presentation of pyrazolinofullerenes according to their less known chemical, electrochemical, photophysical and thermal properties, which show their interest for applications in photovoltaics, which is discussed at the end of this review.
Synthesis
The [6,6] double bond of C60 exhibits a remarkable dienophilic character. Therefore, a large variety of cycloaddition reactions, including 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, have been carried out with C60. In particular, the reaction of nitrile imines11 with [60]fullerene is site-selective to the [6,6] double bond of the fullerene, affording 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes. Due to the relatively low value of the triply degenerated LUMO of C60 (−2.88 eV), the reaction is mainly controlled by the HOMO (dipole)–LUMO (C60) interaction and, similarly to other related cycloadditions, it is accelerated by electron-donating substituents on the dipole.12
The first synthesis of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes was described by Matsubara et al. in 1995.13 The authors prepared N-chlorobenzylidene derivatives by reaction of the corresponding acyl chlorides and hydrazine, followed by treatment with PCl5. N-Chlorobenzylidene in the presence of triethylamine generates the nitrile imine which reacts with [60]fullerene to yield 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes. Nevertheless, a more useful alternative to prepare this family of compounds involves the in situ formation of the nitrile imine dipole in a one-pot procedure from hydrazones and NBS (or NCS) in the presence of triethylamine, and then further reaction with C60 (Scheme 1). Depending on the substituents of the precursor hydrazone, the reaction proceeds either under mild conditions at room temperature, or under microwave irradiation (MI). In this regard, MI has proven to be very useful in cycloaddition reactions14 as well as in fullerene chemistry,15 where formation of the respective 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes proceeds in reasonably good yields (30–40%) in a few minutes. Substitution on N-1 and C-3 of the pyrazoline ring allows preparation of a wide variety of fullerene derivatives which, in contrast to other functionalization methods for C60, do not form racemic mixtures due to the sp2 nature of the C-3 of the pyrazoline ring.

The scope of the reaction is very broad as any organic moiety, such as alkyl,16 aryl (endowed with electron-donor17 or electron-acceptor substituents),18 oligomers,19metallocenes,20 π-excedent16,20a or π-deficient heterocycles,21 can be covalently linked to C60 through the carbon atom of the pyrazoline ring. This is important for further side-chain chemistry as well as for possible applications of the modified fullerenes. For instance, bishydrazones have been used for the synthesis of C60–oligophenylenevinylenes–C60 triad 1 (Fig. 1),22 where OPV → C60 energy transfer and pyrazoline → C60 electron transfer were observed upon photoexcitation. Concerning the N-substituent of the pyrazoline ring, the p-nitrophenyl group is, by far, the most used moiety, although phenyl,23p-methoxyphenyl24 or p-iodophenyl-derivatives25 have been reported as well. Further functionalization on the aromatic ring of the N-aryl group has been achieved by reduction of the p-nitrophenyl moiety26 and subsequent amidation of the newly formed amino group (2).27 Other approaches involving palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, such as Heck28 or Sonogashira,25 have also been reported. This methodology is also suitable for the functionalization of higher fullerenes such as C70, and 2-pyrazolino[70]fullerenes29 have been obtained as mixtures of α [C(1)–C(2)] and β [C(5)–C(6)] isomers, similarly to other related functionalization methods reported for C70.30

Electrochemical properties
The study of the electrochemical properties of fullerenes31 has been a field of intense research since these materials were first isolated in gram amounts in 1990.32C60 is a relatively good electron acceptor which can be reduced up to the hexaanion33 and the relatively low value of its first reduction potential, similar to that of p-benzoquinone, makes fullerenes ideal candidates for the development of molecular and supramolecular donor–acceptor (D–A) systems able to mimic the natural photosynthetic process.
The typical features of the electrochemical properties of pristine C60 are also observed in monoadducts. However, a change in the hybridization of carbon atoms from sp2 to the less electronegative sp3 results in a higher LUMO level. For modified fullerenes it then becomes more difficult to accept electrons and, therefore, reduction becomes harder. Thus, in general, the reduction potentials of fullerene monoadducts are about 100 mV more negative than those of C60.34 A great synthetic effort has been made in order to improve the electron affinity of fullerenes. However, only a few examples, mainly polyfluorinated fullerenes35 or other derivatives bearing electronegative or electron-deficient atoms directly connected to the fullerene cage,36 have been found to be better electron acceptors than parent C60.37 Consequently, a general procedure allowing the preparation of functionalized fullerenes showing a better, or at least equivalent, electron affinity than the parent C60 has been a matter of interest for the preparation of improved D–A systems. This condition is satisfied in the addition of nitrile oxides to form isoxazolinofullerenes38 and by nitrile imines to prepare 2-pyrazolinofullerenes (vide supra).
The most simple 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerene prepared to date, the C-3 methyl derivative 3, is an example of this electrochemical behaviour.163 shows, at room temperature, four reversible reduction waves and one irreversible reduction wave attributed, respectively, to the fullerene core and the p-nitrophenyl moiety. Compared to the parent C60 (Fig. 2), this adduct showed similar values for the first and the second fullerene-based reduction waves in an o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)/acetonitrile (4:1) mixture (3, E1red = −0.63 V and E2red = −1.04 V; C60: −0.64 V and −1.05 V, respectively, vs.Ag/AgCl).

The electronic nature of the substituents linked to the carbon atom (C-3) of the 2-pyrazoline ring has a strong impact on the electron acceptor ability of the fullerene cage. In this regard, electron withdrawing groups anodically shift the first reduction potential to more negative values in comparison to the parent C60 (i.e., 40 mV for 4,20a 60 mV for 518 or 70 mV for 6.18 The shift vs.C60 is less pronounced when electron rich substituents are present (0 mV for 720 or 8,20 and 10 mV for 9,201020 and 1139) (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  The redox properties of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes can be finely tuned by controlling the nature of the substituents on the C-3 atom of the pyrazoline ring. 
The influence of the nature of the substituent connected to the sp3nitrogen atom of the 2-pyrazoline ring has been systematically studied in derivatives 12a–c (Fig. 4).40 The first reduction potential of fullerene derivative 12c bearing an electron withdrawing nitro group is shifted to more negative values by 80 mV compared to pristine C60. This shift was 40 mV vs.C60 in 12b bearing a hydrogen atom and only 20 mV when an electron donor methoxy group was present (12a). Furthermore, when electron deficient substituents are present on both sides (C-3 and N-1) of the 2-pyrazoline ring (Fig. 4), the shift of the first reduction potential is even larger (80 mV for 13 and 90 mV in the case of 1441).

Electronic and photophysical properties
The photophysical properties of 2-pyrazolinofullerenes stem from the combination of the properties of the fullerene and the substituted fused pyrazoline moiety. The features of the UV-vis spectra are typical of C60 derivatives with large absorption in the UV region and a weak and broad absorption in the visible region up to around 700 nm resulting from prohibited electronic transitions. Nevertheless, the profile is not just a superimposition of the spectra of the components, suggesting the existence of charge transfer (CT) processes.42 A typical feature of this family of compounds is the observation in 15 of a CT band at around 470 nm which is shifted toward longer wavelengths with increasing solvent polarity, as shown in Fig. 5.131H-NMR studies43 of various 2-pyrazolinofullerenes performed in solvents of different polarity confirmed the existence of the CT process in the ground state.

A representative example of the photophysical behaviour of 2-pyrazolinofullerenes is shown in the fluorescence spectra of 16. The spectra are characterized by a broad band at 697 nm with a shoulder at around 780 nm, similarly to other fullerene derivatives (e.g., pyrrolidinofullerenes) but with lower emission quantum yield. The solvent polarity has a considerable effect on the fluorescence intensity of 16. Thus, by increasing the solvent polarity, a decrease of fluorescence emission was observed (Fig. 6a).19b Moreover, a fluorescence enhancing effect was seen upon addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Fig. 6b), reverting to its initial intensity after extracting the TFA solution with a saturated solution of NaOH. The above results suggest that the lowest fullerene singlet excited state is quenched by an electron transfer occurring from the pyrazoline sp3nitrogen atom to the fullerene sphere.

(b) Fluorescence spectra of 16 in CH2Cl2 upon addition of increasing amounts of TFA up to 30% (v/v). λexc = 424 nm, isosbestic point. Reprinted from ref. 19b with permission from RSC. 
A different photophysical behaviour of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes was found in the study of the oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) derivative 1719b (Fig. 7). In this case upon photoexcitation a quantitative energy transfer takes place from the OPV fragment to the C60 sphere. The population of the lowest fullerene singlet excited state is followed by an efficient electron transfer from the pyrazoline ring (in CH2Cl2 and benzonitrile) to the C60. These photoinduced processes were found to be influenced by the solvent polarity, addition of acid, or temperature. Therefore, compound 17 exhibits interesting properties as a candidate for the preparation of a further molecular switch.

        2-Pyrazolinofullerene derivatives bearing two electron donor moieties (18) have shown an intriguing photophysical behaviour.29 Time-resolved emission and transient absorption spectroscopy studies of 18 and 19 allowed to conclude the efficient formation of a charge separated state, via the photoexcited singlet state of C70, followed by electron transfer from the electron donors to the sphere (Fig. 8). The pyrazoline ring was found to mediate a charge separation between the donor moieties and the photoexcited C70 moiety. Comparison of the photophysical properties of 18 with its C60 analogue (20) indicates that 18 displays a longer charge-separated state lifetime, which can be accounted for by enhanced radical ion stabilization on the larger C70 sphere.

Thermal stability of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes

Fullerenes and their derivatives exhibit a variety of singular electronic properties, such as small reorganization energy, high electron affinity and ability to transport charge, that make them ideal candidates to act as electron acceptor components in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic (PV) devices.44 However, these outstanding properties must be necessarily complemented by thermal stability. In particular, in devices such as photovoltaic cells, longer periods of time under sunlight exposure result in a temperature increase of the photoactive materials. Fullerene derivatives display, in general, an acceptable degree of thermal stability. However, recently, careful studies have demonstrated that fullerene derivatives such as pyrrolidino[60]fullerenes,45 methano[60]fullerenes,46 or isoxazolino[60]fullerenes47 are able to undergo thermally induced retro-cycloaddition processes affording pristine fullerenes in quantitative yields. Furthermore, an alternative method to conduct thermal retro-cycloaddition of pyrrolidino[60]fullerenes has been carried out by electrochemical oxidative electrolysis.45e A detailed study on the thermal stability of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes bearing a variety of substituents (C–aryl–N–aryl or C–alkyl–N–aryl) (Fig. 9) has been recently reported by Delgado et al.48 The authors followed a similar protocol to that described for the chemical retrocycloaddition of pyrrolidino[60]fullerenes,45a involving high temperature (refluxing o-DCB), excess of dipolarophile (maleic anhydride) to allow trapping of the in situ generated nitrile imine, as well as the use of copper triflate (Cu(OTf2)) to coordinate the metal to the nitrogen atoms and, thus, facilitate the retro-cycloaddition process. The results of this study indicate that, in contrast to other related cycloadducts, C–aryl–N–aryl–2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes (5, 6, 20 and 21) do not undergo an efficient retro-cycloaddition process under these experimental conditions. These materials can withstand even harsh conditions like high temperature (204 °C) and pressure (7 psi) induced by microwave irradiation, which reveals the high thermal stability of these compounds. The results obtained for C-alkyl-N-aryl-2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes (3, 22) under the same experimental conditions showed a different trend, as these compounds are more susceptible to undergo a retro-cycloaddition reaction to produce pristine C60. It has recently been demonstrated that C-alkyl-N-aryl-2-pyrazolinofullerenes undergo a very efficient retro-cycloaddition reaction under mass spectrometry conditions affording the corresponding fullerene fragment ion.49 Interestingly, in the presence of copper triflate, compounds (3, 22) bearing an alkyl group on C-3 undergo an additional process of allylic oxidation to generate a new fullerene derivative endowed with a reactive formyl group (23). The structure of this new compound was confirmed by NMR and accurate mass spectrometry, besides X-ray analysis of a single crystal of this compound unambiguously confirmed the proposed structure (Fig. 9).50
 Fig. 9  Top: 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes (20–22) used in the study of thermal stability. Bottom: compound 23 and its X-ray crystal structure. 
This formyl-bearing 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerene (23) can be considered as a new and versatile building block which offers unique possibilities for further chemical functionalization on the carbonyl group. Applying this concept, some of us51 have recently described the preparation of new soluble [60]- and [70]-fullerene homo and heterodimers (24–26), from 23 and N-octylglycine, following the previously reported Prato reaction protocol8 (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  [60] and [70]fullerene homodimers (24, 26) and the [60]/[70]heterodimer (25), linked through 2-pyrazolino–pyrrolidino bridges. 
Interestingly, these new fullerene dimers linked through 2-pyrazolino–pyrrolidino bridges offer a singular scenario to compare the different thermal stability of both pyrrolidino and 2-pyrazolino fragments. In order to shed some light on this issue, the thermal stability was studied under the same conditions recently used for 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes48 and pyrrolidino[60]fullerenes.45a
According to the experimental results obtained in this study, these new dimers (24–26) undergo an efficient retro-cycloaddition reaction on the pyrrolidine ring under these experimental conditions.52 As expected, the retro-cycloaddition reaction of 2-pyrazolinofullerenes was less favored. These experimental findings are in agreement with theoretical studies carried out with the two-layered ONIOM approach, thus confirming the high thermal stability of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes.
Owing to this exceptional capability to stand harsh thermal conditions, and their remarkable electron accepting character, 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes are promising candidates for materials science applications, especially in the field of organic photovoltaics, where fullerene cycloadducts have been by far the materials of choice as electron acceptors in the construction of BHJ solar cells.44
Studies of 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes for photovoltaics
As stated above, one of the most promising and realistic applications of fullerene derivatives in materials science is their use as electroactive materials for the preparation of BHJ photovoltaic devices. Although a variety of fullerene derivatives have been used for photovoltaic purposes,53 PCBM54[6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (27) remains, by far, the most employed fullerene derivative in the preparation of BHJ devices. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 5% have been reported in blends of this fullerene material and a semiconducting polymer (P3HT, poly(3-hexyl thiophene-2,5 diyl)).55 In this context, the development of new photoactive materials, including low band-gap polymers, small molecular donors and new fullerene derivatives, is currently a challenging field of research.44e
In particular, a number of examples have been reported in which 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes, acting as electron accepting units, have been blended with semiconducting polymers for the preparation of BHJ-PV devices.56
Wang et al.57 have described the preparation of BHJ-PV devices using BTPF (6)18 or PCBM as an electron acceptor, and a low band-gap alternating copolymer of fluorene (APFO GREEN 1, 28) as an electron donor (Fig. 11). This remarkable polymer absorbs light in a wide range of the solar spectrum 300 < λ < 500 and 650 < λ < 1000 nm. Interestingly, plastic solar cells prepared with 6 and APFO-GREEN 1 displayed photovoltaic behaviour in the infrared range, the external quantum efficiency being 7% at 900 nm, while the onset of charge photogeneration was found at 1000 nm. The photovoltaic study indicated that the devices prepared with BTPF showed better performance than those prepared with PCBM. These results were attributed to the LUMO energy match of the electron donor and acceptor, which supplies enough driving force for charge separation, and also to the more suitable interpenetrating network found for the case of 6: APFO GREEN 1.
 Fig. 11  PCBM (27), APFO GREEN 1 polymer (28) and BTPF70 (29). APFO GREEN 3 (30) and 4 (31) polymers. 
In an analogous study, Wang et al.58 have prepared plastic solar cells with APFO GREEN 1, and 3′(3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1′-(4-nitrophenyl) pyrazolino[70]fullerene (BTPF70, 29) as an electron acceptor (Fig. 11). This new fullerene derivative (29) was obtained as a mixture of isomers due to the multiple possibilities of addition of nitrile imines to C70, and showed better absorption properties than its C60 analogue in the visible range. Owing to the improved absorption properties of BTPF70, which nicely complement the above mentioned absorption properties of APFO-GREEN 1, films of these compounds display a broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1000 nm, resulting in a broad photocurrent response window. The results were attributed to the efficient charge separation at the interface due to a better matching of the LUMO levels of APFO-Green 1 and BTPF70. As a consequence, all the parameters governing the performance of PV devices prepared from BTPF70–APFO-GREEN 1 (Jsc, Voc, and FF) are higher compared with those obtained for BTPF–APFO-Green 1 solar cells, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 0.7%, measured under the AM 1.5 illumination from a solar simulator.
In a complementary study, new plastic solar cells using BTPF70 and two structurally similar APFO-Green polymers, namely APFO-Green 3 and 4, were prepared (Fig. 11).59 As previously observed, the devices fabricated with the new polymers displayed excellent photocurrent response from 300 to 1000 nm, although the PCE values were not improved when compared with APFO-Green 1.
In order to obtain a better understanding of the mobility of charge carriers in these devices, thin film diodes with APFO-Green 1, APFO-Green 1:PCBM and APFO-Green 1:BTPF70 were prepared and the charge transport was determined by analyzing the space charge transport (SCT) I–V characteristics.60 According to these results, the mobility of the holes is governed by field and temperature. A mobility of μ0 = (8.0 ± 0.4) × 10−10 m2 V−1 s−1 was calculated at room temperature. The electron mobility was improved with increasing both acceptors. However, BTPF70 provides better driving force for exciton dissociation when mixed with APFO-Green 1. The above experimental findings reveal that new pyrazolinofullerenes prepared by design are needed in order to increase the PCE values. In this regard, a better miscibility with the polymer including solubilizing alkyl chains as well as a better control on the reduction potential values which eventually control the Voc parameters61 are important issues to be addressed.

Fullerene dimers are known to exhibit low solubilities in organic solvents,62 thus limiting their applications in materials science. However homo (24: C60–C60 and 26: C70–C70) and heterodimers (25: C60–C70) (Fig. 10) bear an octyl chain which permitted a thorough characterization and study of these compounds. As expected, [70]fullerene dimers showed better absorption properties in the visible spectrum than the [60]fullerene analogues. The external quantum efficiency of BHJ solar cells fabricated with these compounds (26) and P3HT (Fig. 12) shows a broad photoresponse from 300 to 700 nm, the highest value being for the C70–C70 dimer (37%). Interestingly, non-optimized BHJ solar cells formed by blending P3HT and these dimeric compounds display moderate power conversion efficiencies (around 1%).

Recently, Shoae et al.63 have compared the charge recombination dynamics observed in films comprising P3HT blended with three different fullerene derivatives: PCBM, compound 23, and its propyl ketal analogue. The study of the transient absorption data indicated that replacement of PCBM with either of the 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes results in a transition from bimolecular to geminate recombination dynamics. Similar evidence have recently been found by Pal et al.64 comparing the charge recombination dynamics of PCBM and BTPF70 in films with P3HT. Shoae et al. explained this transition in nanomorphology of the blends, which indicates that 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes generate a much finer phase segregation than that observed for PCBM, thus inhibiting the dissociation of the initially generated radical pairs into fully separated uncorrelated charges.
Conclusions
The cycloaddition of nitrile imines to [60]fullerene to prepare 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes is a general and versatile procedure for the functionalization of C60. Hydrazones are readily available in one step from aldehydes in almost quantitative yields and the corresponding cycloadducts are obtained generally in good yields, avoiding the formation of undesirable stereoisomers, in contrast to other functionalization methods. Furthermore, C-3 and N-1 atoms allow the presence of a wide variety of organic addends easily attainable by chemical synthesis, which allows control of the electronic and electrochemical properties of the resulting modified fullerenes. Owing to their outstanding electron acceptor character, similar to parent C60, 2-pyrazolino[60]fullerenes are not as good candidates as other related systems (such as methanofullerenes of type PCBMs, DPMs, etc.) for incorporation in photovoltaic devices. Nevertheless, more work is needed in order to design better pyrazolinofullerenes for PV applications. In this regard, more precise control of the solubility and miscibility with the polymer, morphology and charge transport are important concepts to be addressed by chemical synthesis. Important, however, is the remarkable thermal stability shown by these cycloadducts which is a critical issue to assure the stability of the corresponding solar cells.
