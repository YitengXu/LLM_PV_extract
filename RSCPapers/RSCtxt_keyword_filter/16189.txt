    , Accepted 3rd September 2015First published on 3rd September 2015AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films with fine control over composition and pure phase were fabricated by sulfurization of co-electroplated Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors. We have systematically investigated that the concentration of Cu(II) ions can influence the properties of CZTS absorber layers and the photovoltaic performance of the resulting solar cell devices. The results indicate that an increase in Cu(II) concentration almost linearly increases the Cu content in the final CZTS thin films, greatly enhances the (112) preferred orientation, significantly improves the crystallinity of the absorber layer, remarkably reduces the ZnS secondary phase, and hence improves their photovoltaic performance. However, a further increase in the Cu(II) concentration degrades the crystal quality of the absorber layer, and forms the CuSx secondary phase, which is quite detrimental to the device photovoltaic performance. Here we introduce a novel sputtered CdS buffer layer for the CZTS solar cells. For the first time, co-electrodeposited CZTS solar cells exceed the 7% efficiency threshold. These findings offer new research directions for solving persistent challenges of chemical bath deposition of CdS in CZTS solar cells.
1. Introduction
Kesterite copper zinc tin chalcogenide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has recently attracted intensive attention as an important photovoltaic material for scalable production of thin-film solar cells due to its earth-abundant and non-toxic elements, and an optimal direct band gap with the predicted theoretical maximum efficiency of 32.4% (Jsc = 29.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.21 V, FF = 89.9% and Eg = 1.48 eV).1–4 To date, the reported highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the pure sulfide CZTS, pure selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and mixed sulfo-selenide Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) have reached 8.5%,5 11.6%,6 and 12.6%,5,7 respectively, which however are lower than those of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (21.7%) and CdTe (21.0%) solar cells.5 To improve the PCE of CZTSSe solar cells, they are usually prepared by adjusting the ratio of Se/S to obtain the tunable band gap from 1.0 to 1.5 eV during a harmful selenization process.2,8–15 Chen et al. calculated that the high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells based on absorber layers with high Se content reduce the band gap and thus CZTSSe solar cells with high Se content have better photogenerated current than CZTS solar cells (high S content).16 Liu et al. demonstrated that the PCE of CZTS solar cells can be improved from 5.73% to 8.25% through optimizing the ratio of S/(S + Se).17 Recently Su et al. reported the fabrication of CZTS solar cells with a PCE of 9.24% by doping Cd into CZTS thin films to form Cu2Zn1−xCdxSnS4 (CZCTS) thin films with tunable direct band gaps.18 Although the PCE of CZTS solar cells is much less that of CZTSe, CZTSSe and CZCTS solar cells, the continued development of more environment friendly and large-scale photovoltaic processes for CZTS solar cells is essential because they do not use toxic Se and Cd elements.
Various deposition methods have been developed for the fabrication of CZTS absorber layers, both vacuum-based and non-vacuum solution-based deposition approaches, and they have yielded a range of efficiency levels. However, the control of the pure-phased CZTS absorber layer with Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions is an extremely challenging task, largely due to the narrow compositional stability window of the kesterite compound.19 Thus the precise control and adjustment of the composition, phase, and properties of the absorber material is very important in producing high-efficiency CZTS solar cells. The vacuum-based deposition approach for the preparation of CZTS solar cells is currently based on sputtering of the suitable metal precursor layers or on co-evaporation of the individual metallic elements followed by sulfurization at high temperatures in the presence of S vapor and/or H2S gas. Specifically, Katagiri et al. reported a PCE of 6.77% for CZTS solar cells with the element ratio of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.85 and Zn/Sn = 1.25 prepared by co-sputtering metallic precursors followed by sulfurizing in H2S.20 Shin et al. reported a record PCE of 8.4% using an ultra-thin CZTS absorber having the element ratio of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.78 and Zn/Sn = 1.25 via a thermal co-evaporation method.21 The advantage of these high-vacuum deposition techniques is the versatility afforded by the integration of multiple evaporation or sputtering sources, thereby leading to good control over the film composition and phase profile. However, vacuum conditions necessitate an evacuated confined space, which is not conducive to the cost-effective deposition of uniform films over large-area substrates. Furthermore, these techniques generally suffer from a relatively slow throughput, low material utilization and considerable energy expenditure to heat or sputter from the target sources. For these critical issues, alternatively, several non-vacuum approaches, such as hydrazine-based approaches,7,9–12,15 sol–gel methods8,17,18,22–25 and electrodeposition26–31 could offer a low-cost route for preparing CZTS absorber layers.
Among these techniques, the electrodeposition approach has received a great deal of attention in recent years because of its simplicity, low equipment cost, cheap raw materials and room temperature growth. Furthermore, there is no need to use toxic solvents or ligands like hydrazine. Generally this approach can be further divided into two groups: (i) stacked elemental layer,26,27 and (ii) co-electrodeposited layer.28–31 For instance, an outstanding PCE of 7.3% has been achieved using stacked electroplated CZTS absorber layers with Cu/Sn = 1.83, Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.78 and Zn/Sn = 1.35.26 Recently, a high PCE of 7.99% (active area: 0.03 cm−2) has been reached for the stacked electrodeposition CZTS solar cells with Cu-poor and Zn-rich (Cu content = 0.23, Zn/Sn = 1.2) that were fabricated from preheated Cu/Zn/Sn metallic stack precursors.27 This metal stack approach manifests the precise control of compositional uniformity through the accurate manipulation of the thickness of metal layers on the nanoscale. Current issue for metal stacked precursors is the morphology of the Sn precursor which is very rough compared to the other elemental precursors. In addition, the poor morphology of CZTS is due to non-uniform nucleation of the Zn precursor. We have recently reported that CZTS solar cells can be co-electrodeposited via CZTS absorber layers with Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.82 and Zn/Sn = 1.31, with the best yielding 6.6% efficiency.28 Compared to the stacked elemental approach, co-electrodeposition approach has not been thoroughly investigated even though the simple fabrication process of the precursor is one of its significant advantages.
The above-mentioned results indicate that CZTS absorber layers having Cu-poor and Zn-rich makeup result in high-efficiency solar cells. One of the issues in the synthesis of CZTS compounds is that there exists a narrow kesterite phase stability region,19 and the exquisite controllability over composition and phase is critical in achieving high quality CZTS thin films. The influence of the Cu content on the grain growth is quite controversial: an improvement in the crystallinity of co-evaporated CZTS thin films with the increase of the copper content has been observed,32 whereas the opposite trend is seen for the sol–gel processed CZTS thin films.25 As far as we know, very few investigations on the metal salt concentrations (e.g., Cu(II), Zn(II) and Sn(II) ions) in the co-electroplated CZTS precursors have been reported, so we have systematically investigated the influence of Cu(II) ions on the formation process of CZTS thin films and device performance. Interestingly, it is found that the increase in Cu(II) ions results in a notable improvement in the micron-sized grain of final CZTS thin films, in accordance with the same trend also obtained in co-evaporated CZTS thin films,32 and consequently improves the device efficiency.
To date, high-efficiency CZTS solar cells have been reported where a high-resistivity CdS thin film deposited by the traditional chemical bath deposition (CBD) is always employed as a buffer layer.6–13,17,18 However, the major drawback is that the CBD–CdS buffer layer typically produces a large amount of toxic Cd containing waste. In addition, ammonium hydroxide is usually utilized during the deposition process, which is highly volatile and toxic to human health. Besides, the volatility of ammonia changes the pH of the deposition bath solution and influences the performance of the CdS buffer layer. Moreover, a redundant treatment in a wastewater process greatly increases the cost. Therefore, here we report a novel sputtering approach to process the CdS buffer layer, which is suitable for reducing the environmental impact and enhancing the continuity of the deposition processes. In this paper, we have demonstrated the successful use of a sputtered CdS buffer layer for CZTS solar cells with high efficiencies as high as those fabricated using CBD–CdS.21,26–28 To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 7.1% is the highest value reported to date for CZTS solar cells prepared by the co-electrodeposition approach. Moreover, our results offer the possibility to realize environmentally benign, scalable, low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells.
2. Experimental
CZTS thin films were prepared on molybdenum coated glass substrates (3.0 × 2.5 cm2, 0.7 μm Mo/glass) by sulfurization of co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors, as detailed in our previous work,28 with slight changes in the concentrations of the Cu(II) ions. All raw chemicals are of analytical reagent grade (supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China). The precursor solutions were made by simultaneously dissolving metal sulfates of Cu(II) (5–20 mM), Zn(II) (20 mM), Sn(II) (20 mM), tartaric acid (20 mM), trisodium citrate (100 mM) and sodium thiosulfate (10 mM) in non-toxic aqueous solutions (200 mL) at room temperature. The concentration of Cu(II) ions was systematically varied from 5 to 20 mM at an interval of 5 mM. Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed and amperometric I–t curves were recorded at room temperature without stirring using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument, USA). The Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors were co-electrodeposited at −1.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 30 min at room temperature under an air atmosphere. After the deposition, the precursors were then sealed in a rapid thermal process (RTP) furnace containing 0.5 g of sulfur powder with a purity of 99%. The RTP process was heated up to 570 °C (ramp to 570 °C at 5 °C s−1) for 15 min. The sulfurized CZTS thin films were denoted CZTS(05), CZTS(10), CZTS(15) and CZTS(20) corresponding to the Cu(II) concentration.
The sulfurized CZTS absorber layers were employed for the fabrication of complete thin film solar cell devices with a conventional structure of glass/Mo/CZTS/sputtered CdS/i-ZnO/AZO (without an antireflection layer). Notably, prior to CdS deposition, all CZTS thin films were sputtered for 10 min to etch the superficial ZnS secondary phase. CdS (∼150 nm, see Fig. S2†), i-ZnO (∼50 nm) and ZnO: Al (∼700 nm) were subsequently deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. Finally, the samples were mechanically scribed into individual cells with a total area of 0.20 cm2. The structural properties of the prepared CZTS thin films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman measurements were performed using the 532 nm line of a 50 mW Ar+ laser and the 325 nm line of a 0.5 mW He–Cd laser as excitation sources. The morphologies and chemical compositions were observed using a Philips S360 scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached to an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, accelerating voltage of 20 kV, measured area of 20 × 20 μm2). The elemental components were obtained as the average values between the two regions at the surface of the films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI 5000C ESCA system with a Mg Kα source at 14.0 kV and 25 mA. All the binding energies were referenced to the contaminant C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of CZTS solar cells were performed using a continuous light solar cell performance tester system in the dark at 25 °C and under simulated air mass AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Xe lamp, Newport). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed by a single source illumination system (Qtest Station 1000AD EQE) combined with a monochromator. A calibrated Si-cell was used as the reference for the J–V as well as for the EQE measurements.
3. Results and discussion
As copper, zinc and tin elements have a large difference in the standard reduction potentials and reduction kinetics,31 it is proven to be a challenge to produce a dense and smooth Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor from the electrolyte solution. Fig. 1a shows the typical cyclic voltammogram (CV) that was carried out in the potential window range from 0.12 to −1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) to investigate the growth parameters and optimize the potential of co-electrodeposited Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursors. It also shows that the reduction peak potentials for Cu(II), Sn(II) and Zn(II) at the studied concentrations are −0.05 V, −0.45 and −0.83 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The result indicates that the reduction potential gap between Zn and Cu becomes smaller (ECu − EZn = 0.05 V + 0.83 V = 0.88 V) in comparison with 0.14 V and −0.96 V (>1.1 V) for Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions due to the addition of citrate in the electrolyte. In addition, the reduction potential of Cu slightly shifts toward a less negative potential with increasing Cu(II) concentration, which indicates that Cu(II) concentration might affect the Cu content in the CZTS absorber layer. A further negative shift in the potential results in the decrease of the cathodic current density until the potential reaches −1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), where the evolution of hydrogen begins (visible bubble formation). Based on the obtained results in Fig. 1a, the co-electrodeposited potential was selected to be −1.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the current density–time behavior is shown in Fig. 1b.

The composition of the sulfurized CZTS thin films is very likely related to their electrical properties. For high-efficiency CZTS solar cells, there is an empirical rule that the Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios are 0.75–1 and 1–1.25, respectively.19 To investigate the effects of Cu content on the quality of CZTS thin films, different Cu(II) concentrations (5.0, 10, 15 and 20 mM) were utilized in the precursor solutions. Table 1 and Fig. S1† show the elemental compositions of the CZTS thin films from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The content of Cu increases almost linearly while that of Zn and Sn decreases in all CZTS thin films, which reveals that the amount of Cu in these thin films gradually increases with the increase in Cu(II) concentration. The average compositions of all films are the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio of <0.96, Zn/Sn ratio of >1.32 and S/metal >1.0 (sulfur in ∼50% excess), which suggests that the highly desired Cu-poor and Zn-rich CZTS absorber layers can be formed. These composition ratios for the cations diverge a bit from other best compositions reported in the literature,13,19,21 where the ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.8 and Zn/Sn = 1.2 are generally reported to yield the best results. All CZTS thin films have different compositions even though the same sulfurization process was applied to all precursors with different Cu(II) concentrations. Thus, it is necessary to control a Cu-poor state in CZTS, and the Cu content in the finally produced CZTS thin films can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of Cu(II) in the precursor solution, without any additional procedures.

The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CZTS thin films with different Cu(II) concentrations (5, 10, 15 and 20 mM) co-electroplated onto Mo glass/substrates are shown in Fig. 2a. The main diffraction peaks of the sulfurized CZTS thin films at the 2θ values of 18.21°, 28.53°, 32.98°, 47.33° and 56.18°, apart from the peaks arising from the Mo underlayer, can be attributed to the (101), (112), (200), (220) and (312) planes of the kesterite CZTS structure (JCPDS 26-0575) with a strong preferential orientation in the (112) direction, indicating the formation of the CZTS phase.28 The enlarged (112) peak region in the 2θ of 27.0–30.0° gradually increases and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) decreases with the Cu(II) concentration increase from 5 to 15 mM, but the (112) peak drops and the FWHM increases with further increasing the Cu(II) concentration to 20 mM. These changes demonstrate the enhancement in the crystallinity of CZTS thin films, which can presumably be attributed to the increase in the predicted grain size, as observed in the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of CZTS thin films in Fig. 3a–c and e–g.

Although XRD techniques are commonly used to determine the crystalline structure of phases, they cannot be distinguished clearly here because the (112) peak of the kesterite CZTS (2θCZTS = 28.53°, JCPDS 26-0575) is very close to the (111) peak of cubic ZnS (2θZnS = 28.50°, JCPDS 36-1450) and if co-existed in the synthesized films. Therefore, Raman scattering spectroscopy with a 532 nm excitation wavelength (red spectra) was used to confirm the presence of kesterite CZTS and/or its secondary phases. Raman peaks corresponding to the kesterite CZTS phase are observed at 249, 288, 338, 349 and 368 cm−1 in Fig. 2b, agreeing well with the reported characteristic CZTS vibration modes.23,24,26,28 Raman spectra also reveal the presence of an additional peak at 475 cm−1 assigned to CuxS for only CZTS(20) thin films with excess Cu,24,31 which could lead to the decrease in the electrical performance due to the low energy gap and high interfacial recombination velocity. Besides, it can be observed that the intensity of the peak at around 338 cm−1 firstly decreases and then increases with increasing Cu(II) concentration, the same trend is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2a).
ZnS is a well-known secondary phase present in CZTS absorber layers,19,22 but it is also difficult to precisely identify the ZnS phase using Raman spectra with a 532 nm excitation wavelength. For further phase elucidation, Raman analysis was performed with a 325 nm excitation wavelength (blue spectra) similar to the ZnS band gap (∼3.7 eV). The Raman spectrum of the same samples is significantly different, as shown in Fig. S3,† where the peak at 345 cm−1 can be assigned to the primary vibration mode of ZnS,22 yet the CZTS Raman characteristic peaks are very weak. The high intensity of this peak is because of the existence of a quasi-resonant excitation of the ZnS vibrational mode at this excitation condition, in which Raman spectroscopy becomes extremely sensitive in the detection of even small quantities of ZnS in the sample.33 The intensity of the ZnS peak becomes relatively weak and very broad with increasing Cu(II) concentration, which indicates that the content of ZnS in CZTS films decreases in combination with the compositions as shown in Table 1. The experimental results indicate that the secondary phase of ZnS co-exists mainly at the surface of the CZTS thin film, rather than in the region close to the CZTS/Mo interface.22 More importantly, the selective removal of the superficial ZnS secondary phases could be done more easily by etching in deionized water, cyanide and hydrochloric acid, which becomes an effective method to improve solar cell performance. Here our CZTS thin films were handled by RF sputtering for 10 min. This process is important to realize a clean interface at the p–n junction.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the oxidation states of the CZTS thin films’ surface elements (Fig. S4†). Two characteristic Cu 2p core level spectra clearly show binding energy values for the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks at 952.4 and 932.6 eV with a peak splitting of 19.8 eV, indicative of Cu(I). The Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks located at 1045 and 1022 eV show a peak separation of 23 eV, revealing the formation of the Zn(II) state. In the Sn 3d core level, 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks are located at 494.5 and 486.1 eV, respectively, corresponding to the Sn(IV) state with a characteristic binding energy of 8.4 eV. Finally, the S 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks in the spectra are located at 162.5 and 161.3 eV with a peak splitting of 1.18 eV, consistent with S in sulfide compounds. It is clear that the XPS analysis confirms that in these films, the elements are in the valence states of Cu(I), Zn(II), Sn(IV) and S(II), respectively. Fig. 3 shows the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of CZTS thin films deposited from different Cu(II) concentrations. Clearly, there are significant differences in average grain sizes ranging from 0.9 μm for CZTS(05), 1.8 μm for CZTS(10), 2.0 μm for CZTS(15) to 1.1 μm for CZTS(20). Moreover, the MoS2 layer is not observed between the CZTS absorber layer and the Mo back contact. When the Cu(II) concentration increases from 5 to 15 mM, the grain size of CZTS thin films becomes larger, the film surface is denser, and isolated grains with large size and well-defined boundaries are formed, as evident in Fig. 3a–c. Furthermore, the improvement of crystallinity of CZTS thin films is also consistent with the above results of XRD and Raman. This may be due to the fact that the CuxS phase as a flux induces the liquid phase densification and crystallization, in accordance with the results also obtained in co-evaporated CZTS and CIGS thin films,32,34 because it has a relatively low melting point. The cross-sectional images of the CZTS (05, 10 and 15) thin films are shown in Fig. 3e–g. It is found that the increase in Cu(II) concentration results in a thicker large-grained top layer and a reduction in the fine-grained nanocrystalline bottom layer. A similar bi-layered structure was also observed previously in this material.26–28 The large grains with less grain boundaries are beneficial for device performance due to less opportunity for the recombination of photogenerated carriers at the grain boundaries and/or increased carrier mobility.28 But when Cu(II) concentration rises up to 20 mM, the grain size of CZTS(20) thin films begins to reduce; the corresponding cross-sectional image shows that the thicknesses of small grains significantly increase compared with other CZTS thin films. Finally, we could draw the conclusion that the optimal Cu(II) concentration is 15 mM, since the corresponding CZTS(15) thin film has the best crystal quality considering its strongest peak of XRD and Raman.
The electrical device characteristics of several devices obtained from CZTS absorber layers deposited from different Cu(II) concentrations are presented in Fig. 4a, and all the device parameters are listed in Table 2. All device parameters dramatically improve with the increase in Cu(II) concentration from 5 to 15 mM, resulting in a dramatic increase in PCE from 4.0% to 7.1%; one of the devices obtained from the CZTS(15) absorber layer has the best PCE of 7.1, which is the highest efficiency among all the reported CZTS solar cells prepared by co-electrodeposition. Also the series resistance (Rs) of the CZTS(15) device is quite lower than that of others. The improved device performance mainly stems from the enhanced open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). These changes are mainly attributed to the observation of a high-quality microstructure with large grains (>1 μm), free of conducting CuxS and less high-resistivity ZnS, as seen in SEM and Raman analysis (see Fig. 2b, 3 and S3†). In comparison with the record CZTS solar cell (PCE = 8.4%, FF = 65.8%, Voc = 661 mV, Jsc = 19.5 mA cm−2 and Rs = 4.5 Ω cm2),21 the PCE in our device is predominantly limited by low FF (55.5%) due to high Rs (12.6 Ω cm2) and low Rsh (669.3 Ω cm2). This can be ascribed to the bottom of the small-grained CZTS absorber layer. Hence, it would be an optimum sulfurization condition (temperature, pressure and time) to achieve homogeneous CZTS absorber layers with large densely packed grains. The additional increase in a MgF2 antireflection coating may improve the PCE to over 7.5%. When the Cu(II) concentration is increased from 5 to 15 mM, Voc significantly improves from 546.7 to 614.3 mV, which can be associated with enhanced carrier activation in the absorbers;35 moreover, the Rsh value of CZTS(15) device is relatively higher than that of other CZTS solar cells, as shown in Table 2. Consequently a higher Rsh can also give rise to a higher Voc. However, the PCE of the CZTS(20) device is limited by a high Rs (20.5 Ω cm2) and a lower Voc (572.6 mV), resulting in a substantial loss in FF (52.2%). We speculate that these values could be attributed predominantly to the conducting CuxS phase in CZTS absorber layer with small grains (see Fig. 2b and 3d, h) since it acts as a shunting path or blocks current flow36 thereby diminishing the device performance. Further optimization of the precursor composition (Zn(II) and Sn(II) ions) is important for fabricating a CZTS absorber layer composed of a large grain size and phase purity in order to improve the device performance.

Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding CZTS solar cells in wavelengths ranging from 300 to 1000 nm. The wavelengths below ∼520 nm (blue light collection) are slightly poorer than those reported by others,6–15,22–27 which is consistent with a higher absorption characteristic and a lower transmittance of the sputtered CdS thin film due to our films slightly thicker than those reported CBD–CdS6–15,22–27 (150 nm) shown in Fig. S5 and S6,† respectively. Compared to the reported electrodeposited CZTS solar cell (PCE = 7.3%, Jsc = 22 mA cm−2),26 a short wavelength loss occurs at the front of the CZTS(15) solar cell (PCE = 7.1%, Jsc = 21.8 mA cm−2), this effect is compensated for by an enhanced medium wavelength (520–750 nm) response, as shown in Fig. S5.† This can be explained by the fact that the sputtered CdS film has a relatively good quality as shown in Fig. S7 and the inset of Fig. S2.† Moreover, CdS thin films deposited on both the glass substrate and CZTS/Mo/glass substrate exhibit the polycrystalline diffraction peaks corresponding to hexagonal H(002)/C(111) and H(004)/C(222) planes. As the Cu(II) concentration increases from 5 to 15 mM, the maximum EQEs of the CZTS solar cells increase from ∼62% to ∼90% (at 560 nm), which could occur if interface recombination at medium wavelength (520–800 nm) has been improved. This improvement is consistent with a higher Jsc shown in Table 2, which can be explained by the fact that the absorber layer from a high Cu(II) concentration has better CZTS quality: larger grains with less grain boundaries and free of detrimental CuxS secondary phase. However, the EQEs in the visible range gradually decay for longer wavelength regions beyond the band edge (>800 nm). This decay is most likely caused by poor minority carrier diffusion length and/or insufficient penetration of the depletion width into the absorber.11,27 In addition, the band gaps of the CZTS(15) and CdS thin films are estimated about 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV, respectively, from the EQE spectra by fitting a plot of [Eln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E near the band edge, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4b, which is in reasonable agreement with the reported values.24,28
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have introduced an innovative sputtered CdS buffer layer for CZTS solar cells that shows a similar functionality level to a CBD–CdS buffer layer, and offers exceptional opportunities for the scalable and safe manufacture of low-cost and high-performance photovoltaic technologies. The PCE of 7.1% is the highest reported so far for co-electroplated CZTS thin film solar cells. Our results clearly show that a relatively high Cu(II) concentration enhances the (112) preferred orientation and crystallinity of the absorber layers, accordingly reduces the series resistance, and apparently improves the device efficiency by the simultaneous enhancement in Jsc, Voc and FF. However, the CZTS absorber layer with an excess of Cu degrades the crystal quality and forms a CuSx secondary phase, which is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance especially Voc. This work not only opens up a very important and promising route to preparing high-efficiency CZTS solar cells but also provides a critical pathway to reduce the environmental impact and enhance the continuity of the solar modules.
