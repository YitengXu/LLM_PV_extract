    , Accepted 16th October 2014First published on 20th October 2014AbstractUV/ozone treated (UVO-treated) TaS2 and non-treated TaS2 nanosheets are introduced into organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) as hole extraction layers (HEL) and electron extraction layers (EEL). TaS2 nanosheets are obtained via ultrasonic vibration and size-controlled by centrifugation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal that the thickness and lateral size of TaS2 nanosheets are approximately 1 and 70 nm, indicating that uniform and ultrathin TaS2 nanosheets are obtained. The work function of TaS2 increases from 4.4 eV to 4.9–5.1 eV after applying UVO treatment by forming Ta2O5. In addition, the power conversion efficiencies of normal OPV with UVO-treated TaS2 and inverted OPV with TaS2 are 3.06 and 2.73%, which are higher than those of OPV without TaS2 (1.56% for normal OPV and 0.22% for inverted OPV). These results indicate that TaS2 is a promising material for HEL and EEL layers in OPVs.
1 Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have emerged as competitive devices for harvesting clean and sustainable energy in the near future. To date, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% has been obtained,1–3 bringing the actual manufacture of OPVs one step closer to being realized. The performance of OPVs can be improved by sandwiching a buffer layer between the cathode (or anode) and the active layer in order to facilitate electron (or hole) transfer. In normal OPV (N-OPV), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as the hole extraction layer (HEL) owing to its suitable work function (∼5.0 eV) and ease with which it can be deposited on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate via solution processing. PEDOT:PSS is, however, highly acidic and hygroscopic and results in the damage of the ITO surface. This damage, in turn, leads to rapid degradation of the device.4–6 Various materials such as MoO3,7,8 NiO,9 MoS2,10–12 WO3,13 WS2,14 and V2O5,15 have, therefore, been investigated in order to overcome these drawbacks of PEDOT:PSS. In the case of inverted OPV (I-OPV), low work function metal oxides such as TiO2,16 TiOx,17,18 ZnO,17 Cs2O3,19 and Al,20 are used on the ITO/glass substrate as electron extraction layers (EEL) to improve the stability of OPVs.
Recently, single- and multiple-layered, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2-D TMDs) have attracted much attention owing to their superior properties. These properties enable their use in a wide range of applications including phototransistors, field effect transistors, sensors, batteries, hydrogen reactions, water splitting, and solar cells.10–12,14,21–27 Single layer 2-D TMDs can be obtained through chemical cleavage, liquid exfoliation, and chemical vapor deposition.22 Exfoliation by ultrasonic vibration is the simplest method from which 2-D nanosheets can be obtained at room temperature for large scale production. In addition, applications, such as MoS2 and WS2 as HEL in OPV, which include 2-D TMDs are both more stable and efficient than PEDOT:PSS.10–12,14
TaS2 nanosheets are structurally similar to MoS2 and WS2. They are layered compounds with three-coordinate sulfide and trigonal prismatic Ta centers. Each layer is 6–7 Å thick, and consists of a hexagonally packed Ta atom layer sandwiched between two layers of S atoms.28 The sandwich layers are bound by a weak van der Waals force.28 This weak binding force facilitates exfoliation to a single layer by means of ultrasonic vibration. Moreover, the electrical resistivity of TaS2 is approximately 10−3 Ω cm, which is much lower than that of MoS2 and WS2 (18 and 0.1 Ω cm).29–31 It is reported that the resistivity of the buffer layer plays a vital role in the performance of OPVs. Specifically, the lower resistivity of the buffer layer results in the higher performance of the device.32 TaS2 should therefore be a promising candidate for use as a buffer layer for OPVs. To this end, 2-D TMD TaS2 nanosheets were fabricated in this study by means of ultrasonic vibration and applied to OPVs as HELs and EELs in order to improve the performance of OPVs. The UVO-treatment method was used to modulate the function of TaS2 from EEL to HEL. The properties of the material and the performance of N-OPV and I-OPV based TaS2 were investigated and discussed.
2 Experimental section
The synthesis of TaS2
TaS2 and N-methyl vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. An ultrasonicator (SONICS VCX-750, Sonicator Microtip Probes) was used to exfoliate TaS2. This was done by first dispersing 30 mg of TaS2 in 10 mL of NVP and then ultrasonically vibrating the resulting solution for 4 hours at 400 W. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (DAIHAN WiseSpin® CF-10) for 10 min at 5000, 6000, 8000, and 10000 rpm in order to remove TaS2 which have large sizes. The floating solution containing the ultra-thin, exfoliated TaS2 nanosheets was pipetted out and the solvent was removed by repeated washing of the sheets with isopropanol. The final product was dried at 30 °C in a vacuum oven and the resulting powder of TaS2 nanosheets was dispersed in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) for further measurement and thin film coating.
The fabrication of N-OPVs
N-OPVs were fabricated using a patterned ITO coated glass substrate. The ITO/glass was cleaned with acetone, iso-propyl alcohol, and deionized water for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath and then dried and exposed to UV/ozone (UVO) for 15 min. TaS2 nanosheets in DMF (1 mg mL−1) were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 90 s and dried at 150 °C in air. The UVO treatments were subsequently performed for various periods of time in order to determine the optimum conditions. For the sake of comparison, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed for 10 min at 150 °C in air. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS was measured as 40 nm using a Dekteck profiler. HEL-coated substrates were then transferred to a N2 filled glove box for further processing. Furthermore, poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM, 6:4 wt%) were prepared in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1, followed by heating at 60 °C for 12 h. After spin-coating the P3HT:PCBM at 700 rpm for 30 s, the substrate was kept in a petri dish for 1 h, to allow for slow evaporation, and baked at 110 °C for 10 min. Finally, the cathode with LiF (1 nm thickness) and Al (100 nm thickness) were thermally deposited at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of the resulting device was approximately 4 mm2. The schematic structure of N-OPVs based on UVO-treated TaS2 is shown in Fig. 1(a).
 Fig. 1  Schematic structures of (a) N-OPV and (b) I-OPV based on TaS2. 
Fabrication of I-OPVs
The I-OPVs were fabricated into an ITO/glass/TaS2 (TiOx)/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Al structure (Fig. 1(b)). The substrate and active layer were prepared following the same procedure that was used to produce the N-OPVs. In this case, however, the TaS2 layer was annealed in a glove box in order to avoid oxidation. For the sake of comparison with TaS2, sol–gel TiOx solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm and then dried at 150 °C in air. The process was completed by thermally depositing 1 nm thick MoO3 and 100 nm thick Al on top of P3HT:PCBM at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr.
Characterization
Ultraviolet (UV)-vis absorption spectra (V-670 UV-vis spectrophotometer) were collected in order to confirm the change in size of TaS2. Similarly, contact mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100/PSIA) was used to determine the thickness of the exfoliated TaS2. Synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) experiments were also performed. These were conducted in an ultra-high-vacuum chamber (base pressure of ≈10−10 Torr) at a 4D beam line in the Pohang Acceleration Laboratory. The onset of photoemission, corresponding to the vacuum level at the surface of TaS2, was measured using an incident photon energy of 250 eV with a negative bias on the sample. The results were corrected for charging effects by using Au 4f as an internal reference. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve was measured using a Keithley 2612 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the conversion of solar radiation to electrical power was then calculated using the equation  where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the illumination power.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows the change in peak positions in the UV-vis spectra for different centrifugation speeds. The peak that appears at 641 nm in the bulk material corresponds to a band gap of 1.9 eV. According to previous reports, absorption peaks originate from the excitation state of the metal in MoS2 and WS2 materials.33,34 Since TaS2 has a similar structure to that of MoS2 and WS2, the peak at 641 nm is assumed to come from the bonding between 4f and 3p orbitals of the sulfur atom. The peak position decreases from 593 nm (2.09 eV) to 472 nm (2.63 eV) with increasing speeds in the range of 5000 to 10000 rpm (Fig. 2(a)). This decrease is indicative of a reduction in particle size. There was, however, no significant decrease of wavelength for speeds higher than 10000 rpm. This suggests a saturation of the effect of centrifugation speed in obtaining uniform and ultra-thin TaS2 nanosheets. A speed of 10000 rpm was, therefore, used for further characterization and device fabrication. TaS2 on the SiO2/Si substrate was also imaged by AFM (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(b) reveals that centrifugation resulted in uniform and fully covered ultrathin TaS2 nanosheets. The height difference of the TaS2 nanosheets was measured along the red line in the AFM image and the thickness and lateral size were measured to be approximately 1 and 70 nm, respectively. This lateral size (70 nm) is much smaller than that obtained from the lithium intercalation exfoliation method.35 These results, therefore, indicate that bulk TaS2 was exfoliated into uniform TaS2 nanosheets by means of ultrasonic vibration.

The composition of the UVO-treated TaS2 film was determined by SRPES in order to understand the effect of the treatment on these films (Fig. 3). The Ta 4f peak of the spin-coated nanosheets is composed of two doublets. One of the doublets has binding energies of 24.7 and 26.6 eV which correspond to the Ta4+ 4f7/2 and Ta4+ 4f5/2 of TaS2, respectively. The two smaller peaks located at 26.9 and 28.8 eV indicate the presence of Ta5+ 4f7/2 and Ta5+ 4f5/2 of Ta2O5, which is formed during the fabrication process.35,36 The relative intensity of Ta5+ 4f increases with UVO treatment time, suggesting the formation of Ta2O5. The SRPES spectra of O 1s shown in Fig. 3(b) have two separate peaks, which located at 531.6 and 532.9 eV. The peak centered at 531.6 eV corresponds to the oxygen bonded to Ta5+ and the peak at 532.9 eV identifies the absorbed oxygen on the surface.36 It is shown that the peak height with UVO treatment time, for the binding energy of 531.6 eV, confirms that the TaS2 nanosheets were partially converted to Ta2O5. These results indicate that UVO treatments partially convert TaS2 nanosheets to Ta2O5.

Fig. 4(a) plots the changes in the work function of TaS2 for various UVO treatment times. The onset of the secondary electron was determined by extrapolating two solid lines from the background and straight onset in the spectra.37 The work function of exfoliated TaS2 is 4.4 eV. UVO treatments of 15, 30 and 45 min increase this value to 4.9, 5.0 and 5.1 eV, respectively. It is assumed that treating with UVO introduces oxygen into the lattice of TaS2 thereby forming Ta2O5, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the work function. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the schematic band diagram of N-OPV and I-OPV, which, as previously stated, are used as HEL and EEL, respectively. The work functions of ITO, PEDOT:PSS, TiOx, LiF/Al, and MoO3 were adopted from the literature.8,11,14,20,38 Based on these work functions, it seems that UVO-treated TaS2 nanosheets are suitable for HEL, while non-treated TaS2 nanosheets are suited for EEL.

Fig. 5(a) compares the J–V curves of N-OPV based on TaS2 for various UVO treatment times. N-OPV with bare TaS2 nanosheets HEL has a PCE value of 0%. Non-treated TaS2 nanosheets are, therefore, unsuitable for HEL in OPVs. For reliable values, each experiment was repeated at least 5 times. It is considered that the remnant solvent which was attached on the surface of TaS2 in the synthesis step deteriorates the performance of OPVs. UVO treatment cleans the surface as well as increases the work function. After performing the UVO treatment for 15 min, the PCE of N-OPV increased to 3% with Jsc = 8.09 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, and FF = 61%. The PCE then slightly increased to 3.06% (Jsc = 7.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, and FF = 64%) after prolonging the UVO treatment time to 30 min. However, no further improvement was observed for UVO treatment times longer than 30 min. This observation suggests that 15–30 min is the suitable time for UVO treatment of TaS2 nanosheets. The TaS2 nanosheets treated by UVO for 30 min have a work function of 5 eV, which facilitates hole injection from the active layer to the ITO anode. Thus, the PCE of OPVs with UVO-treated TaS2 is approximately 96% higher than that of the device based on bare ITO (PCE = 1.56%, Jsc = 7.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.4 V, and FF = 49%) and comparable to the value of the PEDOT:PSS-based device (PCE = 3.28%, Jsc = 8.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, and FF = 65%). The device characteristics of N-OPV are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 5(b) plots the J–V curve of the I-OPV based on TaS2. The PCE of OPV without EEL is only 0.22% owing to the energy difference between the ITO and the active layer. After inserting the TaS2 nanosheets as EEL, the PCE of I-OPV increased to 2.7% (Jsc = 8.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.6 V, and FF = 52%), which is comparable to the device with the well-known TiOx EEL (PCE = 2.5%, Jsc = 8.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.55 V, and FF = 56%). The device characteristics of the I-OPV are summarized in Table 2. These data suggest that TaS2 nanosheets can be used as both HEL and EEL in OPVs.

4 Conclusion
Ultrathin TaS2 nanosheets were produced by means of ultrasonic vibration and applied to OPVs as interfacial layers for both the cathode and anode. The reduction of the UV-vis peak suggested that the layer thickness of TaS2 decreased upon ultrasonic vibration. Furthermore, AFM imaging revealed that the thickness and lateral size of TaS2 nanosheets are approximately 1 and 70 nm respectively. UVO treatment of TaS2 nanosheets resulted in an increase of the work function from 4.4 eV to 4.95 eV. In addition, the PCE of N-OPVs increased from 1.56 to 3.06% by inserting UVO-treated TaS2 as the HEL. The insertion of non-treated TaS2 in I-OPV as the EEL also improved the PCE from 0.22 to 2.73%. These results demonstrate that TaS2 nanosheets are promising candidates for both anode and cathode interfacial layers which can improve the performance of OPV devices through solution processing.
