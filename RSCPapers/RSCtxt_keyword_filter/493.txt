    , Accepted 21st August 2014First published on 22nd August 2014AbstractIn this study, we report a novel strategy to make nanostructure Pt counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A platinum hydrosol was used as a precursor of Pt nanoparticles and electrochemically deposited onto FTO conductive glass without a sinter, and exhibited excellent catalytic performance for use as counter electrodes for N719-based DSSCs.
DSSCs as alternatives to traditional silicon-based devices have attracted widespread attention due to their clean and pollution-free nature, low consumption, easy fabrication and powerful harvesting efficiency.1 Generally, a typical DSSC is a sandwich structure device composed of a dye-sensitized working electrode (WE), catalyst-coated counter electrode (CE) and a redox-active electrolyte to connect the electrodes.2 As one of the key components, the CEs are responsible for transferring the electrons arriving from the external circuit to the redox electrolyte and for catalyzing the transformation of iodide (I2) to triiodide (I3−).3 Given the excellent catalytic activity of platinum for the regeneration process, it is used as a first choice for the CE material in DSSCs,4 and hence is the most commonly used at present.
With regard to the preparation of the CE electrode, the most common method involves thermal decomposition with chloroplatinic acid, and with this, Yella et al. achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 12.3%.5 The major drawbacks of the thermal decomposition are the high energy consumption (as it requires heat treatment) and it is time-consuming (including preparation, sinter and cooling time). For the future application and development of DSSCs, building a simple, efficient and low-energy-consumption method would improve the specific surface area of the catalyzer, reduce the energy consumption and hence shorten the payback time, and reduce the preparation time. Recently, our group has made some breakthroughs in this area and has successfully prepared a sinter-free nanostructure Pt electrode by introducing a PtCl62−–citrates system. This work not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs compared with the conventional method, but also reduces the preparation time to 15 min, and dispenses with the high temperature sinter process (note: in the following text, the NPt-5, NPt-10, NPt-15, NPt-20 and Pt represent the nanostructure sinter-free electrodes prepared by electrodeposition for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, and the electrode made with conventional sinter method, respectively).

Fig. 1a and b represent the surface morphology of the NPt-15 and Pt CEs obtained by SEM on the FTO glass. Fig. 1a clearly shows the NPt-15, with a size of a few nanometers, uniformly formed on the surface of FTO glass without any aggregation. This uniform and dense distribution provides a large specific surface area for catalytic activity. In contrast, the Pt electrode sintered by the conventional method (as shown in Fig. 1b) formed a bulk aggregation with a sheet structure. Obviously, the former with more reaction sites must have a higher catalytic activity compared to the latter.

To further study the existing form of Pt elementary substances in the precursor hydrosol, the particle-size distributions of platinum particles in the nano-platinum hydrosol were also analyzed by TEM. Fig. 1c shows the TEM images of platinum particles in the nano-platinum hydrosol, and reveals that the Pt nanoparticles formed relatively dense micro-balls with small pores. The high magnification image in Fig. 1d clearly shows that the mean diameter is in the range of 5–8 nm.
The photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs with NPts and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. S1, 2 and Table S1.† The DSSC with conventional CE (Pt) achieved a PCE of 9.72% (Jsc = 19.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 740 mV, ff = 0.67). While the one with NPt-15, achieved 10.1% (Jsc = 20.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 742 mV, ff = 0.68). However, that with NPt-5, NPt-10, or NPt-20 had a lower efficiency than that with Pt. Therefore, a deposition time either too long or too short could deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of such devices. As shown in Fig. 1, the various photovoltaic properties of DSSCs with different CEs are due to there being less catalytic sites formed with short or long deposition times than that with a deposition time of 15 min. A short time deposition cannot produce enough catalytic sites, while longer times can lead to aggregation of the Pt nanoparticles into blocks and hence can reduce the specific surface area.

J–V characteristics of the DSSCs using NPts and Pt counter electrodes. 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiments of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical NPt or Pt CEs were carried out at normal temperature, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The EIS parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the ZSimpWin software via the circuit model inserted in Fig. 3, and the final results are summarized in Table S1.† As revealed in Fig. 3, the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), which is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of CEs materials, the resistance of FTO glass substrate and the contact resistance.6 The magnitude of the Rs follows the order: Pt > NPt-15 > NPt-5 > NPt-10 > NPt-20, which should benefit the increase of the Jsc of DSSCs with NPts, due to the lower Rs (higher conductivity). The first semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface,7 which changes inversely with the catalytic ability of the CEs for the reduction of I3− to I−, while the semicircle in the lower frequency region is attributed to the Nernst diffusion process (ZN).8 The Rct values of the symmetrical cells with NPt-5-20 and Pt were 3.5, 3.3, 1.6, 1.9, and 5.1 Ω, respectively, indicating that the sinter-free Pt CEs were much more efficient for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I− compared to Pt. The minimum impedance value of Rct was achieved with the NPt-15 electrode, indicating that the best electro-deposition time is 15 min, which is consistent with the photovoltaic performance results (Table S1†). On the other hand, the values of the ZN (which represents the impedance of the diffusion of the redox species in the electrolyte for DSSCs) for the NPt-5-20 electrodes are much smaller than that of the Pt electrodes, showing a faster diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte. For the relationship between the fill factor (FF) and the total internal resistance, the decrease in the total internal resistance (ZN + Rs) is beneficial to the increase in the fill factor of the DSSCs, which is consistent with the literature results.9–11 Furthermore, the NPt CEs had higher CPE values, reflecting the large active specific area,12–14 which is a critical issue for high catalytic activity.

To understand the interfacial charge transfer properties of the triiodide/iodide couple on the surface of NPt-15 and the Pt CEs, Tafel polarization measurements were conducted using a dummy cell similar to the one used in the EIS measurements. The curves show logarithmic current density (J) as a function of voltage (V) (as shown in Fig. 4) at room temperature for the iodide/triiodide. In theory, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones. The curve at low potential (|U| < 120 mV), at an intermediate potential (with a sharp slope), and at a high potential (horizontal part), which can be attributed to the polarization zone, the Tafel zone and the diffusion zone, respectively. In the latter two zones, we can obtain information on the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), which are closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalysts.15 In the Tafel zone, the anodic and cathodic branch of the curve shows a larger slope for NPt-15 than Pt CE, indicating a high J0 on the electrode, according to the Tafel equation. This means that NPt-15 has a superior catalytic activity for I3− reduction. In terms of the EIS results, the change tendency of J0 for various electrodes is generally in accordance with those presented in the Tafel curve plots. In the diffusion zone, NPt-15 showed a high Jlim relative to that of Pt, reflecting a higher diffusion velocity for the redox couple in the electrolyte.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were obtained to reveal the catalytic activity of different electrodes, and they showed two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 gives the typical voltammograms for the iodide electrolyte. As is well-known, catalytic activity can be evaluated by the peak current density and by the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) of the Aox and Ared peaks. Namely, the higher the peak current density and the lower the Epp value, the better the catalytic activity is. For the CV curves, the current density strongly relies on the electrode morphology. As shown in Fig. 5, only NPt-15 exhibits a higher current density than Pt, due to its higher specific surface area and catalytic activity. As for the redox peaks, the cathodic peak of NPt-15 is moved toward the positive end, whereas the anodic peak is moved toward the negative end compared with Pt. In other words, the Epp of Pt was larger than that of NPt-15. Theoretically, Epp varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks), and the ks value for NPt-15 is larger than Pt.16,17 Moreover, the lower Epp indicates that NPt-15 had a better reversibility for the redox reaction of the triiodide/iodide, which produces favorable conditions for the regeneration of the sensitizer. We thus conclude that NPt-15 has the best electrocatalytic activity.

In this work, using nano-platinum hydrosol (self-made) as a precursor and citrate salt as a reducing agent, as well as a stabilizer and dispersant, nanostructure Pt electrodes were prepared with electrodeposition, and could be used as the counter electrode of DSSCs directly, without the need for a sinter process. According to the results of the EIS, the Tafel curves and the CV tests for the symmetrical cells with two identical NPts or Pts, the NPt CE fabricated with a deposition time of 15 min had the lower Rct, higher J0 and Jlim, higher peak current density and lower Epp value compared to sintered Pt, which showed that the NPt-15 CE had the best catalytic activity. This is consistent with the test results of the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs with NPts or Pt CEs. With NPt-15, we achieved the best PCE of 10.1%. This method has thus not only opened up a new way for the fabrication of high efficient DSSCs devices, but also can be used for the preparation of CEs for flexible DSSCs due to its sinter-free properties.
