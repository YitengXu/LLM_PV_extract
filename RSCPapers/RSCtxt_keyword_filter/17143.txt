In a typical configuration of inverted PSCs, the widely used ETL compound is the fullerene-based phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which currently is the best organic ETL material. The cost of this compound is very high, and the morphology and electrical properties are very sensitive to experimental conditions. We here propose a new organic ETL material for the replacement of PCBM in inverted PSCs. We demonstrate metal-oxide-free solution-processed inverted PSCs using the n-type sulfur-containing azaacene 10,14-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]phenazine (TDTP) as the ETL with a power conversion efficiency of ∼18.2%, which is higher than that of the corresponding non-sulfur-containing azaacene 10,17-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]quinoxalino[2,3-i]phenazine (PYPH)-based PSCs (up to 9.5%) or PCBM-based PSCs (up to 17.0%). This superior performance is attributed to the stronger interaction between TDTP and the perovskite surface than that between PYPH and the perovskite surface, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Our results show that easily-accessible simple n-type sulfur-containing small molecules are promising ETL candidates to further propel inverted PSCs to practical applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention because of their simple solution processing1,2 and high performance (over 20%)3–5 and are considered as possible next-generation solar cells to replace Si-based ones.6 In particular, the ambipolar semiconducting behaviour of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) makes the configuration of the as-fabricated solar cells more diverse, ranging from traditional architectures (n-i-p) to inverted structures (p-i-n).7–10 In a typical traditional architecture (n-i-p), the perovskite layer is sandwiched by a solid-state hole transport layer (HTL, for example, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD))11–13 and a metal-oxide-based electron transport layer (ETL, for example, TiO2).14–17 The highest performance of this type of solar cell can exceed 20%.3 However, high-temperature annealing to prepare metal oxides can be an obstacle for the solution-processed fabrication of this type of solar cell under low temperature (<100 °C), especially when flexible substrates and large-scale R2R techniques are desired. We are therefore motivated to construct metal-oxide-free inverted PSCs (p-i-n).18,19
Despite the attractiveness of metal-oxide-free inverted PSCs, it is very challenging to find suitable ETL candidates to realize solution-processed high-performance metal-oxide-free inverted devices. Only a few ETL materials have been found so far. Most of them are fullerene derivatives (such as C60 and PCBM),20–22 which initially exhibited poor performance with low power conversion efficiency (PCE, ∼3.9%).23 Later, several attempts including film formation engineering, interfacial control, and an n-doping method have been developed to improve the cell's efficiency, stability, and hysteresis effects.24–29 In addition, the morphological controllability of PCBM under annealing conditions could also result in different device performances of solar cells.30,31 Only recently, using a rather elaborate fabrication procedure with a doped oxide layer as the HTL (by substituting Ni(Mg)2+ ions, and Ti4+ ions on the NixMg1−xO lattice) and PCBM as the ETL which was further covered with an n-type oxide layer of TiOx (doped with Li+ and Nb5+ ions), the PCE could be pushed to 18.1%.32 On the other hand, some n-type organic compounds have been reported as ETLs in hybrid PSCs.33,34 However, especially, further modification of these polymers to reach stable high-performance in inverted PSCs becomes very challenging. Therefore, new low-cost easily-synthesizable n-type ETL materials that can simplify the fabrication process of PSCs and simultaneously maintain high device performance are extremely important.
Compared with PCBM, n-type organic small molecules are more attractive as ETLs because their structures are easy to be synthesized and be modified for tuning their energy levels to match the band position of the light absorption layer. Also it is more convenient to introduce sulfur species into their molecular structures, which is believed to dramatically improve the interfacial interaction between the ETL molecules and the perovskite layer through S–I or (S–Pb) bonding.35,36 Such considerations prompted us to investigate sulfur-containing azaacene molecules because they have been demonstrated to display good electron mobility in high performance n-type field-effect transistors.37
Here we report that the novel small molecule n-type sulfur-containing azaacene molecule 10,14-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]phenazine (TDTP) can fully replace the PCBM ETL in a metal-oxide-free PSC and simultaneously achieve higher performance. We present solution-processed high-performance inverted PSCs based on MAPbI3 perovskite as the light absorbing layer, sandwiched by poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the HTL and TDTP as the ETL. For comparison, we also present the same inverted PSCs based on non-sulfur-containing azaacene 10,17-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]quinoxalino[2,3-i]phenazine (PYPH) and PCBM, respectively. The all-solution processed metal-oxide-free devices based on TDTP reach a PCE as high as 18.2% under standard AM 1.5G illumination, which reveals its potential to replace PCBM (17.0%) in perovskite photovoltaic applications.
Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, TDTP (1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS are provided in Fig. S1–S3,† respectively) was prepared in 52% yield through the straightforward condensation reaction between 4,7-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,6-diamine and 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione.38 The UV-vis–NIR absorption spectrum (Fig. 1a) of TDTP in dichloromethane solution shows two absorption bands (200–500 nm and 550–930 nm), which originate from the [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) segment and charge transfer from the dithienylbenzothiadiazole skeleton to the phenanthroline group. The absorption edge of TDTP extends to ∼880 nm, from which the optical band gap (Eoptg) is estimated to be 1.41 eV. Cyclic voltammetry of TDTP in dichloromethane solution (Fig. S7†) suggests that TDTP has one reversible reductive wave, which defines the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of TDTP to be −4.03 eV using the equation of ELUMO = −[4.8 − EFc + Ere/onset] eV (Fc+/Fc (−4.8 eV) as a reference). Its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is estimated to be −5.44 eV according to the equation of EHOMO = ELUMO − Eoptg. The device architecture employed and the corresponding energy level diagram for the various layers are depicted in Scheme S1† and Fig. 1b. The LUMO energy level of TDTP lies between the energy level of MAPbI3 (the light absorbing material) and aluminium (electrode), which suggests that TDTP might be an excellent ETL candidate for inverted PSCs.

The absorption spectra (Fig. S9†) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure MAPbI3 perovskite (morphology and XRD are shown in Fig. S10 and S11†) and bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films were studied to further evaluate the suitability of TDTP as an ETL material for inverted PSCs. For comparison, the PL spectrum of a bilayer perovskite/PCBM thin film was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, both TDTP and PCBM can quench the PL intensity of perovskite, however, the quenched effect of TDTP is obviously better than that of PCBM. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of pure perovskite and bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films are also tested to confirm that TDTP can quench the PL of perovskite. The photogenerated carrier lifetime of the perovskite thin film (152 ns) (Fig. 2b) exhibits a sharp decline in bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin film (4.7 ns) configuration. Because of timescale limitations of our TRPL measurements, we further used a mapping model of TRPL to directly visualize the distinct difference between the pure perovskite film and bilayer perovskite/TDTP film in Fig. 2c and d. As shown in Fig. 2c, the PL characteristic of pure perovskite shows strong uniform yellow-orange PL, while in the bilayer perovskite/TDTP film, the PL intensity becomes very weak and almost no yellow-orange color can be observed (Fig. 2d). This mapping model of TRPL further confirms the effective quenching of TDTP in the bilayer thin film, indicating that the charge transfer from perovskite to TDTP takes place efficiently at the perovskite/TDTP interface. These results strongly point to the viability of employing TDTP as the ETL in inverted PSCs.

(c) Images of the PL mapping model using TRPL measurements of bare perovskite. (d) Bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films. It is clearly revealed that the PL of the perovskite thin film is quenched after coating TDTP on it, which is reflected in the color of PL from yellow orange (high intensity) of bare perovskite to dark blue (weak intensity) of bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films. 
In order to further explore the potential of TDTP in PSCs, inverted planar PSCs using TDTP as an ETL material were fabricated. A ∼30 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS HTL was spun on the top of the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s under ambient conditions, followed by an annealing treatment at 130 °C for 30 min in air. A 350 nm-thick perovskite layer was spun on PEDOT:PSS HTL in a glovebox. The as-spun perovskite layer was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to remove the solvent and form the perovskite phase (Fig. S10 and S11†). Different thicknesses of TDTP were employed to examine their effect on device performance, as shown in Fig. 3a. Note that no thermal annealing was used in this case. By increasing the thickness of TDTP from 2 to 10 nm, the PCEs gradually increased. When the thickness of TDTP was increased to 15 nm, the device performance showed a slight decline. The summarized device parameters are shown in Table 1. The PCE of the device with a 10-nm thick TDTP as the ETL can reach 12.8% with a current density of 18.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V, and a high fill factor of 71.8%, which shows the promising effectiveness of this small molecule in PSCs. In this context, PSCs with different annealing temperatures were further fabricated to achieve optimized device performance. For each annealing case, the treatment duration was 5 min in the glovebox. As shown in Fig. 3b, with the increase of annealing temperature from 60 to 100 °C, a PCE of 16.0% under 80 °C annealing can be reached, following a current density of 21.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V, and a high fill factor of 76.4%.

To understand the annealing effect of TDTP thin films on device performance, we measured the electron mobility using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of glass/ITO/Cs2CO3/TDTP/Ca/Al, as shown in Fig. 3c. By fitting the curve of ln(I/V2) versus V1/2, we obtained electron mobilities for TDTP of ∼2.8 × 10−4, 4.6 × 10−3, 2.5 × 10−3, and 2.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 under room temperature (RT), 60, 80, and 100 °C, respectively. These results are consistent with the observed device performance for different annealing temperatures of TDTP. The optimized current density versus voltage curve of the PSC using TDTP as the ETL is shown in Fig. 4a. A repeatable high PCE of 18.2% was obtained with a current density of 22.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.05 V, and a fill factor of 77.7%. Fig. 4b shows the incident photon–electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the champion device, which presents a very strong and flat spectral response over a wide wavelength range. The integrated current density derived from the IPCE spectrum is 22.1 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with our measured result of 22.4 mA cm−2. In order to investigate the hysteresis behaviors, the best-performing device with TDTP as the ETL was performed in both forward and reverse scan directions. As shown in Fig. 4c, our device has shown a slight difference in the PCE. Fig. 4d presents a histogram of PCEs of PSCs within one batch contributing to our study. Totally 36 PSCs were fabricated using the optimized process and this distribution exhibited an average efficiency exceeding 17.0%.

For comparison, a novel n-type nonsulfur-containing azaacene PYPH (structure, synthesis and characterization are provided in ESI Fig. S4–S6 and S8†) was employed as an ETL material and showed a PCE of 9.5% (Fig. 4e) with a current density of 17.19 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.86 V, and a fill factor of 64.3%. The thiophene group can act as a Lewis base, which may bind to the under-coordinated Pb ions in the perovskite crystal, leading to a passivated perovskite surface to enhance the device performance.36 In addition, a reference device using PCBM as the ETL was also fabricated (Fig. 4f), and showed a PCE of 17.0% with a current density of 22.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.04 V, and a fill factor of 73.7%. Our results clearly indicate that the device performance using TDTP is much better than that with PYPH or PCBM as ETLs and could be a good replacement for the fullerene-based material in high-performance PSCs.
To elucidate the interaction between the TDTP molecule or the PYPH molecule and the surface of perovskite, their absorption energies were studied by the first-principles method. Since the MAPBI3 has two phases near room temperature (the alpha phase and the beta phase), the model we used here is the beta phase (namely 110-beta-perovskite, although the 100-alpha-perovskite surface looks like the 110-beta-perovskite surface). Firstly, a TDTP molecule in a unit cell with the size of 25.284 × 25.029 × 35.411 Å3, a PYPH molecule in a unit cell with the same size, and a 4 × 4 MAPbI3 110-perovskite surface in the same size unit cell were optimized and their energies were estimated with all the same calculation parameters. Secondly, the optimized molecules were randomly placed on the optimized 110-perovskite surfaces. Ab initio NVT ensemble molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were carried out to find the minimal energy absorption configuration. The lowest energy configurations during the MD simulations were chosen as the absorption configuration. Thirdly, the absorption configurations were optimized until the force on every ion is smaller than 50 meV Å−1, and then their energies were calculated. The absorption energy is defined by E = Efinal − Einitial = Epm − Em − Ep, where Epm is the total energy of the molecule absorbed on the 110-perovskite surface, and Em and Ep are the total energies of the molecule and the 110-perovskite surface, respectively. All the calculations were performed using VASP 5.3 with PBE exchange-correlation functional revised for solids.39

Table 2 shows the energies of these structures. The absorption energy (AE) of a TDTP molecule on a 4 × 4110-perovskite surface is −0.972 eV, which is about three times higher than the absorption energy of a PYPH molecule on the same surface. This conclusion confirms our argument that the interaction between TDTP and the perovskite surface is stronger than that between PYPH and the perovskite surface. Fig. 5 shows the optimized configuration of molecules on the 110-perovskite surface. The absorption distance between the TDTP molecule and the 110-perovskite surface is about 3.3 Å, which is much smaller than the absorption distance between the PYPH molecules and the 110-perovskite surface (4.4 Å).

Conclusions
The new sulfur-containing azaacene small molecule TDTP can effectively replace PCBM (the leading organic ETL material) as the ETL and achieve better performance in metal-oxide free all-solution-processed PSCs. Compared to PCBM, the sulfur-containing TDTP yields stable devices and is very easy to synthesize at low cost. The results described above may open a new door for designing high performing organic small conjugated n-type molecules for achieving metal-oxide-free, PCBM-free, high efficiency, stable, all-solution-processed inorganic–organic hybrid PSCs.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis procedure of TDTP and PYPH.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) Normalized absorption spectrum of TDTP in dichloromethane solution. (b) Energy level diagram for the materials used in this work.	 

 	Fig. 2  PL characteristics of the device. (a) PL characteristics of pure perovskite and bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films. For comparison, the PL curve of the bilayer perovskite/PCBM thin film is shown. (b) TRPL curves of pure perovskite and bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films. (c) Images of the PL mapping model using TRPL measurements of bare perovskite. (d) Bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films. It is clearly revealed that the PL of the perovskite thin film is quenched after coating TDTP on it, which is reflected in the color of PL from yellow orange (high intensity) of bare perovskite to dark blue (weak intensity) of bilayer perovskite/TDTP thin films.	 

 	Fig. 3  Typical J–V and IPCE characteristics of the PSCs. (a) Current density–voltage curves of PSCs with different TDTP thicknesses. (b) Optimized device performance with different annealing-temperatures of TDTP as the ETL. (c) Current–voltage curves of electron-only devices with a structure of glass/ITO/Cs2CO3/TDTP/Ca/Al.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Current density–voltage curve of inverted planar perovskite solar cell with TDTP as the electron transport layer. (b) IPCE and corresponding integrated short-circuit current curves for the best-performing perovskite solar cells with TDTP as the ETL. The integrated JSC value for the best device is 22.1 mA cm−2, which is in good accordance with the measured result. (c) Hysteresis curves of perovskite solar cells with TDTP as the ETL. (d) Device efficiency distribution for 36 devices within one batch. The green curve is the result of a Gaussian function fit to this distribution. (e) Current density–voltage curve of the inverted planar perovskite solar cell with PYPH as the electron transport layer. (f) Current density–voltage curve of the perovskite solar cell with traditional PCBM as the ETL.
