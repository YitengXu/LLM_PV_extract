    , Accepted 15th March 2022First published on 16th March 2022AbstractThe term “sustainable solar cell” deals with human health and realizing the sustainable development of society. As a potential candidate, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been a hot topic for decades, recently achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%. However, most of the raw materials used in the production of PSCs are on the list of hazardous substances by various environmental agencies. Although the chemical and physical strategies have initially attempted the pursuit of low-toxicity PSCs, the PCEs of these “green” PSCs are still much lower than that of their counterparts. Hence, identifying the trade-off between toxicity and efficiency has become prominent for the commercialization of PSCs. In this perspective, we first discuss the latest strategies for handling lead. Next, various solvents involved in the manufacturing of PSCs are reviewed and classified according to their sustainable potential. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the perovskite cations and halogens is provided. Overall, we emphasize that the pursuit of a high PCE and low toxicity is driven by the development of commercial PSCs, where maintaining the balance between the two is vital in achieving genuinely green and sustainable PSCs.Guoyu DingGuoyu Ding is a Master's Degree candidate at Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (SIOM) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).

1. Introduction
To eliminate pollution from burning things to gain energy, photovoltaic (PV) technology will play an increasingly important role as an efficient and clean power supply in daily life. Accordingly, perovskites with a significant light absorption coefficient,1 high carrier mobility,2 and compatibility with low-cost preparation3 have attracted extensive attention for solar energy harvesting in the last decade. The perovskite photovoltaics research era gained significance in 2009 when first PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% were realized using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) as a light absorber.1 Later, in 2011, N. Park, et al. further increased the PCE up to 6.54%, indicating the great potential of perovskite solar cells.4 However, at that time, the perovskite dots attached to the surface of TiO2 dissolved in the iodide electrolyte, seriously restricting the device performance. Subsequently, this limitation was overcome by employing a solid-state hole-conducting material, spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), raising the PCE to over 9.7%.5 Attracted by the rapidly increasing PCE of PSCs, current research is focused on their potential for the next generation of efficient photovoltaics,6,7 including understanding the photovoltaic mechanism,8,9 characterization of the material features,10,11 studies on their photophysical properties,12,13 optimizing the interface engineering,14,15 and designing the device structure,16,17 which contributed to the performance enhancement to over 25.5% in 2021.18
PSCs exhibit an unmatched growth rate in the history of PV, especially compared to commercial silicon solar cells.19 The certified PCE for perovskite modules has reached 20.2%/20 cm2, and that for the perovskite/silicon tandem structure is 29.5%. PSCs have broad application prospects due to their excellent performance. Furthermore, due to their tunable bandgap and ease of preparation, perovskite-based solar cells have great potential to be combined with the commercial silicon PV to achieve a high power conversion efficiency.16 The ability of PSCs to deliver a considerable specific power (electrical power available per mass) gives them opportunities for space applications.20 The high extinction coefficient of perovskite materials allows the preparation of high-efficiency solar cells with ultra-thin light-absorbing layers, offering an ideal candidate for translucent building-integrated photovoltaics and flexible and wearable electronics.21–23 It is believed that the industrialization process of PSCs will be implemented at the terawatt scale and contribute to global decarbonization within a few years. This has witnessed the birth of many PSCs start-ups from the laboratory to industry in recent years, laying the physical foundation for their large-scale applications.
Although the excellent properties of perovskites present a bright future for PSCs, there are severe bottlenecks in their sustainable utilization that still need to be overcome (Fig. 1). Specifically, PSCs still have a long way to surpass commercial application standards in terms of stability. Their instability in light is attributed to their relatively weak hydrogen bonding, which is broken under illumination, triggering the migration of the halogen in perovskites.24 Moreover, the inferior thermal stability of the organic components of perovskites leads to their decomposition at the operating temperature.25 Furthermore, moisture and oxygen in the ambient environment can act as stimuli to accelerate the degradation of perovskites.26,27 Recently, significant efforts have been made to fine-tune the structure of perovskites through component doping and ion substitution to improve their light and thermal stability.28 Simultaneously, introducing a hydrophobic buffer layer, electrode replacement, and impermeable packaging have been explored to protect perovskites from moisture and oxygen.29,30 Their instability issue has been dramatically improved by composition engineering, structural optimization, and sophisticated encapsulation techniques.

Another recognized barrier in achieving sustainable PSCs is their toxicity. The toxicity of PSCs prohibits their introduction in daily life, even if their stability and preparation issues are resolved, considering that a large number of PV modules will be involved to ensure a steady energy supply. Therefore, the production and operation of perovskite solar modules must be environmentally friendly to address pollution concerns and achieve sustainability. Regrettably, many toxic substances are inevitably employed in the large-scale production of ABX3-based PSCs.31,32 Also, the composition of OIHP introduces toxic organic ions and halogens. Simultaneously, the current efficient PSC technology is mainly based on perovskites with the B site occupied by lead ions. However, Pb2+, if accumulated through the food chain and ecosystem, has a devastating effect on the hematopoietic, neurological, reproductive, and metabolic system in humans.33–35 In addition to considering the toxicity of lead, the large amounts of organic solvents utilized in the solution process are also a major source of toxicity. Although the solution process significantly lowers the fabrication costs, organic solvents can harm the ecosystem by polluting the soil or water bodies. For instance, the primary solvent applied in the synthesis of the perovskite precursor, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), has acute toxic effects on the skin mucous membranes and organs. In addition, long-term exposure to DMF has a high probability of causing harmful effects on the respiratory and nervous systems, liver, and kidney organ functions.36 Currently, most of the raw materials used in the production of PSCs are on the list of hazardous substances of various environmental agencies. Therefore, future research is necessary to reduce the toxicity of PSCs, while maintaining their efficiency.
The pursuit of low-toxicity PSCs has increased in the past few years. Accordingly, ion substitution,37,38 physical reduction in the content of lead,39 and the introduction of various low-toxicity solvents have been reported as meaningful attempts to achieve “green” PSCs.40 However, the performance of low-toxicity modules is still lagging behind their toxic counterparts. Therefore, identifying the trade-off between efficiency and toxicity is critical for developing sustainable PSCs.41–43 Here, we firstly discuss the potential toxicity of perovskite components in their production and the corresponding solutions. Then, we present visual graphical models of toxicity and efficiency based on multiple data processing comparisons to further explain the trade-off between toxicity and efficiency. Finally, an outlook on future green PSC technologies is presented to provide researchers with a systematic understanding of sustainable PSCs.
2. PSC toxicity analysis
2.1 Is lead replaceable?
Unlike the various options for the A-site in ABX3-type OIHP, most state-of-art PSCs employ Pb as the B-site. As a heavy metal element with a well-recognized threat to society, lead is much more hazardous than the A-site cation in PSCs.44,45 Exposure to lead in the air or water poses a wide range of acute and chronic poisoning risks to humans. Lead contamination can affect the genetic makeup, produce neurotoxicity, cause fetal toxicity during pregnancy or lactation, and harm the renal, hematopoietic, and immune systems.46,47 Children under five years of age and pregnant women are more vulnerable to lead attack. Lead ion accumulation can damage the neuron system of children, especially those whose blood–brain barrier has not fully developed.48 Low blood lead levels can cause intelligence quotient loss in children, and pregnant women may suffer from miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or malformation. In addition, chronic exposure to lead can also cause an increased risk of cancer.48 Hence, lead is classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Due to these adverse effects, regulations have been widely applied to constrain the usage of lead in products in daily life. EU Directive 2002/95/EC, “Restriction of Hazardous Substances”, ensures that “new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market does not contain lead, mercury, cadmium…”.
It was proposed in 2011 that an exception could be made for PV modules when the lead cycle can be secured.49 However, the unstable perovskite layer in PSCs is prone to decomposition, generating lead compounds. Furthermore, even under suitable encapsulation, PSCs will suffer from inevitably lead leakage due to accidental breakage.50 Simultaneously, the Ksp of lead is 29 magnitudes higher than that of the previous generation of environmentally controversial solar cells, e.g., CdTe, indicating that it is easier to dissolve in water, thus polluting the ecosystem.51 In short, the significant concern with lead-containing perovskites severely constrains the commercialization of PSCs.52,53
Accordingly, the ideal solution will be to replace lead, while maintaining the considerable efficiency of PSCs. Researchers suggested that the lead ions in perovskite can be substituted by equivalent elements or low/high dimensional heterovalent elements (Fig. 2a).54 For bivalent substitution, IVA elements, transition metal elements, and alkaline earth metal elements are applicable candidates (Fig. 2b).55 However, many of these candidates possess unsuitable band structures, such as localized band edges, deep states, and too large bandgaps.44 M. R. Filip et al. selected 25 compounds from 248 candidates to study the potential for B-site replacement based on two concurrent criteria, i.e., the stability of the compound in the perovskite structure and its bandgap.56 Among the other choices, Cd and Hg were not considered due to their toxicity. Additionally, Ga, In, V, and Ge are costly without exhibiting a superior performance. It is worth mentioning that AMgI3 is predicted to have a suitable bandgap (0.9–1.7 eV) and a low electron-effective mass, which may be a promising candidate to replace Pb. The power conversion efficiencies of the devices based on other heterovalent substitution elements, including Bi and Sb, are less than 3%, which are far below the satisfactory standard.57–59

Sn is the most favourable element among the candidates. The ionic radii of Sn and Pb are close (Sn: 1.35 Å and Pb: 1.49 Å), indicating that their substitution would not induce significant perturbations in the lattice structure. Sn-substituted perovskite has a high optical absorption coefficient and a theoretical tunable optimum bandgap in the range of 1.1 eV to 1.4 eV by varying the Sn content (Fig. 3a).60 According to the Shockley–Queisser limit theory, PSCs can reach the maximum efficiency of 33.7% by applying tin-based OIHP with a bandgap of 1.34 eV.61–64 The evolution of the PCEs of lead- and Sn-based PSCs in the last six years is compared in Fig. 3b. In 2014, N. K. Noel et al. achieved a PCE of 6.4% with MASnI3, showing a VOC of 0.8 V, which is close to its theoretical limit.65 Around the same time, F. Hao et al. used MASnI3 to obtain a PCE of 5.73%.66 These were the early attempts to develop tin-based PSCs. In 2015, FASnI3-based lead-free PSCs with a PCE of 2.1% were fabricated by T. M. Koh et al. The mesoporous TiO2 substrate was doped with 20% SnF2.67 Two years later, K. P. Marshall et al. demonstrated an all-inorganic CsSnI3 PSC with a PCE of 3.56%.63 Recently, X. Liu et al. obtained highly crystalline FASnI3 films preferentially oriented along the (100) plane by surface treatment of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI), reaching an impressive certified PCE of 11.22% and high stability of over 95% of the initial efficiency was maintained under 1000 hours maximum power point (MPP) tracking.68

However, Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ when exposed to air, limiting the long-term stability of tin-based PSCs.66 This oxidization destroys the charge neutrality and structural stability of the perovskite structure.69 The resultant Sn4+ acts as a p-type dopant to induce severe self-doping and make the material metallic.70 Furthermore, although tin is less toxic than lead, it is also a threat to the environment and human health.71 Short-term tin ingestion can cause ataxia, muscle weakness, and irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, which may lead to vomiting and diarrhoea. Chronic exposure to tin can induce a mineral imbalance and dysfunction of the kidney and liver.71 Also, the reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential of tin are still under debate.71–73 It is noteworthy that in the life cycle assessment (LCA) category, tin-based PSCs may be more hazardous because of their lower efficiency, suggesting that considerably more solar modules are required for the power supply, which can cause severe pollution.74 There is still room for improvement in the efficiency of Sn-PSCs. The present study demonstrated that the better crystallinity of Sn-based perovskite films leads to improved PCEs and device stability.75 The introduction of reducing agents and large organic cations in the precursor solution can significantly improve the thin film crystalline quality, and thus the device performance.75 In addition, the use of additives and development of new interfacial materials can also further improve the PCE and device stability.76 Therefore, we believe that the efficiency of Sn-PSCs can be improved stepwise. However, currently, ion substitution of Pb is still an immature solution, which results in PSCs with much lower efficiencies and is problematic in terms of toxicity and cost.
Besides ion replacement, a physical reduction in the amount of lead used is another strategy to weigh efficiency and toxicity. Specifically, employing thinner perovskite films to replace the original quasi-μm films, while absorbing most of the photons. The device PCE can maintain 96% of the original maximum value due to the significant absorption coefficient, while attenuating the perovskite film thickness to one-third. The reduction in film thickness can minimize the content of lead proportionally.39 In addition, ultra-thin layers of perovskite can stack with flexible substrates and ultra-thin electrodes, paving the way for their broad application, e.g., translucent windows and flexible PSCs.53,77
Compared with the more mature photovoltaic technology, i.e., crystalline silicon solar cells, Pb-PSCs are not entirely disadvantageous according to the environmental impact data obtained from the LCA analysis. Taking Pb-PSCs with an efficiency level of 15% as an example, the ecotoxicity of PSCs is about three-times higher than that of crystalline silicon solar cells per generation of the same power.78 However, the cumulative energy demand and global warming potential index of PSCs are about one-seventh that of crystalline silicon.79 This shows that although Pb-PSCs are slightly more toxic than mature technologies, they have considerable advantages in energy consumption and mitigation of global warming.
Considering that lead is still critical in achieving high efficiency and superior stability in PSCs, alternative solutions to reduce environmental pollution should reduce the exposed lead.
By using self-healable epoxy resin, cation-exchange resin, and lead-adsorbing ion gel for encapsulation, the leakage rate of lead under extreme conditions can be significantly reduced.80,81 The application of weakly acidic cation exchange resin or thiol-functionalized 2D conjugated metal–organic framework as a layer to absorb lead can capture the lead in discarded modules.32,82,83 These methods to solve the lead pollution problem can improve the feasibility of the large-scale implementation of perovskite photovoltaic technology.
Meanwhile, the industrial treatment for lead contamination has been well established. Various strategies have been developed specifically to treat lead ions in different situations. They can be categorized into physical, chemical, and biological treatments (Fig. 3c).84 For instance, soil contamination by lead can be addressed via physical remediation through soil replacement, isolation, and thermal treatment;85–87 chemical remediation through stabilization, vitrification, soil flushing, and electro-kinetics;87,88 and biological remediation methods that take advantage of the inherent capture characteristics of organisms (plants, bacteria, fungi, and algae).89 In particular, bioremediation is an eco-friendly and cost-effective method, which occupies a vital link in the ecological cycle. In the case of lead contamination in water, precipitation methods,90 coagulation–flocculation,91 ionic exchange,92–94 adsorption,95 and membrane separation96 are usually applied.97
With the lead management techniques at the device level and developed industrial contamination treatment to minimize lead hazards, we believe that PSCs have promising potential as a clean, renewable energy source when the lead contamination concerns are addressed.
2.2 The solvents for bio-friendly approach
Another significant advantage of PSCs compared with other PV technologies is their solution-process capability with high efficacy in terms of time and cost. Generally, the perovskite precursor is dissolved in a polar non-protonic solvent and deposited to form polycrystalline films by thermal annealing.98–100 However, most of the solvents used to prepare PSCs are poisonous to humans, thus imposing restrictions on the commercialization of PSCs. In this section, we present a comprehensive assessment of the solvents in terms of the balance between efficiency and toxicity towards more sustainable PSCs.
The toxicity of these polar non-protonic solvents for perovskites can impact their industrial application, which could be found on the European Chemical Agency (ECHA)'s list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC).101,102 Government agencies require the progressive replacement of SVHC with less hazardous substances or technologies, while ensuring that technically and economically feasible alternatives are available.103 Therefore, PSCs require relatively less toxic solvents to reach maturity.
To search for the most promising solvents for the production of green PSCs, we screened ten commonly used solvents for their preparation. These solvents have been frequently explored in PSCs, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),104 γ-butyrolactone (GBL),105N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC),106 tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrimidin-2-one (DMPU),107 poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl),α-hydro-ω-hydroxy-ethane-1,2-diol,ethoxylated (PEG),108 acetonitrile (ACN),109 isopropyl alcohol (IPA),110 2-methoxy ethanol (2-ME),111 ethanol,112 and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).113 Some of these reagents are used as primary solvents, while others are mixed with DMF as additives. These solvents were analyzed in terms of toxicity to the ecosystem and humans. Solvent toxicity to humans can be divided into workers and general population hazards. The toxicity data were obtained from ECHA Registered Substances Factsheets, as listed in the ESI.†
The categories for the assessment of eco-toxicity include fresh water, marine water, sediment, soil, sewage treatment plant micro-organisms (STP), air, and predators, which are reflected in the value by the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC).114 The PNEC is the concentration of a substance in any environment below which adverse effects are unlikely to occur during long-term or short-term exposure. In the environmental risk assessment, PNECs will be compared to the actual or predicted environmental concentration (PEC) to determine if the risk of a substance is acceptable or not (e.g., if PEC/PNECs < 1, the risk is acceptable). Notably, marine water pollution has the characteristics of sensitive response, slow process, and difficulty in tracking and management. The PNEC is selected as the representative parameter of eco-toxicity. DMF is marked as “no hazard identified” in the data provided by the ECHA. DMSO, ACN, ethanol, IPA, PEG, and 2-ME appear to be ecologically low-hazard solvents according to the data. Note that it is difficult for the concentration of a solvent in the ecosystem to reach a significant value. There are many high PNEC values. Also, human toxicity involves acute or long-term inhalation/oral/dermal effects.
Similarly, is the solvents can be evaluated using the derived no-effect level (DNEL).115 The DNEL is defined as the level of chemical exposure above which humans should not be exposed. The minimum DNEL of a substance is used as a representative parameter of human toxicity. Considering that industrial workers and ordinary people have different exposure environments, the data are given separately. Usually, industrial workers will have more chances to contact toxic solvents than civilians, resulting in a higher DNEL. From the viewpoint of the DNEL of workers, the most applied high-efficiency solvents such as DMF, 2-ME, DMPU, and NMP perform disastrously. The DNEL of the general population is similar to that of workers, except it is an order of magnitude smaller. The ECHA describes the general population DNEL for GBL as “hazard unknown but no further hazard information necessary as no exposure expected”, and thus no specific data of GBL is given herein.
The practicality of different solvents is mainly reflected in their ability to dissolve perovskite materials and the PCE of the final device. The ability of perovskite solvents to dissolve the precursor substances is often described by the Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) and donor number (DN). The HSP model can reveal the degree-of-similarity of two solvents.116 The HSP of DMF is set to 0 in this work, and then the HSP value of other solvents is the Hansen distance (HD) at this time. A solvent with a small HD is more likely to dissolve the perovskite solutes. However, OIHPs are composed of organic and inorganic ions, and the interaction between inorganic ions and solvents, such as solvation and adduct formation, is not considered in the HSP model. Due to ionicity, the HSP model alone cannot comprehensively assess the solvent, where the DN needs to be introduced. The DN value is defined as the negative enthalpy of a 1:1 adduct formed by the Lewis base and standard Lewis acid SbCl5 (antimony pentachloride) in a dilute solution of 1,2-dichloroethane, a non-coordinating solvent with a DN value of zero. The DN value can measure the ability of a solvent to dissolve cations.117 When the HD is constant, the larger the DN value, the stronger the ability to dissolve the perovskite, which tends to produce better quality devices with lower solvent consumption.118
In general, perovskites are extremely soluble in the current high-efficiency solvents (DMF, DMSO, 2-ME). Alternatively, green solvents tend to be less efficient because of the challenges in dissolving perovskites. However, this does not mean that green solvents have no potential for further development. By mixing solvents and changing the nanostructure of the precursors and material preparation methods, it is possible to overcome this issue.119–121 As shown in Fig. 4, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the solvents through the comparison of their properties, including eco-toxicity factor (ECOF), workers hazard factor (WHF), general population hazard factor (GPHF), DN, and PCE. Intuitively, the larger the area enclosed by the data processing, the better the solvent. We divided the solvents into four categories (most widely used, high industry potential, low industry potential, and high toxicity) according to their performance. DMSO, ethanol, IPA are considered to have great potential for application due to their ultra-low toxicity and excellent solubility, and thus they deserve further research. Graphically, DMSO may be the best solvent for the large-scale production of PSCs, although past studies have shown that if DMSO is used as the only solvent, the performance of PSCs is not yet known due to its excessive membrane permeability.122,123

(c) Solvent five-dimensional property map, in which fuller means higher commercialization potential. The solvents are N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrimidin-2-one (DMPU), poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl),α-hydro-ω-hydroxy-ethane-1,2-diol,ethoxylated (PEG), acetonitrile (ACN), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), 2-methoxy ethanol (2-ME), ethanol, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). 
Although the application of green solvents may slightly restrict the PCE, efforts to reduce the toxicity of the preparation solvents are ongoing, and a compromise between efficiency and toxicity can be achieved through process advances in the foreseeable future. Mixed solvents or additive-based solvents provide additional control over the deposition process, reduce the hazardous levels, and are known as “green solvents” to some extent.123–126 It is worth noting that the choice of non-“polar non-protonic solvent” can reduce the cause of toxicity, which is also a possible future innovation direction.127
2.3 The comparison of A-site materials
The PV performance of PSCs is highly associated with the selection of the A-site materials. In the general ABX3 OIHP, the bandgap can be easily modulated by performing A-position cation engineering, in which larger organic or inorganic cations are used for substitution.128 The rule of tolerance factor has been proposed to maintain the stable crystalline phase.128,129 Among the commonly used monovalent cations, MA+, FA+, and Cs+ are available to form photovoltaic cubic phases.42 MA+ is the most comprehensively studied A-site cation, which can be traced back to 1978. In 2009, the first attempt to use MAPbI3 as an inorganic sensitizer to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells was reported.1 Since then, various preparation methods, such as sequential deposition,99 solvent engineering,130 vapour-assisted deposition,100 additive-assisted deposition,131,132 and vacuum evaporation have been explored,133 leading to a device PCE of over 20%.134,135 Compared with MA+, FA+ is introduced to elevate the thermal stability and achieve a narrower bandgap, which provides a broader light absorption spectrum.136–139 Since 2015, FA cations have assumed an increasingly prominent role in the application of high-efficiency PSCs. However, FAPbI3 will undergo a phase transition from the black α-phase to the photo inactive yellow δ-phase below a temperature of 150 °C, thus restricting the device stability.140 Fortunately, the phase stability can be well improved by the combination of ammonium salt during the film preparation process, resulting in the achievement of a PCE of over 25.5%.141 However, although high PCEs have been obtained, the problem of poor thermal stability still needs to be solved. In this case, all-inorganic Cs-based PSCs has attracted wide attention. Without containing organic ingredients, CsPbX3 can remain low degradability at temperatures above 400 °C,142 maintain good light stability even under UV radiation,143 and exhibit excellent resistance to moisture.144 Recently, all-inorganic PSCs with Cs+ as the A-site cation have been reported with a considerable efficiency of over 19%.145 It is worth mentioning that alkali elements, including Na+, K+, and Rb+, as highly potential cationic additives, play a crucial role in enhancing the PCE, in which improved crystalline growth and reduced trap centres are obtained.146,147 Na+ and K+ are essential macroelements in the human body. Rb+ is mainly distributed in the liver, muscles, and bones.148 It is chemically similar to potassium and is generally considered nontoxic. These alkali elements are usually micro-doped, which probably will not introduce external toxicity in PSCs.
Although the toxicity of A-site materials is much less concerning than that of lead, their use in large quantities may still pose a threat to the ecosystem. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the toxicity of different ingredients and substitute them with eco-friendlier ones. Generally, the toxicity assessment of PSC modules is based on the LCA method, which uses the “cradle-to-grave” approach to analyze the toxicity levels to humans and the environment in a holistic manner.149–151 MAX (X refers to halogen) is generally prepared via ice-bath treatment with an anhydrous ethanol solution of MA and an aqueous solution of HX, followed by evaporation and washing for recrystallization.119,152–155 The synthesis of FAX is similar to that of MAX, while CsI requires a more complex synthetic approach.137 Recently, S. A. Khalifa et al. used the LCA method to review these cations, i.e., MA+, FA+, and Cs+.120 It was shown that the hazards of using mixed A-site cations on an industrial scale under the LCA model are similar to that using only MA+.
According to the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and USEtox model data (Fig. 5a and b), in terms of climate change, MA, which has the highest value of cumulative energy demand (CED) and climate change (CC) measured by carbon dioxide, is the most environmentally hazardous. FA+ is the most toxic A-site cation for humans in a comprehensive view. Here, it needs to be recognized that the high toxicity of a material to humans does not mean that it has a high risk of causing cancer. Although FA+ is more harmful to the human body, its carcinogenic toxicity values are much lower than that of MA+ and Cs+ (Fig. 5b). Compared to its B-site and X-site counterparts, the toxicity of the A-site is lower. Therefore, we can draw the preliminary conclusion that the choice of the A-site cations should mainly focus on efficiency and stability, considering their relatively lower toxicity to humans and the environment. When a specific component of perovskites can achieve the commercial threshold, more detailed and adequate LCA studies and process improvements should be developed to meet the legal and regulatory requirements for commercial mass production as soon as possible.

2.4 Halogen hazards and handling
Unlike perovskite cations, it is inevitable to use halogens in the X-site position. Halogens with different compositions of substances can produce various hazards to the human body. In the case of perovskites, the halogens will typically be in the form of organic halides, which are the most prominent environmental pollutants to be addressed in the commercialization of perovskites.156 The term “adsorbable organic halogen (AOX)” has been introduced for the fast determination of total organic halogens. AOX is defined as the sum of all halogenated organic compounds available for adsorption on activated carbon.121 AOX has been shown or suspected to be a carcinogen that exhibits cytotoxic and genotoxic properties.157–159 Moreover, AOX can bioaccumulate in the food chain or spread over long distances through water bodies (runoff, evaporation, and rainfall), and thus toxic reactions can occur in humans without direct contact. Consequently, stringent AOX emission policies have been implemented worldwide.157 Treatment options for AOX-containing waters are now relatively mature (Fig. 5c). Pseudohalide derivative additives are also used in PSCs to enhance their PCE and processing efficiency.160–162 These additives are usually thiocyanate, a toxic substance that is slightly less toxic than cyanide but more difficult to degrade.163 Thus, due to environmental and health concerns, caution is required with the use of AOX.
3. Conclusion and perspective
This review presented a comprehensive understanding of sustainable PSCs by exploring the trade-off between their toxicity and efficiency. Briefly, the following conclusions were derived.
Firstly, given that lead is the primary source of toxicity in perovskites, it has been frequently debated whether PSCs can be applied as green PV technology for the sustainable development of society. Ideally, the toxicity of lead can be resolved by element substitution. However, currently, ion substitution of Pb (Sn, the best thus far) is still immature, resulting in PSCs with a much lower efficiency or poor stability. Alternatively, developing lead management and the well-established industrial treatment for lead contamination can minimize the hazards associated with lead.
Secondly, the large amount of toxic solvent employed in the preparation of films should be considered for the commercialization of PSCs. We compared five parameters, i.e., solvents, including ECOF, WHF, GPHF, PCE, and DN, to explore the most promising solvent for the production of green PSCs. We found that DMSO is the optimal choice for the preparation of perovskites in the current stage. Simultaneously, it may be substituted by IPA or ethanol to significantly improve its solubility by applying solvent mixing. These eco-friendly solvents can alleviate environmental stress, especially in the large-scale industrial fabrication of PSCs.
Lastly, a comprehensive analysis of the cations and halogens of perovskites was provided. For the cation, MA+, FA+, and Cs+ all negatively impact humans or the environment. However, their toxicity is less prominent compared with the toxicity of lead or solvents. Therefore, the investigation of cations should focus on their benefits to the device PCE and stability. Similar to the cations, the toxicity of halogen elements should be less of a concern, where the use of halogen is inevitable in PSCs. Furthermore, the treatment of halogen waste has been well established in industry.
According to the above-mentioned conclusions, we may derive some potential mitigation strategies to reduce the hazardous potential of PSCs, as follows: (a) applying macroelement additive strategy to optimize the device performance, thus controlling the hazards, while improving the PCE. (b) Exploring green solvent methods not only in the preparation step but also in the recycling processing. (c) Investigating a built-in resin layer to realize the dual function of device encapsulation and lead leakage prevention.
It is worth noting the toxicity to both humans and the environment will influence the commercial application of PSCs. This is not just a scientific question but a complex legal and political one. Accordingly, researchers should not only pursue high efficiency or non-toxicity but realize a trade-off and find a balance between them within an acceptable limit.
