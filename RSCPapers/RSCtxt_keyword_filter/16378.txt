Upon application to TiO2-based solar cells, the effects of different acceptors on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes and the solar cell performance are detailed. The introduction of a pyridinium unit or 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-indolium unit into the molecular frame as the acceptor instead of cyano acrylic acid can effectively cause a red shift in the absorption spectra. Applied to DSSCs, the devices sensitized by CM502 with the pyridinium unit as the acceptor show the highest efficiency of 7.3%. The devices fabricated with dye CM501 with cyano acrylic acid as the acceptor exhibited the highest Voc while for the devices sensitized by the dye CM503 with 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium unit as the acceptor, the Voc value was the lowest, at 494 mV. The addition of TBP in the electrolyte can improve the performance of DSSCs fabricated using CM501 and CM502, with the Voc value greatly improved but the Jsc value slightly decreased. However, with the addition of TBP in the electrolyte, the efficiency of the cells sensitized by CM503 dropped significantly (from 4.9% to 1.0% when 0.1 M TBP was added).IntroductionConverting solar energy into electricity is generally considered to be the most promising way to solve the energy crisis. A variety of light-harvesting devices have been developed in recent years including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 which have attracted increasing attention. As potential candidates for the future modality of photovoltaic cells, DSSCs manifest considerable efficiency and low cost, in which the sensitizer is deemed to be the crucial component. At present, DSSC sensitizers based on Ru(II)-poly-pyridyl complexes have achieved power conversion efficiencies of almost 12% at standard global air mass AM 1.5G.2,3 However, the large scale application of Ru complexes has become a critical problem due to limited resources and the cumbersome purification steps needed. In recent years, the interest in organic dyes as substitutes of noble metal complexes has been increasing because of their many advantages, such as large molar extinction coefficient, simple synthesis, low cost, and facile molecular design.4 Recently, many studies have focused on molecular engineering of chromophores to attain the capability of panchromatic light harvesting. Varieties of organic dyes, such as coumarin,5–7 indoline,8,9 cyanine,10,11 phenothiazine,12–16 tetrahydroquinoline,17–19 cabazole,20,21 [bis-(dimethylfluorenyl)-amino]phenyl,22–25 and triphenylamine,26–33 have been reported, thus making organic dyes fruitful in their application to DSSCs. Impressive photovoltaic performances have been obtained by using organic dyes that show efficiencies exceeding 10%.34,35The organic dyes are commonly constructed using donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) configurations due to the effective photo-induced intermolecular charge-transfer property. As reported, different electron-donating ability of the donor part, the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor part, and the conjugation length of the π-bridge could lead to diverse positions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, thus resulting in different driving forces for electron injection and tuning of the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). To enrich the research field of sensitizers for DSSCs and gain more information on the structure–property relationships, we synthesized three new phenothiazine dyes (CM501–CM503, see Fig. 1) utilizing the same donor unit but a range of acceptors. Finally, the three sensitizers were applied to the sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2-based solar cells, and the effects of the acceptor on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes and the solar cell performance are detailed. Fig. 1  Structures of sensitizers CM501, CM502 and CM503. Result and discussionAbsorption properties in solution and on TiO2 filmsThe UV/Vis absorption spectra in dichloromethane and upon adsorbtion onto transparent TiO2 films of the three dyes CM501–CM503 are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, compared with the dye CM501, whose absorption peak is located at 477 nm, the introduction of a pyridinium unit or 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium unit into the molecular frame as the acceptor instead of cyano acrylic acid can red shift the absorption peak by 31 nm and 202 nm (Fig. 2a), respectively. We believe that such a distinct red shift is caused by an increased strength of the acceptor and increased conjugation length of the molecular frame considering the similar structure of these dyes. Consequently, adjusting the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor and the conjugation length of the molecular frame can efficiently decrease the band gap thus resulting in a broader responsive wavelength region and higher light-harvesting efficiency. Compared to the spectrum in CH2Cl2 solution, the absorption peaks for CM501–CM503 on transparent TiO2 films are all blue shifted (see Table 1). Generally, when sensitizers are anchored onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, they have a strong tendency to aggregate in solution or at the solid–liquid interface due to a strong attractive force between the molecules. Dye aggregates usually have three forms: red shifted J-aggregates, blue shifted H-aggregates, and both red and blue shifted herringbone aggregates. From the above, all of the dyes have strong H-aggregates. In particular, CM503 has much stronger aggregation than the other two dyes. It is noteworthy that the absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed onto transparent TiO2 show a markedly broad profile, which is beneficial for light harvesting. Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of CM501–CM503 measured (a) in CH2Cl2 and (b) adsorbed onto transparent TiO2 films.

The examined ES+/S and ES+/S* levels are collected in Table 1. The Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated by using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the ground-state oxidation potential corresponding to the HOMO levels are 0.85, 0.88 and 0.92 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The band gap energies (E0–0) of these three dyes were 2.21, 2.02 and 1.62 V, which were estimated from the absorption thresholds from absorption spectra on TiO2 film. The estimated excited-state potential, calculated from ES+/S −E0–0, are −1.36, −1.14 and −0.70 V, respectively. Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammetry plots of CM501–CM503 measured in CH2Cl2 with TBAPF6 (0.1 M) as the electrolyte. From these data, we found that the HOMO levels of the dyes are much more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE),36 thus, indicating that the oxidized dyes, formed after electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, could accept electrons from I− thermodynamically (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4  Experimental energy-level diagrams of the HOMO and LUMO for CM501–CM503 and TiO2vs. NHE. The conduction-band-edge energy level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode is approximately −0.5 V vs. NHE36 while a substantial charge rearrangement takes place upon dye or 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) adsorption onto the semiconductor surface. This charge redistribution can cause significant modifications of the TiO2 electronic structure, with likely consequences on the conduction band (CB) energetics.37 A pure electrostatic (EL) contribution, due primarily to the dye dipole, can also alter the TiO2 CB energy.35 Thus we tested the CB of TiO2 sensitized by these three dyes CM501–CM503 with different electrolytes (see Experiment section). The test results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5  Evolution of cell capacitance as a function of photo-voltage for films with different sensitizers or electrolyte: (a) the TiO2 film sensitized by dyes CM501–CM503 with electrolyte A; (b) the TiO2 film sensitized by dyes CM501 with different electrolyte A, B and C; (c) the TiO2 film sensitized by dyes CM502 with different electrolyte A, B and C; (d) the TiO2 film sensitized by dyes CM503 with different electrolyte A, B and C. Using electrolyte A without the addition of TBP, the TiO2 sensitized by dye CM501 exhibits the most negative CB (−0.62 V vs. NHE, see Fig. 5a), while the CB of TiO2 sensitized by dyes CM502 and CM503 are about −0.58 V and −0.39 V vs. NHE, respectively. The LUMO levels of these dyes are considerably more negative than the CB of the TiO2 electrode, which implies that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is energetically permitted when TBP is not employed in the electrolyte.36 With the addition of TBP to the electrolyte, the CB of TiO2 films sensitized by these dyes are all negatively shifted. For the film sensitized by CM501 and CM502, the CB is about −0.70 V and −0.68 V vs. NHE (see Fig. 5b and c), respectively, with electrolyte C containing 0.4 M TBP. The energy gaps between the LUMO levels of CM501 and CM502 and CB of TiO2 are still large enough, providing the possibility of electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 with the addition of 0.4 M TBP to the electrolyte.36 However for the film sensitized by CM503, with the electrolyte B containing 0.1 M TBP, the CB of TiO2 changes considerably, about −0.63 V vs. NHE. The excited dye can inject electrons into the CB of TiO2 but the efficiency is much lower.36 When electrolyte C containing 0.4 M TBP is employed, the CB of TiO2 (about −0.69 V vs. NHE) is nearly the same as the LUMO of CM503, correspondingly, the excited dye cannot inject electrons into the CB of TiO2.Calculation studyTo gain better insight into the electronic properties of these dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The electron distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs of dyes CM501–CM503 are shown in Table 2. The electron density of the HOMOs of CM501, CM502 and CM503 are primarily located at the donor part, whereas those of the LUMOs are delocalized over the acceptors. The electron density on the anchoring group also suggests that excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO levels can move the electron distribution from the donor unit to the acceptor anchoring moiety to realize electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The oscillator strength values of these three dyes are 0.775, 0.812 and 0.688, respectively, which are much stronger than that of the commonly used Ru-complex (such as N719, N3 and Z907).

DYEHOMOLUMOCM501CM502CM503Photophysical propertiesFig. 6 shows the spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs based on these three dyes. The solar cells sensitized by CM501 show a good response to the solar spectrum in the range of 300–650 nm, with high IPCE values nearly 90% in the range of 440–540 nm and with a highest value of 89.7% at 480 nm when electrolyte A without TBP was employed (see Fig. 6a). The addition of TBP decreases the IPCE values slightly (see Fig. 6b). Similar results were also obtained for the sensitizer CM502. When CM502 with pyridinium as the acceptor is employed as the sensitizer, the devices exhibit a much broader response to the solar spectrum compared with that of CM501, and high IPCE values of nearly 90% in the range of 440–580 nm when electrolyte A is employed (see Fig. 6a). Very differently from CM501 and CM502, when using electrolytes without TBP, the devices sensitized by CM503 exhibited a much lower IPCE in 300–500 nm but showed a much higher response to the near infrared region. With the addition of TBP to the electrolyte, the IPCE values of the devices sensitized by CM503 dropped significantly. Solar cells based on CM501 and CM502 exhibit higher IPCE values than that of CM503 when the same electrolyte was employed. These results can be ascribed to the more negative LUMO energy levels of CM501 and CM502 leading to higher electron-injection efficiency. The threshold wavelengths of the IPCE spectra for all of the dyes are consistent with the absorption spectra when dyes were adsorbed onto TiO2 films. Fig. 6  The spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs based on CM501–CM503: (a) the IPCE of DSSCs sensitized by dyes CM501–CM503 with electrolyte A; (b) the IPCE of DSSCs sensitized by dyes CM501 with different electrolyte A, B and C; (c) the IPCE of DSSCs sensitized by dyes CM502 with different electrolyte A, B and C; (d) the IPCE of DSSCs sensitized by dyes CM503 with different electrolytes A and B. Fig. 7 and Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs fabricated with these dyes (CM501–CM503 and N719) as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5G solar light conditions. The detailed parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 3.

For the devices sensitized by CM501, CM502 and N719, addition of TBP has beneficial effects on the overall cell performances. For CM501, with the addition of 0.1 M TBP, the Voc value increases greatly, from 664 mV to 709 mV, but the Jsc value decreases by 0.75 mA m−2; correspondingly the η value increased to 5.8%. For CM502, with the addition of 0.1 M TBP, the Voc and η values of the devices improved by 53 mV and 0.2%, respectively. Similar results were also obtained for N719. With addition of 0.1 M TBP to the electrolyte, the efficiency improves to 7.2%. As opposed to CM501, CM502 and N719, in devices sensitized by CM503, the addition of TBP improves the Voc but the Jsc is greatly reduced; correspondingly, much a lower efficiency of 1.0% was attained. Upon increasing the concentration of TBP (0.4 M), in the devices sensitized by CM501 and CM502 greatly improved efficiencies of 6.4% and 7.3% were achieved, respectively, while for the devices sensitized by CM503, the efficiency dropped to almost 0%. This is mainly because the addition of TBP and absorption of dyes on TiO2 films makes the CB of the TiO2 much more negative, and therefore the electron cannot be injected into the CB of TiO2 efficiently. Under the same conditions, for dyes CM501 and CM502, a little higher or similar Voc can be achieved, compared with N719. However, the Jsc is much lower, which can be mainly attributed to the narrower response to the solar spectrum. For CM503, both the Voc and Jsc values are lower than those of N719.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopyIn addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also was employed to study the electron recombination and electrolyte reduction process in DSSCs based on these dyes CM501–CM503 and electrolyte A under a −0.80 V bias applied voltage under dark conditions. The Nyquist and Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 8. Some important parameters can be obtained by fitting the EIS spectra to an electrochemical model. RS, Rrec and RCE represent the series resistances, charge-transfer resistances at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and counter electrode (CE), respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 4. The Rrec obtained by EIS is in the order CM503 < CM502 < CM501 (see Fig. 8b). This trend is in accordance with the current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs stated above. The dye CM503 with 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium as the acceptor exhibits the lowest Rrec value of 27.8 ohm among these dyes, corresponding to the lowest Voc. Rrec of the CM501 dye is 41.8 ohm which is the highest among these dyes. These results suggest that different acceptor groups indeed have large impacts on the electron recombination between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte. The RS and RCE are similar for devices sensitized by these three dyes; correspondingly, a similar FF was obtained. The RCE values obtained using EIS for the devices sensitized by these three dyes are around 5 ohm, indicating that the redox couple regenerates efficiently on the counter electrode (Table 4).

These dyes were synthesized by the stepwise synthetic protocol, showed in the ESI.†1H NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN INOVA 400 MHz spectrometer (USA) using TMS as the standard. MS data were obtained with GCT CA156 (UK), HP1100 LC/MSD (USA), and LC/Q-TOF MS (UK). The absorption spectra were recorded on HP8453 (USA). Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on an electrochemistry workstation (BAS100B, USA). The working electrode was a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode; the auxiliary electrode was a Pt wire; and Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile (AN). The ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal potential reference. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (PARSTAT 2273, USA) under dark conditions, with forward bias −0.80 V. The DSSCs sensitized by CM501–CM503 were fabricated according to previous literature with modifications. A layer of 2 μm TiO2 (13 nm paste, Heptachroma, China) was coated onto the F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (TEC15, 15 Ω per square, Pilkington, USA) by screen printing and then dried for 5 min at 125 °C. This procedure was repeated 5 times (10 μm) and finally a layer (4 μm) of TiO2 paste (DHS-SLP1, Heptachroma, China) was coated as the scattering layer. The double-layer TiO2 electrodes (area: 6 × 6 mm) were heated under an air flow at 520 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The sintered film was further treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed with water, and annealed at 520 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to room temperature, it was immersed into a 2 × 10−4 M dye bath. The electrode was then rinsed with EtOH and dried. The hermetically sealed cells were fabricated by assembling the dye-loaded film as the working electrode and Pt-coated conducting glass as the counter electrode separated by a hot-melt Surlyn 1702 film (25 μm, Dupont). The light source for the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurement was an AM 1.5G solar simulator (16S-002, Solar Light Co. Ltd., USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to provide a working area of 0.12 cm2 and antireflection films were employed during the test. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method using an electrochemical workstation (LK9805, Lanlike Co. Ltd., China). The measurement of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed on a Hypermono-light (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd., Japan). Mott–Schotty curves were obtained by with an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (PARSTAT 2273, USA) under dark conditions with different I−/I3− based electrolytes (electrolyte A: 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazoleiodide (DMPII), 0.25 M LiI, 0.01 M I2 in AN; electrolyte B: 0.6 M DMPII, 0.25 M LiI, 0.01 M I2 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in AN; electrolyte C: 0.6 M DMPII, 0.06 M LiI, 0.04 M I2, 0.4 M TBP in AN). The working electrode was a dye-sensitized TiO2 film; the auxiliary electrode was a Pt wire; and Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode.ConclusionsIn summary, we have synthesized three new phenothiazine dyes using the same donor unit but different acceptors. The introduction of a pyridinium unit or a 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium unit into the molecular framework as acceptors instead of cyano acrylic acid can effectively red shift the absorption. When applied to DSSCs, the devices sensitized by CM502 with the pyridinium unit as the acceptor yielded the highest efficiency of 7.3%. The devices sensitized by dye CM501 with cyano acrylic acid as the acceptor exhibited the highest Voc while for the devices sensitized by the dye CM503 using the 5-carboxy-1-hexyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium unit as the acceptor, the Voc value was lowest, at 494 mV. The addition of TBP in the electrolyte could improve the performance of DSSCs fabricated with CM501 and CM502, with the Voc value greatly improved but the Jsc value slightly decreased. However, with the addition of TBP in the electrolyte, the efficiency of the cells sensitized by CM503 dropped greatly. This is mainly because the energy gap between the LUMO of CM503 and the CB of TiO2 is too small to inject electrons into the CB of TiO2. Thus the acceptor has considerable effects on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes and the solar cell performance.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support of this work from the China Natural Science Foundation (Grant 21076039, Grant 21276044, Grant 21120102036 and 20923006), the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2009CB220009), the Swedish Energy Agency, K&A Wallenberg Foundation, and the State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals (KF0805), the Program for Innovative Research Team of Liaoning Province (Grant No. LS2010042).Notes and referencesB.
