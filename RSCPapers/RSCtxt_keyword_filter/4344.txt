    , Accepted 15th August 2016First published on 26th August 2016AbstractCubic CuFeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) have been obtained via a facile colloidal chemistry approach and they show remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with CuFeS2 NCs as counter electrodes (CEs) display a power conversion efficiency of 8.10% comparable to that of a cell with Pt as the CE (7.74%) under the same conditions.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as one of the most promising alternatives to traditional solar cells, have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effective fabrication and relatively high device performance in the past two decades.1 Recent advances in designing of dyes and electrolytes have improved the power conversion efficiency of cells up to 13%, where the records of high efficiency were achieved by modification of the dyes2 and a cobalt redox couple in acetonitrile electrolyte solution.3 A typical DSSC comprises three main components: a dye-sensitized porous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) film as the photo-anode, an electrolyte traditionally containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple and a counter electrode (CE). The CE plays two key roles in a typical DSSC device: regeneration of I− from I3− in the shuttle reaction via electrocatalytic reduction and collection of the electrons from the external circuit. Thus good CE materials should exhibit high catalytic activity toward the counter electrode reduction reaction and display good conductivity. Currently, noble metal Pt is the most useful CE in DSSCs due to its superior conductivity, electrocatalytic activity and stability, while its low natural abundance and high cost have been major concerns. Moreover, Pt can be dissolved in iodic electrolyte solution and decomposed into PtI4 and H2PtI6 in the long term.4 Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore low-cost and abundant materials to replace Pt as CEs of DSSCs for future large-scale fabrication. So far, several kinds of new materials have been proposed, such as conductive organic polymers,5 inorganic oxides,6 sulfides,7 selenides,8 carbon materials,9 metal nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanotubes,10 and graphene composite materials.11 Recently, colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) have also been employed as CEs for DSSCs, such as FeSe2,12 SnS2,13 Ag–Ag8SnS6,14 CuInS2–ZnS,15 and Cu2ZnSnS4.16 Nevertheless, up to now the performance of the DSSCs with NCs as CEs has not been satisfactory, and it is usually inferior to that using Pt as the CE.12,13,16 Hence, it remains a challenge in seeking a NC-based CE material with excellent performance for further development of the DSSCs.
Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), a naturally occurring mineral, has a small band gap of 0.5–0.6 eV,17 and is also antiferromagnetic with a relatively high Néel temperature of 550 °C,18 resulting in potential applications such as optoelectronic devices and magnetic materials. It has recently been studied as a thermoelectric material,19 and a cathode for lithium ion batteries.20 However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unclear whether CuFeS2 materials exhibit enough electrocatalytic activity to be used as alternative CEs for DSSCs. In this work, we have prepared cubic CuFeS2 colloidal NCs obtained via a facile solution-phase route and further assessed their applicability as CEs of DSSCs for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the synthesized CuFeS2 NCs exhibit quantum confinement effects and display high electrocatalytic activity in the counter electrode reduction reaction (I3− to I−) and good electrochemical stability. Moreover, the DSSC device yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE or η) of 8.10% for the CuFeS2 CE, which is comparable to the control device made of a Pt CE (with a PCE of 7.74%), demonstrating great application promise in developing low-cost and high efficiency DSSCs. Full experimental details can be found in the ESI.†

Fig. 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized CuFeS2 NCs. The sample displays a narrow distribution with average size of 6.15 nm (inset of Fig. 1a). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1b) shows that all diffraction peaks can be well indexed to cubic-structured CuFeS2 (JCPDS No. 41-1404). No impurity peaks were observed, confirming the high purity of the NCs. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1c) indicates that CuFeS2 NCs are highly crystalline with continuous lattice fringes across the NC. Moreover, an interplanar crystal spacing of 0.305 nm matches well with d111 of cubic CuFeS2. Additionally, the polycrystalline selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 1d) of the NCs show clearly three diffraction rings that match well with the (111), (220), and (311) lattice planes of cubic CuFeS2, which are in line with the XRD results. The elemental composition of the as-prepared CuFeS2 NCs was analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S1, ESI†), disclosing that the molar ratio of Cu/Fe/S is 1.00/0.83/1.96, which is very close to the stoichiometric ratio of 1/1/2. Therefore, we have obtained the cubic CuFeS2 NCs with narrow size distribution and high crystallinity. The detailed influences of different sulfur sources and surfactants on the morphologies of CuFeS2 NCs are given in the ESI† (Fig. S2–S4).

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of CuFeS2 NCs was acquired to study their optical properties and to determine their band gap. A clear solution of the CuFeS2 NC sample shows a continuous absorption spectrum spanning the whole visible spectrum (shown in Fig. S5a, ESI†). Tauc plots (Fig. S5b, ESI†) were obtained to assess the optical band gaps with the relationship of (αhν)2 and (αhν)1/2versus energy (hν), revealing that CuFeS2 NCs exhibit a direct band gap of 1.9 eV and an indirect band gap of 1.1 eV, which are much bigger than those of the bulk materials (0.5–0.6 eV).17 These results indicate that the as-synthesized CuFeS2 NCs should exhibit quantum confinement effects; similar results have recently been achieved in size tunable CuFeS2 NCs.21
To examine the electrocatalytic activities, which is critically important for improving the solar cell performance,22 of the CuFeS2 (sprayed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass) and Pt CEs toward the reduction of I3− in the I−/I3− redox shuttle of the DSSCs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was firstly performed in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 2a. Both electrodes exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks (Ox-A/Red-A, Ox-B/Red-B). The Ox-A/Red-A in the CV plots is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, whereas the Ox-B/Red-B is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I3−/I2. Because of the left pair of peaks in the C–V curves is closely correlated with the catalytic ability of a CE of DSSCs in the reduction of I3− to I−, and a further study was focused on it. The peak current density can reflect the catalytic activity of a CE, and larger current density leads to higher catalytic activity.23 Moreover, the peak separation between anodic and cathodic peaks (Epp) is a very useful parameter for assessing the catalytic activity of a CE,8a and there is a negative correlation between Epp and the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction. The ca. 104 mV Epp of the CuFeS2 CE is significantly smaller than the ca. 149 mV Epp of the Pt electrode (Table S1, ESI†), which is directly responsible for the lower overpotential loss of the CuFeS2 CE than the Pt CE in DSSCs. The higher peak current densities and lower Epp values (Fig. 2a) indicate that the CuFeS2 electrode presents a high catalytic activity in the reduction of I3−, which is a paramount prerequisite for an excellent CE in DSSCs. Moreover, the JOx-A/|JRed-A| ratio is an important parameter to evaluate the reversibility of the I−/I3− redox reaction.24 The value for the CuFeS2 CE is 0.96, which is much more close to 1.00 than that of the sputtered Pt CE (1.09) (Table S1, ESI†), indicating that the I3− to I− redox reaction on the CuFeS2 CE is more reversible. This higher reversibility implies rapid conversion of I3− to I− species for dye recovery, which is expected to show better photovoltaic performances in DSSCs.

We have further compared the CV at different scanning rates for the CuFeS2 and Pt electrodes (shown in Fig. S6, ESI†) to extract the relationship between the scanning rates and the peak current densities of Ox-A/Red-A (Fig. 2b). The peak current densities increase with an increase of the scanning rates, showing a linear relationship between the peak current densities and the square root of the scanning rates. According to the Langmuir isotherm principle, such a linear relationship indicates that the cathodic and anodic reactions are diffusion limited for transportation of iodide species toward the CE in the cells.25 This is because of the fact that, as the scanning rate increases, the diffusion layer becomes thinner and the electrochemical polarization becomes larger, thus leading to a high overpotential and poor reversibility.26
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) represents the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. We performed EIS using symmetrical cells consisting of two identical CEs and investigated the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The obtained Nyquist plots of the two electrodes are presented in Fig. 2c. The high frequency intercept on the real axis corresponds to the series resistance (RS) of the cell, while the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE) can be revealed by the left semicircle in the high-frequency range. Additionally, the right semicircle in the low-frequency range reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple transport in the electrolyte. Typically, Rct is regarded as an indicator to reveal the charge transfer process and thereby evaluate the catalytic activity of catalysts. A small Rct facilitates the electron transfer from the CE to electrolyte for catalytic reduction of I3− and consequently results in less interfacial recombination, whereas a larger Rct indicates a sluggish electron transfer and often leads to a lower JSC of DSSCs. The Nyquist plots for the two CEs were fitted using the Z-view software with an equivalent circuit diagram (inset of Fig. 2c), producing the EIS parameters shown in Table S1, ESI.† The CuFeS2 CE shows a very similar Rs value to the Pt CE due to the addition of small amounts of carbon black, hence posing a similar influence on the photovoltaic performance. The Rct of CuFeS2 is 0.39 Ω cm2, much smaller than 1.44 Ω cm2 for the Pt CE (Table S1, ESI†), indicating the CuFeS2 electrode is more efficient than the sputtered Pt electrode in terms of catalytic I3− at the CE/electrolyte interface. Effective reduction of I3− to I− could promote the dye-regeneration at the photoanode, resulting in an improvement of photocurrent density (JSC). There were two possible reasons for the significantly reduced impedance of the CuFeS2 CE. Firstly, the addition of trace carbon black would play a vital role in improving the conductivity. Secondly, the electrical contact between the transparent conducting film and the CE was improved via thermal treatment under an inert atmosphere, which has been proven to be an effective strategy for promoting the efficiency.27
Tafel polarization was employed to further elucidate the catalytic activity of a CE for DSSCs. Fig. 2d shows Tafel curves of symmetrical cells based on CuFeS2 and Pt CEs, respectively. Both anodic and cathodic branches show larger slopes for the CuFeS2 electrode than the Pt electrode, suggesting higher exchange current density (J0) generated from the CuFeS2 electrode. This is in line with the EIS values in terms of eqn (1), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. (1) (2)Fig. 2d further shows very similar limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) values for the two electrodes of CuFeS2 and Pt, indicative of very similar diffusion coefficients in the symmetrical cells according to eqn (2), where D is the diffusion coefficient, l is the distance between the electrodes in a dummy cell, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the I3− concentration.
Taking the above results into consideration, including EIS, CV and Tafel polarization, the CuFeS2 catalyst displays high catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−, which is even better than the sputtered Pt electrode that is currently the mostly used high performance CE material in DSSCs.
The electrochemical stability of a CE is an important parameter that affects the potential application in DSSCs. To assess the electrochemical stability of the CuFeS2 CE, two symmetrical cells consisting of CuFeS2 and sputtered Pt electrodes, respectively, were subjected to EIS testing. Changes in Rct were negligible for both CuFeS2 and Pt CEs after 10 cycles of scanning, showing superior electrochemical stability (Fig. S7, ESI†). We have also measured sequential CV for 150 cycles for both CEs (Fig. S8, ESI†). The current densities and the Epp don't alter obviously, indicating that the CuFeS2 CE exhibits comparable electrochemical stability with Pt.
The excellent catalytic activity in the redox reaction of I−/I3− and the high electrochemical stability of the CuFeS2 composite make it a potentially suitable candidate for use as CEs for DSSCs. We have hence assembled the DSSC devices with CuFeS2 and sputtered Pt as CEs to assess their performance under the same conditions (see the Experimental section in the ESI†). Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of both devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The CuFeS2 based device displays a slightly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.10% (with a VOC of 665 mV, a JSC of 17.34 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 70.34%) than that of the Pt based device (with a VOC of 662 mV, a JSC of 16.69 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 70.01%). It can be seen that the improvement of PCE mainly results from the increase of JSC, which can be attributed to the fast photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface, low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I3−, high diffusion coefficient of I3− and rapid interconversion between I3− and I−.

In summary, we have presented a facile colloidal synthesis of cubic CuFeS2 NCs with uniform size distribution and high crystallinity. The NCs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in the reduction reaction of the I−/I3− redox shuttle in DSSCs. The device consisting of a CuFeS2 CE demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.10%, which is comparable to the control device using sputtered Pt as the CE (7.74%). These results may pave the way for further studying environmentally friendly, stable, economical and highly efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs.
We are grateful for the measurement of HR-TEM and the helpful discussions with Dr Shu Miao.
