    , Accepted 6th March 2017First published on 7th March 2017AbstractCuprous oxide (Cu2O) is expected to be one of the most promising materials for utilizing solar energy. One strategy comprises using Cu2O as a photocathode to obtain hydrogen by the reduction of water. However, the instability of Cu2O in solution hinders its employment to a great extent. Here, we fabricated a multilayer photocathode with the structure of Cu2O/Ga2O3/AZO/TiO2 by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. The highest photocurrent density was increased to 6.5 mA cm−2 in comparison to 4.5 mA cm−2 for bare Cu2O at 0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the stability was also improved to some extent. The properties of Ga2O3 were affected to a great extent by the oxygen pressure, which thereby changed the photovoltage and stability of the photocathode. Alignment of band energies is introduced to explain this phenomenon. In a sample containing Ga2O3 under a low oxygen pressure, the relatively lower Fermi level and conduction band edge in the Ga2O3 layer formed a region of electron accumulation near the interface, which impaired its performance. In addition, the interfacial chemical state of copper element was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with Ar ion etching. It was revealed that for both samples Cu+ was reduced to Cu0 during the fabrication process near the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface, which is harmful for stability. These factors resulted in the relatively unstable performance of the photocathode. This work reveals the performance of a multilayer photocathode grown by PLD and points out possible ways of improving it.
Introduction
In recent years, the consumption of conventional energy sources has increased greatly. Considering that these energy materials are running out, researchers are trying to find new strategies for utilizing renewable energies such as solar energy.1,2 Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) techniques have attracted more attention as promising strategies for generating and storing this clean and renewable form of energy.3–7 In contrast to solar cells, PEC techniques convert solar energy directly into chemical fuels such as hydrogen, which is more environmentally friendly than traditional energy sources such as coal and oil.8
An interface between a semiconductor-based photoanode or photocathode and an electrolyte is usually required to establish a PEC water splitting system. Over recent years, considerable research has been undertaken into photoanode materials for PEC applications, such as n-type semiconductors (TiO2,9 CdS, BiVO4,10 ZnO,11 Fe2O3,12etc.) and their composites. However, much less attention was focused on p-type photocathode materials. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is an abundant, cheap, environmentally friendly and natural p-type semiconductor material with a direct band gap of 2.0 eV, which can be used as a photocathode, and has a corresponding theoretical solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 18%.13–15 Furthermore, the position of its conduction band edge at about −1.2 V vs. RHE makes Cu2O an excellent candidate for water reduction.16,17
However, the main challenge preventing its use as an efficient and durable photocathode for water splitting is its instability in aqueous solution.18,19 From the band diagram of Cu2O, the redox potentials of monovalent copper oxide lie within its band gap. In this case, photocorrosion of the material in the electrolyte occurs instead of water splitting reactions.15 To address this problem, a suitable n-type semiconductor protective layer with a favorable energy band position is coated on bare Cu2O to form a p–n junction. On the one hand, it helps photogenerated electrons to migrate from Cu2O to the n-type semiconductor/electrolyte interface. On the other hand, the overlayers will protect the Cu2O from photocorrosion. A TiO2 layer has been reported to be an excellent n-type protective layer.
The use of Ga2O3, which is an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap, as a buffer layer has been reported to generate a high photovoltage both in a heterojunction solar cell device and in a photocathode.20–22 In these works, the overlayers were usually deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Even though ALD is a scalable layer-by-layer synthesis process that can produce uniform and ultrathin films,23 its slow growth rate restricts its employment to a great extent. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a normal technique for the deposition of thin films. High-energy atoms ablated from the target are deposited on the substrate to form a film, which makes PLD an easily controlled technique for obtaining high-quality films. In this work, we fabricated a photocathode with the structure of Cu2O/Ga2O3/AZO/TiO2 by PLD. The ultrathin Ga2O3 film introduced as a buffer layer was expected to achieve a better matched band alignment and a high photovoltage. The PEC performance and the band diagram were studied in this work.
Experimental
Electrochemical deposition of cuprous oxide
The substrate used for electrodeposition was gold-coated quartz glass. The quartz glass had dimensions of 2 × 2 cm and was cleaned ultrasonically with acetone (20 min), ethanol (20 min) and deionized water (20 min) sequentially. Then, 15 nm chromium (Cr) was deposited on the quartz substrate by e-beam evaporation, followed by 120 nm gold (Au). The parameters used for electrodeposition were the same as in our previously reported work.24 A basic solution of lactate-stabilized copper sulfate electrolyte was prepared using 0.2 M (M = mol L−1) CuSO4·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 M lactic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 M K2HPO4 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) in deionized water. The solution was prepared with deionized water (18.3 MΩ cm) purified by a Direct-Q UV system (Millipore), and the pH was adjusted to approximately 12 with a 2 M aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent). All reagent-grade chemicals were used as received without further purification, and the solution was filtered and stirred thoroughly. Cu2O was deposited using a potentiostatic method in a three-electrode system with the Au-coated glass as the working electrode, a platinum (Pt) plate as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl as the reference electrode. Electrodeposition was carried out at −0.4 V referenced to an Ag/AgCl electrode using a potentiostat/galvanostat (WonATech, WPG100), and the temperature was maintained at 40 °C using a water bath. The thickness of the Cu2O film was controlled by changing the charge passed through the electrode. The Cu2O film was rinsed with deionized water and dried by a nitrogen flow in air.
Pulsed laser deposition of Ga2O3, AZO and TiO2
The Cu2O-coated substrate was transferred to the chamber of a PLD system for the subsequent deposition of Ga2O3, AZO and TiO2 layers. The PLD system was equipped with a KrF excimer laser (wavelength, 248 nm; repetition rate, 5 Hz; pulse width, 20 ns; power, 300 mJ per pulse). The targets were sintered Ga2O3, Al-doped ZnO (2.54% Al by atom) and TiO2, all of which were produced by ZhongNuo Advanced Material (Beijing) Technology Co., Limited. The deposition process was carried out with the following deposition parameters: target-substrate distance, 50 mm; deposition temperature, room temperature or 150 °C. The basic vacuum was below 9.0 × 10−4 Pa and the working oxygen pressures used for AZO and TiO2 were 0.2 Pa and 1 Pa, respectively. For Ga2O3, we changed the oxygen pressure from 0 to 10 Pa. In this procedure, a portion of the substrate was masked with Kapton tape, which ensured that the overlayers were deposited in a certain area.
Co-catalyst deposition
For PEC measurements, a Pt catalyst was used. Platinum nanoparticles were deposited as the catalyst layer for 30 s by an E-1030 ion sputterer with a Pt target. The thickness of the Pt layer was about 2 nm.
Materials characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the crystal phase of the samples. The optical properties of the films were characterized with an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-vis, Shimadzu 3600). Cross-sectional elemental analysis was performed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). To prepare the cross-sectional sample for TEM, the as-grown sample was handled with a focused ion beam (FIB). The chemical state of the sample was determined by XPS and the depth profile of the chemical state was recorded by XPS in combination with Ar ion etching.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements and applications were conducted in a three-electrode PEC cell using an Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from an Xe lamp (Perfectlight) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated with an optical power and energy meter (Thorlabs PM100D). The electrolyte solution comprised 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M KH2PO4 and the pH was about 5.0. For IPCE measurements, we used the same instrument. The difference was that we used monochromatic irradiation using the Xe lamp equipment with bandpass filters (central wavelengths of 350 nm, 380 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm and 550 nm; band width of 20 nm). Then, the IPCE was calculated using the following equation: IPCE% = [J (mA cm−2) × 1240]/[P (mW cm−2) × l (nm)] × 100. In electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, a bare Cu2O sample was tested in a 0.1 M KOH solution with a pH of 13. The sample was scanned at an AC amplitude of 10 mV with a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 100 mHz, and the scanned potential ranged from 0.6 V/RHE to 0.4 V/RHE. For the multijunction photocathode, Nyquist plots were recorded in a solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M KH2PO4 from 0 V/RHE to 0.5 V/RHE. All potentials were referenced to the RHE by the following equation: V vs. RHE = V vs. Ag/AgCl + 0.059 V × pH + 0.1976 V.19,25
The procedure of fabricating the Cu2O/Ga2O3/AZO/TiO2 photocathode is depicted in Fig. 1. The Cu2O film was electrodeposited by a potentiostatic method. Then, we deposited the overlayers, namely, Ga2O3, AZO, and TiO2, by the PLD technique. The deposition parameters of Ga2O3 and TiO2 were optimized, including the oxygen pressure, the deposition temperature and the thickness. AZO and TiO2 acted as an n-type layer and a protective layer, respectively, in our photocathode.

Results and discussion
Properties of Cu2O film and the overlayers coated by PLD
The surface morphologies of the bare Cu2O film and Cu2O film with overlayers are depicted in Fig. 2. The Cu2O grains displayed a predominant (111) orientation with exposed {100} facets. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed to determine the flat band potential Efb and the hole concentration NA in the near-surface region. Detailed information is provided in the ESI.† From the linear fit of 1/C2versus E shown in Fig. S1,† the values of Efb and NA were estimated to be about +0.82 V/RHE and 2.95 × 1017 cm−3, respectively, which were in agreement with previous results.16,26 The overlayers were deposited on the Cu2O surface uniformly. A cross-sectional SEM image of the multilayers is shown in Fig. 2(c). The thickness of Cu2O varied from 600 nm to 1200 nm and that of the overlayers was approximately 60 nm. The deposition speed of each overlayer will be calculated accurately from the cross-sectional TEM image. We tried to characterize the crystal phase of the overlayers from the XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The dominant peaks corresponded to Cu2O and Au, respectively. However, unfortunately, there were no peaks corresponding to Ga2O3, AZO or TiO2 shown in the pattern. This may be attributed to the ultralow thickness of each layer and the poor crystal quality. The crystal structure will be further confirmed by TEM analysis.

A cross-sectional TEM image is shown in Fig. 3. The oxygen pressure used for the deposition of Ga2O3 was 10 Pa for this sample. What should be noted here is that this sample was only used for analyzing the crystal structure and calculating the deposition speeds of the overlayers from the thickness of each layer. For the photocathode used for PEC measurements, the thickness will be optimized. From Fig. 3(a), even though the surface of Cu2O was serrated, the upper overlayers were attached to the surface uniformly and tightly. The thicknesses of the overlayers at different positions were almost the same. This was of vital importance, because the uniform coating of overlayers enabled the formation of an effective p–n junction for electron transport and effective protection for the Cu2O layer against corrosion in solution. In the magnified TEM image shown in Fig. 3(b), it is clear that the TiO2 layer was amorphous and the AZO layer exhibited a polycrystalline morphology. For the Ga2O3 layer, we found not only crystalline clusters but also amorphous clusters. From the TEM analysis, the thicknesses of TiO2, AZO and Ga2O3 were 20 nm, 12 nm and 24 nm, respectively. We determined the deposition speeds of each layer, namely, 0.023 nm per pulse for TiO2, 0.04 nm per pulse for AZO and 0.08 nm per pulse for Ga2O3. Elemental mapping of the cross-sectional sample revealed homogeneous deposition of the oxide layers, as shown in Fig. 4.

Effect of thickness of Cu2O absorber
Firstly, we studied the effect of the thickness of the Cu2O absorber layer on the PEC performance. As reported in the previous literature, the light penetration depth in Cu2O is about 2.2 μm at λ = 600 nm and 1.0 μm at λ = 550 nm, which is near the band edge where absorption is weakest.16 However, the carrier mobility in electrodeposited Cu2O film is usually less than 5 cm2 V−1 s−1,16,27 and the charge carrier collection length L can be calculated by eqn (1): (1)where k, T, e, μ, and τ are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, elementary charge, mobility and charge carrier lifetime, respectively. The electron diffusion length is reported to be between 25 and 60 nm (ref. 16) and 160 nm by application of the Gärtner model.28 The incompatible length scales of the light penetration depth and the charge carrier collection length mean that longer-wavelength photons absorbed deep within the film cannot be collected.14,29 In this work, three Cu2O samples with different thicknesses, namely, 600 nm, 900 nm and 1200 nm, which were controlled by the charge passed through the electrode, were applied to the photocathode. The thicknesses of Ga2O3, AZO and TiO2 were fixed at 10, 20 and 20 nm, respectively, and all overlayers were deposited by PLD at room temperature. The oxygen pressure used for depositing Ga2O3 was 1 Pa. As shown in Fig. 5(a), we compared the PEC performance of photocathodes with different thicknesses of Cu2O. The Cu2O/Ga2O3/AZO/TiO2 photocathode with the 600 nm Cu2O layer displayed a photocurrent density of about 8.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V/RHE. As the thickness increased to 900 nm, the photocurrent density peaked at 10 mA cm−2 but, however, declined sharply to lower than the former value as the bias increased, which meant that the photovoltage was lower. The lowest photocurrent density of about 5 mA cm−2 at 0 V/RHE was observed in the photocathode with 1200 nm Cu2O. On comparison, we concluded that even though a thicker Cu2O film was essential for absorbing light, some of the photogenerated carriers did not contribute to the photocurrent in the 1200 nm Cu2O electrode. Instead, a greater thickness of Cu2O increased the resistance of the photocathode, which thereby reduced the photocurrent at the same time. Considering both the photocurrent and photovoltage, we fixed the thickness of the Cu2O layer at 600 nm in the following experiment.

Effect of thickness and deposition temperature of TiO2
An amorphous TiO2 layer is considered to have poor electron transfer properties. Therefore, a thicker TiO2 layer is expected to have a higher resistance, which thereby reduces the photocurrent. It has been reported that a thicker TiO2 layer deposited by ALD using titanium tetraisopropoxide and water as the ALD precursors reduced the photocurrent. However, after switching to using tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) as the precursor, this phenomenon disappeared.30 We can conclude that the effect of the TiO2 layer is heavily dependent on the growth method employed. The effect of the thickness of TiO2 grown by PLD should be studied. We compared two samples with TiO2 layers of 20 nm and 40 nm, respectively, and kept the other parameters unchanged. From Fig. 5(b), the sample with 40 nm TiO2 displayed a slightly lower photocurrent density than that with 20 nm TiO2, which reached about 7.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V/RHE. Moreover, the photocurrent density in the sample with the thicker TiO2 layer decreased more slowly than that in the sample with the thinner layer as the bias increased, which increased the photovoltage. We believe that this was because a better p–n junction was formed with a thicker TiO2 film.
Another factor that we studied was the deposition temperature. As shown in the TEM image, the TiO2 layer was in an amorphous state. A higher growth temperature is beneficial for the crystal quality, which thereby improves electron transfer. A TiO2 layer deposited at a significantly higher temperature by ALD gave rise to an enhancement in photocathode performance.20 However, it seems that the use of a higher deposition temperature in a PLD system will reduce the photocurrent to a great extent. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the photocurrent displayed an apparent decrease as the deposition temperature rose. Moreover, the photocathode deposited at a temperature of 150 °C was more unstable than that deposited at room temperature. The photocurrent density decreased to about 3 mA cm−2 after measurement for 400 s at 0 V versus RHE. On the whole, the growth of overlayers at 150 °C not only slightly reduced the maximum photocurrent but also greatly decreased the photocurrent stability. A similar result was also found in our previous study of a solar cell.24
Effect of oxygen pressure used for deposition of Ga2O3
Unfortunately, we did not observe the expected increase in the photovoltage in these samples in comparison with the samples without a Ga2O3 layer. We therefore tried to change the deposition parameters of the Ga2O3 layer, which is an essential layer for achieving a higher photovoltage. As shown in Fig. 5(c), we compared the photocurrents in photocathodes produced using different oxygen pressures for the deposition of Ga2O3. As we increased the oxygen pressure from 1 Pa to 10 Pa, higher photovoltages and fill factors were apparently obtained. The wavelength-dependent IPCE is shown in Fig. S2.† Furthermore, the stabilities of these two photocathodes were tested, as shown in Fig. 5(d). For the former sample, the photocurrent decreased rapidly and corrosion could be clearly observed from a change in the colour of the surface. For the latter sample, we also found a decrease in the photocurrent; however, the photocurrent almost recovered to its initial value after clearing the bubbles (shown in Fig. S3†) that formed on the surface after measurement for 400 s. The photocurrent in the former sample was unrecoverable owing to corrosion. It was noticeable that the photocurrent at 0 V/RHE for Ga2O3 deposited at 10 Pa was slightly lower than that for Ga2O3 deposited at 1 Pa. We believe that the increase in the photocurrent may be partly attributed to the reduction of Cu+ in the Cu2O layer, but the reduction of H+ at the photocathode/electrolyte interface explains the poor stability performance. Further study of the interface by XPS will support our hypothesis. We compared the photocurrent in the bare Cu2O and multilayer photocathodes without Ga2O3 and their photocurrent stability (Fig. S4†). The bare Cu2O electrode was very unstable and its surface colour became dark rapidly during the PEC test, which is consistent with a previous report.15 The electrode without a Ga2O3 layer exhibited similar performance to that with Ga2O3 deposited at 1 Pa. Even though the multilayer structure improved its stability to some extent, this electrode was less stable than those in other reports with similar structures fabricated by ALD.20,21 We hypothesized that this was largely related to the growth method. Further experiments will be conducted to explain this.
Electrical impedance analysis of the photocathode
For the multijunction photocathode, we measured its electrical impedance properties from 0 V/RHE to 0.5 V/RHE under illumination. The Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. S5(a).† The plot apparently displayed two semicircles, which are typical features of a p–n junction and a semiconductor/electrolyte interface. For the semicircles in the high-frequency region, the radius hardly changed as the applied bias changed, which was regarded as corresponding to the p–n junction. The radius of the semicircle in the low-frequency region increased as the applied bias increased, which reflected the reduction of H+ at the interface. The reduction of H+ at the interface was difficult to achieve at a positive bias. The black curves are fitting plots obtained using the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. S5(a),† which are in good agreement with the experimental data and thus confirm the suitability of the equivalent circuit model. The formation of the p–n junction was also confirmed by the Mott–Schottky plots shown in Fig. S5(b).† A V-shaped MS plot was obtained. Similar phenomena were observed for a photocathode in the literature.31 On comparing the slopes of the MS plot in the p-type and n-type regions, we can also conclude that the doping levels of the p-type and n-type layers were different.
Study of the interface between Ga2O3 and Cu2O
It seems that the properties of Ga2O3 changed to a great extent owing to the oxygen pressure used for deposition. Firstly, the optical properties of Ga2O3 films deposited on quartz glass at different oxygen pressures were measured by UV-vis spectroscopy and are shown in Fig. S6.† The band gap (Eg) of Ga2O3 was determined from transmittance data to vary from 3.4 eV to 4.69 eV as the oxygen pressure changed, which were lower values than that of Ga2O3 deposited by ALD.22,32 For the samples deposited at 1 Pa and 10 Pa, we found that the band gaps were 4.07 eV and 4.69 eV, respectively, which were still much lower than those of Ga2O3 deposited by ALD. We believe that this was related to the stoichiometric ratio of Ga to O. Furthermore, the valence band edge positions were measured by XPS to be 2.54 eV and 3.27 eV for the Ga2O3 samples deposited at 1 Pa and 10 Pa, respectively (see Fig. S8†). This means that the Fermi level of the latter is much higher than that of the former, which will change the band alignment of the junction.
The band diagram of the Ga2O3/Cu2O interface represents an intuitive way of analyzing the carrier transfer path in the multilayer electrode. We determined the band alignment by XPS according to the method outlined by Waldrop et al.22,33–36 An as-grown Cu2O film was used to measure the positions of the Cu 2p peak and the valence band maximum (VBM), which were 932.49 eV and 0.39 eV, respectively (see Fig. S7†). Then, bulk Ga2O3 film was deposited on the Cu2O film to measure the positions of the Ga 2p peak and the VBM. The data from the sample with ultrathin Ga2O3 were used to determine the relative difference in energy between Cu 2p and Ga 2p (see Fig. S8† for detailed data). The detailed information is summarized in Table S1† and the calculation process is also described in the ESI.† From the XPS data, we illustrated the band energy alignment in Fig. 6. For the sample deposited at an oxygen pressure of 1 Pa, two obvious drawbacks in the band alignment were found. The first was that the offset in ECBM values between Cu2O and Ga2O3 was 0.64 eV, which was much larger than the expected and previously reported values. This is attributed to the relatively narrower band gap of Ga2O3. Another factor was that the  was only 2.54 eV. This means that the  was more positive than the  and the RHE potential. The band diagram before contact is depicted in Fig. 6(a). After the formation of the p–n junction, the band diagram for the multilayer electrode biased at 0 V/RHE is shown in Fig. 6(b). For the layer deposited at a low oxygen pressure, a downward bowing of the band occurred on the Ga2O3 side of the interface, which would create an electron accumulation layer at the interface. This is disadvantageous for the electron transfer process in the conduction band. However, for the sample deposited at an oxygen pressure of 10 Pa, on the one hand the band gap was wider. The offset between the CBM of Cu2O and Ga2O3 was reduced to 0.14 eV. Even though the CBM of Ga2O3 was still slightly lower than that of Cu2O, the electron accumulation phenomenon would be weak. On the other hand, the Fermi level was also raised and was close to the reversible hydrogen potential. The downward bowing of the conduction band of Ga2O3 would be alleviated, and migrated electrons would not accumulate in this region. This explains the higher photovoltage in the latter sample and the improvement, to some extent, in stability.

For clarity, the x-axes are not to scale. 
To learn more about the interface, we used XPS in combination with Ar ion etching to determine the depth profile of the chemical state. A Cu2O film with an ultrathin Ga2O3 layer (deposited at an oxygen pressure of 10 Pa) was studied. The sample was etched many times by Ar ions until the Ga signal was very weak, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The XPS data of Cu 2p and Cu LMM were recorded for each layer. These data revealed the change in the chemical state of Cu. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the main peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 hardly changed, whereas the satellite peak located at about 946 eV became more apparent as the etching time increased. The satellite peak is clear evidence that distinguishes Cu0 from Cu+. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the Cu LMM peak changed from 918.2 eV (Cu0) to 916.8 eV (Cu+), as shown in Fig. 7(c), which confirmed that the chemical state was not Cu0 but Cu+ at the interface. As a comparison, we analysed the XPS data for a bare Cu2O film (see Fig. S7†). By fitting the Cu 2p peak, we observed a weak peak corresponding to Cu2+, which is attributed to oxidation in the air environment. This illustrated that Cu0 found near the interface was produced during the deposition process, and this was also found in the sample deposited at an oxygen pressure of 1 Pa (Fig. S9†). Therefore, the change in the valence of Cu was not attributed to the oxygen pressure. There are few reports about the effect of the PLD process on the surface of the substrate. We tried to explain this phenomenon in terms of electron affinity. The electron affinity of copper is much higher than that of gallium.37 When high-energy Ga and O atoms ablated by the laser were deposited on the surface of Cu2O, the Cu, Ga and O atoms in an ultrathin region would form the compound with the lowest energy. Copper, which has relatively high electrophilicity, would preferably form Cu0.

On the basis of the above analysis, we derived an explanation for the distinctive performance of the photocathode. The formation of the p–n junction promoted the migration process of photogenerated electrons in the Cu2O layer, which thereby increased the photocurrent. However, on the one hand, Cu0 was formed during the deposition process, which would represent a defect and act as a recombination centre at the interface. On the other hand, the oxygen pressure used for the growth of Ga2O3 played a vital role in determining the band diagram and thereby increased the photovoltage. The bowing in the band gap of Ga2O3 (deposited at low oxygen pressure) would make electrons accumulate at the interface, where the electrons would preferably react with Cu2O. This reduction led to deactivation of the electrode and impaired the stability of the electrode to a great extent. In perspective, some strategies may be helpful for improving the performance of our device, such as: 1) growing Ga2O3 films with a larger band gap and raising the Fermi level by doping; and 2) protecting the Cu2O surface layer from reduction, for instance, by surface oxidation to give an ultrathin CuO layer or by surface passivation. More studies in these areas will be carried out in the future.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated a photocathode with the structure of Cu2O/Ga2O3/AZO/TiO2 using the PLD technique for the first time. The effect of factors such as the thickness of Cu2O and the thickness and deposition temperature of TiO2 on the PEC response was examined. Increases in photocurrent and photovoltage were obtained in our experiment. The stability of the photocathode was improved to some extent but still not sufficiently. The properties of the Ga2O3 layer, which were affected by the oxygen pressure, played a vital role in the improvement. The band diagram illustrated that the band bowing found in the CBM of Ga2O3 (deposited at low oxygen pressure) would cause electrons to accumulate, which hindered carrier transport and resulted in deactivation of the electrode. The use of a higher oxygen pressure for the deposition of Ga2O3 is necessary for better PEC performance. Analysis by XPS depth profiling revealed that Cu+ was reduced to Cu0 at the Cu2O/Ga2O3 interface, which hindered the migration of electrons. This work proposed possible explanations of the performance of this multilayer photocathode grown by PLD and pointed out possible strategies for improving it.
