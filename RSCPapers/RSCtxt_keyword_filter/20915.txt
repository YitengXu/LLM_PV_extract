    AbstractLead oxide nanocrystals are synthesised by injecting oxygen gas into an air and moisture free complex of Pb oleylamine and oleic acid in octadecene. Using various characterization methods including fabrication and testing of photovoltaic devices we explore the material properties and photovoltaic application of lead oxide nanocrystal films.
Semiconductor nanocrystals are promising candidates for low cost next-generation photovoltaic devices. They can be dispersed in solvents, combined with polymers and deposited on various substrates, at low temperatures to form dye-sensitized solar cells,1,2 hybrid nanocrystal–polymer composite solar cells,3–5 and all-inorganic nanocrystal solar cells.6,7 Such technologies are capable of providing processing, scale, and cost advantages when compared with conventional single crystal and thin film solar cells.4,8 The research and development of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) is increasingly focused towards the synthesis of semiconducting materials with band gap energies around 1.2–1.8 eV, utilizing earth-abundant elements and environmentally benign fabrication methods.9
Lead oxides have found a broad range of applications, ranging from batteries to paint, and it is well known that the lead to oxygen ratio determines the band gap and hence color, for example PbO is yellow, Pb3O4 is red and Pb12O19 is brown. There are a number of both theoretical and experimental studies of different forms of lead oxide which show interesting optical and electronic properties that point towards it being a very useful photovoltaic material.10–12 Furthermore, lead based NCs offer a reduction in toxicity compared with more commonly studied metal salts, such as cadmium.13
The fabrication of nanocrystal photovoltaic devices by substituting long chain coordinating surfactants used in the synthesis with a shorter more reactive molecule using a layer-by-layer dip coat deposition procedure is well established.14,15 This process allows for electronic connection to be established between the NCs within the thin film while retaining the nanocrystal's innate properties. The thin film deposition method also has a dramatic effect on the orientation and crystallographic order of the nanocrystal films allowing for the fabrication of devices that exhibit >2% spectrally corrected power conversion efficiencies.15
For this investigation, a 5 mmol, 1 ∶ 1 ratio of oleic acid and lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(CH3COO)2(H2O)3) crystals were placed in a three neck flask with 3 ml of octadecene. The reagents were degassed under a nitrogen flow and then heated to 150 °C for 1 hour whilst being continuously stirred, and into this 5 mmol of oleylamine was injected.
After mixing the reagents thoroughly, the temperature was rapidly increased to 190 °C at which point the nitrogen gas purge was halted and replaced with high purity oxygen gas. The color change from clear to yellow upon the injection of oxygen signified the start of the nucleation phase. This temperature was maintained for 5 minutes after which the solution was rapidly cooled in an ice bath to a temperature below which no noticeable nucleation had occurred (150 °C). This temperature was then maintained for 1 hour to allow for sufficient ageing of the nanoparticles.
Nanocrystals were isolated from the reaction solution by precipitating them using a 1 ∶ 1 ethyl-acetate ∶ methanol solution, this produced a light brown solid precipitate. The NCs were then weighed and dispersed in hexane to form a yellow/brown solution ready for characterization and device fabrication as detailed in ESI†.
Nanocrystal thin films were fabricated using the 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) based dip-coating of Luther et al.15 Thin monolayers of long ligand capped lead oxide NCs were deposited on patterned glass/ITO substrates (Delta Technologies Ltd) by dip coating them in a 7 mg ml−1 nanocrystal/hexane solution then replacing the long ligands with shorter dithiol molecules by dipping the films in a 0.01 M EDT in acetonitrile solution. This procedure transforms the NC surface from non-polar to polar allowing successive monolayer to be deposited from the non-polar NC suspension.15 To complete each device, three ∼70 nm aluminium electrodes were thermally deposited onto the exposed thin film surface through a shadow mask at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1 at a base pressure <10−6 Torr.
Transmission electron microscopy of as-prepared PbO nanocrystals (Fig. 1a) shows them to be well dispersed suggesting they are well passivated by oleylamine/oleic acid ligands. The diffraction spots of Fig. 1c correspond well (±2%) to XRD data published in the literature,16 representing an orthorhombic (Pcam) structure with lattice parameters: a = 5.4903 A, b = 5.8920 A, c = 4.7520 A. The indexed lattice planes of Fig. 1b also correlate well with calculated lattice spacings, which identified the two visible lattice planes to be (111) and (200) with a bisecting angle of 56.2°. The XRD analysis correlated very well (±1%) with the published values. The broadening of the peaks in Fig. 1e is typical of nanocrystal samples and is often caused by surface defects present in the crystal structure.17

(c) High resolution micrograph of a single NC with orthorhombic structure. (d) Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra of a nanocrystal/hexane solution. (e) XRD pattern of PbO NC powder. 
The nanocrystal hexane solution exhibits a broad optical absorption which extends to 700 nm as shown in Fig. 1e. Strong absorption below 500 nm is typical of β-PbO which has an indirect bandgap of 2.67 eV (∼465 nm) absorption above 500 nm attributed to polymorphic PbO impurities.18 Excited at 410 nm the suspension has a photoluminescense emission peak at 470 nm extending to 700 nm (Fig. 1d). Similar photoluminescence from bulk β-PbO crystallites has previously been reported.19 Quantum efficiency measurements were performed using a 10 inch diameter integrating sphere coupled to a Labsphere model CDS-600 CCD array spectrometer. A Thor labs mounted LED light source (465 nm) was used for excitation source. To calculate the quantum efficiency (QE) the photon flux in the absorbed spectrum (PA) and the photon flux in the emitted spectrum (PL) was found. The quantum efficiency value is obtained by dividing the photon flux in emitted spectrum by the photon flux in the absorbed spectrum. The quantum efficiency for PbO was found to be 2.5% ± 0.5%.
The NC films are bright yellow as shown in Fig. 2 while the SEM cross-section of the PbO–EDT thin film appears to have a granular structure; it is also possible to distinguish the individual layers of the thin film; appearing as laminar sheets. Using a Dektak profilometer the film thickness and roughness were measured to be linearly dependent on the number of dipping cycles and the amount of EDT used. The roughness was found to be less than 2% of the film's thickness value (see ESI†).

From the FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 we can determine the nature of the organic bonds present in the as deposited thin films. The peaks labeled at 2922 cm−1 and 2852 cm−1 in the PbO–oleic acid complex represent the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching of the C–H bonds along the alkyl chain of the oleic acid chain. Likewise the peaks at 1464 cm−1 and 722 cm−1 arise from the deformation and rocking vibration of the CH2 bond respectively. These peaks are characteristic of –(CH2)n– chains where n > 3. The peak observed at 2989 cm−1 is associated with the CH3 stretching vibration whereas the 1709 cm−1 peak is characteristic of the CO bond of the carboxylic acid.20–22 In addition to the peaks usually associated with oleic acid, a shoulder appears at 1544 cm−1 which may indicate the existence of a carboxylic acid salt. The continuing presence of the 1710 cm−1 band implies that only a proportion is electrostatically bonded as oleate on the PbO surface, and that free oleic acid appears to still be present in the nanocrystal sample.

After dip coating with 1,2-ethanedithiol the characteristic peaks of the oleic acid are replaced. This can be seen from the loss of the peak at 2989 cm−1 and the introduction of peaks at 1161 cm−1 and 1028 cm−1. These peaks are in a region of the spectra usually associated with sulfur–oxygen bonding.23 This coupled with the lack of a thiol S–H band at around 2600–2550 cm−1 indicates that the 1,2-ethanedithiol replaces the oleic acid and binds in a bidentate fashion on the surface of the PbO nanocrystals as has been previously suggested for the case of PbSe nanocrystals.22 Following that report,22 we suggest that the S–O bond could be the result from a bidentate configuration of EDT on the PbO surface or oxidation of the thiol.
The Schottky-type devices exhibit (Table 1) very small short circuit currents (JSC) and overall power conversion efficiencies (PCE) but have large open circuit voltages (VOC) compared to previously reported lead chalcogenide nanocrystal devices.15 We find that the fill factor (FF) of our devices is low and remains largely unchanged, this is most likely due to the poor film morphology at the aluminium metal contacts. The large VOC can be attributed to the large bandgap18 of β-PbO (2.67 eV) which allows for a Schottky barrier of upto 1.33 eV at a nanocrystal/metal interface. While the PCE and JSC we report are small compared to other lead chalcogenide NC photovoltaics,15 our devices are stable at ambient conditions and we observe little change in J–V characteristics over a period of 3 months. This and our ability to increase JSC, VOC and PCE by reducing the EDT concentration gives optimism that further device improvements via refinement of synthesis and processing methods are possible. The reason for the drop of VOC when using 0.01 M EDT is not clear yet and is a step change. The effect of EDT concentration on cell efficiency is related to film morphology and Dektak analysis of surface roughness (ESI†) reveals that films made with more dilute EDT solutions contains large holes. This disparity in film continuity most likely accounts for the difference in photo-current observed in these devices.

To conclude, oleic acid capped PbO nanocrystals have been fabricated using a one-pot, colloidal synthesis method. These lead oxide nanocrystals are easy to prepare, store and manipulate. A precipitation and purification methodology has been refined to allow for easy manipulation of the nanocrystals for characterization and solution processed thin-film devices.
