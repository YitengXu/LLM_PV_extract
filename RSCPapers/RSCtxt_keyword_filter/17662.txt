    , Accepted 21st December 2018First published on 21st December 2018AbstractAlthough the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has exceeded 23%, the poor ambient stability of organic–inorganic halide perovskites poses a challenge for their commercialization. Comprehensive understanding of the underlying degradation mechanisms is a crucial step to seek approaches that can effectively suppress the degradation of perovskites. Herein, on the basis of extensive first-principles calculations, a three-step photo-oxidative degradation mechanism of MAPbI3 at the atomic level is revealed. We find that, in a dry ambient environment, the photo-generated superoxide anions (O2−) first lead to fast surface oxidation. However, further oxidation of the perovskite interior is hindered by the solid oxidation product. The fresh water produced in surface oxidation leads to the hydration of the inner perovskite and eventual breakage of the MAPbI3 lattice. We devise a practical strategy for protecting MAPbI3 from photo-induced decomposition by anchoring hydrophobic 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine on the surface of MAPbI3. The surface modification significantly retards the photo-induced decomposition.
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, as one of the most promising thin-film solar cell materials, have attracted intensive attention in photovoltaic manufacturing.1–7 The remarkable photoelectric properties of perovskites, including tunable band gap, high extinction coefficient, and high carrier mobility,8–10 led to over 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE).11,12 However, the poor stability of perovskites under ambient conditions limits their practical applications severely.13–17 Numerous experiments have revealed that moisture is the key culprit in the degradation of hybrid perovskites, for example, MAPbI3. Meanwhile, hydrated perovskite phases, CH3NH3PbI3·H2O and (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O, have been observed during the initial hydration degradation process.18–22 Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that water molecules can spontaneously incorporate into the perovskite lattice and gradually corrode the whole perovskite structure.23,24
Recent studies showed that degradation caused by light and oxygen occurred more rapidly than moisture-induced degradation.25–30 When exposed to both light and dry air, MAPbI3 suffered from rapid decomposition.25,26 Calculations based on density functional theory suggested that PbO was the main photo-oxidation product rather than PbI2.27 The generation of PbO was later experimentally detected in degraded perovskites. However, PbI2 was still the dominant composition whereas PbO was present as a by-product in a minimal amount.28 So far, the degradation mechanism of hybrid perovskites under exposure to light and air remains unclear.
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the stability of perovskite materials and photovoltaic devices. Hydrophobic hole- or electron-transporting materials, such as polymers, Al2O3, NiOx and carbon materials, have been widely employed as protective layers by encapsulation methods to meliorate the stability of perovskite solar cells.31–33 Another strategy is to develop perovskite materials that have a two-dimensional layered structure by introducing large-sized hydrophobic molecules.34–36 More recently, through functionalizing the perovskite surface by “moisture resistive” passivation molecules, superior moisture stability and high power conversion efficiency have been simultaneously achieved under a relatively high humidity.37,38 Although these protection strategies are effective in suppressing the sensitivity of perovskites to moisture, approaches that can retard the photo-oxidation and hydration of perovskites have been little investigated.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding on the photo-oxidation mechanism of MAPbI3 under ambient conditions. Our calculations reveal that the photo-induced degradation process includes three key steps: generation of superoxide on the surface under light, fast oxidation of the MAPbI3 surface and production of water, and slow hydration of inner MAPbI3 (Fig. 1). A rational design of the protection strategy is devised from first-principles methods and is verified by stability tests from experiments. We show that modifying the surface of MAPbI3 with 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine (FPA) can suppress the photo-corrosion due to oxygen and water.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the photo-oxidative degradation process of the MAPbI3 (001) surface. Step I: the O2 close to the surface of MAPbI3 gets the photo-excited electrons from MAPbI3, forming O2−. Step II: O2− reacts with [CH3NH3]+ and Pb, yielding H2O and Pb(OH)2 on the MAI-terminated surface. Oxidation of Pb on the PbI2-terminated surface leads to the disintegration of the Pb–I bond. Then the underlying MAI-terminated surface is exposed. Step III: the oxidation products prevent the oxidation of inner MAPbI3. Then, the fresh water molecules produced in surface oxidation cause hydration of the inner perovskite and eventually break down the perovskite. 
Results and discussion
We first investigate the interaction between oxygen and MAPbI3. There exist two typical crystal structures of the MAPbI3 perovskite: the tetragonal phase at room temperature and the orthorhombic phase at low temperature (<162 K).39 Meanwhile, the (001) surface, which is the main framework of the bulk, is considered as one of the most common surfaces of the perovskite and it can be either MAI or PbI2-terminated (SMA–I and SPb–I).40,41 Therefore, MAPbI3 in the tetragonal phase and both MAI and PbI2-terminated (SMA–I and SPb–I) surfaces are considered in this study (the structure of the tetragonal phase and slab models of different surfaces are displayed in ESI Fig. 1 and 2,† respectively). The adsorption energies of O2 on the six adsorption sites (see Fig. 2a and ESI Fig. 3 and 4†) are presented in Table 1. On the SPb–I surface, the adsorption energies of the hollow site and Pb-top site are 0.14 and 0.11 eV, suggesting a weak interaction between O2 and the surface. On the MAI-terminated surface, the adsorption energies of all sites are close to zero, indicating that the interaction between O2 and the SMA–I surface is also very weak.

Next, we study the influence of O2 on the stability of the MAPbI3 (001) surface by AIMD simulations and the structure evolution of clean SPb–I and SMA–I at 300 K in 3 ps is calculated as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the Pb–I frameworks of SPb–I and SMA–I are slightly distorted at 300 K, but no major damage is observed on both surfaces, and the octahedron PbI6 cages still exist. When the surfaces are exposed to oxygen, the O2 is captured by SPb–I (either Pb-top or hollow site) but free-floating on SMA–I, consistent with the above adsorption energy results. More importantly, both SPb–I and SMA–I maintain their structural integrity in an oxygen-rich environment, indicating that O2 alone does not degrade the perovskite solar cell. This agrees well with the experimental observation that perovskite solar cells are stable for prolonged periods of time in dry air in the dark.42
It has been reported that MAPbI3 rapidly decomposes when it is exposed to light and dry air.25,26,28 The superoxide is suggested as the culprit that triggers the degradation.26 In general, a light and oxygen-induced reaction highly depends on the band structure of the reactants; more specifically, the semiconductor absorber should have a suitable band gap and well-matched band edges to the redox potential of O2/O2−.43Fig. 3a depicts the band structure of MAPbI3 with respect to the vacuum level. The suitable direct band gap makes MAPbI3 produce enough excitons under ambient light. Meanwhile, the redox potential of O2/O2− is just located inside the band gap. Thus, the photo-generated electrons can quickly transfer from the conduction band of MAPbI3 to the O2 on the surfaces, which leads to the formation of superoxide anions O2−. The formed O2− physisorbs on the surfaces of MAPbI3 with a stronger adsorption than that of the neutral O2 (0.64 eV vs. 0.11 eV on SPb–I and 0.63 eV vs. 0.05 eV on SMA–I, as listed in Table 1; detailed adsorption configurations are given in ESI Fig. 5 and 6†). The stronger adsorption of O2− results from its electrostatic attraction towards Pb2+ and [CH3NH3]+.
 Fig. 3  (a) Band structure and projected density of states for MAPbI3. The CBM of MAPbI3 and redox potential of O2/O2− with respect to the vacuum energy are −3.9 eV and −4.2 eV,5,43 respectively. (b) Partial charge density plots for the CBM and VBM of MAPbI3. The CBM is dominated by the p orbitals of Pb atoms, and the VBM is dominated by the coupling between the s orbitals of Pb atoms and the p orbitals of I atoms. 
We now consider the reaction of O2− with MAPbI3 and how the reaction leads to the decomposition of MAPbI3. On the PbI2-terminated surface, with O2− approaching the Pb–I frameworks, the O–O bond is enlarged and Pb–O chemical bonds are formed. Due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen compared to iodine, the O atoms prefer to replace adjacent I atoms and bond to two Pb atoms. As shown in Fig. 4a, the energy barrier for dissociating O2− on SPb–I is 0.79 eV, indicating that this process can occur at a moderate temperature of about 330 K (estimated from transition-state theory, 1012exp(−Eb/kT) ≈ 1, where Eb = 0.79 eV). In fact, the MAPbI3 is hole-doped by light excitation. The strong Coulomb interaction between O2− and hole-doped MAPbI3 is not included in our calculation. In other words, the reaction barrier could be even lower in real situations. In addition, our AIMD simulations further demonstrate that the transformation of O2− from physisorption to chemisorption on SPb–I occurs rapidly at room temperature (see Fig. 4b). The formation of Pb–O bonds leads to the gathering of Pb and O atoms and the formation of lead oxide. I atoms in the inorganic frameworks are replaced by the O atoms and tend to form volatile iodine (I2) (ESI Fig. 8a†). As a consequence, serious breakage is introduced into the Pb–I frameworks and the underlying MAI-terminated surface is exposed.

In the case of the MAI-terminated surface, there exist two possible reaction pathways according to the affinity of O2− towards the [CH3NH3]+ cation or Pb2+ cation. On one hand, one O atom of O2− takes two H atoms from adjacent [CH3NH3]+ cations, forming a water molecule with an energy barrier of 0.11 eV. Another O atom adsorbs on the adjacent Pb (see Fig. 4c). In this pathway, all the [CH3NH3]+ on the surface will convert into water and volatile methylamine. The formation of Pb–O bonds will result in disintegration of the local Pb–I octahedral structure (ESI Fig. 8b†). On the other hand, the O2− anion bonds with one Pb atom and takes two H atoms from adjacent [CH3NH3]+, forming the precursor of Pb(OH)2 (see Fig. 4d). Subsequently, the unstable Pb(OH)2 further decomposes into PbO and H2O.22 In summary, the O2− reacts with MAPbI3 by attaching to the cations in MAPbI3, i.e., Pb2+ and [CH3NH3]+, forming lead oxide and water which induce the structural collapse of MAPbI3.
The above discussions suggest that the solid oxidation products of MAPbI3 should mainly be PbO on the surface. However, PbI2 is typically detected as the dominant product of degradation in light and a dry air environment.25,26,28 The oxidation products on the surface could potentially serve as a protection layer to stop further oxidation. For example, black phosphorous and InSe can be protected by fully oxidized layers on the surface.43,44 In the case of MAPbI3, the oxidation products PbO and Pb(OH)2, on one hand, as wide band-gap semiconductors in the bulk phase (>2.5 eV),45,46 can obstruct the transfer of photo-excited electrons from the perovskite to molecular oxygen, avoiding the formation of superoxide. On the other hand, they may serve as a protection layer to prevent further penetration of O2 and H2O from the air environment. Hence, the O2− concentration would decrease rapidly and the oxidation degradation would be gradually terminated. However, the fresh H2O molecules, which are produced in surface oxidation, have strong affinity towards the cations of MAPbI3 and give rise to continuous hydration degradation of inner MAPbI3.
To verify this point, we made further room-temperature AIMD simulations by constructing a model of lead oxide covered MAPbI3. As shown in Fig. 5, the O2 and H2O from the air environment are completely isolated from the MAPbI3 by the PbO film. During the simulation time, O2 and H2O adsorb near the surface of the PbO film. Meanwhile the oxide monolayer maintains its integrity with no O2 or H2O penetrating into the MAPbI3. Nevertheless, the fresh H2O produced in the surface oxidation can penetrate into the inner of MAPbI3 owing to the large interspace between inorganic frameworks and organic molecules. Structural collapse of inorganic frameworks induced by H2O is observed after about 4 ps, which is much slower than that caused by oxidation as observed in experiments.25 This suggests that oxidation occurs fast on the MAPbI3 surface and forms a surface-covering layer of PbO. Meanwhile the inner degradation dominated by generated H2O occurs slowly, yielding a large amount of PbI2. Hence, lead iodide, as the principal product of hydration degradation, is therefore detected in degraded MAPbI3,19,20,25,26 whereas the oxidation intermediate, i.e., lead oxide, can only be detected as a by-product by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).28
 Fig. 5  Room temperature AIMD simulations were performed on the lead oxide covered MAPbI3 surrounded by H2O and O2 on the surface and H2O in the inside. The H2O and O2 molecules in the ambient environment are fully separated by lead oxide. But the water molecules produced in the reaction between superoxide and methylammonium permeate into the inner of MAPbI3 and gradually corrode the crystal structure of MAPbI3. The water molecules in MAPbI3 are marked with red circles. 
Now, we have a comprehensive picture of the light and oxygen-induced degradation of MAPbI3. First, superoxide anions are generated through a charge transfer reaction on the surface of MAPbI3 under ambient light. Then, the highly active superoxide anions react with the MAPbI3 surface: (i) the oxidation of the PbI2-terminated surface leads to the formation of PbO and serious breakage of the surface with the underlying MAI-terminated surface exposed and (ii) the exposed MAI-terminated surface is further oxidized to PbO and H2O or the unstable Pb(OH)2. Third, the oxidation products PbO and Pb(OH)2 serve as a protection layer to prevent the further oxidation of inner MAPbI3. Nevertheless, the fresh H2O molecules produced in the reaction of superoxide with methylammonium and the decomposition of Pb(OH)2 act as active species, cause hydration of the inner perovskite and ultimately destroy the MAPbI3. Therefore, we can conclude that the light and oxygen-induced degradation of MAPbI3 is accomplished through a rapid surface oxidation triggered by the superoxide anions and a slow inner hydration degradation caused by the fresh water molecules produced in the surface oxidation. The proposed degradation processes provide a good understanding of very recent experimental observations. Haque et al. found that the device performance of perovskite solar cells degraded in a matter of hours in a dry ambient environment, whereas structural degradation from MAPbI3 to PbI2 occurred on a timescale of days.25 In light of our proposed mechanism, the rapid degradation of the device performance is caused by the surface oxidation, and the slow structural degradation from MAPbI3 to PbI2 is caused by the inner hydration. In the film of MAPbI3, the surfaces of MAPbI3 nanoparticles exposed to oxygen are oxidized, with the oxidation products adhering to the grains. The oxidized surfaces impede the charge transport within the perovskite film and the charge extraction from the perovskite to transport layers, which ultimately leads to the decrease of photovoltaic performance in a matter of hours. However, with the rapid depletion and diminishing superoxide generation, the oxidation degradation gradually stops. Thereafter, the H2O molecules generated from the surface oxidation slowly corrode the inner of MAPbI3 on a timescale of days. The experimental work of Vaynzof et al. also provides strong support to our degradation process of fast surface oxidation and slow inner hydration.28 By X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, they found just a small amount of oxidation products such as lead oxide on the surface. The hydration products such as lead iodide were still the principal degradation products. Note that although we clarify the fundamental light and oxygen-induced degradation mechanism here, there are still a lot of questions worth exploring. For example, how does one understand the roles of surface defects and grain boundaries in oxygen induced degradation?
From the above discussion, we have known that the superoxide anions and water molecules are two key factors for the degradation of MAPbI3. Thus, both O2− and H2O should be isolated to protect MAPbI3 against the ambient environment. For the oxidation process, the production of O2− can be restricted by extracting photo-excited electrons from the MAPbI3 using either conducting scaffolds or high performance compact electrode interface layers.29 However, to fully extract photo-excited electrons, the solar cell requires working conditions at maximum operating voltages,29 which greatly reduces the power conversion efficiency of MAPbI3. Surface modification benefits from facile preparation and low cost for large-scale production compared with common encapsulation methods. It has been proven to be an effective method against a H2O-rich environment. Meanwhile, a high photoelectric conversion efficiency is maintained.34,35 It is crucial to find an appropriate substitute for methylammonium to modify the surface of MAPbI3 to achieve excellent moisture and oxygen tolerance simultaneously. For this purpose, benzylamine (BA) and 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine (FPA) are chosen to substitute the methylammonium on the (001) surface of MAPbI3 (see Fig. 6a).

(h) XRD patterns of the control film without exposure to light and the FPA modified film exposed to light for 2 h, respectively. 
It has been proven that substituting methylammonium with BA can efficiently improve the moisture resistance of the perovskite,38 but could it make perovskite immune to photo-oxidation as well? As shown in Fig. 6b, the diffusion barrier of oxygen molecules from the BA-modified surface to Pb–I frameworks is 0.73 eV, indicating that the oxygen in air can still cross the interspace between benzylamine at room temperature. Once the oxygen is close enough to the Pb–I frameworks, it can get photo-generated electrons and be reduced to O2−, and then oxidation of Pb–I frameworks will quickly occur and lead to the breakdown of MAPbI3 (ESI Fig. 10b†). For the replacement with FPA, due to the suitable size of FPA, a dense protective layer is constructed, which contains numerous inert groups. The energy barrier for O2 diffusing from the FPA-modified surface to Pb–I frameworks increases up to 1.56 eV (Fig. 6c). Thus the dense layer could effectively avoid O2 reaching the Pb–I frameworks, which suppresses the generation of O2−. In addition, the exposed hydrophobic groups of FPA endow the FPA-substituted surface with good hydrophobicity (ESI Fig. 11†). Obviously, the weak van der Waals interaction between FPA and Pb–I frameworks will not affect the intrinsic property of the inner perovskite. Instead, the π-conjugation structure of FPA can facilitate the charge transport between MAPbI3 and charge transport materials. Therefore, the high air resistance of MAPbI3 can be expected by means of FPA modification, while the outstanding photophysical properties remain unaffected.
Inspired by the findings from DFT calculations, we then experimentally investigated the effect of BA and FPA modification on the stability of MAPbI3. We first examined the MAPbI3 film stability under light (100 mW cm−2, 50 °C and 20% air humidity) by XRD measurements, as shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6f, all the films exhibit tetragonal phase XRD patterns before exposure to light. After exposure to light for 1 h, the control film (without the protective layer) and BA modified film began to decompose and the films exhibit the peak of PbI2 at 12.58° (Fig. 6g and h). However, the FPA modified film remained unchanged even after exposure to light for 2 h, comparable to the control film without exposure to light (Fig. 6h). However, the control film and BA modified film were totally decomposed to PbI2 after exposure to light for 2 h, as shown in Fig. 6e. Compared to the control film without exposure to light, decomposition of the control film and BA modified film in short time is attributed to O2− caused by light illumination. Because of the close-packed arrangement of FPA, the FPA modified films show significantly improved stability against oxygen and water.
Conclusions
In summary, we have established a comprehensive picture of the photo-oxidative degradation of MAPbI3 under ambient conditions and proposed an effective strategy to resist corrosion due to water and oxygen. The degradation includes three important steps: generation of superoxide anions under light illumination, rapid oxidation of the surface perovskite and production of water, and slow hydration of the inner perovskite. The generation of the superoxide anions triggers the surface oxidation of MAPbI3. The solid oxidation products form a protective layer to prevent the further oxidation of inner MAPbI3. Meanwhile the fresh water molecules produced in surface oxidation will cause hydration of the inner perovskite and ultimate breakage of the perovskite. We further demonstrate that the replacement of methylammonium with 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine on the surface of MAPbI3 can effectively prevent the infiltration of both water and oxygen, consequently avoiding the degradation of MAPbI3. This study provides an in-depth understanding on the degradation mechanism of MAPbI3 and opens a new avenue towards realizing the long-term stability of perovskite-based solar cells.
Methods
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
All DFT calculations were performed using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).47,48 The spin-polarized general gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)49 form was used. van der Waals (vdW) interactions were considered for weak interaction cases using the semiempirical correction scheme of Grimme, DFT-D3.50 The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was set at 400 eV. The convergence threshold was 10−4 eV for energy and 0.02 eV Å−1 for force, respectively. The pseudopotential was scalar-relativistic and accounted partially for relativistic effects. The electronic structure was calculated without considering the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) to obtain a band gap consistent with experimental data. AIMD simulations were performed using the Nose–Hoover method51 to control the temperature. The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method52 was employed to locate the minimum-energy path. The lattice parameters of bulk tetragonal MAPbI3 were optimized using a Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh of a 5 × 5 × 3 grid and a tetragonal unit cell containing 48 atoms (see ESI Fig. 1†). A periodical slab of two and half layers MAPbI3 (001) surface is used to perform structural relaxation and AIMD simulations (see Fig. 2a and ESI Fig. 2†). A vacuum of at least 20 Å in the z-direction was used to avoid the interaction between two periodic units. The Brillouin zone of slabs was sampled by using a Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh of a 3 × 3 × 1 grid and a 2 × 2 × 1 grid for structural relaxation and AIMD simulations, respectively. The bottom of the slabs (inside the blue rectangle region in Fig. 2a) was fixed to their bulk positions during relaxation, while the rest of the layers were fully relaxed.
MAPbI3 film fabrication
PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich), MAI (Xian P-OLED company), benzylamine (BA, TCI) and 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine (FPA, Apollo) were used as received. All the films were fabricated under an atmospheric environment (∼20 °C, 30–40% air humidity). To obtain 1.45 M MAPbI3 solution, PbI2 and MAI powders were stirred in a mixture of DMSO and DMF (6:4) for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto an FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with chlorobenzene drop-casting. The substrate was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. For the modified film, 0.1 M BA and FPA chlorobenzene solution were dropped onto the MAPbI3 substrate, immediately followed by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then drying at 100 °C for 10 min. For the control film, only chlorobenzene solvent was dropped on the MAPbI3 substrate.
Light experiments
The light experiment was performed using a Xenon Weather-Ometer under an atmospheric environment. The power of light was set at 100 mW cm−2. During the light experiment, the temperature was limited below 50 °C, and the air humidity was about 20%.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the photo-oxidative degradation process of the MAPbI3 (001) surface. Step I: the O2 close to the surface of MAPbI3 gets the photo-excited electrons from MAPbI3, forming O2−. Step II: O2− reacts with [CH3NH3]+ and Pb, yielding H2O and Pb(OH)2 on the MAI-terminated surface. Oxidation of Pb on the PbI2-terminated surface leads to the disintegration of the Pb–I bond. Then the underlying MAI-terminated surface is exposed. Step III: the oxidation products prevent the oxidation of inner MAPbI3. Then, the fresh water molecules produced in surface oxidation cause hydration of the inner perovskite and eventually break down the perovskite.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Side and top views of slab models of PbI2- and MAI-terminated (001) surfaces (SPb–I and SMA–I) of MAPbI3. The layers inside the blue rectangle regions are fixed to bulk positions while other layers are relaxed. The green balls indicate the six different adsorption sites of O2, O2− and H2O. Structure evolutions of (b) clean SPb–I and SPb–I with O2 adsorption and (c) clean SMA–I and SMA–I with O2 adsorption at 300 K obtained from AIMD simulations. The O2 molecules are marked with red circles.	 


O2	0.14	0.06	0.11	0.05	−0.02	−0.09
O2−	0.23	0.55	0.64	0.44	0.63	0.04

 	Fig. 3  (a) Band structure and projected density of states for MAPbI3. The CBM of MAPbI3 and redox potential of O2/O2− with respect to the vacuum energy are −3.9 eV and −4.2 eV,5,43 respectively. (b) Partial charge density plots for the CBM and VBM of MAPbI3. The CBM is dominated by the p orbitals of Pb atoms, and the VBM is dominated by the coupling between the s orbitals of Pb atoms and the p orbitals of I atoms.	 

 	Fig. 4  Reaction path for O2− adsorbed on (a) the PbI2-terminated surface and (c) MAI-terminated surface from physisorption to chemisorption. Snapshots of AIMD simulations of O2− on (b) the PbI2-terminated surface and (d) MAI-terminated surface at a temperature of 300 K.	 

 	Fig. 5  Room temperature AIMD simulations were performed on the lead oxide covered MAPbI3 surrounded by H2O and O2 on the surface and H2O in the inside. The H2O and O2 molecules in the ambient environment are fully separated by lead oxide. But the water molecules produced in the reaction between superoxide and methylammonium permeate into the inner of MAPbI3 and gradually corrode the crystal structure of MAPbI3. The water molecules in MAPbI3 are marked with red circles.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Schematic illustration of surface functionalization by replacing methylammonium with benzylamine (BA) and 2-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine (FPA). Diffusion path of O2 into (b) BA and (c) FPA modified MAPbI3. (d) Photos of the control film and BA and FPA modified films exposed to light and 20% air humidity (AH) for 1 h at 50 °C, respectively. (e) Photos of the control film without exposure to light and the control film and BA and FPA modified films exposed to light for 2 h, respectively. (f) XRD patterns of the control film and BA and FPA modified films before exposure to light, respectively. The characteristic peaks of FTO are marked with *. (g) XRD patterns of the control film and BA and FPA modified films exposed to light for 1 h, respectively. The characteristic peak of PbI2 is marked with ♦. (h) XRD patterns of the control film without exposure to light and the FPA modified film exposed to light for 2 h, respectively.
