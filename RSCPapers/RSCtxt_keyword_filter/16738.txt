    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 4th June 2019AbstractA ternary strategy could combine the advantages of incorporated materials as an encouraging approach to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, ternary PSCs based on PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM with different weight ratios were systematically investigated. With 20 wt% PC71BM incorporated into the accepters, the PSCs achieved the best PCE as high as 12.28% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.928 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.70 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.78%, which is undoubtedly superior to those of binary devices based on PTBTz-2:IT-M (10.39%) or PTBTz-2:PC71BM (9.20%). The energy transfer mechanism between PC71BM and IT-M was investigated in depth by femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy and time-correlated single-photon counting. The Förster resonance energy transfer mechanism between PC71BM and IT-M has been powerfully verified. Morphology characterization analysis, density of states theory and density functional theory calculations indicated that the excellent combination of PC71BM and IT-M has a synergistic effect on the VOC values of the devices. Our results suggested that the two acceptors with drastically different structures could synergistically combine the merits of each to optimize crystallinity and charge generation, separation, and collection, which simultaneously enhanced the PCEs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a potential candidate to prevent the energy crisis and environmental pollution, for their light weight, flexibility, roll-to-roll manufacture and low cost.1 Continuous inspiring breakthrough of the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) has been made for PSCs in recent years,2–8 resulting in the achievement of single junction non-fullerene PSCs with PCEs above 15%.9 The ternary strategy was selected as a universally accepted effective path for achieving highly efficient PSCs by blending a third component, which could integrate with each advantage of tandem and binary PSCs to expand the absorption spectra and optimize the morphology of active layers in a single-junction device.8,10,11
Although fullerenes and their derivatives have been considered to restrict the developmental progress of PSCs due to their intrinsic drawbacks of poor absorption and limited energy level tunability,12 fullerene acceptors are still worth considering. With the low excited (0.2–0.4 eV) energy of their anions,13 high electron affinity, high electron mobility even in blended films and isotropic charge transport,12,14 they are particularly beneficial to promote charge separation at the interface. Recently, a ternary solar cell based on a fullerene acceptor has achieved a PCE above 13%, which should be attributed to forming a hierarchical morphology including PCBM transporting pathway and a convoluted non-fullerene favorable phase-separated transporting approach network.15 Therefore, fullerene materials should not be ignored as a choice for use in a ternary strategy.
In this paper, poly[2-octyldodecyl-6-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4-(5-methylthiazol-2-yl)thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTBTz-2) was singled out as the electron donor.16 The non-fullerene acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5-methylindanone))-5,5,11,11-tetra(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-M)17 and fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were selected as the electron acceptors. Binary devices of PTBTz-2:IT-M were prepared and displayed an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.954 V and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.61 mA cm−2, but a low fill factor (FF) of 61.84%, producing the low PCE of only 10.39%. Considering the absorption characteristics of PC71BM, ternary PSCs based on PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM with different ratios were also fabricated. The PCE of the optimized ternary PSCs is up to 12.28% with an improved FF (>70%), which benefits from the simultaneous improvements of JSC and FF. There is an obvious dependence of PC71BM content on the performance of the ternary devices. Furthermore, systematic morphological characterization analysis implied the incorporated PC71BM had a good compatibility with IT-M, together with improved phase-separation and crystallinity. Moreover, the electron density of state (DOS) theory and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that finely mixed acceptors would favor wave function overlap between the two acceptors, which contributed to charge transfer or energy transfer. And the rarely reported process of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PC71BM and IT-M has been powerfully verified by femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). Our results reveal that the two acceptors with drastically different structure could synergistically combine the merits of each to boost the performance of the devices.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and c show the chemical structure and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, respectively, of the active layer materials used in this paper. It is seen that the PTBTz-2 film exhibits a wide absorption range of 500–727 nm, while the PC71BM and IT-M films show a strong absorption at 350–500 nm and 500–800 nm, respectively. The photon harvesting range of the combined films has been effectively broadened by introducing PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 1d. These elaborately selected materials are obviously complementary by a preliminary judgement from absorption spectra and energy levels, which may have great potential to achieve high-performance PSCs by optimizing the PC71BM ratio for regulating the morphology and increasing the photon harvesting. The influence of PC71BM doping was examined by fabricating PSCs based on PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM with different weight ratios. Their detailed photovoltaic characteristics are shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. Obviously, the variation of efficiency shows a PC71BM content dependence. When the content of PC71BM is 20%, the photovoltaic performance of the ternary PSCs is the best, with a PCE up to 12.28%. It is worth emphasizing that FF increased from 61.84% to 70.78%, which indicates that the material combination has good compatibility. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of ternary PSCs vary with the change of PC71BM content, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films, as shown in Fig. 2b.

Synergistic effect
In this work, the correlation between VOC and composition ratio in ternary PSCs was observed. It is essential to ascertain the mechanism of how to influence the important parameter VOC for PSCs. The ability of organic semiconductors to influence VOC had been investigated in depth insighted.18 Here, the VOC of PSCs based on PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM with different weight ratios was studied by Gaussian distribution theory. From eqn (1),19Geff can be obtained: (1)Here Geff represents the effective Gaussian DOS, Ne represents the total electron DOS of unit mass, ELUMO represents the acceptor energy level and expectation of the Gaussian distribution, and σ is the broadening of DOS. Thus VOC of a ternary device can be worked out according to eqn (2):20–22 (2)where VOCBinary1 and VOCBinary2 are the VOC of PSCs based on donor:acceptor1 and donor:acceptor2, respectively; Ne1 and Ne2 represent the frontier orbital densities of acceptor1 and acceptor2, respectively; and f1 and f2 are the weight percentages of acceptor1 and acceptor2 of the ternary blend films, respectively. IT-M has three isomers with one methyl group occurring on the two edges of the molecule which are 5,5-isomer, 5,6-isomer and 6,6-isomer. In order to more precisely analyze the synergistic effects of IT-M and PC71BM to influence the effective DOS of the acceptor collaborative unit, all three of the isomers of IT-M and PC71BM were optimized according to DFT quantum calculations at B3LYP/6-311G(d) level. Theoretical calculation indicates the differences of the energy levels between the three isomers of IT-M could be negligible, as displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). When the VOC experimental data of Ne,PC71BM = 2.83, Ne,IT-M can fit a simulation curve well, as shown in Fig. 2c, and the calculated details are described in ESI.† The small deviation of VOC may be due to energy disorder and so on.23 The origin of VOC variation could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two acceptors even with their chemical structures being drastically different,8,21 forming a new collaborative unit such as dimeric or oligomeric structures.24 At the same time, the two finely mixed acceptors will be conducive to the overlap of wave functions which resulted in charge transfer or energy transfer between each other.
Charge collection efficiency and recombination
We attempted to gain an in-depth insight into the photocurrent behavior and charge collection characteristics (Jph–Veff) of the PTBTz-2-based PSCs. Photocurrent density Jph is obtained from Jph = JLight − JDark. Veff is defined by Veff = V0 − Vbias, where Vbias and V0 stand for the applied voltage and the voltage under JLight = JDark, respectively.8,25–27 The ratio of Jph/Jsat relates to the exciton dissociation possibility and charge collection ability, which was determined by exciton dissociation probability P(E,T). It characterizes the overall losses of photogenerated carriers under the transport process in photoactive layer and the carrier extraction at the interface between photoactive layer and electrode under varied Veff. Jsat denotes the saturation photocurrent density, which relates to the light harvesting of photoactive layers. It could be determined according to Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the unit charge and L and Gmax represent the photoactive layer thickness and the maximum exciton generation rate, respectively. All of the Gmax values were calculated and are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
Monomolecular recombination (MM) as a first-order process is the main recombination process under short-circuit state (Veff = V0) and slowly shifts to the second-order (bimolecular) recombination (BM) for the PSCs which is close to the open-circuit state (Veff = 0 V).28,29 As shown in Fig. 3a, ranging from the Veff = V0 position to another position where power output reaches the highest (Veff > Vmaxpoint, where Vmaxpoint is the effective maximum power output voltage, corresponding to the black, red and blue curves of 0.19 V, 0.15 V and 0.23 V, respectively), the MM process shows a major loss behavior, while the BM process becomes serious at Veff < Vmaxpoint region. BM is the most crucial element restricting P(E,T) for PSCs at small Veff. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the P(E,T) of the PTBTz-2:PC71BM and PTBTz-2:IT-M binary PSCs are always less than those of optimized ternary PSCs, owing to a notable increase in BM loss. The P(E,T) of different devices are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). A higher P(E,T) of 96.06% was realized for the 20% PC71BM-based device. The larger value of P(E,T) for the optimized composition indicates better charge collection and extraction, and thus is coherent with its high FF.30,31

The dependence of JSC on the illumination intensity (PLight) was investigated to understand the charge-recombination mechanism. It is described by a power law relationship: JSC ∝ PLightα, where α represents the exponential factor. Weak BM recombination occurring in photoactive layers would cause a logarithm–linear relation between JSC and Plight. The fitting values of α are 0.975 and 0.982 for PTBTz-2:IT-M- and PTBTz-2:PC71BM-based binary PSCs, which were lower than that of the optimized ternary PSC (0.993), implying that the BM recombination can be suppressed.3,21 The extent of trap-assisted recombination was determined by VOC ∝ nKT/qln(Plight), where K denotes the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.25 In this relationship, the BM recombination can be the major loss mechanism for n equal to 1, while trap-assisted recombination is preferred for n beyond 1 for PSCs. As seen from Fig. 3c, the slopes are 1.35KT/q and 1.26KT/q, respectively, for PTBTz-2:IT-M- and PTBTz-2:PC71BM-based binary photovoltaic devices and small slope of 1.18KT/q for the best ternary photovoltaic devices. This suggests that the appropriate doping of PC71BM is able to decrease trap-assisted recombination. Above all, BM and trap-assisted recombination can be depressed dramatically for the best ternary PSCs.
To examine how the incorporation of PC71BM influences charge mobility for the photoactive layer, electron mobilities (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) can be calculated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The related device architecture and calculated results are displayed in ESI.† We can see that with the increase of PC71BM content, μh slowly decreases but μe gradually increases. For the PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM (1:1.2:0.3) blend film the most balanced μh/μe ratio value (3.72 × 10−4/3.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is observed, which was attributed to more favorable microstructure of active layers, the latter analysis results being obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). From the perspective of device physics, the balanced electron and hole mobilities are beneficial for carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, which is one of the primary contributions for the obtained optimal PCE.32–35 The desirable FFs (65.52–70.78%) can be well explained by the relatively low loss of charge carriers by the favorable balanced SCLC mobilities.
Location of PC71BM in ternary blends
The phase separation and morphology of the active layer have a great influence on PSCs, which are affected by the surface energy of the film components.36,37 The contact angles of the pure PTBTz-2, IT-M and PC71BM films are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding surface energy values were 33.46, 43.22 and 47.18 mN m−1, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). The wetting coefficient of PC71BM (ωPC71BM) in the PTBTz-2:IT-M blend film can be obtained by the surface energy among the three components, which can predict the position of PC71BM in the ternary blend film. The ωPC71BM value for the PTBTz-2:IT-M blend film is −1.81, which indicates that PC71BM may be located in the IT-M domain (the detailed analysis can be seen in the ESI†). These results indicated the excellent miscibility of PC71BM and IT-M.

Morphology characterization
2D-GIWAXS was used to study the molecular arrangement in active layers, whose patterns and 1D profiles are shown in Fig. 5. In the qz scans, the PTBTz-2:IT-M binary blend films exhibit weak (100) reflection at 2.46 nm−1 (d = 2.55 nm) and a discernible (010) peak of 18.4 nm−1, which are the lamellar packing peak for PTBTz-2 and π–π stacking peak for IT-M, respectively. For the in-plane direction of the PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM ternary blend films, there were two distinct peaks at 2.71 nm−1 (d = 2.32 nm) and 18.40 nm−1 and a weak and broad (100) peak at 13.5 nm−1. Meanwhile, it was interesting to observe that the qz peak of PTBTz-2 shifted to qz = 2.71 nm−1 of the optimized ternary blend films from qz = 2.46 nm−1 of the PTBTz-2:IT-M blend films, suggesting a reduction of the lamellar packing distance from 3.55 nm to 2.32 nm, showing a closer spacing of polymers along the direction of alkyl stacking after the addition of PC71BM. The lamellar (100) diffraction shows peaks at 2.79 nm−1 and 3.50 nm−1, which are assigned to PTBTz-2 and IT-M, respectively. When 20% PC71BM was added into the PTBTz-2:IT-M thin film, the diffraction signal at 3.50 nm−1 was enhanced, implying an increased crystallinity of IT-M.

Shown in Fig. 6 are AFM images of blend films with different PC71BM weight contents. The surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the ternary blend film PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM (1:1.2:0.3) was near to 2.63 nm, and none of the RMS values of blend films are larger than 4.12 nm, indicating that the incorporated PC71BM had a weak influence on the morphology of the active layer. TEM was employed to further investigate the composition and in-depth morphology of the active layers. Attributed to the larger electron scattering density of fullerenes, the dark regions were ascribed to PC71BM-rich domains.38,39 The TEM measurements suggested a favorable phase separation was obtained by doping 20% PC71BM in blend films, which is beneficial for exciton splitting and charge generation and collection for PSCs.40,41

Photophysical properties
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was recorded to examine the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer property in photoactive layers. As exhibited in Fig. 7a, the neat film of PTBTz-2 shows an emission peak at 720 nm excited at 600 nm. After adding PC71BM or IT-M, the PL spectra of binary blend films were almost quenched (over 99%, as shown in Fig. 7a and b), indicating the efficient electron transfer from PTBTz-2 to the electron acceptors for the excitons generated in the donor phase. FRET is the incoherent non-radiative transfer of excitons between two chromophores via dipole–dipole coupling interaction,42 which could significantly boost the PCEs of bulk-heterojunction solar cells.43,44 But the FRET effects between fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors for PSCs are rarely reported. PC71BM shows an emission peak at 710 nm with excitation at 433 nm. Based on FRET theory, the emission spectrum of PC71BM apparently overlapped with the absorption spectrum of IT-M, as shown in Fig. 7c, so that there should be energy transfer from PC71BM to IT-M.42 To further confirm the possibility of charge transfer or exciton dissociation between PC71BM and IT-M, a variety of devices were fabricated and tested with PC71BM, IT-M or PC71BM:IT-M as the photoactive layers (without PTBTz-2). As shown in Fig. 7d, the JSC of the IT-M:PC71BM-based cell is between that of the PC71BM-based and IT-M-based cells, implying the charge transfer or exciton dissociation at PC71BM/IT-M interfaces could be neglected,45 and indicating the occurrence of more efficient energy transfer between PC71BM and IT-M. Based on the above analysis, the mechanism of the ternary PSCs can be schematically depicted, as displayed in Fig. 2d. As FRET offers an additional non-radiative decay path for the energy donor in the system, the PL decay lifetime of the energy donor should be decreased with an increase of energy acceptor content in the donor.43 TCSPC and femtosecond TA spectroscopy were employed to further characterize the detailed FRET photophysical mechanism.44 As shown in Fig. 7e and f, the TCSPC-recorded exciton decay lifetimes were well fitted and are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI) and Table S4 (ESI†). The decay lifetime of neat PC71BM was 449 ps, which then declined to 304 ps for blend films with IT-M:PC71BM (0.8:0.2), suggesting energy transfer occurred via the FRET mechanism from PC71BM to IT-M and thus resulting in the reduced ground state of PC71BM by the probing recorder.

(e and f) Energy level diagrams of decay times for: neat IT-M and neat PC71BM film, and IT-M:PC71BM blend film, respectively. 
To further gather convincing evidence of the kinetic process between PC71BM and IT-M, neat and blend films were characterized by TA (sub-30 fs) spectra, as displayed in Fig. 8. TA spectra customarily consist of two main features: negative signature attributed to ground state bleach (GSB) and positive signature of excited state absorption (ESA) characteristics. The pure PC71BM film was pumped at 380 nm followed by supercontinuum probe, and an ESA signature at 640 nm was observed with a decay time of 1.68 ps. Fig. 8c and d show TA spectra of neat IT-M film with two GSB signatures at 626 and 692 nm, and a weak ESA signature at 750 nm. The PC71BM:IT-M (0.2:0.8, pumped at 400 nm) blend film was explored by probing 626 and 692 nm assigned to the GSB signal of IT-M and probing 750 nm ascribed to the ESA signal of IT-M, as shown in Fig. 8e and f. The observed signals related to GSB and ESA characteristics are the overlapped region of both PC71BM and IT-M. The neat PC71BM film with the positive signal disappeared and the PC71BM:IT-M (0.2:0.8) blend film with two new GSB peaks at 626 and 696 nm were also observed, which are located in the FRET overlapped region of both PC71BM and IT-M (as shown in Fig. 7c). Based on the fitted results as shown in Fig. 8g and S7 (ESI†), the two GSB signatures of IT-M in the blend show up as a more rapid decay than that of neat IT-M film. These GSB bands correspond to the material static absorption spectra which can be ascribed to the filling effect of singlet excitons excited by the pump pulse. The singlet excitons induced ESA bands of PC71BM:IT-M (0.2:0.8) blend film spanning a range of 720–770 nm. These results indicated the singlet excitons transition or attenuate with a faster rate than in the neat IT-M film. As displayed in Fig. 8e and h, the ESA features of IT-M in blend film exhibited an obviously heightened intensity and faster decay (≈0.286 ps) compared with the pristine IT-M film (5.58 ps). Therefore, there should be an energy transfer process between PC71BM and IT-M owing to the enhanced IT-M signature.44 Above all, we revealed the FRET process between PC71BM and IT-M, which may point out a brand-new understanding to improve the exciton utilization efficiency and then boost the efficiency of ternary PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, high-performance ternary PSCs have been designed and fabricated using PTBTz-2:IT-M:PC71BM with different ratios. It was found that when the PC71BM weight content in acceptors was 20%, the ternary PSCs exhibited a desirable PCE of up to 12.28%, a VOC of 0.928 V, a JSC of 18.70 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.78%, with this PCE being significantly higher than those of binary systems based on PTBTz-2:IT-M (10.39%) or PTBTz-2:PC71BM (9.20%). The efficiency enhancement was mainly attributed to broadened absorption, enhanced crystallinity, and favorable morphology, induced by the synergistic effect of the two acceptors with drastically different chemical structures. And the effect of the process has been investigated in depth by electronic measurements, morphology analyses, and the DOS theory and DFT calculations. Interestingly, the rarely reported FRET process between PC71BM and IT-M has been powerfully verified by our detailed experimental results from TA spectroscopy and TCSPC. Our results demonstrated that even two acceptors with significantly different structures having synergistic effects could optimize phase separation and crystallinity, and improve charge generation, separation, and collection abilities, which would help exploit the potential of some mediocre binary systems to boost PSC performance.
