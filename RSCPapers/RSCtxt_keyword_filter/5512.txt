    , Accepted 6th February 2023First published on 7th February 2023AbstractFurther advancement of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) requires a new polymerization design strategy to develop ideal polymer acceptors that possess and retain maximally the advantages of narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptor building blocks. In this work, we report a new design strategy to synthesize a polymerized small molecule acceptor PT-BTP with a double-cable structure composed of a fused-ring Y-series acceptor framework as a pendant side unit and thiophene derivative as the conjugated backbone. PT-BTP exhibits a narrow optical bandgap of 1.35 eV and high electron mobility as well as a favorable BHJ blend morphology when blended with polymer donor PM6, resulting in good photovoltaic performance. The optimized PM6:PT-BTP all-PSCs displayed a high PCE of 12.13% with an energy loss (Eloss) of 0.566 eV and a small non-radiative recombination loss (ΔE3) of 0.227 eV. In contrast, the as-cast devices only showed a lower PCE of 8.14% with inferior Eloss and ΔE3 values. This work enables a new molecular design direction to construct narrow bandgap PAs toward successful applications in high-performance all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which contain a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a p-type polymer donor (PD) and an n-type polymer acceptor (PA),1–5 have promising advantages of superior mechanical flexibility and thermal stability and have great potential for new applications as portable and wearable optoelectronic devices.6,7 Recently, using the polymerized small molecule acceptor (PSMA) approach, ternary strategy, relevant morphology control methods, etc.,1,8–14 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of state-of-the-art all-PSCs have been increased to over 18%.15–17 However, this efficiency still lags behind those of the small molecule acceptor (SMA)-based polymer solar cells (PCE > 19%).18–20 This is attributed to the limited number of candidates for PSMAs with narrow bandgaps, and a poor dimensional active layer morphology, retarding the further development of all-polymer systems with high performance.21 For instance, the linear PAs based on Y-series SMAs as the conjugated backbones generally possess complex synthesis routes, inferior display or retention of the SMA properties, and difficulty in regulating molecular conformational freedom.22 Thus, to facilitate the performance improvement of all-PSCs, it is imperative to develop new PSMA strategies for overcoming the limitations or disadvantages of linear PSMAs, and design novel polymer acceptors featuring a more narrow bandgap with a high extinction coefficient, to enable efficient light harvesting properties and multiple structure design options while maintaining the molecular characteristics of SMAs.
In the past few years, interdisciplinary research efforts focused on the design and synthesis of linear PAs via a strategy of a polymerized fused-ring small molecule electron acceptor.11,23 In 2017, to broaden the absorption spectra of polymer acceptors and overcome the inferior near-infrared absorbance issue of relevant PAs (e.g. PDI-DTT, NDP-V, and N2200 and its derivatives),24–26 Li et al. first reported a linear polymer acceptor PZ1 with a low band gap of 1.55 eV and a high absorption coefficient (1.3 × 105 cm−1 at 700 nm).1 PZ1 was synthesized using a large π-fused acceptor–donor–acceptor structured SMA IDIC-C16 as the main conjugated backbone and thiophene as the π-bridge.1 Consequently, Li et al. promoted the PCE of the related all-PSCs from approximately 5% to 8.27% by using polymer J51 as the donor. Following this linear design strategy, more efforts have been made to develop new PSMAs by incorporating a π-spacer to connect narrow bandgap Y-series-type SMAs in these two years.27 Recent investigations found that these linear PSMAs show the merits of Y-series fused-ring electron acceptors, including broad absorption spectra and a strong absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region, suitable electronic energy levels, and good miscibility with various polymer donors.28 Note that PSMAs with Y-series-type SMA as the key building block were simultaneously designed by several groups.28–31 For instance, with 2-decylteradecyl and 2-octyldodecyl functionalized Y-series derivatives as the building blocks, Jia et al. and Min et al. reported PAs PJ1 and PYT with high PCEs of 14.40% and 13.44%, respectively.29,32 By using the commonly used structure modifications (e.g. π-bridge, central core units, heteroatoms, and terminal groups), random polymerization approach, stepwise optimization strategy, ternary and PD selections,1,8–14,33,34 the PCE of relevant all-PSCs is up to over 18%.15 Despite the remarkable progress, the linear issue of the polymer chain is a limitation for better device performance.35 As compared to the high-performance Y-series-type SMA materials, the reported linear-conjugated PDs obtained using broader molecular design strategies fail to provide narrower optical bandgaps (Eoptg values of 1.41–1.45 eV), resulting in the limited performance of all-PSCs.29,30,34 In particular, the reported linear-conjugated molecular structures generally cannot fully exhibit the merits of SMA materials as mentioned above. To enrich the pool of high-performance PSMAs and facilitate the development of high-performance all-PSCs, further studies on the development of promising SMA polymerization strategies are urgent and important.
Based on the above view, to develop new PAs that possess and retain maximally the merits of Y-series-type building blocks, herein we proposed a new design strategy of polymerizing SMAs and reported a double-cable PMSA PT-BTP (poly[[2,2′-bithiophen]-4-ylmethyl(Z)-1-(dicyanomethylene)-2-((10-(((Z)-1-(dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-inden-2-ylidene)methyl)-3,9-dinonyl-12,13-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′: 4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indol-2-yl)methylene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-5-carboxylate]), composed of a fused-ring Y6 A–DA′D–A structure as the conjugated-side group and a polythiophene main chain as the conjugated key building backbone (Fig. 1). Note that the embedding of the Y6-series-type side group is expected to maximally realise the advantages of this SMA and meanwhile to retain the merits of conjugated polymers. Compared to our reported linear PSMA counterpart (PYF-T with an Eoptg of approximately 1.40 eV, molecular structures shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), PT-BTP shows a narrower optical bandgap of 1.35 eV. The effect of this double-cable PA structure on optoelectronic properties, blend morphology, carrier mobility, and photovoltaic properties was fully investigated in this paper. As a result, an optimal PCE of 12.13% was achieved using the PM6:PT-BTP devices, which is much higher than that of the as-cast device (8.14%). This work provides a new design strategy to construct narrower bandgap PSMAs, which are difficult to manipulate with the traditional linear polymerization methods for all-PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route of the double-cable PAPT-BTP is described in Fig. 1 and the detailed synthetic procedures and characterization can be found in the Experimental section. Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were synthesized according to the procedures outlined in the literature. (2,5-Dibromothiophenconfirm-3-yl)methyl-1-(dicyanomethylene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-5-carboxylate (6) as the key ester-functionalized end-capping group was synthesized using four steps (e.g., acyl chlorination with thionyl chloride, esterification with (2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl)methanol, the reduction under ethyl acetoacetate (EAA)/triethylamine (TEA), and Knoevenagel condensation with malononitrile), with an overall 21% yield. We obtained target monomer M1 that was prepared via the Knoevenagel condensation of 3,9-dinonyl-12,13-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-dicarbaldehyde (7) with a combination of the end-capping units (compound 6 and conventional electron-withdrawing terminal group 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F)). Finally, the target polymer acceptor PT-BTP was synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization between M1 and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (M2), the details are described in the experimental section in the (ESI†). The molecular structures of relevant compounds were confirmed by 1H, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S2–S6, ESI†). The molecular weight of the PT-BTP was determined by the high-temperature gel permeation chromatography using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight was determined as 10.1 kDa for PT-BTP, with a polydispersity index of 2.09. The polymer acceptor PT-BTP was readily soluble in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene, indicating their suitability for all-PSC fabrication.
To study the optical adsorption properties of the polymer materials, we first measured the ultraviolet-visible to near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption of the commonly used polymer donor PM6 and the designed polymer acceptor PT-BTP in diluted CF solutions and thin-film state, respectively (Fig. 2(A)). The detailed parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In diluted CF solution, PT-BTP exhibits strong absorption in the wavelength range of 625–825 nm with the absorption peak (λmax) centered at 744 nm. Impressively, in the thin-film state, PT-BTP shows significantly red-shift absorption, the maximum absorption peak is accordingly centered at 811 nm, suggesting a strong intermolecular aggregation. The thin-film-state absorption illustrates its estimated optical absorption onset wavelength (λedge) to be 920 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†). As a result, the Eoptg value of PT-BTP is 1.35 eV, which is lower than that of the PYF-T derivatives (Fig. S1, ESI†) with the Eoptg values of approximately 1.40 eV. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was applied to the electrochemical workstation to investigate the electrochemical properties (Fig. S9, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of PT-BTP are estimated to be −5.73 and −3.63 eV, respectively. The energy levels of PT-BTP and PM6 as the donor investigated in this work are exhibited in Fig. 2(B). It indicates that the PM6:PT-BTP combination is comfortable for exciton dissociation in BHJ blend. Besides, owing to the efficient molecular stacking of PT-BTP materials, the pristine film of PT-BTP exhibits high electron-only mobility (μe) of 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, calculated from the electron-only device by fitting the dark current density–voltage (J–V) curve to space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S10, ESI†).18

Conventional all-PSC devices with the architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:PT-Y2F active layer/poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-Dimethyl)-N-ethylammoinium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))dibromide (PFN-Br)/Ag, as shown in Fig. 3(A) were then fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the PM6:PT-BTP system. The all-PSCs were fabricated by a spin-coating technique with the PM6:PT-BTP solution in chloroform. The optimal weight ratio of donor:acceptor is 1:1.2, and the optimal total solid weight concentration is 16 mg mL−1. To improve the photovoltaic performance, we used 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) solvent additive and thermal annealing post-treatment to modulate the bulk microstructure of the PM6:PT-BTP active layer. The optimization processes and detailed photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S11, S12 and Tables S2, S3, ESI†) are described in the Experimental section in the ESI.†Fig. 3(B) and (C) exhibit the J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the as-cast and optimized all-PSCs, respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The as-cast devices achieved a PCE of 8.14%, along with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.85 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.22 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 49.82%. After the combination treatments of solvent additive and thermal annealing, the PCE of the devices dramatically increased to 12.13%. In particular, as compared to the as-cast devices, the optimized all-PSC devices show significantly raised JSC and FF values (24.39 mA cm−2 and 58.71%, respectively), mainly benefitting from more efficient charge carrier transport, exciton dissociation and suppressed exciton recombination brought by superior BHJ morphology, which will be discussed below. As depicted in Fig. 3(D), to verify the reliability of device performance, statistical photovoltaic metrics and PCE histogram were obtained from a number of the as-cast and optimized all-PSCs. Additionally, to evaluate the stability of this all-polymer system, we performed light-soaking stability tests on PM6:PT-BTP all-polymer solar cells. Note that we also took the PM6:Y2F-ET system as a control non-fullernee small molecule acceptor-based device. Y2F-ET (namely M1 in Fig. 1) is the monomer of PT-BTP. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the PM6:Y2F-ET devices showed photo-aging induced PCE losses to ca. 40% within 200 hours, while PM6:PT-BTP retained over 80% of its initial PCE. Clearly, compared to the PM6:Y2F-ET control system, the developed PM6:PT-BTP all-polymer system showed markedly enhanced light stability.
The morphologies of the as-cast and optimized blend films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Fig. 3(E) and (F) show the AFM images of the as-cast and optimized PM6:PT-BTP blend films, respectively. The post-annealed blend film has a visibly larger crystal size with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness value of 2.55 nm, compared to the as-cast blend film with an RMS roughness value of 1.67 nm. This result suggests that the post-annealed PM6:PT-BTP film has larger interconnected regions in comparison to the as-cast one.36 The optimized blend film also showed more suitable separated D/A domains with interpenetrating polymer networks, demonstrated by the AFM and TEM images as well as the normalized absorption spectrum (Fig. S14, ESI†), which can effectively facilitate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer, bringing about higher exciton dissociation rate and charge transport properties in relevant devices as discussed below.37,38
To better understand the physical mechanisms of the as-cast and optimized PM6:PT-BTP devices and reveal the effect of differentiated blend morphologies as mentioned above on their photovoltaic performance, we further used steady-state and transient measurements to investigate the relevant physical dynamics of the PM6:PT-BTP system. First, we measured the photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves to study the exciton dissociation process in the relevant devices, as shown in Fig. 4(A). Here, effective voltage (Veff) is defined as Veff = V0 − V, V0 is the short-circuit voltage, and V is the bias voltage applied externally. Jph is calculated by subtracting the dark current density from the light current density. As can be seen from the Jph–Veff curves, the as-cast devices showed a lower saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) and a stronger dependence on bias voltage, which demonstrate less efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties. As a result, the as-cast devices exhibited lower Jsc values in comparison to the optimized all-PSC devices based on PM6:PT-BTP.38 Moreover, the exciton dissociation probability value of the optimized devices is calculated to be 92.45%, much higher than that of the as-cast devices (52.62%).39,40

To shed light on the differences in charge transport properties in the as-cast and optimized active layers, we fabricated electron-only devices and hole-only devices. The calculated electron/hole mobilities are depicted in Fig. 4(B), these values are obtained by fitting the dark electron current density and hole current density curves, as depicted in Fig. S15 (ESI†) for electron-only devices and Fig. S16 (ESI†) for hole-only devices, respectively. The optimized devices have electron mobility (μe) of 7.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, significantly higher than the as-cast devices (4.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and its hole mobility (μh) is also improved, from 4.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results suggest that the optimized devices exhibit better charge transport properties.41 Moreover, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements, which reflect the dwell time of the charge carriers before extracted at the metal electrodes, are employed into studying the charge extraction property in the as-cast and optimized devices. As shown in Fig. 4(C), the optimized PM6:PT-BTP system shows a prominently shorter extraction duration as compared to the as-cast device. The fitted charge extraction times are 0.28 μs for the optimized device and 0.37 μs for the as-cast device. These results illustrate that the optimized active layer shows superior charge transport and extraction properties.
To further analyze the charge recombination mechanisms in these two devices, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, which can evaluate the carrier lifetimes in relevant devices, usually longer lifetime indicates less trap-assisted recombination.42 As shown in Fig. 4(D), the as-cast device showed a carrier lifetime of 5.22 μs when the light intensity was around one sun, whereas the carrier lifetime of the optimized device increased to 6.94 μs at the same light intensity. This may be ascribed to less charge recombination and fewer traps within the optimized active layer, also supported by the above-discussed blend morphology characterizations and the light intensity dependence of the JSC and VOC results. The dependencies of JSC and VOC on light intensity (Plight) are shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†) and Fig. 4(E), respectively. In general, JSC in all-PSCs has a power-law relationship with Plight (JSc ∝ Pαlight, here α is an exponential factor, indicating the bimolecular recombination degree in the charge transfer process).43 It can be found that both the optimized and as-cast devices have α values fairly close to unity (Fig. S17, ESI†), indicating that both systems have negligible bimolecular recombination. Moreover, the VOC is proportional to the natural logarithm of Plight, as described by the expression VOC ∝[nST/q] × [lnPlight], here S is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the thermodynamic temperature of the relevant devices, and q is the charge of a single electron. As shown in Fig. 4(E), the slopes S are calculated from the linear fitting of the VOC − lnPlight plots, the value is 1.71 kT/q for the optimized devices and 1.98 kT/q for the as-cast devices, the higher slope suggests stronger monomolecular recombination and/or trap-assisted recombination in the as-cast devices.44 Besides, we performed Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) measurements to investigate the presence of deep traps in the relevant devices. As presented in Fig. 4(F), we found that the as-cast devices showed a higher density of sub-gap states in the low energy region, indicating substantial deep traps in the as-cast devices. This distinction also explains the Jsc loss in the as-cast devices.44 To sum up, the steady-state and transient physic measurements bear out that the optimized PM6:PT-BTP system has better charge transfer and extraction properties and inhibited charge recombination, thus leading to superior photovoltaic performance.45,46
To study the energy loss in the as-cast and optimized PM6:PT-BTP system, we further analyzed and quantized the energy loss (Eloss) through the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) spectrum and electroluminescence (EL) measurements (Fig. 5(A) for the as-cast system and Fig. 5(B) for the optimized system, respectively).47 According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, the energy losses can be categorized into three different terms as exhibited in eqn (1), (1)

The bandgap (Eg) values of the as-cast and optimized PM6:PT-BTP systems are 1.439 and 1.414 eV, respectively, which are determined by the derivatives of the FTPS-EQE curves as depicted in Fig. S18 (ESI†).48 In theory, the first ΔE1 (Eg − qVSQOC) is the radiative loss above the bandgap. The as-cast and optimized devices showed the same value of 0.25 eV (Table 2). Moreover, the ΔE2(qVSQOC − qVradOC) from the radiative recombination loss depends on the band tail absorption. The as-cast device possesses a smaller ΔE2 of 0.068 eV compared with the optimized devices (0.092 eV). Despite this, the optimized device has a lower Eloss of 0.566 eV as compared with the as-cast device with an Eloss of 0.586 eV. It is because the optimized devices exhibited a smaller non-radiative recombination loss (ΔE3) of 0.227 eV relative to the as-cast devices (ΔE3 = 0.265 eV, Fig. 5(C)). The decreased Eloss of the optimized all-PSCs could be partly owing to the decreased energy disorder.49 Note that this Eloss analysis further demonstrates that the optimized devices exhibit less non-geminate recombination loss as compared to the as-cast PM6:PT-BTP system, also supported by the abovementioned physical measurements.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized a new double-cable polymer acceptor, named PT-BTP, which presents a narrow bandgap of 1.35 eV, a high LUMO energy level as well as high electron mobility, resulting in good photovoltaic performance. The optimal all-PSCs based on PM6:PT-BTP exhibited a PCE of 12.13%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 24.39 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58.71%, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. In contrast, the as-cast devices only displayed a lower PCE of 8.14%, with inferior Jsc and FF values (19.22 mA cm−2 and 49.82%, respectively). The inferior photovoltaic performance of the as-cast system contributed to the worse BHJ morphology, resulting in the inferior exciton dissociation probability and charge collection ability, lower and unbalanced charge transport properties, less effective charge extraction properties and higher carrier recombination loss in the devices. We further demonstrated that the designed all-polymer system has distinctly improved light-stability as compared to the small molecule acceptor Y2F-ET-based system. Overall, this work provides a new design strategy to construct narrow bandgap PSMA materials and demonstrates that the double-cable polymer acceptor PT-BTP with a thiophene-based main chain and a Y6 derivative-based pendant is a promising NIR acceptor for all-PSCs.
