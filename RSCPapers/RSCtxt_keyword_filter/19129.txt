The ground and excited state vibrational relaxation energies were quantitatively characterized. The effective high frequency, ωeff, could be estimated from the variation in energy of the excited-state equilibrium geometries of acceptor and donor sites as well as the analysis of the vibrational modes upon electron transfer. For a PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in an external electric field, the vibronic modes affected the charge separation process differently from the charge recombination process. The simulated results indicated that the vibrational quantum tunneling effect facilitated the charge recombination process to a large extent. Thus, for electron transfer reactions, considering the vibrational excitation influence and perturbed nucleus–electron interactions is essential. These results provide a feasible way to enhance the efficiency in yielding the electron transfer process products.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing interest due to the promising flexibility of their chemical and physical properties. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is a key factor in determining the potential commercialization of PSCs, and values exceeding 10% have been achieved by improving the material chemical structure and optimizing the PSC architectures.1,2 Many efforts have been dedicated to further enhancing their macroscopic performances. For example, Maldonado et al. improved the short circuit current in photoconductor doped PSCs under an external electric field (Fext).3 By introducing magnetic nanoparticles and orientating their alignment in bulk heterojunction PSCs using an external magnetostatic field, PCE enhancements higher than 50% were obtained.4 An in-depth understanding of the photochemical and photophysical phenomena involved in PSC operation is essential for developing new functional materials with higher conversion efficiencies, which will lead to device commercialization in the near future.
The light-driven electron transfer (ET) reaction dynamics at the electron donor/acceptor (D/A) interface is at the heart of light-to-current conversion efficiency for all PSCs.5,6 To improve the ET efficiency from the donor to the acceptor in solar cell devices, thus increasing the short-circuit or external quantum efficiency, the photogenerated excitons should be separated as far as possible from each other. Concurrently, the reverse process, i.e., charge recombination (CR), should be inhibited. Under short-circuit conditions, an internal electric field ensures absolute charge separation (CS); thus, an ideal cell with no CR is realized. However, in a real solar cell device, the photocurrent is reduced, owing to the occurrence of the CR process. Numerous studies have investigated the operation mechanisms of PSCs, especially the competition between CS and CR excited-state dynamics; however, there is no universal consensus on the mechanism behind the interfacial ET reaction.7,8 The CS, as well as the CR, involves an electron transfer reaction. The rate can be precisely estimated by using the weak coupling limited semiclassical Marcus theory:9 (1) where Vda is the electronic coupling integral, λ is the reorganization energy, and ΔG is the free energy variation of the ET reaction. For the forward ET reaction, λ = λCS and ΔG = ΔGCS are assumed for simulating the CS rate. Similarly, for the backward ET reaction, λ = λCR and ΔG = ΔGCR are assumed to simulate the CR rate.
The Marcus theory embraces the classical low-frequency harmonic oscillation assumption (ħω ≪ kBT), presuming that the ET reaction leads from the excited Franck–Condon (FC) electronic excited state to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) electronic excited state, without considering the vibrational quantum effect.10,11 In other words, the Marcus rate model assumes that the electron transfer must take place from a transition state of this unstable molecule, and under low temperature conditions, it ignores the tunneling effects assisting the electron transfer process. However, electronic excitation of a molecule populates a vibrationally hot ICT manifold in the high frequency regime. Hot vibrational energy levels should be considered in the electronic excited states.12 Upon photoexcitation, the “vibrationally hot” FC electronic excited state is populated. Following the vibrational relaxation, these excess vibrational energies are rapidly lost, and the ET reaction proceeds to a more stable ICT electronic excited state with populated hot vibrational energy levels. Meanwhile, the relaxation of the excited-state configuration, as well as nuclear rearrangement, occurs.13 This indicates that the complete comprehension of the ET mechanism requires detailed information on the distributions of vibrational states and their relaxation. As a development of the Marcus theory, the Marcus–Levich–Jortner ET rate expression emphasizes the vibrationally quantized ET reaction. This formalism introduces the population of the vibrational state density in the initial reactant and final product, i.e., the FC and ICT electronic states. Their further overlap indicates the involvement of the vibrational quantum tunneling effect in its rate expression in the high frequency regime (ħω ≫ kBT):11,14,15 (2) where λs is the outer reorganization energy. The Huang–Rhys factor S characterizes the electron-vibration coupling, which is directly related to the inner reorganization energy λi.16 This expression considers all molecular vibronic modes with frequencies ω by summing up the possible vibrational energy levels v. Previous studies have also indicated that the effective high-frequency mode mainly contributes to renormalize the Vda parameter.17 The ET reaction efficiency is found to be significantly regulated by the vibration-resolved quantum state of the reactant, as revealed by the infrared (IR) vibrational-state resolution spectroscopy results.18 Furthermore, the dependence of the charge transfer rate on the electric field, charge carrier density, and so on, was determined by considering nuclear tunneling. And the results suggested that nuclear tunneling, unlike other semiclassical models, is a generic process that describes charge transport in organic semiconductors.19 Vibrational excitation influence and perturbed nucleus–electron interactions must be considered when analyzing electron transfer reactions. This provides a feasible way to enhance the efficiency in yielding the electron transfer process products.8
In this paper, we theoretically investigated the vibrational quantum tunneling effect by controlling the rate of the photoinduced electron transfer reaction in an organic conjugated D⋯A system. In this study, a PCDTBT:PC70BM photoactive layer was selected as the model, owing to its excellent performance in PSCs. Furthermore, the influence of the external electric field, which is generated from the counter electrode in real solar cells, was considered, as this is another factor affecting the ET reaction rate in solar cell devices.
2. Theoretical methods
All quantum chemical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software.20 The ground-state equilibrium geometries and frequency analyses of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend and isolated PC70BM and PCDTBT materials were optimized using density functional theory (DFT)21 with the B3LYP functional22,23 and the 6-31G(D) basis set. The electronic transitions, geometry optimization, and frequency analysis of the lowest excited state of PCDTBT:PC70BM were investigated with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT),24 long-range-corrected functional (CAM-B3LYP),25 and 6-31G(D) basis set. To investigate the effect of the external electric field on the properties of the excited state of the molecules, the finite field method was employed; electric fields ranging from −20 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 a.u. were used. These values can be compared with the real strength of the electric field in solar cell devices, which reaches 4 × 10−5 a.u. (∼2 × 107 V m−1).26 This field in a real solar cell can actually be oriented in all possible directions with respect to the polymer–fullerene interface. However, the external electric field can regulate the orientation of the molecular systems with the expectation that most of the molecules will obey a statistical oriented distribution in a special direction under the influence of external conditions. So the direction of the electric field is set from PCDTBT to PC70BM.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Vibrational relaxation analyses of ground and excited states
For simplicity of discussion here, only a single effective vibrational degree of freedom is counted for the reaction coordinate (i.e. a single effective quantum mode with effective high-frequency ωeff is identified) in simulating the ET rate by using eqn (2). No additional modes need to be explicitly considered.27 As shown in eqn (2), based on the assumption that models are only displaced without frequency changes and Duschinsky mixings,28 classically treated low-frequency vibrations can be included in λs. The quantum mechanically treated high-frequency mode of energy ħω is related to the inner reorganization energy, and λi describes the geometry changes of the acceptor and donor moieties following the ET process.17 The effective quantum mode provides the main contributions for estimating λi in the ET reaction.
The relationship between the Huang–Rhys factor, the corresponding frequency modes j of the molecule (with frequency ωj), and the inner reorganization energy can be expressed as: (3)
The effective Huang–Rhys factor can be defined by the effective high-frequency ωeff using the relationship . In the following, the single effective high-frequency mode of energy ħωeff and the corresponding Seff are used in eqn (2) for simulating the rate of CS and CR quantitatively.
The detailed distributions of vibrational states and their relaxation are pivotal factors to develop a complete understanding of the ET reaction mechanism. Following the qualitative vibration–relaxation-related potential energy curves shown in Fig. 1, to quantitatively characterize the excited vibrational relaxation energy and investigate its dependence on Fext, we optimized the ground- and excited-state geometries at different external electric field strengths. Thus, the vibrational relaxation energies of the ground state (Egvr) could be obtained by the difference in energy between optimized excited- and ground-state geometries. Additionally introducing the electronic transitions in absorption (Eab) and fluorescence (Efl), the excited vibrational relaxation energy was obtained by: Eevr = Eab − Efl − Egvr.(4)

As a result, the effective high-frequency ωeff could be estimated from the excited equilibrium geometry energy change of the acceptor and donor sites upon ET. The calculated vibrational relaxation energies of the ground and excited states at different Fext strengths are shown in Fig. 2. According to our calculated results, the values of both excited-state (∼0.205 eV) and ground-state (∼0.187 eV) vibrational relaxation energies are insensitive to Fext. This agrees well with the Fext controlled inner reorganization energy λi of the PCDTBT:PC70BM molecule, as our previous study demonstrated.29

A previous study has revealed that the distribution of λi varies with the normal vibrational modes, and the main CC bond stretching vibrations, peaked at 1400–1600 cm−1 (0.17–0.20 eV) in IR spectra, account for λi of the P3HT:PCBM blend.27 As a result, ωeff was equal to 1500 cm−1, and the corresponding Seff was calculated to be 1.366.27 Taking phthalocyanine–perylene as the model molecule, the CC bond stretching vibration with a typical energy of 0.20 eV was also proven to act as the single effective frequency (ωeff) in a conjugated system.16 Most importantly, the ET rate was found to increase only by a factor of 5 upon varying the vibrational energy of ωeff from 0.15 to 0.20 eV in carbon-based conjugated skeletons.30

Fig. 3 shows the theoretically simulated IR spectra of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend without Fext (i.e., Fext = 0). Strong IR peaks were clearly observed for ω < 1400 cm−1 and ω > 1600 cm−1. A detailed analysis of Fig. 4 revealed that these vibrational modes could be mainly attributed to the vibration of the butyric acid methyl ester part of PC70BM, which is far from the interface between D (PCDTBT) and A (PC70) in spatial distance and do not contribute to the electron transfer between the donor and the acceptor. Similar to the recent study,27 the calculated IR spectrum also shows strong vibrational peaks at ω ≈ 1400–1600 cm−1 (1489 and 1533 cm−1), which are attributed to the CC bond stretching between the conjugated PCDTBT and PC70 skeleton interface (see Fig. 3 and 4). These vibrational modes are responsible for the electron transfer process in the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend, and should be used in eqn (2) for calculating the CS and CR rates. This is because the excitons created by the light photons dissociate if they diffuse towards the interface. At the interface, an electron transfer process happens in reality due to the different electric potentials (about 1 eV) of D and A materials. Then the electron and hole slightly separated at the interface have to overcome a Coulombic attraction force, in order to reach the electrodes and to contribute to the photovoltage. As mentioned above, only a single effective quantum mode is considered in this work, therefore, the selected effective frequency was assigned to the averaged value of the IR bands from 1400 to 1600 cm−1. And in our calculations, ωeff was set to 1500 cm−1, while the Seff values were 1.004 and 1.105 for CR and CS, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Fext on ωeff; the theoretically simulated IR spectra at different Fext strengths exhibited almost unchanged peaks, both in position and intensity, even at Fext = ±1 × 108 V m−1 (larger than the strength observed in PSC devices, i.e., ∼2 × 107 V m−1). There are two possible reasons for this result. One is that the bias of Fext is perpendicular to the orientation of PCDTBT, while the vibrational modes at ∼1500 cm−1 align along the PCDTBT orientation, that is Fext is perpendicular to the vibrational modes. The second reason is that PC70BM has a symmetric spherical structure, which is believed to be indestructible under the influence of Fext. As further analyzed subsequently, this selection did not change the variation tendency of kCR and kCSvs.Fext. As a result, we reached the conclusion that selecting the ωeff value of 1500 cm−1 was appropriate for providing relatively exact theoretical kCR and kCS results for the investigated PCDTBT:PC70BM blend.

 Fig. 4  Selection of active vibrational modes of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend; vibrational frequencies (cm−1) are also shown. The direction of the external electric field from PCDTBT to PC70BM is indicated. 
Notably, the approximation of selecting a single effective vibrational mode may limit the precision. The involvement of more vibrational modes, or all modes, in principle, without forcing the system to be described by a single effective-mode in eqn (2), in performing the calculation may be useful to some extent.15,31 It is technically possible to compute completely converged FC lineshapes for hundreds of normal modes by considering Duschinsky effects and thermal excitations. If achieved, the complete vibration resolved electronic spectra could be obtained, which will be of great convenience for a detailed investigation of the mechanism of the vibronic quantized tunneling controlled electron transfer in organic conjugated D⋯A systems.
3.2 External electric field dependent vibration-resolved rates of CS and CR processes
Previous studies have indicated that the effective high frequency and external electric field can significantly influence the three key parameters, i.e. Vda, λ and ΔG, as well as the rates of CR and CS.8,16,17,26,29 This requires casting them into the contributions for investigating the forward CS reactions and the backward CR reaction. All the calculations on these parameters were performed by using identical methods to those in previous studies.26,29 As can be seen from Table 1, the ΔG values for charge separation and charge recombination present opposite variation tendency with the external electric field strength. The increasing of the absolute value of ΔGCS with increasing strength of Fext along its direction indicates that the change in the permanent dipole moment upon electronic transition induced by Fext leads to orientation-dependent photoinduced electron transfer kinetics of the complex molecular systems. And the oriented driven-force for charge separation along the direction of Fext is enhanced. It is found that the effect of Fext on λs is larger than that of λi. The electronic coupling, Vda, was calculated using the Generalized Mulliken Hush (GMH) approach in this work. A detailed analysis reveals that the calculated transition dipole and the difference of stationary electric dipole moments of the two adiabatic states are both approximately along the direction of Fext. This indicates the validity of the GMH method used for the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend here, according to the general diabatization scheme with Boys localization.32 For Vda, the electronic coupling for the CR process is found to be more significantly affected by Fext than that of the CS process (see Table 1). The values of Vda are smaller when the electric field is in the opposite direction, which again suggests that the orientation of Fext with respect to the molecule should be considered. The fact that electronic coupling increases with Fext indicates that the external electric field can increase the charge transfer efficiency in the oriented system.

By introducing the Fext dependent parameters (Table 1) into the Marcus–Levich–Jortner picture of electron transfer, the vibration-resolved CS and CR rates of the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend in the lowest ICT excited-state, at different Fext strengths, can be obtained. As clearly seen in Fig. 5(a), for the forward ET reaction, the CS process is significantly accelerated under the bias of Fext along the direction of the ET reaction. According to our previous study, the electric field favors the photogenerated excitons, overcoming the Coulombic attraction.29 Most importantly, the kCS value in the low-frequency region is clearly larger than that in the high-frequency region, over the whole Fext range from −2.0 × 10−5 to 20 × 10−5 a.u. This indicates that the semiclassical Marcus theory (valid only in the low-frequency regime and under weak electronic coupling interaction conditions) overestimates the forward ET reaction process. It mainly originated from the fact that the semiclassical Marcus rate model ignores the tunneling effects assisting the ET process in the high frequency regime. However, the CS process driven by electron-vibration interactions, discussed here, actually occurs in the excited state. The discrete vibrationally coupled electronic states are simplified to the state with only a single effective vibrational quantum mode for presenting the vibronic quantized effect. The Marcus theory does not work for the excited state vibrational relaxation process.

Previous studies have revealed that the charge separation probability will be enhanced from the “vibrationally hot” localized interfacial states.33,34 As a result, the CS process from the “vibrationally hot” Franck–Condon state with high frequency vibrational modes will be accelerated. However, our calculated CS rate produced a contrary result, that is, the rate of CS decreases when the high frequency vibrational modes are involved. It should be noted that, as shown in Fig. 1, the molecule is first excited to the “vibrationally hot” Franck–Condon state, from which the relaxation of the “vibrationally hot” electronic excited state takes place simultaneously along with the configuration relaxation, nuclear rearrangement (vibrational energy relaxation) and electron transfer through electron-vibration coupling between the FC state and the ICT state.17 It relates not only to the CS process, but also to its inverse process, i.e., the CR process. Thus, the vibrational contribution to the CR process must be considered, which is thermodynamically favored. The calculated rate of the CR process significantly increases in the high-frequency vibrational region, as can be seen from Fig. 5(b). The ultrafast relaxation from the high vibrational energy level to its corresponding lower vibrational energy level in the FC state competes with the nonradiative CS process from the high vibrational energy level of the FC state to those of the ICT state. This causes the decrease in the rate of CS in the high-frequency region. Moreover, the vibrational quantum tunneling effect in the CS process is expected to be inconspicuous. This is mainly because the whole equilibrium geometry changes following the CS process, and the energy of the ICT state is relatively lower than that of the FC state. The interaction between the corresponding high vibrational energy levels of the FC state and ICT state is weakened.
However, the vibrational quantum tunneling effect evidently occurs in the CR process, owing to the massive overlapping of the low vibrational levels of the FC state with the high vibrational energy levels of the ICT state. This provides an effective channel for promoting the backward ET reaction, which is in accordance with the calculated values of Vda in the CR process larger than those in the CS process (see Table 1), and results in the acceleration of the CR rate and further decrease of the CS rate in the high-frequency region. Notably, the vibrational energy also relaxes in the ICT electronic excited state, which will decrease the CR efficiency. This accurately explains why the whole CR rate is lower than the CS rate.
The calculated rate of the CR process is so small that it can be neglected when compared with the corresponding rate of CS in the low-frequency region (Fig. 5(b)). This originates from the fact that, in the low-frequency vibrational region, the vibration-quantized Marcus–Levich–Jortner formalism degenerates to the semiclassical Marcus expression, under the classical harmonic oscillation assumption. Only the changes in the electronic and nuclear polarizations following the electron transfer process are considered. In this case, the energy of the equilibrium geometry in the ICT state is lowered, and the reaction energy barrier for the CS process is largely reduced (see Fig. 1). As a result, the CR process is suppressed, and the rate of CS is overestimated. This is in good agreement with the above analysis.
Thus, in conclusion, upon photoexcitation, the “vibrationally hot” FC electronic state is populated; following the vibrational energy relaxation in the FC state, a rapid CS process with electron transfers from the donor to the acceptor and excited state configuration relaxation occurs. Subsequently, the vibrational quantum tunneling effect facilitates the CR process assisting the mutual Coulombic attraction between photogenerated charges. Meanwhile, the loss of excess vibrational energy in the ICT electronic excited state is also responsible for inhibiting CR. Finally, the complete CS state is formed, from which the electron transfer further progresses.
Referring to the above section analysis, selecting an effective high frequency (ωeff = 1500 cm−1) is expected to provide relatively exact theoretical values for kCR and kCS of the PCDTBT:PC70BM solar cell material in an external electric field. By setting ωeff to 1500 cm−1, kCR and kCS were calculated using the Marcus and Marcus–Levich–Jortner equations, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the low-frequency approximate semiclassical Marcus theory overestimates the CS rate by approximately one order of magnitude. Most importantly, the Marcus theory is found to underestimate the CR rate by approximately at least four orders of magnitude. Reasonably, it is inappropriate for the tunneling effect assisted ET reaction process in the low-frequency approximation (ħω ≪ kBT). Thus, for ET reactions, it is essential to consider the influence of the vibrational excitation and perturbed nucleus–electron interactions. As a result, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the vibration-resolved Marcus–Levich–Jortner theory by obtaining more accurately calculated values of kCR and kCS. In detail, the typical time scales for simulated CS rate are commensurate with the quenching step of the “vibrationally hot” electronic states13 and the appropriate time scales appropriately describing the backward ET reaction process.

4. Conclusion
We analyzed the vibration-resolved rate of photoinduced electron transfer for an organic conjugated D⋯A system in an external electric field. The vibrational relaxation energies of the ground and excited states were quantitatively characterized, which was insensitive to the external electric field. The calculated kCS and kCR values, in the lowest ICT excited state, were obviously affected by the bias and strength of Fext and vibrational modes v. The vibration-resolved ET process is critical for correctly estimating the CS and CR rates. In particular, for accelerating the CR process, the vibrational quantum tunneling effect significantly revealed itself, assisted by the mutual Coulombic attraction between photogenerated charges. Generally speaking, within the framework of “hot exciton” generation, the CS process favours low frequency while the CR process favours high frequency modes due to the limitation of the semiclassical treatment in the Marcus theory. The effective high-frequency ωeff could be estimated from the excited equilibrium geometry energy change of the acceptor and donor sites upon ET. Selecting the appropriate value for the effective high frequency (ωeff = 1500 cm−1) provided relatively exact theoretical kCR and kCS values for the PCDTBT:PC70BM blend. In conclusion, considering the vibration effects in the calculations provided good agreement with the experimental results.
