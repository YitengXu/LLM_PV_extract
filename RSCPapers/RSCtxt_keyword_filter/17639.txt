    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 21st September 2020AbstractThe favorable contact and matching energy level at the electrode/perovskite interface as well as the high-quality perovskite film are prerequisites for high photovoltaic performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an innovative interface engineering strategy has been proposed to modify TiO2 as well as the perovskite film simultaneously by introducing ammonium chloride (AC), which not only improves the contact and energy level matching at the TiO2/perovskite interface but also provides a high-quality perovskite film with larger grain size by regulating the crystallization kinetics of CsPbBr3. Furthermore, chlorine anions in AC tend to combine with TiO2 to passivate its surface defects; the ammonium cation can bond with the uncoordinated ionic defects of perovskite. As a result, a remarkably enhanced charge extraction and retarded charge recombination within inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs is acquired through the interface engineering of AC, and the power conversion efficiency of the modified device is increased from the original 6.59% to 9.60%. By compensating the energy level at the perovskite/carbon interface by setting an efficient hole-transporting layer of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), the best efficiency up to 10.12% was achieved for the device with AC and ZnPc interface modification, which is much higher than 7.87% efficiency for the ZnPc-only PSCs, further demonstrating the important positive effects of AC modification on device performance. Moreover, the optimized device without any encapsulation presents an exceptional long-term stability under persistent attack by 80% RH air atmosphere at 25 °C for 720 h.
Introduction
Perovskite semiconductor materials have attracted worldwide attention because of their excellent optoelectronic characteristics, such as the adjustable band gap, wide absorption spectrum response, long intrinsic photo-carrier diffusion length, and high carrier mobility.1–4 Moreover, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 25.2% in the past decade,5 which is a miracle in the history of photovoltaics. However, the instability issues caused by the sensitivity of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite structure on ambient exposure, thermal attack, and other harsh environments seriously limit the commercialization and practical application of PSCs.6–9 Recent reports have demonstrated that the replacement of organic HC(NH2)2+ (FA+) ions or CH3NH3+ (MA+) ions with inorganic cesium (Cs+) ions to fabricate the all-inorganic CsPbBrxI3−x (x = 0, 1, 2, or 3) perovskite light-absorption layer is an effective method to enhance the long-term stability of the corresponding solar cells.10,11 Among the types of all-inorganic CsPbBrxI3−x perovskites, CsPbI3 has the most suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV for light-harvesting over a wide spectral range to obtain a relatively high-efficiency PSC with good thermal stability; however, its perovskite structure is extremely unstable and prone to degradation in air atmosphere, and especially at room temperature, it is transformed from the perovskite cubic phase to the non-perovskite orthogonal phase.12 In addition, although CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 have narrower band gaps (1.91 eV and 2.05 eV, respectively) and favorable structural stability at room temperature, they still suffer from decomposition in ambient air and humidity, which makes it difficult to meet the stability requirements in commercial production.13–17 Fortunately, the fully brominated CsPbBr3 PSCs with excellent long-term moisture and thermal resistance, which can be prepared in an air atmosphere without any humidity control, are considered to be the most promising candidates to overcome the problem of poor long-term stability and to obtain high efficiency of PSCs; therefore, they are receiving extensive attention from researchers.18–20 However, the PCE of the classic carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs without a hole-transporting layer (HTL) is far lower than that of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.12 A bandgap as high as 2.3 eV for CsPbBr3, leading to a narrow absorption wavelength below 550 nm and serious charge recombination as well as energy loss inside the device caused by substantial trap states and interfacial energy level barrier, are the fundamental reasons behind the lower efficiency of CsPbBr3 PSCs.21–23 As described above, studies have shown that the bandgap of CsPbBr3 can be reduced to 1.73–2.05 eV by replacing the bromide ions partially with iodine ions for expanded spectral absorption wavelength as well as enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE outputs; however, it pays an unacceptable price due to the deterioration of the perovskite's structural stability.24–26 Therefore, the reduction of charge recombination and energy loss is widely regarded as the most suitable and effective strategy to enhance the efficiency output of carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSCs.
It is generally known that massive vacancy defects on the TiO2 film's surface lead to unsatisfactory electron extraction and a rough surface easily makes imperfect contact between TiO2 and the perovskite layer, which would cause acute charge recombination at the interface and directly affect the crystallization process and quality of the perovskite film deposited on the TiO2.27–29 In addition, the low-quality perovskite films with substantial grain boundaries and trap states seriously suppress the separation and transport of the photogenerated electrons–holes, which also brings about a prominent hysteresis effect and significantly limits the PCE output of the solar cells.3,21,22 This shows that improving the TiO2 film quality and interfacial contact is particularly important for reducing charge recombination and enhancing the comprehensive performance of the PSCs. Recently, interface modification between TiO2 and perovskite has been deeply explored in the aspects of interfacial contact and defect passivation. For instance, Zhang et al. devised a new interfacial modification strategy using dopamine-capped TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron-transporting layer (ETL) to the passivate surface defects and to improve interface binding with the perovskite film, which substantially mitigated charge recombination and energy loss inside the PSCs, leading to a PCE of nearly 21% for the corresponding PSCs.30 Shih et al. introduced glycine as a coupling agent to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface in order to achieve decreased trap state density as well as excellent interfacial contact, which efficiently promoted charge transfer and suppressed charge recombination so as to boost the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.31 Zhang et al. successfully improved the TiO2/perovskite interface contact and passivated the interfacial trap states for enhanced PCE of PSCs by interface engineering with the introduction of the amino acid coupling agent, 4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-aminobutyric acid.32 In particular, recent studies have verified that the modification of ammonium halides on SnO2 or ZnO ETLs can simultaneously passivate the surface defects of such ETLs and improve the energy level alignment between the ETL and the perovskite, leading to effectively retarded charge recombination and accelerated charge extraction for the improved efficiency and stability of the PSCs.33–35
Inspired by previous research, a creative and effective interface modification strategy has been proposed to introduce ammonium chloride (AC), a common and stable ionic ammonium halide, at the TiO2 surface to simultaneously passivate numerous defect states and to improve the contact and energy level matching at the TiO2/perovskite interface, and to enhance the perovskite film's quality. On modifying AC, the roughness of TiO2 is reduced and the conduction band is increased to improve the contact and energy level alignment with the subsequently deposited perovskite film. In addition, chlorine in AC tends to combine with TiO2 to passivate its surface defects and the ammonium cation can bond with the uncoordinated ions to regulate the crystallization process for obtaining the higher-quality perovskite film with reduced trap states density and enlarged grain size. As a result, the PCE of carbon-based HTL-free CsPbBr3 PSCs with AC modification is significantly enhanced to 9.60% from 6.59% efficiency of the control device owing to accelerated charge extraction as well as transportation and suppressed charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Considering that the large energy level barrier at the perovskite/carbon interface and the insufficient hole selectivity of the carbon electrode also limits the hole extraction and efficiency enhancement, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) with the closest highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the valence band of CsPbBr3, which has been reported in our previous work,23 with high hole mobility and low cost is deposited on the perovskite film's surface as a HTL to compensate the energy level and to promote hole extraction. As expected, the charge recombination and energy loss within the device are more evidently decreased, and the best PCE up to 10.12% with a JSC of 7.64 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.606 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.47% is achieved for the PSC with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/AC/CsPbBr3/ZnPc/carbon, which is substantially increased in comparison with the 7.87% efficiency (JSC: 6.91 mA cm−2, VOC: 1.511 V, FF: 75.38%) for only the ZnPc tailored device, further illustrating that AC modification has a crucial effect on the performance enhancement of the PSCs. Moreover, the optimized PSC without any encapsulation displays a superior long-term stability under persistent attack by 80% RH at 25 °C for 720 h. All the results demonstrate a promising strategy to improve the charge extraction and to suppress the charge recombination in order to build efficient and stable PSCs through the interface engineering of introducing AC.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
AC and ZnPc were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Co., Ltd. and Macleans, respectively. Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%) and lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Carbon paste was purchased from Shanghai Mater Win New Materials Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were directly used without any purification.
Preparation process of the TiO2 colloid
TiO2 colloid was prepared by the sol-hydrothermal method. First, titanium tetrabutanolate (10 mL) was added dropwise to deionized water (100 mL) with continuous stirring to obtain the white powder. Then, 0.8 mL nitric acid and 10 mL acetic acid were dripped onto the prepared powder and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Distilled water (140 mL) was added in the above Erlenmeyer flask and stirred for 25 min. When the reactants became translucent, the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 200 °C for 12 h. Then, 0.4 g commercial P25 was added into the product, sonicated for 30 min, and then heated for 11 h at 180 °C. Finally, 1 mL OP emulsifier and 0.8 g polyethylene glycol (PEG 20000) were introduced into the above colloid, and then concentrated to 40 mL at 80 °C to obtain the TiO2 colloid.
Fabrication of the perovskite solar cells
All the processes for assembling the PSCs were conducted in an air atmosphere free of any humidity protection. The FTO-coated conductive glass was firstly etched with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid, followed by cyclic-washing with deionized water and ethanol for 5 times, and then ultrasonic cleaning was performed in an ultrasonic machine for 25 min. The mixed ethanolic solution of 0.5 M diethanolamine and 0.5 M titanium isopropoxide were deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate (30 s, 7000 rpm), followed by annealing in air at 500 °C for 110 min to obtain the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer. The mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer was deposited by spin-coating the TiO2 colloid (30 s, 2000 rpm) and annealing it in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the mesoscopic TiO2 film substrate was immersed in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 25 min and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then annealed at 450 °C for another 30 min to obtain the TiO2 photoanode. In this work, ethanolic solutions with different concentrations of AC (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1) were deposited on the TiO2 photoanode (30 s, 2000 rpm) and annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min to achieve interfacial modification. The perovskite film was fabricated by the multi-step solution-processed technique. Firstly, 1 M PbBr2 in DMF solution was spin-coated on FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 without or with the AC film (30 s, 2000 rpm) and annealed at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, CsBr in methanol solution was spin-coated on the PbBr2 film (30 s, 2000 rpm) and annealed at 250 °C for 6 min. This step was repeated 7 times to prepare the uniform and dense CsPbBr3 perovskite film. Finally, the conductive carbon slurry was coated on the CsPbBr3 film by the scraper technique and then heated at 120 °C for 10 min. For the preparation of ZnPc HTL, 5 mg mL−1 ZnPc in chlorobenzene solution was firstly obtained by dissolving 30 mg of ZnPc in 6 mL of chlorobenzene under ultrasound treatment for 0.5 h, then 90 μL of the above solution was spin-coated on the CsPbBr3 film (30 s, 2000 rpm) and heated at 200 °C for 10 min, and finally coated with carbon electrodes according to the previous steps.
Measurements and characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the RBD-upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (PerkinElmer) with MgKα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). The top-view SEM images and EDS mapping images of the TiO2 film were obtained by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8220, Hitachi). The top-view SEM images of the perovskite films and the cross-sectional SEM image of the device were also obtained by the above FESEM instrument. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of different TiO2 samples were recorded on an Innova Scanning Probe Microscope 9700 (Shimadzu, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PbBr2 and various perovskite films were obtained via using a PHILIPS PW1800 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) transmission and the absorption spectra of various samples were obtained using a Meipuda UV-3200 spectrophotometer. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were measured under simulated solar light intensity at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). The IPCE spectra of various PSCs, in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm, were conducted with a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920). The time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL) characterization and the corresponding steady-state photoluminescence spectra of all samples were obtained using a Horiba spectrometer (excited by 510 nm laser) and a FLS920 spectrofluorometer under 385 nm wavelength excitation, respectively. The trap states density of the perovskite films was measured with a space-charge limited current (SCLC) model through the Mott–Gurney law by constructing the electron-only PSCs recorded from 0 to 7 V in the dark. The dark J–V curves of various devices were characterized (voltage range of −1.5 to 1.5 V) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) characterization was performed at a frequency of 5 kHz (with an amplitude of 30 mV) in the dark condition under the corresponding bias voltages.
Results and discussion
In this work, the introduction of the AC-modified layer at the TiO2/perovskite interface can simultaneously passivate numerous surface defect states on m-TiO2 as well as the perovskite film and favor the formation of a higher-quality perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 1a, Cl in AC tends to combine with TiO2 to form stable chemical states and to the passivate surface defects by filling the oxygen vacancies,36 thereby improving the quality of the TiO2 film, which facilitates the enhancement in the electron mobility inside the device and the PCE output. In addition, the ammonium cation can bond with the uncoordinated lead and cesium ion defects on the perovskite film's surface to suppress the defect induced non-radiative recombination for improved charge extraction. The XPS spectra of various samples were obtained to explore the interaction and elemental composition at the TiO2/perovskite interface after introducing AC. Above all, two characteristic peaks of AC (N 1s and Cl 2p) can be observed at approximately 400 eV and 200 eV in Fig. S1,† respectively, indicating that AC has been successfully incorporated into the m-TiO2 surface. As presented in Fig. 1b, both the characteristic peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 for the TiO2/AC film shift to lower binding energies compared to those for the control TiO2 film, demonstrating the combination of Cl and Ti, taking into consideration that the bond energy of Ti–O is higher than that of Ti–Cl.37,38 In addition, compared to the control sample, the slight shift in all the O 1s characteristic peaks for the TiO2/AC sample to lower bonding energies in Fig. 1c implies that the electronic structure of the TiO2 film surface is indeed affected by the AC-modified layer.39 In order to explore the influence of AC modification on the oxygen vacancy reduction in TiO2, Fig. S2† displays the deconvoluted O 1s XPS spectra of different TiO2 films. The lower and higher binding-energy peaks are associated with the TiIV–O bond and the Ti–hydroxyl bond as well as the oxygen-vacancy defects, respectively. The area ratio of the two peaks (Ti–hydroxyl:TiIV–O bond) in the O 1s spectrum is obviously decreased from 15:85 to 10:90 after introducing the AC modifier, demonstrating reduced oxygen vacancy defects of TiO2 due to the passivation of chlorine. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1d and e, the XPS characterization of different perovskite films is performed to investigate the interaction between AC and the perovskite film. For the control CsPbBr3 film, it can be clearly observed that the characteristic peaks of Pb 4f are located at 138.72 eV and 143.60 eV (corresponding to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2) and the peaks of Cs 3d lie at 724.32 eV and 738.25 eV (associated with Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2), respectively. After introducing AC for interface modification, all the above peaks shift to lower binding energies. Such a shift in the Pb 4f and Cs 3d characteristic peak positions indicates the enhanced electron cloud density and reduced electron affinity,40 demonstrating that Pb and Cs atoms accepted more electrons by coordinating with AC, and also confirming the surface cation defects passivation by AC. Predictably, the deposition of AC on the TiO2/perovskite interface can simultaneously passivate numerous surface defects of TiO2 and the perovskite film for achieving solar cells with superior photovoltaic performance.

To more directly prove the effect of the AC-modified layer on the surface morphology of m-TiO2 and the crystallization process of perovskite, the top-view SEM images of different m-TiO2 as well as the PbBr2 films with or without AC modification are characterized and presented in Fig. 2. Compared to the control m-TiO2 film in Fig. 2a, the mesoporous structure of the AC-modified m-TiO2 (Fig. 2b) is not changed, only the surface of the TiO2 particles is covered with a layer of AC. Such a mesoporous structure of the ETLs ensures large area contact with the perovskite film to boost electron extraction and transfer. The EDS mapping images of the TiO2/AC sample are presented in Fig. S3† to explore the coverage of AC on the m-TiO2 surface; N and Cl from AC, and Ti and O from m-TiO2 are evenly distributed without any obvious phase separation, indicating that AC has been homogeneously deposited on the m-TiO2 film as a multifunctional modified layer. In addition, to study the surface roughness of the m-TiO2 film with and without AC, the AFM images of different TiO2 samples are characterized and shown in Fig. S4.† The lower RMS value of 18.8 nm for the AC-modified m-TiO2 film in comparison with 22.3 nm for the control m-TiO2 film indicates reduced roughness of the former film, which is beneficial for improving contact with the subsequently deposited perovskite film and thereby to reduce the interfacial contact resistance for enhanced extraction and transfer of electrons. As shown in Fig. 2c, both the TiO2 films display excellent light transmittance in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, demonstrating that the AC-modified layer on the TiO2 surface does not change the transmission of light, which ensures the sufficient absorption of photons by the perovskite film. Moreover, the contact angle of DMF on the control and the m-TiO2/AC samples are shown in Fig. S5;† apparently, the increased contact angle of 16.5° for the AC-modified m-TiO2 film compared to 7.1° for the control film suggests the decreased wettability of DMF on the m-TiO2/AC surface, which is beneficial for reducing the nucleation sites of the PbBr2 precursor solution and therefore the perovskite to sequentially increase the grain size of the CsPbBr3 films (Fig. 3a).41 The PbBr2 film deposited on AC (Fig. 2e) exhibits a fully-covered and loose morphology with more uniform voids in comparison with that of the control PbBr2 film (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, compared to the control film in Fig. 2f, the AC/PbBr2 film presents a lower characteristic diffraction peak intensity and larger full width at half maximum (FWHM) (Table S1†) of the PbBr2 phase, showing that the introduction of AC decreases the crystallinity of PbBr2 mainly because the combination of AC and Pb2+ delays the crystallization of the PbBr2 film, which thus results in a loosely structured film with low crystallinity and more voids in Fig. 2e. Such structural characteristics of the PbBr2 film are favorable for the diffusion of the next deposited CsBr solution, therefore, leading to the sufficient growth of the perovskite phase to form a higher-quality perovskite film with a larger grain size, higher crystallinity, and lower trap states density.21

(d) The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films deposited on various layers. 
To better explore the effect of AC on the perovskite film quality, a series of characterization studies were carried out and are presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a displays the top-view SEM images of the control and the CsPbBr3 films deposited on m-TiO2 modified with AC at different concentrations and the average grain size distribution statistical histogram of various perovskite films. Evidently, the control CsPbBr3 film with an uneven and small average grain size of 560 nm has numerous grain boundaries and pinholes, which become the central sites of current leakage and charge recombination to result in a lower JSC and PCE output,21 thus severely limiting the comprehensive performance of the PSCs. After introducing AC at the TiO2/perovskite interface, the CsPbBr3 films become more compact and flatter with completely disappeared pinholes, significantly reduced grain boundaries, and uniform and larger grain size. In particular, the 1 AC/CsPbBr3 film exhibits the highest perovskite film quality and the largest average grain size of 942 nm, indicating that an appropriate AC is beneficial for more accurately controlling the grain crystallization process so as to improve the perovskite film quality. Moreover, the higher-quality perovskite film with lower trap states can promote the rapid separation and transfer of the electron–hole pairs so as to dramatically suppress serious charge recombination caused by the defects and grain boundaries. Interestingly, when excessive AC is deposited on the m-TiO2 surface, the grain size of the corresponding perovskite film is abnormally uneven, which may be ascribed to the unbalanced combination between the lead ions and the ammonium ions, leading to the extreme and undesirable growth of partial perovskite crystals. In the XRD patterns of various perovskite films shown in Fig. 3b, all the films display the characteristic diffraction peaks of the CsPbBr3 perovskite phase without any shift in the positions and there is no appearance of other extra miscellaneous peaks, suggesting that the modified AC layer does not affect the crystal structure of the perovskite. However, compared to the control sample, the intensity of these perovskite diffraction peaks of the CsPbBr3 samples deposited on the AC-modified m-TiO2 films is significantly enhanced, demonstrating that the latter CsPbBr3 films have a higher crystallinity mainly owing to the larger grain size (fewer grain boundaries) and reduced trap states density.23,42 In addition, the dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/without or with AC/CsPbBr3/PCBM/carbon are tested by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method and are described in Fig. 3c to more directly measure the trap states density (Nt) of various perovskite films. The Nt could be calculated by combining the following equation: Nt = 2εrε0VTFL/qL2,43 where the εr value of 22 corresponds to the relative dielectric constant of the CsPbBr3 film and the ε0 value of 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1 represents the vacuum permittivity, q is the electron charge, L is the thickness of perovskite film, and VTFL, an important factor to measure the trap states density, is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region. As summarized in Table S2,† the lower value of 1.314 × 1016 cm−3 for the 1 AC/perovskite film in comparison with 1.411 × 1016 cm−3 for the control film demonstrates the passivation effect of AC on the CsPbBr3 film surface defect states, thus cross-validating the results of XPS, SEM, and XRD analysis. As expected, the AC/perovskite films show an obviously increased absorption peak intensity than that of the control film in Fig. 3d, suggesting that the enhancement in the CsPbBr3 crystallinity and film quality helps the perovskite active layer to absorb more photons and to suppress charge recombination, therefore improving the output of photogenerated current.

Fig. 4a displays the cross-sectional SEM image of the AC-modified CsPbBr3 PSC with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/AC/CsPbBr3/carbon and the corresponding schematic diagram of the entire device is illustrated in Fig. 4b, in which the thickness of the TiO2 ETL and the vertical-monolayer perovskite film are approximately 230 nm and 460 nm, respectively, and the AC modification layer is too thin to be clearly discerned. Significantly, the multi-layer intimate contact structure of the device and the vertical single crystal growth of the perovskite film are beneficial for promoting the separation and extraction of the electron–hole pairs, therefore suppressing charge recombination and energy loss at the interface and/or grain boundaries.19 UPS characterization and UV-vis spectroscopy were performed to determine the energy level position of the Fermi level (EF), conduction band (ECB), and valence band (EVB) of TiO2 modified without and with AC, as shown in Fig. S6.† The EF of the AC-modified TiO2 film decreases from −3.72 for the control film to −3.67 eV, which may be due to the dipole moment formation after AC modification.34 The reduced EF of ETL would cause a higher built-in potential (Vbi) and an expanded depleted region to boost charge transfer and restrain charge recombination.34,44 The EVB of TiO2 modified without and with AC was calculated to be −7.26 and −7.15 eV from EVB = EF − EF,edge (Fermi edge), respectively. Combined with the bandgap (Eg) from the Tauc plot, the calculated ECB of AC-modified m-TiO2 increases from −3.95 eV for the control TiO2 to −4.03 eV. The detailed energy level diagram of the charge transfer process inside the CsPbBr3 PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 4c. Obviously, the ECB of the TiO2/AC film is upshifted close to that of the perovskite compared with the control TiO2, which reduces the interfacial energy barrier and facilitates the rapid transfer of electrons from the perovskite to ETL, leading to minimized energy loss and charge recombination for higher PCE output.19 Notably, the difference between EF and ECB of the AC-modified TiO2 decreases from 0.31 eV for TiO2 to 0.28 eV, implying decreased space charge limited region and an enhanced conductivity of the former ETL, which is also beneficial for promoting charge extraction and transportation.30,45

(c) Energy level diagram of the charge transfer process in the AC-modified PSCs. (d) The J–V curves, (e) IPCE spectra, and (f) the steady power output curves of various CsPbBr3 PSCs. 
The J–V curves of the control and AC-modified CsPbBr3 PSCs are characterized and presented in Fig. 4d, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The modified devices exhibit significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance, in particular, the 1 AC-modified CsPbBr3 PSC obtains the best PCE of 9.60% with a JSC of 7.31 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.595 V, and a FF of 82.33%, which is remarkably elevated by 45.68% in comparison with 6.59% (JSC: 6.02 mA cm−2, VOC: 1.455 V, and FF: 75.24%) for the control solar cell. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is mainly ascribed to the decreased charge recombination and energy loss resulting from the perfect TiO2/perovskite interface contact, more matched interface energy level, and lower trap states density of the higher-quality TiO2 as well as the CsPbBr3 film. The IPCE spectra along with the integrated current density of the corresponding CsPbBr3 PSCs are measured and shown in Fig. 4e to prove the reliability of enhanced photovoltaic performance. All the PSCs have an excellent light response in the wavelength range of 330–550 nm, which cross-validates the results of UV-vis spectroscopy for the CsPbBr3 perovskite film. By depositing the AC-modified layer at the m-TiO2 surface, the maximum IPCE value and the integrated JSC for the optimal device are boosted up to 86% and 7.12 mA cm−2 from 76% and 5.67 mA cm−2 for the control PSC, respectively, which are matched well with the results of the J–V characterization. Moreover, compared to the control device, the modified CsPbBr3 PSCs have a more stable and higher PCE and photocurrent output at the maximal power point, as shown in Fig. 4f, and the 1 AC-modified device can still maintain 9.53% efficiency and 7.15 mA cm−2 current density over 200 s, which perfectly demonstrates the output stability of the improved device photovoltaic performance. In addition, the higher parameters (PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF) and narrower statistical distribution of the modified devices, as shown in Fig. S7,† compared to that of the control sample, demonstrate the extremely high reproducibility of device performance. Meaningfully, the hysteresis effect, a representative parameter to evaluate the performance of the PSCs, of the AC-modified CsPbBr3 solar cells is obviously eliminated compared to that of the control device in Fig. S8,† which is mainly ascribed to the accelerated charge extraction and transfer, decreased charge accumulation and recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface caused by the more perfect interface contact and more matched interface energy level as well as the higher-quality perovskite film with larger grains and lower defect states density.46–48

In order to better investigate the underlying mechanism behind the device performance enhancement, the charge transfer kinetics and recombination behaviors inside the solar cells were further studied. From the TRPL decay curves shown in Fig. 5a, the specific lifetime of the carriers can be determined, in line with the following double exponential formula: I = A1e−(τ−τ0)/τ1 + A2e−(τ−τ0)/τ2,49 where I is the PL intensity, τ1 and τ2 correspond to the fast decay time of the defect-induced non-radiative recombination and the low decay time of radiative recombination, respectively, and A1 and A2 are the corresponding decay constants; the calculation results are summarized in Table S3.† Apparently, the carriers' average lifetime τave (τave = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)), τ1 and τ2, are substantially decreased to 0.18, 0.13, and 1.15 ns for the FTO/TiO2/1 AC/CsPbBr3 sample from 0.51, 0.34, and 2.51 ns for the control FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3 sample, respectively, and the strongest quenching phenomenon of PL intensity for corresponding the 1 AC-modified film, as shown in Fig. 5b, cross-validates the decreased carrier life. The above results indicate that the introduction of AC can significantly accelerate the carriers' extraction and transport process from the perovskite film to the ETLs and reduce the loss and recombination of holes and electrons, which is mainly attributed to the reduced trap states density, perfect contact and matching energy level at the AC-modified m-TiO2/perfect interface, and the higher-quality perovskite film with a larger grain size. Furthermore, the electron mobility (μe) of various samples with the structure of FTO/TiO2/without or with AC/CsPbBr3/PCBM/carbon was calculated using the SCLC method, as shown in Fig. S9,† with the equation μe = 8JDL3/9εε0V2.50 The results (Table S2†) show that the μe of the AC-modified device increases to 2.32 × 10−4 from 4.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the control one, thus cross-validating the improved electronic extraction and transfer capabilities at the TiO2/perovskite interface with AC modification because of the higher-quality m-TiO2 and CsPbBr3 films, more perfect interface contact, and well-matched interface energy level, which are beneficial for reducing charge accumulation at the interface and suppress charge recombination inside the device for obtaining a higher JSC, VOC, and PCE output. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves obtained from the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characterization are also used to evaluate the charge transport dynamics, as shown in Fig. 5c. As expected, the AC-modified devices display a larger Vbi (1.363, 1.424, 1.407, and 1.295 V for 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 AC, respectively) than that of the control PSC (1.256 V). Notably, a larger Vbi can provide a stronger driving force for the separation, extraction, and transport of photo-generated electron–hole pairs along with a wider depletion region for significantly suppressing the charge recombination and promoting a higher VOC and FF output.51 Compared to the control device in Fig. 5d, the evidently lower leakage of the current density under the dark condition of the AC-modified PSCs verifies the reduction in the current leakage path and the suppression of charge recombination.

Generally, charge recombination inside the PSCs mainly includes defect-induced non-radiative recombination and bimolecular radiative recombination; thereby, the relationships of VOC and JSC as the function of incident light intensity (I) are characterized to reveal the carriers' recombination process, in accordance with the formula VOC = nkTln(I)/q + constant,52 where n is an ideal factor related to the defect-induced non-radiative recombination, and k, T, and q denote the Boltzmann's constant, the absolute temperature, and the electron charge, respectively. The slope is infinitely close to kT/q when there is no non-radiative recombination inside the operating devices under ideal conditions. As shown in Fig. 5e, the control CsPbBr3 sample exhibits a larger slope of 1.93 kT/q and the slope value is drastically decreased to 1.70 kT/q after 1 AC modification, indicating that non-radiative recombination inside the AC-modified devices is significantly suppressed, which simultaneously cross-validates the reduced trap states density of the perovskite film mainly due to the imperfect passivation through the interaction between AC and the uncoordinated ion defects on the CsPbBr3 surface. In addition, α, a parameter associated with bimolecular radiative recombination, is approximately equal to 1 in a perfectly ideal condition (radiation recombination is completely eliminated inside the PSCs) on the basis of the equation JSC ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1).52 As presented in Fig. 5f, the α values are respectively boosted to 0.984, 0.990, 0.987, and 0.974 for 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 AC-modified PSCs from 0.931 for the control solar cell, implying the rapid separation and extraction of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the evident suppression of radiative recombination, which is mostly attributed to the improved electron mobility as well as the energy level alignment and perfect contact at the TiO2/perovskite interface, and the higher-quality perovskite film with lower grain boundaries and larger grains. According to the above characterization and analysis, it can be convincingly concluded that interface modification with AC can not only improve the TiO2/perovskite interface contact and energy level matching but can also enhance the perovskite film quality by delaying the crystallization kinetics of the CsPbBr3 grains and the passivating surface defects, therefore regulating the charge transport kinetics and significantly suppressing charge recombination for achieving the CsPbBr3 PSCs with excellent photovoltaic performance.
It is generally known that a large energy level barrier at the perovskite/carbon interface and insufficient hole selectivity of the carbon electrode limit hole extraction and thereby the PCE enhancement. To ameliorate this issue, ZnPc, a low-cost and stable p-type semiconducting material with the closest HOMO to the valence band of CsPbBr3 reported in our previous work23 and high hole mobility, is uniformly deposited on the perovskite film surface as the HTL for energy level compensation and improved hole extraction ability in order to suppress the charge recombination and energy loss at the perovskite/carbon interface. The energy level diagram of the charge transfer process for the PSC is presented in Fig. 6a; obviously, the energy level difference in the hole transfer process from the perovskite film to the HTLs is significantly decreased by introducing ZnPc with a deep HOMO, which is beneficial for significantly promoting hole extraction and transfer for reducing charge recombination and energy loss at the interface, thereby further enhancing the PCE output and photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. On this basis, the PSC with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/ZnPc/carbon was investigated and provided as the basic control group for comparison with better PSCs and for further highlighting the important significance of AC interface modification. As expected in Fig. 6b, the solar cell with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/AC/CsPbBr3/ZnPc/carbon obtains an exciting PCE up to 10.12% with a JSC of 7.64 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.606 V, and a FF of 82.47%, yielding a significant enhancement in comparison with the ZnPc-only device (PCE: 7.87%, JSC: 6.91 mA cm−2, VOC: 1.511 V, and FF: 75.38%), which is a small increment compared with the AC-only PSC (PCE: 9.60%) and other reported CsPbBr3 devices,18,19,21,23,29,40,42,53–59 which demonstrates that AC modification has a crucial effect on the photovoltaic performance improvement of the PSCs. The boosted JSC and FF are mostly attributed to the accelerated charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination as a result of the more perfect contact and the passivation on numerous defect states at the TiO2/perovskite interface after modification with AC, and the increased VOC is mainly ascribed to the more matched TiO2/perovskite interface energy level and reduced energy loss. As shown in Fig. 6c, compared to the ZnPc-only PSC, the higher IPCE value in the response wavelength range of 320–555 nm and the larger integrated JSC of AC and the ZnPc dual-modified device cross-validate the results of the J–V analysis and the reliability of device performance enhancement. The dark J–V curves of the hole-only device with the architecture of FTO/NiO/without or with AC/CsPbBr3/ZnPc/carbon were also characterized to examine the enhancement in the hole mobility (μh) by the SCLC method. As shown in Fig. S10,† according to the formula μh = 8JDL3/9εε0V2,23μh is boosted to 5.89 × 10−3 for the AC and ZnPc dual-modified device from 4.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ZnPc-only PSC, demonstrating the accelerated hole extraction and transfer inside the device with AC modification for remarkably retarded charge recombination, which is mainly ascribed to the higher-quality CsPbBr3 film with larger grain size and fewer defect states deposited on the AC-modified TiO2 film, which promotes electron–hole separation and the hole transfer process from the perovskite to the HTL. Moreover, the stronger quenching effect (Fig. 6d) and the shorter carrier lifetime (Fig. 6e and Table S4†) of the CsPbBr3 PSC with AC and ZnPc modification compared to those of the ZnPc-only device repeatedly test and verify the enhanced charge mobility and reduced charge recombination inside the former AC-modified solar cells.

(f) Normalized PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF of the optimal CsPbBr3 PSC without encapsulation under 80% RH at 25 °C. 
In addition to the high PCE output, the excellent long-term stability is particularly important to promote the commercial development of the PSCs. The long-term stability of the optimal device with AC and ZnPc modification was measured in air free of encapsulation and is shown in Fig. 6f. The device displays an outstanding moisture tolerance stability and can even maintain 96% of its initial efficiency after aging under 80% RH air atmosphere at 25 °C for 720 h. Such superior long-term stability is mainly a result of the inherent chemical stability of the CsPbBr3 halide structure and the moisture-resistance protection of the carbon electrode.60 The above results demonstrate that the high efficiency and stable carbon-based CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells can be prepared by promoting charge separation as well as extraction and improving the perovskite quality via AC interface modification.
Conclusions
In summary, we have introduced an effective strategy to reduce the serious charge recombination and energy loss at the ETL/perovskite interface for high efficiency and stable carbon-based CsPbBr3 PSCs. The interface modification by AC can not only improve the TiO2/perovskite interface contact and energy level matching but can also enhance the TiO2 and perovskite films' quality by delaying the crystallization kinetics of the CsPbBr3 grains and passivating the surface defects, thereby regulating the charge transport dynamics and suppressing the charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Moreover, on introducing ZnPc as a HTL at the perovskite/carbon interface to reduce the interfacial energy level barrier and energy loss, the best PCE as high as 10.12% with an ultrahigh voltage of 1.606 V was achieved for the PSC with the architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/AC/CsPbBr3/ZnPc/carbon, which is increased by 53.56% and 28.59% in comparison with 6.59% and 7.87% efficiency for the pristine and ZnPc-only device, respectively. In addition, the optimized PSC without any encapsulation displays an excellent long-term stability after storing in air with 80% RH at 25 °C for 720 h. All the results illustrate a promising approach for achieving high efficiency and stable PSCs through interface engineering to improve the interfacial contact and energy level alignment, passivate the trap states, and fabricate high-quality perovskite films.
