SNHs can be engineered to exhibit type I, quasi-type II and type II carrier localization, affecting their photophysical properties and photochemical performances. Unlike bulk semiconductor heterostructures, the electron and hole energy levels and spatial distributions in SNHs can be continuously tuned by adjusting the material dimension through the quantum confinement effect, providing additional control of their properties through wavefunction engineering. In this article, we review recent progress in using wavefunction engineering to control the absorption and emission spectra, single and multiple exciton dynamics and charge transfer properties of SNHs (core/shell QDs and dot-in-rod nanorods) as well as to improve their performance as light harvesting and charge separation materials for solar energy conversion.Haiming ZhuHaiming Zhu was born in 1985 in Jiangsu, China.

Broader context
Efficient solar-to-fuel conversion requires the development of not only efficient catalysts but also novel materials and approaches for light harvesting and charge separation. Recent advances in material synthesis have led to the development of colloidal semiconductor nanoheterostructures composed of multiple component materials with desired spatial arrangements. The energy and wavefunction of the conduction band electrons and valence band holes in these heterostructures can be tuned by the choice of the component materials and their shapes and dimensions, thus enabling the control of material properties by wavefunction engineering. The rates of electron transfer, hole transfer, electron–hole recombination and charge recombination in these heterostructures can be selectively optimized by wavefunction engineering to improve their performance as light harvesting and charge separation materials in solar energy conversion.

1. Introduction
Worldwide energy demand currently exceeds 13 TW and is expected to be more than doubled (30 TW) by 2050 and tripled (46 TW) by the end of the century.1,2 Fossil fuels alone will not be sufficient to meet the demand in an environmentally sustainable way. The incident solar energy on earth per hour is more than the current world energy consumption in an entire year. Therefore, efficient solar energy conversion is a promising approach for meeting the world energy demand, making it one of the most important scientific challenges today.2–4
There are two general approaches for solar energy conversion.4 In the first approach (as shown in Fig. 1), solar energy is converted into chemical fuels (solar-to-fuel conversion). Since chemical fuels are a high density, storable, and transportable energy source, direct solar-to-fuel conversion also addresses the energy storage problem.3,5 In the second approach, solar energy is directly converted into electricity through photovoltaic devices or solar cells.6,7 The complete solar-to-fuel conversion systems often consist of two parts: a photoanode for the oxidation of water to form O2 and H+, and a (photo)cathode for the reduction of water or CO2 to generate fuels. The overall reactions in the photocathode and photoanode involve many processes. For example, the reaction on a triadic photocathode (Fig. 1B) involves (i) light harvesting by the sensitizer with an efficiency ϕLH, (ii) charge collection from the excited sensitizer to catalysts through either direct transfer or electron mediators with an efficiency ϕcol, (iii) the catalytic reaction to generate fuels with an efficiency ϕcat. The overall solar-to-fuel conversion quantum efficiency is determined by the efficiencies of all three processes, Φ = ϕLH × ϕcol × ϕcat. Clearly, efficient solar-to-fuel conversion requires the development of not only efficient catalysts (to increase ϕcat) but also efficient sensitizers and novel approaches for light harvesting and charge separation (to increase both ϕLH and ϕcol). For broader scientific progresses and challenges of solar-to-fuel conversion, the readers are referred to many excellent recent review articles.3–5,8,9

Water is oxidized in the photoanode to form O2 and H+ and reduced in the photocathode to form H2. (B) Schematic depiction of major processes in the fuel forming reaction in the photocathode side, involving the electron donor (ED), sensitizer, mediator and catalyst. The competition between the forward (electron transfer and hole filling, with rate constants kCS and kHF, respectively) and backward (electron–hole recombination and charge recombination, with rate constants kRX and kCR, respectively) reactions determines the charge collection efficiency (ϕcol). 
Compared with molecular chromophores, inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) typically exhibit much larger extinction coefficients over a broader spectral range, which should lead to improved light harvesting performance.10–12 Unlike bulk semiconductors in which the carriers can undergo trap mediated recombination before diffusing to the surface to be extracted,13 the large surface-to-volume ratio and the quantum confinement in NCs significantly enhance the surface amplitude of carrier wavefunctions, which facilitates interfacial carrier extraction to the surrounding charge collection network.14–20 Shown in Fig. 2 are 1S electron and hole energy levels and their surface densities as a function of CdSe quantum dot (QD) radius calculated with an effective mass model.21–24 Because of the quantum confinement effect, the light harvesting properties, redox potentials as well as charge transfer dynamics of NCs can be tuned by changing their size.15,25–28 In addition, the surface of colloidal NCs can be readily modified to bind specific functional targets (including catalysts) and to be soluble in a preferred reaction environment.29–31 Although the efficiency is still a subject of intense debate and appears to be modest,32–41 a recently reported multiexciton generation (MEG) phenomenon in semiconductor NCs, a process by which multiple excitons are generated by one absorbed high energy photon, has further intensified the interest in using these materials for charge separation applications.17,24,42–44 Indeed, semiconductor NCs have been successfully incorporated into a variety of photovoltaic devices, e.g. solar cells and photodetectors42,43,45 and photocatalytic reactions, e.g. cofactor generation, water splitting and CO2 fixation.46–48 For an in-depth coverage of semiconductor NC properties and their solar energy conversion applications, the reader can refer to several review articles.49–55

The overall charge separation efficiency ϕcol from NC sensitizers, as illustrated in Fig. 1, depends on the competitions of (i) electron–hole recombination (with rate kRX) vs. charge separation (kCS) and (ii) charge recombination (kCR) vs. hole filling (or regeneration) by sacrificial electron donors or external bias (kHF). Because of these competing processes, efficient overall charge separation requires kRX ≪ kCS and kCR ≪ kHF. In the simplest NCs, i.e. single component spherical quantum dots (QDs), the electron–hole recombination lifetime is typically 10–20 ns for colloidal CdX (X = S, Se, Te) QDs at room temperature and is size-independent because of negligible variation of electron–hole overlap with QD dimensions.56 With decreasing particle size, the quantum confinement effect increases both the electron and hole energy and surface densities (as shown in Fig. 2B), which increases the rate for both the charge separation (kCS, electron transfer) and charge recombination (kCR, hole transfer) processes in QD–electron acceptor complexes.18,21,22,24,57 Therefore, it remains difficult to optimize the overall charge separation efficiency by selectively and rationally controlling the competing processes in single component QDs.
The advancement in the synthesis of colloidal semiconductor NCs has led to the preparation of more sophisticated semiconductor nanoheterostructures (SNHs) with multiple component materials and nonspherical shapes that can be tuned for desired functions.55,58–62 For example, CdX, ZnX, and PbX (X = S, Se, Te) based semiconductor materials have been extensively tailored and combined into spherical core/shell QDs, linear dot-in-rod, rod/rod, branched tetrapods, octapods and even curved nanostructures. By tailoring the potential energy profile through material choice and degree of quantum confinement via the size and shape of the components, the electron and hole wavefunctions in SNHs can be independently engineered to control a variety of photophysical properties, including energy levels, emission quantum yield, and single and multiple exciton state lifetimes. In addition, a series of recent experiments shows that compared with the typical single component QDs, wavefunction engineering in SNHs offers additional opportunities to effectively control their charge transfer properties, enabling rational design of new types of NC sensitizers with improved light harvesting and charge separation efficiency. In this review, we start with the classification of band alignments in SNHs and their effect on photophysical properties. We focus our discussion on recent progress in understanding and controlling interfacial charge separation processes from SNHs through wavefunction engineering. We give examples of optimizing solar energy conversion in model SNH based devices through wavefunction engineering. Finally, we end with a summary and future outlook.
2. Carrier localization and classification of SNHs

Fig. 3 gives an overview of the bulk band edge positions of semiconductor materials that are commonly used in NC synthesis. It should be noted that there are considerable uncertainties in these reported values.63–69 Based on the relative energy offsets of bulk conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges (ΔUC and ΔUV) of the component materials, the band alignment of semiconductor heterostructures is typically classified as type I, quasi-type II and type II. Examples of these band alignments are shown in Fig. 4 for core/shell heterostructures. In type I materials, such as CdX (X = S, Se, Te)/ZnS, both the CB and VB edges of CdX locate within the band gap of ZnS to form a “nested” configuration. Therefore, both the lowest energy photoexcited electron and hole are primarily confined in the material with a narrower band gap (CdX). Type II heterostructures, such as CdX (X = S, Se, Te)/ZnTe, CdTe/CdSe, CdTe/CdS, or ZnSe/CdS, are characterized by a staggered band alignment with the lowest energy levels for the CB electron and the VB hole in different materials. Consequently, these carriers are localized in different materials across the heterostructure, forming a “spatially indirect” exciton with a band gap determined by the CB edge of one material and VB edge of another. In the quasi-type II regime, one carrier is confined in one domain while the other is delocalized over the whole heterostructure.

The black lines indicate the band edge positions in the core and shell materials. The red and blue (inverted) lines depict the electron and hole envelope functions, respectively. 
For colloidal semiconductor nanoheterostructures, the lowest energy levels for excited electron (1Se) and hole (1Sh) are shifted up by quantum confinement energies ΔEe and ΔEh from the bulk CB and VB edges, respectively. Therefore, besides the bulk band offsets between the component materials, their size and shape also affect the carrier distribution in SNHs. An “energy criterion” has been proposed to serve as a rough guide of carrier localization regimes in SNHs.70,71 That is, an electron (hole) can be assumed to be primarily localized in one material if ΔEe < ΔUC (ΔEh < ΔUV) or delocalized in both materials if ΔEe > ΔUC (ΔEh > ΔUV). For example, because of strong quantum confinement, PbS/PbSe core/shell QDs of small core size, which have a type II band alignment in bulk materials, behave as a type I nanoheterostructure because both 1S electron and hole confinement energies are larger than the conduction and valence band offsets (ΔEe ≫ ΔUC and ΔEh ≫ ΔUV) and the wavefunctions of both the electron and hole extend throughout both materials.65,72 On the other hand, PbSe/CdSe core/shell QDs of small core size, which have a type I bulk band alignment, show quasi-type II features because of the large electron confinement energy in the PbSe core (ΔEe > ΔUC).66,73
The size dependent confinement energy can be used to tune the band alignment in SNHs, which significantly alters their photophysical properties, including carrier energy relaxation, carrier spin relaxation, single and multiple exciton lifetime, electron–hole exchange interaction, and charge transfer rates.22,67,74–77 It has been shown that CdTe/CdSe,76,78 CdSe/CdS,67,79 CdS/ZnSe,70 and ZnSe/CdSe80,81 core/shell QDs can be tuned from the type I to type II regimes by changing either the core size or shell thickness. As shown in Fig. 5, a transition from the quasi-type II to type I band alignment can be realized in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs (ΔUC ≈ 0.3 eV, ΔUV ≈ 0.5 eV) by increasing the core size.67,68 The confinement energy and spatial distribution for the lowest energy electron/hole in SNHs can be well described by the effective mass model,21–24,67,70,71,76,77,82 which in principle allows the computational design of SNHs with desired carrier spatial distributions. However, special care must be taken when dealing with SNHs with small band offsets due to interfacial strain and distortion in nanostructures.77,83–86

3. Optical properties and excited state dynamics in SNHs
3.1 Type I SNHs
After the initial report of colloidal CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs in the 1990s,87,88 many other type I core/shell structures, including CdS/ZnS,89 CdSe/CdS,90 InP/ZnS91 and core/multishell QDs92,93 and core/shell nanorods94(CdSe/CdS/ZnS, InP/GaP/ZnS) have been synthesized. In type I core/shell QDs, where both electron and hole wavefunctions are confined in the core by the wide bandgap shell material, the optical properties, including fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime, are much less sensitive to the surrounding environments. As a result, the optical properties can be largely maintained after repeated purification, film deposition, oxygen exposure or ligand exchange.90,92,95 For example, exchanging TOPO or oleic acid in CdSe/ZnS type I QDs by thiol containing ligands, which are needed for solubility in aqueous media, does not significantly reduce the fluorescence quantum yield, even though these ligands are effective hole acceptors for CdSe core-only QDs.83,85,88 At the same time, because core surface defects and dangling bonds are significantly removed through the epitaxial growth of the shell material, the fluorescence quantum yield of type I core/shell QDs is much higher than that of typical core-only QDs.
Shown in Fig. 6A and B are the absorption and emission spectra of type I CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs of different shell thicknesses.21 Compared to core-only QDs, the growth of the shell leads to enhanced absorption in the UV due to the shell material and a small redshift of both core related absorption and emission peaks, indicating the reduction of confinement energy. An effective mass calculation (Fig. 6A, inset) shows that such redshift can be attributed to the slight extension of the electron and hole wavefunctions into the shell material.21,88 While this has only minor effects on the static absorption and emission spectra, it has important implications for interfacial charge transfer properties to be discussed later. Shown in Fig. 6C are the 1S exciton bleach recovery kinetics of type I CdSe/ZnS QDs measured by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with 400 nm excitation. This signal can be attributed to the state filling of the 1S electron level and directly probes the 1S electron dynamics. These data show that the 1S electron decay kinetics of type I CdSe/ZnS QDs depends weakly on the shell thickness (with a half-life time ∼15 ns). However, the fluorescence decay kinetics, which depends on both the CB electron and VB hole, are similar for CdSe/ZnS QDs with different shell thickness, but they lack a fast decay component that is observed in core-only CdSe QDs. Because the electron kinetics are similar and long-lived for all QDs, the fast initial fluorescence decay component in core-only QDs can be attributed to hole trapping. It suggests that in type I core/shell QDs, the ZnS shell reduces the number of hole trapping sites on the surface of the CdSe core, improving the fluorescence quantum yield of the core/shell QDs (Fig. 6B, inset). The ZnS shell does not affect the radiative lifetime because of negligible changes in the electron–hole overlap integral |〈ψe|ψh〉|2.21 Furthermore, because the exciton–exciton Auger annihilation rate also depends on the electron–hole overlap integral, multiple exciton lifetimes in type I core/shell QDs are similar to those in core-only QDs with similar core size.96

3.2 Type II SNHs
Type II SNHs of different compositions, dimensions and geometries have been prepared since the first report of colloidal type II (CdTe/CdSe, CdSe/ZnTe) core/shell QDs in 2003.97 Because the lowest energy CB electron and VB hole are localized in different component materials, new interfacial charge transfer (CT) transitions between the two materials are formed in addition to the electronic transitions of each individual component. These CT bands have lower energies than the band gaps of the constituent materials, extending the absorption onset and emission peak to a longer wavelength. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, starting with a CdTe seed with the first exciton band at ∼580 nm, the type II CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs have new absorption bands extending to the red with the lowest energy (CT) transition at ∼800 nm.22 The extent of the redshift depends on the degree of quantum confinement and can be tuned by the core size and shell thickness, making type II SNHs promising tunable near-IR emitters.97,98

In addition to the static absorption and emission properties, type II band alignment also affects the excited state dynamics of photoexcited electrons and holes. After excitation of either component, the electron–hole pair relaxes to the band edge and undergoes internal charge separation, localizing the electron and hole in different materials. As shown in Fig. 7C and D, after 400 nm excitation, the bleaches of B1, B2 and B3 transitions are formed with a time constant of 0.7 ps. Through model calculation and TA studies, we showed that these transitions share the same shell localized 1S electron level (see Fig. 7B). Therefore, the formation of these bleaches correspond to the localization of the excited electrons at the shell through the internal charge separation process,22 consistent with similar sub-ps internal charge separation processes in other type II SNHs.22,99–105
As shown in Fig. 8A, the fluorescence decay time of CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs increases with the CdSe shell thickness (d).75,76 With increasing shell thickness, the electron is progressively more localized in the shell domain while the hole remains confined in the core, decreasing the electron–hole overlap and their radiative recombination rate 1/τrad. As shown in Fig. 8B, the radiative decay rate decreases by a factor of ∼4, going from CdTe core-only QDs to CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs with a 2 nm shell. Fluorescence lifetimes can be extended to over 100 ns in related binary type II core/shell SNHs (such as CdTe/CdSe, CdSe/ZnTe),75,76,106 and even longer in multi-component SNHs with cumulative type II band offsets.106,107

The lifetime of biexciton states in type II SNHs is also significantly lengthened. In core-only QDs, the biexciton lifetime is proportional to the volume (τBX ∝ V) and typically 10–100 ps for CdX (X = S, Se, and Te) QDs.76,96,108 In type II SNHs, biexciton lifetimes of hundreds of ps and even nanoseconds have been reported.67,76,109 A recent study of CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs shows that the biexciton lifetime in these type II structures depends on both the volume and electron–hole overlap integral: τBX ∝ V/|〈ψe|ψh〉|2 (Fig. 8C), which can be significantly prolonged in type II SNHs due to the reduction of the electron–hole overlap and the increase of volume.76 Furthermore, recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest that interfacial alloy formation in SNHs can lead to additional reduction of the Auger recombination rate.109,110
3.3 Quasi-type II SNHs
The most investigated quasi-type II SNHs are CdSe/CdS core/shell, dot-in-rod and tetrapod structures.67,77,83–85,109,111–118 In CdSe/CdS SNHs with small CdSe seed, because of small conduction band (<0.3 V) and large valence band (>0.7 V) offsets, the lowest energy hole is localized in the CdSe core and the electron is delocalized over both CdSe and CdS, forming a quasi-type II carrier distribution.67,77,83,109,118,119 Other examples of quasi-type II SNHs include CdSe/ZnSe74,80 and PbSe/CdSe.66,73 Similar to type II SNHs, the delocalization of one carrier reduces electron–hole overlap integral in quasi-type II SNHs, leading to longer single and multiple exciton lifetimes.24,67,109,112
We recently examined the excited state dynamics of CdSe/CdS core/shell structures. Because of the small conduction band offset, there is no obvious interfacial CT band formation. As shown in Fig. 9 column A middle panel, the static absorption spectrum shows transitions that can be attributed to the CdS shell and CdSe core. The emission spectrum resembles that of the CdSe core. However, the extent of electron delocalization depends sensitively on the size of the core and the thickness of the shell, ranging from type I to quasi-type II regimes without significant changes in the static absorption and emission spectra.67,79,119,120 Therefore, the assignment of transitions in (quasi-) type II core/shell structure and determination of the extent of carrier localization is a nontribal task. Although effective mass calculation can in principle provide the wavefunction and energy needed for the assignment, the reliability of such calculations is affected by the uncertainty of bulk band offset and the extent of interfacial strain, which can have a significant effect on quasi-type II materials.21–24,67,70,71,76,77,82

Shown in the inset of column A middle panel is the static absorption and emission spectra of CdSe/CdS quasi-type II QDs. Adapted with permission from ref. 24. Copyright (2012) American Chemical Society. 
Experimental evidence to support spectral assignment can be obtained by TA studies in which selective transitions are excited and selective carriers are removed by electron or hole acceptors.21–24 For CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs shown in Fig. 9, upon the excitation of the lowest energy transition (T0), bleaches at both the T0 and T1 transitions are formed instantaneously, suggesting that these transitions share the same CB 1S electron level.24 This is further supported by the observation that in the presence of electron acceptors, both bleaches recover with the same kinetics. These findings confirm that the 1S electron is delocalized throughout the core and shell in this quasi-type II structure. With the excitation at the T1 transition, an instantaneous bleach of the T1 transition is observed while the T0 transition shows a growth component of ∼0.7 ps, which can be attributed to the localization of the hole in the VB of the CdSe core.24,83 We speculate that even though the transient bleach signal is caused by the state filling of the electron level, the localization of the hole in the core VB affects the electron distribution in the CB due to their Coulomb interaction, giving rise to a change in the bleach amplitude of the T0 transition. Finally, at 400 nm excitation the transient bleaches at T0 and T1 show growth components that can be attributed to the cooling and localization of the carriers.24
4. Interfacial charge separation and recombination
4.1 Type I SNHs
Although various SNHs have been successfully developed and their electronic and optical properties have been extensively studied, the investigations of their charge transfer behaviors and associated applications remain limited. Both electron and hole transfers from core/shell QDs to semiconductor films and molecular acceptors have been demonstrated on the single QD level.16,19,121,122 In addition, it has been reported in one study that QD sensitized solar cells with CdSe/ZnS type I core/shell and CdSe core-only QDs show similar efficiencies.123 In other studies, ZnS overlayer coating has led to efficiency improvement of CdSe or CdS QD sensitized solar cells.124–126 These findings suggest that efficient charge separation can be achieved in the presence of ZnS layers in type I QDs. To examine the effect of the insulating overlayer on the charge separation properties of QDs, we recently studied CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD–anthraquinone (AQ) complexes as a model type I QD–electron acceptor system (Fig. 10).21 By TA spectroscopy, the initial charge separation (kCS, Fig. 10A) and subsequent charge combination (kCR, Fig. 10B) kinetics were measured as a function of the ZnS shell thickness (d). As shown in Fig. 10D, both rates were found to decay exponentially with the shell thickness: k(d) = k0exp(−βd), where k0 is the charge separation or recombination rate of CdSe core-only QDs and β is the decay constant. Best fits to the data yield βCS ≈ 3.5 nm−1 for charge separation and βCR ≈ 9.1 nm−1 for charge recombination. The charge separation (recombination) rates correlate well with the electron (hole) surface density calculated by the effective mass model. This agreement confirms that the ZnS shell in CdSe/ZnS type I QDs acts as a tunneling barrier to slow down the electron and hole transfer rates and the surface carrier density controls the electronic coupling strength for carrier extraction. Similar results have also been observed for electron or hole transfer in CdSe/ZnS type I QDs and quantum rods, CdSe/CdS type I QDs and ZnTe/CdSe QDs.127–130

It is also interesting to note that compared to the charge separation rate, the charge recombination rate decreases faster with the shell thickness and can be attributed to a heavier hole effective mass in the ZnS shell. Because the charge separation rates are significantly faster than the excited state relaxation (1/kR ∼ 15 ns), it is possible to maintain a high charge separation yield while greatly prolonging the charge separated state lifetime by increasing the shell thickness. In CdSe/ZnS–AQ complexes (Fig. 10C), QDs with ∼3 monolayers of shell show near unity transient product (AQ−) yield while the core-only QDs shows a much smaller value because of faster charge recombination loss in the latter. This strategy is similar to the minimization of kinetic redundancy used in dye-sensitized solar cells.131,132 The asymmetry in the electron and hole tunneling rates suggests the possibility of utilizing type I SNHs to improve the charge separation yield and lifetime by judicious choices of the insulating layer material and thickness.
4.2 (Quasi)-type II SNHs
In (quasi-) type II core/shell QDs, such as CdTe/CdSe (CdSe/CdS), the electron is localized in the shell (or delocalized over both the core and shell), which enhances (maintains) its overlap with the adsorbed electron acceptors on the shell surface, whereas the hole is confined in the core, which reduces the electronic coupling of the hole with the surface adsorbates. Therefore, compared with typical core-only QDs, the charge separation rate kCS should be accelerated (or maintained) while the charge recombination rate kCR be greatly retarded in these structures, making them desirable materials for efficient charge separation. Using methylviologen (MV2+) as a model electron acceptor, we showed that compared to CdSe core-only QDs, CdSe/CdS quasi-type II QDs have a similarly ultrafast charge separation rate, whereas the charge recombination rate is more than 3 orders of magnitude slower (Fig. 11A).24 A comparison of CdTe/CdSe (type II) with CdTe, CdSe and CdSe/ZnS (type I) QDs further illustrates that type II carrier distribution facilitates charge separation and significantly prolongs the lifetime of the charge separated state compared to core-only QDs (Fig. 11B).22 This differs from CdSe/ZnS type I QDs where both the charge separation and recombination rates are reduced. It is worth noting that with the built-in internal electron–hole separation, type II SNHs are analogous to molecular donor–acceptor complexes that have been successfully used to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.133,134 The improved charge separation properties, combined with enhanced spectral response and prolonged single and multiple exciton lifetimes, suggest that type II SNHs are promising light harvesting and charge separation materials for both photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.24

5. Towards the optimization of solar energy conversion efficiency with SNHs
In the model QD–acceptor complexes discussed above, the charge separation process is followed by the recombination of the transferred electron in the acceptor with the hole in the QD. To sustain a photoreduction reaction, in addition to electron transfer to the mediator or catalyst, efficient filling of the hole by an electron from an external circuit (or a sacrificial electron donor in a model system) is also required for the accumulation of reducing equivalents in the catalysts (Fig. 1B). Therefore, it is important to simultaneously facilitate the forward reactions (charge separation kCS and hole filling kHF) and retard the backward reactions (exciton recombination kRX and charge recombination kCR) in order to achieve efficient solar energy conversion. According to the charge transfer properties discussed above, (quasi-) type II SNHs provide the opportunities to effectively and independently control those processes by wavefunction engineering. Despite the expected advantages, the application of these materials for solar energy conversion has only begun in recent years.123,135–142
In a recent study, we compared the quantum yields of methylviologen radical generation and hydrogen evolution using water soluble NCs of different compositions and dimensions as the light harvesting and charge separation component.141 CdSe/CdS quasi-type II dot-in-rod SNHs were compared with CdSe seed QDs, CdSe/CdSe core/shell QDs of similar energy or similar volume, CdS nanorods of similar dimension, and Ru(bipy)32+ [bipy = bipyridine] dye molecules (Fig. 12A). Comparison of the initial MV+˙ radical generation yields shows that the anisotropic CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod SNHs give the highest quantum yield, > 90% over a broad range of MV2+ concentrations. This value is almost one order of magnitude higher than that for CdSe QDs (Fig. 12B). MV2+/MV+˙ couple is an effective electron mediator for many catalytic reactions including H2 evolution and CO2 fixation.46,143,144 When this NC-based MV+˙ generation scheme is coupled with Pt nanoparticle catalysts, H2 can be generated. Again, the CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod SNHs show the highest H2 evolution quantum efficiency among these NCs (Fig. 12C). It is interesting to note that unlike molecular sensitizers, CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod NCs are robust, showing only a minor decrease in the catalytic turnover rate in 24 hours (Fig. 12C, inset), during which each NC has undergone ∼1.6 × 105 photon absorption and charge separation cycles.

To investigate the reason for different MV+˙ generation efficiencies among these NCs, we used time-resolved TA and fluorescence spectroscopy to follow the individual steps involved in the overall photo-reduction process (Fig. 1). TA measurements reveal ultrafast charge separation from excited NCs to adsorbed MV2+ molecules (kRX ≪ kCS) thus achieving unity initial transient charge separation yield in all systems. The difference in the steady-state performance can be attributed to the charge recombination process between the MV+˙ radical and the hole in the NCs. This notion is supported by the observation that the transient quantum yields of MV+˙ generation at 10 μs after 400 nm excitation agree well with the steady-state quantum yields of these NCs (Fig. 12B). For CdSe QDs, both hole filling and charge recombination are fast and the competition of these processes leads to a small steady-state MV+˙ generation yield. Although the charge recombination rates are reduced in CdSe/CdS quasi-type II core/shell QDs, the shell also decreases the hole filling rates, leading to only moderate improvement in their steady-state quantum yields. In these spherical core/shell structures, the reduction of the charge recombination rate by confining the hole in the core also necessarily decreases the hole filling rate. This limitation can be removed in anisotropic CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod SNHs, in which ultrafast hole filling and ultraslow charge recombination can be simultaneously achieved (kCR ≪ kHF), leading to highly efficient MV+˙ radical generation. Unlike core/shell QDs, the electron and hole in the dot-in-rod structure are spatially separated along the long axis of the nanorod (with the hole in the CdSe dot and the electron in the CdS rod), which slows down both the electron–hole (kRX) and charge (kCR) recombination processes. The wavefunction of the CdSe dot-localized hole can still extend to the rod surface in the radial direction to enable ultrafast hole filling. Therefore, the asymmetric dot-in-rod structure allows the independent control of the hole filling and charge recombination rates. In addition, the quantum confinement in the radial direction and the larger surface-to-volume ratio in CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod SNHs enable fast charge separation (kCS). Therefore, by controlling compositions and dimensions, the electron/hole wavefunctions of the anisotropic (quasi-) type II SNHs can be engineered to simultaneously facilitate the forward reactions and retard the backward processes to achieve the highest overall MV2+ photoreduction and H2 generation quantum efficiencies. The concept of using wavefunction engineering for optimizing charge separation properties has also been suggested in recently reported CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod-Pt and CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod-MoS3 complexes where SNHs and catalytic units are directly assembled in the multicomponent heterostructures.135,136
In addition to photocatalytic reactions, wavefunction engineering in colloidal SNHs has also been applied in photovoltaic devices. The most extensively investigated SNH solar cells are CdSe and CdS co-sensitized metal oxide (ZnO, SnO2, TiO2) solar cells prepared via chemical bath deposition (CBD). In this synthesis route, the metal oxide electrode is successively dipped into Cd2+, S2−, Cd2+, and SeSO32− solutions (Fig. 13A), forming first CdS and then CdSe NC layers.145,147–149 This simple sensitization method can be applied to nanostructured oxide films of various morphologies, e.g. nanoparticles, nanotubes/rods and inverse opals.145–147 Solar cells prepared by this method can reach power conversion efficiency of ∼4%, significantly higher than single component CdSe or CdS QD sensitized solar cells (∼1%).143,145–147 Even though the NC layers have less well-defined particle size, morphology and interface compared to colloidal core/shell QDs,145,147,148 a staggered type II band alignment in the TiO2/CdS/CdSe electrodes can still be achieved (Fig. 13A).147,150 Therefore, the addition of the CdSe layer not only improves the spectral response of the sensitized electrode by further extension into the visible region, but also facilitates stepwise electron transfer to the TiO2 electrode and hole extraction by the electrolyte, enhancing the charge separation and the overall conversion efficiencies.147,150 Besides chemical bath deposition, solar cells based on SNH sensitized TiO2 electrodes have also been fabricated using colloidal SNHs, e.g. CdSe/ZnS type I QDs and ZnSe/CdS type II QDs.123,139 Compared with CdSe core-only QDs, a comparable efficiency but much longer durability has been reported for CdSe/ZnS type I QD sensitized solar cells.123 Linear and branched CdTe/CdSe type II SNHs have also been applied to NC sensitized TiO2 solar cells with semiconducting polymers as the hole transport layers (Fig. 13B).137,138,151 However, for reasons yet to be understood, the power conversion efficiencies from these solar cells are still low (<1%),137,151 although they are better than cells based on CdTe or CdSe QDs.138 Another convenient way to prepare SNH-based solar cells is an all solid state heterojunction in a bilayer configuration (Fig. 13C).146,152 The type II band alignment between the CdTe and CdSe layers is believed to facilitate interfacial exciton dissociation and carrier extraction, enhancing the overall conversion efficiency.146,152

6. Summary and future outlook
In this article, we have reviewed recent processes of using wavefunction engineering to control the optical, excited state and charge transfer properties of SNHs as well as to improve their performance as light harvesting and charge separation materials for solar energy conversion. In CdSe/ZnS type I QDs, we show that the charge separation and recombination rates depend on the amplitudes of electron and hole wavefunctions at the QD surface, respectively. Although the ZnS shell retards both rates in this type I heterostructure, the shell thickness dependences are different due to the different electron and hole effective masses, providing a potential approach for optimizing charge separation efficiencies. In CdTe/CdSe type II and CdSe/CdS quasi-type II QDs, the staggered band alignment drives an ultrafast internal electron–hole spatial separation on the sub-ps time scale and greatly prolongs their intrinsic recombination time (due to the reduced electron–hole overlap). Furthermore, the conduction band electron wavefunction is extended to (in CdSe/CdS) or localized (in CdTe/CdSe) in the shell, enabling ultrafast electron transfer to the electron acceptor on the QD surface, whereas the core confined hole slows down the charge recombination rate. Finally, the electron and hole wavefunctions in CdSe/CdS quasi-type II dot-in-rod SNHs, which are separated along the rod axis but both extended to the rod surface in the radial direction, enable fast electron transfer (to electron acceptor), fast hole extraction (by hole acceptor) and slow charge recombination. Compared with core-only QDs, core/shell QDs, and nanorods, the electron and hole distributions of the quasi-type II dot-in-rod structure lead to much higher redox mediator (MV+˙) and H2 generation efficiencies under steady-state photoillumination.
Compared with single component nanocrystals, semiconductor nanoheterostructures provide opportunities for independently and effectively manipulating electron and hole wavefunctions and associated photophysical and charge transfer properties by rationally tailoring their compositions and dimensions. The SNH structures highlighted in this mini-review represent the simplest structures that can be designed and prepared. Many more advanced and sophisticated structures have been and will continue to be developed. The design and characterization of these materials can be greatly facilitated by more advanced computational models85,153,154 even though the effective mass model has proven to be essential and helpful so far. With increasing material complexity, it is also important to advance spectroscopy and imaging tools that can investigate the microscopic structures and dynamics in these materials. Our studies demonstrate that complementary to steady state photo/electro-chemistry measurements that evaluate the overall device/system performance, time-resolved spectroscopy can probe the underlying processes that limit the overall efficiency.141 The advancement of single NC time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging methods provides additional tools to characterize the spatial distributions of the electron and hole and reveal the heterogeneities of material properties.116,155–160 Therefore, by combining the wavefunction engineering strategy, advancement in SNH synthesis, computational modeling, and time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging techniques, more sophisticated SNHs can be developed and optimized for solar energy conversion.

Broader context
Efficient solar-to-fuel conversion requires the development of not only efficient catalysts but also novel materials and approaches for light harvesting and charge separation. Recent advances in material synthesis have led to the development of colloidal semiconductor nanoheterostructures composed of multiple component materials with desired spatial arrangements. The energy and wavefunction of the conduction band electrons and valence band holes in these heterostructures can be tuned by the choice of the component materials and their shapes and dimensions, thus enabling the control of material properties by wavefunction engineering. The rates of electron transfer, hole transfer, electron–hole recombination and charge recombination in these heterostructures can be selectively optimized by wavefunction engineering to improve their performance as light harvesting and charge separation materials in solar energy conversion.


 	Fig. 1  (A) Schematic illustration of a water splitting photoelectrochemical cell, consisting of photoanode and photocathode compartments separated by a H+ permeable membrane. Water is oxidized in the photoanode to form O2 and H+ and reduced in the photocathode to form H2. (B) Schematic depiction of major processes in the fuel forming reaction in the photocathode side, involving the electron donor (ED), sensitizer, mediator and catalyst. The competition between the forward (electron transfer and hole filling, with rate constants kCS and kHF, respectively) and backward (electron–hole recombination and charge recombination, with rate constants kRX and kCR, respectively) reactions determines the charge collection efficiency (ϕcol).
