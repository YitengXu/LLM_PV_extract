    , Accepted 19th November 2010First published on 23rd December 2010AbstractNovel nanohybrids of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) encapsulating C60 or C70 with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have been prepared and their photophysics and photoelectrochemical properties are studied in detail for the first time. Strong π–π interaction between the SWNT sidewalls and P3HT afforded successful dissolution of the so-called fullerene peapods into an organic solvent, as in the case of empty SWNTs (p-SWNTs). Fluorescence emission of P3HT in the SWNT–P3HT hybrids was completely quenched by the SWNTs regardless of the fullerenes insertion. Transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion techniques revealed the excited state dynamics of the nanohybrids, where exciplex formation from the short-lived P3HT singlet excited state (∼0.2 ps) with the fullerene peapods and subsequent relaxation to the ground state within ∼1 ps occurred dominantly. Significant difference in the photodynamics upon encapsulation of C60 or C70 was not detected, implying little participation of the fullerenes in the excited state event and thus the inability of the encapsulated fullerenes to generate the charge-separated state between the fullerene peapods and P3HT. Photoelectrochemical devices based on the peapod–P3HT nanohybrids showed almost the same incident photon-to-current efficiencies as those for the p-SWNT–P3HT-based device, which is in good agreement with the results of the time-resolved spectroscopies. Thus, the results obtained here will give a deep insight into the photophysics and photoelectrochemical properties of fullerene peapod–conjugated polymer as well as SWNT–conjugated polymer hybrids and therefore provide valuable information on the design of peapod-based optoelectronic devices.

Broader context

            Nanocarbon materials, such as fullerene, carbon nanotube and graphene, are one of the key components for realizing highly efficient organic optoelectronics. In particular, the one-dimensional structure of carbon nanotubes enables us to construct the ideal percolation pathway for charge carriers within thin films. Thus, utilizing carbon nanotube–conjugated donor polymer composites would be a fair direction toward constructing the high performance organic photovoltaics. On the other hand, the inner space of carbon nanotubes allows us to control the electronic structure by encapsulating suitable-sized molecules. In this context, fullerene-encapsulated nanotubes, so-called fullerene peapods, provide a fundamental scientific interest regarding the impact of the fullerene encapsulation on the photodynamics and photovoltaic properties of the carbon nanotube–conjugated polymer hybrids. Here, we address this issue for the first time by using novel hybrid material of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and single-walled carbon nanotubes encapsulating C60 or C70.

Introduction
Producing highly efficient organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a desirable goal toward realization of the large-area, light-weight, and flexible solar cells at low cost. The state of the art in the field of OPVs is represented by bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives.1 In particular, the BHJ solar cells consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) have shown a power conversion efficiency (η) over 5%, which is among the highest values ever reported for polymer-based OPVs.2 Although this system still has significant importance as a prototypical benchmark for comparison of the device performance or investigation of the basic operation mechanism, recent focus has turned to replacing the components by novel materials with excellent optical, electronic, and morphological properties in film state.3 Especially, given that the poorly built percolation network for charges in the BHJ structure and the resulting low charge mobilities are one of the major factors limiting the performance of OPVs,4 exploring other photoactive materials which can yield more efficient network structure is essential for highly efficient OPVs.3f

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are mechanically strong, high modulus graphitic fibers with a diameter of 1–2 nanometres and a length of a few micrometres.5 Particularly, their high electron mobility and the large aspect ratio provide the potential to construct an ideal percolation pathway for electron transport in the deposited film.5,6 In this context, the use of SWNTs instead of PCBM as well as the combination of SWNTs and PCBM is promising for improving the device performance.7,8 Indeed, several authors have reported that the blend of SWNTs with P3HT or other conjugated polymers exhibited an increase in the photoresponse compared to the pristine polymer device.8 However, the η values of the SWNT–polymer devices are typically below 1%, which seldom exceed the η values of current high-performance devices based on the [60]PCBM–P3HT system as well as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM)–low band gap conjugated polymer systems (η = 5–7%).2,3 One plausible reason for the poor performance of the SWNT-based devices is the involvement of metallic SWNTs (m-SWNTs), which provide a nonradiative relaxation channel for photogenerated excitons and act as an efficient recombination pathway for charge carriers.9,10 Thus, the isolation of semiconducting SWNTs (s-SWNTs) from a mixture of s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs may offer a fundamental approach toward harnessing the potential of SWNTs.11 Another main reason is an insufficient electron-accepting ability of SWNTs compared to the fullerenes. In fact, some groups have suggested a lack of electron transfer (ET) between the photoexcited P3HT and SWNTs because of the exclusive occurrence of energy transfer,12,13 whereas other groups have concluded that photoinduced ET from the hybridized donor polymers to SWNTs would take place on the basis of intense quenching of the polymer fluorescence or the faster fluorescence decay, without observing the formation of charged species directly.14 Therefore, the photophysics of the donor polymer–SWNT hybrids is still a controversial issue.15
One of the most unique characteristics of SWNTs is their capability to accommodate suitable-sized organic molecules like tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), and fullerenes inside the hollow space.16 Such an inner space doping of SWNTs affords a practical opportunity to alter the electronic properties of SWNTs, i.e., band gap energies17,18 and carrier concentrations,19 retaining their intrinsic 1-dimensional (1-D) structure without introducing defects or chemical bonds to the outer surface. This is crucial when hybridizing SWNTs with conjugated donor polymers through non-covalent π–π interactions between the SWNT sidewalls and the polymer backbone. With this regard, fullerene-encapsulated SWNTs, known as fullerene peapods, are an important class of the dopant-encapsulated SWNTs. Indeed, the encapsulation of various fullerenes into SWNTs has produced functionalized SWNTs with controlled doping states and their electronic characteristics have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically.20–22
Recently, Hatakeyama et al. reported the infrared photovoltaic solar cells based on the configuration of SWNT/Si heterojunction.23 Importantly, C60 encapsulation into the SWNTs (denoted as C60@SWNT) resulted in enhanced device performance under infrared light illumination (1550 nm), as compared to that obtained with empty SWNTs. According to their claim, such an enhancement can be ascribed to ground state charge transfer (CT) interaction between C60 and SWNTs, which would enhance the p-type character of SWNTs, causing higher build-in potential in the SWNT/Si junction. The higher build-in potential was directly reflected to the higher open circuit voltage (100 mV vs. 57 mV) in the C60@SWNT-based device.23
On the other hand, the enhanced p-type character due to the CT interaction implies that the SWNT sidewalls become more electronically positive upon encapsulating C60, which would promote the ET from excited donor polymers to the C60@SWNT. Hence, we envisaged that encapsulating fullerenes into SWNTs inner space would control the ET behavior of the SWNTs. Despite the successful introduction of fullerene peapods into the photovoltaic devices by Hatakeyama et al.,23 nanohybrids comprised of peapods and donor polymers have not been prepared to examine the photophysics and photoelectrochemical properties of such hybrids.
In this study, we have prepared novel nanohybrids comprised of C60@SWNT or C70 encapsulated SWNTs (denoted as C70@SWNT) with P3HT for the first time. In addition, their photophysics and photoelectrochemical properties have been investigated and compared systematically with the composite of P3HT and SWNTs without the encapsulation of fullerenes. Especially, π–π interaction between SWNTs and P3HT was harnessed to dissolve the peapods in an organic solvent. Various experimental techniques including the transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion measurements were employed to disclose the interaction between P3HT and the fullerene peapods in the excited state. Moreover, the direct interaction between SWNTs and the bound P3HT was addressed by eliminating any effect from unbound polymers, which gave an insight into the reported ET behavior of SWNT–P3HT systems. Finally, thin films of the peapod–P3HT hybrids were fabricated on transparent conductive electrodes to access their photoelectrochemical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the preparation, photodynamics, and photoelectrochemical properties of the hybrid material comprised of peapods and conjugated donor polymer.
Experimental
General procedures

UV-vis-near infrared (NIR) absorption spectra of solutions and films were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a HORIBA SPEX Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer. Resonance Raman spectra were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR-800 equipped with a 2.33 eV (531.95 nm) laser. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were conducted by a Rigaku A2 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained from a JEOL JEM-2200FS. For sample preparation, SWNT dispersions in ethanol were dropped on microgrids (Cu mesh) and dried under vacuum. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were carried out with an Asylum Technology MFP-3D-SA in the AC mode. SWNT dispersions were spin-coated on freshly cleaved mica at 1400 rpm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted on a Shimadzu DTG-60H under a flowing air at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1.
Materials
SWNT soot produced by the direct-injection-pyrolytic-synthesis (DIPS)24 method was supplied by Nikkiso Co., Ltd. As-received soot was refluxed in 15% H2O2 aq., stirred in conc. HCl aq., and oxidized in air at 450 °C, affording purified, open-ended SWNTs (p-SWNTs). The diameter range of p-SWNTs was estimated as 1.3–1.6 nm from TEM observation. C60 (99.98%) and C70 (99.5%) were obtained from MTR Ltd. and used as-received. Encapsulation of fullerenes into p-SWNTs was conducted through gas-phase reaction.25 Namely, p-SWNTs (3 mg) and either C60 or C70 (15 mg) were sealed in a Pyrex tube under vacuum at 1.5 × 10−5 Torr and heated to 530 °C for 72 h. The raw materials were washed with toluene and CS2 to remove excess fullerenes, giving C60@SWNT and C70@SWNT. P3HT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with publicized regioregularity (RR) of 98%, number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 41000, and polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.5. All other solvents and chemicals were of reagent-grade quality, purchased commercially, and used without further purification.
Preparation of SWNT–P3HT hybrids
SWNTs (0.3 mg) and P3HT (3 mg) in chlorobenzene (10 mL) were sonicated using a tip-type sonicator (Astrason, XL2020; 140 W) for 10 min with continuous cooling by water flowing. The resultant dispersions were filtered through a 0.1 µm PTFE filter and washed with a copious amount of chlorobenzene to remove excess, unbound P3HT. Removal of unbound P3HT was confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectra of the final filtrate, showing negligible absorption due to P3HT. The resulting SWNT–P3HT hybrids without excess P3HT on the filter were redispersed in 10 mL of chlorobenzene with the aid of tip-sonication (140 W, 10 min). Finally, the prepared dispersions were diluted with chlorobenzene to exhibit absorbance of 0.24 at 1500 nm and stored for further analyses.
Time-resolved spectroscopies
A pump–probe technique was used to measure transient absorption spectra in the sub-picosecond to nanosecond time domain. The measurements were carried out using the instrument described previously.26 Briefly, a 600 nm pulse generated by an optical parametric amplifier pumped by a Ti:sapphire laser system (at 800 nm) was used for excitation and the transient spectra were recorded by a CCD detector coupled with a monochromator in the visible and near infrared ranges. A typical time resolution of the instrument was 150 fs (FWHM) and the details are described in the ESI†. An up-conversion method for fluorescence was employed to detect the ultrafast dynamics of emissive intermediates with a time resolution of ca. 200 fs. The second harmonic (400 nm) of the Ti:sapphire laser was used as an excitation source and the details are described elsewhere.26 The fluence of excitation beam was taken to below 1 mJ cm−2 for both pump–probe and up-conversion studies. The SWNT–P3HT hybrids remained intact under the employed conditions, which was confirmed by the negligible change in UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra before and after the measurements. In addition, the first and the last spectra during the pump–probe measurements were recorded without excitation, and no difference between those two spectra was observed.
Thin film fabrication of SWNT–P3HT hybrids
A thin film of the SWNT–P3HT hybrids on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode (Geomatec, Rs = 7–10 Ω □−1) was prepared by the filtration method27 with slight modification. In short, 1 mL of the SWNT–P3HT dispersion in chlorobenzene was filtered with a 0.1 µm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (φ = 25 mm). The remaining SWNT–P3HT film on the filter was first cut to suitable size (typically 7 × 14 mm) together with the attached filter paper and then put and clamped for a while on the ITO electrode, which was washed by sonication in 2-propanol and cleaned in an O3 atmosphere in advance. Finally, the filter was removed by drying the whole assembly with a hair drier, leaving the dark purple film of SWNT–P3HT hybrids on ITO.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
All photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode system using an ALS 630A electrochemical analyzer.28 The fabricated film as a working electrode was immersed into an electrolyte solution containing 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile. A Pt wire covered with a glass Luggin capillary, whose tip was located near the working electrode, was used as a quasi-reference electrode. A Pt coil was employed as a counter electrode. The potential measured was converted to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) scale by adding +0.05 V. The cathodic current direction with respect to the working electrode was set as positive polarity. A 500 W xenon lamp (USHIO, XB-50101AAA) was used as a light source. White light (λ > 380 nm, input power: 32 mW cm−2) or monochromatic light through a monochromator (Ritsu, MC-10N) was illuminated on the modified area of the working electrode (0.20 cm2) from the backside. The light intensity was monitored by an optical power meter (Anritsu, ML9002A) and corrected for calculation of IPCE values.
Results and discussion

TEM observation of C60 and C70 fullerene peapods

Fig. 1 shows a typical TEM image of the synthesized C60@SWNT. The image reveals that C60 molecules are closely packed inside the SWNT cage. Encapsulation of C60 inside the SWNTs is further confirmed by reduction of the (10) peak of SWNT bundles observed in XRD patterns, similar to the previous reports25b (Fig. S1, ESI†). Also, appearance of the Ag(2) mode of C60 at 1470 cm−1 in the resonance Raman spectrum is another evidence of the encapsulation25 (Fig. S2(b), ESI†). These results corroborate successful preparation of the C60 peapods. C70@SWNT was also fully characterized by TEM, XRD, and Raman scattering measurements as in the case of C60@SWNT (Fig. S1, S2(c), and S3, ESI†). The filling yields of the fullerenes inside SWNTs are roughly estimated as >80% for both cases from the TEM observations.

Characterization and optical properties of peapod–P3HT hybrids
Nanohybrids of P3HT with C60@SWNT or C70@SWNT were successfully prepared by sonicating the respective peapods with P3HT according to the procedure reported for p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids14a (see Experimental). The excess, unbound P3HT was removed by filtration and washing process to eliminate the effect of the unbound P3HT. The obtained blackish purple dispersions were quite stable and exhibited no discernible agglomeration for at least 1 month. Fig. 2 depicts AFM images of the peapod–P3HT hybrids as well as p-SWNT–P3HT spin-coated on mica. Fibrous structures of SWNTs are clearly observed for the samples. Furthermore, even isolated SWNTs with a height of 1–2 nm are seen, implying efficient debundling of the SWNTs by P3HT regardless of the fullerene encapsulation. The height profiles (Fig. S4, ESI†) display that the average diameters of the hybrids are virtually the same, i.e., 4.0 nm for C60@SWNT–P3HT, 4.2 nm for C70@SWNT–P3HT, and 4.1 nm for p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids, respectively. The influence of the encapsulated fullerenes on the bundle sizes is not recognized distinctly.

Fig. 3 shows UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the peapod–P3HT hybrids in chlorobenzene, together with those of p-SWNT–P3HT and pure P3HT solutions. The most distinctive feature in the spectra is the absorption peak corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO transition of P3HT, which is broadened and shifted from ∼460 nm in the pure P3HT solution (Fig. 3d) to ∼590 nm (Fig. 3a–c) upon hybridization with the SWNTs. On the other hand, absorption due to the peapods is discernible as a featureless band extending to the NIR region with a small bump around 1500 nm.29 The observed broadening and red-shift of the P3HT absorption band are analogous to previous SWNT–conjugated polymer hybrids without encapsulated fullerenes and thus can be attributed to the direct enhanced ordering of polymer chains on the SWNT sidewalls and/or SWNT-induced polymer/polymer ordering.13c In contrast, the effect of hybridization with P3HT on the absorption spectra of the peapods and p-SWNTs is almost negligible when compared with those of respective SWNTs dispersed in D2O with the aid of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The important finding to note here is that the similar trend is observed for the peapod–P3HT (Fig. 3a and b) and p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids (Fig. 3c). This means that the degree of interaction between the SWNTs and P3HT would not be changed significantly by the encapsulation of C60 or C70. On the other hand, the relative intensity of the P3HT absorption band, hence a relative amount of the bound P3HT in the hybrids, is slightly decreased for the C60@SWNT–P3HT and C70@SWNT–P3HT hybrids as compared to the p-SWNT–P3HT hybrid. Although the origin of this difference is unclear at the current stage, the partial positive charge on the outer surface of the peapods due to the ground state charge transfer (CT) from SWNT to encapsulated fullerenes may affect the binding energies for the complexation, leading to somewhat lower incorporation of P3HT into the hybrids.30TGA measurements on the p-SWNT–P3HT hybrid (Fig. S6, ESI†) show that the hybrid contains P3HT of nearly 50 wt%. By comparing the integrated absorption cross-section of the P3HT absorption (430–710 nm) as a function of wavenumber, amounts of incorporated P3HT in the C60@SWNT–P3HT and C70@SWNT–P3HT hybrids are estimated as 71% and 61% of that in the p-SWNT–P3HT.

Fig. 4 and S7 (ESI†) compare the fluorescence emission spectra of pure P3HT (λex = 457 nm) and the SWNT–P3HT hybrids (λex = 586 nm) in chlorobenzene. Note that the fluorescence emission from P3HT is completely quenched upon association with the peapods as well as p-SWNTs. Such quenching of P3HT emission is indicative of a strong interaction between the excited states of P3HT and SWNTs, leading to the efficient relaxation of the P3HT excited singlet state other than radiative decay, as disclosed by the time-resolved study below. Complete quenching of the P3HT fluorescence in the C60@SWNT–P3HT, C70@SWNT–P3HT, and p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids infers similar strength of interaction between the excited P3HT and the SWNTs irrespective of the fullerene encapsulation.

Excitation wavelength (λex) was set at the peak position of P3HT-derived absorption, i.e., 586 nm for C60@SWNT–P3HT and p-SWNT–P3HT and 457 nm for P3HT. Absorbances of the P3HT moieties of the SWNT–P3HT hybrids were adjusted to be identical (∼0.1) to those of P3HT at the respective peak positions. 
Excited state dynamics of peapod–P3HT hybrids
Information on the ultrafast photodynamics of the p-SWNT–P3HT hybrid was provided by the pump–probe study in the sub-picosecond time domain. Fig. 5a displays transient absorption component spectra and corresponding decay kinetics at 580 and 700 nm (inset) for the p-SWNT–P3HT hybrid in chlorobenzene obtained with a laser excitation at 600 nm, where absorption of the P3HT moiety becomes nearly maximal. The two components (0.14 ps and 0.74 ps) are reasonably derived from the global analysis. The reconstructed time-resolved spectrum at 0 ps is roughly characterized by the ground state bleaching of P3HT absorption, thus confirming that the absorption majority of the photoexcited species arises from the P3HT moiety in the hybrid. The fast decaying component with a lifetime of 0.14 ps exhibits broad bleaching at 500–800 nm together with gradually increasing absorption with increasing wavelength at 900–1100 nm. This NIR absorption is close to that observed for the P3HT excited singlet state.3c,31,32 Thus, we assigned this component as the P3HT excited singlet state. The difference in the absorption spectra may result from the restricted conformation of P3HT in the excited state in which the P3HT is bound to the SWNTs.
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption decay component spectra of (a) p-SWNT–P3HT and (b) C60@SWNT–P3HT in chlorobenzene obtained with global two-component fit of the data. The samples were excited at 600 nm. The fitted time constants are displayed in the respective figures. Dotted lines show recalculated time-resolved spectra at 0 delay. Insets display time traces of transient signals at 580 (circle) and 700 nm (square). Solid lines represent the results of bi-exponential fitting. 
On the other hand, the slow decaying component with a lifetime of 0.74 ps has a negative peak at 590 nm, a positive peak at 690 nm, and a broad shoulder at 800–1000 nm. According to the previous studies on the excited state dynamics of regioregular P3HT in the film state, these positive signals could be attributed to the one-electron oxidized radical cation of P3HT, generated by ET from the P3HT excited singlet state to p-SWNT.3c,31,32 However, given the extremely fast formation and relaxation behavior, it is rather dangerous to conclude that this component corresponds to the charge-separated state. Another insight into the slow decaying component arose from the fluorescent up-conversion measurement (Fig. S8, ESI†). The sample solution containing the p-SWNT–P3HT hybrid was excited at 400 nm and the emission at 690 nm was monitored, on the assumption that fluorescence from the P3HT moiety in the hybrid resembles that from a pure P3HT film, emitting around 700 nm. The obtained decay trace disclosed an ultrafast component with a lifetime of 0.75 ps, which is in good agreement with that of the slow decaying component (0.74 ps) obtained by the transient absorption component spectra.33 Hence, the slow decaying component in the transient absorption component spectra is emissive, ruling out the possibility of formation of the charge-separated state. Instead, an emissive exciplex state is likely to be formed as the transient species. In fact, exciplex formation in the excited donor–acceptor systems interacting in very close proximity has been seen frequently.26,34 For instance, we have demonstrated that porphyrin–fullerene linked dyads with a short spacer generate an exciplex state between the porphyrin and fullerene from their excited states.34 The exciplex state decays to the ground state or to the charge-separated state, depending on the nature of the spacer and the surrounding environment. Therefore, as in the cases of the porphyrin–fullerene systems, partial charge transfer would occur from the excited P3HT to p-SWNT to generate the exciplex, which rapidly decays to the ground state rather than to the complete charge-separated state because of the strong interaction between the P3HT and p-SWNT.35
The results obtained here are in stark contrast to several reports on the SWNT–P3HT hybrids where the occurrence of ET from the P3HT excited state to SWNTs is claimed.14,15 In this regard, we have to point out that in almost all of those reports, excess, unbound P3HT is not removed from the solutions or composite films, whereas in our study excess P3HT is removed by filtration and washing procedure (vide supra). Accordingly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first photophysical measurement to evaluate the interaction between SWNTs and bound conjugated polymers in the excited state. In contrast, interaction between SWNTs and P3HT by indirect contact would influence the excited state event, if the excess polymers were not removed. Therefore, the asserted ET behavior in the previous reports could originate from direct ET from the unbound, but weakly coupled P3HT to SWNTs. Another plausible explanation is that the involvement of the unbound, surrounding P3HT may promote the conversion of exciplex, formed at the interfaces of SWNTs and attached P3HT, into a charge-separated state.1d,13b Meanwhile, D'Souza et al. have recently revealed that the ET dynamics of noncovalently linked SWNT–donor hybrids considerably depends on the chirality of SWNTs.36 Also, Nicholas et al. have pointed out the inability of SWNTs with a thick diameter of >1 nm to form the staggered band alignment (type-II heterojunction) with conjugated donor polymers including P3HT, based on their elaborated spectroscopic studies on the SWNT–conjugated polymer hybrids dispersed in chloroform.13b The SWNTs used in our work possess an average diameter of ca. 1.4 nm, indicating the inability to form desirable type-II heterojunctions with bound P3HT. The absence of a type-II heterojunction means that the photogenerated excitons cannot be dissociated efficiently at the interface between SWNTs and P3HT. Thus, these recent findings may rationalize the results of our time-resolved measurements.
It is noteworthy that similar behavior of the time-resolved transient absorption spectra is noted for the C60@SWNT–P3HT and C70@SWNT–P3HT hybrids (Fig. 5b and S9, ESI†). Namely, we can see the fast decaying component with a lifetime of ∼0.1 to 0.3 ps, assigned as the P3HT excited singlet state, and the slow decaying component with a lifetime of ∼0.8 ps, assigned as the exciplex state. Note that the characteristic absorption due to C60 and C70 radical anion (1080 and 880 nm, respectively) is not detected.37 These results suggest little participation of the encapsulated fullerenes in the excited state event and their inability to form the charge-separated state, contrary to our expectation. Rather, our results are consistent with those of the electrochemical study by Kataura et al. on the C60 and C70 peapods, where no fullerene-related faradaic processes are detected and the electrochemical process is dominated by the capacitive double-layer charging of the outer wall.38
Thin-film fabrication of peapod–P3HT hybrids
Thin films of C60@SWNT–P3HT, C70@SWNT–P3HT, and p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids were prepared on ITO electrodes using the filtration method (denoted as ITO/C60@SWNT–P3HT, ITO/C70@SWNT–P3HT, and ITO/p-SWNT–P3HT).27Fig. 6A depicts a representative AFM image of the film surface of C60@SWNT–P3HT hybrid, which reveals the entangled bundles of SWNTs lying horizontally on the ITO electrode. The thickness of the film was determined as ∼250 nm by analyzing the AFM height profile of the edge part of the film. Films of C70@SWNT–P3HT and p-SWNT–P3HT hybrids showed similar surface morphology and thickness.

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the modified ITO electrodes are illustrated in Fig. 6B. In general, the absorption features of the thin films are largely similar to those in the corresponding chlorobenzene solutions (Fig. 3). Slight broadening of the P3HT absorption bands is discernible and is attributed to further interaction between P3HT and SWNTs and between the P3HT polymers in the film states. The broad absorption of the fabricated films in addition to the relatively high absorptivity in the visible to NIR region makes these films suitable for harvesting the solar energy. Additionally, the deposited films are sufficiently robust for the photoelectrochemical measurements (vide infra).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in deaerated acetonitrile containing 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2 with the modified ITO electrodes as a working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and an I−/I3−reference electrode. Fig. 7A displays a representative photocurrent response of the ITO/C60@SWNT–P3HT electrode illuminated with white light (λ > 380 nm) at an applied potential of 0 V vs. SCE. The repeated on–off cycles of illumination corroborate the immediacy, stability, and reproducibility of the photocurrent response of the electrode. A control experiment of the unmodified ITO electrode exhibited much smaller photocurrents under the same condition, confirming the role of the C60@SWNT–P3HT film toward harvesting incident light and generating electron flow from the ITO electrode to the electrolyte solution through the C60@SWNT–P3HT film during the operation of the photoelectrochemical devices.39 Importantly, the ITO/C60@SWNT–P3HT electrode did not show any degradation behavior during the measurements, indicating sufficient photostability of peapod–P3HT hybrids toward photoelectrochemical application. Applying a negative bias potential of −50 mV vs. SCE yields 1.3 times higher photocurrent (2.1 µA cm−2) than that obtained without applying the bias potential (1.6 µA cm−2), while photocurrent is decreased by a factor of 2.7 under a positive bias potential of 50 mV vs. SCE (0.6 µA cm−2). Increased charge separation and the facilitated transport of charge carriers under negative bias potential are responsible for the enhanced photocurrent generation. Similar photoelectrochemical properties were obtained for the ITO/C70@SWNT–P3HT and ITO/p-SWNT–P3HT devices.

Electrolyte: 0.5 M LiI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile. 
To gain further insights into the photoelectrochemical properties of the SWNT–P3HT hybrids, we measured the wavelength dependent incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The IPCE values are calculated by normalizing the photocurrent densities for incident light energy and intensity and by use of the expression:IPCE (%) = 100 × 1240 × i/(Win × λ)where i is the photocurrent density (A cm−2), Win is the incident light intensity (W cm−2), and λ is the excitation wavelength (nm).

Fig. 7B depicts the photocurrent action spectra of the ITO electrodes modified with the SWNT–P3HT hybrids. All the devices exhibit similar spectral features, where the IPCE value decreases with increasing wavelength. Of particular interest to note here is that the photocurrent response resulting from the absorption due to the P3HT moieties is totally absent in all cases. In other words, the absorption due to the P3HT moieties does not contribute to the photocurrent generation. This agrees well with the results of the time-resolved spectroscopies, where the photoexcited P3HT rapidly relaxes to yield the emissive partial CT state, i.e., exciplex, and subsequently decays to the ground state (<1 ps), without generating the charge-separated state. Therefore, the photocurrent generation is triggered by the direct excitation of s-SWNTs and subsequent hole transfer to the ITO electrode and electron transfer to the I−/I3− couple in the electrolyte as proposed for analogous photoelectrochemical devices using the SWNT-modified semiconductor electrodes.39 Note that the excitation of m-SWNTs leads to the rapid relaxation from the excited state without generating the photocurrent.9 In fact, the shapes of the action spectra shown in Fig. 7B parallel those of the absorption and action spectra obtained for the ITO/C60@SWNT, ITO/C70@SWNT, and ITO/p-SWNT electrodes, which are fabricated from respective SDBS dispersions in a similar manner (Fig. S10, ESI†). These results corroborate that the photoexcitation of s-SWNTs is responsible for the photocurrent generation.
It is interesting to mention the similarity between the present results with those obtained for the covalently linked SWNT–porphyrin hybrids.40 Namely, when deposited on semiconductor electrodes, the hybrids did not show photocurrent response corresponding to the absorption of the porphyrin moieties, despite the considerable quenching of the fluorescence emission from the porphyrin moieties. We have concluded that the exciplex formation between the porphyrin singlet excited state and SWNTs and the subsequent decay to the ground state is the most probable reason for the absence of porphyrin-related photocurrent generation, as in the present case. Thus, these two works concertedly offer an implication that SWNTs do not act as an excellent electron acceptor, supporting the claim from several groups.12,13
Maximum IPCE values obtained at 400 nm are 1.1%, 1.0%, and 1.1% for the ITO/C60@SWNT–P3HT, ITO/C70@SWNT–P3HT, and ITO/p-SWNT–P3HT devices. Rather low IPCE values (∼1%) may be at least partially ascribed to the presence of unseparated m-SWNTs, which promote nonradiative relaxation of the photogenerated excitons in s-SWNTs and offer an efficient recombination site for the separated charge carriers at the SWNT–ITO and/or SWNT–electrolyte solution interfaces.9,10 On the other hand, almost the same IPCE values for the three systems show that the encapsulation of fullerene molecules does not improve the photocurrent generation. This matches the fact that the encapsulated C60 and C70 do not alter the excited state dynamics of the SWNT–P3HT hybrids, where fast exciplex formation between the SWNT shell and P3HT and subsequent rapid relaxation to the ground state are dominant (Fig. 5). Also, the encapsulated fullerenes are not likely to exert significant impact on the electronic states of SWNTs so that they do not affect the photoelectrochemical properties significantly. This is in remarkable contrast to the recent Hatakeyama's report where encapsulating C60 into SWNTs leads to the improved photovoltaic performance of the SWNTs/Si heterojunction cells through adjusting the Fermi level of SWNTs.23 Difference in the interaction between the encapsulated fullerene molecule and our DIPS SWNTs or their SWNTs prepared with the arc-discharge method would account for the contrasting results. Additionally, the difference may result from the excitation source (400–750 nm vs. 1550 nm) and the device configurations (three-electrode wet cellvs. two-electrode dry cell).
Conclusions
Novel nanocarbon hybrids of C60- and C70-peapods with P3HT have been prepared and their excited state dynamics and photoelectrochemical properties have been studied for the first time. The AFM observation disclosed successful dissolution of the fullerene peapods into an organic solvent by π–π interaction with P3HT, as in the case of p-SWNT. The steady state fluorescence emission measurements showed the complete quenching of the P3HT fluorescence by incorporating SWNTs, regardless of the fullerene encapsulation. The transient absorption and fluorescence up-conversion technique revealed the excited state dynamics of the hybrids, where the short-lived P3HT singlet excited state (∼0.2 ps) relaxes to yield the exciplex state with the SWNTs and then rapidly decays to the ground state (<1 ps). Significant difference in the photodynamics upon the encapsulation of C60 or C70 was not detected, implying that the electronic structures of the SWNTs are retained irrespective of the encapsulation of C60 or C70 inside the SWNTs. The photoelectrochemical devices consisting of the peapod–P3HT hybrids exhibited almost the same IPCE values as those for the p-SWNT–P3HT-based device, which is consistent with the results of the time-resolved spectroscopic measurements. Thus, the results obtained here corroborate that the encapsulation of C60 or C70 has no significant impact on the photodynamics and the photoelectrochemical properties of the intrinsic SWNTs. Thus, such fundamental information on the fullerene peapod–conjugated polymer hybrids may be important to develop photoactive molecular devices in which the encapsulated molecules can be used for other functions (i.e., charge transport) without affecting the intrinsic properties of the carbon nanotubes.

This bump can be assigned as the first van Hove transitions in s-SWNTs (E11S) with diameter of ca. 1.3 nm. In our study, peaks arising from transitions between the second van Hove transitions in s-SWNTs (E22S) and the first van Hove transitions in m-SWNTs (E11M) are hardly resolved, probably due to incomplete isolation of SWNT bundles.

Broader context

            Nanocarbon materials, such as fullerene, carbon nanotube and graphene, are one of the key components for realizing highly efficient organic optoelectronics. In particular, the one-dimensional structure of carbon nanotubes enables us to construct the ideal percolation pathway for charge carriers within thin films. Thus, utilizing carbon nanotube–conjugated donor polymer composites would be a fair direction toward constructing the high performance organic photovoltaics. On the other hand, the inner space of carbon nanotubes allows us to control the electronic structure by encapsulating suitable-sized molecules. In this context, fullerene-encapsulated nanotubes, so-called fullerene peapods, provide a fundamental scientific interest regarding the impact of the fullerene encapsulation on the photodynamics and photovoltaic properties of the carbon nanotube–conjugated polymer hybrids. Here, we address this issue for the first time by using novel hybrid material of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and single-walled carbon nanotubes encapsulating C60 or C70.

Excitation wavelength (λex) was set at the peak position of P3HT-derived absorption, i.e., 586 nm for C60@SWNT–P3HT and p-SWNT–P3HT and 457 nm for P3HT. Absorbances of the P3HT moieties of the SWNT–P3HT hybrids were adjusted to be identical (∼0.1) to those of P3HT at the respective peak positions.
