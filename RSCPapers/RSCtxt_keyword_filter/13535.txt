    , Accepted 5th November 2018First published on 5th November 2018AbstractEfficient perovskite devices consist of a perovskite film sandwiched between charge selective layers, in order to avoid non-radiative recombination. A common metal oxide used as a p-type or hole transport layer is molybdenum oxide. MoO3 is of particular interest for its very large work function, which allows it to be used both as an interfacial charge transfer material and a dopant for organic semiconductors. However, high quality and high work function MoO3 is typically thermally evaporated in a vacuum. An alternative solution-processable high work function material is phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), which is stable, commercially available and environmentally friendly. In this Communication, we show the first application of PMA in efficient vacuum processed perovskite devices. We found that the direct growth of perovskite films onto PMA leads to strong charge carrier recombination, hindering the solar cell photovoltage. Using an energetically suitable selective transport layer placed between PMA and the perovskite film, solar cells with efficiency >13% as well as LEDs with promising quantum efficiency can be obtained.
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are being extensively investigated for applications in thin-film solar cells1–3 and, more recently, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).4 Their success is due to the abundance of precursor compounds, ease of obtaining high quality perovskite thin films by simple coating methods5,6 and to the unique set of physical properties, such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier recombination lifetime and defect tolerance,7,8 among others. In model perovskite absorbers such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI), free carriers are rapidly generated after light absorption.9 Hence, in order to limit charge recombination, efficient solar cells consist of a perovskite film sandwiched between charge selective layers, typically organic or metal oxide semiconductors.10,11 Organic semiconductors are advantageous because they are chemically tuned to fulfill specific properties (mobility, energetics), and can be processed at low temperature from solution or by sublimation. On the other hand, metal oxides are intrinsically more stable towards environmental agents, and can strongly enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells.12–14 Common metal oxides used as p-type or hole transport layers (HTLs) are nickel oxide,15,16 tungsten oxide17,18 and molybdenum oxide.19–21 The high work function of anode buffer layers is beneficial for hole injection/extraction in LEDs or solar cells, as it allows matching the electrode work function with the HOMO of the hole transport material. An important example is the use of self-organized buffer layers consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a perfluorinated polymeric acid, resulting in very large work function layers.22–24 Among inorganic materials, molybdenum trioxide is of particular interest for its very large work function, which allows it to be used both as an interfacial charge transfer material25 and a dopant for organic semiconductors.26 The latter property is the reason for its frequent use as an interlayer between an organic semiconductor and the electrode, as it ensures an ohmic contact between the two.27 Although MoO3 can be solution-processed at mild temperature in the form of nanoparticles or when mixed with suitable reagents,28–30 high quality and low work function MoO3 is typically thermally evaporated in a vacuum. An alternative solution-processable high work function material is phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), a polyoxometallate with a central phosphorus atom surrounded by twelve molybdenum oxyanions.31 It is stable, commercially available and environmentally friendly, making it an interesting candidate as a high work function interface in organic solar cells and LEDs.32,33 In this Communication, we show the first application of PMA in efficient vacuum processed perovskite solar cells. We found that the direct growth of perovskite films onto PMA leads to strong charge carrier recombination, hindering the solar cell photovoltage. Using an energetically suitable selective transport layer placed between PMA and the perovskite film, solar cells with efficiency >13% as well as LEDs with promising quantum efficiency can be obtained.
PMA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The solution was diluted to 10 mg mL−1 and spin-coated onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates at 1500 rpm for 1 minute. The film thickness was approximately 10 nm, as determined by using a mechanical profilometer. The film was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen filled glove box, following a previously developed method.32
The surface morphology was initially investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. 1a). We found a very flat and homogeneous surface, with fine and compact aggregates resulting in a root-mean-square roughness Rrms as low as 1.1 nm, calculated over a 25 μm2 area (for comparison, ITO has an Rrms typically <3 nm (ref. 34)). A more significant quantification of the surface quality for optoelectronic devices is the peak-to-valley roughness Rpv, which directly correlates with the device leakage current.35 Over the same area, the maximum observed Rpv was 10.6 nm, well below that of the typical ITO substrates employed in most research type solar cells (>50 nm). Apart from the morphology, a key feature of PMA is the large work function (ϕ), which makes it suitable as a hole transport or injection layer (HTL and HIL, respectively). Hence we characterized the material by a combination of air photoemission spectroscopy and Kelvin probe measurements. The absolute ionization potential (IE) of PMA was estimated by linear extrapolation of the cubic root of photoemission (Fig. 1b), and was found to be 5.55 eV. We then measured by Kelvin probe the contact potential difference (CPD) of the PMA/ITO substrate, obtaining a value of 0.383 ± 0.002 eV, respectively. The absolute PMA work function (ϕPMA) can be calculated taking into account the work function of the calibrated tip (ϕtip = 4.64 eV), as ϕPMA = ϕTip + CPDPMA = 5.05 eV. Taking into account a bandgap of approximately 3 eV, estimated by the onset of optical absorption (Fig. 1c), we can estimate the valence band maximum at −5.5 eV and the conduction band minimum at −2.5 eV from the vacuum level. We observed some differences as compared to literature data, which might be due to the different techniques used to estimate the electronic properties of the material.33,36 The large work function suggests PMA to be slightly p-type, in accordance with previous reports.32 In view of the favorable morphological and electronic characteristics of PMA, we used it as the substrate to prepare vacuum-processed perovskite solar cells, using methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) as the thin-film absorber. The MAPI films were prepared by dual-source thermal vacuum deposition by controlling the sublimation rates of the methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2 precursors, as reported elsewhere.37 The solar cell structure used (Fig. 2a) was ITO/PMA (10 nm)/MAPI (500 nm)/C60 (25 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm), where the fullerene C60 is the electron transport layer (ETL) and BCP is bathocuproine, a common electrode interlayer used in high efficiency solar cells.38–40 All organic films and the reflecting metal were sublimed in vacuum chambers.

The solar cells were not encapsulated and were characterized in a nitrogen filled glove box. The solar cell with the PMA/MAPI interface showed a rather low spectral response, with the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 2b) going from about 0.35 at a short wavelength to approximately 0.5–0.6 in the spectral range close to the bandgap of the perovskite. The EQE is low when considering the thickness of the perovskite film (500 nm), which should allow quantitative harvesting of the photons with energy above the perovskite bandgap (1.6 eV). The reduced spectral response results in a low current density at short circuit (Jsc, 13.9 mA cm−2), as observed by measuring the current density vs. voltage (J–V) curve under solar simulated illumination (Fig. 2c, photovoltaic parameters in Table 1). The current losses are likely associated with charge carrier recombination, as suggested by the low open circuit voltage (Voc, 0.84 V) and fill factor (FF, 55.4%). Similar phenomena have been observed in perovskite solar cells where MAPI was directly vacuum processed onto the metal oxide.41 In that case, a thin intrinsic charge selective layer was found beneficial for the device functioning, in particular to avoid charge recombination. Hence we prepared solar cells by placing a thin layer of N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine (TaTm, 10 nm) between PMA and the perovskite. The solar cell spectral response was found to substantially recover in the presence of TaTm, with EQE values in the range of 0.7–0.9 through the whole visible spectrum (Fig. 2b). As a consequence, the Jsc was substantially improved up to 20.9 mA cm−2, which is comparable to state-of-the-art vacuum processed perovskite solar cells.37,40 The photovoltage was also recovered (1.05 V), as expected when the perovskite absorber is sandwiched between charge selective layers (TaTm and C60, in this case). The FF was slightly improved to 60.6%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3%.

In order to investigate the origin of the marked differences among devices with or without the TaTm HTL placed between PMA and the perovskite, we run extensive morphological, structural and optical characterization (Fig. S1†). From electron microscopy we could not observe any difference depending on the substrate used, and both MAPI films appear homogeneous and compact, with the grain size in the order of 100–300 nm. Also the optical absorption and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films deposited on PMA and TaTm did not evidence a dependence on the substrate used (Fig. S1c and d†). The absorbance in the visible range and the onset of absorption are essentially equal. This and the XRD patterns, closely resembling the expected reference, suggest the formation of high quality polycrystalline MAPI films both on PMA and TaTm. Hence the origin of the very different optoelectronic behavior is most likely to be found at the very interface between the perovskite absorber and the underlying functional film. It has been recently demonstrated how the mechanism of MAPI film formation is dependent on the chemical nature of the substrate (organic vs. metal oxide).42,43 Due to a catalytic activity of metal oxides, several organic byproducts are formed at the beginning of the deposition due to the degradation of methylammonium iodide. This delays perovskite crystallization and results in a thin interfacial layer with a stoichiometry deviating from the expected one.43 Such an interfacial layer can be responsible for the strongly augmented charge recombination observed when our MAPI films are vacuum-deposited on PMA, whose chemical structure resembles the surface of a metal oxide. Besides the strong improvement observed upon insertion of TaTm, however, the PCE of the solar cells is still limited by the FF, which suggests a limited conductivity of the PMA film. On the other hand, the charge extraction appears to be excellent, as can be observed from the nearly flat current density at a low bias. Hence, PMA does lead to the formation of low barrier (ohmic) contacts between TaTm and the ITO electrode. This makes PMA an alternative to the recently presented p-type dopant interlayer with a similar configuration.
Finally, we also characterized the electroluminescence characteristics of the optimized device with the ITO/PMA/TaTm hole injection interface. The device layout is the same as in Fig. 2a, and electroluminescence can be measured by applying a forward bias while measuring the emitted photon flux as the power density in an integrating sphere. The J–V curve (Fig. 3a) shows a low leakage current, indicative of a good quality diode, and a steep current injection starting at about 0.5 V. This fast rise in current density corroborates the before mentioned observation that PMA enables a very low barrier for charge transfer from the ITO electrode to TaTm and subsequently the perovskite film. Electroluminescence was detected at a bias as low as 1 V, and the power output increased rapidly until reaching approximately 2000 μW cm−2. These parameters correspond to a maximum external quantum efficiency for electroluminescence (EQEEL) of 0.06% (Fig. 3b). Such EQEEL is approximately 1 order of magnitude lower as compared to state-of-the-art vacuum deposited solar cells,37 indicating that non-radiative recombination takes place, limiting the power output of the solar cells.

In summary, we have used phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as an alternative solution-processed interlayer to enhance hole extraction in perovskite solar cells. We characterized the morphology and energetics of the material, and employed them to enhance carrier collection at the ITO/perovskite interface. We found that the direct growth of methylammonium lead iodide onto PMA leads to high carrier recombination, due to a different growth of the perovskite or to the lack of an electron blocking effect, which limits the device efficiency. This phenomenon can be alleviated by inserting a selective charge transport layer (TaTm) on top of PMA, resulting in high photovoltage solar cells. PMA is a very effective interlayer for these p-i-n type solar cells, as it effectively removes the charge transfer barrier between the ITO electrode and the organic hole transporting layer. Due to this very low voltages are required for charge injection and light emission when the diode is driven under a forward bias. The solar cell performance appears to be limited by the conductivity of the PMA layer, which may be overcome by post-deposition treatments or doping strategies.13,18 However, here we have demonstrated the potential of this simple solution processable hole injection layer.
