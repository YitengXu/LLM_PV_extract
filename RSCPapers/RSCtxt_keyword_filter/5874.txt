    , Accepted 28th March 2014First published on 31st March 2014AbstractThe charge transfer effect of different meso-substituted linkages on porphyrin analogue 1 (A1, B1 and C1) was theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. The calculated geometry parameters and natural bond orbital analysis reveal that the twisted conformation between porphyrin macrocycle and meso-substituted linkages leads to blocking of the conjugation of the conjugated backbone, and the frontier molecular orbital plot shows that the intramolecular charge transfer of A1, B1 and C1 hardly takes place. In an attempt to improve the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer ability of the meso-linked zinc porphyrin sensitizer, a strong electron-withdrawing group (CN) was introduced into the anchoring group of analogue 1 forming analogue 2 (A2, B2 and C2). The density difference plot of A2, B2 and C2 shows that the charge transfer properties dramatically improved. The electron injection process has been performed using TDDFT; the direct charge-transfer transition in the A2-(TiO2)38 interacting system takes place; our results strongly indicated that introducing electron-withdrawing groups into the acceptor part of porphyrin dyes can fine-tune the effective conjugation length of the π-spacer and improve intramolecular charge transfer properties, consequently inducing the electron injection process from the anchoring group of the porphyrin dye to the (TiO2)38 surface which may improve the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. Our calculated results can provide valuable information and a promising outlook for computation-aided sensitizer design with anticipated good properties in further experimental synthesis.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) offer new opportunities towards environmental friendliness and are low-cost fabrication alternatives to the conventional silicon-based solar cell.1,2 The most successful sensitizers were first reported by Grätzel's group (1991) while considering the use of ruthenium complexes as sensitizers, promising the greatest performance for a solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 10–11% under standard global air mass (AM) 1.5 solar conditions.3–5 However, ruthenium dyes are very expensive due to the lack of abundance of natural ruthenium together with their undesirable environmental impact. Therefore, research attention is now directed toward finding cheaper and safer dyes, such as organic-based dyes or ruthenium-free dyes.6,7 Among organic-based dyes, synthetic porphyrins have attracted much interest as light harvesters in DSCs due to their ability to modify and tune the photo-physical properties via optimizing the β- or meso-substituents of the porphyrin core.8–12 The highest-performing porphyrin-based DSC sensitizer is a zinc porphyrin sensitizer, namely YD2-oC8, co-sensitized with an organic dye (Y123) on a TiO2 film using a cobalt-based electrolyte to enhance the photo-voltage of the device, which shows an overall conversion efficiency of 12.3% under standard AM 1.5 one-sun irradiation.13 The UV/visible absorption spectra of porphyrins are of importance when designing them as sensitizers for solar cells. The natural role in light harvesting is strong absorption in the range of 400–700 nm (400–450 nm: Soret (B)-band and 500–700 nm: Q-band).14 This is caused by the splitting of the key frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of Gouterman's four orbital model (HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 orbitals)15 which has been widely used in explaining the absorption spectra of porphyrins. According to this theory, the absorption bands in a porphyrin system arise from a transition between two HOMOs and two LUMOs. The HOMOs were calculated to be nearly degenerate the a1u and a2u orbitals while the LUMOs were calculated to be a degenerate set of the eg orbitals (Fig. 1a). Transitions between these orbitals gave rise to two excited states, both of 1Eu character. Orbital mixing splits these two states in energy by a configuration interaction into two pairs of degenerate orbitals, creating a higher energy 1Eu state with greater oscillator strength, giving rise to the Soret band, and a lower energy 1Eu state with less oscillator strength, giving rise to the Q-band (Fig. 1b). It is the identities of the metal center and the substituents on the ring that affect the relative energies of these transitions.

To develop a highly efficient porphyrin sensitizer for DSCs, a dye must be designed to have the following properties: (i) the dye should absorb light in wide regions, particularly in the visible and near-IR regions to produce a large photocurrent response, (ii) it must contain attachment groups such as carboxylate or cyanoacrylate moieties to anchor the TiO2 surface and inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, (iii) the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) must be situated slightly above the conduction band of the TiO2, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) must be located below the redox couple of the electrolyte solution such as I−/I3−, (iv) the HOMO and LUMO should localize plentifully on the donor and the acceptor of the dye, respectively, in order to result in efficient charge separation. According to DSC requirements, the basic structure of a dye should comprise an electron donor (D) (e.g. carbazole, triphenylamine, porphyrin, coumarin), a conjugated bridge (π) (e.g. benzene, thiophene, furan), and an electron acceptor (A) (e.g. carboxylic acid, cyanoacrylic acid) to form a D–π–A system.16–21 This system plays an important role in producing the photo-induced intramolecular-charge transfer (ICT) property due to its being suitably tuned by matching a variety of appropriate groups.
In order to establish guidelines for the design of efficient DSC sensitizers, quantum chemical calculations were used to provide a useful theoretical basis for the geometric and electronic structures of sensitizer materials.22–24 Walsh et al. reported the use of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with B3LYP to predict a series of Zn-tetraphenylporphines with different conjugated functional groups at the β-position.25 Ma et al. have presented the use of DFT/TDDFT as a screening tool to predict the sensitizer candidates of porphyrin analogues, which have 11 different kinds of substituted bridges.26 Their results reveal that the candidates selected are very promising and provide good performances as sensitizers, challenging the current photoelectric conversion efficiency record of 7.1% of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.9 Recently, Balanay et al. predicted the trends in absorption spectra and photovoltaic properties using the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) theoretical method.27 These reveal that the computational calculations are capable of providing good performances, which show a promising outlook for computation-aided sensitizer design with anticipated good properties.
Previous results have shown that porphyrins ZnTCPP (TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenylporphine) have almost indistinguishable electron injection and recombination kinetics compared to the ruthenium dye N3;28 consequently they may eventually compete with devices based on Ru-complexes. Previous studies indicated that the π-conjugation in the β-substituted porphyrins has a limited effect of extending the absorption spectra to a greater wavelength.29 The best strategy to extend the π-conjugation is thus to functionalize the target porphyrin at the meso-positions.30 Moreover, the close π–π aggregations of porphyrins in solution lead to self-quenching and reduction of electron injection into TiO2 that could decrease the efficiency of the sensitizer. This effect can be reduced by attaching bulky aryl substituents in the meso-position of the porphyrin core.31
Therefore, the goal of the present work is to investigate the effects of different meso-substituted linkages for A1, B1, and C1 porphyrin analogues based on porphyrins ZnTCPP (as shown in Fig. 2), with typical porphyrin moieties as donors and the carboxyl-containing groups as acceptors. Moreover, we designed a new dye-sensitizer by replacing the acetic acid moiety with cyanoacrylic acid to improve the photoinduced intramolecular-charge transfer ability of a meso-linked zinc porphyrin sensitizer, which is a challenging problem for achieving efficient charge separation to inject electrons effectively into the conduction band of TiO2 in the DSC devices. The geometry of our newly-designed sensitizers, electronic structures and excited-state properties was reasonably investigated theoretically. Finally, the calculated results were compared with our experimental results32 which will be published at a later date. The successful study of these theoretical calculations may be seen as the first attempt to tune the molecular orbital energy levels and improve the light absorption properties in the screening step, providing newly designed effective sensitizers for further experimental synthesis.

2. Computational details
The geometries and electronic structures of A1, B1, and C1 porphyrin analogues were theoretically studied based on Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT). Beck's three parameter gradient-corrected hybrid functional and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP)33–35 with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set were used for full geometry optimization without any symmetry constraints. The natural bond orbital (NBO) was obtained using a POP = NBO keyword. The vertical excitation energies for the 20 lowest spin-allowed singlet transitions were investigated using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)36 on the B3LYP hybrid functional. In order to increase the accuracy of TDDFT calculations, several Pople basis sets such as 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-311+G(d,p) were used. The solvent effect, as well as the electrostatic solute–solvent interactions in the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solvent, was evaluated using the SCRF approach in the conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) framework.37 All DFT and TDDFT calculations were done using the Gaussian09 program package.38 The UV/Vis absorption spectra were simulated using the SWizard program (Revision 4.6),39 using the Gaussian model with the half-bandwidth (Δ1/2) which was taken to be equal to 3000 cm−1. Density of state (DOS) analysis was performed using the GausSum program.40
To gain insight into the electron injection capability of dyes, adsorption of dyes on the (TiO2)38 cluster was performed with DFT calculations using the DMol3 program41,42 in Materials Studio version 5.5. The structure of (TiO2)38 was composed of 38 TiO2 units, which modeled a TiO2 nanoparticle, as in the researchers’ previous report.43 The (TiO2)38 configuration was fully optimized using the generalized gradient-corrected approximation (GGA) method. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)44 functional was used to account for exchange–correlation effects with the DNP basis set. The core electrons were treated with DFT-semicore pseudopotentials (DSPPs).42 The real space cut-off value was set to 5.0 Å, while the convergence criteria for optimization are 2.0 × 10−5 Ha, 4.0 × 10−3 Ha/Å, and 5.0 × 10−3 Å for energy, gradient and atomic displacements, respectively. After optimization, the adsorption energy (Eads) of the dye on the (TiO2)38 cluster was obtained using the following equation:Eads = Edye + ETiO2 − Edye+TiO2where Edye is the total energy of the isolated dye, ETiO2 is the total energy of the (TiO2)38 cluster, and Edye+TiO2 is the total energy of the dye–(TiO2)38 complex. Following the above expression, a positive value of Eads indicated a stable adsorption.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
The optimized geometries of A1, B1, and C1 in their ground-state configurations by B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) are shown in Fig. 3, and the selected bond length and dihedral angle parameters are listed in Table 1. The results show that the calculated Zn–N bond distances at the porphyrin core in all dyes were not significantly different. It should be noted that the addition of different π-conjugated molecules connected at the meso-position in porphyrin analogues slightly distorts the geometric structure of the porphyrin core; significant changes in geometrical parameters were found in dihedral angles (C4–C5–C25–C26). In order to extend the conjugation length of the π-spacer in A1, a benzene ring connected with a triple bond was introduced, as in B1. We found that the dihedral angles between the porphyrin and the π-spacer were calculated to be 69.67 and 69.06 degrees for A1 and B1 respectively, which were slightly changed. Interestingly, replacement of the connected substituent of the benzene ring by a thiophene unit in C1 distinctly increases the dihedral angles to 75.52 degrees and therefore the geometric structure of C1 was more twisted than that of A1 and B1; the twisted angles are illustrated in the side view of the ground-state optimized structure (Fig. 3). These findings imply that delocalization of the π-electron from the porphyrin core to an acceptor group in C1 cannot occur smoothly via the π-spacer linkage due to its twisted conformation and, therefore, if intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) should be decreased, the electron injection process could hardly occur. The more the conformation of the dyes was twisted, the lower the JSC that should be observed due to the JSC value being related to the rate of electron injection into the photo-electrode, the more planar structure of B1 showed a significantly higher JSC of 8.23 mA cm−2 than that of C1 (7.14 mA cm−2), see Table 2. We found that the thiophene substituents played a lesser role in promoting the efficiency of DSSCs. We can therefore predict that the B1 exhibits the best conversion efficiency, which is in excellent agreement with the best JSC value of 8.23 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 4.00% among our porphyrin dyes. Our results indicate that the different connected substituent groups at the meso-position of porphyrins directly affect the ground-state equilibrium structures, especially between the porphyrin macrocycle and the conjugated bridge.

3.2 NBO analysis and electronic structures
To gain insight into the steric effect of a dye molecule, we employed the concept of the natural bond orbital (NBO) by analysis of the electronic atomic charge via the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The calculated NBO atomic charges are shown in Fig. 4. However, as the charges of H atoms around the meso-position of A1 and B1 were similar, only B1 will be discussed and compared with C1. The calculated atomic charges of H atoms connected at C3 (HC3) and C7 (HC7) of the B1-porphyrin core were of the same value (+0.150). In addition, the hydrogen atoms of the benzene-π-spacer connected to the meso-phorphyrin position (HC26 and HC30) were calculated to be the same positive charge of +0.147. These hydrogen atoms are interacting with each other, HC3 to HC26 and HC7 to HC30, and this resulted in hydrogen repulsion; therefore, these hydrogen atoms try to avoid each other providing a twisted dihedral angle between the porphyrin core and the π-bridge of about −69.06 degrees. For C1, the atomic charges, HC26 and S29, in the substituted thiophene ring were calculated to be +0.152 and +0.293, respectively. Obviously, the C1, with a greater positive charge on H atoms around the meso-position, exerts two strongly repulsive forces between HC3 to HC26 and HC7 to S29. These mainly cause a more twisted dihedral angle of about 75.52 degrees. This discrepancy shows that the substitution of the thiophene ring at the meso-position of a porphyrin core in C1 can be a major cause of the largest dihedral angles between the porphyrin core and the π-bridge compared with A1 and B1. Our NBO analysis implies that the substitution of the benzene ring by a thiophene unit in our system will increase the steric hindrance, leading to a greater twist conformation from the repulsion of atomic charges, and will therefore resist charge transport from a porphyrin macrocycle and the meso-substituted linkages.

It is very useful to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) contributions of these analogues, as these can provide a reasonable qualitative indication of the charge-separated state of sensitizers. This can be rationalized by analysis of the electronic molecular orbital, where the HOMO must be primarily dominated by the HOMO of the donor, while the LUMO must be plentifully distributed on the acceptor moieties. The frontier molecular orbital plots of A1, B1, and C1 by B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) are shown in Fig. 5. In general, the HOMO possesses an antibonding character between the subunits, and the LUMO normally shows a bonding character between the subunits. There were delocalized π orbitals dominantly located on the porphyrin core in HOMO for all dyes. In LUMO, it was found that delocalization of electrons was mainly spread over the porphyrin core and partly spread over substituent linkages. Our calculations indicated that the ICT character took place only slightly. These results could be the main reason for our A1, B1 and C1 dyes to show relatively low power conversion efficiencies of 1.80, 4.00 and 3.24%, respectively, compared to the N3 reference-dye (7.87%), see Table 2. The ICT character improves the injection efficiency and thereby improves the photocurrents, which means that the JSC value is related to ICT character; our A1, B1 and C1 showed only small ICT character yielding small JSC values of 3.96, 8.23 and 7.14 mA cm−2, respectively, compared to N3 (15.92 mA cm−2). These results imply that it is possible to further improve the efficiency of energy conversion via tuning the photo-induced intramolecular-charge transfer ability of the meso-linked zinc porphyrin sensitizer; we designed a new dye-sensitizer by replacing the acetic acid moiety (in A1, B1 and C1) with cyanoacrylic acid, forming A2, B2 and C2 as shown in Fig. 6.

On adding the strong withdrawing group (CN), the density difference plot for the first lowest excitation (ρS1–ρS0) of A2, B2 and C2 exhibited a dramatically stronger ICT character compared to the dye without CN (A1, B1 and C1), see Fig. 7. Yellow and blue colours symbolize the decreased and increased electron contributions of the lowest energy excitation. Fig. 7 shows that adding electron-withdrawing groups increases the push–pull driving force. The electron contributions were pulled by the anchoring group, forming push–pull zinc porphyrins. Therefore, the withdrawing groups effectively enhanced charge separation and potentially increased the efficiency of electron injection and retarded charge recombination.

3.3 The molecular orbital energy
The HOMO–LUMO gaps of these analogues were computed using the B3LYP/ 6-31G(d,p) level of theory in both a vacuum and the CH2Cl2 solvent. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps and the molecular orbital diagram are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8, respectively. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of A1, B1, and C1 were 2.85, 2.82, and 2.84 eV, respectively. The results showed that extending the π-conjugated system by either adding ethylnylene–phenylene or ethylnylene–thiophene moieties can slightly decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap. The trend of the band gap was in the sequence B1 (2.82 eV) < C1 (2.84 eV) < A1 (2.85 eV), which was in close agreement with the experimental trend: B1 (1.97 eV) < C1 (1.98 eV) < A1 (2.04 eV). Furthermore, our calculated band gap corresponds to our experimental photon-to-current conversion efficiency32 of B1 (4.00%) > C1 (3.24%) > A1 (1.80%) referenced by N3 (7.87%), see Table 2. Distinctly, the smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps appeared to have a higher efficiency of the corresponding solar cell. This trend was supported by the theoretical prediction of Ma et al.45 which anticipated that the lower energy gap of ZnTPPG (2.194 eV) is very promising as a challenge to the best conversion efficiency record of 7.1% in 2010 of the ZnTMPPI (2.298 eV) without a co-sensitizer. The efficiencies of zinc-porphyrin sensitized solar cells have risen rapidly in the past few years; in 2011, the YD2-oC8 co-sensitized with an organic dye (Y123) showed the highest overall conversion efficiency of 12.3%.13 Therefore we have been attempting to determine the relationship between the molecular and electronic structures of porphyrin sensitizers and the performances of the porphyrin sensitizer. We found that our newly designed dyes (A2, B2 and C2) can effectively decrease the energy gap, see Fig. 8.

To study the abilities of injection of an electron into the conduction band (CB) of a metal oxide particle and the regeneration reaction of an electron to the excited dyes, the molecular orbital energies will be analyzed. Fig. 8 shows the molecular orbital energy diagram for A1, B1, C1, A2, B2 and C2 by DFT calculations. In our previous report,46 the HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO–LUMO gaps of (TiO2)38 in a stoichiometric anatase (101) surface using the PBE functional together with the DFT-semicore pseudopotentials (DSSPPS) were calculated to be −7.972, −3.523, and 4.449 eV, respectively, while the lowest transition was reduced to 3.75 eV, which was reasonably higher than typical band gaps of TiO2 nanoparticles.47–50 As mentioned above, for a high-efficiency sensitizer of DSCs, the LUMO energies of dyes must be placed slightly above the conduction band of TiO2 and the HOMO energies of dyes must be properly located under the redox couple of the I−/I3− electrolyte. From the results, it was found that the HOMO energies of all analogues were located lower than the redox couple of I−/I3−, and LUMO laid above the CB of TiO2 as expected; the energy gaps of all dyes were computed to be 2.82, 2.80 and 2.81 for A1, B1 and C1, respectively, and were significantly lowered to 2.52, 2.35 and 2.41 for A2, B2 and C2, respectively. These can be described as the addition of a strong withdrawing group efficiently improves the conjugated system in a dye sensitizer. Therefore, we successfully designed a new dye with a strong withdrawing group (A2, B2 and C2) to potentially serve as a highly efficient porphyrin-dye sensitized solar cell, especially the B2, which exhibited the lowest energy gap of 2.35 eV.
3.4 Excitation energies and UV/Vis absorption spectra
In order to understand the electronic transition, TDDFT calculations on excitation energies and UV/Vis absorption spectra for all dyes were performed. The 20 lowest singlet–singlet transitions, up to an energy of ∼4.96 eV (250 nm), were investigated with the B3LYP functional. To obtain more reliability, various basis sets such as 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-311+G(d,p) have been tested. The appropriate basis set was identified by predicted absorption spectra of all dyes from their ground-state optimized structures in the CH2Cl2 solvent. The absorption spectra on several basis sets of A1, B1 and C1 are depicted in Fig. S1.† As shown in Fig. S1,† it was found that the predicted absorption spectra by the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set for all analogues were red-shifted compared with 6-31+G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-31G(d,p), respectively, which was closest to the experimental observation. In order that the detailed electronic microscopic information could be analyzed, only a 6-311+G(d,p) basis set was used. The calculated excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and electronic configuration for all dyes using the TD-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory are collated in Table 3.

The excitation energies and absorption spectra of these analogues have been analyzed and interpreted by considering Gouterman's four-orbital model,51 which is the intrinsic character of a porphyrin base. This model involves the transitions of HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO−1 orbitals, which cause the intense B- and weak Q-bands. From Table 3, it was found that the electronic excitation from HOMO to LUMO for all analogues can be considered as a mixed transition between charge transfer (CT) and π–π* transitions.
For analogues 1 (A1, B1 and C1), the B-band appeared at ∼400 nm while the Q-band appeared at ∼560 nm. These results reveal that adding different substituent groups at the meso-position of the porphyrin core (analogues 1) does not change configuration in electronic transition; the absorption maxima were not significantly shifted, see Fig. 9 (down). Furthermore, on adding a strong withdrawing group into analogues 2, the B-bands were red shifted, which appeared at 412, 439 and 466 nm for A2, B2 and C2, respectively, while the Q-band appears at ∼600 nm, see Fig. 9 (up). These results indicate that introducing electron-withdrawing groups into the acceptor part of porphyrin dyes can fine-tune the effective conjugation length of the π-spacer and give rise to light harvesting efficiency.

3.5 Adsorption of dyes on the (TiO2)38 cluster
It is well known that the absorption spectrum of free dyes can be affected when adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface due to the interaction between the dyes and the TiO2. This interaction determines the electron injection efficiency in which the photo-excited electrons transfer from the dyes into the CB of TiO2. To reveal the electronic structure involved in the dye/semiconductor charge transfer process between the dyes and the TiO2 surface upon photoexcitation, we simulated the A1 (with acetic acid as an acceptor) and A2 (with cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor) adsorbed on (TiO2)38 surfaces representing the complex structure of the dye (TiO2)38 to compare the effect of different electron acceptor groups on the adsorption properties of the designed dyes. These two dyes share the same Zn-porphyrin and number of benzene units in the π-spacer but have different anchoring groups. The optimized structures of the dye (TiO2)38 using DMol3 are illustrated in Fig. 10.

It is commonly known that the more favourable grafting configuration of the cyanoacrylic/acetic acid onto the TiO2 surface is bidentate chemisorption.52–54 So we only modelled the bidentate grafting adsorption mode of A1 and A2 dyes onto the TiO2 surface. Two Ti–O bonds from both A1 and A2 grafted onto (TiO2)38 clusters were found to be in the range of 2.05–2.17 Å. The dihedral angle between the porphyrin ring and the benzene ring (T1) of A1 was calculated to be 75.20 degrees; on adding the CN group into A2 this T1 was decreased to 63.13 degrees, resulting in stronger ICT and a potentially more efficient electron injection process on the TiO2 surface in the A2 dye. Consequently, the calculated adsorption energy (Eads) of the A2–(TiO2)38 complex was computed to be 20.71 kcal mol−1 performing stronger interactions than that of 16.60 kcal mol−1 for A1–(TiO2)38, see Table 4. Furthermore, in order to investigate the mechanism of electron injection from dyes into the TiO2 surface we used the DFT/TD-DFT calculations as implemented in the Gaussian09 program. The excitation energies and the electronic transitions are summarized in Table 5, and the frontier molecular orbitals of excited-state structures of dye–(TiO2)38 for A1 and A2 are shown in Fig. 10. We found two main transitions for the A1 dye; the highest oscillator strength of 0.0425 was a linear combination of 0.43(H−1 → L+62)–0.49(H → L+58), and the oscillator strength of 0.0104 was a linear combination of 0.51(H → L+58) + 0.43(H−1 → L+58); both transitions have been assigned to π–π* transition of a porphyrin ring. The HOMO−1 and HOMO levels for A1 showed the electron density located on the π-bond of the porphyrin core, whereas the LOMO+62 and LUMO+58 levels for A1 showed the electron density mainly located on π anti-bonding of the porphyrin core. The electron injection process from A1 to the (TiO2)38 surface was rarely observed, see Fig. 11a. On the other hand, the electron injection process was detected in the A2–(TiO2)38 complex which was the 0.39(H → L+3) transition shown in Fig. 11b. These results strongly indicate that the strong withdrawing group in the acceptor part of an A2-porphyrin dye plays a crucial role in improving the intramolecular charge transfer properties and induces an electron injection process from the anchoring group of a porphyrin dye to the (TiO2)38 surface, which may improve the photocurrent as well as the conversion efficiency of the DSCs.

4. Conclusion
We have designed our new dyes based on porphyrins ZnTCPP with typical porphyrin moieties as donors and the carboxyl-containing groups as acceptors (A1, B1 and C1) to study the effect of different meso-substituted linkages. We found that our dyes, especially C1 with a thiophene linker, exhibited twisted conformation between the porphyrin macrocycle and meso-substituted linkages, which resulted in blocking of the conjugation of the conjugated backbone. These results confirmed, by a frontier molecular orbital plot, our calculations, indicating that the charge-separated states take place slightly. To improve the photo-induced intramolecular-charge transfer ability of the meso-linked zinc porphyrin sensitizer, which is a challenging problem for processing effectively injected electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 in the DSC devices, a strong withdrawing group (CN) was introduced. The density difference plot for the first lowest excitation (ρS1–ρS0) of A2, B2 and C2 exhibited dramatically improved ICT properties. In addition, calculated excitation energies and UV/Vis absorption spectra were carried out by the TDDFT method; we found that on adding different substituent groups at the meso-position of the porphyrin core (analogues 1), the absorption maxima were not significantly shifted whereas on adding strongly withdrawing groups in analogues 2, the B-bands were significantly red shifted which appeared at 412, 439 and 466 nm for A2, B2 and C2. These results indicate that introducing electron-withdrawing groups to the acceptor part of porphyrin dyes can fine-tune the effective conjugation length of π-spacer and give rise to efficient conversion of light to electricity. Moreover, the adsorption of these dyes on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface and the electron injection mechanism were also investigated. The adsorption energies (Eads) of A1 and A2 were calculated to be 16.60 and 20.71 kcal mol−1, respectively, indicating the significantly stronger electronic coupling strengths of the anchoring group of A2 and the TiO2 surface. The electron injection process from A1 to the (TiO2)38 surface was rarely observed while a direct charge-transfer transition in the A2-(TiO2)38 interacting system was detected as a transition from HOMO to LOMO+3. These results strongly indicated that A2 with a strongly withdrawing group in the acceptor part of a porphyrin dye plays a crucial role in improving the intramolecular charge transfer properties and induced an electron injection process from the anchoring group of a porphyrin dye to the (TiO2)38 surface, which may improve the photocurrent as well as the conversion efficiency of the DSCs. The successful study of these theoretical calculations may be seen as the first attempt to tune the molecular orbital energy levels and improve the light absorption properties in a screening step, providing newly designed effective sensitizers for further experimental synthesis.
