    , Accepted 13th March 2018First published on 15th March 2018AbstractBandgap-tunable alloyed CdS0.12Se0.88 quantum dot (QD) sensitizers on a TiO2 photoanode with a ZnSe/ZnS passivation layer (denoted as CSS(ZSS)) were successfully synthesized for the first time by a facile one-pot successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process from a cationic solution containing Zn2+ and Cd2+, and an anionic solution containing Se2− and S2−. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 6.14% (Jsc = 20.4 mA cm−2, Voc = 578 mV, FF = 0.52) was achieved, which is almost double the efficiency of 3.40% for the quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) without Zn2+ feeding in the cationic solution. The results indicated that the light absorbance enhancement as well as the optical bandgap variation (from 2.13 eV to 1.89 eV) effectively promoted the light harvesting, leading to an increased photocurrent density. A careful control of the molar ratio of Zn/Cd by the SILAR cycles played a vital role in determining Jsc and Voc, and the possible explanation and mechanisms are discussed. The charge recombination at the interface between the QDs and electrolyte was also elaborated.
Introduction
In recent years, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have emerged as a promising low cost candidate for third-generation solar cells compared with silicon based solar cells.1 The advantages of QDSCs are also demonstrated in the architectures and properties of QD sensitizers with tunable band gap, large intrinsic dipole moment, high molar absorption coefficient, and solution processability.2 Meanwhile, the unique properties of hot electron extraction and multiple exciton generation (MEG) are perceived to boost the PCE beyond the traditional Shockley and Queisser limit (31%).3 QD sensitizers play a key role in the light-harvesting capability and their light absorption range is related to the type of QDs. To date, a variety of QDs have been explored for light harvesting, including CdS,4 CdSe,5 PbS,6 CdTe,7 Ag2S,8 CdSxSe1−x,9 CdSexTe1−x,10 CuInS2,11 and Zn–Cu–In–Se.12 Among all these QDs, the CdS/CdSe co-sensitization system has been extensively studied due to its wide light absorption range in the visible-light region, superior electron transfer properties and easy synthesis.13–15 Recently, Huang et al. reported a high efficiency of 6.4% based on CdS/CdSe QDs with a ZnSe passivation layer to inhibit interfacial charge recombination and enhance light harvesting.16
The assembly of CdS or CdSe QDs on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) film is usually achieved by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), chemical bath deposition (CBD), electrophoresis, electrochemical deposition and linker-assisted binding techniques.17 Zhong's group fabricated an inverted type-I CdS/CdSe core/shell structure via the linker-assisted binding method, and the corresponding QDSCs exhibited a record PCE value of 5.32% (Voc = 0.527 V, Jsc = 18.02 mA cm−2, FF = 0.56) with an active cell area of 0.237 cm2.18 Although a series of record PCEs have been achieved by this technique, which could be attributed to the advantage of a precise controllable shape, the inferior contact between the QDs and TiO2 limits further development of QDSCs.11,19 SILAR and CBD methods have gained popularity owing to their advantages of effective and high coverage of QDs on the mesoporous substrate surfaces that benefit from their nucleation and growth mechanism. Recently, a PCE over 6% for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells was obtained; in the fabrication process, the MOS film was sensitized with CdS QDs using SILAR and CdSe QDs by the CBD method, respectively.16,20,21
As a convenient and effective way for the SILAR process, the mesoporous film is dipped into the respective precursor solution including the cation and anion alternately, and QDs are subsequently deposited and controlled by limiting the number of SILAR cycles. Hossain et al.22 employed the SILAR technique to facilely prepare CdSxSe1−x QDs by alternately depositing CdS and CdSe layers onto mesoscopic TiO2 electrodes and achieved a PCE of 4.05%. They found that the band gap of the CdSe-based light absorber can be facilely tuned by changing the deposition mode which results in varied compositions. Zhou et al.23 reported a PCE of 3.58% for the tunable band gap (1.95 eV to 2.30 eV) CdSxSe1−x QD sensitized TiO2 solar cells by the SILAR method. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the engineered CdSxSe1−x interlayer incorporated into the CdS/CdSe co-sensitization system can facilitate charge injection and impair the interfacial defects for suppressed charge recombination, and result in a superior PCE of 5.06%. Although the whole SILAR process is simplistic, there is a serious interfacial charge recombination due to more defects on the QD surface under the low temperature processing conditions, and thus the PCE of QDSCs achieved by the whole SILAR technique still lags behind 5%.22,24
It is well known that ZnS is the most studied material for covering the bare TiO2 as well as QDs by the SILAR method, leading to strong suppression of the electron leakage from either TiO2 or QDs to the electrolyte, and thus increase in the power conversion efficiency of the resulting QDSCs.25 Recently, ZnSe has been demonstrated to be a good alternative to ZnS as a passivation material, in which the ZnSe passivation layer deposited on CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells generated a PCE of 6.4%, much higher than the 4.9% of ZnS passivated QDSCs because of reduced surface charge recombination and also enhanced light harvesting.26 Liu et al.27 reported that introduction of a ZnSe layer between CdSe and ZnS can significantly increase the photocurrent of CdSe QDSCs, resulting in a 22% increment in PCE compared to that with ZnS treatment. They argued that ZnSe could inhibit defects at CdSe/ZnS interfaces and facilitate the growth of ZnS with higher quality due to the reduction in the lattice mismatch between CdSe and ZnS. Additionally, considerable attention has been devoted to the possibility of fabricating ZnSxSe1−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloy, which permits modulation of the absorption edge over the range of 340–460 nm.28 Yoon et al.29 demonstrated that the formation of the CdZnSSe intermediate layers contributes to the higher photoelectrochemical cell performance of the ZnO–CdSSe nanocables.
The present study has designed and fabricated CSS(ZSS) QDs with the chemical composition of CdS0.12Se0.88 QDs and ZnSe/ZnS passivation layers deposited on mesoscopic TiO2 film using a facile one-pot SILAR route. The bandgap of the CSS(ZSS) QDs is tuned from 2.13 to 1.89 eV by controlling the SILAR cycle numbers. With increasing SILAR cycles, parts of as prepared ZnS and ZnSe would transform to CdS and CdSe, and facilitate the formation of more CdS0.12Se0.88 in the SILAR process, which was helpful to increase the light capture and enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, the fewer ZnSe/ZnS passivation layers on QDs with more number of SILAR cycles may accelerate the charge recombination rate between the QDs and electrolyte, which leads to a decrease of the open circuit voltage (Voc). When both ratios of Cd2+/Zn2+ and Se2−/S2− are 0.3 with twelve SILAR cycles, the champion QDSCs based on the CSS(ZSS) QD sensitizer exhibited a PCE of 6.14% under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Experimental
Chemicals
Titanium oxide (TiO2, Degussa, P25), α-terpineol (C10H8O, 96%, Sigma Aldrich), ethyl cellulose ([C6H7O2(OC2H5)3]n, 48.0–49.5% (w/w) as ethoxyl, Sigma Aldrich), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.99%, Aladdin), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98.0%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 98.0%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, AR, 98.0%), selenium powder (Se, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and sulfur (S, Reagent grade, Sigma Aldrich) were all directly used without further purification.
SILAR for the growth of CSS(ZSS) QDs on TiO2 films
The preparation of mesoporous TiO2 films is available in the previous work.16 A mesoscopic TiO2 film was prepared on FTO glass by the doctor-blade method with TiO2 paste, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. As shown in Fig. S1a and b,† the TiO2 film has a vesicular structure with a thickness of ∼17 μm. The CSS(ZSS) QDs were deposited on the TiO2 film through a SILAR procedure as illustrated in Fig. S1c.† In brief, the TiO2 film was first dipped into the cationic solution with dissolution of Zn(CH3COO)2 and Cd(CH3COO)2 in DI water, and then rinsed with methanol after 1 min. Subsequently, the film was immersed into the anionic solution with dissolution of NaBH4, Na2S·9H2O and Se powder in methanol and DI water (v/v = 1:1), then rinsed with methanol after 1 min; this procedure formed one SILAR cycle. When a sample underwent n cycles of SILAR, it was marked as nc and the color changed with different SILAR cycles as shown in Fig. S1d.†
Fabrication of solar cells
A solar cell device was assembled by sandwiching the QD sensitized photoanode and counter electrode employing a scotch tape and allowing the polysulfide electrolyte to permeate the assembly. The polysulfide electrolyte in the present study composed of 1 M S and 1 M Na2S in DI water. The Cu2S counter electrode was fabricated by etching with HCl solution (mass fraction = 36.5–38.0%) at 75 °C for 1 h, rinsing it with DI water, drying in air, then immersing it in fresh electrolyte for ca. 5 min, resulting in the formation of nanostructured Cu2S film on brass foil. The active area was fixed at 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, A SU8020) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20) were used to obtain the morphologies and microstructures of the samples. The compositional energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis and elemental mapping were performed on an EDX integrated with SEM (SU8020). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer from Thermo Scientific. The light absorption properties were investigated by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H). The photovoltaic properties (J–V curves) of the QDSCs were measured (Keithley 2400 source meter) under simulated AM 1.5 G solar sunlight (7IS0503A, equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp). Intensity-modulated photo-voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photo-current spectroscopy (IMPS) were performed on an Autolab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT302N) under modulated blue light emitting diodes (LED 470 nm). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was performed using the same electrochemical workstation in the dark at an applied bias ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 V with the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.
Results and discussion
A facile one-step strategy was carried out for the deposition of the CdS0.12Se0.88 QDs with the ZnSe/ZnS passivation layer (CSS(ZSS)) on TiO2 film by using the SILAR method. In our case, the proportion of Cd2+ in the cationic solution ranges from 0.1 to 1, and the proportion of Se2− in the anionic solution is also from 0.1 to 1. A series of experiments have been done to explore the optimal molar ratio of Cd2+/Zn2+ and Se2−/S2−. With the introduction of Zn2+ in the cationic solution, the PCE of the resultant CSS(ZSS) solar cells has been greatly enhanced. The champion power conversion efficiency (6.14%) determined from the J–V measurements was obtained in the CSS(ZSS) solar cells with a feed ratio of Cd2+/Zn2+ = Se2−/S2− = 0.3 in the precursor solution, which is much higher than the PCE of 3.40% in CSS(ZSS) solar cells with other feed ratios under otherwise the same experimental conditions (Tables S1–S3†). Thereafter, cells with the feed molar ratio of Cd2+/Zn2+ = Se2−/S2− = 0.3 were investigated as a model system by means of SEM, XRD, TEM, XPS, UV-Vis, EIS, IMPS and IMVS characterization.
The actual molar ratio of Cd, Zn, S and Se for CSS(ZSS) QDs adsorbed on TiO2 film was examined by EDX analysis. The corresponding EDX spectra with elemental maps for the cross-section of samples 6C and 12C are presented in Fig. 1a–d. As shown in Fig. 1a and c, EDX spectra of the cross-section of samples 6C and 12C exhibited the typical peaks corresponding to Cd, Zn, Se and S, respectively. It can be found that the actual molar ratio of S/Se was equal to about 0.13 for samples 6C and 12C, suggesting that a higher number of SILAR cycles would have no influence on the ratio of Se/S. However, the molar ratio of Zn/Cd was found to be substantially decreased from 0.29 to 0.17 which could be attributed to the increased amount of Cd. A deviation between the feed Se/S, Zn/Cd ratio in the precursor solutions and the actual Se/S, Zn/Cd ratio in the as-prepared QDs was observed, which revealed different solubilities of these ions during the SILAR deposition process. The corresponding EDX elemental mapping images reveal that the elements Zn, Cd, S and Se were distributed homogeneously throughout the mesoporous TiO2 films (Fig. 1b and d).

The XRD patterns of CSS(ZSS) QD sensitized TiO2 films with different SILAR cycles (6C–14C) are depicted in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of TiO2 films on FTO (0C) is also included for comparison. All the XRD peaks of the TiO2 films on FTO are related to those of rutile and anatase Degussa P25 and SnO2 phases of the FTO substrate. We noticed that the diffraction peaks of the CSS(ZSS) QDs sensitized TiO2 films with different SILAR cycles are fairly close to the bare TiO2 (P25)/FTO. However, a set of broad diffraction peaks at about 42.7° can be observed for the samples of 8C–14C, the peak position is consistent with that of the (110) peak of hexagonal CdS0.33Se0.67 (JCPDS no. 50-0721) as shown in Fig. 2. It implies that the composition of the solid solution between CdS and CdSe is obtained by using a fixed precursor concentration during SILAR deposition. It is well known that CdS and CdSe are miscible over a wide range of compositions due to the small lattice mismatch, which leads to the formation of CdSxSe1−x solid solution. In addition, as the solubility product of CdSe (CdSe, Ksp = 6 × 10−36 (ref. 30)) is far lower than that of CdS, ZnS, and ZnSe (CdS, Ksp = 8 × 10−27 (ref. 31); ZnS, Ksp = 8 × 10−23 (ref. 32); ZnSe, Ksp = 3 × 10−26 (ref. 30)), parts of the as-obtained CdS, ZnS and ZnSe would be transformed to CdSe QDs during the SILAR process.30,33 From the EDX elemental analysis, the calculated formula of the solid solution was found to be CdS0.12Se0.88 in terms of the fixed atomic ratio S/Se = 0.13 for the samples (6C–14C). The obtained chemical composition of CSS(ZSS) QDs is consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of the composition of CdS0.12Se0.88 and ZnSe/ZnS passivation layers. Moreover, the relative intensities of diffraction peaks of the resulting CdS0.12Se0.88 become stronger with increasing number of SILAR cycles, therefore it is easy to understand that larger amounts of QDs deposited on the TiO2 film would result in good crystallinity. As displayed in the HRTEM image (Fig. S2†), the interlayer spacing of QDs also matches well with the hexagonal phase of the obtained CdS0.12Se0.88, and the 12C sample with the darkness profile shows a clear accumulation of QDs, indicating that a large quantity of QDs was deposited on the TiO2 film.30,31 It is also necessary to point out that no peaks of any phases or impurities related to ZnSe/ZnS were detected, which might be due to the low amount of ZnSe/ZnS in the as-prepared sample.

XPS measurements were employed to study the superficial elemental composition and chemical states of the CSS(ZSS) QD sensitized TiO2 films with different SILAR cycles (6C–14C). The spectra were calibrated using a reference C (1s) peak at 284.8 eV. As expected, the Cd, Zn, Se and S elements were detected for 6C–14C samples according to the wide scan XPS survey spectra in Fig. 3a. To further determine the valence states of the elements and the chemical composition of the QDs deposited via different SILAR cycles, the Cd, Se and S regions of the high-resolution spectra for the 12C sample are shown in Fig. 3b–e, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 4b, Se 3d peaks can be fitted into four peaks; two strong peaks at 53.5 and 54.6 eV corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 binding energy for Cd–Se bonding, respectively, while 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks at 53.8 and 55.2 eV belong to Zn–Se bonding.32,33 In Fig. 3c, the spin–orbit doublet of S2p level splits into 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with binding energy of 160.1 and 161.5 eV, respectively; it indicates the presence of Cd–S and Zn–S bonding.34,35 A similar situation can be observed in the case of the Cd3d spectrum (Fig. 3d), which exhibits a spin–orbit doublet structure corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 signals with binding energy 404.9 and 411.7 eV, respectively, indicating the presence of Cd2+ species in the CSS(ZSS) QDs.35 As shown in Fig. 3e, it can be observed that in the case of Zn (2p) peaks, the binding energy (1021.6 eV, 1044.7 eV) corresponds to the values reported mainly for divalent zinc in sulfide and selenide.35,36

The molar ratios of Cd/Zn with different number of SILAR cycles were also determined by means of XPS as shown in Fig. 3f. Clearly, a gradual decrease in the atomic ratios of Zn/Cd was observed as the number of SILAR cycles increased from 6C to 12C. The increased amount of Cd is responsible for the decrease of Zn/Cd atom ratios, this result is in accordance with the EDX data. A further increase in SILAR cycles would result in a slight increase of Zn/Cd due to the depletion of Cd in the cationic solution.

Fig. 4a is the optical UV-visible light absorption spectra of TiO2 films before and after one and six SILAR cycles. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 4a, the absorption onset of TiO2 is determined to be around 380 nm, corresponding to the typical absorption of TiO2,37 while it exhibited broad absorption beyond about 600 nm in the visible light region after one SILAR cycle. The band gap of the QDs was estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the (Ahν)2versus hν plots, according to eqn (1):38 (Ahv)2 = c(hv − Eg)(1)where A is the absorbance, c is a constant, ν is the frequency and h is Plank's constant. CdSe QDs deposited at the first SILAR cycle have an Eg of ∼2.13 eV, much larger than the Eg (1.75 eV) of bulk CdSe because of the quantum confinement effect. Compared with the TiO2 film after the first SILAR cycle, the light absorption of the film with six cycles shows great enhancement in absorbance and a significant red-shift in the absorption edge. Increased number of SILAR cycles resulted in increased amounts of QD loading on the TiO2 mesoporous film, resulting in stronger absorption intensity.37 In addition, increased number of SILAR cycles resulted in the growth of QDs, leading to the red-shift as the bandgap reduces with increased size of QDs.22,30 Another possible explanation for such red-shift absorption is an exciton leakage from the core into the shell materials, which is similar to the effect that was observed in CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS core–shell–shell QDs.39,40

Fig. 4b shows the absorption spectra of TiO2 films deposited with CSS(ZSS) QDs with 6 to 14 SILAR cycles over the wavelength ranging from 350 to 800 nm. Obviously, the absorption shows a strong dependence on the number of SILAR cycles. As seen in Fig. 4b, the sensitized photoanodes show an increase in absorbance and a noticeable red-shift in absorption range with increase in the number of SILAR cycles, which was also confirmed by the color change of photographs in the inset. According to the literature, the ZnS or ZnSe layer on TiO2 mesoporous film appears to favor the deposition of CdS QDs,41,42 and in turn promotes the growth of CdSe QDs and increases the deposition amount of CdS0.12Se0.88 QDs, which leads to a higher light absorbance. It can be seen from the literature that CdSexS(1−x) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) could feasibly vary its band gap between the bulk CdSe (1.75 eV) and CdS (2.5 eV) by changing the composition.9,43 The S/Se atomic ratio is fixed at about 0.13 in our case as declared by EDX results. As shown in Fig. 4c, the estimated band gap values of CSS(ZSS) QD samples with different number of SILAR cycles from 6C to 14C are 2.06 eV, 2.00 eV, 1.95 eV, 1.93 eV and 1.89 eV, respectively. This red shift with the number of SILAR cycles can be rationalized in terms of the reduction of the quantum confinement and exciton leakage mentioned above. The increased absorption near the bandgap with a smaller absorption coefficient for the thicker deposits may also contribute to the red shift.30 However, there is no change in absorbance in the range from 400 to 600 nm from 12C to 14C; it seems to result from the depletion of Cd in the cationic solution or the saturation of the surface adsorption site for TiO2.

Fig. 5d displays the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) curves of the QD sensitized photoanodes; the value of LHE is estimated by the equation:44 LHE = 1 − 10−absorbance(2)
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves and (b) changing trend of photovoltaic characteristics of QDSCs based on CSS(ZSS) QDs with different SILAR cycles. 
Apparently, the variation of LHE is consistent with the trend of the light absorption of the QD sensitized photoanode with different SILAR cycles. As shown in Fig. 4d, the LHE increases with the increase of SILAR cycles, and the photoanode with 14 SILAR cycles has the highest LHE.

Fig. 5a depicts the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of QDSCs based on CSS(ZSS) QDs with different SILAR cycles obtained under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding average performance parameters were recorded with six cells in parallel and are summarized in Table 1. Sample 12C based QDSC exhibited the best performance with a Voc of 578 mV, Jsc of 20.4 mAcm−2, and FF of 0.52, yielding a PCE of 6.14%, which is much higher than the PCE of 4.63% for the 6C based QDSC. The changing trend of Voc, Jsc, FF and η is demonstrated in Fig. 5b. A significant increase in Jsc can be seen for increasing number of SILAR cycles, which is fully consistent with the absorption spectra in Fig. 4b. Such an incremental LHE (Fig. 4d) leads to more excited electrons under the same illumination, which predominantly contributes to the photocurrent. However, there is a decline in the solar cell performance resulting from the decreased Voc with a further increase of the CSS(ZSS) QD deposition cycles. The drop in Voc with increase in SILAR cycles as shown in Fig. 5b can be reasonably explained by increased charge recombination, which will be discussed in detail below.

The effect of the number of SILAR cycles on the dynamic process in electron transport and recombination of QDSCs is investigated by IMPS and IMVS.45,46 In Fig. 6a and b the electron transport time (τd) and the electron lifetime (τn) are plotted against the incident light intensity for samples 6C–14C. These two parameters can be calculated by the equation: τd = 1/(2πfIMPS)(3) τn = 1/(2πfIMVS)(4)in which fIMPS and fIMVS are the characteristic minimum frequency of IMPS and IMVS imaginary components, respectively. In Fig. 7a, τd decreased from samples 6C to 14C, suggesting that the electron transport rate increased with the increasing SILAR cycles. The faster electron transport can reflect higher photo-generated electron concentration because of the enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency, bringing about the increase of Jsc, which is in line with J–V results.5,15

The electron lifetime derived from IMVS reflects the charge recombination processes in QDSCs. As shown in Fig. 6b, τn decreased with increasing light intensity and SILAR cycles, which implied that the probability of larger recombination was because of the presence of more electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor leading to lower Voc and FF according to Shen et al.46
In order to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the decrease of Voc, EIS characterization was performed in the dark. The Nyquist curves for all cells under different biases are available in Fig. S3.† The corresponding parameters were extracted with a standard simulation circuit for QDSCs. The dependence of the extracted Cμ and Rct on various forward biases is presented in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. It has been well established that the chemical capacitance Cμ stands for the dependence of electron density on the Fermi level and monitors the distribution of trap states in the band gap of the TiO2 matrix.45,47 The recombination resistance Rct is a measure of the charge recombination rate occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces.12 As shown in Fig. 7a, the nearly identical Cμ values for all cells indicate that different SILAR cycles have no obvious influence on the conduction band edge of the TiO2 matrix, which is consistent with the results in previous reports.11 In contrast, a considerable variety of Rct values at different biases were observed in all cells (Fig. 7b), the Rct values become smaller with increase in the number of SILAR cycles in the whole applied forward bias range. It is well known that Rct is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, a smaller Rct value means increased charge recombination rate with increasing number of SILAR cycles in TiO2/CSS(ZSS) cells. For clarity, Fig. 7c presents a direct comparison of Nyquist plots for samples 6C–14C based QDSCs at a forward bias of −0.6 V (which is close to the Voc values of the cells) and the extracted EIS parameters are listed in Table 2. The electron lifetimes 48 calculated by EIS showed the same order as the IMVS outcomes compared with the lifetime obtained from IMVS (Fig. 6b). It can be found that the sample 14C shows notably the lowest Rct and shortest electron lifetime in comparison with other samples, indicating a much faster recombination rate in QDSCs.49

On the basis of the above results, the mechanism of decrease of Voc arising from the severe charge recombination with increase in the number of SILAR cycle is illustrated in Scheme 1. For a low number of SILAR cycles, the ZnSe/ZnS passivation layer covers the TiO2 and QD surface, and thus inhibits the recombination of TiO2–electrolyte and QDs–electrolyte. This could explain the larger Rct (Fig. 7c) for the sample 6C, leading to a higher Voc (Fig. 5). As stated before, as the TiO2 surface is being covered with increasing number of SILAR cycles, the recombination process changes from a preferential recombination with the electrolyte to a preferential recombination with the QDs.30 When the SILAR cycles increase, there would likely be less ZnSe/ZnS coverage due to partial depletion of sulfur ions in the precursors. Consequently, interface charge recombination between CSS(ZSS) QDs and the electrolyte would take place, resulting in decreased electron lifetime and reduced Voc, as suggested in the literature.50

Conclusions
A facile one-pot strategy is demonstrated to synthesize CdS0.12Se0.88 QDs with a ZnSe/ZnS passivation layer (CSS(ZSS)) on TiO2 mesoporous films through the precise control of the feed ratio of Cd/Zn and Se/S in a SILAR process. Solar cells based on such CSS(ZSS) QDs with twelve SILAR cycles yielded an impressive power conversion efficiency of 6.14%. The significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance of the QDSCs could be attributed to the high Jsc, arising from the particularly strong absorption and prominent red shift of the absorption edge. Due to the depletion of sulfur ions in the precursor solution, the small Rct suggests fast charge recombination at the interface between the QDs and electrolyte when the number of SILAR deposition exceeded 6 cycles.
