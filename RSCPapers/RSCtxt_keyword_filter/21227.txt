    , Accepted 12th June 2015First published on 22nd June 2015AbstractWe have synthesized a series of conjugated D–π–A copolymers, PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD, based on a (5-hexyltridecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (ttTPD) acceptor unit in order to develop better photovoltaic polymers based on the TPD moiety: an ε-branched alkyl side chain on the TPD unit was coupled with 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (tt) π-bridge molecules. The Stille polymerization of the brominated ttTPD and stannylated simple thiophene (T) finally gave a promising PT-ttTPD polymer showing well-ordered inter-chain orientation in the BHJ active layer. PT-ttTPD-based OPVs exhibited a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.21% (VOC = 0.86 V, JSC = 15.30 mA cm−2, FF = 70%).

Broader context
Much effort has been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic cells as next generation energy resources. Rational molecular design and synthesis of conjugated polymers based on a deep understanding of the relationship between chemical structures and photophysical properties are crucial for developing high performance OPVs. One of the effective approaches to develop efficient conjugated polymers is to strengthen the intermolecular interaction between conjugated polymer chains by enhancing their molecular orbital overlap. For this purpose, we have modified the donor moiety in the D–π–A system in an attempt to develop higher performing polymers, and controlled the size and shape of the alkyl side chain on TPD to help balance solubility and chain packing in the polymers. We synthesized polymers containing simple thiophene or bithiophene moieties instead of BDT as a donor. This produces a synergistic effect with the ttTPD unit, so that the polymers exhibit broad absorption, a low-lying HOMO energy level, and well-ordered inter-chain orientation in a blend film with PCBM. The best OPV device shows a promising PCE of 9.21%.

For the past three decades, much effort has gone into attempting to optimize the performance of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) via systematic design of promising photovoltaic materials. As a result, significant improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of such solar cells have been achieved and PCEs of up to 10.6% have been reported using conventional, single-layer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs.1,2a The manufacturing of OPVs involves low cost and less energy than those of inorganic-based PV devices, which means that OPVs should achieve energy payback much sooner than the existing technologies do, which would increase dramatically if their current modest efficiency and lifetime can be improved.3 Recent analyses suggest that reduction in manufacturing costs offers the best way to significantly enhance the use of renewable energies such as wind or solar power,4 so the improvement of OPV efficiencies may have a significant role in fighting climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels. Most polymers for high efficiency devices satisfy three criteria: (i) well-matched energy level offsets between the polymer and the acceptor (most commonly a fullerene such as PC71BM) to ensure suitable charge separation, while maintaining a high open-circuit voltage (VOC); (ii) appropriate solubility and miscibility in order to achieve an optimal active layer nanostructure; (iii) a small optical band gap, broad absorption spectra, and high extinction coefficient to facilitate solar photon harvesting for a thin active layer,2 and possession of a structure composed of alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties, thus having an internal donor–acceptor structure. In an attempt to construct superior molecular structures, we recently reported a D–π–A system, consisting of 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (tt) π-bridge molecules between D and A backbones, which improved the absorption coefficient, hole mobility, and crystallinity of the resulting conjugated polymers.5 As an electron accepting building block (A), the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-(5H)-dione (TPD) moiety was selected because TPD has electron accepting capabilities and a quinoidal structure is a major resonance contributor to the structure, especially in the excited state.6 This quinoid contribution effectively lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymer which produces a higher VOC in OPV devices. Also, owing to its symmetric coplanar structure, the TPD unit can enhance inter-chain interactions, which leads to a higher charge carrier mobility and more efficient charge transport in the resulting materials and potentially a higher short-circuit current density (JSC). Thus, we designed and made a D–π–A conjugated polymer, which contained the tt π-bridge and the TPD (ttTPD, π–A) building block, which showed a high PCE of 6.81%.5
In this communication, we have modified the D moiety in the D–π–A system in an attempt to develop higher performing polymers, and controlled the size and shape of the alkyl side chain on TPD to help balance solubility and chain packing in the polymers. The use of a simple thiophene (T) moiety instead of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) produces a synergistic effect with the ttTPD unit. As a classical organic semiconducting unit, BDT has garnered attention due to its stability against oxidation and its planar molecular framework,7 but yields limited JSC due to medium band gap.8 Therefore, a new approach utilizing a simple T derivative was recently reported.2a,9 Notably, T derivatives exhibit a red-shifted absorption, as well as strong inter chain interaction and enhanced hole mobility as compared to BDT,9 primarily owing to their planar molecular conformation, which reduces the conformational disorder of the backbone and increases the molecular rigidity of the polymer in the solid state, thus facilitating electron delocalization. In particular, the introduction of ε-branched alkyl side chains onto the TPD units could improve better solubility, a higher hole mobility, and JSC in the corresponding polymers due to the increased distance of the branching position from the polymer backbone, and smaller intermolecular π–π stacking distance.10 First, we synthesized a conjugated polymer including alternated ttTPD and T units, poly{2,5-bis-thiophene-alt-1,3-bis(6-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(5-hexyltridecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PT-ttTPD), and its physical and electrical were compared with those of poly{5,5′-bis-2,2′-bithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(6-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(5-hexyltridecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PBT-ttTPD), as an analogous polymer including bithiophene (BT) units (see Scheme 1). Molecular ordering and optoelectronic properties of the synthesized polymers were investigated using UV–visible absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD), and hole mobility measurements. When an OPVs were fabricated from PT-ttTPD:PC71BM and PBT-ttTPD:PC71BM blends, the PT-ttTPD system exhibited an impressive PCE value of 9.21%, in comparison to the PBT-ttTPD based OPVs with a PCE of 5.05%. The result was mainly related to strong intermolecular interaction and preferentially face-on orientation of PT-ttTPD in the BHJ blend active layer. To the best of our knowledge, a PCE value of 9.21% is the highest PCE value which has not been yet reported for OPVs fabricated from TPD-based polymers.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis and chemical structures of polymers. 
Detailed experimental procedures for the synthesis of the monomers and copolymers are given in the ESI.† PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD were subsequently prepared by Stille-coupling polymerization with ttTPD and mono-thiophene and bi-thiophene monomers (i.e., T or BT) using a Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst. Trace impurities such as metal catalysts and oligomers can have a serious deleterious effect on device performance.11 Thus the crude copolymers were carefully purified by stepwise successive washing with hot methanol, n-hexane, and acetone using a Soxhlet extractor. Then the polymer was dissolved in chloroform and the solution was filtered through a silica gel column. Finally the polymer was precipitated from the solution by adding HPLC grade methanol. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PT-ttTPD is 85000 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.4 while PBT-ttTPD has the Mn of 70000 g mol−1 with a PDI of a 2.8, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). High molecular weights are generally helpful to improve OPV performance by enhancing the JSC and FF, thus making them viable candidates for use in OPV devices. The decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of the polymers were 323 and 325 °C, respectively (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
The UV-visible absorption spectra of PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD in chloroform and in the corresponding cast films are shown in Fig. 1a and b. UV-vis spectrum of PT-ttTPD solution showed a maximum absorption (λmax) at 518 nm, while λmax of PBT-ttTPD was slightly red-shifted to 522 nm. Significant red-shift of UV-vis absorption spectra for these polymer thin films was indicated at 567 and 572 nm, as typically reported in conjugated polymers showing improved conjugation length in a solid state.12 Optical band gap energies (Eoptg) of the PT- and PBT-ttTPD films were indicated as 1.75 and 1.72 eV, respectively.

Additionally, frontier orbital energy levels were determined by CV, as shown in Fig. 1c. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of PT- and PBT-ttTPD were 0.95 and 0.84, corresponding to HOMO energy levels of −5.65 and −5.54 eV, respectively. PBT-ttTPD was higher HOMO energy level, compared to PT-ttTPD, resulting from its extended conjugation driven by more electron-rich BT unit. The lower lying HOMO energy level of PT-ttTPD than that of PBT-ttTPD was expected to increase the VOC of the corresponding OPVs. Also, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymers were estimated from the HOMO levels, obtained from CV measurements and Eoptg values obtained from the UV-visible absorption edges. The LUMO energy levels of PT- and PBT-ttTPD were calculated as −3.90 and −3.82 eV, respectively, which were higher than that of PC71BM. (approximately −4.30 eV) (see Fig. 1d)13 It was expected that charge transfers including an exciton dissociation could be enhanced in these blend films. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers and PC71BM are illustrated in Fig. 2d.

The photovoltaic properties of the PT- and PBT-ttTPD copolymers in OPVs were investigated with an inverted structure including indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymers:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. In the polymer: PC71BM blend films, weight ratios were controlled to be 1:1.3, 1:1.5, and 1:1.7. The performance of the prepared OPV devices was investigated under an AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 2a and b show the current–density–voltage (J–V) curves of OPVs including the polymer:PC71BM blends. VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of all the OPVs are summarized in Table 1. Among all the OPVs, the polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) blend films showed the highest JSC and PCE (see in ESI†). In particular, the best PCEs could be obtained when the active layers were processed with a mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) containing 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO).14

OPVs containing PT-ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) showed the best device performance: VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 15.30 mA cm−2, FF of 70%, and PCE of 9.21%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value is the best one obtained from BHJ OPVs based on TPD derivatives as electron-donating polymers. In contrast, the best PBT-ttTPD based OPV showed much degraded performance: VOC of 0.78 V, JSC of 10.56 mA cm−2, FF of 62%, and PCE of 5.05%. In particular, the difference in VOC between the PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD systems was mainly related to HOMO energy levels of the polymers. It has been known that JSC of OPVs is affected by many factors including the absorption of the active layer, charge carrier mobility, molecular orientation, and morphology of the OPVs.15 The measured JSC values of the devices fabricated using PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD were 15.30 and 10.56 mA cm−2, respectively. The difference in the JSC and FF values of the two devices mainly originated from the different orientations, charge mobilities, and p–n heterojunction morphologies of the active layers.
Also, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the OPVs were measured under illumination of monochromatic light (see Fig. 2c and d). According to the EQE curves, the integral current density values of the devices based on PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD were 14.65 and 10.29 mA cm−2, respectively. The mismatch between the integral values and JSC values obtained from J–V measurements was within 5%, indicating that the J–V measurements were reliable.
To investigate ordered structures of the polymers in spun-cast films, 2D-GIXD was performed on the neat polymer and blend films.16Fig. 3 shows 2D GIXD patterns of the polymer and polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend films. 2D GIXD pattern of PT-ttTPD film spun-cast on PEDOT:PSS-coated Si substrates showed an intense X-ray reflection at Qz = 0.40 Å−1, corresponding to multi-stacked crystal layers containing “edge-on” chains on the substrate, with a layer spacing, d(100) of about 15.7 Å (see Fig. 3a). Additional X-ray reflection was strongly indicated at Qz = 1.65 Å−1, corresponding to vertically stacked crystal planes of “face-on” chains on the substrate, with an inter-molecular π-overlap spacing, d(010) of approximately 3.81 Å. Also, 2D GIXD pattern of spun-cast PBT-ttTPD film showed similar crystal reflections along the Qz axis, indicating d(100) and d(010) values of 19.8 and 3.73 Å, respectively (see Fig. 3b). However, when the polymer:PC71BM blend films were spun-cast from a mixture of CB containing 3 vol% DIO, it was found that crystalline structures and orientations of the polymers in the blend films were drastically changed. 2D-GIXD pattern of the PT-ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) blend film clearly showed enhanced crystallinity and mixed domain phases of both “edge-on” and “face-on” chains preferentially oriented to the substrate (see Fig. 3c). “Face-on” stacking of the donor polymers in the active layer induces vertical π-overlap between the semiconducting polymers, which preferred to transport charge carriers to the electrodes in OPVs, in comparison to “edge-on” stacked films. Interestingly, π-overlap distance of PT-ttTPD in the blend film became 3.69 Å, much closer than that in the neat polymer film, as determined by 1D out-of-plane X-ray profiles (see Fig. 3e). In contrast, 2D-GIXD pattern of the PBT-ttTPD: PC71BM film showed highly ordered (h00) reflections and (010) reflections along the Qz and Qxy axes, respectively, suggesting that PBT-ttTPD chains in the blend film were mostly ordered with an “edge-on” orientation with respect to the substrate (see Fig. 3d). Based on the 2D GIXD results of these polymer and blend films, the π-conjugated orientation of the semiconducting polymers in these films were simplified.

In OPV devices, the enhancement of hole mobility (μh) in electron donor phases is critical in order to efficiently transport charge-carriers transport to electrodes and to suppress photocurrent loss by charge recombination. Using a steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique, μh of the polymers were measured for vertically oriented electrode devices. Fig. 4a and b show J–V curves of hole-only devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer and polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, 3 vol% DIO)/Au geometries (see the inset in Fig. 4a). First, μh values of spun-cast PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD films were 3.31 × 10−5 and 4.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see Fig. 4). Interestingly, μh values of the polymers were significantly changed before and after blending with the PC71BM acceptor. In the blends, μh values of PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD were 1.78 × 10−3 and 3.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved μh of PT-ttTPD in the corresponding blend film was related to the enhanced crystallinity and vertically oriented π-overlap, as determined by 2D GIXD analysis, in comparison to PBT-ttTPD system containing discernible π-overlap oriented parallel to the electrode surfaces. The resulting SCLC mobilities were consistent with the OPV performance of PT-ttTPD system showing higher JSC and FF values than those of the PBT-ttTPD based devices.

Furthermore, phase separated morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).17 As shown in Fig. 5, PBT-ttTPD:PC71BM blend film showed featureless morphology, while in the blend PT-ttTPD could form a network structure of nanofibrillar crystallites.18 The well-ordered nanofibrillar morphology of PT-ttTPD resulted in excellent charge carrier transport along the electrodes. In particular, the higher μh and better conjugated morphology of PT-ttTPD drastically enhanced FFs and device performance, in comparison to the PBT-ttTPD system.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized two novel conjugated polymers, PT-ttTPD and PBT-ttTPD, containing the ε-branched alkyl side chain, the tt π-bridge unit, the TPD moiety and simple thiophene derivatives. The synthesized polymers affected the molecular ordering in the PC71BM blended active layer films. The PT-ttTPD:PC71BM film exhibited a primarily “face-on” crystal structure with a short intermolecular π–π stacking distance, while the PBT-ttTPD:PC71BM film exhibited an “edge-on” structure. The 2D-GIXD results were consistent with the higher SCLC hole mobility of the PT-ttTPD:PC71BM film than that of the PBT-ttTPD:PC71BM film. The OPVs based on PT-ttTPD:PC71BM showed a PCE of 9.21% with a JSC of 15.30 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.86 V, and FF of 70%. This performance is superior to that of PBT-ttTPD-based OPVs with a JSC of 10.56 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.78 V, and FF of 62%. To the best of our knowledge, a PCE value of 9.21% is the best reported value among OPVs fabricated from TPD-based polymers. The correlation between the molecular structure, thin film morphology, and photovoltaic properties of the developed conjugated polymers was established, and may provide guidance for the molecular design of new photovoltaic polymers.

Broader context
Much effort has been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic cells as next generation energy resources. Rational molecular design and synthesis of conjugated polymers based on a deep understanding of the relationship between chemical structures and photophysical properties are crucial for developing high performance OPVs. One of the effective approaches to develop efficient conjugated polymers is to strengthen the intermolecular interaction between conjugated polymer chains by enhancing their molecular orbital overlap. For this purpose, we have modified the donor moiety in the D–π–A system in an attempt to develop higher performing polymers, and controlled the size and shape of the alkyl side chain on TPD to help balance solubility and chain packing in the polymers. We synthesized polymers containing simple thiophene or bithiophene moieties instead of BDT as a donor. This produces a synergistic effect with the ttTPD unit, so that the polymers exhibit broad absorption, a low-lying HOMO energy level, and well-ordered inter-chain orientation in a blend film with PCBM. The best OPV device shows a promising PCE of 9.21%.
