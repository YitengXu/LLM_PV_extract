    , Accepted 15th November 2014First published on 20th November 2014AbstractDouble interlayers consisting of a zwitterionic small molecule layer and a LiF layer were introduced between the electron transport layer and the cathode of perovskite solar cells. The double interlayers improve the photovoltaic efficiency to 13.2%, which is higher than that of control devices without the double interlayer (9.2%) or with LiF (11.0%) or rhodamine 101 zwitterion (12.1%) alone.
Since the reports on solar cells with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with high power conversion efficiency in 2012,1,2 organolead halide based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention, owing to their simple fabrication process, low materials and fabrication costs and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Two types of device structures have been developed: one type of devices has a layer of scaffold metal oxide, such as TiO2 or Al2O3 on indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO).3–6 The porous metal oxide layer can restrict the growth of the perovskite crystals, while large perovskite crystals can lead to large leakage current and poor photovoltaic efficiency.7 Usually, a high-temperature step is needed for the preparation of the scaffold metal oxide layer, and the morphology of the scaffold metal oxide layer strongly affects the photovoltaic performance of the devices. The other type of perovskite solar cells has a planar structure without the scaffold metal oxide layer.8–15 The holes and electrons generated in the perovskite layer transport through the hole-collection and electron-collection layers, respectively, to the two electrodes. The fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells with organic materials for electron and hole transport does not require a high temperature step. Materials, which cannot sustain high temperatures like plastics, can thus be used in planar perovskite solar cells. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are the popular materials for the hole and electron transport layers, respectively, because they can be processed by solution coating and form good physical and electronic contacts with the perovskite layer. Nevertheless, the energy levels of PCBM do not match well with the top metal electrode, such as Ag. As known from organic solar cells, the interfaces between the active layer and the electrodes significantly affect the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency.16–19 Hence, the electrons cannot be efficiently collected at the cathode of PSCs due to the energy mismatch between PCBM and cathode. Interfacial materials including bathocuproine (BCP),20,21 LiF,22 solution deposited TiOx,23 tris(2,4,6-trimethyl-3-(pyridine-3-yl)phenyl)borane (3TPYMB),24 or polyelectrolyte,25 were used between the PCBM layer and the top cathode to improve the electron collection. Wang et al. also used a layer of C60 and a layer of BCP between PCBM and the top metal electrode.20 The C60 layer passivates the defects of the perovskite layer, while the BCP layer can block hole transport and facilitate electron collection. Double interfacial layers have shown a better performance than a single interlayer in organic solar cells due to more efficient charge extraction or suppression of trap-assisted recombination.26,27
In this work, we have investigated the application of rhodamine 101 that is a zwitterion (chemical structure shown in Fig. 1(a)) as the electron-collection interfacial layer and rhodamine 101/LiF as double interlayers between PCBM and the Ag electrode of PSCs. As observed on organic solar cells, zwitterions that have the positive and negative charges on the same molecule can lower the work function of electrodes by the formation of surface dipoles.28,29 The rhodamine 101 layer can be deposited via solution processing without affecting the bottom layers. The presence of the rhodamine 101 layer can increase the PCE from 9.2% to 12.1%, which is higher than the PCE (11.0%) of the PSC with a LiF layer thermally deposited. The PCE is further improved to 13.2% when double interlayers of rhodamine 101 and LiF are used.

The architecture of the PSCs with double interlayers is shown in Fig. 1(b). A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was coated on a pre-cleaned ITO glass. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating a solution of 0.14 M PbCl2, 1.26 M PbI2 and 1.3 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) in a cosolvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (vol. ratio = 3:7) in a glove box filled with highly pure nitrogen. The solution was spin coated at 1000 rpm for 20 s then at 5500 rpm for 60 s. At 40 s, the wet spinning film was quenched by dropping 160 μl of anhydrous toluene. After spin coating, the film was annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3−xCl3 layer was ca. 260 nm. The incorporation of a small amount of chlorine in the perovskite layer can improve the free charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length.30 On top of the perovskite layer, a ca. 50 nm-thick PCBM was deposited. Subsequently rhodamine 101 was deposited by spin coating 0.05 wt% rhodamine 101 solution in isopropanol (IPA) at 2000 rpm. 1 nm-thick LiF was then thermally evaporated. The devices were completed by the thermal deposition of the Ag electrode with a thickness of 100 nm. The rhodamine 101 and LiF layers are the double interlayers between the electron-transport PCBM layer and the Ag electrode. The details of PSC fabrication process are provided in ESI.† Fig. S1† presents the cross-sectional SEM image of a real device without the double interlayers and the top Ag electrode.
Forming a smooth and uniform perovskite layer is critical to the performance of the planar PSCs. In this study, we have adopted a modified two-step method reported by Jeon et al. to form the perovskite layer.6 In such a method, the introduction of toluene during rapid spinning reduces the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx in the cosolvent of DMSO and GBL, thereby promoting fast nucleation and growth of the crystals on the film.31 In order to limit the rapid growth of perovskite crystals for producing compact and uniform films, slightly more Pb2+ ions are introduced (Pb2+:MAI = 1.4 M:1.3 M), and a more concentrated solution is used (1.4 M instead of 0.8 M). The slight excess of PbI2 is used to passivate the perovskite grain boundaries and relevant interfaces, which can suppress the charge carrier recombination.32Fig. 2(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PbI2, MAI and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films. XRD patterns of MAI are absent in that of the perovskite film, suggesting that all the MAI has been consumed to produce perovskite. Because of the excess PbI2 in the precursor solution, there is still a trace amount of PbI2 in the perovskite film, evidenced by the small peak at 12.8° that belongs to the PbI2 crystals. The XRD results are fully consistent with the reports of other labs.32,33

(b) UV-Vis absorption spectra of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film and that coated with a 50 nm-thick PCBM layer or a PCBM + 1 nm-thick rhodamine 101 layer. Inset shows a digital picture of the perovskite film deposited on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass. 
The perovskite layer is semi-transparent and dark brown in colour (as shown in inset of Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(b) displays the UV-Vis spectra of the perovskite layer and also that covered with PCBM or PCBM/rhodamine 101. The absorption onset of the perovskite layer is at ca. 780 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.59 eV. Subsequent coating of PCBM and rhodamine 101 hardly affects the light absorption of the perovskite layer. The absorption profile of perovskite films with PCBM or PCBM/rhodamine 101 layers remains the same as that of the perovskite layer. In fact, the PCBM layer can improve the stability of the perovskite. The perovskite film without the PCBM layer turns grey and opaque after one day in air, while the one with PCBM remains intact (see Fig. S2†). Presumably, the thin PCBM layer on top of the perovskite layer can potentially slow down the diffusion of water and oxygen from air into the perovskite.
The morphology and surface textures of the perovskite layer without and with the PCBM or PCBM/rhodamine 101 layers are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. SEM image of the perovskite layer (Fig. 3(a)) shows that the perovskite crystalline grains are in sub-micrometer sizes and they form a uniform dense film. The perovskite layer completely covers the PEDOT:PSS layer. The structures showing a bright contrast located at the grain boundaries are likely to be the less conductive PbI2 species. This observation is consistent with that reported by Chen et al.32 AFM images show that the surface of the perovskite layer becomes smoother and void-free after coating with PCBM or PCBM/rhodamine 101 (Fig. 3(b)–(d)). The root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) decreases dramatically from 16.1 nm for the perovskite layer to 3.2 nm after the deposition of the PCBM layer, and finally down to 2.2 nm after the deposition of the rhodamine 101 layer.

The height scale bar is 100 nm for (b) and 30 nm for (c) and (d). Root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) values are indicated on the AFM images. 
The PSCs were encapsulated with epoxy and glass sheets. They were then tested under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in air. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the PSCs with different cathode configurations are shown in Fig. 4(a). Their related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Without any cathode interlayer, the J–V curve has an S-shape in the voltage range from −0.1 to 1.1 V. This implies a large internal resistance in the device of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/Ag.34,35 The maximum PCE is 9.2% and the average PCE of 6 devices from two batches is 8.5%. Insertion of a 1 nm-thick LiF layer between the PCBM layer and the Ag electrode simultaneously improves the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) so as to increase the PCE. The maximum and average PCEs are 11.0% and 10.5%, respectively. Rhodamine 101 can help the electron collection more efficiently than LiF. When a rhodamine 101 layer with a thickness of ca. 1 nm is used as the interlayer between PCBM and Ag, the FF dramatically increases from 0.53 to 0.74 while Jsc and Voc stay almost constant. The maximum PCE of the PSCs reaches 12.1%. The efficiency increase by the rhodamine 101 layer is not related to the solvent used for rhodamine 101 processing. Control PSCs fabricated by spin coating pure IPA without rhodamine 101 on the PCBM layer exhibit photovoltaic performance similar to that of PSC without any electron-collection interlayer.

To understand the mechanism for the improvement in the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs by the LiF or rhodamine 101 interlayer, the J–V curves of devices were recorded in the dark (Fig. S3†). Both LiF and rhodamine 101 could simultaneously improve the current injection under the forward bias and suppress the leakage current under reverse bias. Rhodamine 101 produced an even better diode-behaviour than LiF. To quantify these changes, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were extracted from the dark currents at 2 V and 0 V, respectively (Table 1). The Rs value drops from 7.4 Ω cm−2 for glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/Ag to 5.1 Ω cm−2 and 3.5 Ω cm−2 for glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/LiF/Ag and glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/rhodamine 101/Ag, respectively. In addition, the Rsh value increases close to 40 and 20 times after the insertion of LiF and rhodamine 101, respectively.
Since LiF mainly enhanced Voc of PSCs while rhodamine 101 enhanced FF, double interlayers of LiF and rhodamine 101 were used in PSCs. Both Voc and FF of the devices (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/rhodamine 101/LiF/Ag) are higher than those of the devices without any electron-collection interlayer (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/Ag). Voc increases from 0.91 to 1.01 V, and FF increases from 0.53 to 0.73. The double interlayers hardly affect Jsc. Thus, the best PCE becomes 13.2%, which is higher than those of the control devices without any electron-collection interlayer or only one interlayer of either LiF or rhodamine 101. The Voc and FF values are comparable or even higher than those of PSCs with a similar structure as reported in the literature.20–25
Finally to verify the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was acquired for the best PSCs with different cathode configurations (Fig. 4(b)). All the cells showed a broad absorption range from 300 nm to 800 nm. The IPCE values for all the cells are 70–80% in the wavelength range from 450 to 750 nm. The calculated Jsc values by integrating the product of IPCE and solar irradiance at each wavelength are summarized in Table 1. These values were consistent with measured Jsc values derived from J–V curves.
Conclusions
In summary, LiF and a zwitterionic small molecule, i.e. rhodamine 101, were chosen to improve the cathode interface between the PCBM hole blocking layer and the Ag black electrode for planar perovskite solar cells. A single interlayer of LiF (or rhodamine 101) can improve the PCE of PSCs by enhancing Voc (or FF). The PCE is 9.2% for the PSC without any electron-collection layer. It increases to 11.0% and 12.1% after the introducing a single interlayer of LiF and rhodamine 101, respectively. Double interlayers of rhodamine 101 and LiF can simultaneously increase Voc and FF so as to achieve higher PCE. The best PCE reaches 13.2% for the PSCs with rhodamine 101/LiF double interlayers.
