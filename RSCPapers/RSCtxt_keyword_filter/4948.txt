Here, we report a general precursor strategy for one-dimensional titania with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable hierarchical structures realized via a titanate route using electrospun titania fibers as precursors. One-dimensional hierarchical hollow titanate (1D-HHT) was first fabricated under mild alkaline hydrothermal conditions from electrospun amorphous TiO2 precursors. The time-dependent evolution of 1D-HHT has been investigated in detail. The concerted effect of alkaline etching and Ostwald ripening is responsible for the surface nanoprotrusion and modulation of structural hierarchy. Anatase TiO2 with the same hierarchical structures can be obtained using controlled calcination. The as-fabricated one-dimensional titania with varying levels of structural hierarchy exhibits about 1.3–1.5 times higher power conversion efficiency than commercial P25 as a photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The current work may be extended for more functional TiO2-based materials with tunable structural hierarchy and could widen the application range of electrospinning technology for one-dimensional hierarchical structures.
Introduction
Complex inorganic materials with hierarchical micro-/nanostructures have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential applications in important industries such as catalysis, sensing, biomedicine and clean energy, etc.1 It is known that complex hierarchical micro-/nanostructures usually combine the advantages of nanoscale building blocks and hierarchical structure-enhanced functionalities. Consequently, these hierarchical structures can provide large specific surface areas, offer the high dispersion of active sites, enhance the light scattering effect and shorten the diffusion length.2 In particular, one-dimensional (1D) hierarchical structures with hollow or porous interiors are considered as promising structures due to the longitudinal pathways of the hollow or porous interior structures and the 1D interconnected nanocrystal network for efficient electron transport. These prominent advantages make 1D hierarchical micro-/nanostructures highly desirable for functional applications like energy harvesting, conversion and the storage of solar energy.3
Titania (TiO2) is the most used semiconductor oxide due to its excellent optical and electronic properties as well as its long-term stability, low cost and nontoxicity.4 As proof of the above advantages, 1D TiO2 materials with varying levels of structural hierarchy have been proven to exhibit obviously structure-enhanced functional performances in photocatalysts,5 sensors,6 lithium-ion batteries,7 and solar cells.8 Up to now, a number of methods, including the template approach,9 anodic oxidation,10 hydrothermal synthesis,11 and the electrospinning-based approach,3b,12 have been developed for 1D hierarchical TiO2 materials. Among these methods, the electrospinning-based method has emerged as an effective route for 1D hierarchical TiO2 materials with large specific surface areas and high aspect ratios.12 For example, for anatase TiO2 fibres, which were obtained using calcined as-electrospun fibres at 500 °C for 1 h, as precursors, prickle-like hierarchical anatase TiO2 fibres with high surface areas were fabricated via an alkaline hydrothermal process and calcination, and exhibited a significant improvement in DSSC efficiency.12a More 1D hierarchical TiO2 materials were successfully fabricated via similar processes when crystalline TiO2/SiO2 fibres were used as percursors.12b–d Generally, most reported hierarchical structures from electrospun precursors were achieved using an appropriate post-treatment step. As for 1D hierarchical titanate, high concentrations of alkali (above 5 M) and crystalline TiO2 precursors were usually needed for the evolution of the hierarchical structures.12 However, the crystallinity of the precursors and the acidity/basicity of the reaction conditions may cause a different phase and morphological transition of titanate/TiO2, leading to a variety of structural designs for functional applications.13 1D titanate and TiO2 with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable structural hierarchy are expected to be rationally designed. Any attempts along this direction are significant for further investigations in the field of materials chemistry.
It is noteworthy that, like spherical TiO2, hollow, core–shell and yolk–shell hierarchical structures could be facilely fabricated from amorphous TiO2 precursors under mild alkaline conditions, and a mechanism combining alkaline etching and Ostwald ripening may contribute to structure evolution.14 However, few studies have focused on the potential ability of the amorphous as-electrospun polymer/inorganic fibres as precursors for 1D hierarchical structures.3b,12,15 The main limiting factors are probably that a soluble polymer (polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide, etc.) may cause the collapse of the as-electrospun fibres, or an insoluble polymer (polyacrylonitrile, poly(methyl methacrylate), etc.) may prohibit alkaline penetration during the following alkaline hydrothermal process. It is known that the crystallinity of the electrospun TiO2 fibres can be exactly controlled using a post heat-treatment step.16 Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that calcinating the as-electrospun polymer/inorganic fibres at a low-temperature, in which the inorganic precursors remain amorphous while most polymers are decomposed, may be an alternative way to fabricate appropriate 1D amorphous inorganic precursors for constructing 1D TiO2 with tunable structural hierarchy.
Herein, we describe a general precursor strategy for the fabrication of 1D TiO2 fibres with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable interior structures from hollow to porous cores by the hydrothermal alkaline etching of electrospun TiO2 fibers and subsequent calcination. Based on the detailed characterization using TEM, SEM, FTIR and XRD, a mechanism combining alkaline etching and Ostwald ripening is proposed to account for the formation of hierarchical titanate. 1D hierarchical anatase TiO2 fibres that retain the structural hierarchy and surface nanoprotrusion of titanate can be obtained using controlled calcination. When used as a photoanode material for DSSCs, the as-fabricated 1D hierarchical TiO2 exhibits about 1.3–1.5 times higher power conversion efficiency in comparison with that of commercial P25 TiO2. We believe that a large specific surface area and hierarchical structure are responsible for the improvement. Considering the advantages and the universal applicability of electrospinning technology, the current work may provide an alternative strategy for designing more functional 1D TiO2-based materials with on demand, tunable structural hierarchies for high-performance applications.
Experimental section
Materials
Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw ≈ 1300000, Aldrich), anhydrous ethanol (EtOH), acetate acid (HAc), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl, Beijing Chemicals), titanium(IV) butoxide (TBT, Guangfu Fine Chemicals) and Degussa P25 were used. All chemicals were used as received.
Fabrication of the amorphous TiO2 precursors
The electrospun PVP/TiO2 fibres were first prepared via a conventional electrospinning process. Typically, PVP (0.8 g) and TBT (3 g) were added to a mixed solution of EtOH (5.5 g) and HAc (0.5 g), and stirred for 24 h to form a homogeneous precursor solution. The solution was then fed through a syringe with a stainless steel spinneret (18 G). A voltage of 13 kV was applied and the electrospun fibres were collected on grounded aluminium foil placed 25 cm below the tip of the spinneret. The amorphous TiO2 precursors were obtained after calcinating the electrospun PVP/TiO2 fibres at 350 °C for 6 h under an air atmosphere at a rate of 5 °C min−1. For comparison, more fibrous precursors were obtained after calcinating the as-electrospun PVP/TiO2 fibres at 250, 300 and 400 °C for 6 h, and 350 °C for 0, 2 and 4 h.
Fabrication of 1D titania with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable hierarchical structures
The fabrication of 1D-HHT was carried out using a simple hydrothermal reaction under mild alkaline conditions. Typically, 40 mg of the amorphous TiO2 fibres was immersed in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon)-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a total volume of 20 mL. Then, the autoclave was sealed and heated to 150 °C for 24 h. The products were washed repeatedly with DI water until reaching pH ∼ 7, and 1D-HHT was collected. The same process was applied to the other fibrous precursors. The effect of alkaline concentrations on the hierarchical structures was examined under controlled concentrations of 2, 4 and 10 M. 1D hierarchical porous titanate (1D-HPT) was prepared via a similar process using the anatase fibres as precursors and 10 M NaOH.
1D hierarchical hollow TiO2 (1D-HHTiO2) and porous TiO2 (1D-HPTiO2) were fabricated as follows: after the hydrothermal treatment step, the Na+ ions contained in 1D-HHT and 1D-HPT were removed by ion exchanging with HCl (0.1 M) aqueous solution for 24 h; the samples were then washed repeatedly with DI water until reaching pH ∼ 7. Then, the samples were oven-dried at 60 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2.
Preparation of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
0.3 g of 1D-HHTiO2 or 1D-HPTiO2 was dispersed into a mixture of 5 mL of ethyl alcohol and 1 g of terpineol under ultrasonication for 60 min. A paste of commercial P25 nanoparticles (NP) was also prepared using the same method. The NP film was first deposited onto cleaned FTO glass (resistivity 14 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) using the doctor-blade technique and subsequently dried at 125 °C for 6 min, and then the thick film was further treated with TiCl4 (0.2 M) at 70 °C for 1.5 h, followed by an annealing process at 450 °C in air. Then, a 1D-HHTiO2 or 1D-HPTiO2 overlayer was deposited on the annealed NP film and heated using the same heating method as previously mentioned. For comparison, a NP film of the DSSC working electrode with the same thickness was also prepared. The prepared photoanodes were immersed in 0.5 mM N719 dye (Solaronix) for 24 h at room temperature. A Pt counter electrode (CE) was prepared by sputtering Pt on FTO for 30 min. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and Pt-deposited CE were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. The redox acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85/15 v/v) electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine was injected into the cell from the side by capillarity. The area of the working electrodes for solar cell performance testing was 0.25 cm2. Three types of the DSSCs were denoted based on the working electrodes as follows: Cell-I: P25; Cell-II: 1D-HHTiO2; Cell-III: 1D-HPTiO2.
Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed using a JEOL JSM 6700F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an EDS mapping attachment was recorded using an FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin. The thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) were carried out simultaneously using a NETZSCH STA 449C. X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAXrB. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were performed at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420M system. All the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 10 h prior to measurements. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS 66v/S FTIR spectrometer. The carbon content of the samples at each time-dependent evolution was analysed using a Vario MICRO elemental analyser. Inductively Conductive Plasma (ICP) was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300DV ICP spectrometer. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of all the titanates and titania, and the absorption spectra of the electrode films were obtained using a SHIMADZU 2550 Perkin-Elmer UV/vis spectrophotometer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter and illuminated under AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Newport, Model: 94023A), calibrated with a standard silicon solar photodiode.
Results and discussion
The fabrication of 1D hierarchical hollow TiO2 (1D-HHTiO2) was first achieved through the reaction of electrospun amorphous TiO2 fibres (precursor) with 1 M NaOH via a hydrothermal route and subsequent calcination. Prior to the process, amorphous TiO2 precursors with average diameters of 700–850 nm were first fabricated using the well-known electrospinning process, followed by calcination at 350 °C for 6 h (Fig. 1a). The inset a high-magnification SEM image of the cross-section indicates that the amorphous precursors are solid with a smooth surface. According to the TG/DTA curves of the as-electrospun TiO2/PVP composite fibres (Fig. 1b and S1†), a weight loss of about 18% occurs from 300 °C to 350 °C, during which an endothermic peak appears at 340 °C in the DTA curve, indicating the fast decomposition of TBT along with the decomposition of the side substituents of PVP.17 After being calcinated at 350 °C for 6 h, PVP on the surface of the fibres pyrolyzed completely due to exposure to oxygen, and interior PVP decomposed partly or lost the side substituents due to oxygen-deficient decomposition.17b The broad peak at about 27° in the XRD pattern and the inset HRTEM image demonstrates the amorphous nature of the calcinated TiO2 precursors (Fig. 1c).18 It is noteworthy that about 30% adsorbed water and carbonaceous residues remained in the precursors (Fig. 1d), which may modulate the diffusion of the dissolved species (Na+, OH− and Ti2O52−) and the evolution of the hollowing process. Besides, more controlled attempts (i.e. calcinated at 250, 300 and 400 °C for 6 h, and 350 °C for 0, 2 and 4 h) have been made to further verify the appropriateness of the calcination conditions for the amorphous precursor (details described in Fig. S2†).

The hierarchical structures of 1D hierarchical hollow titanate (1D-HHT) after alkaline hydrothermal treatment were revealed using FESEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, well-defined 1D-HHT in a large scale is depicted, with nanoprotrusions self-aligned on the tubular surface emanating from the 1D axis. The cross-section view (Fig. 2b) and the corresponding TEM image (Fig. 2c) further demonstrate the hierarchical nature of 1D-HHT. It is clear that the walls of the tubes are composed of a large quantity of nanoprotrusion with uniform length of 200–350 nm. 1D-HHT contains a perfectly smooth inner surface with an inner diameter of about 700–850 nm, which is approximately the same as the diameter of the electrospun amorphous TiO2 precursors (Fig. 1a). The HRTEM image on a typical standing edge shows a lattice separation of about 0.80 nm (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the lamellar structures of titanate.19 The peaks in the XRD spectrum at 9.8°, 24.1°, 27.8°, 33.4°, 39° and 48°, which are indexed as titanate crystal planes of (200), (110), (310), (301), (501) and (020), further confirm the titanate phase (Na2−xHxTi2O4(OH)2, JCPDS, no. 47-0124) (Fig. 2e).20 The Na/Ti atomic ratio of 1D-HHT was found to be 0.38 by using an ICP spectrometer. The negative deviation from the theoretical value of 1.0 is due to the Na+/H+ exchange during the water washing process. Because of the high pH value of the NaOH solution, the initial titanate is identified as Na2Ti2O4(OH)2.20a The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of 1D-HHT is type IV with a type H3 hysteresis loop (Fig. 2f). The BJH pore size distribution plot (inset) reveals that 1D-HHT contains narrow mesopores centered at 3.3 nm. Besides, the BET surface area and the total pore volume are calculated to be 157.2 m2 g−1 and 0.5 m3 g−1, respectively.

To gain insight into the formation process of 1D-HHT, the time-dependent evolution of the structures was investigated using TEM and FESEM (Fig. 3 and S3†). It is found that the formation of 1D-HHT is strongly dependent on the reaction time. Prior to the reaction (0 min), the electrospun amorphous precursors are solid with smooth surfaces (Fig. 3a). In the initial stage of the hydrothermal process, the alkaline etching reaction between amorphous TiO2 and NaOH solution takes place, and the titanate first nucleates in situ and grows on the surface of the amorphous precursors (Fig. 3b). By increasing the reaction time, the chemical reaction continues from the outside to the inside. An intermediate product is the typical core–shell structure (Fig. 3c and S4†), which is composed of the crystalline titanate shell and amorphous TiO2 core. It is apparent that the titanate shell is loosely packed, and the discernable shell porosity can provide easy access for the dissolved species (Na+, OH−, Ti2O52−) through the shell, ensuring the continuous alkaline etching reaction. When the reaction is complete (1 h), the amorphous TiO2 core is completely consumed. Because of the space confinement and the gradient reaction from the outside to the inside, titanate fibres with better-crystallinity outside and less-crystallinity inside are obtained (Fig. 3d and S5†). The distribution of crystallinity in the titanate fibres is crucial for the next hollow formation. The typical Ostwald ripening may account for the following hollow evacuation process. Because of the less-crystallinity and high surface energy of the inside particles, a hollow structure first appears from the core region (Fig. 3e).21 With prolonged hydrothermal treatment, more particles inside the fibres dissolve and regrow on the surface of the fibres, and the well-defined 1D-HHT is obtained finally (Fig. 3f).

FTIR spectroscopy and XRD were used to characterize the phase structural changes during the hydrothermal process. As seen in Fig. 4a, the peaks at 3420 cm−1 and 1626 cm−1 can be ascribed to the O–H stretching vibration and H–O–H bending vibration, respectively, indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups and water molecules.22 It's clear that the amorphous fibres show only a typical Ti–O–Ti absorption located at 666 cm–1, for the disorder of the amorphous TiO2 particles. During alkaline etching assisted crystallization, the band at 898 cm−1, which is attributed to the Ti–O–Na+ stretching modes, appears gradually.23 The intensities of the Ti–O (1385 cm−1) and Ti–O–Ti (520 cm–1) peaks increase with the increasing reaction time, for the formation of TiO6 octahedra in titanate.23b The corresponding XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4b further demonstrate the process of titanate crystallization. With the progress of the hydrothermal reaction, the diffraction peaks of titanate become more and more intense, suggesting the crystallization and growth of titanate nanocrystals. Fig. 4c is the dependence of carbon content on the time of evolution. We can observe that the ratio of carbon (wt%) in the precursors and 1D-HHT is reduced from 13.8 to 2.6, which suggests that the carbonaceous amorphous residues in the precursors would be etched and dissolved into the NaOH solutions. The elemental mapping images of the core–shell intermediate obtained at 150 °C for 30 min are illustrated in Fig. 4d. Titanium, oxygen and sodium are detected at significant levels, and carbon is mainly detected in the core. This phenomenon further confirms the dissolution of the carbonaceous residues during the hydrothermal process.

Based on the above detailed characterization, a mechanism combining alkaline etching and Ostwald ripening is proposed to account for the formation of 1D-HHT, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The typical alkaline etching assisted crystallization,19a,20 is shown in the following reaction formula: 2TiO2 + 2OH− + 2Na+ → Na2TiO2O4(OH)2it will take place at the surface of the amorphous precursors, where OH− and Na+ connect with amorphous TiO2. Titanate fibres with a gradient of crystallization are formed after 1 h. Note that during this stage, the gradient of crystallization comes from the gradient reaction from the outside to the inside of the fibres. Therefore, it is possible that speeding up the reaction (e.g. improving the reaction temperature or alkaline concentration) will reduce the gradient, which may affect the following Ostwald ripening process, resulting in more adjustable hierarchical structures. Also, note that the hollowing process first appears from the core region instead of the surface, which is different from the typically reported alkaline etching assisted hollowing processes.8,14 It is speculated that the carbonaceous residues in the precursors may retard the diffusion of the obtained Ti2O52−, leading to titanate nucleating and growing in situ during the alkaline etching assisted crystallization. Moreover, the carbonaceous residues are etched and dissolved throughout the process (Fig. 4c), the left voids also benefit the hierarchical hollow structure.
 Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of the formation process of 1D-HHT. Etching reaction: amorphous TiO2 reacts with alkali from the outside to the inside of the fibres, and titanate fibres with a gradient of crystallization are formed after 1 h; Ostwald ripening: formation of the hollow structure via the Ostwald ripening process, in which the inner less-crystalline titanate nanocrystals dissolve and regrow on the surface. The carbonaceous amorphous residues in the precursors are etched and dissolved throughout the process. 
It is intriguing that the mesostructures of 1D titanate are alkaline concentration-dependent and precursor-dependent, specifically, the hollow interior, the nanomesh core and the mesoporous interior. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, the 1D titanate hierarchical structures with hollow and core–shell interiors are obtained when the concentration of NaOH increases from 2 to 4 to 10 M. It is known that increasing the alkaline concentration promotes titanate growth in general,14c,24 which reduces the gradient distribution of the as-formed primary titanate crystallites. As a result, titanate tends to grow on the surface and in the core of 1D titanate simultaneously during the following Ostwald ripening process, resulting in 1D core–shell titanate. Besides, the anatase fibres obtained by calcination at high temperatures were used as precursors for comparison. No changes happen to them under 1 M NaOH (Fig. S6†), indicating that anatase cannot react with 1 M NaOH under the current conditions. By increasing the NaOH concentration to 10 M, the hierarchical structures composed of a nanoprotruded exterior and mesoporous interior are observed (denoted as 1D hierarchical porous titanate, 1D-HPT, Fig. 6d). The BET surface area of 1D-HPT is 337.0 m2 g−1, with mesopores centred at 9.0 nm (Fig. S7†). The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-fabricated titanates are shown in Fig. S8.† The results indicate that all titanates obtained from the amorphous precursors have better optical absorptions than that of 1D-HPT. The bandgap of 1D-HPT estimated from the spectrum is 3.64 eV, while the bandgap of 1D-HHT was significantly reduced to 3.38 eV. This phenomenon could be attributed to the chemical bonding between titanate and the specific sites of the carbonaceous residues,25 which is in agreement with the brown colour of 1D-HHT. It should be mentioned that similar mesoporous titanate hierarchical structures were also prepared by other researchers,12 while this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that electrospun amorphous fibres have been used to fabricate 1D hierarchical structures. Therefore, 1D titanates with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable structural hierarchy can be designed by adjusting the parameters of the evolution process.

Anatase TiO2 with the same 1D hierarchical structures can be transformed from protonic titanate using controlled calcination. Taking 1D-HHT and 1D-HPT, for example, calcination at 550 °C for 2 h preserves the initial hierarchical structures (denoted as 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2, respectively) (Fig. 7a and b). It is clear that almost no decomposition of the structures appears, indicating that the acidified titanate can be transformed into anatase directly at the atomic scale because of the structural similarity and low lattice mismatch between the titanate and anatase structures.5a The XRD patterns confirm that both of the as-obtained products are anatase phase (JCPDS, no. 21-1272) (Fig. 7c). Fig. 7d shows the Raman spectra of 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2. Both of the products exhibit five Raman bands at 143, 195, 395, 515 and 638 cm−1, which correspond to the active Raman modes of the anatase phase with symmetries of Eg1, Eg2, B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg3, respectively.26 The Raman spectra do not exhibit any Raman modes at 445 cm−1, or ∼1338, ∼1572 and ∼1608 cm−1, indicating that no rutile phase or carbonaceous residues exist in the as-fabricated products.26a,27 Thus, 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 exhibit a pure anatase phase with good crystal quality. The UV-visible DRS spectra of 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 in Fig. 7e indicate the fundamental absorption edge of TiO2, which is located in the UV region at about 380 nm. The corresponding plots of the Kubelka–Munk function (inset) indicate that the bandgaps of 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 are 3.29 and 3.27 eV, respectively, which are nearly identical to that of pure bulk anatase TiO2.28Fig. 7f shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the BJH pore size distribution plots (inset) of 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2. Both of the samples exhibit typical IV isotherms with a type H3 hysteresis loop. The BJH pore size distribution plots (inset) reveal that 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 have relatively narrow pore size distributions, centered at 18.4 nm and 21.6 nm, respectively. Besides, after calcination, the BET surface area drops from 157.2 to 95.1 m2 g−1 for 1D-HHTiO2, and from 337.0 to 104.1 m2 g−1 for 1D-HPTiO2 (Table S1†). The 1D hierarchical structural anatase samples with high surface areas are needed for greater dye loading, efficient electron transport, enhanced light scattering ability, and are highly desirable as potential photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).8,20c,29

The potential photovoltaic abilities of the as-prepared 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 were studied using the DSSCs working electrodes. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 1. The circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 1D-HPTiO2 (18.03 mA cm−2) is higher than that of 1D-HHTiO2 (14.94 mA cm−2) and P25 (12.45 mA cm−2). Besides, 1D-HPTiO2 exhibits a significant improvement in power conversion efficiency (η) (7.94%), which is 1.3 and 1.5 times higher than that of 1D-HHTiO2 (6.72%) and P25 (5.27%), respectively. The enhancement of Jsc and of η in 1D-HPTiO2 is ascribed to the higher surface area and better light scattering ability, which can contribute to a higher dye loading and light harvesting, and thereby the power conversion efficiency.8,20c,29 We recognize that the performances of 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 are not good enough. Designing aligned or metal-doped 1D hierarchical TiO2 may further enhance the photovoltaic abilities.30 Work in this direction is currently in progress.

Conclusions
1D TiO2 with surface nanoprotrusion and tunable structural hierarchy has been successfully fabricated from electrospun TiO2 precursors via a mild alkaline hydrothermal method and calcination. Based on the detailed characterization, alkaline etching and Ostwald ripening are responsible for the formation of the hierarchical hollow structures, and the modulation of the structural hierarchy, such as core–shells and porosity, can be designed by adjusting the parameters of the evolution process. When used as photoanode materials for DSSCs, the as-fabricated 1D-HHTiO2 and 1D-HPTiO2 exhibit about 1.3–1.5 times higher power conversion efficiency than that of commercial P25 TiO2. Moreover, the current contribution may be generalized for the fabrication of 1D functional materials with tunable hierarchical structures.
