    , Accepted 22nd April 2020First published on 22nd April 2020AbstractDeveloping cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts with low kinetic overpotential and superior stability for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial to build a water splitting system for advancing the production of hydrogen fuel. Herein, we report a bifunctional catalyst by doping atomic Ir into a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) using a facile atmospheric solvothermal method and subsequent spontaneous galvanic displacement. The as-synthesized atomic Ir-doped NiCo LDH exhibits much better durability for over 200 h than the NiCo LDH with the loading of Ir nanoparticles, due to the fine doping of atomic Ir into the crystal lattice of LDH. Benefiting from the synergistic effects in the HER/OER processes, as well as the large electrochemically active surface area and the improved electrical conductivity, the atomic Ir-doped NiCo LDH couple results in an unprecedented performance for overall water splitting with a low cell voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm−2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Finally, a practical solar-driven water splitting system with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 14.8% is demonstrated, outperforming the state-of-the-art analogous systems based on ordinary Si solar cells.
Introduction
Water splitting is considered a sustainable approach to enable the storage of intermittent solar and wind energies as clean hydrogen energy.1 The key point is to develop rational electrocatalysts to simultaneously accelerate both the half-reactions of water splitting, which are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).2,3 Such bifunctional catalysts prominently simplify the system, reduce costs and prevent the possible cross-contamination between the two electrodes during the electrolysis process. Tremendous efforts have been made to achieve overall water splitting in industry-preferred alkaline environments; however, most of them generally proceed at relatively high values of applied voltage (>1.5 V, defined at 10 mA cm−2).4–6 There is still room to improve the efficiency of bifunctional catalysts.
Hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides and selenides of Fe, Co, Ni and Mo in various forms are currently being studied intensively as electrocatalysts due to their low-cost and efficacy.7–11 In particular, Ni-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) (e.g., NiFe and NiCo LDHs) with attractive two-dimensional (2D) anionic clays have shown promising OER activity during alkaline water splitting and have drawn intensive attention due to their abundance in the earth's crust, high surface area and tunable chemical composition.12,13 Unfortunately they are very inert in the HER under alkaline conditions (overpotential >210 mV at 10 mA cm−2).14,15 Under alkaline conditions, the HER kinetics depends on a delicate balance between the water dissociation (the Volmer step) and concomitant desorption of water dissociation products (the Heyrovsky or Tafel step).16 Although the Ni centers possess good adsorption ability toward water molecules and OH− intermediates, the binding strength of the hydrogen on the Fe or Co centers is relatively weak, leading to a large kinetic energy barrier for the Volmer step and thus sluggish kinetics of the HER.4,17 The doping of noble metals may solve such shortcomings,18–20 since previous theoretical and experimental results evidenced that they have suitable adsorption and binding energies for the key reaction intermediates and kinetics for both the OER and HER.1,4,21 For example, Chen et al. synthesized Ru-doped NiFe–LDH using a one-pot hydrothermal reaction, which significantly enhanced the activity toward the HER and delivered a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.52 V during overall water splitting.4 However, only 10 h of stability was exhibited. Using a similar method, Li et al. designed a bifunctional catalyst based on Ir-doped NiV LDH, which achieved a low applied voltage of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting.20 Still, the stability was not satisfactory where the applied potential at 10 mA cm−2 increased gradually with the addition of time within 16 h. In light of the above discussions, coupling noble metals with LDH seems effective in developing bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, the synergistic interactions between noble metals and LDH towards the catalytic activity and durability have rarely been studied, which should be of critical importance for maximizing the effective utilization of noble metals and further improving their catalytic performance.
We report here that a facile atmospheric solvothermal method and subsequent spontaneous galvanic displacement can form atomic Ir-doped NiCo LDH (denoted as Ir–NiCo LDH). High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy proved the homogeneously dispersed state of atomic Ir and the introduction of amorphous regions and lattice distortions in the Ir–NiCo LDH. More abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) were observed after doping Ir into the NiCo LDH as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The strong electronic coupling between the Ir catalyst and NiCo LDH in the Ir–NiCo LDH was elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Remarkably, the resultant Ir–NiCo LDH displayed excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 21 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and a substantially small Tafel slope of 35 mV per decade in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, the OER performance of Ir–NiCo LDH also improved obviously compared with that of the bare NiCo LDH. Thereby, using the Ir–NiCo LDH electrocatalyst as both the anode and cathode, the alkaline electrolyzer delivered a low cell voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm−2 with a sustainable stability of more than 200 h. Significantly, a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 14.8% for overall solar water splitting was achieved when driven by three series-connected and ordinary Si solar cells. The present work demonstrates atomic doping with a noble metal in non-precious Ni-based layered double hydroxide and provides a new perspective for the design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting, which also opens up new avenues for activating unconventional materials in other energy storage and conversion systems.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Nickel foam (NF) (1 mm, thick) was purchased from Hefei Kejing Co., Ltd. CoCl2·6H2O, IrCl3·6H2O, IrO2 powder and 5 wt% Nafion solution are from Sigma-Aldrich. Reagents, including NaCl, NaOH, KOH, ethanol, ethylene glycol and acetone, were from Shanghai Aladdin Co. Ltd. All the reagents are of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity of about 18.5 MΩ was used throughout the experimental processes.
Synthesis of NiCo LDH and Ir–NiCo LDH on NF
Prior to the synthesis, one piece of NF (2 × 1 cm2) was successively washed with HCl (20%), acetone and ethanol for 15 min, to ensure that there is no oxide and other materials on the surface. NiCo LDH was synthesized on Ni foam through an atmospheric solvothermal reaction as follows: CoCl2·6H2O (0.8 mmol) and urea (2 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (40 mL) in a beaker to form a homogeneous precursor solution. The above beaker was transferred to a water bath kettle with a temperature of 90 °C and stirred with a frequency of 200 rpm min−1. Then, a piece of NF was hung on the edge of the beaker and immersed in the precursor solution for 2 h. Finally, the achieved NiCo LDH on NF was washed with ethanol and deionized water three times and dried under atmospheric pressure in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
Ir–NiCo LDH was synthesized by the spontaneous galvanic displacement of NiCo LDH with Ir precursor solution. The galvanic displacement reaction between NiCo LDH and Ir precursor occurs on account of their different potentials as follows: Ni(OH)2 + 2e− ↔ Ni + 2OH−, E0 = −0.72 V(1) Co(OH)2 + 2e− ↔ Co + 2OH−, E0 = −0.73 V(2) Co(OH)3 + e− ↔ Co(OH)2 + OH−, E0 = +0.17 V(3) Ir3+ + 3e− ↔ Ir, E0 = +1.19 V(4)
Note that the values of the overall potential for the fabrication of Ir–NiCo LDH are positive (E0 > 0), which is thermodynamically favored. These values confirm the spontaneous irreversible processes.
IrCl3·3H2O (2 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (20 mL) in a beaker to form a homogeneous precursor solution. Then, a variable amount of IrCl3·3H2O and NaOH (10 mmol) was placed in a flask and dissolved in 40 mL deionized water. A piece of NiCo LDH/NF was hung on the edge of the beaker and immersed in the precursor solution. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, the collected sample named Ir–NiCo LDH/NF was washed with ethanol and deionized water three times and dried under atmospheric pressure in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Samples with different Ir contents doped in NiCo LDH were prepared by the same procedure, except with different amounts of the IrCl3·3H2O precursor (e.g., 10, 25, 50 and 100 μL).
Synthesis Ir NPs/NiCo LDH on NF
Ir nanoparticles (Ir NPs) were synthesized using a polyol-assisted reduction method. H2IrCl6 (2 mmol) and NaOH (5 mmol) were mixed with 10 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of ethylene glycol. After stirring the solution with the purification of N2 for 30 min, the above solution was then transferred to a 25 mL stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 160 °C for 3 h in a drying oven. Then after cooling to room temperature naturally, Ir NPs dispersed in the above solution were finally achieved. The Ir NPs/NiCo LDH was prepared by dropping an appropriate amount of the Ir NP solution onto the NiCo LDH.
Synthesis of Pt/C and Ir/C on NF
For comparison, Pt/C and Ir/C were coated on NF utilizing a universal approach. Typically, 10 mg catalyst powder and 20 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in ethanol (980 μL) with the assistance of ultrasonication for at least 1 h to form a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 200 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped onto NF (2 × 1 cm2). After drying at 60 °C overnight, the loading amount of Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts was estimated to be 2 mg cm−2. We applied Ultrapure Milli-Q water to prepare electrolytes and wash samples.
Characterization
SEM imaging and corresponding elemental mapping as well as EDX analysis were performed using a microscope system (SU-8010, Hitachi) working at 10 kV. Elemental analysis of metal ions was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) with an OPTIMA 8000 analyzer (PerkinElmer Inc.) The FEI STEM images and EDX elemental maps were obtained using a Titan G2 F20 S-TWIN operated at 200 kV. The lattice fringes in the TEM images were analyzed using Digital Micrograph software. Crystal structure measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation and a Lynx Eye detector. XPS measurements were performed at room temperature using a hemispherical analyzer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo); the C1s value was set at 284.6 eV for charge corrections.
Electrochemical measurements
OER and HER catalytic activity measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (BioLogic, SP-150) in a standard three-electrode configuration, which was composed of a working electrode, counter electrode (carbon rod), and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl)). All the measurements were conducted in a N2-saturated 1 M purified KOH electrolyte solution (pH = 13.6) at room temperature (25 °C), which was saturated with N2 before the HER and OER measurements. All pH values were determined using a pH meter (S220 SevenCompact™ pH/Ion). The final potential was translated into the RHE according to the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 V × pH(5)where E(Ag/AgCl) = 0.197 V. The Ag/AgCl electrode was also calibrated in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution with respect to the RHE before measurements.
Before all the electrochemical measurements were performed, galvanostatic measurements at a fixed current density of −10 mA cm−2 or 10 mA cm−2 were performed until a stable potential was obtained. The HER and OER polarization curves were obtained at room temperature, with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 to avoid the possible contribution of capacitive current. The voltage sweep ranges for the OER and HER were 1.2–1.7 VRHE and 0 to −0.65 VRHE, respectively. All polarization curves are presented without iR correction. By plotting overpotential against log(J) from the polarization curves, Tafel slopes can be obtained. They can be calculated using the Tafel equation (Vop = blog(J) + a, where J, Vop, and b represent the current density, overpotential, and Tafel slope, respectively). The ECSA was measured by CV in the potential windows 0–0.2 VRHE and 0.95–1.15 VRHE where no faradaic reactions occurred, with different scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 mV s−1 by plotting the ΔJ = (Janodic − Jcathodic) at 0.1 and 1.05 VRHE against the scan rate, in which the slope is proportional to the Cdl. The turnover frequency (TOF) value is calculated from the equation: TOF = J × S/(x × F × m),20,22 where J is the current density at a given overpotential in A cm−2, S is the area of the working electrode, x is 2 and 4 for the OER and HER, respectively, F is the Faraday constant (a value of 96485 C mol−1) and m is the number of moles of the active materials deposited on the working electrode. All the Ni, Co and Ir atoms are regarded as the active sites to give a conservative estimation of the TOF. EIS was performed when the working electrode was biased at constant potentials of −0.2 VRHE and 1.5 VRHE in the dark in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
For the overall water splitting measurements, the performance was characterized using polarization curves in a two-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. To evaluate the stability of different electrodes, long-term durability tests at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 were conducted in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The electrolyte was replaced and the sample was rinsed every 12 h during the stability measurements. We also adopted three series-connected ordinary single crystal Si solar cells under simulated 1-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) to provide the voltage for direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion in the same two electrode system. The theoretical solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency (ηSTH) can be estimated by using ηSTH = 1.23 V × Jop/Psun, where Jopis the current density and Psun is the power of the illumination per unit area. Oxygen and hydrogen were collected using the water displacement method during the water splitting electrolyzer test (Ir–NiCo LDH as both the anode and cathode), and then the faradaic efficiency was calculated for both the OER and HER. The evolved oxygen and hydrogen gas on the electrode were separately collected with a 20 mL graduated cylinder, which was filled with the electrolyte. During the test, the volumes of the collected oxygen and hydrogen gas were recorded and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC7900) every 10 min. The accumulated charge passing through the working electrode was calculated using the equation: Q = It, where I is the electrolysis current and t is the electrolysis time.
Results and discussion
The Ir–NiCo LDH was in situ synthesized on nickel foam (NF) via a two-step route, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The pristine NiCo LDH was first grown on NF via a solvothermal method under the atmosphere and at a low temperature of 90 °C. NF with excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical strength serves as both the substrate and the Ni source for the growth of NiCo LDH. Its high porous flexibility and specific surface area are also favorable for the diffusion of electrolytes and gas evolution during the water splitting process.23,24 Then the NiCo LDH/NF sample was immersed in a homogeneous precursor solution containing variable amounts of IrCl3·3H2O. Owing to the high permeability of NiCo LDH and profitable thermodynamic potentials between NiCo LDH and the Ir precursor, Ir–NiCo LDH can be fabricated by the spontaneous galvanic displacement of NiCo in LDH by Ir ions (see the details in the Experimental section).25 The spontaneous galvanic displacement reaction between the NiCo LDH and Ir precursor solution was experimentally confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) which revealed the emergence of Ni and Co elements but the dilution of Ir contents in the Ir3+ precursor solution after the spontaneous galvanic displacement reaction (Table S1†). In order to investigate the role of the Ir dopants, Ir precursor solutions with different amounts of IrCl3·3H2O (0 μL, 10 μL, 25 μL, 50 μL and 100 μL) were prepared (see the details in the Experimental section). The morphology of various LDHs was observed utilizing field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 1a, b and S1†). All the samples consist of numerous vertically aligned and interconnected nanosheets, indicating the successful growth of LDH. Interestingly, as the amount of IrCl3·3H2O in the Ir precursor increases to 50 μL, the achieved Ir–NiCo LDH maintains the overall nanosheet morphology, but the nanosheets become larger and the corresponding surfaces become rough at the nanoscale (Fig. 1a and b). The corresponding low-magnification SEM images are provided in Fig. S2† to show the 3D architecture of the electrode more clearly. In Fig. S1,† it can be seen that the nanosheets tend to turn into nanorods once the amount of IrCl3·3H2O becomes larger than 100 μL. Unless otherwise stated, Ir–NiCo LDH hereafter refers to the Ir–NiCo LDH prepared in 50 μL IrCl3 solution since this sample exhibits the best catalytic activity. The ratios of metal ions in the pristine NiCo LDH and various Ir-doped NiCo LDHs were first determined by ICP-AES (Table S2†). The Ir content of the Ir–NiCo LDH was detected to be 3.4 wt%, which was also confirmed by EDX spectroscopy (Fig. S3†).

The morphology of Ir–NiCo LDH, which was peeled off from the surface of NF with the assistance of ultrasonication, was further revealed by TEM (Fig. 1c and S4a†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of pristine NiCo LDH shows a hexagonal crystal phase with several diffraction rings, indicating that the pristine NiCo LDH was polycrystalline in nature (Fig. S4b†). However, weaker diffraction rings are observed in the SAED pattern in Fig. 1d, which confirms the lower crystallinity of NiCo LDH after Ir doping. The lattice spacing of ∼0.232 nm in the high-resolution TEM image can be indexed to the (015) plane of NiCo LDH (Fig. S4c†). Although the lattice spacing along the (015) direction shows a negligible change, distinct crystalline phases with lattice distortions (denoted by orange circles) are observed in the high-resolution TEM image of Ir–NiCo LDH (Fig. 1e). The relatively poor crystallinity and observed lattice distortions are associated with the formation of abundant crystal defects in the as-made Ir–NiCo LDH.26,27Fig. 1f displays the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the Ir–NiCo LDH, in which the small, homogeneously distributed bright dots with sizes of ∼0.2 nm confirm the presence of single Ir atoms dispersed in the Ir–NiCo LDH catalysts.28,29 The low-resolution HAADF-STEM micrograph and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images further reveal that the Ir element is uniformly distributed with Ni, Co and O elements, and no local aggregation of Ir can be observed (Fig. 1g). These results strongly suggest the successful doping of metal Ir atoms into NiCo LDH. For comparison, NiCo LDH loaded with 3.4 wt% Ir nanoparticles (denoted as Ir NP/NiCo LDH) was also prepared through dropping of Ir NPs (Fig. S5†), which were synthesized by a polyol-assisted reduction process (see the details in the Experimental section).
To observe the detailed structural evolution of NiCo LDH after the loading of Ir NPs or doping of Ir atoms, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EPR and XPS were systematically conducted. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of the pristine NiCo LDH sample exhibits a series of diffraction peaks, which are in good agreement with the well-known hydrotalcite-like LDH phase (JCPDS card no. 38-0715).20,30,31 No additional diffraction peaks due to crystalline impurities are observed. With the loading of Ir NPs, the diffraction peaks remain the same, indicating that the attachment of Ir NPs does not affect the crystallinity of NiCo LDH. However, the XRD patterns of Ir–NiCo LDH are dependent on the concentration of the Ir precursor. The (003) and (006) peaks gradually shift to lower values with increased diffraction peak width and reduced peak intensity (Fig. S6†). The variation in XRD patterns implies that the introduction of larger Ir ions into NiCo LDH reduced the crystalline quality and induced a lattice expansion, due to the isomorphic substitution of Ni or Co by Ir during the galvanic displacement process.27,32
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns, (b) Raman spectra, (c) EPR spectra, and high-resolution XPS (d) Ni 2p, (e) Co 2p and (f) Ir 4f spectra of the pristine NiCo LDH, Ir NPs/NiCo LDH and Ir–NiCo LDH with different amounts of Ir. 
Raman spectroscopy was performed to obtain the chemical structure of these samples (Fig. 2b). The Raman peaks at about 458 cm−1 and 525 cm−1 can be assigned to the bending and stretching vibration of Ni–O, in good accordance with the observation of α-Ni(OH)2.33,34 The pristine NiCo LDHs before and after the loading of Ir NPs show similar spectra, while the intensity of Raman peaks decreases gradually with the increase of the Ir content in Ir–NiCo LDH. The weaker Raman peaks can be attributed to the evolution of the crystalline structure and defects caused by doping,35,36 which is consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 2c shows the EPR spectra of various samples. The EPR signal measured at g = 2.003 can be identified as electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies (OVs).37 A relatively low signal is detected for the pristine NiCo LDH and Ir NPs/NiCo LDH, as expected for a highly crystalline structure. In contrast, a significantly enhanced signal is observed for Ir–NiCo LDH with the increase of Ir doping. Based on the observations above, it is reasonable to infer that the observed OVs in the Ir–NiCo LDH should mainly locate in the amorphous region and crystal defects, which is also in line with previous reports.38,39 Recently, the incorporation of OVs in catalysts has been found to remarkably increase the number of active sites, enhance the electrical conductivity and also reduce the energy barrier for the OER, which benefits the improvement of both HER and OER activity.40–42
The electronic structure and valence states of the LDH samples were investigated by XPS. Compared with the pristine NiCo LDH, the survey spectrum of Ir–NiCo LDH clearly exhibits the element signals of Ir, which further confirms the presence of Ir in the Ir–NiCo LDH (Fig. S7†). For the pristine NiCo LDH, the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum can be fitted into two spin–orbit peaks, Ni2+ 2p3/2 at 855.6 eV and Ni2+ 2p1/2 at 873.5 eV, with their satellite peaks (Fig. 2d and S8a†). This is in agreement with previous reports.43,44 The Co 2p spectrum of pristine NiCo LDH shows two distinct doublets (2p3/2 and 2p1/2): one doublet at about 782.1 eV and 797.7 eV belongs to Co2+, and the other at about 780.9 eV and 796.3 eV is assigned to Co3+ (Fig. 2e and S8b†),45 suggesting two oxidation states (+2 and +3) of Co species in the pristine NiCo LDH. The XPS Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra of the Ir NPs/NiCo LDH are generally what we observed for the pristine NiCo LDH. However, it is worth noting that the binding energy of Ni 2p in the Ir–NiCo LDH gradually shifts to higher values, whereas that of Co 2p gradually shifts to lower values with increased Ir doping. Meanwhile, the Ir 4f binding energy is also dependent on the doping amount of Ir in Ir–NiCo LDH (Fig. 2f). As the amount of Ir precursor decreases, the Ir 4f binding energy gradually shifts to a higher energy than that of Ir NPs/NiCo LDH. Moreover, the high-resolution Ir 4f spectrum of Ir–NiCo LDH can also be decomposed into two spin–orbit doublet characteristics (Fig. S9†). The peaks at 62.0 and 65.0 eV correspond to Ir4+ 4f7/2 and Ir4+ 4f5/2, and the main peaks at 62.4 and 65.6 eV are ascribed to Ir3+ 4f7/2 and Ir3+ 4f5/2, respectively.46,47 The results highlight the strong influence of Ir atom doping on the electronic structure of NiCo LDH.
The HER and OER properties of the as-prepared electrodes were directly evaluated using a three-electrode system in a N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution (see the details in the Experimental section). For comparison, the commercial Pt/C or Ir/C catalysts loaded on NF and the bare NF samples were also analyzed as controls. All the potentials in this work are referenced to the RHE, and the calibration of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was conducted in a H2 saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte before measurement (Fig. S10†). The catalytic performances of Ir–NiCo LDH with different Ir contents were first studied. As a result, Ir–NiCo LDH prepared in 50 μL of IrCl3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for both the HER and OER (Fig. S11 and S12†). The intrinsic activities of Ir–NiCo LDH with different amounts of Ir toward both the HER and OER were further studied by calculating the TOF. As shown in Fig. S13 and S14,† Ir–NiCo LDH prepared in 50 μL of IrCl3 possessed the highest TOF, suggesting the improved intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Adopting the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 as a standard, the pristine NiCo LDH on the NF presents a very large HER overpotential of ∼212 mV (Fig. 3a). The loading of Ir NPs can enhance its HER activity, but the activity was still far inferior to that of commercial Pt/C. Remarkably, the Ir–NiCo LDH exhibits a leap in HER performance with an extremely low overpotential of only 21 mV, which is also much lower than that of the Pt/C catalyst (53 mV). Furthermore, this value is not transient, as revealed in Fig. 3b. The excellent HER activity of Ir–NiCo LDH is also reflected by its lower Tafel slope (Fig. 3c). The Ir–NiCo LDH possesses a Tafel slope of 33.2 mV dec−1, which is close to that of the Ir NPs/NiCo LDH (34.3 mV dec−1) and Pt/C catalyst (35.2 mV dec−1) and much smaller than that of the pure NiCo LDH (124.5 mV dec−1), indicating the faster HER kinetics. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, the Ir–NiCo LDH delivers a rather high HER performance which is superior to that of most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions (Fig. 3d; Table S3†).

Generally, the catalytic activity is determined by the intrinsic activity and total number of active sites.23 To explore the relative electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of the various catalysts, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was investigated by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the proper potential window free of faradaic processes (Fig. S15†).48 As revealed in Fig. 3e, the Ir–NiCo LDH exhibits a Cdl value of 8.2 mF cm−2, which is substantially higher than that of the pure NiCo LDH (1.7 mF cm−2) and Ir NPs/NiCo LDH (4.8 mF cm−2). The largest ECSA of Ir–NiCo LDH suggests the highest number of active sites, which is expected to be determined by the compositional and structural features (Fig. 1 and 2). To gain deep insight into the kinetics with catalytic activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed (Fig. 3f). The Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit (Fig. S16†), and the obtained series resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) are summarized in Table S4.† As expected, the Ir–NiCo LDH exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) (0.65 Ω) compared with pristine NiCo LDH (15.51 Ω) and Ir NPs/NiCo LDH (2.95 Ω), indicating the accelerated HER kinetics at the interface between the surface of Ir–NiCo LDH and the electrolyte. In addition, the solution resistance (Rs) of the Ir–NiCo LDH (0.35 Ω) turned out to be smaller than that of pristine NiCo LDH (0.46 Ω) and Ir NPs/NiCo LDH (0.57 Ω). This demonstrates that the doping of metallic Ir enhances the electrical conductivity of the NiCo LDH catalyst, owing to the higher amount of OVs.49
As the major barrier for water splitting, the OER hinders the efficiency promotion of overall water splitting. To better prove their utility, the OER performance of the above catalysts was also evaluated in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH. To minimize the effect of the capacitive current originating from Ni ion oxidation, the polarization curves were recorded at a small scan rate of 1 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 4a, the OER activities of both the Ir–NiCo LDH and Ir NPs/NiCo LDH are obviously improved compared with that of NiCo LDH. Significantly, Ir–NiCo LDH even shows better OER activity than commercial Ir/C. To deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, the Ir–NiCo LDH affords overpotentials of 192 and 245 mV, respectively, which are lower than those of Ir NPs/NiCo LDH (210 and 273 mV) and Ir/C (215 and 300 mV) and much lower than those of bare NiCo LDH (284 and 364 mV) (Fig. 4b). The Ir–NiCo LDH also displays high reaction kinetics, with a Tafel slope of 41.2 mV dec−1, lower than the 47 mV dec−1 of Ir NPs/NiCo LDH, 70.7 mV dec−1 of Ir/C and 104.7 mV dec−1 of the bare NiCo LDH (Fig. 4c). Such performance is comparable with or even surpasses those of the traditional LDH-based electrocatalysts as well as the other OER catalysts summarized in Fig. 4d and Table S5.† The kinetics of the catalytic processes on Ir–NiCo LDH was examined by EIS tests to further illustrate the superior OER performance (Fig. S17†). Nyquist plots illustrate that Ir–NiCo LDH exhibits the smallest Rs and Rct of only 0.41 and 0.57 Ω (Table S6†). This highlights the ultrafast faradaic process, which leads to superior OER kinetics. Through systematically investigating the HER and OER activity of Ir–NiCo LDH, Ir NPs/NiCo LDH and pristine NiCo LDH, together with a series of characterization techniques including SEM, TEM, high-resolution TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EPR and XPS, there is good reason to conclude that the synergistic effects between atomic Ir and NiCo LDH contribute to providing the active sites in the Ir–NiCo LDH. The bifunctional catalytic performance of the current Ir–NiCo LDH is impressive and surpasses that of the commercial Pt/C or Ir/C catalysts, which could be ascribed to the enlarged ECSA, homogeneously dispersed state of atomic Ir with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity, promoted electrical conductivity with abundant OVs, and strong electronic coupling between Ir atoms and NiCo LDH in the Ir–NiCo LDH.

(a) Polarization curves, (b) comparison of overpotentials at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, (c) corresponding Tafel plots, and (d) comparison of the overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes between the Ir–NiCo LDH and recently reported electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions. 
Such excellent HER and OER properties of the Ir–NiCo LDH electrodes inspired us to assemble a water–alkali electrolyzer to evaluate their potential for practical overall water splitting. The overall water splitting performance was measured in a two-electrode configuration in a N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution (Fig. S18†). The Ir–NiCo LDH couple exhibits excellent performance: an extremely low cell voltage of 1.45 V can deliver a 10 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 5a). This voltage is much lower than those of the Pt/C‖Ir/C couple (1.51 V), Ir NPs/NiCo LDH couple (1.55 V), and NiCo LDH couple (1.72 V), as well as the recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts including the Co–RuIr alloy (1.52 V),50 Ir-doped NiV(OH)2 (1.49 V),20 Ni3S2/MnS (1.54 V),41 Ni/Mo2C–nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (1.64 V),51 Co–Fe oxyphosphide microtubes (1.69 V),52 NiFeRu–LDH (1.52 V),4 the iron fluoride-oxide nanoporous film (1.58 V),53 the hierarchical ZIF@LDH matrix (1.59 V),54 the Co/Ni-based mixed metal–organic nanosheet array (1.56 V)55 and Ni2Cr1–LDH (1.55 V)56 (Table S7†). To illustrate the performance of the Ir–NiCo LDH couple, a single-cell AA battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V was utilized to power the water splitting process. Considerable hydrogen and oxygen bubbles can be continuously observed on the surface of the two electrodes (Movie S1†). Furthermore, the current of this electrolyzer powered by a 1.5 V AA battery is recorded as 23.3 mA cm−2 by a multimeter (Fig. S19†), which is consistent with the polarization curve in Fig. 5a. Additionally, the long-term durability was tested by continuous operation at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5b). After 200 h, the voltage of the Pt/C‖Ir/C couple increased by a value of 198 mV, which may arise from the corrosion of the carbon support or the inadequate adherence between the powder (Pt/C or Ir/C) and NF.57 A severe voltage loss is also observed for the Ir NPs/NiCo LDH sample due to the dropping of Ir NPs from the NiCo LDH surface (Fig. S20†). By contrast, the applied voltage stays basically constant during the durability test for both NiCo LDH and Ir–NiCo LDH (only 8 mV loss for NiCo LDH and 10 mV loss for Ir–NiCo LDH). Compared with the 10 h stability for the Ru-doped NiFe–LDH and ∼15 h stability for the NiVIr LDH mentioned in the introduction, the as-prepared Ir–NiCo LDH exhibited enhanced stability for ∼200 h, which can be attributed to two reasons as follows: (1) the Ir element was in the form of single atoms individually dispersed in the lattice of Ir–NiCo LDH, whereas the state of Ru and Ir elements in the above mentioned catalysts was not studied in detail and was not clear. Single-atom Ir in the Ir–NiCo LDH is much more stable because of the strong electronic coupling between atomic Ir and NiCo LDH, which plays a critical role in enhancing the stability of the catalyst under working conditions;58 (2) abundant crystal defects such as OVs were observed due to the spontaneous galvanic displacement between NiCo LDH and the Ir precursor. The defects can alter the electronic structures and provide more efficient anchoring sites via strong interaction to directly capture and stabilize heteroatom sites, leading to the robust stability of Ir–NiCo LDH.18,59 A series of characterization techniques including SEM, TEM, high-resolution TEM, XRD and XPS were used to characterize the surface properties of the catalyst after 200 h of durability testing (Fig. S21–S23†). This showed that there was no obvious change of the surface morphology, crystal structure and electronic structure of the Ir–NiCo LDH after 200 h of HER operation, indicating the superior stability of the newly developed catalyst under HER conditions. At the same time, the morphology and crystal structure of the novel LDH catalyst were overall found to be maintained after the OER durability tests, and only the XPS Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra show a slight shift to higher binding energy, implying gradual deeper oxidation of the elements during long-term OER aging. The faradaic efficiency of the Ir–NiCo LDH couple for overall water splitting was evaluated (Fig. S24†). We found that the amount ratio of H2 and O2 evolved from the electrolyzer was close to 2:1, and the faradaic efficiency was determined to be nearly 100% during the 90 min water electrolysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that our rational design and fabrication of Ir–NiCo LDH is effective to synthesize a robust bifunctional catalyst toward overall water splitting.

(c) Polarization curves for overall water splitting using the Ir–NiCo LDH electrode as both the anode and cathode (blue curve) and the three series-connected ordinary single crystal Si solar cells (black curve), and (d) time-dependent current output during continuous overall water splitting. 
Finally, the capability of the Ir–NiCo LDH catalyst for solar-driven water splitting was investigated. Three series-connected ordinary solar cells were applied as the power source and provide an open circuit voltage (Voc) of about 1.76 V (Fig. S25†). The polarization curves of the Ir–NiCo LDH couple and three series-connected ordinary single crystal Si solar cells intersected at 12.0 mA cm−2 under simulated 1-sun illumination (Fig. 5c). Therefore, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (ηSTH) of this system was calculated to reach 14.8%. Such an efficiency is impressive and surpasses that of the Ir NPs/NiCo LDH couple (13.2%), Pt/C‖Ir/C couple (11.8) and all of the recent state-of-the-art analogous systems using ordinary Si solar cells as the power source (Fig. S26 and Table S8†). Under chopped light illumination without any applied bias support, the photocurrent of this solar-driven water-splitting device was recorded. As shown in Fig. 5d, a photocurrent density of ∼12.0 mA cm−2 is achieved, which is well correlated with the results presented in Fig. 5c. Furthermore, the current density shows no decay after continuous testing for 50 h. For a better comparison, the photocurrent of solar-driven water-splitting devices based on Ir NPs/NiCo LDH and the Pt/C‖Ir/C couple under chopped illumination were provided (Fig. S27†). By contrast, a severe photocurrent loss was observed for both Ir NPs/NiCo LDH and the Pt/C‖Ir/C couple. These results manifest the feasibility of adopting the Ir–NiCo LDH as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency and durability for overall water splitting.
Conclusion
In summary, we reported a facile and efficient approach for the fabrication of Ir–NiCo LDH on NF as a significantly active and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall alkaline water splitting. The as-prepared Ir–NiCo LDH exhibited excellent catalytic properties with a HER overpotential of 21 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and an OER overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Given the above impressive activity, the Ir–NiCo LDH couple can be easily powered by a 1.5 V single-cell AA battery. Such a water–alkali electrolyzer exhibited an extremely low voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mA cm−2 with a sustainable stability for more than 200 h, ranking the best as compared to NiCo LDH, Ir NPs/NiCo LDH, the Pt/C‖Ir/C couple and other recently reported bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, by integrating the Ir–NiCo LDH couple with Si solar cells, the solar-driven water splitting system demonstrated a high ηSTH of 14.8%, which hits a record among recent state-of-the-art analogous systems using ordinary Si solar cells as the power source. Such a remarkable performance of the Ir–NiCo LDH could be ascribed to the doping of Ir into the LDH lattice, which not only facilitated their synergistic effects in the HER/OER processes, but also afforded a large electrochemically active surface area and improved electrical conductivity. This work opens up an avenue for designing cost-effective, highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for challenging energy conversion technologies.
