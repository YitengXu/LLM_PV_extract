The hierarchical thin film of CuInS2 has been reported for the first time to display excellent catalytic activity as a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells, and a power conversion efficiency of 4.8% is achieved.
Multi-compound semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their excellent optical and electronic properties in the past few years.1–7 Among these materials, chalcopyrite semiconductors have been important and alternative photovoltaic materials for fabricating thin-film solar cells because of their direct and appreciable band gaps and a high absorption coefficient of more than 105 cm−1.8–12 Moreover, chalcopyrite semiconductor quantum dots are excellent candidates for biological imaging and light emitting diodes due to their low toxicity compared to Cd-based quantum dots and high photoluminescence quantum yield as a result of forming a core–shell nanostructure.13–19 However, there have been few studies on catalytic activity of chalcopyrite semiconductors up to now.20–26 Especially, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the investigation of chalcopyrite semiconductors as counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells.
An ideal counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells should possess high catalytic activity and high conductivity. The catalytic activity of a counter electrode can be improved by altering the nanostructure of the material surface. The films with smooth surfaces as counter electrodes have strong reflection, leading to a low light harvesting efficiency. However, the hierarchical nanostructure films with a large surface area can increase the optical path to capture photons.27–29 The architecture in films provides multiple channels to transfer the carriers from their surface to the conducting substrate directly, which gives rise to the increase in the catalytic activity of materials. Therefore, it is required to design materials with hierarchical nanostructure for improving their electrocatalytic activity.
In this paper, a facile solvothermal method is presented to synthesize nearly-monodispersed CuInS2 (CIS) nanopompons and hierarchical nanostructure films using a novel precursor solution. The precursor solution only containing Cu2O, In(OH)3, thioaceticacid, and ammonia results in high-quality products without introducing any impure elements (for example, halide ions from precursors of metal halides etc.). It might be a universal method that is applied to synthesize the nanocrystals and thin films of other chalcopyrite semiconductors. CIS nanoflake films on molybdenum substrates are first exploited as counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The power conversion efficiency reached up to 4.8%, indicating that nanoflake films have excellent catalytic activity as counter electrodes in DSSCs.
The synthetic route to the CIS nanopompons and nanoflake films via a solvothermal method is shown in Fig. 1. The clear red precursor solution (Fig. 1a) was prepared from 0.2 mmol Cu2O, 0.4 mmol In(OH)3, 0.8 mmol polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2 ml thioaceticacid, and 1 ml ammonia in 16 ml anhydrous ethanol, which is favorable to form uniform nanopompons without introducing any impurities. A black ink consisting of CIS nanopompons was obtained from the clear red precursor solution heated in a Teflon autoclave at 150 °C for 6 hours (Fig. 1b). The uniform and compact CIS nanoflake film was obtained from the same precursor solution without polyvinylpyrrolidone when a molybdenum substrate was placed into the Teflon autoclave (Fig. 1c). CIS nanopompons have wool-like surface morphology and uniform size with an average diameter of 423 nm (Fig. 1d and e). The top layer of the CIS film is composed of interconnected nanoflakes (Fig. 1f). The cross-section of the nanoflake film shows a clear tri-layer structure (Fig. 1g). The middle layer with a thickness of ∼1 μm is a compact CIS layer above a layer of ∼970 nm molybdenum. The CIS nanoflake layer with a thickness of ∼330 nm located in the top layer. The CIS nanoflakes provide multiple channels to transfer the carriers from their surface to the conducting molybdenum substrate. The hierarchical structure of thin films increases the optical path to capture photons efficiently. Such a porous architecture endows a large surface area for sufficient light harvest in optoelectronic applications.

The phase purities of CIS nanopompons and the nanoflake film were confirmed by XRD patterns of CIS (Fig. 2a), which are indexed to the chalcopyrite (JCPDS no. 15-0681) diffraction pattern. Diffraction peaks of CIS nanopompons at 2θ = 28.4°, 46.9° and 55.4° correspond to (112), (220) and (312) planes of tetragonal CIS structure. While diffraction peaks of the CIS nanoflake film are at 2θ = 28.1°, 46.6° and 55.3°, displaying a left shift compared with diffraction peaks of CIS nanopompons. In addition, full width at half maximum of the CIS nanoflake film is smaller than that of CIS nanopompons because of their larger grain size and better crystallinity. The diffraction peak of the molybdenum substrate is at 2θ = 40.6°. No other diffraction peaks of impurity phases such as copper sulfides and indium sulfides are observed in the XRD patterns of CIS nanopompons and the nanoflake film.

The UV-vis absorbance spectra of the CIS nanoflake film on a FTO substrate and CIS nanopompons are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The band gaps of the CIS nanoflake film and nanopompons are 1.40 eV and 1.47 eV obtained by plotting (αhν)2, the square of the absorption coefficient α multiplied by the photon energy hν, versus hν as shown in the inset of Fig. 2b and Fig. S12 (ESI†). Chemical compositions (Cu, In, S) of nanopompons and the nanoflake film, examined by EDS analyses, are 1.08:0.87:2.05, as depicted in Fig. 2c. The chemical states and compositions of three elements in CIS films were confirmed by XPS (Fig. S2, ESI†) to indicate that the nanoflakes are composed of CuInS2. The Raman peak of the CIS nanoflake film locates at 294 cm−1 (Fig. 2d), consistent with the reported results.30–32
In order to study the multiscale microstructure of nanopompons and nanoflake films, we performed TEM measurements. An individual CIS nanopompon consists of numerous nanoflakes, which are surrounded by a lot of nanocrystals as shown in Fig. 3a. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of the nanopompon indicates that it has a polycrystalline structure, as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). However, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that the framework of the nanopompon is a monocrystalline nanoflake, as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). An interplanar spacing of 3.25 Å was observed, which corresponds to the (112) plane of tetragonal CIS (Fig. 3b). The interconnected CIS nanoflakes form the network nanostructure with ∼43 nm thickness (Fig. 3c). TEM of scratched CIS films displays a nanoflake morphology (Fig. 3d), consistent with the result of FESEM. The nanoflake consists of many nanocrystals with an average diameter of 7.5 nm (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The nanoflakes are polycrystalline, which are different from those in nanopompons (Fig. S4b, ESI†).

The electrocatalytic activity of CIS films was investigated. The thin films with hierarchical nanostructure can capture more light and provide numerous transport channels to improve the electrochemical activity. As shown in Fig. 4a, the cyclic voltammogram of a CIS electrode displays obvious potential peaks, similar to that of a Pt electrode. The photocurrent–voltage curves of dye-sensitized solar cells with Pt and CIS nanoflake films on molybdenum as counter electrodes are shown in Fig. 4b. As a result, the two DSSCs show nearly the same Voc, 749 and 751 mV respectively. The Jsc and FF of the DSSC with Pt as a counter electrode (11.3 mA cm−1 and 69.2%) are larger than the Jsc and FF of the DSSC with the CIS hierarchical thin film as a counter electrode (10.2 mA cm−1 and 52.7%). The efficiencies of two DSSCs are 6.9% and 4.8%, respectively (Fig. 4b). It is obvious that the thin film with a hierarchical nanostructure shows excellent electrocatalytic activity. Linear sweep voltammetry (Fig. S5a, ESI†) was implemented to investigate the correlation between current density and applied potential of the CIS electrode in the dark and under illumination (>420 nm), and the corresponding photocurrent response to on–off light cycles of the CIS electrode is shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†). Evidently, the steady photocurrent generation was obtained in the presence of a light source.

In summary, a facile method to synthesize nearly-monodispersed CIS nanopompons and nanoflake films is presented using a uniform precursor solution, which provides a novel route for the synthesis of other metal sulfides and their films simultaneously in the future. The hierarchical CIS films with large surface areas are formed by interconnecting CIS nanoflakes. The nanostructure consisting of nanoflakes as channels to transport photocarriers can capture more light to generate the maximum amount of photocarriers, which leads to an increase in the catalytic activity. CIS nanoflake films on molybdenum are exploited as a counter electrode material of DSSCs for the first time. The DSSC with a power conversion efficiency of 4.8% demonstrated the excellent catalytic activity of CIS nanoflake films.
