    , Accepted 24th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractIn recent years, there has been an unprecedented rise in the research of halide perovskites because of their important optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors and lasers. The most pressing question concerns the stability of these materials. Here faster degradation and PL quenching are observed at higher iodine content for mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 nanocrystals, and a simple yet effective method is reported to significantly enhance their stability. After selective etching with acetone, surface iodine is partially etched away to form a bromine-rich surface passivation layer on mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals. This passivation layer remarkably stabilizes the nanocrystals, making their PL intensity improved by almost three orders of magnitude. It is expected that a similar passivation layer can also be applied to various other kinds of perovskite materials with poor stability issues.
Introduction
Halide perovskites MPbX3 (M = CH3NH3, NH2CHNH2, Cs; X = Cl, Br, I) have recently attracted significant attention as absorbers for solar cells with the power conversion efficiency reaching 20%.1–4 Besides their great success in photovoltaic cells,5,6 halide perovskites particularly all-inorganic caesium halide perovskites (CsPbX3) in colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit surprisingly high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) reaching 90% with a narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 10 to 20 nm.7–11 Halide perovskite NCs have many unique advantages in the PL property compared with the traditional cadmium chalcogenide quantum dots.12–14 First, CsPbX3 NCs demonstrate a large tolerance to size and size distribution. The peak position and FWHM of CsPbBr3 NCs (excitonic Bohr diameter ∼7 nm) with the edge length from 8 to 11 nm are almost identical.7 On the contrary, the optical gap of CdSe-based QDs is very sensitive to size (blue to red when the diameter changes from 2 to 5 nm) and they show a strong PL intensity only when their sizes are comparable to the excitonic Bohr diameter. This results into the problems of PL broadening and batch-to-batch reproducibility. Second, CsPbX3 NCs are less sensitive to surface dangling bonds. Directly synthesized CsPbX3 NCs exhibit as high as 90% PL efficiency, which is superior to most CdSe-based QDs even after surface modification and passivation.13 Third, CsPbX3 NCs with blue and green emitting light are readily prepared by tuning the ratio of mixed halides.15–17 The corresponding CdSe QDs at these wavelengths show reduced chemical and photostability. Fourth, CsPbX3 NCs have a much larger absorption cross section than that of CdSe QDs. To achieve similar brightness, the excitation light density for a single perovskite NC can be decreased by almost 2 orders of magnitude.18,19 All these features make halide perovskite NCs amazing emitting materials in the applications of LEDs,20–23 lasing,24–27 and photodetectors.28–30
The stability of halide perovskite NCs is a remaining issue.31–33 All-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 NCs were expected to exhibit much higher stability than their methylamine (MA) analogues, due to the hygroscopic and thermally unstable nature of the organic component.15,34–36 Recently, CsPbBr3 has been widely reported to display outstanding optical properties with good chemical stability, holding huge potential in future photodetectors and LEDs.22 However, its iodine-rich counterparts (CsPbI3 or CsPb(BrxI1−x)3) are quite unstable. Lead halide perovskites undergo three phase transitions, where the cubic phase is the energetically stable crystallographic phase at elevated temperatures and exhibits the highest PL QY. Both CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 crystallize in the cubic phase, while CsPbI3 still exists in the tetragonal or orthorhombic phase at room temperature.37 This suggests that the desired highly-luminescent CsPbI3 cubic phase is less stable at room temperature. To achieve emission spectra tunable in a complete visible region, especially the red region for practical applications, it is essential to synthesize iodine-rich perovskite NCs with stable PL intensity. However, the structural stability of these materials has been largely underexplored until very recently. Due to the relatively high stability of CsPbBr3, we hypothesize that a thin CsPbBr3 protection layer might greatly enhance the structural and optical stability of CsPbI3. However, the synthesis of CsPbI3@CsPbBr3 core–shell structures remains a big challenge because fast anion-exchange could easily be performed between I and Br to form a homogenous solid solution via either one-step reactions7 or sequential reactions.16
Here, we report a selective acetone-etching method to form a passivation layer on iodine-rich perovskite NCs to significantly enhance their stability. The high quality CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 perovskite NCs were synthesized by modifying the hot-injecting method reported by Kovalenko's group. PbBr2/PbI2 with a desired ratio was solubilized in octadecene (ODE) with oleic acid and oleylamine, and then cesium oleate was injected at 170 °C to form NCs. After precipitation with acetone, the PL intensity of the NCs can withstand several months of storage in a nonpolar solvent, with respect to only several days after washing with ethanol. XRD analysis confirms the great stability enhancement through acetone washing. Furthermore, a combination of atomic-resolution high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging38 and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis39 on a state-of-art aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)40 with a Super EDS system is used to demonstrate the iodine content decreases on the surface of the nanocrystal washed with acetone. It is suggested that surface iodine is partially etched away to form a bromine-rich passivation layer (Fig. 1), which dramatically increases the stability of the mixed halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs.

Results and discussion
As a typical washing technique, an antisolvent such as ethanol or acetone is added to destabilize the colloidal suspension and precipitate the NCs. It is necessary to select a suitable antisolvent to precipitate perovskite NCs while minimizing the corresponding damage to the nanocrystal surface. And multiple washing rounds would result in the agglomeration and fusion of NCs.41 To diminish these effects, we fixed our purification procedure. The perovskite NCs were precipitated by the antisolvent with a volume ratio of 1:1 to original dispersion, collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and finally re-dispersed into 5 mL cyclohexane. After a single ethanol-wash, the PL peak position of CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs does not shift compared to the samples without washing (Fig. 2a). This suggests that a single ethanol wash introduces little structural change to the perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs. Very interestingly, the PL properties of the iodine-rich perovskite NCs washed with acetone are remarkably different from that washed with ethanol. Fig. 2a shows that acetone wash completely quenches the bright PL and physically degrades the CsPbI3 NCs as verified by the XRD results (ESI Fig. S1†), while ethanol wash can maintain their PL peak position and high QY at least for several hours. In the case of CsPbBr3 NCs, both acetone and ethanol work as appropriate antisolvents to precipitate NCs with no PL peak position change. These differences indicate that acetone specially reacts with iodine perovskite NCs but has little effect on bromine NCs. For mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 (x = 0.2) NCs, the PL peak blue-shifts around 10 nm after acetone washing (Fig. 2a). In fact, this blue shift occurs within a wide x value range from 0.2 to 0.8 (Fig. S2†). As long as x is smaller than 0.2, the dark red NC dispersion quickly changes to pale yellow with a dramatic PL quenching after acetone washing; when x is larger than 0.8, the shift is not very obvious. Other antisolvents such as methanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, and methyl-ethyl ketone were carefully tested to precipitate the colloidal suspension (Fig. S3†). Among them, we observed that all alcohols seem to have little influence on the PL peak position of iodine-rich perovskite NCs. Methyl-ethyl ketone degrades the CsPbI3 NCs and blue-shifts the PL spectra of mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs, the same as acetone does. Therefore, we assume that the carbonyl functional group should have some reaction with ionic iodine in perovskite NCs. This reaction leads to the complete PL quenching for CsPbI3 NCs and the spectra blue-shift for mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs.

Fig. 2b and S4† show the XPS spectra of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 4d and Br 3d for mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs (x = 0.2) after acetone and ethanol washing. The data demonstrate that the Br/I ratio is around 0.24 after ethanol washing, which is close to the stoichiometry. This ratio increases to 0.67 after acetone washing, implying a relatively Br-rich surface. The obvious Br/I ratio change is attributed to the reaction between the carbonyl group and ionic iodine in the perovskite NCs: surface iodine in mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs would be partially etched away by the solvent with the carbonyl functional group.
More interestingly, acetone-washing can greatly enhance the stability of mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs. It is known that faster degradation and PL quenching were observed at higher iodine content for hybrid organic–inorganic (MAPbX3 or FAPbX3) perovskites.15,32,36,42 We found a similar trend in CsPbX3 NCs. When the content of iodine is larger than that of bromine, the CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs easily degrade and lose their bright PL. Fig. 3a shows that the cyclohexane dispersion of mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 (x = 0.2, ethanol wash, λex = 669 nm) quickly changes from dark red to pale yellow and its strong PL is dramatically reduced in two days. We note it as Sample 2 for simplification. In contrast, acetone washing prevents the degradation of the samples. After 10 days and even longer, the dispersion is still stable and maintains the high PL efficiency (sample 1, λex = 656 nm). To further understand this stabilizing mechanism, we prepared other CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs with a x value of 0.3 and washed with ethanol (sample 3, λex = 645 nm), which has a slightly larger Br/I ratio than sample 1 and sample 2. Sample 3 does exhibit better stability than sample 2 due to the smaller content of iodine. It is clearly observed that sample 1 has much superior PL stability to sample 3 although it contains less iodine; highly effective acetone washing should play a critical role in stabilizing the mixed-halide perovskite NCs. In order to better quantify the rate of decomposition, the emission integral area of the three samples was plotted against time (Fig. 3b). Defining τ1/2 as the point at which the emission integral area is halfway corresponding to its initial (100%) value, τ1/2 is around 20 h and 23 h for sample 2 and sample 3 respectively, both washed with ethanol. For the acetone-treated sample 1, the PL quenching is significantly slow. Extrapolation of a linear fit of the data suggests that τ1/2 is about 17500 hours, showing that the PL stability has been improved by almost three orders of magnitude. The corresponding XRD patterns along with the time confirm the different structural stabilities of the three samples (Fig. 3c). Sample 1 maintains a stable cubic phase at room temperature after 10 days. In comparison, samples 2 and 3 cannot maintain their cubic phase and quickly change to the orthorhombic phase in several days. Since the only difference between samples 1 and 2 is the selection of antisolvents and sample 3 has even less iodine content than sample 1, we assume that acetone wash plays a key role in passivating the surface of iodine-rich perovskite NCs, and therefore remarkably improves their stabilities.

To investigate the compositional change at the surface induced by acetone washing, a combination of atomic resolved STEM imaging and EDS elemental mapping analysis is carried out. Fig. 4 shows the typical TEM images of samples 1 and 2 with the average diameter of 13.6 and 13.4 nm respectively, which indicates that there is no obvious size-difference for perovskite NCs after washing with ethanol and acetone. A low magnification STEM-HAADF image in Fig. 5a shows the morphology and uniformity of sample 1 (CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs, x = 0.2, acetone wash). A typical atomic-resolution STEM-HAADF image of a single NC is shown in Fig. 5b. The atomic columns are clearly resolved and the measured lattice parameter of 6.450 Å is in good agreement with the results of the XRD analysis (Fig. 3c). The well-defined reflections exhibited in the corresponding Fourier transform power spectrum (inset in Fig. 5b) can be directly indexed as the (100), (200), (110) and (220) planes with the [001] orientation using a cubic perovskite structure. Furthermore, 2D STEM-EDS mapping analysis with high resolution was carried out to study the elemental distributions of I and Br on the NC surface (Fig. 5c and d). Line profiles of atomic percentages of I (red) and Br (green) as shown in Fig. 5e are extracted by summing the signals vertically in the mappings in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. The blue line represents the Br/I atomic ratio. Note that the X-ray counts of Br and I collected at the outside of the NC are very low resulting in large errors in the calculation of the Br/I atomic ratio, the data points of atomic percent (blue) at positions beyond the edge of NC (>12 nm) are not shown. It is clear to see in Fig. 5e that I and Br were not evenly distributed in the NC. The atomic ratio of Br/I in the center of the nanoparticle is about 0.25, consistent with their stoichiometric ratio. It increases when the position is close to the surface and reaches the maximum of 0.75 on the very edge of the cube, about three times the stoichiometric Br/I ratio. This surface Br/I ratio agrees well with our XPS data (Fig. 2b). Therefore, we can further verify that acetone can partially etch iodine away from the NC surface, forming a Br-rich self-passivation layer on mixed-halide perovskite NCs. As a result, this passivation layer dramatically increases the stability of the NCs, whose PL stability can be improved by about three orders of magnitude.

Experimental
Materials
Cs2CO3 (Aladdin, 99.9%), octadecene (ODE, Aladdin, 90%), oleic acid (OA, Aladdin, 90%, AR), PbBr2 (Aladdin, 99.0%), PbI2 (Aladdin, 98.0%), oleylamine (OAm, Aladdin, 80–90%), cyclohexane (Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, ≥99.7%, AR), acetone (Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, ≥99.5%, AR), and ethanol (Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, ≥99.7%, AR). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis method
Cs2CO3 (0.407 g) was loaded into a 50 mL three-neck flask along with octadecene (20 mL, ODE) and oleic acid (1.25 mL). The mixture was degassed for 0.5 h at 120 °C, and then heated to 150 °C under N2 to form a clear solution. In another flask, ODE (5 mL) and PbX2 (0.188 mmol) (a mixture of PbI2 and PbBr2 with a desired molar ratio) were loaded along with oleylamine (1 mL) and oleic acid (0.5 mL). The mixture was then heated to 120 °C under vacuum, followed by a nitrogen gas flow when the temperature reaches 120 °C. (Caution: A long degas time may cause failure of the experiment.) After complete solubilisation of a PbX2 salt, the temperature was raised to 150 °C, followed by a quick injection of Cs-oleate solution (0.5 mL, prepared as described above). The reaction was stopped after 5 seconds with an ice-water bath. After the dispersion of perovskite NCs was cooled down to 50 °C, an antisolvent such as ethanol or acetone with the volume ratio of 1:1 to original dispersion was added to precipitate perovskite NCs. The resulting NCs were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min, and then re-dispersed into 10 mL cyclohexane. Finally, the dispersion was centrifuged again (8000 rpm, 1 min) to remove a tiny amount of heavy residues. All the samples for later characterization were purified by such a single washing step, unless otherwise specified.
Characterization
Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, a home-made fiber fluorimeter system, a compact spectrometer purchased from Thorlabs, or a Horiba PTI QuantaMaster 400 steadystate fluorescence system at room temperature. UV-Vis spectra of perovskite NCs were obtained by using a probe-type Ocean Optics HR2000CG-UV-NIR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an achromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) and a double pass cylindrical mirror analyzer (ULVAC-PHI 5000 VersaProbe). The atomic ratios were obtained from the ratios of the XPS peak areas of the high-resolution spectra corrected by sensitivity factors from the literature. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed using a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Atomic resolution STEM-HAADF images and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps were acquired using a double-corrected FEI Titan3 Cubed G2 60–300 equipped with Super EDS detectors. To alleviate beam damage, a low accelerating voltage of 60 kV was employed.
Conclusions
In summary, the stability of perovskite CsPbX3 NCs is highly related to the different halide components. Faster degradation occurs at higher iodine content for mixed halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs. A selective acetone-etching method is developed to dramatically enhance the stability of mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs. Acetone can partially etch away surface iodine and form a bromine-rich passivation layer on the NCs, improving the PL stability by almost 3 orders of magnitude. Future studies with this surface passivation strategy will concentrate on the more detailed mechanism and potential extensions to other perovskite materials, such as MAPbX3 and tin-based perovskites. This facile strategy should be highly encouraging from the perspective of device stability.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the self-passivation layer formation on a mixed-halide perovskite NC after acetone etching.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Normalized emission spectra of mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs after no washing, washing with ethanol and acetone with x = 1, x = 0.2 and x = 0. (b) XPS spectra of perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 (x = 0.2) NCs after washing with ethanol and acetone.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Colloidal solution in cyclohexane of different perovskite NCs CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 under normal light (left column) and UV light (right column). Left one: sample 1, x = 0.2, washed with acetone; middle one: sample 2, x = 0.2, washed with ethanol; and right one: sample 3, x = 0.3, washed with ethanol. (b) PL intensity as a function of time after storing the corresponding CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs in cyclohexane under ambient conditions. (c) Normalized XRD patterns of the corresponding CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs after storing for different times. The lines at the bottom of the figure are the reference positions for CsPbI3 in the cubic (black line, ICSD: 181288) and orthorhombic (red line, ICSD: 027979) phases.	 

 	Fig. 4  Typical TEM images of CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 (x = 0.2) perovskite NCs with measured size distributions. (a, b) Washed with ethanol; (c, d) washed with acetone.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) STEM-HAADF image of CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 NCs (x = 0.2, washed with acetone). (b) Atomic-resolution STEM-HAADF image of a single NC with its corresponding Fourier transform power spectrum (inset). (c, d) Iodine and bromine mapping of the NC indicated by the yellow rectangle in Fig. 3b. (e) Atomic percentage profiles of iodine (red) and bromine (green) calculated from the summing of the signals vertically in the mappings in (c) and (d), respectively. Atomic ratio of Br/I is shown in the blue curve.
