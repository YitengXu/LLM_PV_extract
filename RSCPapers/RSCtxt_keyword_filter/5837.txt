    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 4th December 2019AbstractIn this study, a new p-type π-conjugated ladder-like polymer, poly(3,3′-(((2-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzol[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-1,4-phenylene)bis(oxy))bis(hexane-6,1-diyl))bis(1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane)) (P-Si), has been designed for SnO2-based perovskite solar cells. Our investigation reveals that this π-conjugated ladder-like polymer system decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains and siloxane chains is likely the reason for the improvement in the surface morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films, leading to reduced defect states and enhanced device stability. In addition, P-Si with a suitable highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (−5.41 eV) can act as a hole transport medium between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD to enhance the excellent hole transportation. As a result, power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 21.5% with 21.3% steady-state PCE was achieved. Typically, the device with P-Si can retain 98% of the original average PCE after being stored in an ambient environment with 20% relative humidity for 120 days, indicating its good long-term stability. Furthermore, after aging for 100 h under illumination at the maximum power point in a nitrogen atmosphere, the P-Si modified device retains over 98% of its initial performance.
Introduction
In the past few years, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have received widespread attention as promising photovoltaic materials due to their outstanding photoelectric properties. So far, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.8% to 25.2%, comparable to those of CuInxGa(1−x)Se2 and CdTe solar cells and even polycrystalline silicon solar cells.1–5 Despite the rapid development, the commercialization of PSCs still faces challenges due to unsatisfactory stability (i.e. thermal, humidity and electrical field stabilities).6 Stability issues of PSCs are remarkably related to the perovskite material. The perovskite films are generally prepared by solution-processed methods, such as one-step spin coating, sequential deposition and vapor assisted solution process.7–9 However, these solution-processed polycrystalline perovskite films indeed contain lots of defects at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs). Many research studies have proven that both morphologies and defects at the surface and GBs of polycrystalline perovskite films are crucial to high-performance perovskite devices.10–16 On the one hand, the morphology of the perovskite film is mainly determined by the nucleation and crystal growth processes. On the other hand, electronic trap states resulting from pinholes, crystal defects and GBs will limit lateral carrier diffusion, reduce carrier lifetime and cause ion diffusion and migration, thus reducing the device efficiency and stability. Therefore, controlling perovskite film morphologies and passivating defects from the surface and GBs within perovskite films become important.
Numerous strategies such as thermal treatment, solvent engineering and additive engineering have been widely used for high-quality perovskite films.17–20 In particular, various additives such as alkali metal cations (i.e. Li+, Na+, and K+), ionic liquids, graphdiyne and polymers have been incorporated into the precursor solution to manipulate the nucleation and growth processes of perovskite films and passivate trap states.21–26 Amongst them, highly hydrophobic polymers can well passivate trap states of the perovskites and effectively protect perovskite films from moisture invasion. For example, Grätzel et al. introduced insulating poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) into anti-solvent chlorobenzene (CB) to facilitate much faster heterogeneous nucleation of perovskite crystals, thus resulting in smooth perovskite films with fewer defects and larger oriented grains.24 Meng et al. employed polystyrene capping perovskite grains to stabilize the perovskite component and microstructure to improve the stability of PSCs.25 Besides insulating polymers, some organic semiconducting polymers, regardless of p-type or n-type properties, have also been successfully introduced into PSCs due to their diverse functional groups with lone pair electrons, which can effectively passivate trap states of the perovskite film or have high electron/hole affinity and electron/hole mobility, thus promoting the electron/hole extraction and electron/hole transport.27–31 Li et al. prepared a p-type π-conjugated polymer (PBDB-T) to passivate trap states through the formation of Lewis adducts between lead and oxygen atoms in PBDB-T.28 Ma et al. designed fluorinated polymers to improve the stability of PSCs, which exhibited 18.7% PCE.32 Although these investigations demonstrated that incorporating polymeric semiconductors into anti-solvents is a promising method for improving PSC performance, the cell performance is still unsatisfactory and more in-depth studies on the underlying mechanism are required.
In this respect, a new p-type π-conjugated ladder-like polymer, poly(3,3′-(((2-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzol[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-1,4-phenylene)bis(oxy))bis(hexane-6,1-diyl))bis(1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane)) (P-Si), has been designed. It is found that the introduction of a small amount of P-Si (0.1 mg ml−1) in anti-solvent CB can improve the surface morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films. PCE as high as 21.5% with 21.3% steady-state PCE has been achieved for SnO2-based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device exhibits good long-term stability, and can retain 98% of the initial average PCE after being stored in an ambient environment with 20% relative humidity (RH) for 120 days. Furthermore, the device also exhibits good opto-electronic stability after being aged for 100 h under a full AM 1.5 sun-equivalent white LED illumination at the maximum power point (MPP) in a nitrogen atmosphere, in comparison to the control groups (98% vs. 70% of their initial PCEs). It is revealed that this π-conjugated polymer system decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains and siloxane chains is likely to be distributed on the surface and GBs of perovskite films to enlarge grain sizes of the perovskite, improve film conductivity for better charge transfer, reduce defect states and enhance cell performance and stability.

Methanol, acetone and hexane were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. Unless stated otherwise, solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and were used without further purification.
Synthesis of P-Si
A pre-dried 100 ml flask was charged with (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (120 mg) and 3,3′-(((2,5-dibromo-1,4-phenylene)bis(oxy))bis(hexane-6,1-diyl))bis(1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane) (116.37 mg). The flask was successively evacuated and refilled with nitrogen for 3 cycles. Then, toluene (10 ml) and DMF (2 ml) were added, and the mixture was purged with nitrogen for 10 min. After the addition of Pd(PPh3)4 (7.67 mg), purging for another 30 min was conducted. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 48 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the crude product was collected by precipitating from methanol. The solid was rinsed in a Soxhlet extractor with methanol, acetone and hexane, successively. The solution in hexane was concentrated, and then precipitated in methanol. The polymer was obtained after drying at a reduced pressure (47.9 mg; yield: 27.84%; Mn: 23308; PDI: 1.8).
Device fabrication
Laser-patterned ITO glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω per square) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of soap water, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 30 min each, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 15 min. The precursor solution for perovskite films was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (1.32 M), PbBr2 (0.12 M), FAI (1.08 M), MAI (0.24 M) and MABr (0.12 M) in DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v = 4:1) and stirred overnight at room temperature. A thin SnO2 layer was spin coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate using a SnO2 colloidal dispersion solution in water (6.18%) at 5000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in an ambient atmosphere.[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA, 0.1 mg ml−1) in CB was spin-coated on the top of the SnO2 film.33 P-Si was dissolved in CB with various concentrations (0.0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg ml−1). The perovskite film was spin coated by an anti-solvent one-step method in an N2 atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the SnO2 layer and spin coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. 120 μl CB was poured onto the substrate at 15 s during the high-speed stage. Then the half-crystallization film was heated at 150 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 10 min and at 100 °C in a vacuum for 40 min. On the top of the perovskite film, a 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s followed by heating for 10 min at 60 °C. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD in CB (60 mM) with Li-TFSI, FK209 and TBP additives at doping molar ratios of 0.5, 0.03 and 3.3. Here, different P-Si concentrations were adopted when P-Si acted as different function layers. For the device based on P-Si as the hole transport layer (Device A), P-Si concentrations in CB ranged from 0 to 20 mg ml−1, while for the device modified with P-Si (Device B), the P-Si concentrations in CB ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg ml−1. To form the P-Si layer, the P-Si solution was poured on the top of the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then heated at 60 °C for 10 min. For Device B, another 200 nm-thickness spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited by spin-coating on the top of the P-Si film at 3500 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 60 °C for 10 min. Finally, 80 nm thick Au electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation at an atmospheric pressure of 10−7 Torr (Kurt J. Lesker).
Characterization
Atomic force microscope (AFM) images were obtained on a MultiMode 8 SPM. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using an FEI-SEM (XL 30 S-FEG). Absorption spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-2550 measured from 300 to 850 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα as the radiation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250X). Constant temperature and humidity decay measurements were obtained at 60 °C under a relative humidity (RH) of 60% in a humidity chamber (KCL-1000) from EYELA. Contact angles were measured using an OCA25 from DataPhysics. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a TENSOR 27 spectrometer from Bruker. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired on a PL spectrometer (FLS 900, Edinburgh Instruments), excited with a picosecond-pulsed diode laser (EPL-445) and measured at 550 nm after excitation. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a Keithley 2602 source meter under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from an Oriel Solar Simulator (91192). An active area of 0.1 cm2 was defined for solar cells by using a black mask. Reverse scanning J–V curves were used in this work with a scan speed of 30 mV s−1. Transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) spectra were obtained using our lab-made setup, in which the cell was excited with a 532 nm pulsed laser (Brio, 20 Hz, 4 ns) and the photovoltage decay process was recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 7104). The devices were taken out for EQE measurements using an Enli Tech (Taiwan) EQE measurement system.34
Results and discussion
In our study, a hydrophobic p-type π-conjugated ladder-like polymer with an average molecular weight (Mn) of ∼23000 (see Fig. S1†), the so-called P-Si, has been designed. Its synthetic route is shown in Fig. 1a, and detailed synthesis and purification procedures are provided in the Experimental section. Here, benzodithiophene and bis(alkyloxy)benzene as building blocks were employed to construct the P-Si. Note that intramolecular S–O interaction can lock the conformation of polymer backbones to form ladder-like structures.35,36 The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was adopted to determine the hole mobility of P-Si, based on the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/hole transport material (HTM)/Au. In terms of the Mott–Gurney law, the hole mobility of P-Si is found to be 1.21 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 by fitting the curve in Fig. 1b, better than that of spiro-OMeTAD (2.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).36 The relatively high hole mobility is probably due to (1) the large π conjugation structure, and (2) the fact that the flat conformation of the polymer backbone can be stabilized by the intramolecular S–O interaction and be further packed closely, which is beneficial for hole transportation with the aid of the alkyl thienyl conjugated side chains. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement shows that the decomposition temperature of P-Si is 395 °C, indicating its good thermal stability (Fig. 1c). Previous research has shown that the presence of siloxane-terminated groups not only enhances the solubility of the conjugated polymers for solution processing, but also improves the hole mobility of the conjugated polymer material.37–39

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were further employed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of P-Si. According to the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 1d, two peaks located at 501 and 535 nm are found for P-Si at room temperature. When the testing temperature is increased, the absorption line of P-Si solution becomes narrower and blue-shifted, indicating that aggregated polymer chains can be dissociated at an elevated temperature in the CB solution. Compared with UV-vis spectra in the solution, the absorption peaks of the P-Si film are broader and red-shifted, indicating that the P-Si film is more easily aggregated, which is able to improve the hole mobility of P-Si. The optical bandgap of P-Si is determined to be 2.01 eV using the equation Eg,opt = 1240/λlonset. With the aid of the CV curve with Fc/Fc+ as the internal standard, the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of P-Si are −5.41 and −3.34 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1e. Comparable to the energy level of the perovskite, the P-Si is firstly employed as a hole transporting material in our work, and the device configuration is ITO/SnO2(20 nm)/PCBA-(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x (600 nm)/HTM/Au. Unsatisfactory cell performance of Device A is obtained in a wide P-Si concentration range from 0.05 to 20 mg mL−1, and the average efficiency is only 16% based on 10 mg mL−1 P-Si, lower than that of the corresponding spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, as shown in Fig. S2a and b.† Here, considering carrier lifetimes of glass/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (or P-Si) by fitting time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (35.02 vs. 93.48 ns), it is thus suggested that the unsatisfactory cell performance of P-Si as an HTM is probably due to the poor hole extraction ability for the P-Si layer (see Fig. S2c†). For comparison, a device with the P-Si layer inserted between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD is also fabricated, which exhibits 20.4% PCE, as shown in Fig. S2d.†
Here, a new attempt was made, that is, P-Si was introduced into perovskite films by an anti-solvent one-step spin-coating method. That is, perovskite precursor solution (1.4 M) was dropped onto the SnO2/PCBA layer and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, and 120 μl CB solution with different P-Si concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg ml−1) was poured onto the spinning film at 15 s in the high speed stage. The relevant film is denoted as x P-Si/perovskite, where x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 corresponding to the 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg ml−1 P-Si. The detailed device fabrication procedure is described in the Experimental section. By using this antisolvent technique for film deposition, we fabricate PSCs with the structure ITO/SnO2 nanoparticles (20 nm)/PCBA-(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1−x (600 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Au (80 nm), and the corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in Fig. S3.†
As shown in Fig. 2a and Table S1,† the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is dependent on the amount of P-Si additive. With the concentration of P-Si in CB increasing from 0.0 to 0.5 mg ml−1, the PCE, open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) increase firstly to 20.86%, 1.11 V and 0.76 (0.1 mg ml−1), and then rapidly decrease to 20.27%, 1.09 V and 0.74, respectively. Finally, the champion device with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite presents 21.5% PCE, as shown in Fig. 2b. Besides, the modified device exhibits a stabilized current of 22.9 mA cm−2 at 0.93 V bias voltage, with a steady-state efficiency of 21.3%, consistent with the results obtained from the current density–voltage (J–V) measurement. However, the steady-state efficiency of the control device is only 20.3% (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 2d show the details of the improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite; the short circuit current density (JSC) increases slightly from 24.2 to 24.8 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the result of the corresponding IPCE, in which integrated JSC increases from 23.3 to 23.7 mA cm−2.

To elucidate the mechanism behind the improvement of PSCs, the effect of P-Si on the microstructure and morphology of perovskite films has been investigated. Top-view SEM images of perovskite films show that the grain size of the perovskite film increases when a small amount of P-Si is introduced, as shown in Fig. 3a. For the 0.1 P-Si/perovskite film, a quite different atomic force microscope (AFM) morphology is observed; the surface roughness is significantly decreased with an RMS (root-mean-square) roughness of 12.7 nm, which can be attributed to the uniform coverage of the P-Si, as shown in Fig. 3b. These results are consistent with previous work.22,23 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the two representative samples with and without P-Si in Fig. S4a,† showing strong diffraction peaks at 14.02°, 19.87°, 24.40°, 28.25°, 31.66°, 34.79°, 40.38° and 42.93°, ascribed to (11), (20), (012), (22), (31), (030), (40), and (33), respectively, are characteristic peaks of the trigonal perovskite phase (space group: P3m1(156)) with the dominant (030) lattice reflection. The peak at 12.68° arises from the (001) lattice planes of PbI2 for the controlled perovskite film. XRD peaks become stronger for the perovskite film with P-Si, indicating better crystallinity without small grains. The enlarged grain size, reduced grain boundary and improved crystallinity in the perovskite film would reduce charge recombination. With P-Si present in the perovskite film, however, no obvious change in the absorption onset of the mixed ternary cation perovskite films is observed, compared to that of the pristine mixed ternary cation perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S4b.†

The concentration of P-Si is 0.1 mg ml−1. 
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometric microanalysis (EDX) of Pb and Si elements in pure perovskite and 0.1 P-Si/perovskite indicates that both elements show excellent homogeneity and dispersity, suggesting that P-Si has good compatibility in the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S5.† From the intensity distribution of Si element, we can see that P-Si polymer is uniformly distributed on the surface of the film. The GBs of perovskite crystals can be clearly observed in the perovskite film without P-Si, as shown in Fig. S6.† In contrast to the perovskite film treated with P-Si, the GBs become blurry and the perovskite crystals become more homogeneous. Furthermore, XPS spectra were recorded to confirm the introduction of the P-Si into the perovskite film. Since a very small amount of P-Si is introduced into the perovskite, weak S 2p peaks at 163.6 and 164.8 eV can be detected, which confirms that P-Si has been successfully introduced into the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 3c.40 Two Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks at 138.0 and 142.8 eV are found, respectively (Fig. 3d). However, for the perovskite film without P-Si treatment, two additional peaks are also observed at 136.4 and 141.3 eV, which are attributed to metallic lead on the surface.24,41 The appearance of metallic lead may be due to the higher level of iodine and cation vacancies. Obviously, P-Si treatment effectively reduces the peak intensity of metallic lead, indicating the preserved amounts of organic cations and reduced under-coordinated lead atoms. Furthermore, FT-IR spectra of P-Si, 0.1 P-Si/perovskite and pure perovskite films are also given in Fig. 3e. Two stretching vibration peaks are found at 839 and 802 cm−1, which are assigned to the symmetric C–S stretching modes and symmetric Si–C stretching modes in P-Si, respectively, indicating that P-Si has been successfully introduced into the perovskite film.42,43 However, no obvious interaction between perovskite and P-Si is suggested since no wavenumber shift is found for the two samples.
SCLC analysis was also employed to determine the trap density (ntrap) and charge-carrier mobility (μ) of the perovskite film by using the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices measured under dark condition are shown in Fig. 3f. There are three different regions in the J–V curves: ohmic region, trap-filled limit (TFL) region and Child's region. The voltage between the ohmic and TFL regions is called the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which can be used to calculate the ntrap by using the following equation:44  where εr is the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer, and e is the elementary charge. The trap density in the P-Si modified perovskite film is calculated to be 6.39 × 1015 cm−3, lower than that (8.61 × 1015 cm−3) of the film not treated with P-Si. Meanwhile, the trap density of states (tDOS) of the devices was measured by thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) (Fig. S7†). The tDOS decreases after incorporating with P-Si, indicating that P-Si plays an important role in reducing defects. In the high voltage Child's region, the current density–voltage curves can be fitted by using the SCLC model:44  
The hole-only devices with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite have a hole mobility of 8.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that (2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the hole-only devices with pure perovskite. The enhanced hole mobility and suppressed trap density in the hole-only device with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite could be attributed to the passivation effect of the polymer in the perovskite film.
In order to further find the reason why the introduction of P-Si can effectively improve cell performance, PL spectra were directly employed to investigate the charge carrier dynamics in perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4a, with the concentration of P-Si increasing in the perovskite films, the PL emission peak centered at 785 nm does not change; however, the peak intensity gets weaker, indicating that the PL quenching process is enhanced. It is thus suggested that the existence of P-Si as a p-type material can facilitate carrier separation at the P-Si/perovskite interface. And the photogenerated carrier lifetimes are also evaluated by TRPL decay, as given in Fig. 4b. TRPL spectra are well fitted with a two-component exponential decay model, and detailed fitting parameters are presented in Table S2.† As can be seen, the average carrier lifetimes are 465.84, 438.85, 389.08 and 81.23 ns for the pristine perovskite, 0.05 P-Si/perovskite, 0.1 P-Si/perovskite and 0.5 P-Si/perovskite films, respectively. The shorter PL decay time in the perovskite film with P-Si suggests that there is a charge transfer between the perovskite and P-Si. To confirm that, the sample with a structure of glass/Al2O3/perovskite (P-Si = 0.1 mg ml−1)/spiro-OMeTAD also has a faster decay time than the one without P-Si (Fig. S8†).

To further unravel the underlying charge recombination and transfer dynamics, TPV/TPC decays were also performed (Fig. 4c and d). The experimental results are fitted by a bi-exponential decay function, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4,† respectively. The photovoltage signal is triggered by a pulse light that pumps up the carrier density and thus the quasi-Fermi level splitting and charge recombination are directly measured via monitoring the photovoltage decay. The photovoltage decay time of the device with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite is 211.05 μs, longer than that of the control device without P-Si (112.56 μs). This prolonged photovoltage decay time suggests less charge recombination in the P-Si modified device, mainly attributed to the better perovskite film quality and efficient passivation of P-Si toward the trap states of the perovskite film. The TPV results are also in good agreement with the SCLC and TAS results. For the TPC results, the photocurrent decay time of the P-Si-modified device is reduced from 1.21 to 0.75 μs, indicating faster carrier transportation at the interface between the P-Si modified perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD. The TPC results are in good agreement with the PL results. The P-Si permeating into the perovskite film could provide some extra pathways for carrier transfer between perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD. As shown in Fig. 4e, P-Si is suggested to play a synergistic role in improving the performance of PSCs. In other words, the π-conjugated ladder-like P-Si polymer system decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains and siloxane chains is likely to be distributed on the surface and GBs of perovskite films to improve the film conductivity for better charge transfer for high performance and enhance the stability (Fig. S9†).
Relatively rigorous conditions simultaneously with 60% RH and 60 °C were further employed to investigate the moisture stability of perovskite films and PSCs. High resolution XRD measurement with a resolution of 0.0013° was performed to monitor the phase evolution of the film. As shown in Fig. 5a, for the pure perovskite film, the PbI2 phase appears rapidly after the treatment. With increasing time, the intensity of the PbI2 peak at 12.68° increases continuously, while the intensity of the perovskite peak at 14.02° remains stable. This indicates that the perovskite film partly decomposes at high moisture. Instead, for the 0.1 P-Si/perovskite film, the decomposition rate significantly decreases, and the PbI2 intensity does not change until 60 min. Obviously, the P-Si covered perovskite film is much more stable at high moisture. Even if the PbI2 intensity gradually increases, its increasing rate is much lower than that of the pure perovskite film (Fig. S10†). The average PCEs of the control PSCs decay dramatically to 65% of their initial values over 50 h under 60% RH and 60 °C, while the devices with P-Si can retain about 80% of their initial PCEs at the same time (Fig. 5b). Here, the degradation of PSCs mainly reflects on the decomposition of perovskite and the formation of PbI2. The significant difference in device stability can be attributed to the coverage of P-Si, which is effective in preventing moisture from penetrating into the perovskite film, primarily due to the much slower degradation of the perovskite material, and these results are in good agreement with the XRD results (Fig. 5a). The PSCs with 0.1 P-Si/perovskite exhibit a quite stable steady-state PCE output, with an only 2% decrease after 100 h of continuous operation, while the control device with pure perovskite exhibits a 35% decrease in the steady-state PCE output under the same conditions (Fig. 5c), which is ascribed to the relatively lower defect concentration and faster carrier extraction rate of the P-Si modified devices. The long-term stability tests of 20 un-encapsulated devices reveal that, after storing for 120 days, the PSCs with P-Si can retain 97.6% ± 1.5% of the original average PCE, while the PCE of the PSCs without P-Si decreased to 93% ± 2.5% of the original average value (20 ± 5 °C, 20% RH, Fig. 5d and S11†). The reason for this deviation is mainly that there is some fluctuation in the original PCE of these 20 testing devices (see Fig. 5d), which is caused by some change in experimental conditions during the perovskite film formation in the glovebox (i.e. ambient atmosphere). It has been widely reported that the defects could be a pathway for moisture to diffuse into the perovskite film and accelerate the decomposition of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficient improvement of the PSCs with P-Si under long-term moisture conditions, and the photo- and electric field stabilities of the PSCs are attributed to the passivation effect of P-Si toward the perovskite films surface and GBs, which can bring about much lower defect states in the perovskite film and improved crystallinity.

Conclusion
In this work, a new p-type π-conjugated ladder-like polymer, P-Si, has been designed and introduced into the perovskite layer by a one-step antisolvent method. We find that P-Si can improve the surface morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films. P-Si is likely to be distributed on the surface and GBs of perovskite films, and the hole transporting capability of the polymer improves charge transfer between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD. The PSCs modified with P-Si exhibit an enhanced efficiency and significantly better long-term stability and photo-electric field stability than the control devices without P-Si. This new π-conjugated ladder-like polymer containing hydrophobic alkyl chains and siloxane chains is a promising additive for perovskite films to improve the cell performance and stability of SnO2 based PSCs.
