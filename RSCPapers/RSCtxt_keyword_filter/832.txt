    , Accepted 12th October 2022First published on 12th October 2022AbstractTo commercialize flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs), they must achieve mechanical reliability along with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability. 2D/3D stacking of perovskites can theoretically improve the photovoltaic performance and mechanical reliability of f-PSCs simultaneously. But due to the complexity of the surface reaction, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control the growth of 2D perovskites with favorable growth sites, morphologies, and mechanical properties on 3D perovskites. Here we report the polarity of X-bromobenzylamine (X = 2, 3, and 4) salts as well as ambient moisture to be critical factors governing the reaction selectivity and growth behavior of 2D perovskites on 3D perovskites. The mild polarity-induced reaction selectivity, namely 4-bromobenzylamine cations with PbI2, enables precise growth of 2D perovskites at the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites, while moderate moisture further stimulates the growth of 2D perovskites to form a trans-GBs structure. This unique “trans-GBs” 2D perovskite forms a p–n heterojunction with 3D perovskites, enhancing the built-in potential and exhibiting an excellent passivation effect and suitable mechanical properties (with the Young's modulus comparable to that of 3D MHP). As a result, the trans-GBs 2D/3D based f-PSCs obtained a certified PCE of up to 22.1% and maintained ∼80% of their initial PCE after 8000 bending cycles (R = 4 mm).

Broader context
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) have great potential in various photovoltaic applications, while good mechanical reliability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) are both crucial for f-PSCs to be commercialized. Using 2D perovskites as a capping layer can effectively passivate the surface defects on 3D perovskites and alleviate non-radiative recombination, and meanwhile can increase the mechanical reliability of 3D perovskites in theory. But due to the complexity of surface reaction, the controllable formation of 2D perovskites on 3D perovskites, for example, with a controllable growth site, morphology, continuality, and mechanical strength, remains a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate that the polarity of ammonium salts and ambient moisture are two key factors governing the growth of 2D perovskites across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites to form “trans-GBs” structural 2D/3D perovskites, which enabled us to obtain f-PSCs with a high PCE and good mechanical reliability simultaneously. This study enriches our understanding of the key factors for precisely controlling the formation of a desired 2D/3D stacking perovskite and offers an essential strategy to advance the commercialization of f-PSCs further.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) as light absorbers have experienced explosive development in the past decade.1–10 To date, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has reached 25.7%, rivaling that of Si-based solar cells.11,12 With the steady improvement in operational stability, PSCs as an emerging 3rd generation photovoltaic (PV) technology is at the very frontier toward commercialization. Meanwhile, the solution-processibility of MHPs at low temperatures enables the fabrication of flexible PSCs (f-PSCs) in a more facile and economical way, for example, by the roll-to-roll procedure.13 There is a broad consensus that F-PSCs will vastly expand the future applications of PSCs, such as in wearable devices, special-shaped buildings, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Currently, the PCE of f-PSCs can be further improved through interface engineering, defect passivation, and other strategies.14–19 Nevertheless, the mechanical reliability of f-PSCs deserves more attention in their future practical applications, as they are usually subjected to severe external mechanical stress during operation.20–23
Cracks and delamination of MHP films under bending, stretching, or twisting result from the poor mechanical stability of f-PSCs. Two main strategies have been developed to mitigate the mechanical damage of MHP thin films: reducing external mechanical stress or increasing films’ fracture energy. The first strategy has been adopted in the case of ultra-thin f-PSCs.24–27 The stress-neutral axis was shifted toward the MHP film thanks to using an ultrathin substrate (less than 10 μm), thereby enabling the stress on the MHP film to significantly alleviate. As a result, ultra-thin f-PSCs exhibited excellent mechanical stability while almost no PCE decrease was observed after 10000 bending cycles.28 The second strategy toward mechanical stability enhancement can be realized by polymer doping. The addition of polymers such as polysiloxane (PSO) and polyurethane (PU) can increase the toughness of MHP films and even enable the self-healing of cracks at grain boundaries (GBs), thereby promoting f-PSCs’ stretchability.22,29,30 However, generally a high PCE (>20%) and excellent mechanical stability cannot be achieved simultaneously based on the above two strategies. For example, poorly conductive polymers may inhibit efficient charge transport in MHP films, while organic conductive layers (such as PEDOT:PSS) for ultra-thin f-PSCs are inferior to the inorganic counterpart (such as ITO, indium tin oxide) in normal f-PSCs. Recently, Dong et al. proposed that the two-dimensional (2D) MHPs, usually used as passivation layers on three-dimensional (3D) MHP thin films, could realize simultaneous improvement in PCE and mechanical stability for f-PSCs.19 However, owing to the complexity of the surface reaction, it remains a significant challenge to precisely control the growth of 2D MHPs on a 3D one with favorable growth sites, morphologies, and mechanical properties to maximize their advantages in both defect passivation and mechanical enhancement.
Herein, we report a systematic study on the controllable growth of a 2D MHP capping layer on a 3D MHP surface to achieve highly efficient f-PSCs with excellent mechanical stability. It is revealed that the mild polarity of organic ammonium (X-bromobenzylamine, X = 2, 3, and 4) salts and the induction of moderate moisture are essential for the formation of a desirable high-quality 2D MHP capping layer that trans-GBs of 3D MHPs. Using the in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAX) technique, we deeply explored and determined the growth mechanism of the unique “trans-GBs” 2D/3D MHP. Furthermore, we have examined the mechanical properties of a 2D and 3D MHP surface through a peak force quantitative nano-mechanical (PF-QNM) technique and determined the most suitable Young's modulus (E) of the 2D capping layers. Finally, 4-bromobenzylammonium iodide (4-BBAI) with the weakest cation polarity was verified to be a good candidate to form an optimal trans-GBs 2D/3D structure that can effectively passivate defects, enhance the built-in potential and gain access to good mechanical properties. The 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D/3D f-PSCs achieved high PCEs of up to 22.1% (certified), demonstrating superior mechanical reliability (T80 > 8000 cycles, R = 4 mm, T80 refers to retention of ∼80% of the initial PCE) and enhanced long-term stability to heat, humidity, and UV light.
Results and discussion
The MHP layer is definitely a polycrystalline film containing a large number of GBs where the uncoordinated ions and consequent defects accumulate massively, thereby easily leading to non-radiative recombination and energy loss, and is also detrimental to the device's long-term durability as revealed in detail in previous reports.31 Meanwhile, due to the lack of strong inter-GB connection, the MHP film is usually mechanically fragile and prone to fracture under external stress.32,33 In principle, 2D MHP can be used to enhance the bending resistance of 3D MHPs through forming a 2D/3D hybrid structure with a higher fracture energy and good elasticity. But in practice, it remains a great challenge to realize precise growth of 2D MHPs at GBs or across the GBs on 3D MHPs.
Usually, the solution of organic ammonium salt is spin-coated on the surface of 3D MHP films and then reacts with PbI2 or 3D MHPs to form 2D MHPs.19,34 Excessive PbI2 in the 3D MHP precursor can be extruded to the GBs by 3D MHP crystals during crystallization, so it is critical to well control the selective reaction of organic ammonium salt with PbI2 at GBs of the film. We chose three organic ammonium salts with the same chemical composition but different structures and polarities, i.e., 2-BBAI, 3-BBAI, and 4-BBAI, as shown in Fig. 1(a). –Br and –CH2NH3+ are both electron-withdrawing groups, and according to their relative position on the benzene ring, the polarity of the cations in the three organic ammonium salts conforms to the following order: 2-BBA+ > 3-BBA+ > 4-BBA+. This also can be proved by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, where the molecular polarity index (MPI) of 2-BBA, 3-BBA, and 4-BBA was determined to be 12.0, 11.6, and 10.2 kcal mol−1, respectively. We spin-coated the isopropanol solution (10 mg mL−1) of three organic ammonium salts on pure PbI2 and 3D MHP ((FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbI3)0.05, PbI2 excess 10%) films, respectively. As roughly verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1(b) and (c), on both the PbI2 and 3D MHP films, the 3-BBAI and 4-BBAI based films exhibit the same diffraction peaks at 2θ < 10°, respectively. This confirms the formation of an n = 1 type 2D Ruddlesden–Popper MHP capping layer with the chemical composition of (3-BBA)2A'n−1PbnI3n+1 and (4-BBA)2A'n−1PbnI3n+1, where n represents the number of its octahedral inorganic sheets between the cation layers, A' represents FA and/or MA cations. In contrast, for the 2-BBAI deposited films, the XRD peak at 2θ < 10° can only be observed on the 3D MHP-based film. The above results suggest that 3-BBAI and 4-BBAI tend to react with PbI2 to form crystallized 2D MHPs, but 2-BBAI, whose cation has a higher polarity (than 3-BBA+ or 4-BBA+), is prone to react with 3D MHPs. However, for the reaction between BBAI and 3D MHP, we cannot preclude the formation of the amorphous or less-crystallized ones since XRD can only determine the crystallized products.

More information about the phase distribution in the BBAI-treated MHP films was collected by characterizing the films using photoluminescence (PL) from the front (MHP) side. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the PL emission peaks before 650 nm can be assigned to 2D MHPs with different structures and photoelectronic properties. Consistent with the XRD pattern, the high-intensity peaks at 476 nm (3-BBAI treated) and 523 nm (4-BBAI treated) are from the dominant n = 1 2D MHP in each film, and the peak at 623 nm (2-BBAI treated) represents the n > 1 2D MHP phase. However, the PL characterization provides more phase information for the 3-BBAI and 4-BBAI-treated films. For the 4-BBAI-treated films, the weak peak at 570 nm is from the n = 2 2D MHP, as it is very close to the peak at 523 nm of the n = 1 2D MHP, which may result from the structural evolution from n = 1 to n = 2 2D MHP, or in other words, a continuous reaction between 4-BBAI and PbI2. In contrast, the two PL emission peaks of the 3-BBAI-treated films are far apart (476 nm and 623 nm), suggesting that the two 2D MHPs may originate from two independent reactions, 3-BBAI with PbI2 and 3-BBAI with 3D MH. This will also be further discussed in the following section. The above results validate the selective reactions between the three organic ammonium salts with PbI2 or 3D MHP. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(e), 2-BBAI with the largest polarity is inclined to react with the 3D MHP, 4-BBAI with the smallest polarity being more prone to react with PbI2, and 3-BBAI with moderate polarity can react with PbI2 and 3D MHP, simultaneously.
We characterized the surface morphology of the 3D MHP film before and after the deposition of organic ammonium salts using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1(f) shows that the size of 3D MHP grains is around 200 nm, and PbI2 crystals (light contrast) are distributed along the GBs of the 3D MHP. Consistent with our above analysis, the 3D MHP is evenly covered by a capping layer after the deposition of 2-BBAI since it can react with the entire 3D MHP surface. In contrast, the 3-BBAI and 4-BBAI deposited films exhibit some 2D structures and less-crystallized or amorphous phases (as indicated by the black contrast in Fig. 1(h) and (i)). However, the 2D structures in the two films are limited and unable to cover well or connect the GBs. Therefore, further reaction engineering is still required to form 2D MHPs with specific GB-enhanced structures.
Fabrication of MHP films in an ambient atmosphere, or humidity-resistant preparation of high-efficiency PSCs, is expected as it will make scalable production more facile and economical. The ambient moisture is a double-edged sword since it can lead to structural degradation of MHPs on the one hand. On the other hand, a moderate amount of water has a positive effect on nucleation and crystallization of 3D MHPs.35 However, the effect of moisture on the growth of 2D MHPs, especially in the case of in situ growth of 2D MHPs on 3D ones, has never been explored. To elucidate this issue, we moved the as-prepared 3D MHP films out of the glove box and carried out the deposition of 2D MHPs under ambient conditions (∼50% RH). Then, the water molecules adsorbed on 3D MHPs or contained in the organic ammonium salt solution may change the 2D MHP growth environment.

Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the surface SEM images of the 2D/3D MHPs in which the 2D constituents were deposited under ambient conditions instead of in a glove box. For 2-BBAI or 3-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHPs (Fig. 2(a) and (b)), almost no apparent surface morphology variation can be observed compared to the samples entirely prepared in a glove box. In contrast, in Fig. 2(c), we can see the 4-BBAI-based 2D MHP deposited under ambient conditions, whose morphology is different from its counterpart shown in Fig. 1(i) as it exhibits consecutive growth and distribution capable of covering the 3D MHP underlayer more adequately, especially the grain boundaries (GBs). Here, we conjecture that the formation of the 4-BBAI-based 2D MHPs under ambient conditions experienced a trans-GBs growth, which should be related to the ambient moisture. To further clarify this moisture-induced effect, we added different amounts of water to the isopropanol (IPA) solution and carried out spin-coating in a glove box. As expected, a similar “trans-GBs” structure can be observed on top of 3D MHPs (Fig. S1, ESI†) when concisely controlling the water amount in the 4-BBAI solution.

The PL spectra in Fig. 2(d) (compared with Fig. 1(d)) further validate the 2D MHP capping layer's structural changes when prepared under ambient conditions. First, the direct reaction between ammonium salts and 3D MHP films seems to be inhibited upon the introduction of moisture. Compared with the film prepared in a glove box, the 2D attributes of the 2-BBAI-based MHP deposited under ambient conditions are less conspicuous (Fig. S2, ESI†). Similarly, for 3-BBAI-based 2D MHP prepared under ambient conditions, the n > 1 2D phase formed from the direct interaction between 3-BBAI and 3D MHP carried out in a glove box also disappears. Second, 4-BBAI with lower cationic polarity forms a 2D MHP with a different structure as compared to 2-BBAI and 3-BBAI. The 4-BBAI-based 2D MHP prepared under ambient conditions is composed of mixed 2D phases with three consecutive n values, among which the n = 1 phase is the dominant component. Based on the selective reaction of 4-BBAI with PbI2 and the inhibition of the direct reaction of ammonium salts with 3D MHPs by moisture, the n > 1 phases in the 4-BBAI-based 2D MHP are more likely formed through the sequential reaction of the n = 1 2D MHPs with 3D MHPs.
We used in situ GIWAXS to deeply explore the growth mechanism of 2D MHPs on 3D MHP surfaces. As shown in the schematics in Fig. 2(e) and Fig. S3a (ESI†), we monitored the changes in the crystalline properties of MHP films during the spin-coating and subsequent annealing process under ambient conditions (∼50% RH) or N2 atmosphere. The 2D intensity-time color mappings during 4-BBAI deposition shows that when the 4-BBAI solution comes in contact with 3D MHPs, the 4-BBAI starts to react with PbI2 to form n = 1 2D MHPs:PbI2 + 2(4-BBAI) → (4-BBA)2PbI4which continues to react during the spin-coating process. In the subsequent annealing process, no new signals occur under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S3b, ESI†). But under ambient conditions (Fig. 2(f)), a new signal of 2D phase MHPs (n > 1) is generated at Qz = 8.7 nm−1, corresponding to the PL results in Fig. 2(d); meanwhile, the peak intensity of n = 1 (Qz at 7.7 and 3.9 nm−1) is weakened. More intuitive information can be found in the 2D GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 2(g)) of MHP films at the spin coating (6 s) and annealing (100 s) stages. We, therefore infer that moisture was adsorbed on the 3D MHP (simplified as FAPbI3) and then induced a subsequent n > 1 2D MHP formation reaction:FAPbI3 + xH2O → FAPbI3·xH2O  
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(h), a growth model was tentatively proposed to describe the formation of 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D MHPs. 4-BBAI first reacts with PbI2 at GBs to form n = 1 2D MHP, which will extend during spin-coating and fully contact with the surface-moisture-adsorbed 3D MHP. Then, facilitated by a higher temperature, in situ reaction with the surrounding 3D MHPs to form n > 1 2D MHPs occurred, apparently a trans-GB growth behavior, finally enabling the GBs and the adjacent area of the 3D MHP surface to be adequately covered and connected. This trans-GBs structure acts as an adhesive tape and is expected to enhance the mechanical strength of the 3D MHP, and may also play another role in passivating surface defects.
The above results indicate that moderate moisture is favorable for creating a trans-GBs 2D capping layer on 3D MHP composed of smaller crystal grains (with an average size of around 200 nm), as can be seen from Fig. 1(f). We all know that 3D MHP films with larger crystal grains (>1 μm) are more popular due to better crystallinity and fewer defects.36 We subsequently examined whether our moisture-guided strategy is still applicable to create a trans-GBs structure on such high-quality MHPs.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), a 3D MHP film of (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 with an average grain size exceeding 1 μm was prepared by adding MACl into the precursor solution (with excess PbI2), a strategy routinely used in previous works.37,38 Then, IPA solutions of the three amine salts were deposited above 3D MHP under ambient conditions. It can be observed from the SEM images in Fig. 3(b) and (c) that there is no obvious capping layer in the 2-BBAI or 3-BBAI-based samples, in which the GBs of the 3D MHP are entirely exposed. By comparison, we can find the trans-GBs structure in 4-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHP film (Fig. 3(d)), further validating the applicability of our strategy.

(n) Average Young's modulus of the above thin films. 
We further studied the surface mechanical properties of the above MHP films using PeakForce quantitative nanomechanical (QNM) imaging, a ground breaking modality of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for in-situ investigation of the surface mechanical properties of soft materials at high resolution, which was carried out based on a tapping mode schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(m). Fig. 3(e)–(h) demonstrate the AFM height images of the four MHP films while Fig. 3(i)–(l) are the corresponding Young's modulus images obtained from PeakForce QNM, and the average Young's modulus values are summarized in Fig. 3(n). The AFM height image of the pure 3D MHP (Fig. 3(e)) exhibits a similar topography to its SEM image (Fig. 3(a)). Whereas, as shown in Fig. 3(i), the Young's modulus at the GBs is much smaller than that of the grains, confirming that the GB is relatively fragile and inclined to generate cracks during bending, leading to the deterioration of the photovoltaic performance and stability. Significant changes can be found after the three amine salts are deposited on 3D MHP. Although the 2D capping layer for the 2-BBAI-based film was not detected by SEM (Fig. 3(b)) as aforementioned, the AFM height image in Fig. 3(f) demonstrates that there are loosely arranged 2D structures covering 3D MHPs. Based on PeakForce QNM imaging (Fig. 3(j)), this kind of capping layer is verified to be softer (with a smaller Young's modulus of 4.8 GPa) than 3D MHP (12 GPa) (the values are summarized in Fig. 3(n)), and may not be capable of enhancing the mechanical strength of 3D MHPs. By comparison, the 3-BBAI-derived 2D phase is distributed around the grains of 3D MHPs (Fig. 3(c)). It is much harder (Young's modulus of 23 GPa) than that of 3D MHPs (Fig. 3(k)), but it is thought to contribute little to strengthening the GBs since this 2D phase is composed of small nanocrystallites rather than an intact 2D phase covering the whole GBs of 3D MHPs. By comparison, the 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D phase has a larger grain size (Fig. 3(h)) and an average Young's modulus (8.1 GPa) comparable to that of 3D MHPs, which is beneficial to strengthening the GBs and thereby enhancing the fracture energy of the overall MHP film.
2D MHPs are suitable materials for the passivation of the surface defects on 3D MHPs.39 We evaluated the passivation effect of our 2D MHPs using laser scanning and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) imaging analysis. Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the surface PL intensity images of the 3D MHPs before and after passivation. 4-BBAI and 2-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHPs exhibit much stronger PL intensities than the control 3D MHP, while 3-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHPs showed no significant enhancement. It should be noted that, for samples with a 2D/3D MHP structure, it is difficult to guarantee the same intensity of laser to excite the 3D MHP since the laser must pass through a relatively thick 2D MHP with different light absorption capabilities. Therefore, compared to the PL intensity images, the PL lifetime images can more realistically demonstrate the passivation effect of 2D MHPs. As shown in Fig. 4(e)–(h), the 4-BBAI and 2-BBAI-based 2D MHPs also exhibit longer PL lifetimes than the control 3D MHP. And by comparison, the 4-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHP shows a more uniform lifetime distribution than the 2-BBAI-based one, indicating that the 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D MHP is closely and uniformly in contact with the underlying 3D MHP. The weak passivation effect of the 3-BBAI-based 2D MHP may be due to its small size grains (Fig. 3(g)), which negatively introduce additional surface effects and offset the positive passivation effect of NH3+ and I− in 3-BBAI on 3D MHPs.

(a)–(d) Two-dimensional PL intensity and (e)–(h) PL lifetime images of the 3D MHP film (a), (e), 2-BBAI/3D MHP film (b), (f), 3-BBAI/3D MHP film (c), (g), and 4-BBAI/3D MHP film (d), (h), the ammonium salts were deposited under ambient conditions. (i) UPS spectra of 3D MHP and the ammonium salts deposited on 3D MHP thin films, values are Fermi level (EF) (left), and EF – VBM (right) obtained from the UPS spectra. (j) The energetic levels of the corresponding n-type 3D MHP and p-type 2D MHP thin films. 
We then used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to determine the surface energy levels of different MHPs. As shown in Fig. 4(i) and (j), the Fermi level (EF) of 3D MHP (−4.71 eV) is higher than that of 2D MHPs (2-BBAI, −6.01 eV; 3-BBAI, −5.44 eV; 4-BBAI, −5.84 eV). The energy difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) and EF (EF – VBM) of the 3D MHP is 1.2 eV, suggesting that the PbI2-rich MHP is an n-type MHP, which is consistent with a previous report.40 The EF of the 2D MHPs is closer to the VBM than to the conduction band minimum (CBM), indicating that these 2D MHPs are p-type MHPs. The 2D/3D MHP can therefore be interpreted as an p–n heterojunction that can induce a built-in potential. To be specific, our 2D MHPs of ∼30 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†) provide sufficient thickness to guarantee the formation of a robust depletion layer, which is favorable to further strengthening the built-in potential, thereby contributing to achieving higher PV performance for PSCs.38
We fabricated different MHP thin films into n–i–p type f-PSCs (the inset in Fig. 5(d), active area 0.049 cm2) and measured their PV performance under AM 1.5G, 1 sun illumination. Fig. 5(a) shows the PCE statistics of the f-PSCs with pure 3D and 2-BBAI, 3-BBAI, and 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D/3D MHPs, which were calculated from the current density (J)–voltage (V) measurements in forward (F, JSC to VOC) and reverse (R, VOC to JSC) scan directions. Other PV parameters like open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) are shown in Fig. S5 and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), respectively. It can be found that the devices with 2D/3D MHPs are superior to the ones based on pure 3D MHP. The average PCE of 3-BBAI-based devices is 20.1%, higher than that of the control devices (18.8%). By comparison, 4-BBAI and 2-BBAI-based devices exhibit much higher average PCEs of 21.1% and 21.0% in the reverse scan, while the hysteresis of 4-BBAI-based f-PSCs is less pronounced. Fig. 5(b) plots the J–V response of the ‘champion’ f-PSCs based on different MHPs. The JSC values are consistent with the integrated photocurrent in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 5(c). The 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D/3D MHPs endow f-PSC with a JSC of 23.3 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.16 V, and an FF of 81.5%, achieving a PCE of 21.9% higher than that of 2-BBAI (21.6%) or 3-BBAI-based (20.7%) devices. Steady PCE outputs are also obtained at their maximum power point in Fig. 5(d), which are 19.8%, 21.2%, 20.3%, and 21.7% for the devices based on 3D, 2-BBAI, 3-BBAI, and 4-BBAI-based 2D/3D MHPs, respectively. The PV performance improvement for the f-PSCs with 2D capping layers mainly benefits from the increased VOC and FF, a result of defect passivation and an additional built-in potential enabled by the 2D/3D p–n heterojunction. The PL mapping results show that 2-BBAI and 4-BBAI-based 2D MHPs have better defect passivation effects than the 3-BBAI-based ones, as verified by the transient photovoltage decay results in Fig. 5(e), where the lifetime trend is 4-BBAI ≈ 2-BBAI > 3-BBAI > control. Similarly, in the VOCvs. light density plots (Fig. 5(f)), the 4-BBAI-based device exhibits the smallest slope of 1.56 kT q−1. As shown in the Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. 5(g), the 4-BBAI and 2-BBAI-based devices exhibit larger built-in potentials as the EF of 4-BBAI (or 2-BBAI) based 2D/3D MHP is larger than that of the 3-BBAI based one. The trend of the built-in potentials is consistent with the VOC trend of these f-PSCs.

(i) EQE and integrated JSC spectra of the “champion” 4-BBAI/FAxMAxPbI3-based f-PSC. 
We further validated our strategy on FAxMA1−xPbI3 MHPs prepared using a two-step spin coating method.7 The SEM images in Fig. S6 (ESI†) show that the 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs structure can also be obtained on the FAxMA1−xPbI3 MHP surface, demonstrating the generality of our strategy. As shown in Fig. 5(h), based on the 4-BBAI/FAxMA1−xPbI3 trans-GBs 2D/3D MHP, the f-PSCs obtained a champion PCE up to 22.1% (reverse scan). Furthermore, we sent the best device to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China) for certification. The device showed a PCE of 22.1% in reverse and 21.8% in forward scans (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). Compared to the PV parameters of the one-step (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 based device, the two-step FAxMA1−xPbI3 based f-PSC exhibit a higher JSC due to the broader light absorption range of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 MHP, as shown by the EQE results in Fig. 5(i).
Subsequently, we studied the mechanical properties of the f-PSCs in detail. It is known that, for f-PSCs, the convex (tension) bending is more destructive (generating cracks) to the MHP films than the concave (compression) bending since the main residual stress in the MHP films is the tensile stress resulting from the thermal expansion coefficient difference between the MHP and ITO substrate. The resulting cracks will then induce more severe damage, such as determination in the subsequent bending process, hindering the longitudinal transfer of photogenerated charges, and causing fatal damage to the PCE and long-term stability. The 2D MHP we highlight here is designed to prevent cracks caused by tensile stress to improve the mechanical reliability of the MHP films and even the entire devices. As shown in Fig. 6(a), we performed tension-only bend testing (R = 4 mm) on the f-PSCs with and without 2D MHP capping layers in ambient air (∼40% RH, ∼25 °C). We performed J–V tests to collect PV parameters of the f-PCSs after scheduled bending cycles. Fig. 6(b) shows the normalized PCE of the f-PSCs as a function of number of bending cycles. The trend of other PV parameters is presented in Fig. S9 (ESI†). 4-BBAI-based trans-GBs 2D/3D devices demonstrate the best bending tolerance and maintain ∼80% of the initial PCE after 8000 cycles. The PCE of the control f-PSC without a 2D MHP capping layer has dropped to ∼20% of its initial PCE. The 2-BBAI-based devices have relatively better mechanical properties than the 3-BBAI-based one as they can retain 55% and 39% of their initial PCEs, respectively. We illustrate the surface SEM images of different f-PSCs after 8000 bending cycles. The visibility of cracks indicates the damage severity of the device to some extent in a broad field of view (Fig. 6(c)–(f)). The crack sharpness of f-PSCs without and with a 2D capping layer based on 3-BBAI, 2-BBAI, and 4-BBAI decreases sequentially, consistent with their PCE decay trends. We then performed a zoom-in analysis of their single cracks, and the results are shown in Fig. 6(g)–(j). The control and 3-BBAI-based f-PSCs exhibit bulging phenomena, suggesting the occurrence of delamination, which could severely hinder the transport of photogenerated charges. In contrast, the crack of the 4-BBAI-based device shown in Fig. 6(k) is shallow and flat without complete fracture, indicating that the film damage is well suppressed by the trans-GBs 2D/3D structure.

(k) Schematic diagram of the mechanical enhancement effect of 2D MHP on the device. 
We then conducted a stretching test on the MHP films. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the sample with the structure of MHP/PEDOT:PSS/PDMS has been tested for 100 stretching cycles (10% stretching). The top-view SEM images of the stretched films can be found in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Compared to the bending tests, the stretching tests produced more serious damage to the MHP films. Those 2D MHPs were unable to totally prevent the formation of fracture of MHP films during the stretching test, but the 4BBAI-based 2D/3D MHP exhibited superior crack inhibition compared to the other MHP films. Therefore, in order to improve the stretchability of the whole device in the future, it will be a good strategy to combine our trans-GB 2D/3D MHP with the previous methods to achieve enhancement of the stretchability of the perovskite film itself.29,30
We further performed UV light, thermal, and ambient stability verifications on 3D and various 2D/3D f-PSCs. As shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†), the 4-BBAI and 2BBAI-based 2D MHP, with better defect passivation effects, endowed f-PSCs with better UV light stability. This indicates that even at the MHP/HTL interface, fewer interfacial defects can alleviate the interface deterioration under UV light irradiation. Under high-intensity UV irradiation at 365 nm (103 mW cm−2, several tenfold higher than the UV light of sunlight) for 50 min, 4-BBAI and 2BBAI-based f-PSCs retained over 80% of their initial PCEs, while the control 3D f-PSCs retained 60% of their initial PCEs. In Fig. S12b and c (ESI†), the 4-BBAI-based f-PSC exhibits good thermal (65 °C) and ambient (∼80% RH) stability. This indicates that this in situ grown trans-GB 2D MHP has a more compact and continuous structure, which not only possesses better mechanical properties but also enhances its ability to suppress the outward migration of ions from the 3D MHP and the inward erosion of external moisture.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have reported two critical factors to precisely control the formation of 2D MHPs on the surface of 3D MHPs: the polarity-induced reaction selectivity and the formation of a trans-GBs structure induced by ambient moisture. The crystallographic, optoelectronic, morphological, and mechanical properties of different MHPs were analysed using a set of targeted characterization methods, such as AFM, PL, and PK-QNM. Using in situ GIWAX technology, we in-depth explored and identified the growth mechanism of our unique “trans-GBs” 2D/3D MHP. Its positive effects on defect passivation, additional built-in potential formation, and mechanical property enhancement were systematically investigated. We also tentatively proposed a model to describe the growth mechanism underlying this. Based on this strategy, high PCEs of up to 22.1% (certified) were achieved for f-PSCs, exhibiting excellent bending tolerance. Although deeper mechanisms, such as the selectivity of the reaction at the molecular level, and the exact reaction pathway of moisture induction, still need to be studied, we believe that this work has paved the way for accelerating the industrialization of f-PSCs.

Ltd, China), PbBr2 (>99%, TCI, Japan), CH3NH3Cl (MACl, 99.8%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp., China), CH3NH3Br (MABr, 99.8%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp., China), HC(NH2)2I (FAI, 99.8%, Greatcell Energy, Australia), FK209 Co(III) TFSI (95%, Greatcell Energy, Australia), SnO2 colloidal dispersion (15 wt% in H2O, Alfa Aesar, UK), 2/3/4-bromobenzylamine (2/3/4-BBA, 98% +, Adamas, China), Spiro-OMeTAD (99.7%, Born, Co.

The reagents 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), bis (trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (99.95%), HI (57 wt% in H2O, 99.95%) and solvents acetonitrile (99.9%), dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), α,α,α-trifluorotoluene (99%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). FTO-coated glass substrates (7 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Suzhou Shangyang Solar Technology Co. Ltd (China). The ITO-coated PET substrates (∼185 μm thickness) were prepared in-house.
2/3/4-BBAI was synthesized by adding 690 mg 2/3/4-BBA to 10 mL absolute ethanol in a round-bottom flask that was stirred in an ice-water bath. Then, 1.1 g HI solution was added dropwise to the 2/3/4-BBA ethanol solution that was stirred for 2 h. After removing the solvent by vacuum distillation, the solid crude 2/3/4-BBAI was obtained and washed with diethyl ether. Subsequently, the 2/3/4-BBAI solid was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized with diethyl ether, which was repeated three times, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48 h to obtain 2/3/4-BBAI crystals.
Device fabrication
ITO/PET and FTO/glass substrates were etched using a laser-etching machine (Perovs, China) to obtain the electrode pattern and then washed with deionized water, and isopropanol sequentially in an ultrasonic cleaning machine, and the ultrasonic time for each solution lasted for at least 20 minutes. After drying in an oven, the substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 15 min to enhance the wettability and remove some organic contaminants. Subsequently, SnO2 colloidal dispersion, which was diluted to 2.5 wt% using deionized water (1:4 by volume), was spin-coated on the substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min (rigid substrate) and 120 °C for 2 h (flexible substrate) to remove the solvent. All ETLs were then UVO-post-treated for 10 min and transferred to the glovebox (H2O < 0.01 ppm). To fabricate an MHP thin film with small-size crystal grains (∼200 nm), the (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 MHP precursor was prepared by sequentially adding MABr (7.84 mg), PbBr2 (25.69 mg), FAI (228.72 mg), and PbI2 (674 mg) into 1 mL mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (7:1 by volume). For the big-size crystal grains (>1 μm), 27 mg MACl was added into the above MHP precursor. After thoroughly stirring and dissolving, 50 μL of the MHP precursor solution was spin-coated on the SnO2-ETL-coated conductive substrates, followed by a two-stage spin-coating process (1000 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s). At the 20s second of the whole page, 100 μL of α,α,α-trifluorotoluene was continuously added dropwise as an antisolvent and heated at 120 °C for 50 min. For the two-step FAxMA1−xPbI3 deposition, 210 mg of PbI2 was dissolved in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO, and the volume ratio of DMF and DMSO was 9:1. The organic salt solution consisted of 162 mg FAI, 11 mg MAI, and 16.2 mg MACl dissolved in 1.8 mL isopropanol; 20 mL PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the ETL substrates at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 20 s to obtain the PbI2 layer in the N2 glove box. 70 mL of organic salt was spin-coated on the PbI2 film at 2000 rpm for 25 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. For the 2D/3D MHP, the 2/3/4-BBAI solution (10 mg mL−1 in isopropanol) was dropwise added on the 3D MHP and then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s, inside or outside of the glove box. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 30s. To obtain the HTL precursor solution, 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene with additives of 28.8 μL TBP, 17.5 μL lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide in acetonitrile solution (520 mg mL−1), and 20 μL FK 209 Co(III) TFSI salt in acetonitrile solution (300 mg mL−1). HTL layer was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 60 nm Au electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the HTL.
Preparation of stretchable MHP films
The PDMS substrate is obtained by mixing the elastomer and curing agent in 10:1, cast in a Petri dish, degassed, and annealed at 100 °C for 1 h and cut into 2 × 2 cm2 for stretchable substrates. PEDOT:PSS with 5 wt% of DMSO was spin-coated at 1000 rpm (40 s) and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The 3D and 2D/3D MHPs (small grains) were fabricated on the PEDOT:PSS/PDMS substrates.
Materials characterization
The microstructures of the thin films were observed using a field-emission SEM (SU8220, Hitachi, Japan). XRD of the perovskite thin films was performed using a high-resolution diffractometer (SmartLab 9kw, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. UPS was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo, UK), and mono-chromatized He-Iα radiation at 21.2 eV was used. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS1000). The 2D PL intensity and lifetime images were acquired using home-built laser-scanned imaging microscopy coupled with time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). The laser beam was focused on the sample through a 100× air objective lens (NA = 0.95, Olympus PLFLN 100×) at 450 nm wavelength (SC400-PP, Fianium, U.K.). A high-speed detector (HPM-100-40, Hamamatsu, Japan) was used to collect fluorescence and lifetime at the region >710 nm by using the band-pass filter. AFM measurements were performed using an atomic force microscope (Dimension Icon, BRUKER, USA) in the PFQNM mode. Measurements were taken to characterize the film's morphology and mechanical properties under ambient conditions at room temperature. A DNISP-HS probe with a nominal spring constant of 350 N m−1 was applied. The AFM data were analyzed using Gwyddion software. Transient photovoltage decay and Mott–Schottky curves of the f-PSCs were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CIMPS-2, Zennium Zahner, Germany). The optimization and frequency analyses were performed via DFT in the Gaussian16 program, the function was B3LYP-D3, and the def2SVP basis was performed for the non-metallic element, for a more accurate energy use the def2tzvp basis.

In situ GIWAX characterization
GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The wavelength of the X-ray beam was 1.24Å. We put a spin-coater with heating into a modified glove box and placed it in the X-ray equipment to make sure the X-ray detector could pick up the signals of the samples during the spin coating and subsequent annealing process. We first dropped the 4-BBAI solution on the 3D MHP, turned on the detector, and started the spin-coating process for 60 s; after the spin-coating, we immediately increased the substrate temperature to 100 °C (∼10 s) and held it for 30 s. To study the effect of moisture on the growth of 2D MHPs, we changed the environment of the spin-coating and annealing process by venting air or dry N2 into the glove box. Two-dimensional XRD patterns were acquired by a MarCCD with an exposure time of 3 s.
Solar cell performance testing
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured by a source meter (2400, Keithley, USA) at the scan speed of 100 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) generated by a solar simulator (Sol3A Class AAA, Oriel, Newport, USA) in air. The intensity was calibrated using an ISO-17025 standard calibrated reference silicon cell (91150V-KG3, Newport, USA). The active device area of PSCs during the measurements is 0.049 cm2 defined by a metal mask. Steady-state current/PCE outputs were measured using 2400 Source Meter at voltages determined from the MPPs of the reverse-scan J–V curves. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech).
Solar cell stability testing
Cyclic bend testing was performed at a bending radius of 4 mm, using a mechanical tester (PR-BDM-100, Puri, China) in constant-radius bending mode, in which the bending direction was convex (tension-only). Each bending cycle took 1–2 s, and the testing was interrupted periodically, where the J–V curves were regularly measured in air using the 2400 source meter at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) generated using a solar simulator (Sol3A Class AAA, Oriel, Newport, USA). Long-term stability test, UV light stability: 365 nm, 103 mW cm−2, 25 °C, 50% RH; thermal stability: 65 °C in the air; ambient stability: 25 °C, ∼80% RH.

Broader context
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) have great potential in various photovoltaic applications, while good mechanical reliability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) are both crucial for f-PSCs to be commercialized. Using 2D perovskites as a capping layer can effectively passivate the surface defects on 3D perovskites and alleviate non-radiative recombination, and meanwhile can increase the mechanical reliability of 3D perovskites in theory. But due to the complexity of surface reaction, the controllable formation of 2D perovskites on 3D perovskites, for example, with a controllable growth site, morphology, continuality, and mechanical strength, remains a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate that the polarity of ammonium salts and ambient moisture are two key factors governing the growth of 2D perovskites across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 3D perovskites to form “trans-GBs” structural 2D/3D perovskites, which enabled us to obtain f-PSCs with a high PCE and good mechanical reliability simultaneously. This study enriches our understanding of the key factors for precisely controlling the formation of a desired 2D/3D stacking perovskite and offers an essential strategy to advance the commercialization of f-PSCs further.
