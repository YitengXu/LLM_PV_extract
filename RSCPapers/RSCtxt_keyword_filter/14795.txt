    , Accepted 18th June 2018First published on 18th June 2018AbstractA new inorganic hole transporting layer, a sputtering made LiCoO2 film, was developed and used in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) and sub-module (PSM). The LiCoO2 film prepared by RF magnetron sputtering is composed of nano-sized particles and a superhydrophilic surface after treating it with UV–ozone, and therefore can be wetted evenly with a (MAI + PbI2)/(DMF + DMSO) precursor solution. By applying chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent, a very dense film with big perovskite grains was formed. After depositing the C60 electron transporting layer, BCP hole blocking layer and Ag electrode, the best perovskite solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19% with negligible current hysteresis. The high-efficiency cell is stable up to 90 °C in the inert atmosphere without encapsulation, and the PCE only decreases by 2% when the cell was heated at 100 °C for 30 minutes. When the cell was heated at 100 °C for 5 days, the PCE decreases by only 40%; nevertheless, under the same heating conditions, the efficiency of the PSC based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL is lost totally. The superhydrophilic surface of LiCoO2 made the even wetting of the large surface area with the perovskite precursor solution possible. Therefore the perovskite solar sub-module with an active area of 25.2 cm2 (on a 10 cm × 10 cm substrate) can be fabricated to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16% which was further verified to be 15%. The high-efficiency sub-module based on the LiCoO2 HTL also shows good thermal stability, and ca. 10% of the efficiency was lost by heating at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The development of new inorganic hole transporting layers for large area, thermally stable and highly efficient perovskite solar sub-modules closes the gap for their near-future market exploitation.
Introduction
Energy needs and environmental sustainability are the major problems our planet faces. Presently, over 85% of the world energy requirements are satisfied by non-renewable fossil fuels with concealed detrimental consequences on health and the environment. Moreover, the global energy demand is predicted to double by 2050. Solar energy is an alternative renewable energy resource to meet the global energy demands in the present scenario. The photovoltaic cell (PV) which can convert light (from sunlight) into electricity is one of the best choices to meet the global energy crisis due to its inexhaustible character and low pollution. However it is still expensive. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) emerged in the last decade with their power conversion efficiency exceeding 22%. A certified efficiency of 22.7% was achieved very recently.1 This high efficiency is due to the excellent properties of perovskite materials such as large absorption coefficient,2,3 direct band gap,4 low exciton binding energy,5 high charge carrier mobility,6 and long carrier diffusion lengths,7–9 and they can be fabricated using cheap solution processes.2,10–12 Therefore, PSCs could be the first non-expensive solar cells in the history of photovoltaic technology but are yet to reach commercialization.
In a p–i–n planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSC, which has the advantages of simple architecture and easy fabrication,13 PEDOT:PSS was used frequently as a hole transporting material (HTM), and PCBM was used as an electron transporting material (ETM). The resulting inverted cell generally has lower Voc compared to that with a regular n–i–p architecture.14 Furthermore, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS may deteriorate the device stability.15,16 The lack of confirmed stability at high temperature or high moisture, or under long-term light irradiation is the biggest barrier to commercialize PSCs. Searching for alternative stable HTMs is one of the active studies.17 Inorganic p-type semiconducting materials having the advantages of high hole mobility and thermal stability, wide band gap and high transparency in the visible region, low cost, various process methods and applicable valence band (VB) levels show promising prospects as the hole-selective contacts in perovskite solar cells. Moreover, for inverted PSCs, the HTL (hole transporting layer) must stand the strong solvents of the perovskite precursor solution such as DMF, GBL or DMSO. Therefore the low-solubility nature of solid state inorganic HTMs is also one of the advantages.
Several p-type inorganic materials such as NiO,18–20 doped NiO,21–24 MoO3,25 VOx,26 CuxO,27–29 CuSCN,30 CuI,31,32 PbS,33 CuGaO234 and CIGSS35 have been scrutinized, and two review articles were published very recently.36,37 Inverted PSCs based on some of the above inorganic HTMs exhibited efficiencies as high as those based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL (hole transporting layer).17–22,38 The possible reasons for the poor performance of some inorganic HTMs could be their low conductivity, difficulty to control their thickness to be within a few tens of nanometers to reduce the series resistance of the cell,39 and ineffective surface coverage on the electrode substrate,40 and how to deposit high quality perovskite films on them is not found yet. Here, we report the photovoltaic performance of a new inorganic HTL, lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) film prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, for an inverted PSC. We also found a facile way to deposit large area high quality MAPbI3 films on this new HTL to fabricate a perovskite solar sub-module (PSM). The PSC and PSM, based on the LiCoO2 HTL, C60 ETL, BCP hole blocking layer (HBL) and Ag electrode, achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 19% and 16%, respectively. The inverted PSC based on the LiCoO2 HTL has higher thermal stability compared to those using the PEDOT:PSS HTL.
LiCoO2 is a compound commonly used in the positive electrode (cathode) of lithium-ion batteries.41–43 It is a layered solid state material which consists of layers of lithium lying between the slabs of edge sharing CoO6 octahedra.44 LiCoO2 powder/crystals can be prepared from lithium and cobalt salts using the solution process45 or high-temperature solid state reaction.46 Nevertheless, in order to obtain a fully covered thin film, in this study LiCoO2 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering from the LiCoO2 target material. The advantages of preparing a thin film with RF magnetron sputtering are that the film is very pure, no target or substrate limitation and a fully covered, dense and good contact film at a couple of tens of nanometers thick can be made. Therefore, RF has been used to prepare ETLs47,48 and HTLs49,50 for perovskite solar cells and interlayers for perovskite containing tandem cells.51
The schematic representation for the fabrication of the LiCoO2 based inverted perovskite solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 1. On clean ITO glass, a thin layer of LiCoO2 was deposited as a hole transporting layer using RF magnetron sputtering. The MAPbI3 film was prepared by one-step spin-coating combined with anti-solvent engineering52 in a glove box. The ETL, HBL and electrode are deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum. The detailed device fabrication (including the sputtering parameters and the preparation of the perovskite film) can be found in the Method section. We explored the effect of the LiCoO2 thickness on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding PSC, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The thickness of LiCoO2 films to achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) is ca. 15–20 nm when the applied power of the sputtering process is fixed to 80 W. The next step to optimize the cell fabrication conditions is to fix the thickness of the LiCoO2 film to 18 nm and change the applied power, and the PCEs of the resulting cells are shown in Fig. 2(b). It was shown that even the thickness of the LiCoO2 HTL is the same, and the power applied to the target during the sputtering process affects the PCE of the resulting inverted PSC.

The differences between LiCoO2 films prepared by applying different powers were investigated using photoelectron spectra. Fig. S1 of the ESI† discloses that LiCoO2 films prepared by applying different powers have close HOMO energy levels. The absorption spectra displayed in Fig. S2(a), ESI† also suggests that the LiCoO2 film is very transparent and LCO-60 (LCO-x meaning LiCoO2 film sputtering deposited at an applied power of x W) and LCO-120 films have similar transparency, independent of the applied powers. The LiCoO2 film (18 nm) is too thin to get the observable X-ray diffraction peak using a Bruker D8 XRD diffractometer, and therefore 1 μm thick LiCoO2 prepared at 100 W applied power was tested (Fig. S2(b), ESI†) to prove that the films have the same phase as LiCoO2 reported in the literature.53 The SEM images displayed in Fig. 3 reveal that LiCoO2 films prepared by applying various powers have different surface morphologies. In general, the grain size of the film decreases as the applied power increases. Nevertheless, the LCO-60 film deposited at low power is not homogeneous, and some cliffs on the film are observed. On the other hand, the surface of the LCO-120 film is so smooth that almost no individual particles exist. LCO-80 and LCO-100 films are very flat with a grain size of 10–30 nm. The AFM images (displayed in Fig. 4) of the LCO-60 and LCO-100 films also reveal that the films are composed of 10–30 nm grains with a Root Mean Square (RMS) of 3.5 and 3.3 nm, respectively. The AFM images of the LiCoO2 films are consistent with what is observed in SEM that the LCO-60 film has some cliffs but the LCO-100 film is very flat and dense. The morphology of the LiCoO2 film did not significantly affect the morphology of the perovskite film deposited on it, although the SEM images (see Fig. S3, ESI†) show that the grain size of the perovskite films deposited on LCO-100 and LCO-120 seems slightly bigger than those of the other two films. The UV/Vis absorption spectra of perovskite/LCO-x displayed in Fig. S4(a), ESI† are similar, suggesting that the thicknesses of all the perovskite films are close to each other, which is further confirmed by surface profile-meter measurements to be around 350 nm. However, the PL spectra (illustrated in Fig. S4(b), ESI†) reveal that the luminescence intensities of LCO-80/perovskite and LCO-100/perovskite are much weaker than those of LCO-60/perovskite and LCO-120/perovskite, suggesting that the hole transport from the perovskite to LCO-80 and LCO-100 films is more efficient. The higher efficient hole transport may be attributed to the better contact between LiCoO2 and the MAPbI3 absorber. The surface of the LCO-100 film is very rough and therefore has a high surface area to come in contact with the perovskite film deposited on it. One can expect that good contact between the HTL and perovskite absorber may result in better photovoltaic performance of the corresponding cells. Therefore LCO-100 was used as an HTL for further device optimization since the perovskite film deposited on it has large grains and good contact with the HTL and good photovoltaic performance.

The solvent and concentration of the perovskite precursor solutions have an impact on the quality of the resulting films and therefore the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cells. In general, MAPbI3 has high solubility toward GBL/DMSO mixed solvent, and the quality of the spin-coated MAPbI3 films is more reproducible; nevertheless, a thinner perovskite film was obtained. On the other hand, a thick MAPbI3 film with good quality can be obtained when the solvent for the precursor solution is a DMF/DMSO mixture, but the anti-solvent dripping process should be controlled very precisely to get the reproducible result. Therefore, for testing the performance of new HTMs, mixed GBL/DMSO was typically used first as the solvent of the precursor to optimize the HTL and then switched to DMF/DMSO mixed solvent to enhance the PCE of the PSC. The photovoltaic parameters of the inverted PSCs based on the MAPbI3 films prepared from various concentrations of the DMF/DMSO precursor solutions using LiCoO2 or PEDOT:PSS as an HTL are summarized in Table 1. The efficiency of the cell based on the LCO-100 HTL increased as the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution increased, due to the increase in the thickness of the resulting perovskite film (see Table 1). The same tendency was observed when PEDOT:PSS was used as an HTM.54 The inverted PSC based on LCO-100 achieves a PCE of 19% when 1.45 M (MAI + PbI2)/(DMF + DMSO) was used as the precursor solution. The I–V curves (scanned in different directions, displayed in Fig. 5(a)) of the 19% cell exhibit negligible current hysteresis, and the integrated current (21.84 mA cm−2) from the IPCE curve (Fig. 5(b)) is very close to the Jsc obtained from the I–V measurements. The process to fabricate the high-efficiency cells is quite reproducible as the histograms of 32 cells illustrated in Fig. S5, ESI.† Using the same cell fabrication processes (without post solvent treatment of the MAPbI3 film), the inverted PSC based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL achieves a PCE of only 12.17% (see Table 1). Further increasing the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution above 1.45 M results in a lower PCE cell, due to the MAPbI3 film having a poorer quality since perovskite precipitates quickly.

In our previous study,54 a one-step coated MAPbI3 film on PEDOT:PSS can be heated at 100 °C for 10 minutes followed by DMF post solvent annealing for 10 minutes to enlarge the grain size up to 1 μm to enhance the PCE of the corresponding inverted PSC to 18%. Without DMF treatment of the MAPbI3 film, the efficiency of the cell is only ca. 10%, due to the film being composed of small perovskite grains. However, longer or shorter solvent annealing times all result in lower efficiency cells.54 The higher PCE of the inverted PSC based on the LCO-100 HTL compared to that using PEDOT:PSS as an HTL may be due to, without post solvent annealing, the MAPbI3 film deposited on LCO-100 having larger grains. Furthermore, the hole mobility of the HTL also affects the performance of the corresponding cell. The hole mobility of the LiCoO2 film measured using space charge limited current (SCLC) according to Mott–Gurney's law55 is ca. 1.83 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the I–V curve of the hole only device is illustrated in Fig. S6, ESI†) which is lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS film.56 Therefore the mobility of the HTL may not be the reason for the PSC based on the LiCoO2 HTL having higher efficiency compared to that using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. As expected, the SEM images of the perovskite films deposited on LCO-100 and PEDOT:PSS (Psk/CLO-100 and Psk/PEDOT:PSS, respectively) displayed in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively, reveal that under the same preparation conditions, without post solvent annealing, the MAPbI3 film deposited on LCO-100 has larger grains than that formed on the PEDOT:PSS surface. The perovskite film with 1 μm grains was formed on the LCO-100 HTL by only heating the spin-coated film at 60 °C for 30 seconds. On the other hand, the MAPbI3 film deposited on PEDOT:PSS has the biggest grain size of ca. 500 nm. We have tried to enlarge the grain size of the MAPbI3 film on LCO-100 using the optimal DMF annealing conditions of the MAPbI3 film coated on PEDOT:PSS. Surprisingly, instead of increasing the size of some perovskite grains as seen in the film deposited on PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6(b) and (d)), the MAPbI3 on the LCO-100 film was also damaged by the solvent, and some holes on the film were observed (see Fig. 6(c)). As a result, the PCE of the corresponding cell decreased.

The morphology of the perovskite film is very sensitive to the kinetics of the crystallite growth which depends on a large number of parameters, such as the surface of the substrate (interfacial energy), solvent, concentration, temperature and compositions of the perovskite precursor solution as well as the deposition method (including the type and amount of anti-solvent) and temperature. In general, rapid nucleation will lead to good film coverage but small grains. Slow crystal growth is a promising way to obtain large grains but rough films with some defects (such as pin-holes) may form. Therefore, improving the perovskite morphology and coverage through controlling the nucleation and growth during the film deposition via adding additives and annealing (such as thermal or solvent) of the film is an active study for device optimization.38,54,57–60 Nevertheless, using the surface properties of the substrate (HTL in case of the inverted PSC) to control the morphology of the perovskite film deposited on it is less studied. Bi et al.61 reported the deposition of perovskite films on various organic hole transporters with different hydrophobicities. They found that the grains of the perovskite film increased as the hydrophobicity of the HTL increases. Nevertheless, they also reported that although the hydrophobic surface of the HTL is good for the growth of large grains, forming continuous pinhole-free hydrophilic perovskite films on it is a challenge. Therefore the highest-efficiency PSC is not the cell based on the HTL having the highest hydrophobic surface. It is reasonable to suspect that the difference in the grain size of MAPbI3 depositing on LiCoO2 and PEDOT:PSS is due to the difference in the hydrophilicity of the substrate surface, since both perovskite films were prepared using the same precursor solution and film preparation conditions.
To obtain the surface hydrophilicity of the two types of HTLs, the water contact angle of the LCO-100 films (before and after UV/ozone treatment) was measured, and the results are displayed in Fig. S7, ESI.† The water contact angle measured here represents the wetting capability of the surfaces to water, which can be related to the wetting ability of the surface to other polar solvents such as DMF and DMSO used for preparing perovskite precursor solutions. The water contact angles of the LCO-100 films before and after ozone treatment are 30° and unmeasurable, respectively. Surprisingly the ozone treated LCO-100 film reveals a super-hydrophilic phenomenon with a contact angle (water wetting) less than 5°.62 In this paper, the LiCoO2 film was prepared by the RF sputtering method and then treated with UV–O3, and a nano-scale roughness surface was accidentally created to reach the superhydrophilic state.63 The superhydrophilic LiCoO2 surface makes the perovskite precursor solution disperse/wet evenly on it. Therefore less precursor solution is needed compared to those used in the PEDOT:PSS HTL.38,54,60 When the perovskite precursor solution spreads evenly on the LiCoO2 HTL, after applying chloro-benzene anti-solvent, larger MAPbI3 grains were formed without long-term heating or solvent annealing. On the other hand the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution on PEDOT:PSS is less even compared to that on the LiCoO2 surface, and smaller MAPbI3 grains were produced when the anti-solvent is applied as illustrated in Fig. 7. Furthermore, chloro-benzene is a low polarity solvent, it will not adsorb on the LiCoO2 film and evaporate quickly. Therefore the resulting perovskite films have large grains and good contact with the HTL as seen from the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 8(a). As mentioned in the previous paragraph, DMF post solvent annealing of the MAPbI3 film on the LiCoO2 HTL results in the decrease in the PCE of the corresponding cell. The SEM surface morphology displayed in Fig. 6(c) revealed that although few grains were enlarged some holes were also formed on the film after solvent annealing. The SEM cross-sectional image (see Fig. 8(b)) shows that the perovskite film peels off from the LiCoO2 coated substrate after DMF treatment. This is due to the strong interaction between DMF and the superhydrophilic surface of the LiCoO2 film. On the other hand, DMF has weaker interaction with PEDOT:PSS than with LiCoO2, and DMF treatment results in bigger perovskite grains, still keeping the good interphase contact between the absorber and HTL as seen from the SEM images in Fig. 8(c) and (d). The contact angle, SEM and PCE data indicate that the surface properties of the HTL significantly affect the quality of the perovskite film and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PSC. It is interesting to note here that Bi et al.61 found that the grains of the perovskite film increased as the hydrophobicity of the HTL increases when the HTLs are all very hydrophobic (large contact angle) organic compounds with a flat surface. However, we found that when hydrophilic metal oxides were used as the HTM, a rough surface and smaller contact are more suitable to prepare good contact MAPbI3 films with big grains. This is due to the high surface area of the rough HTL and good dispersion of the perovskite precursor solution on a very hydrophilic surface.

One of the big advantages of using metal oxide hole transporters in inverted PSCs is that the inorganic solid state material generally has good thermal stability and is inert to the solvent of the precursor solution and perovskite absorber. The thermal stability test was performed by heating the inverted cells without encapsulation at various temperatures for 5 days in the glove box. It was proved previously54 that the long-term stability of the inverted PSC (using PEDOT:PSS as an HTL) depends on the grain size of the perovskite absorber. Therefore for fair comparison, the thermal stability test was performed on the inverted PSCs based on Psk/LCO-100 and Psk/PEDOT:PSS as well as SAPsk/PEDOT:PSS (SAPsk: DMF post treated MAPbI3 film with 1 μm-sized grains). The thermal stability data illustrated in Fig. 9(a) reveal that the inverted PSC based on the LiCoO2 HTM can stand up to 90 °C (without efficiency loss), and the PCE only decreases by 2% when the cell was heated at 100 °C for 30 minutes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a perovskite solar cell with thermal stability up to 90 °C is reported. On the other hand, when heated at 90 °C, 20% and 12% of PCEs were lost for the cells based on Psk/PEDOT:PSS and SAPsk/PEDOT:PSS, respectively. When the cell based on SAPsk/PEDOT:PSS was heated at 100 °C for 30 minutes, 20% of the efficiency is lost and the grain size of SAPsk on PEDOT:PSS is close to that of the perovskite film on LiCoO2 HTL. Furthermore, after heating at 100 °C, the SAPsk/PEDOT:PSS cell lost all of the PCE in 3 days; nevertheless, the cell based on Psk/LiCoO2 still has 60% of the initial efficiency after heating for 5 days according to the data listed in Fig. 9(b). The good thermal stability of the LiCoO2 based inverted PSC could be due to the high thermal stability of the HTL, big perovskite grains and good contact between the LiCoO2 and MAPbI3 films.
 Fig. 9  The thermal stability test on the inverted PSCs based on the LiCoO2 or the PEDOT:PSS HTL without encapsulation (the heating time is 30 minutes in a glove box). 
Furthermore, one of the important skills to fabricate large-area perovskite films on a flat surface by a spin-coating method (or other wet chemical methods) from the concentrated precursor solution is to quickly disperse an appropriate amount of solution on the HTL evenly. The superhydrophilic surface of the LiCoO2 film made the wetting of the large area surface by a perovskite precursor solution easy, and a large FF of 0.80 of the corresponding cell suggests that up-scaling the perovskite/LiCoO2 film to achieve a high efficiency sub-module is possible. Therefore the same method was used to fabricate perovskite films on a 10 cm × 10 cm patterned substrate, and the I–V curve of the corresponding sub-module with an active area of 25.2 cm2 (see method section) is displayed in Fig. 10(a). The highest-efficiency inverted perovskite sub-module achieves a PCE of 16% with an FF of 0.80 and average Voc of 0.99 V. The device fabrication process is highly reproducible as the histograms of 35 sub-modules illustrated in Fig. S8, ESI.† The standard deviation is only 0.45%. The thermal stability of the sub-module without encapsulation was also tested in the glove box, and the results are displayed in Fig. 10(b). The sub-module also shows good thermal stability up to 70 °C, and only ca. 10% of the efficiency is lost by heating at 100 °C for 30 minutes, only slightly lower than that of the small-area cell. For confirming the photovoltaic performance, the PCE of the sub-module was verified further to be 15% by the PV Efficiency Verification Lab in National Central University (the report is displayed in Fig. S9, ESI†).

In conclusion, we reported a new highly transparent inorganic hole transporting material, LiCoO2, for the inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) and sub-module (PSM). The LiCoO2 film with a nano-scale surface morphology was prepared using RF magnetron sputtering with controlled applied voltage. The UV/ozone treated LiCoO2 film exhibits a super-hydrophilic surface which can be wetted easily by (MAI + PbI2)/(DMF + DMSO) precursor solution and therefore requires less perovskite solution compared to that required for wetting an equal area of the PEDOT:PSS surface. A fully covered, good contact, and dense MAPbI3 film with large grains was formed after adding anti-solvent with no thermal or solvent annealing. The inverted PSC having the architecture of ITO/LiCoO2/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Ag achieves a high PCE of 19%. This high-efficiency cell is stable up to 90 °C, and only 40% of the initial efficiency was lost when it was continuously heated at 100 °C for 5 days in the inert atmosphere. The super-hydrophilic surface of LiCoO2 made the wetting of a large area film with a perovskite precursor solution possible. The perovskite sub-module having an active area of 25.2 cm2 on a 10 cm × 10 cm substrate with thermal stability up to 70 °C was fabricated and a PCE of 15% was verified. High efficiency, large-area device, good thermal stability and simple fabrication process make the non-expensive PSC potentially lead to a broad and rapid industrial uptake.
Method
The chemicals, the post solvent annealing of the perovskite films, and the methods and instruments used to obtain the physicochemical properties of the materials in this study are similar to what we reported54 before unless otherwise specified. The photoelectron spectra used to estimate the HOMO level of LiCoO2 were measured with an AC-2 instrument (RKI instruments, Riken Keiki, Model AC-2). The thermal stability of the inverted PSCs was tested by heating them at various temperatures for 30 minutes in a glove box without encapsulation. Hole mobility was measured according to a method based on the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model described in the literature,64,65 using a diode configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Au. The SCLC current was measured under dark conditions using a Keithley Model 2400 unit. The slope of the J vs. V curve was used to calculate the hole mobility.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements: LiCoO2 thin films were deposited on cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates (Ritek Corp.,15 Ω sq−1) with an RF magnetron sputtering system (Syskey Technology Co., Ltd. Taiwan, model SKE103004) from a LiCoO2 target (obtained from Ultimate Materials Technology Co., Taiwan). The distance between the target and the substrate was approximately 50 mm. Prior to deposition, the chamber was evacuated to a basic pressure around 5 × 10−6 torr. The RF sputtering processes were performed in pure Ar with the sccm (Standard Cubic Centimeter per Minute) of 200. The thickness of LiCoO2 films was controlled by the powers applied on the target and deposition times after carefully calibrating in advance. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO substrate from its aqueous solution at 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Before depositing the perovskite film, the HTL was treated with UV/ozone for 10 minutes. Equal moles of PbI2 and MAI were mixed and dissolved in two solvent systems (GBL/DMSO (5:5, v/v) or DMF/DMSO (4:6, v/v)) and then stirred overnight in a glove box to make the perovskite precursor solutions with various concentrations. MAPbI3 films were prepared with one-step spin-coating using various spin rates and times plus anti-solvent dripping in a glove box similar to processes reported in the literature.52 The resulting perovskite films were heated at various temperatures for various times and then put into a high vacuum chamber. 50 nm C60, 5 nm BCP, and 100 nm Ag were deposited via thermal evaporation to be the electron-transporting layer, hole blocking layer and electrode, respectively, for an inverted perovskite solar cell. Specifically, in this study, MAPbI3 films for the highest PCE cells based on LiCoO2 were fabricated with the concentration of PbI2 and MAI equal to 1.45 M (in DMF/DMSO (4:6, v/v)) using 45 μL perovskite precursor solutions under the spin coating conditions of 1000 rpm for 10 s, and then 4000 rpm for 20 s, and at the last second, 50 μL chlorobenzene was dripped on the film. The resulting MAPbI3 film was heated at 60 °C for 30 s without further thermal or solvent annealing. The PSC based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL was fabricated under the same conditions and process except 50 μL precursor solution was used to fabricate perovskite films via spin-coating. DMF treatment of the perovskite films was carried out with the method we reported previously.54 All the fabrication procedures, except the deposition of PEDOT:PSS, were carried out in a nitrogen filled glove box. The active area of a small cell is 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm (on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm patterned substrate). The solar cell was covered with a defined mask and its I–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 source measuring unit under simulated AM1.5G light (Wacom solar simulator) at 100 mW cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air after sealing the device with a silica sealant and measuring immediately. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for phase sensitive detection with a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Inc., Taiwan). The large area sub-modules were fabricated basically with the same steps as the small area cell except the substrate was enlarged from 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm (containing 4 small cells with dimensions of 0.2 cm × 0.5 cm) to 10.0 cm × 10.0 cm (connecting 9 cells in series with the active area of each cell equal to 0.4 cm × 7.0 cm) with our designed pattern (displayed in Fig. S10, ESI†)38 using 3 mL perovskite precursor solution and 5 mL anti-solvent (CB) under the same spin coating conditions used to prepare perovskite films for the highest-efficiency small cell. The determination of the photovoltaic parameters and the calibration of all measuring facilities for all perovskite solar cells and sub-modules are the same as what we reported previously.38 The efficiency verification of the UV-glue packed sub-module was performed by the PV Efficiency Verification Lab (PVEVL) in NCU.
