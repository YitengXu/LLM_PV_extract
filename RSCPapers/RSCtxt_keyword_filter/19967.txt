    , Accepted 1st October 2012First published on 2nd October 2012AbstractCore–shell (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) have many applications in areas such as catalysis and sensing. The utilization of hollow nanostructured materials as the supports, such as nanotubes (NT), is a growing interest to anchor NPs. Generally, several steps are necessary to prepare CS NP–NT nanocomposites, including: (i) the synthesis of CS NPs; (ii) the preparation of NTs; and (iii) the combination of CS NPs and NTs. Moreover, surface modifications with organic ligands are often involved during the synthesis of CS NPs and/or the step combining CS NPs and supports. Here we report a facile method for in situ growth of Au@CeO2 CS NPs and CeO2 NTs by mixing HAuCl4 and Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods under mild conditions. The formation of Au–CeO2 nanocomposite is due to the interfacial oxidation–reduction reaction between HAuCl4 and Ce(OH)CO3, where Au(III) in HAuCl4 is reduced to Au(0) by Ce(III) in Ce(OH)CO3, while Ce(III) is oxidized into Ce(IV), followed by hydrolysis to generate CeO2. The slow hydrolysis rate of Ce(IV) leads to the coverage of CeO2 on the Au NPs, and on the residual Ce(OH)CO3 surface, developing into Au@CeO2 and Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS structures. Further depletion/dissolution of Ce(OH)CO3 results in Au@CeO2 CS NP–CeO2 NT nanocomposite eventually. The advantages of our synthetic strategy are independent of foreign reducing agents and additional surface modification. And, such CS NP–NT nanocomposite can be obtained in one step, simplifying the synthesis procedures greatly. This method based on interfacial oxidation–reduction may be employed as a unique entry to other nanocomposites.
Introduction
Assembling several materials to form nanocomposites is an attractive way to design systems processing diverse physical and/or chemical properties.1–4 In nanocomposites, such as CS structures, one can expect promising properties, which are quite distinct from single components due to their collective interaction. For example, Au@TiO2 CS hollow spheres exhibit a 30% increase in power conversion efficiency when that are used as the photoanodes of dye sensitized solar cells.5 Pt@CeO2 nanocomposites display some superior catalytic properties over current catalyst systems for water gas shift reactions due to the encapsulation of Pt.6 To date, significant progress has been made in the synthesis of CS NPs.7–10 The general strategy to synthesize CS NPs is relatively complicated, including first preparing NPs with one material, and then employing them as nucleation seeds to deposit the second components. Moreover, to stabilize the NPs during the synthesis, organic agents (e.g. polymers, surfactants) are widely used, which leads to the coverage of NPs' surface with these stabilizing molecules. As a result, to fully expose the NPs' surface in the catalysis, the removal of the stabilizing agents is necessary, but difficult.11 In addition, surface modifications are typically required to effectively link the core and the shell.9 Therefore, simplifying synthesis is an area of interest for further studying CS NPs' properties and enhancing their widespread applications.
Among various support materials, hollow structured ones are deemed as potentially good candidates for catalyst supports, since the hollow geometry provides a high specific surface area, favoring a better dispersion of metal NPs.12–17 So far, various approaches have been developed to fabricate hollow nanostructures, among which, the template method is commonly used.13,15,18–20 Regarding this method, template selection and the chemical purity are critical. For example, the templates should be easily removed by either washing or heat-treatment on condition that the shell doesn't collapse during the template removal. Furthermore, particular physical–chemical properties of the templates and products need to be taken into account in some interfacial reactions. In our previous studies, we chose Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods as the template and successfully fabricated three types of CeO2 NTs and CePO4:Tb NTs through interfacial reactions.20–22 Thanks to the unique properties of Ce(OH)CO3, the template can be easily removed by acid washing or calcination, which is responsible for the formation of CeO2 and CePO4:Tb NTs. Meanwhile, the solubility products of Ce(OH)3 and CePO4 are smaller than that of Ce(OH)CO3, which is a key factor for transforming Ce(OH)CO3 into Ce(OH)3 and CePO4. It should be noted that there are no valence changes (i.e. no oxidation–reduction reactions are involved) for the participating species in these specific reactions. Considering the reduction ability of Ce(III), these highly interesting Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod templates may be further employed in the oxidation–reduction reactions with oxidizing agents to form nanocomposite structures.
Most recently, Ce–Mn binary oxide NTs were prepared by the oxidation–reduction of Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods with KMnO4. MnO4− is reduced to manganese oxide, and the Ce(III) is simultaneously oxidized to Ce(IV), followed by hydrolysis to form CeO2.23 Due to a certain degree of reducibility of the Ce(III) oxide, noble-metal ions (e.g. Au, Pd) could be reduced into metallic NPs to develop into noble-metal NP–CeO2 nanocomposites.24 It gives us a hint that there is a possibility to reduce noble-metal ions to metal NPs by Ce(OH)CO3.
It is worth remembering that the Ce(IV) ions are more inclined to be hydrolyzed to CeO2, which is expected to deposit in situ on the residual Ce(OH)CO3 surface to form a shell.23 In this case, CeO2 NTs can be prepared after the removal of the residual Ce(OH)CO3 with acid. In addition, CeO2 will very likely cover the pre-formed metal NPs in the form of metal NPs@CeO2 CS structure, provided that the hydrolysis of Ce(IV) lags behind the formation of metal NPs. If so, such complex nanocomposite involving CS structured NPs supported on NTs can be prepared by a simple redox reaction.
Recently, great efforts have been made to synthesize noble-metal@CeO2 CS NPs since such CS structure not only stabilizes the metal NPs against sintering but also gives rise to novel properties resulting from the maximum interaction between the NPs surface and the support.6,25–35 Microemulsion approach6,28 or controlled hydrolysis25,26 were carried out to deposit CeO2 on the pre-synthesized noble metal NPs with surface modifications. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of Au@CeO2 CS NPs supported on CeO2 NTs through an in situ redox reaction between HAuCl4 and Ce(OH)CO3. Neither additional reducing agents nor stabilizing molecules are employed during the whole preparation. The detailed formation mechanism is discussed in this paper.
Experimental section
Materials
Cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate, urea, sodium hydroxide, tetrachloroauric acid, nitric acid were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
Synthesis of Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod template
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (4 mmol) and urea (24 mmol) were added to 80 mL of water under vigorous magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 24 h. The as-obtained powder sample was centrifuged, washed with distilled water and dried.
Synthesis of Au@CeO2 CS NP–CeO2 NT nanocomposite
In a typical synthesis, 30 mg of as-prepared Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods were dispersed in 6 mL of HAuCl4 solution (3 mM) under stirring. The mixture was kept at 90 °C for 2 h, followed by washing with HNO3 (1 M), water, and ethanol in sequence. The as-obtained sample was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. To help us understand its formation mechanism, we also treated Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods or CeO2 NTs instead of Ce(OH)CO3 with HAuCl4 under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The synthesis procedures followed our previous paper.21
Synthesis of Au–CeO2 NT and Au–CeO2 nanorod nanocomposites
The Au NPs with around 20 nm were prepared by sodium citrate reduction of HAuCl4.36 CeO2 nanorods were obtained by calcinations of Ce(OH)CO3 at 650 °C for 2 h. The Au–CeO2 NT (or nanorod) nanocomposites were fabricated by mixing the as-prepared Au NPs with CeO2 NTs (or nanorods) under vigorous stirring for 1 h, followed by centrifugation and drying.
Characterization
The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Japan Rigaku D/Max-γA rotating anode X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1 in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°. The morphology and structure of Au@CeO2 CS NP–CeO2 NT nanocomposite were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 6300, 100 kV), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEM-2100, 200 kV), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6700F, 3 kV) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford INCA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on a ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a standard Al Kα source. The charging of the samples was corrected by referencing all of the energies to the C 1s peak energy set at 285.1 eV, arising from adventitious carbon. Optical absorption spectra were taken with a Varian 5000 spectrophotometer.
Catalytic test
Catalytic activity was measured using a continuous flow fixed-bed micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, the system was first purged with high purity N2 gas and then a gas mixture of CO/O2/N2 (1:10:89) was introduced into the reactor which contained 50 mg of samples. Gas samples were analyzed with an online infrared gas analyzer (Gasboard-3121, China Wuhan Cubic Co.) which simultaneously detects CO and CO2 with a resolution of 10 ppm. The results were further confirmed with a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (GC-14C).
Results and discussion
Structural and compositional characterization
Since XPS is sensitive to the oxidation state of a given element, we first used XPS to determine the valence states of Ce and Au after the interfacial reaction. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Ce 3d electron core level is characterized by two series of peaks: 3d5/2 and 3d3/2. The peaks labeled “V” are characteristic of Ce 3d5/2, and those labelled “U” pertain to Ce 3d3/2. The signals of U, U1, V, V1, characteristic of Ce(III), exist in the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods, while the peaks labeled U, U2, U3 and V, V2, V3, characteristic of Ce(IV) are observed in the as-prepared sample.37 In the case of Au4f core level spectrum (Fig. 1b), the Au 4f peaks show a doublet at 83.6 and 87.6 eV corresponding to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively, suggesting that Au is mainly present in Au0 state. The XPS results provide strong evidence that an oxidation–reduction reaction indeed occurs between the HAuCl4 and the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods. The co-existence of Ce and Au in the as-prepared sample was also supported by EDS measurements, which yields the atomic ratio of Ce:Au ≅ 6:1 (Fig. S1†). XRD characterization was performed to study the phase of the as-prepared sample. As shown in Fig. 1c, there are no diffraction peaks of Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods, and all diffraction peaks can be well indexed to CeO2 with a cubic fluorite structure (JCPDS 34-0394) and Au with a face-centered structure (JCPDS 65-2870), respectively. Fig. 1d shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the as-obtained sample dispersed in ethanol. The strong absorption band with a maximum around 360 nm is due to charge-transfer transitions from O 2p to Ce 4f in CeO2. Interestingly, an adsorption band indexed to Au centred at 600 nm exhibits red-shift compared with Au NPs reported in the literature (see explanation below). All these characterizations demonstrate that a CeO2–Au nanocomposite is prepared by simply mixing Ce(OH)CO3 and HAuCl4.

TEM images of the as-prepared sample are displayed in Fig. 2a and S2.† The sharp contrast between the edge and centre parts of these one-dimensional structures is characteristic of an NT morphology. The as-prepared NT inherits the shape and dimensions of the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod template.20–23 Most of the NTs have diameters of 300–350 nm, with typical wall thickness of around 40 nm. Many NPs with 40–50 nm in diameter are supported on the NT. Fig. S3† are SEM images of the as-prepared sample, which show some NPs supported on the NTs' surface, and exhibit a hollow interior of a tubular structure. To further study the local composition and detailed morphology of the NPs, the structural details are revealed by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2b, the supported NP in Fig. 2a holds CS structure, with a rounded NP (∼18 nm) as the core and irregular, faceted nanocrystals as the shell. Fig. 2c is STEM image corresponding to frame in Fig. 2b. In STEM mode, as the intensity of the scattered electrons is proportional to the square of the atomic number of the probed element, the element with higher atomic number will appear much brighter. Herein, since the atomic number of Au (Z = 79) is higher than that of Ce (Z = 58), the brighter particles in Fig. 2c are Au NPs and the less bright parts in the NTs wall and the shell of the CS structured NP should be CeO2. The measured d spacing of 0.23 nm (Fig. 2f) in the centre of the round particle (Fig. 2d) is assigned to the lattice spacing of the (111) plane of Au. The interlayer distances of 0.27 nm (Fig. 2e and g) in the outer region (shell) of the round NP and NT wall can be indexed with certainty to the lattice spacing of the (200) of CeO2. The FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) pattern of the lattice fringes of the largest square (Fig. 2d) nicely indexes them to CeO2 and Au structures, respectively.

STEM-EDX mapping provides direct elemental distribution in a fine structure. As shown in Fig. 3b–d, we observe that Ce and O are simultaneously distributed in the wall of the NT and the shell of supported NPs, whereas the Au signal dominantly appears in the core of the NPs. Due to the Au@CeO2 CS structure, the coating of CeO2 strongly affects Au surface plasmon resonance (SPR). It is well known that Au NPs ranging from 3 to 20 nm exhibit SPR absorption at around 520 nm. However, CeO2, a dielectric material, with higher refractive index (2.2) than that of Au (0.47), leads to a SPR peak shift to about 600 nm (Fig. 1d), which is in good agreement with that paper reported.1

To understand the formation mechanism of the Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT nanocomposite, the evolution process was examined at different reaction time. Although Ce(OH)CO3 can be dissolved in an acidic environment, the acidity of HAuCl4 is not strong enough to totally dissolve Ce(OH)CO3 within short time. Therefore, there is a slow dissolution process occurring between Ce(OH)CO3 and HAuCl4. When the reaction time is shorter than 30 min, the surface of Ce(OH)CO3 becomes rough and concave due to the HAuCl4 etching. In addition, there is a similar contrast within the whole supported NP (Fig. 4a and b). As the reaction time extends to 60 min, it is rather remarkable that a partial hollowing appears in the interior space. Furthermore, supported NPs exhibit a clear CS structure, reflected in the contrast of brightness and the faceted shape (Fig. 4c and d). After 90 min, the feature of the NT with sharp contrast between wall and interior space is observed. And the supported NPs with CS structure are well developed (Fig. 4e and f).

The temperature effect on the final structure was also studied while keeping other parameters constant. As shown in Fig. 5, when the temperature was set at 30 °C, the supported NPs, as well as the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod have a clean surface (Fig. 5a and b). At 60 °C, although the CS structure of the supported NPs is not fully achieved, holes in the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod due to HAuCl4 corrosion are observed (Fig. 5c and d). When the temperature was increased to 100 °C, the CS NPs and NT are well shaped. Compared with the sample prepared at 90 °C, both the wall of NTs and the shell of the CS NPs become thicker (Fig. 5e and f).

Based on the above results, we propose that, at the initial stage, HAuCl4 dissolves Ce(OH)CO3 slowly, resulting in the release of Ce(III) ions. Since Ce(III) has a certain reducing ability, it can reduce AuCl4− into metallic Au, and the oxidation of Ce(III) leads to the formation of Ce(IV) simultaneously. The newly produced Au nucleates in situ and grows on the surface of the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods. As demonstrated above, a lower reaction temperature and a shorter reaction time are unfavorable for the hydrolysis of Ce(IV) ions, resulting in the formation of CeO2 lags behind that of Au NPs. Therefore, the formed CeO2 deposits on the Au NP surface and on the Ce(OH)CO3 surface as well. Initially, a thin shell of CeO2 protects the residual Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods. Further reaction between HAuCl4 and Ce(OH)CO3 depends on the ion diffusion through the shell. The presence of some uncompleted NTs with a half solid core supports this hypothesis (Fig. 6a and b). It is also noted that, with a continuous reaction, the pH value of the initial reaction solution (∼2.5) is gradually increased to ∼4.5 after reaction due to the release of OH− ions from the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods,23 which in turn accelerates the hydrolysis of Ce(IV) ions. In contrast, when the Ce(NO3)3 and HAuCl4 were mixed and heated at 90 °C, there was no CeO2 and Au NP formation, possibly due to the lower pH value and the absence of heterogeneous nucleation sites. To further study the formation mechanism, Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods were replaced with Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods and pre-synthesized CeO2 NTs, respectively, to react with HAuCl4. As shown in Fig. 6c, the CeO2 NTs' surface is still smooth and no Au NPs are observed on the NTs when pre-synthesized CeO2 NTs were used. Since pre-synthesized CeO2 NTs were derived from Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods by dissolution of Ce(OH)CO3 with HNO3, the surface features of the Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods remain the same as the pre-synthesized CeO2 NTs, i.e. a smooth surface is observed. However, after the reaction between Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods and HAuCl4, the as-formed Au NPs and the hollow interior space developed (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, the surface becomes rough, further demonstrating that the newly formed CeO2 deposits on the nanorods surface. The developed hollow space also supports its formation, resulting from the dissolution of Ce(OH)CO3 by HAuCl4. The whole process of the synthesis of Au@CeO2 CS NP–CeO2 NT nanocomposite is illustrated in Scheme 1.

(c and d) are TEM images of the obtained-samples when Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods were replaced by pre-synthesized CeO2 NTs and Ce(OH)CO3@CeO2 CS nanorods under the same experimental conditions.

CO oxidation over CeO2 supported Au NP catalyst has been extensively studied due to its scientific and industrial importance.25,26,38 Herein, CO oxidation catalyzed by the Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT nanocomposite is performed. For comparison, the catalytic activities of Au–CeO2 NTs, Au–CeO2 nanorods with same atomic ratio (Ce:Au = 6:1), CeO2 NTs, and commercially available CeO2 particles are also determined in parallel. Au–CeO2 NTs and Au–CeO2 nanorods were prepared according to the reported methods as presented in the experimental section, while the structure and morphologies were demonstrated by TEM observation as shown in Fig. S4.† The overall light-off curves for CO oxidation are presented in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Catalytic activities of Au@CeO2 NP–CeO2 NT (a), Au–CeO2 NT (b), and Au–CeO2 nanorod (c) nanocomposite, and CeO2 NTs (d) and commercial CeO2 particles (e). 
It is shown that all Au–CeO2 nanocomposites exhibit higher activity than that of individual CeO2 due to the existence of Au. As well acknowledged, synergistic effect of Au and CeO2 should be responsible for such superior catalytic activity, since CeO2 has abundant oxygen vacancy defects, high oxygen storage capacity and the relatively easy shuttles between the III and IV oxidation states, giving rise to the enhanced rates of the oxidation reaction.40 While for the three kinds of Au–CeO2 nanocomposites, the hollow structure of CeO2 NTs definitely favors the better contact with the gas molecule owing to the existence of interior spaces and penetrable shell, leading to higher activity in comparison to that of solid CeO2 nanorods. Comparing the catalytic activity of the Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT with that of the Au–CeO2 NT nanocomposites, it is interesting to find that, although CeO2 coverage can substantially reduce Au exposure in the former, the catalytic activity of Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT nanocomposites is even higher than that of Au–CeO2 NT ones. This discrepancy of the catalytic activity may indicate of a stronger synergistic interaction between CeO2 and Au due to the maximum contact between these two components, which may compensate for the loss of partially covered Au NP activity.6,25
Other than the improved catalytic activity, the CS structure is also expected to prevent the NPs from sintering at high temperature, thus maintaining its catalytic performance, which is quite important but still a bottleneck problem for practical application.40 To demonstrate that the CS structure is highly advantageous for the thermal stability of the Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT nanocomposites, we also performed recycling catalytic tests for Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT sample and the Au NPs–CeO2 NT one. The results are supplied and compared in Fig. 8. As shown from the results of the recycling catalytic tests, the Au@CeO2 CS–CeO2 NT sample still retains high catalytic activity during the 2nd and 3rd run, even better than that of the 1st run, possibly due to the increase in surface-active oxygen sites upon high-temperature treatment in the 1st run.39 TEM observation reveals that after 3rd catalysis reactions, both Au@CeO2 CS structure and NT retain their original morphology very well (Fig. S5a†), suggesting that the CS structure protects the Au NPs from aggregation at high temperature. In contrast, the catalytic activity of the Au NP–CeO2 NT sample clearly deteriorates after the 1st run. The inferior catalytic activity of Au–CeO2 NT sample is mainly caused by the presence of citrate capping agent employed in the synthesis of Au NPs, while the migration and sintering of Au NPs are responsible for the deactivation behavior during the 2nd and 3rd run, which is confirmed by increased size of Au NPs after catalysis tests (Fig. S5b†).40

Conclusions
We have developed a facile method for direct synthesis of Au@CeO2 CS NP–CeO2 NT nanocomposite without any foreign reducing agents or stabilizing molecules. Thanks to an effective metal-support contact, the as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits good catalytic activity and thermal stability toward CO oxidation. The Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod template plays a vital role for the formation of this kind of Au–CeO2 nanocomposite, because of the unique features of Ce(OH)CO3: (a) Ce(III) with certain reduction ability enables the in situ reaction with HAuCl4; (b) the as-formed Ce(IV) ions easily undergo hydrolysis to produce CeO2, which preferentially deposits on the Ce(OH)CO3 nanorod surface; (c) Ce(OH)CO3 can be dissolved by HAuCl4, which is the prerequisite for the formation of a hollow interior space; (d) residual Ce(OH)CO3 can be also dissolved by inorganic acid (e.g. HNO3) whereas the Au and CeO2 cannot. This work represents a demonstration of an interfacial oxidation–reduction-engaged process capable of synthesizing CS NP–NT nanocomposite. When suitable templates and oxidation–reduction pairs are chosen, this method is expected to be implemented for the fabrication of other noble metal–metal oxide nanocomposites.
