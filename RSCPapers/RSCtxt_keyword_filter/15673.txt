    , Accepted 7th February 2019First published on 18th February 2019AbstractSemiconductors based on tin(II) show promising hole-transport characteristics due to the 5s electrons that form the valence band. In this paper, we report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of tin(II) thiocyanate [Sn(NCS)2] and identify it as a novel transparent coordination polymer semiconductor. The single crystal X-ray analysis reveals covalently-bonded 1D polymeric chains that form a 2D structure through Sn–S tetrel bonds. Density functional theory calculations also confirm the importance of the van der Waals interactions between the 2D sheets. Furthermore, we show that the s character of Sn(II) is maintained at the top of the valence band, resulting in dispersed states with a small hole effective mass. The coordination with NCS ligands also leads to a conduction band which is high in energy, giving rise to a wide band gap and excellent transparency in the visible spectrum. This is the first report on the electronic properties of Sn(NCS)2 which highlights the potential of developing new transparent semiconductors based on thiocyanate coordination polymers.
1. Introduction
Transparent electron-transporting (or n-type) oxides, such as ZnO, In2O3, and In–Ga–Zn–O (IGZO), consistently display excellent electrical performance due to their highly dispersive conduction bands (CBs), consisting primarily of the metal ns orbitals which are strongly coupled and delocalized even in the amorphous state.1,2 On the other hand, hole transport in metal oxides is generally hampered by strong localization of the O 2p states at the top of the valence bands (VBs), resulting in highly stable states which are low in energy and dispersionless, i.e., having deep energy levels and small hole effective masses.3 This leads to difficulties in generating carriers (holes) either by current injection or chemical doping as well as limited hole mobility. One strategy to tackle this issue is to find cations with suitable valence states that can hybridize effectively with O 2p to push the VB edge higher in energy (i.e., lower ionization energy, IE) as well as to disperse the states at the top of the VB. Copper in the +1 oxidation state [Cu(I)] with 3d10 valence electrons is one such cation, and various Cu(I)-based compounds have been explored for p-type conductivity, such as cuprous oxide Cu2O, delafossites CuMO2 (M = Group 13), and oxychalcogenides LaCuOX (X = S, Se, or Te).3–6 Nevertheless, their practical applications in electronic devices have been limited.7
Expanding beyond oxides, copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) is another promising transparent p-type inorganic semiconductor. Recently, its opto/electronic applications have been extensively demonstrated from active semiconducting channel layers in thin-film transistors (TFTs)8,9 to transparent hole-transport layers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs),10 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),11 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).12,13 These demonstrations are highly remarkable given that CuSCN is a coordination polymer, a family of materials that have been largely unexplored for electronic applications. The unique properties of CuSCN are enabled by the electronic structure based on the interactions of Cu(I) and the molecular SCN ligand. In particular, the top of its VB retains the Cu 3d dominant character similar to other p-type Cu(I)-based compounds with some hybridization with the S 3p states that allows for attractive hole-transporting characteristics with the field-effect hole mobility in the range of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and higher.14 On the other hand, the CB of CuSCN, consisting largely of the antibonding molecular orbital (MO) of the anionic SCN ligand,15 is high in energy, giving rise to excellent transparency in the visible spectrum.
However, material systems based on metal ns2 valence states also present strong potential for hole transport, in particular tin in the +2 oxidation state [Sn(II)]. SnO has been intensively explored as an active channel layer in p-type oxide TFTs recently, and field-effect mobilities in excess of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been reported in several publications.7 Similar to electron-transporting oxides, the s electrons are more easily delocalized due to their spherical symmetry, hence more dispersion in the VB and larger hole mobility is expected.16 Nevertheless, two serious disadvantages of SnO remain: phase instability and a small fundamental band gap. SnO is metastable under ambient conditions with SnO2 being the more thermodynamically favorable phase; SnO films typically contain mixed phases, which are detrimental to charge carrier transport.17–19 Furthermore, the fundamental band gap of SnO is small with a value of 0.7 eV,20,21 which limits its use as a transparent hole-transporting layer in optoelectronic devices or as a pairing with transparent n-type oxides to realize transparent electronics.
As exemplified by p-type Cu(I) compounds, i.e., comparing Cu2O with CuSCN, the thiocyanate ligand preserves the metal-hybridized character of the VB while significantly widening the band gap from 2.1 eV in Cu2O (ref. 4) to more than 3.5 eV in CuSCN.8 The thiocyanate can also stabilize the reduced oxidation state as it is a much softer Lewis base than oxygen.22 We were therefore motivated to investigate the thiocyanate compound of Sn(II), Sn(NCS)2, with the aim of studying its electronic properties and potential as a transparent hole-transporting inorganic semiconductor. In this paper, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, and properties of Sn(NCS)2 based on a comprehensive array of experimental techniques and density functional theory (DFT). We also show for the first time the electronic application of Sn(NCS)2 as a hole transport layer (HTL) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.
2. Structural analysis and properties of Sn(NCS)2
2.1. 1D and 2D structures of Sn(NCS)2
As-synthesized, Sn(NCS)2 appears as white needles (Note S1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that Sn(NCS)2 crystallizes in the triclinic centrosymmetric P space group with an asymmetric unit consisting of a mononuclear Sn(II) center bonded to two NCS ligands with their nitrogen atoms, and hence the NCS designation of the thiocyanate in this case (Fig. 1a; crystallographic data are provided in the footnotes;‡ bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† respectively). This crystal structure agrees with the previous work by Filby et al.23 In addition to the reported structure, our analysis here reveals the low-dimensional structures of Sn(NCS)2 which are built up from the basic structural unit of a 1D chain that results from the bridging nature of the NCS ligand. These covalently-bonded chains pack together to form 2D sheets which are held together by non-covalent interactions.
 Fig. 1  (a) Asymmetric unit of Sn(NCS)2. (b) Full coordination of the Sn center with three covalent bonds and three tetrel bonds (Sn⋯S contacts), resulting in the monocapped octahedral geometry with the lone pair in the capping position. (c) 1D chains of covalently-bonded Sn(NCS)2 propagating along the b-axis. One of the two centrosymmetric chains is highlighted. The two chains are linked together along the length via Sn⋯S2ii and Sn⋯S2iii contacts to form the 1D ribbon. The unit cell is shown as a gray box. (d) Spacefill model showing the overlap of Sn and S2ii/S2iii which confirms the significance of the non-covalent Sn⋯S contacts. (e and f) Linking of 1D ribbons into a 2D corrugated sheet via the Sn⋯S1iv contact. 
Both thiocyanates of the asymmetric unit are close to linear, with N–C–S angles of approximately 178°. At first, they appear to be bonded to Sn via the N atom; however, one of the NCS ligands (N1–C1–S1) exhibits a bridging mode that connects the neighboring Sn atoms along the b-axis forming a 1D polymeric chain structure. This bridging mode, bonded with both N and S, can occur due to the ambidentate nature of the thiocyanate and the borderline acid characteristics of Sn(II).24,25 The other thiocyanate ligand (N2–C2–S2) is non-bridging and referred to as a ‘terminal’ NCS. In addition to the three covalent bonds, i.e., Sn–N1, Sn–N2, and Sn–S1i, further examination of the crystal structure reveals three particularly strong Sn···S contacts: Sn···S2ii, Sn···S2iii, and Sn···S1iv (Fig. 1b) which are at distances of 3.13, 3.31, and 3.50 Å, or approximately 0.84, 0.66, and 0.47 Å shorter than their combined van der Waals (vdW) radii. These contacts can be described as tetrel bonds (see Section 4 for further discussion).26–29 With six coordination and a lone pair of Sn(II), the full coordination geometry of Sn is best described as monocapped octahedral (Fig. 1b). This is in contrast with other 1D Sn(II) complexes, such as the Sn(II)–mercaptoaniline complex {[Sn(S–C6H4–NH3)(S–C6H4–NH2)]Cl·H2O}n, which has a trigonal pyramidal geometry.30
Interestingly, the two shorter Sn···S contacts (Sn···S2ii and Sn···S2iii) occur between the Sn atoms on one polymeric chain and the S-ends of the terminal NCS ligands of the centrosymmetric chain. This results in the linkage of the two Sn(NCS)2 units along the whole length of the 1D chain (along the b-axis), leading to a ‘1D zigzag ribbon’ with the bridging thiocyanate (N1–C1–S1) forming the two backbones and the terminal thiocyanate (N2–C2–S2) pointing toward the other chain in an interdigitated pattern (Fig. 1c). A spacefill model (Fig. 1d) reveals more clearly the Sn···Sn2ii and Sn···S2iii interactions that link the two chains together (seen as overlapping Sn and S2 atoms; see also Note S1 and Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The other contact, Sn···S1iv, which is directed along the c-axis further links the ribbons together along their length, yielding a larger ‘2D corrugated sheet’ on the bc-plane (Fig. 1e and f). Finally, the packing of the 2D sheets into the 3D bulk structure (along the a-direction) takes place via vdW forces. In this regard, the structure can be compared to that of SnO which also features 2D sheets of the Sn–O network that are bound together by vdW interactions.21 The potential of 2D SnO has recently been demonstrated in electronic applications.31 Also having a layered structure, Sn(NCS)2 can be classified as a coordination polymer-based 2D semiconductor.
2.2. Structural and morphological properties
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of a freshly prepared Sn(NCS)2 sample is displayed in Fig. 2a along with the simulated pattern based on single crystal data. Five major peaks are observed at 2θ of 16.7°, 17.9°, 19.3°, 28.8°, and 30.5°, corresponding to diffractions from (01), (002), (01), (111), and (03) planes, respectively. The PXRD pattern of the sample stored under air for 6 months at a relative humidity of 30% remains unchanged, which indicates that the compound is stable. Its thermal stability was also studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†); the compound has high thermal stability up to 220 °C under O2 and 230 °C under N2.
 Fig. 2  (a) PXRD patterns of as-synthesized and aged Sn(NCS)2 samples. The simulated pattern from the single crystal data is also shown. (b) SEM image showing the layered structure of Sn(NCS)2 flakes. (c) TEM image of an individual Sn(NCS)2 flake. (d) HRTEM image of the region marked by the dashed blue square in (c). (e) Magnified image of an area marked as A1 in (d). (f) Magnified image of an area marked as A2 in (d). (g) Selected area electron diffraction pattern of (d). 
The white solid precipitates of Sn(NCS)2 contained both single crystals and polycrystalline solids; the latter were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which reveals a layered morphology (Fig. 2b) with each flake having a lateral size of 1–10 μm; further examination of the flakes via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also gives more evidence of the layered structure (Fig. 2c and Fig. S4a–e, ESI†). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) shows that the layer is polycrystalline consisting of nanoscale-sized domains. In fact, we can observe two types of nanocrystalline morphology from the thin and thicker regions of the flakes (Fig. 2d–f). First, looking at the thin region labelled as A1 (Fig. 2d and e), the domains appear more rounded with a lateral size of 2–3 nm, showing lattice fringes of varying d-spacings randomly and homogenously distributed throughout. Although only one domain with a d-spacing of 3.2 Å is marked in Fig. 2e, other nanoscale-sized domains from this thin region were measured to have d-spacings between 2.65 Å and 3.31 Å, a range which corresponds to 12 possible crystallographic planes (see Note S2 in the ESI†). It should be noted that the nanocrystals also resemble those observed in the HRTEM images of thin films of CuSCN,32 which is a 3D polymeric thiocyanate compound; this similar feature may be due to the highly directional bonding nature and the cylindrical shape of NCS units that inhibit crystallization of large domains.
Another nanocrystalline morphology is observed from the thicker regions of the Sn(NCS)2 flakes that show a longer-range order with long lattice fringes (labelled as A2 in Fig. 2d and magnified in Fig. 2f). Measuring the d-spacings from 8 sampling points yields a value of 5.6 ± 0.1 Å, which can be assigned to the (010) plane. The diffraction from this plane can also be identified with the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) as shown in Fig. 2g. Since this plane is parallel to the length of the domains, the 1D chains of Sn(NCS)2 are expected to lie in the transverse direction. Although the flakes observed here are not single-crystalline, the layered morphology provides evidence for the 2D structure of Sn(NCS)2.
2.3. Chemical states and optical properties
In addition to the analyses of the crystal and micro structures, the bulk physical properties of the Sn(NCS)2 powder were also studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis-NIR). The XPS narrow scan of the Sn 3d states (Fig. 3a) shows that Sn exists only in one chemical state which can be attributed to Sn(II) bonded to NCS groups. The binding energies of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 are 495.4 eV and 486.9 eV, respectively. This emphasizes the ability of the NCS ligand to stabilize Sn(II), which would be advantageous for practical applications. The narrow scans of other elements also corroborate that the sample is Sn(NCS)2 as only a single bonding state is found for each element (except the adventitious carbon C 1s at 284.8 eV). Fig. S5a–c (ESI†) show binding energies of N 1s at 399.2 eV, C 1s at 286.2 eV, S 2p1/2 at 163.6 eV, and S 2p3/2 at 162.4 eV all of which are attributed to bonding states in Sn(NCS)2. For CuSCN as a reference of another polymeric metal thiocyanate compound, N 1s is found at 398.5 eV, C 1s at 286.0 eV, and S 2p3/2 at 163.4 eV.12 In order to affirm the chemical stability of Sn(NCS)2, the Sn 3d XPS spectrum of an aged sample (stored under air at room temperature and a relative humidity of 30% for 8 months) was re-measured and compared with that of a freshly prepared sample. The results, plotted in Fig. S5d (ESI†), show no differences, corroborating the stability of the compound.

The dashed blue line and the corresponding blue-shaded region show the fitted peak. The solid red line represents the reconstructed spectrum from the fitted peaks. The dashed blue line and the solid red line lie on top of each other in this case. (b) Optical reflectance spectrum and the Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)] of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample. The short wavelength region of the latter is displayed in the inset. (c) Tauc plot showing a large optical band gap (Eoptg) of 3.37 eV of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample. 
The vibrational frequencies of the free thiocyanate ion are typically observed as IR absorptions approximately at 470 cm−1 for the N–C–S bending mode (δNCS), 745 cm−1 for the C–S stretching mode (νCS), and 2060 cm−1 for the C–N stretching mode (νCN).33–35 These three vibrational modes were also recorded in ATR-FTIR measurements of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample (Fig. S6, ESI†) with some splittings due to solid state effects:33δNCS at 446, 455, and 470 cm−1; νCS at 781 and 806 cm−1; and νCN at 2065 cm−1. The spectrum of NaSCN which was used as a thiocyanate source is also displayed alongside, showing the shifts in the vibrational frequencies of the thiocyanate ion due to the changes in the chemical and bonding environment.
The reflectance spectrum of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample as well as the absorption spectrum represented by the Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)] are displayed in Fig. 3b. Some absorption features at wavenumbers of 4000–5000 cm−1 are assigned to overtones of the vibrational modes. Strong absorption takes place in the UV region with the onset approximately at 380 nm (∼26300 cm−1) and two peaks at 345 nm (∼29000 cm−1) and 300 nm (∼33300 cm−1) as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. The 300-nm absorption and the shoulder extending to shorter wavelengths are possibly due to the intramolecular π → π* electronic transition of the thiocyanate. Theoretical calculations of a free thiocyanate ion have shown that the first allowed transition is high in energy at a wavelength of 155 nm (∼65000 cm−1); however, there is a forbidden transition around 270 nm (∼36800 cm−1) that could become allowed when the thiocyanate is bound to a metal.36,37 The latter may be related to the observed peak at 300 nm. The longer wavelength absorption (345 nm) could arise from a metal-centered transition or electronic transition involving charge transfer between the metal and thiocyanate although the exact nature has not been elucidated.38,39 Similar absorption features have also been observed in CuSCN, but the two peaks are at shorter wavelengths around 250 and 300 nm.32 Using Tauc plots (Fig. 3c), the optical band gap (Eoptg) of the Sn(NCS)2 powder is found to be 3.37 eV, a high value comparable to other transparent semiconductors. This result confirms our hypothesis that using the thiocyanate ligand enlarges the band gap of Sn(II)-based compounds.
3. Electronic structure of Sn(NCS)2
3.1. Electronic band structure
Structure relaxation calculations were performed via DFT calculations using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).40 A large deviation of 15% from the experimental lattice constant in the a-direction occurs when using an exchange–correlation functional that does not account for dispersion interactions.41 However, when using the rev-vdW-DF2 exchange–correlation functional, which takes into account the dispersion interactions,42–44 these deviations shrink to 2%, resulting in a superior agreement with the experimental structure. These calculations therefore show that vdW interactions are crucial for describing the structure of Sn(NCS)2 and further supports our analysis of the 2D structure which packs in the a-direction via vdW forces (Section 2.1).
The calculated electronic band structure of Sn(NCS)2 is displayed in Fig. S7 (ESI†) with the top of the valence band (VB) or the highest occupied state set as E = 0 eV. The valence band maximum (VBM) is found along the Γ–R path whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Y point. The fundamental band gap is therefore found to be an indirect type with a value of 2.35 eV. However, there exists another peak in the VB at the Y point which differs in energy from the true VBM by only 0.03 eV, suggesting that a direct transition is also possible in Sn(NCS)2 with a direct band gap of 2.38 eV. The calculated band gaps are smaller than the experimental values, however this is expected due to the well-known fact that the DFT underestimates the band gap of bulk solids.21,45,46 The problem arises from the fact that the exchange–correlation contribution to the energy is unknown and must be approximated in DFT. A better prediction of the band gap might be obtained by using hybrid functionals, which incorporate Hartree–Fock exchange into the energy calculation;21,47 however, such calculations also demand more computational resources. At the VBM and CBM, the hole and electron effective masses (mh* and me*) are calculated to be mh* ≈ 0.4m0 and me* ≈ 0.3m0, respectively, where m0 is the electron rest mass. It should be noted that these values are similar to those recently reported for CuSCN,48i.e., mh* ≈ 0.5m0 for light holes and me* ≈ 0.4m0. We could then expect Sn(NCS)2 to be another transparent pseudohalide semiconductor with good carrier transport in addition to CuSCN and CuSeCN.32,47
3.2. Density of states analysis
The density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) are plotted in Fig. 4a. From the DOS, there are two highly localized and stable states centered at −18 eV and −14 eV which result from the bonding within the NCS ligand. From the PDOS, we can see that the first one is mainly due to the σ-bond between the N 2s and C 2s states, and the latter is also the σ-bond but between the S 3s and C 2p electrons. These assignments are also in agreement with the results of the electronic structure calculations of the free thiocyanate ion.36,49 At higher energies of the VB and the bottom part of the CB, the DOS has a broader distribution due to overlapping states: a result of the Sn 5s and 5p states interacting with the molecular orbitals of NCS.50
 Fig. 4  (a) Total DOS spectrum of Sn(NCS)2 and valence orbital-projected PDOS spectra of the constituent atoms from DFT calculations. The valence band (VB) edge is set to zero energy. (b) PDOS spectra in the energy range −10 to 7 eV. Vertical dashed lines represent energy ranges of the VB sub-regions: I, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb. 
The PDOS of the 5s and 5p states of Sn and the valence p states of S, C, and N in the energy range of −10 eV to 7 eV are shown in Fig. 4b. We can divide the VB in this range into five sub-regions (I, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb) based on different orbital characteristics. Region I is related to the bonding states between Sn and NCS ligands (Sn 5s states with strong mixing from the N 2p states). Region II is largely due to the internal bonding within the NCS ligands (p states of N, C, and S). Finally, region III has a large contribution from the valence electrons of the NCS ligands that also mix with the Sn 5s states. The ‘a’ and ‘b’ designations are due to different σ and π MO characters of NCS ligands which will be described more in Section 3.3. Interestingly, the presence of the Sn 5s character near the top of the VB, associated with the Sn lone pair, results in band dispersion that could contribute to appreciable hole transport.
The bottom of the CB, which covers the energy range from 2 eV to 6 eV, is dominated by the Sn 5p states especially in the lower energy part with strong mixing from the C 2p and N 2p states. In addition, the Sn 5d states give only a minor contribution to the DOS, mostly mirroring the Sn 5p states in the VB and contributing to the high energy portion of the CB (Fig. 4a). The overall feature of the anion dominating the top of the VB (S 3p and N 2p) and the cation contributing largely to the bottom of the CB (Sn 5p) is a sign of the ionicity in the bonding. On the other hand, the mixing of Sn states in the VB as well as the strong directionality of the bonds are characteristics of covalent bonds. As expected, Sn(NCS)2 has a mixed bonding character.
3.3. Electron density map and lone pair orientation
By analyzing the electron density in the structure, we can deduce that the lone pair on Sn is directed primarily along the a-direction towards the interlayer space between the 2D sheets as shown in Fig. 5a. Specifically, the electron density is visualized as contour plots on the axial and basal planes of the 1D backbone chain (Fig. 5b). The total electron density on the axial plane (Fig. 5c) features a longitudinal section of the terminal thiocyanate (N2–C2–S2) as well as a cross section of the bridging thiocyanate (N1–C1–S1, of the centrosymmetric unit near the C1ii atom). Conversely, the total electron density on the basal plane (Fig. 5d) shows a longitudinal section of N1–C1–S1 and a cross section of N2–C2–S2 (also of the centrosymmetric unit at the S2ii atom). Importantly, the lone pair on Sn is clearly visible, especially on the axial plane (Fig. 5c). Noting that the dashed line represents the intersection with the basal plane, the lone pair occupies some space on the basal plane but is mostly below. This is also evident as the weaker lone pair density on the basal plane plot (Fig. 5d). The lone pair lobe points approximately in the a-direction, and this orientation is consistent with the lone pair sitting at the capping position of the geometry around Sn as described earlier (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of an Sn(NCS)2 2D sheet with the lone pair on Sn atoms. (b) Schematic showing the axial and basal planes used for the visualization of electron density. The contour maps of the electron density (number of electrons per Å3, represented by the color scale) of the whole VB (c and d) and VB sub-regions: region I (e and f); region IIa (g and h); region IIb (i and j); region IIIa (k and l); and region IIIb (m and n). The electron density plots on the axial plane are plotted as projections on X–Z coordinates (c, e, g, i, k, and m) whereas those on the basal plane are plotted as projections on X–Y coordinates (d, f, h, j, l, and n). Positions of atoms which are located directly or approximately on the planes are labelled in the plots. Dashed white lines represent the region where the axial and basal planes intersect each other. 
Furthermore, the partial electron density plots help elucidate the bonding nature of the five VB sub-regions. Region I (Fig. 5e and f) represents the main bonding interactions between Sn and N. The two Sn–N bonds are likely σ-bonds between Sn 5s and the σ MO of the NCS units. Region IIa (Fig. 5g and h) and region IIb (Fig. 5i and j) appear to be related to the internal σ and π MOs, respectively, of the NCS ligands with minimal interactions with Sn. Most importantly, region IIIa (Fig. 5k and l) and region IIIb (Fig. 5m and n) correspond to the antibonding states between Sn and NCS that give rise to the lone pair on Sn. Since NCS ligands have both σ and π MOs that can interact with Sn, there are two antibonding states that combine to form the top portion of the VB. Region IIIa appears to represent the σ MO of the NCS, and the antibonding orbital on Sn is also of the σ type (with the Sn 5s states dominant). On the other hand, region IIIb appears to be associated with the π MO of NCS, and hence the Sn states are a hybridization of Sn 5s and Sn 5p.
4. Discussion on the electronic structure, properties, and application of Sn(NCS)2
The three Sn⋯S non-covalent bonds that add to the monocapped octahedral geometry are best described as tetrel bonds, a type of σ-hole interaction.51,52 The charge re-distribution that results from the formation of covalent bonds, N1–Sn, N2–Sn, and S1i–Sn, leads to electrostatically positive regions around Sn that can interact with the π electrons on the S atoms of the NCS ligands forming tetrel bonds.26–29 The fact that the contribution of the Sn 5d orbitals is almost negligible in the VB (Fig. 4a) also supports such analysis because if the Sn⋯S contacts are of classical covalent type, we would expect the d states to participate in the bonding.
The overall DOS structure of Sn(NCS)2 shares many similarities with those of Sn(II) chalcogenides (SnX, X = O, S, Se, or Te)21,53–55 as well as that of Sn(II) iodide (SnI2).56 In particular, the highest VB of these Sn(II) compounds can be divided into three distinct regions. Starting from the lower energy, region I has strong contributions from both the Sn 5s states and the valence p states of the anion, yielding bonding interactions. The mid energy region, region II, is dominated by the anion valence p states with a smaller contribution from the Sn 5p states, also of bonding character. The high energy part, region III, is the antibonding states between the Sn 5s and the anion valence p states with some hybridization with the Sn 5p electrons. The CB is then composed of antibonding interactions between the Sn 5p and the anion valence p electrons. As seen from the PDOS (Fig. 4b) and the partial electron density plots (Fig. 5c–n), the VB structure of Sn(NCS)2 is broadly similar: region I with bonding character between Sn and NCS; region IIa and IIb with a dominant NCS character; and region IIIa and IIIb with antibonding interactions between the Sn 5s states and NCS (also with some hybridization with Sn 5p). The key difference is the fact that NCS has multiple MOs (as opposed to only valence p states of the chalcogens or halogens) that can interact with Sn, hence regions II and III are divided further into sub-region ‘a’ of NCS σ-states and sub-region ‘b’ of NCS π-states.
Considering the formation of the lone pair in Sn(II) compounds, Walsh and Watson have theorized that the origin of the stereochemically active lone pair in compounds of post-transition metals with an ns2 electron configuration is based on the coupling of metal np states with the antibonding states of metal ns–anion np electrons.55,57,58 In this case, the classical model of hybridization between the metal ns and metal np states to form the lone pair has been shown to be invalid; first of all, the p states of the anion are required to interact with the metal ns electrons to form the low-energy bonding states (region I) and simultaneously the intermediate high-energy antibonding states with a significant metal ns character. The latter would further interact with the metal np states forming the mid-energy bonding VB (region II) and the top antibonding VB states of the lone pair (region III). The metal ns2 electrons are therefore active in bonding (not an inert pair), and the stereochemically active nature also relies on the site distortion that forces s–p hybridization. In the case of Sn(NCS)2, the Sn 5s electrons are indeed active in bonding as evident from the PDOS (Fig. 4b) and partial electron density map of region I (Fig. 5e and f). The highly distorted structure as a result of the bulky and cylindrical shape of the NCS ligands also promotes s–p hybridization. The antibonding interactions of the Sn 5s and the MOs of NCS therefore give rise to the stereochemically active lone pair in Sn(NCS)2.
The band structure of Sn(NCS)2 shows that there are specific directions (around R and Y points) where dispersion is high (Fig. S7, ESI†), from which we can expect good hole transport. To demonstrate the electronic application of Sn(NCS)2, we fabricated organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells using Sn(NCS)2 as a hole transport layer (HTL) (see the detailed description of the device fabrication and characterization in Note S3, ESI†). The unoptimized cells show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.06 ± 0.29% (averaged from five cells) with the best-performing cell reaching 4.55% (see Fig. S8 and Table S3 in the ESI†). The results are highly encouraging as the processing and the properties of the Sn(NCS)2 film have not been optimized. The current deposition method yielded a rough and discontinuous Sn(NCS)2 layer which is highly detrimental to the device performance, reflected in the low fill factor (FF) of the cells. Nevertheless, this is the first successful demonstration of the electronic application of Sn(NCS)2. Further optimization of the film processing to obtain smooth and uniform films is expected to significantly improve the cell performance as well as allow the testing of other device applications, such as thin-film transistors (TFTs).
Also, from the perspective of material design, one way to further enhance the hole transport properties is to increase the interactions between the lone pairs on the Sn centers. Various studies have shown the significance of lone pair–lone pair interactions toward hole transport in SnO. The 2D sheets of SnO have Sn lone pairs pointing outward, and the bulk structure is built from the vdW stacking of the sheets in the c-direction.21 Expanding the lattice along the c-axis of SnO leads to less dispersion at the top of the VB,54,59 and isolating the 2D Sn–O sheets into a double-layer or a single-layer results in highly localized states at the VBM.59 Both cases signify the role that lone pair interactions play on the dispersion of the VBM.
Consequently, recent design principles of p-type oxides based on Sn(II) with predicted low hole effective masses focus on structural modifications that achieve greater lone pair interactions: Ha et al.60 studied the effects of modifying Sn(II)-based oxides with K whereas Li et al.61 focused on Group 2 metals. Both employed DFT calculations and found that the alkali or alkaline earth ions effectively alter the structure of SnO but do not contribute to the electronic states of the top of the VB. Their results showed that small hole effective masses are found in structures with stronger Sn–Sn (i.e., lone pair–lone pair) interactions as well as more overlap between Sn and O. Similar to SnO, our analyses have shown that Sn(NCS)2 also features 2D sheets with lone pairs pointing towards the interlayer space (Fig. 5a). Therefore, such structural modifications should be possible with Sn(NCS)2 and are the subject of our current investigations. In addition to metal ions, Sn(NCS)2 could also be modified by various organic ligands, as in the case of CuSCN.39
It is noteworthy that using NCS ligands to form compounds with Sn(II) retains the VB characteristics that are similar to those of Sn(II) chalcogenides, particularly the mixing of the Sn 5s and anion p states at the top of the VB that contribute to dispersed states. On the other hand, the CB of Sn(NCS)2 that results from the interactions of Sn 5p with NCS MOs (mostly the NC portion, Fig. 4a and b) is higher in energy, widening the band gap and rendering Sn(NCS)2 transparent to the visible spectrum. This work, therefore, further provides an example of realizing transparent p-type semiconductors of coordination polymers based on NCS ligands.
5. Conclusions
Sn(NCS)2 can be synthesized from the simple crystallization of SnSO4 and NaSCN. The detailed analysis of X-ray single crystal data reveals that the bulk structure is built up from covalently-bonded 1D chains (along the b-axis) which are packed into a 2D structure in the bc-plane via tetrel bonds (non-covalent interactions). The lone pair on Sn points outward from the 2D sheets to the interlayer space, and the bulk packing along the a-direction takes place through vdW interactions. XPS and UV-Vis-NIR results confirm that the thiocyanate ligand can stabilize Sn(II) and widen the band gap to 3.37 eV. DFT calculations support the lone pair orientation and the large band gap and show that the Sn 5s electrons are active in bonding as well as forming dispersed states at the VBM that could contribute to hole transport. The electronic application of Sn(NCS)2 has been demonstrated by employing it as the HTL in OPVs, yielding PCEs up to 4.55%, with the performance expected to be enhanced further by optimizing the processing methods.
We have shown that the thiocyanate ligand can be used to engineer transparent p-type semiconductors; its hybridization with the cations preserves the character of the VB while opening up the band gap. The flexibility of coordination chemistry will also allow for further modifications, e.g., by adding electronically inactive cations or other organic ligands, to tune the VB dispersion and consequently hole-transporting characteristics. We are also actively investigating in detail the solution-based thin-film deposition of Sn(NCS)2 and its applications in opto/electronic devices, and the results will be reported in a separate publication.
6. Experimental section
6.1. Materials and synthesis

Materials. 
Tin(II) sulfate (SnSO4, 95%, Aldrich) was used as a tin(II) precursor and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, 98%, Acros) as a thiocyanate source. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 96% AR grade, Carlo Erba) was diluted with deionized (DI) water to a concentration of 1 M before use. All chemicals were used as-received without further purification.


Synthesis. 
Sn(NCS)2 was synthesized using a crystallization method.62 NaSCN (12 g) was dissolved in DI water (50 mL) while SnSO4 (8 g) was separately dissolved in DI water (42 mL) and 1 M H2SO4 (8 mL), yielding a slightly cloudy solution. The latter solution of the tin precursor was then slowly filtered directly into the NaSCN solution and left to stand for 5 h at room temperature before being transferred into a freezer and left at −20 °C for 18 h for slow crystallization. The final product was collected by filtration, washed three times with DI water, and dried in a vacuum oven (10 mbar) at 80 °C for 8 h. The average weight of Sn(NCS)2 from five repeated syntheses was 3.79 g, a yield of 43.3% (based on Sn).

6.2. Characterization methods

Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). 
The structural determination was carried out using a Bruker D8 Venture single crystal X-ray diffractometer employing an Mo Kα radiation source (λ = 0.71073 Å). The crystal was mounted onto MiTeGen MicroMounts™ and cryo-cooled to 143 K during measurements. The data were scaled and integrated using the APEX3 software. The structure was solved by intrinsic phasing using SHELXT and refined using SHELXL packages in the Olex2 software.63–65


Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). 
The structural properties of the powder samples were examined using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer. The X-ray source was Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å). The diffraction patterns were collected with a step of 0.02°. The simulated PXRD pattern was calculated using the Mercury software based on the experimentally obtained single crystal structure data.


Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 
The stability and decomposition of Sn(NCS)2 were investigated using a Linseis STA PT1600 analyzer under N2 and O2 gases from room temperature to 1000 °C. 20 mg of Sn(NCS)2 was weighed into an alumina pan for each measurement. The heating rate was 10 °C per min and the mass change was recorded at an interval of 0.2 °C.


Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (SEM & TEM). 
The SEM images were taken using a JEOL field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) JSM-7610F, operated at a low landing energy (1.0–2.0 kV, in a gentle beam mode). The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F microscope, equipped with a cold field-emission electron gun (tungsten) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For TEM imaging, the sample was gently dispersed in hexane and then dropped onto a lacey carbon film on a 400-mesh copper grid. The sample was dried under ambient conditions, degassed in a dry pumping station for 30 min (JEOL JEC-4000DS), and cleaned by an ion cleaner for 15 min at 250 V (JEOL EC-52000IC).


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
The chemical states of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample were characterized using an ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versa Probe II. The system was equipped with a monochromatic, micro-focused Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV), operated at 25 W (at a voltage of 15 kV), and a hemispherical analyzer with a multi-channel detector. The base pressure was maintained at 10−10 mbar. A dual beam charge neutralization (low energy electron and ion beams) method was used to minimize sample charging. The wide survey scan was collected over an energy range of 0 to 1400 eV with a step of 1 eV and a pass energy of 117.40 eV. The core electron spectra were recorded with steps of 0.05 eV and a pass energy of 46.95 eV. All spectra were aligned to the C 1s peak of the adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV.


Attenuated total reflectance – Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). 
Absorption in the near-infrared to mid-infrared range was measured using a PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR spectrometer equipped with an ATR accessory. The force between the diamond/KRS-5 probe and the sample was maintained at 100 N to allow good contact. The samples were evaluated directly in the solid state under CO2/H2O atmospheric compensation. The spectra were collected with a step of 1 cm−1 and repeated for 32 scans.


Ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis-NIR). 
The optical properties of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample were studied using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 spectrometer, equipped with tungsten–halogen and deuterium lamps as light sources and an integrating sphere with a photomultiplier and InGaAs detectors for UV-Vis and NIR wavelengths, respectively. The measurement was recorded under reflection mode, and the reflectance data were converted into absorbance using the Kubelka–Munk conversion.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. 
All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), using plane wave basis sets and PAW-PBE pseudopotentials.40 Unless mentioned otherwise, all calculations used the rev-vdW-DF2 exchange–correlation functional.42–44 Band structure calculations were performed using an 8 × 8 × 8 Γ-centered k-points mesh and a 640 eV basis set energy cut-off. Density of states and charge density calculations were performed using a 16 × 16 × 16 Γ-centered k-points mesh and a 640 eV basis set energy cut-off. The Brillouin zone path follows that of a triclinic system as described by Setyawan and Curtarolo.66


Organic photovoltaic fabrication and characterization. 
The fabrication steps followed the methods described in the literature.12 The cells were characterized under ambient atmosphere and standard 1 sun AM1.5G conditions. See the detailed description in Note S3 in the ESI.†

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Asymmetric unit of Sn(NCS)2. (b) Full coordination of the Sn center with three covalent bonds and three tetrel bonds (Sn⋯S contacts), resulting in the monocapped octahedral geometry with the lone pair in the capping position. (c) 1D chains of covalently-bonded Sn(NCS)2 propagating along the b-axis. One of the two centrosymmetric chains is highlighted. The two chains are linked together along the length via Sn⋯S2ii and Sn⋯S2iii contacts to form the 1D ribbon. The unit cell is shown as a gray box. (d) Spacefill model showing the overlap of Sn and S2ii/S2iii which confirms the significance of the non-covalent Sn⋯S contacts. (e and f) Linking of 1D ribbons into a 2D corrugated sheet via the Sn⋯S1iv contact.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) PXRD patterns of as-synthesized and aged Sn(NCS)2 samples. The simulated pattern from the single crystal data is also shown. (b) SEM image showing the layered structure of Sn(NCS)2 flakes. (c) TEM image of an individual Sn(NCS)2 flake. (d) HRTEM image of the region marked by the dashed blue square in (c). (e) Magnified image of an area marked as A1 in (d). (f) Magnified image of an area marked as A2 in (d). (g) Selected area electron diffraction pattern of (d).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Sn 3d core-level XPS spectrum of the Sn(NCS)2 sample. Scattered points represent collected data. The solid gray line represents the background. The dashed blue line and the corresponding blue-shaded region show the fitted peak. The solid red line represents the reconstructed spectrum from the fitted peaks. The dashed blue line and the solid red line lie on top of each other in this case. (b) Optical reflectance spectrum and the Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)] of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample. The short wavelength region of the latter is displayed in the inset. (c) Tauc plot showing a large optical band gap (Eoptg) of 3.37 eV of the Sn(NCS)2 powder sample.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Total DOS spectrum of Sn(NCS)2 and valence orbital-projected PDOS spectra of the constituent atoms from DFT calculations. The valence band (VB) edge is set to zero energy. (b) PDOS spectra in the energy range −10 to 7 eV. Vertical dashed lines represent energy ranges of the VB sub-regions: I, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IIIb.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of an Sn(NCS)2 2D sheet with the lone pair on Sn atoms. (b) Schematic showing the axial and basal planes used for the visualization of electron density. The contour maps of the electron density (number of electrons per Å3, represented by the color scale) of the whole VB (c and d) and VB sub-regions: region I (e and f); region IIa (g and h); region IIb (i and j); region IIIa (k and l); and region IIIb (m and n). The electron density plots on the axial plane are plotted as projections on X–Z coordinates (c, e, g, i, k, and m) whereas those on the basal plane are plotted as projections on X–Y coordinates (d, f, h, j, l, and n). Positions of atoms which are located directly or approximately on the planes are labelled in the plots. Dashed white lines represent the region where the axial and basal planes intersect each other.
