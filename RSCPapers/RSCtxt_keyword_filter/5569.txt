    , Accepted 13th April 2021First published on 13th April 2021AbstractThe industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is based on the development of efficiency and stability. Here, a composite film of a polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) and tellurophene-based two-dimensional metal–organic framework (2D MOF) was introduced to realize the nondestructive passivation of TiO2. This interfacial layer can not only realize the effective passivation of TiO2, but can also further improve the morphology of the perovskite film. After the modification of the PEIE-2D MOF composite film, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film are greatly optimized, the trap states in the TiO2 layer are reduced, and the electron transport in the device is enhanced, thus finally achieving highly efficient and stable FA0.25MA0.75PbI3 PSCs with a maximum efficiency of 22.22%. It was demonstrated that the reduced trap states and the smooth surface of the TiO2 electron transport layer are the reasons for the high performance of modified PSCs. This method provides a new way for improving the interface state to achieve highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show significant potential as candidates for future energy conversion devices with low cost and a high conversion efficiency.1–5 The industrialization of PSCs is gradually accelerating, which requires higher device efficiency and stability to meet the requirements of commercial products. On the one hand, the interface defects and energy level mismatch between the perovskite layer and the transport layer are the important factors that cause photoelectric loss in PSCs. Interfacial modification can solve these problems and significantly improve the device efficiency.6–10 On the other hand, the degradation of PSCs induced by moisture,11–14 oxygen,15–17 and temperature,18–20 which can be suppressed by advanced encapsulation, has been studied intensively. However, another important factor that causes PSC degradation, ultraviolet radiation, is difficult to block. The ultraviolet band of solar irradiation can cause the performance degradation or even failure of PSCs through the catalysis of Ti3+ defects in TiO2,21,22 which is the most common electron transport material with different morphologies and advanced optimization strategies.23–26 To improve the UV stability of PSCs, a PEIE (polyethylenimine ethoxylated) interfacial passivation layer was introduced on the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL).27 The PEIE-modified material can block the Ti3+ state transformation in TiO2 and thus enhance the stability of PSCs. However, the surface of the PEIE layer is rough and prone to form island particles, which tends to hinder the uniform growth of the perovskite and leads to poor perovskite crystallinity. Therefore, although the introduction of the PEIE-modified layer can enhance the stability of PSCs, it is not conducive to the improvement of the conversion efficiency. Recently, it has been reported that a tellurophene-based two-dimensional metal–organic framework (2D MOF) was efficiently exfoliated by PEIE to afford highly stable single- and few-layer MOF nanosheets.28 For PEIE and tellurophene-based MOF composite materials, the strong interactions between amines in PEIE and metal ions in the MOF can exfoliate the MOF bulk into two-dimensional nanosheets, which can remove the island particles from the TiO2 surface. The smooth modification layer avoids the damage to the perovskite film caused by the PEIE rough surface, possessing the potential to improve device efficiency and stability at the same time. This composite material indicates the feasibility of developing a method for nondestructive passivation of the TiO2 ETL.
In this work, we prepared a Cd3(C6H2TeO4)3·4DMF 2D MOF and mixed it with PEIE solution to prepare precursor ink. This ink was spin-coated on the TiO2 ETL to form a uniform ultra-thin film. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence fluorescence spectrometry (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and other characterization techniques were used to analyse the specific role of the PEIE-2D MOF in TiO2 and its influence on the perovskite film. Our experimental results showed that the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film are significantly improved, the trap states in TiO2 are reduced, and the electron transport is enhanced greatly. With the optimization of the PEIE-2D MOF, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of FA0.25MA0.75PbI3 PSCs reaches 22.22%. After 84 hours of continuous illumination, the modified PSCs retained ∼83% of their initial efficiency.
Experimental
Materials
Methylammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide, 2,20,7,70-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,90-spirobifluorene and Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (purity: 99.5%). Lead iodide (purity: 99.999%), FK209 and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, purity: 99.9%) precursor were purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and chlorobenzene were purchased from Acros Organics (extra dry). Polyethylenimine, 80% ethoxylated (PEIE), was dissolved in H2O with a concentration of 37 wt% in H2O when received from Aldrich.
Precursor preparation
TiO2 solution was prepared according to a facile and reproducible method reported previously.29 3 mL of TiCl4 precursor was added into 150 mL of ultrapure water and stirred continuously. For the perovskite precursor, 0.25 mmol of FAI, 0.75 mmol of MAI, and 1.025 mmol of PbI2 were added into a mixed solution of anhydrous dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide (600 mL and 92 mL, respectively), which was stirred for 2 h at room temperature in a glove box. For the HTM precursor, Spiro-OMeTAD powder was dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 70 mg mL−1 and then tert-butylpyridine (28.5 μL in 1 mL of chlorobenzene) and lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (8.75 mg mL−1) were added into the Spiro-OMeTAD solution as additives, which was stirred in a glove box for 6 h as described in previous studies.29,30 For the PEIE precursor solution, it was further diluted with 2-methoxyethanol (hereafter referred to as methoxyethanol) to a weight concentration of 0.1%. The 2D MOF (5 mg) was added into the PEIE aqueous solution (1 mL), and the mixture was sonicated for 5 h in an ice-water bath. The Cd3(C6H2TeO4)3·4DMF two-dimensional metal–organic framework sheets were synthesized according to a previous report.26 The detailed synthetic procedure and precursor dilution process are presented in the ESI.†
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
FTO glass (7 Ωsq−1) was cleaned by sequential sonication with a detergent solution, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min, respectively. After being dried by a nitrogen flow, the substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 20 min before use. TiO2 films were fabricated by water-bath-heating the precursor solution onto the FTO substrates at 70 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 films were further treated with UV–ozone for 15 min and then transferred into a N2-filled glove box (Apuris IGBS1200). To fabricate perovskite films, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated directly on the TiO2 substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s. During the spin-coating step, 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was poured on the surface at 22 s before the end. The light-yellow transparent films were converted into brownish-red perovskite films by heating at 110 °C for 15 min. Then, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on the perovskite films. Finally, an 80 nm Au electrode was evaporated on the films. For the modified PSCs, the diluted PEIE solution and PEIE-2D MOF solution were spin-coated on top of the compact TiO2 layer at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. The spin-coated PEIE films and PEIE-2D MOF films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in a glove box. Finally, the modified PSCs were fabricated according to the above method.
Characterization
Current–voltage curves were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5G irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (XES-301S + EL-100) by forward (−0.1 to 1.2 V) or reverse (1.2 to −0.1 V) scans. The step voltage was fixed at 12 mV and the delay time was set at 10 ms. The valence spectra were recorded using an XPS spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi). All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. The steady PL spectra and transient PL decay of the perovskite films on the FTO substrates were recorded using a spectrometer (Edinburg PLS 980). The EQE was measured using a QE-R quantum efficiency measurement system (Enli Technology). The absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). The morphologies of the as-prepared films were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (HITACHI SU8010) and an atomic force microscope (FSM-Precision FM-Nanoview Op-AFM). The chemical compositions and structures of the MA0.75FA0.25PbI3 films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu-Kα radiation λ = 0.15406 nm).
Results and discussion
Increased perovskite crystallinity
Although PEIE can improve device stability due to the passivation effect of the Ti3+ states in TiO2, the crystal quality of the perovskite film based on the PEIE (polyethylenimine ethoxylated) film decreases apparently; the molecular structure of PEIE is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† To solve the aforementioned problem, a Cd3(C6H2TeO4)3·4DMF 2D MOF and a PEIE composite film are deposited on the TiO2 ETL. The molecular structure diagram of the 2D MOF is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Considering the insulation of PEIE materials, the thickness of the modification layer is controlled between 2 and 10 nm to avoid the increase of the transmission resistance of the PSCs.27,28,31 The electrical conductivity of MOF materials is similar to that of insulators. Therefore, the thickness of the PEIE-2D MOF composite film in this study should also be kept at a minimum value. Based on the current process, the PEIE-2D MOF is deposited on the surface of TiO2 as one or two layers, with a thickness of 1–3 nm.28 The detailed fabrication procedures are shown in the Experimental section. To explore the reason of the poor perovskite crystallinity prepared on the PEIE-modified TiO2 layer, the substrate morphology was characterized by AFM as shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that, in the absence of specific indications, the same set of characterization data mentioned in the full text were obtained using the same instrument under the same environmental conditions and parameters. The surface morphologies of TiO2, PEIE/TiO2 and PEIE-2D MOF/TiO2 are obviously different. Fig. 1a exhibits the morphology of TiO2 which consisted of closely aligned nanoparticles with a relatively smooth surface. In contrast, the PEIE layer did not cover the surface of TiO2 uniformly, as shown in Fig. 1b, but formed dispersed islands in different areas, which is destructive to the perovskite film. The grains of the corresponding perovskite films based on PEIE/TiO2 are finer (Fig. 1e). To solve this problem, the 2D MOF mentioned above was mixed with the PEIE solution (the mixing ratio is provided in the Experimental section), and the morphology of the PEIE-MOF layer is shown in Fig. 1c. As we can see, the PEIE-2D MOF modification layer can be uniformly and smoothly covered on the surface of the TiO2 ETL, which can suppress the negative effect of PEIE islands. In addition, the SEM images of the perovskite film deposited on different substrates are displayed in Fig. 1d–f. Obviously, the grains of the FA0.25MA0.75PbI3 perovskite films prepared on the PEIE/TiO2 ETL are finer and their crystallinity is poor. After 2D MOF modification, the perovskite film deposited on the modified transport layer has larger and denser grains, indicating that the crystal quality of the perovskite was improved.

To verify the improved quantity of the perovskite film prepared on the modified TiO2 transport layer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the FA0.25MA0.75PbI3 perovskite film were recorded, as shown in Fig. 2. The strong diffraction peaks at 14.1° and 28.4° can be correctly indexed to the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite crystal structure, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a, which indicates that the uniform perovskite film can be prepared on different substrates. However, a noticeable increase in the intensity and a decrease in the half-peak width (∼0.125°) of the (110) peak compared with the standard perovskite film (∼0.132°) can be observed in the high-resolution XRD spectra of the perovskite based on the PEIE-2D MOF; meanwhile, the peak intensity of perovskite/PEIE decreases and the half-peak width increases apparently, as shown in Fig. 2b. This result indicates that the PEIE layer decreases the crystallinity, but the presence of 2D MOF sheets in the PEIE layer enhances the crystallinity of the obtained perovskite film.

To further confirm the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite based on the PEIE-2D MOF, its absorption and PL spectra were recorded, the results of which were consistent with the XRD results. Under the same preparation conditions, the thicknesses of the perovskite/TiO2, perovskite/PEIE and perovskite/PEIE-2D MOF are identical; therefore, the higher absorbance in the short wavelength scale of the perovskite/PEIE-2D MOF indicates its better morphology and crystallinity compared to perovskite/TiO2, as shown in Fig. 2c. In contrast, the lower absorbance of perovskite/PEIE can contribute to its poorer morphology and crystallinity compared to perovskite/TiO2. The photoluminescence intensity of the perovskite film was characterized using a steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. Likewise, the higher photoluminescence of the perovskite film prepared on PEIE-2D MOF/glass (no carrier transport between layers) indicates less recombination loss in the perovskite crystal, illustrating better morphology and crystallinity. These results indicate that the smooth PEIE-2D MOF interfacial modified layer is nondestructive to the perovskite film.
In addition, the surface energy data of the TiO2, PEIE/TiO2 and PEIE-MOF/TiO2 surfaces were analysed using a contact angle analyzer. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the surface energies of the three substrates are about 72 mN m−1, and all the contact angles between the perovskite precursors and the substrates are about 31°. This result indicates that the perovskite precursors have similar wettability on the three substrates, and the decrease of the perovskite crystallization quality is mainly due to the PEIE island particles.
Reduced trap states
The modified layer of PEIE and the PEIE-2D MOF can reduce the interfacial trap states between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite film. To verify the reduction of the trap states, a number of spectroscopic characterization techniques were used to analyze the energy alignment and trap state intensity of the TiO2 layer covered with the PEIE or PEIE-2D MOF film. We coated the PEIE and PEIE-2D MOF films on the surface of the TiO2 transport layer, respectively. The detailed experimental procedures are presented in the Experimental section. Then, the pure and modified TiO2 layer was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The valence band XPS (VXPS) spectra shown in Fig. 3a exhibit an apparent upward shift of the TiO2 Fermi energy level. The difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) and the Fermi energy level (EF) can be determined by the linear extrapolation of the VXPS spectrum. It was apparent that the energy differences between the VBM and EF are 1.95 eV, 2.5 eV and 2.45 eV for pure TiO2, PEIE/TiO2 and PEIE-2D MOF/TiO2, respectively. The VXPS results reveal the effects of electron injection for the PEIE and PEIE-2D MOF films. We believe that the injected electrons can effectively passivate the Ti3+ defects in the TiO2 transport layer and reduce the parallel resistance of the solar cell.27

The TiO2 film was prepared on a FTO/glass substrate using a 70 °C water-bath, and the PEIE or PEIE-MOF layer was spin-coated on the surface of the TiO2 film. The detailed experimental parameters are provided in the ESI.† (b) Steady-state PL spectra of the TiO2 film with/without the modified layer on the glass substrate. (c–e) TRPL high-resolution spectra of Ti2p in the TiO2 ETL; the relative amount of Ti3+ is calculated according to area integration. 
The reduced trap states in TiO2 are confirmed by the ultra-low temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As the photoluminescence of the TiO2 film is susceptible to thermal recombination, it is difficult to obtain an accurate PL spectrum at room temperature. Therefore, we carried out ultra-low temperature PL measurements of the pure TiO2 film and modified TiO2 film with PEIE or the PEIE-2D MOF under liquid nitrogen conditions (the actual operating temperature is about 80 K). As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL intensity of pure TiO2 is significantly lower than that of modified TiO2 with PEIE and the PEIE-2D MOF. The photoluminescence originates from the radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs, which can be offset by the non-radiative recombination caused by the trap states. Hence, a higher PL intensity means lower trap states. This result reveals that the trap states in TiO2 can be passivated effectively by PEIE or the PEIE-2D MOF.
In order to explore the origin of the passivation process, we used XPS to perform the detailed surface chemistry characterization of the TiO2 film. The main defects in TiO2 are Ti3+ which account for a low proportion. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the absolute value of its content. Therefore, we used ultraviolet irradiation to promote the conversion of Ti3+ to Ti4+,21 and then compared the changes of the Ti3+ content in TiO2, so as to infer the passivation effects of PEIE and the PEIE-2D MOF on the Ti3+ defects. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti2p are shown in Fig. 3c–e. After the XPS curve fitting by Origin, it can be seen that Ti3+ and Ti4+ co-existed, however with different relative ratios. The two broad peaks, indicated by green lines, at 458.7 eV and 464.4 eV, belong to Ti4+(2p3/2) and Ti4+(2p1/2), respectively, and the other lower peaks, indicated by red lines, at 457.2 eV and 462.9 eV belong to Ti3+(2p3/2) and Ti3+(2p1/2), respectively.32–34 Obviously, the relative atomic ratio between Ti3+ and Ti4+ in the pure TiO2 film decreased from 6.26% (before UV illumination) to 3.21% (after UV illumination), as shown in Fig. 3c. These results demonstrate that the amounts of Ti3+ defects in TiO2 can be converted to Ti4+ trap states after illumination, and these trap states can cause combination losses and reduce the device performance.21 In contrast, the modified TiO2 films with PEIE or PEIE-2D MOF exhibited little changes in the relative atomic ratio, as proved in Fig. 3d and e. In other words, Ti3+ in the TiO2 film does not turn into Ti4+ trap states because of the injection of electrons from the PEIE and PEIE-2D MOF layers. The reduced trap states in TiO2 imply enhanced electron extraction in the perovskite solar cell.
Enhanced carrier transport
The PEIE-2D MOF increases the Fermi energy level by ∼0.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 3a, indicating a reduced carrier transport barrier which can enhance the carrier transport.10,17,18 Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay behavior of the perovskite film prepared on the TiO2 ETL with/without the modified layer was characterized to check the influence of the PEIE-2D MOF layer on the electron extraction of the TiO2 ETL. The detailed measurement parameters are shown in the Experimental section. The TRPL decay curves can be fitted by a bi-exponential decay function as follows:  where A1 and A2 are the pre-exponential factors, a value affected by technical (instrumental) parameters and sample parameters, which can be expressed as a decay amplitude weight fraction using the equation: Ai/(A1 + A2), indicating the content ratio of the charge behavior. τ1 and τ2 are the fast decay time and slow decay time, respectively. The average decay time was calculated using the following equation:  which is proposed to represent the synthesized efficiency of charge separation and transfer.35,36 The measured fast decay time τ1, slow decay time τ2, amplitude weight fractions A1 and A2, and PL average lifetime τavg are listed in Table 1. The fast decay process is considered to be a result of the quenching of free carriers in the perovskite domain through transport to the ETL and the slow decay process to be a result of radiative decay.36,37 For the perovskite film prepared on pure TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4a, the fast decay lifetime is 10.1 ns and the slow decay lifetime is 79.3 ns, while their corresponding amplitude weight fractions are 71.3% and 28.7%, respectively, indicating that charge transfer is the dominant decay mechanism. On the other hand, the fast decay lifetime of the perovskite thin film prepared on TiO2/PEIE decreased to 6.4 ns, and the amplitude weight fraction increased to 79.1%. This result demonstrates that TiO2 with the PEIE modification layer possesses more efficient charge transport access, corresponding to the increased Fermi level of the TiO2 ETL. Meanwhile, the fast decay lifetime of the perovskite thin film on PEIE-2D MOF/TiO2 decreased significantly to 0.6 ns, and the corresponding amplitude weight fraction increased to 98.9%. This further decrease of the fast decay lifetime and the increase of the amplitude weight fraction, which indicate improved charge transport and reduced carrier recombination, can be attributed to the reduced trap states in TiO2 and the improved crystallinity of the perovskite thin film on the PEIE-2D MOF/TiO2 substrate.36,37 Moreover, an obvious decrease of the estimated τave (0.8 ns) is achieved by the insertion of the PEIE-2D MOF layer between the perovskite active layer and the TiO2 ETL, as compared with the pure TiO2 ETL (30 ns), suggesting that the use of the PEIE-2D MOF layer can accelerate light-induced charge separation and transfer.

 Fig. 4  Characterization of electron transport. (a) Steady-state PL spectra and (b) TRPL decay curves of the perovskite film on different substrates. (c) Open-circuit voltage decay and (d) current density rising curves of PSCs with or without modified layers. 
For the steady-state PL measurement, the perovskite film prepared on the TiO2 surface with/without the modified layer was excited at 505 nm and the PL intensity curves are shown in Fig. 4b. As mentioned above, the charge transfer process from the perovskite film to the ETL is the dominant decay mechanism; thus, the greater quenching of the PL intensity indicates faster charge transfer. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the fast fluorescence quenching occurs in TiO2/PEIE and TiO2/PEIE-2D MOF. It means that the TiO2 ETL with the modified layer exhibits enhanced electron transfer.
To gain an insight into enhanced electron transfer, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under AM1.5 illumination. As shown in Fig. 4c, the VOC decay curves of PSCs with/without the modified layer are all composed of a fast decay process and a slow decay process, which is similar to a previous report.38 The slow decay process of VOC, which represents the depolarization of the perovskite, declines more slowly in the devices with the PEIE-2D MOF layer. This implies the increased crystallinity of the perovskite thin film and the reduced trap states on the TiO2 surface induced by the PEIE-2D MOF modification layer. Furthermore, the accelerated decay of VOC of the PSCs with the PEIE layer is probably due to the poor crystallinity of the perovskite active layer.39 Meanwhile, at the initial stage (immediately after the irradiation is started), the increase of VOC is obviously faster in the PSCs with the PEIE-2D MOF modified layer. In our previous work, we show that the slow decay of OCVD curves and fast VOC increase correspond to the absence of trap states and the improved performance of PSCs,33,34 which are consistent with the case of PSCs with the PEIE-2D MOF layer. TSCJ characteristics also reveal the reduced interface trap states and the increased crystallinity of the perovskite thin film on the PEIE-2D MOF, which can effectively accelerate the electron transfer process. As shown in Fig. 4d, the JSC of the PSCs with the PEIE-2D MOF layer increases more rapidly after the light is turned on than that of the control PSCs, indicating the fast electron transfer from the perovskite thin film to the PEIE-2D MOF/TiO2 ETL.38,39 The accelerated electron transfer process corresponds to the increased Fermi level of the modified TiO2 ETL and the crystallinity of the perovskite thin film. In contrast, the JSC of the PSCs with the PEIE modification layer increases more slowly after the light is turned on, further proving the poor electron transfer character induced by poor perovskite crystallinity.
Performance and stability of PSCs
The increased crystallinity of the perovskite film and the enhanced electron transfer resulting from the PEIE-2D MOF layer on the TiO2 ETL promote the harvesting of photocarriers, which definitely enhances the performance of PSCs. Planar PSCs without and with the modified layer were prepared under the same processing conditions but with different structures, as depicted in Fig. 5a. In a modified device, the PEIE-2D MOF composite layer was spin-coated on the TiO2 ETL, which can enhance the electron transfer and improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. The representative photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the normal and modified FA0.25MA0.75PbI3 PSCs are shown in Fig. 5b. Owing to the introduction of the PEIE-2D MOF modified layer, all of the photovoltaic parameters are improved; in particular, the efficiency of PSCs is increased from 20.42% (normal PSCs) to 22.22% (modified PSCs). The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated short-circuit current density are presented in Fig. 5c. The EQE measurements showing a high photo-to-current conversion efficiency over 90% at 410 nm indicate good utilization of photons in the short-wavelength (360–560 nm) region of sunlight. Furthermore, the integrated current densities of 21.72 mA cm−2, 22.92 mA cm−2 and 23.98 mA cm−2 for normal, PEIE-modified and PEIE-2D MOF-modified devices, respectively, are in good agreement with J–V results. As for the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the increase is not obvious after modification. The calculation formula of open-circuit voltage (VOC) is as follows:  where I0 is the dark saturation current related to recombination. VOC increases logarithmically with the decrease of I0. In this article, ISC ∼ 25 mA cm−2 and I0 ∼ 0.0021 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). I0 is an order of magnitude smaller than ISC. According to the growth law of the logarithmic curve, when ISC ≫ I0, the growth of VOC is limited. Therefore, the increase of VOC of the modified PSCs is not obvious. In addition, the efficiencies of all devices with different structures are summarized in Fig. 5d. All the samples modified by the PEIE-2D MOF showed a higher conversion efficiency, which verified the optimization effect of the PEIE-2D MOF on the PSCs. Both normal and modified PSCs show a narrow distribution of PCE with median values of 20.41%, 18.62% and 21.25%. Moreover, the decreased efficiency of the PEIE-modified PSCs is mainly attributed to the poor crystallinity of the perovskite film, as proved above. The introduction of the modified layer has little effect on the hysteresis of PSCs, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

(b) Representative J–V characteristic curves of PSCs with and without the modification layer.

Efficiency data were collected every 12 hours. 
To further explore the effect of the modified layer thickness on the device performance. We prepared modified material precursors (the PEIE original solution diluted with 2-methoxyethanol) to weight concentration gradients of 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.6%. The 2D MOF at the amounts of 0, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg was added into 1 mL of PEIE aqueous solution, respectively. The mixture was sonicated for 5 h in an ice-water bath. A series of modified material precursors with different concentrations were coated on the TiO2 ETL in the solar cell. The higher the concentration of the precursor, the thicker the modified layer. The effects of different concentrations (thickness) of the PEIE-2D MOF on the TiO2 surface morphology, perovskite crystallinity and device performance were investigated. The PEIE-2D MOF precursors with different concentrations were coated on the surface of the TiO2 ETL, and the corresponding morphologies were characterized by AFM, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It can be seen that the surface of the TiO2 particles is covered by an ultra-thin film, but it has a negligible effect on the surface roughness (∼14 nm) of the TiO2 ETL. Similarly, the crystallinity of the perovskite deposited on different TiO2 ETLs is basically the same, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). However, when the weight concentration of the PEIE-2D MOF modification precursors exceeds 0.1%, the conversion efficiency of PSCs degrades significantly. This can be seen from the I–V curves and the performance data shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). We believe that the decrease in efficiency is mainly caused by the electrical insulation of the thicker PEIE-2D MOF modification layer.
In Fig. 5e, we show the evolution of device performance over time under continued AM 1.5G illumination for normal and modified PSCs. The devices were measured in air, without encapsulation. Apparently, the normal PSCs suffered great degradation, falling to less than 60% of their initial efficiency, after 84 h of continued illumination, which resulted from the excited trap states in TiO2. This degradation process is consistent with previous reports.21,27 In contrast, the performance of the modified PSCs with the PEIE-2D MOF layer decreases much more slower than that of the normal PSCs, which retain more than 83% of their initial performance within 84 h of illumination. The decay curves of the detailed performance parameters are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). As proved above, the injected electrons from the PEIE-2D MOF layer can passivate the trap states in TiO2. In addition, the photoelectrons can transfer into the ETL more effectively with low recombination, resulting in improved illumination stability of PSCs. In addition, although the device conversion efficiency decreased after being modified by PEIE, its stability was significantly improved based on the effective passivation of PEIE on the trap states in TiO2.
Conclusions
In summary, to reduce the interface carrier loss, a composite modified film of PEIE and tellurophene-based 2D MOF was prepared on the surface of TiO2, which can realize nondestructive interfacial passivation. The experimental results show that the PEIE-2D MOF layer could improve the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film, reduce the surface trap states in TiO2, and enhance the electron transport. The efficiency of PEIE-2D MOF-modified PSCs was enhanced from 20.42% to 22.22%. Even after 84 h of continuous AM 1.5G illumination, the device still maintained more than 83% of the initial efficiency in air without encapsulation. This work provides an effective approach to suppress photoelectric loss in highly efficient and stable PSCs.
