    , Accepted 30th November 2016First published on 30th November 2016AbstractEfforts toward developing efficient and stable inorganic hole transport materials for inverted perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells are underway. Herein, a wide bandgap p-type quaternary chalcogenide Cu2BaSnS4 semiconductor is demonstrated as a promising hole transport material in inverted perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 thin-film solar cells owing to its satisfactory chemical stability, high carrier mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1), and suitable band alignment with CH3NH3PbI3. Our inverted solar cell based on a 100 nm thick Cu2BaSnS4 hole transport layer achieves a best PCE of ∼10% with a low degree of current–voltage scan hysteresis.
Introduction
Perovskite methylammonium triiodoplumbate CH3NH3PbI3 (MaPbI3) has attracted tremendous attention because of its superb optoelectronic properties enabling highly efficient (∼20%) photovoltaic devices.1–4 The general perovskite PV device structure comprises a MaPbI3 absorber layer sandwiched between a hole transport layer (HTL) and an electron transport layer (ETL), with a transparent conducting glass substrate and a metal back electrode. p-Type organic materials, such as poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA),2 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS),4,5 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro),3 have commonly been employed as HTLs in highly efficient perovskite solar cells. But these organic materials are susceptible to degradation in moisture and air and also expensive due to their complicated synthesis procedures and high-purity requirements. In addition, organic hole transport materials such as PEDOT:PSS,6 which is acidic and hygroscopic, are not chemically benign to perovskite absorbers and suffer from degradation mechanisms that preclude long term high performance. These issues caused by using organic charge transport materials have been the motivation to search for alternative inorganic hole transport materials.7 In addition to material stability and chemical compatibility, the selection of HTL materials should also take into account the hole mobility and the band alignment with MaPbI3, since all of these factors are critical to determining the hole collection/extraction and carrier separation/injection which are directly associated with solar cell performance metrics such as short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc).8–10 As for the band positions, the conduction band (CB) of hole transport materials should be higher than that of MaPbI3 (ECB = −3.93 V) to enable a robust energy barrier to prevent electrons from approaching the MaPbI3/CBTS interface where they may recombine with holes due to the increased defect density at that location; the valence band (VB) should nearly match that of MaPbI3 (EVB = −5.43 V). Device simulation suggests that hole transport materials with an optimal VB of 0–0.2 V lower than that of MaPbI3 are advantageous to attain high Voc by minimizing interfacial recombination.11
Inorganic p-type transition metal oxides, for instance, CrOx,12 WOx,13 MoOx,14 V2O5,15,16 NiO,17–21 have been successfully introduced as HTL materials in perovskite solar cells owing to their low cost, chemical stability, and better carrier mobility than the organic materials. Among these inorganic hole transport materials, NiO appears to be a promising candidate that enables power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 16–17%, due to its deep-lying valence band (EVB = −5.3 V) matching well with that of MaPbI3 (EVB = −5.43 V). In view of the electronic band structure of metal oxides, the valence band maximum (VBM) is primarily made of the fully filled oxygen 2p6 states and the conduction band minimum (CBM) primarily consists of the unoccupied ns0 orbitals of the metal cations. Due to the large spatial distribution of s orbitals, the CBM is highly dispersive and leads to a small electron effective mass, which will provide a facial pathway for the conduction of electrons.22,23 Thus, n-type oxides can exhibit high electron mobility, such as SnO2 and TiO2 which have already demonstrated the ability as superb electron transport materials in highly efficient (19–20%) perovskite solar cells and in other photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, this stands in sharp contrast to the p-type oxides, where the conductivities still lag far behind the n-type oxides. This limitation is generally thought as a result of the localization of the oxygen 2p states in the VB.22,24 Oxygen is a relatively small atom and has a strong electronegative nature, thus it is difficult to introduce shallow acceptor levels and the VB is also very flat. As a result, p-type oxides usually exhibit a large hole effective mass, small hole mobility, and poor p-type conductivity, which will in turn result in large series resistances and poor fill factors of the solar devices using these materials as charge transport layers. To alleviate the electronegative character of oxygen and obtain a dispersive valence band (i.e. small hole effective mass and high hole mobility), Hosono and co-workers proposed an insightful concept of chemical modulation of the valence band (CMVB) by incorporating highly electronegative cations with energy filled levels comparable to oxygen 2p states (e.g. closed shell Cu 3d10 orbitals) to increase the metal–oxygen hybridization.25,26 This concept led to the discovery of a series of Cu+-based p-type oxides as shown in Table 1, such as delafossite M–Cu–O (M = Al, Cr, Ga, Sr), wherein only Cu2O exhibits the best hole mobility (∼90 cm2 V−1 s−1) that is on the level of those of the n-type oxides. The high mobility of Cu2O is due to its tetrahedral coordination leading to larger dispersion of the valence band.25–27 With such a good hole mobility and deep-lying valence band (EVB = −5.4 V), Cu2O has been shown to be a superb hole transport material in inverted perovskite solar cells with PCE exceeding 19%.28–30 Owing to a ∼2 eV bandgap, Cu2O is not completely transparent in the visible spectral region, but this does not inflict severe absorption losses on perovskite absorbers when Cu2O layer thickness was controlled to be ultrathin (<20 nm). However, it's difficult to grow a single-phase Cu2O ultrathin film without CuO secondary phases. The presence of CuO components may incur severe interfacial recombination and limit cell Voc, because CuO with a smaller bandgap of 1.3 eV exhibits a lower conduction band (ECB = −4.1 V) than MaPbI3 (ECB = −3.93 V).28,30 As seen from Table 1, Cu+-based oxides except Cu2O still suffer from poor p-type conductivity, namely, small hole mobility and concentration. In this regard, oxides might not possibly be the best choices for use as hole transport materials.

Also, the CMVB concept can be extended into the areas of Cu+-based oxychalcogenides, chalcogenides, and halides as shown in Table 1 which are expected to have better p-type natures than oxides. Because the p orbitals of chalcogens (Ch = S, Se, and Te) and halogens (Ha = Cl, Br, I) are more delocalized than those of oxygen, the replacement of oxygen by chalcogens/halogens can create stronger hybridization between Cu 3d10 and Ch/Ha p orbitals and lead to a more dispersive valence band and better p-type conductivity.22,23 Thus, Cu+-based halides and chalcogenides may be more promising as HTL material candidates, wherein Cu2ZnSnS4,31 CuI,32,33 and CuSCN34–36 have been used in perovskite solar cell devices and 15–16% PCE's have been achieved. However, Cu2ZnSnS4 exhibits deep cation antisite defects (e.g. Cu on Zn) and severe defect-related band tailing, therefore it suffers from the issues of low carrier mobility and severe carrier recombination which are detrimental to device performances;31,37 recent reports suggest that CuI and CuSCN may not be chemically stable to the MaPbI3 absorber and cannot as well sustain stable high-performance outputs against moderate heat and moisture.38,39 These results suggest that the exploration of new inorganic semiconductors serving as stable and efficient hole transport materials is an urgent need. Table 1 offers more choices of inorganic p-type materials, for instance, degenerated Cu+-based chalcogenides and oxychalcognides (BaCu2Ch2, BaCuChF, and LaCuOCh), post-transition metal ns2 based oxide (Ba2BiTaO6), and TaIrGe (half-Heusler), which with superb p-type conductivities and wide bandgaps may also deserve investigation as hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells.
Recently, a new class of wide bandgap Cu+-based quaternary chalcogenides within the trigonal and orthorhombic system of CuI2(Sr, Ba, Eu)II(Ge, Sn)IV(S, Se)VI4 has attracted academic attention. These compounds are p-type semiconductors due to Cu deficiency,40–42 suggesting that Cu vacancies are the intrinsic hole producers. As known, Cu vacancies with low formation energy are shallow acceptor levels and readily ionizable. Other defects in these compounds such as antisite defects among the metal cations and anion vacancies (hole killers) are deep levels with high formation energies, due to the large differences in size and electronic properties among the constituent cation elements.43–45 Thus, these compounds can exhibit less band tailing and better carrier mobility as compared to Cu2ZnSnS4 and organic charge transport materials,2 which are preferred for efficient HTL candidates. In this work, the system member trigonal Cu2BaSnS4 (CBTS) thin films were shown, for the first time, to have the capacity of serving as hole transport materials in inverted perovskite solar cells and attained a ∼10% PCE.
Results and discussion
CBTS thin films were prepared by post-sulfurization of co-sputtered precursor films on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates. Fig. 1a shows the morphological scanning electron microscope image of a ∼100 nm thick CBTS film grown on the FTO substrate, where 100–200 nm grains can be clearly seen. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) analysis suggests that the CBTS grain shows a Cu deficient composition with an atomic ratio of Cu/Ba ≈ 0.8, which is beneficial to the formation of Cu vacancies. Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of two sulfurized CBTS films with the thickness of ∼100 nm and ∼150 nm. Multiple diffraction reflections from the trigonal BaCu2SnS4 (P31, PDF 97-005-2685) are observed, which indicate that these sulfurized films are single-phase highly crystalline films. Lattice constants of a = 6.367 Å and c = 15.833 Å were calculated from the XRD reflections, consistent with those from BaCu2SnS4 (P31, PDF 97-005-2685). Raman spectra of these two CBTS films shown in Fig. 1b show four visible vibrational peaks with the dominant one at 342 cm−1, which correspond well to trigonal CBTS.41 XRD and Raman peak intensities increase with CBTS film thickness.

Fig. 2a shows optical transmission spectra of CBTS films with different layer thicknesses grown on the FTO substrate. The low IR transmittance observed for these CBTS films arises from the high reflectance of free carriers in the degenerated FTO substrate, which suggests that the FTO substrate remains conductive and intact after sulfurization annealing. We additionally find that the optical transmittance in the visible wavelength region increases with the decrease of CBTS layer thickness. A sharp and straight decrease in optical transmittance at ∼610 nm (∼2.04 eV) suggests a nearly direct absorption edge (namely, bandgap Eg) of CBTS, which is further confirmed by a direct bandgap plot in Fig. 2b. Above the bandgap, we additionally observe three absorption onsets at ∼530 nm (2.34 eV) and ∼430 nm (2.88 eV) from the optical transmission spectra, which may correspond to the optical transitions involving one valence band and two conduction bands.44

Note: optical transmission spectrum of one intact FTO substrate is included in panel (a) for comparison; absorption coefficient α of CBTS in panel (b) is derived from transmittance (T) in panel (a) and film thickness (d) based on the expression . 
In order to evaluate the optoelectronic characteristics of CBTS, we carried out the photoelectrochemical measurements for a ∼500 nm thick CBTS film grown on a FTO substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a, cathodic photocurrents were produced under the illumination of a 300 W xenon lamp, indicating that our CBTS film is a p-type semiconductor. The p-type character is further confirmed by the negative slopes of the measured Mott–Schottky (MS) plots of capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiles with selected frequencies shown in Fig. 3b. The linear part of the MS plot can yield the flat band potential EFB ≈ +1.01–+1.04 VRHE (i.e. −5.51–−5.64 VVAC) and the carrier density Na ≈ 3–5 × 1016 cm−3 of CBTS film based on the expression , where A is the area of the CBTS electrode, e is the element electron charge, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, εr ≈ 5.5 is the relative dielectric constant of CBTS, and kT = 0.0259 eV at room temperature. The CBTS Fermi level, EF ≈ 0.14–0.13 eV, above the valence band maximum (VBM) can be estimated based on the expression , where the effective density of states in the valence band .46 With the assumption of EF = EFB, we further obtain the valence band maximum EVB ≈ +1.14–1.18 VRHE (i.e. −5.64–−5.69 VVAC), which is 0.21–0.26 V (or 0.04–0.09 V) lower than that of MaPbI3 (EVB = −5.43 VVAC or −5.6 VVAC (ref. 47)) as shown in Fig. 3b inset. It should be pointed out that the band positions derived by MS plots may show some deviations from those obtained by vacuum based methods such as ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.48 Tetragonal MaPbI3 with lattice constants of a = 8.849 Å and c = 12.642 Å exhibits a large lattice misfit with trigonal CBTS, Δa/a = 28%. The lattice-mismatched CBTS/MaPbI3 interface may lead to copious misfit locations which may create deep defect levels acting as interface recombination centers and cause high interface recombination velocities (>106 cm s−1).49 Therefore, photogenerated holes and electrons may recombine via these interfacial defect levels, which ultimately inflicts a severe reduction on the device Voc.8,50 This slightly lower VBM of CBTS compared to MaPbI3 may keep holes in CBTS away from electrons in MaPbI3, which therefore facilitates minimizing the interface recombination velocity.11 The resistivity of CBTS was roughly estimated to be ρ ≈ 20 Ω cm by four-point probe electrical measurements in the dark, consistent with that of its isostructural Cu2SrSnS4.51 The bulk mobility of CBTS can be further obtained to be , higher than those of most of the oxides and chalcogenides listed in Table 1. We believe that high-quality epitaxial CBTS film can show even higher carrier mobility due to the absence of grain boundary scattering prevalent in polycrystalline films. Overall, characteristics such as the p-type nature, good carrier mobility, and suitable valence band alignment with MaPbI3 suggest that CBTS may hold promise to serve as a hole transport material in inverted MaPbI3 thin-film solar cells.

Perovskite MaPbI3 absorber layers were prepared on CBTS by post-annealing of spin-coated precursors at 120 °C for 15 min in a glovebox. After annealing, blackish perovskite films were obtained without visible color degradation even after storage in a N2 filled desiccator for three weeks (Fig. S1†). XRD patterns in Fig. 2a show that single-phase MaPbI3 films with a tetragonal structure (I4cm, PDF 97-025-0739) are highly crystalline on CBTS coated FTO substrates. These observations suggest that CBTS is thermodynamically stable and chemically benign to serve as a hole transport material in inverted device structures. Perovskite thin-film solar cells were completed by the deposition of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETLs and Ag back electrodes. Panels (a), (b), and (c) of Fig. 4 show the cross-sectional SEM images of these perovskite solar cells based on CBTS HTLs with different thicknesses. We do not observe any secondary phases segregating at CBTS/MaPbI3 interfaces. Fig. S2† additionally shows the cross-sectional SEM images of these CBTS based MaPbI3 devices after being stored in the N2 filled desiccator for three weeks. After such a long-term storage, no apparent trace of degradation at CBTS/MaPbI3 interfaces was observed either. These confirm again that CBTS is chemically benign to perovskite absorbers, in contrast with ZnO52–54 CuI,39 CuSCN,38 and PEDOT:PSS.6,55

Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these inverted perovskite solar cells using CBTS HTLs under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, with the corresponding device parameters given in Table 2. As seen, the J–V curves of our perovskite solar cells show some degrees of hysteresis under different voltage scan directions. Fig. 5c shows the statistical box charts of device parameters from these CBTS based inverted perovskite solar cells. With the decrease of CBTS layer thickness, the perovskite solar cell device shows improved Voc, Jsc, and PCE. A 100 nm thick CBTS HTL leads to our inverted perovskite solar cell achieving a best PCE of ∼10%. External quantum efficiency (EQE) data of these CBTS based perovskite cells in Fig. 5b confirm that perovskite absorber layers contribute most of the photogenerated current. The abrupt decrease at 770 nm (∼1.6 eV) in EQE curves indicate the bandgap value of MaPbI3 absorbers. For comparison, we also place the optical transmission spectra of glass/FTO/CBTS with different CBTS layer thicknesses together with the EQE curves in Fig. 5c. In the spectral region from 610 nm to 300 nm, EQE curve shapes are conformal to those of the transmission spectra of glass/FTO/CBTS, with three sharp declines at ∼610 nm (∼2.04 eV), ∼530 nm (2.34 eV), and ∼430 nm (2.88 eV) corresponding well to the absorption onsets of CBTS HTLs. Notably, EQE values are significantly larger than the optical transmittances in the spectral region below ∼610 nm (∼2.04 eV), suggesting that CBTS layers may contribute extra photocurrents (Fig. 3a) by the absorption of photon energies greater than the bandgap of CBTS (∼2.04 eV). With the decrease of CBTS layer thickness, EQE values measured in the full spectral region increase as the optical transmittance of glass/FTO/CBTS. This observation suggests that thinner CBTS layers may allow more light irradiation to reach MaPbI3 absorbers and generate more photocarriers to enhance the splitting of the quasi Fermi levels in MaPbI3; hereby, solar cells based on thinner CBTS layers exhibit the increased Jsc and Voc. The integrated Jsc values from these EQE curves shown in Fig. S3† are consistent with the values from the J–V measurements.

For comparison, we include our best device results from FTO/MaPbI3/PCBM/Ag, FTO/PEDOT:PSS/MaPbI3/PCBM/Ag, and FTO/TiO2/MaPbI3/Spiro/Au solar cells in Fig. S4 and Table S1.† Compared to the HTL-free devices, CBTS based inverted perovskite solar cells demonstrate overall enhanced device performances with less hysteresis. However, our PEDOT:PSS based inverted cells, with a low Voc (<0.93 V) and a low Jsc (<14 mA cm−2), are not well-performing ones, possibly due to their non-optimized layer quality. Our CBTS based inverted perovskite solar cell still shows a limited Voc (∼0.94 V) and a low Jsc (∼14.9 mA cm−2), both of which fall short of the attainable values of our FTO/TiO2/MaPbI3/Spiro/Au solar cells (Fig. S4a and Table S1†). The issue of Voc & Jsc losses is due to the 100 nm thick CBTS layer which caused a significant absorption loss of the MaPbI3 absorber as shown by EQE data in Fig. 5c. We anticipate that this problem could be overcome by further reducing the CBTS layer thickness to 20 nm or even thinner as commonly used in the literature. However, it may be very challenging to deposit such an ultrathin, smooth, and uniform film via sputter deposition plus post-sulfurization heat treatment. Nonetheless, our device results presented here are still able to demonstrate that trigonal CBTS, a quaternary Cu-based chalcogenide, is promising as a hole transport material in inverted perovskite thin-film solar cells.
We additionally evaluated the device stability of our best inverted MaPbI3 solar cell based on the 100 nm thick CBTS HTL under ambient air conditions (relative humidity: ∼70%). As shown in Fig. S5a,† this device can basically sustain a stable power output within 30 min. However, after exposure to air for ∼60 min, S-shaped J–V curves appeared in this CBTS based cell and the PEDOTT:PSS based cell as shown in Fig. S5c and d,† indicating the degraded PCBM/Ag contacts.56 This rapid degradation of contacts possibly triggered by exposure to moisture has been observed for other perovskite solar cells as well.14,57
Conclusions
This work represents an important step toward developing efficient inorganic hole transport materials based on wide bandgap chalcogenides for inverted perovskite solar cells. For the first time, we show that trigonal Cu2BaSnS4 (CBTS) thin film with a bandgap of ∼2.04 eV is promising as a hole transport layer in FTO/CBTS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag inverted thin-film solar cells because of its satisfactory chemical stability, high mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1), and suitable band alignment with CH3NH3PbI3. Our inverted solar cell based on a 100 nm thick CBTS HTL demonstrates a best PCE of ∼10%, a low Voc of ∼0.94 V, and a low Jsc of ∼14.9 mA cm−2. The low Voc and Jsc issues arise from the layer thickness of CBTS which inflicts tremendous absorption losses on the perovskite absorber. To enhance the effective transparency of the CBTS HTL in the visible region by further reducing its thickness is one legitimate approach for the further improvement of device performances.

 	Fig. 1  Top-view SEM image of a 100 nm thick CBTS film grown on a FTO substrate (a); XRD patterns of 100 nm & 150 nm thick CBTS thin films and MaPbI3 thin films grown on these two CBTS films (b); Raman spectra of one FTO substrate and 100 nm & 150 nm thick CBTS thin films grown on FTO substrates (c). Note: in panel (b), the peaks marked by “*” at 2θ = 26.500°, 33.738°, 37.800°, 51.400°, 61.581°, and 65.540° correspond to the (110), (101), (200), (211), (310), and (301) reflections of the FTO substrate (SnO2, PDF 97-026-2768), respectively; the remaining peaks are indexed to trigonal BaCu2SnS4 (red markers in the top panel, P31, PDF 97-005-2685) and CH3NH3PbI3 (green markers in the top panel, I4cm, PDF 97-025-0739).	 

 	Fig. 2  Optical transmission spectra of 100 nm, 150 nm, and 500 nm thick CBTS thin films grown on a FTO substrate (a); a direct bandgap plot of (αhν)2 ∝ hν for bandgap estimation of CBTS thin films (b). Note: optical transmission spectrum of one intact FTO substrate is included in panel (a) for comparison; absorption coefficient α of CBTS in panel (b) is derived from transmittance (T) in panel (a) and film thickness (d) based on the expression .	 

 	Fig. 3  Linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves under chopped light (a) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) derived Mott–Schottky (MS) plots with selected frequencies (b) of a glass/FTO/CBTS PEC electrode. Panel (b) inset illustrates the band alignment of CBTS and MaPbI3, with the red arrows showing the interface recombination via interfacial defects. All the measurements were carried out using a 3-electrode configuration in a neutral electrolyte (pH = 6.4) in the dark. VRHE – voltage vs. reversible hydrogen electrode; VVAC – voltage vs. vacuum energy level; VB-valence band, CB-conduction band.	 

 	Fig. 4  Cross-sectional SEM images of CBTS based inverted MaPbI3 thin-film solar cells with different CBTS layer thicknesses: (a) 100 nm, (b) 150 nm, and (c) 500 nm.	 

 	Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics obtained with AM 1.5G illumination under reverse (Voc → Jsc) and forward (Jsc → Voc) voltage scans (a) and corresponding EQE curves (b) of our inverted MaPbI3 solar cells with different CBTS HTL thicknesses achieving the best performance; statistical results of device parameters of these CBTS based MaPbI3 solar cells (c). Note: these devices were measured immediately as obtained under ambient air conditions (relative humidity: 70%); cell area-0.08 cm2.
