    , Accepted 28th January 2022First published on 16th February 2022AbstractRecently, quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as those obtained by introducing long-chain organic cations like n-butylammonium (BA) into 3D MAPbI3 perovskites, have been widely investigated as optoelectronic devices owing to their high light absorption coefficient, ultra-long carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance. Controlling the BA content to obtain (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with homogeneous n values is crucial for extraction of photo-carriers because volatile n value related interior heterojunctions are unfavorable for extraction of photo-carriers. Here, we revealed the fundamental growth mechanism of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1. The growth mechanism of (BA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 SCs is controlled by the evolution of macroscopic spiro dislocations and its derived growth steps. In terms of the understanding of the surface growth mechanism, we grew a series of single crystals with individual n values, avoiding interior heterojunctions, and obtained a lower dark current of 0.247 nA, a high photocurrent (74.5 nA) and high responsiveness (0.064 A W−1) and an external quantum efficiency of 19.5% for a photodetector based on the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SC. This contributes to an in-depth understanding of the growth mechanism of quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 SCs and the development and optimization of quasi-2D layered materials and devices for optoelectronics.
1 Introduction
The three-dimensional (3D) methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite is widely applied in various optoelectronic devices such as sensitized solar cells, photo-detectors, lasers, and light emitting diodes and in catalysis1–10 due to its direct band gap, long carrier migration, high light absorption coefficient, and high defect tolerance.11–19 Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has exceeded 25.5%, comparable to that of silicon solar cells.20
However, the intrinsic instability of the 3D perovskite against moisture and light has seriously impeded its commercialization process. Great endeavors are proposed to improve the instability, among which partially replacing the organic ions by larger counterparts to construct quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites is proved to be an efficient way.21–24 The general quasi-2D perovskite formula is A2Bn−1PbnX3n+1, where A is a hydrophobic long alkyl chain or aromatic cation, such as C4H9NH3+ (BA+) or C6H5CH2CH2NH3+ (PEA+);25–27B is a small molecular cation, such as CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+), Cs+, etc;28,29X is the halogen anion (Cl−, Br−, and I−); and n stands for the thickness of the inorganic layer.30–34 The size and shape of the organic cations A and B jointly determine the rotation and tilt of the Pb–I octahedron in the inorganic layer, which in turn changes the structure of the quasi-2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, thereby making the photoelectric properties of the perovskite change.35–38
At present, the solution method is the most commonly used method to prepare organic–inorganic lead halide quasi-2D perovskite single crystals (SCs). For instance, Mitzi39 presented a low-temperature (<100 °C) aqueous solution growth technique for preparing (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) SCs. Chinnambedu et al.40 reported that millimeter-sized quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) SCs can be grown by a slow solvent evaporation strategy. The as-grown quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 SCs exhibit excellent crystallinity, phase purity, and spectral uniformity. Kai Leng et al.41 synthesized centimeter-sized (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 SCs using a temperature-programmed crystallization method, from which a large-sized monolayer perovskite sheet can be exfoliated. It was found that the photoresponsivity of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 is dependent on the thickness of the layers, where carriers and excitons cross through. As is known, in quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, a large van der Waals gap occurs between two large organic insulating spacer cations, which is detrimental to structural integrity and stability and to the carrier transport and transfer between the adjacent inorganic framework layers.42
The introduction of the growth mechanism of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (BMPI) SCs has not been clearly reported in these studies. Therefore, in order to explore the detailed structural properties of BMPI and the influence of its surface morphology on the growth mechanism, we have successfully grown high-quality quasi-two-dimensional layered perovskite BMPI SCs with different sizes and ratios by slow solution cooling. The basic steps and bunching steps of the (020) crystal plane of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs were observed to be caused by screw dislocations. In terms of the understanding of the surface growth mechanism, we obtained pure phase BMPI SCs with individual n values and characterized their photoelectric properties.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Unexpected staggered interior heterojunctions in quasi-2D (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1
Large-scale BMPI SCs can be grown via a cooling method as previously reported.43 Nucleation preferentially occurs at the solution–air interface, thus forming small and thin wafers (Fig. S3, ESI†), because BA cations are likely to align at the interface as nucleation templates through reducing the interfacial tension. With the increase of the BA:MA ratio (from 0 to 100%), as shown in Fig. 1a, the color of the crystals changes from black to rose red to orange. Besides, the increase of BA is beneficial for the growth rate. The solubility of BA is lower than that of MA in HI acid, and thus the addition of BA lowers the solubility of BMPI.44 In BMPI perovskites, inorganic layers can be controlled through altering BA bilayers, which leads to the change of the BMPI crystal structure from 3D to a quasi-2D structure.
 Fig. 1  (a) Photographs of BMPI SCs and (b) 1H NMR spectra of BMPI recorded in DMSO-d6. 
To determine the real BA contents in the crystals, NMR spectra were recorded (Fig. 1b). The real BA contents in SCs are different from those in the solution. The BA content in the crystal that was grown from the precursor solution (BA: 25%) increases to 40%, which is significantly higher than that in the precursor solution. The 40% BA content in the crystal indicates that it is (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4), and its crystallization energy is lower compared with (BA)2(MA)6Pb7I22. Analogously, when the BA content in the solution is 75%, its content in the crystal is about 67%, which is in accordance with the stoichiometry of (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (n = 2), proving that the BA content is a decisive factor for the crystal structure. Further, the NMR results revealed that, when the BA content is 50% in the solution, the BA content in the crystal is 50%, which is in accordance with the formula of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10. In addition, in solutions with 20% BA, it acts as an additive in the 3D structure of MAPbI3, and, in solutions with 80% BA, MA acts as an additive in the (BA)2PbI4 crystal.
The XRD patterns of BMPI powders are shown in Fig. 2a, and are similar to previous reports.39–41,43 With the increase of BA content, the thickness of the inorganic layer becomes thinner. 3D MAPbI3 belongs to a tetragonal system (space group: I4/mcm); with the incorporation of BA into the crystal lattice, the 3D tetragonal structure is interrupted and the quasi-2D structure transforms from tetragonal to orthorhombic. The fundamental crystal structure characteristics of the quasi-2D structure with various n values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). When the BA content is over 80% or lower than 20%, the diffraction peaks are similar to those of 2D (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) and 3D MAPbI3 (n = ∞), confirming that MA and BA are additives in the perovskite, respectively. When the BA content is 25% (n = 4), the powder diffraction peaks in Fig. 2b show that the primary phase is (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4). Slight (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) is also detected, suggesting that three [PbI6]4− octahedral layers are hidden in the four [PbI6]4− octahedral layers in the SC and spontaneously form staggered interior heterojunctions. Similarly, (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) can appear in the interior of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3), which exhibits staggered interior heterojunctions as well.

The inset shows the I–V curves of BA2MA3Pb4I13 SCs (rate: 3 °C h−1) at various illumination powers using a 405 nm laser. 
The periodic repetition of the Miller planes confirms their one-fold n values on the crystal surface through plane XRD (Fig. 2c). According to the Bragg equation, the layer spacing d values for BMPI SCs with n = 1–4 are 1.385, 1.936, 2.623 and 3.189 nm, respectively.41 As the n value increases, the layer spacing increases, because multilayer hybrid perovskites are formed by n inorganic layers and two organic layers alternately superposed along the b axis, while monolayer perovskites are formed by alternating stacking of one inorganic and two organic layers along the c-axis. This may be a result of MA+ entering the voids of the inorganic layer, which leads to the distortion of the crystal structures, and thus the multilayer perovskites grow along the b-axis. It was further found that quasi-2D perovskites precipitate crystals between 55 and 70 °C, which may be related to the ratio of BA and MAI in solution, since the solubilities of BA and MAI are different at different temperatures. The maximum exposed surface of the (BA)2PbI4 crystal (n = 1) is (001). However, when MA is incorporated, the exposed surface of the BMPI crystal (n > 1) becomes the (020) plane that is perpendicular to the (002) plane, which clearly indicates the vertical growth of the perovskite crystal. In the plane XRD pattern of n = 3 (or 4), there are no diffraction peaks of the n = 4 (or 3) value perovskite. Upon comparing with the powder XRD pattern of n = 3 (or 4), the diffraction peaks of the other perovskite appear, indicating that the perovskites with n = 3 and 4 exist in the other perovskite's crystal rather than on the crystal surface, suggesting that the staggered heterojunctions form the interior of the crystals. We also observed two different height steps of 2.61 and 3.25 nm in the 2D AFM for n = 4, which is consistent with the crystal plane spacing for n = 3 and 4, and hence the presence of the heterojunction in the n = 4 SC (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†), which is unfavorable for carrier extraction unless the electrodes are fabricated on each quasi-2D BMPI SC, as shown in Fig. 2e and f. A photo-detector based on the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SC (n = 4) was fabricated and a series of I–V curves were recorded under 405 nm laser irradiation (Fig. 2f). The photocurrents are slightly higher than the dark current, proving that the staggered heterojunctions are indeed unfavorable for carrier extraction.
The appearance of interior staggered heterojunctions is most likely due to the rapid cooling rate, which leads to inhomogeneous temperature fluctuations and further brings variable crystallization rates for (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, respectively. Besides, rapid cooling also causes macroscopic surface defects. Fig. S5a and b (ESI†) show the 2D AFM topology on the (002) plane of the initially grown (BA)2PbI4 (BA = 20%) SC, and a large number of cavities appear on the surface (Fig. S5c–h, ESI†). The depth of the cavity reaches 9.82 nm, which is equivalent to the height of seven fundamental steps. The existence of the cavity can pin the motion of growth steps and bring liquid inclusions, ultimately affecting the photoelectric performance.

Fig. 3a and b depict the UV-vis and PL spectra of the quasi-2D perovskite with various BA/MA ratios. The absorption capability is dependent on the n value. For n = 1 or ∞, the sharp absorption onsets reveal their single band gap and the presence of multiple band gaps in quasi-2D perovskites (n = 2–4), which is consistent with the powder XRD results. With the increase of BA, the PL peaks move from 811 nm to 521 nm. Interestingly, (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 crystals display three and two distinct Gaussian peaks (Fig. 3d). These weak Gaussian PL peaks are attributed to the formation of crystals with a similar n value structure (n < 4 or 3), while the strong Gaussian peaks are attributed to (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 SCs. The existence of the interior heterojunction in the crystal is not conducive to the separation of carriers (Fig. 2f). Thus, precisely controlling the nucleation rate and the evolution of the interior layer with a single n value is crucial for quasi-2D BMPI SCs.

2.2 Screw dislocation generation and step motion
On the smooth (020) planes of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs, macroscopic screw dislocations are observed, as shown in Fig. 4a–c and Fig. S6 (ESI†), exhibiting a helical ladder-like structure. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the crystal growth is controlled by spiral dislocations in both fast and slow growing crystals. Screw dislocations are considered to be the source of growth steps whose slopes and motions are pivotal for the growth of SCs with low defects. The origin of screw dislocation is generally ascribed to the atomic mismatch, and a perfect crystal is determined through its evolution.45–47 Here, BA plays a key role in helical configurations (Fig. 4a–c). For (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 SCs (n = 2), multiple screw dislocation sources encounter each other, causing grooves and jaggy crystal surfaces. The growth steps, induced from screw dislocations, regularly move in terms of its crystallographic orientations. Fig. 4d–f illustrate the octagonal, circular and rectangular screw morphologies of BMPI SCs (n = 2–4), respectively. Here, α represents the helix angles of the two steps with different trends, and β and L stand for the angles and lengths of each step, respectively. Apparently, with the increase of the BA content, the α number decreases and β reaches close to simple crystallographic orientations with lower diffraction indices. Besides, according to the size ratios of inner to outer screw dislocation lines, with the evolution of the growth steps, the slope of outer steps is lower than that of the inner steps near the screw dislocation sources, which is beneficial for growing crystals with low defects.48
 Fig. 4  (a–c) Characterization of screw dislocations of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs (magnification scale: 50); (d–f) simplified diagram of the screw dislocation of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs. 

Fig. 5a shows the arrangement of [PbI6] octahedra on the (020) plane of BMPI SCs. The screw dislocation lines within a single inorganic layer are developed according to the quadrilateral, and the edge of the screw dislocation lines corresponds to the steps of [101] and [−101]. Theoretically, the motion velocities of the two steps along the [101] and [−101] directions are equivalent. However, as shown in Fig. 5b and c, blue and orange colors represent Pb atoms in different inorganic layers, respectively, and the offset between two connected [PbI6] inorganic layers causing the vertical growth of the crystal is not completely perpendicular to the (020) plane, resulting in inconsistent growth velocities along the [101] and [−101] directions within the (020) plane. Ultimately, the inconsistent growth velocities originate from screw dislocations with various shapes. In addition, the appearance of screw dislocations with various shapes is also related to the n value that represents the number of layers of [PbI6] octahedron stacking in the inorganic layer (Fig. 5c). The difference [PbI6] octahedrons inorganic layers makes the crew dislocations octagons, circles and quadrangles shapes (Fig. 4d). The various shapes of the screw dislocations require that the growth of BMPI SCs should be under a rigid super-saturation controlling process, and fortunately screw dislocation growth of a crystal supports growth under low super-saturation.
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic diagram of the arrangement of atoms on the (020) plane; (b) arrangement of atoms with the evolution of screw dislocations; and (c) step diagram of BMPI (n = 3) perovskite SC. 
Thus, we grew BMPI SCs at a low cooling rate of 0.5 °C h−1 (Fig. 6a), and it can be seen that n = 1–3 and ∞ show the same color and shape as the crystal grown at a cooling rate of 3 °C h−1. However, the irregular shape of n = 4 may be related to the different crystallization speeds caused by the cooling rate, which affects the final morphology of the crystal. The higher transparency of BMPI SCs grown at a low cooling rate proves a better crystalline quality. To verify the internal uniformity of BMPI SCs, their XRD patterns and optical properties were characterized. No diffraction peaks of other crystals are detected in the newly grown (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) SCs, indicating their high interior uniformity (Fig. 6b and c). Meanwhile, Fig. 6d and e show the absorption spectra and Tauc plots of quasi-2D BMPI SCs with n = 1–∞. The sharp absorption onsets reveal their single band gap, and the corresponding optical band gap decreases monotonically with the increase of the n value. Due to the high quantum confinement effect within the inorganic layers, the strong exciton absorption occurs at low n values of BMPI SCs (n < 4).49 This confirms that low crystal growth rate is conducive to obtaining high-quality and pure phase SCs.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs are shown in Fig. 7a–c. They accurately reveal that BMPI SCs have an oriented layered structure, which is consistent with the XRD results. The thickness of the layers gradually increases with increasing n value. Besides, the 2D AFM surface structure on the (020) planes of BMPI SCs (n = 2–4) was observed in the tapping mode, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Compared with the BMPI SCs grown under rapid cooling rate, the smooth surface without obvious defects, such as holes, suggests that a slow growth rate is beneficial for obtaining high quality BMPI SCs. For (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SCs, the fundamental step heights are 1.90 ± 0.05, 2.60 ± 0.40 and 3.34 ± 0.30 nm, respectively, which are consistent with the crystal plane spacing of the (020) plane. In addition to the fundamental steps, bunched steps appear in (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13. As shown in Fig. S7f and g (ESI†), the bunched step heights of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 SCs are about 11.21 and 7.56 nm, corresponding to 4 and 3 fundamental steps, respectively. The bunched step heights of (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SCs consist of 2 basic steps and 4 fundamental steps (Fig. S7, ESI†). The coexistence of fundamental and bunching steps means that the (020) surface growth can be combined by various growth units, such as [Pb3I10]4−, [Pb2I7]3− and [PbI4]2−.50 The average width and length of the zigzag plane are 1.765 and 1.797 μm, respectively (Table S2, ESI† and Fig. 8b). The growth direction is elongated along the [−101] direction, and the short side is along the [101] direction. This is consistent with the growth direction of the screw dislocation in Fig. 5a, indicating that the trace of the growth steps is derived from the screw dislocation, which confirms that the growth mechanism of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs is determined by the screw dislocation.

Fig. 9a shows the PL spectra of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs grown at a rate of 0.5 °C h−1. Compared with the SCs grown at a rapid cooling rate, there is only one PL peak, indicating that the SCs are pure phases, which is consistent with the results of absorption spectroscopy. To reveal the recombination dynamics of photo-generated carriers, time-resolved PL spectra for the (020) and (202) planes of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs were obtained under excitation using a 485 nm xenon lamp, as shown in Fig. 9a and b. The carrier lifetime in the (020) plane is significantly longer than that in the (202) plane, because the diffusion of photo-generated carriers along the [202] direction is confined within the [Pb–I] inorganic layers, whereas the diffusion pathway along the [020] direction is vertical to the inorganic layers. For the (020) plane, BMPI SCs with n = 3 and 4 exhibit longer lifetimes, which is beneficial for a longer diffusion length, implying less defect related carrier recombination and excellent crystallization.51 It is pointed out that, in quasi-2D perovskites, appropriate depths of both organic layers and inorganic layers contribute to carrier transport and separation in perovskite solar cells.52

In order to further investigate the photoelectronic properties of the perovskite, photo-detector devices based on (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SCs were fabricated. The schematic diagram of the planar device structure is shown in Fig. 10a. Au interdigitated electrodes with a 150 μm width and a 50 nm thickness were formed on the blank area of the hollowed masks during the thermal evaporation process. Fig. 10b and c show the I–V curves of the photo-detectors based on BMPI (n = 3 and 4) SCs in the dark and at various illumination powers (405 nm laser). The (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) devices have low dark currents of 0.231 nA and 0.247 nA at 2.0 V, respectively. The photocurrent of the device depends on the light intensity, and it increases systematically with increasing light intensity. Compared with (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (4.86 nA), (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (74.5 nA) has a higher photocurrent at 2 V bias and a light power density of 0.127 mW cm−2. Obviously, the photocurrent of the device increases with the increase of the BA content, and the introduction of long chain BA ions at the MA site improves charge carrier transport and reduces charge carrier recombination. Therefore, the detection performance of (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 is the best. Fig. 10d shows the dark current of BMPI SCs grown at fast and slow cooling rates, and it is found that the dark current of the devices of the slow-growing crystal was three orders of magnitude lower than that of the detectors of the fast-growing crystal, and too fast cooling speed will lead to holes and residual solution inside the crystal, resulting in leakage current of the device. Therefore, compared with a slow-growing single crystal, a fast-growing crystal is relatively inferior in quality.

To quantitatively calculate the performance of perovskite photo-detectors, responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity(D) were calculated as follows: (1) (2) (3)where Ip and Id stand for the photocurrent and dark current, respectively, Pin is the 405 nm laser power density, S is the effective area of the photo-detector, h represents the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, e is the charge of the electron, and λ is the wavelength of the laser. It is clear from Fig. 10e, f and h, i that the R, EQE and D parameters are positively correlated with the applied voltage at a fixed illumination power. In addition, at 0.032 W cm−2 and 3 V bias, (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SCs exhibited the highest R (0.007 and 0.064 A W−1), EQE (2.3% and 19.5%) at 405 nm and D (7.24 × 1011 and 5.65 × 1012 Jones), respectively. Further study showed that the device had excellent switching characteristics: the photocurrent increased sharply under light irradiation and decreased rapidly without light irradiation. In addition, the on/off ratios of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 reach 129 and 158, respectively, at 2 V (Fig. 10g and j). (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 SC displays superior performance compared with some perovskite based photo-detectors, as shown in Table 1.

3 Experimental methods
3.1 Experimental materials
Lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(CH3COO)2·3(H2O), analytical grade), n-butylamine (BA, analytical grade), hydroiodic acid (HI, wt ≥ 47%), phosphoric acid (H3PO2, Aladdin), and methylamine aqueous solution (CH5N, analytical grade) were used in this study. All the raw materials were used without any further purification. The synthesis of methylamine iodide (MAI) is depicted in the ESI† and Fig. S1.
3.2 Single crystal growth
The crystal growth solutions were composed of two precursor solutions labeled as I and II. Solution I was prepared by dissolving 5 mmol of Pb(CH3COO)2·3(H2O) in 5 mL of HI and 850 μL of H3PO2 at 60 °C with stirring for 3 hours, as shown in Fig. S2a and b (ESI†). Solution II was prepared by dissolving BA and MAI (total amine amount: 5 mmol) with various molar ratios in 3 mL of HI in an ice-water bath (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†). Then solution II was slowly added into solution I at 60 °C, and a transparent yellow solution was obtained (Fig. S2e and f, ESI†). quasi-2D perovskite SCs were grown from the solution at rapid and slow cooling rates of 3 °C h−1 and 0.5 °C h−1 to room temperature. BMPI SCs with different n values can be successfully obtained in about 2 and 7 days. After completion of the crystal growth, the SCs were taken out of the solution and the residual solutions were cleaned using filter papers.
3.3 Device fabrication
The planar metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photo-detectors with interdigitated Au electrodes were fabricated on the polished (020) crystal surface of BMPI (n = 3 and 4) SCs by thermal evaporation (VZZ-300, Vnano). The interdigitated masks (3 × 3 mm2) were placed on the (020) surface and the interdigital width was 150 μm.
3.4 Characterization
The XRD patterns of raw materials and crystal powders, and the planar XRD patterns of single crystals were collected on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max2500PC). The UV-vis absorption spectra of BMPI (n = 1-∞) powders were recorded on a UV-8000 spectrometer with an integrating sphere over the spectral range of 470–1000 nm. Fluorescence spectra of BMPI were obtained using an FLS-980. The carrier lifetime was measured on a HORIBA Fluorolog-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system. The surface structures of the crystals were observed on an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Dimension Icon) in tapping mode. The surface morphologies of different BMPI SCs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, NOVA NANO SEM450). An optical microscope (OM) was also used to observe the surface structure of the crystals. The I–V curves were measured using an electrical characteristic measurement system (Keithley-2450). A series of photocurrents were collected under illumination using 405 nm InGaN-based semiconductor diodes. The incident light intensity was measured using a light power meter. Besides this, the continuous on/off photocurrents under various applied voltages were harvested through setting the on/off interval time (20 s). All the LEDs used in this study were calibrated using a standard Si CCD (DSI200, Zolix).
4 Conclusions
In short, the growth conditions of BMPI SCs were explored by optimizing the nucleation speed and using an appropriate cooling rate. It was first reported that the growth of the (020) crystal planes of BMPI (n = 2–4) SCs were controlled by screw dislocations. Based on the understanding of the surface mechanism, we adjusted the experimental conditions and successfully grew BMPI (n = 1-∞) SCs with a single n value, avoiding the internal heterojunctions, thereby enhancing the response of the planar photo-detectors.
