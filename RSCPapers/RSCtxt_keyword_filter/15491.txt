    , Accepted 17th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractA facile copper-promoted decarboxylative annulation of [60]fullerene (C60) with two identical α-oxocarboxylic acids via an unprecedented cascade addition pathway has been exploited to synthesize the unique epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones for the first time. Further transformations into the rare epoxy-bridged C60-fused hemiacetals and bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts as well as application in a perovskite solar cell device of the obtained products have also been demonstrated. The structures of the epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones and derived reductive products have been unequivocally established by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Plausible reaction mechanisms leading to the observed products are proposed.
Because of the huge potential applications in materials, nanoscience and biology,1 various derivatives of [60]fullerene (C60) with novel structures have been synthesized over the past few decades. Among them, the synthesis of C60-fused lactones and fullerenyl esters2–4 is important due to the ability of further functionalizations5 and application in organic photovoltaics.3 Our group has developed several methodologies to provide diverse fullerenyl esters and C60-fused lactones since 2005.2 The Matsuo group reported the FeCl3-mediated synthesis of fullerenyl esters by using carboxylic acids in 2012.3 Zhang, Zhu, and co-workers described the Mn(OAc)3-mediated synthesis of fullerene-fused fluorine-containing lactones also in 2012.4 Compared with the common C60-fused five-, six- and even seven-membered cyclic adducts, the bridged C60-fused compounds were rarely reported.6 Until now, there has been no report on the formation of bridged C60-fused lactones.
On the other hand, transition-metal-catalyzed/promoted decarboxylative coupling reactions using aryl carboxylic acids and α-oxocarboxylic acids as arylation and acylation reagents have attracted much attention since the only byproduct CO2 is nontoxic, nonflammable and easily removed from the reaction medium.7 In 2008, the Gooβen group first reported a Cu/Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction of α-oxocarboxylic acid salts with aryl bromides to afford diaryl ketones.8 Since then, the Wang,9 Jiang,10 Yotphan11 and other groups12 have extended this protocol to different decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions catalyzed or promoted by copper salts. In recent years, our group has also reported several transition-metal-catalyzed decarboxylative reactions of α-oxocarboxylic acids.13 In continuation of our interest in Pd14- and Cu15-catalyzed/promoted reactions of C60, we attempted the Pd-catalyzed reaction of C60 with α-oxocarboxylic acids in the presence of a copper salt in the hope of obtaining the expected C60-fused ketones (Scheme 1). Intriguingly, the unexpected epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones were generated instead. In addition, it was found that a copper salt alone could promote the reaction, and two α-oxocarboxylic acid molecules participated and evolved into products in an unprecedented cascade addition pathway. Herein, we report these new findings and further derivatizations of the obtained epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones.
 Scheme 1  Expected and unexpected products. 
In our initial study, we used commercially available 2-oxo-2-phenylacetic acid (1a) as the representative substrate to react with C60 to optimize the reaction conditions. After extensive screenings (for details, see Table S1, ESI†), the optimized conditions of this reaction were determined as follows to achieve better yield along with good recovery of C60: C60 (0.05 mmol), 1a (0.15 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (0.10 mmol) in anhydrous chlorobenzene (6 mL) at 150 °C for 12 h.
With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we next explored the scope of α-oxocarboxylic acids (1). As shown in Scheme 2, different substituent groups on the phenyl ring of 1 were tolerated in this transformation. Substrates with methyl, phenyl, methoxy, chloro and bromo groups at the para- and/or meta-position of the phenyl ring of 1b–l could be smoothly transformed into the corresponding products 2b–l in 29–52% yields. 2-(Benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (1m) and 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxoacetic acid (1n) could also react with C60 to provide products 2m and 2n in 33% and 44% yields, respectively (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Results for the Cu-promoted reaction of C60 with α-oxocarboxylic acids 1a–n. aUnless otherwise noted, the reactions were performed in a sealed tube with C60 (0.05 mmol), 1 (0.15 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (0.10 mmol) in anhydrous chlorobenzene (6 mL) heated in an oil bath at 150 °C for 12 h. bIsolated yield. Values in parentheses were based on consumed C60. cThe reaction time was 10 h. dThe temperature was 140 °C. eThe reaction time was 17 h. fThe reaction time was 9 h. gThe reaction time was 13 h. hThe reaction time was 14 h. 
In order to gain insights into the reaction mechanism, control experiments were performed. When the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) was added to the reaction system under the optimized conditions, it was found that the formation of 2a was completely suppressed, and adduct TEMPO-A was isolated in 50% yield. Removing C60 from the reaction system, benzil and benzoic acid were isolated in yields of 19% and 34%, respectively. These results implied that a radical process was likely involved in the present reaction.
On the basis of the above experimental results and previous literature, a plausible reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 3. Initially, α-oxocarboxylic acid reacts with CuCl2·2H2O to form acyl radical Avia a decarboxylation process.10,11a,12c The fullerenyl radical B is produced after capture of acyl radical A by C60. Then, the fullerenyl radical B acquires an electron from the in situ formed Cu(I) species to generate the fullerenyl anion C,16 which attacks another molecule of α-oxocarboxylic acid to afford the anionic species D. The anionic D undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic addition to produce anion E. Finally, elimination of one molecule of H2O from E with the assistance of a proton source provides the epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactone 2. The alternative pathway via organocopper intermediates might be also feasible.
 Scheme 3  Proposed reaction mechanism for the synthesis of 2. 
The transition-metal-catalyzed/promoted decarboxylative coupling reactions of α-oxocarboxylic acids have been well developed. α-Oxocarboxylic acids were used previously as mono-acylation reagents in most cases,7–13 as bis-acylation sources in only limited examples,17 and as starting materials to produce 1,2-diketones via a decarboxylative homocoupling reaction.18 There has been no precedent for the cascade addition pathway observed in the present work, which proceeds through addition of the acyl radical generated decarboxylatively in situ from an α-oxocarboxylic acid to a radical trapper, followed by addition to another α-oxocarboxylic acid and subsequent intramolecular lactonization.
The representative epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactone 2a was chosen for further functionalizations. Lactone 2a could be easily reduced to hemiacetal 3a in 86% yield by diisobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL-H, 3 equiv.) under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 15 min (Scheme 4a).5a,19 In addition, after treatment of 2a with DIBAL-H at 0 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction mixture was allowed to directly react with triethylsilane (Et3SiH, 4.5 equiv.) and ethylaluminum dichloride (EtAlCl2, 4.5 equiv.) for 4 h, and was finally quenched with trimethylamine.20 After separation on a silica gel column, a mixture of the unexpected isomeric 1,2,3,4-adducts 4a (62%) and 4a′ (16%) was obtained (Scheme 4b). To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on the bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts.21 Herein, we provide an alternative approach to the scarce bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of 3a, 4a and 4a′ from 2a. 
A plausible reaction mechanism for the formation of 4a and 4a′ is proposed in Scheme 5. Lactone 2a can be easily reduced to hemiacetal 3a by DIBAL-H.5a,19 Hemiacetal 3a can undergo a reductive cleavage of the hemiacetal moiety with EtAlCl2–Et3SiH to form the anion F.20 The anion F further undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization, followed by protonation (paths a and b) to produce isomers 4a and 4a′, respectively.
 Scheme 5  Proposed reaction mechanism for the synthesis of 4a and 4a′. 
The structures of 2a–n, 3a, 4a and 4a′ were characterized by HRMS, 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, FT-IR and UV-vis spectra, and 2b and 4a′ were further identified by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The mass spectrum of 2a–n, 3a, 4a and 4a′ exhibited the correct [M]− peaks. Their 1H NMR spectra displayed the expected chemical shifts as well as the splitting patterns for all protons. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 2a–n and 3a exhibited at least 50 peaks in the range of 136–152 ppm for the sp2-carbons of the fullerene cage and two peaks in the 75–84 ppm range for the two sp3-carbons of the fullerene skeleton, consistent with the C1 symmetry of their molecular structures. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 2a–n and 3a also exhibited two peaks at 91–97 ppm and 111–114 ppm for the two quaternary carbons bridged by the oxygen atom. The 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 4a and 4a′ were quite different from that of 2a–n and 3a and showed four sp3-carbons of the fullerene cage. The UV-vis spectra of 2a–n and 3a displayed characteristic peaks at around 315 nm and 430 nm, which are diagnostic absorptions for 1,2-adducts of C60 with two carbon atoms attached to the C60 cage.5b,6b,f As for 4a and 4a′, their UV-vis spectra were different from those of 2a–n and 3a, with the characteristic bands at around 335 nm and 430 nm, agreeing that 4a and 4a′ are 1,2,3,4-adducts.6e,21,22
The electrochemical properties of 2a–n, 3a, 4a and 4a′ along with that of C60 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and their half-wave reduction potentials are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). All of their electrochemical properties were quite similar and showed three reversible redox processes.
Although C60 showed no effective passivation as an overcoating layer to modify the SnO2 electron-transporting layer (ETL) in an n-type perovskite solar cell (PSC), fullerene derivatives could improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE).23 As a proof of concept, our synthesized representative 4a was successfully applied in PSC with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/4a/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (Fig. 1a). The best PCE of 18.49% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.28 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73 were achieved for the SnO2/4a-based PSC, while the control device with a pristine SnO2 ETL showed a lower PCE of 17.44% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.56 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.07 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75. This result revealed that fullerene derivative 4a was a promising modification material on the ETL for the n–i–p-type PSCs.

In summary, we disclose a novel copper-promoted decarboxylative annulation of C60 with two identical α-oxocarboxylic acids to afford the unique epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones via an unprecedented cascade addition pathway. The current protocol provides facile access to epoxy-bridged C60-fused lactones, which can be further functionalized to the rare epoxy-bridged C60-fused hemiacetal and bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts. The structure of C60-fused lactones and the derived bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts are unequivocally established by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Plausible reaction mechanisms leading to the formation of C60-fused lactones and bicyclic-fused 1,2,3,4-adducts are proposed. The application of a representative fullerene product in a perovskite solar cell device has also been investigated.
