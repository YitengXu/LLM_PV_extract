    , Accepted 24th June 2022First published on 24th June 2022AbstractA ternary strategy by introducing a third component into a binary host system has been proven to be a simple and promising method to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a high efficient ternary OSC is fabricated, wherein, a non-fullerene acceptor, namely MOIT-M, is introduced as a third component into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend. MOIT-M possesses good complementary absorption spectra and aligned cascade energy levels with the host binary blend, which benefits light harvesting, exciton dissociation, and charge transport. Moreover, MOIT-M exhibits good miscibility with BTP-eC9, forming a well-mixed phase, which improves molecular packing for better charge transport and optimizes ternary blend morphology. Notably, the incorporation of MOIT-M suppresses non-radiative recombination, leading to reduced non-radiative energy losses (ΔEnr). As a result, the ternary OSC exhibits a significantly increased PCE of 18.5% with a lower ΔEnr of 0.21 eV in comparison with the control binary PM6:BTP-eC9 device with a PCE of 17.4% and a ΔEnr of 0.24 eV. In addition, the ternary OSC displays better storage stability compared to the PM6:BTP-eC9 system. This work indicates that a ternary strategy via combining two compatible small molecule acceptors is effective to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have aroused much attention as a promising renewable energy technology, due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, solution processability, flexibility, transparency, high power-to-weight ratio, etc.1–6 Benefiting from the synergistic effects of material design, morphology optimization, and device engineering, the remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction and tandem OSCs have been promoted to over 18% and 20%.7–14 Such great progress mainly contributes to the rapid development of fused-ring electron acceptors,15–20 in particular the advent of Y-series non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which possess desirable optoelectronic properties, such as tunable energy levels, low exciton binding energy, good charge transport, and a long exciton diffusion length.21–24
By introducing a third component into ternary organic solar cells, they have exhibited great potential to further boost device performance, integrating the advantages of sunlight harvesting in tandem solar cells and the simplicity of single-junction architecture.25,26 The tremendous NFAs and various donor materials offer many possibilities to construct ternary devices.27–32 To date, most of the highly efficient organic OSCs are based on an extra acceptor as the third component.33–36 Zhang et al. reported the lower non-radiative voltage of ternary OSCs by incorporating an asymmetric medium bandgap (1.75 eV) acceptor AITC on the basics of 3,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) derivatives16 as the third component in the PM6:BTP-eC9 system, contributing to the improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs.37 Zhu et al. designed a Y6 analogue, AQx-3, and introduced it into the PM6:Y6 binary system, and over 18% PCE improvement was realized in the optimized ternary OSCs relatively benefiting from the alloy-like composites formed by two acceptors with superior film morphology.38 Hence, the rational choice of the guest acceptor plays a key role in promoting the ternary device performance. Generally, complementary absorption spectra to the host blend are needed to ensure sufficient sunlight harvesting for high short-circuit current density (Jsc).39–41 Moreover, matched energy levels are desirable to form the cascade alignment with the binary system for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary blend.42–44 Furthermore, good miscibility with the host acceptor to form a well-mixed phase can help suppress charge recombination and reduce the non-radiative energy loss (ΔEnr).45–48 Considering the above-mentioned issues, ternary OSCs with suitable guest acceptors should achieve an excellent device performance with a PCE over 18%.
In this contribution, we introduced a non-fullerene small molecule acceptor MOIT-M, which has been reported by our group,49 into the host binary PM6:BTP-eC9 ref. 19, 50 to construct high-performance ternary OSCs. MOIT-M possesses complementary absorption to the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend and an upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level relative to that of BTP-eC9, which helps increase the overall Jsc and Voc of ternary OSCs contemporarily. In addition, MOIT-M shows good miscibility with BTP-eC9, which prefers to form a well-mixed dual-acceptor phase in ternary blends. The formation of the homogenous mixed-phase leads to improved molecular packing and favorable active layer morphology, which enables more balanced carrier mobility and suppressed recombination. Meanwhile, a higher electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) along with a lower ΔEnr is achieved in the ternary device, affording a higher Voc. As a result, the optimized ternary OSCs obtained a significantly enhanced PCE of 18.5% with a simultaneously improved Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 27.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 77.3%, while the PM6:BTP-eC9 counterpart showed a PCE of 17.4% with a Voc of 0.84 V, Jsc of 27.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.1%. The ternary devices exhibited a low ΔEnr of 0.21 eV, which is 30 meV smaller than that of the PM6:BTP-eC9 binary devices. Moreover, the ternary OSCs also presented enhanced storage stability compared to the control binary PM6:BTP-eC9 device. Our results demonstrate that the ternary strategy with two well-compatible NFAs offers an effective way to develop stable high-performance OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical and electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance
The chemical structures of PM6, BTP-eC9, and MOIT-M are shown in Fig. 1a. As shown in Fig. 1b, it can be seen that MOIT-M exhibits good complementary absorption to PM6 and BTP-eC9. The absorption coefficient of blend films is presented in Fig. 1c, and the incorporation of MOIT-M enhances the absorption coefficient of the ternary film in the range of 300–750 nm with a slight blue-shifted absorption edge, which is helpful in increasing light harvesting. The molecular energy levels of PM6, BTP-eC9, and MOIT-M were measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 1d, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of PM6, MOIT-M and BTP-eC9 are −5.50/−3.59, −5.56/−3.88, and −5.65/−3.98 eV, respectively. The higher LUMO of MOIT-M is expected to deliver a higher Voc in the device.

To study the influence of the third compound on ternary device photovoltaic properties, a conventional architecture of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag was fabricated. The device fabrication details are provided in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 1e and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The PM6:BTP-eC9 control device shows a PCE of 17.4%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 27.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.1%. The PM6:MOIT-M binary device showed a relatively lower PCE of 10.3% with a lower Jsc (15.8 mA cm−2) and FF (64.6%), but a much higher Voc of 1.01 V. Different amounts of MOIT-M were added into the PM6:BTP-eC9 host system, and the corresponding J–V curves and the detailed parameters are shown in Fig. S2a and Table S1.† With the increase of the MOIT-M content, the Voc of the corresponding device clearly increases. Optimal efficiency is reached with a PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M ratio of 1:1.2:0.3 (w/w), and the corresponding device exhibits a champion PCE of 18.5% with a simultaneously increased Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 27.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 77.3%. The PCE value is one of the highest efficiencies reported for single-junction OSCs (Table S4†). Fig. 1g shows the efficiency distribution histogram for 20 independently measured binary and ternary devices, which indicates that all the OSCs have reproducible PCE values with small deviations. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best binary and ternary cells are shown in Fig. 1f, and the EQE response is enhanced in the region of 650–840 nm by the introduction of MOIT-M, leading to a higher Jsc. The integrated current densities from the EQE spectra match well with the values obtained from the J–V measurements, which confirms the good reliability of the J–V measurements. The storage stability with un-encapsulation devices in the N2-filled glove box under dark conditions was measured. As shown in Fig. S3,† the ternary device demonstrates better storage stability than the binary counterpart. The PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M device can retain 80% of its initial PCE value after being stored for 864 h, while the residual PCE of the PM6:BTP-eC9 device is reduced to 70%. Subsequently, the PCE reached an almost steady state, after being stored for 1500 h, and the PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M and PM6:BTP-eC9 devices maintain 78% and 67% of their initial PCE, respectively. Table S5† provides a comparison of the performance and stability of recently reported ternary OSCs, and it can be seen that the storage stability of the PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M ternary device is comparable to other reported high-performance devices.

2.2. Working mechanism
To further study the working mechanism of the ternary OSCs, we performed photoluminescence (PL) tests of both neat MOIT-M and BTP-eC9 films, and BTP-eC9:MOIT-M blend films. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the PL of MOIT-M overlaps with the absorption of BTP-eC9, favoring the energy transfer between them. As the MOIT-M content increases in the blend, the PL intensity of MOIT-M is completely diminished, whereas the PL intensity of BTP-eC9 is gradually enhanced, indicating that there exists efficient energy transfer from MOIT-M to BTP-eC9 (Fig. 2b).51 The energy transfer between two acceptors should provide a new route for exciton utilization of ternary OSCs. To figure out whether charge transfer exists between MOIT-M and BTP-eC9, we measured the J–V curves of the OSCs based on MOIT-M, BTP-eC9, and BTP-eC9:MOIT-M. As shown in Fig. S4b,† the Jsc of the BTP-eC9:MOIT-M based device is smaller than that of the BTP-eC9 based device, indicating the negligible possibility of charge transfer between BTP-eC9 and MOIT-M.52

Fig. S5† displays the evolution of the Vocs of ternary devices by varying the MOIT-M content. The Vocs show a linear increase along with the increase of the third component, which usually appears in an alloy-like mechanism.53 To verify whether MOIT-M and BTP-eC9 form a well-mixed composite, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was tested and is presented in Fig. 2c. The melting points of BTP-eC9, BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and MOIT-M are 298.5, 294.9, and 284.3 °C in the heating process, respectively. The change in the melting transition of the BTP-eC9:MOIT-M blend also demonstrates the formation of a well-mixed phase in the blend. To evaluate the miscibility between BTP-eC9 and MOIT-M, the contact angles of water and diiodomethane (DIM) on neat PM6, BTP-eC9, and MOIT-M films were measured (Fig. 2a). The surface tension (γ) values are calculated following Wu's model (Table S6†).54 The γ values of PM6, BTP-eC9, and MOIT-M are 34.25, 38.04, and 41.11 mN m−1, respectively. The miscibility of two materials can be reflected by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ), which is obtained via using the equation of ,55 where κ is a positive constant. The calculated χ values of PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:MOIT-M are 0.10κ and 0.31κ, respectively, while the χ between BTP-eC9 and MOIT-M is only 0.06κ, showing that BTP-eC9 and MOIT-M have a possibility to form a well-mixed acceptor. The thermodynamic location of MOIT-M is further estimated by using the wetting coefficient (ω) from the interfacial surface energy based on Young's equation and Neumann's equation.56 If ωc < −1, MOIT-M will locate in BTP-eC9 domain. If −1 < ωc < −1, MOIT-M will locate at the interface between PM6 and BTP-eC9. If ωc > 1, MOIT-M will locate in PM6 domain. The ωc value of MOIT-M in the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend is calculated to be −2.59, which belongs to ωc < −1. This result indicates that MOIT-M is located in the acceptor domains, which further confirms the formation of a well-mixed phase.
2.3. Charge generation, transport, recombination, and extraction
To clarify the influence of MOIT-M on the charge transport properties, space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to calculate the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in the binary and ternary blends. As shown in Fig. 3a, the calculated μh/μe of PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:MOIT-M devices are 4.76 × 10−4/4.18 × 10−4 and 5.53 × 10−4/3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with μh/μe ratios of 1.14 and 1.84, respectively, while for the ternary device, the hole and electron mobilities increase to 5.69 × 10−4 and 6.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 0.93. The higher and more balanced μh and μe contribute to the improvement of Jsc and FF.

The (c) Jsc and (d) Vocversus light intensity curves of the optimal binary and ternary devices. (e) TPC and (f) TPV measurements of the optimal binary and ternary devices. 
To investigate the exciton generation and splitting process, the photocurrent density (Jph) dependence on the effective voltage (Veff) of the typical OSCs was investigated, as shown in Fig. 3b. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities measured under illumination and the dark condition, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage.57 The values of exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) are 97.7%/84.4%, 91.4%/72.7%, and 98.4%/88.5% for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:MOIT-M binary and PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M ternary devices. The higher Pdiss and Pcoll values for the ternary OSC suggest more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in the device, leading to higher Jsc.
PL quenching experiments were employed to investigate the photogenerated charge separation at the D/A interface. As shown in Fig. S7,† when PM6 is excited at 570 nm, the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M blend films exhibit 94.9%, 96.6%, and 87.1% quenching efficiencies. The highest PL quenching efficiency in the ternary blend indicates that MOIT-M could facilitate the electron transfer from PM6 to BTP-eC9. When MOIT-M and BTP-eC9 films were excited at 690 and 820 nm, respectively, the corresponding ternary blend films (PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M = 1:1.2:0.3) both showed the highest PL quenching efficiency of 96.1% and 98.4%. The PL experiments indicate effective photo-induced charge generation and transfer behavior at D/A interfaces in the optimized ternary film, which is mainly responsible for its higher device performance.
To investigate the effect of MOIT-M on charge combination dynamics, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (Plight) was analyzed. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed by using Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is an exponential factor that reflects the extent of biomolecular charge recombination.58 As shown in Fig. 3c, the extracted α values for PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:MOIT-M and the PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M devices are 0.998, 0.992, and 0.999, respectively. The α value of the ternary device is much closer to 1, demonstrating that the bimolecular recombination is relatively reduced. The relationship between Voc and Plight can be described as Voc ∝ n(kT/q)ln(Plight) (k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge).59 A slope close to 1 kT/q means dominant bimolecular combination, whereas trap-assisted recombination dominates when the slope is close to 2 kT/q. As shown in Fig. 3d, the determined slopes are 1.12 kT/q, 1.09 kT/q, and 1.40 kT/q for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M devices, respectively. This result shows that the addition of MOIT-M to the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend can suppress trap-assisted recombination.
To gain more insight into the charge extraction/recombination dynamics of devices, the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were adopted.60 The charge extraction time can be obtained by fitting the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay curves. As shown in Fig. 3e, the charge extraction time is 0.16 μs for the PM6:BTP-eC9 device, 0.20 μs for the PM6:MOIT-M device, and 0.15 μs for the PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M device. The shorter charge extraction time in the ternary device can be attributed to the higher charge carrier mobility. Meanwhile, the carrier lifetime was extracted by fitting the TPV curve. As shown in Fig. 3f, the ternary device displays a τ value of 3.27 μs, larger than that of the PM6:BTP-eC9 (2.46 μs) and PM6:MOIT-M (2.01 μs) devices. The relatively long lifetime of free carriers indicates less recombination, which is responsible for the highest FF and Jsc in ternary devices.
2.4. Blend morphology characterization
To explore the influence of MOIT-M on blend film morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4a, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M blend films are 1.51, 1.58 and 2.00 nm, respectively. A clear fibrillar structure can be seen in the AFM phase images, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport. After adding MOIT-M into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, a well-distributed interpenetrating nanostructure is observed. TEM was used to study the phase separation morphologies in the blend films. As shown in Fig. 4b, the addition of MOIT-M to the PM6:BTP-eC9 system forms an appropriate nano-sized phase separation network morphology, which is conducive to efficient charge separation and charge carrier transport.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the molecular packing of the blend films. Previous reports have proved that the PM6 film exhibits a mixed face-on/edge-on orientation, while both acceptor films exhibit a preferential face-on orientation. Fig. 4c shows the 2D GIWAXS pattern of the binary and ternary blends, and the corresponding line-cut intensities taken along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) direction are shown in Fig. 4d. Both the binary and the ternary blend films adopted a preferred face-on orientation, evidenced by the strong (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction. The dominant π–π diffraction peaks of PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M blend films are located at 17.27, 17.39, and 17.35 nm−1 in the OOP direction, respectively, and their crystal coherence lengths (CCL) are calculated to be 2.52, 2.63, and 2.73 nm according to the Scherrer equation.61 This vividly indicated the improved π–π stacking of the PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M blend film, which is favorable for charge transport. Moreover, in the IP direction, the (100) diffraction peaks of PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M films are located at 3.36 and 3.38 nm−1, while the CCL of the ternary film is 13.15 nm, higher than that of the PM6:BTP-eC9 film (11.78 nm). These results indicate that the addition of MOIT-M also has a positive impact on lamellar stacking. The CCLs associated with the π–π and lamellar stacking peaks in the binary and ternary blends are summarized in Table S7.† Generally, the increased CCL corresponds to higher crystallinity in the blend film. Hence, the enhanced CCL is beneficial in promoting photogenerated charge dissociation and transport, which is consistent with the increased Jsc and FF of the ternary devices.
2.5. Energy loss
To explicitly explain the origin of the higher Voc delivered by the ternary blend, energy loss (Eloss) in both binary and ternary devices was analyzed. The photovoltaic band gaps (EPVg) of all the blend films can be estimated according to the derivative of the corresponding EQE spectra (dEQE/dE).62 As presented in Fig. S8,† the EPVg of PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:MOIT-M, and PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M blends are calculated to be 1.38, 1.65, and 1.39 eV, respectively. The total Eloss is calculated following the equation Eloss = EPVg − qVoc. As summarized in Table 2, the Eloss of PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M devices is 0.54, 0.52, and 0.64 eV, respectively. The Eloss in OSC cells can be divided into three parts based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit (Eloss = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3).63,64 The first part (ΔE1 = Eg − qVSQoc) represents unavoidable radiative recombination loss above the bandgap, which is defined as the difference between EPVg and maximum voltage VSQoc based on the SQ limit. Here, PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M devices show the same ΔE1 value of 0.26 eV, while PM6:MOIT-M present a higher ΔE1 value of 0.28 eV. The second part (ΔE2 = qVSQoc – qVradoc) is the additional radiative recombination loss below the bandgap. In the current OSCs, ΔE2 is very small and can usually be ignored. Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) was measured to evaluate ΔE2, as shown in Fig. 5a. ΔE2 values are calculated to be 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 eV for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M devices. The third part (ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL)) represents non-radiative recombination loss, which is linearly related to the natural logarithm of EQEEL. As shown in Fig. 5b, the ternary device has a higher EQEEL value (2.99 × 10−4) than binary devices based on PM6:BTP-eC9 (8.20 × 10−5) and PM6:MOIT-M (8.59 × 10−6). The corresponding ΔE3 values are 0.24, 0.21, and 0.30 eV for PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M, and PM6:MOIT-M devices, respectively. This result suggests that the non-radiative recombination loss in PM6:BTP-eC9 devices can be effectively suppressed by introducing MOIT-M as the third component, and contributes to the improvement of the Voc value.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated high-performance ternary OSCs with PM6 as a donor and two small molecules BTP-eC9 and MOIT-M as acceptors. The optimized ternary OSC (PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M = 1:1.2:0.3) achieved a significantly improved PCE of 18.5%, benefiting from a simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.87 V, FF of 77.3%, and Jsc of 27.4 mA cm−2, while the PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:MOIT-M binary counterparts obtained a PCE of 17.4% and 10.3%, respectively. The guest MOIT-M has a complementary absorption to the binary blend and good compatibility with the host BTP-eC9 acceptor that helps to realize a modified morphology. The exciton dissociation and charge transport properties were significantly improved, and charge recombination can be sufficiently suppressed, which contributed to the increased Jsc and FF in ternary devices. Moreover, the total energy loss and the non-radiative recombination loss of the ternary OSC were reduced to 0.52 and 0.21 eV, respectively, lower than those of both the binary devices, leading to a higher Voc value. In addition, the ternary device also exhibits enhanced storage stability compared to the binary device. These results manifest the great potential of this ternary system in the fabrication of stable high-performance OSCs, which offers the opportunity to make OSCs more competitive in future solar cell technology.
