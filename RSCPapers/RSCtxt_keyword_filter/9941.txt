    , Accepted 10th October 2022First published on 12th October 2022AbstractOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) are regarded as promising energy sources for powering internet of things devices under indoor conditions. Indoor OPVs (IOPVs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25–30%, due in part to the discovery of wide band gap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) (>1.7 eV). However, this requires the use of halogenated solvents that are harmful to human health and the environment. Therefore, halogen free solvent processing with the deliberate designing wide band gap NFAs is required to demonstrate the feasibility and environmental compatibility of NFA-based IOPVs. Herein, we designed two NFAs, ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me, composed of an ITIC core and four 5-thioalkylated-2-thienyl groups as out-of-side chains with methyl groups attached to the conjugated end units. The substitution of electron-donating methyl in the end group is expected to increase an open-circuit voltage, which is beneficial to IOPV applications. They were then blended with a polymer donor (PM6) to obtain a photoactive layer with an absorption spectrum similar to that of indoor light sources. Xylene:1,8-octanedithiol (XO) and chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodooctane (CD) were used as non-halogenated and halogenated solvents, respectively. XO-based devices exhibited competitive PCEs relative to CDs; PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me yielded PCEs of ∼19% and ∼22%, respectively, under common white light emitting diode illumination. Specifically, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me processed from XO solvents achieved a PCE of 22.38% at 550 lux, which is the best-performing binary material system based IOPVs processed from a non-halogen solvent mixture. The presented approach highlights several useful design strategies for the development of indoor NFAs for efficient non-halogenated IOPV applications.
Introduction
In recent years, the demand for personal electronic devices for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart wearables and health monitoring, has grown rapidly. IoT devices are used in indoor environments for low energy consumption applications.1 Self-sustaining energy sources to power off-grid indoor electronics are therefore also highly in demand. Photovoltaics (PVs) are ideal candidates because they can efficiently convert indoor light into low-level electrical power.2–4
Among the available PV technologies, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have several advantages, including low-cost and environmentally friendly manufacturing. In addition, they are lightweight and flexible, and have easily tunable light absorption properties.5–11 Indoor OPVs (IOPVs) should be designed to achieve high performance under indoor illumination by considering the following characteristics: typical indoor light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent lamps have a spectral range of 400–750 nm.12–14 Therefore, the device should exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE), and their absorption spectra should match the light emission spectra of indoor sources, i.e., wide band gap materials are required to efficiently convert incident photons into electrons. The irradiance intensities of indoor light sources (200–1000 lux) are two to three orders of magnitude lower compared to those based on solar illumination.13,15,16 This can lead to low carrier densities in these devices. It is beneficial if the leakage currents are low, and trap-assisted recombination can be effectively suppressed because they are critical in the case of low light intensities.2,17–19 Furthermore, when the devices are exposed to indoor light conditions, additional voltage losses of ∼0.16 V occur.14 Therefore, the energy loss should be minimized to achieve the maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC).
Current IOPVs have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25–30%2–4,18,20 by employing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which can be easily modified to obtain wide bandgap materials (>1.7 eV). For instance, Hou et al. synthesized an NFA called IO-4Cl with an optical bandgap of 1.80 eV. The device based on PBDB-TF:IO-4Cl exhibited a low energy loss below 0.60 eV, and a 1 cm2 cell yielded a PCE of 26.1% with a high VOC of 1.1 V under an LED illumination of 1000 lux.3 Yan et al. developed an NFA called FCC-Cl that is composed of a weak electron-donating core to produce a large bandgap of 1.71 eV. When blended with D18, the OPVs exhibited a high EQE of up to 85% and a fill factor (FF) of 80%, owing to the high absorption coefficient and crystallinity of FCC-Cl. A PCE of 28.8% was obtained using a 2600 K LED lamp at 500 lux.2 The same group recently reported on NFAs of FCC-Cl-4Ph and FCC-Cl-6Ph by introducing different numbers of bulky alkylphenyl side chains onto the FCC-Cl backbone. D18:FCC-Cl-4Ph achieved a PCE of 30% under a 3000 K LED lamp at 1000 lux. It was revealed that FCC-Cl-4Ph had partial alkyl and alkylphenyl substitutions, which induced blue-shift absorption.4
However, these high efficiencies were obtained using halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform. The use of these solvents is harmful to human health and the environment, and increases device manufacturing costs. IOPVs can potentially be manufactured in an environmentally safer manner using non-halogenated solvents. It is known that the OPVs processed from these solvents under outdoor conditions exhibit inferior performance compared to those processed from halogenated solvents.8 One reason is that donor (D) or acceptor (A) materials typically have poor solubility in non-halogenated solvents, which induces a poor morphology with large phase separation.8,21–26 Nowadays, OPVs processed from halogen free solvents often perform equally good or superior compared to those processed from halogenated solvents. It was revealed that some D:A blends form well-mixed features in the bulk morphologies or their devices exhibited efficient charge transport and small recombination losses when processed from non-halogenated solvents.27–34 Therefore, halogen free solvent processing with deliberately designed wide band gap NFAs is required to demonstrate the feasibility and environmental compatibility of NFA-based IOPVs.
Along with the side chain and end group modification strategies to fine tune the optical and electrical properties of NFAs,35,36 it has been reported that when 2-thienyl groups serve as out-of-plane side chains on ITIC, down-shifting of the molecular energy levels occurs. This is due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the groups for matching with the donor polymer.37 The thienyl side chains increased the intermolecular interactions, resulting in good charge transport.37 In addition, when the carbon alkyl side chain is substituted with sulfur alkyl, the crystallinity is enhanced, resulting in improved overall light-absorption ability, current flow, and PCE.38–41 Moreover, thioalkyl side chains are expected to increase the charge transport because sulfur atoms are more easily polarized than carbon atoms, which can increase the intermolecular interactions.
Herein, we designed two electron acceptors, ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me, composed of an ITIC core and four 5-thioalkylated-2-thienyl groups outside the side chains. Methyl groups were attached to the conjugated end units. The substitution of an electron-donating methyl group in the end group is expected to tune the electronic energy level and increase the VOC because of the shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (ELUMO) in OPVs; thus, a higher ELUMO level of ITIC-Th-s-me than that of ITIC-Th-s was obtained. When combined with a reported donor (PM6), OPVs with absorption spectra ranging from 300 to 800 nm that were preferentially responsive to indoor light sources were fabricated. Xylene and 1,8-octanedithiol (XO) and chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (CD) were used as non-halogenated and halogenated solvents, respectively, to study the photovoltaic properties of each system. XO-based devices showed competitive performance relative to CD; PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me yielded PCEs of ∼10 and ∼11% under outdoor conditions and ∼19 and ∼22% under common white LED illumination, respectively. In particular, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me processed using XO solvents achieved a PCE of 22.38% with a JSC of 63.36 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.857 V, and a FF of 0.721 at 550 lux. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best-performing binary material system based IOPVs processed from non-halogen solvent mixtures. Our results suggest that ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me may facilitate the development of highly efficient acceptor materials that are suitable for application into non-halogenated IOPVs as semi-permanent green power sources.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and characterization of NFAs
The detailed synthesis procedures for the two NFAs and the chemical schemes of each step are described in the ESI.† The alkylthiothiophenyl group can be easily introduced via nucleophilic substitution and addition subsequent to the acid-catalyzed Friedel–Crafts reaction. The end groups were attached via Knoevenagel condensation after formylation. The chemical structures of the intermediate and final compounds were confirmed using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†), which revealed that both NFAs were synthesized as desired. The characterization of the thermal properties was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The onset decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me were estimated as 323 and 331 °C, respectively, indicating good thermal stability (Fig. S13(a), ESI†). The thermal transitions characterized based on DSC measurements revealed that transitions were not observed (Fig. S13(b) and (c), ESI†).
The UV-vis spectral features of the acceptors were investigated in chlorobenzene (CB) and xylene (Xyl) thin films (Fig. 1(c)). ITIC-Th-s in CB and Xyl solutions showed strong absorption maxima at 647 and 636 nm with shoulders at 610 and 592 nm, respectively. ITIC-Th-s in solution exhibited slightly blue-shifted peaks compared to ITIC-Th-s-me with absorption maxima at 640 and 382 nm with shoulders at 605 and 687 nm, respectively. Although the absorption maximum of the solid-state NFAs showed a significant redshift of >40 nm due to molecular self-organization37,42–45 relative to their solution states, sufficient absorption in the 500–800 nm region was still demonstrated. Furthermore, these spectral features were observed to be well-matched to the LED emission spectrum (Fig. 1(d)) and could be advantageous in terms of the efficient collection of photons under indoor illumination when combined with suitable donors. ITIC-Th-s-me exhibited almost identical maximum absorption peaks compared to the ITIC-Th-s solid states; also, they retained similar absorption features in both CB and Xyl films. Consequently, the optical band gaps (EOPTgs) that were calculated based on the absorption edge were in the order ITIC-Th-s-me (1.65 eV) ≈ ITIC-Th-s (1.64 eV) > ITIC-Th (1.60 eV) (Table 1).

The electrochemical properties of the NFAs were also investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S14, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and ELUMO were determined based on the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the CV.37 The EHOMO and ELUMO values of ITIC-Th-s were −5.59 and −3.83 eV, whereas those of ITIC-Th-s-me were −5.58 and −3.81 eV, respectively. Both ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me exhibited upshifted energy levels compared to those of ITIC-Th (EHOMO = −5.66 eV; ELUMO = −3.93 eV) because of the inductive effect of the thienyl side chains.46 The higher ELUMO level of ITIC-Th-s-me compared to ITIC-Th-s indicates that alkyl chain engineering can further finely modulate the molecular properties of NFAs. It is expected that these high ELUMO levels will allow high open-circuit voltage (VOC) values to be obtained, and thus maintain low energy losses in devices.47–49 The electrochemical band gaps (ECVgs) exhibited the order ITIC-Th-s-me (1.77 eV) > ITIC-Th-s (1.76 eV) > ITIC-Th (1.73 eV) (Table 1). The higher ECVgs of ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me compared to EOPTgs are consistent with the reported results for the ITIC-Th acceptors.37,50,51
Photovoltaic performances under AM 1.5G illumination
In this study, PM6 was selected as a donor polymer due to its strong absorption in the visible region and complementary absorption with both ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me (Fig. 1(c)). PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me were then fabricated based on OPVs with a configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO nanoparticles/Al. To determine the optimal conditions, various device engineering techniques including D:A ratios, solvent additives, and thermal annealing processing were explored (Fig. S15–S18, and Tables S1–S4, ESI†). The details of the device preparation process are described in the Experimental Section. In particular, diphenyl ether (DPE), 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN), and 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) were selected as non-halogenated solvent additives for introduction into the Xyl-based bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system. We first investigated the photovoltaic performance under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) as a reference. The best-performing devices were obtained for a D:A weight ratio of 1:1 in the CB:1,8-diiodooctane and Xyl:ODT solvent systems (referred to as CD and XO, respectively). The photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 2(a)) are listed in Table 2. The PM6:ITIC-Th-s device yielded the best PCEs of 10.41% (a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.71 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.976 V, and a FF of 0.679) and 10.74% (a JSC of 16.53 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.980 V, and a FF of 0.663) for the CD and XO systems, respectively. It was found that the replacement of ITIC-Th-s with ITIC-Th-s-me contributed to higher VOCs and FFs, with maximum PCE values of 11.55% (a JSC of 16.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.983 V, and a FF of 0.701) and 11.18% (a JSC of 16.22 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.010 V, and a FF of 0.683), respectively. The alleviated VOCs were due to the upshifted ELUMO level of ITIC-Th-me as demonstrated above. Comparing the efficiencies within the same material systems, XO is competitive with the CD systems for both PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me, which is good enough to demonstrate IOPV performances even in non-halogenated solvent-based devices.

Fig. 2(b) shows the EQE spectrum with the integrated JSCs of the best OPV cells. The calculated JSCs values are 15.35, 15.75, 16.14, and 15.53 mA cm−2, which are in good agreement with those obtained from the J–V characteristics. All the devices showed a significant photon contribution between 450 nm and 700 nm, with the highest EQE value of >75%. The PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me blend films were also confirmed to efficiently absorb light in this range, with maximum peaks at approximately 625 nm (Fig. S19, ESI†). These broad and high spectral responses in both the EQE and solid-state blend films in the regions where the indoor light spectrum dominates, supports our predictions, as discussed in the previous section.
Single-carrier diodes were fabricated to measure the electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh) in the vertical direction using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique.52 The details of the device preparation and characterization are introduced in the Experimental Section. The dark J–V characteristics of the single-carrier diodes are shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†), and the extracted μe and μh values are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). The μe and μh values of PM6:ITIC-Th-s devices (∼4.0 × 10−4 and 1.5–1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) were relatively higher than those of PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me devices (∼3.3 × 10−4 and ∼1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) in both the CD and XO systems. In addition, the μe/μh ratios of PM6:ITIC-Th-s devices (2.53 and 2.66, respectively) were observed to be slightly mismatched compared to those of PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me (2.19 and 2.37, respectively), which may lead to a reduced FF in PM6:ITIC-Th-s-based devices. We also investigated the trap densities (nts) in the devices by fitting a trap-filled limit (TFL) regime, wherein injected charges are captured by traps in semiconductors.53–55 The nt values were estimated as 4.31, 1.18, 4.08, and 1.12 × 1016 cm−3 for PM6:ITIC-Th-s CD, XO, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me CD, and XO devices, respectively (Table S5, ESI†). Although the values of PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me devices for each CD and XO system were almost identical, that of CD was four times higher than that of the XO system. From the previous J–V measurements, the VOC values of XO were determined to be higher than those of the CD system (0.980 V vs. 0.976 V for PM6:ITIC-Th-s devices and 1.010 V and 0.983 V for PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me devices). This is because traps can alter the energy-level alignment at organic–organic heterojunctions,56–58 which could contribute to the decrease in the VOC values by increasing the hole Fermi level of the EHOMO of the donor.59,60
The light intensity (I)-dependent JSC and VOC characteristics were measured to elucidate the recombination mechanism in the devices. It is well-known that JSC is directly proportional to Iα; therefore, the exponent α can be derived by fitting experimental data to that relationship. All carriers were swept out prior to bimolecular recombination and/or small difference between the electron and hole mobilities when α was close to unity.4,61–66 The slopes were 0.979, 0.975, 0.977, and 0.982 for PM6:ITIC-Th-s CD, XO, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me CD and XO based OPVs, respectively (Fig. 2(c)). Indeed, the μe and μh values exhibited same order of ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for all systems. The similar α values also indicate that the extent of bimolecular recombination in the devices is not governed by the alkylation of the molecules. In addition, VOC is directly proportional to SkT/qln(I), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature (in Kelvin), and the elementary charge, respectively. An S value close to unity indicates that trap-assisted recombination contributes less to the total recombination in diodes, i.e., bimolecular recombination becomes dominant.4,61–63 Otherwise, the recombination is governed by the traps in the bulk (S = 2kT/q) and at the surface (S < kT/q).67,68 Interestingly, the values of PM6:ITIC-Th based OPVs (1.347 and 1.112) were higher than those of PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me based OPVs (1.123 and 1.010) in both the CD and XO systems (Fig. 2(d)). Trap-assisted recombination in the bulk becomes more intense, which adversely affected the FF values in the ITIC-Th-s-based devices. Thus, trap-assisted recombination mainly controls the extent of recombination in our material systems which is a key factor in indoor illumination.2,3,19,20
Morphological characterization
To investigate the morphological feature, crystallinity, and molecular orientation in the solid state, grazing incident wide X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization were performed. Fig. S21 (ESI†) shows the GIWAXS diffractograms and line-cut profiles of pristine PM6, ITIC-Th-s, and ITIC-Th-Th-s-me films in both the CD and XO solvents. The corresponding GIWAXS parameters are presented in Table S6 (ESI†). The PM6 CD film exhibited a more favorable face-on orientation signifying intense (100) lamellar peaks with q = 0.29 Å−1 in both the in-plane (IP) and the out-of-plane (OOP) directions, and (010) π–π stacking peaks with q = 1.65 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. S21(a), ESI†). Otherwise, the PM6 XO film exhibited a stronger (100) peak at the OOP and a (010) peak in the IP direction relative to those of the PM6 CB film, which is indicative of a mixed orientation (Fig. S21(b), ESI†). For all neat NFA films, distinct (010) peaks appeared in the OOP directions, reflecting a dominant face-on orientation. It should be noted that both ITIC-Th-s CD and XO films exhibited numerous diffraction spots with multiple sharp peaks, whereas neither ITIC-Th-s-me CD nor the XO films exhibited diffraction features in the IP direction. Furthermore, the (010) π–π stacking peaks in the ITIC-Th-s-me films were significantly shifted with shorter d-spacings (d010s) (3.45 and 3.46 Å) and longer CCL010s (22.54 and 20.73 Å) compared to the ITIC-Th-s film. This implied that alkylation could induce enhanced π–π stacking, although it decreased the polycrystallinity in the film (Fig. S21(c)–(f), ESI†).
All blend films exhibited preferential face-on directions, as confirmed by the strong (100) peak in the IP and (010) peak in the OOP direction, similar to those in the pristine films (Fig. 3). Notably, shorter d010s (3.53 and 3.55 Å) with longer CCL010s (10.04 and 8.45 Å) were observed in the PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me film compared to those of the PM6:ITIC-Th-s film, which originated from the improved π–π stacking of ITIC-Th-s-me as shown in the pristine films (Table 3). Additionally, the CCL010s of the CD films (9.29 and 10.04 Å) were observed to be longer than those of the XO films (7.00 and 8.45 Å) for PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me blends (Table 3). This suggests that PM6 and ITIC-Th-s-me adopt a preferred face-on orientation in the BHJ film, which is beneficial for charge transport along the direction vertical to the electrode. The CD films exhibited longer CCL100s (45.74 and 35.58 Å) than the XO films (30.89 and 22.09 Å) in the IP direction (Table 3). This indicates that the sizes of the lamellar crystallinities are significantly reduced in non-halogenated solvents.

As shown in the AFM results, all the XO blend films in both the PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me systems exhibited smooth surface morphologies (Fig. S22(b) and (d), ESI†). It is noted that strong phase separation and well-distributed nano-fibrillar structure with higher root-mean-square surface roughness values (Rqs) of 1.97 and 1.86 nm were observed in the CD blend films (Fig. S22(a) and (c), ESI†). This was because the larger lamellar crystallite (the longer CCL100s) primarily determined the morphology of the blend films, although the extent of π–π stacking was different for both the PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me systems. Each CD and XO blend film exhibited almost identical morphological features with similar Rqs, regardless of the presence of chain alkylation. It can be deduced that a more bi-continuous interpenetrating network structure in halogenated solvents is favorable for efficient charge transport in devices. Together with the GIWAXS results, chain alkylation induced higher FF values in the ITIC-Th-s-me-based devices by improving π–π stacking, and the halogenated solvents further increased these values in the devices by forming a well-distributed bi-continuous network system in the blend films.
Photovoltaic performances under indoor illumination
We selected a common white LED lamp as an indoor light source to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the devices under indoor illumination. The performances of the two NFA-based OPVs were then measured under various light intensities in the 300–1990 lux range, which are typical indoor light intensities.3,18,69 The emission spectra of the LED lamp were recorded using a fiber optics spectrometer, and the integrated power densities of the LED lamp at 300, 550, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750 and 1990 lux corresponded to 96.05, 176.1, 240.4, 318.3, 401.8, 418.9, 562.1 and 633.2 μW cm−2, respectively (Fig. S23(e), ESI†).

Fig. 4(a)–(d) depict the J–V characteristics of the two NFA-based devices at the selected light intensities (300, 550, 1000, 1500, and 1990 lux). The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 4. The additional details of the device performance at all selected light intensities are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S23 and Tables S7, S8). At 1990 lux, PM6:ITIC-Th-s CD based OPVs had a PCE of 19.17%, a JSC of 200.9 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.830 V, and a FF of 0.728. These values were lower compared to the results for PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me CD devices which exhibited a PCE of 22.02%, a JSC of 219.3 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.849 V, and a FF of 0.749. The PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me XO devices had a PCE of 19.61% with a JSC of 204.8 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.846 V, and a FF of 0.717, and a PCE of 22.30% with a JSC of 217.2 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.890 V, and a FF of 0.731, respectively. The observed trend is similar to that of the CD systems. The lower VOCs values of all the devices are due to a down-shifted electron quasi-Fermi level and an up-shifted hole quasi-Fermi level compared to strong (outdoor) illumination.2,3,70 Based on the EQE spectra, the photon flux and integral current density at selected light intensities were calculated (Fig. 4(e) and (f) and Fig. S23(f)–(h), ESI†). The details of the theoretical calculation of the integral current densities are provided in the Experimental Section. The differences between the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements and the calculated values were insignificant, thus proving the reliability of the proposed device results even in indoor environments.

In addition, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity was investigated under indoor conditions at different light intensities. The fitting slopes of JSCversus light intensity were 0.970–0.980, with almost identical values, indicating that the extent of bimolecular recombination in these systems was also independent of the materials and processing solvents, as previously observed (Fig. 4(g)). The leakage current and trap-assisted recombination have generally been identified as the primary factors that affect the VOCs and FFs of IOPV devices, which are mainly due to the low charge carrier density under weak light illumination. Therefore, shunt resistances (Rps), related to the current leakage through pin holes and traps or the current leakage from the edge of devices71 should be the highest possible for efficient IOPVs. The dark J–V measurements and the corresponding differential resistances are shown in Fig. S24 (ESI†). All the blend systems exhibited low dark currents, and the calculated Rps were 3.60, 2.11, 3.44, and 2.54 × 106 Ω cm2 for the PM6:ITIC-Th-s CD, XO, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me CD, and XO based OPVs, respectively. These values are high enough to have a negligible impact on the VOC and FF of the devices. The ideality factors obtained from the fitting slopes in the VOCversus the light intensity plot were 1.734, 1.533, 1.575, and 1.247 for the same sequence of devices (Fig. 4(h)). The higher values in PM6:ITIC-Th-s compared to the PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me systems indicate that the devices suffered from more trap-assisted recombination in the bulk, which also caused the reduction of the FF values in the PM6:ITIC-Th-s devices with same trends as demonstrated above. The larger values compared to those under the AM 1.5G condition signify that trap-assisted recombination had a significant impact on the reduced carrier densities for low-intensity incident light, resulting in changes in the IOPV device performance.19
Nevertheless, all the devices maintained similar PCEs, with values of 18–19 and ∼22% for the ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me-based devices, respectively (Table 4, Fig. S25(b), Tables S7 and S8, ESI†). These values were achieved even at low light intensities (550 and 300 lux), which represents the typical light levels in residential and working indoor spaces.72–74 This phenomenon was obviously due to the less reduction of the FF values in the proposed material-based devices with the decreasing indoor light intensity (Fig. S25(a), ESI†). It has been observed that light intensity below which the FF decreases is determined by Rps, i.e., the higher Rps suppressed the decrease of FFs compared to lower ones.13,75 The extracted Rps (>106 Ω cm2) were sufficiently high as mentioned, and our material systems are believed to exhibit consistent results with the previous studies.
Moreover, the performance differences between the two solvent systems were minor. In particular, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me XO based OPVs achieved a PCE of 22.38% with a JSC of 63.36 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.857 V, and a FF of 0.721 at 550 lux. This is the highest efficiency among the binary material system based IOPVs processed from non-halogenated solvent mixtures to the best of our knowledge. The efficiency chart of the recently published non-halogenated solvent processed IOPVs was outlined for comparison (Table S9, ESI†). The low leakage current, high shunt resistance, and low trap-assisted recombination in both CD and XO solvents suggest that the proposed system has excellent potential for application in non-halogenated IOPVs.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we introduced an alkylthiothiophene side chain onto the ITIC-Th backbone to improve the charge transport by increasing intermolecular interactions. Methyl groups were attached to the end-capping groups to increase the VOC values by restricting the ELUMO levels. These two designed NFAs named ITIC-Th-s and ITIC-Th-s-me have wider band gaps of 1.76 and 1.77 eV compared to ITIC-Th (1.73 eV). When combining these acceptors with the PM6 polymer donor, the outdoor devices yielded PCEs of ∼10 and ∼11% for the PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me blends, respectively. Both CD- and XO-solvent-based devices exhibited similar performances with higher VOCs and lower FFs in the XO system compared to the CD system. This is because the higher trap densities of the CD-based devices could contribute to a reduction of VOC by increasing the hole Fermi level for the EHOMO of the donor. The AFM and GIWAXS results also revealed that methyl substitution induced higher FFs in the PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me devices by improving π–π stacking, and the CD solvents further increased the FFs in the devices by forming a well-distributed bi-continuous network system in the blend films. In addition, these devices exhibited significant photon contributions in the range of 450–700 nm, which is consistent with the absorption features observed in the solid state. These spectral response ranges align with the emission spectra of typical LEDs, which is a prerequisite for indoor applications. Under common white LED illumination, the PM6:ITIC-Th-s and PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me devices yielded PCEs of ∼19 and ∼22% at 1990 lux, and their performance did not change significantly even at 550 and 300 lx, wherein the low light level corresponds to that of residential and working indoor spaces. In particular, PM6:ITIC-Th-s-me based OPV cells processed from XO solvents achieved an impressive PCE of 22.38% at 550 lux, the highest reported efficiency of binary material system based IOPVs processed from the halogen free solvent mixture. This work demonstrates that the design and synthesis of novel NFAs with alkylthiothiophene side-chain engineering is potentially an effective strategy for fabricating highly efficient non-halogenated IOPVs.
