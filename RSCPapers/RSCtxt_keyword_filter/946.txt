    , Accepted 16th April 2014First published on 22nd April 2014AbstractTa2O5–ZnO composite films with varied composition were fabricated by sol–gel processing and applied as cathodic buffer layers (CBLs) for inverted polymer solar cells, and demonstrated enhanced power conversion efficiency with excellent stability. Physical and surface properties of Ta2O5–ZnO CBL films were examined by XPS, AFM, UV-Vis absorption spectra, and goniometry. It was found that CBLs incorporated with Ta2O5 exert two competing impacts on the solar cell performances. On one hand, the presence of Ta2O5 is likely to induce more positive charges around the Zn atom and form Ta–O–Zn bonding; it can reduce the surface charge recombination between the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer and the cathodic buffer layer (CBL), and result in high power conversion efficiency; however, on the other hand an excessive amount of Ta2O5 would block the pathways of charge transport and lead to a drastic reduction in power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have attracted significant attention because of their acceptable energy conversion efficiency, potential to furnish low cost solar electricity, and capability to achieve portable application.1–5 A conventional structure of OPVs (Fig. 1(a)) consists of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer made by blending a p-type polymer donor6–8 with an n-type fullerene acceptor9,10 on the top of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass modified by the hole transporting layer (HTL), such as poly(3,4 ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), etc.,11–14 and a low work function metal serving as the top electrode, typically aluminum, deposited on the top of the active layer. The most widely studied polymer:fullerene system is based on a solution processed p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT) polymer and an n-type [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) fullerene; the highest efficiency of this system is around 5%.3,10,15 By designing low band gap polymer material that can absorb a broader solar spectrum, controlling the microstructure of the BHJ active layer to lengthen exciton diffusion length, and optimizing the device structure efficiency as high as 10% was reported recently.16
 Fig. 1  (a) Conventional structure and (b) inverted structure of OPVs. 
In spite of the dramatic improvement in power conversion efficiency and all the promising advantages, the conventional structure OPVs have a fatal weakness, i.e. a rapid performance degradation due to the low work function top metal electrode, and an unstable interface between the ITO substrate and HTL;17–19 such a rapid performance degradation is unacceptable for any practical application. Therefore, the inverted structure OPV was proposed and studied to circumvent this drawback and demonstrated much improved performance stability.20
Comparing with the conventional structure OPVs, the charge flow path is opposite to that in the inverted one. Fig. 1(b) depicts the inverted OPV's structure. A cathodic buffer layer (CBL), usually a metal oxide such as ZnO, TiOx, Nb2O5, Cs2CO3, or Al2O3,14,21–25 is deposited on ITO glass to reduce its work function in order to lower the barrier for electron transfer to the ITO electrode. In addition, this kind of metal oxide needs to have hole blocking and electron collecting ability to enhance the power conversion efficiency.26 The top electrode is replaced by a high work function metal, such as silver, to fulfill hole collection. The entire inverted structure is: ITO glass/metal oxide layer/(BHJ) active layer/hole transporting layer (HTL)/Ag. The mechanism by which the inverted structure OPVs have improved device stability is twofold: (1) the air sensitive, low work function top electrode (aluminum) is replaced with a stable, high work function metal, either silver or gold, and (2) the interface between the acidic PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer and ITO glass is eliminated from the device.
Although inverted OPVs can improve device stability, they suffer from relatively low power conversion efficiency, possibly because of the electron loss on the interface between the BHJ active layer and the metal oxide layer such as slow charge injection due to work function alignment and electron traps on the CBL's surface defects.27–30 For this reason, a lot of studies focus on the surface modification of metal oxide with self-assembled monolayers, such as C60-SAMs, saline, C60 molecules, and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE),31–35 manipulating its morphology and surface energy,23,36 and new material doping to enhance its electron collecting ability, such as Al-doped ZnO, Ga-doped ZnO, zinc tin oxide, and SrTiO3:ZnO.37–41
In this paper, we try to modify zinc oxide (ZnO) by introducing tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) as cathodic buffer layers (CBLs) for inverted structure OPVs. ZnO is an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap of 3.3 eV and exhibits attractive features such as high electron mobility, good optical transmittance, and excellent stability.42–45 Unfortunately, surface defect and easy formation of oxygen vacancies at the grain boundaries of ZnO often results in low conductivity of CBLs.27–29,46,47 Tantalum pentoxide, on the other hand, is known for its high dielectric constant and index of refraction, and has found a variety of applications in electronics such as tantalum capacitors for its high dielectric constant,48 antireflection coating for solar cells application due to its high refractive index and a low absorption coefficient (less than 103 cm−1) for light,49 and high-k dielectric for DRAM capacitor application.50
By applying Ta2O5–ZnO as the cathodic buffer layer (CBL), a possible mechanism was proposed to explain the relation between CBL composition, surface morphology, surface energy, and surface defect to photo-to-electrical energy conversion. PSEHTT/PC71BM was also studied as the BHJ active layer instead of P3HT/PC61BM in inverted OPVs, and the long-term stability of unencapsulated inverted OPVs under ambient conditions were also examined.
Experimental
Materials
Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT, 4002-E grade) was purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99.0% purity) was purchased from American Dye Source, Inc. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios 4083) was purchased from H. C. Starck. Poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-bis(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)] (PSEHTT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were synthesized by Prof. Jenekhe's group. Zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2, 98.0%), 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.0%), monoethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH–2H2O, 99.0%), tantalum(V) ethoxide (Ta(OC2H5)5, 99.98%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.5%, 200 proof absolute), and acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. ITO glass (10–15 Ω sq−1) substrates were purchased from Colorado Concept Coatings LLC. Samples were prepared on ITO substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm2), which were cleaned prior to use by ultrasonic agitation in a detergent solution, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried under nitrogen flow.
Preparation of the Ta2O5–ZnO cathodic buffer layers

ZnO sol preparation. 
Zinc acetate dehydrate was first dissolved in a mixture of 2-methoxy ethanol and monoethanolamine at room temperature. The concentration of zinc acetate was 0.1 M and the molar ratio of monoethanolamine to zinc acetate was 1:1. The resulting solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 60 °C for 2 h to yield a homogeneous, clear, and transparent sol.


Ta(OR)x sol preparation. 
Tantalum(V) ethoxide was first diluted in ethanol at room temperature, and then acetic acid was added to form a homogeneous, clear, and transparent sol. The final concentration of tantalum(V) was 0.1 M.


Ta(OR)x–ZnO sol preparation. 
Both the Ta(OR)x and the ZnO sol concentrations were 0.1 M, and these two sols were simply mixed with molar ratio (Ta(OR)x:ZnO = 0:100, 6:84, 12:82, 18:82, 24:76, 30:70, 100:0) to form a Ta2O5–ZnO sol.
The Ta2O5–ZnO sols were spin-coated after the prepared solution was aged at room temperature for one day in order to make it more glutinous. The sols were dropped onto ITO glass substrates, which were then spun twice at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After processing, the samples were immediately baked at 300 °C for 10 min and subsequently annealed at 350 °C for 20 min in air to convert to metal oxide. Throughout the device fabrication process, we fixed all the process parameters except the Ta2O5–ZnO sol composition.

Device fabrication

P3HT:PC61BM solution preparation. 
The chlorobenzene solution of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8 by weight) containing P3HT (20 mg mL−1) and PCBM (16 mg mL−1) was stirred in a glovebox at 60 °C overnight. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and then filtered through a 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter.


P3HT:PC61BM device. 
First, the P3HT:PC61BM blend solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates with the Ta2O5–ZnO buffer layer at 700 rpm for 30 s. Then the samples were baked at 225 °C for 1 min to help self-organization of P3HT, as well as to drive away residual solvent and assist the polymer contact with the Ta2O5–ZnO cathodic buffer layer. Then, the diluted PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated onto the active layer to form the hole-transport layer. The films were then baked at 120 °C for 10 min. A 100 nm thick Ag film was finally deposited under a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr as the top electrode. The device structure of space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement is the same only without the PEDOT:PSS layer.


PSEHTT:PC71BM solution preparation. 
PSEHTT/PC71BM blend solution with a composition of 1:2 ratio (w/w) was prepared by mixing 0.6 mL of the 6 mg mL−1 PSEHTT in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with 0.12 mL of the 60 mg mL−1 PC71BM in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 2.5% (v/v) processing additive of 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and stirred for 10 min at 100 °C on a hot plate.


PSEHTT:PC71BM device. 
First, the PSEHTT/PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates with the Ta2O5–ZnO buffer layer at 400 rpm for 40 s to form a 60–70 nm active layer. Then the samples were vacuum-dried for 30 min. After that, 7.5 nm MoO3 and 120 nm Ag film were deposited under a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr onto the active layer to form the hole-transport layer and top electrode.


I–V characterization
The I–V characteristics of the solar cell were tested in a glovebox using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and an Oriel Xenon lamp (450 W) coupled with an AM1.5 filter. A silicon solar cell certified by the national renewable energy laboratory (NREL) was used as a reference to calibrate the measurement conditions. The light intensity used in this study was 100 mW cm−2.
Ta2O5–ZnO buffer layer characterization
The surface morphologies of the specimens were obtained using AFM (Asylum Research MFP-3D Stand Alone AFM) operated in tapping mode. Optical transmittance spectra were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (EVO30 PC) UV-vis recording spectrophotometer over the wavelength range between 300 and 900 nm. XPS spectra and secondary electron cutoff were generated using a PHI Versaprobe system with an Al Kα X-ray source and a 100 μm beam size. The work function value was calibrated with pure gold foil (5.1 eV). Measurements were taken while the sample was under ultrahigh vacuum (10−10 Torr). The contact angle was measured by goniometer, and each sample was measured four times in different areas.
Results and discussion
Power conversion efficiency of the inverted OPVs with P3HT:PC61BM as BHJ layer

Fig. 2 shows the I–V curves of the inverted OPVs with various Ta2O5–ZnO films as cathodic buffer layers (CBLs), and Table 1 summarizes the I–V characteristics based on the results presented in Fig. 2. Comparing pure ZnO CBL with a small amount of Ta2O5 (<18%) added, the fill factor is found to monotonically increase from 0.61 to 0.67 with an increase in the amount of Ta2O5, while both short circuit current density and open circuit voltage remain unchanged at 0.63 V and 9.7 mA cm−2, respectively. As a result, the overall power conversion efficiency increases from 3.7% to a maximum of 4.12%. However, when the amount of Ta2O5 in the CBLs exceeds 24%, the power conversion efficiency reduces rapidly because of the sharp decrease of the fill factor. For the OPVs with pure Ta2O5 as the CBL, there is almost no detectable solar to electrical power conversion.

Such a change in power conversion efficiency with an increasing amount of Ta2O5 incorporated into the CBLs, first increasing to a maximum and then decreasing, indicates there are two competing and opposite mechanisms in play. A closer look reveals that the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage remain constant with <24% Ta2O5–ZnO films as CBLs in inverted OPVs; however, there are some differences in the fill factor. The fill factor is known to be determined by series and shunt resistances of the solar cell device. The series resistance represents the overall series resistance and the shunt resistance is related to the recombination process in the device, respectively. As shown in Table 1, with a small amount of Ta2O5 (<18%) in CBLs, the series resistance stays at the same level, however, the shunt resistance gradually increases from 0.67 to 3.3 kΩ cm2. The increase in shunt resistance suggests that the charge recombination is reduced. With further increasing the amount of Ta2O5 to 24% or 30%, the increase in series resistance becomes predominant, resulting in low power conversion efficiency.
In order to understand the possible mechanisms by which the Ta2O5–ZnO films as CBLs affect power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted OPVs, the chemical and physical properties of the CBL were examined including transparency, morphology, surface energy, surface element composition, crystallinity, and electron mobility of Ta2O5–ZnO films.
Transparency of Ta2O5–ZnO films

Fig. 3 compares the UV-Vis absorption spectra of various Ta2O5–ZnO thin films, and it is clear that the UV-Vis absorption spectra have no significant difference regardless of the amount of Ta2O5. All the Ta2O5–ZnO films have good optical transmittance in the visible region with no appreciable antireflection effect with the incorporation of Ta2O5 in CBLs. It might be because the Ta2O5–ZnO film is very thin, only ∼10 nm, and could be considered as completely transparent. Therefore, the introduction of various amounts of Ta2O5 in CBLs will not change its UV-Vis absorption spectra. Antireflection effect occurred when the thickness of Ta2O5 was up to 80 nm, as reported in literature.49 Almost identical UV-Vis absorption spectra of CBLs with varied chemical composition suggest that the transmittance of the CBLs is not a determining factor affecting the power conversion efficiency.

Surface morphology and surface energy of Ta2O5–ZnO films

Fig. 4 shows the AFM and contact angle images of Ta2O5–ZnO films on ITO glasses. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness and contact angle values are summarized in Table 2. It can be observed that the root mean square (RMS) value decreases when a small amount of Ta2O5 is blended into ZnO film (3.25 nm (pure ZnO) → 2.55 nm (6% Ta2O5)), and gradually increases with increasing Ta2O5 amount (2.55 nm (6% Ta2O5) → 3.05 nm (30% Ta2O5)). A smoother surface (with lower surface roughness) could be good for serving as CBLs for the inverted OPVs as it might allow better contact of the active polymer layer to the CBL.23 However, it could not explain the fact that there is a significant drop of PCE when the amount of Ta2O5 varied from 18 to 30% in CBLs since the surface morphology does not show an appreciable difference. The contact angle of the films in the range of 50–55° does not show a detectable trend with varying the Ta2O5–ZnO composition, which means that the surface energy remains the same regardless of the addition of Ta2O5. All the films are slightly more hydrophilic compared with ITO glass.

Work function and surface chemical analysis of Ta2O5–ZnO films
Surface chemical analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 5). Both the Zn2p3/2 and Ta4f data for each sample were scaled to the O1s emission intensity and shifted such that the O1s peaks had the same binding energy as 531 eV (this was necessary to account for charge neutralization and some surface contamination that suppressed the intensities of the peaks during transfer to the XPS system). For the Ta4f7/2 and Zn2p3/2 spectrum from the surfaces of the CBLs, their peaks are assigned as 26.35 and 1022.175 eV which represents Ta2O5 and ZnO.51 The intensity of Zn2p3/2 decreased with the addition of Ta2O5, whereas the intensity of Ta4f increased when the Ta2O5 concentration increased. As shown in Table 2, the peaks of Zn2p3/2 shift to higher binding energy in the presence of Ta2O5, and it suggests that the Zn2+ cation may be transformed to Zn(2+δ)+ and this transfer could be accounted for by positively charged Ta5+. When the concentration of Ta2O5 increased, Zn2p3/2 peaks shift to higher binding energy; it can be proposed that Ta2O5–ZnO films do not only form as a physical mixture with two distinct Ta2O5 and ZnO phases, but form a chemical bond such as Ta–O–Zn in the system. If we correlate the XPS results with the PCE data, it can be proposed that more positive charge around Zn might benefit the electron transfer from the BHJ layer to the CBLs or lower the possibility of electron recombination occurring on the interface between the BHJ layer and CBLs.

The work function was calculated using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) secondary electron cut off region, and is shown in Table 2. The work function of the Ta2O5–ZnO film fluctuated with chemical composition, first increasing with the addition of Ta2O5 from −4.9 eV for pure ZnO film to −4.69 eV (6%Ta2O5–ZnO), and gradually decreasing as more Ta2O5 was added. The high work function is favorable to electron transfer from the BHJ active layer to CBLs in the inverted polymer solar cell application,35 however, the results obtained in the present investigation fell within the experimental error and demonstrated no direct relationship with the variation of power conversion efficiency. It definitely could not explain the fact that there was a significant drop of PCE in inverted OPVs with 24% and 30% Ta2O5–ZnO films used as CBLs.
Electron mobility and crystallinity of Ta2O5–ZnO films
Electron mobility can be determined by fitting the dark I–V curves for the single carrier devices with space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model.52 The electron-only structure of the device was ITO/Ta2O5–ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Al fabricated to evaluate the electron mobility of Ta2O5–ZnO film by the charge transfer model of SCLC. The current is given by:J = 9/8 × ε0 × εr × μe × V2/D3where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of PCBM, μe is the electron mobility, and D is the thickness of the active layer. From Table 2, comparing with pure ZnO device (1.49 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), the electron mobility of <18% Ta2O5–ZnO devices remains at the same level as pure ZnO (∼10−5 m2 V−1 s−1). While continuing the addition of Ta2O5, the electron mobility begin to drop drastically (∼10−7 m2 V−1 s−1), which correlates with the poor power conversion efficiency with 24% and 30%Ta2O5–ZnO films as CBLs.
Moreover, the crystallinity of 18% Ta2O5–ZnO and pure ZnO films were examined by XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. NaCl was introduced by adding a drop of NaCl aqueous solution to the XRD samples and followed by crystallization at ambient conditions, and was used to detect any possible instrumental shift of the XRD peak positions. From Fig. 6, there is no signature peak representing Ta2O5, which means that Ta2O5 phase can not be detected by XRD and is more likely to form the amorphous phase. No shift existed of any ZnO XRD peaks in low and high diffraction angles; this result is a clear indication that there is no change of lattice constant in ZnO crystals further indicating that there is no incorporation of Ta ions into ZnO lattice. Moreover, the crystal size of these two films calculated by Scherrer equation are both 4.1 nm. It is very reasonable considering the fact that Zn2+ has a coordination number of 4 with an ionic radius of 60 pm, whereas Ta5+ typically has a coordination number of 6 with an ionic radius of 65 pm.53 However, its ionic radius is more likely to be <35 pm when subjected to a coordination number of 4 and, thus, it is very unlikely that Ta5+ would enter the ZnO crystal lattice. Moreover, the intensity of the ZnO peak enormously reduced when Ta2O5 was present, which suggests that part of ZnO may also become amorphous. Recalling the XPS results presented and discussed earlier in this paper, we have demonstrated that Ta–O–Zn chemical bonds unambiguously exist. The most reasonable explanation is that a fraction of ZnO formed an amorphous phase with Ta2O5 added to the film. Although it is not possible to determine the chemical composition and the volume fraction of such an amorphous phase, the amount of amorphous phase is likely to increase with an increased addition of Ta2O5 to the film. The presence of an amorphous phase and/or the small amount of crystalline ZnO will affect the electron transfer through CBLs, and result in low electron mobility, high series resistance, and small fill factor. When the amount of Ta2O5 in CBLs reaches a certain concentration, the amount of ZnO–Ta2O5 amorphous phase reaches such a volume fraction that forms an uncontinuous network with ZnO crystals embedded and separated by ZnO–Ta2O5 amorphous phase. Consequently, the electron transfer through ZnO percolated network is restricted, resulting in a drastic reduction in fill factor and power conversion efficiency. When Ta2O5 is used as a CBL, there is no detectable solar-to-electrical power conversion. It should be noted that this result is different from what was reported in an earlier paper54 in which an inverted solar cell with Nb2O5 film as the CBL showed a ∼3% power conversion efficiency. Although there is no clear explanation for such a discrepancy, Nb2O5 film (made with one spin-coating layer) reported in ref. 54 was presumably much thinner, half the thickness of the Ta2O5 film (two spin-coating layers), investigated in this study, while tunneling conduction decreases exponentially with increased thickness. In our previous work, the use of two spin-coating layers of Nb2O5 resulted in zero efficiency of the solar cell,54 consistent with the Ta2O5 results presented here.

Furthermore, the improvement in fill factor might also be relative to the employment of different materials in CBLs and the change of the film's surface chemistry.37–41 It was reported that ZnO grain defects play an important role in decreasing the electrical conductivity. There are numerous studies focusing on the low conductivity of thin ZnO layers in OPVs, and it results from the presence of adsorbed oxygen at its grain boundaries. The adsorbed oxygen can serve as an electron trap at these boundaries and therefore reduces the conductivity of these layers.26,30,55 Therefore, both pure ZnO and 12% Ta2O5–ZnO films were annealing under oxygen or nitrogen atmosphere to simulate oxygen-rich or oxygen-barren in surface grain boundaries, and the results are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 7.

It was found that compared with processing under O2 environment, the power conversion efficiency of the inverted OPVs with pure ZnO as CBLs was improved if it was annealed under N2 atmosphere, which explains that the oxygen adsorbed in ZnO's grain boundaries can be removed if we apply the N2 atmosphere to process our CBLs. However, for the inverted OPVs with 12% Ta2O5–ZnO films as CBLs, the power conversion efficiency remains the same when annealing in either O2 or N2 atmosphere. Although the exact mechanism to explain such insensitivity of Ta2O5–ZnO CBLs to O2 and N2 annealing is not known, this observation is likely to suggest that ZnO's surface grain boundaries and oxygen trapping sites are somehow covered by the Ta2O5 phase, or Ta2O5–ZnO becomes composite and has less surface grain boundaries to adsorb oxygen molecules. Ta2O5 is known for its high dielectric constant and it is also proposed that high dielectric constant material would favor the effective charge transfer in PSCs.40,47 Applying high dielectric constant material as CBLs might form a spontaneous polarization to create an internal electric field while PSCs are in operation and reduce the electron recombination possibility,40 which can also contribute to power conversion efficiency enhancement.
PSEHTT/PC71BM as BHJ active layer and long-term stability
In order to demonstrate the effect of Ta2O5–ZnO CBLs for the inverted OPVs with different BHJ systems, PSEHTT/PC71BM was applied as the active layer and replaced the commonly used P3HT/PC61BM. PSEHTT is a kind of thiazolothiazole–dithienosilole copolymer semiconductor presented by Jenekhe's group in 2011, and achieved 5% power conversion efficiency in conventional structure OPVs at that time.56 Inverted structure OPVs were prepared by combing PSEHTT/PC71BM and Ta2O5–ZnO CBLs, and the power conversion efficiency and I–V curves are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 8. The highest efficiency is around 5.6% with 12% Ta2O5 film as CBLs, a 6% improvement compared with the 5.2% efficiency for pure ZnO as CBLs, which means that the Ta2O5–ZnO films as CBLs also work for PSEHTT/PC71BM systems to improve the overall power conversion efficiency. It should also be noted that the trend shown in Fig. 8 appears very similar to that in Fig. 2. When a small amount of Ta2O5 was added, the power conversion efficiency increased with the concentration of added Ta2O5, and then there was a drastic drop of PCE when the Ta2O5 content reached a certain level. Therefore, the effect of Ta2O5 in CBLs to the overall PCE could be taken as a similar phenomenon for various types of inverted OPVs.

Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the unencapsulated inverted OPVs was periodically measured for 42 days to monitor their long-term stability in air (Fig. 9). All devices retain around 100% of the magnitude of their original power conversion efficiency after being exposed to ambient conditions for 42 days. This explicitly demonstrates the superior air stability of inverted OPVs.

Conclusions
Ta2O5–ZnO films have been fabricated and demonstrated as cathodic buffer layers in inverted polymer solar cells for improved power conversion efficiency. The device performance was found to be strongly dependent on the amount of Ta2O5 in CBLs. The data suggested that with Ta present in CBLs, Ta–O–Zn bonding was formed, which is beneficial to the overall PCE. Moreover, some surface gain boundaries might be covered by Ta2O5 resulting in fewer oxygen adsorbing sites. Ta2O5, famous for its high dielectric constant, might also provide a self-built electric field on the interface between the HBJ active layer and CBL to reduce the electron recombination resulting in enhanced power conversion efficiency. However, a continued increase in the amount of Ta2O5 in ZnO film led to lower electron mobility and low crystallinity of CBLs. In the present study, it was found that the power conversion efficiency of the P3HT/PC61BM system increases from 3.7% to 4.12%, presenting an 11% enhancement, and for the PSEHTT/PC71BM system, the power conversion efficiency increases from 5.29% to 5.61%. Moreover, the long-term stability of the unencapsulated inverted OPVs was periodically measured for 42 days. All the devices retained around 100% of their original power conversion efficiencies.
