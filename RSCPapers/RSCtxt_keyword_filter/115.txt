    , Accepted 18th June 2018First published on 25th June 2018AbstractSurface passivation in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) plays a very important role in preventing surface charge recombination and thus enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). ZnSe passivation with dopant in CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve the PCE. In the present study, a series of characterizations revealed that a Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer can not only reduce surface charge recombination, but also enhance light harvesting. By means of density functional theory calculation along with a systematic study of electronic band structure, it has been found that the valence band of ZnSe moves upward on Mn-ion doping which leads to acceleration of charge separation and broader light absorption range. The impact of the Mn ion on charge recombination and light harvesting has been interpreted reasonably and the PCE of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs with Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer is as high as 6.46%, which is 1.5 times that of the solar cell without the passivation layer.
Introduction
The development of cost-effective and high-performance solar devices for clean and sustainable energy partially to replace fossil fuels has been an urgent matter all over the world.1 As a type of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) has a similar layer structure to a DSSC.2 QDSSCs offer more advantages, such as unique sensitizer quantum dots with readily tuneable band gap energy by controlling the particle size, multiple exciton generation effects, high molar extinction coefficients and robustness toward moisture and oxygen.3–5 In addition, these quantum effects permit a theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSSC of up to 44%.6–8 However, the currently achieved PCE of QDSSC remains much lower than the theoretical PCE. There are many possible reasons for the low PCE of QDSSC, such as inferior crystallinity, high density of defects and poor interface between QDs and wide band gap semiconducting oxide, leading to less desirable optoelectronic properties of QDs and high charge recombination in devices.9,10
A lot of works focus on a new type of counter electrode (CE) to improve device performance.52,53 But the CE part still has lower conductivity (i.e., sheet conductivity) and poor electrocatalytic activity toward electrolyte regeneration, which increase the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface and decrease the fill factor (FF) and PCE of QDSSC.54 Another useful way to enhance the performance of QDSSC is surface passivation.11 Passivation can form a uniform barrier layer to separate the photoanode with QDs and electrolyte as well as repair the surface defects of the QDs. A well-designed passivation can reduce the electron recombination effectively and passivation should promote the separation process of electrons and holes.12,19 The passivation materials should form type II core–shell structure with QDs to facilitate the separation process.13–18,21
ZnSe is one suitable inorganic passivation material to form a type II core–shell structure for CdSe/CdS QDs because of its suitable band structure and it has been widely used for QDSSC passivation.13 Huang et al. have demonstrated that type II band alignment would not only prevent electron back transfer to the electrolyte but may also facilitate the desired hole transport from the QDs to the electrolyte, because both Ecb and Evb of ZnSe are higher than those of CdS/CdSe QDs.20,34 However, ZnSe with wide band gap and desirable electronic structure does not allow absorption in the long-wavelength regions.13,22 An effective method to adjust the material energy band structure is to dope with a transition metal ion such as Mn2+.23,24 The dopant might impact the distribution of electron state density in QDs, which influences the properties of nanomaterials signally. Besides, this dopant shows both spin- and orbital-forbidden Mn d–d transition (4T1–6A1) resulting in a long lifetime in the range of microseconds to milliseconds, which facilitates long-lived photo-generated carriers.4 A lot of work has been published concerning the impact of transition metal Mn ion in QDs.25,26 Kamat et al. first doped Mn ion into CdS/CdSe QDs to improve the PCE of QDSSC to over 5%.24 The PCE of CdSe QDSSC was promoted to over 6% by the Cao group.23 Detailed work about the role of Mn2+ in CdS QDSSC was published by Santra et al.4 Especially, Gopi et al. have studied the influence of dopant Mn ion in ZnSe layer and a PCE of 5.67% was reached, which showed a great improvement in CdS/CdSe QDSSC.27 However, there are few works explaining the impacts of Mn ion in the system of QDSSC from the point of view of electronic band structure, which affects the photovoltaic properties and electron–hole separation process radically. The study of Mn-ion impact on the electronic band structure can help give a better understanding of the mechanism of charge generation, transfer and recombination in QDSSC.
Here, the impacts of Mn ion doped in a ZnSe passivation layer on the photovoltaic properties and electron–hole separation process of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSC have been systematically studied. It can be found that the valence band of ZnSe moves upward on Mn-ion doping through density functional theory (DFT) calculation, rather than creating electronic states between the band gap as generally believed.10,24,27 Compared with CdS/CdSe QDSSC without passivation layer, CdS/CdSe QDSSC covered with Mn-doped ZnSe showed a noticeable improvement with an enhanced PCE. The mechanisms have also been discussed in detail to explain the improvement of the PCE for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSC.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent conducting film (FTO, transmittance 80–82%, 7–8 Ω m−2) and titanium oxide (TiO2, P25, Degussa) were purchased from OPV Tech Co. Ltd. Sulfur powder (S, reagent grade, 100 mesh), manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate ((CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O, 99%), nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt monohydrate (N(CH2COONa)3·H2O, 98%), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 98%) and cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, reagent grade, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Selenium powder (Se, 200 mesh, 99.999%) and brass foil (alloy 260, 0.51 mm thick) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Sodium sulfite anhydrous (Na2SO3, 98%), ethyl cellulose ([C6+2nH7+8nO2+4n]x), terpineol (C10H18O, 95%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, 99%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%), and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin. Zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2H2O, AR, 99%) was purchased from J&K Scientific. Ethanol absolute (C2H6O, 99.8%) was purchased from FUYU Chemical and methanol (CH4O, 99.5%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
Preparation of the photoanode
The FTO glasses were immersed into methylbenzene, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in ultrasonic cleaners in sequence so that they were completely cleaned for subsequent use. A dilute slurry was prepared by blending 3.5 g terpineol, 1 g P25 TiO2 powder and 0.5 g ethyl cellulose with 50 ml ethanol. Then, the dilute slurry was stirred until all the ethanol volatilized to afford a thick TiO2 slurry. Porous TiO2 substrates were prepared by blade coating the TiO2 slurry on clean FTO glass. The area of the deposited TiO2 film was 0.196 cm2 which was determined by adhesive tape. The substrates were lastly calcined at 500 °C for 30 min to eliminate the ethyl cellulose and ethanol, forming mesoporous structures.
The CdS and CdSe quantum dots were synthesized by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method and chemical bath deposition (CBD) according to previous literature.20,21 In brief, the TiO2 substrates were immersed into cation solution and anion solution alternately. The cation solution was composed of 0.1 mol L−1 Cd(NO3)2·4H2O methanol solution and the anion solution was prepared by dissolving Na2S·9H2O in solvent composed of methanol and water with volume ratio of 1:1. The TiO2 substrates were first immersed in Cd2+ solution for 1 min, and then dipped in S2− solution for another 1 min after being rinsed with methanol. It required 5 times to produce enough uniform CdS quantum dots on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. As for CdSe quantum dot, the CBD method was used to deposit it. The CBD stock solution was composed of 0.1 mol L−1 Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.15 mol L−1 N(CH2COONa)3·H2O and 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SeSO3 with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. It is worth mentioning that the Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared by mixing Na2SO3 and selenium powder into deionized water. And then the films of TiO2/CdS were soaked in stock solution for 3 hours under dark condition in a sealed bottle.
Synthesis of the passivation layer
Compared with the film of TiO2/CdS/CdSe, other samples were respectively passivated by ZnSe and Mn-doped ZnSe layers for further characterization. The ZnSe passivation layer was prepared by the SILAR method. Specifically, the film without passivation layer was immersed into aqueous solution containing 0.06 mol L−1 NaHSe and 0.06 mol L−1 Zn(Ac)2·2H2O for 2 minutes. And rinsing with deionized water after deposition was conducted to remove the solution. 3 SILAR cycles were needed to form a uniform ZnSe passivation layer, and NaHSe solution was prepared by dissolving selenium powder and NaBH4 in deionized water under an atmosphere of argon to prevent Se2− from being oxidized. The synthetic process of Mn-doped ZnSe layer was the same as that of the ZnSe layer, except that a mixed solution of 0.048 mol L−1 Zn(Ac)2·2H2O and 0.012 mol L−1 Mn(Ac)2·4H2O was used instead of 0.06 mol L−1 Zn(Ac)2·2H2O.
Preparation of electrolyte and counter electrode
The electrolyte in the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSC was a polysulfide electrolyte as many researchers have reported.20,21,28 The liquid electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving 1 M Na2S·9H2O and 1 M sulfur powder in deionized water at a temperature of 50 °C for 1 hour. Brass foil was rinsed in 37% HCl at 80 °C for 30 minutes so that the Zn can be removed fully for further use. Then preprocessed brass foil was immersed into electrolyte to form a nanostructure of Cu2S on the surface of the brass foil. Lastly, the photoanode, counter electrode and electrolyte were assembled in a sandwich structure for characterization.
Characterization
The morphologies of photoanodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3, Czech). Compositional analyses were conducted by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, AMETEK, USA) equipped in SEM (TESCAN MIRA3, Czech). The ultraviolet and visible light (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum and photoluminescence spectrum were obtained by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H, Japan) and a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu RF-5301PC, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS UltraDLD, UK) was used to characterize the sample components and corresponding valence. The J–V curves were obtained by a Keithley 2400 source meter under an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Zolix, China) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. An electrochemical workstation (Chinstruments CHI660E, China) was used to conduct electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and measure open circuit voltage decay (VOC).
Results and discussion
The SEM images were obtained at 15 kV high voltage with image magnification of 100 K. The top-view SEM images of photoanodes in Fig. 1(a–c) show the morphologies of the TiO2/QDs (TiO2/CdS/CdSe), TiO2/QDs/ZnSe and TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe (Mn-doped ZnSe) films, respectively. No apparent difference was observed among the 3 samples. It is worth noting that QDs coated with ZnSe passivation layer and Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer were partially covered by thin films with some pores as previous literature has reported.27 But, the sample with Mn-ion-doped ZnSe passivation layer had a larger coverage area. The pore structure in the surface can promote the penetration of the electrolyte and constrain the light within the photoanode to improve the light absorption to some degree.27,29 The cross-sectional view SEM images of photoanodes are shown in Fig. S1.† The main elements in the photoanodes were analyzed by means of EDX with the results shown in Fig. 1(d–f) and the atomic ratios are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 2(a) shows the XPS spectrum of TiO2 film loaded with QDs and Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer. The peak at binding energy of 284.6 eV corresponds to calibration peak C 1s. The peaks at 1022.33 eV and 1045.51 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, indicating the presence of Zn. The peak at 55.2 eV corresponds to Se 3d. Peaks located at 641 eV and 652 eV are assigned to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, indicating the presence of Mn. EDX mapping was employed to investigate the distribution of Mn ions on the photoanode. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the distributions of elements Zn, Se and Mn were homogeneous over the mesoporous TiO2. The XRD patterns of all photoanodes were analysed under the FTO substrate, which are shown in Fig. S2.† The peak broadened at around 43° for CdS/CdSe QDs can be attributed to their small size.55 There is no obvious difference between FTO/TiO2/QDs/ZnSe and FTO/TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe because of the low content of manganese.

Fig. 3(a) shows the UV-Vis spectra of the photoanode without passivation layer, and with ZnSe passivation layer and Mn-ZnSe passivation layer. The inset photograph corresponds to the three photoanodes. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured at wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 800 nm with light source changed from tungsten lamp to deuterium lamp at a wavelength of 340 nm. Apparently, TiO2/QDs without passivation layer and with ZnSe and Mn-ZnSe passivation layers show gradually increasing light absorption rate and red-shift successively. The increasing light absorption of TiO2/QDs/ZnSe can be explained by Huang's work: the enhanced amount and enlarged particle size of QDs.21 The increasing light absorption of TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe is probably because of the structure of thin film with pores which have been introduced in the discussion of SEM images.30 As for red-shifted absorption edge, the phenomenon between TiO2/QDs and TiO2/QDs/ZnSe was widely reported in the literature.31–33 Briefly, partial overlap of the exciton wave functions between CdSe QDs and ZnSe layer causes the interaction between these two parts.35 In other words, photons with lower energy will be absorbed to create excitons by exciting electrons from valence band of passivation layer to conduction band of the QDs. But it is obvious that Mn-doped ZnSe sample has a broader absorption spectrum than that of ZnSe passivation without dopant. For a thorough understanding of this phenomenon, the optical bandgap of the samples was estimated from the UV-Vis spectrum by eqn (1), where A is the absorbance, c is a constant, ν is the frequency and h is Planck's constant:36 (Ahv)2 = c(hv − Eg).(1)

As is illustrated in Fig. 3(b), samples without passivation layer, and with ZnSe and Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layers have optical bandgaps of 1.93 eV (∼642 nm), 1.88 eV (∼659 nm) and 1.86 eV (∼667 nm), respectively. It is obvious that films with ZnSe and Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layers have broader absorption range than that of the control sample. And the light absorption edge of Mn-doped ZnSe passivated film shifts to a longer wavelength (∼667 nm, 1.86 eV) than that of the ZnSe passivated film which might mean the impurity ion changed the position of ZnSe valence and conduction bands. The inset shows a photograph of the 3 photoanodes with successively darker colour which corresponds to broader absorption range, which tallies with the UV-Vis spectra as well.
To investigate the effect of Mn ion on ZnSe band structure, the band structures of ZnSe and Mn-ion doped ZnSe have been calculated. Our calculations are achieved by Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 5.2 code which is based on DFT. The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof is adopted to describe the exchange–correlation energy between electrons within the projector augmented wave method. And the cutoff energy for plane waves is set to 400 eV.37 Mn-doped ZnSe and ZnSe without Mn ion are respectively calculated in unit cell (8 atoms) and supercell (2 × 2 × 2, 64 atoms), whose structural optimizations are applied by relaxing the positions of all the atoms until the convergence tolerance of force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1.38 It is worth noting that Mn-ion doping concentration is 1/64 and its doping site is at the site of a Zn atom. Their structural optimizations are carried out by Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 5 × 5 × 5 and 11 × 11 × 11 in Brillouin zone, respectively. Then the lattice parameters of Mn-doped ZnSe and ZnSe without Mn ion are fixed at 11.45 Å and 5.74 Å. Gaussian smearing and the high symmetric route of M–K–Γ–M are used to calculate the band structures. The band structures and corresponding density of state (DOS) plots of Mn-doped ZnSe and ZnSe without Mn doping are shown in Fig. 4 and 5.
 Fig. 4  Calculated band structures of ZnSe with its DOS on the right panel. 
 Fig. 5  Calculated band structures of manganese-doped ZnSe include (a) spin-down polarization and (b) spin-up polarization, with the DOS plots in the center panel. 
As shown in Fig. 4 and 5, obviously, pristine ZnSe without Mn ion and Mn-doped ZnSe both appear with direct bandgaps since their valence band maximum (VBM) is locate at Γ point while their conduction band minimum (CBM) appears at Γ point as well. As for the bandgap, pure ZnSe bandgap is direct with Eg of 1.14 eV while the bandgap of Mn-doped ZnSe is direct with Eg of 1.25 eV (spin-down) and 1.01 eV (spin-up), which is because of the spin polarization of manganese. But the band gap that is responsible for the photon absorption is correlated to the smaller one, that is, the spin-up band gap at 1.01 eV. And it is evident that the bandgap of ZnSe slightly decreased after Mn-ion doping. It is well known that the calculation result of bandgap based on DFT is always underestimated because of improper consideration of the Coulomb interaction,39 so that the calculation result of the pure ZnSe bandgap (∼1.14 eV) is lower than its real value (∼2.70 eV). Hence, it is significant to pay more attention to the bandgap variation of ZnSe before and after Mn-ion doping rather than the absolute numerical value.
The detailed electron DOS plots are demonstrated in Fig. 6. The conclusion can be drawn that the VBM of ZnSe is primarily comprised of Zn 3d, Zn 4p and Se 4p orbitals and the CBM mainly consists of Zn 4s and Se 4p orbitals from Fig. 6(a) and (b). As shown in the middle part of Fig. 5, the sharp peak near the spin-up Fermi level shows the intense localization properties. The detailed DOS plots of Mn-doped ZnSe are shown in Fig. 6(c)–(h), but the discussion below is all about the spin-up polarization. It seems that the spin-up polarization mainly comes from Zn 3d and Se 4p. Mn 3d also contributes to the spin polarization, but the contribution is limited due to the low doping content of Mn (∼1.6%); however, according to the calculation results as presented above, Mn doping leads to significant spin polarization of Zn 3d and Se 4p in ZnSe. It is evident that after Mn-ion doping into ZnSe, there is no gap state appearing between the bandgap as much literature has reported.27 However, such defects exhibit localized state characteristics near the VBM rather than forming gap states which can act as trap centers for the carriers.40 In view of the result of UV-Vis, and the band structures, it can be concluded that it is the impurity manganese that causes the valence band of ZnSe to move upward which leads to the red-shift in the UV-Vis spectrum.41 A schematic of band edge alignment is shown in Scheme 1(b), where E2 corresponds to the original infrared absorption edge (∼659 nm, ∼1.88 eV). With Mn doping into ZnSe, the VBM of ZnSe will move upward which causes E′2 to be less than E2, that is, the photoanode with Mn-ZnSe passivation layer will have a longer infrared absorption edge than that without Mn doping.

Fig. 7(a) shows the EIS spectra of QDSSC with ZnSe or Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer and without any passivation layer. The EIS spectra were measured from 0.1 kHz to 100 kHz under dark condition with a forward bias of −0.6 V and amplitude of 10 mV. And the EIS results of QDSSC with various passivation layers were fitted by Z-view software which was based on the equivalent circuit provided in the inset of Fig. 7(a). As shown in the equivalent circuit, R0 represents the FTO substrate square resistance and the contact resistance between FTO and TiO2. The first small semicircle located at high frequency region in the Nyquist plot corresponds to R1 that represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Rct represents the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte surfaces and within the TiO2 particles which is the large semicircle located at low frequency region in the Nyquist plot.42 The EIS fitting results are shown in Table 2. There is no obvious tendency of R1 as passivation layer to change, but Rct changed markedly. The sample with highest Rct is Mn-doped ZnSe (191.2 Ω), followed by ZnSe (169.4 Ω) and the sample without passivation layer (104.0 Ω). Since Rct represents the charge recombination resistance within the photoanode, the higher the value of Rct, the harder it is for recombination of electrons and holes.43 The Bode plots of various passivation layers are shown in Fig. 7(b). The angular frequency ωmin corresponding to the peak of Bode plot can be used to calculate electron lifetime (τn) according to the following equation: (2)where τn is the electron lifetime and fmin is the peak frequency.44 The calculated results are listed in Table 2. As we expected, the device with the Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer exhibited a long electron lifetime (51.51 ms), followed by ZnSe (42.53 ms) and the sample without passivation layer (16.30 ms). Both Rct and τn indicate that the passivation layer can reduce charge surface recombination efficiently and the Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer shows a better performance than the undoped ZnSe passivation layer.

The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) for the QDSSCs can provide information about the photogenerated electron lifetime which mainly depends on recombination processes occurring at the surface of TiO2/QDs/electrolyte and redox process with polysulfide electrolyte. One sun simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) was maintained until the solar cells came to a steady state. Then the sunlight simulator was switched off and the evolution of voltage versus time was recorded under dark conditions. The OCVD results for all devices are shown in Fig. 7(c), for which the Voc of the devices with ZnSe passivation layers decays slower than that of the devices without passivation layer. What is more, devices with Mn-doped ZnSe passivation show a slower Voc decay rate than the devices with ZnSe passivation. A widely used method to calculate electron lifetime from OVCD is based on the reciprocal time derivative of the open-circuit voltage decay, normalized to the thermal voltage: (3)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T room temperature, e the elementary charge, Voc the open circuit voltage, t the time.45 The calculated results of τn are shown in Fig. 7(d), from which τn can be linked with photogenerated electron recombination process. The electron lifetime from high to low in order is: TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe, TiO2/QDs/ZnSe and TiO2/QDs as we expected. The variation trend of electron lifetime from different cells fitted well with results of EIS and dark current curve that we discussed above. Comparing samples TiO2/QDs/ZnSe and TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe, the prolonged τn confirms that nonradiative carrier recombination at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface is suppressed, which is mainly because Mn-ion heterogeneous nucleation can increase the covering area of the passivation layer as shown in Fig. 1(d–f).45
Dark current curves of QDSSCs with Mn-ZnSe or ZnSe passivation and without passivation are shown in Fig. 8(a), which were scanned under dark condition from −0.1 V to 0.6 V and the scan interval was 7 mV. According to the dark current curve, it is easy to see that the sample with Mn-ZnSe has a smaller dark current than the sample without passivation layer. Passivation can restrain the charge recombination near the surface prominently and Mn-doped ZnSe has a better passivation effect than the undoped ZnSe passivation,46 which is completely consistent with the results of EIS as shown in Fig. 7(a).

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to estimate light harvesting efficiency, charge transfer efficiency and charge collection efficiency of the QDSSCs. Fig. 8(b) shows the IPCE curves of devices without and with ZnSe or Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer. It is well known that the short-circuit current Jsc can be integrated from the data of IPCE.47 The IPCE integral Jsc result is also shown in Fig. 8(b). It is obvious that the cell with Mn-ion-doped ZnSe passivation exhibits higher value of IPCE than the cell with undoped ZnSe passivation layer; the same occurs for integrated Jsc values as we expected. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the integrated Jsc values of TiO2/QDs, TiO2/QDs/ZnSe and TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe are 12.31, 16.09 and 17.10 mA cm−2 which are approximately in agreement with the I–V result as shown in Table 3. IPCE of devices can be divided into three parts: light harvesting efficiency ηLHE, charge transfer efficiency ηct and charge collection efficiency ηcc, which is exhibited in the following eqn (4):48 IPCE = ηLHE × ηct × ηcc.(4)

The light harvesting efficiency ηLHE is related to light absorption spectrum and it can be derived from UV-Vis spectrum as in the following eqn (5):49 ηLHE = 1 − 10−absorbance.(5)
Notably, the photoelectrode with Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer has higher light harvesting efficiency than the photoelectrode with ZnSe passivation. The charge transfer efficiency ηct depends on the stepwise band structure between TiO2 particle and QDs. According to theoretical calculation, the co-sensitized system of TiO2/CdS/CdSe has a 200 mV difference of energy gap between TiO2 and CdS/CdSe.50 As driving force, the difference between conduction band edge makes electrons tend to transfer from high conduction band to low conduction band.21 Obviously, Mn ion cannot have an effect on conduction band. As for the charge collection efficiency ηcc, it is mainly determined by charge recombination over the whole QDSSC device. From the results of EIS, Bode plot, dark current curve and OCVD, the conclusion can be drawn that passivation can effectively suppress electron and hole recombination process to facilitate the separation of electrons and holes; what is more, the Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer is more effective than the undoped ZnSe passivation layer in restraining the recombination process. That is because of the rising valence band, which facilitates hole transport from the QDs to the electrolyte, therefore reducing the recombination.20 In brief, it is the improvement of light harvesting efficiency ηLHE and charge collection efficiency ηcc that results in the enhancement of the PCE for the fabricated solar cells.
The J–V curves were measured under simulated sunlight illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with scan interval of 5 mV. The stability of TiO2/QDs/Mn-ZnSe is shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 9 shows the J–V curves of the QDSSCs with different passivation and their specific parameters are listed in Table 3. Specifically, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.34 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V and fill factor (FF) of 57.74% are obtained for the QDSSCs without passivation layer, which lead to a PCE (η) of 4.07%. As shown in Fig. 9, it is apparent that the passivation can improve the performance of the QDSSCs such as Jsc, Voc and FF, as previous literature has reported.20,21 The Voc values are both 0.62 V for the QDSSCs with Mn-doped and undoped ZnSe passivation, because the Voc is mainly determined by the QD materials.51 And Mn doping makes the Jsc of the QDSSCs increase from 16.31 to 17.82 mA cm−2, which is mainly due to the wide range of light absorption and less recombination, so that the PCE of the QDSSCs increased to 6.46% as well.

Conclusions
Introduction of Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer to TiO2/CdS/CdSe QDSSCs has been demonstrated to be an efficient and promising approach to significantly improve the PCE. UV-Vis, EIS, OCVD and IPCE investigations along with the DFT calculation for the TiO2/CdS/CdSe QDSSCs with ZnSe and Mn-doped ZnSe passivation have demonstrated that, compared with the ZnSe passivation layer, the Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer contributed to a rising valance band, and then led to a broadened light absorption edge and a reduced charge recombination for the QDSSCs. Eventually, an overall PCE of 6.46% has been achieved for the TiO2/CdS/CdSe QDSSCs with a Mn-doped ZnSe passivation layer, a 69% enhancement compared to the PCE of 4.07% for the device without a passivation layer. This work can reasonably explain the impacts of the Mn ion in ZnSe passivation for high-performance CdS/CdSe QD solar cells.
