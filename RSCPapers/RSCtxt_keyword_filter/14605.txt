    , Accepted 4th February 2014First published on 25th March 2014AbstractDiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based molecular semiconductors have emerged as promising materials for high performance active layers in organic solar cells. It is imperative to comprehend the origin of such a property by investigating the fundamental structure property correlation. In this report we have investigated the role of the donor group in DPP based donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure to govern the solid state, photophysical and electrochemical properties. We have prepared three derivatives of DPP with varying strengths of the donor groups, such as phenyl (PDPP-Hex), thiophene (TDPP-Hex) and selenophene (SeDPP-Hex). The influence of the donor units on the solid state packing was studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The photophysical, electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) results were combined to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of three DPP derivatives. We found that these DPP derivatives crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c and show herringbone packing in the crystal lattice. The derivatives exhibit weak π–π stacking interactions as two neighboring molecules slip away from each other with varied torsional angles at the donor units. The high torsional angle of 32° (PDPP-Hex) between the phenyl and lactam ring results in weak intramolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor, while TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex show lower torsional angles of 9° and 12° with a strong overlap between the donor and acceptor units. The photophysical properties reveal that PDPP-Hex exhibits a high Stokes shift of 0.32 eV and SeDPP-Hex shows a high molar absorption co-efficient of 33600 L mol−1 cm−1 with a low band gap of ∼2.2 eV. The electrochemical studies of SeDPP-Hex indicate the pronounced effect of selenium in stabilizing the LUMO energy levels and this further emphasizes the importance of chalcogens in developing new n-type organic semiconductors for optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, the performance of optoelectronic devices based on donor–acceptor (D–A) π-conjugated materials has remarkably improved and such materials represent promising candidates for flexible electronic devices.1–4 Recently, tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop low band gap materials based on the concept of the D–A approach.5–7 The materials with the combination of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties exhibit a narrow optical band gap with intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character leading to unique properties, such as efficient light harvesting in the solar spectrum and high charge carrier mobility in organic field effect transistors (OFETs).8–10 It is well established in the literature that the performance of electronic devices strongly depends on the molecular packing of the donor–acceptor, purity and type of electrode.11–13 The donor and acceptor materials have undergone significant diversification over a period of time. Different symmetrical D–A–D or A–D–A, or even more complex combinations such as linear ADADA, DADAD or three-fold symmetry, have led to power conversion efficiencies in the range of 3–6% for organic solar cells.2,3,14–16
In this regard, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit has been extensively used as an acceptor to synthesize D–A based low band gap conjugated polymers and small molecules.17,18 The excellent thermal and photostability, planarity of the chromophore, easier structural modification and ambipolar charge carrier transport make DPP based molecules an ideal choice for optoelectronic device applications.19,20 The careful introduction of electron donating or withdrawing groups on the lactam ring leads to novel low band gap materials by tuning its highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) energy levels which determine the electronic properties and device performance.21,22 Recently, Yang and co-workers have reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% using a DPP based polymer in tandem solar cells.23 Rene Janssen’s group has demonstrated a systematic enhancement of the PCE of organic solar cells up to 9.6% with an increase in the number of DPP based active layers in tandem cell configuration.24 In organic thin film transistors (OTFT), the favorable intermolecular solid state aggregation of the DPP leads to highly efficient organic semiconductors with high charge carrier mobilities exceeding the corresponding value of amorphous silicon.9,25–27 In the recent past, our group has been actively involved in the development and investigation of the structure–property relationship of several DPP based D–A–D small molecules and conjugated polymers.28,29 Recently, we have reported an informative study on the single crystal X-ray analysis of functionalized DPP with varied alkyl and alkoxy chains. The study reveals that DPP derivatives with linear alkyl chains exhibit efficient π–π stacking pattern leading to effective solid state packing.30 In parallel efforts, other leading research groups have developed DPP-based materials with different types of donor groups, such as phenyl, thiophene and furan rings.23,31–37 These heterocyclic rings were covalently linked with the lactam ring at the 3 and 6 positions of the DPP unit to open up the avenue of a multitude of D–A combinations to further optimize the electronic properties.38 It is well documented that the replacement of phenyl with a thiophene unit enhances the co-planarity of the DPP unit for efficient π–π stacking.20 Different types of derivatives with thiophene and thiophene based heterocycles as π-spacers exhibit the most promising D–A structure working in conjunction with the DPP core.18,39,40 Bijleveld and co-workers have reported two different co-polymers varied with thiophene and furan units and revealed that both the materials exhibit similar hole mobilities in OFET.41 The structure-property and device performances of thiophene-based DPP materials have been widely investigated, but the fundamental questions concerning the solid state and photophysical properties remain unanswered for selenophene-based DPP.23,42,43 Since the aromatic resonance energy follows the order phenyl (1.56 eV) > thiophene (1.26 eV) > selenophene (1.25 eV), the enhancement of the donating strength would lead to greater quinoidal character of the donor–acceptor bond, which predicts enhancement of the planarity and effective conjugation length and would reduce the band gap of the organic semiconductors.44 Moreover the beneficial influence of selenium e.g. easier polarisability to accommodate greater charge, strong intermolecular Se⋯Se interaction leading to improved inter chain charge transfer, and lower ionization potential conducive to reducing the band gap.45,46 In the Se⋯Se interaction, the lone pair in an occupied ‘p’ orbital of the selenium atom interacts with the empty Se–C σ* orbital of neighbouring selenium, together with induction and dispersion forces.47 Introducing selenophene as a donor in DPP based architectures and comparing its molecular arrangements with other donors would be interesting to study the fundamental structure–property correlation. Motivated by these questions, we have synthesized three DPP based small molecules with different donor groups such as phenyl, thiophene and selenophene in a D–A–D architecture. This study is directed towards the understanding of the effect of the donor unit on the solid state packing arrangements and its influence on the photophysical and electrochemical properties. The bigger size of selenium (van der Waal radius, r = 1.9 Å), higher polarisability (3.8 Å3) and lower ionization potential (9.75 eV) compared to sulfur (10.36 eV) renders the overall system worthy of investigation with respect to its solid state packing and photophysical properties.
2. Experimental section
Materials

t-BuOK was received from Sigma-Aldrich. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl formamide (DMF), hexane, and ethyl acetate of analytical grade were purchased from S.D. fine chemicals. Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and 1-bromohexane were supplied by Spectrochem. All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
2.1 Synthesis
The derivatives of DPP (PDPP-Hex, TDPP-Hex, and SeDPP-Hex) were synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature.35,36,48N-alkylation was carried out as shown in Scheme 1. After the alkylation, the final products were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, elemental analysis and ESI-MS spectroscopy. The detailed synthetic protocol and characterization is given in the ESI.†

2.2 Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz frequency. CDCl3 and TMS were used as the solvent and internal standard, respectively. Elemental analysis of the DPP molecules was carried out in a Thermo Finningan Flash EA 1112 CHNS analyzer. Mass analysis was performed in a Thermo LCQ Deca XP MAX instrument by the electrospray ionization technique. The optical absorption spectra of three DPP molecules were recorded in toluene with a Perkin-Elmer (Lambda 35) spectrometer at room temperature. Steady state emission spectra of the DPP derivatives were monitored in a Horiba JobinYvon Fluorolog3 fluorometer and quantum yields were determined using an integrated sphere. Time resolved fluorescence decay measurements were carried out with the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were taken in a Zeol field emission microscope at 200 kV at room temperature. The structural properties of the vacuum sublimed thin films of DPP derivatives were investigated by a Philips X-pert diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out in a Mettler Toledo DSC1 STARe system (chiller cooled) with a N2 flow of 40 mL min−1 with an empty Al pan taken as standard. All samples were heated with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Redox properties of the three DPP derivatives were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry experiment (CH electrochemical analyzer). Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, whereas Pt was employed as both the working and counter electrodes. Dry chloroform and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate were used as the solvent and supporting electrolyte. A ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was used as the standard electrochemical reference. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO and the corresponding band gap were calculated from the oxidation and reduction potential. The position of the HOMO and LUMO were computed from eqn (1) and the band gap was determined from the difference between them. HOMO = −(Eox + 4.5) eV; LUMO = −(Ered + 4.5) eV(1)
2.3 Single crystal X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data sets were collected on an Oxford Xcalibur (Mova) diffractometer equipped with an EOS CCD detector using MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The crystals were maintained at 110 K during data collection using the cryojet-HT controller. All of the structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and refined against F2 using SHELXL-97. The H atoms were located geometrically and refined isotropically. The WinGX package was used for refinement and production of the data tables and ORTEP-3 for structure visualization and making the molecular representations. Analysis of the H-bond and π⋯π interactions were carried out using PLATON for all of the structures. The packing diagrams were generated using MERCURY.
3. Results and discussion
The DPP derivatives with different donor units at the 3 and 6 positions were prepared by using aryl or hetero-aryl carbonitrile (Ar–CN) and succinic acid ester as shown in Scheme 1. PDPP was prepared according to the established synthetic methodology.48 The presence of phenyl rings at the 3 and 6 positions on the DPP core enhances the repulsive interactions with the adjacent lactam ring, resulting in a twisted molecular geometry.49 However, this twisted geometry can be alleviated by introducing five membered heterocyclic units on DPP to attain a highly co-planar molecular backbone for efficient π–π stacking. To compare the molecular arrangements and rationalize the photophysical properties we have prepared DPP derivatives with thiophene and selenophene units. TDPP was synthesized as reported in the literature, whereas selenophene-2-carbonitrile was prepared by a one pot synthesis as described by Lohaus.50 Reaction of selenophene-2-carbonitrile with diethyl succinate in the presence of sodium afforded the selenophene substituted DPP. The obtained DPP derivatives were deep red in color with low solubility due to the very strong intermolecular interactions between the N–H and CO groups. In order to ensure good solubility of the resultant DPP derivatives, alkyl chains were introduced on the nitrogen atoms of the DPP unit with 1-bromohexane in the presence of NMP and DMF (2:1 ratio) for PDPP-Hex and in DMF for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex at 125 °C to obtain the desired final products with a good yield. The obtained three DPP derivatives were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR and ESI-MS spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†).
3.1 Photophysical properties
All three DPP molecules exhibit dual band absorption spectra, which is a characteristic feature of the D–A–D based derivatives.6 The high energy band corresponds to the π → π* transition, whereas the origin of the low energy band is due to the intramolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor moiety. We observed notable features in the absorption spectra (Fig. 1a) of these derivatives. Firstly, we observed a gradual bathochromic shift of both π → π* and the low energy band on going from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex, indicating the decrease in band gap with the inclusion of thiophene and selenophene as donor groups. The lowest optical band gap was observed for SeDPP-Hex in comparison with other derivatives. The decrease in the band gap in SeDPP-Hex can be rationalized by correlating the effect of selenium in lowering the LUMO energy level.51 Moreover, a decrease in aromaticity52 and an increase in quinoidal character in the selenophene derivative also influences the decrease in the band-gap, as reported by Bendikov and co-workers.46 Secondly, TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex clearly exhibit a vibronic feature in the visible region representative of a low energy transition. However, this feature was not observed for PDPP-Hex. The absorption maxima of the low energy band appeared at ∼470 nm for PDPP-Hex, but dual peaks were observed at ∼510 nm, ∼550 nm for TDPP-Hex and ∼525 nm, ∼562 nm for SeDPP-Hex.
 Fig. 1  Absorption (a) and the emission spectra (b) of the three DPP molecules in toluene. Absorption and emission spectra of TDPP-Hex are adapted from ref. 30 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
To understand the variation in the spectral behavior, a concentration dependent study was carried out on TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex in toluene. Upon decreasing the concentration of the DPP derivatives from 27 × 10−6 to 7 × 10−7 M, both TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex exhibit dual band vibronic features, which rules out any aggregation in solution (Fig. S7, ESI†). However, de-convolution of the low energy band of PDPP-Hex indicates that this band was also composed of two bands with peak maxima at ∼460 nm and ∼488 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). Nevertheless, the molar absorption coefficient steadily increases on moving from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex. This trend suggests that orbital overlap between the donor and acceptor group improves due to integration of the chalcogen atom in the donor unit. Due to the lesser electronegativity of selenium (2.55) as compared to sulfur (2.58) and lower aromaticity of selenophene than the thiophene, the selenophene ring acts as a stronger donor group in comparison with thiophene,52 leading to the higher stabilization of the excited state. In addition, the contribution of the ‘d’ orbitals in the charge delocalization is anticipated to be higher in the case of selenium, as compared to sulfur, due to the bigger and more diffused ‘d’ orbital of selenium. This clearly supports the highest absorption coefficient for SeDPP-Hex among the three DPP derivatives.
The emission spectra (Fig. 1b) of the three DPP derivatives have a close resemblance in their spectral appearance with complementary dual band features. The compound PDPP-Hex also exhibits the dual band emission, but was found to be less eminent in comparison with TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex. Similar to the absorption spectra, the fluorescence spectra also showed a bathochromic shift from PDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex with an emission maxima at ∼535 nm, ∼560 nm and ∼580 nm for PDPP-Hex, TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex, respectively. The least Stokes shift was observed for TDPP-Hex (0.04 eV) and the highest was obtained for PDPP-Hex (0.32 eV). The pertinent data of the Stokes shift is summarized in Table 1. The observed lesser Stokes shift for TDPP-Hex implies that maximum rigidity is attained in the molecular backbone. Fluorescence quantum yield measurements reveal that PDPP-Hex exhibited a high photo-luminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 85%, while TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex showed 79% and 66% respectively (Fig. 2b). The gradual decrease of fluorescence quantum yield can be attributed to the heavy atom effect of sulfur and selenium which facilitates the inter-system crossing rates.53 The fluorescence lifetime (τF) for PDPP-Hex and TDPP-Hex exhibits a mono exponential decay pattern, while SeDPP-Hex follows a bi-exponential decay profile, as shown in Fig. 2a. The lifetime systematically decreases from PDPP-Hex (∼6.8 ns) to SeDPP-Hex (∼5.5 ns, together with a species of 1.2 ns having an amplitude of 14%) with the intermediate lifetime for TDPP-Hex (∼6.2 ns).

3.2 DFT and TD-DFT calculations
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the optimized geometry of the ground state, electron density distribution and the energy associated with the frontier molecular orbitals. The B3LYP function with a 6-31g* basis set was employed for the geometry optimization and time dependent density functional (TD-DFT) calculations in the Gaussian 03 suite programme. The optimized geometries and electron density distribution in the HOMO and LUMO of the three DPP derivatives are shown in Fig. 3. The optimized geometry of TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex exhibit trans-orientation of the heterocycle with respect to each other. The donor and the acceptor groups lie in the same plane with small variations in torsional angle (∼1° and ∼2° for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex respectively), which improves the ‘p’ orbitals overlap over the molecular backbone. But PDPP-Hex exhibits a high torsional angle (∼36°) between the lactam and phenyl ring which results in poorer overlap of the ‘p’ orbitals reflecting in the electron distribution in its frontier orbitals.
 Fig. 3  Energy minimized ground state geometry and corresponding electron density distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals of three DPP derivatives. 
In the HOMO, the electron density over the phenyl ring is almost negligible and mainly localized over the lactam ring indicating weak electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor groups. However, the LUMO is evenly distributed over the donor, as well as on the acceptor moieties. The distribution of electron density appears to be different with the substitution of thiophene/selenophene as a donor in place of phenyl. The planarity of the donor and acceptor moieties improves the delocalization of wave-function and we observe uniform distribution of the electron density in the HOMO, as well as in the LUMO for both TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex. The inter ring (in between the donor and acceptor group) C–C bond length also decreases with decrease in aromatic resonance energy of the donor moiety. The C–C bond length varies in the order, PDPP-Hex (1.46 Å) > TDPP-Hex (1.44 Å) > SeDPP-Hex (1.43 Å) implying the gradual increase in quinoidal character of the C–C bond from PDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex. The optimized geometries and electron density distribution in the HOMO and LUMO along with the energies are shown in Fig. 3.

PDPP-Hex showed the lowest lying HOMO energy level (−5.13 eV), whereas the other two derivatives containing chalcogen atoms increase the HOMO energy due to the strong electron donating strength. On the other hand, the LUMO energy is decreased with the inclusion of the chalcogen atom in DPP derivatives. This data suggests that the lower ionization potential of selenium than sulfur causes the shift in LUMO energy.51 The HOMO-LUMO gap was found to decrease in the order of PDPP-Hex (2.85 eV) > TDPP-Hex (2.44 eV) > SeDPP-Hex (2.40 eV).
TD-DFT calculations were also performed to ascertain the orbitals involved in the dominant excited state electronic transitions and their corresponding energies and oscillator strength have been summarized in Table 2. For all three DPP molecules, the low energy band constitutes the transition from HOMO → LUMO. From Table 2, we can see that the oscillator strength gradually increases from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex due to the enhancement in electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor moieties, corroborating our findings from optical spectroscopy. By changing the donor moiety from phenyl to thiophene to selenophene, the low energy transition shifts from ∼457 nm to ∼517 nm to ∼527 nm. The simulated absorption spectra of these three DPP molecules (Fig. S6, ESI†) follow the same trend as was observed in the experimental results. The molar absorption coefficient increases with a gradual bathochromic shift as we move from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex. The variations in the absorption maxima between the theoretical calculations and experimental observations can be attributed to different parameters e.g. the influence of bulk state and solvent molecules which are not accounted for by the TD-DFT calculations.

3.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the three derivatives were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4. All the DPP derivatives (PDPP-Hex, TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex) exhibit low lying HOMO energy levels and among them PDPP-Hex demonstrated the lowest HOMO energy level, calculated from its peak position of oxidation potential. PDPP-Hex exhibits an irreversible oxidation and reduction peak, while for the other two derivatives the oxidation and reduction are quasi-reversible in nature. This indicates the influence of heteroatoms (sulfur and selenium) on the DPP derivatives to stabilize the radical cation and/or radical anion during redox reaction. The HOMO and LUMO energy values are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO energies calculated from the reduction potential clearly indicate that incorporation of selenium in DPP has a pronounced effect in reducing the LUMO energy level. The difference between the LUMO energy levels of TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex is more pronounced than the value obtained from DFT calculations. The observation of the low lying LUMO energy of SeDPP-Hex has great importance in developing new stable n-type materials. This effect was further supported by the recent observation of the n-type character for polymers incorporated with selenium in the molecular backbone.54 The LUMO of PDPP-Hex was found to be of similar energy as TDPP-Hex. The band gap calculated from electrochemical measurements was found to be similar to the optical band gap.

3.4 Crystal structure and molecular arrangement
Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed to investigate the crystal structure, molecular interactions and solid state packing. Single crystals of all three DPP molecules were grown from a hexane–acetone (6:4) solvent combination by a slow evaporation method. The compounds PDPP-Hex and TDPP-Hex form sharp and long needle-like crystals, while SeDPP-Hex forms tiny crystals. The three derivatives crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c with z = 2. Fig. 5 shows the molecular arrangements of the DPP derivatives along a tilted c-axis. It can be seen that all three DPP derivatives were arranged in a herringbone fashion. Like TDPP-Hex, SeDPP-Hex also exhibits a weak π–π stacking interaction as two neighboring molecules slip away from each other.
 Fig. 5  Molecular arrangements of three DPP derivatives varied with different donor units. The packing diagram of TDPP-Hex has been adapted from ref. 30 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
The π–π stacking distances of ∼5.39 Å and ∼5.52 Å were obtained between two heterocyclic rings for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex, respectively. Due to such slipped stacking, the heterocycle e.g. thiophene or selenophene overlaps with the lactam ring of the nearby molecule, as shown in Fig. 6. A similar kind of intermolecular interaction between an electron rich donor and electron deficient acceptor unit has been observed in other D–A systems.55 As a result, the distance between the lactam ring of the DPP core and a nearby heterocycle appeared to be shorter and the measured π–π stacking distances were found to be 3.61 Å for both molecules. On the other hand, the distance between the nitrogen atom of the lactam ring and the corresponding chalcogen atom was found to be 3.89 Å and 3.98 Å for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex, respectively. However, the Se⋯O bond distance (4.14 Å) was shorter than the S⋯O bond distance (4.21 Å) although the van der Waals radius of selenium (1.90 Å) is larger than that of the sulfur atom (1.80 Å). As observed in the theoretical calculations, the non-bonding interaction between N and S, involving ‘d’ orbitals of sulfur can operate even at the distance of 3.8 Å.56 Based on these observations, we speculate that very weak non-bonding interactions are operational for both TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex in the crystal lattice and the amplitude of such an interaction is anticipated to be higher in the case of Se⋯N in comparison with S⋯N. In addition to the π–π interaction, we also observed the presence of a C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interaction between the CO of the lactam ring and the C–H of the heterocycle with bond lengths of 2.71 Å and 2.67 Å for thiophene and selenophene analogues, respectively. Furthermore, the torsional angle between the donor (selenophene and thiophene) and acceptor (lactam) ring in SeDPP-Hex increases marginally to 12° in comparison with TDPP-Hex (9°) (Fig. S8, ESI†). Since the planarity between the donor and acceptor unit remained almost the same for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex, the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor moiety does not change significantly to influence the charge delocalization over the molecular backbone. In contrast, PDPP-Hex exhibits quite a different packing arrangement in the crystal lattice and the packing pattern resembles an orthorhombic system with small deviation from the ideal orthogonality of the unit cell α = γ = 90°, β = 90.06°. The PDPP-Hex molecule also exhibits a slipped weak π–π interaction with a distance of 5.54 Å between the two phenyl rings. The high torsional angle of 33° (Fig. S8, ESI†) between the phenyl and lactam ring limits the orbital overlap among the donor and acceptor units resulting in poor intramolecular interactions. The large torsional angle originates from the steric repulsion between the ortho hydrogen atom of the phenyl ring and the nearby hydrogen atom of the alkyl chain placed on the nitrogen atom of the lactam unit. The detrimental effect of the torsional angle renders the lower absorption co-efficient in PDPP-Hex as compared to other derivatives. The variations in inter-ring C–C as well as C–N bond length for the three DPP based molecules are listed in Table S1, ESI.† Significant C–X (X = S or Se) bond length alteration was found between the two chalcogen analogues. It is observed that the bond length increases with the incorporation of selenium in place of sulfur due to the bigger atomic size of selenium (van der Waals radius, r = 1.9 Å) in comparison with sulfur (r = 1.8 Å).

3.4 Thin film X-ray analysis and microscopy
Thin films of all three DPP derivatives were fabricated on silicon substrates by the sublimation technique. The high crystallinity of these materials is reflected in their X-ray diffraction pattern. Fig. 7 shows thin film X-ray diffractograms of these three DPP based derivatives. Only a few selected diffraction peaks appeared in the diffractogram indicating the presence of highly oriented crystallites. Except TDPP-Hex, the other two molecules showed four peaks within 2θ = 3–30°. The diffraction peaks with their corresponding ‘d’ values of these three molecules are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 7, the ‘d’ spacing of (100) gradually increases from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex. The nature of packing pattern for TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex was quite similar to the simulated X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the single crystal diffraction study. The enhancement in ‘d’ spacing can be attributed to the bigger size of selenium as compared to the size of sulfur. The ‘d’ spacing of 3.6 Å matches well with the π–π stacking distance, observed in the single crystal X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 6).

Furthermore, the self-assembly formation was investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The dilute solutions of DPP derivatives in toluene were drop casted on a carbon coated copper grid and observed under TEM. It was found that they aggregated without any proper structural features. But the aggregates were found to be highly polycrystalline in nature. The aggregation phenomenon of these DPP based molecules was governed by the nature of the substrates which influence the self-assembly of the molecules. From HRTEM, we were able to measure the ‘d’ spacing for these three molecules. For PDPP-Hex, we observe the diffraction pattern with varying ‘d’ values (Fig. 8). On the other hand, TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex exhibit two distinct ‘d’ spacings and the values are summarized in Table S2, ESI.† For PDPP-Hex the ‘d’ spacing of 10.4 Å was predominant as compared to the other ‘d’ values. The calculated ‘d’ spacings were very close to the distances between S⋯S and Se⋯Se in TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-Hex, as observed in single crystal diffraction data (Fig. S9, ESI†).

3.5 Thermal properties
The thermal transitions and enthalpies of the DPP based derivatives were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All three DPP derivatives exhibit single reversible melting and crystallization peaks during the heating and cooling processes. Among the three molecules, TDPP-Hex demonstrated the highest (174 °C) and PDPP-Hex showed the lowest (134 °C) melting temperature and SeDPP-Hex exhibits a melting temperature of 140 °C (Fig. 9). From the DSC experiments, we observe that the thermal hysteresis gradually diminishes as we move from PDPP-Hex to TDPP-Hex to SeDPP-Hex. This implies the disorder to order transition in SeDPP-Hex to be enthalpically more favorable as compared to the other two DPP derivatives. We apprehend that due to incorporation of the heavier atom (Se) in the molecular architecture, the melting point decreases because of higher thermal motion as a result of size restrain, but the higher polarisability of selenium atom assists to reorganize the molecules to crystallize with the least thermal hysteresis.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the present results highlight the importance of the donor group in determining the solid state and photophysical properties of DPP. The influence of the donor unit on the solid state packing arrangement of DPP was studied by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The detrimental effect of the torsional angle in PDPP-Hex due to steric repulsion between the ortho hydrogen atom of the phenyl ring and the nearby hydrogen atom of the alkyl chain renders a weak intramolecular interaction. The presence of a slipped stacking interaction in TDPP-Hex and SeDPP-hex stabilizes the efficient π–π overlap of the donor (thiophene and selenophene) to acceptor DPP unit. The significant C–X (X = S, Se) bond alterations and variation in Se⋯O and S⋯O distances indicate SeDPP-Hex has efficient diffusion with high polarizability. Variation in the donor groups strongly influences the optical band gap and molar absorption co-efficient. The electrochemical study reveals that the presence of the chalcogen atom stabilizes the formation of radical ions during the redox processes. Incorporation of selenium in the molecular architecture exhibits a pronounced effect in stabilizing the LUMO energy levels. This report provides insight into the role of chalcogen and the torsional angle in determining the solid state and photophysical properties of DPP derivatives. Such apprehension will have an important contribution to the development of new n-type materials for optoelectronic devices.
