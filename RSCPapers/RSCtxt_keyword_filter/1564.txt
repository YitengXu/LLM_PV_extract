Introduction
Semiconducting polymers exhibit many advantages, such as flexibility, solution processability, low cost and light weight, over conventional inorganic semiconductors.1–3 They are promising materials for high-throughput manufacturing of emerging wearable and flexible electronic products. Significant effort has been made in the search for high-performance semiconducting polymers in the past decade.4–6 One of the effective approaches for designing high-performance semiconductor polymers is constructing a highly planar polymer backbone with extended π-electron delocalization, thus reducing the energy band gap and facilitating inter-chain π–π interactions. The early strategy used covalent bonds to connect adjacent aromatic rings for eliminating the rotation of single bonds between them.7 Recently, noncovalent intramolecular interactions were employed to increase the torsional barrier, thereby enhancing coplanarity.8–11 The binding energies of the noncovalent interactions such as S⋯X and C–H⋯X (X = O, N, F) are usually small (in the range of 0.44–2.20 kcal mol−1).7 However, their existence significantly improves the semiconducting properties of many conjugated polymers.11–13 Hydrogen bonding is an important noncovalent interaction that plays crucial roles in diverse areas, such as supramolecular chemistry, biochemical processes, and crystal engineering.14–19 H-bonds are usually classified as strong (>15 kcal mol−1), moderately strong (4–15 kcal mol−1), and weak (<4 kcal mol−1) in terms of stabilization energy.20 Strong H-bonds are often resonance-assisted H-bonds, or π-cooperative H-bonds, where a hydrogen donor and an acceptor are connected by a π-conjugated system of alternating single and double bonds (Fig. 1).21,22
 Fig. 1  Carboxamide and carbamate substituted conjugated polymers. 
The interaction between a H-bond and a π-conjugated system can significantly enhance the H-bond itself because of the extra stabilization associated with the delocalization of the π-electrons through the entire conjugated system.23–25 Meanwhile, the quasi-ring formed by the hydrogen bridge can partly act as an aromatic ring to form dynamic ring-fused structures. This usually leads to a stable conformation in heterocyclic systems. Recently, the importance of including RAHBs and other intramolecular hydrogen bonds in design strategies for semiconducting polymers has been demonstrated.13,26,27 The intra-molecular H-bonds between carbamate hydrogens and nitrogen containing heteroaromatics can significantly improve the coplanarity and effective π-conjugation in polymers. In order to further understand the influence of H-bonds on π-conjugated polymers, we herein present new building blocks, namely thiophene–pyrazine–thiophene with carboxamide or carbamate substituents. Both carboxamide and carbamate groups have protons that can form H-bonds with lone pair electrons of heteroatoms. The carboxamide substituted building block formed intermolecular H-bonds. It showed a twisted conformation and a classical herringbone packing in a single crystal. The carbamate substituted building block formed intramolecular RAHBs. It displayed a co-planar structure, an extended π-conjugation and a tight lamellar structure in a single crystal. Polymers based on these two building blocks were also synthesized. The hydrogen bonding caused significant differences in the optical, redox, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. Solar cells based on the polymers as electron donors and Y6 as the acceptor were studied. The devices based on PC-BDT2 which had intramolecular hydrogen bonds showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.9%, while the devices based on PI-BDT which possessed intermolecular hydrogen bonds gave a PCE of 0.1%.
Experimental section
Instrumentation

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference at ambient temperature. Elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar Vario EL Cube at the Instrumental Analysis Center of SJTU. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was performed on a Primer UPLC-Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a Bruker Autoflex. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 VENTURE X-ray diffractometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses of the polymers were carried out on a Waters HPLC with a polystyrene gel column (Agilent PL gel 5 μm, MIXEDC) at room temperature. A polystyrene standard kit was used for calibration, and chloroform was used as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) were conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out on a Netzsch Instruments DSC 204 F1 at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The sample was heated to 260 °C and was held for 2 min to remove the thermal history, followed by cooling to 20 °C and then heating to 260 °C. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the polymer thin-films were obtained using a Bruker JPK atomic force microscope. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on an ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system equipped with a SCIENTA R3000 spectrometer with a base pressure of 10−10 mbar. The UPS employed the He I (21.22 eV) as the ionization source with an energy resolution of 50 meV. The work function (WF) and valence band maximum were derived from the secondary electron cutoff and the frontier edge of the occupied density of states to the vacuum level, respectively.
Organic photovoltaic device fabrication and measurement
The organic photovoltaic (OPV) device structure was ITO/ZnO/polymer:Y6/MoO3/Ag. A layer of zinc oxide (30 nm) was deposited by spin-coating precursors (zinc acetate and ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol) on pre-cleaned ITO substrates and was annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air. After deposition, the substrate was transferred to a glove box filled with nitrogen, and the active layers were formed by spin-coating a mixture of PI-BDT1:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) in chloroform at different spin-speeds, and the concentration of PI-BDT1 was 10 mg mL−1 with 1-chloronaphthalene (0.5 vol%) as an additive. PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 based devices were fabricated in a similar manner. The blend of PC-BDT1:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) in chloroform (the concentration of PC-BDT1 was 10 mg mL−1 with 0.5 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene as an additive) and the blend of PC-BDT2:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) in chloroform (the concentration of PC-BDT2 was 10 mg mL−1 with 0.5 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene as an additive) were utilized. The thicknesses of the active layers were measured by surface profilometry and ellipsometry. Finally, MoO3 (15 nm)/Ag (100 nm) layers were deposited by vacuum evaporation at a base pressure of 2 × 10−7 Torr on the active layer. The effective device area was 2.0 mm2 defined using shadow masks. The J–V characteristics were measured in air with a Keithley 4200 source meter controlled using the LabVIEW program in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photodetector (Newport 818-UV). The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cells were measured on a system using a 150 W xenon lamp fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.
Space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurement
A hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (60 nm)/active layer/MoO3/Ag and an electron-only device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN–Br (50 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were studied. The J–V characteristics of the devices were recorded with a Keithley 4200 source meter. The measurements were carried out under dark conditions. The hole mobility and electron mobility of the active layers were obtained by fitting the quadratic SCLC region using the following equation:  where μ is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity, γ is a constant and d represents the thickness of the film. The effective voltage was determined by subtracting the voltage drop (Vs) and the built-in voltage (Vbi) from the applied voltage (Vappl).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The syntheses of monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Ethyl 2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-thiophene-3-carboxylate (1) was prepared according to literature methods.28 2,2′-(Pyrazine-2,5-diyl)-bis(thiophene-3-carboxylate) (2) was synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction of 1 and 2,5-dibromopyrazine. Ester 2 was hydrolyzed to give 2,2′-(pyrazine-2,5-diyl)-bis(thiophene-3-carboxylic acid) (3). Carboxamide (4) was synthesized by an amidation reaction with 2-octyldodecan-1-amine.29 Carbamate (5) was synthesized by one-pot reactions of acyl azide formation and Curtius rearrangement in 2-octyldodecan-1-ol. 4 and 5 were brominated to give 6 and 7, respectively. Compounds 5a and 4a with the ethylhexyl side chain instead of the 2-octyldodecyl side chain were prepared in a similar manner for the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. Two known BDT-type monomers were chosen to copolymerize with the new monomers. The polymers were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reactions. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 were 45.5, 131.9 and 22.6 kDa, and the polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 were 2.8, 2.2 and 2.6, respectively.

Crystal structures and molecular packing
The single crystals of 4a (CCDC-2034735†) and 5a (CCDC-2032846†) were grown from their chloroform solutions in ambient air by the solvent-evaporation method. The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 2, 3 and S22† and the crystal data are listed in Tables S1 and S2.†4a and 5a have the same thiophene–pyrazine–thiophene π-conjugated core but with different substituents at the 3 and 3′ positions of thiophenes. Both 4a and 5a exhibited centrosymmetric structures. While 4a had two conformational isomers, 5a showed only one conformation in the crystal structure (Fig. S22†). 4a and 5a showed dihedral angles of 13.7° and 3.7° between the thiophene plane and the pyrazine plane, respectively (Fig. 2); therefore, the structure of 5a was less twisted than that of 4a. In the structure of 5a, the distances of N1⋯N2, H1⋯N1 and N2–H1 were 2.7 Å, 2.1 Å and 0.8 Å, respectively. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H1⋯N1) between carbamate hydrogens and imine nitrogens of the pyrazines were formed in 5a and the hydrogen bond lengths were 2.1 Å. The hydrogen donor and acceptor in 5a were connected by a conjugated system (H1–N2–C2C1–C5N1). The H-bonds were typical medium-strength resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) with bond length in the range of 1.5–2.2 Å. The evidence for the RAHB formation was also provided by 1H NMR spectra. The chemical shifts of the carboxamide proton in 4a showed up at 9.0 ppm, and the carbamate proton in 5a showed up at 10.5 ppm. The RAHBs caused the carbamate proton signal to move downfield. The bond lengths of C–C single bonds which linked the thienyl and pyrazinyl units in 4a and 5a were 1.47 Å and 1.46 Å, respectively. The shortening of the single bond suggested that the RAHB formation enhanced π-conjugation in 5a. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds in 5a formed a six-membered quasi aromatic ring which locked the conformation into coplanarity, therefore, facilitating π-electron delocalization and reduced bond length alternation.20 The intermolecular arrangements in the single crystals of 4a and 5a were different (Fig. 3). 4a adopted a classical herringbone packing in a single crystal, wherein intermolecular hydrogen bonds were formed between amide groups of two adjacent molecules, and these intermolecular hydrogen bonds led to poor solubility of 4a. However, the 5a single crystal showed a lamellar packing with an increase in the intermolecular overlapping of π orbitals. The inter-planar π–π stacking distances were 3.43 Å for 4a and 3.29 Å for 5a. The compact stacking of 5a in the solid state was the result of the strong π–π interaction between the highly polarizable, hydrogen bonded quasi aromatic rings and the hetero-aromatic rings in adjacent molecules.13,27,30,31

Thermal properties
The thermal stabilities of polymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs). The decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 were 316, 274 and 275 °C, respectively (Fig. S23†). The carboxamide substituted polymer showed higher thermal stability than carbamate substituted polymers. The thermal stabilities of these polymers were adequate for organic semiconducting device applications. Polymers PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 did not display noticeable glass transition in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S24†).
Optical properties and ionization energy of the polymers
The optical band gaps of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 were 2.01, 1.91 and 1.88 eV, respectively, which were estimated according to their onset absorptions in thin-film spectra (Fig. 4a). The onset absorption of the PC-BDT1 thin-film was significantly red-shifted about 31 nm in comparison with that of PI-BDT1. The absorption spectra of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 in dilute solutions are shown in Fig. 4b–d, and the results are summarized in Table 1. All three polymer solutions showed broad absorption in the visible region. The absorption maxima of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 were at 556, 587 and 596 nm with molar extinction coefficients of 3.9 × 104, 1.1 × 105 and 1.5 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 25 °C. In the variable temperature absorption spectra, when the temperature rose from 25 °C to 95 °C, the long wavelength peaks or shoulders gradually decreased and eventually disappeared. These phenomena suggested that the polymer chains strongly aggregated in solution at room temperature. When the polymers were solvated at higher temperatures, the aggregation decreased.

Ultraviolet photon spectroscopy (UPS) was used to study the electronic structures of the polymers.32,33 The UPS spectra are shown in Fig. S25† and the data are summarized in Table 1. The ionization energy (IE) levels were 5.38, 5.32, and 5.33 eV for PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2, respectively (Table 1). The LUMO levels of the polymers were calculated from ELUMO = IEUPS − Eoptg, and they were 3.38, 3.41 and 3.45 eV for PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2, respectively.

The PI-BDT1:Y6 device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.1%, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.62 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.5 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 23.4%. The device based on PC-BDT1:Y6 showed a PCE of 5.2%, an Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 12.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48.9%. The device based on PC-BDT2:Y6 gave a PCE of 7.9%, an Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.3%. The results have demonstrated that the devices based on the carboxamide and the carbamate substituted polymers have very different photovoltaic performances. Hydrogen bonds in the conjugated polymers significantly affected their semiconducting properties. The hole and electron mobilities of the donor–acceptor blend were measured by a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S26†). The hole mobility/electron mobility values of PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 blends were 1.5 × 10−5/5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.5 × 10−5/3.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.3 × 10−5/4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 showed μh/μe ratios of 0.3, 1.7 and 1.0. High and balanced carrier mobility is important for reducing charge recombination and avoiding the formation of space charge.34,35
The Jsc and Voc as functions of light intensity (Plight) were studied to gain some insight into the charge transport and recombination behavior of the blend films (Fig. S27a and b†). The light intensity (Plight) dependent Jsc and Voc of solar cells are described using the following formulas:Jsc ∝ Plightα,Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight)where the exponential factor α represents the degree of bimolecular recombination. The closer to 1, the less the bimolecular recombination in the active layer. The α values were 0.79, 0.84 and 0.98 for PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2, respectively. This indicated that bimolecular recombination was more likely to occur in PI-BDT1 based devices than in the other two polymer-based devices. Bimolecular recombination was dominant when the slope was close to kT/q, while trap-assisted recombination or geminate recombination was dominant when the slope was close to 2kT/q. The slopes of Vocversus ln(Plight) were 1.68, 1.44 and 1.32kT/q for PI-BDT1, PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2 based devices, respectively. The result implied that geminate recombination more likely occurred in PI-BDT1 based devices than in the other two polymer-based devices. A significantly low Jsc of PI-BDT1 based devices may be caused by unbalanced hole and electron mobility, possible charge recombination and blue-shifted absorption.
Microstructure characterization
The surface morphologies of PI-BDT1:Y6, PC-BDT1:Y6 and PC-BDT2:Y6 thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images of the thin films are displayed in Fig. 6. The PC-BDT2:Y6 thin-film displayed larger crystalline grains and less grain boundary than the PI-BDT1:Y6 and PC-BDT1:Y6 thin-films. The morphologies of the PC-BDT2:Y6 thin-film may also be beneficial for its solar cell performances.

A two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) analysis was performed to investigate the microstructure of the three blend films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding 1D out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) scattering profiles are summarized in Fig. S28 (ESI†). The PC-BDT2 and PC-BDT1 blend films adopted a face-on orientation with apparent (010) diffraction peaks at q = 1.78 and 1.72 Å−1 in the OOP direction, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances of 3.53 and 3.65 Å, respectively. However, the PI-BDT1 blend film did not show a clear (010) diffraction peak. These results suggested that the polymers with carbamate side chains endowed the blend films with a tight interchain packing in comparison to the polymer with carboxamide side chains. This tight interchain packing could facilitate charge transport and account for the improved Jsc and FF in PC-BDT1 and PC-BDT2-based solar cells.
Conclusion
In summary, thiophene–pyrazine–thiophene building blocks with carboxamide or carbamate substituents were synthesized and their crystal structures were compared. The carboxamide substituted building block formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds. It showed a twisted conformation and a herringbone packing in a single crystal. The carbamate substituted building block formed intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) and the hydrogen bonds enabled a co-planar structure, an extended π-conjugation, and a tight lamellar arrangement in a single crystal. The π-conjugated polymers based on the two building blocks were also synthesized. The solar cells based on the polymers as electron donors and Y6 as the acceptor were studied. The devices based on PC-BDT2 which had intramolecular hydrogen bonds showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.9%. In contrast, the devices based on PI-BDT which possessed intermolecular hydrogen bonds gave a PCE of 0.1%. Our investigations demonstrated that the RAHBs caused significant differences in the optical, redox, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. The RAHBs are dynamic, directional, and relatively strong intramolecular interactions. The synergistic effect between hydrogen bonding and π-conjugation can be used for designing semiconducting polymers with improved device performances.
