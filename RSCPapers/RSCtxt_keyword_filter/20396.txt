    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 15th June 2022AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite solar cells have attracted the interest of researchers all over the world owing to their high thermal stability in contrast to their organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts. Among the family of inorganic light absorbers, mixed halide perovskites CsPbI3−xBrx play an important role due to the tunability of their optoelectronic properties, e.g., for application in tandem solar cells. However, such light-absorbing materials are unstable under illumination due to their light-induced segregation to Br-rich and I-rich phases, which negatively affects the long-term stability of solar cells and represents a major challenge for the practical application of these materials. Herein, we show that photoinduced aging of a widely used perovskite light absorber such as CsPbI2Br can be suppressed significantly by using D,L-asparagine (Asn) as a stabilizing agent. By applying a few complementary methods including s-SNOM microscopy, we reveal that the Asn additive distributed along the grain boundaries or on the surface leads to the passivation of defects in the absorber material. The introduction of 0.5% Asn into the CsPbI2Br film leads to improved crystallinity of the CsPbI2Br film and results in a light power conversion efficiency of 12.1%, whereas the reference devices showed 11.6% efficiency. Increasing the concentration to 2% resulted in a slight decrease in the PCE. However, CsPbI2Br films loaded with 2% Asn do not undergo any phase segregation and no degradation occurs upon continuous exposure to light with a power of 100 mW cm−2 for 2000 h. In addition, the perovskite solar cells based on 2% Asn–CsPbI2Br delivered a light power conversion efficiency of 9.1% and retained ∼70% of the initial efficiency after 1500 h of continuous light soaking, whereas the reference devices lost more than 60% of their performance already after 150 h under the same conditions.
Introduction
Perovskite photovoltaics is among the most rapidly developing and promising areas in the field of renewable energy sources.1 A high power conversion efficiency along with low-cost production and the possibility of using printing technologies make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) a potential replacement for expensive and difficult-to-manufacture silicon solar panels.2 In addition, a possibility to produce flexible and lightweight PSCs becomes an additional advantage over silicon solar panels. The main obstacle to the widespread use of PSCs is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures and irradiation with light.3–5 Among the family of perovskite light-absorbing materials, inorganic cesium-based perovskite materials have gained much research interest due to their excellent thermal stability in contrast to their organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts.3,6,7 However, a weak spot of inorganic lead halides is poor phase stability. The cubic phase of CsPbI3 with the narrowest bandgap (1.72 eV) is only stable at high temperature converting rapidly to the yellow non-photoactive phase.8,9 Mixed lead halide perovskites CsPbI3−xBrx demonstrate enhanced stability due to the incorporation of smaller bromide ions into the perovskite lattice that leads to an increase in the tolerance factor. However, this is accompanied by an increase in the material bandgap.6 CsPbI2Br exhibits better balance between the bandgap (1.92 eV) and phase stability making this material the most attractive for photovoltaic applications, for example, in tandem solar cells.6,10 However, it has recently been shown that mixed lead halide perovskites undergo light-induced phase segregation to Br-rich and I-rich domains, which negatively affects the long-term stability of solar cells and represents a major challenge for their practical application.11–13 The low phase stability of cesium-based perovskite materials generates a high density of defects on the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystalline films, such as undercoordinated Pb2+ ions and surface charged defects. Moreover, recent studies indicate the defect-assisted nature of the phase photodegradation mechanism including light-induced phase segregation of mixed halide perovskites CsPbI3−xBrx.14–16 Stabilizing additives with multiple functional groups with opposite charges have recently been shown to be able to tightly bind with the perovskite surface. As an example, it is assumed that ammonium cations are capable of occupying the Cs-site position, while carboxylate groups bind to uncoordinated Pb and thus passivate surface defects and traps.17–22
Using this approach, a wide variety of organic compounds, such as organic ammonium salts,23–27 amino acids,28,29 ionic liquids,30,31 π-conjugated polymers,32,33etc.34,35 have been explored as stabilizing agents for CsPbI2Br. However, the vast majority of research was focused on exploring the effect of modification of the CsPbI2Br absorber on the stability of the films or solar cells with respect to humidity in an ambient environment or thermal stress (see examples in Table S1, ESI†), and insufficient attention was paid to the study of the photostability of the modified materials,23,35 which complicates the assessment of the possibility of their application under real solar cell operating conditions taking into account the propensity of CsPbI3−xBrx absorbers to light-induced phase segregation.
In this work, D,L-asparagine (Asn) as a zwitterionic stabilizing agent was applied to improve the phase photostability of cesium-based mixed halide perovskites. Taking the promising CsPbI2Br absorber as an example, it was found that the optimal Asn content in the perovskite film is able to substantially suppress the photoinduced phase separation in the absorbing material and provide long-term stability of photovoltaic devices under operating conditions.
Results and discussion
Structural and optical properties of Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br films
CsPbI2Br perovskite films with various levels of the Asn additive ranging from 0.5 to 3 wt% were deposited by the single-step spin-coating method from a solution of CsI and PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (see details in the Experimental section). It should be noted that Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br films were formed at a lower annealing temperature (230 °C) compared to the pristine perovskite (265 °C). The improved crystallization of the Asn loaded absorber can be attributed to the generation of intermediate states with a low formation energy.28,36

Fig. 1a and b illustrate the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra as well as the XRD patterns of the resulting films depending on the Asn loading. The pristine and modified CsPbI2Br films showed the same absorption edge at ∼650 nm corresponding to a bandgap of ∼1.91 eV. In addition, the perovskite films with 0.5–3% Asn showed slightly increased absorption compared to that of the pristine CsPbI2Br, which can be explained by the increased crystallinity of the material and a slight increase in the film thickness due to the higher solution viscosity (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  The evolution of the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra (a) and X-ray diffraction patterns (b) of the resulting CsPbI2Br films depending on the Asn loading. AFM topography (left column): s-SNOM amplitude images of the pristine and modified CsPbI2Br films with 0.5%, 1%, and 2% Asn loadings recorded at the characteristic frequency of D,L-asparagine (right column) (c). 
According to the XRD patterns in Fig. 1b, the crystal structure of CsPbI2Br is retained when Asn is added. The pristine and modified perovskite films revealed the main diffraction peaks of the (100) and (200) planes in the CsPbI2Br perovskite cubic lattice at 2θ = 14.7 and 29.7 deg.6 The films modified with 0.5% Asn show higher diffraction peak intensities suggesting an improved crystallinity of CsPbI2Br. A further increase in the Asn concentration leads to somewhat decreased diffraction peak intensity specifying the decay in the perovskite film crystallinity due to the dilution of the perovskite components by the amino acid additive. The observed findings suggest that the Asn additive is most likely distributed over the grain boundaries and is not incorporated into the perovskite lattice.
To investigate the morphology of the thin films and to reveal the features of the Asn distribution in the perovskite material, scattering-type scanning infrared near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM, IR-SNOM) was performed. This technique combines atomic force microscopy measurements revealing the film topography and local infrared spectroscopy analysis with a resolution of ca. 25–35 nm visualizing the distribution of the amino acid additive on the perovskite surface.
Fig. S1† shows the ATR (attenuated total reflection) FTIR spectra of D,L-asparagine; the characteristic Asn frequency of 1310 cm−1 was selected for IR s-SNOM measurements. The film topography (left) and s-SNOM phase contrast images recorded at the Asn frequency (right) for the pristine and modified CsPbI2Br films with different Asn loadings are presented in Fig. 1c. Using the lowest D,L-asparagine concentration of 0.5% results in an uneven distribution of the additive localized mainly between the perovskite grains at their boundaries (red and white areas in the s-SNOM image). Increase in the Asn loading up to 1% leads to the accumulation of the additive at the grain boundaries and also on the CsPbI2Br film surface. Further, using 2% Asn results in a complete and uniform coverage of CsPbI2Br grains with the additive (red color on the corresponding s-SNOM image). The obtained s-SNOM imaging results suggest that Asn is most likely not integrated in the perovskite lattice but forms a protective shell on the surface of the perovskite grains.
Fig. S2† shows the grain size distribution of perovskite thin films depending on the additive content extracted from the topography data. As the additive loading increased to 0.5%, the perovskite crystal size also increased. The further increase in the Asn content leads to a decrease in the average grain size. These findings are consistent with the XRD data discussed above (Fig. 1b).
As shown in Fig. 1a, the PL intensity of the Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br perovskite films is much higher than that of the pristine films and increases with the additive content. Since defects trap the electrons from the conduction band causing nonradiative recombination and decreasing the PL intensity, it can be assumed that the Asn additive distributed on the surface and grain boundaries can bind to the uncoordinated lead and halogen ions on the perovskite surfaces and thereby reduce the density of surface defects.17,18
To evaluate the influence of the Asn modifier on the charge carrier recombination dynamics in CsPbI2Br films, we investigated the dependence of the PL intensity on the power of the excitation beam (varied from 30 to 70 mW) for the pristine and modified CsPbI2Br films with 2% Asn (Fig. S3†). A decrease in the slope (S) of the integrated PL intensity versus the excitation power in double logarithmic coordinates from S = 2.23 (pristine CsPbI2Br) to S = 1.60 (CsPbI2Br + 2% Asn) indicates additive suppressed trap-assisted recombination.37 These findings suggest that Asn indeed heals the defects at the grain boundaries, thus reducing the density of traps for mobile charge carriers.
Phase stability of Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br films
To explore how Asn modification affects the phase photostability of CsPbI2Br, the pristine and modified perovskite films were deposited on glass substrates and exposed to light soaking (100 ± 5 mW cm−2) at 35 ± 2 °C for 2000 h in an inert atmosphere. The UV-vis absorption spectra and XRD patterns of the perovskite films before and after aging tests are compared in Fig. 2. As can be observed, the pristine CsPbI2Br films undergo dramatic photobleaching accompanied by a shift of the absorption band up to 715 nm pointing to the phase separation of the pristine material into Br-rich and I-rich domains already after 500 h (Fig. 2a). Further light soaking leads to a new band emerging at 500–530 nm characteristic of the CsPbBr∼3 perovskite (Eg = 2.3 eV for CsPbBr3) and a band at 370–480 nm due to the overlap of the absorption peaks of the Br-rich CsPbBr∼3 perovskite and the δ-phase of I-rich CsPbI∼3.
 Fig. 2  Comparison of the absorption spectra and XRD patterns (inset) of the perovskite films with different Asn loadings before and after light soaking at 100 ± 5 mW cm−2 and 35 ± 2 °C for 2000 h: (a) pristine, 0%, (b) 0.5%, (c) 1%, and (d) 2%. 
The band of the iodine-rich cubic phase becomes bleached and new peaks appear at 2θ = 15.2 and 30.7 deg. This also indicates the formation of a bromine-rich CsPbBr∼3 cubic perovskite phase. The iodine-rich cubic perovskite phase of CsPbI∼3 is thermodynamically unstable and undergoes transformation into the yellow δ-phase, which has low crystallinity but still can be observed after light soaking for 2000 h. In addition, the formation of lead iodide as a degradation product of I-rich CsPbI∼3 can be observed from the new peak at 12.6° (Fig. 2a, inset). Fig. S4a† shows the PL spectra of the CsPbI2Br films after 2000 h of light soaking, which reveal low-intensity peaks corresponding to bromide-rich CsPbBr∼3 and iodide-rich CsPbI∼3 perovskite phases. Thus, the UV-vis and PL spectroscopy data are consistent with the XRD analysis results and evidence the fast photodecomposition of the pristine CsPbI2Br film.
In contrast, CsPbI2Br films loaded with 0.5% Asn reveal a slower photodegradation rate as evidenced by less pronounced changes in their optical properties and lack of the PbI2 peak in the XRD pattern as compared to those of the pristine one (Fig. 2b and S4b†). In the case of CsPbI2Br with 1% D,L-asparagine, the photostabilization effect becomes even more visible. After aging for 1000 h, phase separation is still observed, but only photoactive cubic phases are revealed even after 2000 h of light soaking as evidenced by XRD measurements (Fig. 2c).
The PL spectra of the CsPbI2Br + 1% Asn films after 2000 h of light soaking show broadening and splitting in two overlapping emission bands, which indicates the presence of I- and Br-rich phases segregated on a large scale (Fig. S4c†). However, phase separation is noticeably suppressed as compared to the pristine CsPbI2Br.
An increase in the Asn loading to 2% essentially blocks light-induced phase separation in the CsPbI2Br films because no change is observed in their optical and structural properties after aging for 2000 h (Fig. 2d and S4d†). It is expected that the ammonium cations are capable of occupying the Cs-site position due to the zwitterionic form of D,L-asparagine arising from the proton transfer from the carboxylic to the amino group, while the carboxylate groups bind to undercoordinated Pb2+ ions and thus passivate the surface defects and traps thereby contributing to the enhanced phase photostability.17–22
We also compared the thermal stabilities of the pristine CsPbI2Br film and CsPbI2Br films modified with 2% Asn at 85 ± 3 °C in the dark. It was found that the CsPbI2Br films without the additive severely degrade within 40 h of annealing, while a complete decay of the photoactive perovskite phase was observed within 150 h. In contrast, the Asn-loaded films retain their optical properties within 150 h under the same conditions (Fig. S5†). Thus, using asparagine as a modifier for CsPbI2Br films enhances the thermal stability of this light absorbing material.
Photovoltaic performance of Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br absorbers
The effect of Asn modification on the photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br absorber films was investigated in a planar junction n-i-p device configuration ITO/c-TiO2/CsPbI2Br + x% Asn/PTA/VOx/Al (Fig. 3a). ITO glass substrates were coated with a compact TiO2 electron transport layer. The perovskite films were grown by the one-step spin-coating method. The Asn content in the precursor solution was varied from 0.5 to 2 wt%. PTA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine]) and vanadium oxide (VOx) were applied as hole-transport and electron-blocking layers, respectively. The device structure was completed by the evaporation of the top aluminum electrodes (details are given in the Experimental section).
 Fig. 3  Device architecture and the evolution of the PCE values of the devices depending on the Asn loading in the CsPbI2Br films (a), current–voltage characteristics (b) and EQE spectra of the best devices based on the pristine and modified perovskite films with different Asn loadings (c). Evolution of the normalized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices with pristine and modified absorbers within 1300 h of continuous 100 ± 5 mW cm−2 light exposure at 35 ± 2 °C under open-circuit conditions (d). 
The best device performances were achieved by the incorporation of 0.5% Asn into CsPbI2Br films as can be seen from Fig. 3a, S3 and Table S1.† The champion solar cells based on CsPbI2Br + 0.5% Asn absorber films delivered a PCE of 12.1% (VOC = 1115 mV; JSC = 14.4 mA cm−2; FF = 75.2%), whereas the pristine CsPbI2Br films showed maximal PCE values of 11.6%. This improvement in photovoltaic performance is mainly due to an increase in fill factors achieved likely due to the absorber film quality improvement, an increased average grain size, and enhanced crystallinity of perovskite. However, a further increase in Asn loading in the perovskite leads to some decrease in all photovoltaic parameters presumably due to the increased fraction of the non-photoactive material at the boundaries of perovskite grains in the absorber layer and, as a result, deterioration of the charge transport and collection ability (Fig. 3a and S6, and Table S2†).
The current–voltage characteristics of the best cells assembled using pristine and modified CsPbI2Br films with different Asn loadings are shown in Fig. 3b. The short circuit current densities obtained in these measurements were reconfirmed by the integration of the EQE spectra against the standard AM1.5G solar irradiation spectrum as shown in Fig. 3c.
Operational stability of solar cells based on Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br
The influence of the Asn content in the CsPbI2Br absorber on the operational stability of solar cells was studied under light soaking with white light (100 ± 5 mW cm−2) at T = 35 ± 2 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box for 1500 h.

Fig. 3d and S7† show that the Asn modification spectacularly enhances the operational stability of solar cells, whereas the stabilizing effect improved with an increase in the additive content. In particular, after 150 h of continuous light soaking the devices based on pristine CsPbI2Br lost about 60% of their initial efficiency and completely degraded after 1000 h. In contrast, the solar cells based on the absorber with 0.5%, 1%, and 2% Asn loading retained up to ∼25%, 52%, and 82% of the initial performance, respectively. Moreover, the most stable perovskite composition with 2% Asn ensured the retention of about 70% of the initial solar cell efficiency even after 1500 h of the aging test. It is worth noting that the achieved photostability is among the best results reported for this absorbing material (Table S1, ESI†).
Experimental
Preparation of the perovskite films
The glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol by sonication for 15 min followed by the RF-air plasma treatment for 5 min. A 0.4 M CsPbI2Br perovskite precursor solution was prepared by stoichiometrically mixing CsBr (99.99%, Aldrich) and PbI2 (99.9%, Lanhit) in an anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%, Aldrich) solution under an inert atmosphere in a nitrogen glove box with <0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O. Asn-loaded CsPbI2Br precursor solutions with various levels of the additive ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 wt% were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of the D,L-asparagine powder (PubChem) in the CsPbI2Br precursor solution. The perovskite films were grown by spin-coating the precursor solutions at 1200 rpm for 50 s. The obtained pristine and Asn-loaded perovskite films were annealed at 265 and 230 °C, respectively, for 1 min.
Characterization of the perovskite films
The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using an Aeris (Malvern PANalytical B.V.) diffractometer with a CuKα source. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the films were obtained using an AvaSpec-2048-2 fiber spectrometer integrated into a glove box. The PL spectra were recorded in an inert atmosphere using an Ocean Insight QE Pro spectrometer with a 450 nm laser as an excitation source (from 30 to 70 mW). FTIR spectra of the D,L-asparagine powder were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 instrument in the ATR mode using a ZnSe/diamond crystal. The morphology of the perovskite films and specific features of the Asn distribution in the perovskite material were probed using a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope operating in the mid-infrared spectral range (IR-neaSNOM, Neaspec, Germany, 2020) equipped with a standard metalized cantilever with a tip radius of 25–35 nm as described earlier.38
Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
The perovskite solar cells were fabricated in the n-i-p structure: ITO/TiO2/C60/CsPbI2Br + x% Asn/PTA/VOx/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol by sonication for 15 min followed by drying with nitrogen and RF air-plasma treatment for 5 min. To form the compact c-TiO2 layers, 140 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%, Acros) and 15 μL of 38% HCl (ChimMed) were separately diluted in 1 mL of absolute isopropanol, and then the HCl solution was added to the titania precursor, and the obtained solution was filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and deposited atop the cleaned ITO substrates by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The c-TiO2 layers were annealed at 450 °C for 20 min and transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box for deposition of the C60 (10 nm) layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum. The perovskite films were grown as described above. PTA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine]) was applied as a hole-transport material. Finally, the device structure was completed by the thermal evaporation of V2O5 (99.6%, Aldrich) (30 nm) and 120 nm thick aluminium electrodes. The active area of the solar cells ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 cm2. The solar cells were characterized by I–V and EQE measurements as reported previously.39
Conclusions
We proposed a simple and efficient method for enhancing the phase stability of inorganic mixed halide perovskites by their modification with a D,L-asparagine additive. Using CsPbI2Br as an example, we showed that the introduction of 2% Asn into the CsPbI2Br film led to a significant suppression of photoinduced phase segregation to Br-rich and I-rich phases upon continuous 100 mW cm−2 light exposure for 2000 h. The perovskite solar cells based on 2% Asn–CsPbI2Br with a PCE content of 9.1% retained ∼70% of the initial efficiency after 1500 h of continuous light soaking (100 mW cm−2), while the reference devices with pristine CsPbI2Br lost more than 60% of the initial efficiency already after 150 h under the same conditions. We strongly believe that these findings would open up a new opportunity for the development of mixed halide perovskite solar cells, including tandem devices, with excellent operation stability.
