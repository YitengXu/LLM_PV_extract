    , Accepted 11th April 2012First published on 18th April 2012AbstractThe two pairs of structurally related donor–acceptor polymers (P1–P4) derived from diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and diazapentalene (DAP) building blocks were synthesized and compared for their optical and photovoltaic properties with potential applications in solar cells and near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors. Having the electron-rich fluorene and bis(2′-thienyl)pyrrole (TPT) units as donors, the synthesized donor–acceptor polymers have band gap levels in the range 1.22–1.79 eV. The solar cells based on the blend of P2 (DPP–TPT polymer) and PC71BM exhibited the best performance, showing a Voc of 0.61 V, Jsc of 10.38 mA cm−2, FF of 0.44 and PCE of 2.8%. The photodetector based on the NIR-absorbing P4 (DAP–TPT polymer) displayed a good photovoltaic response over a wide spectral range of 400–1100 nm and an EQE of 13% and detectivity of 2.3 × 1010 Jones at 800 nm.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) continue to receive much attention in research and development, mainly because of the demands for renewable energy technologies as well as the need for flexible, low-cost and large-area processing for manufacturing.1,2 One of the promising OPV devices is a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell, such as the one containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron acceptor.3,4 The photovoltaic process in OPV devices typically involves the following processes: (1) absorption of light and generation of excitons, (2) diffusion of the excitons, (3) dissociation of the excitons with generation of charge, and (4) charge transport and charge collection.5 Therefore, the donor materials to be used in BHJ solar cells should have intense and broad absorption into the near-infrared (NIR) region (e.g., above 750 nm) and a high charge mobility and also be able to generate efficiently free charge carriers.
In addition to P3HT, some p-type semiconducting and donor–acceptor polymers have been developed for use in BHJ solar cells having a PCE approaching 7%.6–13 The donor–acceptor polymers containing the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit as an electron acceptor have been subjected to intense study and shown a great potential for use in BHJ solar cells and other devices. For example, the BHJ solar cells containing benzofuran-substituted thienyl-DPP compounds and PC71BM were reported to have a PCE up to 4.4%.14 A polymer containing thienyl-DPP exhibited high electron and hole mobility and demonstrated its usefulness in a solar cell showing a PCE of 5.5%.15 By using a suitable co-monomer as a donor, a copolymer of DPP and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene exhibited a high mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 and was successfully employed in a BHJ solar cell to achieve a PCE of 5.4%.16 To date, a variety of aromatic moieties, such as thiophene,17 phenyl,15 fluorene,18 carbazole,19 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole,20 benzothiadiazole,21 and benzofuran,21 have been used together with DPP and a large stockpile of DPP-based materials have been produced for research and development of optoelectronic devices.
Another emerging OPV device is a polymer-based photodetector (PPD) with a high detectivity over a wide visible-NIR spectral range. PPD devices are particularly required for applications in the fabrication of large-area and low-cost electronic devices, but PPD devices with the NIR response are still scarce.22,23 A breakthrough was made recently with the demonstration of BHJ PPDs having a high detectivity over a wide range of the visible and NIR spectral region. Heeger et al. reported a PPD based on a blend of small-band-gap polymer, poly(5,7-bis(4-decanyl-2-thienyl)-thieno(3,4-b)diathiazole-thiophene-2,5) (PDDTT), and PC61BM which exhibited a broad spectral response (300 to 1450 nm) with a detectivity greater than 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a linear dynamic range over 100 decibels.23 Since only a few DPP-containing polymers with absorption above 750 nm were reported for use as donor materials in solar cells,20,21,24 it is necessary to develop a new series of NIR-absorbing polymers for use in NIR PPDs. Ideally, most of the target polymers can be constructed from a new chromophore unit similar to the DPP building block.
DPP has a planar, conjugated 8π-electron bicyclic ring and contains the indigo-like, cross-conjugated vinylogous amidic and vinylogous hydrazine units. Its lactim form contains a bicyclic 2,5-diazapentalene (DAP) unit (Fig. 1). By analogy, dithioketopyrrolopyrrole (DTPP), derived from DPP by thionation,25 also contains a DAP moiety in its lactim form and can readily be S-alkylated to yield a variety of DAP chromophores. In comparison with DPP, the lack of the donation from lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen to the π-orbital of the diene moiety may lower the HOMO levels and narrow the energy gap of DAP-based chromophores. Thus, the DAP unit can be considered and used as a building block for construction of a variety of low bandgap compounds and polymers that may show some interesting properties similar to or better than DPP-based organic materials.
 Fig. 1  Transformation of DPP to DAP chromophores. 
One such DAP building block is compound 6 derived from the readily available dithienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole 3 (Scheme 1). It can be envisioned that a wide range of polymers and copolymers can be synthesized from compound 6 and other known compounds as co-monomers. In this paper, we present the two pairs of structurally related DPP- and DAP-containing donor–acceptor polymers P1–P4 (Chart 1), for a purpose to evaluate the DAP-containing polymers for potential applications in solar cells and NIR photodetectors with the reference to DPP-based polymers. DPP polymers P1 and P2 were derived from acceptor monomer 1 and two donor monomers 2 and 7; DAP polymers 3 and 4 were synthesized using a new DAP monomer (6) and the same pair of donor monomers (Scheme 1).

Experimental section
Materials
All the chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without purification. Solvents for chemical synthesis were purified by distillation. Chemical reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. 3,6-Bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (1),24 2,5-bis(5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-N-dodecylpyrrole (2),26 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (3),27 and 9,9-dioctyl-2,7-bis(trimethyleneboronate)fluorene (7)28 were prepared according to literature methods.
Methods

1H (300 MHz) and 13C (75 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer. 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a Vario EL Elemental Analysis Instrument. Mass spectrometry was obtained by 7.0 T Actively Shielded Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometers (HRMS) and a Micromass Quattro LC ESI mass spectrometer (EI). The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Waters 410 instrument and polystyrene as standard and THF as eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out in nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 on a Hi-Res TGA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer and a TA-DSC Q100 (TA Instruments), respectively. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Lambda 900 Perkin-Elmer UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer and a PTI fluorescence system (near infrared region) or a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorophotometer (visible region), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a BAS 100B/W electrochemical workstation. Anhydrous dichloromethane was used as the solvent under an argon atmosphere, and 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte. A platinum disk (2 mm diameter) was used as working electrode, a platinum wire was used as counter-electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference electrode. All measurements were done using a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. The energy levels were calculated relative to a ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple as an internal reference.

Fabrication and characterization of a solar cell device
The solutions of polymer blends were prepared by dissolving polymers and fullerene derivative in different ratios in chlorobenzene at a total concentration of 2 wt%. The solutions were stirred for 12 h before device fabrication. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated according to the following procedure: ITO-coated glass was cleaned with detergent followed by ultrasonication in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then was kept at 150 °C for 30 min. After complete drying, ITO-coated glass was treated with UV-ozone to improve the wettability of PEDOT:PSS. After spin-coating 35 nm of PEDOT:PSS, the active layer was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1500 rpm for 60 s. LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under vacuum lower than 3 × 10−6 Torr on the top of the active layer through a shadow mask. For thermal annealing, the completed devices were placed directly onto a digitally controlled hot plate and heated to 150 °C for the desired time. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based Newport 91160 300 W Solar Simulator. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.
Fabrication and characterization of a photodetector device
Polymer P4 and PC61BM (1:2 weight ratio) were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and the solution was stirred at 40 °C for more than 60 h. Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned, sequentially, by ultrasonic treatment in detergent at 90 °C for 1.5 h, then washed with water and de-ionized water, dried under a stream of nitrogen and then in an oven at 110 °C. Prior to use, the ITO-coated slides were treated by UV-ozone plasma for 60 s. A thin film (∼40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto clean ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s, and then baked at 120 °C for 30 min. The active layer solution was spin-coated at a speed of 1000 rpm for 60 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and an Al (100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation on top of the active layer. Then the devices were annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. They were then taken out of the oven to cool down. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were done using a tungsten lamp and a monochromator with a lock-in amplifier to eliminate background noise. The reference was a calibrated Si photodiode with the known EQE spectra. The detectivity was calculated according to ref. 23. If the shot noise from the dark current is the major contribution, the detectivity (D*) is calculated from the following equation:D* = R/(2qJd)1/2 = (Jph/Llight)/(2qJd)1/2
Fabrication and characterization of a transistor device
The top-contact and bottom-gate geometry was used to fabricate and test field-effect transistors. Heavily n-doped silicon substrates acted as gate electrode and thermally grown silicon dioxide (300 nm thick; Ci = 10.7 nF cm−2) as gate insulator. Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2 was prepared by soaking the substrates in a 5 mM toluene solution of OTS for 12 h in a dry N2-filled glovebox. Substrates with the structure of glass/PSS/polymers were prepared by successive spin-coating of an aqueous solution of PSS and a 2 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution of the polymers. This polymer film was gently brought into contact with the target substrate with the polymer face down. One drop of water was placed on the edge of the two stacked substrates. The PSS layer was selectively permeated by water. After 1–5 min, the water flowed from one side of the substrate to the other, and the PSS layer was completely dissolved. Finally, the glass substrate was easily detached from the organic layer, resulting in the transfer of the polymer film from the glass to the target substrate. Gold electrodes were evaporated onto the surface through a metal mask with a channel width (W) of 500 μm and length (L) of 50 μm.
Output (Idsvs. Vds) and transfer (Idsvs. Vg) characteristics of the devices were measured on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system (Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, OH). Field-effect mobility was calculated from the standard equation for the saturation region: Ids = μ(W/2L)Ci(Vg − Vt)2 where Ids is the drain–source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W and L are the channel width and length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator (Ci = 10.7 nF cm−2), Vg is the gate voltage, and Vt is the threshold voltage.
The films for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of surface morphology were spin-coated onto a PEDOT:PSS layer on a ITO glass substrate and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in nitrogen atmosphere. Tapping-mode AFM was performed with a Nanoscope III (Digital Instruments, Inc.).
Results and discussion
Syntheses and characterizations of monomers and polymers
By comparing the LUMO level of DAP compound 5 (−3.70 eV) with that of a DPP compound, 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (−3.13 eV),29 one can expect that the polymers containing the more electron-deficient DAP unit have a lower band gap or absorb at a longer wavelength than those derived from the DPP counterpart. 9,9-Dioctylfluorene and N-alkyl-2,5-bis(2′-thienyl)pyrrole (TPT) were used as donor in the designed polymers. DPP monomer 1,19 and the two boronic ester monomers, TPT 2 (ref. 26) and 7,28 were synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature. DAP monomer 6 was synthesized from DPP 3, which can be quantitatively converted to dithioketo compounds in the presence of Lawesson's reagent, followed by alkylation and bromination that gave monomer 6 with high yield.
DPP polymer P1 was synthesized according to ref. 18,24 and 30. Polymers P2–P4 were prepared by Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization. P1 was obtained with a number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of 62 kDa (Table 1), while P2 was obtained with lower molecular weight, possibly due to its poor solubility. DAP polymers P3 and P4 were synthesized by the same polymerization procedure and obtained with number-average molecular weights of 11 and 12 kDa, respectively. All these polymers are readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform and chlorobenzene.

Thermal stability is an important parameter for organic materials to be processed for applications in optoelectronic devices. Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to evaluate the phase transition and thermal property of all the synthesized polymers. The TG traces are shown in Fig. S1† and the data are listed in Table 1. The TG study indicates that DPP polymers P1 and P2 possess good thermal stability in nitrogen with a decomposition temperature above 300 °C. DAP polymers P3 and P4 are thermally stable up to 250 °C. Polymers P1–P3 exhibit a glass transition temperature (Tg) between 100 and 150 °C, except for P4.
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of these polymers in chloroform and films are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of these polymers show mainly two bands, one in the high energy region from ca. 300–500 nm and another in the region from 500–900 nm. It is interesting to note that the absorption spectrum of the thin film of P2, in comparison with the spectrum of its solution, covers a wide range from 500 nm to 900 nm with the onset of absorption being red shifted about 150 nm. The same phenomenon due to strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state was observed for P4, its absorption spectrum maximum was red-shifted about 90 nm and absorption onset was red-shifted more than 300 nm. Because of the more electron-deficient nature of the DAP unit, the absorption maxima of DAP-containing polymers (P3 and P4) were red-shifted about 70 nm compared to the DPP counterparts.

Energy level measurements
The energy level is a key factor for the materials to be used in photovoltaic devices. For example, Voc relates to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the p-type polymers and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM.31 The offset of the LUMO level between the p-type and n-type materials determines the exciton dissociation efficiency,32 thereby affecting the power conversion efficiency. The redox potentials of these polymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane (1.0 mM), with reference to a Ag/Ag+ electrode, and were calibrated using a ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The CV profiles of P2–P4 are shown in Fig. 3. P2 has a reduction potential of −0.73 V, indicating that the LUMO is localized on the DPP unit, but a lower oxidation potential than P1, which may be caused by interaction between adjacent TPT units in the chain. This phenomenon was also observed for other similar conjugated polymers.33 Due to the presence of a stronger DAP acceptor, P3 and P4 have the reduction potential onset of −0.96 V and −0.90 V and accordingly the LUMO levels of −3.84 eV and −3.90 eV, respectively.

Solar cell devices
Photovoltaic properties of the four polymers were characterized using BHJ solar cells with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (∼100 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 4a). The active layer consists of one of the four polymers and a fullerene derivative (PC61BM or PC71BM). All the devices were tested under simulated air mass coefficient AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of P2 are shown in Fig. 4 and all the data are summarized in Table 2. The photovoltaic properties of P1 have been reported elsewhere,18 and is listed in Table 2 for comparison. The PCE of P1 was lower than the reference reported (0.4% vs. 0.9%18). Using P2 together with a different amount of PC61BM, the Voc and FF values remained almost constant but the highest Jsc of 6.36 mW cm−2 was obtained with the 1:2 ratio of P2:PC61BM. Owing to the increased absorption of PC71BM from 440 nm to 530 nm,34 the devices with P2 and PC71BM had a higher Jsc (10.38 mA cm−2). The best performance was obtained from the devices with a blend of P2:PC71BM in a ratio of 1:2 by weight, showing a Voc of 0.61 V, Jsc of 10.38 mA cm−2, FF of 0.44, and thus a PCE of 2.8%. A better performance of P2 over P1 could be attributed to the TPT moiety in P2 with a more extended π-conjugation than fluorene in P1, which may give rise to a higher mobility to P2. The charge carrier mobility of polymer P2 was then measured in a bottom-gate, top-contact field-effect transistor which was prepared by the contact film transfer method.35 The transistor devices of P2 exhibited typical p-type behavior as shown by the transfer and output curves in Fig. S2†. A clear field effect was observed from the output characteristics, and the hole mobility was estimated to be 7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the transfer characteristics in the saturation regime (Vds = −60 V). The hole mobility of P2 was higher than that of P1 (4.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), which may explain why the PV performance of P2 was superior.36

Polymers P3 and P4 have lower HOMO levels than that of P2, but this did not lead to better performance (PCE ≈ 0.3%) in solar cells, as their Voc values were low (0.3 V). It is known that the Voc depends not only on the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, but also on the active layer morphology and the interaction between the polymer and PCBM.9,37 As shown in Fig. 5, the films of P2 and PC71BM with 1:1 and 1:2 weight ratios appeared to have morphology similar to the bicontinuous interpenetrated network with small domain sizes. There are continuous fiber-like structures with a fiber diameter about 10–20 nm and the donor-rich domains are homogeneously distributed (Fig. 5b). The domain size is close to the exciton diffusion length (ca. 5–10 nm), thereby favoring the exciton dissociation and thus enhancing the PCE.38 In comparison, the morphology of films made from the blend of P2 and PC61BM had a larger domain size (Fig. S3†), which is responsible for the lower Voc and PCE. The AFM image of the film of P4 and PC61BM (1:2 weight ratio) reveals the relatively poor morphology, even after many attempts using different solvents and annealing conditions (Fig. 5c).

Near-infrared photodetector
Given the relatively broad absorption (i.e., 600–1000 nm) but rather poor performance of the solar cell of polymer P4, we further evaluate its potential for use in photodetectors, in particular the detectivity (D*) within a wide UV-Vis-NIR spectral region (400–1000 nm). The photodetector devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al, in which the active layer comprises a blend of P4 and PC61BM in a weight ratio of 1:2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) profile within a spectral range of ∼600 nm to 900 nm matches well with the absorption spectrum of P4 in solution, demonstrating the NIR photovoltaic response arising from P4 (Fig. 6). The EQE at 800 nm was calculated to be 13% under −4.0 V bias, being comparable to that of some of the reported organic NIR photodetectors.22,39 From the EQE and dark current, the detectivity within a spectral range of 400–1100 nm was obtained (Fig. 6b). Clearly, the photodetector has a good response to the visible and NIR light, with the detectivity greater than 1010 Jones at the wavelength from 400 nm to 900 nm. The detectivity at 800 nm was calculated to be 2.3 × 1010 Jones under −0.1 V bias. This preliminary result indicates that the low bandgap DAP polymers are more suited for use in NIR photodetectors. The device performance can be further improved by optimization of the bandgap levels and morphology of DAP polymers to enhance the photovoltaic properties and by introduction of a hole or electron blocking layer in device fabrication to lower the dark current.23

Conclusions
A new electron-deficient building block of DAP derived from DPP has been successfully utilized to yield low bandgap polymers. By comparing the photovoltaic properties of the two pairs of DPP- and DAP-containing donor–acceptor polymers, the DPP polymers perform better than DAP polymers in solar cells, whereas the NIR-absorbing DAP polymers are more promising for use in the NIR photodetectors. Fine tuning of the bandgap of DAP polymers, better morphology control and multi-layer device optimization should further improve some key parameters of polymer photodetectors such as the EQE, dark current, spectral range of photovoltaic response and detectivity.
